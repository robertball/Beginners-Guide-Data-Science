I don't like adding that much sugar, usually substitute part of the sugar for honey.  I also like adding a little lime juice to the mixture.

WOW!  I don't give anything 5 stars unless it truly is fabulous.  I love Lassi (particularly mango or strawberry).  I used strawberries instead of mangoes and it was absolutely DELICIOUS!  NOTE:  With regards to the sugar - it is just the right amount!

I've never had a Mango Lassi before nor have I ever heard of them, so I have no idea what they're *supposed* to taste like.  I made this only for Hubs this morning as I'm not a fan of yogurt based drinks. Since I used Greek-style vanilla yogurt I reduced the sugar by half, which turned out to be just right.  He described this as rich, creamy and pleasantly sweet with a mild mango flavor.  He found it refreshing and rated it four stars.  I, however, found it tasted more or less like thinned out yogurt - I'd rather have a cup of yogurt!

Very good! A little sweet so maybe next time I would use a little less sugar. Other than that, no complaints here!

I enjoyed the lassi, but found it to not be mango-y enough, so I added 1 extra mango. =) I prefer my lassi to be more 'refreshing' and less thick, so I also added a splash of milk. I am, admittedly. very picky about lassi, since I drink it wherever I find it, and I live in the Bay Area, so it's quite prevalent! Thanks for the recipe!

Very good - not quite as creamy as the lassi I'm used to, but it had a pleasant taste to it.

This is really tasty! I cheated and used frozen mango instead of adding ice :) I didnt use a 1/2 cup sugar. I just did it to taste which was about 3 Tablespoons.

I used this recipe more like a list of ingredients. I used much less sugar just because my mangoes were really ripe. Delicious! Making again tomorrow =)

I love mango lassi and have made them many times. I find it difficult to get really good mangoes at grocery stores, so now I just get canned mango pulp from my indian grocer. It tastes better and makes making this so much faster and less expensive. Also I find mixing in a blender puts too much air into the drink and gives it an odd texture. I use 1 part yogurt to 1 part mango pulp to 2 parts milk. I sweeten to taste, add a dash of rosewater and stir that enough for the sugar to dissolve. I pour it into glasses with a few ice cubes, stir and serve. This turns out just like the restaurant beverage rather than drinking thick pulpy yogurt.

I was floored by how good this is. Half the sugar was good enough for these particular mangos.

Delicious! That's a  good mango lassi. The sugar was just right (but I'm a sweet tooth, hehe) I *must* try it with strawberries.

All we could taste was yogurt.  Too sweet and 2 cups of yogurt is WAY TOO MUCH and Nobody in my family liked it and won't be making this again.

This was good, but I do not think I'd want to make this again, or at least very often, just because it's difficult to blend w/essentially no liquid.  I had to do a lot of scrape/blend back & forth to get it to start mixing well, and I'd dumped the ice in first (only way my blender will crush it) which started getting liquidy as I went.  In the end I managed to mix the holy heck out of it and not have even any fibrous stuff, but it took a while.  I only had one mango - this was my first experience with fresh mango as well - so I filled in with 1-1/2 cups of Trader Joe's chunked frozen.  (Cheaper anyway.)  I used vanilla yogurt since I rarely have plain on hand.  That's a lot of sugar.  I didn't think it was too sweet.  The fresh mango was very ripe but it still seemed to need sweetening.  It's just more a matter of shoving that much sugar in me than a concern about the taste.

Wonderful drink! I cut down on the sugar a bit but otherwise followed recipe precisely. Awesome texture. My girls devoured this, which is always a good sign.

This was good, but the mangos made it taste incredibly chalky.  At least the kids enjoyed.  4 stars because I know it is not the recipe's fault!

Tasty, but a bit too sweet.  I guess it depends on the kind of mango/puree you use, but I'd bring the sugar down by 1/4 cup.  I used a mango smoothie (Jet brand) used by restaurants for smoothies, so maybe that was why.  Next time I'll use the frozen mango chunks from the freezer section.  My favorite mangoes aren't in season - but are usually sold in Asian markets - the elongated, orange, smooth-skinned kind that peels easily when sliced.

PERFECT! I love mango and pretty much any drink that is prepared in a blender but this is going to be one that I make a lot! For convience I used Dole all natural frozen mangos that are already peeled and cut into small chunks. Still tasted great!

This is wonderfully refreshing! I usually don't have fresh mango on hand, and so I use 3 cups frozen mango that I buy in bulk. We love it so much, that it has become a regular fixture at our Saturday morning breakfast table!

I try to omit sugar when possible and find that if you ripen mangoes to the very wrinkled stage, then this recipe is very good without sugar. Thanks!

I really just used this recipe as a guide. Because other reviewers complained about the lassi being too watery, I initially blended the mangoes with just one cup of yogurt. It was quite thick, so I added more yogurt bit by bit until it was the consistency I was looking for. Also, I just dropped the ice cubes in as I don't think my blender would have ground them up properly. This is so delicious and refreshing! Thanks, Yonna!

My son loves to order a mango lassi at our fav. nepalese restaurant, but for some reason, it never occurred to me we could make them at home. Don't know why, as we are always making smoothies . Anyway, came across this recipe and it is delicious! I used frozen mango halves from Trader Joes, and used the ice also, so it was very thick. My son thought it tasted perfect, but I think the sugar could be cut a little.

Wow! I picked up a big, juicy Mango from Whole Foods. It was so sweet & good by itself . . .I knew this was going to be a great smoothie. I used organic yogurt & sprinkled in a little Cardamon. It was so, so fresh & good!!

I have to cut the sugar some depending on the sweetness of the mango.  Today's mango was really sweet & ripe so I didn't need as much sugar as called for.  It is all a matter of taste.  This is a great recipe.  I love it because I can store what I don't drink in the fridge and it is good the next day also.

I made these to go with an Indian-themed dinner, and I always liked lassis whenever I went out to the local Indian restaurant. These were really superb, and perfect for cooling off the tongue after a mouthful of curry-smothered meats or veggies. I cut the sugar amount in half, and it was PLENTY sweet! I haven't had a lassi - or even mango - in years, and this brought the memories back on in full force. Thanks for the recipe!

The next best thing to a fresh mango is a mango lassi.  It was delicious!  In Virginia, the best mangos we can find come from Mexico.  Let the mangos ripen on the counter, then move to fridge for up to several days until ready to use.

This is my first experience with mangos, and I was very pleased with it.  I've discovered a new fruit!  I wanted just one serving, and since my mango was on the small side, I started out with just 1/2 cup of yogurt.  It was plenty for me.  I also subbed Splenda for the sugar.  I came out with a very refreshing, thick, fruity drink.

A very good, refreshing drink.  I did not care for the fibrous hair-like threads in it. I don't know how to reduce tht w/o a juicer.

YUM! This was just as good as the ones I get in the Indian part of town in Chicago! I did make some changes.  I used 1 1/2 cups of Whole Foods frozen mango and 1/2 14oz can of Whole Foods canned mango. This was much easier than waiting for mangoes to ripen and cutting them. I did not use any ice. Also, I added the 2 cups of plain low fat yogurt and 1/3c of white sugar. I can't believe how good this was!!!

Refreshing and healthy to boot! Use natural yogurt (no thickeners or stabilizers) for best results. I did not use nearly as much sugar as the recipe called for, as my mangoes were very ripe. You must enjoy the flavor of yogurt to appreciate this drink. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was great as is, but I also did a version with Greek yogurt and no sugar, which works if the mangos are very ripe; otherwise the sugar amount is to taste.  Thank you for this recipe!

This is so easy to make and delicious, after trying it a few times, this is the ratio that works for us - 400g mango chunks, 600ml yogurt, 2-3 tbs honey (depending how sweet the mangos are), 8-10 ice cubes (vary for thickness of the lassi), dash of cinnamon.

I used frozen Mango chunks instead because it is cheaper and good mangos are not always easy to find.  With that, I cut back the yogurt to 1 cup and added 1 cup evaporated milk.  Adding a splash of mango nectar would probably give it that really strong mango taste.  If I double the batch, I have enough to make mango lassie Popsicles for the kids to have as healthy snacks.

This was a very pleasant surprise. I wouldn't say it's "absolutely heavenly" like the description says, but it was very tasty. I had some plain yogurt to use up, and I don't like the taste of it very much at all. And I'd never bought fresh mangoes before, so seeding them was an experience. I was skeptical about the mangos and sugar adding enough sweetness to hide the bitterness of the yogurt, but they really did. I was also skeptical about the results being liquid enough to drink, but they really were - perhaps this was because I used 1 cup of ice by weight (8 oz.) instead of using a measuring cup. I'd been seeing lassi recipes for a while, and had never had one, so this was a great introduction, and I just may make them again sometime.

It's o.k, definitely not restaurant quality. If you want it to taste like the restaurant use mango puree in the can. It really makes the difference plus add a little water so it's not so insanely thick.

I love this smoothie!  It is creamy and perfect.  I drink one almost daily for a healthy lowfat breakfast.  You can alter the sugar depending on the sweetness of the mango.  I usually use one heaping tablespoon for each mango and it's sweet enuff.  I have also thrown in a ripe banana and it was delish!  You have to try this drink!

I was on a mission to use up the quart of plain yogurt in my fridge and this was one of the 4 recipes I found to help me do that.  I had a bag of frozen mango chunks from shoprite and I opted to make a simple syrup using 1/3 c sugar and 1/3 c water since I didn't need ice with frozen fruit going in.  Blended it up in my ninja and I'm very happy with the results.

Ok so this recipe tastes just like melted yogurt if you put that much plain yogurt. I cut it by half atleast, and added an equal amount of milk. The ice is crucial, if it's not cold, it's not that great. After these changes it tasted really good.

My blender doesn't like to tackle ice so I used about 3/4 cup of milk instead. I also like to use a little less sugar. Super creamy & refreshing!

This was delish. I will definitely make this again and again. Next time I will be cutting the sugar. And I think the amount of mango was perfect personally.

This was easy and so delicious! It reminded me of a Caribbean drink I grew up with made with orange juice, milk, sugar, vanilla and I ice. The only thing I did different was added a little milk, about half a cup because it was too thick. I also used brown sugar instead of white, about 3 tablespoons, and added a teaspoon of vanilla extract. I omitted the ice because I didn't want the watered down taste.  Other similar recipes had these minor differences-no ice and milk instead. It was soooo good!

I was looking for a mango recipe for my teenage son.  I'd been drinking berry protein smoothies and wanted him to get a little fruit in his diet, but the only fruit he seemed to like was mango. So I picked up a bag of frozen chopped mango.  I halved the recipe in case he didn't like it and used vanilla almond milk instead of yogurt, just as I do in my smoothies. He loved it, so  we tried adding about a 1/4 cup of chopped frozen pineapple which was quite tasty!   I will adjust the amount of the sugar to suit us.  But am quite thankful for the recipe!

The mangoes at my local grocery are not sweet so I used a 15oz can of sliced mangoes. Then I adjusted the other ingredients to taste. This is a good way to use up left over plain yogurt.

YUMMY! I added some milk because it was pretty thick, and I cut the sugar in half. Wonder if it would go well with some coconut rum...

I love mango lassis & this was delicious! I used whole milk yogurt.  Next time I would decrease the yogurt by 1/2 cup & add a 1/2 cup milk to make it a little thinner.

Very good as is, but, after drinking a glass my entire dinner party were feeling a sugar rush. I think that it would be much better with the sugar cut in half. And, I made this with strawberries, too, and it's fantastic.

I love mango lassi. One of the things that I do differently is, instead of cutting up the mangoes and adding a lot of sugar, I use mango puree or mango jam from the grocery store. It makes it creamier and sugar is already added in the puree and jam. :)

WOW it was absolutely wonderful! i am so surprised by how well it was! And although made it with only 2 mangos (supposedly serving 2 people) it could have fed up to four! it was a wonderful dish and i would not change a thing :) make sure you use FRESH mangos for the best taste!

This is good as written, but the mango flavor isn't very pronounced. I think it could be better by either increasing the amount of mango or decreasing the amount of yogurt used. BTW, I used a little honey and no white sugar.

I definately changed the recipe a bit.  I use two mangos, about 1 cup of yogurt and 1/4 cup sugar.  I throw about 4/5 ice cubes in.  This gives it a nice mango taste without the yogurt becoming to overbearing and cuts down on the sugar while still tasting delicious.

Had some plain yogurt I needed to use up before it went bad and just happened to have two mangoes!  This tastes great.  Used 4 spoonfuls of honey instead of sugar--0 sugar used and added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon.  Probably would be fine without cinnamon too.  Just added a few ice cubes, but I don't like cold things.  Will make again

So incredibly smooth, delicious, and easy!  I love that all the ingredients are common, too.  We used lowfat yogurt, but I bet nonfat would have been just as creamy, and it would have added some nice extra tartness.  We'll make this again and again!!

i loved this mango lassi, though i did change it a bit. i halved this recipe (just for me!) and, for the more health-conscious, i suggest replacing the white sugar with 1 tbsp (or less!) of raw cane sugar, especially if the mangoes are already naturally really sweet. i also replaced plain unsweetened kefir for the yogurt and added cinnamon which i loved! what a delicious drink!

Great!  I've never had it before so I have nothing to compare it to, but I think it's delicious. I used less yogurt than called for because I wanted to use greek nonfat vanilla yogurt.  My suggestions:  Less sugar (I liked it when I used agave nectar, only about a tablespoon per serving), and some lime juice make it super great!

Wow! Just made this drink. Never had it before. I only had one mango so I added 1/2 cup frozen strawberries. Used honey instead of sugar. So, so good! Next time I'll cut back to about 1/4 cup honey because it was very sweet (personal preference).

YUM!  I omitted the sugar and used a Splenda packet and used fat-free yogurt.  I also used frozen mango. It was thick and delicious!  Good for a sweet fix.

This was the perfect end to a nice light summer dinner!  It wasn't too sweet and it had a great texture.  I used Greek yogurt, because I'm not a purist, so that might have contributed to how creamy and thick this came out.  Very tasty!

I made it just as the recipe stated and they came out BETTER than the ones I have to wait for at my local Indian restaurant. My guests even had these as dessert, even though I had other things for them. They loved them! The sugar wasn't even a problem, I "lightened" it up by using lowfat yogurt, but other than that, followed it to the letter.

This was so delicious!  I am so happy I can now make mango lassi myself and avoid paying $5 per glass at Indian restaurants.  Note that the yogurt amount needs to be adjusted based on the size and ripeness of the mangoes.  For larger mangoes, fresh off a tree (like my family has in Miami), 2 cups yogurt is perfect.  However for store-bought mangoes, I would use 1/4 to 1/2 cup less yogurt.  Even when store-bought mangoes ripen on the counter for a week after you buy them, they will still never have the flavor of mangoes picked when they're ripe on the tree.  This recipe is simple and amazingly delicious!

Absolutely delicious! Since I used frozen mangos I also added some mango juice to help in the blender, then I omitted the ice. I didn't add any sugar because it was perfect for my taste.

Very good and easy to make!  My store had mangoes on sale, so I had to try this recipe.  I think you could cut down on the sugar, but I used vanilla flavored yogurt, so perhaps that added some sweetness.  Overall, very good and refreshing.

Made this for breakfast. I used peach yogurt, a dash of ginger, and omitted the sugar because my yogurt was sweetened already. The peach and mango are fabulous together. Great way to use fresh mango.

This recipe was good, I used frozen mango which meant I didn't have to add ice cubes. The result was a thick, creamy shake. It was missing something, though, and I don't know what it is. I think next time I will use Philippine mangoes since they are sweeter and have a nicer flavor. Also, next time I will add a little bit of rosewater.

Very good!  It was a thick drink, but I like that consistency in a smoothie.  My husband thought it would be better with more mango and a more liquidy consistency, but agan, I like it thick.  I will make it the same way next time.  I would only use a tablespoon or so of sugar next time though, as I don't like things too sweet and it is healthier that way! :)

Delicious! But it makes way more than the recipe claims. I made a 1.5 recipe hoping for three servings, and it filled my blender all the way to the top. (Not a problem, just worth noting.) Since the mangoes we get here in Taiwan are huge, I used three cups of chopped mango instead of three entire mangoes. Next time I might try a little less mango and more yogurt to give it a tangier flavor. Definitely worth making again while mangoes are in season!

My mom loves adding a little vanilla ice cream instead of the ice. She also uses mango pulp when fresh sweet mangoes are unavailable. I've found that the type of mango you use definitely changes the flavor and sweetness.

I did like this, but it really needed more mango and less yogurt. The mango taste was to diluted.

I was short on plain yogurt, so switching to vanilla yogurt and it was an astonishing turnout.  I highly recommend making this with plain or vanilla yogurt. But my sibling despised it, she doesn't like many good things...

I am use to having Mango Lassi and this recipe was delicious. I used the above recipe the first time and I felt as if I could fast the sugar in the drink. I prefer having less yogurt and no sugar to get the most out of the Mango goodness. It is very sweet! It says it makes two servings but mango can be pretty heavy so I consider this to be 2-4 servings depending your sugar tolerance.

I have to admit that at first I was skeptical but now, this recipe is my new favorite!Another reviewer claimed that the only way to go would be to use the canned mango so that it could taste like at the restaurants...why settle for the restaurant flavor when homemade tastes soooo much better.  I had some fresh mangoes that were so ripe they only had a few more days before they would spoil so I followed another user's suggestion and instead of using only two super juicy and unbelievably sweet mangoes, I used three. I placed the chopped mangoes in the blender first, then the yogurt, then the sugar, and finally the ice ( I placed a few cubes). This recipe tastes similar to the Dominican Morir Soniando...but with mangoes and not oranges.

Fresh mangoes made this lassi much tastier than using frozen mango chunks. Plain nonfat greek yogurt did not make the drink too tart, like I thought it might.

Great basic recipe.  My mangos are on the small side this time of year so I used 3.  
I also liked the honey idea so I did half honey, half sugar.

I actually made this with a can of mango puree that I had bought at the local Indian grocery store with the idea of making mango ice-cream, but instead used it in this recipe.  Sooooo easy!  I omitted the sugar since the can of mango puree had sugar in it already.  Tastes just like a fresh restaurant mango lassi!

Delish! I tweaked of course, used this as a base. used frozen mangos, probably a cup of yogurt and Sunny D. 
Whenever I make a smoothie, fruit first, scoop of my yogurt, and then fill it with juice- so the juice covers almost all of the fruit.

Yummy!  I thought it was perfect - maybe a little thick, but I'm sure if I had added more ice or allowed it to melt, it would have been more the consistency I expected. I also used greek yogurt, which probably made it thicker.

Was a little thick, probably due to using a cheaper brand of yogurt, so I added a splash of milk.  Will make this again, and again, and again.  Delicious!

This was delicious! Make sure and use nice ripe mangoes for the best taste. I cut the sugar in half just to save calories - however I think the amount called for wouldn't have been too much at all.

My family has had mango lassi from a couple of different places and this one didn't quite match the flavor, so I'll still be searching for what our expectation is. I enjoyed the drink and it was easy to make.

This was good. I'm not sure what I was expecting as I've never had Lassi before. I actually liked it even better after it sat for a while. I may try vanilla yogurt the next time, as I think the vanilla flavor would work well with the fruit.

Love this recipe!  I used Splenda instead of sugar and it turned out delicious.  Very refreshing and satisfying, a good substitute for ice cream, but much healthier.

I used 3/4 of a large tin of apricots because I didn't have mangoes. I increased the sugar to 3/4 cup because it still tasted too sour and I also added about 1/4 cup of apricot syrup from the tin. Because of all these additions, I had to blend for longer to make sure all the new ingredients were well blended into the mix, especially the sugar. This changed the consistency for the better. I highly recommend blending for 3 times as long as you normally would as the texture became like cold, melted ice cream. This drink is fantastic. My eldest child only gave it 4* because she says the yogurt makes it taste plain and she couldn't taste the fruit - I guess she can really taste the sourness of the yogurt. Delicious.

This mango smoothie was the BEST!!! I had a whole bunch of mangoes that I needed to get rid of so I looked for a good mango recips and this was it. I thought that the amount of sugar was perfect (alothough I have a sweet tooth) so you can add as much/less sugar as you want. PERFECTION!!!!

Delicious! The yogurt made it just the right consistency - I thought I'd need to add milk or some other liquid to help it out a bit, but it came out just right.

This tasted exactly like the mango lassis I've had at Indian restaurants.  I made mine with frozen mangos, which made the lassi thicker and probably less flavorful, but it was still excellent.

Just what the recipe promised - smooth, creamy, and absolutely heavenly! I used strawberries because that's what I had on hand, and it was delicious. Next time I have mangoes around I will try them too.

This recipe is excellent and so easy to make! Just like mango lassi from my favorite Indian restaurant. I followed the directions using plain (unsweetened) yogurt and it was very good. I blended very well to make sure the sugar was completely dissolved. I actually wanted it a bit more complexity in the taste, so I added a teaspoon of honey and a teaspoon of lemon juice to round out the flavor. I will definitely make this again.

This is so yummy!!!  I had to add a little bit of milk to it, so my blender would mix, but otherwise.. YUMMY!!  ALso, note, we did not have plain yogurt so we used vanilla... The slight flavor added and did not seem to subtract...Once again... YUMMY!!!

I used a little less sugar. It doesn't need so much because the mangos are already sweet.

I thought this was fantastic! I used honey instead of sugar, and I like my smoothies thick, so I would add a whole tray of ice cubes at least to offset the large amount of yogourt.

This was so simple!  I used vanilla yogurt instead of the plain yogurt, and only 1/2 the sugar and it still turned out just like a mango lassi from a restaurant. Really fantastic.

This is exactly what I was looking for! I had a version of this at an Indian wedding awhile ago, and have been looking to replicate it ever since. I used a bag of frozen mango (the fresh mangos I bought were rotten inside!) and Stoneyfield yogurt. I had to add a lot of milk to get it to blend at all, I think due to the frozen mango. The 1/2 c. of sugar was perfect for me.

Had no fresh mangos (poor us Winnipegers!) so used 2 cups of mango pulp instead with 2 1/2 cups of strawberry yogurt along with recommended ice. Didn't add sugar at all. Perfect thickness for me but too thick for my Mom. Added more milk to make it thinner, although I liked it the way it was. Thanks for the recipe!

I had the great fortune to go to Mexico, where me and my Dad visited a Mango farm. That part of Mexico happened to be called Nayarit. When I went back home to the US, I was amazed to find a Mango in the grocery store that had a label on it that said from Nayarit! Pretty cool I think. The secret to making a good Lassi is to use the Mango pulp, the mango itself has too much fiber and acid, which can give it an orange juice type of taste and texture.

This was delicious.  I used frozen strawberries, and then added a bit of cardamom for the more Indian feel.    
I'll be making is often in the next week, because a friend of mine accidentally bought me 6 quarts of yogurt (yes six, I had requested one).

I tried it substituting Splenda for the sugar and adding chopped strawberries already sweetened with Splenda (ca. 1/4-1/2 c.); since I love the consistency of the Stonyfield flavored yogurts, I used their fat-free plain yogurt to make this an all-around healthy treat. Both my husband and I thought it turned out absolutely yummy! :)

Wow, this was amazingly good.  My whole family loved it.  Not only did this taste great, but it gives me a huge boost of energy. Would make a great breakfast shake.  Super quick and easy to make too!  This was a little thick for me.  Next time I will thin this by adding a little mango juice or milk. I will also add a little more mango or try adding some strawberries just because I love to experiment.

Very tasty!  Used way less sugar and still enjoyed it a lot.
