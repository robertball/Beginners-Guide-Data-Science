Trust this recipe!  I looked at my 16 oz jar of pepperochini and thought "that just looks ridiculous."  Don't think about it, don't drain it, just add it all in.  In fact, when you buy the italian dressing packet, go for the zesty one.  As recommended, I lightly brushed olive oil on a hard roll and sprinkled with garlic powder before toasting (425 for 8 minutes).  Throw some creamy horseradish on the bun, chop up those pepperochini and toss them on the meat and top with provolone, and you've got a winner!

I cook meat for my family just about every day, but I honestly dont' eat it.(I do taste tho) Nothing political or health related; just don't care for it. However, this dish is one big WOW FACTOR! I kept taking fork fulls all night! I decided to use pork tenderloin with this and it was amazing. It literally melted in your mouth. I like a lot of liquid, so I used the juice from the peppers and used three cans of low sodium beef broth and only a half a packet of the seasoning. (didn't want it to be too salty) Also threw in a sliced onion plus my own seasonings. This is a winner Casey and I thank you for submitting it, but I'm begging you to give it a try with the pork. Thanks again!

Very good and much like "Chicago Italian Beef," but like other reviewers thought it was way too salty.  Will definitely make it again but will use low sodium beef broth and much less salad dressing mix.  I'm assuming the salt content of the salad dressing mix and/or the olives in the pepperoncini might be the culprit.  Will check labels before I make again though.

Everyone liked it and a couple people requested the recipe, but I agree that it's a little too salty.  After making it several more times, I've found that using reduced sodium beef broth makes it much better.

This was really good.  Even better with crusty rolls that have been toasted and brushed with olive oil.  Then load on the meat and cover with mozzarella cheese and broil for a couple of minutes.  My husband raved!  We also topped ours with roasted red peppers and mild banana peppers.  Yum!  Warning:  this makes a LOT of meat.  I used only 3.5 pounds, fed 5 people the first time, made leftovers for 3 tonight and have at least 6 more servings in the freezer.

These were easy to make as I just did mine on top of the stove, however, the salt content has to be reduced. My hands and legs were so swollen after eating. Way too salty. Because of this, I won't be making again.

EXCELLENT! My husbands favorite sandwich is a french dip and he couldn't stop raving when I made these. I didn't add the pepperocini's because I feared the kids reactions and they were still great. I made a butter and garlic spread and toasted it on my roll before adding the beef and it was delicious. Not exactly low sodium, but a great treat. I have a feeling my husband will request this one a lot!

I was skeptical at first when I read people comparing this recipe to Chicago style Italian Beef Sandwiches. This recipe is awesome! it has a great tangy flavor and sooo easy!! Tips: use low salt broth, and I only put half the jar of pepperocini in and that seemed like more than enough.  My husband is picky and he liked it! oh and I'm feeding it to my family from Chicago this weekend!

This was really good, especially if you like spicy hot food. It wasn't clear from the recipe (and one comment confused the issue even more) - do you drain the pepperocini? I did and I think that was right. I also rinsed them to remove some of the salt. I used leftover beef roast that was pretty tough; and I used beef boullion and a couple cups of water instead of canned broth. Cooked on low for 4 hours. Easy to prepare - just throw everything in the crock pot and go to the game or to the movies and you have a ready snack when you return. I will do this again (and again).

My family absolutely loved this recipe!!!! We are from Chicago and Italian Beef is serious business for us! My hubby is very very picky about his beef and this was a major hit! I used a low sodium deli roast beef and low sodium beef broth. It was perfect. It was in the slow cooker longer than an hour. I think about 1 1/2 hours. I also picked up some hot giardiniera to put on our sandwiches. It was yum yum yum!!! It was much less greasy than ordering it from somewhere. This is going to be a staple in our house from now on. So easy to make. It took me less time to put in the cooker than it would have to wait for our sandwiches to be ordered and made!

This is a great recipe. For those of you griping about the salt, just cut it down. You could use low sodium broth if you wanted. I followed the recipe as is and used juice from peppers. (recipe didn't say to drain) and I thought it was FANTASTIC!!. Some people would just gripe if they were hung with a new rope.

I'm giving this 4 stars as is.  I used 'zesty' salad dressing mix, because we like things a bit spicier, also added some thinly sliced onions and a couple of cloves of garlic.  Then it was 5 stars!
This also works well with a pot roast for 6 hours on high or 8 hours on low.

We added less of the actual peppers, but almost all of the juice....and about a tablespoon of Worchestershire sauce. Since we were doubling the recipe, I just used one can of beef broth and one can of water. It still tasted awesome, and wasn't overly salty. The husband was highly impressed, so thank you!

I did change this a little as I found it a little bland, added Parsley, bay leaf, basil, garlic and then sliced onions and Jalapenos for the last hour of cooking.

We love salt even though we shouldn't have it, but we thought the peppers just made it way too salty.
Thought about making it again but without the peppers it's nothing new.  Thanks anyway!

I followed the recipe exactly and it was a huge hit. Even my 8yr old often picky eater LOVED it.. I did serve it on wheat hoagies with melted provolone on top and WOW.. I will be making this often. In the future, I'll cut back on the juice in the peppers (maybe use half a jar instead) and just add extra broth because, I would have liked a tad bit less tang. I can't think of any other improvements because this is a very good recipe especially for the effort.

Really excellent for such a simple dish.  My family isn't really in to spicy so I cut the amount of pepperoncini in half.  I will absolutely make for our next party.

Great! A pound of chuck steak sliced thin, 16 oz. of pepperoncini with 1/2 the juice (I, too, was unsure), 10.5 oz of 50% ls beef broth and .7 Italian dressing seasoning. Cooked in crock pot on low for 4 hours and was done. Lightly buttered two hoagie rolls and broiled til lightly toasted, added a small smear of mayo, the beef mixture, topped with provolone, then broiled until cheese was melted. Got a thumbs up from BF and will definitely make again!

Giving 5 stars for the combination of how little work this takes for a meal that's really, really tasty and versatile.  It can be improved on by adding/changing to your favorite cheese, and serving on toasted rolls brushed with a bit of olive oil.  Nice with a glass o white and a tossed salad for a lighter meal or with a lager or a pilsner and a potato-salad for a heavier meal.

Loved it! What a simple idea. Slap some cheese on there and put it on a toasted bun and yum. Good for lunch the next day too.

This was good, but I think next time I will add a bit more time for cooking the roast beef that way it falls apart a bit more.

Everyone in the family liked it. Hubby said he would only have given it four stars because it didn't have swiss cheese. LOL ;-) I think he was missing the point!

This is a staple in our slow cooker! I toast buns with low fat provolone and it's amazing! It's always pretty runny but I just use a slotted spoon and the flavor is delicious!

This was so simple for a quick, delicious dinner. I have made Italian beef before with beef roast and this recipe rivals it. Very flavorful, quite spicy (we don't mind, my husband is cajun) and delicious.

This is almost the recipe I have been using for years. The thing I do differently is instead of 1 pkg of dry Italian dressing mix, I use 2. Also I don't use the beef broth, I use 2 cups water. I don't think mine is particularly salty. When cooked through I shred the meat and serve on a hoagie bun. Delish!

Really good recipe, and VERY easy. I have made it many, many times, and each time might be a little different--depends on what I have on hand. The one that is NEVER skipped , of course, is the jar of peppers. Works great with sliced beef OR a whole roast that is shredded after cooking. Thanks for this recipe!

I've made this recipe many times and it is wonderful!  It seems to turn out differently each time though (I think it's the beef).  It actually turned out the best when I used a small slow cooker, I was so worried because I was throwing a party and was using my big one for meatballs and my friend brought this tiny crock pot for the Italian beef.  I couldn't believe how great it turned out in that puny (sp?) thing.  I think having everything kind of cramped together helped the beef to really absorb the flavor of the seasoning and the peppers.  (I do add a little bit of the pepper juice each time too.)  Thanks so much for sharing your recipe!

I have had wonderful Italian beef sandwiches in Chicago and was anxious to try to make them at home.  This recipe was a huge disappointment.  They were WAY too salty and had very little other flavor.  I hate to waste food, but I had to throw mine out after a courageous effort to try to eat it all.  My husband did eat his.  Really awful.

I live in chicago and my family loves italian beef!!  This recipe was great.  I added a bay leaf and took out some of the peppers.  I froze leftovers and it reheats even better!  My family recommends to add a slice of cheese to your sandwich too for more ooey-gooeyness!

These are so good! I didn't want to wait for the slow cooker so I just threw everything in a pot on the stove. I used a beef cube and a cup of water since I didn't have beef broth. Just let everything simmer for a bit and it was great!

This will now be a favorite of ours. My daughter and husband do not care for peppercinnis, but being in the slow cooker broke them down enough I could enjoy left over tidbits on my sandwich. The au jus was delicious!! Made slight adjustments, such as using as much peppercinnis I felt were enough from a one gallon jug I always have on hand. I used italian dressing since I always have this on hand also, and I used my bouillon to make a beef broth in a coffee cup for the au jus. Mozzerella cheese and put it in the oven for ten minutes at 400'

It takes sandwich meat and turns it into a restaurant quality meat ... Made Rueben's with the meat instead of corned beef (less calories this way!)

Amazing flavor, and so easy! Put the meat and peppers on French steak rolls and put under the broiler with some provalone. Heavenly!! And my fiancé loved it, too - made it into his top five. I will absolutely be making this again!

I have to agree with Owen when he says " trust this recipe". After reading all the negative comments, I, too, was reluctant to put a whole jar/juices of the pepperoncinis in. I thought it was going to be too spicy(for my husband who doesn't like spice), and too salty.

WELL. His review was the only one I ;istened too, and THANK GOD I did! It was amazing!! My hubs absolutely LOVED it and actually told me to save this recipe. 
(of course I acted like it took all day to cook too;-)  )

I will be making again tonight, and my mouth is watering already thinking about it. Tonight I will be trying it with the Zesty salax dressing mix. Hope it turn out just as good!!

I discovered this recipe a year or so ago, and it has become part of my regular meal rotation. My boyfriend LOVES it. I'd give it five stars except that I've discovered a few changes that for me make it even better. 

I chop an onion in half and add it to the slow cooker along with about 6 peeled garlic cloves. I use about double the broth and about a quarter the amount of pepperoncini, if even that. When it is finished cooking, I strain the liquid and put it in a pot. I boil it to reduce it until there is about 2 or 3 cups of liquid left. This makes the au jus just outstanding.

A secret: I have actually usually made this with pork instead of beef, because pork tends to be cheap where I live and I often buy a large pork loin that I can get 4 or 5 meals out of. It's equally good with either meat.

Toasting the buns in the oven and buttering them is a MUST.

One last tip: I don't like to let this cook too long. I find it much tastier when the meat stays together in slices. If it cooks long enough to be shredded it is too soggy.

I agree with the other posts that this recipe is very salty.  I used half a dressing packet and reduced sodium broth, and it was still slightly too salty for my taste.  My deli has reduced sodium roast beef, if I try to tweak this recipe I'll use that instead.  Also, I purchased higher priced angus roast beef that was rare and tender. Cooking the roast beef made it tougher than when I tasted it right when I brought it home.  Buy the cheapest roast beef for this recipe since it won't make the end result better.

Made this but used chicken breast and low sodium chicken broth.  Served with whole wheat silver dollar rolls from local bakery and had huge hit.  I'll try the pork suggestion and veggie broth next time.

This was really great! I used low sodium beef broth and zesty itallian dressing - I also buttered my bread and used garlic powder and oregano on it - my family LOVED this - only wish it made more -  next time I will either double or triple it - 1 lb of thinly sliced roast beef was barely enough for my 4 person family.

I loved this recipes and I cheated and used deli meat sliced thick.  I'm a girl on a budget!  Added provolone cheese and some crusty toasted bread.  Yum Yum!!!!

This was a pretty good and fairly quick meal. I didn't have quite enough roast beef so I also added some pastrami I had. I used 1 Tablespoon of the 'Italian Dressing Mix' from this site instead of a package mix. I served this on 'Ciabatta Bread' from this site too. It was really good! Thanks for sharing!

Good basic recipe, and super easy.  If you don't happen to have a slow-cooker, this can also be done on the stove....maybe low heat for a little less time.  If you don't have proper Vienna style rolls, bolillos or French/Italian bread will work.  I do think the 6 servings off one pound of beef is more than a little optimistic, though.  I'm just sayin'.

My husband LOVED this! It was so easy and yummy! I melted swiss cheese over it with a little light mayo on the roll. Such a great idea for a easy philly cheese steak sandwhich

This is SO delicious!!  I always have to double the recipe, b/c my husband could eat 4 sandwiches by himself!!  I always use the juice from the pepperoncini's in the mixture.  I serve on French rolls, w/ olive oil & garlic powder.  We also put pepper jack cheese on the bread & put in broiler for 5 min before adding the meat.  DELICIOUS!!  This has become a regular dish in our house!

This was wonderful for sandwiches.  I had italian beef in New Orleans. The Au Jus was great for dipping.  Leftovers made an awesome chilli with addition of Tex-Mex seasonings, especially cumin and smoked papkria.  Will play with this more.

This is incredibly simple and delicious. I did not use an entire jar of peppercinis; I threw a handful in and it was plenty spicy for me.  I now make this at least once a week... my boyfriend and I love it!

I tweak this by using a packet of au jus instead of the beef broth and I add two cups of water.  I also sub roasted red peppers for the pepperoncini.  I also add a sliced onion and serve on toased italian hoagies with shredded Kraft Italian cheese and get raves everytime.

I grew up in Chicago, and this is how a roast beef sandwhich there tastes. I missed having them but now I know how to make my own. Next time I will add  an italian sausage this is called a combo. Thank you so much for letting me show my family what a real Chicago beef sandwhich is.

What can I say that everyone hasn't said already! I don't like salty food, so I used low sodium broth and half the zesty Italian seasonings. I think I will also drain half the juice from the banana peppers next time. Yummy!

I made this for my family last week and it was excellent! I only used the juice from the peppercinis and sliced the peppers for people to use at their leisure. It was so fantastic! Top with a slice of provolone and that is one tasty french dip. I will make again! Thanks.

I have been making a different version of this recipe for a while now but instead of on the stove, I cook in the crock on LOW for 8-10 hours.  Also, add a can of beer!  Serve on toasted french bread with provolone cheese.

I made this on the cooktop instead of a slow cooker with sliced Angus roast beef from the deli. It was surprisingly like the Chicago style Italian beef I grew up with. Now if I could only find the right rolls it would be perfect! (Oh, it was also very easy.)

I made this for my family and 2 other families.  We take turns cooking for each other.  Two of us made this exactly how the recipe reads.  It was too salty.  We told the third family and they cut the Italian packet in half.  She said that it turned out great.  I was just asked to make this recipe again.  I agreed because it is the easiest recipe that I have ever done! Last time I served with hoagie rolls.  One family added lettuce and sliced tomato.

I added all of the juice from the peppers and I think it was too much...it overpowered the taste of the beef.  Very easy to prepare.  I will try it again.

I followed other review suggestions, by adding 2 pkg.'s of Italian dressing mix and beef broth instead of water, and it turned out very well.  Juicy and very tasty!  Thank you for sharing this recipe!  This w.ill be my go-to recipe for Italian Beef

Made this with elk, it was much leaner. I followed other reviewers who said to cut down on the salt. I think I should have made it as outlined as it didn't have enough salt.

My entire family loved this! I used 1 lb of deli roast beef and it was the perfect amount for my family of 4, and we had enough left over for 1 more sandwich. I did use 2 cans of low sodium beef broth. I was hesitant about the pepperoncinis but ended up including a pile of them on my roll with the meat. Delicious!

i would not put the peppercini in next time. I put the whole jar in, liquid and all, and it made the dish taste like vinegar. We did not enjoy this.

I used reduced sodium beef broth which was good.  The pickled pepperoncini juice makes the broth entirely too pickled tasting for a jus to dip it in.  I would definitely recommend draining the  pepperoncinis and maybe adding a few jalapeños for a kick.

This is so good, and who doesn't like to dip a sandwich? Quick and easy and flavorful and delicious.  I served these with roasted garlic and caramelized onions on a toasted roll with melted provolone and horseradish.  Very well liked by all.  I'll be making these often.

I just made this last night. I think my roast beef was almost 3lbs and kept all the same measurements for everything else. I used the WHOLE 16oz can of pepperochini--juice and all. I did 1 cup of no sodium beef broth. I made my own dry italian salad dressing mix (after I realized I had no packets on hand and I had already started this meal, lol). I added an additional 1 tablespoon of parsley. Cooked and shredded in the crockpot. Served with shredded Mozzarella on top and French bread. Oh my gosh!! This was SO GOOD and SO FLAVORFUL!!! My husband loved it too. I will certainly make this again and again! Really simple! We though the spice level was perfect when it was complimented with mozzarella and the bread!

I thought that the roast was a little bland.  I only used 1/2 of the Italian seasoning packet.  I think that next time I'll use the whole packet.  The roast was very tender.

Delicious!  My whole family loved it.  Only I changed a couple things, I cooked it in my slow cooker (on low) for about four hours, I added a package of Au Jus mix, I used the zesty Italian dressing mix and I used Italian roast beef. I served it on hot rolls with Swiss cheese.  YUMMY!  I will definitely make this again.

The only changes I made to this recipe was I used a 12oz jar of peppers and a 16oz can of broth, because those are the sizes I could find. This recipe was delicious! I didn't think it was too salty at all. I will definitely make this again.

I'm rating this three stars instead of five due to a lack of clarification in the directions.  I'm assuming that you drain the pepperocini based on my not doing so the first time.  However, I'm getting the idea that this will be a good recipe when done correctly.  I'll be doing this again.

Delicious!  I was afraid of too much salt based on other reviews so used low sodium beef broth and didn't add quite the full jar of pepperoncini.  The beef was melt in your mouth delicious.  We are cutting carbs, so simply melted a slice of provolone over a scoop of the beef mixture and served with veggies.  Outstanding and scrumptious.

Best Italian beef I've ever had...can't wait to make it again!  Although I could not find a 16oz jar of pepperoncini, the 12oz worked great.  I also added about 1/4 cup water to break up the saltiness.

I made this with some smoked brisket and the recipe for italian dressing mix.  It was perfect.  I added some chili powder and some red pepper.  I also added a fresh jalepeno as well.  It was the beest italian beef I have ever had.

Easy - 5 stars Delicious - 5 stars Family rating - 5 stars  I added a can of beer becasue someone mentioned it. But will most likely leave it out next time. The pepperocini gave it enough tang to throw it over the top. Will definetly be making this one again!

This wasnt my favorite recipe.It was good for a quick meal, but I would like to try it again with a sirloin or other steak in the slow cooker. The roast beef was too thin for my liking.I added onion and garlic to the beef also. I think the Au Jus came out really good.

Excellent!! I used beef stock instead of beef broth- didnt want it too salty.  And only half the pack of Italian dressing.  This is a keeper, I will be making this often.  It's perfect when you are feeding a crowd, no work and its great!

good tip to whoever recommended it, but adding all the juice from the pepperoncini jar gave it a nice spicy bite. I also added a roasted red peppers in the last 5 minutes of boiling and served it over a toasted french bread roll with provolone cheese. yum!

This is such a wonderful twist on the usual pot roast.  I ran out of time and did not slice the roast.  I just put it all in together and cooked it.  What a hit! My boys loved it. Thanks for a winner.

The best for a super quick dinner when we get home late.I just make mine in a pot on the stove. I use a low sodium broth and top with pepper jack cheese    
DELICIOUS!!!

These sandwiches are so good!  I like salty food though so had no problem with the recipe as it was written.  I did take the suggestion of brushing the rolls with olive oil and toasting them under the broiler.  And as the final topper, a piece of melted provolone.  So good.

This was great. We made it a couple of times before we reached the "perfect" stage. We made it in the slow cooker and it required about 50 min. on high. About halfway through we re-tossed the beef and peppers in the crock pot. We also used the Zesty Italian dry dressing. As someone else suggested we also brushed the hogie rolls in olive oil and toasted on our grill.

These were so easy, fast & really good!  I did 1/2 pound of meat, 3 peppers, 1 can of reduced sodium beef broth & little of the Italian salad dressing b/c I was worried about making too spicy.  It really had a KICK to it & was very good!
