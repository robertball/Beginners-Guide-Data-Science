My husband absolutely loved this meal. He couln't get enough of it. The left overs were just as enjoyable. He also loves garlic so I added a few more cloves and also made it with regular white rice instead of instand brown rice. Which I think makes a big difference in the taste and texture. I will definitly be making this recipe again.
