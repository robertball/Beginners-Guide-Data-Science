I was extremely skeptical about doing this but it turned out good. I had already brined my bird so instead of injecting it, I just put the liquid at the bottom of the roasting pan and used it for basting. The one thing I did not like is that it didn't get that dark golden brown look you would get in the stove. What I did love  was that doing it this way freed up my oven for all of the sides that cook at a lot higher temp than you would cook a turkey. Everything was done at exactly the same time which is a huge thumbs up for me. I will definitely do this again but next time I will pull it off the grill a little early and finish it up uncovered in the oven so that I get that nice golden skin.
