FYI to those of you that didn't already know this make sure the fat side of the Brisket is up when cooking helps keep it nice and tender.

My whole family really enjoyed this one.  Next time I will cut the cooking time down about an hour and a half to two hours though.  Although it a little too done for our taste, we still liked it.  My husband said it was actually beter the next day as a sandwich.  I shreaded some of the meat and set it to work with him.  I also used A-1, perhaps next time I will try a different steak sauce too.  All in all though it was a good dinner.

This was a really easy recipe. I used Stubb's sauces(made in Austin, Tx) and my husband absolutely loved it! He keeps asking me when we are going to have that brisket again.

Really good recipe.  I tried A1 sauce with it (along with a drop or two of beer) and it worked well.

Excellant-easy recipe and satisfied 2 transplanted Texans. I marinated for 18 hours, cooked for 6 hours, fall off the bone tender. But, the liquid smoke does create a strong smell. The house smelled like a Texas BBQ all day, and it became quite acrid. Maybe cooking in in spring, summer, fall when the windows can be with open is a good idea. Despite that I would use the recipe again-even in winter

I went to a banquet last night and they served this recipe of Texas Brisket.  On the first bite I was impressed and asked the woman who perpared it where I can find the recipe!  It is amazing and she said it was easy to make.

I made this last night and my children usually do not like briskets, but they ate this up, this will definitely be a keeper.  Also loved the way it smelled cooking.

The key is the marinade soaking into a nice cut of beef.  You want a nice pad of thin fat on top, and a little marble, but not a lot.  It has to sit for 24 hours, and you have to have the fat facing up.  I tried this recipe this week, and it was so tender, no knife was required once it was served.  I cooked it in the foil, in the roasting pan, for 10 hours at 200 degrees, after it had sat in the fridge in the marinade for 24 hours.  We left it in the foil tent for about 15 minutes after that.  Planning required?  Yes, but it was worth it.  

Family verdict?  KEEPER

I used Worcestershire sauce instead of steak sauce and I cooked this in the slow cooker instead of the oven (6 hours on low).  Then I shredded the meat and put it back in the juices for about 10 minutes.  It came out tender and delicious.  My family loved it.  There were no leftovers, so I'm going to make it again tomorrow night and make brisket quesadillas with it.

I made this in the crock pot and the flavor was delicious!  I cooked it about 6 hours and the cut probably needed 8 hours - but it was still very good.

This made a truly tender cut of beef.  I enjoyed it a great deal.  Make sure you seal the tin foil really well, or it drips, and then burns onto the bottom of the oven.  I used a Nesco counter-top cooker, but it was still a huge mess when the mixture leaked out and onto the bottom of the cooker.

We wanted a little carmelized flavoring so we added 1 c. Brown sugar.  It was soft, tender, meat could be pulled apart to be turned into sandwiches if so desired. And cooked it in ints sauce, but wish I had done it on the grill. Will be next time.

This was a HUGE hit.  We messed up and didn't allow enough time so we cooked at higher temp for less time - don't do it!  We will make it again and allow the full cook time... though our meat turned out tough, the flavors were out of this world!
