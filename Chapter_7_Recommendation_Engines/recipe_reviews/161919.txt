This was a hit in our house.  I modified the recipe a little by using a compination of water, apple juice, bbq sauce, and liquid smoke in place of just plain water.  Within minutes of cooking the whole house was filled with a great smell.

This recipe was a hit with my family and I will definitely make it again.  I did customize it slightly.   I didn't have a pork butt roast, but I did have a half dozen very thick pork loin chops from Costco that I used instead.  They shredded easily.  Also, I fried up some onions on the side to add to the shredded pork.  Finally, I added a little bit of Hickory liquid smoke to give it a BBQ like smell / taste.

I love this recipe!  I love cooking with my pressure cooker and am always looking for tasty and quick meals to make.  This one is just about the easiest.  I used Montgomery Inn BBQ sauce and served it up on bun.  I would highly recommend this recipe.

I was pressed for time and didn't put my pork in the slow cooker in the morning, so I used the pressure cooker like this recipe said.  So it turned out okay.  I really appreciated the time guide line so I knew how long to put it in for for the amount of meat I had.  But I must admit some parts (the darker meat) were tender but the whiter portions were cooked, but not fall off the bone tender as with the slow cooker.  It was still okay (especially since it was done in 40 min.), but texture wise, I'd go with the slow cooker if I had to do it again.  But again, if under a time constraint, it's not a bad option.

To add a bit of southern flare, rub the pork with bbq rub of your choice and put  in the oven at 450 for 35 minutes before putting in pressure cooker!  This gives a better color and flavor!

This was a remarkably easy recipe to knock out in no time!  It came out great - our guests even commented on how this was as good as the best slow cooker pork but they have ever had.  

I did change the recipe up a bit.  First, I used a 4lb pork butt, and started by coating it with a traditional dryrub.  I then put the butt onto a foil lined pan (fat cap side up) and cooked at 450 for 45 minutes.  This nicely browned the meat!

Instead of just using water to submerge the meat, I used approximately 70% filtered water & 25% apple juice, & 5% Jack Daniels BBQ Sauce.   

This was my first time ever using a pressure cooker and I am very pleased with this dish overall.

Very good, we made with a 4 pound pork roast, but cooked for 90 minutes. I think another 15 to 20 minutes would have made the white meat fall apart easier, but overall we were very satisfied.

Easy recipe.  I had a 3.7 pound pork butt roast.  I used apple juice rather than water.  I cooked it for 105 minutes.  Meat is very tender, moist, and fell off the bone.  The meat is delicious.  May I add that this was the very first time I ever used my pressure cooker for meat.  It was a great experience for me and is an encouragement to try other cuts of meat.

I'm confused about the necessity of "boiling" the meat.  I've never submerged a roast of any kind in liquid to pressure cook. I use my cooker a lot, too.  Remember (per any manual I've seen) not to fill the cooker more than 2/3 full.  It is a great kitchen tool.

This recipe was delicious. My Family loved it. I added adobo seasoning to the pork, also I love garlic - added much more than recipes says. Once cooked for an hour I pulled the pork that I could and had to put the rest back in the pressure cooker to cook for another hour. When it came out it was absolutely tender. I have a new Pressure cooker and this is the first time cooking the pork butt roast. Gave it a five star cause it was delicious and easy to make.

Fantastic!  This is my first recipe ever with a pressure cooker, and I am very pleased with the results.  I used 5 lbs of sirloin pork tip roast (Costco), cut into chunks, browned in the pressure cooker in a little olive oil, s& p, Creole seasoning, garlic powder. Cooked at the highest pressure for our cooker (it's not marked and I don't have a book) and it was fall-apart gorgeous in 30 minutes.    I didn't want this batch to be smoky, but next time I think I'll add some more garlic and liquid smoke to the water.  Super easy and tasty.  Thanks ANGIEE!

Great recipe and my first time using my new pressure cooker! I modified by using root beer and water. With the pressure cooker, the meat definitely could have cooked for longer than the suggested one hour as it wasn't "fall apart" delicious.

I have a 6 qt. Instant Pot, and I had to cut my 6 lb. pork shoulder in half to make it fit. Changes:
(1.) Sear your meat on all sides, oil and high heat for 2 minutes. Good ventilation or pull your smoke alarm battery.
(2.) Do not use water or fill you IP up to cover the roast. I used a 10 oz. can of Campbell's condensed chicken broth, just enough to stand above the roasting rack, and by the time it was done the IP was 1/3 full of water and fat from the meat. 
(3.) Did my 6 lb. for 90 minutes, it was tender enough to dismantle with forks, but was not fall off the bone, I would do it for a little longer, maybe 105 min.
(4.) Let your IP "naturally release" by letting it cool for 15 minutes before releasing pressure valve.

Great recipe!   Yes, pulled pork is a bit more tender after a few hours in a slow cooker, but for BBQ pork this yummy in only 30ish minutes - this recipe earns all 5 stars.  I mixed together 1/2 cup apple butter with 2 T apple cider vinegar and added it to the water.  So good!

It was an easy and delicious first attempt at pressure cooking.   To those who noted that more time would have helped - note that the instructions say 60 minutes at 15 psi.  If you have a pressure cooker that does not go that high, you'll need to add time.  Less pressure = lower temperature.

I don't usually review a recipe that I change before  first trying it as written. My goal was not the recipe itself, but the procedures. I'm only giving this recipe 3 stars because I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I have an Instant Pot (5 qt.) and no real recipe to use the pressure part of the pot using my tried and perfected slow cooker recipe. My roast was about 3-4 lbs; I put one large sliced onion, putting the slices below and above roast in the pot, adding 5-6 whole cloves and about 3 cups water. I cooked this for 70 minutes on high pressure and released pressure gradually. Drain liquid (reserving 1 cup), onions and cloves and shred meat into bite size pieces. Put shredded meat back into pot with one onion (diced), and desired amount of BBQ sauce (I used about 9+ ounces honey BBQ sauce). Stir pork, onion & BBQ sauce together. I covered and finished this off on the slow cooker setting until the onions where cooked (about 2-3 hours on low). Watch that the sauce doesn't scorch. Add the reserved liquid as needed if your pulled pork looks too dry. Hint: use the BBQ sauce that you or your family likes and use enough to coat the contents well. Since this is BBQ pork, you want to taste the sauce. If you don't like the taste of it, you won't like this recipe.  Also, I only used 2 large sweet onions total. If you are in love with onions, go ahead and add more. I do when the pork roast is larger. 
Serve in burger buns or use sandwich bread and eat with a fork & knife. Enjoy. Sor

Today, I used my PowerPressure XL and put it on at 1:30 pm. I found the taste was at least as good as being smoked and much more convenient. A couple of things, though. I browned it in the XL before adding the liquid.
I used the 75% water 25% Apple Cider for liquid and added a bottle of Honey BBQ sauce.
Because your not supposed to put liquid in above the mark on the pot, it didn't cover the roast. I cooked for 1 hr, released the pressure, turned it over and gave it another 40 minutes (based on other reviews).
It was delicious and easy to shred. The grand kids inhaled their sandwiches! I added a picture of the roast right after removing it next to my XL.

My pressure cooker does not have 15psi as an option.  I set it at 20 psi for 60 minutes and used the pork butt's enclosed seasoning packet. It was totally delish and oh so tender! Thanks for the recipe!
