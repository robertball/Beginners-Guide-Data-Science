Didn't use muffin tins.  Instead used mini loaf pans.  Also added hot sauce to meat mixture.  Without kind of bland.

It turned out great. I couldn't find the pans they asked for. I used small 2x5x2" deep foil pans I found at kroger. I'm not into spicy food so i would cut the taco mix in half next time. It only served 4 people. I put too much cornbread on top so it took 20 min longer. I will put a thin layer on top and just pour the rest into a pan and bake with the tamale pies.

Pretty good, like the cornbread w/it but wasn't high on flavor really just tasted like taco meat with cornbread on top...not a bad meal though :)
