These are DELICIOUS! I made them exactly as the recipe reads. I was hesitant because the recipe calls for a LOT of sugar and a LOT of butter! But it makes a very large batch, great for a holiday gathering. They hold together rather well when cutting, though crumbly and messy when eating them. I accidentally added the cinnamon and nutmeg to the crust mix also but still also added it to the “apple” mixture and it was amazing. I pressed the crust on top but next time I would more so sprinkle it so that it looks more crumby. No one will EVER know that this is not apple! Enjoy!!!
