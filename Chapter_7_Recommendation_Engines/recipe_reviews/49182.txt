I have made this ham 2 times and I will again on Easter. It is absolutely wonderful. My favorite type of ham to use is a Sugardale spiral sliced ham. Best flavor and always super tender and moist. I read most of the reviews and I see that everyone seems to be having the same problem. No ones glaze seems to thicken. I have always made more glaze than called for. I use about half when I first put the ham in the oven. I put the rest in a large pyrex measuring cup and allow to cool on the counter while the ham cooks. It DOES thicken as it sits and cools. And it WILL glaze the ham if you just continue to baste it about every 20-30 minutes. But overall it is an amazing recipe and I had never made a ham before in my life and my first one was the best!

I was looking for something simple and the others were all to much for making a ham for 4. This recipe turned out great and really helpful.

So delicious! Ever since I found this recipe, it is the only ham recipe that I've used. I make the glaze in the microwave, then pour it over the ham in a roasting bag. I then cook per package instructions. So tender and juicy, and the glaze tastes great as a gravy for mashed potatoes or over a ham sandwich maade from leftovers.

Great recipe - I made this glaze for a 10-pound ham and it was perfect.  I scored the ham and added whole cloves for a beautiful presentation.  I received great complements and wouldn't change a thing.

This was sooo good. The only thing I didn't do was put the cloves in there because of my families personal taste. Will be adding this to my list of "Use OVER AND OVER" recipes!!!!!

I made this spiral ham for Christmas using a 10 lb. ham.  I doubled the glaze although I found out afterward I really didn't need to.  I'm sure the glaze as is would have been fabulous but I had to modify it due to ingredients on hand.  I put my pineapple slices and cherries on the ham then poured some of the glaze over all before covering tightly with foil and baking at 250 degrees for 2 hours.  I then raised the oven temperature to 425 and added more glaze and put the ham back in the oven uncovered for another 10 minutes.  It came out moist and delicious.  Best tasting ham I've ever made.  Note:  These are the changes I made in the glaze (which did not thicken like a regular glaze).  I used 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves along with the pineapple juice, brown sugar and honey.  Instead of juiced oranges, I used 1/2 cup full pulp orange juice (which may have been a little too much...I'll try 1/3 cup next time).  Since I still had leftover glaze in my saucepan even after serving it with the sliced ham, I've used the rest as a sweetner for my hot tea and stir it with a cinnamon stick.  It makes a great spiced tea!

A very good recipe..I used crushed pineapples along with the juice to make the glaze. It also made the ham look very nice after it is cooked. The glaze didn't get thick but I basted it often and the ham was very moist. I also added about 1/2 tsp. ground cloves to the glaze.  Excellent meal!

This recipe had everyone wanting seconds. My glaze never thickened that well so I just basted some of it on the ham and it still was full of flavor.
I will continue to make this.

i used a 8.5 lb in bone spiral ham for this. the only thing that  i changed was i put in a half cup more of brown sugar and only used one squeezed orange (which i squeezed on after. i didnt add it to the glaze). i let the glaze sit after i cooked it for about 20-25min. it was as thick as honey! i used half of it and glazed the ham including between the slices. i than covered it with the pinapples and cherries. after that i put the rest of the glaze on it. i left it over night like that in the fridge covered. next day i cooked it for two hours on 300. first hour i cooked it covered in tin foil and the last hour i uncovered it. there were juices on the bottom i periodically (when uncovered) would use and baste it. im a vegetarian so i didnt eat it BUT it smelled awesome looked awesome and there was barley any left! my husband LOVED it!   THANK YOU i will be using this again and again!

This was my first time making a ham for thanksgiving. We had 3 hams at the party and mine was the party favorite! Since I am an inexperienced cook I thought when I first made the glaze that it wasn't thick enough. So I did not use the oranges and let the glaze cool off after heating. Then I used a large oven bag to put a 17 pound spiraled ham in and let the ham marinate over night in the glaze. I did save the left over glaze. Then I poured additional glaze on the ham and heated for the time specified. It browned very nicely! Since I had heated it too early in the day, I had to reheat it in the oven again and I drizzled on more glaze. Everyone was raving about a ham and I thought they were talking about someone else's, but it was mine! People went out of their way to let me know they are hard to please with ham and I made the best ham they ever tasted!

Very easy and a nice flavor.  The leftover glaze was a nice topper for the steamed brocoli and cauliflower I served with the ham.

I'm not a huge fan of ham but I thought I'd give this a try. It seemed simple to make, however, the final product fell short of was I was hoping for.

I had a spiral cut ham, so I did like a couple of the pictures and put pineapple rings in between the slices.  Ended up not needing to use any toothpicks. Incredibly moist and succulent.  The whole family raved about it...the way it smelled, the presentation, the flavor...A home run! This is my new thanksgiving day ham recipe!!!

This is the first time that I have ever had to cook for the holidays.  I made this ham and the crowd was very pleased. I took the advice of an earlier reviewer and let the ham soak in the glaze overnight and also put in less juice than asked for.  It was amazing!

I made this ham for Easter last year and it was a huge hit. I had never made a ham before, and was a little nervous, but this on was so easy and so yummy! I now am in charge of Easter dinner every year from now on!

My Glaze did not thicken on the stove.  I will add flour next time.  Also some extra tips; the first 30mins, make sure to based the ham a couple of times.  I poured some of the the left over pineapple juice and some gingerale on top of the ham.  I had a lot of excess juice on the bottom of the pan put it went great with the glaze.  My ham was full of flavor and very juicy.  Everyone raved how great it was.  Let the ham stand 15 min prior to carving.  For pre-cooked hams it is 15-19mins per pound.  Also, they say to only glaze the ham 30mins prior to taking it out.  My glaze was not thick so I occassionaly based the ham and then the last 30 placed it all on the top of the ham.

Excellent!  Very, very tasty glaze.  It never thickened as per other reviewers comments, so basted the ham every 10-15 minutes.

This was very good, but my glaze didn't thicken up either.  I probably could have tried the cornstarch trick, but was too hungry!  Regardless, it was delicious!  I served this with Diane's Colcannon and steamed broccoli.

I was nervous at first because I didn't think it smelled very good.  Then I took a bite.  This is amazing!!  I have already had requests for it again.  There was none left and my hubby was sad for no leftovers.  I used crushed pineapple and orange juice, and probably more brown sugar than it called for.  YUM-O

I made this at Thanksgiving and my entire family nearly ignored my turkey and ate almost every bite of the 7lb ham! 
 My son called from N.C. begging me to make it at Christmas. The "sauce" in the bottom of the pan makes an excellent dipping sauce too-- it has a tangy, orange peel taste to it. This recipe is AMAZING in every way!!

Great with or without the cloves. My husband isn't a huge fan of them, but I've made it both ways.  Personally like it better with a light brown sugar.  Just so great.  I like to cut up the ham and let it soak in the juices for a second, then eat it.  Also had a larger ham but didn't increase the recipe.  I prefer to use it more for basting purposes only.  Just cooked it for a little under 2 hours.  Very nice recipe thank you.

We are not huge ham fans and we used this glaze on our ham and LOVED it! The only change I made was that I didn't have whole cloves so I used ground cloved and a little bit of cinnamon. So Good!!

This will be my go to recipe for ham from now on. I used a 10-lb spiral-cut ham from Costco.  Added the cloves to glaze mixture to simmer.  Poured the glaze on ham using small cup making sure the glaze got between the slices.  Placed ham in cooking bag and cooked according to directions.

This glaze has the best flavor and I love the way it carmelizes towards the end of baking time.  I don't usually add the orange juice but as a last-minute thing added fruit cocktail juice to it and wow, how yummy!  This is in my cookbook as one of my favorite recipes :)

This recipe has been used in my family for years. I add half cup amaretto and a tsp of cinnamon to the recipe which just makes it a lil bit better.

I was surprised at how good it looked and tasted. I basted it often, and I didn't put pineapple on top. I stuck cloves in the top into the spiral slits, and it looked wonderful and kept the slices held apart so that the glaze went inside as I basted it.

I changed the recipe to what I had on hand but I'm sure as written it's fantastic.  I used orange juice in place of pineapple juice and left out the cloves simply because I don't like them.  The sauce was delicious and is good over whatever veggie you are serving too!

I didn't have any cloves so I left them out and used orange juice instead of orange.  We loved it!!  I'm not much of a ham cooker or eater but I cooked this for something different and it was a hit!!

I didn't like this glaze at all...it wasn't glaze so much as it was juice.  I even added more brown sugar than it called for and it still didn't thicken.  I took another reviewer's advice and let half of it cool while the ham was in the oven and used half right away and basted the ham with the cooled glaze about halfway through.  Someone said it would thicken when cooled, but mine did not.  The cloves were good but the glaze just wasn't thick enough.

This recipe is very good. I wanted to thicken it up so I added some cornstarch as well. But then all of a sudden I had all these clumps so I strained those out and dumped everything in a bowl. Meanwhile I used toothpicks to attach pineapple rings to the outside of the ham. I also dotted with a few cloves. It actually worked perfect cooling in the bowl because the glaze was thicken than last time I made it. It turned out just perfect. I baste every 20 mins and take it out when it reaches 160 degrees.

I was born and raised in the US, moved to australia last year and their hams dont come with those little packs of honey glaze like they do in the states... so christmas came and i had to improvise.. THANK GOD for allrecipes.com and this awesome recipe.... i used this glaze on my christmas ham, my husbands extremely picky brother liked it.. i used it on my easter dinner ham and we had guests over for dinner that night, they had never had glazed ham and they absolutely loved it..  the wife took the recipe home with her.  i used the recipe again tonight except i didnt have pineapple juice this time so i just made it as i normally do minus pineapple juice.. it came out just as good as it does with the pineapple juice... 

excellent glaze... i dont think i will even ever go back to the powder stuff that comes with the hams when i move back home.

I made a ham for Thanksgiving and this recipe seemed simple enough. It took longer than 10 minutes for my glaze to thicken but other than that I followed this recipe to the letter. My husband absolutely LOVED the glaze. He wouldn't even wait for me to properly cut the ham and kept picking pieces off and dipping it in the glaze that collected on the bottom. He begged me to make the glaze again for Christmas so I guess it's a keeper.

Simple, easy ham glaze. I only used 1/2 cup of pineapple juice and no oranges to keep the glaze thicker. We had a small 4 lb ham so it was perfect! Will definitely use again!

We just had this tonite. 1st time cooking a ham and I thought it was very good. Followed directions completely, except for thickening the sauce with some cornstarch. Yes, its sweet but only if you get gobs of sauce otherwise my family liked it and will have again. thank you

My sauce did not thicken either, until it was completely cool.  Next time I would maybe cook it with half the sauce and try to thicken the rest with cornstarch or something and spoon that- when hot and thick- over the ham before serving.  The sauce was good, but with all the rave reviews, was expecting more.

This is my favorite glaze recipe! I didn't use the cloves and I didn't have oranges so I just used some orange juice. I bought a ham for $1.50/ lb and sliced it and glazed it myself. I am pretty sure I saved about $30.00

Made this for Thanksgiving this year and it turned out great.  Everyone loved it.  I used about a 6.5lb unsliced Smithfield ham, since I don't like pre-sliced hams.  The night before I wanted to bake this, I made the glaze.  The only difference I made was to only use 1/2c brown sugar (it was still plenty sweet) and to add some ground cloves to the glaze.  I let it come to a boil, then let it cool completely.  It didn't really thicken very much, but it did taste great.  The next day, I dressed the ham with maraschino cherries and pineapple slices and poured the glaze over everything.  Baked for about 1 1/2 hours.  Turned out perfect.  Everyone loved it.

This tasted great, however 1 hour is too long for the glaze to be in the oven.  It becomes way too dark.  I would recommend cooking the ham by itself for 1/2 hour and pouring the glaze over it for the second half.

I made this for Christmas Eve dinner.  It was okay, but not "great".  Like a lot of other reviewers, my glaze did not thicken up, but that turned out to be for the best.  I think I could have used a lot less juice and it would have been better.  If I make this again, I'll leave out the orange juice - it made the ham taste too "fruity" for my liking.

This was so wonderful! My husband never gets excited about food but he went crazy over this. I didn't use the cloves and I used 1 large can of crushed pineapple in place of the pineapple juice. Since we have a small family I bought ham steaks instead of a whole ham and only baked it for about 30 min. By the looks of this dish people will think you spent a lot of time and effort on it when really it takes no time at all!

The glaze was really good but the only thing I did was to let glaze cook a little more to thicken... I really don't care for cloves so I added sliced pineapple and maraschino cherries on top of the ham and kept basting it and cut the temperature down to 325 and the ham came out perfect..I would be definitely using the recipe again.

Great ham. Not sure I could taste the glaze as there was already one on it. But cooked perfectly.

This was really amazing!  I have always been a honey baked ham kind of girl, but this was so good, and so easy, that I'll never have to buy one of those expensive hams again! 
My sauce glaze didn't thicken too much, but that was fine.  I basted the ham with it several times while it cooked.

I read the reviews first. Then added some white sugar to help it carmalize. I also put crushed pineapple on the ham while it cooked with the cloves . Because I put the glaze on when I put the ham on it did begin to blacken a little on one corner, no big deal because it was on top of the crushed pineapple so I just pushed that part off. The kids were even dipping their turkey in the leftover juices just like Dad.

This was good & easy. I simmered on the stove for a while & it didn't seem to thicken but after I pulled the ham out (basted numerous times in the oven) I put the sauce in a server & it was just the right thickness. I didn't use the cloves & only had OJ so I used about 1/3 of a cup.

I didn't use any cloves, but used clove honey instead.  Used 1/4 cup of OJ instead as well and then kept everything else the same.  My glaze never thickened though and I had it on the stove for quite sometime.  I ended up just pouring a very runny sauce on my ham and glazing every few mins.  Baked for an hour and came out good.  My picky bf loved it.  He is usually doesnt eat the fat on any meat, but he said this was so good, he even started eating the fat on the ham.  Simple ingredients, easy to make.

This recipe was one of the best ham recipes I have ever tried. The ham was so moist and tender. And the flavor the honey and brown sugar glaze added was absolutely perfect. I will use this recipe every time I cook a ham in the future. My family is pretty picky and they just loved this dish. Thanks to the cook that submitted the recipe, it is a winner.

Thanks Mikazuki.  Quick and easy.  Great for sandwiches the next day.  This is a easy fast meal when friends pop in and you need something that never fails. Goes well with sweet potatoes, & a peas/carrot combo.  My wife loved it.

Bake ham at 325 according to package directions. Scored the ham with deep cuts and put the cloves in the cuts - do not need as much as is called for in recipe. Used orange juice - 1/2 cup max GREAT flavor!

I'm a bit late getting this review in, but it's worth writing! I (feistyfella's female half) made this glaze for Thanksgiving, and it was fantastic! This is the best ham glaze I've ever tasted! The only changes I made were to add a bit of fruit...actual crushed pineapple with the juice, plus I added about a cup of cranberries to make it a bit more holiday-ish. I also squeezed juice from an orange and let the pulp mix with the rest of the ingredients. (We love our fruit around here.) This will definitely become a regular for our holiday dinners!

I've made this before but it came out fantastic this time. I had people tell me that this was the best ham they have ever tasted! I think it's because this time I basted it every half hour and covered the ham very lightly with foil so the top wouldn't burn.

This recipe is wonderful. I made this for our Christmas dinner. I had never made a ham until yesterday and was nervous about it. My husband LOVED it and can't wait for me to make it again. We have leftovers and can't wait to eat them for lunch. EDIT: I tried this glaze with pork chops. I made the glaze and then cooked the porkchops with it in the oven. They were REALLY good!! I will def. be making the ham again and the pork chops again!!

I made this ham yesterday for our Christmas dinner and it was unbelievably good.  My glaze never thickened either but I just poured it over my 8.5lb ham and that was it because I totally forgot to baste it while cooking.  It still tasted great.  I also bought a can of sliced pineapples for the juice and pinned the pineapple slices on the ham with toothpicks, so I think that gave it extra flavor as well.  We now have some leftovers for lunch and I can't wait!

This recipe was similar to one I've used for years. If you want to change it up - just add in the saucepan juice from marrachino cherries along with some cherries and chunks of pineapple and serve in a dish with the meal. People love to drizzle it on their ham on their plate while eating.

This is a ham recipe my family has used for three generations. We actually use mustard with the brown sugar rather than honey, but either way is superb! We always do the maraschino cherries in the middle of the pineapple slices and it makes a beautiful presentation. This is just one of those recipes that is worth passing on!

i have made ham glaze many times but this recipe tops them all. I was using a ham slice as i just cook for two so i halved the recipe,(could have quartered it) used 1/4 teas. ground cloves in the glaze instead of whole cloves and i cooked the ham in a baking dish for about an hour. Served with scallopped potatoes and fresh green beans for a delicious sunday dinner.

Delicious ham! It was quite a process for me (because there were no precooked hams at my grocery store), but it turned out great in the end & I actually think it worked out best that way...here's what I did:
I got a 5 lb. sliced (uncooked) ham, so I needed it to be 'precooked' to make this, so...I baked it at 350 for about 3 hours (until the internal temp. was 160). But, before I cooked it, I injected the ham w/ 1 can of Sprite (using my meat injector). I do this w/ all hams & it really helps keep it moist & sweet. Okay, now to cook it here's what I suggest: Line a cookie sheet (one w/ a lip around the edge) with foil then spray the foil w/ cooking spray. Place a cooling rack (the kind you cool cookies on) on top of the cookie sheet, and place the ham on the rack. The cooling rack allows for the juice to drain into the pan & prevents the ham from getting soggy/burnt on the bottom. Now, make a sort of tent over your ham w/ aluminum foil (but try not to have the foil touch the ham if at all possible, if it does it could possibly pull off the yummy outer crust). This 'tent' will help keep the ham from drying out in the oven. Now that my ham was all cooked and 'Sprited-up' I put it in the fridge to make the next night...now I followed this recipe (with my precooked ham...yeah!) I followed the recipe exactly except I used bottled orange juice (1/2 cup because that equals approx. the same as 2 juiced oranges). My sauce never really thickened, but I just injected & poured the juice

I made this for Easter for our family of four.  It was easy to prepare and the presentation was very pretty!  Everyone loved the flavor.

This was a good recipe.  My boyfriend is allergic to fruit so I did not add the pineapples and cherries.  I put a bag of baby carrots in the bottom of my roasting pan and they were so sweet and tender.  I also covered my ham for the first hour of cooking, then uncovered for the second hour and it was very moist.  I had an eleven pound, bone in, fully cooked ham.  I would make this again.

I was out of honey so I substituted 1/2c maple syrup, I used ground cloves and a splash of regular OJ. It liquefied in the bottom of the pan, but it did leave a glaze on top of the ham and it left the ham moist & tasty from sitting in the juices. My picky 2yr old ate 2 slices! I'll try it again & next time use honey, but it turned out fine this way too!

Really made a nice 'crust' on our ham, and it was very moist.  I used ground cloves and a tablespoon of dijon mustard.  Let everything reduce down and then basted the ham on low temp for a couple of hours.  Yummy!

I wasn't too impressed with this recipe. I followed it perfectly but it just didn't glaze like I thought it would. The ham was good but not nearly as good as I had hoped. Thanks anyway.

Like Alethea, my glaze never thickened but I did use Splenda's half and half brown sugar mixture and maybe that had something to do with it. I also didn't stick cloves in the ham, I added half a teaspoon of ground cloves to the glaze. All in all, this smells wonderful and I'm excited about serving my first ham to my husband and kids for Easter.

This was so yummy!!! I made as per instructions and it turned out great.
Next time I might slice the ham and then pour the glaze over and bake it that way. The glaze was so yummy and by slicing the ham up there would be more of it 
So good!!!!

The only downside is my sauce didn't thicken (probably not enough honey, i was low) but no big deal. The ham was SOOO juicy (not a downside). I cooked a 10lb ham instead of 5lb.

LOVED this recipe...it was exactly what I was looking for. The only modification I made was I subbed out the orange juice from fresh oranges & used defrosted orange juice concentrate as we liked a nice tart, fruity flavor.

Excellent! This was my first attempt at cooking a ham by myself... for Christmas where we hosted my in-laws. It received rave reviews, and all of the ham was eaten. I will be using this same recipe every time I make ham!

This was fantastic.  I was scared to make a ham because often I find that they are salty.  Not with this recipe though! Everyone raved about how good it was. My mother said she is not a big fan of ham, but loved it cooked this way.

Wonderful glaze - took me a lot longer than 10 minutes to thicken though.  I added a little bit of marachino cherry juice to the mixture as well, then stuffed the ham with pineapple pieces and cherries before glazing.  My husband says this is the best ham I've ever made. :)

i was feeling extremely brave and decided to try a ham. i've never had  much luck with any meats other than beef so i must have been crazy. but this recipe made me feel like i know what i'm doing in the kitchen!! it was so easy and straight forward. i didn't fresh squeeze the oranges, instead i used orange juice. i just made sure that i basted it every 20 minutes and it came out amazing. my husband loved it so much that we fought over the left overs the rest of that week!! the glaze is great on mashed potatoes

Ok this ham recipe tastes great but I did modify a little because I did not have oranges. I used blood oranges which made my syrup red but very flavourful. Also I baked my ham with the lid on it so my glaze did not reduce in the oven like it was intended to. I had a thin sweet gravy at the end of baking ,but the meat was so tender that way that I think it was a good mistake on my part.

Wow, wow, wow...this was a complete hit!  Just finished making/eating for a wonderful easter dinner!  I made the glaze substituting the fresh juice from the orange with actual oj, maybe 1/4 c. I injected the ham w/ the glaze, while also basting about every 15 minutes.  This turned out fantastic...great recipe :-)

This ham recipe is true a keeper.  I used crushed pineapple and 1/4 cup of the pineapple juice.  I think this is the reason why my glaze got thicker.

I fixed this for Easter dinner and my hubby said this was the best ham he has ever tasted.  I sliced my ham about 30 minutes before it was done and stuck it back in the oven to bake in the juices.  It turned out wonderful!!

I felt this was alright. I would cut down on the amount of cloves in this as I thought they overpowered the taste of the ham.

The glaze was really sweet, but good. I could only find a 6.5 lbs ham. It was definitely not as hot as I wanted after about 1hr 10min.  But I didn't expect it too.  Add more time for larger hams. I followed the glaze recipe very precisely but it never "thickened".  It was pretty decent overall.

This is the best recipe for Honey Baked ham.  It is all natural stuff and your not using the packet that comes with the ham. We use this recipe everytime we make any type of ham.  Thanks you for putting it on the website.

I was out of OJ, so I used Clementine zest, 4 tsp cold water and 1 tsp corn starch as a substitute. I found out too late on New year's eve that the cloves in my spice rack were ground, so a tsp of ground cloves went into the glaze! The results were fantastic!! My husband TOOK the first bites, and the first plate.
Way better than my usual holiday ham.

family really liked it! Didn't know glazed had to sit a while before putting on the ham though, so it was a bit more liquidy than I would have liked. Nonetheless, thanks for the recipe!

Excellent glaze!  Picky eaters loved it.  Used a bit less of the sugar, a bit more of the honey.  Would add more orange juice next time.

My family loved this! This was the best ham we ever had! The things I done differently was I left the cloves out and I used the single serving cans of dole pineapple/orange juice. I used 3/4 of the can mixed with honey on brown sugar heated it in microwave to melt sugar and mixed it then set in fridge overnight. I took the 1/4 can of leftover juice and another can and poured on my ham and half of the glaze and tied roasting bag when ham was finished I poured remaining glaze and cooked hame 20 minuets uncovered. Putting glaze in fridge overnight made it thicker

I've used this simple recipe for years, with exception to the oranges. Oranges just seem to be to much and ruins the the flavor. I've added oranges several time  experimenting with the amount and type of orange. Everyone including myself when ive done it that way agrees tha it just messes up the flavor.
Besides that it's the best way to do a ham. With it even if you use a cheaper ham it sets it over the top.

Great recipe!  I've made this twice but didn't use the cloves the second time per my family's request.  I also switched out the oranges for tangerines and used clove honey.  I'll definitely be making this every Christmas going forward.

01/01/16 - Yum!! Substituted puréed fresh pineapple for the pineapple juice. Have it extra 'sticking' power when I poured it over the ham. Very successful centerpiece for our New Year's Day dinner.

Delicious, my family loved it! My boyfriend doesn't usually eat ham and he tried it and like it also! I followed the recipe, I added a little cherry juice to the mix. I think I should have simmered my sauce a bit longer because it was still runny, but that was my fault and still tasted great! Ill use it again for sure!

This is a really solid recipe that comes together exactly as described. I did everything except add the cloves, which worked out fine. Instead I added sliced pineapple and scored the ham, basting it with the glaze every 20 minutes or so. (Like others who have commented, my glaze never fully thickened. It tasted fine though, and there was a good bit left over.) Everyone loved this ham recipe, and it will definitely be made again.

I made this glaze for my easter ham and everyone raved about the ham.  It was the best ham I have ever eaten.  I did the recipe alittle different.  I followed the cooking instructions on the ham.  I remomved the ham 20 min, before cooking time was over and placed the glaze.  When I removed the ham from the roast dish and placed it into the plater, I pour all of the dripping over the ham and in beteen the slices.  DELICIOUS!!!!!

I made this recipe for Easter dinner and everyone raved about it. I used a 12 lb. spiral sliced ham and made 1 1/2 times the glaze recipe. The additional 1/2 wasn't necessary. I did keep about 1/3 back to baste the ham as it cooked. I used the new glaze the first two times that I basted, then used the drippings the rest of the time. I basted about every 20 minutes. My boyfriend and I do not usually like ham, but this was, in my boyfriends words "the very best ham" we had ever tasted! I also used about 15 pineapple slices and marachino cherries. Beautiful presentation. The kids loved eating the baked fruit (I didn't expect that). I will use this recipe every time! Very easy, simple ingredients. The glaze did not set up for me, but that didn't matter. Because I used a spiral ham, the flavor went throughout the ham. Excellent!

I fixed this on Thanksgiving to go along with our turkey. It was ok. My guests enjoyed it more than I did. The sauce never thickened, so there was not a good, "glazy" coating on the ham. I let the ham marinade in the sauce overnight, so the flavor had plenty of time to settle in, but the flavor wasn't very bold. I also basted it while it cooked. Next time, I'll double everything but the juice, and see if that thickens it up.
