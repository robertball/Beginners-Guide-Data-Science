I don't usually care for sugar cookies, but I volunteered to bake 6 doz. for an event at my son's school.  I tried 2 different recipes, and this one was awesome!  I like nutmeg, so the flavor was perfect for me.  If nutmeg isn't your thing, try substituting 2 tsp. of lemon, lime, or orange zest.  Also, I added 3T of sour cream with the butter.  It makes for very tender pastry.  Since it's a fairly soft dough, chill as long as possible (I did overnight) so that you have to use a min. amount of flour for rolling.  Better yet, roll between 2 sheets of waxed paper, remove the top sheet, cut the shapes without removing them, and put the whole thing in the freezer for a few minutes to get them good and stiff again.  They will pop out easily and the scraps can be re-rolled over and over since no flour was added in rolling.

I am a caterer and was comissioned to do a southern ladies tea. The main request was for teacakes which I have never made but tasted a few times. This was the first recipe I came across and tried it today, the cookies are crisp on the outside and soft and chewy inside with a perfect amount of nutmeg. Just lovely.

This recipe took me back to when I was a little girl growing up in Forrest City, Arkansas.  Ms. Lucy (a grandma figure) used to baby sit me and she made tea cakes that looked and tasted JUST LIKE these! I am almost 50 years old and I've tried many tea cake recipes trying to recapture the taste and texture of Ms. Lucy's tea cakes.  Until now, I was unsuccessful.  These cookies are absolutely delicious!!!!  Not only are they delicious, but I get to savor wonderful memories of Ms. Lucy reaching into airtight plastic container (an empty lard bucket LOL) and saying, "Sweetie, would you like a tea cake?"  :).  Many thanks to the person who shared this wonderful recipe.

I was afraid to try to knead this dough so I just put it in the fridge to chill. I could only wait about 5 minutes because I was so anxious to bake some. OMG I ended up eating the whole pan of cookies, again! I really can't taste the nutmeg but the cookies are fantastic. As usual I baked them on parchment paper and they were perfect. Light brown on the bottom and oh so tasty. Love, love, love these.

I am 62 year old and I've been looking for tis recipes for years.  My father used to bake these and they were to die for.  (my father was from Mississippi and loved to bake) Through the years I've been searching for this recipes and never found it.  Then one day I decided to try again and that's when I hit "pay dirt" I ran across this one!  Honey, honey when I read the ingredients I knew this was "the" one I had been searching for.  As stated they taste even better a day or two later.  I made two batches for Christmas and my daughters' friends came over and had never had the honour of tasting tea cakes.  I don't have to tell you the results.  This has been a  big hit and also introducing the younger generations to a little of their history to them.  Baking from scratch is almost a dying issue - but thanks to recipes like this one - there is hope.  I was sooooo excited to find this I called my brother (who also loves to cook and bake) and we both were jumping on the outside as well as on the inside.  The key to this  recipe is the NUTMEG!  That's what makes the unique flavoring.  For those of you who are thinking of trying it- you won't go wrong!  So for all of you ladies (oooops sorry- gentlemen who love to cook/bake) add this to your recipe box. Like others - make more than one batch (freeze in seperate bags) so when the urge hits, you can  have a fresh batch of "cookies"  anytime.   I have a taste for some  right now and I have all of the ingredients.  I feel a bake on. :)

These cookies are good . . . but ONLY if they are SOFT.  Be sure to cook them only 8 min.  They will continue baking as they are cooling on the cookie sheet. Another tip:  I used Almond Extract instead of Vanilla (richer flavor).

I've noticed that people are complaining that this is a very bland sugar cookie.  The thing is, tea cakes are NOT necessarily sugar cookies.  Sugar cookies are meant to be iced and eaten alone, tea cakes like this are meant to be dipped in tea or coffee.  While the people I gave this as gifts to said they loved these just plain, they enjoyed them far more once dipped in tea or coffee.  These cookies absorb most of their flavor from what they're dipped in, so keep that in mind when you make these.

This recipe didn't taste like tea cakes to me, they tasted alot like flour.  They also had an unpleasant texture, harder than most store bought cookies.  No one would eat them after the first bite.  I may have done something wrong but not sure what, I followed the recipe I cut from a roll instead of from cookie cutter.

If this recipe is better after a couple days, be prepared to die with a smile. They are sinsational right of the cooling rack. I suggest using fresh ground nutmeg for that special mmm! I don`t think I`ll risk their getting better:)

The dough was crumbly at first which freaked me out, but once it was refrigerated it became firmer. Great cookies but don't let them overcook
or they will break your teeth! ;}

I just made these tonight and they were so good. I've never had tea cakes before and since moving to Georgia, I keep hearing people talk about them. So I decided to try them and I'm so glad I did. I didn't have a cookie cutter so I cut them with a glass. They came out in PERFECT circles. I cut them a tad bit thicker than the recipe called for since I wanted them softer. All the people that wrote negative reviews did not do the recipe right. How could you not like these?! YUM YUM YUM

I LOVE THESE OLD SOUTHERN DESSERTS. THEY BRING THE KID IN ME AND GOOD OLE MEMORIES. A TIP FOR THESE IS TO MAKE A COUPLE OF BATCHES AT A TIME AND FREEZE THEM.THEY WILL BE JUST IF YOU JUST BAKED THEM WHEN YOUR READY TO EAT THEM. I'M SINGLE AND THIS WAY IT SAVES ME TIME AND I STILL GET TO EAT HOME BAKED TEA CAKES

These were great!! My husband said they tasted just like his grandmother use to make and mine as well.  I had a little trouble getting them to get done, I was afraid of them burning per the other reviews saying they would "break your teeth" if overcooked. Mine may have been a little too thick, but I took them out when they got light brown on the bottom They were still chewy in the middle this morning!! Great recipe.

This is the recipe I have been looking for for 50 years.  My grandmother used to make these when I was growing up, except during WWII she used lard instead of butter.  I had forgoten the recipe and as soon as I saw this I know it was the one.  Thanks a million.

Thank you for uploading this recipe.  I have been searching for one that taste like the tea cakes my grandmother used to make.  This is the only one that suffice.  Many of the other recipes I found contained too many ingredients.    
Although I was a child, I know my grandmother didn't use a slue of things, just simple everyday ingredients that were in her cabinets and refrigerator.    I found the recipe last night and made the tea cakes/cookies today.  They are wonderful.  Filled with the aroma and taste of a rural southern childhood of long ago.  I can't wait to send a batch to my siblings to get their reactions.    The only problem I had was working with the dough.  I'm not an expert on using a rolling pin.  So, after allowing it to harden in the refrigerator, I just handled them as I would a cookie dough.  I scooped a bit up in a ball and hand shaped them.   What is funny is that the end results were all shapes and sizes, exactly like my nanna's.  I guess she had a trouble working with her dough as well.  Once again thank you, of all the recipes that I have found on this site.  This is the one that is most dear.

These tasted absolutely fabulous!  I wasn't able to use a very intricate cookie-cutter, due to the softness of the dough, but my teacakes were very impressive, on taste alone!  I scaled the recipe to make 5 dozen, and used almond extract instead of vanilla.  I passed them out to the other tennants of my 10-story office building as a halloween treat, and to introduce myself as their new neighbor.  I'm positive I made a great first impression!  BRAVO!

Just what I was searching for!  To those who have had rolling pin issues, try this.  Rather than rolling outward, which will often cause your dough to crack, roll along the edges, more TOWARD the center than away from it.  It is the weight of the rolling pin that thins the dough.  Rolling along the edges, inward is less likely to tear your dough.  Also, while this type of dough needs to be chilled before rolling, it cannot be TOO cold or, again, it will tear.  Persuade your dough with the rolling pin.  No fear.

This is a good tea cake! I doubled the baking time and the bottoms were barely brown. (They didn't turn into rocks as I feared from some of the other reviews.) I used fresh ground nutmeg, and the hint of flavor is perfect. I might be brave enough to share the next batch with the ladies at church.

I am a 13 year old who loves to try new things. I wanted to have a tea party with my 2 little sisters so I tried these. The flavor was GREAT! I did use almond extract as its flavor is more stronger and It is my favorite flavoring. They had a great texture and were crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside! great recipe! I would diffinatly make again!

Wow!!! My nieces and I were having a tea party, but the cakes were so good my nephews said they would join if they could have some. We did not have any leftovers. I also put a small amount of chocolate chips in them per request.

These are simply and delicious. I add about 1 teaspoon of vanilla to mine.  The dough is easy to work with.  I make up a batch and only bake a few and refrigerate the dough. When I feel like tea I just pop a few more in the oven for fresh cookies.

WOW SO DELICIOUS!!!! I made these with my son, 21 months old.  The dough sat in the fridge for almost 3 days (was a few busy days!) and it still worked great! Rolled our dough a little thinner (every one was different, due to my son!) and some thicker, made a total of 55 cookies! Very forgiving recipe, and worked GREAT!! My husband and his buddies called these Manna (food from Heaven)! =) Also topped some with the frosting from 'Delilah's Frosted Cut-out Sugar Cookies' recipe from here, and they turned out great!! Will DEFINITELY make again! My favorite!!

Honestly, I try not to leave bad reviews when my dislike is based on a difference in taste, but I did not care for this recipe at all. I was shocked with the results after all the glowing reviews. I followed the recipe to the letter and my result was a cookie that puffed after 5 minutes and ended flat, but fully cooked, after 8 min the oven. They had an odd overly egg-y flavor and an undesirable texture. I'm guessing, based on reviews, this is the type of cookie that awakens nostalgia rather than tastebuds. If you didnt grow up with your grandma baking this cookie, try a different recipe. I hate to waste so the only thing I can think to do with the rest of this dough is use it as a shell for a tart or a nutbar.

This recipe is amazing! I love tea cakes and this recipe doesn't need any altering. The nutmeg was perfect. I have so much dough leftover, I put the remaining in the fridge and bake as desired. I don't use a cookie cutter either I rolled it into a 1in ball using my hands and flatten it out on the cookie sheet. Came out great! I will be baking these for work tomorrow, can't wait! Awesome just awesome! If you never tried tea cakes this is the one to try.

Sorry, but these tasted like an eggy sugar cookie to me that was also too sugary. However, I divided the dough & added 1 teaspoon each of lemon zest & flavoring & that half was pretty good, but I don't think I'll save the recipe to make again.

These turned out really well. I made them at work so did not have real butter and then I found out there was no nutmeg so I substituted cinnamon. Next time I will use nutmeg!  I mixed up the dough, doubling the recipe, and put it in the cooler til the next day.  I did not roll out the dough, I used a small scooper and then just flattened out the ball of dough on the pan with my palm (wearing plastic gloves) they baked up well and everyone enjoyed them. Nice chewy cookie when you want something not so rich.

My first batch of these, baked for 13 minutes and cooled on the pan for 5 were still a little undercooked.  I had followed the advice on rolling them out without extra flour, and I think they were a little too wet.  My second batch, I forgot were in the oven and ended up cooking for about 25 minutes.  I just took them off the pan immediately and they were perfect.  Whatever the case with the baking time, though, the result is quite tasty, with a delicate sweet flavor, and a nice soft and slightly chewy texture.

I hate to spoil the great rating, but these are not quite the same taste as the elders in my family.  The amount of nutmeg was only a hint and it leaves this tasting like a great butter cookie.  Our family's recipe is more like a mini cookie cake.  I wasn't sure how long to keep the dough refrigerated and after a few hours it was too hard to roll.  After sitting out for 30 minutes it was ready.  Keep the flour handy as you'll have to keep flouring your board and rolling pin unless you use wax paper on top and beneath the dough.  This is great tasting dough and I think I preferred that over the actual cookie.   Unfortunately, I'll have to keep searching for authentic tea cakes instead of these "cookies."

These are wonderful! I used this recipe for Christmas cookies, & they were delicious. I really love the nutmeg.  The dough is a little sticky, so be sure to refridgerate it & don't overcook.

I had to search around to find a recipe close to what I remember my mom making.  This one was close and the first time I made it; I knew it was missing something...lemon extract.  So, I included all the ingredients but made a slight  change to a couple of the ingredients - 1 TSP Ground Nutmeg, 1/2 TSP Vanilla Extract and 1/2 TSP Lemon Extract.  By adding more nutmeg and including the lemon extract in the calculation with the vanilla extract and based on my oven I changed the temperature to 350 degrees and it takes 18-20 minutes per batch to cook.  I make sure the edges are slightly brown and then I take them out.  Because the cookie cutters are so large today, I took a stemmed wine glass and used it as my cutter, making sure that I dip it in loose flour to avoid the dough sticking to the glass.  This made a batch of 40 nice size cookies but, not oversized. 

Both of my sons confirms...They are just like the ones my mother used to make.  My youngest son (now 29 years old) is the reason I went on the hunt for this recipe because he talked about how my mom would make special batches just for him...so I had to find this recipe.  Thank you RGA

This is a good base recipe. I thought it was missing  something, so I sprinkled the top of my dough with a little bit of cinnamon, and it was much better. This recipe is good for beginners, and the more you make it, the more changes you can make to get it to reach your own personal standards.

I stepped up to the challenge to make tea cakes for my husband that would be as good as his ex mother in law's were, fully expecting my first few attempts to fail. I looked at a few recipes and decided to try this one. He says I nailed it!! Thank you! They are perfect!

I normally don't make cut-out cookies, because I hadn't found a recipe for sugar cookies that I liked.  For Valentine's day I wanted to do something different for my husband.  I chose this recipe because of the added flavor of the nutmeg and iced the cookies with a buttercream icing.  The cookies were a hit as soon as they were through--and they just got better!!

I made these after trying a similar cookie at a bakery in Lake Charles, LA. This recipe is fantastic. The cookies are chewy and a great texture, even days later. They look plain, but taste anything but plain. I made them exactly as described in the recipe.

I am not a nutmeg fan. In fact, I often say it is my arch-nemesis, but I wanted something different and was willing to give these a shot. Holy moly. These cookies are absolutely incredible! Crispy on the edges and soft on the inside - so soft they literally melt! The flavor was absolutely amazing - I think I'm a nutmeg convert! These are my new favorite cookies.

Greetings, I would have given this recipe 3 and a 1/2 stars but I don't have a problem with 4, because this is a very close copy to what my Grandma used to make.

The tea cakes are kind of sugary, but they are good.  

I would add at least a cup of flour to the mix and then the flour to keep the dough from being too sticky.  For the amount of sugar, it needs more flour.

Instead of the nutmeg, I used an 1/8th tsp of cinnamon because nutmeg can be kind of strong.

Overall, this is a good recipe.  I wouldn't even say this is a good starter because the tea cake are very good.  I' just going from the ones my grandma used to make, that is all

Thanks for posting this recipe, I will pass it on to all who say they like it.  a1

This is the teacake recipe my mother made. She got it from her grandmother, who was born before the turn-of-the-last-century! I've wondered for years if great-grandma made it up herself. I see not.

When had with a good tea, both are better.

In mid-winter, we are finding that we need to go to 13 minutes.  Gave them as gifts.

This recipe is amazing. I used almond extract instead of vanilla because I like the flavor of the almond better. I also decided not to knead the dough. Instead, I chilled for about half an hour, rolled into balls, then rolled the balls around in some confectioner sugar. They turned out perfect. My kids and husband gobbled up the entire batch.

Flavor is great, I substituted vanilla extract for almond and I cut it from a roll, not with cookie cutters. Only flaw I had with this recipe is I cooked my first batch at 325 for 8 minutes and some in the middle were still half raw. Cooked the second batch for 10 and they still seem under-done. It's probably just my oven, so I still give this recipe a high rating for taste!

These cookies were delicious. I really don’t know how tea cookies are supposed to taste  but these were very close to sugar cookies.   I put the dough in the refrigerator for a little over an hour before baking.  Next time I will put them in the freezer for at least 30 minutes before baking. These cookies were soft and chewy.  I will definitely make these again and again.  Since I didn’t have a cookie cutter, I used a wine glass to make the cookies.

These tea cakes are delicious. I followed the recipe exactly. Some say sugar cookies  so say tea cakes  either way they’re good. I had to cook them a little long than 10 minutes and they were still soft..

My mother has made teacakes for decades and my siblings and I fight over our share of them (as well as her sweet potato pies).  She doesn't actually have a recipe and doesn't bake much anymore, so I thought I'd try this recipe to see how it stacks up.

In my family's experienced opinion (lol) a teacake should be buttery, not overly sweet, and the nutmeg flavor should be evident.  This recipe makes a really good butter cookie, sweet with a great texture, but not so much of a teacake.  

I used a little less sugar than the recipe called for and added nutmeg, but still tastes mostly like a butter cookie.  I also made a lemon glaze for some of them (lemon juice and powdered sugar) to kick them up a notch.  Hubby likes those.  

4 stars for a good butter cookie!

This is almost the exact recipe that my great- great- grandmother used..late 1800's.  (hers did not call for nutmeg.  I tried it  and loved it! Thought it was a great addition)  Thanks!!!!
She would also use either lemon or almond extract to change things up a bit.

if you are looking for a southern teacake recipe with a different texture from a typical cookie with only a light sweetness, then this recipe is not what you are looking for.  It was too sweet for me as a teacake.  As a sugar cookie, it tastes fine.

This recipe was O.K. They tasted more like sugar cookies than tea cakes. There is nothing like good moist tea cake that has been sitting in a plastic bag for a day or two. I don't think I would use this recipe again. IF, and only IF I make these tea cakes again, I would use less flour and add either lemon juice or lemon extract in the place of vanilla. I am from the South, and these tea cakes aren't something that you would normally find but they are not bad. Southern tea cakes are really moist and when you bite into it you can taste the moist lemon and vanilla flavors. I also feel there wasn't enough nutmeg in it. But that's pretty much it.
