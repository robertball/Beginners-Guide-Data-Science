You MUST add water to the cream of chicken soup, mayonnaise and lemon juice mixture before poring it over the chicken and asparagus.  The asparagus creates a liquid at the bottom of the baking dish during cooking so in order to make the dish edible, I had remove the chicken (scraping off most of the thick soup mixture and melted cheese) and asparagus from the baking dish before stirring in enough hot water to make a sauce.

I made this last night - appreciated the ease, and the sauce was good, but next time I will definitely bake the asparagus in a separate dish!  Asparagus needs to be bright green and crispy!

My husband and I loved this! I used reduced fat cream of chicken, mayo and cheese to lighten it up a bit and it was delicious! So creamy!

9X9 dish is too small for this recipe.  too much juice from the asparagus formed while cooking making the sauce watery in spots. Chicken was too dry after cooking twice.   Would not make again.

Made this tonight for my son and husband. The reason for 4 and not 5 is that they felt smaller pieces of chicken would be better. Either way it was tasty and very easy to make. Will make this again, especially since we have asparagus in the garden and continue to look for good recipes for asparagus.

Cooked this for dinner tonight and my whole family loved it.  The only things I did different was add a soup can of water to the liquid mix before pouring over the chicken.  Instead of using fresh asparagus, I used the frozen steam in a bag asparagus, microwaved it first and added it at the same time I added the cheese, cooked 5 more minutes in the oven. Deliscious!!

I read the reviews first, and as a result, opted to steam the asparagus separately, and didn’t sauté the chicken. Note - for extra creaminess, I added 1/4 cup sour cream to sauce mixture, and poured it over uncooked chicken cutlets. I covered with foil, and baked for 35 min. Added my steamed asparagus on top of the cooked chicken, and ladled some of the sauce from the chicken on top, covering with cheese, and putting the foil back on to sit for 5 min.  It turned out great!  I only gave it 4 stars because I had to vary from the recipe steps so much. The sauce is fantastic, and tasted terrific over rice too.

I didn’t have lemon juice so I used some white wine vinegar. It came out great!  We served it over some diced cauliflower. One of the better low carb meals I’ve had in a long time.
