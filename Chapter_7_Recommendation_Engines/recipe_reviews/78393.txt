Of all the turkeys I have ever eaten all over the world, this is a wonderful recipe!  From the juices to the nuts in the stuffing, the brandy and all, this is the best I have ever had!  I can not recommend it enough!  

The next time Ms. Karagouni makes her turkey, I wish she would post the picture of her creation here so all of you could see what a truly appetizing turkey it is and with her stuffing.  

It still could not begin to describe how fantastic it truly tastes!  BRAVO to a great recipe  5 stars plus

I made this stuffing recipe this year to impress my Greek inlaws since this was the first time they came to my house for Thanksgiving in 22 years!  They loved it!  The only change I made was adding a dash of cinnamon because I always remember my mother in law's stuffing having a hint of cinnamon.  I thought it was a nice addition.

I tried the recipe and the turkey tasted great. Brushing it often while cooking with butter and juice mixture, added a nice golden color. The stuffing also was extremely tasteful.I'm going to make it again.

I have been looking for a recipe that is comparable to what my mom used to make.  She passed away many years ago but was a fabulous cook. Most of her recipes are written in greek so it is hard for me to follow, so I came here looking for help.  Boy did I find it.  This is exactly what she used to make.  It is wonderfully flavorful and absolutely delicious.  Thank you so much for sharing this!!

This is a succulent dish which is also surprisingly easy to fix. The tangerine, lemon and orange give it an extra zest.

This was really wonderful. The stuffing was excellent. The turkey, to me, was just like any other turkey, but adding the chestnut stuffing made this a definite 4 out of 5.  Yum

Absolutely delicious! This was the centerpiece of our Thanksgiving Feast and is our new favorite. I used an oven bag for baking, so I did not baste but it turned our flavorful and juicy, The stuffing is unique and flavorful, too.

The turkey was lovely and tender but in general, we were really disappointed with the dish as a whole.  We were expecting something bursting with citrus flavor and rich mediterranean flavor.  The stuffing was not only bland, but with the cost of pine nuts and chestnuts, cost over $25 to make!  

We added more raisins and citrus in an attempt to salvage but it didn't do much to help.  The stuffing mixture might be a nice start to a casserole but just didn't have bold enough flavors as was.  Thankfully we also made a traditional cornbread and cranberry dressing.  Disappointing.  :(

I followed this recipe with one modification - I added some fresh and dried herbs to give the stuffing a bit more flavour. Beyond that, I followed the recipe and it turned out very nicely.

I made this and my family really liked it. Next time I will make the stuffing  - which is really good - but I will not cook it in the bird. It lost some of it's flavor  after being cooked in the turkey and it takes too long to cook the turkey. I always cook the turkey up side down for at least half the time and then turn it around so that the breast meat stays moist. Overall great recipe!

I only made the stuffing seasoned my own turkey breast.

Absolutely delicious. My grandma would make it a little different but I wasn't able to get her recipe. She loved my version. Will save for another time
