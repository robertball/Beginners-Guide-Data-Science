This is the BEST pasta recipe I have ever tried.  My wife and I made pleasure noises throughout the meal. I left out the red pepper flakes.  I added 4 ounces of sauted Portabellas, 2 medium zucchini julienned, and 3/4 jar of sliced marinated roasted peppers with garlic. I stirred the Feta into the hot pasta and got it mixed and melted before adding the other ingredients.

This is very similar to Macaroni Grill's Farfalle Renaldo, which hasn't been on the menu in years, and which I miss terribly.  I made this with kalamata (Greek) olives, in order to attempt to duplicate the Grill's version, and it was pretty darn close!  I normally, er, mess with recipes a great deal, adding extra seasonings, etc., but I didn't add anything to this, except some saut√©ed baby portabella mushrooms that I needed to get rid of.  This was very fast and simple to make, and quite delicious - even vegetarian.  My (carnivore) husband raved!

I worked in a restaurant that served a variation of this recipe.  We used Kalamata Olives and capers.  Then topped with fresh shredded Parimigianno Regianno.  This recipe is the closest I have see to the restaurants Sicilian Pasta.  Will make again

WOW!! A resounding 5-stars for this recipe! I was afraid that there weren't enough ingredients in this when I first read it. But when I made it, the taste was incredible! Everybody loved it and asked for seconds. It's a great plate of pasta, especially when washed down with some good wine!

Absolutely delicious! It even reheats great for left overs! Light, flavorful and filling all at the same time. Substituted parmesean for feta and it was great. Will definitely make time and time again.

thanks for the great recipe

It's amazing how few ingredients can make such a fantastic dish.  This is quick, and very tasty.  We like things spicy spicy, so we always add double the red pepper flakes and add some parmesan cheese- at least a weekly menu item in our house!

Mmmm... this has an intense flavor that was really delicious.  I splurged on the gourmet olives from the supermarket olive bar, which I will do again the next time I make this - which will definitely be soon!

I use this site daily and never comment. I like to try a new recipe every week. My husband also likes to eat a meatless meal once a week. I am always searching for yummy meatless recipes. This hit it on the nose. This dish is so simple and fabulous! I added mushrooms and fresh parmisan cheese. I skipped the feta as I think feta is flavorless. I also skipped the red pepper flakes. I added kalmata olives instead of black. This dish is beautiful and so yummy! I ate the leftovers for 3 straight days. Serve this dish with a salad and bread and you have one great meal! It is a new staple in our house.

I enjoyed this dish, having left out the sun-dried tomatoes as I don't care for them.  In the future I would include fresh tomatoes and substitute kalamata olives for black olives, which didn't really mesh with the dish.

Fantastic! I've made this recipe with pasta or whole wheat orzo, and both with and without the feta - the feta is wonderful but it comes out great even without! Don't leave out the pine nutz...

This is a fantastic, not to mention easy, recipe!  We leave the olives out as we don't care for them but other than that we follow to a 't' without disappointment!

This dish was delicious. I cut back on red pepper and added fresh spinach. Other than that made it according to recipie. The red and green made it a very attractive dish. might keep it in mind for a Christmas dish. Will make again!

This has got to be the best pasta salad I have ever made.  I use quinoa pasta because it is gluten free and healthier.  There are so many variations one can do with this salad.  I have been making this at least once a week.  Yum :)

LOVED the flavors! However, I found it a tad dry even though I used less pasta than called for AND used sun-dried tomatoes that come in a jar infused with oil and herbs. I imagine that if you use the dry sun-dried tomatoes the dish would be even drier. Anyways, this was super quick to make and very delicious (and pretty on the plate). I wanted to make it more full filling so I cooked a chicken breast on the skillet with only salt and pepper and sliced it thin over the served pasta. The chicken made it feel more like an entree than a side dish. Would make again!

I was really excited to try this because the reviews were so good.. I wasn't very impressed. It was good, but I am not a huge fan of black olives or sun dried tomatoes (unless in a bagel). Next time, I will use the same "sauce" and cook mushrooms and broccoli with garlic and maybe some meat. Overall, for the amount of calories in this dish, I wish it would have tasted more amazing.

This is a great recipe.  I added cooked chicken strips and baby spinach and omitted the red pepper flakes and black olives.  Turned out great.

This was fabulous!  I used the hints from others and used extra garlic, added sauteed baby Portabella mushrooms, sliced roasted bell pepper, and chicken.  It was even better reheated today for lunch!  Next time I will use a bit more chopped sun-dried tomatoes to flavor all the added ingredients.  My husband loved this, too, so I will be making it again and again!

Very tasty! We'll be making this often! DH and I both thought this could be served in a nice Italian restuarant. We added good kalamata olives, a mild domestic feta cheese, and sauted mushrooms. We also used penne pasta instead of farfalle. Turned out great! 
NOTE:Using 16 oz/ 1 lb. of penne was too much for my medium skillet. I ended up using 2/3 of the cooked pasta with the mixture.

Excellent.  As I started to put this together, I realized I had only a 12-ounce box of pasta and was worried that the proportions would be thrown off.  Not to worry!  I also added about ten large button mushrooms (quartered, added with the tomatoes) because I had them.  I havent done much cooking wth sun-dried tomatoes, but this recipe may make me a regular!   Great stuff (and not too salty, as I feared it might be withthe tomatoes and cheese -- but I did not salt the pasta water....).  Thanks!

Awesome easy recipe.  It's so good!  Unfortunately I don't live near a full service grocery store with an olive bar of sorts so I had to use the canned stuff.  But even so, it was awesome.
Great recipe!

This was really good.  I only had angel hair pasta, which didn't take the ingredients well, so I will try it again with a better pasta.

the dish was packed with flavor....this is what i did. the recipe didn't say to get the sun dried tomatoes packed in olive oil or not, so i got the oil packed ones. i reserved the oil and used that as part of the oil i sauted the garlic in. i also pan roasted the pine nuts. and i used half feta and half goat. and finally i used the zest of the lemon in the end..the results were terrific.

This is a wonderful recipe; I usually add 1/4-1/2 cup of chicken broth for a little moisture and have used crushed cashews when I didn't have pine nuts which worked very well.  We double the garlic, and leave out the olives, sometimes adding portabellos.

By far, my favorite pasta dish ever!  I LOVE this!  I make it often, have turned A LOT of friends onto and have yet to find anyone who doesn't like it.  It is still yummy as a leftover!  I add fresh baby spinach at the final stage, when the Feta cheese goes in - perfection!

This was ok...I think the feta cheese I bought from the store spoiled the recipe...it was a bit off.  I also left out the pine-nuts since they are pricey and I don't really care for them.

Great!! Soo easy.  I used whole grain penne pasta and almonds instead of pine nuts.  Tasted even better the next day.  Fantastic for weekdays dinners

I did not like the combintion of these flavors and I thought there was way too much heat with the crushed red pepper.  I am removing this recipe from my recipe box.

Great with a few changes - I toast the pine nuts for a few minutes (medium heat) and double the tomatoes and olives. A nice, fresh pasta.

Very good! I wish it had a little more sauce to it, but it was very light and healthy. I did add some asparagus tips and it took it to another level.

I made quite a few (okay, a lot) of changes to the original recipe. First I sauteed about 4 oz. of quartered white mushrooms in EVOO, added garlic, red pepper flakes, pine nuts, kalamata olives, about 3 TBSPs lemon juice, more EVOO, and a couple glugs of white wine. I kept the heat on low and allowed the 'concoction' to reduce. Meanwhile, I cooked 5 chicken tenderloins (previously marinated in Italian dressing) on my George Foreman. When I added my 8 oz. of penne pasta to the skillet, I threw in 1/2 c. feta, the sliced chicken, and about 1/4 c. each of parmesan and pecorino romano (grated). I really love the combination of flavors in this dish. My husband's only complaint was the pine nuts- he just didn't like the 'crunchy things'. For those that thought this was dry, simply reduce the amount of pasta or increase the EVOO and lemon juice. Of course, a little wine never hurt anybody either!

This reminds me of being in Italy again, it's so good! Used goat cheese as we prefer that to feta, and added in a jar of pickled artichoke hearts just for some variation. No farfalle either, so I improvised and used macaroni -pasta is pasta, after all- and it still turned out great.

We've been making a pasta very similar to this one for years.  The BIG difference is that no Sicilian in their right mind would ever use canned black olives.  Take the time to find good olives.  They are definitely out there in the regular grocery.  But remember, friends don't let friends eat those nasty canned California black olives.

I made this for dinner tonight and my hubby and I thought it was fabulous!!  I added some chicken that I sauteed with some garlic and olive oil, used kalamata olives and decreased the red pepper flakes to 1/2 tsp.  The amount of sauce was perfect and reminded me of pasta we had when we were in Italy.  I will be making this again and again.

Good but not amazing.  Easy dish for kids.  Didn't include the red pepper flakes (it was fine) and substituted kalamata olives for the black.  Added stuff to taste (didn't really use measurements).  Good the next morning as a cold leftover lunch dish.

I noticed the picture had kalamata olives instead of the black olives that the recipe called for.  I love kalamatas and decided to try it that way.  Even though I do love them, omitted the pine nuts, since it would have meant a trip to the store, everything else I had in my pantry.
I must say, this was amazing, easy and I had it all in my pantry.  I added a dash of oregano to give it more of a greek taste, but even my 3 year old ate it.
Kalamatas do tend to be more salty and the feta is as well so watch the salt shaker!

Great recipe, but no black olives for me!!  You can substitute the feta with mozz. with no problem.  I added a bit of chicken stock, and next time will try some shrimp over the pasta.

I like the recipe. But will make it with less heat and exchange feta for mozzeralla cheese, using only about half of cup.     Can't wait to make it.

This was very good and so simple. I didn't have the pine nuts nor the olives, but it was still good. Next time I'll add half as much pepper flakes, a little too hot for us.

I thought this was just ok, I like all of the ingredients, but thought the flavors were a little strong, and didn't come together as I had hoped. I didn't really like the addition of the lemon juice, it made it too sour.  So maybe it would taste better without the lemon juice?  I think it needs some other seasonings as well.

Absolutely delicious. I followed the recipe precisely with the exception of extra garlic, ground red pepper (didn't have flakes), and slivered almonds since I didn't have pine nuts. This is a definite keeper for me.

This was an easy and delicious recipe.  I don't like to rate with substitutions, but I used organic whole wheat broken spaghetti, and sunflower kernels (it was all I had)instead of pine nuts (I think the pine nuts would have been over-the-top delicious). And using everything else as written, it was great!  My bf (I am so lucky to have a 'manly-man' Italian that still likes to eat healthy!) loved it.  Will try it again, using kusera or fontina cheese, just for consistency's sake. This dish, served with a mixed greens salad and italian bread w/balsamic vinegar dip was PRIMO!!!

Awesome! Added Chicken for the boys and Avocado for myself. Left out the red peppers for the sake of the 3 year old but even my picky husband who claims to dislike Feta, Pine Nuts, and Sun-dried tomatoes loved it.  Next time I will add a bit more olive oil so it's less dry but overall it was a hit.

wonderful for a crowd. I tweaked by adding frozen king prawns and a big dollop of cream fraiche to the sauce mix. Everyone loved it. The groom and my uncle (music) were still drooling 2 days later at the ceremony

Good recipe.  Relatively easy to make, considering I am very new to cooking.  One note, this does make for a better side dish over an entree.  But if you try it as an entree, I would recommend adding chicken to the mix.

I discovered this delicious recipe a year and half ago. This is very fast and easy to make. Plus, it is very inexpensive. I make this recipe once every 3 weeks, now. Even my very picky, hard to please uncle loves this dish and asked for the recipe. I add oregano, thyme, and rosemary - sprinkle my share when simmering the sauce.

This was simple AND super tasty. I did the recipe exactly as written except with a little less red pepper since my husband doesn't like spicy foods. I also added some steak seared in soy sauce and some garlic salt at a very high heat. It was so so so so good!

This was a great tasting, easy dinner. Perfect blend of flavors. I didn't use the pine nuts but added artichoke hearts. It would probably be good as a cold dish also.

This was amazing! I made this for my husband and myself for dinner during the week, and it was super easy and so flavorful! I had some leftover and had no problem eating this for the next 2 days! It was quick, easy, delicious and tastes just as good the following days as it did straight out of the pan. I see this in the regular rotation! Add a simple green salad and it's the perfect dinner!

This dish is absolutely delicious.  I used about 12 oz. of pasta and substituted kalamata olives.  I think I will be serving this cold or room temp. during the summer to replace the ordinary mac salad!

Yummy!  Love the flavors of the Feta with sun dried tomatoes.  Next time will use less crushed red pepper...little to tangy for the kids.

I made this for the first time and it was soooo good, I couldn't think about anything else but to cook this again. For a recipe so quick and simple, it is marvelous. Have given the recipe to several friends. Will make again and again.

This was really easy and very good. I wanted to make it a little lighter so I used 2 cups of chicken broth instead of all the oil. I also used parmesan rather than feta, and it turned out well. I will definitely make this again.

This was fantastic, the only change I would do next time would be to decrease the red pepper flakes, little spicy for me but Hubby loved it as it was.  Definately 5 stars and will make again.

It was just ok.  I really wanted it to be better.  Maybe because i kept adding stuff, diced red pepper, mushroom, red wine.  I will make it again.  I love the sun dried tomatoes, I could eat those all nite long!!

This is a great last minute "what should I make for dinner tonight" recipe.  You probably have all the ingredients on hand already and it's really quick.  My husband isn't too fond of Feta so I substituted Parmasan and it was still great.  Don't forget the pine nuts.  They really add alot to the recipe.

This was very easy and very tasty.  I followed the other reviews and only used about 2/3 of a package of pasta instead of the whole thing.  I will definitely make this again.

I'm sorry to say that this dish, prepared AS DIRECTED did not work out well. Dry, dry, dry.  Way too much pasta for the tiny amount of oil and way too little sundried tomatoes. And, yes, I did think the recipe called for way too much pasta for that tiny bit of oil, but I didn't read the reviews beforehand and the 4 1/2 stars caught my attention, so I made it as directed.  Big mistake.

This dish we enjoyed very much! However I did a couple of preparations differently.  I followed the amounts and ingredients exactly except that I used only 1/2 lb of the bowties.  I cooked the bowties the day before and then right before mixing them into the other ingredients, I popped then in a colander into hot tap water. This achieves the same results but saves lots of time when you need it most! I sauted them in the sauce for a few minutes before mixing in the feta. Guess what--the little bit that was left over was eaten cold by my son and his wife.  They said it was really good as a pasta salad!!

This was great!!!  I made a few changes, didn't have sun dried tomatos so I used a can of diced romas and chicken.  Cooked the tomatos till juice was almost gone.  My husband really liked it.  I will serve this quite often.

Excellent! Quick, flavorful and very satisfying! Thought that it was a bit dry, so next time I'll start by adding an extra Tbsp. of lemon juice and two of olive oil.  It's a favorite!

I didn't really like this.  I used less pasta than the recipe called for and it was still too much...too dry!  I would cut down on the red pepper flakes too!  The recipe has a good basis...next time (if I try it again) I will have to do some major tweeking.

This is a definite winner...to cut down fat & calories I used only 3 Tbsp. of olive oil and used reduced fat feta. There are so many different flavors in this dish, it was quite delicious and we'll be having the leftovers for lunch today. Thanks for an easy and fast weeknight dinner!

My family and I loved this. Although I did make some changes. I substituted 2 Tbsp.  vinegar for lemon juice, grape tomatoes for sundried and omitted pine nuts because I thought they were fairly expensive at the store. I think the feta cheese makes the pasta dish      
way yummy! My youngest daughter doesn't like feta though, but I sprinkled some grated mozzerella on hers and she loved it. Chewy bread is a must for sopping up the evoo and vinegar!

I wish I could give this 10 stars, it's that good! The only deviation from the recipe is that I added shrimp. It was so quick and easy to put together and it tastes like a million dollars.

I made this and it was so GREAT!    I used thin spaghetti and used everything but pine nuts.  I added capers and chopped tomatoes.  This will become a favorite with us and I can see adding shrimp or pieces of salmon as another way to still have pasta but also fish.

I Liked it....but, with some tweaks here and there, you can do something with this dish to really make it a 5 star dish! More Garlic is needed. Also More Lemon Juice. Salt and Pepper needs to be added to the olive oil sauce

To make this better -- 
The pine nuts need to be roasted on low heat separately in a small pan and then added at the end.
It needs herbs, perhaps some fresh chopped basil.
3 cloves of garlic was a bit much, unless they are very small cloves.
If you don't LOVE sun-dried tomatoes, I think it would be better with a bunch of fresh ripe tomato.

Added pancetta to have a little meat in the dish.. was very good and a nice change from tomato or alfredo sauce pasta dishes. I will dial back on the red pepper flakes next time, was a little too spicy at times for my personal liking. Overall, very good!

Made it as written and it was good. I'm going with 4 stars only because it was a bit to lemony. I used fresh lemons and only put in 1.5 tablespoons of lemon juice. A couple teaspoons of fresh lemon juice would have been plenty in my opinion. Thanks for sharing and will make it again with that modification.

Loved this! I used two fresh tomatoes instead of sun dried tomatoes and I hand-squeezed 2 small lemons, otherwise I followed the recipe. I loved that by the time the pasta was done, the whole meal was done! Hubby rated this a 4 1/2, and he rarely does that!

This is my favorite pasta dish of all time!  I love the spice, it's not heavy like so many Italian dishes, it's great hot or cold the next day.  Yum, yum yum....The only thing I do different is use Kalamata olives - these are my fav! - and I use chopped almonds instead of pine nuts because pine nuts are so expensive.  I also use the julienne sliced sun dried tomatoes in oil.  (Love that marinade.) Sprinkle with a little fresh grated parmesan and good to go. This is on my menu each week.  It's a keeper!

This is an all time fav. One of the first recipes from this site that I tried, which kept me coming back for years. I cook as is. Love the subtle citrus flavour and best with good quality feta.

Made this recipe for the first time yesterday evening for dinner.  My husband and I loved it,.  I made a couple of changes.  I used kalamata olives instead of black olives, and I used parmesan cheese because I didn't have any feta cheese, and I diced a grilled chicken breast (marinated in italian dressing) and added it to this dish.  Will definitely be making this again sometime soon, and will try it with feta cheese.

I'd give this dish 4 1/2 stars.  I used rigate pasta, julienned/sundries tomatoes and Aleppo pepper are about the only things I changed, but didn't put all the pasta in the finished dish.  My husband said it was good!! I will make it again.

I really loved the flavor of the dressing on this salad.  I served it as a side cold salad and it was very good, but I also think it would be great served right after it is cooked and dressing stirred in.

delicious! My 20 year old daughter said this is the best pasta dish she ever had! 
The only change I made was I used California Brand sun dried tomatoes and California sun dried garlic tomatoes. It was excellent!

First time I made this followed recipe except added only 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes and used kalamata olives. Was OK but a little bland. Second time I made it; I rosated pine nuts, added 1 extra garlic clove, added chopped sweet red pepper, sauteed 5 oz. of baby spinch, wilted. I used sun-dried tomatoes with basil and added 8 oz of feta and used kalamata olives. Also increased crushed red pepper flakes to 3/4 tsp. All that gave the dish a lot more flavor. Would make this again with those changes.

I was so disappointed in this recipe after reading all the rave reviews I thought we'd love this. I love all the ingredients that were in it but it was just very very dry! I think it would be better as a cold pasta salad and maybe I will do that the next time.

Didn't have pine nuts, but I made this anyway. Doubled the garlic (b/c i LOVE it) and added portobello mushrooms and zucchini. It was delicious! Definitely adding this recipe into the rotation! Thank you!

Delicious!  I might add a bit more sun-dried tomatoes next time but it was restaurant quality regardless of this modification.

My husband loved this and gave it 5 stars.  I'll have to wait till I get off this diet before I can rate it and I bet it will be 5 stars for me too.  Can't wait! :)

I made this recipe exactly as written even though I was a little afraid of the amount of chili flakes - it was perfect!  All of the flavours I love.  A sprinkle of Parmesan before serving, and I was in heaven - in about 15 minutes after getting home from work!  Thanks for this recipe.

Whenever I make a recipe for the first time I never alter it so that I can give a review on a
recipe as submitted.  With that said, this was an absolute hit! When I make it again (& I will) to satisfy my husband's love of beef, I would only add cooked meatballs along with the pasta.

excellent, fast, easy; even without the pine nuts (that I forgot to buy). Good as a warm side dish or a cold pasta salad.
I will be making this again

Very good recipe.  We added too many sun dried tomatos so stick to the recommended 1/2 cup.  We also added a zucchini and cut back on the red pepper.  It was spicy with just 1/3 tsp red pepper flakes!

Great for a change of pace.  Spicy!  I may cut down on the red pepper flakes for my own tastes next time.  Definitely do not skimp on the amount of feta. Would probably taste good with shrimp as well.  May try this next time.

This was EXCELLENT!!!!  It did make a lot of pasta, but it is just as great the next day as left overs.  Loved the combination of flavors.  Wish I could give it more than 5 stars! Have to warn it was a little spicy for the kids though.

Very good. Easy, fast, versitile. I used walnuts rather than pine nuts - added a half cup of red onion to the garlic and cooked until soft. Very nice.

Oh MY GOD!! This recipe is unbelievable. I am not a good cook, and am easily intimidated. But this dish was so easy and fast in DELICIOUS. I cooked it for a guy I just started dating and he loved it. I'm telling all my friends about it. I used goat cheese instead because it's not as bitter as Feta. It's perfect with the bow-tie pasta.

My entire family loved this quick dish - even my kids (although they picked out a few things!)  It also freezes well - which we do with leftovers often.  I didn't give it a 5 star because it did seem a little dry.

Delicious and easy recipe.  I used slivered almonds instead of pine nuts and gouda in place of Feta (we're not a Feta fan) and it turned out awesome.  Great recipe to make for company.

I added at the end a glass of white wine and let it cook for a minute, it make it creamer.  And I used Parmesan instead of Feta.

This was very good, but you have to like sun-dried tomatoes. For those of us who don't, I'm not sure what could replace them in this recipe to make it 5 stars.  Anyone?

omitted the pine nuts and olives.  Added mushrooms and bell pepper as suggested to the lemon juice.  Very lemony veggies.  I thought it was nice, light and tangy but my husband didn't - I love the pucker I guess.

A great dish. As others said, use Kalamata olives instead of the canned black olives. I added some parmesan and asiago cheese, but the dish would be fine without them. My only other suggestion would be to not add salt to this dish--the cheese and olives make it salty enough.

This was really good. I added some grilled chicken. My husband said that it was a little dry, but it was very tasty.
