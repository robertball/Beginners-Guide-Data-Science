I have a favorite recipe for stewed tomatoes from an old Betty Crocker book, and I thought maybe this was the "pudding version" minus the peppers. Once I started making it I realized it fit in an 8x8 pan, but it had a full 1 1/2 sticks of butter! After I mixed the 1st 3 ingredients it had a nice flavor until I added the sugar. Then, it just got over-poweringly SWEET, yet when it was baked it was SUPER GREASY! In my dish it was sitting in a mound of "orange grease." The tomato taste behind all of the sugar and butter was good, but it was just so heavily masked. I think I will just keep making my stewed tomatoes on the stove, which also has bread, but is simpler to make, healthier, and tastes like fresh tomatoes. The concept sounded good, as I love tomatoes, but maybe I just didn't get it?
