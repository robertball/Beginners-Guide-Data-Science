Amazing dish!  I added oven roasted garlic butter in addition to the amount of garlic listed since I had about a tablespoon leftover. Rather than foil packet method I just tossed the shrimp in with the sauce & saut√©ed until shrimp was just pink on both sides. Served over baked spaghetti squash that was baked with olive oil, S & P. Thank you for posting!

This was very good. I had to scale down for my needs but turned out fine. Served it over garlic toast points. Omitted wine because I did not have on hand. Will be a great appetizer for summer bbq's.

This is absolutely divine.  I use a lot more garlic than the recipe calls for, and we discovered it makes a great, simple sauce for pasta !

Delicious. I marinated and then after cooking it was a big hit. Do not understand why only three people gave tried it. Great recipe. I'm have fixed it at least four times.
