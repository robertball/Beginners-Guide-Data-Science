These were cute and different. Make sure you use standard cup cake trays, my first attempt was shallow trays. Also, let your biscuit dough warm up a bit and it's more stretch-able.

I made these for a Super Bowl party and it was a HUGE hit with my boyfriend and his buddies.  I put lettuce on the bottom of the cups as suggested, but sprinkled the tops with some shredded monterey jack cheese, which added a little something to it.  They still ask me when I'm going to make them again!

These were great, baked the "cups" two days before, and they were still soft day of event.  I didn't add lettuce to bottom of shell afraid it would get too soggy.  But topped it with lettuce, dollop of sour cream and salsa.  Big Hit!!!
