This cake has a great "lemony" flavor and is quick to make. I split the cake into 3 layers and filled it with lemon curd, then frosted it with lemon cream cheese icing made from an 8 oz. package of cream cheese, 1/4 c. lemon juice, 1 tsp. grated lemon peel and powdered sugar. I also added 1 tsp.grated lemon peel to the cake batter before baking.

This cake is fantastic! It's very easy, so new bakers shouldn't have a problem impressing family, or friends. And the taste is great. It is very moist. Also, a little tip, instead of flouring the pan, sugar it, with granulated sugar. It works just as well, & doesn't leave a white residue on the cake. I garnished with fresh lemon whipped cream, & YUM!

I fell in love with a lemon cake at a local restaurant and went in search of the recipe.  This recipe is even better! I bake it in 2 round cake pans and pour the glaze on while they are still in the pan.  I also poke tiny holes in the cake as mentioned earlier.  Then I frost it with cream cheese frosting.  SO GOOD!  It is now my most requested dessert!

I substituded butter for oil, used fresh squeezed lemon juice instead of water, and fresh squeezeed in the drizzle.  It was so good and truly was better the next day.  I took it to work and people loved it.  Kathleen3

My family loved this cake so much that I printed out the recipe and put it away under my favorites! I did not experience any problems previously  mentioned; crumbly, messy, wouldn't release. I found it to be perfect.  I did let it rest longer than an hour before I inverted it, and used a rubber spatula to help release the sides. (remember the sides of a cake/bundt pan should be room temp. before inverting)I poured the glaze over the cake while it was still inside the mold, just take your time and let it absorb a bit. The prep work is very similar to a Rum Cake, so you may even want to pierce holes in the cake for the icing so seep through. Good Luck!!!

I have made this cake 7 times now... i get the best response every time....however i will never BOIL the syrup....if you do and it gets into a candy stage is could seal your cake to the pan...and like me you will have to claw the cake out of the pan....still tastes great....but won't come away from the pan....  so just blend the powder sugar with the lemon juice you don't have to heat it to get it to blend.... and i put sugar on the pan instead of flouring it.....and it makes a slight crunchiness to the outside everyone loves...  it's a keeper recipes thats for sure!!!  thank you.

This is a very moist, tender cake with great flavor. Very quick and easy to prepare. I did not have enough lemon juice but did have fresh orange juice so I used that and threw in the zest of one orange as well. I found a recipe similar to this recently and that recipe had blueberries in it. I had a couple of handfuls of frozen blueberries in the freezer so I added those too. Everyone really enjoyed this. Thanks for sharing!

Baked for work and got rave reviews.  Very very moist and nice and lemony.  Followed directions to a "T".  I had no problem getting the cake out of the bundt pan.  A cooking tip that my sister taught me is to buy a product called Bakers Joy.  It is in the baking section of your local grocery store.  It is in a can and is oil and flour combined.  You just spray your bundt pan with it.  Works perfect every time.  I only waited about 15 minutes to flip the cake out of the bundt pan and it turned out perfect.  (See photo)  Thanks Heather

This cake is good, but make sure you use extra flour when preparing the pan b/c it is a sticky mess if you don't.  I used a bundt pan.My cakes generally don't stick.  An angel food pan would be easier but not as pretty. When inverting it about 1/3 of my cake stuck and I had to scrap it out and stick it together.  When I tried to center the cake it wouldn't budge.  I used fresh lemon juice for the glaze which is good, but the cake is extremely moist and super,super sweet.  I may try to make this again b/c I really love lemon cake. The glaze causes the cake to stick when inverting so be careful. Perhaps making less of the glaze and pouring it over once the cake has been inverted would be a good solution.

There is no mistaking this cake for a scratch cake, but for a doctored up cake mix this is pretty darned good.  I didn’t have lemon cake mix, as I prefer (and used) a French Vanilla Cake mix in any recipe calling for any variety of yellow or white cake mix.  I also used vanilla pudding rather than lemon.  For lemon flavor, then, I used a mix of 1/3 cup fresh lemon juice and enough sour mix (Fresca, leftover from Lemon Drop Martinis a couple of nights ago!) to make the total of 3/4 cup liquid.  I also added a teaspoon of lemon extract and a full tablespoon of lemon zest.  I did not use the confectioners’ sugar and lemon juice syrup.  Rather, I made a simple glaze of confectioners’ sugar, lemon juice, a dab of butter and a tablespoon or so of corn syrup.  This is a “plain” and simple cake, not one of Hubs’ favorites for just that reason, as he prefers richer cakes with lots of frosting. This is light, moist and refreshing, delicious on its own but would also be nice with berries and cream.

This cake is pure lemony goodness.  I don’t usually like box cakes but this has a homemade taste.  I used ¼ lemon juice with the water.  I thought it would be nice to pour the glaze on the top but that would have just made a sticky mess.  I was skeptical about pouring the glaze on the bottom but it worked perfectly and seeped through the entire cake without making the cake soggy.  My entire family loved this and have already requested that we make it again soon.

Moist and delicious.  I took this to a dinner party and everyone loved it. The next day we had a party at our house and I got out the leftovers.  Surprise!  It was even better.  Definitely 5 stars.  I changed nothing but added 1/4 cup extra water because the batter was very thick and my hand mixer was struggling.

Delicious.  Texture was good.  Easy to make.  Appearance is nice.  
I love lemon flavor, so I added a dash of lemon extract to the cake mix.  That was the only change/addition I made.   Well, except that 50 minutes in my oven is too long.  Oven temps vary so check it after 40 minutes or so as another reviewer said.

Excellent cake, very moist and flavorful.  However, 50 minutes is way too long in the oven...check for done after 40.

I love this recipe (perfect for those last minute requirements) and have made it for a number of years with slight variation.  I have used both yellow and white cake mixes and typically use the white one.  I bake in a bundt and cool enought to remove.  I place on a plate and poke numerous deep holes with a long serving fork or a skewer.  I then slowly pour the hot glaze over it.  Don't worry if some pools at the base.  The trick to making this cake is to make it ahead (the night before or early morning).  This allows time for the glaze to absorb into the cake and make it so moist and flavorful! The ideas for frosting and toppings listed in the comments are intriguing and I'll try some new additions now.  Thanks!

Excellent, so gooey and lemony. Looks nothing like the photo. Didn't have lemon cake mix, just yellow so used 1/4 cup of lemon juice in place of the water and it worked out perfect. My husband is in heaven with this cake right now.

I used lemonade instead of water and spiked it with a little lemon extract b/c we love lemon so much. For a glaze I squeezed fresh lemon juice into some store bought cream cheese icing until it became liquid enough to drizzle all over the bundt. These couple of changes make it a lemon zinger!

I followed the directions to a "T" as they say and ended up with a big mess in the pan.  The cake would not release from the pan.  It split into several pieces.   I think the problem is the one hour cooling period is too long.  Letting the syrup sit for this long makes it too sticky and thus causes the cake to stick to the pan.

Granted it is easy to make and very lemony but it still tastes like a cake mix so therefore has that "artificial" aftertaste.   Have tried many similar cakes and they are all much too sweet for us....sorry. Still go back to a made from scratch lemon cake and many recipes on this site.

I have found if I put a plate over the top of the bundt pan and turn it upside down quickly and then right side up again before pouring the glaze on the cake in the pan, it will release a lot easier when it has cooled down.

I love this basic recipe.  I made it for my birthday in a 3 layer cake.  Used lemon pie filling for the layers and then frosted very lightly with lemon frosting.  Turned out wonderful.  If you like lemon, you will love this.

My boyfriend kept asking me to make a lemon cake and I am not a very experienced baker so I thought this looked easy enough for me to not mess it up. I was right... it's easy and delicious! Super moist, full of lemon flavor and best of all... fool proof!

Super delicious, but putting the glaze on and letting it soak for an hour before turning the cake out of the pan does not work well. Even though I greased and floured my bundt pan very well, half of the cake, drenched in sticky goodness, stayed in the pan.  Next time I will drizzle the glaze on the cake AFTER I have turned it out onto the plate.

This was an excellent cake. To the cake; I added the rind of 1/2 a lemon. It was extremely moist. Fresh rind always keeps a cake moist. I made it in 2 9" layers and baked them for 30 min. I didn't use the frosting as I wanted it filled between layers (I slit each to make 4 layers) with a lemon filling recipe that was quite unusual. 4oz. Cream cheese soften, 3/4 c. lemonade concentrate &  1 can sweetened condensed milk. Beat together and fold in cool whip. It was a superb choice. Used more grated rind and strawberries for finishing touches around top and base of cake.

I used lemon gelatin jello mix instead of pudding mix, and I replaced the water with real lemon juice and it was out of this world lemony!! I've made this several times and discovered that real lemon juice makes all the difference. So easy and soooo good.

Might as well had made just the box cake, nothing special.  The glaze just made the top part chewy, not moist.

This cake is so delicious, yet very simple to make. I'm rating the cake because I did not use the lemon glaze. I used this for our Easter dessert, I made a basket cake. I doubled the recipe and used four 9 inch round pans, but only used 3 layers for the cake. They were done between 30-35 minutes at 350. It is moist, tender and bursting with wonderful lemon flavor. I wanted a lemon cake that wasn't too time consuming being I had to focus more on the decorating, and this fit the bill. I will try this for sure using the glaze because that sounds wonderful also. I frosted this with Rick's Special Buttercream from this site. Everyone loved this cake, thanks :)

This cake should be illegal! I made this once and then proceeded to make it every week for about 6.  I made a glaze out of some butter, confectioners sugar and fresh squeezed lemon juice.  Absolutely delish!

I was hoping this would be like the lemon cake at Starbucks.  The cake part was very similar...the glaze was a sticky disappointment.  I guess I was hoping for more of an icing, which this is not.  It never "hardens" so it pools onto the platter and stays that way.  Anyway, I will make the cake again, and am on the search for a white icing. :)

after reading everyone's comments, i chickened out and waited until the cake was completely cool (about 4 hours) to invert it and pour a thickened version of the glaze over the top.    the result was great; it gave the cake a shiny look and added moistness to the already moist cake.  i garnished it with some fresh lemon slices and it looked really simple and beautiful.    my family easter included 6 cakes and 15 people so i considered it a good review that my lemon cake was mostly eaten by the end of the day!

I served this on Easter and no one liked it.  I also used the ReaLemon lemon juice, perhaps that was the mistake!  The cake was too moist because the icing was absorbed into the cake.  It would have been much better to leave the last step off completely.

Yes, this cake was luscious.  I followed the directions exactly, except I substituted lemon juice for water in the cake mix.  I was concerned about the glaze preparation based on reviews from others.  I made a few adjustments to avoid the cake sticking, and it worked perfectly.  I prepared a non-stick bundt pan with non-stick spray and flour.  I baked the cake for 45 minutes, removed from oven and cooled about 10 minutes.  I prepared the galze dissolving the powdered sugar and lemon juice over heat, but not to boiling.  I poured it over the cake in the pan (after the cake cooled for 10 min.), then let it cool an additinal 20 minutes before releasing it onto a plate.  I sprinkeled it with more powdered sugar before serving.  I was moist and delicious.

This was a GREAT lemon cake- and so so easy! I used a half water half lemon juice mixture, and added lemon zest and a little vanilla for fun. Will make this again and again! **Totally forgot and left out the oil this time- but still turned out GREAT! A little dry, but it's my own fault!

It was good, but WAY too sweet. My co-workers all said they liked it. Would make again and either leave out the lemon juice and powdered sugar or only use 1/3 of it. I couldn't find Bakers Joy that some of the reviews stated, so I bought PAM for baking.  I thought after letting it sit for the hour, it wasn't going to come out of the pan, but it sure did.

Ok, I made this cake exactly as stated...it was almost too sour to eat but it had wonderful flavor..I KNOW..doesn't make sense but it's true. That is why I'm giving this 5 stars...because with a little tweaking, this cake is fantastic! If you love, and I mean, LOVE lemon..this cake is for you. Here's what I changed...made cake as stated plus 1TBS of zest. Made the lemon syrup with real lemons and decreased the amount to 1/3 cup and conf. sugar to 2C (heated in microwave). I made a 2 layer cake (poking holes in cakes with a fork) and divided the syrup between them (leaving them in their pans for about an hour after soaking) Then frosted with a cream cheese frosting which was lightly flavored with 1TBS of zest and 1-2TBS of real lemon juice (to taste) and refrig. overnight. WOW... Absolutely our only lemon cake from now on. Delicious!

It was excellent.  I definitely prefer lemon cake recipes which use the lemon pudding instead of lemon jello.  The lemon jello gives it a rubbery texture.  Also, I did not cook the glaze -- just mixed the powdered sugar with the lemon juice.  It helps to remove the lumps if you sift the powdered sugar first.  I baked in a large (10 x 12) pyrex pan and poured glaze over top.  Following advice of others, I poked holes in the top before pouring on the glaze.  Tasted excellent!

I'm a lemon freak so I followed some other reviewers' tips and added 1 tsp of lemon extract and used lemonade instead of water. My batter was extremely thick, so I ended up adding another 1/4 c. lemonade so I could operate the mixer for 5 minutes. Used cooking spray for baking and sugar to coat the bundt pan and cake inverted easily after maybe 20 minutes. As a beginner, I didn't understand beating the eggs until they were thick, so I just beat them a minute or so. I also didn't understand the concept of pouring in the glaze to the bottom of the cake in the bundt pan... I thought it would make it too gooey. I ended up putting on maybe half of the glaze after the cake was inverted and partially cooled -- don't think it helped it. Next time I will probably just dust with powdered sugar for appearance, because this cake would be plenty delicious and moist without the glaze. Thanks for a great recipe. Now who will save me from eating the whole thing today??!!

I made this for a friend who loves lemon cake's birthday.  I frosted it with chocolate cream cheese frosting.  The cake was great, very lemony, moist and sweet; my friend loved it.  The icing was great too.  However, in the future, I don't think I'll pair the two again.  The cake is so sweet by itself that it would be great without any frosting.  The glaze makes the cake have a very golden, shiny texture.  It's beautiful alone, great cake!

This recipe was wonderful.  It tasted like it was made from scratch.  For the glaze I added 4-5 tbsp of lemon juice along with a cup of powder sugar.  My suggestion would be to add the frosting after the cake has cooled, that way the glaze shows up.

I made this on a Sunday exactly as written. My husband had a piece and then returned for another. At that point, he asked me to take the "evil" cake to work the next day because it possessed him. My co-workers downed what was left in about 15 minutes. It is moist, lemony and one of the best cakes I've eaten.

I made these for my boyfriend's birthday as he loves lemon...and he adored them.  I think he ate half of them before dinner. I decided to make cupcakes (I don't have a bundt pan) and they turned out quite deliciously. The only thing is that it was a bit difficult to get the lemon drizzle to go into the cupcakes instead of all over the counter.  We poked holes in the top of each one with a fork and that seemed to work pretty well.  Thanks for sharing!

Just the BEST!!! I made it once with the yellow cake and another time with the white cake. Its much better with the yellow. If you want more of a tart flavor, make your own lemon juice, and even tarter, juice the rind in an electric juicer!!

This cake was SOOO moist, and SOOO good!!! When making the icing, I made the mistake(?) of using ReaLemon bottled lemon juice, and when I mixed it with the powdered sugar, it didn't seem too homogenous. Anyway, I poured it on the lemon cake while the cake was still warm, and it sort of got absorbed by the cake, but this, I thought, made the cake taste even better! Next time, I'll do the same thing, but I'll also mix FRESH lemon juice with the powdered sugar, and pour it on the cake after it's cooled- then I'll have an icing!! This cake was soooooooooo good!

This cake has become a family favorite and requested all the time. I only do two things differently.  Instead of grease and flour the pan, I grease and sugar the pan.  I'm lazy when it comes to making the glaze.  I use ready-made lemon frosting. Put dollops of frosting around the hot turned out cake. Frosting melts and drips down the sides of the cake.  One container of frosting can glaze 3 or 4 cakes.

I've made this cake twice now. The first time was several years ago and I had no trouble with it and everyone loved it (I thought it was okay, but nothing amazing).  I made it again tonight, since it's easy and was generally a hit, and I made it exactly as written in the recipe and it stuck to the pan and fell apart when I tried to get it out.  I'm having trouble remembering whether I poured the syrup onto the cake while it was in the pan the first time I made it, but I'm fairly sure I didn't.  If you're making this cake for the first time and it's important it comes out right the first time, I would NOT recommend pouring the syrup on the cake until you've removed it from the pan.  Also, as another reviewer pointed out, the cake doesn't look like the one in the photo (that one has an unknown glaze poured over the top that makes it look really gorgeous).  If I make this cake again, I'll skip the syrup in the recipe and make a beautiful glaze like the one in the picture.

My cake was not moist at all; in fact, I found it to be drier than if I had just used the cake mix itself and followed directions for that.  The glaze did nothing at all for the cake except made it sticky and WAY too sweet. I thought the glaze would make it moist, but it seemed to make it drier (sticky) where the glaze was!

Made this cake for my son who loves lemon cake.  Followed the recipe and even used a nonstick bundt pan and liberally greased and floured it, but half the cake stuck to the pan. I was very disappointed. Luckily my son is teenager and will eat it anyway. I give it 3 stars for flavor only. Next time I  will allow it to cool 10 min place it on the cake rack and pour the glaze on while it's still warm. I hoping for better results.

This was delicious.  I made it as a layer cake with two 8" round cakes.  I did choose to ice it with chocolate buttercream, and in retrospect I shouldn't have.  The lemon flavor was so great that it didn't benefit from the chocolate.  Next time I will try the bundt pan and the dusting of icing sugar.  Thanks for a great recipe!

My mom LOVED this cake... I thought it was pretty good. The cake itself is pretty moist and good although not as lemony as I thought it would be. The only thing I didn't care for was the crust for some reason.

I have been making this cake for years and it is sooo yummy!  My girlfriends always request this at girls night out and have asked me for the recipe.  My friend still has my bundt pan from when she made it last time so I am trying in a 9x11 metal baking pan.  It probably won't look as pretty but excited to try it this way.  The bundt pan requires a long time to cool.  I'm hoping this is faster since the cake is not as dense.  You will love this lemon cake!

Chose this recipe based on positive reviews.  Baked 50 minutes as instructed, even though cake mix box said 40 minutes for bundt cake.  Cake was black on top when it came out of the oven, even though I followed the recipe and placed on center rack. Made this as a birthday cake for a cousin who loves LEMON......she will never see this cake! Very disappointed.

I want to know how everyone makes the glaze without it being grainy.  Mine came out in clumps of sugary globs on top of the cake when I flipped it over.    I heated it just til boiling,  should of  I boiled longer.

I give the cake itself 5 stars for taste, however I followed some of the advice and used sugar instead of flour when I greased the bundt pan.  Long story short, half the cake never came out of the pan and I had to use a spoon to get it out - it was that sticky with the glaze.  Cake itself was very moist, but end product looked like a train wreck.  I waited 2 1/2 hours to invert, no luck.

This cake was incredibly moist. Which is what i haven't been able to achieve in the past, baking with boxed cakes. Just the right sweetness and lemony flavor. yummy. My family loved it! It was gone in 2 hours. A definite Do-It-Again.

This cake is definitely moist with the perfect lemon twist. After making this several times, I wanted to change it up. I decided to put an extra amount of liquid (1/4 cup of sprite).. this made it even better!!!

I baked this perfectly my second time around. The trick is to follow the directions exactly with regard to cooling time. If you put the hot lemon/sugar mixture onto the hot cake as soon as it comes out of the oven and let it cool for the full hour, the cake sets up enough not to fall apart, but is still warm enough that it turns out without sticking (the lemon/sugar mixture doesn't cool enough to turn to super glue, it's still warm enough to separate). I used Pam For Baking on an ancient bundt pan and had no problems. And I basked in the glory of the compliments I received.

I needed to make a lemon birthday cake, so I baked this in a 9x13" pan and frosted it with the Lemon Icing recipe on this site. It was FABulous! All of us chocoholics went nuts for it! The only thing I changed about the cake recipe was I upped the water to 1 cup.

ABSOLUTELY LOVELY LIGHT CAKE LEMON. I USED CREAM CHEESE AND RASBERRY FILLING IN THE MIDDLE, COVERED WITH A LEMON CREAM CHEESE FROSTING! TASTED SPECTACULAR! had to cook longer than the recipe called for, but may have been my oven or the shape of pan I used, not sure. Any way, it was delightful! Had to bake a second cake that night for my fiancée!

This cake is delicious! However it broke when I tried to take it out of the bundt pan. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to pour the glaze over top while it was still in the pan (that's what I did) but I wouldn't do that again. Also it's a very crumbly cake. I haven't gotten a solid piece out of it yet without it falling into crumbs. The first night we found it too lemony but about 24 hours later the taste was perfect. If I make this again I'll definitely have to play with the recipe a bit so that I'll have a firmer cake. Maybe less water? As it is, I would never serve it to company.

Great cake. I did some substitutions though. I used a supermoist yellow cake mix and added lemon zest. I also used real lemons for the 1/2 cup lemon juice. My company loved it as well.

When I put the glaze over the cake before removing it from the pan...it turned out to be a mess!  However, removing that step on the second try, turned out relatively well.  Good thing it was easy to make, and I had bought two of each ingredient.

This cake was average.  I didn't  care for it's texture...it was too crumbly and spongy (in my opinion much like a genoise).  I was looking for a more moist, firm, dense cake...

Very very good.  I poked holes in the top of the bundt cake, then inverted the cake back into the pan,  top in now bottom.  Poked holes in bottom and  slowly poured glaze over cake, while in pan. I let it set overnight, then inverted back on a cake platter. Top is now right side up.  All the glaze has been absorbed into the cake.  Lightly dusted with powdered sugar.  Delicious.

I made this cake today and it was wonderful, very zingy.  I did make a few small changes, as I would do for any cake I make from a mix.  First I used melted butter in place of oil, second I substituted milk for water.  I added the zest from one lemon (the one I juiced for the drizzle). I also added 1 tablespoon of Lemoncello. (I have a large bottle so I use it in anything with lemon).  I made a simple syrup drizzle for added moistness and flavor.  For the drizzle I weighed the juice from one lemon and used the same weight in sugar, I poked holes in the cake bottom then spooned over the lemon drizzle, then turned the cake over poked holes in the top and gently brushed the top with drizzle.  As others have said the icing makes a lot, so I just made about half, I did make it thick so it only flowed about half way down the cake, I just like that look.  I decorated the top with more zest.  A true lemon fest!

This is very good. The 1st time I made it, it turned out great with no problems. The 2nd time the cake collapsed when I tried to get it out of the tin. So next time around I may try some of the other suggestions. But very very tasty.

Very easy recipe. I added 1/4 teaspoon fresh lemon juice to the batter and for the glaze, in addition to the lemon juice I added the zest of one lemon. There were no leftovers!!!!!!

Made in two loaf pans.  Baked 40 minutes.  Very good but but next  time use bundt pan so glaze will be on top after getting out of pan instead of bottom.

Super moist, great lemon flavor, and so easy with cake mix.  The first one I made this week I took to work and it disappeared FAST. I just made a second one so my family can enjoy it. This is a KEEPER!

Simple and fast. I only wish the glaze was a little thicker.  It was so good though and moist. We paired it with fresh strawberries for a wonderful springtime brightness.

This was a yummy cake! I used vanilla pudding (the 5oz one) bc i didn't have lemon pudding and it still came out "lemony", I loved it! I did pour the glaze over the hot cake and only had a little trouble when I inverted the cake, mostly bc it was too moist, but not a big deal.

Wow!!  Love this cake. 2 days later I am making another one because I took it to work and got a small slice of it and find myself wanting more.  I let the cake completely cool after removing it from the bundt pan.  Using a chopstick I poked holes in the cake before I applied the glaze.  I made the glaze in the microwave for 3 min and stirred after each minute.  I let it cool a bit before I poured it onto the cake.  Sprinkled with powder sugar.

Fabulous! So incredibly lemony and I'm still getting compliments days later! I coated the pan with sugar instead of flour and it slid right out of the bundt pan. I'll definitely be making this again

Disaster! I followed the recipe to a T and it stuck to the pan and came out in pieces. I would remove the cake from the pan before pouring the glaze. Also the cake is way too sweet.

I made this for my husband who loves anything lemon and it turned out great. I followed the recipe exactly. The only problem I had was the cake did stick on one side of the pan but I think it was because I have no patience and didn't let it cool enough. Very tasty and will definitely make again.

the instructions and the picture don't match up.  the picture shows a cake cooled and removed from the pan and then glazed with a glaze other than the one listed. -  the instructions have you pouring the listed glaze onto the cake while still in the pan, right out of the oven.  since i printed the recipe without the picture, i made as written.  i let the cake cool completely in the pan then used a sharp knife to loosen the edges and carefully worked it out of the pan.  it came out beautifully and tasted amazing - if you love lemon this is the cake for you.

WOW! This was truly amazing! Like other reviewers, I didn't attempt to add the glaze until after the cake cooled and was out of the pan. Because of this, I had to much glaze and it was too thin. But it soaked in and the cake eas even better the next day. Next time, I'll make half the glaze and use less liquid so it's thicker. I alo heated the lemon juice before stirring it in the confection sugar (rather than boiling it).

I was looking for a recipe to mimic the lemon loaf at Starbucks, and o-my-god, I came close enough with this one.  Followed the recipe except I added the juice of one lemon and some zest into the batter, then cut out the glaze process because I thought it would be too sweet.  Made a few tablespoons of a simple glaze (fat-free half & half, conf. sugar and a bit of lemon zest) and drizzled it on top.  The cake was gorgeous, moist, lemony, and didn't taste like a mix.  Sooo delicious!

This cake was delicious and very moist.  I used the Baker's Joy, and I let the cake sit for an hour before turning onto a plate.  Had no problems with it coming out.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I was lazy and did not sift the powdered sugar, and I don't think it made any difference.  Will definitely make again.

I made this cake and sprayed my bundt pan wiyh cooking spray and it came out perfect. I only needed to cook it 35-40 min, instead of the 50 stated. Also, at the last minute, I noticed that I didn't have any powdered sugar, so I used lemon supreme flavored cake icing. I was nervous at first, that it would be either too sweet or too lemony, but I put the icing on when the cake was right out of the oven and it melted like a glaze and was perfect. You don't even need a whole container.

My family loved this cake.  It was so moist and delicious.  I made a mistake when preparing it and put 1/2 cup of real fresh lemon juice in the cake batter.  It turned out very good though, in fact I think it probably made the cake better.  I used fresh lemons from my tree in my backyard.  I would highly recommend this recipe to all my friends.

This is a really moist lemony cake. If you love lemon like I do you have to try this cake. I have made it several times now and everyone loves it.
