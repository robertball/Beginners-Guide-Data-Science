I am the original poster of the recipe.  The sweetness and sourness depends on the kind of pineapple and kind of vinegar used.  Please add more sugar or vinegar to taste just before serving.  Also, really lean pork cooks very quickly, so check at half time if you've scaled down the recipe.  Thanks.

I used RED and ORANGE bell peppers; and they came out so juicy and sweet that my kids ate them like they were candy!  I also BRINED the pork chops with kosher salt, sugar and water overnight before slow-cooking them.  My family and guests said that these were the BEST PORK CHOPS they ever had!!!  Fantastic recipe, Poookie.

Very good recipe. The pork chops were very tender and the vegatables and pinapple that was cooked with the chops were flavorful and unique. Will use this recipe again.

We liked this quite a bit.  It would have been a 5 star recipe for us if the sweet and sour flavor would have infused into the pork more.  I would imagine that marinating the pork in the sauce overnight would help, but that would have defeated the purpose of a quick and easy meal for me!  Also I cubed my chops into about 1" cubes.  I think I'll make them smaller next time.  I did make a few changes to the recipe.  Some due to lack of ingredients on hand, and others due to flavor.  I didn't have any carrots or celery, so I just omitted them.  I will add them when I make this again.  I also left out the sherry wine for the same reason, though the sauce was great as-is, so I don't think I'll add it in the future.  The biggest change I did was subbing a 8 oz. can of tomato sauce for the tomato paste.  I compensated for the extra liquid by adding quite a bit more cornstarch.  I added 1 tbsp. to the original sauce instead of the 1 tsp. that was called for, and then about 1/2 hour before it was done, I added an additional 2 tbsp. (which I mixed with some of the sauce before adding)to get it to a nice and thick consistancy.  I also think that if I would have used the tomato paste, we would not have liked the sauce as much.  It had a good balance of flavor using the tomato sauce, and I think we would have thought the paste would make it to "tomato-ey".  As for flavor changes, I upped the garlic to 1 tsp. and the same with the minced ginger.  Thanks for the recipe.  It was nice to have

The pork tasted great, it did not make a great sauce, but you need to cook it in all that for the pork to be so good.  I made another thicker sweet & sour sauce from this website to go over it and rice.  Great starter, just needs better sauce!!

Pookie - this is outstanding.  I'm very behind on my reviews but try to keep up with some of the current threads and I want you to know I have suggested this already about 5 or 6 times.

This turned out great, and normally I'm not a big pork fan! I cut out the mushrooms and used a few shortcuts like frozen bell pepper strips, ground ginger, and garlic powder.

This was ok.  It was a lot of work to cut up all the veggies.  I didn't really like the pineapple in this.  The leftovers were better the next day.  I probably won't make this again, but it's always fun to try new recipes.

Not what I was expecting. Tasted good but very bland and required doctoring before I served it.  Will likely not make again.

Did this in the pressure cooker for about 20 mins. Left out tomato paste. Husband LOVED it. I didn't think he would. Talked about a great dinner the next day.

this was an okay dish. Left out bell peppers due to family doesn't like them. was exspecting to taste like chinese sweet and sour pork and nothng like it.  My husband didn't think it wasn't bad it was edible. We couldn't figure out there is one ingredient that overpowers the taste but we couldn't put our finger on it.  Did like the minced pinapple in it though.

This was a very tasty meal and we enjoyed the variety of vegetables in this.  Was a bit disappointed though, I was expecting more of a sweet and sour taste to the sauce.

This really lacked a sweet and sour taste for me! The pork was incredibly tender, but I was disappointed overall. Hubbs thought it was okay.

I cubed the chops and added 2 Tablespoons of sugar. After I made this I noticed that the cooking directions didn't change when I changed the serving to 2. I set the slow cooker for 4 hrs on high. Result: dry meat. Also the preparation was30-40 minutes, not 10 minutes.

Great recipe.  Lots of ingredients, but easy to prepare. I used baby carrots, and red and green peppers.  Turned out great.  Nice, fast meal- all ingredients in my cupboard!

I did this up using cubed pork loin and since I was a bit short I added some skinless pork sausage that I had on hand and needed to use up.  I did brown the meat before putting it in the crockpot.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception that I had only red and yellow peppers on hand and I had two peppers, not just one.  I thought this was fantastic!  I have rarely enjoyed meat cooked in the slow cooker (I usually only do soups in it because I just don't like the meat texture after hours in the slow cooker)but I keep trying different recipes in the hopes of finding something I like.  This was it!!  Not too sweet, not too sour.  Everything was perfect.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Had nearly all of the ingredients - substituted fresh red pepper for the green, some red wine instead of the sherry wine, and dried chipotle chili pepper instead of the hot pepper sauce.  I think I will add a little more ginger the next time I make it.  But it was very good - served over brown rice. Definitely would use this one again sometime!

Split review on this. My mother did not care for it but I liked it. It was sweet and sour but had a vinegar after taste. I did not add sugar because it was already sweet so I added a tsp of baking soda it helped but I probably could have added some more.

Reminded me of sweet and sour from when I was a kid.  It was good, easy weekday food, but nothing that would garner rave reviews from my family or friends.

Need to use a fattier pork.....I used pork loin, and it was too dry, even thought I cooked it for 5 hours.  Might try it with chicken next time, and cook not so long.  Black pepper and white pepper??

Relative Easy to make.  Cubed pork works much better than full chops.  Made as directed, meat tender, however taste did not meet our expectations for Sweet and Sour.  We served with rice and noodles, fed about 6 folks.  Would try a different recipe next time.

Perfectly edible, but I found mine turned out soupy.  Because of this the flavor was washed out and yet, somehow, the pork seemed a little dry and flavorless.

I guess this was okay for a slow cooker.  I didn't really care if it wasn't a traditional sweet and sour pork but was looking for something easy to throw together with the right balance.
