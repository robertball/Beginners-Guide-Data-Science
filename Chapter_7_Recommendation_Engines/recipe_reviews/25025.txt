Two recommendations - cut the cherries into quarters for better distribution throughout the mix, and reduce the amount of frosting.  I think I made my frosting with 3 cups of powdered sugar and there was still too much!  I'd make just enough to put a pink drizzle over the top of the bars rather than coating the entire surface.

I just searched this recipe for fun on allrecipes as it is a family tradition for my husband's family.  They've been a Christmas tradition for as long as he can remember (as a boy and he's over 50 now lol).  They are loved by all, the trick it to cut them very very small so that the sweetness is not overpowering.  The joke in this family is that they were often made and frozen to have for Christmas, but the boys would get into the freezer and none would be left by Christmas.  Today they still eat them frozen half the time... give it a try!  Glad to see this recipe on here!

Very good, all the flavors come through. I chopped the cherries into small pieces with a food processor before putting them in, which helped to distribute them better.

I made these for Christmas, and they were an instant hit. Several people asked for the recipe as a must have at their own celebrations.

They were easy enouph to prepare, but I found with the addition of all that icing they were too sweet. Will either cut the icing by half or may try a cream cheese icing next time.

I will definitely make this again.  Our guests loved it.  I halved the ingredients for the drizzle and it was still too much.  Maybe next time I won't even bother with the drizzle.

I used unsweetened coconut and walnuts instead of pecans.  This was WAY too sweet for me, but I'm giving it a 4 instead of a 3 because the husband and kids loved it.

These bars are so good, there are no words to describe them, all I can say is that I could eat the whole pan in one sitting!

Absolutely fabulous..I used almonds instead of pecans and wow.  They didn't last long at all.
