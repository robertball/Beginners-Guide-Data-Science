Fabulous recipe! I am not much of a lover of fish because it is always too dry for me.  I especially found that adding a cover to the saute and again to the fish, I was able to control  the cooking. I added garlic in the saute since we grow the stuff and I love it. Forgot the pinch of salt and added it later but it did not seem to matter much since I salted and peppered the halibut beforehand (this step I believe is key). I also did not believe I had enough bacon oil when I went to pan fry the fish so I added   a bit of grapeseed oil to the pan. The fish was the best I've had. I would definitely make this again. Watch the video before cooking the f

This recipe was excellent! I didn't change a thing. I watched the video and cooked along with it. Very easy fast and tasty. the halibut steaks are big and I didn't think I would finish it , but the fish is very light.  I served a wedge of lettuce with blue cheese dressing along side. Will make this again!

Fabulous, very easy recipe.  We did not have the beans, so I used brussels sprouts instead, which I would recommend.  I halved the sprouts and then seared them in a pan while cooking the bacon.  Other than that, I followed the recipe as designed.  Definitely easy and awesome!

This was good. I did make some substitutions like mahi mahi for the halibut-it's cheaper and asparagus for the beans. 
It was super easy to make.

We really like this recipe.  I added a few capers and a little of the juice, as well as a splash of white wine.   With the lemon juice, the sauce was nicely piquant and the combination of flavors delicious.

I have to say, this was not so great.  It had a funky flavor that we couldn't quite place.  The only change I made was that I had halibut filets instead of steaks... maybe the skin flavored the fat a little and made the relish taste funky.  Not a keeper, unfortunately.

this is a fantastic & unusual dish - for once I managed to cook the halibut perfectly!  i only had bacon fat so added a bit of roasted garlic & sundried tomatos to the bean relish...yum.  the video was so simply & nicely done - it helped me feel confident in trying this out.  thank you.
