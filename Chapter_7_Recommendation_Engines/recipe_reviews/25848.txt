Mmm this was really really good. I didn't have any chocolate breakfast mix so I just added chocolate syrup and it tasted great. This was a little on the thin side, so I might add frozen bananas next time to make it thicker, and maybe add some malt powder to make it even richer. YUM:)

Although I liked the concept of this shake I wanted to 'tweak' it to make it a little healthier.  All natural peanut butter was used in place of the regular peanut butter, 1/2 cup of plain non-fat yogurt was used in place of most of the milk and finally I used a frozen banana in place of room temperature. Additions also included,  1 tablespoon of ground flaxseed and 1/2 scoop of soy protein powder. Eliminating most of the milk and using the yogurt really makes this a "shake" instead of a "drink" as some reviewers stated.  After tasting I added 1 tablespoon of organic agave for sweetness.  This does make a nice thick shake.

I'm 7 months pregnant and I LOVE THIS!! I make it in the morning as my breakfast. Only I don't measure anything.  I use a couple of packets of  french vanilla instant breakfast mix.  I freeze my bananas and i use probably 3 of them.  I usually start out with a cup of milk and then just add enough so it mixes well.  Then i add ice cubes. I use a heaping tablespoon of peanut butter. I'M NOT KIDDING IT TASTES JUST LIKE A MILKSHAKE. YUM!!  Oh, and mine makes quite a bit so my husband takes some while he's on his way to work.  He loves it also.

I would stay away from this recipe. I'm a big fan of Chocolate, Banana & Peanut Butter, but I did not care for this.

I made this for my boys today, for a quick pick-me-up midday. I only had Nestle Quick on hand, so I used that. Other than that, I left as is. Double thumbs up from my oldest, and he claimed I was the "Best Mom in The Whole World"! I will make this again.

I did change a few things...I omit ice cubes. I added a handful of Cherrios, use soy milk (vanilla) and use creamy peanut butter. My grandaughter has this every morning for breakfast and it is so good for her.

This was an 'ok' shake. Very very thin, I dont think it should be called shake. Maybe Chocolate-Banana-Peanut Butter DRINK. I used hershey's cocoa powder, and had to add 4 tablespoons of sugar. After I mixed all in blender, I put it in the freezer for about 30 minutes to thicken up.

I did not make this shake exactly as written, but the way I did make it was wonderful.  I put chocolate chips, frozen banana, peanut butter and enough milk to just cover the banana in the blender and pureed it until there were no more banana chunks.  There were fine little pieces of the chocolate chips in the shake and it was nice and thick even though there was no ice.  My husband said it tasted like drinking a peanut butter cup.  Yummy!

Tasted pretty good. However, i did make some adjustments because i thought the original recipe would be to runny, so instead of using two cups of milk, i used half a cup of milk and a half a cup of vanilla ice cream, and completely got rid of the ice  cubes, although i think that i should've kept them. Overall not so bad

Yummy!  You can add Nestle chocolate mix or Nutella instead of the other mix.  We make this quite often.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I made a high-calorie version (!) of this shake using vanilla ice cream and Special Dark chocolate syrup.  I followed Mary L's suggestion to puree the milk, ice cream and banana first and then add the PB (creamy) and syrup.  I skipped the step of adding ice because of the ice cream.  So delicious it was hard to put the glass down...

im a big chocolate with peanut butter fan.  as in, there is nothing better in the world than a lifetime supply of reeses cups.  next time, i think i will '86' the bananas and double the chocolate and peanut butter.  maybe add some malt powder to thicken it up too.  yumm.

I make this often for myself and my son. We love it. I usually substitute the instant breakfast for some Nestle Quick (powder form). I also use fat free milk and natural peanut butter. It's very delicious and slightly more healthy.

I make a similar shake, but use 1 cup non-fat milk, 1 whole banana, 2 TBS smooth peanut butter and 1 scoop chocolate protein mix. It helps to puree the milk & banana first, then add PB & Choc mix. Finally, I add about 8 ice cubes and blend till smooth. Deeelish!

DELICIOUS... except that it's pretty thin for a milk shake. might want to add more ice and then play with your other ratios a little bit. but then again, that's how i always make my shakes--to taste, not by exact measurements

I'm sorry, but we didn't really like this.  It was waay too peanut-buttery.  I don't think we'll be making this again, but if you try it, start with a small amount of peanut butter and work your way up.

this recipe was PERFECT! the flavors were nice and balanced. i used Smuckers Chocolate Syrup instead of the instant powder. if you are going to use chocolate syrup, i suggest putting it in last so that it doesnt sink to the bottom too quickly.

Yum, this was good! I only made a couple changes. Halved the recipe, used a frozen banana so no ice, used natural creamy peanut butter and organic cocoa mix. Will definitely make this again! Loved it!

this is great!! i didnt have any chocolate syrup or instant breakfast mix, so i used Hershey's Cocoa powder(unsweet) and put in 1/3 c. To make sure the shake turned out sweet and not bitter i put in 2/3 c. of sugar. I also added more ice than aske as well. Thanks for a great recipe!

I love this shake! It is thin, but I just wanted milk, and no icecream or yogurt.  I used regular peanut butter, and hershey syrup. Drank the shake with a straw.  Great recipe and ejoyed it so much. Will make again.

The flavor is very good, but it isn't really a 'shake'.  It has the consistency of chocolate milk.  I was thinking it might be better to use some chocolate ice cream instead of chocolate Instant Breakfast powder, and less milk.  Other than the consistency, though, it's really tasty.

My daughter loves this for breakfast or lunch. I use vanilla carnation breakfast drink and add a tablespoon of chocolate syrup. She likes creamy peanut butter instead of crunchy. I use a frozen banana to make it more like a real shake consistency. If it's the only thing she's having for breakfast, I add a raw, pastured egg ; it gives her extra nutrition and makes it so creamy.

This is a good shake to whip up quickly in the mornings or after school. It's really rather healthy if you consider all the ingredients separately, and it's thick enough that you don't miss the Ice Cream. I use Ovaltine chocolate malt mix.

This shake is so delicious. I didn't have any bananas so I used oatmeal. The oatmeal made it really thick. For two bananas 1/2 cup was a little too much, so I would use 1/3 cup or 1/4 cup.

This is a great shake - my morning banana had gone brown so I decided it would taste better blended. Didn't have any breakfast chocolate so instead I used Ibarra Mexican chocolate - amazing!

This was delicious! I have had similar smoothies, but it's always nice when one turns out anyhow. For the flavor, it's nice that it has healthy ingredients in it. I used a frozen banana, which I highly recommend! For the chocolate powder I used sugar-free Carnation instant chocolate breakfast. For the peanut butter I only had creamy, so I just added a few peanuts to it. I will make this again. I made 1/2 recipe and got 2 small servings.

I just made the shake and it was amazing! Instead of the instant breakfast mix I used sugar free chocolate pudding mix. Also I used creamy peanut butter.It turned out thick,which was ok because I like mine thick.Here is a suggestion try pouring it over vanilla ice cream it's amazing!

Yum! Peel and freeze the bananas first in ziploc baggies. (break into 3-4 pieces first so it's easier to blend)Then you can omit the icecubes. (I used creamy peanut butter)

I was trying to find something high in protein to eat for breakfast and this was great!! My husband liked it as well! I used  1 cup of skim milk and 1 cup of vanilla soy milk: vitamin fortified. The soy milk gives more nutrients and adds more of a sweet nutty flavor. I will have this every morning before work! Thank you thank you!!

I didn't want to make quite so much so I used 3 Tbsp Instant Breakfast 'Dark Chocolate' powder mix and 1 cup non-fat milk, 1 banana, 1 tbsp peanut butter and 1 CUP of ice.  Perfectly yummmmmy.
