DELICIOUS! I only have a few suggestions: I like my pepperoni a little crispy so the next time I make this I will cook the hamburger and pepperoni together.  Drain it then add the rest of ingredients.  (My pepperoni was just too soggy.)  I also put the cheese on top and then topped with more pepperoni.  It just gave it a nice presentation.  And lastly, you will definately need more spegetti sauce.  I added 3/4 of another jar.  My 5 year old loved this recipe.  Next time I will make some garlic bread too.

A good tip to cut down on the greasiness of the pepperoni is to microwave the slices between paper towels for 30 seconds. The slices are still pliable and you wont be adding all that fat into the casserole. As written the recipe is pretty basic, I wanted to punch up the flavor. I cooked the beef, drained the fat and added chunks of red onion, minced garlic, red pepper flakes and oregano. I cooked that just for a minute or two. I used a pound of pasta because I think just 8 ounces is not enough for all of the meat in the recipe. I added sliced black olives also. It turned out good.

I was looking for supper ideas and I found this recipe. It was so good! It was like a lasagna-type casserole. I browned the ground beef with seasoning salt, a dash of chili powder, hot sauce, and Italian seasoning. I added chopped pepperoni to the beef as well as chopped red onion, browned it all together, then added the mixture to the rotini with a jar of pasta sauce mixed with hot sauce. I topped it with mozza and a bit of cheddar, and sprinkled with a bit more Italian seasoning. I took the casserole out when the cheese was browned, and I sprinkled parmesan cheese on top. This recipe is basic and can very easily be tweaked, you don't have to follow the directions to the t if you don't want to. Next time I will add mushrooms and peppers to the casserole.

This was a very good basic dish and my son and husband liked it.  I added Italian sausage and fresh mushrooms and it was very good.  I also froze a portion of the casserole before baking;  I thawed it later and baked, and it was delicious!

My whole family loved this recipe.  The sliced pepperoni was sticking together when I mixed it in though.  So, I placed in on top before putting on the cheese, and that worked better.

Pretty good recipe. I was in a pinch for dinner, so I decided to try this one out. I used whole grain rotini pasta instead of regular. I used two 15 oz cans tomato sauce instead of the jar of spaghetti sauce (I didn't experience any dryness this way). I also used 2 cups mozerella along with about a cup of cheddar, and this turned out to be perfect. I didn't have any pepperoni, but neither I or my husband really missed them. My husband also doesn't like biting into onions, so I just used onion & garlic powder along with some Italian seasoning. I cooked the ground beef in extra virgin olive oil and we both agreed it was a good choice. The end result was tasty enough and easy to make. Next time I will toy around more with the seasoning.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a very decent dish!  My 7YO had 3 helpings, while my 2YO vacuum barely ate.  I agreed with other users and used a full 16 oz bag of pasta (shells) and 1-28 oz can of pasta sauce mixed with 1 jar of pizza sauce.  I added onion, bell pepper, and more italian seasonings.  I used the stated amount of cheese.  We definitely enjoyed it--I made two 8x8 pans...one for dinner and one to freeze.  This recipe still needs something though.  I will keep this recipe and play with it each time.  Thanks for a great kick-start recipe!

This was VERY easy to make and tasted great! My husband and five year old son absolutely loved it! I added some extra sauce and extra cheese, not to say it needed it though! I just love it!

This was a great dish. I used pizza sauce instead of spagetti sauce to give it more pizza flavor. I also have kids who are not big fans of pepparoni so I bought the mini ones already cut up from the bag. They loved them.

I really loved this recipe. It was quick, easy, and tasty! As a busy mom, I'm always looking for new recipes that wont take up my whole day to make. My husband and my son loved it! I snuck in some onions, bell peppers and mushrooms. I think the only thing I will do differently next time is use turkey pepperoni, the regular was really greasy, but still very tasty!

My family really liked this.  Definitely a keeper!  I followed other reviewers suggestions and cooked the pepperoni in with the beef.  I used 28oz of pasta sauce and 6 oz of pizza sauce.  I didn't want it to be dry and it was perfect, not too saucy.  This recipe is a great base, I can see being able to make a lot of changes to the ingredients and still have it turn out yummy.  Thanks ATHIELEN!

This is a very easy dish to make, my kids loved it.  I only made a few changes.  I added red pepper flakes, a little tobasco, garlic powder, and dried parsely to the meat as it cooked.  I cut up a couple of mushrooms and added them to half (for my hubby).  It turned out great!

The reason I gave it 3 stars is because it tasted nothing like pizza... all we tasted was spaghetti.  The beef overpowered the pepperoni & you only knew you were eating a piece of pepperoni if you saw it on your fork before putting it in your mouth.  I think I will attempt this dish again, I will only use 1/2 pound of ground beef & double the pepperoni to 8oz & see if it makes it more like I would expect a 'pizza pasta' to taste.

I noticed black olives in the photo but not listed in the recipe.  I added black olives, garlic powder, italian seasoning, and I added a bag of frozen cut yellow squash.  I served with Texas toast and a salad.  Quick, easy, yummy - Thanks!

C-.
This is an okay recipe- quick and easy but honestly, kind of unhealthy and full of preservatives and processed foods. I felt guilty after making and eating it (esp for my health conscious family) because the jar of spaghetti sauce and pepperoni is very unhealthy- salt, preservatives, etc etc. Next time could make sauce from scratch and also not include the pepperoni to make it more healthy. Thank tho

This is definitely a keeper.  My family LOVED it.  We have a couple "picky eater" boys and they thought it was "the best".  I did use turkey pepperoni so there wasn't a grease factor.

My family liked it no complaints from them- just me. This was a good dish, but like others have said it was missing something- perhaps pizza sauce instead of speghetti sauce and maybe garlic. I know I like garlic on my pizza.

Great starter recipe to add your fav toppings. I used sweet italian sausage instead of hamburger meat and a package "mini" pepperoni (that's all the store had) and I pre-cooked the pepperoni as other reviewers suggested. I also added about 2 cloves fresh garlic, about a 1/2 tbspn. of italian seasoning, fresh onion, fresh green pepper and fresh mushrooms. I also added more cheese on top (didn't measure, just did handfuls till it looked right -but probably about 3 cups). I only used one jar of pasta sauce (Newman's Sockarooni) and the consistency was that of a pasta "casserole". Next time I will add a can of italian diced tomatoes to make it perfect. I served it with the good ol' standard -salad & garlic bread. Nice and filling.

Very tasty when you use tomato sauce and italian seasoning, then add additional herbs/spices to taste for extra flavor. Pasta sauce would probably be just as good, too, but we were out. Wouldn't change a thing.

This  was a very good basic recipe. I made my sauce instead of using canned or jarred. I used 1 jar pizza sauce, 1 can of tomato sauce and 1 can of diced tomatoes with oregano, basil, and garlic. I added to the sauce more garlic powder, 1tbsp oregano and 1 tbsp basil and a few shakes of ground sage. I did not have any dryness like others have posted. Next time, I think I will add more pizza toppings. My family really enjoyed this meal.

Easy to make with delicious results. I did find it to be a bit drier than I wanted but the flavor was excellent. I will certainly make it again and use more spaghetti sauce next time. I ate some the next day reheated in the microwave and it was just as tasty, if not more so!

This is VERY tasty, especially for such a simple recipe.  And there are so many things you can do to change it up -- add peppers, olives, and mushrooms for more of a 'supreme pizza' taste OR omit the meat and add even more veggies for a 'veggie pizza'.  Thanks for sharing this idea.  I think it's a great way to satisfy that pizza craving I get now and then.

Great recipe!  Very kid friendly too - my 3 year old loved it!  We used a little less beef and will use a little more cheese next time - but other than that it was delicious!!!

Kid approved and versatile to suite pickier eaters  add or leave out --whatever you like on pizza you can put in this.  I doubled it and froze a pan for a busy weeknight and both ways it was devoured.

Thank you for the recipe! This was really good.  I didn't think it tasted like pizza but it was a zippy tasty pasta dish! :-)

Was a big hit with my boyfriend and his buddies! I made a few changes. I omitted the onion and put garlic salt and Italian seasonings on the ground beef instead. I also used Italian style cheese instead of mozzarella. I think I made add sausage and mushrooms the next time I make this recipe :) I am looking forward to making it again!

What I love about this recipe is you can adapt it to whatever you have on hand, or whatever your favorite pizza toppings are (bacon and pineapple anyone?)  The combo that I think works best with this is green pepper, mushrooms, and black olives; and as with many other reviewers I replace pepperoni with Italian sausage.  Sooo yummy!    PS: Don't forget the garlic!

I made this for the first time last night and substituted ground turkey for the beef and it turned out perfect. My boyfriend who is a pizza addict devoured it!!! I thought it was pretty good but next time I plan on using more seasonings to add more depth to the taste. I used a plain spaghetti sauce so next time I'll try a Ragu Sauce like garlic and herbs or something I am also going to put cheddar cheese as well as Mozarella on my next pizza pasta. But overall A+ for ease and most of the ingredients are already in the fridge.

It tasted OK. I don't really think I liked the noodles that were used. Next time I may use a different shape. My husband loved it though!

It was really good but could use some spices or something to add more flavor, and it was kind of dry so it could probably use some more sauce.

I would give this 5 stars but only after a few additions to the recipe.  First I didnt have spaghetti sauce so I used pizza sauce (which was yummy!) I also added 1/2 a green pepper & onion and 3 minced garlic cloves to the ground beef when frying. Then I followed the directions from there!  Very good, served with cheesy bread.  The kids loved it.  Thanks for the start to a great recipe!

This recipe was great!! It was quick and easy to put together and throw into the oven. However, I did make a couple of my own changes. I didn't use the ground beef or the pepperoni, I used italian sausage instead and it still turned out really good.

Delish! I left out the onions and used onion powder, I also left out the sausage.  After I topped it with cheese I put pepperoni and olives on top to make it look kind of like a pizza!

Great recipe that can be tweaked to everyone's favorites and it seems to be a real crowd pleaser.  I made this recipe in bulk for my sons orchestra potluck and it was completely gone before we left for home.  Thanks for sharing.

This was a really good recipe!! I thought it was pretty simple to make.  If I were to make it again I would probably add a little more cheese to it. I thought the pepperonis added to the taste too.

Mediocre at best. Despite the pepperoni and onion it didn't really taste much different than American chop suey, which requires less prep and fewer ingredients.

I used whole wheat penne pasta, and I cut the recipe in half, but left the pasta at 8oz. I'm glad I did, because it wouldn't have been enough otherwise. Instead of the spaghetti sauce, ground beef, and onion, I used some leftover sauce from the World's Best Lasagna recipe on this site. It was amazing. My 1 year old couldn't get enough of it.

Smell of the Recipe is delicious....But I did make a minor change.  as my family Hates pepperoni, I substituted browned sausage, as sausage pizza is a favorite here.  Easy prep for no-fuss dinner.......I would recomend.  Gave it 4 stars because i changed it....

I thought this was good and I loved the simplicity.  I did add more sauce though to juice this up a bit more.  Also, it's too hot right now to turn on the oven, so I just simmered this in our large electric skillet and put the cheese on to melt for the last five minutes.  I thought it was great; the family just said so-so.

This was a good base, but I did doctor it up a bit for our likings.... I used 1 Lb. rotini, did 1/2 Lb. Italian sausage with about 3/4 Lb. ground beef, cooked the pepperoni (also cut all the pieces in half) with the ground beef and added a 15 oz. can of tomato sauce to the spaghetti sauce (used Bertolli 5 cheese). Also, I pulled this out at 25 minutes and it was a little too done... I think 20-22 minutes would do the trick. I couldn't imagine how it would have been if I had left it in the 30 minutes, it would have been completely burned! We like it a lot, but might try to layer the pasts mixture and cheese next time... kinda like a pizza lasagna. Thanks for sharing this recipe!!

As a family of 8 finding a dish that pleases everyone is difficult. Six people in my family liked this dish(my husband wanted more "toppings" added to his)my picky picky boys said it was ok and they would eat it but it didn't knock their socks off but six out of eight is pretty good thus the five stars

I did not have any pepperoni so made it without.  I added red peppers and fried them with the onions/ground beef.  Also, I added a can of tomato soup to the large jar of spaghetti sauce and it was the perfect amount and flavor.   Very very good!

I have to be honest, I didn't care for this very much.  I added some sausage to the ground beef, per my husband's request but other than that, followed the recipe.  For me, I would give it 2 stars but since my husband has had it 2 nights in a row and plans on having it again tonight, I gave it 3 (no offense to my precious hubby but he'll eat anything that involves pasta and cheese!).  

I prefer ziti over this and will probably stick with that next time, with some pepperoni thrown in.

Incredibly easy, and a basic variation on cooked pasta.  I tend to avoid boiling the pasta by cooking it in with everything.  You can do this by adding some water (about a cup per 16 oz of pasta), covering the pasta so it steams until cooked, then uncover to allow the cheese to melt.  It took about 45 minutes to cook the pasta with this method, then another 5-10 to melt the cheese.  I used sausage instead of ground beef and halved the recipe--all except the pasta, which I kept to half a box.  I tossed in a few veggies:  chopped broccoli and yellow pepper.  Thanks for the recipe!

It was very nice, i added some black olives and green peppers. I mixed some cheddar cheese and a little bit parmigiano reggiano) and topped it with some dry thyme over the mozarrella cheese. it tasted exactly like the Super supreme pizza.

The only suggestion I have for next time is to add some Italian seasoning and/or some garlic.  Other than that, it was easy and delicious!

EASY EASY EASY!  I did make one small addition...I added a can of diced tomatos!  My boys loved the recipe and I loved that I could make it ahead so that all I needed to do was pop it in the oven after a long day of work!  I will make this again for sure!

Made this last night for my husband and son they loved it! My 21 month old had 2 bowls :). Only thing I changed was added extra cheese on top, didn't need it we just love cheese. Great recipe, super easy!

Over all it was good. But it was dry. There wasn't enough sauce to give it taste. The flavor just wasn't there. I would add more sauce and many some seasoning next time.

This was really delicious! I loved the touch of spice the pepperoni gave it..if I ever make this again, though, I may use a little bit more cheese to hold it all together better, and possibly add cheese into the mix instead of just on top.

This is excellent.  My kids usually won't eat food that is "all mixed up", but they ate this and asked for seconds.  Same with hubby...he's very much a meat, veggie and potato man, but he loved this!  I'm making it again tonight because it's fast & easy and we're in a rush :-)))

This was DELISH! My fam loves when I decide to do a new recipe.  I did take the advise of others and fried the pepperoni with the ground beef - not only cut down on oil but also gave the beef a great flavor.  Also added a dash or two of cayenne pepper.  Recipe is GREAT as written (always try 2 make as written 1st time) only thing might add next time is mushrooms & maybe green peppers.  THANK YOU for an awesome recipe which is NOW in rotation at my house by popular demand!

SOOO good, but I did not bake it. I bought the Ragu brand marinara and simmered it with ground beef that had been cooked with bell peppers and seasonings and I then added a pack of mini-pepparonis and tossed over rotini with mozzarella cheese. My daughter loved it!

As written, I rate this a four star because it is a little runny. I have added a 6 oz. can of tomato paste to resolve that problem. I use a quiche pan so that I don't get runover problems. My family likes the taste of sausage better than hamburger so I will be making that substitution. I top with the cheese but then I lay the pepperoni on top of that so it looks like a pizza. Also, I use about 2 cups of dried pasta.

This recipe totally ROCKED!! For my family. Was simple to do, I doubled the recipe and put it a huge roasting pan. Added olives to the top and yummy!! I Found a 5 ounce bag of Hormel Mini Pepperoni slices so I totally used 2 bags. It was awesome. I love the mini pepperoni. My family had huge helpings. We will definitely make over and over. Thanks

My family loved this dish, I did edit the ingredients somewhat though. The only reason I'm am rating it 4 stars is because it was not my favorite dinner, but my husband and children thought it was wonderful (I'm not a big pizza fan either!). I made it a little healthier. I used whole wheat rotini, ground turkey and turkey pepperoni. I added a can of diced tomatoes, some oregano and some basil to the jar spaghetti sauce. I layered the rotini on the bottom of a sprayed baking dish then put a small amount of shredded parmesan over the rotini. Then I added the turkey/sauce mix on top and covered that with a 1/2 cup of fat free shredded mozzarella cheese. My family requested that I make this regularly, so it was a hit.  Thank you so much for the recipe!

This is really good starter recipe.  I use turkey pepperoni to cut down on fat and add minced garlic.  I didn't have time to put in the oven and it was better that way.  I cooked it all on top of the stove and it didn't seem dry as other complained after baking in the oven.  Top with cheese and cover for five minutes before serving!

OMG!! This was SO good!!! I added a little sugar to sweeten the sauce.  Also added garlic powder and Parmesan cheese. Instead of adding the pepperoni to the mix I put it on top. Just made it prettier. Served with a salad. Perfect!

This was good, the whole fam ate it. I think a little more pepperoni would be nice. I agree with some other reviewers, I cooked my pepperoni a little in the microwave so it was crispy and you can drain the grease.

I used ground chicken and omitted the pepperoni. It still turned out great and flavorful, especially since I added in some green peppers, spinach, and a bit of shredded cheese to the sauce mixture. Very easy and tasty.

It was wonderful! I had to double it because I have a big family, and served it with Garlic bread. The only thing I would say to add would be Ether salt or Garlic salt, because it needs it, but overall the combo is great! It will definately be added to our regular menu now!

I was a little nervous about this one until the taste test.  Just before the ground beef was totally cooked I through in the pepperoni and cooked it a bit to cook out some of the pepperoni grease. Then I drained the ground beef and pepperoni mixture. It came out great and the whole family enjoyed it.

I don't know what I missed here but this was not good.  It tasted just like those ingredients together, did not come through as an entree.  Maybe I had higher hopes, scrapping this one but appreciate you sharing

This was a nice change from spaghetti, but still just as low cost. I used rigatoni as that is what I had on hand. One jar of sauce didn't look like enough so I added another. I also added bell peppers and garlic with the hamburger and onion. My whole family LOVED it and my 4 year asked for it again tomorrow. This is definitely a keeper :)

So good, so quick!!  I added some Alpine Touch (Montana's special spice!) And I added WAY more sauce... and a bit of italian sausage.  Almost forgot, my girls love pepperonis, so we added an 8 ounce package!  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Family really enjoyed this.  I did microwave the pepperoni for a few seconds to get rid of a ton of grease first.  This was quick, easy and a hit.

This was great.  Because I am on a tight time budget, I look for fast meals and this was perfect.  It was very easy to make.  The only thing I did differently was quarter the pepperoni.  Will make again!

This is pretty tasty. I jazzed it up with oregano, garlic and red pepper.  I also used pizza sauce instead of spaghetti sauce, and an entire extra can!  I like my food wet!  My one year old loved this - the rest of the family thought it was just okay.  I might make again with more alterations.

I added green pepper and didn't follow the exact amounts (family of five here), but it turned out wonderful! I have a generally picky family and they're all in love with it.
Also very easy on the dishes..one pot, one pan and the baking dish..much nicer than many other recipes!

This was very good!  I used pepperoni instead of "pepperoni sausage", and it gave it a nice flavor.  It will be added to my monthly rotation!

I have actually been making this dish for a long time and never realized it was on here as an actual recipe! I use some of these ingredients, however, I use pizza sauce, italian sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, bacon bits (sometimes), mozzarella cheese and MINI pepperonis. I don't bake mine. I cook the sausage then throw in the other pizza toppings, except cheese. Cook rotini pasta. Add sauce to meat mixture and then combine with pasta. I add the cheese last. I will be trying my way baked the next time!

I've just made it for our lunch and it was fantastic. I've only change a few things - no sausage, only meat and as well bechamel. Now I have totally full and I can only sit a rest and wait to eat the rest of pasta.

I made this last night for dinner. I believe it makes a lot more than 6 servings honestly. It's a basic, easy dish, and it'll be great to take to work for the next few days. It was a little bland, though. I'm going to try and spice it up next time.

Very good!  A quick and easy dish to prepare.  Made it as written the first time and loved it, the next time I added italian seasoning and used sweet italian sausage in place of pepperoni, it was good too.  Excellent with homemade white bread.

Excellent recipe. I mixed breakfast sausage with lean hamburger. I also added bell pepper and 3 cloves of  garlic to the mix when cooking meat. I didn't have mozzarella cheese so layered some pepper jack cheese and small amount of cheddar. Amazed that it really smelled like pizza when I removed it from the oven.

This is a very basic recipe, my husband and I thought it needed an extra kick. Next time i think i will use italian sausage instead of ground beef. I took other's advice and cooked the pepporoni before hand, other wise it would have been way too soggy for my taste. Overall it's good to start with.

Great Recipe! Taste delicious!! Being a vegetarian, I substituted the meat for soy meat and the pepperoni for tofu italian sausage. Also, in addition to the onion, I added and seasoned the soy meat with red, yellow, orange peppers, garlic, broccoli, ground pepper, seasoning salt (adobo), italian seasoning, pizza seasoning, cilantro. Loved this recipe, it is easy to make and the ingredients are usually on my pantry. I'll do this again, next time with mushrooms too.

My daughter had seconds, that's when I know I've made a good recipe.  I did add a can of pizza sauce with the spaghetti though and it made it really moist.  Also used some Sharp cheddar with the mozz and added some onion onion, salt, and pepper to the meat.  I always use ground turkey and turkey pepperoni and had no problem with extra grease.

cool twist on pasta and pizza, but i recommend using a  typical Polish pizza ketchup instead of the sauce, you can pick one up at a local Polish deli.

Very nice, easy recipe.  Instead of pepperoni, I cooked some Italian sausage with ground turkey.  Seasoned it a little.  I did 4 8oz cans of tomato sauce instead of spag/pizza sauce.  Mixed probably half C of cheese in with the pasta, meat and sauce and topped with the rest.  It was a little tomatoey, next time I will add more spices to the sauce.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was very easy and quick but my family didn't really LOVE it. They ate it but if I make it again I will probably twist it a little, add more pepporoni and maybe some other cheeses.

My 4 year old really loved this especially since it was made with the "unicorn noodles" so we now call it unicorn cassarole.  I didnt change anything just added a few extra spices for my liking and sauteed the pepperoni as suggested by another person. it was yum :)

This was a Great and simple recipe! I also topped it with some extra pepperoni which made it look great. I was excited that the taste lived up to the look. My husband and I both loved it and had leftovers the next night. Definitely a recipe that will be used again in my house!

I fixed this dish and it was great. I cut my pepperoni up and cooked it with my groundbeef and onions and drain it after cooking so it would not be so greasy.

I'm not much of a chief, this is why it came out bad for me. The bottom part of the pasta was just great, even better the next day, but the top was dry, hard and tasteless. I will try to prepare this dish later down the road though.  ~Tuwile, the teen that can't cook, but at least he tries.

Delicious.  Even my 2 daughters, who rarely like the same meal, enjoyed this.  I used spaghetti noodles as that's all I had and omitted the pepperoni since I didn't have any.

It was good, but pepperoni slices make it kind of odd. I'd recommend using pepperoni chunks instead.

This dish is extremely easy to make and customize to your family's tastes.  We added mushrooms, olives and a can of chopped tomatoes to make this more our own.  This isn't a noodle and sauce dish, but rather a casserole type dish and thus I felt that the drier texture was appropriate and more lasagna-like.  However, this dish could definitely use a flavor boost and next time we'll be adding more seasoning to the beef when we cook it and chopped garlic to the sauce.

Made this for my 2 boys. It was quick and easy-I usually have this ingredients on hand. I like it because it's a little more hearty than regular spaghetti. To make it more creamy, add a few spoonfuls of ricotta cheese to the pasta mix-so good!

I give this 5 stars! I made it on a whim using only what I had in my cupboards [substituted sausage for pepperoni since that is what we had] and everyone loved it! Everyone went back for seconds, and it was great because we were looking for something different.  I also added some chopped garlic to the meat and some sliced mushrooms on top!

The peperoni was the magic ingredient and I pre-cooked it as advised by others as well as added fresh basil, dried oregano and minced garlic after draining the fat off the cooked ground beef.  I then added the sauce and simmered for about 10 minutes before adding the remaing ingredients.  I also added about 2/3 c. moz to the main mixutre in addition to the toppong.  My family loved it.

I added oregeno, garlic, parsley, and italian seasonings to this dish.  I topped it with more pepperoni and black olives.  Great for when you are trying to decide what to do with a lb of hamburger.

I have made this multiple times since discovering this recipe about 2 months ago.  My boyfriend loves this!  The only thing I add is a can of diced tomatoes and I use a blend of cheddar and mozarella cheese.  I made it last night with ground turkey and turkey pepperoni, and it was still really good!  :)

My entire family loves this one!  Even my father who is the pickiest man alive.  It was easy to prepare and make, and took no time at all.  It is great for the busy day with no time for supper.  I made a few changes to fit my families likings, which was to leave out the ground beef but add ground sausage and also I used egg noodles instead of the rotini.

The first time I made it I followed the recipe exactly and it was wonderful! My hubby loved it. The second time I made it I subbed my homemade sauce for the jarred sauce and it wasn't nearly as good. Go figure! So now I always buy a jar of premade sauce and it's a family favourite! Thanks for this one, it's a keeper. :)

Very good and much easier than lasagna. I used leftover spaghetti sauce made with Italian sausage and added the pepperoni. Also added garlic and dried basil. Leftovers reheated well also.

I loved this recipe.  I did add a jar of pizza sauce since many people suggested adding more spaghetti sauce so it was not so dry.  I used turkey pepperoni and added fresh garlic, oregano and crush red pepper.  It was easy and fast and my family loved it.

I used a mix of fusili and rotini because I had a little bit of both on hand, and instead of a jarred sauce used a can of diced tomatoes and a can of tomato paste. I didn't taste anything "pizza" about this dish, so next time I'll add some veggies and the dish will maybe live up to its name. Otherwise, it's a simple pasta dish.

This is a great alternative to plain old spaghetti that my family really, really loved. I added garlic to the onion and ground beef mixture, and then topped the dish with fresh basil and parmesan under the shredded cheese. I did omit the pepperoni and it was still terrific. Definitely add the parmesan, it adds great flavor!

I love this recipe. It's extremely tasty and exceptionally easy... Not to mention all the ingredients are in most peoples cabinets. 

This recipe is also great for adding your own "flavor" and I guarantee it'll still come out great.

The only thing I did different was add hot Italian sausage because I didn't have the pepperoni on hand. It came out delicious and I plan on making it this way from now on.  You'll have to use extra sauce because one can is NOT going to be enough. 

It's one of those recipes that will go into rotation at least a couple times a month.

Very good recipe. My kids loved it!  To cut back on the fat from the peperonni microwave it for 30 seconds, with paper towels between each layer of peperonni. This is a keeper!

This was so GOOD! We are a large family so I had to make it for 8. I added my own homemade spagetti sauce using fresh oregano and basil, and garlic and I added about 2 cups more sauce than recipe called for. We also added more pepperoni on top for a bit of crunchiness. It was so amazing! My Whole family loved it, which is no small feat! I will Definitly be making this one over and over again! Thanks for the great recipe!!

Good easy recipe.  My family loved it.  My husband suggested adding maybe a little salt or something to spice it up a bit, a little more cheese and pepporoni.

This is a really good and quick meal. I didn't have any pepperoni, so I subbed some sweet italian sausage. I will definately make this again when I have all the right ingredients! The kids loved it! Thanks for sharing!

This is the best "make ahead" recipe for all working moms! Made it the night before and added all the ingreidents plus all the pizza veggies, mushrooms, red bell pepper, onion, black olives, parmesean cheese, and some crushed red pepper. My husband and 2 year old devoured it so I be adding this to my busy week day meal rotation.

Very Good! As with another viewer suggested, I too cooked the beef and the pepperoni together and drained well.  I did add some garlic powder,pepper,seasoned salt while cooking the beef and pepperoni. My husband and I love it. Thanks!

This was really good, and simple.  I didn't have enough cheese, I used about 1/2 c of Mozzarella and a 1/2 c of Cheddar and I thought it was fine.  I like it with the pepperoni- I cut mine into quarters.

I have made this so many times now and it's always a hit! I do add mushrooms but otherwise don't change a thing. This is one of my husbands favorite meals, and I love that it's quick. Thanks for a wonderful recipe that has become a family favorite!

Not bad - put the sliced turkey pepperoni on the top so it would get crispy and used pizza sausage instead of ground beef.  Could have used about 1/2 jar more of the spaghetti sauce and I think I would have preferred mostaccioli noodles.

I loved this recipe.  I have tried others similiar, and this was by far the best!  It is easy to fix in a hurry, which is a must in my household.  I did add a little extra sauce myself and used a traditional pizza sauce with the spaghetti sauce which I think gives more of a pizza feel.  I also cut my pepperoni into smaller quarters to integrate it into the pasta more.  Again, I loved it

I made this dish tonight. It was yummy. I used whatever pasta I had and used fresh mushrooms and less pepperoni and I added a layer of cheddar cheese some pasta then the rest of the toppings. I also added some olives. It was good. I think I'm going to add more cheese next time though. :) It was good!

I like this recipe.  It is fast and easy to make.  I would probably add a small can of chopped black olives next time.  I used the 3.5 oz pack of pepperoni slices and cut the slices into 4ths.  That worked well as the pieces were not too big and overpowering.  I also put the cheese on top and I liked the crust-like top it made.  Great dish for kids.

This is not the most unique recipe we've ever had but it was delicious and I was thrilled with the ease of this recipe. I did use Italian sausage in lieu of the hamburger and added some chopped green bell peppers. Also, I just mixed it all together (cheese & all) and baked. Everyone was thrilled with this one and I loved how fast I was in and out of the kitchen! Thanks Anna!

This was great & my husband loved it! But...I did make changes (what a shock!). I used pizza sauce for the spaghetti sauce, sausage for the hamburger, added some sliced black olives, sliced fresh mushrooms, and some chopped green pepper. Yummy and very easy.

Too many pepperoni 's for my taste so next time I'll cut those down. I was the only one that ate it. My 10 year old said it was gross just because they saw noodles with pepperoni. Too bad because the taste was amazing.

It was okay.  Maybe it depends on the spagetti sauce you use.  I used Marinana.  Made the recipe  as called for,  My husband and I found it  average.  Needs more flavor.  I'd  not make it again.

Easy to make and you can put just about anything in this!  The only deviation I made from the current recipe is I did microwave the pepperoni to get some of the grease cooked off.  Next time I make it I plan on using italian sausage, black olives and mushrooms.

I liked this recipe, but not as much as I thought I would. I read the reviews prior to making this casserole and I see why one person added a jar of pizza quick sauce, mine turned out quite dry. I also used the small pepperonis instead of the large ones and that was a good choice. I also cooked the pepperonis along with the ground beef so I could drain off as much excess grease as possible. All in all it was tasty, however next time I'll add more seasonings to give it a bit more pizzazz!

Made it and everyone loved it.  I added 8 oz of mushrooms because we always order our pizza with mushrooms.  Next time I will layer the pepperoni on top of the pasta to keep it from clumping together, then top it with the cheese.
Highly recommend.

I have been making this for forty years. I cook the hamburg, pepperoni, mushrooms and chopped green peppers together. Drain, then add the sauce, pasta, and some mozzarella to the mixture.  Put in a casserole dish, top with remaining mozzarella, and bake.
Hint: For the pasta, I use a mixture of spirals, small seashells, or the trio combination.

I loved it! Was looking for something different to make. Changes I made were  to omit pepperoni cuz I don;t  like it and added mushrooms and black olives. Will definitely make again.

I enjoyed this. I used a 14 oz box of pasta, 1/2 pound of Italian sausage, and a little extra pasta sauce. I also sautéed mushrooms, diced bell pepper, garlic  and onions separately and then added them to the sauce. I topped the casserole with sliced black olives and a bit of shredded cheddar on top of the mozzarella. This was even better the next day as leftovers.

Excellent!  Made as written and the family loved it.  So many ways this could be switched up and still be great- sub Italian sausage for the beef, mix in some ricotta or additional mozzarella to the pasta mixture, add pretty much any pizza topping you normally like.  Mushrooms, peppers, pineapple, ham, whatever.  This recipe is extremely adaptable.

I followed the instructions of others. I sautéed onions, green peppers, and pepperoni in a little bit of olive oil. I added a jar of spaghetti sauce and have a jar of pizza sauce . My husband and I really enjoyed it! I added  garlic powder, onion powder, red pepper flakes, and Italian seasoning. Bon appétit!

I put a layer of pepperoni on the bottom of the dish and just under the cheese on the top.  It got crispy this way.
My beefs with the recipe is how greasy it is and the fact the recipe does not mention the olives that are in the photo.
I doubt this will be something I do often, but I'm sure I will make it again.

I halved the recipe and made it in an 8x8". I still used 1/2 lb pasta, though, and am glad I did. I was also liberal on the sauce and cheese, and would do that again, too. I added some minced garlic to the meat and onions, and added some Italian Seasoning to the sauce. I also quartered the pepperoni and microwaved it for 30 seconds to de-grease a bit, as other reviews suggesters. I also put 2/3 of the pepperoni in the mix and placed the rest on top of the cheese. We liked it, but will play with it next time - more sauce, add ricotta as well, do mushrooms and green peppers in it, and definitely crumbled sausage instead of ground beef. Still, it's a keeper.

I made this as a treat on a Saturday night, and my family liked it, but not as much as pizza, so when we will eat a high-calorie meal such as this with very little nutrition, I will just give them pizza instead. It was a good thought, and a good try, but I won't be making this again.

The recipe was simple and fast to make - I didn't use exact measurements, but used guesses as to how much to put into it. For the sauce, the guy I was joint cooking with, we used Tomato Basil and Garlic (Prego) that worked wonderfully into it. Didn't get presliced pepperoni but a stick and sliced them. Also used about half a large onion for a "small" one. I think next time will try to add in some green veggies into it - such as green peppers to mix it up a little. Else wise, it is a recipe I have and will pass on - and definitely make again.

glad I read the reviews first, I like a lot of sauce and had 2 15oz cans of spaghetti sauce on hand and decided to use them both, which my family felt was the perfect amount.  I didn't change anything else and all the leftovers are gone.  It's a definate keeper.

Everyone now begs for me to make this dish. I am always on the lookout for simple dishes that serve a lot for my teen boys and their friends and this is one of their favorites. I use ground venison since I don't cook with hamburger but I don't think it changes the flavors very much but it is a lot leaner.

I decided to try this out and it was a HUGE hit!! I did change a few things though. I used the mini pepperoni and instead of ground beef I used Italian sausage. I also put sliced black olives and mushrooms in with it as well. I also layered it instead of mixing it all together. I put the meat on the bottom, veggies on top of it, and then mixed the pasta with the sauce and placed that on top. Then of course covered it with melted cheese. It was SOOOOO good!! My husband absolutely loved it and has said it's one of the best dishes I've made to date. :)

EXCELLENT recipe!!  This was a huge hit with my family.  I used gemelli pasta as I had that home and that worked great.  I used Hunt's spaghetti sauce.  It tasted like a lasagna on steroids.  We will definitely be making this on a regular basis.  It was extremely quick and easy, but a nice hot meal.

I was looking for a quick & easy recipe using ground beef. This was perfect!! I love that it only has six ingredients and was still very tasty. I substituted bowtie pasta for rotini (I used about 12 oz.) and onion powder instead of onion (hubby hates onion bits). We both loved it! It was also very filling, and we have a ton of leftovers so I don't have to cook tomorrow night :). Will definitely make again!

It was good given my goals in making the dish:  I wanted something VERY easy to make because I was pressed for time, and I wanted a variation on my simple and typical spaghetti with spaghetti sauce dinner.  I think there is a reason that most people reviewing this recipe seem to mention that their kids will eat it.  It's a simple, easy, non-special recipe that tastes pretty good; not something you would serve to impress.  I added crushed red pepper flakes and italian seasoning to give it extra flavor, and thought it was tasty.  I'm sure I'll make it again at some point when I am feeling lazy in the kitchen :-)

Very delish for a different use of spaghetti sauce. I love adding other things like green olives, green peppers, mushrooms, basically anything you want on a pizza works well with this dish!

I'm gluten free and dairy free so my changes are gluten free pasta and no shredded cheese.  I use a vegan "Parmesan" in place of the cheese.  I love this recipe, be sure to crisp the pepperoni first, and this is even good cold the next day, just like pizza!

Fantastic recipe - my 2 year old who normally turns her nose up at most forms of meat actually cleaned her plate and wanted seconds.  I had some extra mushrooms leftover from a dinner earlier in the week and I tossed them into the mix - turned out great!

Very good with a few changes! I added another 1/2 jar of speghetti sc (would have been too dry without).  I also added 2 heaping tsp of garlic, and a tsp of italian seasoning.  It would be okay without these, but I think they added a lot of flavor.  Otherwise, the recipe was really good, easy, and quick! Thanks!!

We thought this was ok but not great.  We didn't really think it tasted like pizza at all.  Who puts ground beef on pizza; sausage would have been a better choice.  Too much like any pasta dish.  We won't be making it again. Really confused over  the five star ratings.

I made this recipe a little larger so we would have left-overs. I used 3 cups of cheese, and 2 jars of sauce. I also used a pound of pasta. We ate it with salad and garlic bread for a fast and filling supper plus had plenty left over for lunch tomorrow. Wonderful and easy!

Very good and relatively quick to make. I used whole wheat penne and spaghetti sauce with spinach Florentine), it made the dish visually appealing. I added Parmesan on top of the mozzarella. I sauteed the sliced pepperoni with the ground beef and drained it well.

This recipe was quick, easy, and delicious! My husband and toddler son loved it! I did add a little more sauce than what the recipe called for, but other than that, I followed it exactly! It had a great taste! I will be making this dish at family gatherings too!

I double the amount of pasta and used penne.  I used 1 jar of spaghetti sauce, 1 can diced tomato, and 1 can of tomato sauce.  Also added black olives.  I followed another suggestion and threw the pepperoni in with the ground beef.  Oh and I used turkey pepperoni.  I made this for a playdate and everyone raved.

I was looking for a fast and easy recipe my whole family would like. This was it! This is really Good. I used a sausage and green pepper spaghetti sauce and I slightly nuked (30 sec between paper towels) the pepperoni to get out some of the excess oil. I followed to a T and it was a smash hit. Nice easy dinner, 1000 times better than a box mix!!!!!!!!!! Hubby and fussy kids ate it all!

Since I am trying to be healthier, I made this meal with ground turkey and turkey pepperoni. I also added a clove of garlic while cooking. For extra flavor I added 1/2 tsp of oregano, 1 tsp italian seasoning and 1 tsp red pepper flakes. I also added half a cup of cheddar cheese. I used more sauce because I hate my meals dry. Over all this meal was super easy and tasty.

I made this recipe the other night. It came out good, but next time I would use just a little more sauce because the pasta soaks it all up.

This was good but I went with the reviewers suggestions and used Italian sausage and I didn't care for that at all.  My husband loved it.  Next time I will do the beef.  I did brown the pepperoni with the sausage and the pepperoni was great, I just didn't care for the taste of the italian sausage.  It is a fast meal with ingredients that I usually have on hand so a definite keeper!

My 9 year old made this for dinner tonight, and she LOVED it.  She doesn't usually eat red sauce on pasta, so that's pretty good.  (She left out the pepperoni because neither of my kids likes that.)  My husband and I thought it was bland, though.  Next time, we'll make it with Italian sausage instead of ground beef to add more flavor.  We'll also try it with chicken, alfredo sauce, and some spinach.  It's easy enough for a 4th grader to make though, so it gets good points from me!

I made this last night and it was great.  I did follow the advice of some of the reviews and microwaved the pepperoni between some paper towels for 30 seconds and I also added some chopped garlic to the beef and onion mixture.  Very yummy and simple!

This recipe is a goood starting point.  I wanted it to make two dinners so I used 12 oz. pasta and 1.25 pounds ground beef.  It really needed some extra oomph so I added quite a bit of italian seasoning and garlic powder.  I kept tasting the mix before baking it to get the spices right.  At the very end I realized it needed crushed red pepper!  Definitely add that.  A good basic dinner.  Mushrooms would have been a good addition.  I'll make it or some variation again and again.  A good potluck or dish to take to a family needing a meal.

This was a really good and simple recipe. The pepperoni really adds the kick. Without it, it's just like eating spaghetti with rotini noodles. Next time I think I'll try it with sausage instead of ground beef.

I really enjoyed this.  I didn't have pepperoni handy so I omitted that. Still turned out good.  I did use 1 1/2 jars of sauce, I think it was still a little dry.  This was quick and easy to make.  I also served garlic bread with it.

this recipe was simple to make and very tasty. i did a few things differently. i used turkey pepperoni so it wasnt as greasy and i also cut the pepperoni slices in half and cooked it with the beef. my boyfriend loved it and the leftovers weregreat for lunch the next day. i will make it again but try it with some different toppings, like mushrooms and sausage. also, next time i will mix cheese in with the pasta so its more like a baked ziti.

Great starter recipe!  I used ground sausage instead of beef and added black olives.  It still came out a little dry even though I added more sauce.  Definitely "ADD MORE" sauce to this recipe, almost double.  Overall, good dish!!

Very good basic recipe. I followed the instructions, but added more meat, including canadian bacon and extra pepperoni. Didn't have a clean 9x13, so I layered the meat/pasta and mozzarella in a round casserole dish. I like to broil the mozzarella for a minute or so before it leaves the oven. 

Think it would be even better with some other pizza ingredients like red or green peppers, mushrooms and a little Italian sausage, but it's flexible enough to use whatever you have on hand. My husband suggested adding bacon and cheddar cheese (omitting pepperoni) to make it taste like bacon cheeseburger pizza, but he loved it as is.

For what this is - a budget friendly hamburger dish - it really delivers! I noted the reviews that said this was bland, so I used dried minced onion instead of the regular onion, added minced garlic, italian seasoning, and chopped stick pepperoni to the hamburger mixture. Also seasoned the pasta water with a handful of salt. Added a pizza blend of mozzarella, provolone and asiago cheese. Served with some frozen breadsticks and hubby loved it.

I liked the idea of this casserole, but I thought I could do more to make it more like a way to make it more like a "supreme pizza". I did half ground beef, half ground sausage. I used one chopped orange pepper and increased the garlic. I made the sauce from scratch and added a can of diced tomatoes. When seasoning, I used 
a "pizza spice" grinder to increase the pizza taste. I used a mozzerella/provolone cheese mix on the top and lightly sprinkled with Papa Murphy's Herb Cheese blend. It's different to have a spaghetti dish that's pizza-like in nature. My family thought it was tasty. Next time, I'll probably add mushrooms and anchovy paste in the sauce, as I made enough for another casserole tomorrow. These kind of casseroles are always great because you get a pizza flavor without breaking the bank and it can be different every time. You can also go as trashy or as healthy as you like. It's really up to you.

I halved the pepperoni slices before microwaving 1 min.  My family LOVED this recipe.

This was a really tasty recipe. Without the pepperoni, it would just be spaghetti, but with it added, it really added that "pizza" flavor.  I also added mushrooms, and might next time add olives and some other pizza topping veggies.  Thanks for a good recipe.

My husband and 15 year old daughter really liked this dish.  It was nothing spectacular to me.  But it was an easy dish to make.  I used the whole grain pasta which had more fiber to cut some calories and my daughter and husband couldn't tell at all.  They loved it.

Altered recipe*****
my kale spaghetti sauce: (meat, smiths brand spaghetti sauce, bunch chopped kale) Using Manicotti noodles filling: meat sauce, 1/4 cup fresh parm cheese, 1/2 cup mozz cheese, zucchini chopped, 3 artichoke hearts chopped.(mix all together except noodles) Place extra plain spaghetti sauce in bottom of pan, fill noodles with meat sauce mix, place in pan. Top with mozz and cheddar cheese to liking, Top with pepperoni slices (pre nooked in micro to cut grease) Bake 375 for 30 min.  YUM.

My family loved this recipe. My kids ask me every day since I made it if we are having pizza pasta for dinner. I added a few extras though. I used a red onion, added fresh minced garlic and used a half a pound of hamberger and a half a pound of ground pork. I also used a package of shredded Italian cheeses instead of just mozz. Kraft makes it.  My daughter didn't want anything to do with it until I made her take a bite and now thats all she wants to eat.  Very yummy!!!

I made this for dinner tonight and it was great!  I did make some changes to make it healthier:  whole grain penne pasta, ground turkey and low fat mozzarella.  My husband couldn't even tell it was low fat because it had so much flavor.  I also did have to add a can of diced tomatoes because there wasn't enough sauce.

good, simple recipe to make when you're in a hurry (which is almost always for me).  Didn't really taste like pizza, but that was okay - good, quick, italian dish.  I did add pizza sauce in with spaghetti sauce.

I really liked this recipe.  The wife said she could do without the pepperoni but that kind of defeats the purpose of calling it 'Pizza Pasta'.  Will definitely make this again!

This was just okay to me.  Tasted pretty similar to baked mostaccioli.  I ended up quartering my pepperoni slices, so perhaps the flavor wasn't as 'pizzaish'. Probably wouldn't make again.

This is a great basic recipe.  I generally try to make healthy substitutions so for this I used whole wheat rotini, ground turkey, turkey pepperoni, and reduced fat mozzarella.  I also added mushrooms.  It was delicious and no guilt!

Good, but add extra cheese, including parm and add salt. Add more rotini noodles too. I used a little more than 1 pound.

This was a quick and easy recipe, and the family enjoyed it!  

I sprinkled Parmesan cheese on top after it came out of the oven, and my husband actually ate 2 helpings, and so did my daughter (aka Miss Picky).  Will keep in my "make again" recipe box!

This recipe was extreamly easy and good.  My husband and three young children loved it!  When I make it again I might use pizza sauce and add pizza toppings such as green pepper and mushrooms.  Thank you for posting.

I tweaked this a little but letting the kids pick out a fun shape of noodle to use and I only used hamburger. It came out like a lazagna minus the Ricotta mix. It was very good tho. My only complaint is how many dishes it dirties up.

I cook for my church on Wed. night. We made this last week and served it with Salad! We substituted Pizza sauce for spag. sauce and used a different cheese! It was GREAT!!! We have families sign up to eat since the meals are fresh! Thank you and this sight for helping me get my Wed. night meal together! The ladies that cooked before, cooked all frozen! We cook fresh! Thank you again. This was great!

I think this is a great beginner recipe. It was easy to make and tasty.  I think you could add several things to make this more complex.  I used turkey pepperoni to cut some of the fat.  It worked out pretty well. I also mixed some sweet italian  turkey sausage in with the hamburger meat. A quick and easy recipe that is sure to please. :)

Easy and simple, I used onion powder to replace onion and a Healthy Choice tomato sauce (it was good-considering I'm a jar tomato sauce snob-I only like the homemade, but if your in a bind time wise, it's tasty).

Nummm, family loved this.  My husband and I would like to make a "deluxe pizza" version - which it looks like other people have done.  Adding mushrooms, green pepper, italian sausage YUM!!!  Next time...(when the kids aren't eating).

This is a very easy and tasty recipe that can be whipped up pretty quickly, especially if you don't add the hamburger and use pre-sliced pepperoni. I started to make this and realized I was out of ground beef, so I just went ahead with only the pepperoni and it went over big with my husband and toddler. I think the ground beef would have been great, but it's really good without it, too.

My 6 year old daughter and I both really enjoyed this. My daughter got upset when all the pepperoni was gone. She really liked the pepperoni in it. I told her I will make this again sometime. She said thats a great idea!

Very tasty and quick recipe.  Next time I will add green bell pepper and one 4oz can of mushrooms.  I will also try covering half in mozarella cheese and half in cheddar cheese.
This recipe called for a little more pepperoni than I cared for so I put in about 2 oz.
