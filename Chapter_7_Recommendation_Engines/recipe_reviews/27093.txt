I have made this many times using refrigerated pizza dough.  To keep it from being so greasy, microcwave the salami and pepperoni between paper towels.  I don't use the egg, but put pizza sauce over the meat and cheese.  I spray the top of the dough with non-stick spray and sprinkle Parmesean cheese, garlic powder and oregano.  Use more pizza sauce for dipping.  Great recipe.

This recipe is quick, easy and very versitile.  Not being a salami fan, I added turkey instead.  I have made the recipe twice now.  Once with and once without the egg.  If you use the egg, cut it in half.  Both times I added creamy italian dressing for a little extra flavor.  I would say this is a must.  You really need something to give it a kick.  Already we are thinking of what other hoagie ingredients we can swap out for a new taste.
I used crescent rolls and liked the taste, but it is a little greasy.  Definately use low fat meats.

You only need 1 or 2 eggs; I used 3 and it was a waste of eggs.  This was a very rich/heavy/greasy meal, but my husband enjoyed it. I bet if you listen closely enough, you can hear your arteries clogging up! (LOL) It was more like stromboli than a hoagie.  I sprayed the pan with cooking spray as someone suggested, which I think really helped.  Wish I had seen other reviewers' suggestions to add oregano, onions, and mushrooms before I made mine, I think it would have really enhanced it.

Excellent! Quick, easy, tastes great.  Since others were saying it is so greasy causing the bottom layer of dough to get soggy, I microwaved the meats on paper towels on medium power for just a couple of minutes which got a lot of the grease to come out, soaked it all up with paper towels before preparing the hoagie bake, came out great and less fat!

Current review:  I made this again but used pizza dough instead of crescent dough, per others' comments.  All I can say is if you want pizza, make pizza.  This recipe really is more interesting and special when made with the crescent dough.  Also, 2 eggs are plenty.  Finally, a good addition was to saute a red pepper, cut into strips, in olive oil and garlic; place between the meat and the cheese layers.  Prior review:  This turned out well; my husband and brother loved it.  For me, I recommend adding "flavor" and "color" items such as herbs, tomato slices or sun dried tomatoes, mushrooms, spinach, thinly sliced sweet onion, and/or marinara sauce.  Nevertheless, this was good just as is...

This is SOOOO good! I've cooked it several times and have made different variations of it. My favorite so far is substituting pizza dough for the crescent rolls that the recipe calls for. The crescent rolls have a slightly sweet taste to them that I don't personally care for. I also put italian dressing on over the last layer of cheese, then the egg over the italian dressing. After brushing the top layer of bread (crescent or pizza dough) I sprinkle garlic powder and parmesan cheese. I also use all Provolone cheese since I don't like Swiss cheese. Very good, lots of compliments, and the whole family agrees that they like the pizza dough version the best. They like the consistency of it. I may try it with pizza sauce instead of italian dressing next time! Thanks for the wonderful recipe and a basis to start with that I could play around with!

I'd rate this 5 stars if I didn't have to make changes.  I left out the egg because I thought it sounded yucky.  I briefly microwaved the salami and pepperoni to render some of the grease. I didn't have any swiss cheese, so I substituted a good quality deli sliced American cheese.  Sprinkled the meat with some oregano and sliced hot pepperoncinis to make it more hoagie-like.  My husband and I really liked the finished dish.  He thinks I should use some tomato sauce next time to make it more like pizza, but I think that would defeat the purpose of a "Hoagie Bake".  I was looking for a way to use up a pound of dry salami I had in the fridge, and this was perfect.  Will definitely make this again.

I read the reviews and decided to change this is a bit.  Smoked turkey instead of the pepperoni, only half the salami and mozzarella instead of provolone.  We LOVED it!  It did not turn out greasy at all - we could pick our pieces up with our hands and eat them.

I've used this recipe for a long time and have never reviewed it, so I figured it was about time.  I love this recipe.  I basically use ham and cheese and it turns out just wonderful.  It reminds me of the ham and cheese rolls a store up the street from where I grew up as a kid sold.  They were the best, but now that store is out of business.  I'm glad that I can still have something that tastes like them when I want.  Quick, easy,  good.  Who could ask for more?

WEll...hubby did not dig this at all, but I loved it.  I took a reviewers advice and made this "pizza style".  I used pizza crust in lieu of the crescent dough and used a combination of pastrami, ham and pepperoni.  I left the swiss out as others complained it overpowered the taste of the provolone.  Instead of using the egg, I used spaghetti sauce.  I had inteneded on using homemade pizza sauce, but was running short on time.  I layered all of the ingredients on one side of the dough and folded the other side over to enclose everything...and baked as directed.  Needless to say, I ate about 90% of it and it was good.  Thanks Cindy.

My 5 kids loved this recipe. There wasn't one leftover piece. I served this with a salad. It reminded me and my husband of the breakfast sandwiches they sell  in some restaurants. It was a little more brown then I would like--even though I put the foil on top for the last ten minutes. I think if I make it again I would reduce the heat to 325 when using a glass dish. I also think this would be a great make ahead meal for breakfast the next day, or dinner. Overall a keeper for sure! Thanks for the quick meal... Robin

Love this recipe.  I use something very similar to make strombolli, which involves making and rolling out dough.  This was quick and easy.  I don't use the egg inside, but do use the egg wash on top.

Excellent!  I made the 4 serving version using a recipe for crescent rolls found on allrecipes (golden crescent rolls.  I made the rolls with half wheat flour to make this more healthy.  I used turkey pepperonis & degreased my salami.  I made this in a 8x8 dish.  Not greasy at all and sooo flavorful & good.

Try this recipe AS IS - the 3-egg mixture really puffs the top crescent roll layer and gives you something different than just a calzone bake which I've done as well with pizza dough, sauce, oregano, pepperoni, mozzarella, etc. DO nuke the pepperoni for a minute on paper towels. We also baked this dish a couple more minutes uncovered (before covering) just to be sure there was no sogginess. Zero sogginess - it was delicious, simple, and picky-people approved. Even better - the next day we sliced up a few big squares and pan toasted in a little butter over low heat - almost even better!!!!!!!!!

Good recipe!  I only used one egg and only provolone cheese.  It was quite good, used some pasta sauce as a dipping sauce.  Already plan on making it again, but using pizza crust this time, as the crescents were a bit too buttery for my taste.  Thanks for the recipe!

Another Great Recipe!  Made this for dinner last night, as is, with a few substitutions--used just ham and red-fat salami, swapped mozzarella for provolone, cut the egg to just 1, and added garlic powder to sprinkle on the top.  Wonderful!  Can't wait to try it with bread machine pizza dough as others have suggested.  We dipped ours in Creamy Italian Dressing, Spag Sauce, and ranch dressing.  Just enough for this family of 5.  Thanks Cindy it's a definite keeper!!!

To me, a hoagie is a stuffed sandwich with oregano and oil dressings, so this recipe, with all that egg in it, doesn't say "hoagie" to me.  It's not bad, it's just more frittata than hoagie.  So, to make it more hoagie like, I used Italian  dressing in place of the eggs, brushed the top crust ( I prefer pizza dough to the sweetness of crescent dough, but either works fine)with more Italian dressing, sprinkled with oregano, Parmesan, and chopped pepperoncini peppers.  No Swiss cheese (I like provolone and Havarti instead).  Do microwave the meats to remove excess grease, as another reviewer suggested. Also takes a bit longer to cook than recipe states.  With the alteration I've made, I call it delicious.

Have made this several times.  The first time I used the eggs but haven't since and it's perfect without them - we actually prefer it without them.   I switch up the meats + add more or less of some and sometimes use garlic flavored crescents.   The possibilities are endless.

Delicious!  Per other reviews I only used one egg for the egg wash and I still had a little leftover.  I thought I had picked up ham at the store but it turned out to be turkey.  Still tasted fabulous!  My fiance wants me to make it for him and his friends for Football Sunday!  Definitely a keeper.  :)

my husband who NEVER eats leftovers ate all this up!  I even printed it up for friends to make their hubbies...ive also recently made this as a Ruben bake...mmm make sure you rinse drain and squeeze all the water you can out of the sauerkraut I did one layer thin sliced corned beef (or turkey if you like Rachels) sprinkled the sauerkraut, a layer of swiss and another layer of thin sliced corned beef and served it with thousand Island dressing for dipping...this would also be good with roast beef and brie, ham and cheddar, Turkey, bacon and and cheddar, ive made Pepperoni and mozzerella with a jar of pizza sauce for dipping (sprinkle garlic lightly over egg wash)

This was awesome I ommited the egg altogether didnt see any need for it.  cooked pepperoni and salami in the Microwave for 45 sec on paper towels to render some fat and I used provalone and mozzerella and sprinkles top with parm. Baked 400 for 20 min was perfect. Very easy and fast Also uses up some left over lunch meats you may have. You can change this up a thousand ways Ham Turkey ( or roast pork) swiss, mustard and pickle would make a great Cuban sandwich.

This turned out quite well. I used what meats and cheeses I had on hand(2 types of salami and some sausage, as well as provlone, swiss, and shredded nacho cheese). It turned out very well except for the bottom was a little soggy. It was because of the meat though, and I would venture to guess that maybe putting a layer of cheese down before putting on the meat might help to curb this problem a little. Even soggy, this was still very good.

We tried this the other night and no one liked it at all (myself or my two kids) except my husband who thought it was ok. It was too greasy and not a good kind of greasy like another person posted.  This was a total waste of very expensive meats and cheeses.  I won't be making this again.

I THOUGHT THIS WAS REALLY TASTY. I USED PIZZA DOUGH INSTEAD OF CRESCENT ROLLS AND USED LOWER FAT MEATS AND CHEESE. TRY THIS RECIPE.

Fast, easy, delicious!  My husband & I both loved this.  The only change I made was mozz instead of swiss.  I did lightly spray the pan, and it served nicely, no sticking.  It's not very healthy, but it's a definate keeper for us!

This is INCREDIBLE!!!  I took the advice of other reviewers and added creamy Italian dressing and garlic powder on top of the cheese, followed by the egg (I only used two).  This was absolutely delicious....my husband usually won't eat leftovers, but I had to take extra to work and leave it there so I could be sure and have some, too!

I've made this same recipe in the past as an appetizer for parties.  I put a layer of roasted red peppers (pat them dry first) on top before adding the second cresent roll layer.  It adds flavor and takes care of that "something's missing" feeling!

This was delicious.  I did make a few changes though.  I omitted the eggs and brushed the inside of the crescent rolls with honey mustard instead.  It made a wonderful lunch when i served it to some friends with tomato soup.  Presents well on the plate.

Excellent idea!!! I followed other advice, left out the egg and microwaved the salami. I used way more of the meat and it was wonderful. Added pizza sauce and some sauteed onion along with pepperjack, american, and swiss cheese!! Very good, not too greasy, will make again!! Thanks for the post!!!

Made this last night for dinner. We loved it. I did microwave the pepperoni and salami briefly before adding to dish as I was afraid of a greasy finished product based on other reviews. Other than that I followed recipe to a T. I used the eggs and am happy I did. Crescent top and bottom were light and fluffy and there was no grease to speak of. Served with a fresh salad for a great weeknight dinner. Thanks Cindy!

These were awesome.  I did change the salami to turkey.  also instead of using egg I brushed a red wine vinegar, olive oil, and oregano dressing on instead.  I added red onion and zuccbhini in with the meat and cheese and placed a thin slice of tomato on top of each sandwich then powdered the top with parmesian cheese.  Had to extend baking time to 45 minutes.  They were delicious.  my guests raved about them.

I had this as a book club appetizer last year and just made it again today for a post-holiday get-together.  People loved it.  A couple of small differences in the recipe given to me:  after layering meat, cheese, meat, cheese, meat, a 12 oz. jar of roasted red peppers are spread on and 3/4 of the egg mixture (with black pepper added in) spread on top of the peppers, then the other package of crescent rolls with the remaining egg, pepper, cheese mixture spread on top.  Bake 25 min. covered and 15 min. uncovered.  (I used my pyrex 13x9 and did not need any cooking spray.)  Cut as you would bar cookies and serve as finger food.  Less greasy as it cools of course.  The red peppers add a new flavor dimension.

Loved this sooo much! I used refrigerated pizza dough and followed other reviewers suggestions and microwaved the salami and pepperoni to get some of the grease out. I also added some creamy italian dressing and used mozzarella instead of provolone. Will make this often!

Like this needs another review, but we thought this was fantastic.  Made it for only 2 for lunch, so only used 1 8oz package of crescents in a 8X8 pan.  Didn't have ham so used turkey.  I also cut up a few pepperoncinis and put a few splashes of balsamic vinaigrette.  I did use the egg, and I'm glad I did.  I also sprinkled the top with some Italian Seasoning, some minced onion and a little parm cheese.  Even though it was smaller, it needed 25 minutes to cook and I never covered it.  Not greasy, just super yummy!

This had a pretty good taste but was a little too greasy for my taste.  I probably will however make it again, but modify some of the ingredients.

I made this one Friday evening for myself and some friends.  A perfect sports-watching, good-eating idea, right???  It seems as if this would be an OK recipe (I like the combination of ingredients), but I did not care for this at all!!!  It was WAY, WAY too greasy.  I used fat-free crescent rolls, but that didn't help.  The greasiness comes from the salami and pepperoni (don't try using turkey pepperoni - it is terribly dry - and bland!).  I will not make this again.  I'll stick with the good 'ol hoagie sandwich (the way it should be!).  My friends didn't even like this. Thanks anyways :)

I love the idea of this recipe, reminds me of the Italian BMT sub from Subway, but it came out way too greasy & salty for my tastes. I also thought the eggs were unnecessary, as it didn't seem to hold everything together very well. My husband loved this, hence the 3 star review. I think I will make some changes next time i make this, such as omitting the eggs, trying some leaner meats and adding some spicy mustard to the inside. Overall though, a good quick & easy recipe.

I made a slightly healthier version of this recipe by only using turkey and roast beef for the meats, and limiting the cheese to one layer of provlone. I also added pickles, banana peppers and yellow mustard. It was a little soggy on the bottom, probably from the pickles and banana peppers, but my husband and I really enjoyed it. I can't way to try some more variations.

I left the ham for this recipe at work, i didn't have the right meat or cheese. I ended up using slices of turkey, sliced chicken cooked w/onions and minced garlic and left over sausage. I added green and red bell peppers and mushrooms on top of the meates. On top of the cheese I put thinly sliced tomatoes. Also after I cooked covered for ten minutes the bread looked a little too moist. I cooked uncovered for five more minutes so the cresent bread wouldn't be soggy. Good, but not my favorite

This is so good!  I have made it twice and the second time around I decided to add some fresh mushrooms and black olives, excellent!  I also sprinkled some garlic powder and oregano on top of the crust.  It gave it a more italian flare.  Will make this one again and again!

I would give this 3 stars, but my son and other half say it's a 5 star recipe.  I thought the crescent rolls made this a little too sweet.  A very flexible dish, though.  You could add any combo of meat and cheeses in this recipe.  It's good, but I just didn't enjoy the crescent roll crust too much.  Very kid friendly, though.

I just made this for the 2nd time.  The first I just made it for my husband and I for dinner.  We loved it so much we thought that if we sliced it into bite sized pieces it would make a GREAT party appetizer...boy were we right!  It went over so big yesterday at a friends birthday bash that the platter was gone in 10 minutes!  Everyone wanted the recipe!  Thanks Cindy, this one gets 5+++ stars!!

Delicious! I added a small amount of roasted red peppers between the cheese and meat layer, added mozzarella to the cheese layer, and also used oregano on top with the parmesan.  You may want to take the eggs down to two; three leaves you with  a good bit left over.  Note that if your deli uses larger cheeses like Heidi Ann swiss or Stella provolone, use 4 slices...8 is too many.  Overall great meal!

This is a great dish for a quick weeknight meal or lunch.  After reading the reviews, I substituted the Swiss cheese because many other mentioned it over powered the Provolone.  I used a combination of shredded Parmasean and Romano, which I thought, went nicely with the sliced Provolone.  I also was quite liberal with the luncheon meats and used a peppered Salami for some zing.  I cut the egg amount to 2 eggs and noticed that some reviewers skipped using it all together.  I think the egg does serve a good purpose here by molding the dough mixture together.  I didn't have a problem with the crescent roll taste, but may substitute with pizza dough the next time around as many others suggested.  Thanks so much for submitting this wonderful dish Cindy.  We certainly enjoyed this!

My family loved this recipe.  Although I changed it a little.  I didn't use any eggs.  I layered my cheese between the meat layers, it made a difference.  We eat this all the time.  Thanks for suggesting to dip in pizza sauce. YUMMY!!

This is a good recipe that makes a nice hot sandwich in a different way.  My husband loved it and wanted to take the other 4 leftover pieces to work for lunch the next day.  Note:  I didn't need 3 eggs to brush on inside and the outside...I would imagine 1 would have been plenty.  Also the Swiss cheese taste is strong and it took over the taste of the Provolone ~ so you may want to omit the Provolone.

My whole family ate this meal up!  Even the pickiest child would love this meal.  To make it even better, I added some honey roasted turkey.  Next time I will add more meat than the recipe calls for to make the hoagie bake even bigger!

Having a family of 8 boys and 1 picky husband makes finding a meal everyone likes hard to do.We ALL loved this. I used pizza crust and it turned out great. Easy to scale for a large family and so many ways to make it your own. Will make again and again!

Excellent recipe. I put in two eggs and used ham, turkey, and pepperoni as the meats. This sandwich goes great with soup. We used a little italian dressing on the side as adding it while baking looked as if it might turn greasy. Yummy!

i agree with everyone else's reviews -- this dish needed some adjusting. i'm only cooking for two, so i used a smaller casserole dish and only needed 1 egg. i added italian seasonings on top and served it with honey mustard and pizza sauces. i like the idea of this recipe -- and, it is extremely versatile to meet your own wants and needs. i like that it's quick to put together and easy cleanup. however, it was a very rich meal as is.

This was quite good.  I left out the eggs completely - I'm skeptical about how that would have affected the recipe.  I also used Jay's Signature Pizza Crust (I do not like the sweet taste of Crescent rolls), and the Creamy Italian is a GREAT suggestion!  I used the Creamy Italian with the mayonnaise as suggested by someone else, but did not like that, as the mayonnaise did not cook at all, and was left in it.  I will try a store-bought Creamy Italian dressing next time. Can't wait to eat this with lunch, it's also good with tomato sauce for dipping. THANKS!

This recipe was great and very easy to make. My 4 yr old basically made the dish himself. I changed a couple of things per others reviews. I used pizza dough (grocers freezer)and I used Creamy Italian dressing instead of eggs. The dressing I made homemade from another ALLRECIPE, recipe. The mayo in the dressing sucked up alot of the grease from the meat and burned off. All in All this was a great, easy recipe.My 4 yr old had fun making it and my 11 yr old said it was tolerable to eat.That is 5 stars coming from him!

Very good although I would only brush it with 2 eggs, not 3.  I also added some oregano for flavor and served it with pizza sauce.  YUMMY - MUCH easier then making a stromboli with frozen bread dough!

This so was simple and so good! Used honey mustard instead of egg and it was fabulous! Brought leftovers to work and received numerous requests for the recipe b/c it smelled so good! My fiance thought it was stromboli (!?), but i will try with mozzarella and tomato sauce. Co worker made this and the meats were too greasy for her. She also made it with creamy italian dressing (instead of egg or honey mustard) and between her husband and kids, she didn't have any leftovers! A keeper!

This was wonderful, easy to prepare and serve with little clean up after!  A plus as far as I'm concerned.  Used Ham, Turkey, Salami, Mozzarella and Swiss Cheese.  Also did the honey mustard rather than egg as others suggested.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks for great recipe!

I made a few changes. I used turkey instead of pepperoni and added 2 tablespoons of italian dressing to the beaten eggs. I decided to add some roasted red peppers and banana peppers. This turned out ok, but not something I am rushing to make again.

This was really good and super easy to throw together.  The only change I made was to use 2 eggs instead of 3, although I still think 2 might have been too much, I ended up tossing part.  I did microwave the pepperoni on paper towels for a few seconds to soak up some of the grease.  I did bake this for about 10 minutes longer.  It was perfect, not greasy or soggy at all.  Thanks!

This is a favorite at our house - a great way to clean out the fridge of old cheeses and meats.  I've always used crescent rolls when I make it, and I reduce the eggs to 2.  We serve with pizza sauce on the side instead of in the bake.  It's also good with italian sausage - precooked and blotted to remove the grease.  I use hard salami and less pepperoni.

My family - yes, even the picky one, LOVES this hoagie.  It is never the same twice because I just put in whatever we have.  I always use crescent rolls, eggs, cooked (scrambled) sausage, and top with egg/parm cheese.  As for the other meats and cheese, just use whatever you have - get the kids envolved and let them help you decide.  We've never had a problem with it being too greasy.  Reheats really well too.

So this is another kid friendly hit!  In the spirit of full disclosure, I made some changes: * I only used one egg, most of which I put on the top of the crescent rolls. * I used only mozzarella cheese (b/c that is all I had in the house) * Like some other reviewers,  I took all the pepperoni and microwaved it for 1 min on top of a ton of paper towels. This completely eliminated any of the greasiness. The crescent rolls top and bottom were flaky and yummy! No sogginess here!  I would definitely make this again - I think next time I will serve it with a side of marinara  sauce for fun!

I find the idea of using pizza dough intriguing, as crescent roll dough is WAY too sweet to blend with the meats in this dish. Also, after 35 minutes in the oven, the inside of our bottom layer of crescent dough was still soggy, mushy, and uncooked. I loved the concept, and wouldn't change any other ingredients other than the the crescent dough into pizza dough.

You had me at "crescent roll."  Super, super easy, fast because I used pre sliced meats, easy to prep and makes alot.  I liked it with the creamy italian dressing also. My kids are huge fans of crescent bread too so they ATE IT UP!

The fam loved this!  I used ham and mozzarella.  Couldn't get the 1/2 of the 3 eggs to "spread" over the first layer, so ended up using all of it, and then beating a fourth egg for the top crust.  Will make this again for sure!

Like other reviewers, I used pizza crust and microwaved the pepperoni first to make this less greasy. I also added hot capicola. Excellent - made great leftovers the next day too!

I made this with provolone and mozarella.  My kids don't like swiss cheese.  Everyone liked this but my son  felt it would be better with pizza sauce.  Next time I might try that...onions too.

This is an excellent receipe!  I made this last night for my husband and his buddies and they all raved and wanted to know what was in it.  I made a few changes; I used roast beef and turkey for the meats and pepper jack and swiss cheese.  I also sauteed onions, mushrooms, and green peppers and added them to the bake.  I would highly reccommend.

Good recipe.  I halfed the recipe. Used one can of crescent rolls and only 1 egg. Baked in a 9x9 baking dish. Didn't have any salami.  Used ham and pepperoni.  I warmed the pepperoni in the microwave to get some of the grease off as suggested in other reviews.  Sprinkled the top after the egg wash with dried oregano, garlic powder and onion powder then followed with the parmesan cheese.  Used the same cooking time.  Worked great.  My husband and daughter loved it...me too.  Thanks for sharing.

My family liked this recipe very much. I made it with all turkey products and provolone and mozzerella cheese.I sprinkled a little garlic powder and italian seasoning over the bottom layer of bread. I only used 1 egg to brush on the top and added poppy seeds like another reviewer suggested. My family wants to try this with marinara sauce next. I will definitely make this again for them!

This was good, but I think it was a little greasy. Maybe if I got leaner cuts of the deli meats it would be better. But it just seemed to need something else.

I followed everyone's advice and cut the recipe down to two eggs.  The ingredients I filled the hoagie with were low-sodium turkey and ham plus genoa salami. I used Munster and Provolone cheese and I also included a jar of fried onions and peppers found in the pasta aisle at our grocery store.  It disappeared in minutes and I'm being asked for the recipe :-D

I love this easy dish.  It can get a bit greasy but you can use any variety of meats you want so I've started using ham and turkey and sometimes I'll add salami or pastrami.  The pepperoni is very good but we prefer it a little on the milder side.  Also easy to half the recipe only using one can of crescent rolls & using a 8x8 pyrex dish.  Still plenty to eat.

Great idea, using the canned crescent rolls to add a rich flavor.  I agree with the other reviewers about cutting back on the egg.  I'd like to try this with an olive salad to make a sort of muffuletta bake.

OMG!! The Hubby LOVED this!! He took leftovers to work and all the guys there wanted more, so I made another just for him to take to work. I did use turkey instead of pepperoni just because that is what I had. I didn't find it greasy at all. It was very tasty and a great way to create something hearty but fast. Will definetley make again and there are always ways to switch this around just bits at a time to keep from getting tired of it!!!

This has good flavor, but is very heavy and greasy.  Next time I will make it with pizza dough instead of crescent rolls and omit one of the meats.

I made this last night for supper, I doubled the recipe as I had 6 hungry guys to feed and there was absolutely none left!  It is a little expensive but worth it.  I baked the bottom crust for approximately 7 minutes and did not have a problem with soggy crust.  I think it will also be a good starting point for making other varieties of sandwiches, great for a quick supper on the farm!

The recipe is great as is, but I've modified it in a couple different ways. I use about 2 tsp of italian seasoning, which makes it taste like an italian-style stuffed breakfast pizza. I also sometimes substitute the meats with whatever kind of lunchmeat I have, like turkey or ham, and also put in twice the amount of eggs to bulk it up.

This was pretty good. I found that when I cooked it even only 21 minutes on 325, the bottom was browning much sooner, faster than the top.  I chose to creative 'flip' it, so the bottom wouldn't get too much browner...

Since I halfed the recipe, this was doable.....but if i had made the original recipe size, then it wouldn't have been too easy to flip, and i think the outcomme would have been a crispy bottom and a not cooked top..

I give this 5 starts if you make a few changes. Use ham and swiss and/ or provalone. I have also used turkey pepperoni with no drying out problems. Also, add roasted red peppers (pat dry on paper towel) for extra flavor. Family loves it and makes great appatizers.

Only used 2 eggs and added banana peppers under the cheese.  GREAT!  Serve with soup for a great, tasty dinner.

Soooo easy and delicious.  Great for football parties or whatever.  I added Mrs. Dash's Garlic and Herb seasoning which was great, just a little extra flavor.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was very good.  I tried it with garlic crecent dough and think next time I will do it according to the recipe.  I also thouhgt you could make a version of a monte cristo with this receipe.  Just cresent, swiss, ham, swiss again, more crecesnt and then bake.  With some dusted powdered sugar and raspberry jam, I think it would be good.  Just a thought.

Pretty good. I took the advice and microwaved the meat to get grease off. I used spaghettie sauce as well. My sister and daughter loved it the night I made it. I liked it better as leftovers. All in all a good meal but not something I'd make all the time.

This is extremely rich and greasy!  It has all the elements to be so very good, but it is just too much.  I can't get past all the grease and fat to justify making it again.  It is good, though...

this is a great recipe, changing meats and cheeses have always been sucessful. The philly cheese steak variation is a favorite. Everyone I have made this for loves it. I have noticed you can thin the egg to use less eggs and it still comes out great!!

I have been making this recipe for a while.  Every time I make it everyone loves it!  I don't bother with the egg.  I used it the first time and it didn't seem to make any difference.  I have tried all kinds of combinations of meats and cheeses, it all depends on my mood, but always comes out great!

Loved this!  I prefer turkey hoagies to Italian hoagies so we buy the triple pack of lunchmeat that includes regular turkey, smoked turkey, and turkey ham.  But this is great no matter what is used.  Yum!

Mmmmm...Mmmm...good! This dish was so delicous. I used low fat turkey pepperoni and added some black olives and a little jalapeno on one side. I had no problem with the bottom being soggy either. This is a must try. Super good with tomato soup!!!!

I did everything as the recipe said only I added a layer of mustard on the bottom and added olives and peppercini's along with switching out the swiss cheese for havarti and sprinkled oregano and garlic over the cheese.  Husband liked this a lot and didn't have any suggestions to improve it.  He is extremely picky and it is rare that he gives something a 5 star.  I will definitely make this again and use different variations of it.

Very easy to put together so preparation was a snap. I added hot peppers, black pepper and garlic powder to the layer of cheese and put italian seasoning on the top with the parm cheese.  I substituted the provolone for muenster cheese.  WOW, this was tasty!  Even our picky nine year old liked it.  I will make this again--FOR SURE!

I made this using Turkey, Chicken, Turkey Pepperoni, onions and on half I put cooked turkey bacon.  I also used mozzarella cheese instead.  Mine looked good after baking about 23 min uncovered in the oven, but it said to cook another 10 min covered.  Before I covered it the top was nice and flakey but after I cooked it covered it was all soft so If I make this again I'll skip the cooking it covered for 10 min part because I don't think it did much for it.  Didn't have any problem with it being soggy on the bottom though.  I also bought the butter flavored cresent rolls because the store was out of the regular kind, and the butter flavor was kind of weird.  It was good, but it was way too filling.  After I ate a small piece I felt like I ate a brick.

After reading all the good reviews I was surprised by how bland this was. All I tasted was cresent rolls. It needs mayo or a marinara sauce in it. I will not make again.

This was good.  I used ALL roast beef and I thought I had swiss cheese, but "someone" (no not ME) decided to snack on it, so I had to use Cheddar & Mozzarella.  Mine came out a little soggy too, due to the cheeses I used I'm sure.  Still a great recipe to experiment with.

Big hit at my house!! I made this for the first time and my husband raved about it! My kids enjoyed it too. Very simple and fast to make. I used turkey pepperoni instead of regular pepperoni because of the grease. I also put a little smoked turkey breast in too. Used only provolone cheese, no swiss, because other reviews said it was too salty, not a big swiss fan anyway. Next time maybe we'll try some veggies like mushrooms, onion or olives. Some others also commented about sogginess, but we didn't find that to be a problem. Will make again! Thanks Cindy.

Yummy!  I modified this, used turkey, ham, and roast beef, added sliced pickles, tomatoes, and onion between the meat and cheese layers, and only used Swiss cheese.  The tomatoes and pickles made it a little runny/messy when it was hot, but it still tasted great!  The leftovers the next day were wonderful too!  Going to try it tonight as written, maybe add some sliced olives and onion.

This recepie was quick and easy, and is VERY easy to personalize. I used turkey, ham, and the pepperoni, shredded asiago and mozzarella cheese, and added tomatoes to the cheese layer. I also seasoned the filling with garlic salt and pepper, which gave the sandwhich GREAT flavor, I'd recommend it to anyone. I was planning to use the egg inside the sandwhich, but forgot and instead used a beaten egg on the top crust, with more asiago cheese. I didn't give this the whole five stars because I agreed with some previous comments; the dough does give a sweet flavor, which really took away from the flavors of the meat and cheese. It was a fine meal, I'm going to be making it again for my boyfriend, but it didn't really wow me. Thanks!

What a winner! My kids couldn't get enough. We used the coldcuts and cheese we had on hand (ham - smoked sausage - chedder and parmesan cheeses) and it was great. Thanks for this EASY, tasty meal!

This recipe is awesome! I made this one afternoon when my sister, brother-in-law, and nephew were visiting and there were absolutely no leftovers.Definitely not for those on a diet, but sooo good.

This baked sandwich is a hit with family and neighbors.  The only change we made was use provolone instead of swiss cheese.  Thanks -

This was good.  Very simple to make, and it tastes just as good the next day.  You can use any meat/cheeses you have on hand, really.  It will still taste good.  I don't think that 3 eggs are necessary... one works just fine.

The only reason I'm not giving it 5 * is because of the greasiness.  I did use pizza dough for the bottom crust and crescent rolls for the top.  It turned out very nice, will probably do leaner cuts of meat next time though.

Quick, easy, and cheap.  The end product was very tasty.  Next time I will probably leave the eggs out and add some more cheese.  A few reviewers suggested pizza dough-- although I liked the crescent roles, I might give the pizza dough a try.  And, I didn't find the meats too salty-- but I've always preferred salt over sweet.

This recipe has become a regular at our house. My husband loves it "as is" with the greasier meats, but I prefer it with leaner turkey and ham so I make it half and half and it works out perfectly. Tastes great, quick to make, easy to modify... five stars!

I thought this sounded really delicious, but was way too salty for me!  My husband liked it, but didn't love it, as I thought he would.  I would suggest purchasing low-sodium products to make this with for anyone trying it out in the future.

With so many modification recommendations from others it was hard to decide how to make this!  I ended up using pizza dough, only provolone cheese and Italian dressing instead of butter.  I thought it turned out quite good and I did not have a problem with greasy meats.  I may add more meat next time because it really was a lot of bread!  I may try creamy Italian dressing next time too - make sure not to skimp on the dressing - it really helps add flavor!

I made this with crescent dough but it does give a bit of a sweet taste to the dish. I added chopped onion and a little oregano which helped to cut the sweetness. This did come out greasy so I drained each square on a paper towel before serving. The paper towel absorbed quite a bit of the grease. Overall this really was a tasty dish and I will be making this again. I'll try the pizza dough suggestion next time.

Thanks Cindy for a great idea-We 
used pizza dough-I spread the bottom dough with fat free Italian salad dressing (vinegrette type), omit the eggs-and pile on the thin slice deli ham,turkey, and occasionally pepperoni slices, my family asks for this every couple of weeks, and with 4 picky kids and my husband to all enjoy this is really saying something-the recipe is very versatile, we have made it with various meats, and vegetables. Quick and easy, clean up is minimal. Thanks again.

The pieces that weren't eaten in the first couple of minutes just turned into mush in the pan.  If I were to make this again, I would follow others' advice and use pizza dough.  The crescent dough is just too wimpy for all that meat and cheese.

Oh my gosh.....this was sooooo good.  I too used creamy Italian dressing in lieu of the egg.  This was really worth making.  Kind of expensive when you buy all the ingredients but worth it. (a little fattening too...but don't tell!)

This was different but not quite as good as I had hoped.  I did use pizza crust dough 
(made in my bread machine) which was pretty good.  The fillings, however, were very 
greasy and the result was very heavy and too rich, even for me.  I tried eating the 
leftovers the next day and ended up tossing them.  I might try making it again with 
different filling, but it'll require quite an overhaul before I'll get my husband to try it 
again.

I am amazed by the number of people trying this recipe!  Our family thought it was ok but not great.  We used pizza bread.  In the past I made a similar dish using a round bread loaf cut in half and hollowed out.  It was filled with sauted mushrooms and onion as well as cheese and sandwich meat.  It was a tastier meal.

This was soooo good and very easy to make - only took about 5 minutes to put together. I used the pizza crust and creamy italian dressing variations. Next time, I may try adding some tomato sauce since it has such a pizza flavor anyway. I will definitely be making this again!

I thought this recipe was great and extremely easy to make!!  I used turkey, ham, and pepperoni as my meats because I'm just not a salami fan but did everything else just as the recipe called for.  I made it for company and they raved and begged for the receipe.  I will definately make this one again!!

Just okay, I was kind of disappointed.  It was extremely dry and was missing something???  I will have to adjust the recipe quite a bit if I make it again...maybe add some black olives and tomatoes to the meat layers and have red sauce on the side for dipping.

This recipe sounded like a really good idea, and the actual dish was good, but just not great. My daughter didn't like it at all. My husband felt it was good, but he didn't go for seconds. I'm not sure I would make it again, but thanks for the recipe.

I have made this many times already and it is great.  You can even change the meats and cheese and it is still great.  I remove the foil at the end and brown it a little longer.

I liked the recipe just the way it is.  Am going to try it with pizza dough as suggested but liked just fine.  When warmed as leftovers a little greasy so you are reminded how 'low fat' it really isn't-only draw back-but still good.  I recommend it.

This was good except for the fact it was a little greesy as a leftover. I used some cheap cresent rolls and the overpowering taste of artificial butter in the rolls made for a weird aftertaste. Luckly the next day the butter flaver seemed to disipate and this tasted better :) Next time I'll try some pizza dough instead.

Overall, this recipe was great!  I did, however, listen to the other reviewers and added a little italian dressing, oregano, garlic powder and some sauted onions.  This helps with the 'somethings missing' that kept comming up on the review chart.  Wonderful recipe, I will make again!

I made this last night using mozzarella and diced pepperoni and it was pretty good. My five year old daughter liked it but kept saying  there was something in there that 'tasted funny'. I don't know if it was the parmesean or what, but she still liked it. It tasted alot like stomboli this way. I'll probably make again.

I did NOT think it had too much egg. I mixed the Parmesan cheese with the egg and drizzled some between each layer of meat and cheese and put the rest on top.  Also I added a layer of whole Ortega green chilis.  Rince and drain chili and open flat. They were great.  Thanks

This was good but very greasy.I drained the grease twice before serving by tipping the pan and pouring the grease out!Maybe precooking pepperoni and salami would help. I added thinly sliced onions and chopped up pepperocini under the cheese layer.Will make again with leaner or precooked meat.

I used turkey, ham, and light/turkey salami in my version of this great recipe.  I followed the reviewers suggestion to use less egg and was happy with the results.  We'll be having this again soon.

This recipe was excellent.  I tried it as is, but will try different variations, like adding Italian dressing. It was very simple to put together and smells great while its baking. This recipe is great as a meal or just for a snack.
Thanks for the great recipe.

Pretty good recipe, although I took the other reviewers' advice and used honey mustard and wished I hadn't. The taste of the honey mustard was a bit overpowering.  I would recommend sticking with the original recipe or using a bit of italian dressing, or nothing at all. The recipe is definately worth a try!!

Follow the recipe or make your own.  So sick of reading comment after comment about the changes they done and what needs to be changed.  Ok great.  Copy a recipe of someone, make a slight change and make your own.

So thanks to everyone’s reviews, i tried to make it less of an artery blocker by using sliced bread instead of refrigerated dough.  I laid 4 slices of bread, thin layers of meat and cheese.  The 3 eggs were great in keeping the shredded cheese together.  When I put egg on top of the sandwich, and a dash of garlic powder, the egg washed the powder all over the top of the sandwich.  I only had to leave the sandwiches in the oven for 25 minutes uncovered to make perfectly crispy sandwiches.  Even my youngest, who’s also the finickiest, finished every bite.  Will definitely make it again!

I am definitely going to make this again...I added tomatoes, onions, submarine sandwich oil, and horse radish sauce... Cooked salami a bit to get some of the grease out... Added numerous meats and cheeses to my looking and it turned out great.

I rated this recipe a 4 ONLY because I changed a few things. However I think this is a great recipe. I was cooking this for my husband and myself so I halved the recipe. I used turkey, ham, and cotto salami, and I only had mixed shredded cheese on hand so I use it and like others said I only used 1 egg which I used most inside but saved a little to brush on the top. I added black olives, diced onion,  Italian spices, garlic and some of "Imo's" Salad dressing. I also made this into a braid and I didn't cover it. I baked it at 350 for 35min. My husband LOVED it!!!

A winner!   I am always looking for easy recipes as I am dieting an finding myself most nights making two separate dinners.  I made as-is except all I had on me is turkey and ham and my two picky eaters gobbled it up and it wasn't greasy at all. I also halved the recipe by using one tube of 8 large crescents. 4 on top and 4 on bottom of pan.  That worked out for 3 people eating it. No leftovers. Will definitely make again.

Good flavor especially with the crescent rolls.  Might try less greasy meats like turkey or chicken but overall was good and will make again.

THIS WAS GREAT!!! I pretty much followed the the recipe but did use a few suggestions made by others. I microwaved my pepperoni a little first just to get some of the grease out(1 minute between paper towels). I used pizza dough instead of crescent roll. My husband cans peppers so we cut some of those up and put them on top of cheese layer along with just a drizzle of the juice from the jar which has oregano, garlic, and oil in it. I did not use the egg in the inside of it but did use it on the outside. 1 egg was plent for the one I made. I topped that with italian seasoning, garlic powder and parm cheese... I served pizza sauce on the side for anyone that may have wanted to dip it...THANKS FOR SHARING THIS RECIPE!!! I will def make again!

This was sooo good. I wish it made more though. I only used 1 beaten egg for the top croissant roll. I also added red onion to one half of it. Next time I will add peppers and mushrooms. I also took a previous reviewer's advice and microwaved my greasier meat for 30 seconds. It worked well.

I love this recipe because it's so easy to make and delicious!!!  Plus you can make it different each time by using different meats and cheeses.  I served this to 4 teenagers and they raved about it .  I served it along with some chicken and rice soup.  Easy and delicious!  When you work all day a recipe like this is a Godsend!  Thanks Cindy for the recipe

My husband thought they were good.  My daughter thought they were great.  I will be trying them again and will be trying some of the variations.  These also would go great with soup.  We will definitely be having them again.

Made a few modifications, but this is a keeper! Used 3 ounces each of salami and pepperoni (it comes pre-packaged that way) and next time will only use 6 slices of each cheese. Served this to my husband, mom, teenage daughter and three of her friends. We all gave it a thumbs up. Thanks for sharing!

My husband loves the hoagie bake.  He said it is like a stromboli.  He requests this at least once a week.  For a little more taste make a side of maranara to dip it in.  It tastes great!

YUM!!!! My dh LOVED this sandwich.  It was a bit greasy for me, but using lighter, less greasy meats might change that.  I used the low fat crescent rolls also.  It was so easy and even my 5 yr old dd loved it.  Thanks!

This was just okay.  Followed the recipe exactly, and the bottom turned out so soggy that the whole thing was falling apart. It was VERY salty; served it was marinara.  I won't make it again.

This was a little too salty for me, but I was feeding 8 kids and they loved it.  I skipped the pepperoni and used lean turkey and pepper jack cheese instead of the swiss.  I made a second one with pizza dough, sliced up italian meatballs, topped it with a little pizza sauce and mozzarela cheese, and the kids went crazy over it. No leftovers at all. Will definately make again.

This is great and easy!  I halved the recipe, but used close to the original amount of meat and it was just the right size for my husband and I!  Next time I might try different meats, my husband thought the salami was a little too spicy.

This was delicious! I made the recipe mostly "as is," other than the cheese since I wanted to use what I had on had, plus I don't care for Swiss anyway. Used shredded mozzarella and a bit of a shredded four-cheese blend. I liked it just the way it was without added spices, but I'm a person with simple tastes, too! I didn't find this greasy at all. Thanks for the yummy recipe, Cindy! My husband just gobbled this up! I'm going to have fun making all sorts of variations, too, like others have mentioned.

Made again a week later with the following changes: lots of meat and cheese and no egg. If you find your hoagie bake too greasy, you've used too much meat and cheese. "Less is More!" The first time I made this, I just did a simple single layer of each of the meats and was generous, but not crazy with shredded cheese and it was the perfect combo of bread and meat and cheese with every bite and not at all greasy! I didn't notice a big difference not using the egg, but for some reason the bake just tasted better using the egg!

Wonderfully quick and easy.  I used cooked italian sausage, canadian bacon, swiss and hot pepper jack cheese and omitted the eggs entirely.  They were not missed and this was baked to perfection as described in the recipe.  Also, what little was left made yummy leftovers. Thank you Cindy.

Was good but missing something.
I added chopped jalepenos,minced garlic, olive oil, and oregano the second time I made it and it was better.

The next time I made it I added cooked sausage and it got even better.

Will make again with my changes.

I thought this was unbelievably easy to make.  I used pizza dough and lower sodium lunchmeats as suggested by some of the other reviewers and it was great!  I'm also going to try some different variations next time, like adding roasted red peppers, different cheeses, etc.

I cooked this very simple dinner last night and it turned out great! Instead of swiss cheese I used pepperjack and that added a nice little spice to the sandwich.  I'll be making this agan for Sunday football games.

Very good and super easy.  Nice and cheesy.  I know that others are chosing to change to a pizza crust, but I thought the croissant crust was perfect.

Everyone really enjoyed this! Although all the salty meats will make you thirsty for the next 6 hours, its a great change from the usual dinner.

This was pretty good.  I used bologna, ham, mozzerella and pepper jack cheese.  Very similar to a local bakery favorite.  My husband wasn't too keen about me using bologna, but that is what I had.  My only issue is that the top crust seemed a little gooey.  Cooked it exactly the way we should've.  Not sure if it was because of the cheese or that the top was not done.

the concept is not a bad one. However, I don't think I'll ever use crescent dough again. someone suggested earlier using pizza dough, I'll use that the next time around. the sandwich was very good, I used turkey, ham, cappicola, mozzarella, jack and parmesan cheeses. I did have to use all three beaten eggs, and my cooking time was shorter than listed, even after I covered it. overall it's as good as the ingredients you put into it, no more no less.

YUMMY! I halved the recipe & used 1 egg.Made it in a 9" square pan. No problems. I suggest flattening & stretching out the dough before you put it in the pan. This first baking did take about 10 mins. longer, but then ovens vary. Would take well to experimenting with different meat & cheese combos. Enjoy - we did!

I made this for a card party we were having and everyone really enjoyed it! This has become such a favorite that the family requests that I make it for lunches now too. 
It is a little salty for me, so I am going to try reduced sodium cheese next time. I am also going to experiment with some different meat and cheese combinations as I have read in other reviews.

Easy and delicious!  I used canadian bacon and pepperoni.  Followed prior reviews and served with pizza sauce to dip.  No leftovers with this meal!

This was a very popular dish with all but one of my family.  One daughter doesn't like provolone or swiss cheese, so I'll do a switch next time so she can enjoy it too.  I think I may also add some hot banana peppers for a little pop!  Thanks for a great recipe Cindy.

Good recipe! This is 'man food', my husband really enjoyed it. Didn't have swiss, so I used mozzarella with the provolone. Will make again.

Although we liked this recipe, next time I plan on making some changes.  My kids thought the swiss cheese was a little strong.  Next time I'll use provolone and mozzerella.  Also, we thought it was a little dry.  I think I'll heat up some pizza sauce and dip the hoagie sliced in the sauce.

Very good!! My family loved it, especially the kids. It wasn't greasy at all. We used salami, turkey & ham with swiss cheese. Next time we're gonna try steakums with sauteed onions and mushrooms with swiss cheese! We can't wait!!

This dish is a favorite amoung my family.  Everytime they visit this is always the request for dinner.  I did find that the 3 eggs were way too much.  There is also no problem with keeping a portion together while eating.  This will make a great snack for many at my next party.

I can't rate it higher because I really tinkered with it. It actually turned into this Stromboli thing my Mom had on the Xmas holidays and I had wanted to recreate it ever since. I used pizza dough and just folded it in half over the layered toppings. I used salami, pepperoni and ham, shredded pizza cheese, and put a little italian dressing on top of all the toppings and added some cut up peppers and mushrooms. Turned out really yummy.

The most-requested "guy food" in our home. I have not had a problem with grease - perhaps because I buy expensive lunchmeat. The paper towel tip below is a good idea! I change NOTHING about this recipe, except that my guys drizzle it with Italian dressing as if it were a real hoagie. A million calories, but really delicious! Note added 11/05: I tried this with ham and smoked turkey instead of the Italian-style meats and it was just as great!

Great recipe! Quick and easy to make! It is hard to find something that all three of my teen boys like..there was none left! I did omit the swiss cheese (though I would have liked it) and used American cheese instead.

Everyone loved this.  My 13 year-old son wants it every day.  I was going to make it on a day that my husband wasn't going to be eating at home and he got upset.  I did use the pizza crust instead of the crescent rolls and I once I used turkey, roast beef and ham with the cheeses but we didn't like it as much.  This is the most requested recipe in this house.  Thanks Cindy.
