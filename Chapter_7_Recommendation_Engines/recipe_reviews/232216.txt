I made these as-written, except that I used crumbled goat cheese in place of the parmesan.  We really enjoyed the flavor--particularly the sun-dried tomatoes--but there just wasn't enough texture to them to make them satisfying.  It was a little too much like eating firm mashed potatoes.  Next time I make these, I'm going to try substituting brown rice or kasha for the breadcrumbs, and using larger pieces of onion and sun-dried tomato.  We also served these with garlic-marinara sauce on top, which was a wonderful addition.

Delicious. I didn't add in the skin as I am cannot digest it well and I used less oil. The sun dried tomatoes were excellent in this. next time, I will also toss in some chopped fresh spinach. If you don't have a shallot, a mild onion would work fine..

I've made this a few times-absolutely delicious.  I put it over a piece of oatnut toast with an american cheese slice and raspberry jelly-to die for
