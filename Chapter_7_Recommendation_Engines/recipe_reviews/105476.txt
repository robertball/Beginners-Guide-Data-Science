You couldn't tell they weren't sugar cookies!  They were very good, baked up nice.  
Things I did differently: I used margarine instead of butter, and just omited the salt, considering margarine has it already added.  Worked well!  
I used my hands to blend the dough, rather than an electric mixer, but JUST till mixed.
Also, I'm Canadian, so I only used all-purpose flour, as our all-purpose flour is different than the American type, finer grind.  Worked just fine!
The other thing I did differently was I used real egg white, but only egg whites!  No yolk!
It's definitly important you chill the dough first though, as it is very soft, and needs that firming up chilling provides, otherwise it would be near to impossible to work with.
I really liked this recipe, despite my subtile differences in how I made it.  I am so glad I came accross it!  Thanks so much!

These are the best no sugar sugar cookies I have ever tried.  Believe me, I have been looking for no sugar cookies for a long time.  It is really my mother-in-laws recipe for pie crust with Splenda added.  Just Great!

These were pretty good, we liked them better when rolled to about 1/8 inch rather than 1/4. When thicker they were a bit gummy, but thinner they became crunchy and the flavor was better. They do leave a slight "sweetner" aftertaste, but I would make them again.
