First off,  my first review but a long time subscriber to Allrecipes, I will always make the recipes as given THEN rate.  This recipe is what I look for,  simple and common ingredients and one pot cooking and easy, the family loved it. I would say look at your ingredients,  I like Muir Glen crushed tomatoes and sauce, good cheeses, it makes a huge difference, I'm not sure I will make lasagna any other way again.

I liked the concept, but took the advice of another poster & added garlic, basil & Italian seasoning to the sauce. It turned out quite tasty.

This was pretty freaking fantastic!  My husband said it was delicious, and my preschooler and toddler both gobbled it down.  Most of the general ingredients were in my pantry.  I used de-cased italian turkey sausage, a jar of pasta sauce, and a can of diced tomatoes, as well as a 12oz box of farfelle noodles because I had all that stuff on hand.  Also subbed cottage for ricotta because that's what I had.  Sauteed some onion & bell pepper with the sausage.  Diced the fresh mozz fine.  It was done in about 40 minutes and made great leftovers.  This will definitely go into the regular rotation.  Although this wasn't exactly lasagna, it was waaaay better than regular old spaghetti!!

Will make this again.  Used 1 lb of Johnsonville Italian sausages and took the meat out of the casings.  I would drain the fat from the pan after cooking the sausages next time.  I used "oven ready" (no pre-cooking required) lasagna noodles which were great and used shredded mozzarella cheese for easy melting.  I used fresh baby spinach and should have torn or sliced it into thin strips which would facilitate it cooking quicker since you add the spinach once you take the skillet off the heat.  Lastly, I added as others have suggested, 1/2 tsp fresh garlic, 1/2 tsp dried basil and 1/2 tsp Italian seasoning. Do check on this after about 15 minutes as I didn't and mine started to burn to the bottom of the pan!

This has some real potential but it is very under seasoned for our taste. I would add garlic, onion, oregano, basil and sub a jar of spaghetti sauce to add much needed flavor.

I made it with a 24 oz jar of prego and 8 oz of water and it was easy and fast and yummy and gooey and comfy and filling and hardly any clean up.  

I love making lasagna, but this is a different animal because it loose and gooey. So next time I might try some wine, whole sausage, capers, fresh peppers , onions and mushrooms, zucchinis, tomatoes, etc.

I made this recipe pretty much as written with the exception of substituting in cottage cheese for the ricotta (my family likes that better) and using homemade spaghetti sauce (made from my garden tomatoes and produce, loads of garlic, onion, basil, parsley, and then frozen for later use) So as several of the reviews stated I boosted the flavor with the extra herbs etc. I have to say my family raved! They actually said they liked this better than the layered, baked version. It is so easy, love the one pan method, and tasty to boot! Will definitely  be making this one again.

I have made this several times now, and its a real keeper, like someone else said.  The first two times I made it as written - tonight I made it without meat.  I used zucchini, bell pepper, mushrooms, and olives and sauteed the veggies with seasonings.  I used a jar of pasta sauce and some water, and this time I used bowtie pasta instead of lasagne noodles.  Great comfort food, easy and great leftovers.

Thank you for this simple and delicious recipe!  I made it meatless because of my vegetarian teen, but it still turned out great!    I added a few things  to make the sauce my own such as garlic, salt, basil and some sugar, but this was a great idea and I appreciate your sharing!

I used whole lasagna noodles instead of breaking them up and produced two layers of meat tomato mixture with two layers of pasta to make it more lasagna like.  Worked well in my cast iron skillet

While not a thing of beauty to serve, it is one of the most delicsious meals I've made from Allrecipies!  I used "hot " Italian sausage (ground, no casing) and added a generous sprinkling of Italian seasoning to the crushed tomatoes and sauce.  I also used a whole bag of baby spinach (3 cups) that I tore up myself, and shredded mozzarella cheese.  This is definitely a keeper!

This was a great quick lasagna like dish -- the only thing I'd do differently, per my kids, is shred the mozzarella rather than slice it.  They didn't like the big chunks.

First time: Prepared strictly per instructions--highly impressed with how few ingredients brought out authentic Italian flair; huge bonus star(s) for being fast and easy! This treasure is worth the effort in exploring the use of other brands of noted ingredients, to find your restaurant quality dish--and just as fun, discovering some creative additional ingredients to tweak . Try "flash toasting" minced garlic in a very hot dry small skillet to the exact moment you see that golden brown just beginning to appear.  Also, use Chef John's method of using briefly exposing spinach to boiling water--then sudden exposure to ice water, to bring out it's flavor.

I used Sweet Italian sausage, left out the spinach, used garlic and basil. My family loves cheese so I made sure to add a lot of Parmesan and Mozzarella, plus extra for toppings. I've made this recipe at least ten times or better and everyone loves it.

This was great. I made it without spinach, because I didn't have any. And I used spiral pasta instead of lasagna noodles. I also added basil, oregano, salt, and pepper. Everyone loved it!

I like the concept behind this recipe as it simplifies the lasagna process. I altered the ingredients so it was more like the oven lasagna that I usually make: used ground beef with 2 cloves of garlic added, cottage cheese instead of ricotta and added basil, parsley flakes, salt and pepper. I used oven ready lasagna noodles and they were just barely cooked after 25 minutes. I had to keep stirring every couple of minutes so that the noodles didn’t stick to the pan.

Normally I always like to make a recipe as written before completing a review, but based on all of the reviews and the ingredient list, I really felt it was going to be bland, so instead of the crushed tomatoes, I used prepared spaghetti sauce with 3 small cans of tomato sauce, minced garlic and some additional basil.  I also used ground beef instead of sausage since I didn't have any on hand.  I think I would consider using maybe half sausage and half beef next time.  I used low fat ricotta and added an additional cup of spinach.  To make it even more healthy, I used high fiber lasagna noodles.  It was very good and easy to throw together.

I've made this meal twice already. My husband loves it. I've changed it a bit. I used minced turkey, feta and cottage cheeses. The next time, I used minced steak, with feta and cottage cheeses. I also cooked up mushrooms, zucchini and onions with sliced black olives. Mixed it in after the first stage. Boy it was great. It's s keeper. Thank you

love how simple this recipe is and  the fact that I can make it without putting on the oven. After reading the the reviews I changed the recipe a bit by stir-frying garlic and onions in olive oil before adding minced pork cooking that threw in a little salt and pepper( very easy on the salt as the cheese is very salty!!) before adding a can of 6 oz tomato paste, tomato sauce, crushed tomatoes, about a teaspoon of capers and a shredded carrot and mixing with the broken lasagna sheets. didn't have ricotta cheese substitute for cottage cheese and mozzarella and it worked out fine. Love it. will definitely make this recipe again. of course I think I will add more chili flakes because it was not hot enough for our palate. thanks for the great recipe!

Such a great idea! Like a grown-up, delicious version of Hamburger Helper lasagna. I did add spices to my taste; I usually make World's Best Lasagna from this site, so I added similar spices as used there (fennel, Italian herb, parsley, basil, sugar, salt) and cooked the sweet Italian sausage with diced onion and garlic. Also I only used 15oz of crushed tomatoes instead of 28oz, which made for a nice thick sauce. Amazing and so much faster than making a layered lasagna!

I used all the ingredients as is in the recipe,  but I added stuff.  That's just me though. I start thinking oh I can add this and this to it.  In addition to the listed ingredients,  I add chopped onions,  chopped mushrooms,  a 32 oz. jar of Ragu Garden spaghetti sauce, garlic pepper and Italian seasoning.  I'm pretty sure I added more of each of the cheeses called for. Anywho, needless to say, this was fantastic and now on my rotation of easy, peasy, delicious, food to make. Thank you to the poster of this recipe! Yeah, this was "Gone in 60 Seconds" pretty much. Ok, I'm exaggerating,  but I had no leftovers.

My wife LOVED it! I thought it was pretty good too. I read the recipe and just winged it from there. I used a jar of good pasta sauce. Threw in some fresh basil and parsley. And my fault, I added too much spinach for my tastes. Overall a fantastic recipe. Oh and use a wide pan or Dutch oven. I used a smaller oval such oven and I filled it to the brim! I will be making this again and again and...

Taste is wonderful, but directions leave a bit to be desired.  When you say large skillet, you mean LARGE skillet.  I started with a 10" cast iron skillet, browned sausage, added noodles, tomatoes and tomato sauce.  Pan was FULL, so I dumped it all in a dutch oven and continued.  
I added a Tbsp of Italian seasoning before adding spinach and cheeses.  Let it sit for an hour, It was very, very good.

Made this on a camping trip and it was delicious!  This is an easy and healthy one-pot meal.

I probably didn't use enough noodles. I had some homemade ones in the freezer. They cooked up good. watch the bottom of the pan so it doesn't burn.Added sauteed onion, 1 clove of garlic, and add Italian seasoning. I also didn't have spinach so I added about 3/4 cup  finely chopped kale the last 5 minutes of cooking noodles. I turned off the heat and added the cheese, but had to put it back on for a couple minutes to get the cheese to melt. Over all not bad.

I've docked one star for presentation because there's simply no way to make this look nice and most diners simply enjoy their food less when it looks messy.  I've docked a second star because other reviewers were right, this recipe requires additional spices, par-boiling the lasagna noodles, stirring to keep the noodles from sticking to the pan, and increasing the amount of sauce and spinach.  I understand that everyone does their own tweaks but this recipe just doesn't seem to work as written.

This recipe was great as written. It's a nice easy quick spinoff of the real thing. I made a double batch and froze one and it held up great in the freezer.

This speedy lasagna is AMAZING!!  The cheese wasn’t quite as melty and bubbly as I’d like the first time around.  The second time I used a cast iron skillet, and threw it under the broiler after adding the cheeses. Melty bubbly deliciousness!

LOVED this recipe. Used tomato sauce with Italian seasoning and sautéed some onion, garlic & mushrooms before browning the meat. My husband and 18 month old loved it too. I may make it two weeks in a row!

We did not find this bland. However, I did use a hot italian sausage, which added a kick. I also added some herbs, including basil paste and italian seasoning, and garlic. There were also some herbs in the crushed tomatoes that I purchased. Both my husband and I liked this and it will be made again.

I uses ground beef instead of sausage with fresh spinach. My family loved, loved, loved it and called it a keeper. Very quick and scrumptious dinner.  We added bread and a loaded salad.

This was very good and easy to make.  I did saute  little  onion and garlic with the sausage, and Italian spice to the sauce.  I used shredded Mozzarella rather than the sliced as that is what I  had on hand.  My husband loved it.

Will probably never make traditional lasagna again. Used lean hamburger instead of Italian sausage and did spice it up a bit with various spices I use in my own lasagna recipe. Simple and clean up is a breeze! My family LOVED it!

This was a great foundation for a skillet lasagna. I changed it up a bit. Sautéed 4 small cloves of minced garlic in  2 Tbsp. EVOO for about 30 seconds then added 1 28oz. can diced tomatoes, 1 8oz. can tomato sauce, 2 Tbsp. chopped fresh oregano, 1 tsp. Italian seasoning, 1 tsp. dried basil, 1/4 tsp. Thyme, 1/2 tsp. salt. Simmered this for about 30 minutes. Meanwhile browned the sausage and added to the skillet about half way through. Added the noodles to the sauce with just enough water to cover. Followed the recipe pretty

As suggested by others, I added garlic and onion. Next time I'll add more spices typical of those in traditional lasagna. This recipe will work w/ pasta other than lasagna noodles. I used oven-ready noodles but will not use them next time as the pieces tend to stick to together.

This recipe is very easy to make.  I used a jar of spaghetti sauce instead of a can tomato sauce and I used fresh tomatoes instead of a can diced tomatoes.  This recipe is bland so I added Italian seasoning, garlic power, onion power, and fresh minced garlic (I love a lot of garlic in Italian food).  The only problem I had was the lasagna noodles TAKING FOREVER to get done.  It says 25 minutes but it took longer than that.  I added a little water to the sauce to help cook the noodles (a little  water didn't affect the sauce) but it still took a long time. Next time I think I'll cook the noodles separate (about half way done) and then add it to the sauce to finish off.

I really enjoyed this one pot meal. I used whole wheat lasagna, cottage cheese, shredded low fat mozzerella, uncased Italian turkey sausage and fresh spinach leaves.  I also used diced tomatoes, marinara sauce and lots of seasonings including italian, oregano, parsley, garlic & onion powders and a pinch of red pepper flakes.  I no longer Have to miss out on lasagna when i am pressed for time.  Would love to try a veggie version...

Delicious, made exactly as recipe called for.  I used no fat recotta, low fat mozzarella, and I had some spinach lasagna
noodles on hand which I am sure added more flavor.  Also used
hot italian sausage.  Sprinkled hot red pepper when serving.  Will definitely make many more times!!!!!!

I just made this yesterday, and my husband can't stop talking about it! :) We all loved it! It was so easy to make, yet so, so, so tasty!  small changes - used 4 italian sausages, took them out of their casing instead of sausage roll...couldn't find this out our local supermarket.   Also, added 2 garlic cloves and some oregano.  
Definitely a must try!

The recipe was simply delicious and just as easy as advertised.  But, as always,  I had to make some changes.  I didn't have lasagna noodles, so I used a little mote than half a box of large shells and cooked it until they seemed done.  I added a little water to make it seem right.  I added garlic and a good belt of Italian herbs to the tomato sauce.  I used almost twice as much cheeses as called for.  It was wonderful.

Turned out great! Added fresh garlic, oregano, salt and pepper. Bought mozzarella slices which melted beautifully over the spinach. Took me 90-minutes from beginning to serving. Added ten minutes to soften the noodles.

This was an easy one skillet meal. Of course I did my own sauce with minced garlic and seasonings to my family’s taste I like that the recipe starts off basic and allows people to put their own seasoning spin on it. Clean up was a breeze and it’s simple to double the recipe to make lunch leftovers. This will be going into rotation. I highly recommend it!

I did try it but it turn out the way it should, the noodles didn't cook all the way through the mozzarella cheese really didn't melt and the flavor wasn't there; I just go back to the way I make lasagna.

A delicious favorite of ours!  I like the easiness of the preparation. Even after a long day of grandparenting it’s quick and easy.

I made this for the first time while we were camping. There were no leftovers. The only change I was told to make was to add some oregano. I'll be adding this into our regular dinner rotation at home.

I doubled the recipe & added seasonings for a flavor boost. The only thing I would do differ-ently would be to precook the noodles before adding to the sauce. My son & husband loved this lasagna.

This was amazing.  I cooked the onions with the meat instead of the sour cream mixture because I don’t like raw onion.  Used ground turkey, with some seasonings.  Added frozen spinach to the tomato sauce for veggies.

I have made this recipe several times since I got the all recipes magazine. Everybody thought it was delicious. I did add Italian seasoning and garlic. I also did not add anything to the sauce and noodles until the last minute.  When noodles where soft, I added spinach, mozzarella, and parmesan cheese. Covered it and let sit for a few minutes for cheese to melt and spinach to get soft but not completely wilted.

Added Italian seasoning but still was rather bland- needs garlic and some onions sautéed with the sausage maybe?  As a method it worked well, used cottage cheese instead of ricotta, and probably added 4 oz of water to sauce mixture.

Easy and quick way to make "lasagna."  We used ground beef and ground pork instead of sausage, as well as onions and garlic when we browned the meat.  I will use a bit more ricotta cheese next time, and a better tomato sauce.  Delicious.

Cut the sausage down to 3/4 lb and still too much.  Mixture was drying out during simmering & had to add white wine.  Noodles were tough, even after trying to cook them longer.  Had to add more seasoning: red pepper flakes, Italian seasoning;  but nothing could save this dish. 
Neither of us could finish our plate and we threw the leftovers out.
Terrible!

I made this according to the recipe (I MAY have added a bit more cheese). It was good, and a nice substitute for the work of actual lasagna. Next time I will try ground beef instead of the italian sausage. It re-warmed well the next day.

I made this twice now and just followed the recipe exactly,.  It was very easy and simple to make.  I gave it a 4 star just because I do agree with other reviewers that this recipe does need some additive spices.  The next time I make this, I will add in garlic, onion powder, oregano, parsley, basil (optional) , Italian seasoning,  mushrooms (optional), and the small jar of  favorite spaghetti sauce.  I printed this recipe out and added the spices to my recipe for the next time.

Substituted the sausage meat for lean ground turkey, and used whole wheat lasagna noodles for a healthier dish. Also added onion, garlic, and fresh basil. Very nice and easy to make! Yummy!

Loved it!! Made it with sausage the 1st time and hamburger the 2nd time.  Liked it both ways. Add more ricotta cheese the 2nd. It seemed more like lasagna to me that way. The simplicity of one pan for a lasagna style dinner can't be beat and all the flavor are there,plus a portion of veggies; win-win.

It was simple to make and quick! Which is why I tried it...I didn't read the reviews before hand which I normally do...all that being said it needed seasoning.  I asked the family their opinion  and the comments were  it was too bland and not enough depth! My fault but I will try it again and follow the suggestions of others...

It's a Super Awesome recipe but i did what everyone else is saying to do is to up the seasoning. I find that if you use Italian seasoning you pick up in any super market, it brings this to a new level of YUM. ...Oh and garlic,  for goodness sake you need Garlic in this to make it hit the a home run.

We enjoyed this. The only trouble I had was that the pasta took longer to cook than the recipe says. Perhaps I should have used the no boil lasagna pasta.

I made this last night for dinner. I did add onion and garlic to the Italian Sausage. I did use ground Italian sausage instead of the roll  because I already had that. The only other change I made was to add about 1 tsp of Italian Seasoning. It was so good!!  Definitely saved this one in my favorites. Best of all my husband loved it.

I made this for my parents tonight, and they told me this was a keeper. I added Italian seasoning, garlic powder, and onion powder to the sauce. Next time I'll make the following changes: sauté onion and garlic along with hot Italian sausage, add Italian seasoning to the sauce, and increase the amount of spinach.

Best recipe I've tried on this site. The whole family loves it & even gets the kids to eat spinach!! I have made it substituting the Italian sausage for ground turkey & prefer this. I also add some onion and seasoning.

Used lean ground beef instead of sausage to cut down on sodium and fat.  
Seasoned with Italian seasoning for flavor

I used crushed tomatoes in purée, sweet Italian sausage, and grated the mozzarella cheese.  I also added fresh garlic , dried oregano, and dried basil.  I added the spices to the sausage just before it was done.  I would definitely make this again!  It was easy and fast for a weeknight meal.

This was great.  I used 2 jars of ready made pasta sauce and 8 oz of crushed tomato sauce which I think was a little too much, I think I would use less next time this turn out great!

As written: this recipe had no flavor. It also needed to have cooked a little longer to finish cooking the noodles. I added garlic powder basil and italian seasoning.

This was easy and tasty.  As others did, I spiced it up a bit with garlic, onion, a little crushed red pepper, and Italian herbs (oregano, rosemary, basil).  Added more cilantro because I love it.  Might cut back a little on the cumin as that flavor came through pretty strong.

Easy and quick! My 6 year old wouldn't stop eating it! Of course I added my own seasoning to it and I used just ground turkey. Will be making this regularly.

Made this last night. HUGE hit. I was concerned about the noodles cooking down but no issues. I added chopped red onion, minced garlic and italian seasonings to the browning meat. I think next time to "spice" up the flavor I am going to try jar spaghetti sauce with different flavorings in lieu of the canned tomato and sauce. I substituted small curd cottage cheese.

I made this as a quick dinner. I used ground beef instead of sausage and added a little garlic and salt and pepper. I tasted great, however, I will probably pre-cook my noodles next time as I was unable to get to the texture I wanted. They turned out a bit chewy. Otherwise very tasty and simple!

Like everyone else said, the meal was very easy to make. I added the fresh basil, half of a yellow onion, some fresh garlic, used a 14 ounce jar of seasoned spaghetti sauce instead of the tomato paste and only used half of the crushed tomatoes. I lightly seasoned the sauce with Italian seasoning and pepper and everything turned out great. Will make again with these modifications.

I also added onion and garlic to this receipt, it was okay however both my husband and I both thought the sauce was too bitter and thick. The next time I am going to use my own homemade sauce., or a high quality jar sauce, I did love adding the mozzarella slices and the ricotta and spinach on top at the end with a cover on.

Added fresh garlic and onions and shredded mozzarella, per another reviewer and it came out delicious. Will definitely make this again.
