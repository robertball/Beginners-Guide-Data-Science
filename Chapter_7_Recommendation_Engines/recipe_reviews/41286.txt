Okay, I have two reviews...kind of...one, before I prepared this I gave it to my mother who a)cooked it in the oven w/ foil, b)Made it with whole cranberries and c)used 1/4 cup of sugar. She had 6 guests over and they all loved it and begged for the recipe! I made it today in my slow cooker with jellied and a little over a fourth of sugar and it was tender and amazing! I cooked it on low for 5 and a half hours and it was done(meat thermometer registered at 170). I was incredible and very man friendly! So two points here, if you don't have a slow cooker it is still great in the oven and if you don't have jellied, whole will suffice! Oh and also, to skim fat a paper towel does the trick!

Substituting 1/2 cup Orange Juice for the Cranberry Juice and cutting the clove and sugar (I used brown sugar) measurements in half gave this recipe the added zip & zing it was missing.  I also used cranberry sauce (with whole berries) instead of the jellied cranberry sauce.  
It was supurb!

I took the advice of others and used the whole berry cranberry sauce, 1/4 c brown sugar, 1/2 c orange juice, 2 cloves of garlic, 1 tsp dry mustard, salt & peppered then braised the roast prior to cooking.  I didn't bother to thicken the sauce, just served it over the roast with rice. This was delicious.  Ignore any negative reviews this recipe is great for something different (but not too different!)

I've made this a dozen times and it never fails.  I do suggest you make sure the meat is completely covered with the cranberry sauce mixture and check early for doneness.  Regardless of the gravy, the meat is soooo tender.

Easy and tasty recipe. Made the corrections offered by others ( 1/4 c.brn sug., whole cranberry sauce, 2 cloves minced garlic, 1/2 c. OJ. and omitted cloves) I also seasoned with s & p and browned meat on all sides before tossing into slow cooker. Mr. Picky, uh, I mean my husband loved it.

I've had a similar recipe for years and have never browned the meat. For variety try adding a can of unsweetened crushed pineapple, juice & all instead of the cranberry juice. Also can add a clove of garlic and some onion...yummy!!

My husband and I gave this a 5.  We loved the sweet tangy taste of the sauce with the pork.  Our housemate gave it a 3 because she enjoys more of a salty taste with her meat instead of sweet.  I did as others said and used brown sugar instead of white.  I also used 1/2c. of Cranberry juice and 1/2c. of apple juice.  And finally I seasoned the meat with salt pepper and garlic powder and broiled the meat for 7 minutes on each side.  The final result was delicious.  I served this with some stuffing, Potatoes au Gratin and some green beans sauted in some butter, white wine, garlic, salt, pepper, and Ginger.  Yumm Yumm!!!  Add a side salad and you have a very delicious meal!
2/26/2004-I overcooked it, so it was on the dry side.  Very disapointed this time.

I used cranberry raspberry juice since that was what I had, and then cut the sugar altogether.  It came out great.  The gravy was thick enough to use as a sauce without thickening & we didn't use it over potatoes.  I did a mushroom/orzo pilaf instead.  Leftovers are great.

wow, this is the Best pork roast receipe.  The only thing I did different is cut down the sugar by half.  The only juice I had was orange and it worked great.  Thanks so much for sharing. Darlene

I was a little leary about this recipe but decided to try it because of all the good comments and high ratings.  I'm glad I did.  It was not what I expected.  My husband rated it as a "keeper"!  I made it as directed, but will probably halve the sugar next time.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was soooooo good!!!  We absolutly loved it!!  We served the gravy over mashed potatoes----YUMMY!  I put only half of the sugar it called for, and was terrific.  It probably would still taste good with less sugar.

This was wonderful!  I didn't have time to make it a crockpot meal, so I mixed up the sauce (I used whole berry) and other ingredients and poured it over the roast and some cut up squash in a roasting pan.  I baked it uncovered in the oven at 325 for 1.5 hours and it came out perfectly!!

Very tasty!  I made a few modifications as per the advice of other reviews...  I grabbed two sweet potatoes and peeled and cut them into really big chunks and threw those in first.   Then I sprinkled 1/4 cup brown sugar over the sweet potatoes.  (and I left out the white sugar)  And I used 1/2 cup orange juice instead of the cranberry juice.  And at the very end, I didn't even bother to make the gravy...just scooped out some of the juice back onto our plates with the meat and potatoes.  It was very tasty.  And not too sweet at all.  A very nice change to the normal "pot roast."

This was really good.  I too used apple juice instead of cranberry juice, and added a splash of apple cider vinegar to offset the sweetness.  My husband loved this and he is definitely not fond of food usually made in the crockpot.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this last night, and it was a hit! My husband isn't big on roasts done in the crockpot, so I modified this recipie a bit...When the roast was done, I removed it from the crockpot and placed it on a baking pan that I had sprayed with non-stick spray. I then sprinkled black pepper over the roast, and topped it with a thin coating of minced garlic (about 2TBS). I then placed it in a 350 degree preheated oven for about 20 minutes, and YUM! The garlic made the roast less sweet and gave it more of a tang! I served it with a large tossed salad, some onion/dill bread, and mashed sweet potatoes. Nobody ate the gravy, but the roast was DEMOLISHED!

This recipe was totally mouth watering. We wanted to do something different this year instead of making turkey or ham. It was so easy to make. It was easy to convert to a 7.42 lb roast. Everybody loved it. The family eat every mouth watering bite. I have never seen my family eat like this before. It was awsome, and made me smile that there wasn't a single crumb left. Everybody asked me for the recipe so they can make it in the future. It was a smash hit.

This was so easy.  I love that it doesn't need to be browned first before putting in the crockpot.  Who wants to brown meat in the morning?!  My husband and I really liked this.  I used orange juice instead of cranberry juice otherwise I followed the recipe.

This pork was excellent, a definite keeper. I took previous suggestions and cut the sugar and cloves in half and it came out very tasty. My choosy husband just loved it. And, this could not have easier to make!  Will make again and again...have passed it on to friends and family!

I couldn't believe how good this was for a crock pot recipe, nor the presentation of the end product.  The cranberry sauce makes for a thickened tasty dark gravy--served over sliced meat and guests were impressed.  Nice on a Fall night, with a salad, french bread and mashed potatoes.

I have tried a similiar version of this recipe, but I believe this is really an improvement = the taste is so smooth and the prep  is so easy; the 
leftovers get better and better!!  Excellent for special occasions = just "different" enough to
be remarkable.    claudette

My family liked this.  The previous reviews were helpful in making a couple of adjustments.  I cut the sugar in half, omitted the cloves and added 2 dashes of allspice.  I used 2 tablespoons of orange juice concentrate in place of the cranberry juice, which I was out of.  Everyone thought this was yummy.  Thanks!

I would defintely recommend that cooks either omit the cloves or only add a dash.  The cloves totally overwelmed the flavor and ruined this dish in the opinion of all 5 of us in my home...
I think it *does* have potential to be a good dish - the meat was tender - if these changes were made..

Excellent and easy.  A different way to fix pork roast.  Really good with mashed potatoes.  Made it just like the recipe instructed.

I did this in the oven instead of the crock pot. First I cooked it at 380 for 1 1/2 hours and then covered it with foil for 30 mins on a low setting.

It was good, but could have stood to be cut a little with an apple flavor.  I'm going to try throwing in a couple of diced apples or maybe some apple sauce next time.

While the flavor was really good, I was disappointed at how dry the roast was.  I didn't think the gravy went well with mashed potatoes, as suggested, because it was sweet.  I don't think I'll be making this one again.

Before making this for father's day dinner I read a good number of reviews.  In place of the cranberry juice I substituted chicken broth and did not add the sugar as it was in my opinion sweet enough.  I also added some dry onion soup mix and pepper.  I also added to taste some Emril's Essence.  My husband felt that the gravey needed something.  I cut up the pork and simmered it in the gravey for about 1/2 hr.  My family gave it four stars.  I would make it again.

This was very tender and juicy - I let it cook for 7 hours.  Also, I put two large sweet potatoes (peeled and quartered) into the slow cooker, put the sugar (I used brown) on top of them, then added the pork and other ingredients.  It worked great and had a built-in side dish!

This is the best pork roast I've ever eaten.  I followed earlier recommendations, using 1/4 cup brown sugar instead of white sugar, oj instead of cranberry juice, 2 cloves garlic, omitting the cloves.  I don't know why, but the gravy is a beautiful golden brown, and it is fabulous, especially with the suggested mashed potatoes.

This was odd. Between the meat in a crockpot taste, and the "I cant quite identify anything in the sauce" going on. Over potatoes? NO WAY unless you like an overly sweet sauce with your vegis. Will not make again not even with changes.

I wish there was a no stars button for this. I thought for sure that we would like this. We aren't awfully picky here, but we could not even eat this roast, not plain anyway.  It was tender as always when cooked in the crockpot, but this recipe didn't add ANY taste at all, nothing. Roast was very bland and the only thing we did different was add whole cranberries and a little more cranberry juice(to add the sweetness the c.sauce would have). It was awful! As for the making the sauce into gravy, it did not look very appetizing to even consider even after the whole berries were strained.  I hate putting a negative review and maybe this was a fluke, but I won't waste another piece of meat trying it again to find out.  I have never written a negative review before, so it's got to be bad if I put a review in when I usually just throw a recipe out I don't care for.  But this was not even close to the many descriptions on this page that it was such a huge dissappointment relative to the huge volume of positive reviews. I really expect a sure thing with that many positives.
Glad so many like it, but that was not our experience at all and we are big cranberry, clove, and pork fans to boot.

This was a very flavorful dish!  But I made a 1.5 pound roast and scaled back the ingredients.  I did use apple juice instead of cranberry, only a 1/4 cup sugar, whole cranberries, one whole clove and I did rub the roast with cracked black pepper and minced garlic.  The outcome was amazing.  The only thing I will do differently was triple the "gravy" ingredients with the exception of the sugar because the roast was very dry and I had it on low for 6 hours.  The roast needed to be sitting in the gravy mixture, not on top of it.

I thought this recipe looked really good. Even reading the other reviews, the bad ones mostly mentioned that they had used substitute ingredients so I didn't pay them much heed. Unfortunately, I really should've paid attention to the advice on using less clove. I actually like cloves, but they don't taste quite right mixed with cranberry. I think this recipe might be a lot better leaving the cloves out entirely and cutting the sugar about in half. I might try it again in the future like that, but it'll be a while.

This was extremely easy to make.  I wish I had followed the suggestions of others to cut the sugar in half.  The gravy was too sweet for our taste, but the meat itself was very good.

i made this EXACTLY as directed (but w/o cloves as i ddnt have any) and it was awesome.  my parents came over for dinner and kept raving about it.  they even took the leftovers home and my dad asked me to give my mom the recipe.  none of us had ever made pork loin in a slowcooker before but i highly recommend it!  my dad was especially impressed w/the gravy!  i served it w/mashed potatoes and a salad.  will make it again.  ez dish that comes across like a holiday dinner!

This was pretty good.  I reduced the sugar down like others had suggested.  As it cooked, the cranberry jelly made like a crust on the pork and that was very good.  I shredded up the leftovers and added it with leftover rice and veggies to make like a stew for the next night.  Will make again.

Oh dear - there are not many things that I consider completely inedible but this was one of them. I followed the recipe exactly but should've taken the advice of other reviewers to use chicken broth or apple juice instead of the cranberry juice. It was so sour/bitter. I don't care for cranberry all that much anyway but I thought by adding some brown sugar it would take the tartness down a bit - nope. And the cloves just didn't work with the cranberry - at all. This was just not my cup of tea - sorry : (

Oh, my Gosh! It was awesome! Very, very delicious! Everybody loved it! Gravy was indescribable…yummy! I definitely will cook again! However, the next time instead of jellied cranberry sauce I’ll put whole berry sauce or maybe jellied sauce + fresh cranberries.

This is a definite winner.  I made it for a neighbor over a year ago, and to this day they still talk about the time I brought over the best pork roast ever!  I followed the recipe to the "t", and it was wonderful.

My husband was not a big fan of meals cooked in the slow cooker until I made this recipe.  He loved it. I did use brown sugar and cut the amount in half as others suggested.  I also added some chopped onion and fresh garlic.  To help cut the sweetness, I also added a can a chicken broth.

This was soooo good!   I did make a few minor changes, I had white cranberry juice on hand and that was what I used, and as per advice from prior reviewers I used brown sugar instead of white.   I also didn't measure the cloves, I just shook a healthy dusting into the crock pot--I know it was probably more than called for.

The spicy sweet sauce makes the pork very moist and succulent.   I can't remember the last time my husband ate any kind of steak or roast without smothering it under his favorite steak sauce---until last night!

Five stars and an mmmm mmmmm MMMMMHHH!

I love this recipe. The pork turns out so tender and yummy. It is a little sweet but it's delicious. I use whole berry cranberry sauce and only 1/4 cup of sugar and that cuts down on it being overly sweet. I've also used the Ocean Spray Cran Fruit orange cranberry and it's really good too.

I made a few alterations based on other reviews and this was a hit to my very-picky-never-give-me-anything-new hubby and his parents - they review it at five stars!  My alterations included using whole-berry sauce, orange juice and just a dash of cloves.   I shredded the leftover pork and mixed it with equal parts leftover gravy and BBQ sauce for some awesome sandwiches the next night.

This was the easiest and best tasting pork roast WE have ever tasted. I had a 5lb roast and decided to cut it in half for the recipe, everyone loved it sooo much I made the other half later in the week.  Served it with yams, honey butter and salad. yuuuuummmmmmmm!

The pork was VERY tender, it fell apart when I tried to cut it, and I used a boneless pork loin blade.  I loved it with the mashed potatoes (momma's mashed potatoes), the gravy had a sweet and tart kick to it, I did season my pork before putting it into the crockpot though with garlic powder and pepper,.  I loved the taste, unfortunatley it was a little too different for my 3 year old and husband, he did not like it although he said the meat was very tender.  Served it with brown sugar buttery carrots.

What an easy, quick, and tasty recipe! My husband usually doesn't like roasts because he says the meat is "stringy", but he loved this recipe. We cooked it in the crockpot for 8 hours and the roast wasn't dry or tasteless. We did, however, leave the roast and the sauce in the crockpot and just added the cornstarch and water to it just because we were in a hurry and forgot about step two in the directions. The sauce was delicious and the addition of cloves gave a wonderful taste to the sauce. We'll definitely make this again. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was a good base.  The pork was a bit bland so the second time a made it, I pre-seasoned the pork (rubbed in garlic, some seasonings and olive oil) and let it sit in the fridge for a few hours.  I left out the cloves (based on the suggestions of others), used apple juice instead of cranberry juice,  reduced the sugar by half and used canned whole cranberries (vs. the jellied type).  With these adjustments, the pork was great.

Crazy, but I had never used a crock pot before this.  This was wonderful.  The whole house smelled incredible.  The pork was fork tender.  The gravy to me was great; a bit sweet for my husband.  I used water instead of cranberry juice.
I will definitely be making this again

Sorry, we were just not impressed with this one.  I love cranberries and the combination with pork sounded wonderful but it just didn't come together.  The meat was a little dry and the zing of the cranberries seemed to be lost in the slow cooking process. I did use whole cranberry sauce, because that was what we had, maybe that made the difference?

The recipe was well received by my family, however I don't think I will make it again unless I make substantial changes.  It was too sweet and I wasn't crazy about the cloves.

I tried this recipe today and we all loved it!  I threw a frozen pork roast in the crockpot and cooked it for 6 hours.  This will make a great holiday meal!

Watch out for the cloves!  I added less than what was called for, yet I still felt it was too much.  Next time I will add just a pinch.  To replace the juice, I added water.  And I also only added a tablespoon of sugar. The end result was really very tasty and the meat was extremely tender.  I used country ribs in place of the roast.  We will be making this again.

Delicious and easy pork recipe! To cut the sweetness, I reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup and used apple juice instead of cranberry. I also used a can of whole cranberries as opposed to jellied. My husband loved this dish, especially the gravy. Definitely a recipe to keep!

This pork turned out great. I substituted a can of cranberry sauce (with the berries in it) instead the the jelled.  When served it looked great with the berries.

I so appreciated the other reviews.  Since the two negative reviews complained about the sweetness, I replaced the juice with water and omitted the sugar.  It was well received by family and guests.  I will definitely remake!

Great recipe!  My husband liked it, and it's one of the few meats my three year old has eaten, in which he didn't chew one piece for an hour.  I only had a 1.5 lb roast and only cooked it for about 5 hours, maybe could have even been cooked less.

This was really easy to prepare, but the overall taste was a little funky.  It wasn't bad, but definitely don't make the gravy unless you like it sweet.  Next time I would use less sugar and a little less cloves.

I used brown sugar, subbed orange juice, didn't use the dried mustard. This was very good, it is now one we eat often. The pork is very moist and tasty from the cranberries. Will make again and again, thanks Valerie!

I followed the suggestions made by many of the reviewers and it ends up changing almost every ingredient but it works!  I highly suggest following the modified recipe for the sauce:

1 can jellied or whole cranberry sauce (I used jellied),
1/4 c. brown sugar,
1/2 c. orange juice,
2 tsp. minced garlic,
2 tsp. dijon mustard.

I poured this over 2 pork tenderloins that I had seasoned with salt and pepper and cooked on low in my crock pot for 7 hours.  It was so tender it practically fell apart when I sliced it.  I poured some of the thickened sauce over the slices and served the rest on the side.  Whether to use jellied or whole cranberry sauce depends on your taste.  I thought it would go over better with the kids if there weren't lumps in the sauce so I used jellied.  The kids absolutely loved it.  With these modifications this is one of the best recipes I've found on this site.

Very good, the cranberry added a nice flavor.  Left it in the crockpot a little longer than the recipe says and it still turned out great.  Gravy was very tasty, too.

This was ok.  I omitted the juice and sugar completly, it was still quite sweet for my liking.  I also added carmalized onions and apple slices, that helped the flavor out a bit.  Pork roast in the crock pot is just too dry.

Very delicious!  I took the advice, and used 1/4 C brown sugar instead of 1/2 C white.  I didn't have cloves, so I used a dash of cinnamon.  Worked very well, and the gravy was delicious!

This dish is delicious!  It can be sweet, though. What we did was use the whole cranberry sauce instead of the jellied. It added a little more tartness to it.  I smashed the cranberries up before adding. Also, we use "light" cranberry juice, which has less sugar.  One last thing that I do - add the cornstarch mixture in the slow cooker after the pork has been removed and kick the temp up to high. Stir that for a few minutes, and you'll have one fine gravy and one less saucepan to clean.  We have this dish about once a month, served with mashed potatoes and corn.  It's a favorite!

my family loved this roast!  I added a chopped onion, 1 tsp of cider vinigar & replaced the cranberry juice with apple juice.  I think it would also be good if the jiuce was replaced with beer or pork broth.

I made this recipe over the weekend and it turned out great. I seared my roast on all sides prior to putting in the crock pot. Also I ommited the mustard and cloves I used a 1/4 tsp of apple pie spice instead. I grated 1 tsp of orange rind into the cranberry sauce and cran juice and simmered the sauce till smooth prior to pouring over the roast then into the crock pot for 6 hours. This comes out tender and has a great flavor. Makes great sandwiches as well.

I really enjoyed this meal.  I used whole cranberry sauce and boneless pork chops.  I think next time I would rather use a bone-in pork roast.  Boneless pork cuts tend to dry out when I slow cook them...but bone in cuts remain juicy.  I was worried about how the gravy would taste but it was really very good.  Even my 5 year old gobbled it up.  =O)

This recipe was great! I made some modifications though. I used frozen cranberries (about 1 1/2 cups) and put them in the microwave to defrost. Then I added about 1/4c of brandy and then cooked them a few more minutes, then squished them with a spoon. Then I added about 3/4c of brown sugar, 1/8 tsp allspice, and 1/8 tsp nutmeg, and the 1 tsp dry mustard, 1c cranberry juice. I cooked it on high in the slow cookeker for 4 hours, but I think it was actually done by 3-3 1/2 hours. Will DEFINITELY make this again for guests.

It was very easy and very good, but my husband and I both agree, next time we would decrease the spices a bit, especially the cloves. We also substituted cranberry-apple juice for the cranberry juice and used brown sugar and added some dried onions. Very good!

I made this pork roast for New Year's dinner and it was amazing. It's a foolproof crockpot of delight!

Wonderful!!  My boyfriend and I loved this dish!  Practically fool-proof, too!  I followed suggestions in other reviews and used orange juice instead of cranberry and also used 1/4 c. of brown sugar.  Delicious and so tender.  Gravy is YUMMY!

My husband and I loved this recipe.  I had most of the ingredients onhand, so I decided to try it.  I used some brown sugar, orange juice and a few whole cloves since that's what I had.  I didn't have time to make the jus into a gravy, so I left it as is.  Even with just the jus, it was so flavourful, and the pork was melt-in-your-mouth.  Will definitely make this one again.

Excellent. Took the advice of others and used orange juice and brown sugar in place of cranberry juice and sugar. The gravy was tasty. This receipe is definitely a keeper.

My picky family loved this recipe.  Took advice of a reader and changed white sugar to brown sugar and whole cranberry jelly.  I also used orange jucie instead of cranberry because that is all I had.  My husband who hates leftovers took some for lunch the next day.

Traditionally, my family likes pork with garlic, salt/pepper...However, I thought I'd try something new.  No fault to the recipe, it only went over with 3 of my family members.  They are the ones who rated it.  The other three wouldn't take more than a bite - I realized we don't like the sweet pork combo.  I too cut the cloves to a sprinkle.

Excellent!! Very moist and tasty. I also added the OJ in place of cranberry juice, brown sugar in place of white, etc as others suggested. Cooked it for 8+ hours (Had a 7# loin) and it was terrific. Did not make the "gravy" as it didn't look too appealing to work with and we didn't really need the potatoes. This will be a Xmas favorite to be sure! many thanks!

Excellent roast!  I've made it several times and always get asked for the recipe.  Even impressed my mother-in-law!  So easy since it's in the crockpot and the gravy tastes great over mashed potatoes.

It was okay, pork was really very tender and it's taste was out of ths world.  However, the cranberry sauce left much to be desired.  Our family prefers the good old natural pork gravy I make from roasting in it's own juices and broth I have saved from past recipes. Probably won't make again.

The pork and the gravy were delicious! I've made this recipe twice now. The first time I made it, my husband loved it so much that just last night I made again, this time for a big family dinner -- 11 people -- and it was a HIT! (Needless to say, I doubled the recipe!) I followed the recipe almost exactly, other than using home-canned, or store-bought canned cranberry sauce (not jelly). Everything else, though, I went with as is. It was superb!

Did not care for this combination of flavors at all.  It certainly sounds good when reading the recipe, but it was bland and just a bad recipe.  I didn't have potatoes with it, but I can't imagine putting this "sauce" on potatoes.  I imagine it would have been worse than on the pork.

I agree with the reviewer who wished for no stars.  The roast was moist but there was no flavor and the flavor of the remaining juice was bland.  I even added an envelope of Lipton Onion soup mix thinking that would spice it up.  I tossed the juice and then added homemade BBQ sauce for pork sandwiches.

I served this recipe on Christmas day for my family, it was a big hit I have a 3 year old and a 6 year old who are very picky eaters, and the both had 2 helpings of this pork. I found this recipe to be easy to make and very flexible in adding or subtracting items to taste. I did not make any adjustments this time, but I will probrably add some orange juice or hone to substitute the sugar

I used a really bad cut of pork for this recipe, and it was still great!  It has a very unique flavor, so be prepared for a sweet roast and sweet gravy.  It's perfect for holiday meals, and I'm making it again for my family over Christmas.

Very unique taste.  I love cranberry and pork together, and it made a great gravy for potatoes.  The only thing is, after 6 hours on low, the roast got a little dry.  I would check it at 4 and 5 hours next time for doneness.  Other than that, very tasty!

It's possible I did something wrong, but usually I read the recipe, get the consensus of the  reviews and alter the recipe based on that.  Well, I tried half the sugar and used orange juice and whole berry cranberry sauce.  The pork was in the crock pot for about 6 hours.  The sauce was mediocre at best and the pork was dry and stringy.  I'm glad so many others enjoyed it, but in my home it was not well recieved (and my kids are not overly fussy.) Too bad, I like Taste of Home and had high hopes.  Maybe I should have just used the recipe as is, but maybe not.

Heavenly! Any Newfoundlanders out there - I used partridgeberry jam (a close cousin to cranberries)instead of cranberry sauce. It was excellent!

It tasted good but I didn't like the color of the sauce. I used the whole berry cranberry sauce; the jelly sauce may have been made a prettier color.  I will fix it again.  It is soooo easy and great for company.

I used 1/2 the sugar, substituted apple juice for the cranberry and omitted the cloves.  It was a nice change from the ordinary.  I will make this again from time to time.

This is very tasty and smelled heavenly while cooking. I omitted the sugar and used whole berry cranberry sauce. I don't have a crock pot so I used a Reynolds cooking bag.

Actually, I make this with a pork shoulder butt roast and simmer it in 1/4 cup of water on the stove.  Pour off fat.  Brown well, add salt and pepper and 1 can of whole cranberry sauce only.  Simmer on top of stove for 2 to 3 hours (pour off juice as it accumulates).  Thicken sauce and serve over meat and/or potatoes.  Lots less sugar and all the taste.

This recipe is great!!!  I did change it a little though.  I omitted the cloves and reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup.  Also, I only cooked it for 3-4 hours on low- anymore and it would be dry...just check it with a thermometer!!  The gravy is great over the pork and for cranberry lovers over potatoes too.

Was excited to try since it was rated by so many, but wasn't impressed with the taste.  Much too sweet, maybe too much sugar?  Little brother said that it tasted like candy and ate it up good, so maybe i'll save this for when I get married and have kids of my own.

I thought it was great! Wonderful for a Sunday meal. I too used half the sugar and half the cloves and I think it taste very good. I wasn't going to make the gravy but I am glad I did, it really gave the final touch!!!Ü

We really like this recipe.  I use Splenda but take the juices after it has cooked in the crockpot all day and reduce until thick and serve to the side for a garnish to eat with the roast.  That way you don't have to eat the sauce if you don't want it.  The roast is very good.

I put this in the crock pot on low all day. The roast was perfect -  well cooked and well seasoned. I served it to a dinner guest. She, my husband, and I were not crazy about the gravy. I didn't add as much sugar, as I don't care for too-sweet sauces. My one complaint is that the clove flavor was too pungent. Just a dash would do next time. I think I would venture to try it again.

I prepared this roast for company. I wasn't very impressed at all. It was O.K. but I don't think I'll be making it again. The sauce was just too sweet! I guess I'm used to a more "meaty" flavored type of gravy??? and the roast was a little dry too. The one good thing I have to say is it smelled heavenly as it cooked!

I thought this was just OK.  The sauce was way too sweet in my opinion and I even cut the amount of sugar in half.  The meat really didn't have much flavor either, but it could have just been my cut of meat (a sirlion pork roast).

To make the gravy more appealing, I used 1 cup of the crockpot mixture along with  1 cup chicken stock.  That mellowed out the flavor quite a bit and made this more edible.  I won't be making this again.

I liked this recipe quite a bit.  But like others, I did make a few modifications.  I used a pork tenderloin, omitted the cloves, used a bit more mustard, a little less sugar and used whole cranberry sauce instead.  It was a very different, but great tasting pork recipe.  I will probably make this again and try different variations of it.

Perhaps it isn't fair of me to review this recipe because I didn't make it to the letter.  I took others' recommendations and substituted the cranberry juice for chicken broth and then cut the sugar down to a 1/4 cup.  Still seemed overly sweet.  My husband enjoyed it a lot and the pork was very tender, but the gravy was a bit much for me.

This is the first time I ever made a pork roast and I will never look for another recipe for one!  Absolutely tender and delicious!!!  I served it with green beans, egg noodles, and sauteed fresh mushrooms and onions.  The only problem I had was that since I was at work while it cooked, I couldn't turn off the crock pot soon enough, so the meat was a little dry (it probably should have cooked closer to 6 hours, not 8).  After slicing the roast, I let it sit in the thickened sauce awhile and it became juicier.  I will definitely make this again....it will be great for dinner parties!

What an easy and delicious recipe!  I used a boneless rib end roast, and it turned out juicy and tender.  I also used apple juice and cut way back on the sugar.  My husband doesn't care for pork, but he loved this and asked me to make it again.

This is delicious and great for any holiday!  I've even used apple juice instead of cranberry juice and it was just as good.

I have adapted this recipe a little for my family's taste buds, but this is an awesome recipe and not time concsuming at all. I think that it is great served with rice.

After reviewing comments from others, I made this with the 1/4 c. Brown Sugar, 1/8 tsp. Ground cloves. Browned my roast first, also added 1 cup of chicken broth. This was still a little too sweet. My husband liked it but said he wouldn't care for it real often. Again, everyone has their own tastes so this recipe is worth trying.

My husband loved this dish but i thought it was way too sweet and surprisingly so did my kids. We are not fans of cloves so I left them out perhaps that is what really helps make the dish.

I thought this was a great recipe.  I made 2 substitutions.  First, I used a pork sirloin roast, which cost less because there is a small bone left inside.  Then, I used brown sugar instead of white.  Came out great and my family loved it.

I followed another reviewer's recommendation and finished the sauce right in the crock pot.  I also found that mixing the cornstarch with 2 tablespoons of the hot sauce from the crock pot makes a smoother paste to start with.

This is one of my favorite slow cooker recipes!  I love it and everyone I make it for raves about it.  In addition it makes the house smell wonderful all day.  I add potatoes to the slow cooker and they taste deliciously sweet served with the pork.

This is a great recipe.  I cooked a 6lb roast so I doubled the recipe.  I followed the advice of others and added just 1/4 cup of brown sugar and chicken broth instead of the juice.  My company loved it and raved about the gravy.

This was very easy to make but I found it too sweet and I didn't even use any sugar. I took the advice of using chicken stock and I added carrots and potatoes which turned out great.  I recommend using less cranberry sauce and no sugar.

This was great! I didn't have time to make the gravy so I just spooned the sauce over the slices of pork. I think the gravy would be awesome because the sauce was wonderful. I used the whole cranberries as suggested by others and liked having a bite of cranberry occasionally with my pork verses just having the sauce.

This was outstanding!!  I also tried it for beef brisket (not corned) and chicken pieces.  My kids LOVE this and it is so easy.  I have found it turns out better when you   remove as much fat as possible from whatever meat you use. I added apple cider instead of water. The gravy is great even without the cornstarch.
I served it with rice and it is a family favorite.

This was awesome. The pork was so tender. I used only 1/4 cup of sugar instead of 1/2. When I made the gravy, I added about 1/2 cup of chicken stock and it turned out really good. I will make this again. Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent! I don't even like pork and I enjoyed this. I put it in the slow cooker on high and waited until the thermometer registered 170 degrees, it took about 4 1/2 hours.

I made the recipe with the recommended changes (substitute brown sugar for white and reduce to 1/4 cup; substitute orange juice for cranberry juice; reduced cloves to 1/8 tsp). Was very good. Still sweet. Might try it again with the original cranberry juice instead of orange juice. I didn't bother making the gravy for potatoes.

Great way to welcome Fall. I omitted the sugar. Because I did not have cranberry juice I used chicken broth instead. Wonderful with roasted sweet potatoes and hearty brown rice.

I really enjoyed this recipe, but the gravy was too sweet.  I followed it to the letter, with the exception of changing the sugar to 1/4 C brown sugar.  I had to cut the sweetness with 2 teaspoons of cider vinegar (which worked wonderfuly).  Taking 1 1/2 C of the sauce and cutting it with 1/2 C chicken broth also make it more patable.  I'll make it again, without any sugar.

Made this for my dad for father's day and it was a hit. I followed the advice of others and used brown sugar instead of white. I also used whole cranberry sauce and cranberry-rasperry juice. The roast I bought was very lean so I was able to make 4 cups of this wonderful gravy. I did not, however, care for the gravy on my potatoes...too sweet. It's fab on the pork though.

I didn't much care for this. I guess it was edible, but I won't be making it again. It was partly my fault because I cooked the roast for 9 hours and it ended up dry, but the flavors of the sauce were just kind of odd. The cloves especially.

Yum yum yum!  I have made this several times and served it with mashed potatos.  The last time I made stuffing with craisins and walnuts.  My husband gobbled it up!  I have used a whole pork roast and also individual thick-cut pork chops.  I also sometimes use whole cranberry sauce, and I make the gravy using butter and flour for a roux, instead of the cornstarch in the recipe.

This recipe is EXCELLENT. I put some extra mustard powder on the roast before pouring over the sauce.
I served this with mashed red potatoes. It was fabulous.

Since I left out several ingredients (sugar, dry mustard, and cloves) and substitued water for the juice (seemed like it didn't need juice with the can of jellied sauce), I may not have given this recipe its best shot. The pork was very tender and had a mild flavor, but it definitely needed salt. I'll probably make this again, but adjust it hoping to perfect its taste.

I made this one last night. I loved it...although I listened to the reviews about it being sweet and adding less sugar and to also go with brown sugar. On those notes...I wish I had went with the full amount as I only used 1/4 cup brown sugar and it was not sweet at all. I probably will not be making it again as hubby did not like it. My little one enjoyed it but I do not think that I would go through the effort for just he and I. There would be way too much left over. If you like pork though....give this one a shot.

This Recipe was excellent.  I took the advice of others and only put 1/4 cup of brown sugar.  I also add 1/4 cup of O.J. and a 1/4 of cup of cranberry juice.  My family loved it! It is definitely worth making again.  I also made sweet potatoes and long grain rice with this meal.

Wonderful! I also went easy on the cloves and used cran-apple juice. I also added rosemary and it was wonderful. Can't wait to try this recipe using turkey breast.

I was rather surprized and disappointed with this recipe.  I read the other reviews before making this roast and thought that it would be good.  Not one person in my home liked this roast.  Sorry.

This was so good!  I didn't have cloves, so I just added a dash of cinnamon plus I used water instead of cranberry juice, but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and it was very tasty.  My house smelled great while it was cooking - a neighbor stopped by and had me give her the recipe based on smell alone!  The pork was very moist and just fell apart.  I served this with mashed potatoes (the cranberry gravy was great on them) and applesauce.  What a great meal!  The leftovers were yummy the next day, too.  I'll definitely make this again!

Oh my, this was sooooo YUMMY!!  Anyone who rated this recipe with under 5 stars must have done something wrong.  I've made this twice since I discovered the recipe a month ago.  My fiance and I love it.  The pork is so moist and just falls apart in the scrumptious gravy.  This is the perfect main course for a dinner party....especially when you want to spend more time with your guests than you want to spend in the kitchen.  I have made it once for company already and it was a hit.  Both times I made this, I used orange juice and brown sugar as substitutes.  AWESOME RECIPE!!!!!!!!!!!!

This was wonderful!  I didn't have cranberry juice, so I substituted apple juice.  I also used whole berry cranberry sauce and brown sugar instead of white.  Also the pork was so tender I was able to pull it, rather than slice it.  I served it the first night with mashed potatoes and the next night with barbeque sauce on rolls.  The entire family loved it, both ways!  I'll make this one again!

I SERVED THIS RECIPE FOR VALENTINE'S DAY DINNER TO A GROUP OF FRIENDS. THE MEAT WAS SO TENDER! THERE WASN'T ENOUGH!!!  EVERYONE LOVED IT.  NOW ANOTHER FRIEND IS REQUESTING THE RECIPE.  I INTEND TO SERVE THIS DURING THE UPCOMING CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS. I ALSO MADE SOME CHANGES BASED ON OTHER'S REVIEWS. SORRY, BUT I DON'T MEASURE ANY INGREDIENTS IN ANY RECIPE SO I CAN'T BE SPECIFIC.  I REDUCED THE CLOVES AND SUGAR, USED CRANAPPLE JUICE AND WHOLE CRANBERRY SAUCE.  OVERALL THIS IS A WONDERFUL RECIPE AND SOOO EASY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I cooked the pork roast for 8 hours in my crockpot and found that it was very dry. I will definitely check it at 6 hours next time. Overall, the flavors were wonderful and the delicious gravy helped hide the dry roast. I will definitely make this again.

Great recipe! My slow cooker must be pretty hot because my roast was done a few hours sooner and it was larger than the one stated in the recipe.

Everyone LOVED this!!!!  *Yum*  I didn't have Cranberry juice, so I used apple juice.  I used whole berry jellied cranberry sauce,  Also, I had read that the sugar amount was too much, so I decreased that.  Great dinner & easy!!!!

This is a great EASY recipe!  I also used the whole cranberry sauce in a can and cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup.  I didn't have cranberry juice so I used cran-grape juice.  I steamed baby red potatoes as a side.  I was a little leary aobut using the gravy on the potatoes but it was delicious.  What a nice twist on things.  A+++

My roast came out dry, but the flavor was wonderful.  Next time I make this I will look for a roast that is more marbled.

I made this last night and it was a big hit!!! I did not add the sugar because others said it had been too sweet.  The gravy was marvelous and I served it with mashed potatoes and fresh brocolli and a green salad.  Meat was very very tender.  It cooked all day in my crock pot and was ready when I got home that night.  Thanks for a grrrreat
recipe!!!!!

This was a wonderful sauce in which to "cook" the pork, very tender and tasty. However, we did not care for the liquid used as a gravy, way to sweet for that. I will make this again, just as a marinade though.

Talk about mouth watering and toe curling!!! This dish was so simple to make and tasted ohh so good! Especially with a side of mashed pataters! 
I recommend this to anyone. So moist and sweet, but not too too sweet. Perfect.....!!! It's offically a favorite of mine!!

Made dinner for my wife on her birthday, she loved it. Our 5 year old wanted seconds....wow. I seldom cook but once I found my way around the kitchen it was very easy. Here you go guys when you need to get out of the dog house, some long grain and wild rice...a little wine, put the 5 year old to bed early and who knows!!!!

Well, I wasn't sure about this recipe until I tried it. I was pleasantly suprised how this turned out.  I cut back on the suger as suggested by others.  The pork was tender and the gravy was a nice suprise.  Two out of three of my children liked it.  I will make this again.  Enjoy!

I enjoyed this recipe and it was very simple.  I read the reviews before making and use apple juice instead of cranberry and 1/4 c. sugar.  We enjoyed it.

This was great...a definite change and my husband loved it.  I will definitely cook it again.  The only changes that I made to the recipe was to use only 1/4 cup sugar and I did not go through the steps at the end to make a thick sauce or gravy...The juices made were great just as they were over the meat.

After reading other reviews, I used half the called for sugar.  It was superb.  My three kids and husband all had seconds!  Slow cooked in oveen at 275 for 3-4 hours rather than slow cooker.

Made this for Christmas 2001 and everyone loved it.  Gravy was excellent too.  Since I don't generally use cranberry juice, I substituted the cranberry juice with apple juice and used SPLENDA instead of regular sugar in order to help make this a "lighter" dish.  It came out great!  Will definitely make it again.

I made this for Sunday dinner, it was extremely easy, virtually no prep. There was not a morsel left, it was excellent.
