These were very good... VERY sweet! Almost too sweet (and I have a definite sweet tooth!). Maybe it's good they are so sweet though because you really only need a small piece to satisfy your sweet tooth.  The only thing I changed was that I melted some semi-sweet chocolate chips with a little bit of milk in the microwave in place of the other chocolate topping.

These bars are to die for! The only thing I did differently was to sprinkle chocolate chips and pecans over the slightly cooled toffee instead of melting chocolate in a double boiler as instructed in the recipe. I'll definitely make this again.
