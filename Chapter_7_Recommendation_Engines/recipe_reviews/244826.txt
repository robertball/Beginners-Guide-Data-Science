I loved this recipe! Instead of coconut water I put in regular water and it was pretty good! Next time, I would also put in ice cubes, as it got a little warm after awhile. Also, I didn't have kiwi or pineapple, but I put bananas and blueberries and strawberries in for a nice flavor. I am also allergic to nuts, so opted out on those. Will make again! Relaxing and filling!

I used this recipe for the acai base and altered the topping to my taste and what I had on hand. This was my second attempt making a acai bowl and this will now be to go-to recipe! My first attempt went wrong after I put something together based on photos and was way off. This recipe makes a decent amount and is very filling.
