Awesome! If you like French onion Soup then you will LOVE this recipe! I do mine a weee bit different, I buy the biggest vidillia onion & cut the "core" on top out. Squirt butter in the hole, a splash of worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, salt & pepper.. Wrap tightly in foil & grill 30-45 minutes. A MUST if you are camping on the grill! Enjoy, Also good with sprinkling some parmesan cheese on top. All kinds of things you can add!

I've made these for years, I leave skin on ,make cuts almost to root sprinkle with parm chesse. Skins keep onion from burning when buired in coals and peel right off when cooked. Try different herbs over them  also

This recipe is very much like the one called 'Grilled Onions' on this site - they are both wonderful! I usually make them when I'm cooking corn on the grill. I always cut out a little notch of onion from the top, and insert a beef bouillon cube. This, combined with the butter, gives it an almost French Onion soup flavor. We love it! Thanks so much for reminding me of a superb recipe!

This is an awesome recipe!  I've made it while camping and at home in the oven.  The recipe is great as-is, but even better if you add a beef boullion cube in the center along with a few drops of worcestershire.  It tastes like french onion soup!  Great served with steak.

We think these are great and make them just about everytime we cook out. I use spray butter to cut the calories and also throw in a heaping teaspoon of minced garlic.

These was very good and I plan to make them again and again. They were very decadent, and the flavor was just perfect (although they needed additional salt at the table in spite of what I thought was plenty before cooking).

I made them at home in the oven, using a glass baking dish. I set the oven higher, to 450 degrees, and left the baking time the same. I also added a little olive oil before the butter.

Often I've searched so hard for something different to serve as a vegetable, and I've always overlooked the simple onion! Thank you, Riverview5950, for sharing this recipe! :-)

This is very good to make when camping. It doesn't get soggy but is tender. I will definately use this in my campfire cooking lineup again and again. BTW it is so easy to make.

I love to cook over the campfire at our family place in the PA mountains and I am always looking for a new idea. This site has lots of good campfire goodies. I made the onion to put ontop of burgers and it was really good. It takes much longer over the fire than on a grill with a lid. I used beef bullion powder , worchestershire and butter. Its a good make ahead item. I made it in the morning and kept cold till it was time for dinner cooking. I will make this again.

This is a great side dish to make on the grill to go with a good steak. Make sure to put it on the heat about 10-15 minutes before you put your steak on. We usually add a good splash of balsamic vinegar to add some flavor and dust with parmesan cheese when done. Sliced portobello mushrooms are awesome using this method.

Although I didn't make this exact recipe, it did inspire the one I made.  I followed this recipe but added potato chunks as well as the onion to each packet.  Since I didn't have garlic pepper, I used garlic salt.  I baked them in the oven on 375 for about 50 minutes.

I use less butter and 1/2 of a Knorr Boullion cube. I core out a bit of the middle and use 1/2 to 1 pat of butter and half the cube and it really tastes delicious. My oldest son prefers vegetables so when we camped out with the Boy Scouts this is one of the things he would get.

We made these while camping and even a non onion lover loved them!  I did like others said and added some sprinkled vegtable boullion to each onion and they ended up flavorful and yummy.  I used very large, sweet onions and because they were so big we had to cook them somewhat longer but they were well worth the wait!  Thank you for a wonderful recipe that will now be a part of our camping menus all the time.

This is similar to our recipe except after peeling the onion, scoop out a little onion on top and place a beef buillion cube in the scooped out area, top with a pat of butter and twist with foil.  Verry good.

Cooked last night in oven, placed a bit of powdered beef stock in top of slit then sat dob of butter on top (instead of melting)then wrapped up to cook.
Ate with a baked potato covered with savoury mince, bloody beauty : )
The other half didn't like very much ; )

This recipe is a whole lot better if you place a chicken or beef cube in the middle of the onion before you wrap in foil.  
Still a good recipe.

A good recipe that is easy and fun and yummy. I agree with a previous reviewer to reference as to cutting out a notch in the onion and adding a beef bouillion cube. Thanks.

The onion was great but it took about 35 minuates to cook.
