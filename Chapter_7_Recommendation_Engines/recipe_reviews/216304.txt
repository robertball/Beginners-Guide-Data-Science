This was very good.  I used about a tablespoon of chipotle tabasco sauce instead of the dried chipotle powder, but other than that followed the recipe exactly.  Served with southwest hashbrowns, which worked well.

This was quick and easy and so delicious. The next time I make it I'll put it over rice. I used canned chipotle in adobo sauce, 1 pepper and 1 tablespoon of adobo. I also added a half can of water. I will def make this again!

did not taste good to me or my family.  Didn't have enough flavor.  We ended up throwing the rest of it out.
