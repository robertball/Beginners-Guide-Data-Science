This soup is really really good.  I followed the recipe according to what was in my pantry.  I didn't have any carrots and used fresh onions.  I used a bag of mixed beans.  I didn't have ham hocks, but I had the bony part of a spiral cut semi-boneless ham in the freezer.  When I put the beans on to boil, I went ahead and put the ham bones in the crockpot with water on low.  After the beans boiled and cooled, I added them to the crockpot with onions and celery.  Then, I put it in the fridge overnight.  Next morning, it was easy to skim the fat before I turned on the crockpot.  After I got home from work, I pulled out the bones and chopped the meat.  It smelled and tasted out of this world.  Three of us ate over half of it, I can't wait for leftovers.

Too bland for me. I added 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper, thyme and garlic and then a medium sized can of tomato paste---- delicious.  Also precook the ham hocks 1 hr before adding to get tender enough.

This soup was delicious.  I only had three kinds of beans and used a ham bone.  Since I was making it immediately I used a real onion and skipped the cumin.  It was very good and I am anxious to make it again.

This recipe is really nice as a gift and requires only a few "fresh" ingrediants later.  The flavor is super too!

I can never find yellow split peas so I substitute the green.  I also substitute other beans I may have on hand, such as black or navy beans.  I keep a large container of the mix in my pantry to toss in the crockpot.  This recipe is so good and easy, you can't go wrong!

Cut the time in less than half by using a meat-grinder or food processor to crack all the beans!

I changed this recipe to fit into the large crockpot that I have.  I used 1 cup of all the beans and peas.  I used 2  chicken bouillon cubes, and used 1 tea. of celery seeds.  I used turkey ham, and 1/4 cup of dehydrated carrots.  I added to this recipe 1/2 tea. dried thyme, 3/4 tea. garlic powder, and 1/4 tea. cumin.  Then I just let the crock pot do it's thing!  My husband said that this was great and to make it again soon, and he is not a soup person at all.  I have put all the beans and peas together, and want to jar some of this up to give as a gift.  I will just have to add the turkey ham, and the seasonings.  That's why I tried it with all the dry ingredients to see if it would work out, and sure enough it did.  Just love this soup!!!!

I used 10 Bean bulk from Sprouts.  Yummy!  I put it in the crockpot and let it cook all day.  I didn't put the carrots and celery in until about 6 hours til the end (after it was cooking for 4 hours).

This is a super easy recipe and very tasty.  I used Kielbasa instead of ham and chopped up a medium onion instead of using the dried onion.  I chopped up my carrots, celery, and onion while the beans soaked after the first boil, so this took no time at all.  I also put the beans and peas from the bags into containers with the spices in snack baggies, so it is ready to go for next time.  This was enjoyed by the whole family.  They are already asking me to make it again.

This was good. Very easy to make....I did it in the slowcooker. I did add extra garlic and onion for flavor.

I've made this three times now and it is always a hit.  I do add tomato paste and use a whole onion minced instead of dried minced onion.

I made up four jars of this during the holidays and gave one as a gift.  Don't know if the recipient has made the soup yet and, if so, what she thought.  I made it yesterday (1/20/19).  If I was rating it on how easy it is to make, I would give it five stars.  I deviated slightly from the recipe--I am vegetarian so didn't add the ham hocks; my celery was going bad so I didn't use it; and, I added about half an eight ounce carton of fresh mushrooms.  I cooked it for the additional two hours as written in the recipe.  However, without ham hocks, I think an additional hour would have been sufficient.  The taste was bland.  I doubt if the celery would have added anything to the flavor as celery doesn't have much taste.  Perhaps the ham hocks would have made it less bland.  I still have two jars left so may incorporate some of the changes others have made and see if those make this any more palatable.  If not, I won't be making this recipe again.

This was a super easy, super flavorful dish.  I will definitely make this again. I used a dried 15 bean combination instead of the beans listed separately.  The ham hocks were fall apart tender and added a wallop of meaty goodness.

Great recipe! The only change I made was to add a half cup of barbecue sauce. Making it again right now.

I used a premixed bulk 10 bean soup mix of only the beans.  I used a half inch ham slice which was really good for the amount of ham, but it the soup was too salty for me and I only used the ham for salt seasoning.  Other than that, it was really good.  I will make it again but will do something else about the ham.

Really good!Per some other reviews, I added Thyme, Cheyenne Pepper, and Marjoram. I wanted something a little different, so I used 4 beef bouillon cubes; I had lentils, pinto, and green split peas on hand so that is what I used. Will definitely make again- so many possibilities!

Good, but next time use less ham & use vegetable broth instead of water, or combined with some water. Too salty.

I was looking for a quick, tasty and hearty soup for a cold winters day. This is it. I find it. It is very easy to prepare and yummy. I added rice to my mixture and it came out fantastic.
