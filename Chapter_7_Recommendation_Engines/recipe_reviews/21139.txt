This is delicious!  My family always eats Johnny Cake sprinkled with a little sugar (or Splenda) and soaked in milk.  Yes, you need to put it in a bowl first!

Super simple, yet the orange zest adds a nice flavorful touch.

It was VERY easy to make, and it ended up tasting exactly like I thought it would...orange cornbread.  Typically, johnny cake is cooked as a pancake, but I was OK with baking and cutting it into squares.  I cut back on the milk a little and added some orange juice, but even with the orange zest, I would have liked more orange flavor.  This was OK, served it with butter and maple syrup for breakfast, but not sure I like it well enough to make  again.
