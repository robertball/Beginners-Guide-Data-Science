I used to make this cake often and everyone loved it.  I don't think they make the packaged icing anymore, though.  If the person who put this on or anyone else knows if they still make it, please write a review giving me that information.  Or tell me what you use instead of it.

I made this recently for my nephew's special birthday.  My mother used to make the mix when he was very  young, he loved it.  Well, this did not turn out very well...no "tunnel" at all.  However, was it because I did not fold in walnuts, instead mixed them in with mixer?  Also, my new bundt pan is brown; manufacturer did not mention anything about lowering oven temperature; I believe I should have.  This cake was so heavy, and turned out on the dry side, like a big brownie.  I've looked at other versions, want to try Tunnel of Fudge Cake IV next time, and will lower oven temperature by 25 degrees.  Just disappointed.
