My only change would be to use fideo pasta which can be found in Walmart or in the Spanish food section. It is simply angel hair pasta that has been cut to 1 1/2 inches. I will be making this Ricw-Ahhhhh-Roni over and over again. Thank you Chef John.

I did not care for this recipe. I cooked this exactly as written and it was still real crunchy after 17 minutes. In fact, I had to cook it probably about an hour! So then I had to keep adding more chicken broth to it because it was drying up, so the spices were getting more and more diluted.

I can't remember how the original R-A-R tasted (have lived abroad for many years). However, this recipe turned out wonderfully for me and my family. I followed the recipe faithfully, except for using 4 cups of broth instead of 3, and, having no fresh parsley, using dried (a poor substitute). Mine turned out perfectly cooked using the exact timing specified. Served with another Chef John recipe for spicy chicken thighs.

I was so happy to make this recipe!   I loved Rice-A-Roni as a kid but don’t make it often because it’s not good for you    This recipe was easy and I had everything on hand will definitely be making it again

Very good.  Nice departure from regular boring rice or the preservative filled Rice A Roni.  Didn't have mustard powder still delicious.  Will add to rotation and add celery and or leeks to make more fancy.  If you make as directed and a good quality chicken broth - there is no way that this would not be a winner.

I made this last night to pair with Chef John's Sticky Garlic Pork Chops. The whole meal was delicious! I took the suggestion of another reviewer and added chopped red bell pepper with the onion and added a few handfuls of spinach with the water (I used chicken stock). I always try to get some "extra" veggies in where I can! I couldn't find orzo, but did use fideo noodles (vermicelli), it worked perfectly. Spices were "spot on". Thanks for a great recipe!!

Great side dish. I used rice and orzo.  Easy to make and it helps me  avoid food additives.

I love this recipe! It's delicious just like it is and it's also versatile - you can adjust it to match anything that you are serving with it. Tonight we were having Italian chicken, so I added some minced, dried spinach and finely diced red and green peppers.  Everyone always enjoys it!  Thanks, Chef John!  ?

I love this recipe! I make in a double batch and freeze servings to just thaw as needed, so nice to have ready to go. The only thing I have changed now after making a couple of times is to cut back on the cayenne since I prefer to not have the little heat in the background.  Just use 1/8 tsp for my double batch and just right for us.  I have also lately been adding some grated carrot, a nice veggie/cA definite winner!!!

This came out so good! I followed the instructions exactly and it was perfectly flavored and textured. my picky 6-year-old who angrily told me he "hates" rice when I told him what I was making asked for more after his required first bite. Will make again!

If you have ever had the original, this tastes exactly like that. It was wonderful and easy to make. I will make this a weekly staple. Thanks Chef John for sharing this creation.

This came out well, very simple to do. Just be careful on the heat setting. I have a ceramic cooktop that  can get a little hot a "medium-high" so I may have toasted the orzo a little more than  specified but it tasted great. Makes a great quick side with store-bought turkey breast and vegetables. Going to try the leftovers with chicken and tomatoes and avocados.

I made this dish just as the recipe called for and it was excellent. Just a little heat from the cayenne and overall a very tasty dish. Great for a main dish with a salad for a light lunch or dinner, or a side for a larger meal.
I wouldn't change a thing.

Didn't have all the ingredients on hand, was short the orzo, tumeric, mustard powder, and cayenne.  Still turned out really nicely, exactly what I was looking for.

Made as recipe calls for. Turned out great. Personally I would drop the cayenne pepper and add some mushrooms to it next time. Maybe some bell pepper too. Makes a lot.

Good rice but I needed another cup and a half of liquid to finish the rice.
