Great tasting.  I do recomment one thing. To make a sugar syrup, also known as "simple syrup". Dissolving the sugar in hot water effectively disperses the sugar in the lemonade, instead of having the sugar sink to the bottom.  To make simple syrup by heating the sugar and water in a small saucepan until the sugar is dissolved completely.  Use the same amount of water as per sugar.  Then in pitcher add your juice and then the sugar water. Then add the rest of the water that is called for.

I used Truvia instead of sugar. I made no other changes. GREAT recipe to make with younger cooks--my son enjoyed juicing each lemon. NOTE: For those looking for an easier way to juice lemons, Grandma taught me to roll them on the counter while gently pushing down with the palm of your hand to get the juices flowing.

I added 2/3 c sugar which was the perfect amount of sweetness for me.

Amazing.  I used half lemons, half limes, which was tasted great.  Then because my kids were asking for pink lemonade I threw in 4 frozen strawberries and whizzed it all in the blender - even better.

Mmmm!  A bit more tart than "Best Lemonade Ever" (which was pretty sweet), but I thought it was perfect as is.

Can it get any easier than this?  I wanted to try making my own lemonade and this recipe was great.  Fresh-squeezed lemons make the best tasting lemonade.  However, the recipe here only calls for 1 quart and that is only 1/2 my pitcher so I still used the 4 lemons, but 1 cup of sugar and 2 quarts water.  It still came out great.

all lemons are different size it would help if you could say the mesurement in cups anyways brown sugar works better than white but you might have to experiment on the mesurements

I made this at a friend's house, except I substituted the water for Club Soda (a type of sparkling water) and doubled the recipe, so it was /really/ fizzy lemonade! It was cold and the lemon to Club Soda ratio was perfect, and not too sour. However, we did have to get a large spoon and scrape the bottom of the pitcher because the sugar sank to the very bottom in an obnoxious little clump. Due to this issue, I would recommend getting a pot or a small saucepan, and bringing the 1/2 cup of sugar and 1/2 cup of water to a boil to create a simple syrup. Then you can wait for it to cool, pour it in and add the rest of the water (or Club Soda!) and thus avoid the sugar problem. Thanks SOOO much for this recipe, definitely a keeper! Making some again soon! Beats any store-bought lemonade recipe hands down. ~Bae :D

This is as simple as it gets.  I read several reviews, and the idea of making a simple syrup is ridiculous.  The sugar dissolve just fine in the water and with the lemon juice.  Because lemons vary so much in size, just taste the darn thing to see if it needs more tang or more sweetness.  I always add lemon zest too.  This brings out the flavor of the lemon without having to cut into more fresh lemons.  Also, it's fine to add lemon juice that isn't freshly squeezed if you think it needs more.  We really enjoyed this, very refreshing and super simple.

Mmmmmm. Good. I did double this recipe and it was going fast! I stirred the sugar in about 2 cups or so of water and put it in the nuker for a couple minutes and stirred it up good until the sugar  completely dissolved.

Great easy recipe.  My 4 year old just came in the room asking if we had some lemonade.  We do not but I made him some from this recipe.  Since we only had one lemon on hand I made one serving which is more like two or three for him.  I added  a little extra water and about a tsp more sugar.  The 3/4 lemon that I used was huge and had a ton of juice so maybe that was why it was so tart.  Even after the extra water and sugar it was still quite tart but that's how we like it.  My 4 year old likes to suck on plain lemon slices so he didn't seem to mind.  Thanks for the recipe.

I just made a batch of this. I used Meyer lemons and measured the juice. I used 1 cup of lemon juice along with the water and sugar stated in the recipe. It turned out very well. Hope this will be helpful to others.

This recipe is perfect. I had another, which involved slicing the lemon then pounding the slices to release juices, then pouring in water. I could never figure out at what point to remove the slices because the peels would cause the lemonade to get a funny taste. Juicing the lemons first is a better option, and you can add more or less sugar depending on your taste. When I pour the lemon juice in, I pour it through a strainer to remove seeds and pulp. Simple and perfect! Just how I want lemonade to taste.

I followed the top review to make a simple syrup and that worked out well.  I do think I could've added another lemon, but I guess it all depends how juicy the lemons you have are.  Don't water this down with ice!  Freeze some lemonade into cubes or just pass on ice.  Thanks for the recipe, it was nice to make lemonade with my husband and then enjoy it's fresh-squeezed taste together!

For this recipe I used 5 large size lemons, and added a 2/3's cup of sugar.  I served mine in a chilled glass, as I didn't add any ice.  Adding ice quickly dilutes the taste of the lemon flavor. With the modifications I made to this beverage, I would give this recipe 5 stars. This is a good basic recipe to start with, but with everyone's taste preference when it comes to lemonade, (sweet lemonade verses a tart lemonade) I think one should add ingredients that suits their taste buds.

fantastic recipe! not usually a fan of lemonade but my wife has had a hankering for it and i drank 2quarts of this stuff before she even came home! 

I didnt have fresh lemons so i used lemon juice. In case anyone needs to know;

4 lemons = between 9 and 12 tablespoons of juice.

I used the recommended amount of lemon juice, and doubled all the other ingredients to make 2 quarts of lemonade. 

PS. A previous reviewer mentioned making the sugar into a syrup. Excellent suggestion. Makes for a much smoother drink.

I was looking for a simple but great recipe for lemonade-this was it! As recommended, I made a sugar syrup by boiling the sugar with an equal amount of water so that the sugar would be dissolved. I ended up adding about 1/8 c more sugar, and it was perfect! Also I didn't have lemons so i used lemon juice, which made it quicker. Will definitely use this over the summer!!

I have to admit that I've never made home made lemonade. YUM!  I made a simple syrup w/ equal parts sugar and water warmed on the stove top til sugar was dissolved.  Next time I think i will use more sugar, but that is just a matter of personal taste.

Rave reviews. I dissolved the sugar in a little boiling water first, then added it to the total amount of water. As another reviewer said, just taste it and adjust to your liking! It's not brain surgery. I also made ice cubes from the lemonade the day before, and added them so it wouldn't get watered down. *UPDATE* We had some left over and tasted it the next day; it's true, the sliced lemons make it very strong, almost bitter. If you garnish with pretty lemon slices, be sure to add them just before serving, and remove them if you have leftovers.

Simple recipe, great results.  I made a simple syrup with the sugar as suggested by someone else before mixing it with the rest of the water and lemon juice.  It's delicious!

Easy. Fast. It was weak with only 4 lemons so I added another and when my husband tasted it he said it needed more lemon and it was weak, so I ended up adding a 6th lemon. And I was using large lemons too. I strained this through some cheesecloth before serving. Thanks, this is the first time I ever made real lemonade that wasn't from a can of concentrate.

I juiced 4 lemons and it was 1 cup of juice. Added water to make 2 quarts and sweetened with honey instead of sugar. I'm not sure how much I put in though. Just added a little at a time till it tasted good. The kids and I love it this way! 

I tend to like things a little more watered down than most though. So the 1 quart was just to strong for me. Besides, it makes the lemons go a lot further this way!

Very nice taste. Not overly sweet. I used 2 quarts of water and 3/4c of lemon and 3/4c lime juice and a little less than 1c sugar. Very tasty and will defiantly make again. Will try with just lemons when I have enough to make 2 quarts.

Tasty & refreshing! I was happy with the outcome, except for the fact that I didn't make enough! I ended up squeezing (fully) 5-6 lemons. And to add an intresting twist to it, I put some vanilla. It was divine!

Super easy and a huge hit for the kids' lemonade stand - we went through four batches!  I bumped the sugar up to 2/3 cup because I knew most of the neighborhood kids would want a sweeter lemonade, but will try going with just a half cup next time to up the tart factor.

I used 10 lemons, about a gallon and a half of water and ice, and enough Splenda to keep the tartness but add some sweet.  Just what we needed on a 90-degree day!

Great basic recipe.  Added a little sugar, but it could easily do without the addition.  I used smaller lemons, not the huge ones, and I squeezed them over the sugar, let that dissolve, stirred it, then added water and stirred again.  Sugar dissolved very quickly and easily.

WOW!  Fantastic!  I don't think I can ever drink the fake stuff again.  And when a bag of lemons is on sale for $2 at the end of summer, its cheaper than buying it already made.

Doubled the recipe. Turn out fantastic! However, I had to add about 1/2 cup of sugar extra simply because it was bit tart for my tastebuds. Other than that, great!

It was bland and didn't show much character. You couldn't tell if it was sweet or sour which made me not like it as much as i thought i would. I would make it again and just not add as much water or sugar

This was PERFECT lemonade.  The only problem was that I didn't make enough of it.  It went fast at my son's birthday party.  I will definitely be making this again.

We tried this recipe and it's a keeper.  I used 1/4 cup of Splenda and 1/4 cup of sugar instead of the 1/2 cup of sugar and it rawks.  The kids love it.  Thanks.

I used 5 small lemons which came to 2/3 cup of lemon juice.  I also used warm water to help the sugar dissolve quicker.

great stuff! I substituted 8oz of "realemon" rather than 4 lemons per some internet directions. A tart, refreshing summer drink.

I just made for the second time and I think this is a great recipe and it's easy to tweak it to your personal taste and preference. I do follow the advice of another reviewer and make the simple syrup first. I have made it with half the sugar amount and liked it but hubby thought it was too tart. This time I used the full sugar called for but added a little more water so it wouldn't be too sweet. I also divided some of it and added frozen raspberries to see how it would taste...it's turning into a lovely pink lemonade!

This recipe for lemonade is delicious! I only had 3 lemons so I only used 3 cups.  I used 1/4 cup of sugar because I did not want to make it too sweet. It turned out awesome! You should really make this.

Wonderful summer lemonade recipe!  I fallowed what other reviewers said and made a simple syrup first with the water and sugar, bringing it to a boil and cooling before mixing it all together. My lemons were slightly small, so I adjusted the juice accordingly. Not to sour, not to sweet! Perfect! A thirst quencher!

We loved this recipe! Easily divided into four parts for adding quantity (1 lemon, 2C water (1 pint), 1/8C sugar). I had a 2-qt container, so I added 2 more parts. Was a hit with DH!

If you like chili with a kick to it, follow the recipe as told. If not cut the chili powder in half and use just one jalapeño. Also extremely easy to use ground beef. I used about 2 pounds of ground beef and turned out great.

Has good sugar to lemon to water ratio.  If you do not like things too sugary, this does pretty good.

We made this as written except followed the suggestion of one reviewer by melting the sugar in some water over low heat. Perfect! Tangy lemon flavor with mild not overpowering sweetness. Was gone quickly at our cookout!

3.6.18  What a treat this was after a day of yard work.  We don’t really care for much of anything too sweet these days, so I did cut the amount of sugar back to 1/3 cup and then substituted  Truvia® to sweeten the lemonade.  It was perfect!

This was a fantastic recipe!  The entire family enjoyed drinking this lemonade.  I am so glad that I made extra servings.  This drink will certainly be in the family rotation of meals throughout the year.  Thank you for your submission.

We made this and I liked it just the way it stated to make it. It was great! -but had some fruit salad on hand, So I drained the juice at the bottom of the fruit salad and added some raspberries.  It was sublime!

I doubled the recipe, and I used a bit more sugar, because it was still pretty sour after adding a cup of sugar.  Not the best lemonade i have had, but it was still pretty good.

Good.  Next time I think I will try to make it more special by infusing mint into the simple syrup.  I was also pleased with my juicing strategy - peeled each lemon and dropped it in the juicer.  Painless, maximized juice from each lemon, and easy to clean up.

Really good flavor! Used five small lemons that were from a bag and that was plenty. Also used stevia in place of sugar and my four and five year olds loved it.

The recipe was right on. I wanted to tell you how I made a large quantity of lemonade from a lot of surplus  lemons.  I juiced two bags of lemons and got 10 cups of juice. To make 2 quarts of lemonade, I used 2 cups of lemon juice and 1 cup of sugar. I brought the sugar and a half a cup of water to a boil then I poured it into a 4 cup freezer container and added a few ice cubes. When it was cool, I added 2 cups of lemon juice. I was able to make a total of five containers of lemon juice for the freezer. Now when I want to make lemonade, I simply defrost one container, pour it into a 2 quart pitcher and add cold water to fill up the pitcher.

Simple and delicious. 4 lemons ended up as 1 cup lemon juice for me. Works best over ice as it's strong. Or add an extra cup of water (total 5 cups water).

Delicious! It doesn't get much simpler than this. I took the advice of another reviewer (Kristy) and created a simple syrup with the sugar and water before combining the rest of the ingredients. Another store-bought item off the grocery list!

Tasted amazing! My whole family loved it! Just add 2/3 cup sugar instead.
