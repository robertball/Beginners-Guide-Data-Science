This is a great base chili recipe. Just a few added ingredients to customize it to my families tastes is all it took.  The creator has not pretended it to be the best only that she invented it by accident and it turned out pretty good. She even says that it's not for those who may like a spicey or sweet chili. Thanks for sharing it!

Bland but I knew it would be. I made as is but had to jazz mine up in the end. It is however exactly as advertised and I refuse to give it a bad rating. Plus, I like the recipe title..hee hee. Great for kids I would think.

I made this but it taste like bean soup instead of Chili. I had to add chilli seasoning to give it a chilli taste. I will stick to my own recipe the way my mama taught me how here in Texas.

Good for accidental chili. I found it a little soupy. I like my chili a little more chunky. I added another can of kidney beans, but it was still a little soupy. I followed recipe to a T, I will definately make this again with a little adjustments to it. Thanks

To make it less soupy. mash up a small portion of the beans and stir them in.  Works great as a thickener.  I also add 1 tsp or so dijon mustard -- gives it more depth but you can avoid the "spiciness" you would get with cumin, chili powder, etc.

This is just a bean/beef soup.  No chili powder, cumin, oregano, cayenne or any of the things that make chili chili.  It's not bad, but it's bland.  If you want real chili, find a good recipe or get a package of 2 Alarm Chili Mix at your local store.
