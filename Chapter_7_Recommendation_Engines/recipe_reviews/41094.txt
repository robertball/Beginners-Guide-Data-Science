This recipe was really good.  I didn't have some of the ingredients on hand so I improvised a little bit and my family loved it!  My three year old who is ultra picky ate it up and asked for seconds!  I am going to make another batch and freeze it so I can just take it out and heat it up.  Prep and cook time was very managable for a quick meal.  Less than an hour and a half total.  Try italian pork sausage instead of ground beef for a zestier taste.

Good recipe, will definately use again. I made a few minor changes to the recipe. I made the meat mixture half ground beef and half Italian sausage. I used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese and added a box of frozen spinich, squeezed dry. Also a little Italian seasonings.

I made many changes to this per the other reviewers. My whole family loved this. I made my mother-in-law's sauce. I mixed grnd beef and mild italian sausage. I added extra garlic - yum. I added spag sauce and about 3 tbsp of ricotta cheese to the meat/sausage mixture. I threw a couple of tsp of italian seasonings onto the meat mix as well. With all those changes I would give it 5 stars!

Pretty good...It needed something, maybe a little salt. I think next time I will mix some tomato sauce into the flling or maybe some Ricotta cheese.I would add a little seasoning to the sauce also.

This is a winner in our house! My modification was using 1/2 Italian sausage and sneaking in some veggies. I finely grated one carrot cooking it in with the meat and 1/2 box of thawed chopped spinach added to the meat mixture before stuffing the noodles.

The basic structure of the recipe was good, but I made a few changes as it went along.  I used about a pound of ground beef because I had more shells and cooked that with onion.  I skipped the bread crumbs, but mixed in a can of drained diced tomatoes with the beef, egg, and cheese, and then simply poured the tomato sauce on top of the casserole and added cheese.  It was a huge hit, and definitely a recipe I'll keep in mind for when family comes over because you can make a large amount and it's actually rather easy to make!  Great as leftovers!

Easy recipe, another great way to use hamburger. I used 3/4lb of beef and just barely had enough filling for all the pasta. I subbed a can of tomato puree for the tomatoes I didn't have and used a Texas white wine. Nice flavor to the sauce, great budget meal too as it requires few ingredients. The bread crumbs made the filling a bit mealy and odd textured, it didn't hold together at all even after standing 10 min after coming out of the oven. We didn't like it enough to make our favorites list, but it was a nice meal. Thanks!

This is a good recipe.  I never considered stuffing manicotti with beef, but I'm glad I tried. I didn't use the sauce in the recipe (used another favorite) just the meat mixture.  Even my kids (4 & 5) liked them.

Great recipe! I too used spaghetti sauce and also large pasta shells instead of Manicotti. I wouldn't have thought of stuffing beef and into them though, and it was sooo good! Good alternative to just straight cheese. Looked fabulous too.

This recipe is GREAT! Who cares what you call it! Manicotti, canelloni...just call it DELICIOUS! The only thing I changed was using jarred sauce instead of making my own.  VERY GOOD RECIPE!

This recipe was delicious! I did improvise just a little though. Such as: instead  of the white Zinfandel and tomato sauce, I used just plain ol' spaghetti sauce, and instead of buying the manicotti shells, I made my own (because I always say homeade is better). I think I used a crepe recipe for the shells/noodles, and believe me that's WAY better than the storebought stuff.

Very yummy and cheesy. Stuffing the shells with sausage and ground beef made it so meaty and yummy and I threw a lot of cheese into it also and everyone in my house loved it! Even the picky 5yr old!

This turned out pretty well.  I decided that I really wanted ricotta in it so I used less shredded cheese and added about a cup of ricotta to the filling.  I also took others advice and didn't cook the shells before hand.  They cooked just fine in the baking process, and it was pretty easy to fill them.  I'm keeping this one.

This was pretty good. I only cooked the shells for 5 minutes to make them easier to stuff. I also used italian bread crumbs. I did not add the wine but still enjoyed the recipe.

I'm sure this is a wonderful recipe.  However, when a meat filling is used the name switches from manicotti to Canneloni.  Mangia!

I did make a couple of changes.....I used jar tomatoe sauce (also added a a few tablespoons to the meat.)  I didn't have manicotti shells, so I made my own crepes.  Well, the crepes taste better with the cheese filling.  THe meat filling needs a heartier shell.  I meat mixture seemed kind of tasteless....I would add more salt and maybe add some ground sausage to extra kick!!   I would make again, but using packaged shells and some sausage mixed into the mixture!

We really enjoyed this one! We used regular tomatoe sauce since we're not mushroom lovers, used extra ground beef to put on top of noodles and under tomatoe sauce and cheese. Adding some mild italian sausage makes it absolutely tasty! We loved it!

Wish I'd read the reviews beforehand! I used ground turkey instead, and it was good. I liked the filling a lot, but as far as the sauce goes, I should have just bought a jar of spaghetti sauce. It would have been much more interesting. Filling the manacotti shells was sort of a pain, but that's my own fault, not the recipe's! I left out the mushrooms and used chardonnay instead of zinfandel. Next time I might just make up the turkey mixture and stir it into cooked penne noodles, top it with spaghetti sauce and cheese and bake it that way!

This was pretty good. I didn't make the tomato sauce from this recipe though. I just used sauce from a jar. My only problem was I cooked the noodles too long (my fault), which made them too limp and hard to stuff with meat. I liked these because I don't like the regular manicotti with cheese filling. Thank you for the recipe!

Easy recipe and the family loved it.  I read other comments and took note of some of the changes and altered my dinner as well.  I added 2 more cloves of garlic, instead of bread crumbs I used used ricotta cheese, mixed ground Italian sausage and beef and added fresh basil an cilantro. Delicious!

This is a family favorite. My 5 year old son gets so excited when we are having Fill Ups, as he's named them! I've stuck pretty close to the recipe. I do use a pound of ground venison, 12-13 manicotti shells, and left out the wine, because I didn't have it on hand. I now make this regularly. It's one dinner I know I don't have to fight my sons, 20 months and 5, about eating.

This was good- specifically for the non cheese eaters in the family.  It was a lot of work for a week night meal- you do need some time to make it and some time for the many pots to be cleaned up afterwards. 
Used pinot grigio for the wine and I was worried that the sauce wasn't going to be flavorful and too runny- once it baked up it was very good.

Great recipe!  Kids liked it (which is very uncommon).  I have added it to my very short list of meals that the entire family will eat.  I used my kids favorite spaghetti sauce instead of the stewed tomatoes/white wine.  I only did this because I didn't have any canned tomatoes.

Excellent! I pre-cook manicotti until just past the brittle stage (approx 3 min) so that they won't split when I stuff them.

I much prefer this to the cheese stuffing usually used in Italian restaurants. 

This recipe joins my 'make often' file.

I made this for the second time tonight. The first time I rated it 2 stars following the recipe exactly as it was. This time I used my own pasta sauce, a great recipe I found here on allrecipes.com. I'll rate it a 3 now because although it was better, it still just didn't do it for me. The meat mixture was bland and dry. I even added extra garlic, garlic salt, and an extra teaspoon of Italian Seasoning. It needs more cheese too in my opinion. Not the best, but not bad either.

I also used 1/2 lb Italian sausage with the ground beef and substituted a jar of spaghetti sauce. In addition, I added an another egg and extra cheddar and Parmesan cheese to the filling.  Everyone loved it, even the 3 and 5 year olds.

Maybe I should've used the wine, it wasn't very flavorfull, but everyone was full and fighting over the last few. I would definantly use a different sauce.

This was an okay recipe - I've just had better.  I prefer manicotti filled with cheese, etc. and then topped with a meaty tomato sauce instead.  The sauce in this recipe was just too thin.

Loved the filling.  Will make again but will use my favorite Prego sauce instead.

Very good.  When I make this again, I will probably try different sauces, just to give it a different flavor.  Love the filling.

We thought this was really good, although I used jarred spaghetti sauce to save time.  I also used a full pound of ground beef, beat the egg before adding it, and added a little sauce to the filling because it looked a little dry.  My husband thought there were too many onions, so I'll use a half of an onion next time. I froze the extra filling to use another time.

I just made this recipe last night and my boyfriend and I thought it was wonderful!!!!!! I replaced the sauce with Ragu sauce but it was still awsome. Also I cut the onions into large slices then removed them because I don't like onions. But anyway...I think next time i  might add some Ragu sauce to the stuffing, but other than that I thought this recipe was excellent!!! Thanks alot!!

This recipe was just what I was looking for.  My very picky daughter even liked it.  I am making it for a dinner in 2 weeks for friends from work.  Easy and delicious.

Thanks for sharing.  I highly recommend it.

This was delicious!  I didn't have bread crumbs but it still had a nice consistency and flavor.  My guests loved it and I will make it again and again.  Thank you for sharing!
