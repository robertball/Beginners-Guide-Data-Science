This was a great guideline to making empanadas. Instead of Apricot jam though, we used an apple jam (very similairly to the way this one was made) and we baked them instead of frying them. They came out delicous.

I used this recipe more as a guideline.  I had fresh apricots I wanted to use up.  I scaled the recipe way down to about 1 cup apricots and didn't use as much sugar as the recipe called for.  I also used puff pastry and baked these.  I loved them, the bf thought they were too tart.

These were very good... The filling almost tasted like pumpkin somehow. The only thing I would have done different is boiled the dried apricots longer. I ended up with about two cups filling leftover and my dough was gone..

My family also makes these at Christmas. Use this recipe as a guideline...I had to add extra water probably used 3 cups total. Also added more cinnamon and cloves, just adjust to your family's taste. We top with cinnamon sugar and bake, if I'm in a hurry I use store bought pie crust dough.
