So quick and easy, and I almost always have the ingredients on hand. My family thought I'd cooked all day! I added corn chips and served it with a generous sprinkling of graded colby cheese.

Delicious and EASY!  I substituted kidney beans for the white beans, and used 1/2 envelope taco seasoning and 1/2 envelope HOT chili seasoning because that's what I happened to have on hand.  My guests loved it and couldn't for the life of them figure out "the wonderful spices".  They couldn't believe the simple secret!

Excellent recipe; I added a can or corn and a can of spicy tomatoes to mine, and it turned out wonderful!

My husband and I like Mexican food, and he really liked it.  I thought it was O.K.  My 6-year old son, however, wouldn't even try it.  I used dried beans instead of canned, and that was what made it somewhat harder than the original recipe published.
