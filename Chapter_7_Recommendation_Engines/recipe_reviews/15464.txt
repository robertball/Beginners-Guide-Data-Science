Yum!  I substituted half the sugar for splenda and half the butter for "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter Fat Free" and these still came out delicious!  I must have been lucky...no problems with lifting the cookies off the tray.

The only reason this did not receive 5 stars is that we thought the recipe could have used more coconut.  Very easy and delicious.  Remember to let these cool before trying to remove from your cookie sheet!  Yummy, but a previous reviewer was not kidding when they said you can't stop at just one!

I used a mini cupcake rack instead of a cookie sheet and they turned out spongy and not flat. The outer crust was crispy and the middle more on the soft side. Best coconut oatmeal cookies I have ever had. Used half cup of coconut too, thanks to a previous review.

When I made this recipe I had my doubts especially after reading some of the reviews, and then came  the oven and they were spreading like CRAZY.  They got brown took em out of the oven and tried one. They were very thin, crisp, and YUMMY!! They were a huge hit at work and probably the easiest cookie I have ever thrown together!!!

This recipe was very good.  I used coconut extract instead of vanilla and topped with melted chocolate.  My family loves them.

Mmm, so good! I managed to burn the first 12.... but eh. They still turned out good! :) I replaced half the butter with applesauce - they're practically guilt free!

Divine! Increase the coconut by 50% and use small dollops of dough, otherwise the cookies will be huge. 
Perfect tea cookie, even though they aren't particularly attractive.

These cookies taste good. They are quite sweet, however, but perhaps it's because I used sweetened flaked coconut (it was the only kind I had). I did add a pinch of salt, but next time I think I'll decrease the sugar amount.  The cookies spread SO MUCH, to the point that I could hardly scrape them off my cookie sheet without them breaking up. They were SO THIN, it was unbelievable. They didn't burn, though. I even added more flour, like someone suggested, but it was not very helpful. The cookies were very hard to scrape off the pan, and I greased it a LOT.  I'm freezing the cookies now, hoping they will harden up.

Taste good but could not get them like the picture at all, they are way too thin. To prevent spreading, I just added more flour and that seemed to help but still, I know they are thin crisps but man, mine are about the thickness of paper, no joke. Probably won't try this again.

Taste fantastic! I substituted coconut extract for vanilla. The only thing that hurt this recipe was the struggle getting them off the pan. I greased the foil very well after reading the other reviews but they still stuck

This recipe really sticks to the pan. It tasted delicious, but I don't think I will make it again. Too much of a hassel.

These cookies were good and are easy to make but were too sweet for my taste. Next time I'm going to cut the sugar in half. I should have known because you would never make your morning oatmeal with equal parts oatmeal and sugar.  I'll definitely listen to other reviews and add more coconut next time and use coconut extract instead of vanilla. Worth making just be careful of the proportions of ingredients.

I enjoyed the crips and flavor. However just as another person posted. They are hard to get off the cookie sheet. This includes baking a second batch with cooking spray on the baking dish first.
