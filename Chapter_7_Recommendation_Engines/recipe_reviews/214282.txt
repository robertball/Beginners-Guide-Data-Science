Excellent dessert! Moist, chewy and with just the right amount of cherry with the chocolate. I used the JELL-O instant pudding but used the chocolate fudge flavor instead of just the chocolate flavor. Served this for a church function and everyone really, really liked them! They disappeared quickly. Definitely will make these again.

Made this one night when I had the urge to bake.  I was very very impressed with how simple this recipe was.  I had to make one more batch an hour after they were done and cooled off cause they went so fast.

Easy and so very delicious! When chopping up the cherries, be a bit careful cuz I learned the hard way that your fingers will turn lobster red. Wear gloves. I also doubled the frosting recipe and added red food coloring. Fun and easy!

these are truly amazing and easy!! it is a very dense moist almost fudge like brownie. thinking about using the brownie as a base and putting different toppings on the brownie. maybe a german chocolate topping or a buttercream frosting on it. these are sooo good you must make these now!! i keep them in the fridge i think they actually taste better out of the fridge!!
