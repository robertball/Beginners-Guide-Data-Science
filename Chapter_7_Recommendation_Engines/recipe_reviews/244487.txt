I added 1 t of sugar, 2 tsp lemon juice, and salt. I thought it tasted bland and with these additions I really like it!

So easy to have a good, quick to make, homemade salad dressing. When I first tasted this dressing just on my fingertip, I was afraid it was too "mustardy" for me. But after I put it on my greens and veggies, it was just fine. A little goes a long way for me. I liked it!
