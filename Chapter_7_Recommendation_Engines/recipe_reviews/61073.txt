Here's the deal -- there's WAAAY to much salt, red pepper, and black pepper in the recipe.  Almost like it was a misprint??  Anyway, I used 1/2 the amount of red pepper and 1/4 amount of salt & black pepper.  Great sauce, very sweet/salty/vinegery, I live in NC and this is just like the vinegary based sauces I like.

Wonderful!  I made this to go along with some pork spare ribs we had in the freezer and it was WONDERFUL!!  I added brown sugar and cut back the salt & pepper.

I reduced the servings in half and then used Catalina salad dressing in place of the ketchup.  Sweetened up and took some bite out of the pepper that way.  It was really good on chicken.

Pepper was overpowering.  I'm all for a tangy, spicy sauce but this tasted ONLY of black and red pepper.

This is NOT NC eastern style BBQ sauce! Eastern style would NEVER add that much sugar/honey NOR ketchup. At best, this would be the Lexington style BBQ sauce.

Great vinegar based recipe! I've made it about 4-5 times now. Thia last time, I changed up the recipe a bit and added burbon and brown sugar, and slightly decreased the amount of peppers and salt. The original recipe has a heavy kick (clears your sinuses!), but with the brown sugar, it wasn't quite as spicy. I use it to poor over shredded pork butt that I cook in the crockpot all day. Thanks Jbird! Great recipe!

I use this recipe as a "base" to add other ingredients. I think the salt and pepper measurements must be wrong--4 cups of liquid yet 1/4 cup black pepper and 1/2 cup salt? Sounds like that would choke a horse ;)  I use the 3 cups apple cider vinegar, ketchup, throw in some salt, pepper, red pepper flakes and use honey or molasses depending on what I have on hand. I use this as the liquid to cook my pork in a slow cooker.   Our family loves it and uses this recipe to create their own sauce by adding ingredients that they like.

I scaled this recipe in half but other than that made as is. It was peppery as other mentioned but it was the amount of honey that was a turn off for me.  Reduce the honey by half and you have a great mopping sauce.
