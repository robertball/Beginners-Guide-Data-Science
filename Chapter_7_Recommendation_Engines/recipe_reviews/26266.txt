When I did the recipe I didn't really think about the ratio of nutmeg to basil in the ingedients.  But the first bite I took I thought to myself.  "Uhhhh, Christmas Bolognese?"  I think that it should be 1 1/2 tsp of dried basil and a pinch of nutmeg.  I would also suggest using a cheese grater to shred the carrot.  Also the recipe needs to be more specific about what type of ham you should use.  It says slices so I guess bacon maybe?  No, I wouldn't use american bacon for a classic italian pasta sauce.  I would used thinly sliced cured italian ham, more commonly referred to as prosciutto.  

I give only two stars because they need to tweak the proportions of the recipe and be more specific as to how much and what kind of ham to use.

You might as well simply chop up some carrots, boil some pasta, then throw the carrots on top.

This recipe should be called Dad's Carrot Meat Sauce. Yep, doublecheck those ingredients, and then do a double take: There are SEVEN carrots in this recipe. 


Four big thumbs-down from the family.

It turned out really great with several modifications.  You certainly don't have to make it this way; I just really preferred it.  I used 8 carrots, a total of 9 oz of tomato paste, 1 medium to large sized white onion, 0.8 lbs of ham, and 2 lbs of ground buffalo.  Also as recommended in other reviews I used 1-1/2 tbs of dried basil and a dash or two of nutmeg.  I sliced the onions, carrots and ham and sauteed them in the butter until the carrots were soft.  I then added the broth, tomato paste, lemon, spices.  I browned the ground buffalo in a separate pan.  I then took all the contents in the carrot/onion/ham pan and blended them in the blender.  I put the blended contents back into the pan and added the ground meat with its juices.  I prefer the only texture to be the ground meat and everything else to be a puree.  At the very end I added about 2 tbs of cream.  I'm not a big fan of heavy tomato based sauces as the tomatoes are too acidic for me and give me reflux.  So this was an excellent alternative.  If you do like more tomato flavor, you can always increase the tomato paste even more!

My family didn't care for the nutmeg flavor.
Too many carrots. Wasn't that good...will try again w/ fewer carrots and no nutmeg.

My husband, toddler, and I loved this sauce. It cooks up quickly and is delicious. I grated the carrots (we don't currently have a processor and it's easier for my young toddler to handle) and used 1 1/2 tsp basil and a pinch of nutmeg instead of what the recipe called for. I thought it wouldn't be 'tomato-y' enough (because of just the tomato paste), but it was just right.

This recipe is really easy to put together and great for family gatherings (one pot of sauce for all!). The lemon zest adds a little zing to the bolognese sauce and the cream just makes it so yummy (I put in two tablespoons of cream).

The "different" list of ingredients for this recipe really piqued my interest. I've been cooking for a long time and I've never made a "red" pasta sauce using carrots, lemon zest, beef broth, butter or cream. I had to give it a try. I used 7 carrots that weighed 11 oz. after peeling and trimming.  I used deli sliced smoked ham, but the slices were very thin, so I ended up using 8 slices weighing a total of 4 oz.  I couldn't make myself use a whole stick of butter and ended up using just  1/4 cup. I reversed the measurements for the basil and the nutmeg and added 1/4 cup of water to the mixture before simmering (to make up for the 1/4 cup of butter I omitted). Contrary to what several other reviewers stated, this is not quick. I recommend using the full 2 hours to simmer the sauce so that the flavors have a chance to develop. I added 2 tbsp. of cream at the end, rather than one. It was very, very tasty!  I've since googled bolognese sauce and found this is very close to an authentic sauce. Next time I make this, I will cut back on the carrots to about half of what I used this time and I will add garlic and one or two ribs of chopped celery to the vegetable mixture. In place of the 1/4 cup of water I used, I will use 1/4 cup of dry wine and I'll probably up the cream to 3 or 4 tbsp. This sauce is very adaptable. Thank you so much, Alisona, for sharing your father's recipe. It was a big hit with my family!

I LOVE this recipe. I stumbled upon it when googling a generic search for "bolognese recipe". It's unique and delicious, and a little Greek inspired I think.  I too take down the nutmeg quotient just a bit, but all in all, a delish dish!

This is a great tasting sauce, although I find its missing tomato paste, I put 2 big cans of tomato paste and added about two tablespoons of Romano and Parmesan cheese.

I thought this recipe had a great depth of flavor but if you use only a pinch of nutmeg its and much better, and I think it's also better without any lemon zest

I just used a dash or two of nutmeg, I find any more will be over powering.  I also added in some diced celery hearts and fresh chopped garlic, and used 7 baby carrots...I topped it with shaved Parmesan Reggiano cheese.  OMG it was amazing!!!

It was tasty but had to be tweaked the 2nd time. Only used 3 medium carrots that we grated, used Parma Ham, took out the Nutmeg and used sour cream instead of the heavy cream (didn't have any on hand) and with these minor adjustments it turned out fantastic...it was wonderful poured over homemade sweet potato wedges topped with a little grated mozz....super yummy!!!

I would like to know about the 4 slices of ham - Huge ham slices, or just lunch meat size?  Why can't a pkg. of chopped ham be used?  Seems 7 carrots would be too much.  Haven't decided whether to make it or nor.

This is a definite keeper recipe in our house. It's one of the best homemade bolognese sauces I've ever come across. It's a great way to get kids who shy away from vegetables to eat them without realizing they are.

I thought this was really good and made it twice in 2 weeks. I followed suggestions to reverse nutmeg and basil. I used 1/4 lb of sweet Italian sausage instead of ham and used more cream cause it's just so good!

I followed others suggestions that the amount of Basil and Nutmeg be reversed. I also used half the amount of Carrots at my wife's request and substituted red wine for half the beef broth. Definitely a keeper recipe for me with those changes. I will add 2 cloves of Garlic next time, but that is our taste.

I was pleasantly surprised the lemon zest was good as an ingredient.  I've tried many bolognese recipes and this was pretty good.  I added mushrooms and garlic in the food processor with the ham, carrots and onion.  I didn't taste any of the nutmeg and I'd probably add more basil.  I'd make it again.

This was excellent, thank you....Hardy and delicious! I used 2 cans of tomato paste and nixed the nutmeg only because my family is not a fan. It does have a tendency to take over  flavor so served it alongside rather than inside.  Aside from that I followed the recipe and loved the fact that it has so much carrot. I wondered how good it would be and was pleasantly surprised.  The ham and lemon were an unexpected delight.  This is a keeper and I will make this often..  At some point I may even attempt to use ground turkey but for now this was perfect. Butter makes EVERYTHING better!!

Delicious!  I made this with minor changes from previous reviews. I don't like nutmeg so I omitted that. Also did not add carrots since 7 carrots seems like a lot and I thought carrots in a meat sauce would be odd. Everything else was the same as listed with the addition of 3 finely chopped garlic cloves. I also had fresh basil from the garden and used 4 leaves instead of dried basil. This was delicious! I think adding the beef broth really adds to the flavor! Next time I will make more and use 2 lbs of beef as the 1.5 lbs seemed like a small quantity

Added a stalk of celery chopped.  Yes, I'll prepare this again.  That much nutmeg is not needed and Spanish Serrano Ham or Prosciutto is better than regular ham.

At long last a Bolognese sauce that doesn't take all day long.  Easy and very flavourful.
