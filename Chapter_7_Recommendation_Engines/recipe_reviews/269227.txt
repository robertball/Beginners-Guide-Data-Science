Loved it!  Substituted 2 cans  northern beans, fire roasted diced tomatoes with green chilis , 1 tsp dried thyme ,about 3 cups frozen spinach/kale mix  and a small amount of broken up  pappardelle egg noodles. Left out lemon zest and crushed red pepper.  Next time  Did not use the 1 TBS oil to brown sausage.  The grease from meat is plenty enough to saute the onions and garlic.  Easy  to make.  Just throw everything in a pot and let it simmer.

I made one change: I added the hambone I’d saved from Thanksgiving! Wow! It was A-Mazing!! The flavors went pop in your mouth.  We loved it! The pasta added lots of texture. My instant pot pressure cooker blended all the flavors together perfectly. I will definitely make this recipe again. Thanks.

I made this as written and it is fantastic.  It took quite a while for the instant pot to get up to pressure when all of the  chicken stock was added.  Should have seen it coming.

Loved this recipe.  My husband would not stop raving about it and said it is one of his top 3 soups he has ever had.  It took a while to make, but was well worth it.  Made it exactly as the recipe stated.

I made this twice per the recipe, and it was delicious both times!  While it takes awhile since you have to pressurize 3 times- it's worth it.  Very flavorful and healthy!  I used regular chicken stock, so I simply omitted the additional salt.  It was fine.

I doubled the smoked sausage and left out the pasta. It was delicious! My family loved it! Soaked the beans overnight and cooked it on the stove. Easy!

I followed the recipe to the fullest with the except of the zest and shell noodles. Came out very good! Kids loved it. It was really good but probably wont make it a regular recipe because of how many times I had to pressure cook and wait. Otherwise I would have given 5 stars.

I made the stovetop version according to directions since it was my first time making it. I forgot the pasta, but we didn’t miss it. The soup was delicious! We will make this again. We’re sharing some with a friend tomorrow. I know he’ll enjoy it.
