I made this recipe with pecans instead of walnuts; a deep dish 9-inch pie crust and a little extra spice.  It was a huge hit over Thanksgiving!

This is my new favorite pumpkin pie recipe! I made this for Thanksgiving this year. The struesel topping adds a delicious touch to the classic pumpkin pie. The sweetened condensed milk makes a very smooth, creamy filling and provides just the right amount of sweetness. 

The recipe is easy to prepare. I threw all of the filling ingredients into the blender, blended it for a minute or two, and poured it into the prepared crust.

This was my first time ever to make a pumpkin pie.  This was so simple to make, but I didn't use a graham cracker crust, I used a regular pie dough.  I also mis-read the instructions for the cinnamon, usually when an ingredient will have 2 seperate uses w/in the same recipe it will list the amount like "1 1/2 tsp cinnamon, divided". Unfortunately this recipe did not have it listed as such, so I put the whole amount of cinnamon in the filling,   not to worry, the cinnamon was not over powering.  I really enjoyed the topping as well.  When I served it, I placed some fresh whipped cream on the pie...yummy!

I am usually the first to skip the pumpkin pie at dessert time at Thanksgiving because I have not cared for it in the past. This year my hubby asked if I could make a pumkin pie. I made this and it was absolutely wonderful. This is the first pumpkin pie that I can say I look forward to eating. My family is coming to town to ring in the New Year and I am going to be making it again for them. I used a pilsbury deep dish crust instead of a gram cracker crust and I also left out the nuts in the strusel. It still turned out great!!!

This is a wonderful recipe.  I found it years ago on the back of a Eagle condensed milk can.  I have made it every Thanksgiving since then.  It is easy, tasty, and beautiful to serve!  Enjoy!

Ok, call me a skeptic, but I have never liked pumpkin pie.  Until I tried this one a couple of years ago.  I tried it out on the family at Thanksgiving and absolutely love it.  I make it every year for home and even bake one to take into my office to share and enjoy.  They are already asking to have one before the holiday even gets here.  This pumpkin pie is fabulous.

I made this for Thanksgiving, and it was very well received!  Instead of walnuts, I used pecan, and I doubled the amount of streusel. Like others, I also added more of each spice. My family really enjoyed it - we had no leftovers!

Love this version. I made mine in an oblong pan without the crust. Let it cool and cut into squares to serve. Great with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream. Bake time was the same.

Super easy and delicious! I added a dash of vanilla to the filling and went a little heavier on the spices as suggested by others and it really enhanced the flavor.

Very easy, and very good!  I made this yesterday for my mother-in-law's birthday.  I prepared it exactly as written except I doubled the streusel topping and used pecans instead of walnuts.  My mother-in-law raved about it!

I loved this pie and will make again however, my oven browned the topping too much, next time I bake I will not put the topping on until 15 minutes before pie is finished.

Excellent pie, easy recipe. I used pecans because I like them better than walnuts. I put the nuts, pecans, butter, flour, and brown sugar in the food processor for a quick few pulses. I did, however burn the top of the graham cracker crust a little. I wish I had folded back down the top foil edge that already comes with a graham cracker crust, lol. That would have been so simple.

This was very good a must try! I am not a fan of traditional pumpkin pie so I always look for variations and this one is a keeper. I made my own graham cracker crust and used pecans instead of walnuts. I used cinnamon and pumpkin pie spice. Very easy to make.

Way better than plain old pumpkin pie!  I doubled the streusel and added some powdered or finely chopped walnuts to it along with the chopped walnuts.  Everyone LOVED it!  I'll definitely make it again next Thanksgiving!

So easy, pretty and tastes great.  It is a sweet topping, so those with a sweet tooth will like this the most.  I made my own graham crust and the tops browned a bit too much. When I make again I will cover the edges with foil so that the edges don't overbrown.  Very good alternative to standard pumpkin pie.

The name says it all!  This was a very easy recipe.  This was the first time I made pumpkin pie and my 74 yr old mother said, 'I've had a lot of pumpkin pie over the years and this is the best I've ever had'!!  
Thank you for making my first pie so memorable!!

This was a great pumpkin pie recipe. The only thing that I did differently was substitute oatmeal for the walnuts (my son is allergic). It came out great, and my husband who doesn't like pumpkin pie ate it up! The extra crunch from the topping made it great!

Delicious! I didn't change a thing when I made this recipe and it came out great. The next time I make it, I might reduce the streusel by 25% since it seemed like a bit more than needed. Otherwise, it's perfect and very easy to make! Thanks.

This pumpkin pie recipe is wonderful! I have been using this recipe for several years, and it never disappoints! The only variation that I utilize is that I use a mixture of walnuts and pecans for the topping, and sometimes I use a dough crust.

The pumpkin pie itself was okay, could of used a bit more spice. The streusel didn't come out like streusel is supposed to at all! It clumped together into a doughy ball... I think regular sugar would of been better for it than brown sugar. Next pumpkin pie will definitely be without the streusel.

This was a very good pie.  However, the appearance of it was not as nice as just regular pumpkin pie, and not many people tried it at our Thanksgiving dinner.  It tasted wonderful, but I guess it depends on what you like too.  It was a little heavy, actually--I think I prefer just plain pumpkin pie to this, however, it is nice for a change.

I've made this recipe every Thanksgiving for the last five years, and it's always a hit. I usually use pecans instead of walnuts, but I'm sure it will come out wonderfully with walnuts as well.   One thing is that this makes enough for a true 9-inch pie dish. The graham crackers crusts from the store that I usually buy say they are 9-inch, but I think they're a wee bit smaller. And then I always make the mistake of overfilling my crust because I have too much mix. Resist the urge to do that and you'll have a perfect pie! :)

Delicious! I subbed Pecans for Walnuts and added about 1/2 cup oatmeal to streusel mixture.

I'm not a fan of pumpkin pie & this recipe was pretty good! I still don't love it but prefer it this way. My hubby who also doesn't care for pumpkin pie had 2 pieces & said it was real good!! My parents who I made it for & are the pumpkin pie lovers thought it was the best thing ever & wondered why they never thought to try crumb topping on it! Everyone loved it, thanks for the great recipe!

Great pie! I preferred the Graham cracker crust and substituting chopped pecans instead of walnuts. I'm usually not a fan of pumpkin or pecan pie, but this recipe was a yummy superior version combining the two's strengths.

I made this exactly as the recipe states except I accidentally left out the walnuts.  Everyone loved it.  It was the first dessert gone on Thanksgiving Day.

Absolutely wonderful! My husband who is a great fan of pumpkin pie wasn't too sold on the idea of streusel on pumpkin pie, but he enjoyed it more then the traditional pie I made. The only change I made was I used 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice and 1 tsp cinnamon in place of the spices called for. I also pre-toasted the walnuts in a low temp oven for 5 min. prior to adding to the streusel mixture. The streusel along with this pie's graham cracker crust gives a whole new exciting dimension of flavor and texture to pumpkin pie! Is now a favorite!

This is my new standard for pumpkin pie.  Delicious!  I used pecans instead of walnuts.  When sprinkling on the streusel topping, I stopped after using about 75% of it - seemed enough to me.  The graham cracker crust added to the taste in my opinion.  A great pie recipe!

I thought this pie had good flavor after using more of the spices that it called for but it was much too sweet.  I plan on using this recipe and experimenting with evaporated skim milk and adding my own sugar because I like the idea of it.

#1 This will be your all time favorite, very quick and easy to put together and even easier to eat. Wonderful all year around, exactly as the other Eagle brand pie but with a great and easy to do topping that adds an extra goodness, with or without the pecans.

this was most definitely the best pumpkin pie i've ever had or made!  i cut back the sugar slightly and the texture still held just fine - also wasn't sickeningly sweet!

Everyone asks for this recipe. I use regular crust though because I think it has enough sugar already. I also use pecans instead of walnuts- just my preference.

This recipe sounded great in theory and did not turn out. The topping turned a dark brown and look burned even though the pie was hardly done. I was very disappointed.
