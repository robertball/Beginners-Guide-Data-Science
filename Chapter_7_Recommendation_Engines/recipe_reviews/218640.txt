Great sandwich and easy to make. My 92 year old grandmother who doesn't believe in "fancy" cooking loved it. I used feta instead of Roquefort since I had that (plus it's cheaper) and it worked great.

Excellent combination of flavors.  I used leftover "High Temperature Eye-of-Round Roast", thinly sliced.  Other than that, I made no changes to the recipe.   Next time, I will try it with onions instead of shallots, and I will add a little more horseradish to the sauce.   The sauce was tasty, but very mild.  Thanks for the idea!

I used blue cheese (it's what I had on hand) instead of roquefort.   if you do the same, do reduce the amount, as it will overpower the mildness of the shallots just a little.  I used shallots because I had some, but I certainly wouldn't hesitate to  use onions if that's all I had.  I didn't have any heavy cream, so I just mixed up a sour cream-horseradish sauce which worked well as a sub.  I think some sauteed mushrooms would be a good addition to this sandwich.  Very nice panini.

I made this at a tailgate on a grill using a cast iron grill and pressed it down with a brick wrapped in foil....I decided to substitute provolone cheese but it was outstanding. Rave reviews from my group.

Pretty good.  I liked this concept.  My horseradish cream did not come out very strong.  Not sure why, I used fresh horseradish root and grated it.  The panini did not get as crisp and marked as I hoped, my first time using the panini press.  The taste was very good however.  Next time will use a less crusty bread.  (the bakery suggested I use one with a lot of cunchy exterior for my panini, which I ended up not liking).

These were yummy.  I used feta because I was out of Roquefort.  And the horseradish cream was AMAZING.

Hubby and I loved it. I did a few substitutions though, I used sourdough bread instead of baguette, and used Gorgonzola instead of Roquefort because, well, I won't even pretend to know what that is. I added minced garlic because the experts say garlic has superpowers, and I need all the help I can get. I used a little too much cream for the sauce, and it came out like a fluffy horseradish cloud....YUM.  Served with a side of sauerkraut. We're all supposed to eat sauerkraut. Something about probiotics.

This is such a simple and delicious dish!!  I've made it on several occasions and everyone loves it. I substituted Gorgonzola cheese because I couldn't find Roquefort. The horseradish sauce is also a good dip for potato chips!

Didn't make the horseradish cream, but it was still very good.
