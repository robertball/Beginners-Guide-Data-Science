This soup is absolutely delicious! I made a few changes to make it thicker and tastier.  I added 3 cloves of garlic, added extra chili powder, added 2.5 cups of chicken broth instead of 4 cups of vegetable stock, added chopped celery (2 stalks) when I added the corn, and used 3 cans of beans instead of 2 (1.5 in the blender and 1.5 as whole beans).  I like using the Del Monte Fiesta Corn when making this recipe because the pieces of pepper add a little more spice.  All in all, a GREAT soup.  I made it for my parents and my 13-year old sister and we ate the entire pot in one sitting.  My sister is the pickiest eater ever and she loved it, so that says alot about how good it was.  Thanks so much for sharing this with us, DeeDee!

This soup is some of the best I've ever tasted! BUT, after reading a few reviews about it being 'watery' and 'bland', I:
reduced the broth to 2 cups; added an extra can of beans (not pureed); used 2 tsp cumin; 2 cloves of garlic; added 1/3 c cilantro; plus I left out the corn. With a little Greek yogurt (or sour cream) on top... WOW!! Incredible. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a wonderful soup recipe!!!  I followed directions exactly the first time, but the second time around added a zucchini and about 1T of chopped fresh cilantro; used frozen corn instead of canned (less sodium); garnished with shredded Mont.Jack cheese and served with warm buttered flour tortillas.  Perfect!

Fantastic soup!  I added about a cup of celery, a green pepper, and a sprinkling of thyme with the cumin and chili powder.  I also cut down on the vegetable stock to 2 1/2 cups(thanks to those who advised against 4 cups), but added another 1/2 cup when re-heating because it thickened after the first meal.  Filling, very tasty, very healthy wonderful soup.

This recipe is wonderful!  Usually black bean soup is thick and tastes like nothing, but black beans.
I actually like the boring old black bean soup that I just described, but this recipe is
ten times better!  You can taste the onions and carrots and corn.  It has wondeful
flavor!  I will definitely be making this again.  I put a little bit of shredded cheese on
top.

This was *fantastic.*  I was in the mood more for a stew than a soup, so I made a few changes...added a pound of thin sliced beef strips (marinated), a few more carrots, and some green pepper and sauted it all with the onion and garlic.  Drained it, and finished the recipe as its written (3 c stock instead of 4)...except that I added 3/4 cup rice at the end, making a delicious thick, hearty stew.  Mmmmm...a feast served with garlic bread and applesauce.

This is delicious!  It tasted good on a warm summer night and I can't wait to make it for winter meals.  Recommend using less broth (2 1/2 to 3 cups) to make it thicker.  It has a great texture and flavor!  
thanks for sharing the recipe!

Wonderful--I was not disappointed--my 13-yr-old son couldn't eat enough of it and said it was the best soup I ever made.  My only addition was to add celery and I cooked it longer than suggested, as I cut my vegetables in chunks as we like it that way, so it took a little longer for the vegetables to cook--also, extra cooking time helped thicken it.  Nutritious, delicious, and economical--what more could you ask?  Definitely a Must Try!  I'll be making again soon.

Excellent soup, and I'm not even that crazy about vegetable soups!  I added an additional can of black beans, a little bit of celery, some green bell pepper and some mexican spices.  I simmered mine for a few hours and added the corn and some arborio rice the last 30 minutes of cooking.   Next time I'll throw in some spinach.  This is definitely one of those soups you can add just about anything to and it comes out great.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Excellent soup!  I made mine with chicken stock and chopped the carrots in the food processor because I don't like cooked carrots, but wanted the flavor....it was wonderful!  My fiance and I really enjoyed it!  We used chicken stock and canned corn that is labeled "no salt added", so it made it even healthier!  I will be taking left-overs to work tomorrow and will definately be making this recipe again!  thank you!

After scooping into individual bowls, added to each:  a sprinkle of shredded cheddar cheese (1/4 cup lightly packed), freshly chopped cilantro, and approx 1 Tablespoon of light sour cream.  Flavors were still a bit dull.  Juice of fresh lemon (approx 5 squirts per bowl) livened the flavors and made a big difference.    Other changes made for personal preference:  Used three cloves garlic, diced the carrots into smaller pieces, added diced celery & dried thyme per other reviewers, substituted more beans for corn (didn't have corn), and added fresh, chopped tomatoes at end for consistency and brighter color, cooking for one more minute to warm.    Even the husband, who gravitates toward greasy, unhealthy foods, enthusiastically praised the meal and happily went for seconds.    Thanks for the fast, economical, healthy, and satisfying recipe!

This made for a pretty tasty soup. I did make a few changes. I started out with a "mirepoix", which was basically sauteeing the onion, carrot, and some celery together in olive oil and a bit of butter. I used pre-shredded carrots from the store. I added the garlic after about 10 minutes, and really cooked everything down until it was quite caramelized. It takes about 25 minutes to do that. Then, deglazed with a carton (approx 4 cups) of chicken stock, making sure to scrape the yummy stuff off the bottom of the pot. Then added the spices and a can each of black beans, and a can of corn with red and green peppers in it (a can of Southwestern Niblets, I think it was).I didn't have any tomatoes on hand, so I pureed the other can of black beans with 2 small cans of tomato sauce. Dumped it in, let simmer as directed. Then I removed the cover and let the soup reduce a bit. My secret for a bit of extra richness is a tablespoon or so of the best balsamic vinegar you can get. I served this over a chunk of cornbread in the bottom of the bowl. It was a hit!

Delicous!! Its a simple,healthy & easy soup to  make. I always have all of these ingredients in my pantry. I cut it in half for the 2 of us. My husband loved it. I made it as directed with just a few changes. I let it simmer slightly all afternoon, so it had time to thicken -- thats the "key"  to a thicker soup- my soup was not watery at all. I added more garlic, some celery,and  more of the spices. I will be making this again. thanks for sharing  your recipe.  Oh  I did add about  1/3 cup chopped ham that I  had frozen from some leftover ham from  the  holidays - probalby not needed, but was a good  addition anyway.

I quadrupled this as a choice for an Ash Wednesday soup dinner at our church, and it was delicious. The people that tried it came back for seconds, and it is a recipe that I will definitely make again. I love that it doesn't need salt and is a true vegetarian soup. It was perfect for those that were giving up meat for Lent - very hearty and satisfying.

I only gave it three stars because of a lot changes I made to the recipe based on other reviewers. I used more beans, used chicken broth instead of veggie broth, added more cumin, and more chili powder, also used fresh cilantro and a little sour cream. After all the changes it still wasn't quite perfect, still good though. Next time I will add more garlic and throw in another type of bean. The recipe is a keeper if changes are made but you can do almost anything you want with it and still have a pretty decent easy soup recipe.

Absolute favorite in my house!  I followed some of the recommendations given by others - more beans and more carrots.  In addition, I brown ground turkey with taco seasoning, put a small amount in the bottom of the bowl, and pour the soup over it.  Serve with cornbread muffins!

This recipe is definitely a keeper! Very flavorful, but not too spicy.  I also followed a few of the recommendations: added 3 cans of black beans instead of 2; 1 can of DelMonte diced tomatoes with zesty mild green chillies instead of stewed tomatoes and decreased the vegetable stock to 3 cups.   I also added cilantro; extra chilli powder and 2 garlic cloves.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This was good, but I should have followed others advice and reduced the liquid. It was way too watery. I added celery and bell pepper. It was even better the next day after the flavors had time to sink in. Next time I will add less liquid and make it the day before I serve it.

This was fantastic. I used 3 cans of beans, chicken stock instead of vegetable, 2 cans of diced tomatoes with green chillis (i pureed one can with half the beans, and just dumped the other can right in), added one red bell pepper, 2 cloves garlic, and tweaked the spices a bit to my liking. I'll make this over and over.

I like this soup!  I don't get where people are saying 4 cups of vegetable stock will make it too soupy. I am glad I didn't do that. I made as written except added celery salt, garlic powder and a bit more chile powder. Nice, filling, low-cal lunch!

My husband is addicted to this soup.  I think it's great because it's so easy to prepare (just about all the ingredients come from a can) and it's pretty satisfying.  My husband's favorite description of this dish: "It's BURSTING with flavor!"  It's particularly good if you eat it with some flour tortillas that you toast right on top of your stove.  Very good and filling!

Suddenly I found I was entertaining vegitarians for dinner and was 20 miles from a grocery store.  Using what I had on hand this was a fantastic dinner.  I used 1/2 of the recommended stock and still thickened it a little with a sprinkling of orzo (baby pasta)  Anything with beans and corn in it reminds me of slightly Mexican, so I offered quartered fresh limes to squeeze in, and everyone loved it.  Served it with a great green salad and sour dough garlic bread. It was a great meal!

It was a very nice soup.  I decreased the amount of stock by one cup and it tasted like chili.  Wouold be even better in the winter with some nice oven-baked bread.

After following the "most helpful," tips this was awesome.  I ate it for days and rarely ever eat leftovers.  I nearly followed all of "hbombs," suggestions. Incase you haven't done this yet, you can sort reviews by date, most helpful or submitter.  It's located on top of the review page.  Thanks for recipe! *3/26/07: Additional note:  I add the corn towards the end to make sure that it retains its crunch.

Really good recipe that turns out well.  I think that the recipe could use a bit more "oomph," so I use more chili powder and cumin, but this is a great comfort food recipe.  Also, I find that cooking it a bit longer makes it thicker, which I like.

This is soooo good! The perfect dinner for a rainy day.I made cornbread muffins to go with. I didn't have a can of stewed tomatoes, so I pureed the beans with about 5 ounces of tomato sauce, and then added 2 chopped tomatoes to the last 5 minutes of cooking the soup. I didn't have chili powder, so just added a little more cumin. If you want a thicker soup, definately start with 2 cups of stock and add more later as desired. It doesn't reduce that much.....mine was on the stove on low for about 50 minutes (waiting for hubby) and barely reduced. I will definately make this again! mmmmmmm

Excellent soup as it is....  however- if you need to use up some veggies in the fridge, feel free to add peppers and celery and whatever other veggie you may have that you don't want to go bad

This is rich and hearty.  I took the suggestions of other reviewers and used 3 cans of beans, only 2 cups of water and no extra salt.  I made Nancy Pasqualone's cornbread recipe to go with it.  What a great dinner.

Excellent Easy Soup!  Doubled the amount of the stewed tomatoes/black bean puree to thicken it up a bit and added part of a small can of diced green chiles. Really really good!

This soup was delicious and had a perfect spiciness.  It seemed a little thin--I would use less stock next time.  My husband thought it would be good with crunchy tortilla strips, like tortilla soup.

This recipe was great! Super yummy with some cornbread on the side. The only change I made was to use 1 can pinto beans instead of one of the black beans. I still blended the black beans but added the pinto to the soup whole. I made the sub because I only had one can of black beans in the pantry. It was still really good.

I started making this a while back, I have made some  changes and add some things each time. This recipe is so awesome and versatile.. You don't have to play it by the rules each time you make it, add what suits your taste buds. It's definitely a favorite in my home.

I did change this recipe a bit to suit our tastes, but I stand by the high rating. :)
I chopped up baby carrots, 1 onion, 2 green bell peppers and 2 cloves garlic, omitted the corn (not a fan of corn in soup) and used chicken stock instead of veggie. Also, I increased the yield of the recipe a bit by using 3 cans of beans (half of them smashed), 1 (14.5 oz) can of crushed tomatoes and 1 (10 oz) can of Ro-Tel. For a bit of kick, I threw in some slices of jalapeno (and fished out most of them at the end because I chickened out and was worried it would be too spicy). I added a bit of paprika (plus the spices as written) and I used low-sodium broth. I didn't think it needed any additional salt, but I was worried it would be a bit bland so I put in a dash or two each of liquid smoke and balsamic vinegar for some depth. My husband voted for bacon instead of liquid smoke, but I opted to try and keep it fairly healthy. :) I ended up simmering for about 3 hours though I could have stopped at about an hour as everything was cooked through and really tasty already. I served this topped with plain low-fat yogurt and homemade cheddar-jalapeno focaccia bread. Mmm.
This is a great recipe that you can spin towards your preferences very easily. Tasty, filling and definitely a dish I'll be repeating.

This was the best soup I have ever made.  I cooked ground beef with cumin and chili powder and added it to my husband's servings of the soup and he LOVED it as well.  This one is a keeper.

This was really good and really easy. I took everyone's advice and added some pasta to thicken it up.  Next time I might add some canned chicken.

This was delicious but I made a few changes.  I can't eat too much beans so I took out one can of the black beans.  First I sautéed the onions, garlic, carrots, and spices and threw in the tomatoes. Then I added the vegetable broth and 1 can of sliced potatoes (that substituted for the extra can of beans). I boiled it until the carrots softened. Then I puréed with an immersion blender. Then added the corn and beans. I adjusted the salt and added pepper.

This soup is good but I have another recipe that I use for black bean soup that I got off the back of a Bush's Black Bean can that is a LOT less work and has a bit more WOW to it.  Although, this recipe is probably healthier with all the added veggies.

Very good!  Only things I changed are that I cooked the veggies in 2 tablespoons of EVOO instead of veg. oil and I only used 2 cups of chicken stock (more flavor than veg. stock and it didn't hurt the soup).  4 cups would have been far too watery, like reviewers said.  Lots of protein, very healthy, and very good!  Will make it again!

Delish mix of flavours. I did use chicken stock as I don't keep veggie stock in the house (I just use powdered where it's not the main base...since toms/beans are added here). Also, and this smoky flavour totally worked, I fried about 4 lean pieces of double-smoked bacon first, removed, fried the veggies in the small amount of fat (about 1 tbsp) and DID NOT drain, and then continued adding ingdts as written...this gave the soup a great smokey flavour that really suited the black beans, tomato and corn. Almost a BBQ flavour. I added the chopped cooked bacon along with the corn. Very good and would be good without the 2 changes above, to stay veggie.

This soup was really good and very healthy! Only changes I made were...I used no sodium vegetable broth and no sodium stewed tomatoes, just added 1 clove of garlic, pureed the 1 can of stewed tomatoes with some left over meat pasta sauce and then pureed the 1 can of black beans into that! Oh...and I only added 1 teaspoon of the chili powder because I wanted to make sure my 3 year old daughter would eat the soup! 
We all loved it! I garnished it with chopped cilantro, diced avocado and a little bit of light sour cream and it was delicious! You could also crunch some tortilla chips in it if you wanted to! It definitely was a great way to use up the rest of my meat pasta sauce and it flavored the soup really nice! A must try because it is super easy!

This was a really simple recipe that was delicious and filling. I did make a few changes based on the reviews (used half the stock suggested), my tastes (doubled the garlic, added oregano), and what ingredients I had on hand (only had one can of black beans, but I had a can of kidney beans, so I used that too). It's a really easy recipe to tweak or add more veggies too. It was picky 6 year old approved. I'll definitely be using it again.

I love this soup!  I follow the directions with one exception, you only need 1/2 of the veggie stock called for, maybe even a little less than that.  It is a big hit in my house, even my 2 year old finishes her bowl! Serve it with cornbread and sprinkle it with shredded cheese and a dollop of sour cream to make it even better!

Loved this soup! I made the recipe almost exact except added an extra onion, 2 stalks of celery, a cup of frozen corn rather than a can, and based on other reviews only added 2 1/2 cups of vegetable broth. At the end I whisked in 1 1/2 tablespoons of corn starch so it wasn't so runny.

I use my electric pressure cooker on almost all soups I make. Instead of a food processor I used my hand held blender at the end of cooking time and with a few pulses, it blended the soup perfectly.  

Paired it with some shredded cheddar cheese and corn muffins. A great combo!

I will make again! Next time maybe only 2 cups of broth and 2 cans of stewed tomatoes, just to see the difference. My husband was skeptical with the fact of not eating meat for dinner but he LOVED it!

We all enjoyed this. I combined a lot of other reviews and did the following... 2 cups chicken broth, 1 and half teaspoons cumin, and added cheese once served. If I would have had cilantro, I would have added that too. My 10 year old had seconds and loved it. Very satisfied over all!

I loved this soup! Used less vegtable stock, per other reviewers suggestion.  Added some cayenne for extra kick.  Thanks Dee Dee!

Delicious.  I made several changes, but I rate this a 5 for a starter.  I added more spice than called for, and also added garlic & onion powder.  I added zucchini, and used frozen corn instead of canned.  Diced can tomatoes instead of stewed (that's what I had in my pantry).  chicken broth instead of vegetable broth (again, that's what I had on hand).  I had no trouble with it being too soupy, actually it was very stew-like, but I think that's because I added a lot of extra veggies.  Based on a similar recipe for lentils, that I made (flavors were similar), I added LEMON JUICE and chopped CILANTRO.  I *highly* recommend these two flavors as adding something exceptional to the taste. Try it, I promise you won't be sorry!!!

Soup is amazing but I only gave 4 stars because the original recipe as written is definitely too watery.  Now when I make it I use 2 cans of black beans and also I used 1.5 times the spices called for.  When I double the recipe I use 2 carrots 3/4 of a red pepper and 2 stalks of celery.  This adds more color and flavor.At the end I add chopped cilantro and lime.  This is so good it is the only recipe I would ever use for black bean soup, everyone loves it.  Now I double the recipe always.   Oh and the recipe doesn't call for salt but it goes without saying that salt is essential.  I add some when I saute the onion and then add more to taste

Very good, easy to make.  Didn't have stewed tomatoes, so I peeled then cut up a few tomatoes and boiled them for five minutes in one cup of water before adding to the soup.  Also only had one 19oz can of black beans on hand, so pureed half of that one can while adding the other half to the soup.  Omitted the oil by softening the onion, garlic, and carrots in a few tablespoons of vegetable stock.  Thank you for a great recipe!

A great healthy hearty soup to serve for dinner.  My very picky finance liked it and that's saying alot. Next time I think I'll put the carrots in the blender as Mr. Picky didn't like looking at them, but didn't mind their flavor.  A keeper.  ****Update**** I was craving this soup and decided I needed it agin for dinner, then realized I didn't have an onion and had only one carrot.  I went ahead and made it anyway, omitting the onion and adding two turnips (all I had).  After I suateede the catot and turnups, I put them in the blender (so Hubs wouldn't complain about the funny colors) with half the beans and the tomatoes.  After I combined all ingredients and let simmer for awhile, soup still looked a little thinner than I wanted, so I added another small can of black beans.  Result was wonderful!  A thick chili like consistancy that helped me sneak some extra veggies in.  A very forgiving recipe that I love even more now!

We really enjoy this soup!  I've been making an effort to eat healthier, and this fits in perfectly.  The first time I made it, I used dried black beans that I had soaked ahead of time (less salt).  A couple days ago I made it again while visiting my parents.  That time I used canned (rinsed) black beans.  Dad is notorious for wanting his food to be salty, but he didn't add any salt at all.  In fact, he had two bowls and happily finished the leftovers the next day!

This recipe is flexible.  I used half the chili powder because a child would be sharing the meal.  I increased the carrots (same child loves carrots).  We had plenty of fresh tomatoes, so we substituted those for canned.  And since we had Anaheim peppers from the garden, we chopped and added those, too.  

I offered lime wedges, reduced fat sour cream, reduced fat cheddar, and chopped avocados as garnish.  

Thanks for the recipe!

I made this recipe and changed a few things. I used only 2 cups of Vegetable stock and I used 3 cans of black beans (didn't drain) and added 1 can of refired black beans that had jalapeno added. Also, I omitted the corn and for the stewed tomatoes I instead used a can of tomatoes with green chilies. 
Served with sour cream, shredded cheese and sourdough bread. 
Everyone raved about the flavor!

This recipe was delicious and very simple! I took the advice of some of the others. I increased the chili powder by a teaspoon, added 2 extra garlic cloves, and cut back on the vegetable broth. I added some extra corn as well. The carrots didn't get soft as quickly as the recipe said they would, so I had to increase the end cook time by about 8 minutes. The soup seemed like it would freeze great as well (not that you'll likely have leftovers). I will make this again and share the recipe with my vegan friends!

This is a beautiful soup. I didn't puree anything(I just don't like too) and I used diced tomatoes since I didn't have stewed. I also added a can of mixed veggies. Very good! I was so happy to be able to use some of my homemade veggie stock. My family loved this too. I will keep this one!

This soup was so tasty! I like trying to create new soup concoctions by throwing a lot of different veggies together for a low cal, nutritious meal, and I was pleasantly surprised at how good this soup was! I used fresh, raw corn cut from the cob, canned San Marzano tomatoes (the ONLY canned tomatoes worth using!!), fresh spinach and some celery, and threw in a bit of salsa to give it some kick. I didn't use the veggie broth, and just added water as it was needed. I really just guess-timated the amounts of everything I guess, but it came out great! Oh, and I didn't puree anything because I was too lazy. I ate mine with a dollup of fat-free sour cream and it was delicious! Thanks DeeDee!

This was very good.  So easy too.  I'll probably reduce the broth like others suggested or add another can of beans to thicken it up a bit.  Maybe a bit more spice as we like it hotter. 

Thanks!  This is a keeper.

This soup is delicious.  First time I made it I didn't have any black beans, so I substitute a can of kidney beans and a can of chickpeas.  It was fabulous.  Just made it again with the black beans.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and reduced stock to 2 cups.  This gives you a very nice thick soup (although not too thick).  The chunky pieces of carrot, beans and corn really made it a hearty dish.  Great for vegetarians and a complete meal when served with bread or biscuits.  Definitely a keeper!

Awesome soup great flavors and goes together fast and easy.  I "sweated" the onion and garlic w/ non stick spray to cut the fat a little.  Used frozen corn in place of the canned corn.  In place of the veg broth I used chick broth.  I will definately make this soup over and over again.

Yum yum yum.  Quite easy to make, and was great as leftovers for lunch throughout the week.  But I didn't find it at all spicy, even though I followed the recipe exactly.  I'm usually a wimp when it comes to spicy food, so I think those of you who like food that clears your sinuses will need to up the spices on this one.

This is my favorite soup.  I did use two cans of black beans but I also added a can of pinto beans (one half mashed up and the other half I left whole).  I just cut up the stewed tomatoes but didn't puree them.   I also used Italian stewed tomatoes.    Can't wait to eat it again tomorrow.   I don't have to look any further to find the best soup recipe.

This is worth making. I made a double-batch of it last night, and my family and I loved it. I mostly did the recipe as-is, but I did make some small adjustments. I did not blend the black beans, I just put them all in whole. I used a quarter less onion because it seemed like too much, and honestly I think half the onion would be better. You can definitely be heavy-handed with the spices here, or if you're good at flavouring things, add more. I kept it as is, and will probably add extra next time. I also added quinoa cooked in chicken broth and it made the soup even more filling but it would have been just fine without it.

Excellent soup! I had kale that needed to be used in the fridge so I chopped and added it to the onion in the pan. I love Worcestershire added to tomatoes and it was a good call in this soup. Soup should be a creative pot of leftover wonders. This recipe provides an excellent base to your creative powers!

I made some garlic bread for dipping into the soup it was fantastic! Thank you! I rate this soup 5 stars!

This soup is tasty!  I made it as is the first time and it was great, but a little too much liquid for my liking.  The second time around I used only about 2 cups of chicken broth and added an extra can of beans (three bean mix of pinto, kidney, and black bean).  I also added a can of green beans and used a bag of frozen mix of onion and mixed colors of bell peppers. Thanks for the recipe!!

Although I had my doubts before making this, it was delicious! I did add about 1/2 cup barley; otherwise made as directed. It was delicious! (I used the vegetable stock I had made from this site for the base.) Thanks for the recipe!

Awesome!! Thanks everyone for the suggestions.  Used 2.5 cups of broth instead of 4.  Used 2 tsp of cumin and 2.5 of chili powder.  Didn't add corn.  Used 1.5 cans of beans for puree and 1.5 cans of whole beans.  I can't stop eating...

Loved it, few changes, olive oil instead of vegetable, added 2 stalks of celery,used 2 1/2 cups of vegetable stock, 1 can of black beans(all I had) and 2 cans of black eye peas which 1 can I pureed to thicken the soup, chopped tomatoes instead of stewed. I don't like changing the recipes but had to go with what I had on hand.

My family really loves this. As per other reviews I only use about 2 cups of stock, and I add carrots and celery in the puree. We top it with crumbled tortilla chips and a little bit of melted monterrey jack cheese. YUM! Thanks DeeDee!

I made the 4 serving version and it was EXCELLENT.  The only thing I did extra was to add a stalk of diced celery when I added the corn.  This soup was plenty of thick.  You'll love it!

I also changed up a few of the ingredients, like two cups of the chicken broth, 3 garlic cloves, 3 cans of black beans (half in blender with stew tomatoes, and the other half put in soup as is), and half of the Fiesta can of corn.  It was wonderful...I would make it again and again.

This was really good!  I substituted 1/4 cup taco seasoning for the chili powder for a more taco soup taste.  I also only pureed half the tomatoes with the black beans.  I had a bit of rice leftover that I added with my bowl to see how it tasted.  It was really good!  We also ate it with tortilla chips.  Yummy!  Will make it again!

Can't count the number of times I have made this soup! My whole family loves it, including my picky 13 year old vegetarian daughter who tops her bowl with a generous helping of shredded cheese. By far the best meal in a bowl this winter! I do use all 4 cups of stock and don't find it watery at all in fact on re-heating I add a little more because it usually thickens. Thanks so much for a quick, easy and delicious recipe!

This was very yummy! I knew I wanted a thicker soup, so I made the following changes: I used 2-14.5 oz. cans of broth (I used chicken), and 3 cans of black beans (1-1/2 cans I kept whole and the other 1-1/2 cans I pureed with the stewed tomatoes). I also opted to use more garlic, upped the chili powder to 1 tablespoon and used a can of mexicorn instead of regular corn. We really enjoyed the flavors in this (even my little guy liked it). I think next time I may add a little something to spice it up a bit though, because for some reason I kept expecting a spiciness that just wasn't there, lol. Good recipe! Thanks for sharing. :)

Very delicious and easy! I made a few alterations to make it healthier and more to my tastes (I like spicy).  I used  dry beans and frozen corn to cut down on the sodium. I also added 2 jalapeno peppers and and extra tablespoon of chili powder. Even my meat obsessed roommate loved it!

This was so easy and so very delicious!  I substituted chicken broth for the vegetable broth, and canned whole tomatoes for the stewed tomatoes - both because they're what I had on hand.  I omitted the carrot because I don't care for them cooked.  Really great and I'll make again!

This was very good - I think next time I will add a little more cumin (because I like it).  I didn't have a food processor/blender so I couldn't really puree part of it properly (I used a handheld mixer).  

It was very filling and I served it with a little fat free sour cream - I am adding this to my recipe box.

I made it to the recipe until the end.  I added juice of half a lime and cilantro.  The next day i remembered the avocado i had bought and added it cubed.   It looked colorful and pretty with the yellow, orange, and green.  Right before serving, I added a slice of colby-jack cheese on top to melt.  I really prefer it with the avocado.  All in all a nice healthy soup.

As it is written, I found this recipe very  bland and thin.  I added more garlic, more chili powder, cayenne pepper, lime juice and 2 more cans of black beans just to get it closer to the flavor and consistency I am used to with black bean soup.  4 cups of stock was way too much.  Even doctored up, this was not what I am used to.

My wife and I have been searching for a healthy vegetable soup, and this one is it! The flavor is absolutely incredible, and I'm not a veggie person. It is a little watery at first, but if you let it reduce, it adds a nice thickness to the soup. The first tiem we made this was as directed. The second time, we added an additional can of beans (not pureed).  The third time, we added ground up turkey to bring the protein up. Adding a little bit of meat really changes the flavor for the better, plus it filled my need for some type of meat product. We've made this 4 times now, and we always double the recipe and store in plastic containers in the fridge for quick meals. Right now....my favorite soup.

This soup is really delicious and came together very quickly.  I substituted 2 3/4 cups cooked black beans for the canned ones.  Next time I will try frozen corn instead of canned as one of the other reviewers suggested to reduce the amount of sodium.  I prefer to add my own seasoning at the table to punch up the flavor.  By adding a squeeze of fresh lime and a bit of salsa into my bowl, I found that it perked right up without adding any additional salt.  I will definately be making this again.

I followed some suggestions - 3 cloves garlic, a couple pieces of celery, chicken broth for vegetable broth.  I subbed diced tomatoes with jalepenos for the stewed tomatoes.  That was a good idea, but maybe it could have used more.  I guess if you dress it up with toppings it's good; but if you don't, it's rather ordinary.  I didn't have cumin so that probably would improve the flavor.  I doubt I'll be making it again.

This was my first black bean soup experiment, and I must say it was an excellent one. I added the reccomended 3rd can of beans, celery, & a lot of extra garlic!! Definitely read the other reviews as (4) cups of stock is not neccesary, I used (1)14 oz can. The longer I cooked this the better it was. Try a sprinkle of chopped parsley as a garnish, Thank You DeeDee!!!

Very nice twist on ordinary veggie soup.  It was really good.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because, even though it is "vegetable" soup, I would have liked some chicken in it.(I did use chicken broth instead of vegetable stock)  To me that would make it a complete "meal" soup.  My husband loved it.  Thanks!

This is great soup.  I made it in the crockpot, instead, and it turned out beautifully!  So nutritious and healing -- the colors of the ingredients make for great presentation.

I have been making this soup for months now... I always make double the quantity so I can freeze some for an even quicker meal.  I also grate the carrots so they cook a bit quicker. The soup is not too spicy for the children that visit us - they like chili and spicy foods. I serve it with home made sour dough bread and a dollop of vegan sour 'cream'... delicious!

I didn't really care for this soup.  I expected it to be very good based on the reviews, but my husband and I ended up throwing it out and making something else.  It was very easy to make, but just not our taste.

This soup was wonderful. It was my first attempt at black bean soup, and what a result! Next time I would probably add a little more beans, corn, and carrots, because I like my soups chunky. Overall, a terrific soup!

A really good black bean soup recipe, almost more like a chili beacuse of the texture (thick).  I added an extra can of black beans to make it seem more like a black bean than chili soup--and a hot pepper for extra spiciness.

Delicious soup, definitely very flavorful. Read another ones review and will be using frozen bag of corn next time making it, so less sodium. I used 2 cloves garlic and 2 onions, but that was the only changes I made. I will definitely make it again.

Great recipe. I did however make a few minor changes the second time around.  I followed some other users advice and used less stock (used 3 cups)didn't use corn but instead used celery (used 2 stalks) added more garlic (used 5 cloves) I also squeezed half a lime and added a handful of cilantro. I garnished with tortilla chips.

Fantastic soup! There is so much you can do to mix it up! Very forgiving recipe, too. I ran out of chili powder so I omitted it and the cumin and used Penzey's fajita seasoning instead. Outstanding!

This recipe works well in the crock pot.  After sautéing the vegetables in a saucepan (I added celery to the recipe) I put everything to the crock as listed and cooked on low for 9 hours. The flavor was delicious and the veggies were very tender but not mushy. A great soup to come home to year round.

Cooked it as suggested for a guest who was vegetarian and it was a hit.  I will make it again even when there are no vegetarians in the house.  Put two dollops of natural yogurt on top just before serving and it really made the soup creamy.

I rate this between 3-4 stars. I thought it tasted best with some shredded white cheese I put on the top as a garnish. I  was sort of expecting more of a chili from the picture and the spices in the recipe. It was definitely more broth like, so it is titled correctly. Only change I made was using all low-sodium products. It didn't say to drain the corn, but I did that also. I love how healthy it appears, with the beans and all of the other vegetables. The best part is, it made a quick soup, with cabinet staples.

Great base recipe, here are my revisions. First, added diced celery, bell pepper, extra garlic and like others, doubled up on the cumin. Used frozen corn and ended up blending only 1/2 of the tomatoes, (we like it chunky). After blending the beans it was still too watery so I added what ended up being the whole package of my dried, cooked black beans. It was probably like 3-1/2 cans of beans. Superb! Very good, we will make this often. Healthy and economical. DH loved it!

I agree with other posts on this one!!! Excellent!  I followed some suggestions in reducing the broth, and I added meat to make it Vegetable Beef (although it doesnt' really need meat in it... hearty just as is!) , cooked it on slow cook mode all day.  The house was filled with great aroma's all day and dinner was great.  Doubled up the recipie and froze some for future quick meals.  Will keep in my Fall Recipie basket!

I made this recipe as written.   I found it to be bland and a thinner consistency than I was hoping for.  It's just OK - nothing to write home about. Probably won't make again.  Thanks anyway.

This soup is good,  better the second day, as many soups are.  The sweetness of the corn complimented the black beans well and I enjoyed having a thicker soup. . I cut back to 3 cups on the vegetable stock and added a can of Rotel tomatoes for a little extra heat and flavor.

I made this soup tonight for a soup swap tomorrow at work.  It is excellent.  I quadrupled the recipe but forgot to change the amount of black beans to puree.  So I pureed all but one can (instead of just half).  Because my soup pot wasn't big enough I ended up taking out some of the liquid before I added it.  So it is probably a bit thicker then the original recipe.

This was good and I would make it again using beef or chicken broth.  I did leave out the carrots as I don't like carrots with black beans.  I also did not puree the beans so the soup was thinner.  I probably shouldn't have added all 4 cups of stock.

I love this soup! And I'm not even very fond of bean soup, but this was so delicious. I made it exactly as the recipe calls for except I added a little salt to taste, and served topped with shredded cheddar and mozzarella cheese and sour cream. My whole family loved it, even my two-year-old. And it makes great leftovers!

This is really good! I used pinto beans since I ran out of black beans.  I think the black beans would have been better though.  I also used olive oil instead of veg oil and I added some diced celery.

Such a great vegetarian recipe!  I cut down on the stock by one cup like other reviews suggested and also add 1/2 cup of quick cook barley about 10 minutes before it's done, which really thickens it up into a stew and makes it even healthier.  I use diced green bell peppers instead of the carrots and frozen corn instead of canned.  My husband loves this.  I brought it to a potluck at work last week and it was a hit!  Everyone loved it and they all were surprised how good it was even though it was "vegetarian".  Will make this again and again!

This soup was very hearty and tasty! I wanted to make a larger portion, so I added a large sweet onion, chopped; two more cans of black beans; 1/2 cup of salsa; a little salt; and more cumin and chili powder. After reading some other reviews, I only used 1 can of chicken broth. This soup has some great flavor without being spicy. Thanks for the great recipe!

I liked this one.  When I make it next time I will add an extra can of beans to leave whole and I will up the spices and add salt.  This was an easy one to do thanks for sharing.

Yummm!!  We had this tonight with some cheddar cheese quesadillas, and it was a hit!  I didn't have any veggie stock, so I used 4 cups water + 4 chicken bouillon cubes.  I used 1 cup dried black beans, and didn't rinse/drain them after I finished soaking/cooking them.  I used 2 cloves garlic, but only 1 tsp chili powder (we're wusses).  It was THINNER than I thought it would be, but it wasn't watery at all!  Delish!

Yum.  I used this as a base to work off of... I didn't really measure stuff.  I used a can of black and a can of pinto since that's what I had and  I used tomato soup instead of stewed. I added chopped celery and I threw in a bit of salsa.  I will make this one again for sure.  Thanks!

Just made this soup. It was very good. Added lima beans and chicken along with other spices. It was clean eating. And the limas made it taste garden fresh with the frozen corn (2 varities). Hubby had two bowls. I spiced mine up by adding crushed reds.

I used ham broth and only used about half the amount called for. I shredded the carrots instead of dicing them, just for the consistency of it. I only had half the amount of corn on hand, but it was still very good!

This is a good black bean soup that has potential to be great! It could rival the soup of a local Mexican restaurant that I love with a few changes. I love veggies and added green pepper, celery and mushrooms as well. Don't skip sauteing, it adds to the flavor. I also used soaked, dried black beans, chicken stock and diced tomatoes, not stewed because that's what I had. I didn't puree the soup, but I used a potato masher to thicken it up a bit at the end. I added some hot sauce, but diced up jalapenos would also bring some good heat. I added some Worcestershire sauce too. The soup definitely needs to cook longer than 10-15 min. I just let it cook, stirring occasionally, until it was the nice thick consistency I was looking for. No need for cheese & sour cream if you let it cook and let the flavors meld. It is soooo yummy!

This is a very EASY recipe!  A hearty soup with lots of flavor and so good for you!  My husband loved it and could not believe there was no meat.  Per some of the tips here I increased the beans to three cans, added cilantro and two stalks celery diced, 1 T. minced garlic (instead of a clove).  Also used only 2.5 Cups of chicken broth for the liquid.  Excellent warmed up the next several days.  YUM will make again and again!

This one is going into the regular soup rotation.  It is so easy and everyone in my family asked for seconds!  I used four cans of beans to make it a little thicker and added fresh chopped cilantro.  Thanks for the easy buy tasty recipe!

This was delicious made as written, and could also be an easy soup to dress up by adding jalapenos, green chilies, or a variety of other ingredients.  I served it with tortilla chips, salted-avocado cubes, and sour cream.

Very good soup!  I made this as written and was worried that it would be too watery based on other reviews, but it was fine.  I simmered it a little longer and it thickened up a little.  I did add an extra teaspoon of cumin (personal preference).  A nice alternative to traditional black bean soup (which I also enjoy).  We will make this again.  We had it as an appetizer at dinner tonight and will have plenty for lunch the next couple of days too.  Even our 6-year old had some (she said 3 stars : ) ).

Delicious! I put in shredded chicken and used chicken broth instead of vegetable. I threw everything in the crockpot and let it simmer all day. It was so good topped with crushed tortilla chips, cheddar cheese and sour cream. It was a tad to runny so I would suggest decreasing the stock a little bit.

This was excellent. After reading the reviews about the soup being too watery, I made some small modifications. I added celery and green onions. Also, I used three cans of beans instead of two. I did use four cups of broth, but I gave the soup time to cool and thicken and reheated it when I was ready to serve. Loved it!

I followed the directions as given and the recipe was very "watery" and "bland". I read the reviews and should have made it according to the suggestions but thought I would try the original recipe first.

This was a fantastic soup! My husband and son (4 years old= picky eater) both loved it. It's also pretty easy to make. The only thing that I changed was I used 2 cups of vegetable stock and 2 of chicken stock and 1 cup of water (trying to avoid the saltly tasty!) Also we don't eat a lot of spicy food, so I only added a teaspoon of chili powder and added 1 teaspoon of paprika. At the end it was great! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I personally did not like this soup. However, I made it for my bf who LOVED it and that's what matters. He was raving about it and said the beans tasted like " little pieces of meat". Only thing I changed was adding a couple of pinches a red pepper flakes. I was told this was the best soup I've ever made and I've mad A LOT of soups from this website

This was fantastic. I did follow some of BMOMBS's modifications: 3 cloves garlic, lots of extra chili powder (I like it spicy!), 2.5 c veg broth, 2 stalks celery, 3 cans beans (1.5 in blender, 1.5 as whole beans), and fiesta corn. It was a bit spicy and a bit sweet and pretty filling. This will definitely be a regular recipe for me, thanks!

i'm a college student so i like easy and cheap meals, but when possible healthy is my #1 priority when it comes to eating and this fit all 3.  i added a zucchini, yellow squash and green pepper to the recipe.  it needed to cook a lot longer than it said.  more like 30-35 min simmer.  on the runny side, even though i only used approx 2 cups of broth, but a good mouth-feel all the same. i also added some crushed red pepper flakes and a few shakes of tabasco sauce with gave it just the right amount of heat.  topped with some reduced fat cheddar and fat-free plain yogurt.  was a bit timid adding the yogurt in as it's a bit sweeter than sour cream but it tasted great.

Served this soup with freshly baked bread and had a great meal. Next time, I plan to add a bit more flavor by increasing the chili powder.

This is easy to put together and super good.  As others suggested, I used about half the stock called for and added an extra can of whole beans plus some celery.  Served with sour cream.  Thoroughly enjoyed every bowl.

Love this! This is great like it is but I've also changed it up a few times by adding a shredded chicken breast or extra beans like pinto or kidney beans. I like to serve this topped with shredded cheddar and a dollop of plain yogurt. Thanks for the recipe!

I really liked the flavor and the ease of the recipe. Howver, I think it was much too saucy/soupy. I threw in a bit of rice and simmered it longer to make it a bit thicker. I liked it better that way. The second day (leftovers) added some cooked chicken.

This was really good for a vegetable soup!  I left out the carrots and added paprika, garlic powder and onion powder for more flavor and topped it with cheese and sour cream!

Super easy, and I used dried beans!  I liked all the colors in this soup, I added celery with the corn, and used chopped tomatoes instead of stewed.  Good on a winter's day, and I already had all the ingredients in my pantry.

Very good soup...quick and easy although it is definitely more of a vegetable soup (as the name implies) than a traditional black bean soup...i did find it to be a little watery for my taste...to alleviate this i added the black bean liquid (which i saved for some reason) which gave it a little more thickness and a more black beany feel...but i guess a flour/water mix could thicken as well...all in all very good soup...

very easy to make and tasty as well.  I also only used 2 cups of vegetable stock.  I increased the garlic and substituted kidney and garbanzo beans for black beans because I was all out.  A very versatile recipe that caters to whatever you have in your pantry!

Loved this soup! Added 1 extra cup of brown rice towards the end, as another reviewer suggested; it added a nice'meaty' texture. I will add an additional can of tomatoes next time (Rotel type) that doesn't get pureed. I think the addition of the tomatoes would be awesome. Freezes well, too. Just had some reheated and was just as good as the first time! Cornbread would be great with this, too!!

This was good, though I'm not convinced it's the best black bean soup recipe. I used two cloves of garlic instead of one, only 3 cups of broth (might cut it down more next time), zucchini, green pepper, and added 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper, 3/4 teaspoon ground black pepper, 1/2 teaspoon hot pepper sauce.  I might come back to this, but I'll try some other recipes first.

I did not like this at all - even after I added all of the ingredients, it didn't taste much different than just opening the can of black beans that I serve with tacos.  After following the recipe exactly and not being impressed, I added a few extra ingredients, and still wasn't thrilled.  Will not be making again.  Thanks anyway for sharing.

This was great!  I took other reviewers' suggestions and I used about 3 cups of chicken broth instead of veg stock.  I also added broccoli and cauliflower.  The soup still seemed thin, so I added an 8 oz. can of tomato sauce.  This is a great basic recipe!

I've experimented with lots of black bean soups and this one is definitely the best.  Be sure to use stock instead of broth.  It's one of those soups that is excellent the day you make it and the leftovers get even better.  Very good.

I never had Black Bean soup before but we are vegetarian and trying to find new recipes (sick of the same things every week). I put all the ingredients into my slow cooker at noon (two cans whole beans, 1 can we pureed in food processor with a can of roasted diced tomatoes), added two cups water and two vegetable brother bouillon cubes as reviewers suggested... sauteed onions and garlic in olive oil for about 5 mins before adding to crock. Added some chili flakes, cayenne pepper and some chopped red bell peppers, in addition to the listed ingredients. We were so suprised at how GOOD it turned out with tortilla chips as garnish and grated colby jack on top!! This is replacing chili in our "dinner rotation". Next time will be adding some minute rice near the end to thicken it up a little. Was just as excellent the next day for lunch. Thanks for the recipe!!!

I read a lot of reviewers recommendations on this recipe. Since I incorporated most of them and added one of my own, I am not sure that I am rating this recipe at all. This is what I changed: 2 C frozen corn, 3 T chili powder, 2 T cumin, 1 T cilantro, 2 cans stewed tomatoes (chopped), and some leftover brown rice.  However, the coup de gras was the 3 C of smoked pork broth. Serve with extra cilantro and lime wedges for topping. This is great served with simple quesadillas. Very awesome!!! I will try using some chicken broth and zucchini. This recipe is versatile, mix it up.

This was good, but didn't blow me away. I always use frozen corn instead of canned- the soup was a little watery IMO. Very healthy, though. Might want to add refried beans like others if you like it thicker & maybe some more spice.

Wonderful, wonderful recipe!  I have made it several times: once as directed, once with a small can of tomato paste, and once with 1 can tomato sauce.  We definately like it best with the tomato paste.  This gives a great tomato-y flavor without watering it down.  It was a perfect recipe while we were doing a "Daniel Fast" (mostly veggies, fruit & water).  Came out perfectly in a crock pot, and tasted great as leftovers.  The best part is you can throw in all kinds of veggies to make it more substantial.  I highly recommend!

This was great with a few minor changes!  I added 3 cloves of garlic, only used 3 cups of broth, and a 10oz can of diced tomatoes with chilis.  The biggest change was adding 3 to 4 tablespoons of tomato paste to give it more of a hearty chili taste!

This soup is absolutely delicious the way it is. I too like a thicker soup so add only 2 cups, I use water instead of stock and there is no flavor lacking!  Since I usually have all the ingredients in my pantry its my ace in the hole if I need a meal in a pinch. Serve with quesadillas-super yummy.  Thanks for sharing.

Whole family loved it. I was going to substitute garlic powder and then forgot to add it completely. Will add it next time and will increase the chili powder and cumin next time for more flavor. Will also reduce the amount of broth to make it thicker. Great recipe.

Wow this was GOOD, actually EXCELLENT!!   I like spicy, so I varied the chili powder to 1 tsp. Cayenne Pepper & 1 tsp. New Mexico Chili ... this fit the bill, my nose was runny!!  It was PERFECT!!!  Made me forget about the cold outside.  Heated up some Pita Bread and what a meal!! My family loved it.  I will definately be making this one again and again.

Very good! I prefer to make it more like a black bean chilli and add more beans and less stock. I put all the ingredients in the pot and partially blend with a hand blender.

Great recipe! This tastes just like the cajun black bean soup served at my favorite bread cafe nearby.   I make black bean soup every year for my Halloween party and had misplaced my usual recipe, so I tried this one.  Very tasty!  I used dry beans soaked over night to cut down on the sodium, and also added some leftover shredded pulled pork.  It's good with chicken or sausage as well.

As written it's only 3 stars...but with modifications, I'd give it 5!  I bumped up the amount of chili powder and cumin to 2 TB chili powder, and 1 TB cumin.  Also, I didnt use a food processor on the beans since I don't have one. Instead I drained them then mashed them with a potato masher and then added them to the soup, after adding the tomatoes which I also drained, reserving the liquid in case I needed more

Delicious recipe!  I made this per the instructions with only a couple of changes.  The pot I used was too small for all 4 cups of vegetable stock to go into it, so I only put 3 cups, and it turned out great.  I also added an additional clove of garlic.  The tomatoes I had were not stewed but were petite diced, and they turned out just fine.  I pureed the one can of beans with the tomatoes, and I really liked the results.  A really wonderful recipe that can be easily modified to fit anyone's taste.  Thanks so much!!

This was a very nice and easy soup. I made just a few adjustements. I added 3 carrots and 3 cloves of garlic. I also used homeade chicken stock and frozen corn. Using the frozen corn cuts down on the sodium. I also added a half of a green pepper and 1/2 tsp. oregano. I really like the carrot texture with the beans. Thanks!

We loved this soup!  I will definately make this again and again.  My boyfriend usually won't eat leftovers but he ate this for days.  The only change I made was substituting celery for corn.  Thanks!

Great recipe.  I used a hand blender to blend the onions, garlic, stock, tomatoes, and beans in the pot before adding the other ingredients.  The hand blender definitely cuts down on clean-up.

This soup is the best! Just finished making it and did a little additions. Added an extra can of black beans, groung beef, and chopped green pepper, and a little bit of diced green chiles. I'm very lucky, I have son-in-laws that will eat anything!

I took the advice of others and halved the vegtable stock and then added an extra can of beans. I also used a spicy salsa instead of the tomatos to give the soup more flavor. Instead of using a blender I just mashed some of the beans while it was simmering. On my first bit I thought it was a little bland still - but after adding tobasco, salt & pepper it was delicous!! Thanks for the great recipe!!!

Since some folks mentioned this could use a little kick, I pureed the beans with fresh hot salsa (from the deli case) instead of stewed tomatoes. The flavor was great.  I also added a cooked shredded chicken breast to make it a bit heartier.  Yum!  Looking forward to the leftovers.  Thanks!!

This definitely needed something. I chose it to make on Fridays because it had no meat - but wow, it really lacked. It was like chili gone wrong. We tried to eat the leftovers but they're still sitting in the fridge. We will not be making this again.

This was sooo yummy!!  Based on some of the other reviews, I added an extra can of black beans, used 3 cloves of garlic instead of one, and used 2 1/2 c chicken broth.  I also added extra chili powder and garnished it with cilantro...the cilantro especially made it taste great!!

Great taste, but thin, something missing. I like a thicker soup, so I added 1 stalk chopped celery and 3/4 cup rainbow radiatore pasta during the last 10-15 minutes of cooking (lid off), instead of adding another can of beans.  Used 1 can black beans and 1 can of kidney beans (mixed them together).  With my changes, I'd give it 5 stars and will definitely make it again!  Terrific with grated cheddar on top.  Thanks for recipe!

My husband and I really enjoyed this soup.  We agree it could us a bit more beans and veggies. We will follow other reviews recommendations for 'boosting' the soup. We added a dollop of sour cream for a little more richness and thickness.

Very filling for the amount of calories it has in it. I also served it broken pcs of tortilla chips on top of it. I have made it using the Basic Vegetable Stock recipe you have on this site and added boneless skinless chicken breasts to this stock & before adding the vegetables I boiled the chicken first in the water and skimmed off the scum that rose to the top of the water & then added the vegetables & 10 peppercorns to the chicken & water. Cooked it till the chicken was done about 30 min. Then I skimmed the fat off the surface of the broth before using it.

This was a good soup.  I used Knorr Caldo de Pollo instead of the vegetable broth, and I added a finely chopped jalapeno, as well as an extra teaspoon of chili powder.  It ended up quite fiery.  I will probably make this again.

Fantastic soup!  I used "hot" chili powder and found it a little too spicy for the kids though.  They otherwise liked it.  Next time I will decrease the chili a bit.

As everyone has been saying, this is very easy to make - work mainly consists of opening cans. I found I needed to cook the soup for about 10-15 minutes more to get the carrots nice and soft.

Made this tonight for supper.  For a dish that doesn't require a lot of preparation, it was quite tasty.  Followed the recipe as is, but since it was for supper, I served it over a mound of jasmine rice in the bowl.  There were no leftovers.

This was delicious.  I did use dried black beans, soaked them overnight and cooked to almost done.  Drained them added 2 1/2 cups chicken broth, skipped veggie broth, and the rest of the ingredients, plus a 1 tablespoon Mrs Dash and 2 teaspoon Tony Chachere's Original Creole Seasoning.

3 cloves of garlic, extra chili powder & cumin. added 2.5 cups of chicken broth instead of 4 cups of vegetable stock, added chopped celery (2 stalks) when I added the corn, and used 3 cans of beans instead of 2.  added a zucchini and about 2 or 3 T of chopped fresh cilantro; rice at end to make it thick.

Absolutely delicious. Adjusted as follows: added 2 celery stalks, chopped & cooked with the carrots, onion & about 4 cloves of fresh garlic. Also used 3 cans of beans-1 was kidney beans, and used only 2 cups of broth. Also added 1/2 green pepper for some extra spice. It's a winner!

I put a little less "spicy" in it because we cannot handle that much spice. I also put extra black beans in it because we like it a bit thicker. More veggies too. It was great

We loved it. I added a large stalk  of celery and an extra couple of cloves of garlic. I used chicken stock like some others and my wife absolutely loved it. Can't wait to have it again. The spices of cumin and chili add to the great flavor.  I used two heaping Tbsps of chili and 1 heaping Tbsp of cumin. Some people mentioned they would have used more beans.  I used two (2) 26.5 cans of beans (rinsed and drained.(just the right amount of beans for us ) and the full amount of liquid (chicken stock) 32 ozs.  The soup was not thick and had a nice soupy consistency.

This was tasty; a great combination of flavors!  I followed this recipe almost to a T... added to vegetable broth 1 cup of water with a chicken bouillon cube and since I didn't have two cans of black beans, I used one can of chick peas.

Great as written! My family liked it- including kids 8 and 3. Not spicy for them. If I were to make it for myself I would make it spicier, but this is great for all because it not boring without spice. ... This recipe will be easy to adapt. Add an extra can of beans in blender if you want it thicker. I may add a red bell pepper next time too.

Rating it 4 stars because as other reviewers suggested, 2 cups of vegetable stock does the trick; it would otherwise have been too watery. Also, if you're sensitive to spicy food, don't let the title of the recipe deter you. This isn't spicy in the least, which was kind of disappointing. But it tastes great!! Made as directed otherwise.

Turned out very nice, my family thoroughly enjoyed every last spoonful. My family are really big fans of meat and no one even questioned. 17 thumbs up. The only thing I did differently was add a teaspoon of shriacha just to give it a little kick. We like to cook with low sodium and organic ingredients. Great for the heart, mind and soul.

Everybody loved this soup the first time I made it! I didn't need to change anything! But,,, this is now my second time coming to this site to make this black bean soup again. I decided to add some green,red and yellow peppers. I threw in some jalapeños and also some petite diced tomatoes. For seasoning I decided to add some unsweetened cocoa because it's healthy and topped it with some sugar to taste. Regardless of my addings, as I said before, nothing is needed and this recipe was GREAT AS IS!

I like the versatility of this recipe because you can add whatever you like to it but as it is I think it is good but not great. I added some red pepper flakes and that is what made it work for me but hey, to each its own.

I made this soup according to the recipe, tasted, and then ended up adding an additional can of black beans and half again as much spices as originally called for.  It was good and was well received by two of the three people I served it to.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, DeeDee!

I have made this recipe many times. It's one of my favorites. I make the recipe as it but double the beans and I leave out the chili powder since I'm not a fan of that in general. I do add a little extra cumin however and I like to throw bell pepper in there too. I often serve with quesadillas. Everyone in my family loves this recipe as well.

Made this recipe as listed (with the addition of celery for some crunch) and LOVED it!  It does make a large amount, but it also freezes really well and keeps the same fresh taste when eaten later.  I just read other reviews about eating it with rice and might try that next time--I've never had a problem with it being watery, but I think it could make it a little more hearty for the cold months.

I made a few changes, first I added chicken, tomato paste instead of purée black beans and instead of vegetable stock I used chicken and Mexican tortilla. I top with cheddar cheese and sour cream. Delicious!

I used 1/2 onion, chicken stock,didnt add the tomatoes, and used mexicorn instead (little bit of peppers in it).  Forgot to puree a can of beans so I just scooped some of the whole misture into a blender and blended it.  Came out GREAT!! Loved it. Will def make it again. Only made about 4 servings.

I read many reviews and made this according to some of the directions for a thicker soup. We did eat this the day i made it but itcwas not spectacular enuf to be eaten again or made again. Next time i would rather use a crushed tomato base than put stewed tomatoes in the blender.

Loved this recipe. I made a few changes and it was delicious. Instead of carrots I used 1 can of French style green beans. I used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth since that's the only thing I had on hand. I added 1 (4oz.) can of green chilis and 1 can of enchilada sauce to make it more flavorful. I did not purée the beans or tomatoes and it was just as good. I will definitely make this again!

So good! And so flexible! I have skipped the tomatoes, and while not as good, it's still fine. You could add more garlic for sure, decrease beans if you wanted to, add other veggies. It's great! Love that it's partially-blended. I just used a hand-blender into the pot. Probably good with cheese on top too, with crusty bread on the side... I was just too hungry to try once I had it cooked!

Family liked it.  I did the 2 c. of vege broth but also used the liquid from two of the cans of black beans.  (I blended a 3rd can with a can of diced tomatoes).  I doubled the cumin, also.  Very good over rice!

This recipe is a great base soup. I took a lot of liberties with it. I added celery, a red bell pepper, and at least twice the garlic. Spice wise, I added coriander, basil, thyme & a bit of ginger (trust me!!). Last, and most important, sriracha and Worcestershire sauce.  Seriously, best soup ever.

Delicious! I took the advice of some other reviewers and used chicken stock instead of vegetable, frozen corn (I added a bit because I love corn), and an extra can of beans (a must if you want a really hearty soup). I also like having a little meat in my soup so I saluted a pound of ground turkey, crumbled it up and added that, too. It has a nice southwestern flavor and has just the right amount of kick. Definitely saved for the future - perfect winter soup recipe.

Pretty typical soup, nothing special. Thought it would turn out a little thicker, would definitely add more veggies & a little less veggie stock.

Added in some potatoes and zucchini. Used tomato sauce instead of stewed tomatoes. I did not bother to blend anything. Topped my bowl with a pinch of cheddar and dollop of sour cream. Results were delicious.

I found it was really bland so I made a few ajustments to it..I added franks red hot sauce(quite abit) uesd just under half can of black and kidney beans in the puree mix, and let it sit untill needed. then I through in some a green peper & yellow peper,and celery and then used extra virgin olive oil instead of vegtable oil. fried all the veggies together untill onions were Translucent. I used 2 tsp. of cumin and 3 tsp. of sea salt & fresh ground black peper. after I used chicken broth about four cups and and instead of just using black beans put in the remaining cans of organic black and kidney beans. then about 1 and a half cups of frozen corn (less sodium then canned corn) after i tampered around with the receipe it is now my favorate soup there is lots of left overs if feeding just 2 people I usually   freeze the rest for lunches ;)yum

This is a great recipe!!  I will definitely be making this again.  My children even liked it, and they are not big fans of any type of beans.  I added cilantro and celery to the recipe.  If you don't want it too soupy, you can always cut back on the stock, but it is delicious either way.  I also added a little shredded cheese blend on top of my bowl of soup, and we had cornbread with it.  Simply magnificent!

This is so good. The recipe "as is" is kind of watery.  I read some of the other top reviews for this specific recipe, and added the following in addition to what was above:

3 celery stalks (chopped)
1 tsp cumin
1 tsp of salt
1 tsp of pepper
1/2 a packet of sazon goya con azafran (just because I had it)

Soooo good. If you are looking for a meatless soup, this is it!

This soup was pretty tasty and not at all difficult to make. To try to make it even easier, instead of separating the one can of bens and the tomatoes, I cooked everything together and then used my immersion blender to partially puree the soup. Next time, I would reduce the amount of broth added, as many reviewers suggest and have done. My guess is that this soup will taste even better after sitting overnight. Garnished with a dollop of plain Greek yogurt, minced red and yellow peppers, and a sprinkle of chopped flat leaf parsley. Black bean  soup, in my opinion, is delicious but not too beautiful, so it needs to be prettied up a bit. Served with baked whole wheat pitas sprinkled with lemon pepper and seasoned salt and a romaine salad with avocadoes, oranges and red onion. Thanks!

Made this how it's written and with a few additions, both were amazing!  For my additions, I added green pepper, celery, and some coriander.  This soup is so good esp with a dollop of sour cream and some cheese on top!!

This was very tasty.  I would add a little more garlic next time, as we love garlic.  I added a dash of red pepper flakes and our homemade hot sauce to give it a little bit of a kick.  Served with a sprinkle of cheddar cheese on top and with a grilled cheese on the side it was the perfect meal for a cold rainy night.

I am a novice vegetarian cook and have just made this.  I loved it. It is absolutely delicious, but I did have to make a few changes due to not having carrots to hand and I did have to add more cumin and chilli but I guess that's to taste. I also added celery and a red and orange pepper. I also substituted the stewed tomatoes for tinned plum tomatoes. Yes it was watery but I just turned the heat up for a few minutes at the end and it soon thickened up. Would definitely make again and would highly recommend. Well done to Dee Dee.

This was tasty but it's like runny chili. Even with the stock reduction,  I felt like I was eating soupy chili. It had lovely flavor however!

I added a 1/2 can of coconut milk and my picky eaters loved it.  Yippee!  This recipe is also worth canning so that it can be enjoyed over a few weeks rather than a few days.  My daughter brings a homemade jar of soup to work every day and she is the envy of the office.

I followed the recipe, except for reducing the vegetable broth to 2 cups, as I wanted a thicker soup. I thought the soup was bland. I added an extra teaspoon of cumin, but didn't think it improved the flavor. I will keep searching for a black bean soup recipe.

I am not a huge fan of vegetable-style soups, but I thought I'd try this for something different. After reading many of the reviews, I added an extra can of black beans, but kept everything else true to the original recipe. After tasting the broth, I knew it would be too spicy for my husband, so I threw in some pasta. Overall, I thought the soup was OK, but not a favorite.

This needed lots of help for my palate.  Even with reveiwer suggestions.  I added more chili powder, more cumin, some chili seasoning, liquid smoke, cilantro, thyme, red bell pepper.  When I laddled it into the bowl, I added a spoonful of salsa and some sour cream and wah-lah!  Ate it with tortilla chips and it was fantastic.  Very good base recipe as submitted and one can tailor it to their taste.  Very satisfying.

a good and flavorful, easy and basic recipe with not a lot of work. I made this twice liked it fine both times. For simple soup, I enjoyed as is...the 2nd time I wanted it basically chunky by adding Gluten Free noodles and a few pieces of chunked turkey that I had left over from another meal. When you have already have these items as a staple in your pantry and frig the cost is a faction. Great end of the month stretch your dollar budget feeding your family on a rainy day...any day! UPDATED: 10/24/14 adding a protein such as Johnsonville Butcher Shop Style Cheddar Cheese & Bacon Smoked sausage to this wonderful recipe, just adds more depth and flavor. Was super good!

Yummy!  I made it just like the recipe, other than adding celery just because I had it on hand.  Sometimes serving sizes ate a little skimpy, and I wanted leftovers, so I made 1.5 (12 servings), and it made lots!  Not sure why people thought it was too much broth ... the bean/tomato purée thickens it perfectly.  My only negative comment would be that calling this "vegetable soup" is a little misleading ... this is much more a black bean soup, and a lovely one at that!

The first time I made this soup, I followed the recipe exactly, and it was wonderful! Since then, I've made it, adding whatever vegetables I have on hand, and it has quickly become one of my family's favorites. I always make a pan of pepper cornbread to serve with it - delicious!

Made as in and based on prior reviews added quinoa to thicken up the extra broth. Yum!

OMG my friends! this was a wonderful surprise! I've been speaking alot with a new friend at work who is a vegetarian and I proposed making this soup. Problem is when I finally got around to it I had no cumin! My friend is east Indian so I thought why not try yellow curry instead!? It is so wonderful!!!! I added the liquid form the corn and beans since the recipe didn't specify and I tell you this will forever be in my favorites!!! eat well my friends! :)

I love this recipe. I added diced celery and thinly sliced leek to my onion and carrot step. I made another change when I used one can of black beans and one can of white kidney beans - lots of fibre and a great contrast of colours in the soup. Finally, I added a half-cup or so of a blend of dry split peas, barley, and rice. Fantastic flavour and a hardy, satisfying soup. This is the secondpot I have made in a week. Enjoy!

Very good start. Of course I did some changes to account for what I had on hand. I used a frozen bag of mescaline mix which has onions, carrots, and celery and added 3 whole cloves of garlic and then blended that with the toms. I didn't have corn so I used 3 cans of beans total. I did 2 cups of homemade bouillon but that wasn't enough liquid so I ended up adding another cup water. I used 2tea of chipolte instead of chili and it was too spicy (but still good). This was the only downfall of the soup. Next time I will cut it to 1 or less. I served it in homemade bread bowls.

Absolutely delicious! I will be scaling this recipe up next time so that I have lots to freeze. I must admit that I just had to add a teaspoon of ground cayenne pepper to the recipe. I certainly would not change anything else.

Delicious soup. I took others advice and only added 3cups of liquid. I used canned chicken stock, instead of vegetable stock.

Rarely do I take the time to review a recipe, but this recipe is just SO DELICIOUS! I made it exactly as written, and while it was a little watery, my husband and I enjoyed it immensely! Next time I would double the recipe, but with less liquid...I loved that you didn't need to add any additional salt! Thank you for a great meal on a rainy night!

Made this as called for with the exception of using chicken stock instead of vegetable because that's all I had on hand.  Quite a bit of work, chopping and pureeing, but well worth the effort.  Won't change a thing next time around.  A definite keeper -- thanks, DeeDee!

My whole family really enjoyed this soup! I only used 1 can each of vegetable stock, black beans, corn, and tomatoes with green chilies and that was enough for 5 servings. Will definitely be making again!

Delicious! I sauteed red and green bell peppers with the onion and garlic. As per other reviews, I reduced the veg stock to 2 cups, added fresh cilantro and thyme, and also some lemon juice. A dash of worcestershire sauce, some shredded cheese, and a dallop of sour cream really made the flavors pop! Even my meat-and-potato family asked for seconds!

Followed recipe exactly: Turned out ok, better the next day as the flavors had developed a bit more.  The base of the recipe is good, but needs more spices for my tastes.

I actually "crave" this soup. I thought I liked the traditional black bean soup until I tried this fantastic recipe! The only thing I did was to add more beans,carrots,and corn. It is cold and bleak out today, and I am going to make this soup now. Yum!!
Update 8/9/12 made this soup today as I was cleaning out the fridge, and pantry which caused me to add 1/2 small cabbage chopped, and three small red potatoes peeled and chopped. Beef broth instead of vegetable stock.                    Absolutely wonderful  !!! It freezes well also.

Great base recipe.  I added more veggies though...carrots, celery, leeks...and I cut the vegetable stock to 2.5 cups.  I also added leftover spiral ham.  Turned out awesome.  Made a big pot in which I thought the two of us would have leftovers for the weekend, but we ate it all!

Pretty yummy & hearty soup. I did make some amendments as suggest by previous reviewers and I think without them, it wouldn't have been nearly as good. I added a can of refried beans so I wouldn't have to deal with blending beans together + extra chili powder and less broth. It's super easy to make and cheap. :)

This is a nice warm meal for autumn or winter.  It is easy to just throw in however much of each ingredient that you want in this soup.  My husband and I enjoyed it with cooked rice added in at the end, too.

This was fantastic! I didn't have stewed tomatoes so I used a small can of tomato paste, the stock and half the beans to make the liquid part, and it turned out wonderfully. It is packed with flavor. Will definitely make again.

Absolutely delicious!  I wanted a really thick soup so I used just one can of chicken broth and added one can pinto beans, zucchini and celery.  I used low sodium broth and no salt stewed tomatoes and increased the amount of chili and cumin so I didn't have to add salt.

This is a good vegan bean soup.  I did add some shallots and green pepper (since I had them on hand).  It also reheated very well.

This was really good and Healthy! I made a few changes bec of what I had on hand. I used chicken broth 2 cups, more garlic, 1 tea more of cumin and used 10 oz. of diced tom w lime and cilantro unblended and 10 oz. of tom w green chilies blended. Ground beef can be added to make it a meal but it was filling as is.

Delicious soup, especially on a cold, rainy day.  I tend not to measure and made a few changes to meet my tastes - 3 cloves garlic, 2-3 tsp cumin (love cumin!!!), frozen corn, chopped bell peppers (1/4 c), and roasted tomatoes with chili peppers instead of stewed to give it a little extra spice.  First and second time used 2 1/2 c broth and it was a nice medium thick consistency.  Definitely serve with a dollop of sour cream, chopped frozen or fresh cilantro, and diced avocados.  Great with quesadillas or burittos and a tropical smoothie or chopped fresh pineapple.

I have made this once a week for the past 5 weeks and while I love it as is I have made a few changes to fit my tastes a little better. When I make this I double the amount of garlic, carrots, spices and corn. I use 2 cups of chicken broth and 1 8oz can of jalepeno tomotao sauce. It adds some heat to the soup. I also use Italian style stewed tomatoes and break up the chunks with a spoon. I serve it with a little sour cream and some shredded cheese. Yummy.

This had a real Mexican taste to it.  Very, very good.  The soup reduces and thickens as it cooks, so 3 or 4 cups of stock is good.  Very easy to make.  It's better if carrots are sliced thin, or chopped small.

Everyone enjoyed this.  Easy.  Nice Flavor.  Not thick and hearty like a typical bean soup, more of a broth.

Very tasty.  I'm not good about leftovers but this is the one soup that I eat every bit of it.  I listened to advice in other reviews.  I add more chili powder and garlic.  I add green peppers and celery.  I also prefer to use chicken stock though closer to 3-3.5 cups.  I use 3 cans of been.  The tomatoes don't need to be stewed because honestly they just get pureed anyways.  I have used diced.  After it's cooked I like to top mine with tortilla chips and shredded cheese.  Wonderful soup and easy to make.

Delicious! I used a 12oz bag of frozen corn (because I love corn!) but followed the rest of the recipe as written. It was very good, and made a lot of leftovers. Definitely going in my rotating queue of dinners!

This soup is excellent. Spicy if you like. Adjusted based on reviewer comments. Used produce on hand:  celery, extra carrots, 2 med. red potatoes, green beans, frozen green peas, chayote squash, etc,)  I only had one can of black beans for soup. Pureed can of pinto beans. I actually used Ranch Pinto Beans with jalapeno. Spicy is a 9/10 scale. With only a couple jalapenos, 5/10 (for the weak, probably a 10/10.  Used whatever tomato stuff I had (2 Jenny Craig tomato soup).  Like others, I used chicken broth. Healthy, filling and delicious. Thank you DeeDee!

This was a good base but I felt tlike it needed lots of adjustments in the end.  I added an extra can of tomatoes.  I only pureed 1 can of beans.  After it cooked for a couple hours it was just so bland.  I added an envelope of chili seasoning and it was so much better.  I also added a spoonful of fat free sour cream to my bowl and it came out better still.  Probably won't make again.

Great!  Added an extra can of black beans (not pureed) to the soup, plus 1 cup of rice.  The rice obviously took care of the excess liquid some complained about ~ mine was nice and thick.  A dollop of sour cream in each bowl was an extra bonus.  Surprisingly, my husband said it was good the way it was and didn't need meat!  Wow!

4 starts because we did make some changes to the original version. Added another can of tomatoes, turkey sausage, and cumin. It made it more hearty!

Edit: The next time I pureed red beans bc I only had one can of black beans. Added a pinch of sugar, celery and it was deliciouso!

Very delicious!  Made as directed except I used tomatoes with green chiles, added 1 cup of rice, 1 tsp cilantro and juice from half a lemon (didn't have a lime).  Just enough heat to give it flavor but not overpower the other ingredients.  Served with cornbread.  Great for this snowy winter day.

Flavor was fantastic, but like other reviewers, the next time I make it (and there WILL be a next time), I would definitely add another can of beans and perhaps even some petite diced tomatoes, both drained but not "blended", and decrease the amount of broth, as we like a thicker soup.  For your meat lovers, you could also add some ground beef or turkey for a black bean chili.

Great flavor, super easy! I agree with all the previous comments.  Only thing I added was tortilla strips  and cilantro because it reminded me of a tortilla soup without the chicken.Might try adding chipotle peppers for an extra kick next time!

I make a very similar version of this soup, but instead of using stewed tomatoes I use salsa to puree with the beans. Also, I put the beans, salsa and some of the broth in a blender; the broth makes it much thinner and easier to blend, you can just pour the soup out. You can't go wrong with this soup. Other things you can put in the soup or top it with are cilantro, jalepenos, green chiles, cheese, sour cream or diced chile tomatoes.

This was a great soup. I had to use frozen corn and canned carrots and diced tomatoes. Great soup for lunch.

So good and healthy! I used fat free chicken stock and only 2.5 cups of it. I also added fresh cilantro, a can of garbanzo beans, 2.5tsp of cumin and chili powder, and 1/8tsp of cayenne pepper. To thicken it, i used 1 can of pumpkin. The cilantro does the trick! Next time i might add some fresh parsley as well.

This was delicious.  However not enough vegtables so I added some rice and garbanazo beans as that is all I had.  Next time I would add celery an zuchini.

It was pretty good.  I had to add extra seasonings, as it didn't have enough flavor.  So I put in salt, extra cumin and garlic powder.  I did use less stock than called for.  I put in a tiny bit of diced zucchini that my husband said he could taste--liar.  And thought it could have more vegetables added for more nutrients if wanted to: celeray, peppers, green chili, squash, cauliflower...

YUM! only change was to use 3 garlic cloves and add some smoked chipotle seasoning. Served with brown rice and topped with cilantro, avocado slices, shredded cheese, and sour cream. Can't wait to eat the leftovers tonight!

This soup is a staple in my house.  I make big batches and freeze the servings.  I also like to add garlic salt, onion powder and cilantro to it.  I also cut the vegetable stock from 4 cups to just 2 cups.

This recipe is wonderful! A perfect base recipe. The first time I made it I followed the suggestions of less broth and 3 cans of beans. I just finished my second try and this one is phenomenal! I used my mini chopper to chop the carrots and onion, then blended fresh tomatoes and jaleno from my garden along with a massive handful of fresh cilantro. Holy Moley do I think the cilantro is a must! Wow! What a great flavor! I used 4 C chicken broth and threw a chicken breast in there and shredded it into the soup. I kinda like the brothy texture so it worked well with 4 cups broth. I pureed 1 can beans and threw in 2 cans whole. Great recipe to tweak with your own flavors and level of heat. Great with cheese, sour cream, and crushed tortilla strips on top....cornbread on the side!

I wouldnt make this again unless I changed the recipe to thicken the soup and add more flavor.  I made corn bread with the soup, which helped to thicken it and add flavor but I'd like the soup to be good on it's own.

I did not care for this.  I thought the carrots added an odd flavor to what tastes more like a chili than a vegetable soup.

Perfect no-worries recipe to commit to memory. Taking other reviewers' comments into consideration: doubled the garlic and cumin, and used 1 can chicken broth. Use pureed tomatoes instead, and when all is soft and cooked, add a little cream (!) and use an immersion blender for a few zaps until it has the consistency you want. I imagine a little yogurt or sour cream would also do the trick. Add thawed frozen corn at the very end and heat through. Serve with chopped cilantro and green onions and grated monterray jack cheese. Nummy!

THis was delicious and super healthy! Reading over previous posts I only added 2 cans of vegetable stock and added 3 cans of black beans. I still found it a little runny, so next time I think I'll do 1 can of vegetable stock and maybe a 4th can of black beans. I like my black bean soup a little thicker.  I also added celery and 2t of cumin and chili pepper. It's also yummy served over alittle rice!

Amazing!  So hearty!  i followed the recipe exactly and it turned out fabulous!  I know some reviewers commented that it was a little too watery; I simmered mine for 2 hours or so but perhaps it was not watery because my cans of beans were 19 ounce instead of 15 ounce each?  Regardless, you must try this!

Good...made exactly as written.  I had the luxury of letting it simmer for a few hours which thicken the soup nicely.  It would have been too thin otherwise.

Simple, cheap and delicious. I added in some celery and a bit more cumin (also cut the stock to 3 c.) and it came out perfectly. We made a huge pot, cooked up some brown rice, and then ladled soup over the rice in each bowl. It gave it almost a stew feel to it. Will definitely have again!

I made this soup for dinner last night! And it was really easy for me to follow and it turned out to be yummy. I did add 1 cup of Mahatma rice to make it a little thicker. The flavor was perfect! I could have eaten it with or with out the rice. This was just what my family was wanting. A yummy black bean soup!

This one was just ok for me.  I certainly didn't dislike it but I don't think that I will be making it again.  It tasted like a canned soup to me, I think it was from just opening the cans and dumping it in.  The only change I made was to not puree the beans.  If you are looking for something super quick and easy this wouldn't be a bad choice if you had everything in the house, but I wouldn't go out of your way to make this.

I made this soup with added zucchini and slices of winter squash and it turned out GREAT!  I used a can of pinto beans to process with the stewed tomatoes because I only had one can of black beans.  I served it with toasted butter/garlic bread and my boyfriend and I LOVED it!

This was easy to make, filling, economical, and nutritious! It took me kind of a long time to chop all the veggies, so I would not cook this if I were in a hurry, but the actual cook time is pretty quick. I did use three cans of low-sodium black beans instead of 2, and added half a can of kidney beans (leftover from cooking the other night) as well as two stalks of celery and half a green bell pepper. I also used 2 cups of vegetable stock instead of 4 and served this over rice. My bowl included sour cream, and it was yummy! Everybody enjoyed it, including my 1 year old.

I loved this recipe.  I only had one can of black beans in my kitchen, so I used a can of rinsed pinto beans to puree with the tomatoes.  I also added some cilantro, I feel like it needed it.  When I make this again I will use three cans of black beans, one to puree and two to add to the soup.  YUM!

This was quick and easy to make. I needed to add additional seasonings (salt, more cumin, etc) as my blackbeans and tomatoes were all no salt added, making the dish somewhat bland. I also used 1 cup less broth per other reviews. We topped it with cheese and sour cream and it was very good.

This was so quick and easy to make and very delicious! My 4 kids don't usually like what they determine to be "spicy" foods so I braced myself for complaints.  I was amazed when instead of complaining they asked for seconds.  The entire family LOVED this recipe and we will definately use it over and over again!!

VERY good black bean soup!!! Here are my suggestions after trying a few times: Add 2-3 chopped celery stalks with the onion and garlic, add extra garlic, puree carrots with the black bean/tomato puree (if you don't like cooked carrots), add a couple beef bouillion cubes (I used vegetable broth but added the cubes for extra flavor, if this dish doesn't HAVE to be vegetarian),I also used the can of corn with peppers in it, AND add some tabasco sauce if you want some kick! I served with shredded mozz cheese and mini mexican cornbread muffins I made... DELICIOUS!!!

This soup is delish!! It's a versatile recipe, you can use any vegetables you have around the house and it will still turn out great. I added a zucchini and an orang pepper. Yum!

This was quite tasty. My husband LOVED it, my toddler didn't love it but liked it (I can tell but how fast he eats it LOL). I thought it was nice comfort food, it went great with fresh baguette dipped in the soup. I wanted a thicker consistency so the soup would "stick" to the spoon for my toddler, so I used 3 cups of broth and blended 1.5 cans of black beans and left .5 can of black bean unblended. I gave it 4 stars because of son's like instead of love.

Loved this soup.  I added zucchini instead of carrots because it's what I had on hand, and some cumin for more flavoring, but otherwise kept the recipe the same.  Was great on its own, and put it over rice the next day for a heartier stew.  Fantastic!

SO good.  Reminds me of the veggie soup my grandma made when I was a kid.  It's so tasty and filling.  I added cooked cabbage, sweet peas, and small red potatoes.  YUMMMMM.

When I first saw this recipe, I didn't think it would be very good.  But, I thought that I needed a soup that was different from any I have ever made and I have been feeling a bit lazy...and this was sooooo easy to make.    I was totally shocked at the taste!!!  It is soooooo amazingly good!  Thanks for this recipe.  I did top each bowl with shredded Cheddar Jack cheese and tortilla chips on the side.  Thank you for sharing this recipe with me!

This was really good and simple.  I did use only 2 cups chicken broth, 2 cans of black beans and a can of refried black beans with lime.  I did have to thicken it up a bit (my preference) with a little corn starch.  Great the first nite even better the next day.  Thanks.

I loved it! I did make a couple of changes though (sorry!). I followed other's advice and halfed the stock (used chicken b/c that's what I had) and I halved the chili powder b/c 2 tsps seemed like too much. I couldn't get enough of it and almost ate the whole batch!

this soup is excellent.  kid, baby, and husband all love it.  i use only 3 cups of broth, and i add a tablespoon or so of flour when i add the chili powder and cumin to help thicken it a little.  i also add a little extra chili powder and cumin.  this gives it just enough flavor for my family, but if you want it spicy, you'll definitely need to add more.  i serve it with a dollop of sour cream and a sprinkle of shredded cheese.

I am on this huge soup kick and I was looking for something that was low cal and had black beans in it. This is a great soup that tastes just like a taco soup with a fraction of the calories. I didnt put any meat in it but I did put some small pasta noodles in it. Delicious!!!

This was SOOOO good.  I made a couple of changes.  I added a can of refried black beans along with the beans, just for fun.  Also, instead of the seasonings in the recipe, I used Mrs. Dash Southwest Chipotle seasoning.  It added some heat and some smokiness.  Mmmmmm, I definitely recommend it!

This was very good with a few additions.  Like other folks, I added an additional can of black beans, a total of two cloves of garlic, and a half a jar of pace picante sauce.  Yummy!

Delicious!!  This is a great recipe that you can alter to fit your taste.  Used 2 cups low sodium chicken stock. I just happened to have yellow and red peppers on hand so I threw in some.  Also per suggestions I added cilantro and green chilies and topped it off with greek yoghurt since I did not have any sour cream.  I will definitely make this again.  Leftovers make a great quick lunch.

I made this recipe with a few variations. I used 2 (not 4) cups of BEEF stock, and I added 1 lb. browned ground beef. At the end, instead of stewed tomatoes, I used Rotel-style tomatoes with chilies to puree with the second can of black beans. Spicy and delicious!

I made this recipe because my family loves black beans, but it was pretty tasteless and not quite the consistancy that I like in a soup.  I won't be making this again unless I make some major changes.

The taste of this was probably a 4, but because the ingredients are so healthy, I think it deserves a 5.  Next time I am going to add cilantro and sour cream.  Thanks!
Revised:  Made again...With cilantro and sour cream taste is a definite 5.

This is a really great basic starter recipe , a great place to start from. I messed around with the portions a little bit to get a thicker soup, made a few mistakes, used fire roasted tomatoes, and added jalapeños and celery to the mix. My guests loved it and my roommate and boyfriend were begging for more. 

Great base with tons of possibilities!

Excellent tasting healthy soup!  I agree with the previous reviews and would recommend that you decrease the stock to 3 cups or even 2.5 cups for a thicker soup.  Plus, cilantro adds a nice touch!

I gave this recipe a five-star rating after I added some spice.  This is an excellent for base for black bean soup.  You can definitely play around with it to suit your tastes.  I followed the advice of another cook and added some worsteshire sauce and a healthy dash of balsamic vinegar.  I was weary of the vinegar at first, but it really adds a nice 'zip' without the apparent taste of the vinegar.  I definitely doubled or tripled the amount of cumin and chili powder and used cayenne pepper instead of red pepper flakes.  I just kept adding it as it cooked so I didn't make it too hot in the beginning.  I also used 3 cloves of garlic and even added more garlic powder during the simmering or the soup as well as an extra carrot.  The soup turned out great, not too runny and pleasantly creamy.  I ate mine with blue corn tortilla chips while my brother loaded shreadded cheddar and sour cream with tortilla strips on top of his soup!  Thanks for this great, healthy recipe.

This turned out just as I hoped.  I don't think carrots are necessary for this recipe and I won't use them next time.  I also added 1/2 diced red bell pepper for extra flavor. The amount of spice was perfect for this soup.

Great and easy to make.  A hit with the whole family (even my two year old).  The only change was to add a little more beans, cumin and garlic.

This recipe was quite good.  Although I had to make a few changes to give more of a long-cooked soup taste.  I added about four celery stalks and 10 oz. of frozen spinach while sauteeing the onions/garlic, used 2.5 cups of water and 3 tsp of beef bouillion instead of the vegetable broth, put in an additional can of whole black beans, added some dried thyme and rosemary, and some worcestershire, habanero tabasco, cayenne pepper, and balsamic vinegar.  After all these changes (I kept adding ingredients until it tasted right to me), it turned out to be a FANTASTIC soup.  I served it with chipotle tabasco and mozzarella cheese.  I would highly recommend these changes!!

Wonderful and easy. I always use three cans of beans and a bit less broth than the recipe calls for. Perfect with diced avocado and/or fresh salsa on top. Thanks for the recipe!

This soup was so simple and delicious.  I really didn't think it would have as much flavor as it did.  I did add extra cumin and also added a can of diced green chiles.  Next time I will definitely add another can of black beans.  This is a keeper!

Very good, easy, inexpensive; I used low sodium chicken broth for added flavor, but otherwise followed the recipe.  I feel that it's missing something, but as I don't have a lot of experience with this style of cooking, I can't identify what it needs.  Right amount of spices, I added salt.  I would make this again, but probably add cilantro as others have, and reduce the amount of broth.

This soup was delicious - I was SO sorry when it was gone.  It is very easy to modify according to the ingredients you have on hand.  Garnish with a bit of grated cheese and you have a filling and yummy dish for a cold winter's night.

Great taste and texture.  We used dry beans that we cooked rather than canned beans.  We also divided the soup and kept it in the freezer for quick meals.  Freezing worked wonderfully.

This was delish! The only changes I made were I used a 15 oz. can low-so chicken broth (in place of 4 cups veg stock) and I used a can of diced tomatoes with zesty mild green chilies in place of stewed. My superpicky 4-year-old even ate it (of course I had to strain out the chunks for him) and said it made his tongue tingle.

This recipe was so easy. I used a 28oz can of stewed tomatoes and 2 19oz black beans instead of the smaller cans recommended in the recipe. I also added a splash of red wine vinegar and some more veggies(celery and spinach.)This was a hearty meal and quick to make. No soaking! The kids even liked it; especially with a dollop of sour cream.

This soup was really good but I made a bunch of changes.  I didn't have any carrots so I omitted them.  I divided the recipe in half.  I didn't puree the tomatoes and black beans since I was feeling lazy. I used fresh tomatoes and frozen corn.  Also I added salt.  It finished really fast and my husband absolutely loved it.

This recipe was delicious as is and does not require any  changes.  My wife loved it even though it is meatless.

I used a larger can of corn (11 oz corn w/sweet peppers) and 2 14.5 oz cans of vegetable broth.  Other than that, I followed the recipe as indicated and it turned out delicious.

Yummy!  I read the reviews, and increased the garlic and spices (we like it spicy here in California), added a diced red pepper, a big pinch of salt and sugar, and finished it with a squeeze of lime juice.  Also, try adding some bottled salsa to the tomatoes before you puree them with the can of beans.  Excellent -- this one is a keeper.

This recipe inspired me.  I added a box of instant refried black beans from Fantastic Foods to 4 cups of boiling water (following a similar soup recipe on the package) along with rinsed and drained canned black beans, canned diced green chiles, canned sliced ripe olives, jarred salsa, frozen sweet corn, seasoned rice wine vinegar and ground cumin.  I served it with a dollop of sour cream and a drizzle of salsa.  You could pass diced avocado and crushed tortilla chips and shredded cheese and stand back.  It was that good. Many thanks, Dee Dee!

This was really good, I made a few adjustemtns by adding cayenne pepper for some heat, and some noodles to the broth. I loved the texture of the tomatoes and black beans. I used stewed tomatoes, so it didn't take long in the blender. Will probably make again.

I thought this recipe was excellent. To give it some kick I added a little can of Hatch Hot chopped Green Chilis during the puree stage. I also used 3 garlic cloves,chopped up some baby carrots instead of 2 regular ones, and used 3 cans of beans (1 pureed/2 regular). My boyfriend who is a big meat eater even enjoyed this soup. This recipe is a keeper.

Tasty and healthy.  I usually make this soup on a weekly basis and the entire family loves it.  I have added two stalks of chopped celery for some extra crunch and use super sweet corn to offset the spice in the soup.  **UPDATE**A wonderful change I did the other day was to add smoked corn.  This summer I hickory smoked several dozen ears of corn in the husk on the smoker after soaking for an hour in water.  I cut the kernals off and froze in quart bags.  Unbelieveable taste!

Tasty variation on vegetable soup, especially for folks like me who aren't crazy about a heavy tomato base.

I have searched and searched for black bean soup recipes and all have turned out too bland.
This was PERFECT!  I added a dollup of sour cream on top.

good soup, although I find that olive oil tastes better, and instead of 1 ts of cumin, a whole tablespoon gives it a nice kick. Some tabasco or chipotle sauce also makes it extra yummy.

Nice and easy - prepared it, then put it in the slow cooker for 6 hours.  Used extra can of beans, and 20oz of chicken broth.  Served with quesadillas, cheese and sour cream.  A definate keeper.

Loved this!  I kept putting a small bowl of soup out to cool so I could taste it and my husband kept eating it before I could get to it.  Followed the recipe exactly, except for reducing stock to 3 cups, adding a can of beans, and simmering for at least 30 minutes.

All things considered, this may be one of the best recipes on this website.  It's very easy, economical, nutritious, fast, and delicious.  I made it exactly as written the first time (except doubled it) and it was great.  The second time I made it with chicken broth and it was great again.  Next time I might add some ham.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Excellent!  I followed the advice of other reviewers and cut the broth to 3 cups and added a can of beans.  I also added a splash or two of hot sauce.  It was very good.  I can't wait to have it for lunch tomorrow.  Thanks, DeeDee!

This is quick and tasty!  I used water with some additional salt (was out of veggie broth and needed it to be a "lenten" meal) and added a bit of powdered habanera pepper.  I didn't drain or rinse the beans and didn't puree anything either.  My hubby really enjoyed this for lunch.

Quick, easy, healthy, and good!  Like other reviewers I found it a little watery, even though I reduced the stock to 3 cups.  To make it thicker I pureed some of the onion/bean/corn mixture in the pot with the second can of beans.  I also added green peppers and carrots because I like a chunky soup with lots of vegetables.  Next time I'll add some celery too.

This soup was awesome!   Like others, I added an extra can of black beans.  I, too, also added celery and chopped cilantro.  Next time I might drop in a chopped jalapeño for added kick (this recipe was not at all spicey on it's own).

After a day, the consistancy came out perfect - not too watery and not too thick.  Perfect.  This soup is awesome and is really darn easy to make.

I've made this soup a number of times now and have passed on the recipe to a number of people at work who wanted to know what smelled sooo good when I brought the soup to work for lunch. I made a few changes: I puree 2 cans of black beans with the can of tomatoes as I found 1 can did not make it thick enough, I omit the carrot (personal pref), use about 3 cloves of garlic and use about 3x the cumin for the flavor. This is an excellent recipe - great with a little sour cream and corn chips!

This soup is delicious!  And quick and easy to put together.  I used one extra can of beans (blended) as suggested for a thicker consistency  and Gebhard's Chili Powder which has other spices that really complimented the soup.  My hubby had never had black beans before and he loves it!  Some crushed tortilla chips would be a nice addition if you have some in the house!  This will be a winter favorite for us!

Excellent and easy! I used beef broth instead of vegetable and simmered it most of the day. Can use less stock for a thicker soup, which I prefer. I served it with Jasmine rice. Our 11 yr old ate 2 bowls and I had 3 bowls myself.
I use 3 cans of beans, puree 1 1/2, and use "Roasted Garlic" stewed tomatoes. If I have leftover meat (beef, chicken or our favorite, ham) then I chop it and add it to this soup

This is a very good soup, easy and quick.  Blending the beans and tomatoes made the juice in the soup very rich tasting and worth the small effort. I am so happy to have leftovers tomorrow. Friday night and supper is already prepared, who could ask for more. Thanks DeeDee.

Excellent soup. I made some minor adjustments: I used 3 cans of vegetable broth (didn't measure out cups), and 3 cans of beans-- pureed one can with stewed tomatoes as suggested. Otherwise, I followed everything pretty much to the letter, except with the spices-- I used about 2 tablespoons chili powder and cumin, and also added lots of black pepper, red pepper, and some garlic salt. The soup really is great-- spicy and filling, it was my first homemade soup effort and totally worth it, I will definitely make it again. I would suggest blending the one can of beans with the tomatoes as that provides the soup with some body, I would imagine it would otherwise be very thin. Next time I will add additional veggies for sure, though everything listed here worked quite well. Thanks, Deedee!

Great soup without the vegetable broth.  Instead I added all the ingredients with their juices & soup was a great, thick consistency.  I served it over rice topped with sour cream, co-jack cheese, scallions & with whole wheat tortillas.  Very yummy!

If you like chili, you'll like this soup. I like the soup, and it was not too spicy for my two-year-old (we live in San Diego and she is used to Mexican food, so I wouldn't give this to any two-year-old, but I didn't find it spicy at all) My husband loves black bean soup normally, but he doesn't like chili, so he wasn't crazy about this soup.

A great recipe. However, being a non-can fan I use the dry beans (soaked overnight and then boiled separately next day). Then used according to the recipe. Improves the flavor very much, in my opinion.

A few weeks ago I decided to cook for my vegatarian mom for Christmas, since she already has everything.  Of course my first stop in collecting recipes was All Recipes.  Out of all of the selections that I made this is the best!!!!  We are not big fans of chili powder so I used cayenne pepper and only 1.5 tsp, but my husband loves this!!!  Said it is perfect to make him feel better when he has a cold!!!  Thanks for the great soup DeeDee, I will be sharing this with all my friends!!!

Very yummy!  We added an extra can of beans and used beef & chicken stock instead of veggetable stock.  Definitely will make this again!

This recipe was incredible!  It didn't last more than a few days once my family tried it.  My dad put some sour cream on top.  Delicious just as it is.

Spicy and full of flavor. Great Black Bean soup recipe. Will reduce the amount of broth by a little next time so soup will be a little thicker and creamier in texture. Very tasty.

Terrific soup.  Rarely do I like anything so good for me!  I added more chili powder and some red pepper flakes to give it a bit more kick.  Will definitely make this one again!

I omitted the carrots but followed the recipe exactly. It turned out really nice and is my first black bean soup. It is important to simmer or reduce the soup for about 10 mins so that it thickens up a bit. Otherwise it will look watery. I can make this recipe in about 20 mins and the ingredients are really cheap but filling. Only giving 4 stars because It is not overly spicy (like the name says) so we added some hot sauce to give it more of a kick. Otherwise, perfect! Will make again.

Really good, but doubled the cumin and chili powder, I think it would have been very bland had I not.  Also cooked it in the instant pot, 8 minutes.

Used a frozen diced mirepoix of celery, onions, bell peppers that I had on hand. Substituted some frozen riced butternut squash for the carrots (cuz I had it on hand) Sautéed those together In coconut oil until caramelized to start the soup. Deglazed with the vegetable broth. Added extra garlic. Otherwise followed the recipe. It’s very Very good. Cheap and easy too! For a family with some vegetarians some not, this was a winner with everyone!

What a great tasting soup and a great way to get beans into your diet.  I used dry beans, which I pre soaked and then boiled before adding to the soup.  A keeper recipe. Yum.

I did make 2 changes. I had 1 can of black beans and 1 can of kidney beans. So I mashed the kidneys and kept the black beans whole. I also put 2 cans of chicken broth but no water.
It was delicious. I took it to a potluck and it was a success!

Made this in the Instant Pot with a couple changes. Added 1 1/2 lbs of seasoned ground beef, half tsp of red pepper flakes and added a split Serrano pepper. Served with a Mexican salad. Delicious meal for the whole family.

This was an OMG!!  I also added 8 oz of  white Pinto Beans.  I did not have any Cumin, and I only added 1.5 Tsp of Chili powder.  We are not heavy "heat" people with spices. It came out perfect for us.  Plenty of flavor and a little bite with the chili powder and pepper.  We sprinkled shredded cheddar before serving. I made a double batch, and I am so glad I did.

Delicious! I put everything together, and just used my immersion blender in the pot to puree it half way! No need to dirty a blender.  I liked another person's idea to use some potato instead of three cans of beans, and I thought it was perfect--probably helped thicken it too. I did add extra spice, as others had suggested, and it was great.

I used 2 c. fresh mushrooms instead of corn, i can black eyed peas instead of  the 2nd can of black beans, added fresh chopped cilantro, and squeezed a whole lime.  Also vegetable  "Better than Bullion" instead of vegetable stock, and 1/2 a red onion.  Tried to use what we had in the fridge instead of buying, since we're leaving for 2 weeks.  Anyway it was easy and delicious.  I think it's a great base and very open to variations and substitutions.

Love this!! I added extra garlic (because you can always add more garlic) extra chili powder & cumin. I added some paprika. When it was done I added some sour cream, fresh cilantro and lime. Then I paired it with some yummy Asiago bread. Will make again!

Delicious!!!  Def will make it again. 
Based on some reviews I read I made the following adjustments,
3 garlic cloves,
2 stalks of celery,
3 cups of veg stock,
4 carrots,
1/2-1 more tsp of chilli powder.
Was going to add an addl can of beans as suggested but forgot and glad I didn’t as it was perfect without.

I will definitely make this again.  It was a hit with the whole family (all adults). I did use 2 cans chicken broth instead of vegetable broth. I did not find it to be too much liquid. But in addition to  the 2 cans of black beans (pureed one) I did add one can of beans (pintos). I also added sliced celery. I also served it 2 days after I originally made it.  The seasoning in the recipe was perfect.

Such a great soup! Fed my whole family and they all loved it. Super quick and easy to make, cheap ingredients too which is a bonus. I used crushed tomatoes instead, and only blended half of the second can of beans, and it’s such a good, thick consistency. I also put in only one teaspoon of chilli powder and it’s still got lots of kick but not too overwhelming! Add a little bit of grated cheese on top and it’s perfect!

This soup was a big hit with both my husband and my vegetarian friend! I’ll definitely be making it again and again! (I followed the advice of a couple other reviewers and used fiesta corn, 3 cans black beans and only 2 cups veg broth.) Tasty!

I used salsa instead of stewed tomatoes only cause I had salsa opened that needed to be used. It definitely added flavor and a kick to it. Will definitely make this soup again. I topped with tortillas strips!!!

Excellent! Highly recommend adding  shredded cheddar cheese  when serving.  It provides a perfect  finish to the soup.  

I did make some changes after reading reviews. Followed the suggestions for less broth (used about 2.75 cups), more ground cumin, and an additional can of beans.  I also substituted 1 can Ro-Tel tomatoes with green chilis and an 8-oz can of tomato sauce for the stewed tomatoes; and for the corn I used an 11 0z. can of Mexicorn. My husband and I both loved this soup!

Loved this recipe! I had a hard time trying to find a meal that I could make for myself and my fiance that contained no meat or cheese and this one worked perfectly. I added some Hot Sauce and 2 Serrano peppers to it as well. All in all 1 of the better soups I've found.

Excellent and super easy! I added celery and a little extra garlic. Used chicken broth and added cilantro during cooking then sprinkled a little on top. I also made tortilla strips for garnish. Not too spicy, just right.

I made this and it was delicious! I doubled the beans to make it thicker. I also added a little more corn. I read that someone suggested cilantro, so I put that in as well!

VERY GOOD. Very few changes for me and very enjoyable  soup. No cumin. Puréed 1/2  can black beans with a small can of fire roasted tomatoes and a regular can of tomatoes.
Thickened soup nicely and fire roasted added  flavor.
Added very few red pepper flakes at end.  Enjoyed.

Use this recipe as a base and customized it to my liking. I added more veggies, such as celery, zucchini & green peppers. I also added egg noodles & Mexican meatless crumbles. I threw all veggies, spices & broth in the crockpot. Cooked on low for 6hrs. I did end up adding more spice than the recipe called for, again I customized it to my liking. After the 6 hrs put the crockpot on warm & added the noodles & crumbles. Soup turned out really good, I did have to add more broth due to the extra ingredients I added. I really enjoyed the soup, topped it off with sour cream & mexican cheese.

Worst black bean soup I’ve ever tasted . Followed recipe exactly! Problems: way too thin and watery, not enough flavor. Simmered extra hour attempting to thicken, then puréed additional beans and increased the spices. Sigh. Now have a large pot of only so-so black bean soup.

Very good- I used chicken broth rather than water and added a 10.5 oz bottle of salsa roja, 1 lb of browned ground beef, a small bag of frozen veggies, and used a can of tomato sauce in place I’d the tomatoes.

Love this recipe. I usually only make chowders because I never got thinner soup to taste right. This is perfect. My only change was frozen corn instead of canned because that is what I had on hand and I added some blanched kale I had in my freezer from my garden.

We loved it. Instead of oil I used bacon fat and butter. I sautéed onion, celery, carrots, green bell pepper, and minced garlic together. I used chicken broth (it's what I had) and a little beef bullion (for flavor). We used a can of great northern beans, navy beans, and black beans - it's what we had on had. We used frozen tomatoes from our garden... So there was more than it called for. And I seasoned it with chili powder, paprika, garlic powder (we like garlic and other reviewers said to use 3 cloves of garlic), Cajun seasoning, cumin, a dash of cayenne, and black pepper. We forgot to puree one can of beans so we pureed 2 cups of the veggies out of the soup right after we added broth, then added it back to the soup. We ate it with rice it was great, I think it would be good with cornbread. You could easily add any kind of meat to it... Shrimp, andouille sausage, smoked sausage, chicken, roast, pork, leftover meat... Very versatile recipe.

Look man, i don't know about you, but this was some bland soup. after some heavy tweaking, it turned out alright. i'm not sure if you meant teaspoon or tablespoon on the cumin and chili powder but it needed TABLESPOON! I also put a lil more black pepper in, and some salt really helped it have a greater amount of taste, didn't really measure out salt just kinda winged it till it tasted alright. probably won't make this again, but i mean at least it turned out ok and was something different than the chili i always eat.

Great combination of flavor, quick and easy to make.  I added more chili powder and cumin after tasting, I like it a little spicy.  Also added a third can of black beans for more protein, and I like them.

I didn't realize that I wasn't supposed to add all of the black beans at once to puree 1/2 of them with the tomatoes until after I made the soup. So, I just added 1/2 of a can of tomatoes at the end and still tasted great. I will definitely make this again.

Also-- it is good to use tortilla chips to scoop the soup like dip.

I added an extra can of beans and only added about 1 1/2 cups of vegetable broth as I like my soups on the thick side. Good recipe to add to. Needed to add more spice than called for. After the changes I made, my family loved it!

The flavors in this soup are wonderful! However I do agree with other reviews who said that 4 cups of liquid is too much. I only used 3 cups of liquid and I added some shredded chicken. Other than that I followed this recipe exactly. With three cups of liquid it was still a little bit runny but I'm hoping that it will thicken up overnight in the fridge.

Made as suggested with additional chili powder & cumin.  Very good soup that comes together quick.  Added 1/4 C cooked rice as others suggested to thicken it.  We all enjoyed this.

Instead of spices & crushed tomatoes I used a jar of medium Salsa, it made it easy & the spiciness was just right! I added a dollop of sour cream on top of each serving!

Loved this simple to make soup and you could also cook a few boneless chicken thighs, cut these up and add it for the person who like meat.  It tastes great day one and even better day two.

It was very bland.  I'm very sensitive to spicey stuff and this was not at all spicey and didn't have a lot of flavor. I added zucchini and some lentils but that shouldn't have taken away from flavor. I still ate it all week for work lunch so it was a tolerable way to get vegees and protein!

This was a great soup. Only change i made was adding zucchini and celery which would not change the taste. Used exact amount of stock and it was perfect. I think some people are forgetting this is a soup, not a stew. Of course adjust to your own preference, but not a fault of the recipe.

I made lovely soup in anticipation of a snow storm. I followed the directions however, I added whole wheat noodles, okra & potatoes. (I also added a pinch of sea salt). I will definitely make this soup again & again! Very easy & delicious!!!

Followed the recipe as written.   Great idea blending one can of beans with the tomatoes as it thickened the soup.   Definitely will be making this again.

This hit the spot! I made some black beans in my instant pot this morning so I was looking for a soup recipe that I didn't have to run to the store for. I had everything on hand and it turned out delicious! I used frozen corn and topped the soup with chopped avocado, shredded cheese and sour cream. I loved this!

I always make changes to every recipe that I make due to personal taste. This recipe was the base of a delicious soup!  I loved it. Added more garlic, a bit of jalapeno, celery, and mushroom stock. Thank you for the inspiration.

Wife and I are enjoying this a lot. The only change I made to the pot was I added a couple cans of Mushrooms though I suspect one would of sufficed. In my own bowl though I put a couple teaspoons of sriacha as the soup just wasn't spicy enough for my tastes. Otherwise awesome recipe I will definitely make it again

AMAZING!!! I love this soup! I took some advice from others, and I added a can of pinto beans. I also added a little more carrot. Other than that, everything was the same. I will be keeping this recipe to make over and over for sure.

Reduced chicken stock to 2 C.  Left out corn, only because I didn't have it. Also added 2 stalks ch. celery . Upped garlic to 2 cloves. Added ch. cilantro and juice of 1 lime at the end. Did mash the beans and tomatoes in food processor before adding, rather than using immersion blender in pot, because leaving the ch. vegetables whole and not pureeing was the texture difference this soup needed.

Good soup, I do however wish the instructions told you a) to not rinse the corn, ingress i have a habit of this. And also assume you have a pan and rewrite so that it assumes you start small pan and  move to big pot

Made this on a cool autumn evening. Both my husband and I loved it! I used a really strong chili powder and might decrease the amount next time as it was REALLY spicy but we like it that way. Definitely will make it again and maybe add a few more veggies. Yum

I always try the recipe exactly how it's posted, before making tweaks. this soup came out really good but it felt like it needed a little extra, I will be adding more of everything listed along with celery next time to make this a little more thicker and to give it more flavor

Delicious! I added 3 extra teaspoons of chilli powder and an extra teaspoon of cumin. Also threw in an extra chopped carrot. I wanted a little extra heat and flavor. Other than that, made no other changes and it was a hit with hubby and even with my 1 year old baby! He is really into beans. Topped with some sour cream and shredded mexican cheese and oyster crackers. Really tasty and good!

This recipe is great and simple!  I didn't have beans so skipped them and used water instead of broth.  I skipped the cumin too.  This dish is perfect especially when your stomach doesn't feel like working too hard.

Making it again for sure. My kids loved it and my son who is a picky eater said  Best day ever !!
I added 3 garlic cloves,  3 TBS  fresh corn kernels, beef stock instead of vegetable  and since I did not have canned tomatoes I added 1 cup of chunky salsa. Served with warmed nan bread, sour cream and chopped green onion.

Really great soup!  I was looking for a meal that I could bring for a vegetarian family.  I doubled it so my family could also eat it as a meal.  Even my meat-loving husband really liked it.  Now I make it a lot during Lent!

When I read everybody's reviews on how good this soup is, I thought, CAN'T be THAT good! Well, I was wrong! This soup is the BOMB! I did however add celery, a little more seasoning and only 3 cups of the vegetable stock. Can't wait to make it again and will try it with okra

So easy! I used 3 cups of veggie stock instead of 4. I thought 4 would be too watery.  I also added another 1/2 cup of frozen corn and a whole green pepper and that added a nice crunch. Delicious!!!!

This was SO good.  I needed more servings, so I made a batch and a half.  I used 1.5 times all ingredients EXCEPT: 2 cloves garlic, 5 carrots, 5 cups CHICKEN stock (instead of veggie stock), 5 cans of beans (2 pureed).  I also added 3 stalks chopped celery.

After adding the stock, I let the veggies cook for about 10 minutes before adding the beans and corn.  

I found that it took longer than the recipe stated for the carrots to get tender.  I topped each bowl of hot soup with shredded cheddar cheese.  Delicious!

I made this for a family member that is a vegan and he loved it.  I think this was the best black bean soup I have eaten, in home or in a restaurant.  A little involved to make but worth the effort.  I also took several suggestions from the other reviews and incorporated them.

Excellent soup. I substituted chicken broth for the vegetable broth and reduced the chili powder to 1½ teaspoons, since my partner doesn't like things too hot. Delicious, easy meal. This recipe is a keeper.

This was delicious! The only change I would make to my recipe is not to use a vidalia onion next time. It made it just a tad too sweet for my family's taste. Otherwise, it was excellent! I loved the puree that was added. Simple and tasty.

This soup was delicious!  Just used less chicken stock. Saved some to add when reheating!  I would also add another can of black beans to soup.  My husband said it was the best new soup he had in a long time!

This was good. Different, almost sweet from the cumin and corn flavors. Hubby and kids liked it. Only used 2 cups chicken broth, little less chili powder, bag still frozen black beans and then once cooked through used the cuisanart  stick to purée about 1/4 of it and meld the flavors together.

This soup is a good jumping off point depending on what you have on hand. We were on day 3 of snow so I was scouring my pantry and freezer for things to use up. I used 1/2 large leek, 2 large carrots, 5 small stalks celery, 4 cups of frozen corn that I roasted, 1 red pepper that I roasted, 4 cups of homemade black beans, 1 can Rotel tomatoes and 1 can no salt added tomato sauce. For seasoning I used black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, no salt taco seasoning, cumin and Better Than Boullion Vegetable Base. I added water as needed as I changed the method somewhat. As written, this is not spicy, I had to add more spices, but that is our personal preference, we really enjoyed, froze leftovers for lunches.

MY family enjoyed the soup. I did add a can of peas and drained all the liquid off the veggies before adding them. By doing this I found the liquid to veggie ratio very nice.

One of my family's  favorite winter soups. It's tasty, healthy and fast to make. The 1st time, I followed exactly and it came out very good, just little bit on the runny side for my taste. Form then on, I use less broth, 3 cups, and depending on what I have on hand, I make with chicken or beef broth or even with bouillon cubes when out of liquid broth. Also I like to add some chopped peppers and celery to the mentioned veggies for more nutrition and a handful of chopped cilantro at the end of simmering for more flavor. And if I am not in hurry I like to simmer the soup for a longer time.

I followed the others advise and added 3 stalks of celery and cut back on the broth to 2.5 cups. I also added 4 cloves of garlic, 3/4 tsp of paprika and an additional 1/2 tsp of chili powder. I wish I had cilantro, because I think it would add a nice touch to this. Plan on serving it with cheese and sour cream.

I read and followed the other recommendations from previous reviewers. I added celery, extra garlic and extra cumin and chili powder. Can't wait to have it with cheese enchiladas  for dinner and maybe even with tortilla chips for lunch.  Yummy.

My family really liked this & had multiple servings. I did not add the onion, but otherwise followed the recipe. I think that it would have been better if there was less liquid, but I just used a slotted spoon when serving so that it was thicker. I will make this recipe again since my 4 year old loved it : )

This was really yummy.  I added an extra can of black beans. Served it with shredded Havarti/cheddar cheese, cilantro, sour cream, avocados, and warm bread.  Needed added salt.  Great recipe.  Next time I think I might add shredded chicken breast!

I'm rating this 5 stars even though I totally ran with the recipe and kind of did my own thing at the same time but it gave me the creativity and confidence to try so that alone is worth 5 stars to me. It started out with, I accidentally added green peppers when I saw add pepper. It meant black pepper. Oops. So I figured, well heck, let's just keep going. I added celery, zucchini, carrots, omitted the chili powder and cumin. I didn't have any stewed tomatoes but I had a can of diced tomatoes with italian spices in it so I added that instead with a little parsley, seasoning salt and garlic powder. I reduced the vegetable broth by about half so it would be more stewlike vs a broth soup. I served it over egg noodles in a bowl. It came out fantastic! The little leftovers there were didn't survive past lunch the next day. I had a lot of fun with this one (I'm a new cook) and recommend it highly.

3/5 stars made exactly as directed. I found it watery and bland, rather like a weak pureed chili,  but with potential. Next time I replaced the tomatoes with an equivalent  can of tomato sauce and used spicy black beans undrained instead of plain black beans. Much better and now a 4/5 star soup!

This soup is great;  I will definitely keep this in rotation.   I added an extra tsp each of chili powder and the cumin and added celery.  I doubled the recipe so I used 2 tablespoons of  chili powder; 4 tsps. cumin; about 5 celery ribs, 8 medium sized carrots, 2 large white onions (to offset sweetness of carrots) and 6 cloves of garlic; used 2 cans diced tomatoes; 2 cans reduced sodium canned black beans to puree but used 1 1/2 cups dry black beans to keep whole (soaked in water for about 3 hours and will use entire 1 lb. Bag next time); 2 cans Del Monte Southwest corn and used 6 cups low sodium chicken broth plus 2 cup of water with 2 sodium free chicken bouillon packets.  As you can tell I really tried to cut the sodium in this recipe because it would be quite high without these adjustments.   It's amazing how it didn't need additional salt with all the cutting back but I did a very light sprinkle of salt at the end just in case the veggies released a little more water in the fridge.   Also,  I know most said that 4 cups (8 cups if doubling) is too much but as one reviewer stated, you have to let it simmer and it will thicken.

Great soup. Tweaked the recipe a bit. I added some chipolte hot sauce. .Also, added about a cup of frozen kale mix from Schwann's. After it cooked for awhile I added a few dashes of garlic powder, cayenne, and chili powder.

I've made this recipe twice now. The only changes I've made are that I don't blend the beans, I add an extra can of beans (red for variety), and I used zucchini instead of corn. The flavor is delicious and it is easy to make with whatever you have on hand.

One of my favorite recipes so far! The only things I did in addition to everything in the recipe was add a couple bay leaves and some red pepper flakes to make it a bit spicier. The second time, I didn't do that and we could tell the difference. Otherwise, this is an excellent soup for veggies like me and non-veggies like my parents :)

Loved the soup.  Did follow a couple recommended changes.  Used 3 teaspoons chili powder, only one can of chicken broth, and rotel tomatoes with chillis.  Will definitely make again, maybe add some kind of meat like chicken sausage.

This was such a good soup, we didn't have any leftovers to put in the freezer! I made a few changes based on previous comments, and added some non-vegetarian items because we had them around and need to use them up. I apologize, because I know it's supposed to be a vegetarian soup, but I substituted chicken broth for vegetable broth, and added about 1 1/2 cups coarsely chopped sliced ham. I doubled the quantity of tomatoes and used diced instead of stewed, and I split the quantity of beans/tomatoes in half for puree and half for whole. I increased to 3 tsp. chili powder, and 2 tsp. ground cumin, added 2 tsp. salt, 4 tsp. garlic powder, 1/4 tsp. dried thyme, red pepper flakes, fresh parsley, and fresh oregano. Served it up with a dollop of sour cream and home made cornbread! I will definitely make this again, maybe with the more vegetarian version to be healthier!

Delicious! Added 1 1/2 cups of quick cooking brown rice in step 2 and a small cubed zucchini  and a large green pepper in about the last 5 minutes. Also cut the chili pepper in half because my family is wimpy.

Great bean soup! I used a crock pot and let it simmer on low for a Saturday (about 9 hours). Low and slow helped cook off excess liquid and cook the beans very thoroughly. I added (like others) a bit more of the spices and added a touch of turmeric. Definitely will make againand add more carrots and corn. Crock pot made plenty to eat, share and store for later.

This soup was to die for.  It was so flavorful and good.  I used fresh corn cut off the cob, as well as beans I had cooked myself and their cooking liquid instead of canned beans and vegetable broth.  Although I used the equivalent of 2 cans of beans, I will put in more next time as I LOVE black beans.

I thought this soup was amazing!  I added zucchini.  I also added cilantro (1/2 into the puree and 1/2 into the soup).  I didn't have any stewed tomatoes so I used a can of diced with the green chilies in it...  I started out with 2 cups of the broth, but I added more just to get to a less thick consistency.  This is the kind of soup that each spoonful you are just thinking.. "this is SO good!!!"  :o)

This recipe was good, but needed some adjustment. I thought it was pretty bland as written.  I ended up doubling the spices and added Kosher salt to taste (I think it ended up being something like two tablespoons worth in my case).  It's probably due to the stock we chose (no msg or added sweeteners), but it bears mentioning that you should really season to taste because, as written, we ended up with fancy bean water.

We also chose to go with fresh chopped tomatoes and corn (two ears' worth), and simmered for about 30 minutes.  The corn really came through as the star in this dish, and I highly recommend it if it's in season :)

Amazing soup and pretty quick to whip up. I added 2 stalks of celery and some frozen spinach. The can of stewed tomatoes I had was for 18 oz (recipe calls for 14.5 oz). Therefore I decided to increase the amount of cumin, chili powder, and black pepper to balance out the increase of stewed tomatoes and the added collard greens. P.S. The aroma this soup produces is beautiful!

I thought this soup was ok. I tried it because I'm trying to lose weight and thought this would be a good one to try. I was looking for something with more of a "beany" flavor. I added cilantro, celery and zucchini in it, as well as a little more chili powder. I think the cilantro and additional chili powder definitely helped. I think next time I would add another can of pureed beans, and maybe another can of whole beans. Served garnished with sour cream and a little cilantro sprinkled on top. That helped, too. Because of the veggies in it, I did not skimp on the salt, because I feel like that helps bring some dimension. For those wanting a soup with less of a broth-y texture, I would suggest dissolving some cornstarch in a little water and adding it to the soup when it begins to boil.

The gold standard in hardy soups. I was particularly impressed that half the beans were pureed along with the tomatoes. This set it apart from most broth based soups. A total winner...

Really liked it. Whole family ate it. I decreased the broth , added an extra can of beans, 2 chopped zucchini, small bag frozen corn instead of canned. I agree needed more spices, so season to taste. Also added 1/3 box ditilini pasta near the end. Was delicious. Thickened up as a leftover, and loved it even more. Thanks for posting!

I would have rated this 5 stars, only I didn't follow the recipe exactly -- but that was just because I was trying to use what I had on hand. I ended up substituting frozen mixed veggies and corn for the carrots and canned corn, and using chicken broth plus some shredded chicken instead of just vegetable broth. The biggest alteration was probably with the beans and tomatoes. I thought I had what I needed (who wants to go to the store when it's below zero outside?), but I only had one can of black beans and a 28 oz can of tomatoes. So I put half the can of beans in whole, and pureed the rest of the beans with the full 28 oz can of tomatoes. It turned out great! It was like black bean-vegetable-chicken tortilla-chili-soup. Added a little shredded colby jack cheese and some crushed tortilla chips on top, and it was delicious. The only thing missing was some sour cream. Next time I might try it with the full two cans of beans, but otherwise I'm not sure I want to risk messing with it!

Spice flavors are wonderful. Did't have corn so added 2 small diced potatoes (uncooked), and it was great. Added about 1/3 less stock than called for because we like more stew-like consistency. Maybe the starch from the potato  added a little thickening as well, too. Don't know enough about cooking to tell, but will definitely make again!

I loved this recipe! After reading the reviews I changed a few things around. I didn't have carrots so didn't add them. I used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth and only used one can. I also used a whole bulb or fresh garlic and added half a jar of salsa. We topped it with Tostitos scoops and a little shredded cheese. Will definately make this again as we usually have all he ingredients in the kitchen.

This was awesome. Made a few changes according to what I had on hand.  Instead of 2 cans black beans, I used one can white beans, 1 can black.  Pureed the white beans with my tomatoes, and added an extra can of tomatoes.  Used tomatoes with garlic and onion...YUM!

This is awesome and that's with all the little mishaps I had. One hungry daddy and two screaming babies doesn't do me any good when trying something out for the first time. I did tablespoons instead of teaspoons so I added more beans about one more can and more vegetable stock. I love it!

Delicious with the advice of others. I used about three cups broth, and added cut up crookneck yellow squash because I wanted a little more vegetable.  No changes other than that, and I thought it was delicious!  Served with sour cream since it has a bit of zing to it.

I added 1 extra teaspoon of cumin and 1 extra can of black beans. I cooked some rice separately and added about 2 cups of cooked rice to soup. Lots of cilantro put on top before serving. Delicious!

My husband recently went vegan so I've been looking for yummy things he can have.  We were both very happy with the result. I'll be making this one again!

We added some kidney and Northern beans, celery, jalapenos and more garlic.  It helped kick up the flavor!

Very good soup. It was fast, easy and low cost to make. Even lower cost using your own dry beans. It was great with corn bread and made a good vegetarian meal. I added more garlic and used hot sauce for my soup. Will cook this again.

I changed a few things.  I don't like hot and spicy so I left out the cumin and chilli powder. I didn't want the onions caramelized so I put them in the pot when I made the vegetable stock.  I also added a bag of frozen Normandy blend vegetables.  I made four cups of stock instead of two. I wasn't looking for a thick thick soup. Like someone else suggested I served it with warm buttered tortilla.  Also I added a small can of tomato sauce as well to get more of the tomato base. Loved the recipe so filling.

Did just as recipe was written, & it was great! I added the the corn liquid because it didn't say to drain it.  Added brown rice  and chalula hot sauce in my bowl, just to make it more of a "meal".

Delicious recipe. As others, I made a few small changes. I decreased amount of vegetable stock to 2.5 cups, used 2 t. cumin and 2 cloves of garlic. Very flavorful and healthy!

This is the second time I've made this soup and it is terrific!  I added extra garlic and omitted the oil (I sauteed in water).  I didn't have stewed tomatoes, only regular diced.  I also used only 2 cups of vegetable stock as someone suggested.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a good wholesome soup. I did make a few changes.  I had a can of the spicy black bean and a regular one.  I also added a small can of chopped green chilies to the food processor mix. I think I would definitely add a little more garlic next time, but it was great as it came out.

One of the best soups I've made in a while. Cooked as written, except reduced veggie broth to 3 cups as some recommended, but turned out I had to add more broth the next day when I reheated it. So, may just start out with all 4 cups the next time. I also melted some shredded cheddar cheese on top when serving, which was good, but not really that necessary, since the soup was delicious on its own.

This was extremely bland, and my spices were very fresh, not old at all, so that wasn't the problem!  I added the spices a second time before reheating the leftovers, and it was still bland!  Maybe some cilantro would help, but I threw the recipe out, won't make it again.  I gave it two stars because it was easy to prepare and wasn't gross, just tasteless

Outstanding recipe. I added 2 stalks of celery when I sautéed the onion,and upped the chili powder and cumin because we love those flavors.  I did not bother to blend the beans, just added to the soup and simmered. Even better the next day, topped with a twist of lime and cilantro.

YUMMY! 

This recipe is super easy to put together and absolutely delicious.   Perfect for a fall evening with a salad! 

I made a few adjustments to accommodate what I had on hand:

Canned tomatoes - 3 large fresh tomatoes 
Canned corn -  frozen corn 
I also added a tablespoon of dried cilantro for added flavor and a little salt due to the fresh tomatoes. 

I will absolutely make this again, thank you for posting!

This is delicious as is, but I like things spicy so I added in Cayenne Pepper and Louisiana hot sauce for an extra kick. It was all gone in 24 hours.

I made a lot of changes to this recipe based on the other reviews and it turned out great. I used 2 cups of chicken stock instead of 4, added potatoes, parsley, cilantro and fresh lime juice. I also saved about 1/3 of the diced tomatoes instead of blending and added a fresh tomato.

I added rice and used a can of diced tomatoes with green chilies. I also added a 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper and an 1/8 teaspoon paprika for a little smokey flavor. I thought it needed a little something else so I also added 1 teaspoon vinegar with 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon. It turned out great! Very flavorful.

I made this tonight for the first time and it was fantastic!  Like others, I changed a couple of things to suit our tastes, but the basic recipe was the same.  I used petite diced tomatoes with green chiles and added some basil and thyme to give the broth a little more complexity.  I did not puree the beans and tomatoes, I didn't sautee anything before I tossed it in the crock pot, I omitted the oil completely, and cooked everything on high for about 5 hours.  I also adjusted the ingredients to make it right for the two of us.  My husband ate FOUR bowls!!  Thank you for this great recipe!

Made some changes.  Used 3 kind of beans along with the black beans. Didn't purée any since I wanted it thinner !!!  Used 5 cloves if garlic. It's a delicious low cal, meatless soup.

I pretty much followed the recipe and found it to be bland. I think if I had made some changes suggested by other reviewers it would have been good.

I had just made some black beans and this recipe popped into my inbox at the perfect timing! Now, I didn't have stewed tomatoes or canned corn- so I used 3 small sweet corn on the cobs, and then I pureed two fresh tomatoes with the beans. I also added celery(didn't have green bell pepper, but that would have been really good in it too!). As for the beans- two cups pureed, and two cups in the pot. I had to add an extra two cups of broth as well for a total of 6 cups. I know some people reduced the broth, but I always add more veggies than the recipe calls for. Like, there's no way I can just put 1 clove of garlic lol or two carrots. The only thing I really did change, was I added a little bit of smoked paprika. This soup really hit the spot! And it's an easy recipe that you can really change around to your liking. Thank you DeeDee!!

Great recipe. I suggest removing 1/2 - 1 cup of stock and adding an additional hot flavor element such as hot peppers. Toss in a bowl of nacho chips and even your kids will love this.

I tried this dish with a few tweaks and it is delicious!  I upped the garlic to 4 cloves, decreased the amount of broth to 2 cups, added a can of rotel tomatoes to increase the spice factor.  It did thicken after cooking.  The next time, and there will be a next time, I will probably halve the corn and add some green beans or another veggie.  It is great with a bit of Gouda cheese.

I added cilantro, taco seasoning and salt. Used Italian stewed tomatoes. I also added sour cream to top it off along with some tortilla chips. Next time I may add some cheddar cheese.

This soup was great. Very easy to make, and you can add whatever vegetables you want! We took the advise of some reviewers and only used 2.5 cups of vegetable stock so it would not be as 'watery'. We added zucchini and frozen corn instead of the canned corn. Even if you are not a vegetarian, I think this would be a great recipe to add to anyone's rotation.

I'm not a fan of tomato based, or vegetable soup, but I really do enjoy this one! It lacked a little spice for me, so I added some cayenne pepper to give it a kick.

Loved it. A modification I made and that changed the soup dramatically was a bit of lemon juice. Without the lemon juice, I liked the soup, but it felt that something was missing.

Was a wee bit limited on ingredients, only used one tin of beans, and they were kidney beans.  Used a tin of tomatoes instead as well.  Added a spoon of turmeric for a bit more zest.  Cooked for 20mins longer than recipe.  15mins before cooking finished, added an entire bok choy and romaine lettuce, both chopped.

Delicious...

Delicious!  Followed the recipe but made the following additions using some of the suggestions made by others: 2 additional cans of black beans, 1 additional carrot, 1 green pepper, 1 cup of celery, 1 pound of ground turkey and cilantro.  Served the soup with salad and rolls and it made a hearty meal, filling meal.  I also let the soup simmer for 30 minutes.  I didn't find the soup thin at all (at least the way I made it).  Will definitely make again.

I thought this was a great recipe!  I read all of the reviews and made some adjustments according to what we had in the pantry.  I used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth (4 cups). I added celery, red peppers, and potatoes (all sautéed with the onion and garlic).  I only had one can of black beans.  I threw in some zucchini from our garden too.  Per one reviewers suggestion, I added some rice at the end.  It was absolutely delicious!  Thank you.

Even though I added more garlic and a bit more cumin and chili and fresh cracked pepper, even a shake of hot sauce, it was still boring. I should have known it would lack flavor when there was no salt in the recipe.  Since I used all low or no salt  canned items, it really needed some salt to bring out flavors. That didn't help.   Glad I didn't add all the broth.

This was okay. A little bland and I read the reviews and followed instructions well.  Reduced the stock to 2.5 ups, added 2 stalks celery, and I upped the garlic to 5 cloves and added an extra can of beans at the end.  Definitely edible, but not a favorite.  Will not make again.

My oh my this worked wonderfully.One day when sick I made this. The changes were: omitted corn and black pepper (didnt have any) and after dishing up we topped with grated cheddar, sour cream, lacto fermented jalepenos, lacto fermented corn relish (has cilantro,onion,red pepper in it too).  What a kick!!! We ate with toasted bread n butter. Delicioso

Good base recipe, but not spicy as-is.  I had some trouble getting the spice up and used a lot of the suggestions here.  Used more garlic, chilli, cumin, chicken broth instead of veggie, added celery, and it was coming along.  Then I added a small can of rotel tomatos with green chilis, and it was at a really nice spice level for someone who likes more heat.  Unfortunately it was too spicy for my 13 month old daughter at this point, as there was heat left on the tongue after swallowing.  I would work on it again to find the sweet spot, perhaps half a can of the rotel.

Great soup! It's a great blend of the beans, spices, corn and carrots. I had to cook the onions for longer than 5 minutes to make them soft. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to drain the corn, so I left half the liquid. I also used 3 cups of broth. It might have thickened up more if simmered longer, but it is awesome how it is. Thanks for the great recipe!

Very good- however, the veg. broth needs to be reduced to 2 cups.  I, also, added 2 stalks of celery (chopped) and 1/2 green pepper (chopped) and added another can of black beans as well as 1 cup of salsa. This made a very thick soup and it was great!

This soup is not as thick as most black bean soups because it's a vegetable soup with black beans. It is delicious, easy and fast to prepare. I added mushrooms because I had some that needed to be used, celery, garlic powder and 4 cubes of frozen cilantro. I also used frozen corn instead of canned. My husband and I both liked this a lot.

This soup came out good, and I am a terrible cook.  I used 3 cans of veggie stock after reading that in several reviews.  I accidentally added 2 cans of tomatoes instead of one but it was delicious.  Added a bunch of chopped jalepenos because I prefer spicy food.

This soup is terrific! My whole family loved it and felt it was very filling. I cut out the garlic but added green pepper, celery, and cinnamon. The cinnamon makes it spicy-sweet. LOVE this soup!

PERFECTION! i had to improvise a bit because i didn't have enough black beans, so i mixed in some garbanzos and pinto beans when i cooked them. also, i didn't have stewed tomatoes so i used a jar of chunky salsa that i had in the cabinet. it was awesome! my boyfriend and i loved it, the spices were perfect. will make again and again and again.

Delicious on a chilly night.  I changed the recipe to accommodate what I had on hand and used cream corn instead and three cans of black beans.  I didn't purée tomatoes or beans either and added roasted yellow and orang pepper  and a hint of cayenne pepper!!!! Outstanding!! So much to add to this recipe!

This soup was delicious! I usually give the exact recipe a try the first time around and this one was very easy and worth it. It came out just right- no salt needed. I didn't have any vegetable stock on hand so my broth consisted of 4 cups of water with 2 bullion cubes - 1 vegetable and 1 chicken.

I served it with cornbread, which made it that much better! Will definitely be using this one again.

This soup was great!  The amount of spice was just right.  I made this as the recipe states. As others posted, it was a little running; but it didn't detract from the flavor. However, next time I will use less liquid.

Great, hearty soup that can be served with a variety of different sides and toppings. I added some broccoli and spinach to mine, since I had them on hand. I topped the soup with nonfat Greek yogurt, Mexican cheese, and fresh sliced avocado. Not only was it delicious, it looked beautiful! 

The only thing I would say is I might reduce the vegetable stock to make it a bit thicker. This soup has become a fall and winter staple!

I used this as a base for my soup.After sauteing the carrots onions and added celery I threw into my slow cooker. I added 2 cans of black beans non-pureed, 1 can of garbanzo beans, corn, cooked split peas, 3 cups of mushroom broth, stewed tomatoes puree chili powder, cumin, cayenne, fresh thyme, dried marjoram, salt and pepper. I cut up cubes of pepper jack cheese and covered on high for 2 hours. THIS turned out amazing!!! So perfect for a cool fall night!!!!

I used olive instead of vegetable oil, celery instead of carrots, and cayenne instead of chili powder.  The recipe is just a wee bit too hot with the cayenne so next time I will use the original chili powder recommended in the recipe.  Other than that, this recipe is perfect: easy, filling, satisfying--and delicious.  Definitely a keeper.

Love this recipe! Have been making it for several years now. 

Few changes I've made over time-I use three cans of black beans and cut out the carrots to make it more of a black bean soup. I also don't puree the tomatoes because I love the chunky tomato in the soup. Depending on who I'm making this soup for, I'll add a little crushed red pepper for some spice too. Always a good soup for a cold rainy day!

Great soup. Very easy with plenty of flavor. We changed up the spices to 3 tsp Cumin and 1 tsp Cayenne. Used 4 cups veggie broth as suggested and was the perfect consistency to crumble cornbread in. We will make this again for sure.

This was ok. It was a little too bland for us. Probably won't make it again. Needs more garlic and some other seasoning; maybe some hot sauce or cayenne?

The perfect soup to keep you warm through the cold Canuck winter!  I followed the recipe and used the 4 cups of vegetable broth, I found it came out to just the right consistency, not too thick and not too soupy....I did add only two cups to start but ended up using all four.  The only change I made was to use a little over a cup of frozen kernel corn instead of canned-it's more nutritious, better tasting, contains no salt and stands up better through the cooking process than the processed canned version.  Will be making this again!

I thought this soup was ok. The amount of broth called for seemed really excessive. I used half the amount and it was plenty soupy. Maybe it's personal preference, but I didn't care for the carrots in it - maybe a green or yellow pepper would accompany the flavors better.

Great simple, easy, yet tasty soup. Makes a lot so froze some in individual portions for future quick meals. Will make again, but next time add more vegetables, maybe even some vegetable crumbles (fake ground meat) to keep it a vegetarian meal.  Thanks for sharing the recipe DeeDee!

Tomato allergy so skipped the tomato all together and the soup turned out perfect!  I served this with tortilla chips and shredded cheddar cheese.  Perfect on a cold winter day!

I started making this and realized I didn't have all the proper ingredients, but it was STILL fabulous!   Used carrot juice (instead of carrots) and twice as much corn (I used yummy mexicorn) with diced tomatoes instead of stewed tomatoes, then threw in some avocado chunks. My fiance is typically pretty picky but he LOVED it, and so did I. I can't wait to make it correctly ;)

This is a beautiful, colorful vegetarian recipe. I gave the originator four stars, but I can never just leave a soup as it is. I added chipotle spice and a little bit of celery seed. Very good. :) I also used a little less stock and cooked it for a little longer in order to allow the spices to absorb more fully. Didn't puree the tomatoes, either.

This was delicious.  The flavor was very mild, so you might want to tweak it if you like more spicy food.  Even my husband loves it!

Great soup.  As mentioned by other reviewers, I used 2 cups of chicken broth instead of 4, and I also used cayenne pepper instead of chili for a very powerful kick, and a sprinkle of cheese at the end.  I'll definitely be making this again!

This soup is top-notch! It's healthy and inexpensive to make, even when using all organic ingredients. I like to add a can of tomatoes and green chilies to give it a kick. Very hearty! A new staple in our house :)

I tried this recipe out because I happened to have all the ingredients. Wow! It is awesome. I decided at the last minute to just use water with extra spices instead of the stock and it worked out just fine. I added some dried cilantro and a little extra cumin which gave it a little more flavor. I also only used 3 C. liquid, it still was pretty runny so I ened up simmering it for over an hour and it was DELICIOUS! I am definitely going to make this again. Perfect for soup and sandwiches since it is still more of a soup and not quite a chili.

I just want to say, this is an exceptional recipe. I noticed people saying the recipe was "too watery, and/or bland" I followed the recipe to a T and had no problems at all. If it is too watery, drain the corn and drain and rinse the beans.

This was one delicious soup.  I found the recipe and simply love black beans to death so it grabbed my attention.  I did add celery and zucchini and pureed an extra can of black beans as well as one can of kidney beans.  The texture was excellent and my young kids who will hardly eat anything asked for seconds!  We also added a dot of sour cream to each serving and the soup was even better! I made this again tonight to take to a friend that just had her baby and she called to ask for the recipe moments ago.  I will definitely make this again and again this winter!  5 shining stars!

Nice easy soup with a good flavor.  As other reviewers suggested, I cut broth in half and added an extra can of beans.  Next time I think I will cut broth down even more.

Delicious soup, but I did have to increase the cumin and reduce the vegetable stock.  I like that I can add different veggies to the soup to fill it out.  This time I added green peppers, celery, and green beans.  The longer this simmers the better it tastes.  Thanks for the recipe, DeeDee!

Delicious!  You really don't need to add anything to it.  I did, however, add 1 lb of lean ground beef, 1 cup of cooked pasta shells and served it with corn muffins.  Out of this world!  There was enough leftovers for 3 days -- not complaining!  I'm an organic health nut and will be adding this to my winter soup collection because it's so natural, healthy and wholesome.  Thank you for the recipe.

Fabulous!!  I made this with dried black beans and threw it all in the crockpot for about 6 hours.  Then I blended half of it in the blender for a smoother soup.  It is now one of our favorite recipes!  Thanks for sharing!

I really liked this basic soup recipe.  Like most everyone else that cooks I made a few adjustments.  I added a can of tomatoes with green chilies and a couple handfuls of rice.  But mostly I followed the recipe.  Very good.

Excellent recipe. It's very flavorful. Instead of pureeing the tomatos and beans I mashed the soup while it was simmering and it works pretty well.

Super yummy soup! After reading other reviews, I did mess with the recipe a bit. I used fresh chicken broth instead of veggie (about three cups) and boiled the soup for about half an hour to reduce the volume a bit. I used two cloves of garlic, some beef bouillon powder, and lots of cumin and cayenne pepper for extra flavour. Also, rather than using canned black beans I used about three cups of my own cooked ones, half pureed and half whole (I cook large amounts of organic dry black beans in my crock pot every few weeks, then portion them into ziploc bags and freeze them). This soup tasted fantastic served with sour cream and cilantro. Next time I would probably sub frozen corn for the canned stuff, and I'd add at least another cup of beans - I really like the texture added by the whole beans and I think it could have used more. Thanks for a wonderful recipe =) it will be a winter staple!

Wow! i was expecting this to taste like chili, which i didn't want...but it didn't, it was sooooo good! I didn't have a blender so i just mashed the beans and tomatos in a bowl. I tried it as is, was perfect, but i added tex mex cheese as a topping just to see what it would taste like...very good! My husband absolutly loved it and you know it's a good one when your 3yr old gobbles it up in minutes!! Would be great as a winter soup with some different veggies. thanks for this recipe i'll be making it all the time!

Delicious recipe. I had a couple of ears of corn that I had BBQed, so I cut the kernels from them instead of using canned. Really good soup recipe!

I made a few of my own minor modifications according to dietry issues. This is delicious! Very healthy choice without feeling cheated out of good flavor and a sense of variety!

I made a few adjustments to fit my taste.  Only used 1 can of beans and 1/2 cup of corn, added 1/2 pound of ground beef, 1 small zucchini, 2 tbsp tomato paste, and 1 tsp of sugar.  I also cut the amount of stock in half.  I like my stew chunky so I didn't puree any of it.  It was great!  Thanks!!

I made some adjustments because I didn't have some of the ingredients but it tasted pretty good! I had 1/2 cup of dry black beans that I cooked instead of canned beans (less sodium!) I didn't have stewed tomatoes, but used no salt added diced tomatoes. I didn't have chili powder/cumin so I just put in hot sauce. I had to reduce the recipe because I live by myself.... so added 1 can of chicken broth, 1/2 can of diced tomatoes, 1 whole onion, 1 carrot, 1 garlic, 1/2 cup of dry beans, 2/3 frozen vegetable/corn mix, etc. i cooked the carrot and the onion in olive oil. I ate it some shredded cheddar and a nice green salad. Filling dinner, full of protein!

Great soup!  As some others suggested, I used 3 cups of broth rather than 4, and added an extra can of black beans.  Next time I might add bell pepper for some heat.  Thanks for the recipe!

We had this for dinner tonight and it was great, a definite "keeper".  As per others suggestions, I added celery, more beans and lots more cumin and chili powder, and decreased the amount of vegetable stock.  I doubled the recipe and pureed one can of stewed tomatoes and left the other in chunks (we love chunks).  Will absolutely make again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a good hearty soup. I made this when I was on a fast and added more beans and corn and a little less stock to make it thicker. I really filled me up when I couldn't eat meat or bread and was tasty.

Yummy.  Tasted just like I hoped it would.  I did add an extra can of beans and cut down on the broth as suggested by other reviews.  I pureed 1 1/2 cans of beans, threw the other 1 1/2 into the pot, and I cut down the broth to 2 cups.  YUM.

I love this soup!  It is so hearty and great to have on hand for lunch.  I've made it three times in the last ten days, I liked it that much.  I usually have all the ingredients on hand so it is easy to whip up.    Once we added lime, cilantro, cheese, avocadoes, guiltless gourmet corn chips, and kefir cheese (like sour cream) and my kids couldn't stop eating it.    They love it plain too though.  Great recipe!

Very good! I also changed things up a bit. Used only 2 cups vegan 'chicken' broth, used canned diced tomatoes instead for a chunkier texture and added more cumin, chili powder and some paprika as it cooked. Served with a great artisan bread (a whole wheat crusty bread). My 19 month old loved it!

This is a fantastic soup but I am rating it a 4* because I made a couple changes to feed a crowd.  I added chopped celery, a tin of green chilies, organic chicken stock instead of vegetable stock, and increased the tomatoes - a 28oz tin of diced tomatoes as well as 28oz tin of crushed tomatoes.  I sauteed the vegetables until tender, then combined everything in a slow cooker.  I didn't puree it at all, and the consistency was good.  It was delicious and got many compliments.  I will definitely make this again.

This soup was fantastic without the guilt!  I followed others suggestions to cut the vegetable stock down to 2 1/2 cups and it turned out perfect.  I sprinkled a little cheese on top and it was amazing!  Thank You!

Absolutely fabulous! This recipe was simple to prepare and it came out great! I made only slight variations: I used 2 chopped onions and 6 chopped carrots. I used 6 cloves of garlic and went a little bit heavier on the seasoning ( I like a lot of flavor and spice!). I omitted the corn for personal taste. The only thing I would do differently is add more whole beans to make the soup heartier. Next time I will double or even triple the recipe and freeze some for leftovers. This will definitely become a staple in my recipe box!

We loved this soup!! Followed the recipe almost to a T except for - used 2 cloves of garlic, almost a full tablespoon of chili powder and mexi-corn instead of regular. I love finding a quick, easy to make soup!! Plus it has a lot of flavor without having a ton of calories & fat :D

Simply awesome!! I brought back some fresh, beautifully fragrant Mexican cumin last week and this is the first recipe I've tried it in. A total winner! Since the cumin was whole, I ground it with the chili powder using my mortar and pestle, adding it to the garlic to cook for a minute. It is key in bringing the flavours out. The addition of fresh cilantro to the finished soup is divine, as other reviewers suggested. Ahhh, I feel like I'm back in Mexico! Will be making this again and again. Thank you!

This was delicious!  I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and made a few changes:  Two 14 oz. cans of low sodium chicken broth instead of the vegetable stock, a third can of beans, two stalks of diced celery.  I used a larger 15 oz. can of no salt corn, because I didn't see any small cans at my store.  My husband LOVED this soup, as did I.  One daughter declared it to be "not bad" and the other wouldn't try it because she hates everything.  I will make this again and again for my husband and me, and the girls can have tomato soup from a can!

Mild but yummy and lends itself to much improvising! My carnivorous dad and brother inhaled it. I used 1 c. vegetable stock, 1 c. chicken broth and 1 c. water. I also didn't have garlic so I added a celery rib. Used a heaping cup of frozen corn instead of canned, and added 1/4 teaspoon of salt after it was done simmering. This soup is just the perfect consistency, and great topped with shredded cheese. I will be making this one a lot from now on!  Needless to say the company I usually buy my favorite canned black bean soup from is has just lost a customer. :-)

This is a ridiculously easy and delicious healthy soup.  I'ma let you finish, but this soup is the best soup of all time.  Also it let me try out my new immersion blender!  I did use chicken broth instead of vegetable.  I also usually use a couple cans of Rotel instead of stewed tomatoes.

Great soup!  I added more garlic (maybe 3-4 cloves), 3 cans of black beans, 2.5-3 cups of broth (I also like thicker soup) a little more cumin and white pepper instead of ground black pepper. My husband and I loved it!

I have made this soup several times using other people's suggestions of 2.5 cups broth, 3 cans black beans, and more garlic, and it's wonderful.

Pretty good!  Made it exactly as written, though next time I think I'll change it up.  One cup less veg stock, less onion (personal preference), add celery like others said, but really that's it.  I found it very tasty!

My new favorite soup!  I added an extra teaspoon chili powder, used an entire 28 oz. can of tomatoes, an entire 15 oz can of corn and 1/2 cup of regular barley, that I had not soaked.  With the addition of the barley I cook it about 1 -1 1/2 hrs.  The first time I made it the only tomatoes I had were Rotel and it was way spicy, but good.  I top each bowl with about a teaspoon of sour cream and stir.  That addition makes it taste wonderful!

Excellent recipe! I did as others & used 3 cans of beans & put one through  the food processor along with the stewed tomatoes.  Added a bit more spice for our tastes & an extra can of Mexican diced tomatoes & a cup of brown rice.

Made it, liked it. Substituted celery for carrots and used pinto beans in the puree. Stewed my own tomatoes from a recipe on this site. Spices are good in this too.

Good soup with some easy changes! I, unfortunately, didn't read the reviews suggesting to use less broth (I substituted chicken instead of veg.). So, I added a full bag of frozen corn (16oz), a pound of ground turkey, an extra can of black beans, and a can of southwestern diced tomatoes. I love chili powder and cumin, so I added an extra teaspoon of each. I was also bad and added a 1/2 tsp of salt. I let it simmer for about an hour to condense it down a bit more, too. Even though it was still a little too runny, it tasted awesome!

The soup made as it is written turned out good. I loved the texture of the soup.  The only thing I did was that I added a little salt and cajun seasoning for extra spice.

This soup was so easy and delicious! I used low sodium chicken stock instead of veggie, switched out the corn for hominy, used shredded carrots from a bag (much easier to prep)and added a little extra chili powder. It was fabulous! I will be making this again and again. :o)

If doing Weight Watchers, this is 3 pts. Loved the soup. Hearty, fine texture, simple to make (my first soup I made from "scratch"). I subbed chicken broth for veg stock (what we had on hand!) & reduced chili powder to 1 tsp instead of 2 tsp. Yum! With homemade bread (also a first!) on a cold night... just right!

This is the most forgiving recipe ever!!!!  I accidentally put in curry powder instead of chili powder....I had made the black beans from scratch (as in soaking and boiling them), all of the vegetables (including zuchini) were chopped, etc.  I doubled the chili powder and the other seasonings (I refused to just dump it).  My husband LOVED the soup - mistake and all.  Will make it again, for sure!  Also added sweet/spicy jalapenos with the juice.  Great recipe!  Thanks!

This was quite delicious! I made a few changes - doubled everything. I added 1 green pepper and about 2 1/2 shredded chicken. I just threw everything in the crockpot on low for about 5 hours and it came out great! If you do this, chop carrots finely so they cook through.

Delicious. My kids slurped it up! Next time I'll probably add another can of beans (maybe kidney or navy) and some other veggies to thicken it up. The broth is nice, not too thin, not too thick, but it needs more "stuff". But my whole family loved it by the recipe also!

The best black bean soup I've ever had was in a cafeteria. It wasn't like most black bean soups. It was chunky with lots of vegetables. I've been looking for a recipe similar to that soup and this is it! This soup was so delicious. I had to improvise with what I had though. I didn't use carrots, used frozen corn with peppers instead, and to save money, instead of buying spices, I bought stewed Mexican style tomatoes that already had spices in it. I also added sliced celery and red pepper flakes. Sooo yummy! And it's something new to take for lunch instead of frozen dinners!

This was pretty good. only added 2 cups ck stock and was a good thickness. If made really thick it would make a good chip dip if mixed with cream cheese.

This was DELICIOUS. I'm a fan of Panera's black bean soup, and I was looking for a recipe to replicate it... this is MUCH better. I didn't have any carrots, so I went without, but I used frozen corn instead of canned - personal preference.   ALSO... this was my major change, and it was out of laziness. I only had a large (28oz) can of tomatoes, and I didn't want to waste the other half of it... and I know I won't use soon, so I Just doubled everything else (had extra beans on hand, onions garlic n spices too) I didn't have extra broth, so I only used 4 cups instead of 8... I was very happy with this because it would've been WAY too watery with the recommended amount... it was HEARTY and TASTY! Added only 1/4 the chili powder tho... and added a healthy amount of tabasco! Nice bite!  Healthy and quite tasty! This is DEFINITELY a keeper!!!

Not the best soup I've ever made, but it was okay.  Even after doubling the spices, I still felt like something was missing.  I added fresh cilantro to each bowl and that made the soup a little better.  Probably won't make again.

This soup was delicious, however I did make my own substitutions. Instead of using veggie broth, I used beef stock and I also added half a can of tomato paste to thicken it up.

I made a few changes and it was pretty good. I probably would not make it just for me again but my boyfriend LOVED it. I used 2 1/2 cups of organic broth. It was then the perfect thickness for my taste. I also added Tony Chachere's "More spice" seasoning which i think really made it and makes everything tastes better. I did not have carrots but added 2 stalks celery instead.

Pretty good.  I did follow some pieces of advice from previous reviewers though...used 3 cloves garlic and added some celery, added a little more chili powder and cumin, and used Fiesta Corn.  I think next time I will definitely use chicken broth instead of vegetable broth too.  I didn't this time because I had some veg stock I needed to use up.  I didn't care for the flavor the veg broth gave it though.  It was bland.  Overall though, with some tweaking, this was a good recipe.  Topped it with tortilla chips and shredded cheddar and would maybe even top with some plain yogurt or sour cream next time.

I had this soup at a friend's today and I made it tonight.  This is a wonderful lenten meal.  Filling and only 3 points per serving for those counting. I made the mistake of opening a refried black bean can instead of whole beans.  It was flavored with lime, I threw it in for the blended beans and it was delicious. Took the advice of others and added extra garlic and beans. Yummy!

I used diced tomatoes and wanted to keep those chunks, so I blended half the beans with broth instead.  It's a little watery and bland as written.  I let this simmer for hours to develop the flavor and to thicken a bit, and I added a Tablespoon or so of salt.

Made it again. It is still easy and overall a healthy soup, but it is bland as the recipe is stated. It really needs something to zest it up. 3/5/2009 Yum, this was great. Tasted like chili but was SUPA HEALTHY

Great recipe!  I used 2 cans chicken broth, 2 cans corn, doubled the cumin, added cilantro, and added one extra can of blk beans.  I didn't have stewed tomato so I used crushed tomato with the 1 can of blk beans.  My 2yr old and husband loved it!  It made a huge pot, so we will have plenty of leftovers.

Wow, I followed HBOMBS alterations to this recipe and it came out fantastic! My 19 year-old brother - who usually doesn't touch anything that does not have meat in it - LOVED it. My brother - who is Cuban and grew up eating black beans every other day - was praising it to his mom when I made it. We will be eating this at least twice a month with this site's Buttermilk Cornbread. Thanks for the foundation to a wonderful recipe!

This was amazing and is so good for you and your wallet.  It has a lot of taste.  I pureed the soup after it had been cooking to make it more smooth.  It also keeps very well in the fridge for a couple of days.  I will definitely make this again soon.

Very good soup. I used chicken stock instead of vegetable because that's what I had and instead of dragging out the food processor I just mashed the beans and tomatoes with a potato masher and that worked out well. My family really enjoyed this soup.

I made this soup last night, and it was absolutely delicious!  I followed the advice of other reviewers and cut the broth down to 2 cups, added an extra can of black beans (not pureed), a handful of cilantro which I blended in the food processor, and I also added a little more cumin and chili powder to my personal taste.  YUMMY!!! I will definately keep this recipe in my files :-)

I read the reviews and made the following changes: I used 2 cups of chicken stock, 3 cloves of garlic and 2 celery stalks. It was really quick to make and also quite economical. Next time I'll add some different veggies (green beans, spinach?) and more spices.

This recipe gets 5 yums from me.  I made this the other day and I LOVED IT!!  It's like chili soup [without the meat].  It was still delish the following day when I reheated it.  I DEFINITELY recommend this recipe and will make it again tonight.

This soup was great! Even my husband who "hates beans" ate 2 bowls.  I added a bit more chili powder to it and then a spoonful of sour cream.  Ive made this recipe several times since.

This is a pretty good bean soup recipe. I did make a few changes. I increased the garlic to about a tablespoon of crushed and upped the cumin to two teaspoons (as an increase was recommended by another reviewer). The only canned beans I had on hand were Kidney and Pinto, so I put in the Pinto and pureed the Kidney beans with the stewed tomatoes. I also decided to add a small can of green beans I had on hand, thinking it would be a nice touch. It turn out tasty, though we did add a bit of salt to our soup bowls. I very much recommend the increased amounts of cumin and garlic, as it would have been a little on the bland side without it.

Wonderful soup! I've made it several times and it's a favorite between me and my boyfriend. 

I revised it a little by adding 3 cloves of garlic, 1/2 each a red and green bell pepper, 8 small sliced green onions and a pinch of cayenne pepper. I also upped the cumin and chili powder a pinch.

This is a great soup - nicely sweet and very healthy.  On occasion I have successfully used vegetable bouillon for the stock and I have also successfully used regular canned tomatoes with 2 tsp of sugar when I didn't have stewed tomatoes.

Although we have almost made it a stew instead of a soup, it was still very delicious. We added half a cajun pepper, to spice it up just a little more.

This is fairly tasty and certainly easy enough. Dinner was ready in about a hour hour which is great. My kids loved it and all went back for seconds. My only issue is it definitely needs salt-about 1 tsp. We topped it with shredded cheese and had a crusty bread to sop up the broth. A good hearty meal.

Mmm...yummy.  I had to change the recipe a litte - I did not have any stewed tomatoes, so I used fresh.  I also did not have any corn, but I added in one stalk of celery and about 1/2 cup of canned pumpkin puree.  Thank you!  I am looking forward to serving for dinner!

I just LOVE this recipe, it tastes so good and is healthy for you too. I have made it twice now with everyone loving it both times! I do add celery and a can of Rotel, more garlic and threw in some green peppers this time(just because I needed to use them up). I also threw in a can of lightly mashed great northern beans, I didn't puree anything together like the recipe stated. It was wonderful both times. I even added a huge portabella mushroom I had and it was great! I used 2 cans chicken broth and no vegetable stock, the thickness of it was perfect. Thank you for the recipe!!

I decided to make this to use up some beans I had in the pantry.  I used a can of garbanzos (whole) and pintos (pureed with tomatoes) - not sure how much that affected the flavor of the soup.  I liked this a lot since it was very fresh and healthy however it was lacking a little flavor.  I also used reduced sodium broth so I ended up adding some salt to the finished product and served with a dallop of sour cream.  I think next time i will try the black beans and also add a bit of crushed red pepper for some heat.

I really liked this recipe.  My husband and I recently made the switch to vegetarian and this was a great addition to my growing collection of vegetarian friendly meals.  I   took the advice of some of the other reviewers and added more beans, garlic, and chili powder.  I also used less broth and added a little bit of spinach and green pepper.  We like our food spicier though so next time I will add cayenne pepper as well as more salt and pepper.

I really liked this recipe.  Simple but delicious flavors.  I didn't have corn so I omitted that, but added a can of pinto beans.  I pureed one can of black beans with a 24oz. can of peeled, diced tomatoes and it came out great.  I also used 3 cloves garlic and added 4 celery stalks, chopped.

This recipe was terrific. My husband loved it. However, I did add stew meat. Meat is a must in vegetable soup with him. I also used both chicken broth and also some fresh tomato juice from the tomatoes we juiced from our garden in the summer. Simply delicious@

Very good and tasty recipe although I did make a few changes. I add 1 tbs. of minced garlic,2 potatoes cut up, frozen corn, 1 can original Rotel,3 cans Garcia'l black beans drained but not rinsed, 1 vegetable cube, 2 cans vegetable broth, and 2 bay leaves. I cooked it until all vegies were tender then cooled half of the soup and put it in the blender (I didn't blend anything in the beginning as the recipe suggested). I reheated the soup and added fresh spinach at the end. It was a delicious, hearty soup and look forward to making again.

Delicious! I used fat free/low sodium chicken broth instead of the veggie broth. Also added 1 can of diced green chilies and 1 can of diced fire roasted tomatoes. Used frozen baby white corn. Love bean soups!

This soup was great but I made a few changes to suit my personal taste. I browned 1 lb of spicy turkey sausage and added that to the soup. I also added mushrooms and 2 extra cans of black beans to make it more of a bean soup and less of a vegetable soup.

The soup was good. My family enjoyed it, but it still lacked a little something. I used chicken stock instead of vegetable, and a can of tomatoes that had olive oil and garlic added to it.
My husband made a suggestion of adding some kind of sausage such as an andouielle, chorizo, linguica, or some other type of spicy sausage. So the next time I make it, I will take him up on it.

So good! I made another black bean soup on this site and it was terrible. So, I gave this one a try and was very happy. Has a great taste and is really easy. Nice soup for those nights you dont have a lot of time. I made Jalapeno cheese bread to serve along side of it, topped the soup with sour cream and cheese. My hubby loved it.

This has been a favorite for us for a couple of years. I add another tsp of cumin and at the end I add fresh organic salsa for an extra zip to the taste. I also like to let it sit for awhile (1/2 hour?) to let the flavors mingle. Easy, tasty, and excellent when you have bread to go with it!

This is quite good and simple to make. I incorporated some of the suggestions from the other reviews adding fresh cilantro, more garlic and using 2.5 cups chicken stock -- this was perfect. Adding anymore stock would have made it too watery.

This soup was so delicious! I added a can of V8 juice and 2 bay leaves to give it more of a hearty flavor.  Also, a couple shakes of crushed red pepper flakes adds a little kick without making it too hot.  Oh, and the fresh cilantro is a must. Thanks for the suggestion.  This is certainly a recipe to make over and over.

I wasn't crazy about this one. I think because almost all of the ingredients were canned my soup ended up tasting like canned soup :-(  The addition of a dallop of sour cream and fresh avacado did help though.

I make this soup all the time. It's incredibly easy and relatively fast, mostly depending on how fast you can cut the vegetables. I like to add celery and cook it with the onions/garlic/carrots for 7-10 minutes, depending on how soft I want the carrots.

Very good soup!  My entire family loved it and gobbled it up.  I did add more cumin, chili powder, and garlic, like the other reviewers.  I also used chicken broth since that is what I had on hand.

great soup.  i too added fresh cilantro and i thought it was flavorful, hearty and would be good over rice (followed recipe exactly otherwise).  you can even add ground turkey or meat if you'd like.  i pureed it more as i like a thick soup but everyone loved it.  thanks.

This is a good place to start for a yummy black bean and vegetable soup but it is really bland as written ( and this is coming from someone who was sick the day before eating it). I would add a lot more chili powder, cumin, and some red pepper for starters.

This was very good. I also added a third can of beans, half of it to the pureed can, half to the soup as whole beans. Good stuff, thank you!

This is delicious.  I added a bit of chopped green pepper along with the other veggies.  It is pretty spicy with 2 tsp of chili powder.  I think 1 tsp is just right for me.  Yummy soup!

Good soup on a snowy day!  I didn't have carrots.  I added 2 tsp of cumin as I really like the flavour.  I used one tin of Campbells' Vegetable Stock and a 28oz can of chopped tomatoes.  I forgot to add the corn.  I let the soup simmer for an hour and mashed it up a bit.  It was excellent!  I'm looking forward to the leftovers.

Made this last week, and like others suggested, I used low sodium Chicken broth.  This recipe was very tasty.  My husband doesn't care for thick soups, so he loved this one.  Even my mother-in-law liked it and I gave her a copy of the recipe

Wonderfully easy and tasty.  Snuggle down to a bowl of this when it is cold and snowing outside.  I miss real winters – hearty soups taste even better when it is cold outside.

I didn't have any stewed tomatoes so I used a smaller can of Rotel tomatoes with chilies and a little tomato paste that was left over from another recipe.  Gave it just the right kick!  Next time I will use an additional can of black beans, pureed, just because I like a thicker soup.  Also, the corn gave it almost a sweet taste that complemented the other flavors very well!

I just made  this tonight, and it turned out very good.  Made the following changes:  used three carrots, 2 stalks of celery, four cloves of garlic, about three 1/2 tsps. of hot mexican chili powder, two tsps. of cumin, used three cans of beans (drained all, then pureed half with two jalapenos and some beer to make the right consistency) & added a can of petite diced tomatoes with green chiles.  I simmered this for around two hours.  Turned out really good, just the right kick for my family - everyone loved it.

Excellent recipe!  So easy to make and goes together so quickly.  I will admit that I didn't use all the chili called for as we like a little spice but not too much. The dollop of sour cream just makes the soup that much better.  Will make again and again.

This is pretty good with some extra spices.  I doubled, or maybe even tripled, the cumin and chili powder.  I also used 3 cups of vegetable broth instead of 4 and let it simmer for about an hour to thicken it up.

A marvelous base soup to which you can add 1 or 2 things "on hand" to favor your family's tastes. I always add more garlic and cumin than most recipes ask. Only thing limiting this recipe is the cook's lack of imagination or experience. Thanks, DeeDee, for a great recipe!

Loved this recipe!  I added thin sliced ham that I needed to use but would have been great without it.  I actually pureed two cans of black beans with the tomatoes for a thicker soup and I always add more cumin than any recipe calls for because my family loves the taste.  I served this with honey cornbread for a great meal.

This was a very tasty, easy black bean soup!  I substituted frozen corn for the canned and next time I will add some more chili powder and serve it with grated cheese on top.

Thank you for a great recipe.  I had to make a few changes, I didn't have all of the ingredients on hand, but I don't think I lost the integrity of the original recipe.  I used diced tomatoes, frozen corn and baby carrots. I also used half vegetable and half chicken stock. Fantastic.

I was able to save it by adding
1. salt. lots of salt
2. sugar
3. lime juice
4. chili paste

pretty much everything you need for flavour.

I didn't have canned beans, so I used dry and had to add salt (I used miso and chicken broth concentrate - Better than Boullion). I also added chopped red bell pepper with the carrots and garnished the top with chopped red onion and cilantro and cheddar cheese. It is good, not great, but I am sure it will be better tomorrow.

I made this soup, and at first the only alteration I made was to add more garlic.  But after i tasted it, i didn't like it, so i added a lot of salt, which made it a little better, but i still didn't really like it. So I added a can of rotel and that made it much better.  I still won't make it again though.

My husband and I LOVE this recipe.  We are meat eaters, so I just dice up raw chicken and brown it in a skillet with some spices and then add it to the soup.  We recently went camping and I froze a batch of soup ahead of time and it was delicious when we warmed it over the fire!

This soup was really good.  I added extra garlic (about four cloves total) and some cayenne pepper and crushed red pepper flakes (I like things spicy).  I also had to add salt, which was seriously lacking.  Other then the addition, I followed the recipe and it was delicious and healthy.  Served with corn on the cob, corn muffins and a little grated cheese it makes a super yummy and oh-so-good for you meal.

Very delicious soup. I added an extra can of black beans- I love black beans! Instead of pureeing the beans and tomatoes, I mashed the beans with a fork and that worked well.

I used one bag of dry beans soaked overnight and then pressure cooked.  I doubled the other ingredients and used one can of coconut milk as recomended by another reviewer, but did also use veg. broth for the rest of the liquid.  It was definately better the next day.

This is an easy and tasty soup. I forgot to pick up the veggie broth at the store so is used coconut milk instead...worked out perfectly! I think the cook time is a little underestimated, however, i had to keep the pot on for an extra 45 minutes to soften up the carrots.

This was really good.  I added 3 cloves of garlic, ground beef and used 3 cans of beans.  One of the cans of beans I blended with the tomatoes. It also needs a little bit more seasoning.  I added Johnnys season salt.

We thought it was awesome even unblended!  We used a "Mexican" can of corn instead of regular and threw in some leftover shredded Thanksgiving turkey and it was wonderful.

This was absolutely heavenly.  I did not have
corn or carrots so I added a chopped green
pepper.  I also pureed one can of basil oregano
stewed tomatoes with the black beans.  I used
the dry beans rather than canned and substituted the Wyler's Chicken, Garlic and Herb Buillion with water for the vegetable stock.  Will try
adding hamburger, turkey sausage or pecan smoked
sausage next time.

We really enjoyed this soup! I took the advice of others and added a bit of rice to thicken it up a little and the addition was wonderful!  I served it with so cheese quesadillas for dipping and a dab of sour cream on top!

I liked this but thought it needed some more "zip". I will make it again but will add extra beans for thickness and experiment with additional spices, etc. Cilantro might be a good addition.

Great recipe!  I did change a few things after reading other reviews.  I added 3 cloves of garlic, 3 cans of Veg. stock and 3 cans black beans.  It ended up with a perfect constitancy.  Not too thick and not to thin.  I also added 1.5 cans of the beans firt, then blended the other 1.5 cans with the tomatoes.  I did not add the corn, and it was still wonderful!  Wonderful recipe to cook during lent!!

I made this recipe for my son's 3rd birthday party because my uncle is on a strict heart smart diet (no oil, no meat, no fat). I made the recipe as is except that I sauteed the onions in white wine and I reduced the vegetable stock to 3 cups.  I also served it the next day which thickened up the soup nicely.  I got RAVE reviews from everyone that ate it and my uncle had 3 bowls and asked for the recipe!  Can't do better than that!!

I just love this recipe! I am always looking for ways to add beans to our diet, and this sure fits the bill. I increased the garlic to 3 cloves and reduced the stock to 3 cups. I did not have corn (frozen or canned) but I can see that it would have been even better with it. This would be equally good with added ground beef, chicken breast, or andouille sausage etc. if you are so inclined. I will definately make this again.

I substituted frozen corn for the canned and tomatoes w/green chiles for the stewed tomatoes which gave it a nice kick.  The soup thickened up over night and I served it with corn bread & salad for a nice, filling supper!  Definitely a keeper!

This soup was excellent. Easy to prepare, and very tasty and filling. I served it with nachos.

Good flavor.  I used dry beans instead of canned.  It was a little watery at first..but the next day it thickened up.

Excellent soup, rich, tasty and filling.  We did add some creme fraiche which did make slightly thicker and richer.

This was Excellent!  I only had one can of black beans so I used a can of garbanzo beans to puree with the stewed tomatoes.  Hubby suggested that it could go into the regular rotation.  :)

I used a can of veg-all vegetables instead of canned corn since I didn't have any in stock.  It turned out great.  May do that next time as well even when I do have corn.

Like everyone else, I will put less liquid next time for a thicker soup.
