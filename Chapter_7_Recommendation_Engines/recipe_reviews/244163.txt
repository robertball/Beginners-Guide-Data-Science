These are really great!  I have a three year old who I have had to put on a gluten free and casein free diet and he hasn't eaten anything else in two days and when I made these he couldn't get enough!  Thank you, thank you, thank you for posting this recipe.  
I didn't have coconut or almond flour so I used brown rice flour instead and ground almond rather than flour.  I added a teaspoon of baking soda to give it a bit more fluffiness and they came out fantastic!  Really tasty.  Even my husband and I enjoyed them!

These are sooooo good!  I would recommend not overmixing and allow it to be nice and thick.  I didn't have coconut flour so I used all almond flour and then added 2T of ground flaxseed which helps to keep a batter nice and moist.

These are so good that I've made them multiple times - my family begs me to make them.  They're good enough to eat plain, or with your favorite pancake fixings.  My husband said they shouldn't even be called pancakes because they are way better than any pancakes he's ever had.  :)

These are my favorite food right now.  As someone who can't have grains or sugars, this is a super big treat!  YAY!!!

Just a note:  I do the sweet potato differently to save time:  I peel it, cut it into 1" slices, coat with a bit of olive oil and sea salt on a baking sheet and bake at 400F for about 15-20 minutes, or until tender.

ADDED LATER:  I've made these with coconut flour, and tried to add the extra flax seed, and yeah, my batter wouldn't even mix together and I had to add almond milk and another egg to thin it out.   I prefer these without the coconut flour - with the coconut flour they are drier and denser.

These were excellent! My kids gobbled them up! They definitely have a more soft texture, but we didn't mind. I made a few changes: I only used half the recommended coconut flour (tends to make it dry) and I used 3/4 the recommended banana. I didn't want the banana flavor to be over powering. I also added a touch (1/4 c or so) of milk bc the batter was still pretty thick. I plan on adding pecans next time, which will help offset the spongey texture quite nicely. If you're gf, paleo, or on whole 30 this recipe is definitely a keeper!

Very yummy version of Paleo pancakes. I used less banana because I didn't want to taste it :) and I added water because my sweet potato and my bananas were not very moist. I think the texture was a little better with the added water, too (made a few, ate them, then added the water). Delish!

The batter came out pretty thick. I added a little soy milk to thin it out. Other than that it was great. Next time I think I'll start with 1/4 cup coconut flour and add by the teaspoon if I need any more. I also doubled the vanilla and increased the cinnamon, but that is more personal taste

Awesome. My 2 year old loves them. I didn’t have coconut flour so I subbed arrowroot & that worked great too.

LOVED these!  I didn’t have coconut flour so I substituted Namaste gluten free flour. A few more carbs but lower fat this way. I also added 1/4t freshly ground nutmeg. Delicious and the family loved them too!

These are fantastic! I actually made them as waffles to reduce the cooking time. Then they only need about three minutes on a low temp. Just make sure to grease the waffle iron first! (I used coconut oil.) Both kids (3.5 and 7 months) gobbled them up as well!

We decided to try this recipe to duplicate some sweet potato pancakes we recently had at a breakfast specialty restaurant. To start out, we added extra vanilla and cinnamon, used a commercial gluten free flour mixture instead of the coconut and almond flour, and added chocolate chips. The batter was too  thick so we added a cup of milk, and then some water as well (my husband does not like thick pancake batter), but they were very tasty We served them with real maple syrup, toasted pecans and a dollop of whipped cream! All in all, I'm not sure we really "made" this recipe (that's how we always cook), but we'll definitely make it again.
