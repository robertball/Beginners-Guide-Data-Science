Nice to have a snack without processed sugar or flour.  I've made this versatile treat often, and change it every time with  different replacements or additions: vanilla (always), almond butter, dried cherries or cranberries, dark chocolate chips, cocoa powder, sesame seeds.  A friend bakes everything in at 350 degrees for 10-15 minutes. So quick and easy.

These are easy and taste fantastic! I added 1/2 cup of mini chocolate chips. They actually taste like cookie dough!

This was just okay for us.
The things I changed was adding a 1/2 tsp of vanilla, 2 Tbsp of mini chocolate chips and 1/4 cup extra of peanut butter. 
My problem is this mixture was NOT shaping into balls. So, I laid down parchment paper on a cookie sheet and spread the mixture out flat on that and then placed it in the freezer. I then cut this into 24 squares, which must be kept in the freezer. I tried keeping it in the fridge overnight and it became unfirm, so I put it back in the freezer. 
I may make this again, but only if my family requests it. I will not make it for myself (I didn't like it enough).

Yummy! Just the right amount of sweetness for me. I added some protein powder also.

I added a little more peanut butter and vanilla to make it less dry. I also added chocolate chips for added sweetness :)

Made these exactly as the recipe stated.  They were barely OK.   Did not look anything like the photo, not dark and would not stay in ball form.   I did not like them at all, husband said they were ok and the kids left them lay after one bite.   I ended up making cookie dough and mixing these in so as not to waste the ingredients.
