This is absolutely amazing! I am on weight watchers, and this has 0 points!! I skipped the olives, and next time I would recommend adding some tomatoes. I think that would mix nicely! This would be great on top of a green salad too! The best splenda recipe ever, my kids even liked it!!

Wow! great recipe, I've made these three time last month after I found this recipe. I gave the recipe to the lady's at work and they all liked it too. It's a keeper. :) :) :)

This is a great salad recipe!  I make it a healthy salad by shredding some carrots and slicing thinly some red and green peppers!  For the kids I omit the onions.

Absolutely wonderful. It's a little sweet and a little vinegary, but the perfect combination! I didn't leave the skin on the cucumber. It's hard to wait 2 hours for the flavors to seep through. I think next time I'll double the recipe because it doesn't make that much. One of my favorite recipes of all times!!!
