My gal and I tried this last night.  It was very easy to make.  We did change one ingredient.  She is not a fan of mayonnaise so she subbed creamy Italian Dressing for the mayo.  It was delicious and we will be making it again.  She says the recipe would be good with shrimp or chicken as well.  She also wants to add halved cherry or grape tomatoes to it next time.

I love this recipe so much, I make it at least once a week.  Good for the summer months, when it is too hot.  I did change it a tiny bit, I left out the water chestnuts, added 1/2 T. of Old Bay and used canned peas, dried Chives and dried Dill Weed instead of fresh.

Loved this salad.  Did make a couple of changes.  We doubled the imitation crabmeat, added about 4 oz. of halved grape tomatoes, and used creamy Caesar salad dressing instead of mayo.  It was delicious.  Next time will add some garlic powder and salt and pepper.

Yum, I used real Dungeness Crab though, and kicked in a little diced Chipotle.

I made this for my husband and I for lunch. It was really good! I just added some pepper and lemon juice and it was delicious. So easy too.

I like this salad.  I added celery.  Next time I will omit the water chestnuts (personal choice).  This is a very good basic recipe that you can personalize to your own taste.

I do make this a little different but everyone loves it! I use half a cup reduced fat miracle whip and half cup lite italian dressing, one cup peas and one cup green pepper, no chestnuts, dill or chives.
