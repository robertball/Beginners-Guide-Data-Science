This was great! I have a 10" pie pan so I changed it to yeild 10. Used 2 lbs. hamburg and 1 pnd ground pork, and used a 1/2 cup of onions. Came out FAB.! I think next time I may try a 1/2 cup celery chopped fine and a dash of clove. My Mother-in-law asked for the recipe so it's gota be good! Thanks for sharing Rita!

This is very similar to a meat pie that my husband's French-Canadian grandmother used to make. I use poultry seasoning rather than allspice and also throw in some garlic. I have made it with just a top crust only and it turns out well. This is a definite keeper!!

Delicious!   I cut the allspice in half because of a previous review.  I think it was the right call.  My husband loves it!

I followed the recipe except I cut the allspice back to 1 tsp and added 1 tsp of poultry seasoning. Very easy and very good.

Loved this. I had to use pillsbury dinner rolls to form the crust because I didn't have a pie crust available. My family gobbled this up. Very easy to make too.

My grandmother used to make this every Christmas served with ketchup on top!  Only variance was that she used ground sage instead of allspice.

My family is French-Canadian and we have been making this recipe for years and we look forward to this tradition every year even though it is very rich.  This recipe is very close to the one that we use except, we use 1 tsp. each of ground allspice, cinnamon and cloves and a little beef broth so it isn't too dry.  Make sure the meat is well drained of grease.  Do not substitute the pork for all beef, and don't substitue the spices, because if you do, then it's just Meat Pie, not French Meat Pie.

All I could taste was the allspice.  My husband thought it was ok with lots of salt and pepper.

Excellent!  One thing I did differently was grate the onion (and a couple celery stalks) so it's hidden in the texture.  I also adjusted the cooking temperature - baked at 425 for 20 minutes, and then 350 for 30 minutes only because that's how my mother always baked pie crusts of any sort.  The initial high temperature is supposed to sear or seal the outside of the crust (similar to BBQing steak) which then makes for a more flavourful filling.  I don't know for certain if that's true, but I loved this version of French Meat Pie, similar to tourtiere - and the only dish on earth in my opinion that MUST be served with ketchup!

I grew up having "pork" pies at holidays.  My Memere made the best! Since she has been gone for many years now, other family members have been making them.  They all were good but never quite measured up to my grandmothers, even though they had her recipe.  This year, I thought I would make my own as we were going to my in-laws for Thanksgiving  and meat pies are not a tradition with them.  My sister didnt get my grandmother's recipe to me in time so I searched all recipes and this one looked good (and easy).  I made home made pie crust and the only change I made was add cinnamon and cloves instead of allspice as that's how I remembered it. I also used a little bit of beef broth to mash the potatoes to add flavor and moisture, as some meat pies can be very crumbly.  It was DELISH!!!  And, as an added bonus, I didn't get heartburn as I ALWAYS used to with pies others have made. (Not sure why, but something was different in a good way!)  Anyway...this will be my meat pie recipe from now on and I can start making them for family gatherings at the holidays too!  YUM and thank you!

I made this as mini pies in Ramekins. It was delicious! After reading every review, I added a clove of garlic in with the onions when I sauteed them. I also used 1 and 1/2 tsp. allspice and 1/2 tsp. poultry seasoning. I thought that along with the salt and pepper was the perfect amount of flavor. My family and our dinner guests all raved. They asked for the recipe. Will be making again!

I make about 21-24 pies for my family using my Mom's recipes which is very close. I use allspice, cinnamon, nutmeg and clove and I don't use an egg, jut a small amount of flour.

This pie is absolutely amazing!  My mom used to make it for us growing up and we absolutely loved it...i finally persuaded her to give me the recipe and this is exactly it!  Love, love, love this pie!  I sometimes like to add some thinly sliced leeks to it as well ;)

I used ground turkey, added minced garlic and used poultry seasoning.  This reminded me of a large scottish pastie.  We will make this often, it was so easy.

This is so just like the Tourtiere my Mom use to make. I use the 2 tsp of allspice, but also add ½ of ground Sage. I also use some water in the pan to get the meat started rather than the oil. I also ground my onions in a food processor. It make a very nice pie. Excellent. I will be making this evey Christmas eve.

I just love this pie.  My Mom and Memere use to make this every Christmas and New Years and I have continued the tradition and my family just loves it.  Mom once told me I could skip anyone of the spices except allspice. So the only difference is I cut back on the allspice to 1 tsp. and add 1 tsp of cloves.  I also add 1 garlic clove.  My family loves it

This is the recipe an old boyfriends mother taught me to make. I make it evey year only I use lots of the allspice, We like the strong taste of it. My now husband is disgusted that there is potatoes in it, I tell him next year it's his turn to make the meat pie. Somehow we still have this one evey year ; ) Thanks for posting this.

My biggest mistake was only making 2 pies.. When I make these pies now I have to make 5 or more just so I can hand them out to family members and the mailman..  If you like Meat pies then you have to make a couple of these.

I've spent half my life wondering how to make a meat pie. What a great taste! Do not listen to reviewers who advise skipping the allspice or cutting it back. It's essential! We did add about a 1/4 tsp. garlic salt, some more pepper. We also followed the advice of the Scottish reviewer and dribbled on a little beef broth just before putting on the top crust. Served with onion gravy as a couple of reviewers suggested. Delicious! Oh, and my rich pastry required about 40 minutes in the oven.

I always make 2 at a time, because my husband will eat a whole one in one sitting!! This recipe is outstanding!! So good, my French-Canadian father-in-law loves it as well!! No more waiting for him to get back from Canada with a meat pie!! Outstanding!!
I substitute the all spice for poultry seasoning as recommended by another rater...

This was ok but very bland. I added celery to the onions and more seasonings and it was still bland. We ended up eating it with ketchup which made it better. It wasn't horrible but I probably wouldn't make it again.

Was good could use less or no allspice and I think adding garlic would make it better. but all in all a great recipe.

I was meh on this. I found it too dry. My grandmother's was a little more greasy which I prefer. Also used poultry seasoning as some reviewers stated and still was not thrilled. I will probably have to work on this a bit to make it how I want it.

This is fantastic!  I added some carrots and celery (a dash of thyme)and cooked them in with the onions before adding.  I also used beef broth to make the mixture a little more sticky...very yummy!

This recipe is great.  I was using another recipe every year (tradition) but never quite nailed it.  Last year, I discovered this recipe and made it instead.  It was a huge hit, and I only make this one now.   We serve it with chili sauce as a side.

This is a great recipe. My husband has been asking me for some time to make a meat pie and I chose this recipe for it's simplicity. I used the food processor pie crust recipe from this site. I took other reviewers' advice and used less allspice. I made 2 pies, 1 for freezing. Looking forward to the next pie.

I loved this recipe!  (With the allspice in it!)  Instead of regular pork I added 1lb of pork sausage.  I also added 1 can of cream of mushroom soup with 1/2 cup of milk.  My husband is the pickiest man alive and he loves this!

This is part of my heritage.  My mom would make this every Christmas Eve and I did the same for my family.  My children are now doing the same for theirs.  I do not add allspice.  I use poultry seasoning and salt and pepper.  It always a hit with my friends.

My French-Canadian aunt used to make this for Christmas Eve dinner. Sadly I neglected to get the written recipe, but I knew it had allspice in it - that's what gives it such a distinctive flavor. Brings back wonderful memories and so yummy!

What's not to love..meat and potatoes? I did add dry beefy onion soup mix as I like it with my beef. This is simple enough for everyday or elegant enought for company. Next time I might make as a turnovers for company!

I followed this recipe to a T; however, on the spices...just added a tiny bit of cloves, nutmeg, and cinnamon.    It was very dry and my family told me not to make this again!!

Great recipe, followed the original the first time & found the allspice to be a little strong.  Tried the 1tsp of allspice & poultry seasoning like some people recomended second time & it was much better.  A really authentic French Canadian taste to this pie.

I am not a cook by any means, but I just made this recipe and it's fantastic. Not only does my tourtiere look incredible, but its taste is exceptional. I mainly followed the recipe but substituted the minced beef with veal. And, was a little more adventurous with the spices. I added a little l'herbe de provence. Even my son says I did a good job!

I followed the recipe exactly. It turmed out good, except my whole family thought the allspice was too overpowering. Next time I will cut the allspice in half. Except for the allspice, it was very good and I will certainly make it again.

Nice base recipe, but I doctored it somewhat. I sauteed onions, shallots and garlic in 1 Tbsp olive oil and 1 Tbsp butter.  I didn't have mashed potatoes, so I added a can of sliced potatoes. Also, I did only 1 tsp of allspice and added a pinch of sage and about a tablespoon of parsley. I didn't have ground pork, so I added some bacon (cooked it first and drained fat) and a left over pork chop. I needed veggies, so I added carrots and celery. It turned out delicious! I served it with some green beans. Was a hit with my super picky children.
