I must admit that my husband did not like the sound of strawberry pie and after the first strawberry pie I made I was kind of scared but I didn't give up and this recipe turned out to be very delicious and my husband loved it as well in fact he had two slices and did not want to share. This is a great recipe.

I am not a picky eater at all, but I did not care for this recipe.  Graham cracker crust, strawberries and an almond meringue.  Not my thing.  Sorry

The only reason I give this a 4 rating is because it is tricky to make and would not advise a beginner to try it. The end result is wonderful and very impressive because it is something different.  Sorry if I am preaching but hate to see you plan for company and have a failure- not to mention wasted ingredients.  The recipe is correct as written.

I omitted the almond extract and used strawberry juice added to the water (after macerating the sliced strawberries in a little sugar, use the juice). It makes a pink pie, but is delicious!

Delicious! I was looking for a strawberry dessert that's lighter than the cheesecake my husband wanted.

Made this for Valentine's dinner.  Husband said it was one of my best desserts.  It was so different and so fresh and delicious.  Don't have a picture because it went so fast.

The meringue on this pie was spectacular!  The pie itself was so-so but the meringue certainly made it edible.
