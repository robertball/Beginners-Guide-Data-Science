Loved it! I just added some beef cubes (for stews), and oregano and it was a success at my family dinner.  Will do it again for guests.

Well, lentils are good and wholesome, but I would not feed this to my kids too often.  It will not go into my regular rotation.

This was a nice lentil soup.  I tasted the broth after cooking and it did need more help than salt and  pepper. I added in some vegetable base and that was what it needed.  Otherwise my only change was cooking the frank slices to get some color, caramelization and to add a texture .

This recipe would be a good way to get kids to eat a healthy soup! I used turkey frankfurters so it was not too bad. Good taste and a nice hearty soup.
