This was delicious and is open for your own interpretations. We used riced cauliflower instead of rice. Also, we had sugar snap peas on hand so used them instead of snow peas. I followed others recommendations and marinaded and baked the tofu. I also added fresh mushrooms that were marinaded in the same sauce (Gyoza Sauce from Trader Joe’s) since I had them and needed to use them. When I make this again I think fresh ginger would enhance the dressing.

I marinated the tofu in General Tso’s and roasted it in the oven before adding it to the dish. It was easy to make and delicious. It reheats well too. Definitely will make this again.

I  agree with Patrick,  a great lunh to take to work. Not a big fan of tofu so I subbed sautéed tempeh.  What a great and fun way to "eat the rainbow". Thank you Buckwheat Queen  for your recipe. I  can tell by all your reviews that your a healthy eater.

I used basmati rice instead,  and omitted tofu...The dressing was the perfect touch ...
