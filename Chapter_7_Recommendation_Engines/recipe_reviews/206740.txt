Wow! These are tasty, beautiful, and fun. I made these as written, except that I omitted the orange-flower water from the sauce (I didn't have it in the house). The only change I would make next time is to cut the salt just a tad. My 2-year-old loved watching the lacy pattern emerge (though he was not quite so enthusiastic about the taste as I was).

This recipe was great, I wanted something interesting for Christmas morning and this was it. Came out exactly like the picture and it makes a ton. The syrup was also very different, far from maple but better for it. I had no trouble finding seminola flour, it is pricey but was sitting right there in the baking aisle. Overall definitely a recipe to play with!

I could not find Semolina anywhere so I just used two cups of all-purpose flour.  They turned out ok.  not quite as "airy" as I have had before, but not bad.  You have to adjust the temperature on the stove a lot considering that you don't flip these and you can  really taste any dark/burnt spots.  I have had a lot of Moroccan food and am very excited to be able to learn how to cook it myself.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

My husband is Moroccan and when we were first together, I made this recipe without realizing what a big deal it was.  Let me tell you, the look on his face was priceless and he said they tasted just like his mothers...a huge compliment.  Since then, I've made these numerous times and I've also eaten them in Morocco.  This recipe is perfect!  Thank you!

These were amazing! I didn't have the time to make the orange flower water so I made the sauce with raw honey, butter and a touch of vanilla extract then served the pancakes with fresh berries....delicious!!!! Better then regular pancakes anyday!

I was so excited to try this. I ate these in a B&B in Morocco 3 years ago and have been "craving" them since. Although the spongy texture was right with all the little bubbles, the taste was not-so-great. If I make it again, I will add more sugar to the batter and see if that helps at all. All the same, thank you for sharing this exotic wisdom!

Anytime a recipe asks for semolina, you can use farina/cream of wheat, I was told there is no difference.. But since it asks for semolina flour (which is more ground), beware that using cow will make a slight difference since it's coarser. Haven't tried it with these pancakes but I have been looking for unique ways to eat my COW for breakfast, so glad I stumbled on this!

At first I was worried there wasn't enough yeast - other recipes use more. But these came out perfect! There really are thousands of holes and you can see through them when held to the light! We served these delicate pancakes brushed with the warm Honey-Butter-Orange Blossom Water Sauce. Please don't skip the sauce - it's delightful! These are seriously addictive:) they are very easy to make once you get the pan to the correct temperature - you may have to lower heat as the pan will retain heat as it cooks. Especially good for novice cooks to make since they don't need to be flipped. My kitchen is very cool and my yeast was close to Exp. date; So, I also warmed the milk (used 1%)to 115". After blending, I poured the mixture into a covered ovenproof bowl and placed in oven that was warmed on lowest temp for a few minutes then turned off with door cracked. I let the batter rest there for 1 hour. We made 4 at a time on an 11" non-stick griddle and also used an 8" omelet pan. The ones made in the pan were better shaped and about 5" round, but we liked the smaller ones from the griddle better. I think the smaller ones would be better to roll and pass to guests as an appetizer - they're easier to eat with fingers. Thanks for the fantastic recipe!!! We'll definitely make it a regular!

I'm sorry, this didn't turn out so great. I love the idea of the holey tops but couldn't get passed texture. I only made 2 just to try, then made the rest as crepes  to use up the batter because I don't want it to go to waste.  I'm sure there's potential in this recipe with minor tweaks.

I made this for a school project on Islam. I was really nervous because I had never made something so different before. I found this recipe was super straight forward and simple! Everyone in my class loves them and offered to buy seconds! If you are going to make this than Be sure not to add too much sauce because it is VERY SWEET!!!

Same texture as the Moroccan ones. However a little salty. Would reduce salt next time.
