My sister made almost the exact same thing after coming back from a summer internship living with a Mexican family.  She didn't add the lard, but maybe put butter in, instead.  I've made the same thing, but have cooked the onions and garlic in a skillet with some oil before adding it to the cooking beans.  Then you've got some garlic onion oil to use for cooking quesadillas to go with the beans!  I never saw a need for soaking the beans, either.

Nice but much better to soak the beans first (overnight), rinse then cook...add the Onion, Cilantro and pepper at the end of the cooking.

I didn't have time to soak beans, so I just used canned pintos. Sauteed the onion, garlic and jalapeno in a little olive oil, threw in the beans, and added a splash of chicken broth. Good stuff. Thanks.

I have to admit I made some major changes to this recipe and I thought it made an excellent soup.  I decided to saute chicken (boneleass skinless breast) in cumin and salt and a pinch of chili powder for about 6 minutes and added it to the soup for the last hour.  I also added a small can of tomato sauce at the last ten minutes and garnished it with provolone cheese.  It was great.

mexican frijoles are far simpler, just cook with onion, garlic, epazote (wormsweed or jesuits tea). It is better to let them soak overnight, as it saves time and money. The beans should be black, not pinto, and very very well cooked.

Didn't use the lard, added some dried epazote --- would recommend adding the cilantro towards the end.

This recipe is good but I would leave out the jalapenos. I did add a little bit of cooked chorizo to give it a different flavor. I would make this again.

I suggest you cook the beans the night before, drain and refrigerate. I also refried the beans by melting lard (the more lard the tastier) and adding salt to taste, in a dutch oven.  Add the beans 1/3 at a time and mash with the lard until all is hot and bubbling. Lower the heat and top with cheddar or Mexican cheese. This works great as a dip with tortilla chips too.

These beans were "ok" but they are nothing like the picture.  Even after adding a bunch of salt and garlic powder there wasn't much flavor. I will continue looking but I appreciate having the technique as I've never cooked pinto beans from dry.

I didn't use the lard, and they were yummy.  Good flavor.  Add plenty of salt.  Be sure to watch the water level!  Mine almost started scorching when all the water absorbed.

Not at all a fan of these. That seemed to be the consensus of the house as well...perhaps just not to our liking.

Much better than canned and not that hard to do. I used my in a dip but the uses are endless.
