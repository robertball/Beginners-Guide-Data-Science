Made as written and these were great. Tip for the fries. Let them soak in cold water for 5 minutes. Change out the water and let them soak again. When you go to fry, fry them for 3 minutes and take them out of the oil and let them drain on a paper towel for a few minutes. Fry them again. If you like them crispy then this is the way to do it.
