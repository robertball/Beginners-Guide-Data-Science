This was pretty good (and healthy) but lacked some flavor.  Next time, I will try using chicken stock in place of the water and 3 garlic cloves.

I thought this recipe was great!! The only change I made was I didn't have grated romano in the house so had to substitute shaved parmesan-romano, which was fine... But next  time I make it, I'll be sure to upgrade to what's called for in the original. I loved the unusual approach of cooking the ditalini with the asparagus and then adding the egg mixture to the hot pasta... I thought the whole thing was easy and tasted FANTASTIC!! This will become a regular in my collection - thanks!!

It was good but not great. It was pretty healthy though.

Nice and creamy! Easy to make too. I used grated parmesan and two eggs instead of one and it came out great!

This is really good! I used the whole pound of pasta and added a little more water and another egg. I also added a small amount of vegetable bouillon. I didn't have romano so I substituted some mozzarella and freshly grated parmesan. Going back for a second serving right now!
