I put in 2 eggs for a thicker consistency.  3 eggs is cake-like, yes, but this recipe was intended to be that way...it's just preference.  Also, I left out the nuts...doesn't matter what kind you use, if any, not worth criticizing a recipe over that.  And 35-40 minutes is only an estimate....I'm sure your oven is accurate, just as much as the original cook.    Great recipe - I recommend it

This is a tasty recipe and very moist, but not what I really look for in a brownie. First, it's a very light chocolate in color and taste. It's also very cakey, probably due to the three eggs. I wasn't crazy about the almonds. I love almonds, but felt that walnuts or pecans would work better here because of the texture of the cake. My recipe was completely baked in 30 minutes (my oven is accurate). I added chocolate frosting because I wanted more chocolate than this offered.

I baked it in a single 9" round cake pan and it baked just fine at the directed time.  With mini chocolate chips sprinkled on top it looked & tasted like a thick cookie; light & chocolaty.  And it went well with a home made whipped cream.  The cream cheese doesn't really stand out but the whole thing in its entirety is good enough to make again.  My boyfriend literally ruined his dinner because of this!  ;)

Superb! I’m picky with brownies and I like them cakey. So that’s why I like this recipe. They rose beautifully in the oven, which I was worried about because the batter was thin when I spread it into the corners of the 9” pan. I will definitely keep this recipe.

LOVED this recipe. I doubled the recipe and reduced the egg by one. It was so good it didn't need frosting!

Made it as written and loved it! Next time I will only add 2 eggs though since I like my brownies a bit gooier. Also, I know this is a brownie, not broccoli, but watch out for the calorie count in this. The recipe says 139 per brownie, but I noticed that is based on 18 brownies cut from a 9X9 pan, which is a pretty teeny tiny portion. So if you have a normal sized portion, you will be consuming a lot more calories. Again, no shocker since it's a chocolate brownie, but for those who count calories but still allow for a little indulging, beware. :-)

Very good recipe. I went off of what other reviewers said and only used 2 eggs for a less cake-y brownie. I also used bakers chocolate instead of choco chips because it's what I had (3 squares = 1/3 cup chips). I melted the shortening and chocolate in the microwave. Once the shortening is melted, the chocolate should melt on its own after mixing it around a little. I used my mixer for the rest of the ingredients to make it smoother and I mixed the dry ingredients first before adding them to the mixture. I opted out the nuts because my kids aren't too find of almonds. I will make it again but I'm not sure if I'll add the almond extract again, not because it wasn't good but because it seems kind of an unnecessary taste if you don't add the almonds in the first place.
