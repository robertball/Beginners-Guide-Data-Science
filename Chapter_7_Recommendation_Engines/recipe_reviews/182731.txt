I'm reviewing this because I actually made it! Crazy, huh? ;) I did add a tsp. of vanilla. Next time, I might up the spices just a bit, maybe use pumpkin pie spice? I served it with Absolute Best Pancake Syrup and the kids ate two pieces each. I froze the rest in two's so I can just pop it in the toaster on busy mornings.

This recipe is pretty good. I microwaved the sweet potato for 8 min. and then mashed it. The first batch was a little bland so I added 1/2 tsp. Pumpkin Pie Spice and 1/4 tsp. vanilla extract. My 3 yr old grandson loved them. I will make these again. 10/30/09 Forgot about this recipe until my 3 yr old grandson asked me to make it for breakfast today. I am now giving it  5 stars, I added more vanilla extract, about 3/4-1 tsp. and extra pumpkin spice.  Used a small sweet potato and added the whole amount, about 1/2c, Delicious.  3-29-10 Today I used 1 cup of sweet potato, 2 eggs, 3 egg whites, 1/4 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tsp pumpkin spice, 1/2 tsp vanilla extract.  I mixed all the ingreds.(not the bread of course) with my electric mixer on low, just until blended. Came out much smoother. Made with whole wheat bread. Got 7 french toast which I cooled, put between waxed paper, then in a baggie and put in the freezer. I zap 2 pieces in the microwave, covered for about 2 minutes when we want some. Easy breakfast.

This is a fun way to sneak some veggies into your family's diet!  You can't even taste the sweet potato.  These are good.  I did add 1/2 tsp of vanilla and increased the cinnamon to 1/4 tsp. As a side note, sweet potato puree is easy to prepare in advance and freeze.  Just broil a bunch of them and then puree in a food processor and package in 1/4 cup increments in a ziptop freezer bag.  To thaw just place in a bowl of warm water for about 5 minutes.

Haven't tried this yet, but it might also work with canned pumpkin?  Pumkin french toast sounds good too. Thanks for this thinking outside the box recipe.

This recipe is so nutritious, quick, and easy that I've been making it for my 1 year old eveyday for the past week! My only changes are that I use more sweet potato to make it healthier, add a dash of vanilla extract, and use whole wheat bread. It takes two seconds to whip up and mommy gets to eat the leftovers!

I made this tasty breakfast treat for my husband, who doesn't usually like sweet potatoes, and he loved it! We'll definitely be making this again.

simple and delicious!  I keep pureed sweet potatoes on hand pretty often to sneak it into many things for my picky toddler... this is another great way to use sweet potato!  I added more cinnamon and some vanilla, too.

Just made these this morning, wife's appetite not too good this morning..but I made her try a bite...5 minutes later she was in the kitchen fixing a plate. Need I say more? The microwaving suggestion makes this recipe easier and quicker...and i probably will also play with the spices some. Thank you Laurie

Tastes great, though I'm sure there's not much added nutritional benefit, nor is there much change in flavor.

I've been making this recipe for a long time, it's in the Sneaky Chef cookbook. All three kids eat it without complaint, and it does taste good. The picky hubby however doesn't like it simply because you can see an orange color. I only use cinnamon and vanilla.

I used chopped rather than mashed sweet potato, which obviously isn't ideal, but it worked, forming a kind of crusty coating with the egg.  My family liked it and we are following another reviewer's suggestion of freezing them to take out and toast on busy mornings.

This was great!! Added a little something extra to plain old french toast.  My son and I both loved it I will definitely be making this again :)
*I added just a touch of vanilla and a dash of ground cloves.  Served with warm maple syrup- Perfect!

Made this tonight. I used baby food sweet potatoes, because we had them and that made it super easy! Also gave it a super smooth texture. Like others I added extra cinnamon and some vanilla. I also added a splash of milk, because I like it to soak the bread more. Made for breakfast for dinner, and love that we actually got some vegetables.

I made this today since we happened to have sweet potatos from last night in the fridge.  It was very good however I couldn't find any nutmeg so I used vanilla insted.  The sweet potatos blended in great a made the fench toast a little orange.

Delicious.  I followed other reviewers & used pumpkin pie spice & extra cinnamon.  Suggest using a pretty basic wheat bread since that worked best.  I also tried on sprouted whole wheat and it didn't really take to that bread.  The basic stuff turned out excellent. My 2 y.o. Loved it and ate 2.5 slices along with a whole banana!
