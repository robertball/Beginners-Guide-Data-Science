This is not creole gumbo. The secret to ceole gumgo is the roux. It has to be very dark, reddish brown. If it is not brown enough it changes the whole taste and it is not creole gumbo!

Used andouille sausage and kicked it up with 1 tsp cayanne. Added some okra when I added spices. Great over white rice.

being from southeast Louisiana I can say that I have eaten most every type of gumbo..except this one. It takes the taste of shrimp and adds chicken to it. It was a nice change and my family loved it.

The gumbo was great but I changed a lot about the recipe to get it that way which is why I rate this 3 stars.  I did boil the chicken with the onion, bell pepper and salted water.  However, I only used two large chicken breast halves with the skin.  I only boiled it for about twenty minutes.  I took out the chicken, pulled off skin and bones.  I put the skin and bones back into the pot and allowed to boil for another 20 minutes.  I shredded the chicken.  Then I drained the broth but reserved it (its chicken broth, I'm not throwing it away!)  I made the roux and let it turn a deep reddish brown.  I then added the chicken, sausage, onions & bell peppers and I used the broth I had made instead of water.  This got and thick.  I then added the shrimp, seasonings and I added a ton of Old Bay Seasoning!  Its very good, I'm eating right now on top of steamed rice!

I had left over sausage and left over chicken in the fridge.  Found this recipe, scaled it for four servings instead of eight and made it for dinner...delish!  I used chicken stock instead of water and added some garlic powder to the roux.  As I have a toddler in the family, I halved the amount of cajun spice.  I thought I had shrimp in the freezer but found bay scallops instead.  I think almost any combo of meats would work.  This recipe is a keeper for those fridays when it's time to clean out leftovers in the fridge.

The cooking time is to long.  The chicken becomes very stringy after 1 1/2 hours on low and then you add shrimp and cook an additional 1 hour.  Talk about tough shrimp.  Then the directions didn't explain about making a roux.  I took mine to a mohagany color; which took an additional 20 minutes.

This is a great tasting recipe! I used the chicken stock created when I boiled the chicken and vegetables (in place of the water). And I also added one 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes.My family loved it!

This was great.  I can't believe I forgot to debone the chicken before making the gumbo!!!  Nobody cared though, it was THAT good!

This recipe was okay...wish I could say more. I wanted to give it a shot, as a switch from the way we normally cook gumbo... But, sorry but still believe the roux is key to a perfect gumbo in our home. For those that have never made a roux or gumbo, please try this method: use equal parts canola or vegetable oil and flour (we use 3/4 cup)... on medium low heat, constantly stir oil and flour in cast iron pot or magnalite pot...NEVER leave it, and NEVER try to rush it... Stir until the roux becomes a color of a penny or mahogany color, and then add your onions (2 chopped yellow) and green pepper, with a teaspoon minced garlic. Also, we don't like the consistancy of chopped celery, so we use whole stalks for flavor. Also, boil your chicken night before, and debone to have ready if you like. We use a whole cut up chicken or whole chicken, drain it and use tbe broth for gumbo. When making the gumbo Do NOT cook the COOKED chicken that long in your gumbo!... as others have said, nor the shrimp! After sauteing your veggies, and adding your broth, then chicken... allow to cook for about 30 minutes on medium low heat...add shrimp (and fresh parsley :) and allow to cook another 30 minutes.

We loved it; I used the tip below to brown the roux about 8 min then added onion, bell pepper & garlic to the roux, cooked them until soft.   I used boneless skinnless breasts so I threw them in later ( I hate stringy overcooked chicken); the shrimp was pre-cooked so I just threw them in to heat for about 5 minutes before done...    The bones usually give flavor to the liquid so I made up for it by using some chicken stock & wine...   I also added a can of rotel, small can of sauce because we like tomatos.  For the Cajun seasonings I used 2 tsp. Old Bay and 1/4 tsp. cayenne, 1/2 tsp. ea. oregano and basil.  I was told to not serve until the next day so flavor can set in.  Served with a scoop of rice, file powder and hot sauce on the side... :)

Made recipe exactly as listed. It was too much work for the results. Was oily and lacked flavor. Kept adding creole seasoning, but never seemed very savory. Probably wouldn't make again since I'm not sure what to change.

Having a roux for Creole gumbo is okay, but I would use okra and tomatoes myself. Why put Cajun seasoning in a Creole gumbo? And the chicken, well that's okay, I guess, but I would just have shrimp and sausage.

I guess I'll never understand why someone would put shrimp in a chicken/sausage gumbo or chicken &/or sausage in a seafood gumbo.  Either make a seafood (shrimp, crab, oysters) gumbo or make a chicken n sausage(andoulie) gumbo.  And if you're making chicken gumbo make the roux dark, very dark.  Not so much for seafood gumbo.

never made it before.  This was a good beginner recipe for gumbo.  I would probably kick up the spices more, and it probably does need the roux to be cooked a little darker.  I hadn't done it before, and was used to my roux being for gravy which I like lighter.  I think cooking the roux longer to darken it up would really add flavor to the sauce.

Very filling, but took more time to prepare than expected, and not really a gumbo.  Taste was fine, but not what we expected.

This is great. My wife does not like anything remotely cajun/creole. She ate this up. It is not what I think of when I think "gumbo" but it is very good nonetheless. I put my chicken in a turkey fryer and boiled it on high heat for about 30mins. Deboned and tossed it in my roux. I simmered for around 40 minutes and it was done. I did not do the lengthy simmer time. I used crawfish instead of shrimp. I put those in at the end after doing a saute with cajun spice. Wife wouldn't eat it with the tails(or shrimp) so i did it that way and put them in my alone. Served over rice. It was great. The family (kids included) say its a keeper. Thank you for the recipe! I think next time I may toss in some oysters :)

The recipe was a great starting place and enabled me to make it my own. I used red bell peppers in place of green bell peppers. Chorizo sausage both fresh and smoked and rock shrimp. I used boneless and skinless chicken thighs. Spices included Aleppo Chili peppers, oregano, Tabasco and  habanero pepper sauce. I served it over red rice and topped it with fresh diced avocado.

I "test drove this" this recipe and found it exceptional! The second time around I decided to modify it a little using some Christmas dinner leftovers. I didn't have any chicken, but had One pound of smoked pork and beef sausage.Added 6 med. potatoes, 2 onions diced, 4 pieces celery, 4 carrots,and the following spices. 1 Tbl.sp. chili powder, 1 Tbl.sp. Cayene, 2 Tbl.sp. garlic, 4 bay leaves,salt and ground pepper to taste. I followed the directions by Kara. Great!! This is a keeper!! Thanks Kara for sharing!

I made this for the first time for some friends yesterday, and it was a sensation. Even my British friend who had never even heard of gumbo, said its was "fantastic". I adjusted things slightly as Jenna advised. I boiled checken according to recipe, kept broth for simmering. I added Old Bay to my roux, added the chicken (shredded), and the rest of the ingredients together, covered and simmered for 30 mins. Served over rice. Word has already spread to other friends. I think I may have created a monster. Thanks from a novice!

I made this without the chicken thighs. I browned the diced chicken breasts in olive oil, and added the onion and bell pepper. I let it all simmer for about 45 mins in total (threw the shrimp in about 15 mins from the end). It turned out great - very satisfying and flavorfull. Thank you! - but the recipe needs to be much clearer on how to make the roux, and 2 1/2 hours of simmering time is completely excessive.

I had messed up another recipe and was looking in 'allrecipes.com' for a way to rescue our dinner, and used this as the basis, and it worked out fine and we're still married.  Instead of using water for the 2nd part of the recipe, I used a box of low sodium chicken broth to good effect, coming out with a nice, thick, gravy-like liquid.  I also didn't have shrimp, so didn't need to use the final hour of simmering (after all, the initial 40 min. of boiling plus the next 1 1/2 hrs. more than cooked that fowl) but did add already cooked rice (Chinese leftovers, what can I say?) to the chicken and sausage until the rice was thoroughly reheated.  Probably should have just reheated the rice and put the dish over that.

Didn't have file powder. Added hot sauce, cayenne and cajun seasoning. Also used chicken broth instead of water. Served over brown rice. Makes a lot. Was good but I will stick with my own recipe.

Not a very good, nor authentic gumbo recipe. Too much chicken compared to the shrimp and sausage.  To be Creole it must have tomatoes.  To be authentic it must have celery as well as the onions and peppers.  And cooking gumbo without garlic would be an affront to all that is sacred about Louisiana Creole style cooking.  There are much better gumbo recipes here to choose from.
