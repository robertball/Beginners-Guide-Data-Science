So delicious!  And so quick to make!  Perfect for a wholesome week night meal.  I was concerned about the lack of seasonings, but due to the saltiness from the bacon, and the seasonings from the jar of sauce, it didn't need a single adjustment, and my kids ate two servings.  We served this with thin whole wheat spaghetti and it paired beautifully.

This was a great base recipe for carbonara! All I did different was use Oscar Meyer Turkey bacon ( it's the best) because I can't eat pork, added 2 cups peas to the sauce and used 1/2 cup dry white white instead of water. I honestly didn't think it was going to come out as good as it did was pleasantly surprised. I only had the small rigatoni past, not spaghetti, and my husband and I actually preferred it as the sauce has somewhere to ooze out out of. Lol. He loved it. This was so easy it will definitely be a staple for us!

I grilled chicken tenders and used a can of drained tomatoes.  We LOVED this recipe.  Will be making this again for sure!

This recipe was SO good and easy to make! I added baby shrimp, scallops and peas to my sauce and served it over steamed, mashed cauliflower (my family is eliminating pasta). It was amazing!!!

AMAZING! The one and only thing we did differently was browned some bite sized pieces of chicken breat and threw it in the sauce too....so good. Way better than olive garden's!
