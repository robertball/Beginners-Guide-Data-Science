Yum and beautiful with a mint leave garnish, the cooking of meringue was tricky but found heating over boiling water to point of just beyond touching temperature done quickly and without a candy thermometer worked best.

This pie was perfect for the almost too ripe strawberries I had in my fridge.  I hadn't ever made a chiffon anything and worried about cooking the meringue too much as I did not have a thermometer.  The fruit never did "mound" so I worried it would not set up right but I was wrong.  This pie was light and airy and delicious.  My only suggestion would be to not use a sweet crust as the filling was sweet enough and my whole family said the regular pie crust suited the filling and that a graham or other crumb crust would not. have been as good.

Delicious and worth the extra steps for such a light and creamy pie that I made with raspberries. So tasty and pretty served with whipped cream and a drizzle of raspberry sauce. Thanks for sharing!

I have been looking for a recipe just like my Mom used to make ... for 41 years, and yesterday I found it!  This brings back special memories and is a perfect summer dessert, light and tasty!  Made it today and was not disappointed at all!  I am SO excited to have finally found it!
