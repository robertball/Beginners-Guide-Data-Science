We loved these!! Me and my kids just made these this morning. They are easy and fun to make with the little ones. Very chewy and crunchy... YUM! We made ours with the walnuts suggested in the description and kept everything just as it was. Wonderful!! Definitely a keeper recipe, thank you for sharing!

I found these to be a bit different from the norm which I liked.  Just remember to notify the "eaters" that they have peanuts and coconut in them...potentially very harmful for some with various allergies and colon problems.

I can't believe no one's reviewed this recipe! These cookies are crispy and yummy! I, as usual, made some changes: I ommitted the nuts and changed semi-sweet chip to milk chocolate chips. I urge you to try these cookies!

I followed the recipe exactly right down to the peanuts though they are good they seem to be lacking a bit of flavor.  Next time I think I'll try using Butter Flavored Crisco instead of regular.  When mixing in the chips, nuts, and oats I recommend using your hands.  The dough is very crumbly, the last half of my dough I worked in 1 T of milk and it made the dough easier to work with and you definitely need to use your hands to form balls instead of dropping them by spoonfuls.  The baking took the full 12 minutes.

What a surprisingly good recipe!  I bring cookies to work every Wednesday and this is one of the bigger hits I've had.  I don't like coconut so I used cornflakes and that was really good.  I used the walnuts because Dad ate all the peanuts, but next time I want to use peanuts.  I also want to add some peanut butter for more flavor and beacuse the batter was a little crumbly and the cookie a little bit dry.  I think it will add flavor and help hold the cookie together better.  My parents and grandparents loved them.  They were a bigger hit than I expected.

Great results and rave reviews from everyone that had them at the potluck! I used peanuts, chopped up.. Didn't have shortening, so I used a cup of butter.. It worked just fine. These are excellent! Thanks!

Excellent!  I toast the oats, coconut and nuts (pecans) and use butter instead of shortening.. I also add dried cherries and butterscotch and peanut butter chips.. honestly, people go crazy for these!

These are pretty good cookies.  I didn't put peanuts in them because I didn't have any.  I did however change a few things after reading the reviews.. I only put 1 1/2 Cups of flour in it and I added some cinnamon because people said it was lacking something.  I also only needed to put them in the oven for 8 minutes.. but that could an oven thing.. so yeah.  they were good!

These cookies were great. At first, they are delicious. I used butter instead of shortening and 1/2 cup chocolate chips and pecan. The result was great. At second, some time ago I used one recipe with cooking oats and they flew on my baking sheet. But I had nothing similar with this recipe. Of course, I`ll make these cookies again.

These were really good.  I didn't have peanuts, so I just added a huge hunk of crunch peanut butter.  It didn't alter the taste too much, but added a crunch.  They were easy to make as well.

These were very good!  Except for leaving out the peanuts, I followed the recipe exactly.  I found it made about four and a half dozen cookies.

These turned out really good!  Baked up nice-didn't run all over the cookie sheet.  The dough was crumbly but held together when shaped with hands.
