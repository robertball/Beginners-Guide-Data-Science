My hubby loved this (I'm more of a leave-the-meat-alone type).  I have to agree that this was not only easy but tasty.  I did use a teaspoon of dried parsley rather than fresh, and the olive oil I used was lime flavored.  I think that between 1/4 and 1/3 cup of bread crumbs would be a great option because I had some of my Progresso Italian crumbs left over.  I wondered how I was going to make this breading stay on the pork chop without the usual flour/egg/breading recipe type, but it just did.  My pork chops were bone-in and not as thick as I'd have liked them, so they did cook fast in the oven---only about 15 minutes after browning them on stovetop.  You need to moosh the breading mixture together with a fork to get it to hang together, but it really does.  Thanks for dinner tonight, Fenhoff!

This was fine but didn't have much taste even though I added salt to the breadcrumb mix. Followed the recipe as outlined except for adding the salt and not cooking as long. Would have been way overdone had I kept it in the oven so long. Will not be using this recipe again.

This chops were very juicy! I absolutely will make it again. I will also add salt to my taste but as is the flavor is excellent. By the way, I only had dried parsley so I used it and the recipe came out great.  My chops were pretty thick so I had to adjust the baking time and technique accordingly. I baked for 25 minutes each side covered with aluminum foil. Then, I baked for 15 minutes without foil. It was excellent!

These chops were just ok.  Still in search of a pork chop recipe that we love.  Probably wouldn't make again.

Seemed like too much garlic for our tastes so only used a tablespoon of minced garlic for 1.5 cups of crumbs.  I also thought to add some seasoned salt.  I will make again.

I agree with previous reviewers about having a substantial amount of bread crumb mix left after coating my “chops” with it. Additionally, I was pleasantly surprised at how well the breading adhered to the meat-even through frying and baking. While I found this recipe flavorful, I adjusted the baking time to about 15 minutes per side for my boneless, relatively thin cuts of meat.

Although it was very easy to make it was. We did not like the taste, but don’t let that sway you in any way, it just  wasn’t to our tastes

This was OK  I won't make again.  The lemon was the dominant taste.  My husband loves pork chops and he said the same thing that it was OK.

No stars for this disaster. Dry doesn't even come close to describing this dish. 
Don't bother making it. 
When my husband doesn't go up for seconds I know it's not good.

Meat was moist, but breading didn't have enough flavor for me.  Easy to fix though and I would make it again!

Use standard breading procedure; flour, egg, panko. Toss in other ingredients in the panko, including salt, which was missing. Fry pork chop at med. high heat for 2-3 minutes on each side. The porks in the pic look thin and do not need to go in the oven. They will dry out.

Very tasty. FYI I covered 4 pork chops and still had breading mix left over. I also baked them for 1/2 the time suggested and they were still a bit over cooked. This recipe is definitely for big thick cuts of pork.

I had thin chops so I cooked them too long.  But these were so good!  And I LOVE not having to deal with any egg mess. I’ll definitely be making these again!
