I was skeptical of the crust. I thought for sure it would be too dry as it doesn't seem to come together very well. It held up very well and sliced beautifully. It is however too thick in my opinion. The ratio of crust to butter tart batter was half and half. So the actual butter tart flavour doesn't really have a chance to shine as it is taken over by the crust. I also greased the cake pan and glad I did. Baking times were right on the money. Thanks for sharing your recipe Sonrisa

May need to increase bake time to 30 minutes or a little more. Make sure Center isn't runny anymore. Otherwise, an awesome recipe! Easy, and really tasty! I didn't have brown sugar, so I used a cup of white sugar with one tbsp of molasses, and they still turned out perfect. Highly recommend this one.

Awesome recipe! I make it in a 9 x 13, 1.5x the base and 2x the topping, perfect! My kids hate nuts and raisins, so I once made a batch with neither in it, still excellent and the picky eaters loved it. Base is a little dry but don't be fooled, it bakes just fine.
