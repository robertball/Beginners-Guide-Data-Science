HOLY COW, these are the best cupcakes ever! We used chocolate devils food cake mix instead of white and just put what the box called for instead of the water and egg whites. Other than that, we followed the recipe. It wasn't at all messy, they were actually very beautiful! Just put a little spoonful of fluff, don't cover the cupcake completely. We also pushed in the hersey kiss completely. It leaves a nice little surprise on the inside!

Very Good, Very Very Sweet! I used yellow cake mix instead of french vanilla, I filled the cupcake tin about 1/4 full of cake batter, added 1tsp graham cracker crumbs, the hershey kiss and then pipped about 1 tsp of mashmellow fluff. I then covered all of this with more cake batter. This worked great because some of the fluff raised to the top of the cake and browned on top, giving it a real smore taste. I didn't add any more fluff to the top, these are really filling and sweet without, although I did top some of them with chocolate cream cheese frosting.

These were not easy the 1st time around.  I couldn't get the fluff to spread, and the graham cracker crumbs would stick to the fluff.  Very frustrating! But after the 3rd time around, I finally got it.  I like the others used the recipe on the box. Didn't put the crumbs on top.  Now the trick!  Put the fluff in the microwave for 15 seconds, stir and put in for another 15 seconds.  This makes it so much easier to spread!  I used less than a tsp. and it worked wonderful.  Then I put the crumbs on the top of the fluff.

These are the best cupcakes.  I've made them 3 times already and everyone 
loved them.  For the lady who said the marshmallow stuck to the pan, I always 
took the cupcakes out of the pan before putting the marshmallow on them.  It's not necessary to put them back in the oven as the marshmallow will melt overnight anyway.  Plus, you don't have to put so much graham cracker crumbs all over.  These were hard to make the first time, but after 3 times, it's a lot quicker.

They are messy so plan to have plenty of napkins around!!

I think I read almost all of the reviews before tackling this recipe.  I ended up making it 3 different ways because I couldn't make up my mind as to which I would like the best.  I made the batter as written with the kiss.  After baking, I piped marshmallow cream onto several cupcakes and sprinkled with graham crumbs.  Then I  placed them under the broiler until slightly toasted.  I let the other cupcakes cool and then piped some with more marshmallow cream topped with a piece of graham cracker and mini chocolate chips. And finally, I topped a few with chocolate frosting, marshmallows and a piece of graham.  The ones with the toasted marshmallow are by far our favorites.  The cupcake part is really good, moist, and we could definitely taste the graham cracker in it.  Overall, this was a good recipe, one to use some creativity and play around with a little bit. Update: The day after I made these, the marshmallow cream had completely run off the cupcakes that I cooled and then added the cream.  I would definitely broil the marshmallow cream after adding.  Those are still pretty and delicious!

My daughter and I made these cupcakes and had fun doing it and they taste great!!.. We only changed one thing and that is we used the whole egg instead of just egg whites.. the trick to the marshmellow and graham crackers staying on the top is to NOT fill the muffin tin so much they will be taller than the muffin tin when baked.. we made 32 cupcakes with the recipe..

What a wonderful, yummy change on the old standard cupcake. I made two batches, one chocolate, the other vanilla. The chocolate were good, but the vanilla were wonderful. Instead of using plain graham crackers, I crumbled up a keebler pie crust, and did add more than what the recipe called for, both in the batter and for the topping. I also just followed the directions on the cake mix. Kids and adults gobbled these up!

I made these for my daughters class. They almost didn't make it to school. My husband and co-workers loved them and my husband told me this was a keeper.  The marshmallow melted just enough into a little puff and made them look fun to eat.  Used boxed butter cake and worked fine.

I was quite disappointed by this recipe.  I was looking for something different to take to a potluck that the kids would like, and no one touched them!  The marshmallow topping melted and made a sticky mess.  Won't make these again.

This recipe is very clever and a neat idea but I ended up throwing away about half of them after a week of nobody eating them.  I think they were a little dry and it might be better if the chocolate was melted throughout the cake.

I made a couple tweeks when I made mine. First, I used a homemade devil's food cake recipe for the batter. Second I added 1/4 cup of graham cracker crumbs to the recipe instead of the 2 tbls. I also didn't do the chocolate kiss in the middle, since I used a chocolate batter. Overall I thought it was an o.k. recipe. I could barely taste the graham crackers. I decorated mine with the leftover graham cracker crumbs and then shredded chocolate. Ohh, and I also immediately put mine in the freezer for about 5 minutes after icing them for the fluff to harden so it wouldn't run. It worked like a charm. But I would recommend keeping them refrigerated because once the fluff starts to heat back up it will start to run again. Also, I think next time I am going to fill the cupcakes with fluff ... Maybe it will add a little more to them. I am also contemplating making a graham cracker pie like crust on the bottom of the cupcake instead of mixing it into the mix to see if that would make the graham crackers stand out a little more. Anyway, this recipe definitely inspired me and with a few changes could be great.

Quite interesting. I made them earlier in the day and the fluff kind of dripped over the sides. I took some more of the crushed grahm crackers and sprinkled it over the marshmellow for an added effect

These cupcakes were delicious and pretty easy to make with a few modifications. 

1) To simplify, I made the cake mix according to the package instructions. 

2) I put 3 mini marshmallows at the bottom of the cupcake liner before adding the batter. During baking, the marshmallows melted into the batter, giving the french vanilla cake mix a delightful marshmallow flavor. 

3) Based on the other reviews, I put a layer of graham cracker crumbs into the batter. Next time I bake these, I will layer more crumbs in the batter and put less on top--the thick top layer prevented any topping from sticking. 

4) Halfway through baking I popped some mini marshmallows on top of each cupcake. This enabled them to sink into the cupcake a bit rather than falling off the graham cracker crumbs. 

5) I drizzled some chocolate syrup on top--the kiss in the middle just isn't enough chocolate to give a true s'more flavor. 

I recommend serving immediately. I made mine the night before an event, and while they were still delicious, they are better when the kiss in the middle is still melted.

These are delicious cupcakes,and such a fun treat for kids! I chose to follow the package directions for the cake mix rather than using what is called for here.  Also, I didn't feel like 2 tablespoons of graham cracker crumbs was enough in the batter to give it that graham flavor so I doubled the amount to 4 tbsp. I had a lot of chocolate chips i wanted to use up so I put those in the cupcakes rather than chocolate kisses and I think it worked out just fine. Broiling the marshmallow topping is a great idea IMO because that gives it the s'more flavor.  I'm giving 4 stars for the idea and basic directions...5 stars if you go ahead and double the amount of graham cracker crumbs and use the cake mix directions.  Thanks for sharing this recipe :)

These were yummy!  I didn't get my Graham crackers crushed real fine but it was nice having bigger bits in the cake. I also just out marshmello on as each person ate them.  I didn't want a sticky mess. I did out the Graham crackers on top when baking them.  If the kiss would have melted I would have given them 5 stars.  They were still a hit and I will make them again I am sure. Thanks!

I thought these were Excellent. They really do taste just like s'mores. My hint to putting on the fluff is this. I put my fluff in a disposable decorating bag. I used a star tip and just swirled a dollop on top of the cup cake. Then baked for one minute as the recipe says. I found it worked out great no sticky mess.

These cupcakes are awesome! I made them for my daughter to take to school for her birthday and everyone LOVED them! The teacher even sent home a note asking for the recipe! I used the french vanilla cake mix, and pretty much followed the recipe. I also piped the marshmellow creme on at the end and put them back in the oven under the broiler just till they were slightly browned. YUM:)

These are cupcakes from the box so of course they are good HOWEVER these were nothign like smores at all-hence the 3 stars. Not enough chocolate, cant taste the graham cracker crumbs and the fluff didnt work that well either. This is what i will do next time: Use chocolate mix, add a ton of coarsely chopped graham crackers to the mix, and add mini marshmallows and chocolate chips on top instead of the fluff.

Delicious! I made one batch following the recipe exactly; with the second batch, I put the marshmallow fluff inside of the cupcake along with the chocolate, which I think I like a little better. Also, I did not use nearly as much fluff and graham cracker as the recipe called for--I think I used about 2/3 of a jar and three crumbled crackers.

These were mediocre. I followed the recipe, except I used whole large marshmallows on top and melted them in the oven for a few seconds, to avoid the marshmallow creme mess. This was successful. I also used about 1 TBS. milk choc. chips per cupcake instead of kisses, because that's what I had on hand. 

I would recommend adding a tsp. vanilla to the cupcake batter. The one other thing that I think might have improved mine would have been to use the kisses, as that would have given a nice chunk of chocolate. The chocolate was the best thing about them. Just make regular smores....

Great recipe and definitely use your imagination! After reading numerous reviews about the marshmallow icing, I cheated and bought the Marshmallow Brownie topping, popped it in the microwave and drizzled it on top. It hardened when it cooled and still tasted great.  I also didn't put the kiss in the middle. Instead I used chocolate icing and made chocolate curls to add on top.  Another idea for the graham cracker is to use 100 calorie Fudge Shoppe Grahams Right Bites, mini-graham crackers with chocolate on one side. One pouch pounded out is 2T to use inside the cupcake and then use them whole to put on top.  Have fun with this recipe and see what works for you :)

Overall a solid recipe!  I used peanut butter cups instead of kisses.  And I broiled mini marshmallows on top instead of fluff.  I'm not sure if I did something wrong though with the graham cracker crumbs because they just sort of fell off the cupcake when I took a bite.  But I'm really happy with the flavor!  Word of caution-  watch the marshmallows carefully if you choose to broil because they can burn quickly.  Had to scrape them off and do again.

Pretty tasty. The graham cracker crumbs that were crumbled on top spilled all over and I had a hard time spreading the marshmallow creme, but overall they were delicious!

Very tasty! Only hard part about this recipe is getting the marshmallow fluff on top nicely. I think maybe an actual marshmallow on top and melted would be easier. But otherwise a great recipe!

These were fantastic!!  Definately will give you the taste of a s'more.  I made mini cupcakes and with every bite you get a little piece of chocolate-so yummy.  Followed directions except used 1/2 of a marshmallow on some to compare (definately easier than scooping out fluff) but both were good. Will definately make again SOON!!  I had so much batter left after making 10 full size 12 mini cupcake that I even make a s'more cake!!  MOIST cake not dry like another reviewer stated.  I could go on and on........

These were a huge hit for my daughter's birthday party at home and at school. The kids all loved the idea of eating the s'mores as cupcakes, and I ended up making some with chocolate cake as well, which were terrific!  Definiately a keeper!

These tasted great straight out of the oven, and at that point were worth the mess and fuss of the marshmallow creme that stuck to everything (even following some of the suggestions posted).  However, once cooled and stored, they weren't that good and the flavors didn't blend together.  The creme was an even bigger mess after they had been stored 24 hours.  I probably won't make these again.

Made these for my boss's birthday.  She loves s'mores so I was trying to come up with a way to make a cake with chocolate, graham crackers and marshmallow.  This was perfect.  I did bake the cake according to the recipe on the box, however I used applesauce instead of the vegetable oil.  I also added more graham cracker crumbs to the batter.  I used the individual heart shaped cupcake tins and only filled them half way so they wouldn't bake up over the edge.  I had no problem with the marshmallow running the next day or in the oven.  I used Marshmallow Fluff and just put a small spoonful in the center.  I also tried using the Truffle Hershey's Kisses and they were phenomenal.  My boss absolutely loved these as did everyone else that tried them!  Will definitely make again.

This recipe was soooooo good! It was actually easier then I thought it would be after reading some of the other reviews. That one about using hot water for the fluff definitely helped a lot!! I used the devils food cake and I'm not really a chocolate cake fan but I enjoyed these. In one batch I followed the recipe and they turned out good. In another batch I put miniature marshmallows and half a Hershey kiss in the middle, and put in 3tbs of graham cracker crumbs in the batter. I think the second batch turned out just a little better. I brought in 4 dozen to work and came home with 5! They were a big hit... Thanks for the great recipe!! :)

I used this recipe and added 1/2 graham crackers meal and three whole eggs.  It can be made with a Spice cake too ... very similar taste.  I used Rick's Buttercream, Caroline's Fudge frosting, pretzels, Red Sanding sugar and atomic Hot Cinnamon flames.  It was a blast to make!

This made a nice, moist cake. I did alter it, though. I used yellow cake mix and added a tsp. of vanilla and used considerably more graham cracker crumbs inside the cake as well as using 2 whole eggs. I used semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of kisses. I did microwave the marshmallow cream to glaze the cake, and it spread fine, but marshmallow topping always makes a huge mess. All in all, I did really like the flavor of the cake. Maybe there is a recipe for a marshmallow flavored buttercream type icing.

Too much work and results not what I expected...just tasted like vanilla cake with a 'not-so-melted' kiss on the inside :)  Although I'll be honest, this recipe with revisions has a LOT of potential...

They were okay, nothing special. They tasted like regular french vanilla cupcakes with chocolate inside. I probably wont make them again since my little brothers didnt even bother trying them.

Easy to make, and tastes great.  Downside is the fluff is super messy.  Otherwise kids enjoyed them.  Made them for my sons birthday party in school.

My family members that tried them seemed to love it but me being a crazy perfectionist thought they were just ok.  I thought one chocolate kiss wasn't enough so I used 4 and they didn't melt.  it was also difficult putting the marshmallow on the cupcake.  I have a tube i use to frost cupcakes so i tried using that and it wouldn't stick so i tried using just a spoon to put it on then that was difficult as well since it wouldn't stick.  I'd probably try it again and make some changes like using a regular hershey chocolate bar instead of the kiss.

This recipe disappointingly did not work for me.  The marshmallow and graham cracker topping was a real ugly mess, and they just didn't taste very good. I did like the chocolate kiss center though.

I thought these cupcakes were pretty good and the kids loved them.  The cake part was a little dry, but my main problem was that I made them the night before, waiting for them to cool, then put them on a cardboard tray and covered them.  The next morning the marshmallow fluff had thinned and ran down the sides of the cupcakes making quite a mess.  Only half of the fluff was left on the cupcakes.  Did I do something wrong?

I made this for my son's fall festival class and the kids loved it. My son likes it so much he has it for breakfast. Though the recipe claims to make 24 cupcakes, I think you can actually make 28-30 cupcakes.

This recipe was great!  Although I altered it...I used a boxed butter recipe yellow, followed the box directions except increased the butter to a full stick and added 1 cup of graham cracker meal.  Put the marshmallow fluff in the microwave for 40 seconds and poured it into my piping bag.  Put the piping bag in the refrigerater while the cupcakes were baking.  Once the cupcakes came out of the oven, cut out a hole in the center using an apple corer and filled the hole with Hershey's milk chocolate chips that were at room temperature. Turned the broiler on with the rack in the middle.  Piped the marshamallow creme on top of the cupcakes, immediately put them under the hot broiler to "toast" the marshmallow. Delicious!  Chocolate was melted, cupcakes tasted like graham cracker and marshamallow was toasty!  My kids liked them so much, they both wanted them for their birthdays instead of their usual favorites.

I took this idea and adapted it alittle bit. I used DEVILS FOOD CAKE MIX, like one reviewer suggested and instead of using the candy kisses, I used chocolate chips. I also, make a graham cracker crust for the bottom of the cupcakes. Overall, the cupcake turned out great. HOWEVER, I topped it with the Marshmellow creme and it was A MESS!!!! I had a difficult time getting the creme unto the cupcake and it left them GOOEY!!!! Plus, it runs all over the place. In the end, it looked like a kindergartener made them.

These were really good, but I wanted more graham cracker taste in the cupcake, so I used 6 tbsp of graham cracker crumbs.  I also switched the filling and the frosting- the cupcakes were going to be outside and I didn't want the marshmallow creme to melt off.  For the frosting I made chocolate buttercream.  Yum!

I made these in my silicone mini muffin pan and baked for 15 minutes. At the end I turned the oven to broil and the marshmallow got a little toasted.  Really yummy, except I wish it had more graham flavor in the cupcake.  I will make these again, but add more crushed graham crackers to batter.

Loved this recipe !  The only change I made was filled  the cupcake about half full, then put the chocolate in with about a tsp of graham cracker crumbs, then filled with more batter. Baked and then iced. Well actually I made these for my daughter's 7th Camp out party and the kids iced and decorated them !  They had a blast and they tasted really good !!

I made the cupcakes exactly as the recipe stated.  I made them for a campout birthday party for my daughter.  The kids thought they were neat, but most of the kids didn't eat the icing part and some even left the cupcake.  I thought the cupcake was fine.  It would probably be awesome straight from the oven with the kiss inside being nice and warm.  They were great for the novelty idea of s'mores - but as a cupcake, they weren't what I was looking for.

I have to agree with other reviewers that there's not enough chocolate and working with the marshmallow fluff is very difficult.  I also made the cupcakes as directed on the cake package and used about 3 full graham crackers.  The final taste wasn't worth the trouble they took.

I used chocolate cake mix and followed the instructions on the box.  After the marshmallow topping looked a little toasty, I removed from the oven and let it cool just a few minutes.  Then, I added a piece of a Hershey's bar to the top - it helped the presentation and the taste!

These tasted good, but were so messy.  I made these the night before a bake sale and the marshmellow fluff on top oozed alover the the cupcake and wrapper. They were the only sad lonely baked good left at the end of the sale.  Next time I may try putting a marshmellow inside (as the chocolate was while baking) and use chocolate frosting instead. . .

These were alright but nothing I would make again.The graham crumbs fell off the top and made a mess.The marshmellow on top made them hard to remove from the pan.The kids did eventually eat all of them but it took awhile.

So good! I used Hershey bar pieces for the chocolate and instead of marshmallow cream I topped with marshmallows & broiled them for a toasty finish. Also drizzled on some hot fudge. Kids loved it!

While these were not bad, I don't think they tasted anything like a s'more.  The graham cracker taste was completely absent, and the toasted marshmallow stuck to my teeth.  I will not be making these again.

I made these for my boyfriends Birthday. lots of work! a bit dry from the graham cracker crumbs( i did add a whole package to the cake batter) & i fallowed the cake directions. also marshmallow fluff was a pain to work with & it did slide off the tops in the oven but it was easy to fix once the fluff was a little hard. also instead of using kisses i used a regular Hershey bar & broke up the little squares & put 1 1/2 in the middle. perfect amount of chocolate & it melted perfectly & made the middle moist. it would have gotten a 5 stars if it wasnt so much work. the dryness was my fault. i do plan on making them again & now i know what to do to make them better. also i made a chocolate/peanut butter frosting. yummy! & topped it all off with a piece of graham cracker & a chocolate square. looked pretty until the chocolate square melted :(

These cupcakes were ok. The cake was a little bland, I think I would make from scratch next time, the kiss in the middle didn't melt and was still hard, and the fluff wouldn't stick to the graham crackers! Worth another shot but I would maybe use chocolate cake next time and omit the chocolate kiss.

I don't think the flavor was close to a s'more at all. I would recommend using a chocolate cake mix and adding more graham crackers ... that might get it a little closer.

These cupcakes are very good, but the marshmallow creme pulls off the cupcake even though it is baked on.  Maybe next time I will sprinkle the graham crumbs around the outside of the cupcake and leave the center plain, so that the creme will stay on after it is baked.  I will definitely try them again.

These were alright, but nothing special. It didn't taste much different than regular cake mix cupcakes.

I thought these were very good, I might next time use a different kind of Chocolate other than the Hershey Kisses, that was the only thing that did not go well with this recipe.

These were fun. They were a bit dry. The kids loved finding the chocolate kiss inside.

I made these the night before and by the next morning, a lot of the fluff had run down the sides. The flavor was good ( I used devils food cake and followed the box directions) but I couldn't really taste the graham. Also, the fluff was hard to work with-- really messy! Overall, yummy but more trouble than they're worth.
