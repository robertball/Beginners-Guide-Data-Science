This is an excellent recipe. I added a little lemon juice, all the stems and 1/2 cup of parmeson cheese. With all the stems being used, you'll have some left over. It made a wonderful spread on slices of french bread. Just bake at 350 until crispy.

I also pre-cooked my mushroom caps so they would become waterlogged once stuffed. Place on cookie sheet with bap side up and brush with olive oil. Roast at 400 degrees for 6-7 min, or until they are golden and liquid begins to seep out. Place cap side up on papertowels and seal in airtight container until ready to use. 

Pre-cooking does a wonderful job at keeping the mushrooms from becomming watery, gooey messes.

This is an easy recipe if you like things on the bland side.  I made this twice, first time by the recipe and it was rather dry and tasteless. The second time I omitted the garlic salt and used fresh garlic and salt and pepper.  Then a dash of parsley, about a Tbsp+ of mayo, 1/4 cup shredded parmesan, ALL of the mushroom stems minced up, and about 1 Tbsp lemon juice and with all the additions it increases the size of recipe so you need more mushrooms.  Now the next time I make it I will try doing just what I said but will omit the parmesan and increase the crab.  Nevertheless now its a great recipe!!  thanks for the base you offered to start with but definately needs a kick.

I wanted a crab stuffed mushroom that was simple and easy, and this recipe fit the bill perfectly. I did make just a few additions though. Firstly, I used herb and garlic seasoned cream cheese and skipped the garlic salt. Secondly, because I used canned crab and I was concerned it might be "fishy", I added a teaspoon of lemon juice and a small amount of lemon zest. The lemon was the first thing everyone commented on and they all thought it really complemented the other ingredients.

Pretty good recipe, but lacking something.  Filling needs more zip.  I might try again adding Old Bay Seasoning or something instead of or in addition to garlic salt.  Overall, easy to do and attractive, tasty results.

After reading the other reviews I modified the recipe and was very happy with the results.  I used spinach/artichoke flavored cream cheese, 2 cans of crab, 1/2 c parmesan, lemon juice and zest, minced garlic, salt and pepper, and all the stems.  I have a lot more filling than mushrooms but that's OK!  I also put the filling into a Ziploc bag and cut off a corner to fill the mushrooms, this made it really easy. I baked them on a broiler pan since there were several comments about extra liquid and I hate soggy mushrooms. I also pre-cooked the mushrooms like one reviewer suggested.  Turned out great and were a hit at the party!

I brushed the mushrooms with garlic spread and added 1 cup of shredded cheese (Italian mix) to the stuffing.  I topped with italian bread crumbs and right before serving, more italian shredded cheese.  These are the best stuffed mushroom we've ever had!

Flavor was good, though not as flavorful as I'd hoped. I forgot the garlic salt, but sprinkled the top with a parmesan/bread crumb mixture. It made more stuffing than we had mushrooms for, so we had the rest on crackers. I think I prefer it as a spread than stuffing for mushrooms.

fABULOUS! To this I added a few slices of bacon that I prepared on a rack in the oven (reducing the fat content). I also incorporated some chives in one batch and got rave reviews. The nice thing about this filling is that the leftover can be backed in a crock until bubbly and offered as a spread for very plain crackers.

I liked these quite well. I liked that this recipe did not have chopped up stems in the stuffing....I dont see the point of stuffing a mushroom with MORE mushroom. I have never made stuffed mushrooms before- and simply purchased a box of mushrooms which was not good. The small mushrooms are VERY difficult to work with. Best to go to a market where you can hand pick the larger ones, because the stems pop out easier.

These were really great, however even when I doubled the filling 36 mushrooms were still about 10 too many. I did omit the minced stems as I see stuffing mushrooms with mushroom redundant, and I scooped out a good portion of the gills from each 'shroom so that could he the reason for the extra. I also followed some tips provided by other reviewers. I had planned on using fresh garlic instead of garlic salt anyway, but I also followed the tip to add a little mayo and must say that I feel if I hadn't they would have been the bland "something missing" mushrooms that others mention. So, I highly recommend adding 1tbs to the filling (I used 2 since I doubled the filling). I didn't have parsley on hand, but believe next time I might try some chopped green onions. I also topped each mushroom with a small pinch of shredded cheddar cheese before popping them in the oven,  and I only need to bake for 15 min, when I left a batch in for 20 they began to break down. When my sister tried them she said they were better than the stuffed mushrooms served at her favorite Chinese buffet, so I'd say they're good. :)

This might have turned out if the frozen canned crab meat didn't have shell in it!  It wasn't cheap and I bought it at a fine butcher shop so I don't know if there is any better type to buy.  Only a few mushrooms were eaten.

Hmm. Ran into problems making this one. The filling turned out runny, and the mushrooms soggy from their juices. The hubby however cheerfully inhaled the whole tray full, so I will be making this again. Next time I think I will put less filling in each mushroom, and add cheese on top

These were great! I took the advice of another reviewer and cooked the mushrooms first to get out some of the moisture.  Then stuffed them. I used real garlic instead of garlic powder. Put a little parmesean on top and popped it into the oven.  They got rave reviews from everyone.  We even had enough for dip on the side. We ate them with cut up veggies and some veggie chips.

I was looking for The Keg's Mushroom Neptune, and this recipe was very similar. I used the larger mushrooms, and baked them first as advised in another review, (remove stems, brush tops with alittle Olive Oil,place caps side up and bake @ 400 for about 10 mins or until most of the water has seeped out on to the pan. place on paper towels and let cool completley and place in air tight container until ready to use).
I cant imagine the water if i did not do this step. Make sure you take the time to bake them first. I will change this receipe up a bit and use only 1/2 the cream cheese amount, but the same amount of crab meat and use more spices, just too bland, missing something, and i will use smaller mushrooms,but its a great recipe to get going.

This was a really good base recipe. I did cook the mushrooms in oil by themselves for about 7 minutes but they kinda flattened out. Instead of regular cream cheese, I used a cream cheese onion and garlic blend. Really good! Great recipe to kinda make your own

This was very easy - I did not have canned crab, so I used the imitation and it was fine. I also added some lemon pepper and Old Bay. I made them an hour ahead of time and put them in the fridge. I baked them for about 7 minutes longer.

Great recipe. I changed it a little and with a pound of mushrooms added about 1/4 cup of italian bread crumbs. I don't like mushrooms and this made it not so strong tasting.

Super fantastic recipe! I did make a few chances. I added garlic plus spice with fresh garlic and I added chives. My husband ate it up. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I purchase crab at local Asian market you can get a huge 16oz can for for what it cost per lb fresh, here in MI it's $9.99lb. Omit garlic salt and used chopped green onion, fresh lemon juice, and Kroger 5 blend parm cheese.
