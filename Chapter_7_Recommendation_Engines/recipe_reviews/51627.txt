Like Broccoli...Love Pesto but I did not care for this dish....I agree with another reviewer too much garlic!  And If using a food processor start blending solid ingredients first then add broth and olive oil.  Will not be making again :(

too much garlic-would make again but probably half a clove instead of the suggested one large clove-my husband seemed to like it though and cleaned his plate. i added halved tiny cherry tomatoes, sprinkled with parmesan cheese and served with garlic bread sticks.
