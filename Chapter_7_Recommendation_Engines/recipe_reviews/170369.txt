s written this was bitter and had no depth of flavor. Personally I would like to see garlic ginger some sugar and some chili flakes or chili garlic paste. Sorry but this just wasn't to our tastes.

I used freshly squeezed oranges for the juice, half a lemon to augment the orange.  I used soy sauce but also added brown sugar, crystallized ginger, a little onion powder, and lemon pepper.  I have pork chops in a 24 hr. soy sauce/hemp oil marinade just waiting for this reduction.  P.S.  Hemp oil has a natural nuttiness that adds to the dishes complexity.

I really liked this sauce. I added brown sugar. I also added cornstarch to thicken it. And it turned out fabulous. I will make it again.
