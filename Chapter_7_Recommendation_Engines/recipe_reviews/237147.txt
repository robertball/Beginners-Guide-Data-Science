This recipe was fantastic!! I actually doubled the batter recipe to fit my largest springform pan and made my own graham cracker crust verses buying a premade one. I did have to alter the cooking time due to doubling the batch, so please watch the timing, I believed it safely baked for 50-70 minutes as I checked on it quite often. **When using the orange extract, I used Lorann Professional Kitchen Orange Bakery Emulsion and needed 3 teaspoons when I doubled the batch and tripled the coloring affect for a more vibrate pop of color with in the batter. Everything else was to a T. My husband is harder to please when it comes to cheesecakes because he likes just plain. Will eat a chocolate or Bailey's flavored but this one, won him over big time and once cut and served....didn't go to far and was gone rather quickly. Will totally make again and again. TY so much, wished you could have seen the "dreamsicle" faces that I got when everyone was enjoying this recipe.

Lots of praise for the cook with this one! Not a heavy, dense cheesecake, but light and luscious. It's a fitting happy ending for just about any meal. Mine was perfectly baked at 30 minutes. For those who want to make their own crumb crust, one sealed packet of graham crackers, crushed, combined with 5 Tb melted butter, baked at 350 degrees for 8 minutes, makes just the right size/thickness of crust for a 9" pie pan. Prebaking the crust lends a pleasant crunch. I replaced the sugar with 3/4 cup Splenda, as I find that with baked goods, it takes more to ensure the proper degree of sweetness. It was just sweet enough, without being cloying. Guests didn't realize they were eating a low sugar dessert (not completely sugar free because of the graham crackers.) They were doubly delighted when they found out! With that substitution, it makes an excellent dessert for diabetics. The filling as written comes right up to the top of the pie pan. The flavor is fresh and perfectly tangy. I used 6 drops of yellow and 3 drops of red food coloring, which made for a pastel orange color, reminiscent of an actual creamsicle.  A lovely, easy-to-make dessert that's a sure-fire crowd pleaser.

I made my own crust as well. I also used orange zest instead of extract. It came out wonderful. I also didn't do the food coloring.

This recipe was a good "jumping off" point, but definitely needs some tweaking. There wasn't enough orange flavor for my taste. The orange was so mild, it was more of an after-taste. And the food coloring called for in the recipe only created the merest hint of food color. (But, I do understand that some people prefer no food coloring, so that's OK.) 

The next time I make this, I'll add freshly grated orange zest for a more intense orange flavor, use more of the filling for the orange, so there will be a nice layer of the orange cream on the top, and will probably add more food coloring to make a more intense orange color -- especially if the grandchildren are visiting. A nice touch would be topping each slice with a slice of fresh orange.

I just made this and it was delicious. I took the advice of other reviewers and added 2 Tbs of orange zest. I gave it 4 stars because if I didn't add the zest I think the orange flavor would have been too weak. Tasted exactly like an orange creamsicle!! Everyone loved it!

This is a really good summer cheesecake! I followed the suggestions of another baker and upped the orange extract by 1/2 tsp. and added 1and 1/2 tbs of orange zest.

My husband is a huge fan of cheesecake and creamsicles, so this couldn't get any better for him. I made it for Father's Day and it was a hit. 
I made three and had none left over. Will definitely make this again!

The Cheese cake turned out delicious . It could have had a little more orange flavor.  I will put more orange extract next time.

This is my most requested dessert when I bake for family holidays. The only thing I do different is to add 1 or two teaspoons of freshly grated orange zest to the batter. Really gives a fresh, orange zing!

This is a great recipe for a quick cheesecake.  I used orange extract (adjusted the amount) and the zest from an orange.  A home-made graham cracker crust is a must to do justice to the finished product.

very good.  I would add more orange extract though, for the Creamsicle flavor.  Otherwise it's a very good cheesecake with a hint of orange.

Not sure about this one. I used orange zest in addition to flavouring and made a chocolate crust. I also decorated it with candied orange slices. There was nothing really wrong with it, more just didn’t wow or inspire me to say I’d make it again.

I was craving a creamsicle cake and I found this recipe. I was so excited to try this because I know I can make it sugar free and the recipe is super simple! It turned out AMAZING!! My craving is totally satisfied and my husband enjoyed it too. I don't use sugar, I use Truvia cooking sugar substitute. I don't eat sugar and my husband is diabetic. I made my own crust with Arrowroot baby cookies and one graham cracker and followed the cheesecake crust recipe, but I cut the Truvia to 1/8 cup. Then for the cheesecake I didn't use food coloring. I don't need the color since it's just for the family. I added orange zest and more vanilla extract because the orange extract is too strong for my taste. I love how it turned out! Moist and creamy and you can't even tell it's sugar free! I will be making this again!
