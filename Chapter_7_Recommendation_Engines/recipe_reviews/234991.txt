This was delicious!
I didn't realize it was for the crock pot until way too late, so i cooked it all on the stove in about half and hour. I tossed three cloves of garlic in with the carrots, potatoes, and cauliflower, then drained most of the water after cooking, and mashed the whole thing with a potato masher. Worked like a charm!
I added the cooking liquid back in (I needed about 1.5 cups), added a cup of frozen corn, tossed in about a teaspoon of curry powder (mm mm mmm), and let it cook for about 20 minutes over medium/low heat before adding the cream cheese. 
It was delicious! My husband couldn't eat it fast enough!

One of the best soups I've ever made. After reading the review about it being too chunky I simply took half of it out of the pot and used my immersion blender then added it back in. This smoothed it out quite a bit. I also added a clove of garlic because we love garlic in everything. We are veg so I subbed cream of celery soup for the cream of chicken and veggie broth for bouillon. It was delicious. We'll be making a lot of this over the winter. I think you could use any type of potato, not just red.

Loved this!  We are making it for the second time tonight, because I have been craving it all week.  I left out the cream cheese and bacon in an effort to make this a little healthier, and it was great.

Soup was delish and easy to make. My whole family loved it.
FYI.......Do Not Try using a hand mixer in the Crock Pot unless you enjoy cleaning soup off of your counter tops, windows and cabinets 10 minutes before your guests arrive!
I did get a good laugh at myself!

I made this pretty much sticking to the recipe.  The only thing I did different was omitted the bacon bits.  I instead cooked up some black pepped bacon and topped the soup with that and the cheddar.  This prevents soggy bacon.  I also made this stove-top, one pot clean-up.  At the end of the cooking time I used the immersion blender.  This was a wonderfully smooth and delicious soup.  This will be in my regular soup rotation.

Made it exactly according to the recipe.  Delish, everyone enjoyed this soup. I'll definitely make this again.  I did use an immersion blender when it was finished cooking.  Oh and you'll need to add salt to taste.  Maybe I'll add 2 cloves of garlic next time.

WOW! Is this ever good!!!!! YUMMO! Sautéed chopped onion and garlic then added veggies. Also added some rosemary. Used 4 med yellow potatoes and 10 baby carrots. Next time cut potatoes smaller 'bite size' and use more carrots. Blended 1/3 and added back in.  Thanks for an awesome recipe!!!!!

5 stars with some changes... I don't use canned soups, so I substituted a cup of cream, but half and half or crema would work, too. I made this all on the stove top. I used 1/2 an onion, diced and 2 cloves of garlic, diced, Sauteed in some butter and oil (your choice) until softened. Added diced carrots and potatoes, salt and pepper, dash of thyme and sauteed until vegetables were softened. Added milk and stock to cover and simmered until vegetables were tender. Added 3 cups frozen, riced cauliflower and continued simmering until thawed and tender. Added cream, cream cheese, bacon bits (reserved some for serving), additional liquid as needed and simmered until smooth. Added cheese off heat, stirred until melted. Stirred in parsley, adjusted seasonings, served topped with additional cheeses and bacon.Everyone loved it! SO wanted shredded chicken added next time!

Like many, I never used the slow cooker, I kept the same pot and yes, cooked way faster. I also added garlic to the cauliflower, carrots, etc. in the beginning when I was boiling everything... I did remove the vegetables after they had boiled, putting them into my food processor to puree them nice and smooth. You can see my photo submitted, it's in an off white bowl with spoon showing and checkered place mat, anyway.. I did replace the cream cheese with a 5oz container of cottage cheese to increase nutritional value and never once missed the cream cheese, I will say though, that I pureed the cottage cheese with the vegetables in the food processor so it was "snuck in,".. pureeing the vegetables is also a great way to hide vegetables in general.  Also used fat free milk..I Otherwise I followed the recipe except I kept the cheddar cheese and parsley separate, letting the person eating the soup determine how much topping they wanted to add.. I did add salt and pepper to taste at the end. Amazing soup, will make it again!

One could argue that I didn't really make this soup because I changed the recipe so much. I broke one my own rules of cooking by not reading the recipe ahead of time, "What? A crock pot?!" So it was made on stovetop in 30 minutes or so. And I don't use canned soup so just a veggie buillion cube. Pretty good with a salad and bread. Would make again.

Excellent soup especially for the cooler times of the year! I was pretty faithful to the recipe my only edits were sauteed onions in 2 tbsp butter and I used white potatoes since thats what I had on hand.And I forgot the cheddar cheese (didn't miss it) Also I can tell you the store bought real bacon crumbles work great and lend the perfect flavor. Since I was short on time I simmered on the stove top. Rich and delicious a keeper declared my husband. Our kids and I are having this right now for lunch! Kid approved!

I made it as written but it was too bland for us so I added salt and pepper, some Parmesan cheese along with the cheddar cheese and cream cheese.  I saved the rest of the water from boiling the vegetables after taking out the one cup and will use it for an other soup recipe.  I will make this again but it definitely needs salt, pepper and lots of sharp cheese for us.

I would have mashed the cauliflower bits so the soup is not so chunky. Also it's very thick, and these servings are huge! I doubled this recipe to 8 servings instead of 4, to take it to a church potluck. It would not all fit into my crockpot!

LOVED IT! Hearty, creamy and some texture!  Used the veg, added 2 minced cloves garlic, substituted 1/3 pkg onion soup mix and 1 tbsp. dehydrated onion and 1 box low sodium chicken broth. Used 2 strips maple bacon crisped and chopped. In crock put milk, cream of mushroom soup, bacon, and 4 cubes of laughing cow, 1/2 the simmered veg, and then pureed the remaining veg in the broth and added. Added parsley near the end, and shredded cheese and a green onion on the top to serve.

*Disclaimer* I had to improvise a bit as I didn't have all the correct ingredients. I used Yukon Gold instead of red potatoes (about 9 small potatoes). I cooked the cauliflower and potatoes in chicken stock and omitted the bouillon and water. I added Velveeta at the same time I added the cream cheese and substituted half and half for the milk. Also, was short on time so I cooked it stovetop instead of crockpot. It was delicious and I have barely one serving for leftovers. I will definitely be making this again! Thanks for sharing!

Really, really good. Whole family loves it! I'm a vegetarian so instead of the chicken bouloin/water, I used organic veggie broth. Instead of the cream of chicken, I used cream of celery. Making another batch today, will make more tomorrow for canning. Thanks! :)

One of the most flavorful, nutritious soups I've made.  If you don't have bacon on hand you could use some cooked sausage.  Excellent!

Pretty good the first day but way better the second   I added 1/2 tsp salt and pepper but still needed more when served. However I forgot the cheddar cheese so that might have been  enough

Kept out the milk and added more water making it more brothy, but kept the cream cheese and cream of mushroom.  Increased my yield.  This is a great soup.

When I told my family that I was making cauliflower soup, I did not get a good response. I made it stove top, added celery, real onions and cooked the cauliflower, carrots, onions, celery and potatoes in chicken stock. It was the best smell simmering. I added cream cheese and bacon bits and since my Texas men want meat, I threw in cooked chicken thighs. I smelled like chowder and was absolutely delicious.   I will make this in the future.

I used my instant pot and just threw all the ingredients in (substitutions/additions: used russet potatoes instead of red, and one half yellow onion) at one time, set it for 20 mins, and it came out perfect.  I used a potato masher to smooth it out.  I topped it with salt, pepper, cayenne pepper powder, and shredded sharp cheddar.

I made the soup as written, besides adding a bit more carrot. My husband said that basically it tasted like a can of cream of chicken soup. I was hoping for a stronger cauliflower taste. Delicious though. We served it in a bread bowl.  We also pureed this soup at the end.

Wow! The whole family really liked this soup. I made it as written. I used my immersion blender to make it more creamy and less chunky and would recommend that. Using bacon bits is great for convenience, but if I have time next time I might try frying bacon and crumbling it into the soup for bigger chunks. I also might try to figure out a substitute for the canned soup just to avoid processed food. However, it really is a very good soup as is.

I made it exactly as the recipe called for. But I lighted mashed the veggies together with the cream cheese & milk, plus I had to add 90% of the veggie water back in, only because I accidentally added the 1 cup of cheddar cheese to the mix, instead of at the end. So it became too thick & hence adding the water back in.  My crock pot was already in use with another recipe, so I cooked this dish on the stove top in a cast iron casserole.  I did cook the soup for another 1.5hrs  after I assembled all of ingredients. Turned out delicious. Next time I would add some garlic & perhaps some fresh ground black pepper for a little more zip.

My husband LOVED this recipe!  I made it last weekend and he asked me to make it again this weekend.  I used cream of mushroom (that is all I had in the pantry).  I also threw in some leftover chicken.  He said that was his favorite part.  This is a definite keeper!

This was to die for.  I used unsweetened coconut milk instead of milk because that's all I had.  Other than using chopped real onions as other reviewers recommended I stuck to the recipe.  Will make this again for sure.

Never had cauliflower soup before but this was REALLY good. I did it on the stove top and followed ingredients. However, I did add some garlic powder and extra cheese. Yummy soup!

This recipe is the best so far, I did do a few  changes, like I added a small onion, not flakes, and added a whole shallot, and I added some portobello mushrooms, And I did cook for 4hours in the crockpot, longer the better. Once done i could not get enough of the dish . My husband could have eaten the whole thing. Will definitely make this recipe again.

I didn't realize that it was a slow cooker recipe until I started cooking. But I cooked it on the stove in an hour, left out the bacon and parsley, and had rave reviews from my family.

Sure wish I had read all the reviews before I hauled out my crock pot. I, too had hoped to finish it in an hour and a half, tops. Halfway through prep, I saw that it 'needed' to go in a crock pot. Now it's in there for another 100 minutes while we have a frozen pizza for supper. Had I stuck with my stovetop pot, we would be digging in to some yummy, cheesy cauliflower right now.

I couldn't love it more! I used a sodium-free chicken bouillon packet instead of cube and almond milk. And I forgot the bacon. The second time it wasn't as good. I didn't cook anything on the stove first, maybe I should have done that. I also used a bag of cauliflower which gave me big chunks so next time I'll chop or blend the biggest pieces.

I don't feel like I can give it four, stars because i modified the recipe, so not fair for me to judge necessarily (thus my 5 star rating). I don't care for bacon so I omitted that, but did add about 12 oz. salmon. Tasty, but my guess is that for those of you who like bacon, that's probably just the richness that my version is missing. I like it, but I think next time i would sautee some onions. Also I have read that other people added garlic, and I could see garlic adding a lot too.

I did this totally on the stove top - it was so quick. I followed the advice of others and added some garlic and after I fried the bacon (didn't have bacon bits) and removed, I stirred in some flour and cooked it for a few minutes, then added the milk before adding it to the cooked veggie mix.  This eliminated the need for the canned soup, which I never buy. Thank you for sharing.

Pretty yummy on a cold winter's night!  Didn't use the cream cheese and it was plenty creamy, used half-and-half. I used a hand potato masher an hour before dinner and it worked just fine.   Added more salt and pepper to taste. Will for sure make  again.

Definitely a keeper! I needed my 6 quart  crockpot because I used a large head of cauliflower. I added 3 cloves of garlic and used 3 tsp. dried onion flakes not 2 tsp.  I kept the extra broth and added more as the time progressed. After 30 minutes in the crockpot, I removed 7 cups of veggies and used my immersion blender. Next time, I will use the blender on less veggies. Each person added the bacon and cheese to their own bowl at the end.  LOVED IT!

Actually cooked on the stove and just used potatoes and no cauliflower.  I sautéed the onion, carrots and celery in about 4 TBs of butter before I added the potatoes. Didn't use the soup base either.  Used lite cream cheese. After potatoes were soft, I used a masher and mashed some of the potatoes to thicken the soup.

Seriously good.  I did it on the stove and scooped out about half the cooking broth/water once the veggies were tender.  I used the immersion blender to make it thicker.  It needed salt, which I added, plus I love pepper so added some cayenne and black pepper.  Also, followed a reviewer's advice with a little bit of curry powder.   I didn't have fresh parsley, but took a risk with chopped arugula and love it (plus, seems healthier).  Topped with green onions.

Delicious!  Never had cauliflower soup before but got a good  price at a local  stand, so decided to make AND I'M SO GLAD I DECIDED ON THIS RECIPE!!  Husband who doesn't care for soups at all asked me to make again! Only difference is that I fried bacon instead of bacon bits and I added a hand full of corn which I had just taken off the cob to freeze! Loved it

This is an excellent recipe.  I have made it with ham diced very finely, with pork sausage crumbled & drained well and with bacon...each has been good.  My preference is ham.  I used cream of mushroom soup instead of chicken and I made my own rich chicken broth.  Also used fresh potato hash brown shreds.   Other than that, followed the recipe as printed.  It is a very rich meal soup.  My picky husband asked for seconds and ate leftover which by the way tastes even better the next day.

Excellent!! I used three cans of low sodium chicken broth instead of the water and bouillon. I didn't have bacon, but had just baked up a giant batch of breakfast sausages, so diced up one of them into the soup.  I used fresh onion and sautéed about 3 tbsp of it in about a tbsp of unsalted butter. And (oops!) I misread the recipe and used the entire block of cream cheese. I didn't move it into a crockpot. I just simmered it for awhile before adding a couple good shakes of dried parsley and using the immersion blender on all of it. I served it with optional grated cheddar cheese. My husband couldn't get enough of it. Neither could I! This is a keeper.

This was absolutely delicious with the additional of salt and pepper and some additional cheese sprinkled on top!  I stuck to the recipe and did not have any issues with it being too thick as others have noted.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

My husband made this with a few tweeks- he never follows a recipe without adding something . My family loved it so much that we made three different soups using this basic recipe-a broccoli version, creamy chicken and a seafood version. GREAT  recipe!!

Make it in the pressure cooker and use Campbell's chicken broth instead of water and bouillon cube for quicker results

Really creamy...yum... I had to do some substitutions. I didn't have bacon so I added smoked cheese. which turned out fabulous... I didn't have fresh carrots so I had to use canned... I also added celery and an extra can of cream of chicken.  So much flavor... yum!

With a few changes and added ingredients, this was great! It can be as thick or soupy as you prefer.

I put a huge cauliflower head in stems and all, six small Yukon potatoes,  3 bays leaves,  a sweet onion chopped cooked in EVOO, Old Bay Seasoning, Mace, Garlic Powder, bouillon, mustard powder,  then blended with hand blender.  Added a pound of shredded cheddar, and after that mixed a pint of heavy cream.  

Didn't have bacon. So, used mushrooms cooked in EVOO and garlic salt  topped with Balsamic vinegar then reduced in a little skillet, to make the garnish.

Salt & Ground Pink Pepper to taste.

I made a few changes and it was amazing! First off, i tossI didn't have time to use the crock pot, so instead I left everything in the pan, drained most off the liquid, and mashed the whole deal with a potato masher.

I made this recipe just about how it was written, with the exception of adding two mashed cloves of roasted garlic when the mixture went into the crockpot.  With a dash of salt and pepper after it was served (I let everyone decide how much they would like instead of adding it before it's served), it is an exceptional soup and so easy to throw together. My family loved it! Thx.

Made it tonight and husband, who is VERY picky, loved it! I'm a vegetarian so the only modifications I made were cream of celery soup instead of chicken and vegetable bouillon. I also added two cloves of chopped garlic as suggested. Will make again!

Loved this! I puréed it pretty well leaving only a few chunks and everyone thought it was just plain old comfortable potato soup. Will make again next time I've got more cauliflower than I know what to do with!

Wonderful! I made this as written other than adding 2 minced garlic cloves and using the immersion blender at the end. I definitely recommend using the blender- still leaving some larger chunks. Doing so thickens and improves the texture, as well as melds the flavors.  I love that this soup sneaks in a big vegetable.

I loved this!  Decrease the cream of chicken soup & cream cheese by 1/2 & blend the whole thing before putting it in the crockpot.  I don't like the fake meat in it- next time I would add roasted pumpkin seeds, green apple & cilantro.  (Nikki Dinki does this to squash soup and it's yummy!)

This was a huge hit with my family!  I snuck in 2 chicken breasts for protein, used bulb onions instead of onion flakes and substituted the Cream of Chicken soup with Cream of Celery(only to save a trip to the store) and it turned out delish!

Made it on this cold, snowy night! Love, Love, Love it! My fiance was a skeptic but declared this recipe a keeper!  I did have to add some canned chunk chicken for him....he's not a meatless kind of guy! Pretty much kept the rest of the recipe as written, although I started too late to do it in the slow cooker.  I simmered it on the stove top for a couple of hours.  I used low fat cream cheese, 98% fat free cream of chicken soup and skim milk to make it a little lighter.
