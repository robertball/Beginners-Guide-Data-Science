This was great!  So easy to prepare.  Used a 1lb. salmon at 400 degrees for 20 minutes and came out amazing.  Will defintely share this recipe and make again.

This was very disappointing.  The timing and temperature make for dried salmon.   I would recommend 20 minutes max. and perhaps 350 degrees cooking temperature.  I won't be making this version again.

This recipe is quick and easy. I served it on a bed of spinach and seasoned rice. Even my picky kids loved it!

I liked the sweet part, but it was too mustardy for my taste.  Amazing tho how all three flavors-sweet, mustard, sour-all came through.

This sounded good, but it didn't do anything for me.  Nothing special happened.  Kinda expect that with so few ingredients.  I was kinda nervous about the mustard powder.  It's pretty hot stuff.  After I made this, I checked the date because it was barely noticable.  Guess I should've paid more attention to the title - candied.  Yeah, it tasted like brown sugar with dry mustard on salmon.  :l  It is not similar to Asian Salmon by Lynseey, but that is a very good recipe.  Won't make this again.

My husband and 20 month old loved this!!  It was a bit too mustardy for my preference, but certainly nothing that would stop me from eating it nor making it again.  Thanks for a unique, but easy and tasty salmon recipe!

This was very good and a fast easy recipe. There were no conplaints but the next time I will alter it's cooking method, perhaps try it on the grill, because it was extremely juicy. The fish let out so much liquid, most of the flavor washed off in the juice. I had to spoon it back over before serving. Maybe it had to do with the freshness of the fish here locally in Oregon, or not, don't know.

This salmon was Super easy peasy and Delish!! I prepped it the night before. It made the dish a bit watery. Next time, and ( yes, there will be a next time ) , I will add the seasonings right before I bake it off. I sprinkled some kosher salt and pepper. Limes were cut up and put on the side for those who wanted them. Took it to a potluck and there was nothing left but the sugar pan!! And I used 2 filets. Thanks for sharing Mrs. UnionJack! Another keeper. Mmmmm
 6/9/12 UPDATE: I soaked cedar planks, slathered them with oil and set the fish with their Yummy coating all on the bbq. OMG I am sure the whole neighborhood got a good whiff of dinner. Good thing they didn't all show up! This is by Far, my favorite way to make salmon!! Sweet, smokie,  a little heat from the mustard. HEAVEN!! And the planks were soon cheap, hubby got them at the lumber yard 3 bucks for 10 ft plank cut down to 1 ft sections! Please try this!! Happy Summer All!

Dry mustard was a bad choice. Using Dijon mustard instead made the salmon great. This recipe leaves an after taste that’s not pleasing. I don’t rate foods low but this was an exception. Do try the Dijon mustard instead. You’ll be pleased with the results!
