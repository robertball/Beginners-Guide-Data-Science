I did make some changes to this recipe, based on what I thought needed to be done. For the meat mixture, I used 1/2 cup ketchup, 1/8 cup brown sugar, 1-1/2 cups crackers, added garlic powder and worcestershire.
Made only 1/2 the amount of glaze. Baked the loaf for 15 min. longer than recommended.
This was absolutely delicious, both hot and cold. I would make it again in a heartbeat, but only with my modifications. Thanks, Duano.

Sorry, but about the only thing positive I can say about this recipe is that it makes a nice moist meatloaf. This may have been a result of using butter crackers or maybe because I use beef/pork/veal for my meatloaves instead of ground beef. I also use only 1 egg instead of 2. The negative side is this recipe is way too sweet!!! All that sugar! I will use the cracker idea again, but that's it. I'll go back to my brown gravy instead. This tasted too much like a sweet sloppy joe.

I made this as written, warning Husband that other reviewers had found it too sweet. As someone who douses his breakfast bacon and sausage with maple syrup, he said he didn't mind. Of course, it turned out that it was indeed a touch too sweet for him (I personally couldn't eat more than half a mouthful). I'm gonna scrape the sauce topping off, and make it into sandwiches tomorrow. Other than the sweetness issue, this is a good recipe - the loaf held together nicely, and had a good general flavor.

HANDS DOWN THE BEST MEATLOAF ... EVER.  I've made this for years and it's wonderful. I use it in stuffed peppers too and it's the BOMB. I scale down the brown sugar and I work with the amount of meat I have. If you don't like sweet and savory combos -- don't try this. My kids know this as mom's meatloaf. They probably always will because I'll always make this one. It's just the best around. If you love Amish cooking and hearty, stick-to-your ribs food, you'll love this. If you want something healthier then get a back-up recipe with turkey or something and keep this one for special occasions. If you use less than 2 pounds of ground meat but all the sugar --- it's going to be too sweet. Don't skip the bacon -- it truly adds something & I now top my stuffed peppers with this glaze & strips of bacon. YUM. O.

Made this tonight for hubby as his grandmother passed away and I wanted to make him some comfort food. I am so glad that I read the reviews prior to making. I sauteed the onions in butter and cut the glaze in half. These were both good moves. This recipe does make a sweet meatloaf, so if that isn't your thing, consider yourself warned. This makes a very moist meatloaf and I think I would cut the cracker crumbs down to 2 cups. I added black pepper and garlic powder to the mixture. I would be tempted to add chopped green pepper. The glaze is good and I would consider making the full amount and use it for mashed potatoes. I served this with mashed potatoes and it was very good. This did take an extra 10 minutes to get thoroughly done. This is one of my more favorite meatloaf recipes from this site. Thank you.

I have made this numerous times and it is wonderful every time.  Only change I make is to omitt the baccon.  Made this recently in the crock pot as it has been over 100 degrees here the last week and we have been craving meatloaf.  Cooked it on low for 6 1/2 hours with 1/2 sauce on top.  Added rest of sauce and turned on high for an additional 30 min.  Moist and WONDERFUL.  If there were 10 stars I would give it every one!!!

This is the most incredible meatloaf recipe EVER! I have made it so many times that I have lost count.  My family LOVES it.  It always turns out great and is not a pile of mush like other viewers have written.  I think the quality of ground beef you use likely has something to do with whether or not it falls apart, so make sure you are using a high quality of beef.  I have had great success!

I have never ever liked meatloaf until I made this one. I used townhouse crackers ( one sleeve and 6 additional crackers), I halved the brown sugar in the meat mixture and used precooked bacon but left everything else the same. Everyone raved over it! It was so moist and flavorful I was shocked. I cooked mine for almost 2 hours ( free formed into a loaf in a roasting pan) and drained the grease before addding the glaze. I cannot wait to have a sandwich later with this! Thanks!!

This is a winner in my household. You know its good when my husband likes it better then his own mothers! I ommitted the bacon(just didnt have any, went light on the brown sugar, and put two slices of bread on the bottom of the loaf pan to suck up some of the grease - worked well. I think it helped with keeping the meatloaf together.  Will make again maybe when his mother visits :)

I LOVE this recipe!  My kids used to complain when I announced we were having meatloaf for dinner, but since I started making this they love it!For everyone who said the recipe is too sweet - it is an amish meatloaf, it is supposed to be sweet.  I don't think the sauce is at all too sweet, although it does make a lot of sauce. I pour some of the sauce over the veggies I bake with the meatloaf and it works out great.  The only change I make is to substitute the ketchup with half ketchup/half bbq sauce.  It gives it a really nice flavor!  Enjoy!!

The sweeteness was a nice change.
It was easy to prepare with normal ingredients on hand.

Made this tonight and everyone loved it! No one found it "too sweet", but actually liked the bit of sweetness that it had. I followed the recipe to the T and it turned out so moist and delicious. This one is a keeper!

As written I give this recipe 4.5 stars. Too sweet for my taste buds. I omit the brown sugar in the loaf altogether. I also would advise to cut down the sugar to a1/4 cup in the sauce. I used 1/2 cup last night and my husband and I thought it was just a bit too sweet still. The bacon is a must!! I cover the whole top with it which is 4 slices for me. :) I have 5 kids and we all enjoy it this way! Also, to keep your loaf from falling apart I recommend sucking some of the grease out while it cooks. otherwise all the grease will keep it from firming up a bit.
I will def. keep making this meatloaf with those 2 small changes! Awesome!

Very very very good.  I changed the serving size the first time I made it.  The conversions were totally wrong.  So I would just suggest not changing that and freezing whatever leftovers you have.  8 servings is a lot for just my husband and I.  It froze well.

I haven't read many reviews but I have to add my two cents. I've made this twice. First time I followed it almost exactly (I had to make homemade ketchup as I never buy the stuff) and it was wonderful!  Second time,  I added some spicy Italian sausage to the meat mix and used all BBQ sauce in place of ketchup and added a few drops of hickory smoke to the meat mix. I also omitted the bacon.and did not use any salt. My husband and I aren't into sweetish meat meals but this one (to us anyway) is NOT overly sweet like a few reviewers have stated.  The BBQ sauce gave the glaze a lovely dark and very shiny colour. I cooked and cooled it and left it  for one night in the fridge for the flavours to blend better and while the wait was a trial, it was WORTH it.  I will try NO OTHER meatloaf recipe now after years of testing many.  This is the Real Meatloaf McCoy.  Thanks, Duano.

It could have been how I made it, I put it in the crock pot for lack of timing later in the evening. I checked on it and kept sucking out any fat every hour or so. Cooked on high for about 5 hours, and then added the topping and cooked on low for about 45 minutes. It was good but really mushy, and maybe a little too much ketchup? I'd try it again with maybe 1 egg and less ketchup.

This was way to sweet for us however we did pan fry the leftovers for lunch the next day so it didn't go to waste.  I'm sure there are plenty out there that will like this one.

I didn't use all of the topping sauce as it makes a TON.  The meatloaf itself is amazing.  Very similar to the fantastic meatloaf my husbands grandma made.  My family of 5 ate the entire thing in one sitting. Even my son who doesn't eat much meat had 2nds!!

Best meatloaf recipe out there! Of course like others I made my own changes. Was told by a coworker/chef that meatloaf is made up with equal parts beef/veal/sausage, so I did that. Omitted the bacon and tweaked the ketchup glaze a little with extra mustard and vinegar for more kick! But I will say this was the best meatloaf I’ve ever had by far! And my coworker/chef agrees!

A GREAT recipe!  I was a little leary of the sweetness but after reading other reviews I decided to try it..  I'm really glad I did!  The glaze was very yummy and I can't wait to have some leftover for lunch.  My husband ate it but was not as thrilled by the sweetness as I was.  If you like glazed ham or sweet and sour dishes I think you will love this!!  Thank-you Duano:)

too sweet for me, I will cut the bacon up next time and place on top so that it will be easier when you cut the recipe in slices for serving also I will reduce the brown surgar to 1/4 cup next time to see if that helps the sweetness

This is probably the best meatloaf I have ever had. I was worried about the sweetness but it turned out wonderful and was well received by all who ate. I will be keeping this one. I won't change a thing.

My family and I really liked this meatloaf - I cut the recipe in half since no one is a huge fan of leftovers and it wasn't too sweet at all. I did forget to make the sauce though - a common mistake in my crazy house :)

After reading the reviews, I altered the recipe a bit to fit my families taste.  Firstly, I cut the recipe in half as I didn't need 8 servings.  I used 2/3 cup seasoned bread crumbs as I didn't have any crackers for crumbs.  A lot of people either omitted the bacon or complained that it didn't crisp up.  I decided to chop up the bacon and saute it with the onions instead of laying the bacon on top of the meatloaf.  I used 2 slices of bacon in the mix.  I also added some garlic salt, Worcestershire sauce, and pepper to the mix.    I omitted the vinegar from the topping as I know my husband would not have liked it.  All in all,we were really happy with this meatloaf.

I thought this was very good.  I used herb snack crackers.  My girlfriend thought the tomato glaze on top was a bit too sweet but I loved it.  I did not add the bacon on top either.

I've made twenty different meatloaf variations over the years and this one is unique enough to stand out - in a very good way!  We all enjoyed it from the baby to the adults.

Made this as in directions.  Used ground sirloin for less fat.  Used apple cider vinegar.  Drained the fat before adding glaze.  Used digital thermometer and cooked to 160 degrees.  Took close to 90 minutes.  I am fond of Brown Sugar Meatloaf and this is my new favourite.

Based on several comments regarding this recipe being too sweet, and knowing there is a lot of sugar in ketchup, I left out the brown sugar.  I didn't have bacon so didn't use that either.  Because I like to push veggies, in addition to a chopped onion, I shredded up one carrot, finely chopped 1 celery stalk and added about 1/8 cup of chopped green pepper. I sauteed the veggies  in a small amount of olive oil before adding it to the crumbs and meat.  After all that, the meatloaf was excellent!!  It was plain for me but my spice-averse husband loved it!!

Made exactly as written and it was fabulous.  I don't understand how people thought this was too sweet.  The only thing I won't do is add the bacon next time, as it didn't crisp very well with the sauce on top but other than that, I will make again!

This is an excellent recipe.  It is the meatloaf I grew up eating at home, at others' homes and in restaurants in VA.  I never tasted unsweetened meatloaf with brown gravy until I was 33 years old and was visiting in CA. If you feel "something is missing" try substituting horseradish for the mustard in the topping sauce.  Also, if you're using a sweet ketsup you may want to reduce the amount of sugar in both the meatloaf and the sauce.

I have not tried this recipe yet but I do have a comment. This comment is for Jackie2830 and any one else that feels they need to change a recipe. Jackie, quit your crying.....If you are not going to follow the recipe to a tee then quit complaining about it. I use beef/pork/veal, I used one egg instead of two. Tell you what Jackie if you took a  in it maybe then it would be to your liking!!!!! FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS!!!!!!

Some of the best meatloaf I've had, it was a little sweet, I think next time I'll leave out the brown sugar all together, I also took other's advice and added some seasonings, sea salt, pepper and garlic powder. put less ketchup in and added worchestershire sauce and a little liquid smoke flavoring. I also put 4 strips of bacon on top and used my homemade bbq sauce with a little bit of mustard mixed in to top it. I cooked it for an hour then turned the broiler on to cook the bacon a bit more, then  put the bbq sauce on and broiled a little bit longer.

finally! I have been unsuccessfully attempting my husbands favorite dish meatloaf for years. This one is a keeper, tasty and the texture is perfect. The topping was a bit abundant for our tastes so next time I will cut in half half or maybe 1/4. Didn't think it was too sweet either.

My family loved this meatloaf, and my son even ate the leftovers (he never eats leftovers!).  I made according to the recipe, except I sauteed the onions ahead and made half the top sauce.  Terrific!

I did not care for the red sauce, probably because I am not big fan of vinegar and so it had a tang I did not like. My husband however, thought it was great!

This is our favorite meatloaf.  I divide it and freeze half to bake later.  Our fine-tuned preference is now to omit the bacon and halve the sugar in the meat mix.  And I reserve some of the topping to serve as a sauce after slicing the loaf.  Delicious!

We loved this recipe.  I used 1 package of Lipton dry onion soup instead of the chopped onion just for the sake of time.  It worked out very well.  I would recommend that substitution to anyone who doesn't want to take the time to chop onions.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe to the letter.  I believe that next time I will do like others have suggested and cut back on the amount of brown sugar.  The meatloaf held together well and was very moist.  I will make this over and over again.

I must have done something wrong.  The meatloaf fell apart and seemed mushy to us.  We ended up eating leftovers and threw the meatloaf away.  I followed the recipe completely - except that I didn't use onions...I used onion powder.  I used Ritz Crackers...was that what was wrong?

To quote my husband, the meatloaf enthusiast, "This is the best meatloaf EVER!"  And he is really quite a judge of meatloaf.  I've tried several other meatloaf recipes from AllRecipes, and this is far and away our favorite.  (I'm really not a meatloaf fan, but I even liked this one a lot.)  I made two changes -- I cut the amount of brown sugar in the glaze to 1/4 cup, and I broiled the meatloaf briefly before adding the glaze, to get the bacon a little crispy.

Other than omitting the bacon (because I didnt have any), and skipping the glaze at the end (because I was lazy), I followed this recipe as listed and it was DELICIOUS!!

This is hands down the best meatloaf recipe that I've ever used. The glaze with the brown sugar, plus the brown sugar/vinegar gives it a taste all its own. I had such raves over the one I prepared for my family that it is from this day foward my recipe. The only thing I recomend, as with all my dishes is USE good meat i.e. ground round/ground chuck, don't cheat yourself and use some old 70/30 or just cheap hamburger meat.

Too sweet for us.  Maybe with a cutback on the sugar it would be better.

Made this for my family, with the addition of 2 small, chopped green bell peppers. Everybody loved it! I've always hated meatloaf recipes that have too much bread in them, so, using Ritz Crackers instead of bread was a great way to combat that sogginess that the bread sometimes creates!

I have made this meatloaf over and over. My family loves it. The only thing I would change about it is that we separate the loaf into 2 loafs in a glass pan. We also use half of the vinegar. Other then that - it is fantastic!!

Started with the basic recipe, without the sugar added to the meat, because I loved the cracker idea. Sauteed the onion with 3 cloves fresh garlic, one chopped red bell pepper, one stalk of celery and added it to the meat mixture along with about a T. of Worcestershire and pepper to taste. Lastly, we halved the sugar in the sauce because super-sweet isn't to our taste. Overall...a great foundation and clever idea. :)

Loved it!  Great flavor.  This just replaced my regular meatloaf recipe.   Only minor criticism is that it did crumble quite a bit when you tried to slice it - not sure if I needed to use a more lean or less lean ground beef to help it slice better - or perhaps add an extra egg.    But it was so good nobody cared.

I'll admit that I was concerned with the amount of brown sugar that this recipe called for, but as it turns out, it was a needless worry. My family did not think it was too sweet at all! It was so easy to prepare and held together really well after it was cooked. I did cook it a little longer than called for, about an hour and 20 minutes just because I had a gut feeling that one hour for that much meat was not going to be long enough and I am so glad I did that. It was super moist and done to perfection! My kids took it as leftovers for their school lunches the next day and then asked me to make more! This will be a new staple in our household from here on out.

I am not a huge meatloaf fan, but this was the best recipe meatloaf recipe I have ever made (I have tried at least 15 recipes).  Perfect texture and when you warm it up it stays very moist.  I would not change a thing on this recipe!!

I have been making this recipe for years. Only changes I have made is reducing the sugar inside to 2 Tbsp & the cracker crumbs to one cup & sautéing the onions in butter. Yesterday I discovered this recipe is very forgiving. Life got in the way of my plans and I was pressed for time. I added onion soup instead of an onion, crushed Pepperidge Farm Stuffing (my sub for bread crumbs) & used half chili sauce & half ketchup in the mix. Smeared the top with Sweet Billy Rays. It was delicious!

Absolutely delicious. Followed others suggestions and cut the brown sugar. I usually use about an 1/8th cup in topping and none in the meat mixture. I've made this several times and it is one of my husbands favorite foods. (I have never put bacon on it.)

Per previous poster's suggestion, I added 1 chopped red pepper and some shredded cheese and increased the cracker crumbs by 1/2 cup.  I also used 2 1/4 lbs. of ground beef and decreased the brown sugar in the sauce on top to 1/4 cup.  Filled my meatloaf pan and is now cooking in the oven.  I use a Williams-Sonoma meatloaf pan with removable insert.  This keeps the meatloaf moist, but seperate from the oil.  Totally worth the money that I put into it.  Moist, looser meatloaf than prior recipes, but I expect it to firm upon standing or refrigeration.  My son ate 4 servings and both guys want it included in the regular rotation.  Will make great meatloaf sandwiches tomorrow.

Will not make this again. Meatloaf is very mushy and doesn't stay together well, and this calls for way too much ketchup. Ketchup was very overpowering.

This was a terrific dish after I made the following changes.  Meatloaf needs to cook for 1 hour and 15 minutes, carefully drain fat, add topping (make 1/2 of recipe topping because the original recipe is too much), bake 15 more minutes with the topping, THEN broil the top.  So Delicious!  I used good'ole saltine crackers.  I would even try this with dry oatmeal instead of the crackers.  Next time I'll reduce the brown sugar in the recipe to 1/8 cup...maybe even less.

I made this for the first time, and everyone loved it. DH said it was "incredible" and the best meat loaf he ever had. Next time I may add a few more cracker crumbs to firm it up a little more - it was so moist that it did not hold together well when I was taking it out of the pan. But all 3 sons agreed the flavor was great!

Really delicious, hubby gobbled up the entire loaf in 2 days . He commented it was the best meatloaf I ever made, the one thing we both agreed on was that there was too much sauce on the top, next time I will cut in 1/2. It may sound sweet but the vinegar and mustard cut the sweetness..This one a keeper!

I always hated meatloaf growing up and would never eat it until I made this for my family. It was a huge hit! I even loved it! I put a few more slices of bacon on it. I get so many compliments every time I make this.

I loved this meatloaf! According to some reviews it was too sweet, but I followed the recipe exactly and thought it was perfect. Loved the sauce on top, although I followed one review that said to halve it. So I didn't put as much on top. It was delicious! Will definitely make it again. -Emalyn

Good meatloaf...mine was a little on the sweet side so I will cut back on the brown sugar a bit. I also used flavored bread crumbs instead of the crackers and added some parmesan cheese into the mix.

I'm sorry but I can't understand the good reviews.  I made this as instructed and it came out extremely bland! It was very lacking in flavor. My kids asked me not to make it again. When I took it out of the oven it was half raw.

We did not care for this recipe.  My entire family of 5, would not eat it after one bite!  It was way too sweet with all the brown sugar in the meatloaf and the topping.  Additionally, the topping destroyed the flavor of the meatloaf and added an odd sweet barbeque flavor.  The recipe did not call for spraying the pan; therefore, it stuck to the bottom of the pan.

I hate to be one of those people who changes everything, but....  based on the other reviews, I left the sugar out of the meatloaf mix.  I also didn't realize the recipe called for Ritz, so I subbed toasted plain bread crumbs.  I also added half of a chopped green bell pepper and a medium onion and a package of dry onion soup mix.  And I left out the bacon.  So, it was in the spirit of the Amish meatloaf, if not exactly to the letter.  It was very good and I would make it again.

This recipe is AMAZING my family loves it. We weren't big on meatloaf because it never seemed to have enough flavor but this recipe gives just enough flavor its NOT too sweet at all. Although I had to use tomato sauce because I forgot to buy more ketchup :] I'm not sure if that makes a difference but it was still yummy as heck!

I'm a vegetarian, so I can't vouch for this recipe myself, but my hubby loved it.  I followed the suggestions made, to cut the sugar and ketchup in half and to halve the sauce.  He said it was very good.

Made this tonight. The only change was adding a little BBQ sauce. My family loved it. Can't wait to make it again.

Love this recipe.  And so do my guys.  It can sometimes be a revolving door cooking on a ranch and as they come and go, I've never had any complaints about this one.  I don't, however, use the glaze.  I let them top it they way they want.  Have been and will be using this recipe for a long time.

I am from Ohio Amish country. I love a good hearty meatloaf. This meatloaf was too sweet and mushy, and reminded me only a little of the Amish meatloaves I am familiar with.
 I didn't add any sugar to the meat but, with so much ketchup (which is all sugar anyway!) it was still very sweet. I had a ton left over, so the next day, I sliced it and put the slices under the broiler. This helped with the mushiness a bit so none went to waste, but I won't be making this again.

Interesting departure from traditional recipe.  Very sweet.  The crackers gave it a richness that gave some balance to the sweet.  The glaze was great.  The bacon was a nice addition.  Next time I will eliminate the brown sugar in the meat.  Just a bit too much sweet for my families taste. I must admit though, I kept slicing off "one more little piece"! It must be addictive!

I am a meatloaf officionado. I make it dozens of different ways and am always looking for new takes on an old dish. This one was fabulous. I didn't find it sweet at all. It does make a lot of sauce so you could cut that in half. I used more meat and only 1 egg and it was the perfect consistency. Definitely a keeper!

The whole family liked this one with minor changes.  I used half the onion because we don't like onion overpowering meat flavor and about 1/3 of the sauce that goes on top.  I used oats instead of crackers. I also substituted half of the ground beef for ground venison just because that is what I have on hand.  This will become my go to meatloaf recipe!

Fantastic.  Used  a meatloaf mix of ground beef, veal, and pork.  Only additions I made were some powdered garlic and Pride of Prauge seasoning on top.  Glaze was perfect, no changes there.

uPDATE1/16 I've made this a dozen times and finally realized I'd been doing it wrong! I put the brown sugar in the glaze, not the meat.  Think  I'll keep it this way!

Great...used 1 1/2 lb ground beef and 3 links italian sausage! This was awesome already made another just for sandwichs. I also cut the sugar way down just because I know it is not to my taste. I have been looking for a good  meatloaf recipe to add to the weekly rotation..thanks!

My husband tasted this and immediately said it was "card worthy", the highest honor a recipe can receive in our home.  I used cooked and crumbled bacon inside the meatloaf to save the mess in my oven.  This made a very moist meatloaf with a crispy outside. Ten stars in our book!

I read the reviews of this recipe and noted that a lot of them said it was too sweet. I made it as written, however. I found the meat very yummy. My bf and thought the glaze was too sweet and scraped most of it off. Our two girls (one of which informed me she doesn't like meatloaf)LOVED it and kept saying it was awesome. It was even better left over. I will absolutely make it again, but will cut the brown sugar in the glaze way back. Thanks for sharing this tasty recipe!

This is very very good. Since I don't have a big sweet tooth, I followed the suggestion of others and added worcestire sauce and garlic powder to the meatloaf mixture and less sugar. Equally I added less sugar to the gravy mix and added the gravy mix to some basic brown onion gravy mix and this recipe turned out SUPERB! Thanks for the great, moist, and wonderfully tasing meatloaf.

The flavor was good to me, except it didn't slice well, it fell apart. I think next time I'm going to increase the amount of cracker crumbs and use a little less meat. Also the cooking time was not long enough in my opinion. I had to microwave some of ours and leave the rest in the oven.

This is a very moist meat loaf.  I have to say it is a little to sweet for me.  My kids did not like the taste.  My husband however loved it.  He had several helpings.  It is all about prefrence.  If you don't like sweet then this is not the meat loaf for you.

Gunner (my Husband )as well as my son , neighbors and friends all love this!!!Regardless of the extra zip of  the sweetness, I think it adds to the savory flavor . Its  DEFINiTLY  a comfort type winter recipe*******If no  butter crackers crush same amount of any plain cracker, melt 1/4 cup of butter mix well and distribute throughout  meatloaf as blending.

I've been trying to find a recipe for the perfect meatloaf. This wasn't it, but it was still really good. My toddler ate all of his, and my husband had two servings AND a sandwich for a snack. I halved the recipe, and it was gone within 12 hours! I made no changes to the ingredients, except to add a little garlic powder and Worcestershire sauce to the meat mixture. Also, if you don't like recipes from this site such as "Grandpa's Coney Sauce" or "Pennsylvania Coal Region Barbecue" or most baked bean sauces  you won't like this (this is a really common sweet/sour taste used in a lot of recipes). Anyway, my family really enjoyed this. Thanks for another great recipe!

I made this meatloaf about a week ago.  The family loved it.  I didn't use the bacon.  It was very moist and was a little too sweet for me but the crew thought it was great.  Will definetely make it again!

This meatloaf was one of the best I have ever had.  If you like the old fashioned gravy or ketchup meatloaf, then you probably will not like this.  This is a cross between barbecue and sweet and sour.  I have tried dozens of recipes and my family thinks they are just OK.  I don't even eat my own meatloaf and I couldn't stay away from this one, my husband was eating it late into the night!  I used breadcrumbs instead of the butter crackers and cut the recipe in half for 1 lb of 93% ground beef and used the two eggs. I grated the onion because I do not like chunks of onion.  I added extra bacon to the top and it tasted great along with the meat.  I also did not use a loaf pan but shaped into a loaf and placed in baking dish for a nice crunchy crust all around.  I will be making this recipe over and over again.  Thanks!

Since I'm a firm believer that brown sugar should not go in the meatloaf but rather on it, I used the "Rempel's Family Meatloaf Recipe" (found in this site to0) f0r the meatloaf and kept this recipe's glaze.. I don't know bout y'all but that for me is a five star recipe. ;)

I knew this  one would be a hit because it is essentially the same recipe that my meatloaf has morphed into over the years.  It was nice to actually see measurements, however, and so I stuck exactly to the ones mentioned here, except for one little difference.  I used one cup crackers and one cup oatmeal (oatmeal really helps to cut down the grease in the hamburger and is a good way to add a dose of oatmeal to your kids day!)  We quite like the sweeter taste of the meatloaf and this is actually what my 10 year old asked  me to make to celebrate his birthday last month.  We also make a heartshaped meatloaf for Valentines Day which brings me to the one point I might add. I almost always make my meatloaf in an unusual shape or in large cupcake pans.  The meatloaf cooks much quicker and the kids LOVE having their own little 'special' loaf (especially the 6 year old) I keep making my meatloaf bigger and bigger each time and each time it all gets eaten. No chance for meatloaf sandwiches the next day! :-(  
Definately passed the Wolseley test as he decided to risk the human wrath and stole a taste from the table when no one was looking.  He spent the rest of the dinner looking terribly pathetic sitting beside the table.... (we did give him a wee bit of leftover)

We all loved it!  I used Splenda brown sugar instead of the regular brown sugar the recipe calls for and it turned out great.

This was great!  I loved it!  However, my husband didn't.  If you don't like your meat to be sweet this isn't for you.  He said it tasted kind of barbeque.

My wife (who is known to be very demanding when it coms to meatloaf) said this was the best she had ever eaten.  Even my kids, who don't normally like meatloaf, couldn't believe how good this was and opted for seconds!

I honestly can't say enough good stuff about this recipe.  I usually made the recipe off of the onion soup mix, but my hubby get's indigestion so I have been looking for another meatloaf recipe.  Boy did I find it!  He loved it. I put 1/2 of the glaze on while it cooked and then 1/2 of what was left to freshen it up.  I did have some left over, just didnt' need it all.  You won't need ketchup with this one.  Yummers!  Double YUMMERS!

I've never made meatloaf but I thought I'd try it and it turned out excellent.  Though I added more crackers to keep it from being mushy (two full packages of Ritz to be exact) and I ran out of ketchup and ended up mixing BBQ sauce with it for the glaze, which worked out perfectly.  For anyone who isn't a ketchup fan should try this, it works out really well.

Great All-American style meatloaf recipe! The first time I noticed it was a bit soggy so I added some crushed saltines and 1 slice of cubed bread and that cured the problem. Instead of laying the bacon strips on top, I chopped them up first. Plus, I've been adding Worcestershire to the sauce. My husband is in heaven when I serve it with creamy mashed potatoes (use Yukon Gold potatoes), corn and a small salad.

My husband has been begging me to make meatloaf for 10 years now and I used this recipe tonight-the first time I ever made meatloaf. His aunt and uncle joined us for dinner and my husband and his aunt gave it a 5 star rating. His uncle gave it a 4 3/4 star rating-only because it was a little greasy-but that was my bad-I did not use a meat loaf pan with holes in the bottom so the grease could drain. Since this was my first time-I didn't think it would matter-but I followed the recipe exactly and they all loved it. There was alot of sauce for the top of it-but like a previous rating said, you could use it for mashed potatoes. Looks like I will be making meatloaf now!! Thanks for the great recipe-I suggest following it exactly how it says.

The only thing we didn't like about this was the sauce on top.  Next time I make this I will omit the vinegar (you could tell it was in there)and make less of the sauce.  Otherwise flavor and texture were great.

Thank you for this great recipe.  I have been searching for a really good meatloaf recipe and I know I have found it.  I made it for dinner this evening and my family LOVED it.  My son told me to throw away all my other meatloaf recipes and only use this recipe from now on.  I intend to do just that.

This was a GREAT meatloaf. We did add a crushed clove of garlic to the meat and had leftover cooked bacon that we added with the topping to keep it from getting TOO crispy.

I made this recipe EXACTLY AS IT WAS WRITTEN. I LOVED it. But I like my meatloaf super sweet and saucy. I used a convection oven, (and I'm new to a convection), and I don't know if that's why, but the edges were nice and crispy. I will make this again. Not sure why anyone who doesn't like sweet/sugar in their meatloaf would consider this recipe. You can see how much sugar is in it. It's not a secret. I digress... My usual go-to meatloaf recipe has a tasty sauce on top but it's only a thin layer, so there isn't enough to go with each bite. This one has enough sauce that you can have plenty with every delectable bite. ENJOY!

Best ever!  This recipe has brought meatloaf back to our family menu.  I do cut the basting sauce in 1/2 but otherwise make exactly as written!  This is on the menu tonight once again with scalloped potatoes and buttered green peas :)

I doubled the recipe using almost 5lbs of 80% beef, did not double the brown sugar in the meat mixture (I thought it would be too sweet for my family).  Used one very large onion (which I would use maybe a small/medium) next time. I used every single slice of a 12 oz. package of Applewood smoked bacon (cooked half way on a cookie sheet in the oven) prior to placing over the 2 very large loaves. Sautéed  onions in the bacon grease before adding to meat mixture and placed two slices of bread under the loaves (one on a cookie sheet and the other in a glass 9-1/2x11 baking dish.  I doubled every single ingredient (including the brown sugar) for the topping and left just a small amount on the side for extra sauce (which we LOVE) and it was NOT TOO MUCH!  It was perfect.  I used raw apple cider vinegar as I always use for cooking.  I had only 2 sleeves of "buttery crackers" which was not enough so I added some plain crackers that I had on hand (worked out fine).  My family from 10 to 56 years old loved this meatloaf. My 15 year old stated that it did not need the bacon, which I agreed BUT it gives it a different flavor (in a good way) WITH THE BACON!!  What doesn't taste good with bacon??  Thanks for this recipe, I don't think I'll make it any other way from now on :) Bon Appétit

I made this using 1# of ground beef.  Instead of using buttery crackers, I used 'Alabama Fire Crackers' from AR.  The portions of the ingredients were right on.  It made a very nice loaf that held together really well.  I let it rest for about 15-20 before slicing.  Sliced great!  The leftovers were wonderful for lunch the next day.

Everyone in my family LOVED this! Easy to prepare. I may have been a little generous on the ingredients, because this mixture did not fit into my 9x5 inch baking pan. I used a 9x13 pan lined w/ foil, sprayed with cooking spray, and molded the meatloaf into a rectangle in the pan. I placed about 5 strips of bacon on the top, but they didn't get crispy, so I may pre-cook them a bit next time. I also will halve the sauce recipe, as there was an over-abundance of it. I didn't change or add any ingredients, and was very happy with the result. I can tell you right now that I'm making a meatloaf sandwich with the leftovers tonight! Thanks, Duano!

This was delicious! I wasn't sure the crackers would make much difference from the bread crumbs but they do. Super moist and tasty.

I did like this meatloaf, but after reading the reviews and comments about the sweetness, I left the brown sugar out of the meatloaf, but kept it in the topping.  I think that was the right move.  It was pretty rich with just the butter crackers, so I don't think it needed the brown sugar.  I also don't think I would put the bacon on top if I make it again.  Maybe I was suppose to brown it first, but I didn't think it got done and it kept the sauce from sticking to the meatloaf.  Overall, it was good recipe and I'll use it again.

I made just a few changes...did not add the brown sugar to the meat mixture, used a  3 meat (beef,pork,veal) mix....which I personally dont care for, but hubby loves. I also cut back to 1/4c. of brown sugar on top. Placed maybe 5-6 half strips on bacon and covered the loaf with it. All in all....good meat loaf, hubby loved it....me...so-so cause of the meat I used. Next time I will use all beef. Will try this again. Thanks!

This would definitely be a five if you cut the brown sugar in half for the entire recipe with only half the amount of topping it calls for.  Even with half the brown sugar, it is still a little on the sweet side but still good.  I also added some fresh ground horseradish (you can buy it that way) and worcestershire sauce.  I left out the onions, but added the bacon half way through and it was  awesome.  I will definitely make again but with even less brown sugar.

My family said this was the best meatloaf I have ever made, and my husband doesn't normally even like meatloaf. I thought it was really good, but maybe a little too sweet for me. But if my husband and kids like it that much, I will definitely make this again.

I don't like regular meatloaf, but this recipe is great. My only change was to add Splender Brown sugar instead of regular brown sugar, wasn't quit as sweet.

This is a family favorite.  I can't make any other plain meatloaf.  I have found that if you just take the topping/sauce and add it to any other meatloaf recipe it is nearly the same.  My son is allergic to eggs so I needed an egg free meatloaf recipe.  I just add the sauce on top of my egg free recipe and the family thinks it is the same dish.  The sauce is the kicker for this one!

This is one of the best meatloaf recipes that I ever tried, and I have tried many. I usually use this type of glaze for the top of my meatloafs, but I have never made a meatloaf with brown sugar in the meat mixture, it really does make it very special and unique. I didn't find it too sweet at all. Season to taste, I used garlic pepper in mine. I removed the bacon before topping with the glaze so that I could finish cooking the bacon in the microwave. I put the bacon back on the meatloaf and returned it to the oven for the last two minutes of baking time.  I made half the recipe and served it along with Oven Crisped Potatoes (recipe from this site), and corn, it was a nice combination.  It got rave reviews from my husband as well. It has become my favorite recipe for meatloaf! Thank you for sharing!

I have made this several times and every time I get rave reviews.  The key for those who say it is greasy is to use ground sirloin or a low fat meat; I always put a few slices of bread on the bottom of the pan and it absorbs the grease.

If it is too sweet cut back on the brown sugar, I add 2 tablespoons and it is perfect, even for those who hate meatloaf!!!

Made mine with 1 lb ground turkey and 1 lb 97/3 ground beef.  Didn't have bacon and it's a shame 'cause it would have been amazing.  Sweet, but onion balanced it nicely and gave it a bit of bite.  Crackers instead of bread crumbs made it light and moist without being soggy.  Got thumbs up all the way around our very crowded dinner table.

Very good meatloaf. Next time I will use fewer crackers, though. I never use that much filler in meatloaf but wanted to follow the recipe as written. Didn't have the bacon on hand although my ground beef was so lean it would have been a nice touch.  We loved the sweet glaze.  Made good sandwiches the next day.  Will make again. Thanks!

This is without a doubt the GREATEST meatloaf ever! I will never use a different recipe!  The bacon gives it that little something extra. The only thing I would recommend would be putting bread in the bottom of the loaf pan to soak up some of the grease.

I normally do not like meatloaf, but I thought it was worth a try.  It was fantastic.  My husband was disappointed when he found out I was making meatloaf, but when he smelled it, he had to have some.  I did have to cook it for about 15 minutes longer, and I did not put bacon on the top.  Thanks for this great recipe.

Thank you for submitting this recipe!!!  It is so good!! Actually have been making this for months now. My grown up son has never been a meat eater and neither of my 2 kids care for meatloaf.  Except for this one!!  They actually request for me to make it.  I always read the reviews which is most helpful.  Took advice of the majority and used only 1/4 cup of brown sugar that gets poured on top of the loaf.  Only other changes: I add more butter crackers to try to hold it together better plus add a large handful of mild cheddar cheese and a chopped green pepper.

I was looking for a good meatloaf recipe and tried this one.  I halved the ketchup mixture that goes on top and it turned out fine. Was moist and delicious.  Tasted very homemade.  Will make again. I froze the leftovers in sections and was very good 2nd time around.

This was absolutely fantastic and the kids and husband went wild over it.  Spiced perfectly.  Froze very well.  I used less expensive ingredients- $1 butter crackers from Dollar General and 70/30 ground beef and it still turned out just beautifully.  By the way, I learned on the hillbilly housewife site about rinsing ground beef to lower the fat content, which always saves us a lot.  This was a terrific everyday recipe that allows us to save up for more expensive recipes at other times.  Loved it!!

this is what I did,I used two cups of dried oatmeal instead of crackers,and 3/4 cup of ketchup it was firmer,cooked it at 400 for 45 min to an hour,this is similar to what my mother use to make, used tomaote juice,which I did not have on hand so after reading the reviews I knew that the crackers would have to be subtituted.

My husband loved this meatloaf.  It was moist and very tasty.  The bacon is just right, not too over powering.  Very easy and delicious!

The texture of this meatloaf was quite nice and very moist. I took the advice of previous reviewers and halved the sugar and also halved the sugar in the glaze but despite this I thought the glaze was still overpoweringly sweet. Next time I think I will try a quarter of the sugar called for in the glaze and also add some garlic salt to the meat mixture as others have suggested.

I made this last night and it got rave reviews. This was the first meat loaf I have ever made and it was  a success! I did what others had suggested and cut back on the brown sugar. Some people said it turned out crumbly, but I used ground sirloin and mine turned out great! I didn't have any vinegar so I used apple cider vinegar and cut back to 1 TBLSP. It gave it a nice kick. The only other thing I did was add a little garlic powder.  I served this with mashed potatoes, purple hull peas and cornbread. YUM! My hubby was still raving this morning.  Thanks for the recipe!

My family loved this recipe!  The ritz crackers gave the meat a lighter texture than breadcrumbs do.  Plus, the sweetness was a nice change for meatloaf.  I will definitely make this again.

I wanted to try this recipe exactly as written the first time.  It was just a bit sweet for us so when I make this again I am going to try the recipe as is adding a drained can of Rotel tomatoes hoping that will gently cut down on the sweet, if that is not 'it', then I will reduce the amount of sugar.

Other than being a little on the sweet side, this meatloaf was outstanding.  For those who rated it badly and said it was too sweet, reduce the amount of brown sugar.  It's as simple as that.  Everyone that I made if for loved it.  We froze the leftovers and had it for another dinner 1 week later.  It was so good, that I've been craving for it again.  I think this recipe is fabulous!

This is the absolute best!  I never made a really great meatloaf until I made this one.  I do make one change, though.  I don't add the ketchup and brown sugar called for in the meat mixture. Instead, I add about an 1/8 cup of fresh parsley and use a 1/2 cup or so from the basting sauce.  There is no other meatloaf recipe in my estimation!

This was good. A little greasy for my liking but good. My boyfriend rates this among his favorites in meatloaves that I make. Tastes even better the next day.

This is by far the best meatloaf i have ever had! I did not modify the recipe at all and it came out perfect. My whole family loved it. I noticed alot of people said they had to cut the brown sugar in half. Try not packing the sugar. Otherwise it might turn out too sweet.

This meatloaf was AMAZING!!  My husband thought it was the best he has ever had and said he would eat it every night if he could.  It was very moist making it superb.  The ketchup topping was a little strong but I just slid mine off the side and enjoyed!  Thank you for that wonderful recipe!

My husband says the reason he married me was because the first meal I cooked him was meat loaf, in other words it's very important that it be GOOD!  Since I made this recipe it's all he and the kids ask for.  They love the sauce! I put it together sunday and we cook it up after work Monday. EASY!

I tried this recipe exactly as it's written here, and although it was good, my family and I all thought it a touch on the sweet side. The second time I made it, I made it exactly as directed, but omitted the brown sugar that goes INTO the meat. It was a HUGE hit. My husband special requests "that meatloaf with the bacon". Even my kids eat it, and personally, I love it! I haven't made meatloaf the way I used to since I found this recipe! It's AWSOME!

Absolutely good, followed directions exactly, however I had a bad spillover in the oven, so watch that. (It was a mess!) Whole family liked it, will make again but not use as my only recipe for meatloaf.

I have to agree with the minority on this one.  The meatloaf was just plain mushy...terrible texture.  The flavor wasn't too bad, but again, the mushy meat just made it inedible as others reviewers stated.  This may be how it's supposed to be, we just didn't care for it.

I took the suggestion of reducing brn sgr in sauce recipe to 1/4 a cup because my husband doesn't like things that are too sweet.  My husband couldn't quit raving about how delicious it was, he LOVED it. He said it was the best meatloaf he had ever had, even better than his Mom's.  Now "that's" a compliment!  Thanks for our "new" family recipe.

Best meatloaf recipe I've ever made!!  I used 1 lb. ground beef and 1 lb. ground pork.  I followed the rest of the recipe exactly - the amount of sauce was perfect and we couldn't taste the vinegar at all!  As with every meatloaf recipe  - even better the next day!! FABULOUS!!!!!!!!  Will use again!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Fantastic!  My family's favorite by far from this site.  I decreased the brown sugar in the loaf to 1/8 cup and I also decreased the topping to 1/8 cup brown sugar and 1/4 ketchup and left out the vinegar.  Most excellent!

Very Good!  The only reason I didn't give five stars is because it was a little too sweet.  I think I will try making it again and just cut back a little on the amount of brown sugar.  Otherwise it was very good.

Trader Joes "Social crackers" work very well with the flavor. This was my first Meatloaf. It was a hit I followed ~Taylor~ 2006 recommendations on changes in the recipe. It Came out perfect also it was still a hit on the second time I cooked it with half ground Turkey and half grass fed ground beef only because thats all I had left in the fridge to cook with this time.  I sauted the chopped onion with the two slices of bacon, then diced the bacon for both times. Bacon makes it all the better with anything!

I  omitted the  brown  sugar  in the  meat  mixture  all together. I  also  only used 1/4 a cup in the  sauce topping. With  those  tweeks,  it  turned  out nicely. I  always drain the  grease  off  before  adding the  topping  to a  meatloaf. Over all this  makes a nice, moist  meatloaf.

The bomb.com. So delicious moist and flavorful. Reduced the sugar amount some but everything thing else was used as follows. My fav meatloaf so far.

TOO sweet - need to back off on the brown sugar and ketchup on top. Mushy inside too - not sure how to dry it out a little.

My husband said this was better than his mom's! I threw it together in a hurry so missed the vinegar and mustard in the glaze. I did sprinkle a bit of onion soup mix and a few splashes of Worcestershire sauce both in the raw meat and the sauce. I used 4 slices of bacon. Next time I will try to wrap the loaf in bacon, that was my husbands favourite part. It does require longer cooking time with more bacon but well worth the wait. I didn't find it too sweet but I only eyeballed the measurements. I'll perfect it next time.

It was great! The only two things I did differently were a) used regular saltines because that was all I had and b) made only half the sauce because of the "sweet" reviews. A) worked well with saltines and B) will make the whole batch of sauce next time. It was good but more would have been great. Definitely a keeper recipe for me!

I made this exactly as the recipe calls and my family was all over me about making it again. One of my boys has autism and he's quite picky about what he eats. He said it was the best he'd ever had. They even ate the leftovers and that never happens. It was perfectly moist and I had minimal grease in the pan. It is very filling! I will make the glaze in half tonight because it was a little too sweet. Yes, I'm making it again tonight!

Best meatloaf recipe ever.  If you like sweet, this ones for you!  I would really like to see if I can do it sugar free by  replacing the brown sugar.  Replaced the crackers with bread crumbs and its  still delicious.  We have made this recipe a few times and changed it slightly every time and its always excellent.

This was really good. I did everything as written only I halved the brown sugar in both the loaf and the glaze. It was still pretty sweet, but the right amount of sweetness. Thanks!

I used wheat crackers (what I had on hand) and reduced to about 1 1/2 cups -- 21/2 cups of crackers seemed way too much. Sub'd 1/2 lb. pork sausage for part of the ground beef, so didn't put bacon on top.  Also added 1 clove crushed garlic and 1 tsp. worshestershire to meat mixture. One of the best meat loaves I've made - which is saying a lot!  Yes, with the sauce, this makes a sweet kind of meatloaf, so if you're looking for the brown gravy type this is not for you.

This has become a hit in our house. I sometimes omit the bacon (simply because I don't have it) and it's still fantastic. Done this with venison (+10% beef fat) also, turns out excellent.
1 "small onion" is very subjective... having made it a few times now I have an idea of how much is enough - be careful not to overdo it.

This is the only meatloaf I bother to make anymore, since it's a hands-down favorite every time I serve it, whether at home or at potlucks.  I make two changes:  Instead of putting bacon strips on top, I add a package (3oz I think) of real bacon bits to the meat mixture before baking.  I only make half a recipe of the sauce, and it is still plenty when I bake this meatloaf in a 9x13 pan.  Can't beat those Amish when it comes to comfort food!

Our family was crazy for this meatloaf.  I followed the directions as stated the first time I made it.  It was wonderful.  Since then I have made the same recipe but used ground turkey and left off the bacon.  It too was very tasty and is now a family favorite.  It is a bit sweet  for some people and I believe one could reduce the brown sugar in both the loaf and the sauce to remedy.  I think any of the reduced calorie/salt items today could be used in this and it will still maintain the great taste of this loaf.

Taste almost exactly like my Grandma's recipe.  My husband and daughter both loved it and had 2nd helpings (this never happens).  I will used less onion next time, it was a little over powering.

Very moist and juicy, full of flavor, but the reviewers who have said that it's sweet are totally right. I left the sugar out of the glaze, which was a good decision. I would try this recipe again, but leave the sugar out of the meat mixture as well.

I'm only rating the meatloaf. Everyone loved it! I used Tones Minced Onions, just a small handful of brown sugar & 4 slices of bacon. Hubbie is a diabetic so the top was just straight up ketchup. Don't know why you need all the sugar. We loved it!

I left out 1 cp of cracker crumbs, it seemed like a bit much. I also used a little less ketchup and sugar. I didn't use the bacon at all.

My husband really loved it. I thought it was missing a little something. Next time I'm going to add a little Worchestershire and some Schilling Montreal Steak seasoning.

My wife hated meatloaf so she never fixed it. when i made this recipe for the family she tried it to be nice. I have been fixing it regularly ever since at her request. My daughters fiance comes over everytime I have made it and has even asked when I was fixing it again (May just put him to work next time in the kitchen)

I've used this recipe many times over the last few years, its the hubby's favorite. For a healthy alternative I sometimes make it with ground turkey instead of beef, and it still tastes great. I usually leave the sugar out of the meat mix, but do use it in the glaze.

This is hands down the best meatloaf recipe on this site!  To those who thought it to greasy, USE BETTER QUALITY HAMBURGER!!! AND use the pre cooked bacon instead of the raw type!  i usually toop it with the bacon and then top with the sauce.

It is Excellant!

This meatloaf was not good. It was dripping with fat and was so so sweet. Way too sweet. We weren't able to eat it.

Very good meatloaf - the glaze is too much and too sweet, like others have mentioned, but that can easily be cut down. Very moist meatloaf!

Made this exactly as written. If you put sugar on your burgers, or spread honey on your steak, then this is the meatloaf for you. If that sounds awful, then look elsewhere for a meatloaf recipe.

This is good but is different than what I thought of in a meatloaf. It is more moist than I like and has just a different flavor. It is good and we have made this many times but I still want a good home cooked meatloaf. What can I say- I'm a midwest girl.

I haven't had much success with meatloaf for the past couple of years so I decided to give this recipe a try.  I thought it was quite good but a bit on the sweet side.  My boys didn't care for it at all.  I will repeat this recipe but I believe I will half the amount of brown sugar.

I've tried several meatloaf recipes over the years and the others have just been so so. They make an OK dinner but nothing to remember... until I made this one. Everyone clamors for this and they even want leftovers to take for lunch the next day! The only change I make is to leave off the bacon. I tried it with the bacon which sounds yummy, but I didn't find it added much flavor...So I figured why add the calories. Either way this is absolutely delicious!

This recipe is the best! I have made this meatloaf lots of times and we enjoy it everytime. Last night, I did make only half of the glaze and it was plenty. My cold meatloaf sandwich that I had for lunch today was great, too!

Great recipe! The only thing I would note is that it has a tendencies to break apart very easily. I tried the recipe twice, the second time using an extra pound of beef and it worked perfectly! This is by FAR the tastiest meat loaf I have ever made.

Who knew meatloaf could be so good. My family loved it and can't wait for me to make it again. I followed the recipe given and would not change a thing next time. Very moist. Look no further, if your making meatloaf this is the recipe for you.

Wonderful recipe! The meatloaf was so flavorful. I didn't have Ritz type crackers so I used saltines, and I threw in a pinch of salt, pepper and garlic powder. Erring on the side of caution, I also cut the amount of glaze in half and that made the perfect amount for my husband and I.

I've never had a meatloaf with brown sugar in it before and I have to say I was extremely skeptical.  Didn't need to be...this meatloaf was awesome!  It held together fairly well and the meat had just the right of sweet that was offset by just the right amount of tang in the glaze.  Speaking of the glaze, this recipe made waaaaay too much.  You could easily cut it back by a third or a half depending on your taste.  After reading all of the postings, I let it cook for an hour and 15 minutes instead of the hour and it was just perfect!

I did make a few changes in the recipe, however.  I didn't have crackers so I used 2 cups of unflavored bread crumbs and also added 2 tsp dry ground mustard to the meat.  Also, I was taught that you should always cook your veggies before they go in the meatloaf so I sauteed the onions first in a little bit of butter until they were translucent.  I also made a freeform loaf with this so it wouldn't stew in its own juices in a loaf pan and topped it with four strips of bacon.

This is my new standard meatloaf now!  Delicious!

The recipe is almost perfect, my only changes; I added about 1/2 cup of chopped parsley and drained it when adding the glaze.  It stayed together very well and was delicious.

I made this meatloaf tonight. The only thing I changed was I used one egg instead of two. It turned out PERFECT. I was able to slice it into individual pieces upon removing it from the oven and it tasted wonderful.

This meatloaf was a HUGE hit with my husband and kids!  The only change I made was that I used 1 pound of ground beef and 1 pound of pork sausage (only because I didn't have 2 pounds of ground beef on hand and didn't want to go to the store!)  The only note I would make is that it was not thoroughly cooked in 1 hour... it took more like 1.5 hours.  Other than that, it was PERFECT!

I really liked this recipe and so did my husband.  It was nice to hear that my meatloaf wasn't "punishment" like his mother's was!  After reading many of the reviews, I opted to leave the sugar out of the recipe and it turned out fabulous.  It really sets up after a day (if your family can't eat it all, that is!).

This was THE BEST meatloaf I have ever made.  I used Ritz crackers and when I added the sauce for a topping, I sliced the loaf then as well so the sauce seeped into the meatloaf. Terrific!

I am giving this meatloaf 4 stars but only because of the changes I made. It is almost the original recipe though. I used ground turkey and instead of catsup I used barbeque sauce. I did use ritz crackers, eggs and salt and pepper and I put one extra slice of bacon on the top. For the final 15 minutes I just put some more barbeque sauce rather than the catsup/vinegar mixture. Which is essentially barbeque sauce anyway. My family loved this recipe, even my picky kids ate it up. I served it with boiled potatoes, stewed tomatoes(which incidentally tasted awesome with the meatloaf) and cranberry sauce (because my kids love them and requested them). So a winner. Not too sweet but then I didnt add any brown sugar or anything to the recipe. Just the barbeque sauce.

Delicious and Easy!  One of the best meatloaves ever.  We didn't have any problems with crumbly meatloaf, but we did use ground turkey instead of beef.  Moist and wonderful.

I cut the sugar out the meatloaf entirely and halved it in the glaze and I still felt this was too sweet. My family loved it though. I didn't bake mine in a loaf pan. Instead, I shaped it and baked it on a wire rack on a cookie sheet to drain off the fat. It was still very soft/loose to cut. The bacon didn't crisp up at all and was very fatty/raw-looking even after an hour of baking. If I made this again, I would decrease the sugar even more and omit the bacon entirely.

I made this exactly as the recipe suggested and it was terribly sweet and grainy in texture.  I think the good reviews are based on their substitutions, not on the original recipe.  I made it originally with oatmeal and no topping and it was actually very good, but if you follow the recipe it turns out so sweet as to be almost inedible.

I tried this meatloaf and my family loved it.  I made enough for 8 and there were only 4 eating.  My son ate what was left and took it for lunch the next day.  It was quite a hit!!!  I am making it for Christmas.

This is way too sweet/sour. My dad and I were looking for a more flavorful meatloaf recipe, and decided to try this one. We left out some sugar, the mustard, and most of the ketchup and it was still way too sweet and sour. The bacon is a nice idea, but it just didn't cook right in the oven.

It's an interesting recipe, but for it to be enjoyable I would modify it a LOT. My mom took one bite and threw it away. I think this recipe is just a waste of meat.

In my home the word "meatloaf" would send the kids running to anywhere but the kitchen table. I admit my meatloaf was, well, spoonable meat-like substance. 2 nights ago I made this meatloaf for dinner. taking the advise on a few other reviews I cut back on the brown sugar and used 3 strips of bacon to cover the loaf well.
No one left the table screaming, and hubby and nephew even came back for a second helping. Thank you, for this recipe. Very Very tasty and easy we loved it.

I thought I was safe with this recipe from the rave reviews. The texture of the loaf itself was mush. And I had to scrape the glaze off just so my family could eat it.  Sticky and sweet. This recipe is going in the trash. Sorry.

OK. Very moist, good flavor, but it was very crumbly, hard to cut, we used a spoon to serve it. Thanks for the recipe.

My whole family loved this meatloaf!I added red & green bell pepper, garlic, celery and Italian seasoning because I had them & I'm so used to including those things in my meatloaf adventures. However, the raves and compliments I got were about the bacon top & the delicious sauce so it may be equally tasty without the things I added.

I've only been cooking since I got married in May and today my husband said, "This could be my favorite meal ever....well at least I know its my favoirte one you've made!" He ate a second helping for both of us! I am so thrilled! I thought it was a bit sweet for my taste and I didn't even put all the sugar required in it but I loved the flavor and I agree to cut up the beacon before cooking, Its easier to eat! Thank you!!!!

My kids really liked the meatloaf and so did I.  I just found it to be a little on the sweet side that is why I have it 4 stars.  I will definately make it again but I will add less brown sugar since ketchup already contains corn syrup.

This is a great recipe! I didn't have any bacon- but it didn't matter, still great. I was skeptical about the butter-flavored crackers (I used Club)but thought I'd try the recipe anyway! My whole family loved it! Even my husband liked it and he dosen't like meatloaf!

My husband is a picky eater and not a meatloaf fan, but he calmly said this was good...if I wanted to fix it again that would not bother him.  My son loved it!  Unfortunely, because I'm eating a specific diet I could not try it, but from observation it came out of the oven looking good and it did not fall apart as I've read in some reviews...perfect texture.  I did use lean ground beef.  I also followed the recipe, but halved it.  I did not pack the brown sugar.  It sure smelled good!

I love the bacon on the top. I used twice as much to cover the whole top with bacon strips. This is a favorite recipe of ours now. I have made it numerous times. I put the glaze on earlier though because we like it to get gooey and brown some.

I work at a residential group home for teenage girls in foster care, and EVERY SINGLE ONE (even the self-professed meatloaf haters) cheered for this recipe. I tripled it to feed all twelve girls and two staff, and lowered the amount of brown sugar, as suggested. Such an awesome flavor!

I give this a 5 star - This is a keeper, all I can say is its great.  For those who found it greasy -- simply use good quality hamburger--meat loaf should always be made w/lean ground beef -- If you want to omitt the brown sugar from the meat do so;  however I forgot to add it, & it was still delicious.  I would however add it in the future for it sounds perfect.

This is the best meatloaf recipe I have ever tried. Didn't have the butter flavored crackers so I used saltine crackers. Also used 7 slices of crispy precooked bacon which I had in the freezer which will give you the flavor but less grease. Be sure and use very lean beef. Baked in an oblong pyrex baking dish. It did take about 20-30 minutes longer to cook than the listed time. It was delicious and not greasy at all. After baking, I put in oven broiler to brown top being careful not to burn.

Thought I would give this a try since I love to cook and try new recipes.  My mother-in-law loves meatloaf with brown sugar but we did not really care for this one, it fell apart and did not have much texture.  She does like the brown sugar meatloaf recipe on this site, so I will continue to make that one for her.  This comes as a personal preference for us.  Thanks for the post.

Well this was pretty awful.  The meatloaf was bland and mushy and fell apart when I cut and served it, and the sauce was ghastly sweet.  I'll keep looking.

Oh my gosh this was good. My husband, who is not a fan of meatloaf at all loved this. I took the leftovers to work and everyone wants the recipe. I did as others did and cut the brown sugar in half and it turned out great.

I made a distinct change and used Morningstar crumbles (vegetarian) for this recipe!  This is a great recipe - vegetarian or not!

Fixed this just as the recipe stated, only took out the onions.  I did not use a loaf pan as it would have been to greasy. I used a pan that allowed the pan juices to go to the bottom. That being said this was wonderful! 10 yr old son and wife loved it. A keeper for sure.

Some adjustments to this.  Only used 1 egg 1/2 ketchup, sautéed the onion and added some sautéed red pepper. Four strips of bacon across the top as well.

pretty good but the glaze was a bit too strong. halve the glaze to put on the meatloaf and save the rest for people who might want to include it

I just got married and wanted to try out something different for my husband. This recipe was excellent. He loved it. I did however add green peppers and I think next time I would add maybe a little more crackers, so it will hold together a little better. The sauce was so good. I was able to save some for the side and I added a little after warming up the next day. It tasted even better the second day. Thank you for such a great recipe. I will be making this one again.

With a few changes this was absolutely amazing and loved by all the glaze really has great flavour.  The only changes I did was saute the onions in butter and add garlic salt to the mixture, next time I may add a tiny bit extra ketchup, oh and I added 5 extra cooking minutes, this is a new family favourite

I was looking for a different meatloaf recipe and found this. I decided to fix it for dinner last night. My husband and I loved it. I will be fixing it again. We liked the sweet taste the brown sugar gave it.

This is hands-down the most unique, delicious meatloaf I've ever eaten!  It shouldn't even be called meatloaf . . . as it barely resembles it.

This was just too sweet and unflavorful for my taste, though I'm glad so many folks enjoyed it. I cut the sugar in half for both the meat and the sauce, then halved the sauce completely. I didn't think the bacon added much to the recipe either. On the plus side I did not taste the vinegar and the texture of the loaf was excellent.

This was an excelent meatloaf. I didnt have butter flavored crackers, so I used a mixture of misc. leftover crackers. (cheese flavored, grain, etc...). Next time though I will decrease the glaze topping in half.

Very moist meatloaf.  Even though I cut the brown sugar in the meat to 3 tsp., it was still sweeter than I'm used to, but my husband loved it.  He especially liked the glaze.  I did not have enough ketchup so I added a small amount of Coeur d' Alene's Carmelized Onion sauce.  It gave the glaze a smoked onion flavor. Yummy.

My boyfriend at it 3 times the first night and 2 times the second so it must be good. I left out the onion because I didn't have it and put in garlic powder instead. I did not find this too sweet as some said but that is personal preference. The bacon was such a good ideal I put on 3 slices.

I have made meatloaf like this for a very long time.  By trying this recipe, I realized the thing I was missing was the sauce topping.  Very wonderful.  I made with Suzy's Mashed Potatoes.  I only made half the sauce like others had suggested, but would make it all and top my potatoes with it.  Excellent!!!

I am pretty picky about meatloaf and this one surprised me.  I didn't think it would be as good as it turned out.  I read the reviews before making it and took some of the suggestions...fabulous. This one made it into my family recipe cookbook as a keeper.

The flavor was good with this. I did not add the onions....husbands not a big fan of them. I did find this meatloaf to be firm on the edges and mush on the inside...it fell apart. My husband ate it with his fingers just to rub it in.

I followed this recipe exactly, and I have to say that the leftovers for lunch the next day were amazing; the flavors had a chance to really come alive.  My husband loved it, we have made this several times already.  Thank you for sharing Duano.

This is so good.  I have never been a cook and my kids make fun of me in the kitchen.  When I made this, one of my kids asked how I made meat into a dessert, and my two kids and boyfriend ate the entire loaf in a single setting.  I now cut the sugar in half in both the meat and sauce, and cut the whole sauce recipe in half because it made too much.

This was good and I really do not like meatloaf.  I used 1/2 cup Ketchup, 1/2 cup BBQ sauce for the glaze.  I would also cook longer next time as consistency was mushy.  I like the idea of broiling it to crisp bacon before the glaze and maybe also a few minutes at the end.

My family is not a fan of meatloaf, but they loved this meatloaf. I will be using this recipe from now on. The only modifications that I will make in the future will be, to add only half of the brown sugar and vinegar to the sauce. Thanks for this excellent recipe.

I love this recipe. We normally don't like meatloaf, but I thought I'd try it anyway. The only modifications I make are to lessen the sweetness a bit. The glaze is a little much, so I use about half the amount. The bacon adds a lot of flavor. Overall, very good!

This is a very good meatloaf.  It is on the sweet side, but in a good way and we like that.  I like the tang of the sauce, much better than just plain catsup.

This was the best meatloaf I have ever tasted!  I will make less of the dressing for next time (it was a little too much sweetness I think), but I will definitely make this again.

This recipe was wonderful. Great flavor great consistency. The only thing I changed was I used 1lb of mild sausage and 1lb of hamburger. My husband had complained my previous meatloaf recipe did not have "enough tomato flavor". He absolutely loved this one! The vinegar and mustard in the sauce kept it from tasting like someone just poured a bottle of ketchup on top of it.

This meatloaf was delicious, except there was way too much glaze. Next time I'll use 1/2 to 3/4 of what the recipe instructed. I also added garlic and cayenne pepper to the loaf for a little extra "kick!"

What a hit this meatloaf was! I am known for trying all sorts of meatloaves just for the fun of it. Out of maybe 50 different recipes I now have 4 that are my all time favorites and this Amish Meatloaf is one of those 4! Both of my little girls LOVED it ~ and one isn't even a fan of meatloaf. Just enough sweetness to make it kid friendly and the bacon is a plus for those who enjoy the *bacon burger* taste. Thanks so much for passing this recipe on! I will be making this one quite often! :o)

This was easy to make.  I used spicy ketchup and it tasted great.  I did not know what sweat crackers are and used crushed white cheddar cheeze-its .  Turned out great and everybody loved it.  
next time I will make two and freeze one for later.

I have been making this Amish meatloaf for several years. First off I use a mixture of meats such as ground beef and ground pork or ground lamb. I prefer to use a bottled barbecue sauce inside the meat as well as on top that is not too sweet. Butter crackers like townhouse  are a must. Use a good quality bacon and Sweet yellow onions chopped fine.  You won’t be disappointed.

Delicious!!! I halved the recipe because it was only for 2 of us.  The only change I made was I put more bacon slices on top.  Wonderful flavor, my husband LOVED it and so did I.  This will be my only meatloaf recipe from now on.

I never liked meatloaf till I randomly found this recipe. My dad asked me one day if I could make him meatloaf knowing I don’t eat it. So I looked around and tried this. AMAZING everyone I know has tried it now and loves it. It is sweet but just make some salty mashed potatoes and your good to go!!!!

I made a half-batch because there are only two of us.  We both liked the flavor, but we both thought the "glaze" was too sweet and probably we will use 1/2 the brown sugar in it next time.  Also, the "glaze" never became a glaze... it stayed liquid so it was like sauce.  I would recommend adding it 30 minutes before the loaf is done instead of 15 minutes.

WAY, WAY, WAY TOO SWEET!! I followed directions specifically and it smelled and looked good, but it's so sweet it's like candied meatloaf. I managed half a piece before I couldn't handle anymore and ended up with a terrible stomach ache. My husband is not a fan either, agreeing that this is HANDS DOWN the WORST meatloaf we have ever eaten period. I will not be wasting my time in the future on this recipe when there are so many other awesome ones to choose from. Also, the consistency was nothing but mush, not a bit of crisp or firmness. Soggy mush is the best I can describe it. Super displeased by this meatloaf.

Had a good flavor.    It fell apart though on me when I took it out of the pan.   Most likely my fault though.   Wouldn't blame the recipe.

I'm glad I read other reviews first so I cut down on the sugar as well.  I used 3/4 cup natural ketchup only inside the meat loaf, I only used 2 cups crackers, and added some garlic powder and ground pepper. For the topping, I used only 3/4 cup ketchup, 2 tsp apple cider vinegar, 1-1/2 tablespoon mustard and 1/4 cup brown sugar. I still thought it was sweet. I may cut back on the brown sugar next time. Other wise, it was a good meatloaf. I will use this as my base recipe and play with it some more.

This was way too sweet! I followed the recipe exactly except for the bacon. We had one slice for dinner and I had to throw the whole loaf out the next day. I was hoping once it was cold we could make sandwiches, but it was still too sweet. The only reason I gave it 1 star is because the sauce that you put on top was pretty good. It could be used on a "normal" meatloaf. So disappointed!

I didn't have buttery crackers so just used plain bread crumbs.  It was by far the best meatloaf I ever made. The sweet tomato topping was amazing. My grandkids loved it and my son-in-law ate all the leftovers.

I really liked this recipe. Usually meatloaf is kind of bland and boring, but the sweet and sour glaze was wonderful. Will definitely be using this recipe from now on.

Best meatloaf recipe I've ever made.. Very flavorful and not too heavy like some of the other recipes I've tried.

This was a great change from the ordinary meatloaf. Lots of negative comments, but frankly the whole family liked it.

I thought this was a super meatloaf recipe. Although I did make make a few changes due to ingredients on hand. I discovered I only had just less than a cup of crushed crackers so I used oatmeal for for the remaining cup. I also had some celery I wanted to use up, so I chopped up a couple stalks. I love the balance of flavor from Trader Joe's "21 Seasoning Salute" so I shook that several times over the mixture. Finally, since I cooked the loaf in a 9x13 (2lbs is a lot of meat!), I was able to place about 6 strips of bacon on top -a welcomed change by my bacon loving husband. Overall a great recipe. We will be making this one again for sure!

Very good but a bit too sweet. I am going to make it tonight and cut down to just a tablespoon of the brown sugar in  the meatloaf. I loved the topping though. I did add a bit more apple cider  vinegar than what was called for.

My husband loves meatloaf and this one is especially a favorite! I used crushed Ritz crackers and the meat turned out buttery and so so moist! I will definitely make again.

This is by far the best meatloaf I've ever had. The only change I made was cooking the bacon half way before topping the meatloaf with it. It was a little too soft for me the first time I made it.

We enjoyed this meatloaf, it remind us of a bbq meatball recipe that I make but a lot less time consuming. I did make a couple changes as suggested and added some garlic powder and black pepper, delicious

This is the most amazing meatloaf and the only one my family will eat. The only change I made, and this was out of laziness, was  that i bought a bottle of Hunts sweet honey bbq sauce from the store.

Excellent as is!! My husband and sons love this. Yes, it is sweet, but the bacon and mustard give it a nice contrast. A nice change from traditional ketchupy loafs. I bake this formed on a foil lined jelly roll pan vs loaf pan for extra texture (I've done it both ways). Nice a moist. You can use extra bacon- if it's thick cut microwave for a few minutes to par-cook. Serve w mashed potatoes yum yum love this reciepe

The only change I made is that I turned it out onto a parchment lined sheet pan. This allows the grease to drain away and for the meatloaf to get crispy on all sides.

It was really good! Used less ketchup and brown sugar than the recipe, probably about 1/2 of each. The sauce was great. I didn't pour all of it over to bake, but used the rest as a dipping sauce.  Yum!

This recipe is a wonderful starting point.  I cut the eggs and crackers in half, omitted putting ketchup in with the meat mixture, but added one rib of celery and puréed it with the onion before adding to the meat.  Shaped with loaf pan, but turned out onto a foil lined baking dish.  I baked for 10 mins at 425 degrees and then turned down to 375 for the rest of the hour.  I added cumen instead of mustard (my hubby is allergic) to the ketchup and spread on for the last 15mins of baking.

I also spooned off any accumulated fat in the meatloaf baking dish and used it on a cut up yellow potato that I baked alongside the meatloaf for the last 30 mins of baking.  If you have a much larger baking dish than I had, I would have just thrown it right in with the meatloaf, making sure to turn them over once for even browning.

Enjoy!

Loved this recipe!  Made a few modifications.  Cut down the cracker crumbs to 1 1/2 cups and added a little granulated garlic and Worcestershire sauce to the meat.  Cut the brown sugar down to 1/8 cup and the ketchup to 1/2 cup.  Cut the gravy topping in 1/2.  I ran out of ketchup so used 1/4 cup ketchup and 1/4 cup bbq sauce.  I too cooked it 15 extra minutes.  3 strips of bacon...It was fantastic.

I love this meatloaf!   The first time I made it as written and although good it was too sweet for me. I now omit the brown sugar from the meatloaf completely. I also omit the bacon.  The rest remains the same. Half the glaze recipe is sufficient. My pan won't hold more anyways. 

I slice and freeze the leftover loaf and bring for lunch at work. I get compliments on the delicious smell. :)

I've made meatloaf numerous ways. I thought I would try this recipe because I have eaten Amish meatloaf while visiting Lancaster ,Pa. , and loved it. This recipe tasted just like I was in Amish country!! Loved It! The whole family loved it! I made it exactly as directed, except used a 9 x 13 glass pan. Wouldn't change a thing! There was extra sauce, but we put it on the leftovers the next day> will definitely make again, Thank you for this recipe. YUM!!

I've made adjustments to this recipe that are probably the reason why I'm rating it 5 stars. I added 1 TBSP garlic powder, 1 TBSP onion powder, 2 TBSP liquid smoke (hickory), 2 TBSP worchestshire sauce, 1 green pepper (equal amount to the onion). I only added 2 TBSP of brown sugar to the meat, and halved the amount of the sauce. Because the recipe's amount is way too much for me. The bacon was a really nice touch and candied the texture by baking it covered in sauce. If I would've made the recipe without my additions, it would've been way to sweet for me. My husband LOVED it and so did I. I will make my version again for sure!
Oh, and I cooked it for an additional 15-18 minutes also.

Made changes because I feel like I need to add my own spin to things. Added black garlic and three cloves minced garlic. Supplemented ketchup with home made marinara. Added a bit of seasoning salt. Added fresh ground pepper. Laid bacon crosswise after cutting slices in half. Used convection oven.

Oh my goodness!!!! It was so good. The sweetness was amazing!! It did fall apart, but who cares! Would be great for spaghetti sauce, sheppard's pie, sloppy joe, and meatloaf!!!!!!

I tried this recipe last weekend, except I just layered the whole top of the meatloaf with bacon, that way every bite had bacon in it. This recipe was delicious! Best meatloaf ever. I also used garlic butter flavored club crackers instead of just butter flavored. It is sweet but when you combine it with the smoky bacon flavor, it is a perfect combination.

I have been using this recipe for years now and thought it was time to give my review.  This is by far the best "meatloaf" recipe I have found.  I do cut the sugar back by 1/2.  I also cut my baking time by 15 minutes as in a 9 x 13 glass dish it gets over done for 1 hour.  Also my mom and sister both use this recipe now.  Great keeper...

Excellent recipe, my step-daughter wasn't crazy about the idea of meatloaf for dinner this evening, but, when it was ready she seemed impressed, my wife liked it as well. I added about 1/2 tsp. of tobasco sauce to the "glaze" after I cut the glaze recipe in half. I didn't have eggs so it fell apart a little bit, but, it was delicious. Will be using this recipe again.

My family loved this. Especially my picky 5 yr. old. He never has seconds on anything. but will go back for more of this. Everyone i have made it for has gone home with the recipe. I am making it tonight. I had to go to the store in below zero weather for some ingredients but will be so worth it. Thank you!

This meatloaf is GREAT!!  A nice change from your traditional style meatloaf.  I cut the sauce in half because it seemed like too much, but I did use more bacon on top than the recipe suggests.  Turned out so good that we all argued over the leftovers!

This recipe is a good change to regular meatloaf.  I didn't have any crackers on hand, so I used bread crumbs.  I think I needed more because the meatloaf was a little soggy, but the flavor of the sauce more than made up it!  This is perfect for a weeknight dinner when you need something that is quick and easy.

Being a newly wed, I was looking to try anything.   This recipe was given to me and let me tell you that my husband loved it!   It is one of his favorite meals now!  I do make a couple of adjustments.  I add a cup of water to the sauce so that it is not so sweet and I increase the cook time by almost 15 minutes.  To help save on some calories in this high cal meal, I sometimes make it without the bacon.  This recipe also freezes well, too!

Excellent base for a meatloaf! It is an excellent blend of sweet and savory. I added diced green pepper and fresh minced garlic to add some crunch and depth.

Good meatloaf.  Used Ritz vegetable crackers and only used 1/2.  Omitted the mustard just because we didn't have a taste for it at the time and it was good!

I've made this recipe several times and it's become our favorite meatloaf by far.I did make some changes though. I use vegetable ritz crackers instead of regular ritz and I use evaporated milk (about 1/2 cup)in place of the eggs.I shape it into a loaf and bake it in a 9x13 pan instead of a loaf pan.I don't make the glaze to put on top because my son doesn't like "saucy" stuff on meatloaf and it comes out very tasty anyway. great recipe!!

Oh my gosh I just made this tonight and I've declared I will no longer make any other meatloaf! It is a sweet meatloaf, so don't try it if you don't like that. But if you grew up with meatloaf topped with bacon and ketchup - this is like that only way better! It is very moist but stays together well. I used two of the disposable loaf pans (they are too small to hold the whole thing in one), other than that I followed the recipe exactly.

Good recipe! I tried it, and it was very tasty! However, when I try it again, I will leave out the brown sugar. It was a little to sweet for me. Thanks for the recipe.

My husband does not usually like Meatloaf.  He loves this recipe!  It's very moist and has amazing flavor.  I have tried several of the other top rated meatloaf recipes on this site and this is my favorite hands down!

I absolutely love this meatloaf!  I've made it several times, for both sides of the family and everyone loves it!  Instead of making it in a loaf pan, I make it in a 9x13 dish with a rack in it....this helps to allow the grease to drain to the bottom of the pan and not soak into the meatloaf.  I use 1 pound ground beef, and 1 pound ground pork and skip the bacon~~delicious!

I've tried to make meatloaf before, and it hasn't turned out.  This recipe; however, was awesome!  My boyfriend and I loved it!

I only have mini bread pans, so I split one pound of hamburger into 2 pans; that worked fine.  The only thing was that the loaf was hard to get out of the pan in slices.  I'm not sure what to do about that.  It crumbled when I dished it; it was more like "meatpile" than "meatloaf", but it tasted great! 

Thanks for the recipe.  I will be using it again!

I've been making this recipe for a few years.  My family loves it.  I do have to cook it a little longer than it says, and I've left out the bacon.  Also, I cut in half the recipe for the sauce on top.  I can't imagine making a dry old boring meatloaf after making this one.

wow! this is what meatloaf is supposed to taste like! i know a lot of reviewers complained about the sweetness, but i love it. the only change i made was that i added chopped green peppers and minced fresh garlic to the onions and sauteed all of it in olive oil until almost tender before adding to the mix. definitely halve the glaze recipe. and next time i make it i'll use only 2c. of ritz.

This recipe has gotten such good reviews but we did not care for it. Both the meatloaf and the sauce were much too sweet. We needed to bake it for 90 minutes. The bacon on top seemed like a good idea but seemed out of place and never really got crispy. We won't be having this again.

I love this recipe and have been making it for years. There were alot of kids on our street and everytime i make this dish every kid in our neighborhood is at my door asking over and over is it done yet... Once done there is never anything left of it..... only thing i would change would be the type and amount of crackers. I use regular saltine crackers and about 2 1/2 cups... but all in all a great and wonderful recipe. My son although grown and left home still ask me to make this. I have also passed the recipe on to my daughters as well

This was quite good,although I really felt it was a bit too sweet. Especially cold in a sandwich. I will make again but will reduce or maybe leave out the brown sugar.

This meatloaf was great. I made a couple additions (garlic, ginger and about 1/4 cup of beer) to make it a little more to my family's taste. Big hit, will make again

YUM!! This was my first try at making meatloaf and it turned out great.  To those who have said it turns out with too much fat, you have to use a low fat meat.  I use 96% lean and it turns out great.  I've also used ground buffalo which is extremely lean but you have to adjust the cooking time.  Instead of covering the top in sauce, I just put a small layer on top and serve the rest in a bowl at the table.

My family could not get enough of this meatloaf.  My son said he didn't like it, he loved it!! (He's such a picky eater.)  I wasn't too sure about the brown sugar, but it was very good.  This is a keeper.

I made this dinner last night and we both found this meatloaf to be good. The reason I gave it four stars was because we both thought it was just a little sweet.  I have always added brown sugar to my meatloaf before but not quite this much.  Also, this recipe didn't call for spices but I added a little salt, pepper, and garlic powder because all savory recipes need a little.  Before this I would just throw a meatloaf together and sometimes it was great and sometimes it wasn't.  I wanted a recipe to follow to get some consistancy to my meatloaf and I will use this recipe again.

Adding a bit of Worcestishire sauce, maybe 1T, to both the meat and the sauce added more 'depth' to each without overwhelming. Borrowing from another recipe, I added a few tsp. mustard to the sauce for 'tang'. I thought 2# meat was too much, so used 1# gr sirloin and .5# pork + 2c oatmeal (looking to reduce fat and add health benefits)which made a good 9" loaf. Because I would bake mine outside of the loaf pan to avoid having it sit in its own grease, I added 1/4c milk to the meat mixture for more moisture. The xcess fat drained away from the meat... slices held together well w/no falling apart, yet it was still moist and yummy!! The sauce is fantastic! I love another reader's idea of serving extra on the side...

This was good but did totally fall apart.  It's not something you would want to serve to people other than your family b/c is not appealing to the eyes!  I think it has to do with all the grease.  I didn't add the sugar to the meat but did to the glaze and it was plenty sweet.  I can't imagine how sweet it would be in the meat.   But it tasted great for meatloaf!

I made this for my husband (with a couple of variations).  First, I made it with ground turkey since that was what I had in the house.  Then, I put 4 slices of bacon on top (because my husband loves bacon).  We were a little nervous about the ground turkey, but it was still delicious!  I will definately make it again - I'm sure it will be even better with ground beef.

My husband and I loved this recipe!  We enjoyed the sweetness - it put some zing into plain meatloaf. I made just half of the sauce as others suggested and it was plenty.  Will definately use this recipe again!

My family loved this meatloaf.  We did not find it "wet", nor did we think it was to sweet.  I only used 1/2 the glaze and used the remaining "glaze" to put on top of the individual slices!  Everyone has asked for this to be in our monthly menu rotation!

This recipe does have a "sweet" taste but very good! The glaze next time I will cut in half the amount I make, ended up throwing half away because as recipe is written it makes way too much. It doesn't hold together too well, but taste definitely makes up for that.

This is the best meatloaf I have tasted. The buttered crackers really add to the flavor and texture. Unfortunately I misplaced the recipe and spent almost an hour searching online for it and I'm sure glad i found it. Give it a try, it's fantastic!

The flavor is very good but it does fall aprt easily. Even the next day is was still very unstable but definitely worth eating.

This was so yummy, I didn't change one thing about the recipe, well I did add one extra piece of bacon on top of the meatloaf. It didn't hold together very well, but I didn't mind that, food gets mushed in your mouth anyway! LOL This will definitley take place as my new meatloaf recipe! My husband, myself, my 4 year old and 12 month old each had 2 helpings!

This was SO good, I can't wait to make it again.  I went easy on the brown sugar as recommended by previous reviewers and used turkey bacon...it was absolutely delicious.

My plan was to give this a really bad review. No offense, but this meatloaf came out like a "meat pudding" which I served with a spoon rather like normal meatloaf. It came together like a dream, baked up well, smelled good and then crumbled into wet chunks when I cut it. Fortunatly, the wet chunks were very tasty, all my kids and my husband had seconds, and I found myself spooning extra bites after mine was gone too. Hubby said it was "really good meatloaf" and sheepishly had a third serving. So, I am giving it 4 stars, 5 for taste and 3 for appearance. :). By the way, the next day, the loaf seemed to "set up" a bit and could be cut and served the way meatloaf should: with a knife!

I thought this was great. Next time I may add some celery to the meat, as it's missing a little "chunkiness," which I like. Very good, though, and I will make it again.

This meatloaf was okay...I made mine with meatloaf mix (beef, veal, and pork), and it developed an unusual orange color. I liked the bacon, but the sauce was way too sweet, it ended up tasting like "meat candy". I might make this again with less sugar.

Ok I've been making this recipes for 4 years now and every time I do, people ask me for it. I made it a couple of weeks ago, and my boyfriends best friend is coming over for dinner tomorrow so she can try it. This is just amazing. I have not changed anything in it, and often just make the glaze to make sweet and sour chicken, it tastes so good with all the crisp veggies and pineapple.  

Can't wait to do dig into this again!

******************************************

I love meatloaf and this was absolutely divine. The ketchup and brown sugar mixed in the meat gives it a wonderful flavor, though I would use more bacon on top. Also the "sauce" was delecious and so simple, I am thinking of using it as a glaze on chicken. Adding a few more spices would make it a nice bbq sauce. Will definitely be making again!

Delicious!  Whole family enjoyed this.  The sauce was awesome.  Make sure you have a 9x5 pan (Mine was 9x3 can't fit in all of the sauce) This is replaces our usual meatloaf recipe.

My family LOVED this! I sent the recipe to my mom and she loved it, too, and she usually isn't a meatloaf fan. I'll have to say I was a little worried when I got it out of the oven. It was a little mushy, but we tasted it and didn't care! It was delicious!

One of the best meatloaf recipes. I did 
change some of the hamburger with hot sausage. Made it alittle more greasy but just drained it before adding the sauce.

This is alot like the meatloaf my mom makes, except for the bacon.  I really like the flavor it adds to the dish. I've always use Rits instead of bread crumbs and diced onion.  My family loved this one.

We all loved this recipe! Instead of putting 2 slices of bacon on top though, I covered the entire loaf with strips of bacon and omitted the sauce on top.  Yummy!!!

My husband and I really enjoyed this.  The sauce makes a lot, I found we didn't need quite the whole amount.  Also, I would recommend cutting the bacon into 1" pieces - it wants to slide off the top when cutting down through the loaf.

This was very good, but I did not put any sugar into the actual meat. That definitely would have been overkill. I used ground turkey and the bacon gave it a really nice flavor. Thanks Duano!

This is a great recipe!! Only changes I made.... I used 1 lb of ground pork instead of the 2nd lb of hamburger. I used a package of saltines (didnt bother to measure)Dried onions cause I didn't have fresh and kept the 1/4 c of UNPACKED brown sugar in the loaf itself and 1/4 c in the sauce. It turned out beautiful. My suggestion to those who said the loaf was crumbly...Use higher quality beef (80/20 or less fat). We are blessed to be able to get a side of beef so we have lower fat beef, that is my only guess as to why it may be crumbling, mine turned out firm but not dry! Thanks for an awesome recipe!!

It was good but too sweet.  This time I halved the amount of sugar in the meatloaf and in the glaze.  Next time I will try using NO sugar in meatloaf and 1/4 in glaze.  I liked the bacon and the crackers.  Make sure to use a meatloaf pan because otherwise, it is TOO greasy.  Also, saute onion in butter (and garlic if you like).

I really liked the sweetness, not as much as my husband though.  I did not have the bacon, and I used crutons, and bell peppers, and dark brown sugar.  It was really good, and extreamly different.  Way too much katchup. The cold left overs were better than when it was just made!! Next time I will only use half the amount of katchup.

Great recipe.  The only changes/additions I made were adding a handful of shredded cheddar cheese before mixing and using homemade chili sauce instead of the ketchup and brown sugar.  The topping is a must because it MAKES the meatloaf.

Good, but I ran out of ketchup so I just put Kraft BBQ Sauce on top. It was more of as sweet rather than savory meatloaf but yummy. I cook it in a muffin tin which cut the cooking time in half!

I found this to be just okay. I thought it came out to dry, but then that could be the cooks fault{ which is me}. The glaze was a good topper though, and it made a good sandwich the next day. May be I cooked it to long ,don't know but I will give it a second try.

Five stars isn't high enough for this meatloaf recipe.  The brown sugar makes it different from any meatloaf recipe I have ever made.  It is absolutely delicious and makes wonderful meatloaf sandwiches.  I don't make the glaze with mine, but in my opinion, the loaf stands on it's own without it. If you try this meatloaf, you will never go back to your "old" meatloaf recipe.

This recipe is addictive. The only change I made was adding heavily buttered chicken broth from another recipe I was  making. Single ladies, recommended particularly when you want to knock the socks off a meat and potatoes sort of man.

This was good, but  I agree, the sauce is very sweet. It is a nice change of pace from a savory meatloaf. I may make it again.

We didn't like the glaze but loved the meatloaf!  There was way too much glaze and it was too sweet.  Will definitely make meatloaf again and just top with a little ketchup.

Yummy!!!!  I halfed the brown sugar in the sauce as others suggested and it was perfect.  Next time I will make extra sauce to put on the table.  I paired this with Suzy's mashed potatoes from this site and I got rave reviews.  This will be my only meat loaf recipe from now on!  Thanks!

I made this meatloaf last night exactly as directed. My five and four year old liked it a lot. My husband and I thought the meat had great flavor. The glaze was a bit too sweet for our taste. I was just thrilled my kids didn't notice the onions in it.

I am new to this site, and this was my first recipe from here. Outstanding!  the glaze is very sweet, and for my taste, i only used about a third of it on top before baking, but the rest was on the table for whoever wanted a little more.  Good Stuff.

Very Good! Only changes I made were to add 2 cloves of garlic minced ( my family loves garlic ) and used BBQ sauce instead of Ketchup. I will use this recipe again often!

it was good but VERY sweet. I did what some of the other people recomended and cooked longer and with some cheese on top of the sauce. My girlfriend loved (she likes sweet things). For me I put some fire juice on it and perfect.

This is the most moist and delicious meatloaf I've ever made or ever tasted.  After it sits for a day or so and the flavors have time to go through it even more, it gets even better when served as a leftover.  If you're a meatloaf fan, you will definitely love this one.

This is a great recipe.  I love it,  my family loves and they ask me to make it all the time.  The only change I made was that I added a couple extra bacon strips in the middle and an extra on top.  Fills two meatloaf pans and the extra sauce is great for meatloaf sandwiches the next day.

Now I understand why people like bacon cheeseburgers with barbecue sauce (which I've never tried). I thought this ws great! Next time I'm going to add some extra seasonings and shredded cheddar to the meatloaf and top it with 4 strips of bacon instead of just 2. Yummm!!

sweet, but not too sweet.  I agree that 1/2c. in the glaze would have been too much sugar.  I used 1 lb. sausage and 1 lb. ground beef.  This made more than the recipie said it would.  I had enough for two loafpans, so I made one and froze the other raw.  The glaze also made a lot.  Also it was not very loaf like until the next day, but that didn't matter much too me.

This meatloaf is very moist and flavorful. I added red peppers to the ground beef and didn't need to add salt or peer. I would recommend cutting back on the brown sugar by a 1/4 that is used in the glaze because it was too sweet. Other than that, it was delicious.

This is EXCELLENT! This is our only meatloaf recipe now! The butter flavored (Club)crackers give it a great taste. This is a must try. We didn't change a thing! Thank you so much!

This recipe is amazing. I made this for my husband(he is a meatloaf fan)& he said it was the best meatloaf he ever had.  My brother & I are not meatloaf fans at all & we couldn't get over how amazing this recipe is.  My brother said I should make it & sell it to restaurants.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe that even the kids now beg me to make!!

It was a great recipe.  Just make sure you have a full bottle of Ketchup.  I think the next time I make this recipe I will chop up a whole package of bacon and put it in with the meat.  I will make this recipe again.

I liked this recipe and my husband absolutely LOVED it.  He said it was the best meatloaf ever.  He really liked the flavor of the vinigar and bacon, said it reminded him of german potato salad.  This will be the only way I make meatloaf from now on, thanks!
