Fast - yes, easy  - yes, but if you don't like the aftertaste produced by non-fat dairy then I recommend using reduced or low-fat versions. I used Hellman's light mayo and reduced fat sour cream. I also left out the additional dried minced onion and salt as there's plenty in the dry onion soup mix. I put this in the fridge for a few hours before serving to let the flavors come together and just before serving I topped it off with the chopped green onion. Very good with assorted veggies and of course - ruffle cut chips!

If you just do the sour cream, mayonnaise, and dry onion soup it's pretty good.  The dry onion soup has dried onions in it already along with plenty of salt and pepper.  If you want to add a little color, just sprinkle a little green onion on top then the little curtain climbers can dip around the 'green stuff'.  Also, let it chill for at least a couple of hours so the dried onions will soften.  Better yet, do 1 day ahead.

I took the advice of leaving out the green onion, minced onion, salt, and pepper.  So I just used the nonfat sour cream, light mayonnaise, and onion soup mix (I used Wyler's), and it turned out great!  I love it so much better than any store bought dip, and it is really low in fat!  I gave this 4 stars just because of the changes in the recipe.  This is a new favorite.  Thanks for sharing!

Wow!  We love Onion dip, but the onion was a little too strong in this one.  I think the addition of the green onion is a nice touch, for adults, but the kids spent too much time trying to pick the "green stuff" out.  I might try adjusting some of the ingredients and try again another time.

I make this all the time and my guests always lick the bowl clean! I omit the dried onions since the onion soup mix I use already contains some.

My mom used to make this using just the sour cream and the onion soup. You don't need the whole package if you don't want a dip that's too strong. Start with the sour cream and the add a bit of soup and taste as you go along. The taste gets stronger as it sits. If you want some lighter fat potato chips to go with this, make your own! Slice whole potatoes (fairly thinly) rince in cold water, then dry. Line a baking tray with grease proof paper, spread the potatoes in one layer, brush lightly with olive oil and bake around 15 mns at 400 degrees in a preheated oven.

I was not a fan of this, although I might try it with some of the things suggested in the reviews. I may be odd, but I LOVE the store bought Dean's French Onion, and this, as made according to the recipe, just didn't compare.

Of all the ingredients listed,I only had the fat free sour cream. I mixed in 1/2 cup of light mayo and about 1 Tbsn. of McCormick 'California Style' onion powder.Good enough to go with my baked lays on a friday night!

I'm giving this 5 stars because it is SO easy and I can't believe how many people have asked me for the recipe! It's almost embarrassing to tell friends how to make it- it's THAT simple. It's a pretty standard tasting onion dip; the spectacular part is the simplicity!

I make this now with my own homemade onion soup "mix", which is a little healthier than the packaged without the added MSG plus it's vegan-friendly. I do add just a touch garlic powder and up the chopped green onion a bit. This is a great recipe to have on hand for unexpected guests or last minute get-togethers. NOTE: This is a great low-cal topping for roasted veggies and I like to dip organic carrot chips in this.

This dip was easy enough to make, but it was too salty.  I recommend adding more green onion and using only half a packet of the onion soup mix- and not adding the minced dried onion at all.  I made it as stated, but it still was just okay.

Adding the green onions helped and it had a good taste, however, be warned that this can be very salty!! I'm not sure if it varies among the onion soup mixes, but ours ended up a little salty. Overall, it's better than the pre-made store, but again beware the saltiness ;)

This dip is pretty good, but I thought the onion overpowered it....I'll stick to my version of 1 16oz carton of sour cream and 1 package dry onion soup mix, mix and refridgerate a few hours until flavors meld and onions soften.  It's so easy that we never buy onion dip at the store anymore!

Love this dip. my family just gobbled it up;) we just put 3 ingredients together sour cream, mayo, 1/2 pouch our onion soup mix. Very very tasty... will not be buying from the store again. Excellent with just plain ripple chips.

a great dip that can be made dairy-free by using dairy free sour creme.  be sure to chill before serving, though, as it doesn't taste nearly as well if you don't.

I like the recipe the way it's written and with some of the suggested changes. It's much better than what I can buy and I usually have all these ingredients on hand, so I can make it when I want instead of having to get it on my grocery list.

A big hit in this house. I did leave out the green onion, just because I find it a little overpowering. One friend said he could eat this with a spoon and I don't think he was joking. Thanks so much Sal.

You don't need all of the additions to make a good onion dip. I put the green onion on top as a garnish.

I used Dry Onion Soup Mix  made with sodium free Herbox to make this low in sodium. It is a fast and easy family favourite and with lightly salted chips I don't feel too guilty!
