I was amazed by how good this was.  

I cooked it for 7 minutes and was disappointed because it was so thin, but at 8 minutes it really started to thicken up and I ended up cooking it for about 10-11 minutes.

I served it warm in wine glasses with a dollop of whipped cream. It made 5 servings for me.  Everyone loved it and it's such an easy way to use cooked rice.
Thank you so much for this recipe, I will be making this again often.

I have finally found a recipe for rice pudding that I like as much as store bought.  I made 2 batches and I like the one I created a little better.  From my second batch I deleted the cinnamon and added 1 tsp vanilla.  When you serve the pudding you can sprinkle with cinnamon.  This is the best recipe for rice pudding... so easy!!!!

I had a craving for rice pudding but didn't have the time to do it the "old-fashioned" way, so this recipe came in handy. I wasn't going for the best tasting rice pudding ever, more for a quick, easy, close to tasting perfect type. :)

I made a few changes to the recipe. Instead of using evaporated milk which grosses me out, I replaced it with 1 1/2 cups coconut milk, and 1/2 cup regular milk. I only added 1/4 c of sugar so it didn't over power the hint of coconut. I added two eggs and a tsp of real vanilla extract. All in all it came out perfectly and it's a great way to get rid of left over rice.

Wow!!!  This was a fantastic recipe of one of my all time favorite desserts.  I kicked up the flavor, by adding 1/2 tsp. vanilla & 1/8 tsp. grated nutmeg.  Thanks for bringing back a favorite.

It was very easy and quick I like recipes like this.  The only thing I changed was I used cinnamon sticks instead.  Love this recipe. Great for left overs.

This was a clever recipe but it will need some adjusting for my tastes.  I thought it was too sticky and much too sweet.

Yuck!  I make all kinds of home-made puddings, and this just doesn't taste "home-made".  Even adding raisins and a little fresh ground nutmeg couldn't save it.  If you like pudding from the local all-you-can-eat restaurant dessert bar, then you might like the flavor in this very commercial-tasting pudding.  Too sweet, too sticky, and not delecate in flavor at all.  I'll stick to my more labor-intensive, but much better tasting recipes.

I made this recipe last night after having leftover white rice on hand. I followed it exactly as written, and it definetly didnt turn out as good as it sounded. Way too much cinnamon and way to sticky.

I thought this was delicious. It tastes very similar (to me) to Kozy Shack's cinnamon rice pudding. I will definitely be making this again!!

I love the negative reviews just as much as the positive... this is an excellent recipe for leftover rice, and the negative reviews told me that for my tastes I should reduce the cinnamon (or wait until the end to sprinkle it on) and to reduce the sugar to 1/4c instead of 1/2, and add an egg or two. I will definitely play with this delicious & simple recipe to our family's taste, and will be sharing it too.  Thanks, Vannessa!

The recipe is good if you are short on time or just don't want to put in the time for rice pudding the long way.  The taste is good and is comperable to slow cooked rice pudding.  

I am not a fan of cinnamon so I omitted it.  I am however a fan of vanilla so I put in a generous teaspoon.  It tasted completely satisfactory.  I would recommend bringing it to a boil and keep it on high heat.  Stir like crazy for the 5-7 minutes and it will be a lot less runny.

Followed another reviewer's suggestions and used 2 c regular milk and 2 eggs instead of the evaporated milk.  Turned out pretty good, consistency is definitely not the same as when you take the time to do it on the stovetop--turned out looking a lot like what it is: sweetened milk and leftover rice :( This is, however, much faster; I'll probably make it again when I'm pressed for time and be extra careful with the eggs (there may be some operator error in this department), maybe even add one to thicken it up. Overall pretty decent recipe, thanks for sharing.

Edit: Made this again and tempered the eggs more carefully.  Also cooked over higher heat and for longer to thicken it up.  The result was a much creamier, more custard like pudding, but the rice still did not incorporate as well as with a "real" rice pudding.  I think putting the rice in a food processor first might make it a little more "authentic."  I'll try that next time.

I'm sorry, but this is NOT edible with 1 tablespoon of cinnamon. I will try it one more time using 1 teaspoon or less.

This is one recipe I'm glad I read incorrectly, as far as adding a teaspoon of cinnamon instead of a tablespoon! I also had a half can of evaporated milk to use up, so I added a half cup of milk, and alittle extra vanilla. Otherwise everything was keep the same.
I'd make this again, it was very good.

I made this tonight with some leftover cooked rice. My boyfriend and son loved it! I did follow the suggestion of using a tsp of cinnamon instead of a Tbs. Glad I did. A tsp was more than enough.

It was, as advertised, extremely quick and easy to make--and quite tasty. I ended up making a few changes: I swapped out the cinnamon for a tsp of vanilla, and--because I hadn’t realized that I did not have the evaporated milk--I used sweetened condensed milk instead and consequently left  out the sugar.  Very yummy.

Despite following the recipe as is, it never thickened up. The flavor tasted like rice in sweet cinnamon milk.

This was a really great way to use leftover rice.  I did add 1 teaspoon of vanilla along with 1/4 cup 2% milk to make it a little creamier.  I alwasy cover my dishes with plastic wrap so the heat keeps the moisture in and adds to the creaminess.

This was a fast tasty treat. I used half brown rice and half white rice, 1 t. of cinnamon instead of the 1 T. on recipe, 1/2 t. almond extract and splenda instead of sugar. I like my rice pudding cold and then I topped it off with some chopped almonds.

Fine for a shortcut, though I've had better shortcut versions.  For some reason mine turned out a bit slimy.  Tasted all right, but like other reviews, you could halve the cinnamon and it would taste fine.  Wonder if the author meant one teaspoon.  I'll try another recipe next time.

I'm the only one in my family who has sense enough to like rice pudding. I've tried dozens of recipes over the years, all of them good, but this one is the quickest, easiest, and best I've found. I just wish I had come across it sooner. I am divorced and live alone now and I cook up a big batch of rice once a month, freeze it, and use as needed. This is one of my favorite uses for cooked rice. I have substituted skim milk for the evaporated milk and used brown instead of white rice and it's still great. Thanks so much for sharing!

This recipe doesn't stand up to "traditional" rice pudding recipes, but I'm giving it 5 stars because I don't think it was intended to rival regular rice pudding.  If you want the taste of rice pudding and a quick dessert that's tasty, this is the one!  You can even make it with fat free evaporated milk and it still ends up being tasty!

I can only give this 3 stars because there is WAY too much cinnamon in this. I used about 3/4 Tbsp. and still it was overpowering. I also had to cook it covered for about 12 min. to get it thick and creamy.  So as not to waste it, I added vanilla ice cream to our bowls and that cut it a bit. I will try this again when I have leftover rice but only use 1 tsp. cinnamon and know that it wont be ready in just 15 min., it takes longer. Update- I made this again with a tsp of cinnamon and still found it to be a bit much. You could also really taste that it was too sweet. I won't make this again. I am revising this rating down to one star because this is just not a good rice pudding recipe. There are definitely better ones out there.

Quick, easy and very tasty-- I used medium grain rice the 2nd time around and think it came out even better!

This was a very good recipe.  I did have to cook the rice longer for about 8-10 min. for it to thicken & I wasn't sure about using that much cinnamon, but it was delicious and very quick & easy to make.

Very good easy recipe.  I added nutmeg, but other than that it's good as-is.  I poured into ramekins and served at room temperature with cinnamon sprinkled on top.

This recipe is so simple and delicious!  Instead of cinammon I use 1/4 tsp cardomom.  This actually comes out quite thick, I like my pudding slightly more liquidy so next time I think I will reduce the rice to 1.5 cups instead.

I substituted sweetened condensed milk for the sugar and added pumpkin spice too. I have no idea if im supposed to serve this warm or cold but warm seems like the right choice.

Yum! It's not exactly the same as more complex Rice Pudding recipes (of course), but its so quick and easy, and tastes great. I used to use the microwave recipe, but this one gives me the same results, and in less time! I added some vanilla extract, and a pinch of salt to bring out the flavors. My mom really enjoyed it too. Thanks!

I read the reviews and thought I'd try this. Maybe I'm just picky, but this tasted nothing like rice pudding to me. After being in a covered container in the fridge overnight, the rice absorbed all the liquid so I was left with a bowl of sticky, sweet rice the next day. Which I guess is okay, but it's not rice pudding. Next time, I'll try the old fashioned way, I don't think there is a shortcut to good rice pudding.

This is a great way to use up leftover rice. I added vanilla and nutmeg, used 3 cups of rice and even used fat free evaporated milk.  It's great.  Next time, I'm going to try almond extra and lemon zest and serve it w/fresh blueberries.  Thanks for a great recipe.

had leftover rice, no milk so tried this recipe. While it isn't as good as real rice pudding it isn't bad and much quicker. Next time I will use less sugar-way too sweet. I also used less cinnamon and added vanilla at the end.

I have tried other rice puddings in the past where you have to cook the rice first and those recipes take forever! However, this recipe was so simple and easy and took no time at all to make. I love eating rice with cinnamon, sugar and a pat of butter for breakfast or dinner, but wanted to put a 'spin' on an old favorite dish. I came on here to find a quick recipe that I could make in just a few minutes because I needed something in a hurry for my 6 year old to have for dinner. I followed the recipe almost to the letter, but decided to add nutmeg. I cooked the rice, milk and dry ingredients and at the very end of the cooking added 1/4 teaspoon vanilla. I tasted it, but discovered it was not sweet enough. I added a couple tablespoons of sugar (I have at least 3 - 4 cups of rice) and with the vanilla it is a taste treat to be savored, for sure. My usually picky daughter, who hasn't eaten rice since she was a baby loves it!

I likes this recipe it reminds me of my grandmother. I did something different instead I used brown rice in place of the white since there is a higher nutrition value and I cook it till it was thick and it came out great.

WHat a great recipe to use up my leftover rice!  Other recipes call for uncooked rice.  I usually like to make a recipe as is the first time before altering, but by the picture, I could tell I wanted a bit less cinnamon.  I also added about 1/2 tsp vanilla- YUM!  It was delicious warm and also good cold.

I was looking for a way to use up left over rice, and rice pudding sounded good.  I made this and I was very pleased..it was easy and fast.  I don't know if it made a difference or not, but my rice was minute rice, and I was able to add 3 1/2 cups of the rice and still had a good texture...not too dry, or too wet.  Thanks for sharing.

This was so easy that I didn't expect too great of results, but I will never go back to my hours of standing over the stove stirring.... this is YUMMY!!! I added chocolate chips to one batch of still hot pudding and Nutella to another batch. They were both delicious. This is a great recipe.

This recipe didn't say you couldn't use cooked instant rice, so I tried that. And the recipe failed for me. I followed it with only one modification (I used about a teaspoon of vanilla instead of cinnamon), and it did not thicken up at all. I ended up using almost four cups of cooked rice, all that was in the fridge, and it STILL didn't thicken up! After 15 minutes of cooking, I gave up and left it to cool on the counter. I came back 15 minutes later and most of it seems to have absorbed into the rice! Very weird... and tasty! :) I will definitely try again with regular long grain rice, but as is this is nice sweet-milky-flavoured rice!

This is a great recipe...so quick and easy.! Both my husband and I really liked it.  I did add a couple of things: a few raisins and then after it was done cooking a teaspoon of vanilla. We will definately use this recipe again. A keeper!
I am thinking that using eggnog and nutmeg instead of evaporated milk and cinnamon might be interesting.

I made this tonight and it was not bad! I didn't have quite enough cooked basmati rice, about 1 2/3 cup. So, I left a bit of the condensed milk out.  I used Truvia baking blend (stevia) instead of sugar and I put about 2 tablespoons which is equivalent to 1/3 cup of sugar. I used just a little less than a tsp of cinnamon, as well as 1 tsp of vanilla extract. I didn't start the timer until it reached boiling. I then cooked on low covered 5 minutes, and then I stirred and cooked 2 more minutes. That was all it needed for me.
The end result? I would use the whole amount of milk next time. I would use 1 tablespoon and one teaspoon of the Truvia. I would use just a little less cinnamon and about 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla. I did enjoy it. It does thicken up quickly. So, if yours seems soupy, let it sit for 5 minutes or so, it will be much better after it sits. I think next time I may not cook the additional 2 minutes as it thickens enough after a few minutes.  I will make this again! Thanks

Easy!  I increased the amount of rice because someone said it was too sweet.  3 cups of rice and just an extra splash of milk made this perfect.  I added 1 tsp. of vanilla too and raisins.  It took longer for it to get creamy.  I just turned of the burner and let it sit after I cooked it for about 8-10 min.  The residual heat did the trick.  Kids devoured it - even the one who hates rice!  Thank you for this great idea for dessert!

After cooking it, I put it in the fridge for later on.  When I took it out to serve,  the pudding was almost hard as a rock!  The reason I gave it 3 stars instead of one is that I really liked the taste of it when I was putting it in the ramekins.  I am thinking that maybe the outcome was my fault.  I used two day old white Chinese take-out rice.  I will try this again using "fresh" leftover rice because I did like the taste.

I'm the baker in the house, but my hubby is rice pudding master. He has a recipe from his grama that takes 1/2day to make in the oven and includes a yummy custard topping- the hrs of prep and wait are TOTALLY worth it. But 10pm last night we were craving rice pudding so i jumped over here and found this. I'm not so crazy to think the results of 15min pudding can come NEAR grama M's recipe, BUT, this wasn't bad for what it is. 

I didn't read reviews before making but already knew 1TBS of cinn WAY too much. cut that in half to begin with. cinn on it's own is 1-dimentional for me, i think nutmeg would have helped expand the flavor, will try 1/4 t next time. I also knew it needed vanilla by tasting as i mixed, I used about 1TBS. I did end up using the full 1/2c sugar with the 1 can cond. milk, but added the sugar gradually and figured since we were missing custard i'd make it a lil sweeter than it need be, but could have stopped at 1/4 or 1/3c. the rice i used wasnt leftover, i microwaved 2c instant and let it stand for 10mins before adding it hot to saucepan of roomtemp milk on med-high heat and continuosly stirred. By the time it was oatmeal consistency i took it off the burner, maybe 10-12 mins on elec stovetop? i think it does need egg which would need to go in 1st before rice, will try next time. Texture of this was a bit chewy/grainy (prob my instant rice method didnt help) but for about 20 mins of work this satisfied a craving. Thanks for sharing, its a good start point

Ok I have never made rice pudding before only bought it from the grocery store or at a restaurant. We have left over rice hanging around at least once a week so I thought I would try it. The only change I made was someone else's idea to use vanilla and add nutmeg.  Also as another reviewer pointed out it needs to cook more than 7 min to thicken, mine took around 12min.  For taste it was a great after dinner dessert that I will add raisins too next time !??

This would really be good with less sugar. It was way too sweet. I tried mine with vanilla instead of cinnamon and just sprinkled it on in the end. Mine took forever to thicken. I think I put on low for 20+ minutes until I read another review that said to keep on medium continually stirring did it finally thicken.

This was FANTASTIC!  I made a few changes.... I added raisins, 1 tbsp of vanilla and one egg.... But even before doing any of that the base for this recipe is perfect!  This made 6 generous servings and was an absolutely hit!!

Enjoyed it very much!  My friend LOVES rice pudding and he says it's a 9 out of 10.  I didn't have 2 cups of rice; so I halved the recipe and it was a success!  I added raisins to my portion only and just stirred them into the pudding in the custard dish. I think if I add raisins again, I may cut back on the sugar by a bit.  I also added a touch of vanilla.  Will definitely make this again! Thank you for sharing your yummy quick & easy recipe!

This was very good and easy! I did not use a TBLS of cinnamon only 1 tsp and I did add 1 tsp vanilla at the end. No problems with the time as every stove is different, after it was boiling it was reduced to low and covered, about 5-9 minutes, stirring every couple of minutes. I used long grain rice which was a few days old in the refrigerator and it made 5 little dessert cups. This was a great way to make use of leftovers with very few ingredients. I am keeping this one! Thanks for the recipe!

Brilliant!  So easy and just yummy!  I made it sugar-free with Splenda for my diabetic boyfriend, used about 1/4 cup Splenda, plus added 1 tsp. of butter, and 1 tablespoon of sugar-free orange marmalade, plus 1 teaspoon of cinnamon -- a tablespoon is too much!  Creamy, very rich, comfort food at its finest!

It was ok, I followed the recipe except I left out the cinnamon until the end thinking it would look prettier to sprinkle it on. Well that was a mistake, maybe I'm just not to keen on evaporated milk (I don't have much experience with it) but it definitely NEEDS the cinnamon. I mixed in a good amount and then it tasted ok.

I made this recipe to use up half a can of evaporated milk I had left over, so I halved the recipe.  I like that this is quick and doesn't involve constant stirring.  However, it also doesn't taste as good as more involved recipes.  I would make this again to use up more milk or rice, but I wouldn't go out of my way to make it.

Totally yummy and easy.  I have longed long and hard for a good r.p. recipe, and this is it.  I added 1/4 sugar instead of a 1/2 cup because other reviewers thought it was too sweet, and a dash of vanilla.  Really easy and flavorful.  No more Kozy Shack from the grocery store for me.

I'm afraid I won't be making this again.  First of all it took about 15 mins. to thicken. Secondly it is just not visually appealing. If I were to make it again, I think I would add the cinnamon at the end & just sprinkle it on top.  The taste was ok--a bit too sweet for my taste.. It was more the texture that bothered me--more like gloppy, lumpy oatmeal than pudding. I think I'll shall have to keep looking for what o do with leftover rice--this was not the answer!

Amazing! Everyone loved it! Great recipe, but to reach desired consistency I kept it on low heat for almost 15 minutes. Will definitely make it again! Super easy!

Good basic rice pudding. Nothing fancy. It's pretty much rice and evaporated milk and it tastes like it. I used cloves because I'm allergic to cinnamon.

This is a good recipe.  I thought it was a little too sweet.  But that is just personal preference.  The recipe is very easy to make and quick.  I would use it again but maybe add a little less sugar.

This recipe is Awesome !!! I've fixed 2 other rice pudding recipes & this one is by far the best. I'm glad someone else had said you have to use long-grain rice, though. I did add some raisons, & had to cook it longer than it said.

The recipe was okay...It isn't like grandma's rice pudding though.
