This is a great salad! I have made this twice now for parties, and each time I've been asked for the recipe. I added just a bit of balsamic vinegar to the red wine vinegar for a stronger vinegar flavor. For a party, I prepped everything the night before, put the sugared almonds in a ziplock bag and the dressing in a jar, refrigerated the salad, and then combined everything at the last minute.

I've made this many times with whatever type of lettuce I have on hand (but never iceberg!) and it's always good. Advice on the sugared almonds: Let the sugar start carmelizing just a bit before you add the almonds. Adding the nuts too early can make them toast too brown before the sugar carmelizes. Adding the nuts too late will mean the sugar browns before the nuts get toasted. You'll have to experiment a little to get this just right, but it's worth it! I've use chopped walnuts, too. Very delicious! My guests loved it, too.

Almonds were a nice touch.  Didn't care for the dressing, though.

This recipe is very similar to one my grandma used to make.  I sometimes use a mixture of romaine and spinach.  In my dressing, I also like to use a bit of lemon or lime juice along with the vinegar to give it a bit more zing.  If I don't have any red pepper flakes, I use a dash of tabasco sauce, or some paprika and chili powder.  And I always wait until I'm ready to serve to pour the dressing on!!  Thanks for the recipe!!

Delicious and easy.  To save a step, I used the pre-packaged honey roasted slivered almonds available at most supermarkets.  My Mother usually will not eat salad w/nuts and fruit but as soon as she tasted this, she asked for the recipe!  She makes it more often than I do now.

My family and I loved this!  I didn't change a thing - loved the heat that the red pepper flakes add to the dressing. Excellent!  I'll definitely be making this one a lot.  Next time I'll try adding strawberries too. Good "company" salad :o) Many thanks!

Instead of Romaine, I filled up a large bowl w/ torn red and green leaf lettuce.  The salad was gorgeous and we loved it!  I'll be making it again for company.

The idea of this salad sounds wonderful. However the dressing was missing something - it was rather flat.  I'd like to try it again but with a slightly different dressing. I loved the sugared almonds - I will use that idea again on other salads and desserts!

I give this 4 stars for the idea! I love the madarin oranges and sugared almonds. I added about 1 T of water when cooking the almonds, and it sped-up the process tremendously. I also used a bottled raspberry-walnut vinagrette, it cut down on the ingredients and time, and still tasted awesome. I used three kinds of lettuce, red leaf, romaine, and just a tad of iceberg for extra crunch--and it was beautiful when all assembled.

Excellent blend of flavors & colors!  My husband had been asking for more meal-type salads for dinner (trying to watch the waistline).  I made this as directed and added some cubed cooked chicken for protein.  He couldn't stop raving about it!  My only recommendation to those trying this for the 1st time is don't turn your back on those almonds for a second! They burn easy!

My only thought to add would be to keep stirring those almonds in the sugar until melted don't wait until the melting begins.
Great salad.

I served this to company last night and they loved it.  My husband and I felt the salad needed salt and black pepper.  Be sure to add the dressing right before serving; otherwise, the salad will become soggy.

GREAT salad.  I've made it several times - once right by the recipe which was wonderful.  Since then I've added Ramen noodles (a good replacement for croutons) and about a tablespoon of toasted sesame oil to the dressing.  Tastes a little more oriental which I enjoy.

This is a wonderful quick and easy salad. The red wine vinager gives it an excellent, tangy taste. This salad looks great and never fails to impress.

I made this for Mother's day everyone seemed to like it, I left out the onions   and used chili powder instead of crushed pepper flakes, made the almonds and dressing the night before.  Will make again, used 2 bags of salad  spring mix and buttered lettuce.

I don't know what happened, but this did not turn out for me.  The dressing just tasted oily.  I did really like the sugared almonds though.  Those were fabulous.  I probably won't this again.  Sorry.

Very good salad.  The almonds really add to the taste - don't leave them out.  I used a bag of mixed lettuce because that is what I had.  I also left the dressing off so we could put on the amount each of us wanted.  Would definitely make again.

What a delicious salad! The oranges give it great color, and the dressing & almonds are so good. I left the onions out & served them on the side. My guests loved it! The other day I made this & added avocado, which was great too. The almonds are a cinch, but once they start to brown they can burn quickly.

The ratio of dressing to salad is perfect!  The flavors, refreshing and satisfying.  Hubby likes his plain old ranch dressing so this isn't for him but this salad simply rocks for everyone else!  Made just as the recipe called for.  Do not dress this salad early, toss it in the dressing just before serving.

I used slivered almonds, and toasted them under the broiler until they were fragrant, which gave them a ton of flavor with no added calories or sugar.  I did this while putting the salad together, then with the dressing, substituted agave nectar for the sugar.  I also added an extra tablespoon of red wine vinegar and a 1/4 cup of gluten-free soy sauce.  Great!

YUM!  I used baby butter and tango...that's what I had.  I omit the onion...don't like them and used sliced honey almonds found in the salad section.  So pretty and very yum!  Thank you for sharing!

Really great, refreshing recipe. I added a little balsamic and replaced the sugar with honey for the dressing. I also added strawberries (julienne sliced for easier munching). I didn't have almonds, but used walnuts, and added a little shredded cabbage for crunch and color. The flavors worked wonderfully, and it was almost too beautiful to eat. Incredible, refreshing and the perfect summer salad.

This salad was good, but seemed to be lacking an ingredient.  Added a handful of dried cranberries for color and texture, but it wasn't as good as some of the other salads we've tried from allrecipes, ie: Jamie's Cranberry Spinach Salad or Crunchy Lettuce.

This was very good.  But I think it's really best fresh.  I just had some leftovers for lunch and was less than impressed although last night's performance was fabulous.  Would be great with chicken added.

This was pretty good. I like the way the almonds are candied.  I've never done that before.  I gave it three stars because it was just kind of average to me.  Not bad, not superb.

A nice light salad.  Dressing needs a little more flavor, perhaps a dash of salt and some celantro and/or tabasco.

AWESOME!! This salad rocks! If you like sweet, it's for you. I added some dried cranberries to it (about 1 cup to 1.5 cups would be good). The almonds really add a nice flavor, just don't overcook them.

Thanks, Bonnie. I'm sure I'll be making this again.

Fantastic however if you are not going use the salad up at one sitting, do not pour the dressing on the whole salad.  Rather, put it on the individual servings.

This was absolutely delicious!  I used a spring mix/spinach combo, ditched the onion and added a few craisins and feta cheese.  It looked beautiful and the taste was out of this world.  Thank you!

Love, love, love this salad!  I crave it!  I usually make a big batch of the sugared almonds and keep them in an airtight container for future use.  Same with the dressing.  It's so easy to make it ahead of time and quickly assemble it when entertaining.  In a pinch, I've also substituted a few dashes of tabasco instead of crushed red pepper flakes.  It's still delish!

This is my husbands favorite salad, my grandma taught me to make it years ago. I make a few changes, I add half iceberg and half romaine for volume. A bit of fresh parsley for a freshness. I also use a bit more sugar in the dressing, and a dash of Tabasco for bite. Guests beg me for this recipe.

This is so good!  I've made it several times and every time it's a hit.  I usually make it as written, but lately I've been substituting half the vinegar for mandarin orange juice from the can.  Very tasty!

I was looking for some use for the half can of oranges leftover from dessert.  I'm glad I found this!  So, so good!  You can't eat this without going "MMMMMM" the whole time and I think my eyes were whirling around in my head like a slot machine.  It's a wonderful salad that we'll have often.  Thanks!  Also, I'm going to try it with sliced teriyaki grilled chicken.

Very easy to make and I love the sugared almonds.  Instead of romaine, I used bagged organic spring mix.  I cut the recipe in half.  Served with grilled chicken and corn on the cob.

This salad was wonderful.  The dressing was a little bit bland, so I doctored it up with about 1 tsp of chopped garlic, 1/2 tsp. salt and used 4 tablespoons of sugar instead of 2 tbls.  Everyone enjoyed it.  Will make again!

The candied almonds are the only part of the recipe I liked.  They are delicious and I will certainly make them again, but I did not find them complimentary to the oranges.

The dressing is flavorless, and the recipe makes much more than you will actually use on an average head of romaine lettuce.  It tasted so bland I was unable to even finish my serving.

We tried this recipe for dinner this evening and it was a real hit.  The sugared almonds are a wonderful compliment to the dressing.  I didn't have red leaf lettuce so I used iceberg instead.  I also added some chopped green peppers & celery which just gave the salad more crunch.  We'll have this again soon.

What a great salad!  My husband doesn't like salad, so I waited to make this for the entire family, and it was a huge it.  Both my husband and my mom (who doesn't like anything other than her desert to be sweet) loved it.

Almonds were very good but adding to the salad almost made it a little too sweet - especially with the oranges. If I made this recipe again I'd either leave them out entirely or just toast them instead. Dressing was good - sweet with a kick. Overall good recipe.

This is a good salad  but I think that I would like it better with spinach instead of Romaine.

This was just yummy all the way around. I didn't have the leaf lettuce, instead I used a prepacked salad mix. This was light yet filling. My husband who is a picky eater like it too!

Love the flavor combo but I think I will cut down on the amount of oil next time (perhaps cut it in half).  Otherwise, really good salad and well received by others.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Excellent salad and very easy!  I've made this a couple of times, exactly as is and with a few modifications.  Exactly as is is great.  Like other reviewers have said, you have to watch the almond/sugar mixture very closely.  I've made changes also by using less olive oil, by subbing out some of the olive oil with sesame oil, and by using rice vinegar in place of some of the red wine vinegar.  All of these changes worked great too.

This salad was one of the best I have ever had!!  A lot of people were saying they didn't care for the dressing, but my dinner party and I all thought it was a perfect touch, especially with the almonds.  One thing I did do was transfer the salad to another bowl, as the recipe said, after tossing the salad with the dressing.  This left some dressing in the bottom of the bowl, which I discarded.

This recipe was wonderful! I sliced up some baby carrots and added them for color and because I like the flavor. I was worried about the onions, but couldn't taste them more than any of the other flavors. Next time I'll tear the mandarin oranges in half and make less dressing. I don't like as much dressing as the recipe made, but adding more lettuce wasn't a problem. My boyfriend doesn't like vegetables but he really enjoyed this salad, so I'm keeping it. Thanks!

I am not a big salad person so for me to rate this 5 stars says something!  I was a bit skeptical about the dressing and everything & added chicken to give it more substance and it turned out great!  My husband loved it and said it was one of his favorite meals!  I will definitely be making this one again...maybe it will turn me into a salad lover :)

This is a great recipe to go with almost any meal! The light flavor didn't clash with anything else I was making. I liked the dressing a lot, and the green onions gave it a great flavor. I loved the sugared almonds but also made croutons. My family liked both flavors. Thanks!

This salad was excellent, I did add fresh strawberries and used a Raspberry Vinaigrette dressing, I did not have sliced almonds so I used Pecans with the sugar coating.  I had friends over for dinner and they loved it, I will definately be making again.

I tried this recipe tonight and it was delicious. We are trying to lower the amount of sugars in our diet, so toasted the almonds without adding sugar. And instead of sugar, I added salt and pepper to the dressing. My husband and I both loved it! Thank you for giving us a fresh salad idea.

A wonderfully fresh salad. I didn't use the dressing that was listed and used a garlic raspberry vinaigrette and it was just as delicious. I added some fresh peas and radishes for some extra color and texture. This is a wonderful salad base and you can mix and match different toppings to your liking.

Thsi salad was fabulous! I did make the sugared almonds (which added so much to the salad) but, because of previous reviews, I did not make the dressing. instead I used some bottled raspberry vinaigrette as others did. Don't skimp on the green onions! I served this w/ a pork stir fry & it complemented it very well.

This was good but not blowing my socks off. I think I would pair this with a different dressing that has more zing to it. The sugared almonds were the best part. Probably will make again but with another dressing.

This is a great salad.  I added more sugar to the dressing. The dressing was lacking something so I sweetened it up a little.  I have also made this weight watchers friendly.  I used a fat free sweet and sour dressing instead of the high fat dressing and I used the Go Lean Crunch cereal instead of the sugared almonds.  You can only eat this salad the day you make it since the next day it gets soggy.

This is like having dessert at the beginning of a meal!  While the dressing and basic salad are tasty, the sugared almonds are the star IMO.  Takes a little more effort that your average salad, but it's well worth it.  I added some salt and cayenne pepper to the sugar, and it works out very nicely for anyone who likes a little extra kick.

This salad was fantastic!  The only thing I did differently was to use field greens.  It made for a visually appetizing salad...to match the outstanding flavor.  I'll never make a plain tossed salad again!

Delicious salad.  I'm going to try cutting up my own oranges next time.  The canned mandarin oranges didn't have enough flavor for my taste.  Served this recipe with grilled hamburgers and the Red Skinned Potato Salad.  Everyone raved over the meal.

This is a very nice salad.  It tastes great, lots of flavors that work well together.  It requires a lot of ingredients that I don't usually have on-hand.

I brought this salad to Easter dinner. My mother grandmother who are wonderful cooks loved the salad. My sister, who is always honest, told me she loved it and wouldn't change a thing. I, on the other hand, thought the dressing need a little something. Maybe the olive oil gave it a little bitterness? I had leftovers and added raspberry vinagrette to the dressing and I enjoyed the salad a lot better! I would make it again. The almonds made the salad.

After reading all of the reviews, I expected much more from this recipe.  It was easy to prepare (most salads are) and it was good, but nothing to write home about.

I used Raspberry vinagrette instead and hot pepper flakes, it was great!! The sugared almonds added the perfect crunch. Will make this a regular.

I had a salad like this at a friend's party a year ago and was excited to find this. Unfortunately, it wasn't quite as good as hers. The dressing came out way too oily for my taste and tended to coat the leaves. Not sure if I did something wrong. Still a great recipe, though -- I just have to play with the dressing! The almonds are fantastic!!

Very very good salad.  I would recommend having this with any meal.  I will never make a plain salad again.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  It's the same as what we use to get in a restaurant that has since closed.

Very good recipe.  There was too much dressing so I added a second head of lettuce and cut back the olive oil to 3/4 of what the recipe called for.  The almonds were such a delightful surprise!

I gave it a 2 stars, hubby gave a 4.  It was ok, but didn't like the oil & red wine vinegar dressing.  We'll make it again but use some other type of dressing I think.

Just a suggestion for an alternative to the salad dressing - my mom's been making this for years and she simply uses an italian dressing - great tang with the sweet from the mandarin oranges and sweet almonds.

Had to do a little changing as I was out of mandarin oranges. since we have an orange tree I was able to pick an orange for the salad. Dressing looked like it was too much for the one head of romaine. used only about a 1/4 cup to a 1/2 cup for the whole salad. Very good flavors. Looking forward to seeing how the left overs will be.

Hmm.  Nice concept, but as others have mentioned, the dressing really needs some work.  I made the dressing as stated in the recipe, except I used only 1/4 cup of olive oil.  I could hardly taste anything, so I took out my list of things that other reviewers have recommended, adding one at a time and then tasting -- About a tsp. of Dijon, followed by 2 T. of juice from the oranges and then finally a tablespoon of balsamic vinegar.  Better, but definitely nothing to write home about and still lacking that certain something.  Again, I like the concept of this and it could be a really nice side salad.  (We had it with Peanut Butter Noodles with some chicken from this site.)  Also, we just toasted the almonds and skipped sugaring them and I'm glad we did it that way.  I will try again and work on the dressing a little bit more.

Used conbination of romaine and butter lettuce and reduced the onion a bit.  Everything else I left alone.  Excellent, thanks so much!

Sorry, but the way it is this recipe deserves only 3 stars. The salad was good, but the dressing was very, very bland. I added some Dijon and it turned much better.

Very good- the sugared almonds really make this. Because some of the other reviewers commented on the dressing, I added a little extra sugar and a tablespoon of orange juice concentrate (I had already drained the mandarin oranges). Overall, the dressing still wasn't my favorite but it turned out pretty well!

This is a very easy, tasty salad. I loved the mixture of flavors. The dressing could use a little work; I found it to be somewhat bland and not all that exciting. All in all, it is a yummy salad; I will probably make it again with a different dressing. Thanks for sharing!

Excellent recipe for taking to holiday parties or to share with friends.  Our friend is diabetic so I just toasted the almonds - no sugar, and they were great.  Also had no red wine vinegar so used balsamic instead.  Got rave reviews.  Definitely will make this again.

I hate to give a bad review, but myself and my dinner guests did not like this salad at all. It was very bland. I have been described as a picky eater (I don't think so - lol), so I could be biased, but my bf and my guests are not picky in the least bit! Sorry, not for us. I like the idea, so I think it's worth searching for a more suitable version. Thanks anyways!

The almonds were a pain to candy, but they were delicious. However, the dressing ruined this salad - it was overly sharp.

This was pretty good.  The dressing wasn't quite to my taste though.  I'll probably make it again, just use a prebought dressing though.

Fabulous -- followed the recipe exactly, and it was a tremendous hit! For added flavour, I use the "PC Organics Italian Salad Mix" (from Loblaws) instead of plain Romaine. Make sure you make extra sugared almonds for munching!

This salad was the best! It has been put in my recipe box because I will be using it a lot in the future. Everyone loved it! The almonds were to die for and the dressing was so yummy. I added strawberries and some grated cheddar since I had them. Fun recipe to experiment with and make your own. Thanks so much for sharing it.

This was fantastic. The almonds are definitely worth the trouble of coating with the sugar. I added fresh strawberries like the picture. Everyone in the family loved the salad and gave it 5 stars. A real keeper.

I liked this salad, except that I have a digestive problem with fresh onion--and this disagreed with me.  The dressing was wonderful, and I really liked the addition of the sugared almonds.  I will make it again, but touch it up with onion salt instead of raw onion.

YUM!  I added fresh sliced strawberries to the salad, as the photo shows, and it was really a great addition, combining well with the dressing and sugared almonds.  And we LOVED the sugared sliced almonds.  I also cut the olive oil in half and just did equal parts red wine vinegar and olive oil.  I made half the amount of salad since there were just two of us, but the full amount of dressing and that was about right.  I would make this again; very refreshing on a warm summer evening.  Thank you!

This is a fabulouse recipe!  I've used it as is, and also as a base for different combination salads.  Add some bacon bits, crumbled bleu cheese & toss with Raspberry vinagrette for nice change of pace.  Grilled chicken and sliced red onions make it great light meal. Let your imagination run...you can't really go wrong with this great base salad!

Very good salad.  I served it for a dinner with friends and it was well received.  I thought the vinegar taste in the dressing was a little strong.  I will probably use a pre-made rasberry vinaigrette the next time.

DELISH!! I made this for a Mother's Day Brunch and everyone loved it. My mom even asked for the recipe. Very easy to make. I left out the green onions and it was still a big hit. I put the leftover salad and dressing in a container and took it to work the next day... still wonderful!  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

Very good salad.  Took this to a get together and everyone ate this up and people "split" the leftovers so I brought home an empty bowl!

Great recipe!  Quick, easy to make, tasty & crunchy.  Would use just a little less oil next time.  For a variation I might add tortila strips for more crunch or some diced red pepper for flavor.  Probably would go nicely with some gilled chicken on top. On the downside, I thought the number of portions were less than expected. Maybe I should have used a little extra lettuce or my portions were too big.

After melting two  plastic spoons, I finally figured out to use a wooden spoon when melting sugar and almonds.  A wonderful hit this summer and a great addition to our dinner table. I have already given the recipe to many others.
Thank you!

This recipe was wonderful.  I did not use as much red wine vinger as it calls for but it turned out great.  My boyfriend added some teryaki sauce to the dressing and it was great.  Overall, a great salad.  If you can afford it, try arugula instead of the romaine lettuce.

The only bachelor left in my family, I was politely asked to bring a salad for our Mother's Day lunch. I found this little jewel on the all-recipes site, and wowed the fam with my culinary skills. But hey, I won't tell them how easy it was if you won't!

I really liked the salad, especially the almonds,  although my husband thought the green onions were overpowering.  Next time I'll use half the perscribed amount.

This was a terrific salad.  I used to get this at a restaurant and have been looking for a recipe like this for long time.  Kids found it a little weird with nuts and oranges but it was a hit with the adults.

What a fantastic dish!  The entire family really enjoyed this recipe.   There were requests for seconds!  I believe you should follow the recipe exactly the first time that you make the dish.  Thereafter, you can make you changes.  Don’t forget once you make changes you are no longer making the dish that you selected.  Instead you are making your version.  I cannot wait to make this dish again for the family.

This salad was really good. I read the recipe and reviews and it sounded good. I added an avocado that I had on hand. I also added a splash of balsamic vinegar to the dressing. It turned out great. Loved it!

No changes and tastes like not much of anything. A bit of citrus from the madarins. A bit of a bite from red pepper flakes.  Wouldn't make again.

My "go to" salad.  Everyone loves it!  Have used blueberries, apples and strawberries and all were great.  Even picky teens will eat it.
