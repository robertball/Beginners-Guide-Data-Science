This soup is delicious!  I used about 30 ounces of homemade turkey broth and I was glad I did, we like a "brothier" soup and 24 ounces would not have been enough.  I followed the rest of the recipe as written.  Served with rolls and it was gobbled up by everyone.  
*side note: I could only find a 15 oz. bottle of the Classico Light Creamy Alfredo pasta sauce.  It tasted just fine using all of it.

Sooo simple, Yet sooo Savory!  This dish took about 20 minutes, yet tastes like I spend hours on it!  I tried it on my family and even the kids loved it!  I substituted sausage stuffed tortellini and used pablano alfredo which gave it just a hint of heat!  ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!  Will definitely be serving this to company this fall!  : )

This was delightful, both in ease and taste. I was skeptical about not adding any extra seasoning, but I'm glad I trusted the recipe and other reviewers. It doesn't need anything additional. Because I added an entire package of 20oz tortellini, I added an extra can of alfredo and about a half cup of water (I would probably have added another can of broth instead of the water, but I ran out--the water did the trick though).

Other than that, the only changes I made were using Classico's Asiago Romano Alfredo (Light) rather than the original, and using chicken sausage in place of the shredded chicken. I was being extra lazy and just used a fork to drain the sun dried tomatoes, so I think I got some added oil in the mixture. It gave it a nice color and an extra bit of flavor.

It's super quick and with the added sauces and tortellini, I had enough to can some leftovers to freeze for future meals. I will absolutely make this again, especially for guests! I'm certain it'll impress.

My daughter made this for us for supper tonight.  When she told me it had three cans of broth with Alfredo Sauce, I thought... ewwww... But it was AWESOME!!!  The only thing we didn't have was the tomatoes.  I can imagine the addition of lots of other ingredients too, but it was perfect as it was!

This recipe was flavorful and very easy to make.  I will absolutely make this again but double the batch so I have leftovers.  Nothing needs to be added.  The recipe is perfect as is.

Very Good!  I had a 20 oz pack of chicken tortellini that I used.  So, I left out the chicken.  And, I used a can of diced tomatoes with garlic, basil, and oregano for flavor.  It made a huge pot of soup, great for leftovers.

Very good exactly as is!  Mine came out quite a bit thicker though which is a plus in my book.

Great restaurant worthy soup!  As a personal preference, I used Swanson Vegetable broth instead of chicken broth and did not add tomato.  I made the broth base ahead of time and put it in the refrigerator.  Right before serving, I cooked the tortellini added it to the reheated soup base along with the spinach. Delicious and Easy!

This soup is so simple and yummy. It’s the perfect after work dinner. To simplify things I? add the entire jar of Alfredo sauce and an entire Swanson’s broth container (32 ounces). Also I? throw in the entire spinach bag to have more spinach in it since it wilts down so much. This soup is on regular rotation.

This was an amazingly delicious and easy soup!  I didn't have spinach, so I used frozen broccoli cuts, and pretty much just wagged the ingredients and it was unbelievably delicious- as is!  This is going to be my go-to soup since the ingredients are easy to keep on hand. Thanks for sharing!

Left out the chicken, but otherwise made no changes.  The recipe was incredibly easy and fast.  A big hit with everyone!  Might use a little extra broth next time, as it wasn't a very soupy "soup", but otherwise it was perfect.

Delicious! I've made it per recipe and I've also subbed in hot italian sausage for the chicken and roasted red bell peppers and canned Italian tomatoes when I didn't have the original ingredients. It is so tasty and versatile. Definitely a keeper. Everyone in my family of 5 devoured it. Never any leftovers.

I make this soup all the time for a family I cook for.  They absolutely love it and so do I.  As a cook, I love the ease of this recipe and the convenience of using prepared food.  However, I usually start with cut up boneless, skinless chicken thighs.  It gives a richer flavor.

Very tasty! And very easy! I doubled the tortellini and the alfredo sauce. I also added mushroom and used sausage instead of chicken. My entire family loved it. I strained the 'soup' part out for my little one and she gobbled it up. Definitely making this again!

Quick, easy and yummy.  Made it vegetarian by using vegetable broth and not adding chicken.  So good.
