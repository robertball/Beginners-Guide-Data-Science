I'm really not a breakfast eater so found the idea of "instant breakfast mix" interesting. (anything "instant" in the am is wonderful). Never would of thought of heating breakfast mix up. I left out the frozen yogurt and made the HOT VERSION, with vanilla flavored breakfast mix. Yummy! Next time i'll try chocolate mix.
