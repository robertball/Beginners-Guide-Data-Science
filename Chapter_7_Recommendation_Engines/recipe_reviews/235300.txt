My husband loves pumpkin pie and I love cheesecake.  Together the best of 2 worlds.  I did make a graham cracker crust which I prefer.

Really taste and easy recipe. Was a huge hit with my colleagues. Just a couple of key items:

1) I don't know if this assumed to be obvious, but the dough intructions don't say anything about the water needed. I added just enough cold water to have a workable, non-sticky dough. Also, I chopped the butter for a better, flaky crust.

2.) The cream cheese mixture didn't quite hold while I added the pumpkin layer. It became more marbled than anything. Still tasted great, but perhaps handmixing cheese mix would prevent it from getting so soft.

I used a gingersnap cookie crust instead, which really made this recipe a hit. I also followed the suggestions from others to reduce the sugar a bit and it turned out just right. Will be making this again!

I used 1/2 cup of sugar, 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and substituted nutmeg for the cloves for the pumpkin layer otherwise followed the recipe as written. Had a little taste test. Wow, they were so good. I have covered and refrigerated them. Can't wait to try them tomorrow after a night of chilling!

Although the pumpkin had good enough flavor, it was mostly just like a pumpkin custard mix.  The cream cheese mixture made this somewhat like cheesecake, but I think since it wasn't combined it lacked the true taste of cheesecake ... pumpkin or no.
     Now, I used a smaller pan, which may have something to do with this, but the top got a little burnt around the edges, and the crust was a bit thick and dry.  I'm sad to say I would not make again ... although it tasted good enough, it wasn't pumpkin cheesecake, and I can make pie/custard any day.  A note, though; it was much better after sitting in the fridge overnight like the chief said, and tasted more like cheesecake, although the crust was still too thick.

Really good, not great. I thought there was too much crust, my S.O. thinks it was perfect. The cheesecake part seems to get lost to the overpowering pumpkin. Next time I will double the cheesecake layer and see how it is. Maybe even swirl them a little for a prettier effect. Otherwise nommy, easy to whip up, and I will likely make them again. A great recipe if you need to make something ahead of time as they do taste much better after being cooled in the fridge for a day.

These are amazing and sooo delicious.  Only change I made was to double the cheesecake layer .  My family raved over them.  Definitely put in fridge overnight, taste great after being chilled.  I will be making these again for the holidays.

Made it for a pot luck event for our combined service with our Anglican church and our United Church neighbours and it was a big hit.  I will make it again.  Didn't change a thing.

These were delicious! I made them for a work potluck and everyone loved them! For the crust, the only small changes I made were to add 1/2 cup chopped pecans and as another reviewer had to do, a small amount (maybe 1/4 cup?) of cold water to get the dough to the right consistency.  I also added 1/4 tsp. nutmeg to the pumpkin layer. Make sure you use non stick (Pam or similar) on the bottom and sides of the pan, as I did and the bars were still somewhat hard to get out. Very good recipe, I will make again!

First time making this and it's tastes great! However, the ingredients for the pumpkin mixture was double than I needed for this pie. So I'm not sure if I did something wrong or if it's supposed be like that. But it tasted great!

This is my new favorite fall dessert. Perfect mixture of pumpkin and cheesecake. I plan to make it for Thanksgiving this year. I did add nutmeg as well, since I love to put nutmeg on everything, but that was my only change.

You can’t taste the cheesecake layer. That part of the recipe needs to be doubled.  The recipe tastes like pumpkin pie.

As written, it was just ok. As in - I had one piece, and one piece only.  The cheesecake layer was paper thin, and the pumpkin layer wasn't sweet enough. I might try making it again, but I would double the cheesecake as other reviewers suggested, and I would add more sugar to the pumpkin.

I made this recipe for a family gathering, and guess what ! was  a hit. First I reduced milk to 240ml, and baked the cheese layer for 5 minutes to make sure that it won’t mix with pumpkin,which I mix with walnuts,  and I succeeded

This was an easy recipe which makes me smile....I did add a bit more spice to the pumpkin layer only because of the reviews that said that layer was more like pumpkin pie...It was delicious.

I agree with one review I think I would add either an extra cheesecake layer on top or double the cheesecake layer on the bottom....Next time we will see..

I accidentally baked the crust at 350 degrees and it turned out perfect.  I'm glad I did and will change the recipe to reflect that.
These bars were excellent and is definitely going to be a permanent addition to my collection.

I doubled the cheesecake layer - because who doesn’t want more cheesecake?!?  These were great and seemed to get better every day.  The neighbor ladies awarded them two big thumbs up - I’ll be making them again for Thanksgiving.

I doubled the cheesecake portion as suggested. Next time, I will just blend the cheesecake and pumpkin fillings together from the start, since they get mixed together anyway.

The word "layer" in the directions made me hopeful they'd be visible (although, the photos didn't show that). Next time, I'll bake the cream cheese layer a few minutes before adding the pumpkin to see if that works. Overall, tasty and a hit with the co-workers.

Made this tonight as a precursor to the holidays! it's good, but I think I'll use brown sugar in the crust and more butter next time. it was too dry. I'll also use a bit more spice in the pumpkin... I love those spices, and it will add some pizzazz! I do love cream cheese with pumpkin, and this is a delicious way to combine them.

These are amazing!! I will absolutely be making these again and again! I made a few small changes. I used whole wheat flour instead of all- purpose. For the crust I added only 3 Tbsp sugar. For the cream cheese layer I used 3 Tbsp sugar and 1 tsp vanilla. For the pumpkin layer I used a 1/2 cup sugar, 1 1/4 tsp cinnamon, and 1/8 tsp cloves. The bars are disappearing quickly and I've had many requests for the recipe! They're wonderful!! Thank you so much for sharing the recipe!!

The instructions were incomplete.  The cream cheese HAS to be softened.  The crust dough should be just leveled out in the pan not pressed. Wasted all of those ingredients!  Bummer!

I made a pecan crust - absolutely scrumptious.  I made it in a spring form pan & cooked for 60 minutes.  The  pumpkin part didn't want to set.  Probably needed a higher temp first & then reduce to 325-350.  See pumpkin pie recipe next time.

I added a little pinch of pumpkin pie spice to the crust and the cheesecake mixture, Followed others by adding a little bit of chopped up pecans to the crust-  this definitely is very good it’s better than pie, feeds more people than pie so this is going to be my new go to for larger holiday gatherings

I tried it with graham cracker crust.  I don’t believe I’ve ever baked anything at 425 for 60 mins and sure enuf, my sides kinda burned.  This was kinda “meh” to me.  I bet there are better, similar recipes out there. Sorry.

Very good.  I was just a little disappointed that it didn't have more of the cheesecake layer.
I will make it again though and might try bumping up the the cheesecake layer.

Easy to make and delicious!  After refrigerating overnight, it was easy to cut this pumpkin cheesecake into bars and remove them from the baking dish with no sticking or breakage. I agree with another reviewer that a graham cracker crust would be tastier.

Easy recipe.  The Pumpkin mixture was a bit too soupy which required a little extra baking time.  And it’s difficult to pour the Pumpkin mixture on top of the cream cheese mixture to maintain a layered effect.  Overall very tasty and a pleasant twist to the average Thanksgiving dessert lineup.

So I tried this recipe and everyone I gave some to really liked it. The only thing I had a hard time taking it out of pan to cut individual pieces. I should have sprayed the glass dish. Otherwise it was a great recipe and I will definitely make again. My friends are waiting for more. :)

These are just ok.  Changes needed to make them better.  Use a smaller pan to make for a more substantial bar.  Chill the cream cheese layer first before adding the pumpkin or just go ahead and mix it all together, unless marbled is what you are going for.

The pumpkin cheesecake bars are okay the cream cheese layer and pumpkin layer did blend together though. Not sweet and very light. The instructions were not very clear though and we had a bit of a hard time making these. I am not sure if it was my fault that the layers blended together, but it is okay. Just made these today and are planning to chill in the fridge overnight.

Nice and easy and quite good. I especially like that this recipe doesn't use too much sugar. My family actually liked the bottom crust, unlike some other reviewers. The spices in the pumpkin part can easily be adjusted to taste and availability. One caution I have to mention is, that when you pour the pumpkin mixture over the cheese part, to pour it very slowly, or it will co-mingle. Which is not terrible, but you won't have the layers separated at those parts. All in all an easy recipe and my family approved.

made it for the first time today and it's not too bad! my husband loves it! I did reduce the sugar thinking it might not need so much so much but my husband said it could be a but sweeter.

I was really surprised though at the balanced ratio of the pumpkin to cheesecake part. I might need to double the cheesecake part next time. 

also I am not Adam of the crust. I added a little bit of pecan crumbs to add some crunch but I'm still not liking it. I think I'm going to do my usual Graham cracker crust next time. 

otherwise, this is great!!

This recipe came out fabulous and that's that I accidentally mixed ALL the ingredients together that make the filling along with the cream chees mixture.  The only thing I added was a bit of ganache drizzled over the top of the bars after being refrigerated overnight. Everyone LOVED them and I'll be making them again for Turkey Day!

Very good taste. Crust was very hard and stuck to the bottom of of the dish. Might have worked the dough too hard. Next time I'll grease the bottom of the dish and possibly use a graham cracker crust as others have noted. Still good and worth making.

I added a half cup of rolled oats to the crust and reduced the flour by a half cup, also used brown sugar. I also reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup as others suggested. The picture is misleading, made these in a 13x9 pan and they are super thin, wondering if the picture was in an 8x8 pan?  They taste good, but the crust also stuck to the pan, use a nonstick spray first.  I probably will not make this recipe again.

I opted to use a store bought shortbread pie crust.  I brushed it with a little egg wash and baked it for 5 minutes in the oven.
I used about 10 oz. of cream cheese since other reviewers said 8 oz. was not enough.  I also cut sugar by half for both layers.
There was so much pumpkin mixture left over I used the other part of my 6 oz cream cheese left mixed with a bit of other ingredients (vanilla, sugar and egg)  and layered into giant muffin cups.  Made 6 cupcakes.  
Cooled it for several hours and decided it was a great hit.
Very yummy.

It is pretty good. My husband liked it. Would I make it again? I don't think so.
