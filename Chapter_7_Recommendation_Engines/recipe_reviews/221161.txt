I'm always looking for low calorie, yummy and easy ways to prepare chicken and this recipe hit the mark on all three. I didn't have cornstarch so I used flour. I served the chicken with cous cous and broccoli. The sauce was so good I went back for seconds and poured it over the cous cous. I recommend trying this recipe.

This was easy enough that I even had my husband help me make it. I wasn't paying attention to what he was doing and ended up juicing 3 big lemons instead of 2. It turned out great anyway. My picky 7 year old had seconds and my 11 year old decided that it was also good to eat for breakfast the next morning. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I thought this was really good but the rest of the family was so-so about it, I added the zest of a lemon but otherwise kept the recipe intact. I served with white rice & veggies, maybe I'll try it again but add herbs to it, rosemary or something...

I really liked this but my SO said the sauce was too sweet. I served mine with mashed potatoes (and that may have been the problem). He said it would probably be better with rice or something else for a more Asian fare.

Rated it 4 stars because it was super simple (as the name implies) and I used ingredients I already had in the house-- no running to the store to pick-up that one thing I forgot!!

This is how I'm going to make Lemon Chicken from now on! The sauce is so good! I did marinate the chicken with orange juice beforehand though. This was also very simple to make.

This wasn't as lemony as I expected - I'll add more lemon juice next time.  But even the picky four year old ate it!
