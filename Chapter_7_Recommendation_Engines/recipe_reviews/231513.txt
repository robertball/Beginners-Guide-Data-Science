I got 48 cookies out of this, as the recipe said.  They spread pretty well and cooked in about 10 minutes.

Just made these cookies and is a keeper!!!  Didn't have shortening so used magerine,I always double vanilla, and added cinnamon.  The texture is perfect, spread is perfect, cookies are perfect.  Thank you!

Overall good recipe - I would describe these as a plain oat-oatmeal cookie, no raisins, cinnamon, molasses. It was nice for a change and they baked up well, turning golden within the 8-10 minute baking time. I ended up adding some milk chocolate chips to the batter. My family enjoyed these cookies.

I had a day off from work and came across this recipe. It's pretty awesome easy to do and very quick! It makes a ton of cookies as well. I'm just afraid that I won't have any left for my boyfriend when he gets home from work asking "what did you do today?"... OH I just ate cookies! LOL! Love this recipe!

This is a wonderful recipe.   Reading the reviews I decided to add a teaspoon of cinnamon and  2 eggs instead of one.  I also added 1/2 cup raisins .  I used whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup butter instead of all the shortening.  I think I will use coconut oil the next time.  Delicious!

perfectly chewy!
I changed it up a bit by adding cranberries instead of raisins and used rolled oats instead of quick oats. They give better consistency.......basically.......loved it!!!!

Very good.  A good combination of soft and chewy an crispy.  When I tasted the batter it was a bit salty, so next time I might add just a touch less salt, or mix it longer.  I also used butter because I didn't have shortening.  Overall, pretty good.

Very good chewy cookie with crispy edges. I was out of vanilla extract, so I substituted almond extract. In place of the shortening, I used 1/4C butter and 3/4C of coconut oil. I also added about a cup  of raisins after mixing. This will be my go to base recipe for oatmeal raisin or OM chocolate chip cookies.

I was very disappointed with this recipes, very little flavour.  Luckily I baked a test cookie.  I added butter, an extra egg and some cinnamon. I also did not find them to be very chewy.

The cookies were so moist, cooked with a very slight crispy edge, the rest of the cookies was soft and a little chewy...great!   I was afraid it would be dry. Great recipe for your kids that don't care for raisins, as I do, or one that doesn't care for cinnamon, again as I do. LOL  Perfect!!! 
Also this is the quickest and easiest cookie recipe I have ever made.

I have just made these cookies.  I used baking powder instead of baking soda.  I prefer puffy cookies.  But love the recipe.  I was able to get 60 cookies out of this recipe.  I also used a tsp measure for the size of cookies.  I love the cookies just the way they are.  Thank you :)

THis is your sure thing for oatmeal cookies that are chewy,moist and crunchy on the edges. added craisins and walnuts to half the recipe and chocolate chips to the other half. use half butter and 1/2 smart balance instead of shortening.also used my bullet to process 1/2 the oatmeal into flour consistency. turned out perfect!

I want to make this recipe so bad, but don't have Baking Soda. I don't use this product much, so I don't buy it, and was wondering if I can substitute it with something else, like baking powder, or just not add it? I love this website so much, you all have great recipes, and I use a lot of them. Thanks for your response in advance.
