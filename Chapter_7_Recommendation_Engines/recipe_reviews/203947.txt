I steeped the mixture for 1 hour. It was the perfect amount of lemongrass flavor in the ice cream. I love how creamy the ice cream turned out. I will definitely make this again!

Found that the taste of the condensed milk was too pervasive for my tastes.

Nice texture and great flavor although I only used 2 stalks of lemongrass instead of 3 in recipe (that's all I had). I was also short with my condensed milk (it comes in 300ml can and 1 1/2 cups is 355ml) and added a little more cream to balance it out. Thanks for sharing

This turned out amazing. Followed the ingredient list exactly. I don t have an ice cream maker so I put in the freezer overnight and it was perfect.
