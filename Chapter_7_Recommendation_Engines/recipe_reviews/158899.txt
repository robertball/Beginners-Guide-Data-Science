This was my first attempt at homemade marinara. I used a 10oz. can crushed tomatoes and 1 can rotel, I pureed the rotel. I did tweak the seasonings a bit! My bf thought it was too runny so I will add tomato paste next time.

I'm giving this five stars although at first I thought that it was too spicy. I scaled the recipe to accommodate a huge can of crushed tomatoes that I needed to use up (hence my search for a tomato sauce recipe). Although I doubled the recipe and still added extra tomatoes (64 ounces instead of a mere 56) it had a lot of bite. Yet, I can't stop eating it, and my husband, who doesn't crave spicy foods, likes it too, and says it is not too spicy.  This is a good sauce in which to add those things that you want to get rid of. I added a rind from a wedge of romano cheese, and let it simmer quite a while. And, as good as it is, I had some heavy cream that needed to be used up, so I added 7 ounces of heavy cream to a double recipe of this sauce. Very good, and I imagine it will be even better with pasta!

Wow, great basic recipe, loved this!  I make hot italian sausages in the slow cooker, usually just dump a jar of prepared sauce for a quick fix, but was out of sauce.  I did have a can of crushed tomatoes, and found this recipe.  So glad I did.  I did do some doctoring, in addition to the recipe ingredients I added some fine chopped carrot, about 1/2 cup red wine, and a packet of beef boulion in place of salt.  I also added some sugar, about two tablespoons, to cut the acidity and sweeten a bit.  Delicious.  Good-bye jarred sauce!

Good as far as it goes. If you can get away with it, use tomato sauce and simmer it longer, the longer the better, adding water if you need to. As others have said, a bit of tomato paste will thicken the sauce, but make it even more acidic and bitter. So . . .

Add a pinch of baking soda. IMO, sugar is not a good idea because it doesn't solve the acidity. It only masks it (and does so badly). Instead, do what my sainted grandmother used to do. Add a pinch of baking soda just as the sauce begins to simmer and stir the foam back in. Bases counteract acids. Cook awhile and add a little more baking soda if necessary. (Taste first.) That step will allow the natural sweetness of the tomato to assert itself. Don't overdo the baking soda, though. It will make the sauce unacceptably salty. Oh, and leave out the salt if you use bs.

This sauce is fabulous! I did make a few of my own tweaks to it after making it a few times. I have kids & they, especially my youngest, don't like the hotness. So I omit the crushed red pepper flakes & for those of us that do like it spicy we sprinkle it on top of our separate dishes. I also added meat, sausage & meatballs. I brown the sausage first before letting them cook in the sauce. Because I triple the recipe I actually have to bake my meatballs in the oven due to not having a big enough pot. Because I added meat the sauce came out a tad watery so the next time I drained the juice from the diced tomatoes & that seemed to help. Overall an excellent sauce, great for my entire family. It has become a staple in our household & every I make homemade sauce this is the recipe. It also cooks well in the crockpot.

Mmm.. this was so good I was eating it plain, there was barely enough sauce left to cover my stuffed shells!  I added a little bit of half and half (or heaving whipping cream) because that's how I like my sauces but it was still good without it.  Super easy, too.

Some of the spices need to change:  only 2 cloves of garlic, no italian seasoning, add: 1 TBSP dried Oregano, 2 TBSP dried BASIL, 2 Tsp. grated NUTMEG, 2 Tsp. Salt and 2 TBSP sugar.

If you make these changes, it will be a 5-star recipe!

é miracoloso! This is so close to my own tomato sauce that I can confidently give it 5 stars, with the warning that as written, it's not a thick sauce. Cook it down or add a small can of tomato paste to thicken it. Mine has minor tweaks, a bit more of this, a little less of that. It is my go-to Italian sauce, and the base for so many foods. From shells to spaghetti to lasagne, this is it. Adding ground beef & sausage makes a lovely meat sauce. It is wonderful on pizza. Add cream for a tomato cream sauce, or make that cream sauce alla Vodka. Seriously, you'll never buy jarred sauce again, not when homemade is so much better and so easy.

Came home from work tonight in a rush what to make for dinner and came across this recipe in my recipe box.  Since I had all the ingredients I thought why not give it a try. My daughter is not a fan of spicy foods so I cut the crushed red pepper in half.  I used my "Italian seasoning mix 1" from this site.  This turned out quick and had a good flavor.  I did let it simmer longer than specified which may have helped to tone down the canned taste from the tomatoes.  Will be making this one again for sure.

This sauce was quick, easy and tasty, but I'm rating it four rather than five stars because it was too spicy for me. I suggest reducing the amount of red pepper specified in the recipe. I also added olives to my sauce, and thought that grated cheese would be a great addition as well.

A good way to cut acidity, and somewhat thicken your sauce at the same time, is to add a spoon-tip of baking soda.

Seriously good. I am a bachelor and usually the time it takes to make a really good sauce is not something I have. I added a 6oz can of tomato paste because I like a thicker sauce. Since, I like a hotter sauce as well I added a bit more peppers. This was perfect for me and beats anything that comes out of a jar. It is 5-star worthy but seemed to be missing something. Overall a great sauce.

I make a very similar sauce that I keep on hand in the freezer all the time. The only difference is, I use fresh basil in place of the Italian seasoning, add a tablespoon of tomato paste, and always San Marzano tomatoes. I also sauté the red pepper flakes along with the onion and garlic.  I have a freezer full of fresh basil chopped and mixed with EVOO and that is what I add at the end.  I always only cook it till everything is combined and piping hot, but I never let it get so hot it comes to a boil---we love the fresher taste.  I will try some in a crockpot one day, though. I'm sure it will give a completely different, long-cooked flavor! We LOVE this sauce on any kind of pasta dish, with cheese sticks, on sandwiches, eggplant or chicken Parmigiana, etc.  Can't go wrong with this one---thanks for posting!

The recipe was under cooked.  You have to simmer the sauce until the oil turns red. This will tell you when the sauce is done....about 20 minutes should do it. If the sauce dries out with the extra cooking just add some water.

I use fresh tomatoes, and add a little tomato paste to thicken, and simmer for a few hours, it is super good. I found using my crock-pot made it too runny. I make in big batches, when tomatoes are cheap and freeze it. My goal this year was to learn to make all my sauces from scratch and I've now added this one to the list.

I like to add chopped celery and carrot as well as ground sausage. Cook the sausage first then throw in the veggies and follow as usual. I also simmer for much longer (usually about an hour) and the sauce thickens up beautifully, a bit of tomato paste also helps.

Used San Marzano plum tomatoes. Simmered quite a bit longer, while crushing tomatoes with a potato masher (some red wine while simmering is good for both the cook and the gravy). Added some diced red peppers to the onions & garlic. Browned gound beef and ground pork added make a good meat sauce. Top with fresh chopped basil when serving.

Surprised to see my go to recipe here that I have been making for years. I use the highest quality crushed tomatoes with added purée that is available, and half the red pepper. A little fresh parsley, a bay leaf and Lowrey's season salt in place of regular salt added is also good. To curb the acidity, try adding 1/8 tsp. baking soda at end of cooking, or a carrot to add a little sweetness.

Great starter recipe! I also use green and yellow peppers for both flavor and color. For the acidic taste I use Basil, not sugar.I do use double the amounts and keep portions in freezer.

I liked this recipe and, more to the point, my family did, too.  It's a good basic recipe that can be a springboard for more experimentation. Even in its most basic form, I think it needed some added sugar to cut the acidity of the tomatoes.  I used this sauce for my eggplant parmigiana and it was delicious. Also, because I prefer a sauce with ground meat and mushrooms for my pasta dishes, I have added them to the mix and the results were excellent.  Next time, I think I'll add some chopped fennel and Italian sausage.  As people's definition of "spicy" varies widely, let me say that for my family (all of whom love spicy foods) the 2 tsp. of red pepper flakes are not too much, but if you're not a fan of heat, you might want to go easy on the red pepper initially.

Have made variations this recipe many times and would suggest one addition to ameliorate the acidity and smooth the heat a bit.  It works very well in the slow cooker, but improves the stove top version also.  Grated carrots -- lots of 'em -- particularly if the are lying in your veg drawer losing their crunch.  Grate them for the slow cooker, or mash them for stove top;  they will add texture, a bit of natural sweetness and a modicum of incidental nutrition. Slightly off topic, but I also use a large amount in my tomato soup, stick blending the cooked carrots with good canned Italian tomatoes (or cooked fresh ones from your garden) seasoning (basel essential, anything else according to individual taste0.

Excellent sauce! Even my "this doesn't have enough flavor" food critic of a husband liked it. I used some of the leftover sauce to make pizza, by adding tomato paste to give the sauce the appropriate texture. Worked great on the pizza, too.

Very nice, tasty and easy recipe. Add a pinch of sugar or even better a tablespoon of ketchup. The kids don't like the Red pepper flakes.

My kids wanted Spaghetti and I didn't have a bottle of the jar stuff, enough fresh tomatoes to make my own or tomato sauce. After searching I discovered this recipe. Since I was making it for my kids I only used 1tsp of the red pepper. I also put it through my blender to get rid of the chunks. I tasted it after and wow it was spicy! I love spicy food but this was too much for spaghetti. I added about a cup of homemade alfredo sauce and it made the sauce perfect for my kids yet, still a bit spicy.

Very good but very spicy, even with the reduced red pepper.  I needed to add additional tomato sauce, but it was delicious.  I added some sliced chicken sausage to the sauce, and the meal was a hit.

Great sauce but too spicy for us and we love spicy.  I think the pepper flakes need to be cut in half.

I had 5 hungry guys sitting in my living room; I decided to make pasta and realized I didn't have any sauce! So I had to find a quick pasta sauce recipe...  Luckily I had a can of crushed tomatoes handy, as one does, and since this was the quickest, simplest recipe I found, I went for it. Turned out great! If I'd had the time I probably would have let it simmer a bit longer to let the flavors blend a bit more, but you don't refuse food to hungry dudes. Let's just say the pan was completely empty & I caught a few of them eyeing it up like they were tempted to lick it. Definite success! Also, the only can of tomatoes I had was one that had basil already in it... I think it added a little extra flavor. I also didn't use the red pepper flakes, because I didn't have any [but even if I had, I'm a wuss with spicy stuff]. Definitely going to be making this again!

It tastes really good if you add another teaspoon of crushed red pepper. I like things spicy. It can also be used for pizza sauce.
