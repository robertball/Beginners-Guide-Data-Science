There is nothing Lebanese or Arabic about these cookies (I am Arab American) But these cookies were absolutely a delight nonetheless! (As one has stated the originator of the recipe may be Lebanese but that doesn't mean her cookie is! ;-)

I am from the middle east and these cookies are NOT at all from the region...just because the origin of the lady was from lebanon doesn't mean the cookies are! but they are tasty anyhow, give them a try.

Yummy cookie; after reading previous reviews I used too much coconut and they turned out excellent. Nice nutty taste, and the lack of eggs in the dough means I can snack on it while baking cookies. Safely. (Update: Makes really good bar cookies with melted chocolate chip icing; just spread out semi sweet chocolate chips on it when you take it out of the oven, then smear 'em around.)

It tasted a lot like an oatmeal cookie, but a little better. I think they needed more coconut. I was in Israel and I never saw something like this. My husband is Arab and he never heard of it either. But it was good.

Im jordanian, and I assure you, there is no such recipe for cookies around here. They're alright to make anyway, add a bit more coconut than it states though.

These are not at all Arabic.  Nothing about them is Arabic.  And I tried them, they aren't anything special. After the first batch, I had to doctor them up Royally in order for the second and third batch to come out "special".

Even though the name seems quite special. Unfortunately, the cookie has nothing special. It takes very like oatmeal cookie. However, it is quite easy and fast to make it.

This is a nice, tasty cookie recipe which takes some time, but is a good recipe.  I was a bit surprised as I never found these when spending time in the middle east, but it was probably that the regions I was in, oats were a precious , and expensive product. I am glad to have found this recipe.

i halved the recipe. the first time i tried, was too lazy to get my shortening i just used 1 cup of soft margarine in place of 1/2 cup each for butter and shortening. Disastrous. the cookies were too soft that looked like mini round omellettes. Then, curious, tried the next day properly using shortening. was great. I cut the sugar (my dad's diabetics) from 1 cup per recipe to only 2/3 cup for half of recipe. i also added about half cup of walnut (to slow the release of sugar.. i read somewhere) it turned out really great, and i think was pretty safe for diabetics. Very tasty.

Sorry, but I was expecting a more flavorful cookie.  It really didn't impress me.  Now, maybe adding anise seeds to it will really give it an international Middle Eastern flavor.

I was excited to find this recipe, as we had picked up some "cookies" from a bakery that had a slight coconut flavor, but we couldn't figure out where to start to find a recipe to replicate these cookies. When searching Lebanese recipes I found this recipe. I made the recipe as stated and I find that it's a good starting point for a tasty cookie (not just the one I'm in search of), but it needs more! It's dry, so I will try making this again with milk as a liquid. I also think that quick oats need to be used for a finer texture, more coconut, and some vanilla. You also have to really be careful about watching these cookies! Take them out right at 10 minutes or they will be hard. I will re post my review when I make the adjustments stated.
