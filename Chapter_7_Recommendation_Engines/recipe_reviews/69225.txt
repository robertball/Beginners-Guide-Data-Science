I had this today for the very first time and it was fabulous with the following addition:  Butter bread, then sprinkle with cinnamon-sugar mixture.  Toast, then spread with cream cheese mixed with confectioner sugar.  Then add strawberries.  TO DIE FOR.

I make a strawberry bruschetta , except I toast a nutty hearty bread, and spread with a mascarpone cheese flavored with honey and they put strawberries on top, with a sprig of mint. They are always a hit and delicious  and pretty! Bernadette from Hamilton, NJ

Toasted the bread and then put the strawberries on top. Also, I used brown sugar instead of white and a bit of fresh ground black pepper. I  also added a splash of balsamic vinegar to the mix, which helps to pull out the natural sweetness from the strawberries.

I thought this was OK... to me, it tasted a lot like buttered toast with whole fruit on top, rather than jam. 

I mixed up some cream cheese, sugar and cinnamon, and spread it on the bread and toasted it at the same time too. I put the strawberries and sugar on these slices too. I liked those slices better, but, overall, the recipe's a fun, sweet snack.

I do a modified version of this recipe, which is a big hit.  Use zucchini bread instead of baguette (biscotti is also a good substitute) and add other fruits to the strawberries.  I use white peaches and blackberries.  Great for brunch.

Toasted a butered cinnamon-raisin bread, spred a layer of sweetened cream cheese (added Chambord for a nice raspberry undertone), and topped with sliced strawberries. Since the berries were in season, they didn't need sugar. This was delicious with the extra layer of cream cheese...simply delicious!

I absolutely love this recipe.
So simply, so fresh, so easy.
Since my broiler isn't working properly, I popped the baguettes into the toaster & used a hand torch to caramelize the sugar. I had this delicious things for 3 days straight for breakfast or lunch and sometimes for both.

this recipe was ok.... i use a mixture of mango and mandarin oranges instead... i was not very fond of hot fruits.. i think if i were to make this recipe again.. i would only put the baguette under the broiler, not the fruits.. the fruits were better when they were cold..

Wow! This was a huge hit and easy to make.  I also used the strawberry cream cheese which added taste and creaminess.

This was a welcomed change to "normal" tomato-based bruschetta. It was SO amazing! I cut my strawberries and added the sugar and let it just sit in a covered Pyrex overnight for a brunch I was hosting the next morning. I added fresh basil and fresh mozzarella the day of the brunch(It's not bruschetta without these 2 ingredients!). SO simple yet SO good! Everyone raved about the flavor combo and it was the first thing on the table that disappeared. I will be substituting this for tomato based recipes more often- especially in the Summer! Thanks for a great simple twist on an old idea :)

I made this to go with a red wine tasting party. I took a previous suggestion to use mascarpone cheese and I added a little bit of fresh chopped mint on top of the finished bruschetta when it came out of the oven for the final time. I only toasted one side of the bread and spread the cheese and strawberries on the other (watch it close when carmelizing so the bread doesn't burn!)

This is really good.  To add some more flavor I used a slice of creamy brie cheese and then added the strawberries.  Very good!

We loved this! When we made this a second time, we added sugar to the berries after chopping to sweeten. This was spectacular both ways.

I really thought this was going to be weird. First off - do you broil one side & then flip? Yes - I did, added delicious strawberries to the other side, sprinkled sugar on top & broiled. DELISH! I really didn't think it would be good. It was so easy & so tasty! Thanks for showing me that I sometimes have a very closed mind!

I love this recipie. To carmelize the sugar quicker, you can carefully use a blow torch. It might also keep the fruit from getting warm.

I toasted a Finnish Pulla instead of baguettes--but it was braided in a log, so it worked just fine.  I also mixed the sugar in with the strawberries and added a bit of cinnamon.  It makes it a little more syrupy and I didn't bother too much with the caramelization bc I knew I'd burn it.  It was wonderful this way, though!  Thanks for the recipe!

Nice change. I used Hawaiian Sweetbread slices instead. If you do, be sure to slice the bread and let it sit on the counter to air-dry for a day or two. Otherwise, it will be too soft and you won't get the crispiness of a baguette.

Just felt it needed something to "sit"in on the toast.  Maybe a sweetened cream cheese or jam.  Not bad, simple for sure.  Or, maybe drizzle a glaze on top?

As is, this recipe is just ok, but I did what Beth B. suggested, and mixed up some cream cheese, cinnamin, and sugar, and put that on half of them. I also tried with strawberries and raspberries. The results? The ones with the cream cheese mixture were the best, and strawberries were much better than raspberries. With the cream chees mixture, this recipe is a 5+ star, but with just the butter, it is only a 4 star.

I think this recipe's a great starting point.   I tried some with butter and some with just cream cheese.  We actually couldn't really tell a difference between them, maybe its how I did it (slice, spread, broil, fruit, broil).  I'm definitely going to play around with this though, because we really liked how light and summery it tasted.  Next time I'll try a few different steps.  Very fun.

Thought this was a nice change. Turned out a bit dry for my party-goers tastes.
I will probably play with it a bit more.

Instead of butter I used cream cheese and it went perfect with the strawberries, it's was like yogurt but with bread. Sounds gross but it was absolutely perfect. Definitely making it again

Made it exactly as per the recipe with no alterations. Great taste & texture, and the simplicity of the ingredients really lets the strawberries in as the highlight of the dish. Wonderful!

3.19.18  The only thing that I did differently was instead of buttering the baguette, I added a layer of honey vanilla goat cheese which I think really enhanced the flavor.  Strawberries are in season in Florida right now, and I picked two quarts early this morning, can’t get much fresher than that!

I made this exactly as described. Was absolutely amazing. It's a bit sweet vs a typical savoury app. Great change. Make enough for 2 to 3 per person - they will love these.

This was good, but we didn't love it.  We felt like reviewer, Deb C. - once the strawberries got warm in the broiler, it was kinda like eating jam on toast.  We liked the concept of this, and it makes for a very pretty presentation, just not our favorite type of bruschetta.  Not sorry that we tried it.

While very good, we all thought it was very much like having strawberry jam on a piece of toast.  I like the concept, and it’s a good starting point, but the next time I will add julienned basil to the bruschetta.
