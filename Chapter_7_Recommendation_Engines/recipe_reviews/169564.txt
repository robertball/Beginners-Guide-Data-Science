Not sure what happened in the publishing process. Originally this recipe called for a tablespoon of Honteri or Mirin, not sugar. These are sweet cooking sauces which you can definitely find in Asian grocery stores, but most major grocery stores also carry them. If you are going to use sugar I would recommend only using a teaspoon.

This was AWESOME! I made it for my husband and I to pack in our lunch and it was delicious.  I used cayenne pepper & roasted red pepper flakes and plain EVOO instead of chili oil!  The sesame seeds were the perfect crunch!

This was really tasty! A great change from your everyday green salad. Even my husband liked it. I'll definately make it again, but I'll peel the cucumber, and cut down a bit on the sugar. Very quick to toss together.

Solid. I like things a bit spicy so I doubled the chili oil and cut down on the sugar. Awesome

Will definitely make again! Didnâ€™t have chili oil on hand so I used olive oil and cayenne pepper, and I used those mini cucumbers, peeled them and sliced them in half lengthwise before making relatively thin slices. I may have used stevia instead of the sugar also. Such a fresh taste!

7.5.18 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/169564/cucumber-and-cantaloupe-salad/ ... I didn't want to wait a day or two (making chili oil) so subbed 1/8t cayenne, but no oil.  I mixed it with the sugar & salt then added the rice vinegar & poured over.  Pretty cool salad.  What do I mean?  Well, the cantaloupe stays sweet & the cucumbers spice up.  Very slight spice so may up next time or used crushed red pepper & be patient; let it sit.  I peeled the cucumber in stripes & cut in half slices.  Pretty & tastes good, too!  :)

This needs more rice vinegar and the spicy like chili powder or the red pepper spice.  It's really a good dish with spring rolls.  Very nice.  We like the change and its different.

I love all the ingredients seperately so figured this MUST be good. I was wrong. I could not stand this recipe. Actually, no one in the house could. Sorry, I really expected to like it but didn't.

Pretty good, though somehow I thought it would be mindblowing. It sounded like a simple-yet-genius dish. I overhyped it in my mind.
