My daughter enjoyed this but we don't have to sneak veggies into her foods.  It is a savory sauce since it has no added sugar, and I liked that.  It makes a lot and would be a good start to a spaghetti sauce also.

Just an additional note:  Whenever I add dried Italian Seasoning to a recipe, I put it into the palm of my hand & rub it as I put it in. I feel this releases additional flavor.

It was a good recipe but out of the two or three recipes I used to put my pizza together with none of them said I should PAM the pan first and my pizza stuck to the pan.

Wonderful recipe!!! I had an extra zucchini I needed to get rid of, so I added it with all the other veggies.
l do recommend puree-ing (sp?) the vegetables until they're smooth, if you're issuing this for pizza sauce.
