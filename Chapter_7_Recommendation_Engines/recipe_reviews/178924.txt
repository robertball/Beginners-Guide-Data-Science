Very good. I made the salad for friends - I'm not sure what they had more of spinach or the dressing. Its a nice change of pace from store bought dressing

I made this with regular sliced almonds, not candied, because I was in a time crunch. It was still delicious! The vinaigrette dressing definitely makes this recipe. I also substituted apple cider vinegar and brown sugar for white vinegar and sugar.

Yum! I can't wait to have it again. I didn't candy the almonds because I don't like candied nuts and it was still perfect. Dressing was delicious and counterbalanced the sweetness of the cranberries.

I've made this as a side dish for 2 different get-togethers now and everyone raves about it and goes back for seconds.  This is the new recipe that I will be using to impress my friends and to make for my family because we all love it so much!

Quick, easy and very tasty.  I am loving the use of goat cheese in salads and it was a perfect match with the other ingredients.

I loved every part of this salad except for the candied almonds. This is simply a taste preference; I much preferred putting toasted almonds over the rest of the chilled ingredients of the salad.

Great combination of sweet, sour and spicy.  I used brown mustard because it is what I had and the goat cheese was four pepper chevre.  Also, I had dried cherries on hand and not cranberries, but it still works.

This is a great salad - the whole family loved it!  A very versatile dressing.  The nuts, fruit and cheese could all be varied with good results.  I'm using this again.

So good!  Everyone we served it to loved it and asked for the recipe. I used apples instead of cranberries because I had them in the house.

I thought it was fantastic.  I used dried cranberries vs. cherries but the flavor was wonderful.  My husband is not a big dijon or mustard fan and he still loved it.  It's a very well balanced dressing.  Will make again.

My husband and I can't seem to get enough of this delicious salad. Seems like he asks for it practically every day. It's one of the best!

great alternative to your standard dinner salad.  the dressing was good -- although a bit bland.  also, it calls for a bit too much mustard.  mustard keeps it from separating, but the flavor was a bit too strong.  overall though, the ingredients compliment each other well and i got positive reviews from friends and family last night.  i will definitely make it again, but i'll experiment with the dressing for sure.

Sorry to be the one to complain but I thought the dressing was much to strong'... not what I wanted. Will not make again.
