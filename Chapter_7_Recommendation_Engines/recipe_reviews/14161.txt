This recipe has been a long time family recipe from my grandmother. Ours is slightly different in that we used walnuts instead of pecans and we add some chopped apples for a little extra crunch. This is my favorite comfort food. I have been known to make a small batch just for myself!

I made this recipe for my family and they loved it.  I did make a few changes: I omitted the grapes and added 1 cup of walnuts instead of pecans.  It was delicious - and it tasted great the next day. I would definitely make it again.

I thought this was quite good.  It was missing something though and I am going to experiment with other ingredients until I feel it is even more flavorable.

This is an extremely sweet, but delicious dessert-type salad. The second time I made it, I reduced the sugar, used half the whipped topping and added chopped celery,and chopped fresh oranges and pineapple. Excellent!

My grandma used to make a salad similar to this one only without the grapes and nuts.  Those are the only changes I made to this salad.

I have a similar recipe; you reduce the grapes to 1 cup and then add 2c. of diced McIntosh apples .  This is a great recipe to take to a potluck; I have always had requests for the recipe!

I printed this recipe off in 2000 and I've been making it every year since then.  Either at Thanksgiving or at Christmas (or both) it makes quite a bit, so it's good for a crowd and people love it.

This definitely does not taste like I thought it would. I don't like the grapes in this recipe. I'm going to try the Cranberry Whip recipe on this website as it sounds more of what I'm looking for.

I made this for our Christmas dinner. I love cranberries and even my picky eaters said they liked it too. The only change I made is instead of grapes I chopped 3 small honeycrisp apples and it was delicious. This recipe is a keeper for me.

I'm a fruit lover so reduced the grapes to 1 cup, added one cup apples (I like a tart apple to off set the sweetness a bit), and a cup of mandarin oranges.  I also cut down on the sugar.
