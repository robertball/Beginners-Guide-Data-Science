I make these only I use soft tortilla shells. They get ate up faster than just a regular hot dog and bun. Husband will crave them at times! There is no need to boil first

This was a great change to serving the Chili Dogs.  I waited to put the onions on before serving, kids don't like onions on Chili Dogs.  Thanks for the idea.

It doesn't get any easier than this! We loved this and have made it 3 times in the last month. The buns get toasted/crunchy and they hold up well - even the next day!! My son even took one for his lunch. So easy to add toppings of choice. I passed this recipe along and they too, enjoyed it. Thanks so much for a simple, but tasty pleaser!!

I've never had a baked hot dog before. This was a notch up from microwaved hot dogs. I really liked the texture of the hot dog bun too!

This makes for nicely firm buns, but as others have said - a little mustard would probably enhance the flavor.

This was very good! So easy and a quick meal. I did also add diced onion and used Mexican mix cheese instead. I might add jalape√±o or chili powder next time to try how it would taste as a spicy version.

Wow, were these yummy!  I needed a quick and easy weeknight meal, and this fit the bill.  The Hormel chili and the hot dogs were a perfect combo.  They smelled so good while cooking in the oven and tasted as good as they smelled.  The toasted buns are such a nice touch!

I had four leftover hotdogs and buns and wanted to do something different.  I had seen this recipe before and didn't think it would work.  Surprise!  It's easy and GOOD! We ate it with a fork and knife with coleslaw on the side.  The buns get toasty without being dried out.

Used homemade chili and made exactly as directed except for a squirt of mustard before the chili.  Took about 10 mins longer than the recipe states but I packed them in there and our buns were large.  Fantastic recipe!  Will make again!

Very tasty, very easy.  I liked the crispness of the buns.  Baked for 20 minutes and removed foil and baked another 2 minutes to finish melting the cheese.  I did not precook the hot dogs as the recipe says and they were just fine.

Yes, the insides are soggy and the outsides are crisp.  I saw a few reviewers who did not care for that.  I confirm that it is true, but we liked it!  This is not a chili dog you will pick up and eat like a hot dog, but a chili dog that you will have to eat with a fork.  It seems so simple now, but I never thought of putting them in the oven until I read this recipe.
*edit - After these cooled for a little while, my husband was able to pick them up and eat them with his hands.  I still think a fork would be a better method, but he was ok with it.

Everyone enjoyed it very much.  I buttered the insides of the buns which made them really good.  Hubby says he liked this better than the old way.  Will make these again !

Easy, cheap  and tasty. Smells great baking and next time I will add something to kick up the taste a notch - maybe pickles or peppers or diced scallions when serving. Added bonus -  One pan cleanup.

My son loves chili dogs and this recipe kicks it up a notch. I made the Vegetarian Chili Recipe by julieliz here instead of the Hormel, and that makes lots of leftover chili for those not really interested in chili dogs. I used bakery hot dog buns and jumbo hot dogs and threw the dogs on the BBQ for a few minutes to get some nice grill marks. Next time I'll use regular size dogs because it made a pretty big portion with all the chili and cheese - he had no problem with that, though!

I just made these. It was super easy to make and quick, too.  I added chopped onions after it was finished baking. I also boiled the hot dogs, before preparing the dish. The canned Hormel chili was good! I was concerned how the canned chili would taste, but, no problem. I used krft medium cheddar cheese, and i shredded it with my old fasioned metal cheese shreddar. I will make again, soon. Thank you for the recipe!

Gotta say I loved these. Prefer them over a normal chili dog actually, less messy and I loved the crunch that was added by baking them. My family seems to agree and I've made these twice in the last month. Definitely something I will make often.
My son took some leftovers to school the next day and told me that they reheated great.

Very nice twist to a hot dog. Due to availability white sharp cheddar was used. I will definitely make this again.

Ok so my girlfriend actually made this for me lastnight after i sent her the recipe. She added a little diced onion to the mix, but other than that followed it precisely. I have always loved the simple chili dog, and this was a great version. By baking the entire dish in the oven, you get crispy buns with melted cheese all over. I am excited to eat the leftover ones tonight! Simple, easy, American as it comes.

I love chili dogs, and this Hormel chili makes a great one. I especially like the bun heated in the oven. I did add mustard to the dog before baking.

I made this tonight, and it was pretty good. Although, I didn't boil the hotdogs first, I just baked them with the chili and cheese. Turned out good!

I used leftover chili instead of hormel and it was absolutely amazing.
