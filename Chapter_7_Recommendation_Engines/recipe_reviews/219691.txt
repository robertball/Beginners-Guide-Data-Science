I added the same amount of parsley as the rest of the ingredients (to make it officially simon and garfunkel style)  and it was very good.  I will make it again!!!

We liked this but next time I would cut way back on all the spices other then the onion (I used onion powder instead of onion salt as I didn't have any). I also would not add any water next time. I think I would go with the other reviewer that only used a teaspoon of each spice.

This was really yummy.  I only put in a teaspoon of each spice though and I added pepper.  Made French Load to go with it!

I really enjoyed this recipe although I made a few modifications. The spices added a lot of flavor but wasn't overpowering. I mixed all of the herbs with the oil and spread it on the roast. I then seared the roast on all sides to lock in the flavor (got the idea from Marie's pot roast recipe). Then I added the roasted to the liquid ingredients in addition to a sliced onion and some garlic cloves. Once it was cooked I made some of  the juices into gravy. Delish!

For those who thought there was too much herb, try using fresh herbs, chopped finely, in the same amounts.  Dried herbs are pretty intense, especially a tablespoon of each.  Needs onion, celery, and garlic, and of course, fresh parsley to finish the song.

This was OK overall and liked the use of jarred gravy, but WAY too much spice for my tastebuds. It might be OK if the spice was cut by at least 1/2. Smelled OK while cooking, but could tell it was going to be a strong flavor. If you like strong flavors, you'll love this. Me, not so much.

This pot roast was fine. I personally noticed nothing exceptional about it and nothing bad about it. It was fairly easy, though because I added vegetables (potatoes, carrots, and pearl onions) there was a bit of peeling and chopping prep time. It smelled absolutely delicious while cooking, though didn't taste as strong as it smelled. I was also very hesitant about jarred gravy, but mixing it with the water helped thin it out and taste a bit more natural. I'll make it again if I have home made gravy on hand.

No, Heinz gravy in a jar is not home-made, but it comes close! Now add a big chunk of beef and slow cook it in the gravy with spices, and that gravy is a whole lot more homemade! I think this is a good recipe for a crock pot, which doesn't necessitate making gravy as an additional step. Love the flavors. Use of spices is your judgement call. Why not mix everything in a small bowl and then decide how much you want to add? I liked the idea of coating the meat with the spices and then browning, i think it added a dimension of flavor! But then again, it was another step of work!! Either way, this is a delicious, EASY roast dinner with gravy, that cooks while you do something else!! Good work Desimone!! I love it and will make this again for sure!!

Everyone in my family liked this, mmm mmm good!  I did change up a bit, I browned the roast first and I used 1c merlot and 1c beef broth in place of the 3c water and I added that to the pan that I browned the roast in. I used two cloves garlic and 1T of parsley.

This was very good. After 3 hours though I added 1/2 pkg of baby carrots and 4 chopped potatoes to the slow cooker. That way I had my whole meal in one pot. I'll make this again.

I thought the addition of the water was unnecessary.  Meats cooked for long periods in the crock pot tend to let out lots of juice, anyway.  If I had more time, I would have tried to add some cornstarch or flour to thicken the gravy up.  I did add red potatoes and carrots while cooking.  It was just ok to me.

Honestly, this is a very good and easy recipe...I prepared mashed potatoes with it and poured the gravy and beef on top. I think it was a good mix. However, I noticed that the potatoes seemed sweet in comparison to the pot roast. If you like a bit of sweet and salty flavor this is a good combination. I may make this again it is way easy. I followed the other advices on using a bit less of the dried herbs. I rectified the salt as I did not have onion salt. I added a bit of pepper and seared the beef for 5 minutes each side before putting it in the oven for about 1 hour...I wanted it softer so I put it to simmer in the stove top for one more hour while I did other stuff around the house...

I made this and it turned out really great. I used some of the tips from the previous reviews such as using a teaspoon of each spice... I didn't have the sage and added pepper and parsley flakes as well. I also used onion powder instead of onion salt. I was worried that it would turn out to be salty but it came out perfect. Also didn't use the amount of water it asked for and only used half a cup since I added some potatoes and carrots halfway through the cook time. Definitely going to try this again and maybe even tweak it more by stuffing the roast with garlic.

I made this tonight.. loved it. Good old fashioned chuck roast dinner. I removed the meat (which I doubled, but kept the gravy and seasoning the same)and kept it warm and found the gravy to be kinda thin and bland, so I seasoned it with some beef base, onion powder, salt and pepper. Then thickened it, on high, with some flour and water. Two thumbs up by my family!!

This was okay, my husband did eat 2nds but said it had too much rosemary in it and I agree. Also needs garlic. I followed the recipe as is except I added some garlic salt and used onion powder. I also added chopped green onions, baby carrots and potatoes. I thickened the gravy with a cornstarch slurry too. I liked it, but the rosemary gave me heartburn as it does when I have too much, though I like the taste. I will make again, but reducing the rosemary and trying the parsley with it too. Oh yes, I did sear this in a hot skillet per other reviewer's suggestions.

I added 1 tablespoon parsley so it is true to the song.  It added color and not too much flavor.  This is a good recipe to use on a cold blistery day.

The roast was tasty but nothing special.  I just wanted to try it because of the name.  I of course added Parsley as well to complete the song.

This is the easiest and best recipe I have ever eaten! I've made this many times, and everyone just loves it. I added some parsley too, as it goes with the song. Haha. Also some coarse ground black pepper.  Good to go! See you at dinnertime!

Excellent dish.  I made it exactly as shown and the flavor was great.  The I sliced the roast into 1/4" slices and piled them high covered with gravy.  Everyone commented how tender and tasty it was.

This was very good. I use similar ingredients. So to me it was superb. I'm not a wine user so if you want wine go for it.  I cook very simple.. But this was very tasteful.

I'm not a huge roast person, but my boyfriend enjoyed this. It was very soupy, and I would've liked the juice to be thicker for the potatoes and carrots that I added.
