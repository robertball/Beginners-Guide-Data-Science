Delicious and moist! I made some changes to the recipe; I added 1 cup milk, 1 cup chips, 1 cup sugar, 1/2 cup oil, and some vanilla essence. With the sugar topping, they were plenty sweet. Only problem was there was way too much batter for 12 muffins; I ended up making two trays and they were done in 18 minutes. I give it four stars only because of all the changes I had to make; otherwise it would be five!

I have been using this recipe for a year now and it is my "official" chocolate chip muffin mix.  By making some very simple alterations, I've had some really wonderful results.  First, to combat dryness, I add the amount of 3/4 cup of milk AND 1/4 cup of sour cream. Not enough moistness for you?  I've gone as much as 1/2 cup of the sour cream and been happy with it--depends on your tastes.  I also add a teaspoon of vanilla extract into the batter, which lends a great flavor.  I love the topping of sugars, but they are also wonderful with coarse sugar sprinkled on the top.  It's a simple recipe that yields consistant results.  My daughters love these muffins and request them often.

These turned out great - I followed the advice of other reviewers and used 1 cup milk (instead of 3/4 cup) and also used slightly more oil. They turned out fluffy, moist and delicious!!!

I made these this morning. They were super easy to put together. The smell was wonderful and the taste is even better. I followed the other reviewers advice and used the full cup of Milk. I also added in about a 1/2tsp of Vanilla. They were a hit for breakfast. I will make again.

These muffins were ok, but not the best by far.  I'll keep looking.  I did add 1 cup of milk (instead of the 3/4) and an extra egg + 1/4 cup oil (instead of 1/3), and 1 1/2 tsp vanilla, which seemed to make them better.  Overall, there is a key ingredient/taste missing from these muffins that I can't quite put my finger on....

I just felt like muffins tonight, so I found this recipe.  SUPER EASY.  I used 1 cup of milk and 1/2 tsp vanilla.  These items were too important for the author to miss, so I rated this 4 STARS.

While it usually drives me crazy when reviewers go tinkering around with recipes, I thought this was a good one.  As an experienced baker, though, one usually creams the wet ingredients with the sugar and then adds the dry...which is what I did.  I blended the oil, 1 cup of milk, egg (and I added some vanilla) in my Kitchenaid...then added the dry ingredients and hand-stirred in the chips.  The sugar on top was a nice touch and my muffins came out just fine.  I'd definitely make these again.  If you don't use cupcake liners, don't bake these as long...the sugar will burn along the sides of the muffin pan.

I thought these were delicious and very quick & easy to make. I didn't use the topping/glaze and used 1 c of the big chocolate chips instead of the minis.

Really, really good. Deliciously moist. I changed the bake time to 18 minutes as suggested, and they turned out perfect. The picture they have doesn't do them justice.

Delicious! Just like the ones I used to buy at a gourmet coffee shop in San Diego.   Per some of the other reviews, I added more milk--about 1 cup total. I like the crunchy goodness of the sugar baked on top, but found that I didn't need nearly as much as the recipe called for. The Results were satisfying with just half the amount of sugar sprinkled on top (though I did not cut the amount of sugar in the actual batter). I like the mini chips and would probably not make these with full-size ones since the chocolate seems well dispersed with the mini chips. Mine were done in exactly 20 minutes.  The recipe was easy to follow, used ingredients most cooks would already have on hand, and the results were delicious. This is a keeper!

I made these following the written directions, except I held off the topping and made them mini muffins.  I thought they were really good as is, but I'm going to make them today again and I'll add the extra milk most ppl agree is better.

Very good muffin recipe!!  I was wanting to make chocolat chocolate chip muffins, but couldnt find a decent one on this site.  So I made the following adjustments: 1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder added to 1 2/3 cup flour to equal a total of 2 cups as recipes lists.  1 cup milk rather than 3/4 cup(I used evaporated milk since thats what I had on hand), and 1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract.  I also left off the sugar topping.  As the directions state, it is VERY VERY important to never over mix a muffin or any quick bread batter.  This will cause it to be tough once baked.  I mix just until incorporated, lumps are OK, they will bake out in the oven.  I also recommend buying a commercial portion scoop for making muffins and cupcakes.  Theyre no more than $10 and your muffins/cupcakes will come out even and same sized.  The scoop to look for typicaly has a blue handle and is known as #16 scoop (for a standard sized muffin tin), or food dipper.  They look like an ice cream scoop.  I bought mine for $5.  And I use it every tiime I make muffins or cupcakes.  I also use a #30 (black handle) for perfect size cookies!

I'm rating these four stars. These muffins are YUMMY! But the baking time is off. Many reviews say to shorten the baking time so I did. I set my timer for 15 minutes and I think they would have been perfect at around 13 minutes. I have an oven thermometer so I can say pretty confidently that the given time is most definitely off. The other two changes I made were to add 1/4 cup of light sour cream to help with any dryness issues. I also added some sprinkles to the batter and to the top of the muffins because, as my 5 year old likes to say, sprinkles make everything better :) I love the sugar topping but I had a lot left over so next time I will cut that in half. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Mmmmmm!  I just made these and they are delightful!  I did alter the recipe a little bit, the changes I made: 1 cup of milk instead of 3/4 cup 2 eggs instead of 1 egg and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract for a little added flavor. I also used the traditional method, mixing all dry ingredients, then all wet in another bowl and then combining slowly. I did forgo the topping as I wanted these to truly feature the chocolate and they did!

I made these for my son and husband.  My son picked out the chocolate chips and left the rest.  My husband and I found these to be dry and bland.  Won't be making them again.

These are great, I cut the recipe in half but used 1/2 cup chocolate chips and a whole egg. These were the best chocolate chip muffins I've ever had, definately give them a try.

Loved this recipe with a few changes. I used 1 c. milk as suggested by several, increased the oil to 1/2 c., substituted one of the cups of flour for 3/4 c. whole wheat flour, and only baked them for 15 minutes (which may be because I think my oven is hotter than it says). The muffins came out moist and delicious! I would make them again, however next time I think I will skip the sugar topping. I think they would taste wonderful without it and the muffin pan would be a little easier to clean.

I added 1/4 cup sour cream and didn't sprinkle the sugars on top. The muffins are wonderfully light and not overly sweet. Great recipe and will use again! Am going to try using berries instead of chips next.

Awesome! Would have given 6 stars if I could. I did make some changes based on other reviews. I used 1 C milk, almost 1 C oil, 1 C chips, and about 1/2 C Heath Toffee chips, (had them on hand). I think with the sugar topping, that the 1/2 C sugar in the recipe is enough. They are perfectly sweet. Made 12 big muffins (normal size muffin pan, not mammoth size muffin pan) and I did fill them almost completely full. (19 minutes in the darker non stick pan.) They puff up tho, don't spill out over the pan. Going to be my go to muffin recipe from now on! Thanks!

With a few alterations, following on the suggestions of other reviewers, these muffins were moist and FABULOUS! Even my nanny who doesn't like chocolate thought they were great. 

The alterations I made are as follows: 2/3 cup of raw sugar (we don't have processed white sugar here in Uganda so I always use raw), 1 cup milk, just under 2/3 cup oil, 2 eggs, 100g chocolate bar (smashed into pieces). I also didn't use the topping, but will try raw sugar next time.

The first time I made these, they turned out great! I didn't follow any of the reviews, just followed the recipe exactly. Second time, I added the 1/4 cup of milk, and put the crumb mixture on half and left it off half, just cause I like seeing my muffins- not a fan of crumb toppings, although I do think they taste okay, and in this case, makes the tops have more colour. Next time I make, I'm going to cream the sugars with the butter, egg, and vanilla and sift the dry ingredients together to see if it changes the texture at all.

these are good. You really need to up the sugar to 3/4-1c, milk to 1=1/4, and oil to 1/2 cup and add vanilla. I really dont think it needs THAT much chocolate so 3/4 is just right, they come out moist and tasty

I was told tasty but a bit dry.  I took the suggestions by past reviews and added 1 cup of milk and 1/2 cup oil and I could feel the moistness when I held one.  Brought them to a work event and everyone said they were so moist and delicious.  Def add extra milk and oil but easy recipe.  Love the recipe otherwise and who doesn't love chocolate?

The only reason I didn't give this recipe 5 stars is that I had to alter the recipe to make them moist and tasty.  If you make this recipe as it is written you will be sorry and end up with dry crumbly muffins.   Here's what I did and I recommend you do the same.  Use 1 cup of milk, 1/2 cup vegetable oil, and a 1/2 tsp of vanilla.  If you follow those measurements, you will end up with a moist flavorful muffin.  Make sure you spray your muffin tin well.  And the side of the tin too, not just the bottom.  I used regular sized chocolate chips since that was all I had and they worked well in the recipe.

I really disliked this recipe it was not at all moist enough and much more like a biscuit than a muffin.

I made this recipe for my son's school snack.  It was a big hit.  His friends told him he brought the best snack ever!  It is incredibly moist!  This is a very easy recipe with great results.  Can't go wrong on this one.

I made a few changes to these too.  To the original ingredients, I added 1/4 cup skim milk (for a total of 1 cup skim milk), 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa, 1 cup Splenda, 1/3 cup unsweetened applesauce, and 1 tsp vanilla extract.  I substituted the egg with 1/2 cup Egg Beaters (the equivalent of 2 eggs) and used whole wheat flour instead of white.  I also omitted the topping.  The results were fantastic!  The muffins actually taste like the not-so-good for you versions you can buy at coffeehouses and grocery stores.  Even my very picky daughter loves them!

Changes made: 1 cup milk and a little more oil (add until it's a wet, but thick consistency).  The muffins came out big and fluffy.  The tops were nice and crunchy, and the insides were moist.  I definitely will make these again.  Chocolate chip muffins are my weakness.  These were really good!

I added the extra milk like other reviewers said and used full-size chocolate chips since I didn't have any minis. Very easy recipe. I made these for my sister's kindergarten class, and all of her students loved them, but every adult who tried them wasn't too fond - definitely more of a child-friendly recipe, I would say.

I read a few reviews before I made them and the consensus was that they were not very moist made as followed.  I increased the milk to 1 cup, 1 additional egg and 2 tsp of vanilla extract. It turned really moist and tasty.

These muffins were very easy to make and taste great. I followed the other suggestions and used 1 cup milk, added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp vanilla extract and used whole wheat flour. They didn't rise as much but tasted great. Definitely will be making these again.

I modified this recipe a tad. I used only 1Tbsp canola oil and 1/3 cup unsweetened applesauce. 1C milk and 1/2 Tbsp cinnamon as well as 1C chips made these awesome. The chips are all melty and yummy!

these are not good muffins! they are dry, crumbly, and lack taste. people told me they only enjoyed them because of the chocolate chips! i would not make these again. I would personally add more sugar, and bake them only for 20, not the recommended 25.

My kids loved these muffins, with some changes.  For perfect results: 2 eggs instead of 1, 1 cup milk instead of 3/4 cup, and 1 tsp vanilla.  I didn't change the amount of oil and they were perfect.
Especially for a kids birthday morning breakfast!

I made these early in the morning we left for vacation and packed them in simple gallon size zipper bags.  They traveled wonderful and made for a great snack.  The recipe made 18 for me.  Had a few left over the next morning and they were still delicious the next day.  I did take others advice and used 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup milk along with adding 1 tsp. vanilla.  I also used a whole bag of chips (we liked it that way!!).  Became an instant family favorite recipe.

Pretty good.  They aren't very sweet, so you might want the topping - or else just know what to expect.  A bit like tea biscuits, but the chips are nice and gooey.  It can make up to 18 small muffins.  Make sure to use 1 cup milk instead of 3/4.

The muffins taste great and are so easy to make!  I had to watch them carefully with a toothpick in hand at about 15-20 minutes into the baking to make sure it wasn't too crispy but as long as I'm careful they turn out great.  The muffins taste great without the brown sugar/white sugar topping as well (better in my opinion).

I love this recipe! It has become one of my specialties. Friends and family are always asking for them. I cut out the brown sugar though. With it, the tops are crispy, with out they are perfect! Fresh out of the oven is the best way to eat. Even heating in the microwave for a few seconds helps. I always try to serve warm!!

I used the suggestions to alter the recipe - 1 cup milk, 1/2 cup oil, and 1/2tsp of vanilla. I also added a dash of cinnamon - maybe 1/4 tsp? and put in maybe a little more than a cup of mini semi-sweet chocolate chips and some butterscotch chips. I cooked them for 18 minutes. The muffins turned out to be absolutely delectable! My roommates devoured them. So, I think the recipe is great if you follow the alterations (and maybe add a few of your own ;)

If you needed to double the ant of liquids to make the recipe work I consider it a total failure. Proof read the recipe. It makes dough not a batter. Fail if you follow the recipe. It works if you increase liquids.

Mmmmm good! These turned out really good! I am glad I read the reviews...like others, I added 1 cup milk, 1/2 cup oil, 1 cup choco chips (I used milk cause it was all I had) and 1 tsp vanilla extract. I baked mine for 20 min at 400F. Can't wait for my kids to get home from school to try them out. Thanks for the recipe:)

I followed the advice of Mandacook1 and added 1/4 cup of sour cream and vanilla extract. I also substituted melted butter for the oil since I didn't have any & I used 1cup white flour and 1 cup whole wheat flour. It turned out fantastic and very moist. This recipe is super simple to make and tasted really good. I love it because I can throw these together at the drop of a hat.

I followed the advice of others and used 1/2 cup milk and 1/2 cup sour cream. They turned out better than the local bakeries!

I followed other suggestions and altered the recipe, 1 cup of Milk and 1 tspn of Vanilla and I baked for 18 minutes and even that was too long. Should have been more like 15 minutes. Over all pretty good. My 5 year old scarffed them down!

I read through previous comments and tried my own variant on the recipe, which both boys loved. I used whole wheat pastry flour, substituted Sucanat for sugar, added 1/4 cup plain non-fat yogurt, and a full cup of large chocolate chips.

Very quick and easy, i loved the sugary top.  I did the recipe with the 1 cup milk and i prefered that so much more.  There weren't enough flavors. Next time i'll try it with vanilla.  After a day it really hardened up though, so eat them fast!

I used 1 cup of milk and half a cup of apple juice to add moisture and sweetness. They turned out great! I also used all the batter in a SIX muffin tin to make large muffins which needed to be cooked a little longer.
We ate em' all!!!!

If made as per the recipe, these muffins turn out VERY dry, though still pretty tasty.  To aid with the dryness, I would suggest the same additions as other reviewers: adding 1 cup of milk (rather than 3/4), being liberal with the oil, and adding a splash of vanilla.

Overall good recipe but the sugar topping is completely unnecessary. Baked up really well. I filled my muffin cups rather full so it only made 9. I always just use an ice cream scoop to fill the muffin cups to make it easier and faster for me; there's the added bonus of a really high muffin top that way.

These were the best chocolate chip muffins I have ever had anywhere!  I used a full cup of milk and chocolate chips.  I put all of the wet ingredients in my kitchen aid and mixed together then added the dry ingredients just until blended.  Then I folded the chocolate chips in.  Batter made exactly 12 beautiful muffins.  Baked for 20 minutes.  Reheat 1 muffin for 20 seconds in microwave if you have any leftover.

Giving it four stars as it is.  I followed the suggestions and used a full cup of milk and sugar and 1/2 cup of oil and a teaspoon of vanilla.  Used regular chips in the mix and mini chips and sanding sugar on top!  I baked them for 18 minutes ( if you are doing this for the first time, watch them closely so they don't burn!).  They are fabulous!

They tasted great. They just, were sort of stiff and dry. Other than that, they were okay. My family liked them though. They're not the worst, and absolutely not the best.

This is a great, easy recipe! Based on other reviewers' suggestions, I used 1 cup milk (instead of 3/4 cup) to make them moist, and I used 1 cup mini semi-sweet chocolate chips (instead of 3/4 cup) because I'm a chocolate fan. I didn't bother with the sugar topping, so I can't comment on that - my husband and I prefer the less is more route when it comes to sugar - and they were simply divine! An uncomplicated, must-save recipe!

Fantastic with a few minor changes! I used 1 cup of milk instead of 3/4, 1/2 cup of oil instead of 1/3, 1 cup of chocolate chips instead of 3/4, and I added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract.  I baked them for 15 min. and that was perfect.. they were moist and delicious! A new family favorite!

I found these muffins a bit bland. I added the 1/4 cup of sour cream and 1/2 tsp of vanilla and the batter tasted like pancakes a little bit. Good texture, crusty on the outside, moist on the inside, it just lacked something. A good recipe, but something is missing. I'm not sure I would make these again without adding and changing some ingredients to make it more flavourful.

I followed other reviewers advice on adding 1 cup of milk and cooked for about 16minutes. These turned out pretty good. If the milk measurement didn't need to be changed to 1 cup, plus the baking time made shorter I would give 5 stars, so for this I rate 4 stars.

These  were very, very good! I added a few more chocolate chips than the recipe called for and about 1/8 cup of extra oil to make the batter more pourable. I made a second batch using blueberries instead of chocolate chips and they were good, too!

I made these this morning (42 mini muffins) and they turned out great.  I did increase the milk to 1 cup but I left the oil and sugar as the recipe states.  It was plenty sweet enough.  I made them for breakfast not dessert.  Also because it's Christmas time, I had my kids sprinkle green & red sugar on top instead of the sugar/brown sugar combo.  We will make again!

I LOVE these muffins!!!! I have made them again and again because they are so delicious. After about the 4th time, i followed someone else's suggestion and put in 1 cup of milk,1/2 cup vegetable oil, and a 1/2 tsp of vanilla. They turned out super moist and were so much better, although they were still wonderful without those extras! :)

Darn it...I wish I had read the reviews before making these.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I found these too be too dry and not enough chocolate chips.  I also think 20 minutes was way too long to bake these....I was working around the house and forgot to check them and let them cook the whole 20 minutes--my bad.  I will try them again with the suggestions of other reviewers.  It seems like a good standard recipe but may need some tweeking.  Thanks for sharing it though.

Great Recipe I added the extra milk and oil like others suggested and extra chocolate chips and they were perfect! Totally awesome.  Tweak the recipe to make these changes and it would be 5 stars!

I made these without following any of the comments and found them to be too dry!  I also only used 1/2 of the sugar topping and found it to be too sweet... next time i will try the recommendations from other bakers.  Still a decent recipe!!

Very easy recipe.  I did also use 1c milk and substituted the oil with apple sauce.  Mmmm, came out nice and moist and a bit healthier.  I also did not add the sugar on the top as the muffins are sweet enough. 
Thank you for sharing!

Good but not the recipe I'm searching for. I followed the recipe but did add a bit extra milk based on some of the reviews. The texture was good but the taste wasn't too exciting.

These muffins are only good for the first half hour of baking. Afterwards they are too dry and not very flavourful. The consistency suffers quite a bit. I would not try this recipe again.

I had to change this recipe too much to give it 5 stars.  The original recipe was too dry and not sweet enough for me or my family's liking.    I changed: 1 cup milk 1/4 cup sour cream 1 teaspoon vanilla 1 cup mini chocolate chips  The sugar topping was wonderful though.  I made some colored sugar for fun!

These were excellent! I followed another baker's instructions and added 1 cup milk, 1 cup chips, 1 cup sugar, 1/2 cup oil. They were just the right texture and consistency. Though there was enough batter to make about 18 muffins. Not a problem though, I know these will disappear fast so its probably a good thing.

I made these last night; the other reviewers are right...they are pretty dry and crumbly.  However they were easy and had a nice taste.  I'm going to try to up the milk and oil, as suggested and see how they turn out.  Overall, though, not bad.

These muffins were wonderful and super easy. My kids loved eating and help making them. I did increase the milk (1 cup) and oil (1/2 cup) and added some vanilla. This is definitely a keeper.

These muffins are very simple to make and delicious BUT the sugar topping burned horribly. and my whole apt smells burnt instead of the yummy muffin smell. Maybe because I bake in a toaster oven. But I think it still shouldn't've happened.

I followed the recipe exactly and this muffin is HEAVY and DRY.  I decided to baked these based on the star ratings, but after I read the reviews I realized that many reviewers altered the recipe.  Then it is no longer THIS recipe and should not be rated at all. Please people...rate the recipe as is, not after you altered it.

These were very dry and turned out more like biscuits than muffins - even after all the alternations to combat the dryness (more milk). I will keep looking.

very rarely do I review a recipe but this time I will.  I gave it 5 stars only because I know my kids will love these and the batter alone is a great base to use with so many other flavored muffins.  I only made a few changes of  increasing to 1 C of Milk and 1/2 C oil. I also didn't sprinkle the tops with white and brown sugar so they wouldn't be too sweet. Muffins are very moist and mine cooked in 20 minutes. Oh and I used regular sized choc. chips cause that is what I had.  Thanks for the Recipe!!!

I really liked this recipe.  I read the top reviews and followed their modifications.  I believe there is too much chocolate chip (1 cup) added as per the first few reviews.  I think either 1/2-3/4 cup is good enough.  Same thing for the sugar as I found it a little too sweet for me and my family.  The vanilla essence/extract is a good idea.  And the extra amount of milk and oil recommend by reviewers worked out fine for me.    And I couldn't finish using all the toppings the original recipe recommended using.  You can probably cut the topping amounts by one half and it would still be enough.

I thought these muffins were just ok. I did change the recipe slightly by adding in 1/4 cup sour cream and 1 tsp. vanilla extract. Also increased the chocolate chips to 1 cup and used regular size instead of mini since that's what I had on hand. The muffins looked and smelled great when they came out of the oven. As they cooled they became a little hard on the outside and the sugar topping cracked and started breaking off to reveal a pale (but fully cooked) muffin top underneath. I think that sprinkling coarse sugar crystals on top would probably be a better alternative. When I tasted a muffin I immediately noticed it was not sweet enough and had a little bit of a floury taste. I will try to make these again, but next time I will increase the sugar that goes into the batter and leave off the sugar topping. I'm not sure the sour cream I added really did anything as far as flavor or moistness goes, so I will leave it out next time.

Yummy muffins.  I changed the recipe by using 1 cup of buttermilk in place of the milk, and adding a 1/4 t. of baking soda.  Moist and delicious!

These muffins did not have a good taste.  I took other reviewer's advice and used only 1/2 cup of oil instead of 3/4 cup, 1 cup of milk, and 1 cup of chocolate chips.  They just tasted too oily for me.  Will not make again.

I loved these muffins. Although they were a bit dry so I suggest adding a little extra milk. These were a big hit at my house. I strongly reccomend these muffins! You don't need as much topping as it calls for. We had a lot left over, but great recipe!

Not bad at all.  This is an easy, basic muffin recipe that can be adjusted to anyone's taste.  I noticed a few people said it was bland and not sweet enough.  Any sweeter and I think you start getting into cupcake territory.  The first time I made it I pretty much followed the recipe to the letter except for adding a bit more milk.  I tried it again today (still have half a bag of chocolate chips burning a hole in my cupboard) and I changed it up a bit.  I stuck with 1 cup of milk, added an extra egg and changed the the 1/2 cup white sugar to 1/4 cup white, 1/4 cup brown. I also included 1 tsp of vanilla. I left off the topping this time as well due to the extra 1/4 cup of sugar added in the mixture.  I'm sure they'll go fast at breakfast in the morning!

4 star rating because the kids loved them, don't think they didn't much for an adult palate, even though I have a sweet tooth.  I wish I would have added the sour cream as suggested in a few posts...next time.

These are so yummy!  I gave it a 4 because I added 2 extra things (sour cream and vanilla as suggested by others.)  I love that they are not too sweet and the sugar topping just gives it the exact amount of sweetness. Thanks for such a great recipe. I will definitely be making these again.

I followed the recipe exactly except I increased the chocolate chips to a full cup and I got 12 large muffins from it. Mmm, these are really good.  I was a little concerned that they will not be sweet enough but the chocolate chips and the little dusting of sugar on top really balances it all out! Thx.

I just made these this morning.  They are very easy to put together.  I made a double batch and got 24 good sized muffins and 12 mini muffins.  I used a large Papmered Chef scoop to fill the muffin cups.  I made some changes suggested by other reviewers...add 1/4 c. sour cream and I used regular chocolate chips, not mini.  These muffins are tender on the inside with a nice crisp top.  They look like they came from a bakery.

Great traditional muffins!  I have now made these several times.  I do add 1t of vanilla extract to the recipe.   Sometimes I make the recipe without the chocolate chips.....fill 6 of the muffin cups with plain batter....then, gently fold in the chips for the other 6 muffin cups so that I end up with some with chips...and, some plain tender muffins.  I can only assume that those that are adding the extra milk are looking for a muffin that is more like a cup cake.

I just finished making these, they're pretty bland.  The recipe is missing something but I just can't figure it out.  I made the following changes: 1c milk, 1/2 tsp vanilla, and 3 tbsp brown sugar which helped a bit but there was still a strong flour taste.

I substituted the milk for 1 cup nonfat plain yogurt, and only added 1/4 cup oil. The consistency is quite muffiny unlike the scone texture other reviewers had posted. My kids love them and they are really very simple to make!

a little bland, but kids enjoy these. i did change the recipe by using 1c milk, 1/2c oil, and 1c regular choc chips instead of what was written. i also added 2tbs sour cream, 1/4c of brown sugar, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and 1tsp vanilla to improve the flavor. i also added walnuts to the "adult batch" which tasted delicious. make sure you do the sugar topping, it really adds a nice touch!

I made these muffins for "snack day" at my son's kindergarten. Everyone raved at how moist and delicious they were. I added 1/2 cups milk and 1/2 cup sour cream. I used mini chocolate chips and made mini muffins. They had to bake about 10 minutes, and they were perfect.

Very good muffins. Made this as mini muffins. My kids don't like muffins with struesel topping, so omitted it completely. Increased the milk to 1 cup as per another reviewer, added a tsp of vanilla. Baked at 375 (was using dark non-stick pan) and baked for 12 minutes. These made 32 mini muffins. Perfect for toddlers since they waste the regular size muffins. Will definitely make again.

This was an excellent tasting recipe that I would definitely make again. However, it gets only four stars because of the dryness issue that others have mentioned. I started with one cup of milk rather than the suggested 3/4 cup and it was perfect. The recipe doubled well and made two dozen regular sized muffins when doubled. I did not put any sugar on the tops, but when I make these again, I will try the coarse white sugar crystals suggested by another reviewer.

Simple and easy.  I loved it and only added raw sugar to the top coat sprinkle in addition to brown and regular sugar.  Adds a little extra sparkle...otherwise, very nice muffin.

I really can't understand the positive reviews on this recipe.   I made some of the recommendations including using apple sauce instead of oil, using 1 cup of milk, and adding 1 tsp of vanilla.  Even with the changes, I would not recommend these muffins to anyone.

Yum! These muffins were de-lish. I followed the recipe, tweaking it a little bit like others said: added a teaspoon of vanilla extract, substituted chocolate chips for blueberries, added two spoonfuls of sour cream, and used 1 cup of milk instead of 3/4 cup. Not the best muffins ever, but definitely in the top 5!

Well, I've made this recipe several times now and I'm getting close to perfecting it.  I've made several changes to make these more muffin-like, less scone-like: reduce flour to 1 1/2 cups, increase milk to 1 cup, increase vegetable oil to 1/2 cup, add 1 tsp vanilla and omit the white sugar & brown sugar for topping (I don't like the sugar on top.)  Next time I make these I might try a little less baking powder, too.  Good luck!

Followed recipe exactly. Was not impressed with it. Ended up throwing the muffins away. Very dry, hard, and little flavor. Will not make again.

My daughter made these for her dad and I when we went to visit and we loved them.  However, when I made them they didn't taste anywhere as good. We finally realized she had left out the oil.  I made them again without the oil and they were great. We'll make them many more times but we'll never use the oil again!

Had relatives in from out of town - went to Perkins they didn't have any chocolate chip muffins so I wanted to make them some. I chose this recipe because it had so many reviews that were favorable. I followed the suggestions of increasing the milk b ut I also made the following changes - I added 2T. unsweetened cocoa and 2T. brown sugar to the dry products. Baked at 400 degrees for 18 minutes and they were awesome. I did not add any vanilla. They were perfectly sweet and muffin consistency.

I've made this recipie a couple times just becuase It's easy and I tend to have the ingredients on hand. I have made the following changes with the best results. Add 1 Tsp vanilla. increase milk and sugar to 1 cup. I have also tended to use just a smidge more oil. These changes definately make for sweeter, fluffier muffins.

I made one batch with white chocolate chips, and one with milk chocolate chips, and both were good! I thought they were perfect without all the changes to the ingredients that were suggested.. after the changes they tasted more like cupcakes then muffins!

I make these muffins all the time and they are delicious!  I always freeze them and put a couple in the microwave for breakfast.  One time I didn't freeze them and they were very dry the day after.  I never sprinkle the brown and white sugar on top (personal preference) and I always add about 1/2 cup of vanilla yogurt to make them even more moist.

Chose this recipe to bake for Teacher appreciation week from Moms in Touch group. I took the advise of others and did need to add more milk (I use almond milk). Also, substituted coconut oil in place of vegetable. Do add the sprinkled sugars on top! I had to put them in my freezer quickly as I was so tempted to just keep eating them. This is a beautiful muffin for gift giving.

These were ok with all of the changes that had to be made as the other reviewers have recommended, I added 2 eggs, a cup of milk, a whole cup of the regular choc. chips and in addition to all of this, I added almost 2 teaspoons of cinnamon to give it a kick. They were still dry after all. I will probably not make these again.

Very good recipe but only with the additions that others left in their reviews.  I increased the sugar to 1 cup or it would not have been sweet enough.  I omitted the sugar toppings and I had to bake for 24 minutes but I used a mini loaf pan.  Other than the sugar they are excellent, moist and a good recipe.

This is a great muffin recipe. I also increased the milk to 1 cup instead of 3/4. Don't forget the sugar topping, at first it seemed like a lot of sugar, but it tastes wonderful and makes the muffins look scrumptious!

Pretty good, I followed the advice of a few other users by adding 1c of milk, but next time I think I'm actually going to add a tiny bit more..
I also substituted the oil for butter, because I for one enjoy the buttery taste of muffins and lastly added a bit of brown sugar in combination of the white sugar to make 1/2 cup.
good stuff!

Fast and easy, try substituting applesauce for the oil, the taste is great and they're low fat.  Also this recipe makes 12 very large muffins, I prefer making 18 smaller muffins, just adjust cooking time so as not to overcook.

Good but far too dry. I added up to one cup milk... maybe adding also some more oil or yogurt would make them softer.

Followed the recipe exactly. They were super dry and I even took them out of the even at as round 16 minutes. The kids didn't like them and I would not recommend these.

Muffins were very good.  I did follow the suggestions of other reviewers, adding  the extra milk, oil and adding in vanilla extract.  I felt the sugar on top was a bit too sweet for me, the muffins were sweet enough.  I would definitely make these again.  Very tasty and easy.

The first reason I do not like these is because I threw up and my kids said ''dad these don't look to good'' and I said ''I followed the recipe the way it goes'' oh yeah they smell like butt and garbage

This was easy (had all the ingredients in my pantry) and delicously moist. I took just a couple of pointers about the oil and milk; adding just a little extra. And adding more chocolate chips (because my husband loves them). I kept an eye on them and ended up taking them about a couple minutes before the timer went off (that could have been my oven though).

I made this recipe yesterday and I found the muffins really tasty but not very moist. I did add a whole cup of milk. Next time I'll follow the viewers suggestions, I'll increase the oil to half a cup or I'll use two eggs instead of one. I personnaly don't find the vanilla necessary unless you love your muffins to be really sweet
I did let them cook for a good 20 minutes, I believe for the timing it really depends on your oven. I would check on them after 15min to make sure that they don't burn

They came out flat, tops were too crunchy and they could have been more moist. They also had an overly flour-y taste to them.

TASTE GREAT! Soft and Fluffy texture! Used 1/2 cup oil (instead of 1/3 cup). For me, they stuck to the paper muffin liners...next time I'll just used greased tins.

Just made these and they turned out great!  I did increase the milk to 1 cup and used a bit more then 1/4 c of greek yogurt instead of the oil.  Also used half whole wheat and half white and added vanilla extract to the wet ingredients.  Super easy and super yummy.  Mine were perfectly done at 18 minutes. Gave 4 stars because I did make adjustments to the original recipe.

I made this recipe and it was delicious. I like chocolate so i put more chips in than it called for and i put in a cup of milk. One thing i would change though, is for there to be less to no brown sugar on top. overall this was extremely delicious and i plan on making it again!

I have been making these muffins for my mom's parties and my classmates and they have all loved them. I recently sent them with my sister to give to her class for their snack and they loved them. I added the 1c of milk and a dash more of oil. I also did 1/2c of regular chocolate chips and 1/2c of the minis and they tasted awesome.

This one's a keeper. I doubled the recipe. I used whole wheat flour and added 2 1/2 tbsp of instant coffee. (dissolved in 2 tbsp of water) Im sure it would be just as good without the changes. oh yeah, I did not use the extra sugar on top. It was fine without it. Not too sweet, not bland at all, but just right. Doubling made 36 muffins. (they freeze well also) I will be making this again and again and again.

I don't have fresh milk at home so I used 1/2 cup of evaporated mike and 1/2 cup of water. I also used 1 cup of semi sweet chocolate chips. I sprinkled some coconut flakes on top of the batter instead of sugar toppings. The muffins turn out really yummy.

The muffins were GREAT. But i did make a few changes. I started with the original recipe but it was more like dough rather than batter so i added a bit more milk. I also added an unmeasured amount of vanilla extract. I do agree though, without the chocolate, the muffins were a bit bland.The texture was light and fluffy. If you try this recipe, be sure to make adjustments.

I thought I had made a horrendous mistake by following other peoples advice and adding another 1/4 cup of milk. The batter was thinner than cake batter and I was worried. However after baking them they came out great! I also added a tsp of vanilla and that added some extra flavor. Will be making this again!

This is the best recipe ever because it is so easy. However, I also used 1 cup of milk and when I don't have chocolate chips I use 1 cup of sugar to make the muffins sweet. It is also delicious topped off with cream cheese filling.

This was easy to do and came out perfect. The muffins are nice and fluffy and just the right level of sweetness. I was using a pan for very big muffins (the recipe made 6 of them instead of 12), so I lowered the oven temperature to 350 and baked for about 30 minutes.

I upped the milk to a hair over 1 cup and upped the sugar some as well, I added a little under a half tsp. vanilla and didn't measure the brown and white sugar on top, just sprinkled them. They were very fluffy and moist. I baked them at 350, and they took about 20 min. Delicious!

They were ok... A bit dry and the "glaze" on the top didn't "glaze" just remained sugar. Also, I found there was too much sugar to top them with. I still have some left over. Only added cinnamon (forgot to add vanilla) and baked for approx 18 minutes. Might try again.

As promised, it's easy, quick and good. To make it healthier,I used brown instead of white sugar, 1 cup of non fat milk and a third cup of canola oil. Added a pinch of brown sugar on top of each. Turned out just the way a muffin should. Only issue I had was the bottom of the muffin sticking too much to the liner. Maybe I should add a bit more oil next time?

I tried to make this recipe exactly as written but the batter was way too dry. It was more like the consistency of scone batter so I added more milk and oil. I probably used 1 cup milk. With the added milk and oil, the muffins were still drier than I typically like. The muffins were not very sweet but I liked them that way.

Easy but maybe they were too easy because the taste was lacking. The muffins where dry even though I tried some of the suggestions of other reviewers. Definitely won't be making these again. I am still searching for a good chocolate chip muffin recipe.

Was a little dry becuase they didn't need the full 20 minuets, more like 15. I used 1 1/4 cups of normal sized milk chocolate chips and that helped the dryness. I also had 1 cup of milk insted of 3/4 cups. Over all a great recipe

Yum! Followed the reviews, added more milk, oil and a tad more sugar. Easy to follow, great result. Nice and moist, with a great top. Thanks!

Wanted to make cookies but did not have enough butter so made these instead--delish! Changed as so many suggested---1 cup sugar, 1 cup milk, .5 cup oil, whole bag of regular size milk chocolate chips plus added 4 T brown sugar to dry ingredients instead of sprinkling at end. 18 mins---one dozen

BEST chocolate chip muffin recipe yet! The key to get them very moist and not dry is to take it out earlier than it is fully baked. If you wait until the inside is completely cooked, the rest of the muffin will turn out dry. It is a great morning meal or a pick me up throughout the day. I really liked the brown sugar topping on top, it made it a little more interesting and yummy! :) I will be using this recipe from now on for muffins!

I read the reviews before I made these. I usually make a recipe exactly by the directions the first time, but it seemed unanimous that as-is the recipe was a little dry. So, I added two mashed bananas and a smidge more milk. I also added 1/2 tsp. vanilla as others suggested. These turned out great! My boys loved them, and they're PICKY! Thanks, Janice, for the great recipe. It's a keeper.

These may be better with melted butter in place of the oil, but as is, they're not tasty. And they're rather dry.

Delicious and great, i decreased the amount of milk to 1/2 cup and added 2 tablespoons yoghurt, and used 1 and 1/2 teaspoons baking powder + 1 and 1/2 teaspoons baking soda. My family loved it, thanx for sharing :)

I found this recipe to be ok. Not wonderful. I used the exact mesurements but found at 20 minutes the bottom and side very brown, infact the chocolte chips that had been exposed to the bottom and sides were somewhat burt tasting. Definitely reduce baking time and add more milk and oil next time.

I made the changes suggested by WHITE CHOCOLATE, however I used this recipe to test my new Hello Kitty cupcake maker, so I omitted the topping in order to get a good imprint. I used regular sized semi sweet chocolate chips [they were on hand] and added cinnamon, im glad for the cinnamon, otherwise i think they would have tasted like pancakes..   overall a good recipe.. :]

I changed a few things about this recipe. I sifted the flour for a lighter muffin; I added an additional 1/4 cup of milk because it looked so dry without it. And lastly, due to my particular fondness of brown sugar, I did three tablespoons brown sugar, and only two tablespoons of white sugar to sprinkle on top of the muffins. Next time I may add some vanilla or butter and flour to the sugar mixture to get a crumb topping :)

I did as suggested and upped the milk to a cup.  Forgot to add the vanilla, but will next time.  I put them in for 20 mins, but that was slightly too long...will shorten to 18 minutes next time, but very good anyway.

These did not come out right I took them out at 18min. like some people said and they were very chewy on the inside. I also added 1c. milk, 1c. chips, and some vanilla. They tasted good just had a bad texture.

Very good.  I listened to other reviewers and used 1 c milk and 1 t vanilla.  I also used 1 c regular size chocolate chips.  I didn't bother with the sugar mixture on top and they are still yummy!  I made mini muffins.  It made 45 and it took 15 minutes to bake.

Don't understand all the negative ratings - we loved these muffins!  I followed the recipe exactly except for using canola oil and regular chocolate chips because that is what I had on hand.  Had my doubts when it was all mixed because the batter was really thick but these turned out great!  I got 14 very large muffins and only needed to bake them for 20 minutes.  Next time I may substitute butter for the oil, will add a little more milk and may add a teaspoon of vanilla as suggested by other posters.  Also, will cut the amount of the ingredients for the topping in half because I put a lot on the muffins and still had quite a bit left over.  I will no longer buy boxed muffin mixes because these are so easy and much tastier!

Very good recipe.  Only thing they were a little thick, almost like a pancake constancy.  I had to add butter to serve and they got think and hard after a few days.  But right out of the oven, great!

I was starting to think I was star happy but I think I had just gotten so lucky with the recipes I chose to try, and now I've come accross this one.  I added a little extra sugar and lots of extra chips, but I still don't think it was worth it.  I made banana chocolate chip muffins the other day because I had bananas to use, and my son waited until they were almost gone before he decided he wanted to try one and loved it!  So he asked me to make muffins again.  I noticed this recipe shared one ingredient that I found amazing in the banana muffins (it was the yogurt) but these didn't turn out like those AT ALL!  I probably wont make these anymore.  I'll just wait until I have over-ripe bananas to make the other ones.  These were SO dense, I drank a glass and a half of milk with ONE muffin!  My son (8 yo) even said, "the're 'allright', but not great!"  I didn't share these with anyone because I don't want that on my reputation as "The lady who can cook/bake"

I added 1/4 cup sour cream, as someone else suggested, used regular chocolate chips, and didn't use the sugar/brown sugar topping.  They turned out beautifully, but there was a flavor that seemed to be missing.  Perhaps adding 1/2 tsp or 1 1/2 tsp vanilla would've helped, I'll try that next time.  The muffins turned out light and fluffy and I got all thumbs up from my kids and little nephews this morning.  My nephews said "you're a great baker, Auntie!"  I'll take that ANY day!!  Thanks for sharing your recipe.  I will make them again, just maybe with some vanilla next time.

Pretty good, but not the best, I didnt add the sugar topping and i found the muffins were crunchy on the outside and very moist on the inside. I prefer this because it tastes less sweet which makes it like a breakfast muffin. I also added almost a cup of milk and a little bit most vegtable oil.

This was a good recipe, but I had to make some changes to make it better... I used 3/4 cup of light brown sugar instead of white, used 1 cup of skim milk, 3/4 cup canola oil, added 1 tsp vanilla extract, baking soda, an extra egg, some buttermilk (powder), and a full cup of dark chocolate chunks (which ended up in the bottom of the muffin so I wouldn't recommend using them for this recipe). I also replaced the glaze with melted dark chocolate and poured some on top of every muffin because they still weren't chocolatey enough and decorated them with nonpareils. I also changed the cooking time to 15 minutes. Everyone in my family enjoyed them and the 18 muffins I made were gone before the next morning. Thanks!

I was craving some muffins and had all these ingredients on hand and looked so easy.  I was a little disappointed in the result.  After reading some reviews, I used a full cup of milk and also about 1/4 cup of sour cream.  The taste and texture turned out ok.  The only thing I had an issue with was the cook time.  400 degrees seemed high to me so I only cooked for 20 min, even then my muffins came out dark and the tops were pretty hard.  Totally overcooked.  I prob should've taken it out 3-5 min earlier.  Ended up throwing most of it out as my kids didn't like them.

We found these muffins to be very tasty - a nice change from banana or pumpkin muffins which I make all the time.  I did follow the advice of other reviewers & upped the sugar to 3/4 cup, milk to a cup , oil to 1/2 cup, choc chips to a cup & added tsp vanilla.  They do have an odd consistency biscuit-like as others pointed out.  But all in all they are very good.  May add some peanut butter chips in next time.

There are never any of these muffins left by the second day!  My kids and husband love these muffins.  I tried them with big chocolate chips last time, and my hubby said they are better with the mini chips.  The things I change, as suggested by other, are a full cup of sugar, a full cup of milk, a full cup of chocolate chips, and add a tsp of vanilla.  I also change the oil to applesauce and increase it to 1/2 cup.  This can make the muffins stick to the cup lines, so I use cooking spray on the muffin cup liners.  Thanks for the reviews, they helped me make a wonderful muffin!

The pre-made kind you just add water to makes better muffins than this recipe. I took the advice of other reviewers and added more milk and oil, and while it may have made the muffins more moist, it couldn't improve the doughy, bland flavor. I'll look for a different recipe next time.

Dry as heck muffins. Looks good, tastes like cardboard. Needs at least 2x the amt of oil.

Really good, fast, easy.  Made exactly according to the directions, only doubling it.  Wound up with 17 muffins.  Don't skimp on the brown sugar/sugar topping - it really makes these better.

Quick and easy.  I followed the recommendations.  Increased to 1 cup milk, 1 cup chocolate chips, 2/3 cup vegetable oil and decreased bake time to 18 minutes.  Moist and tasty.

This is a great recipe. I took the advice of some other commenters and ended up adding 1 cup of milk, 1 cup of chocolate chips, 2 spoonfulls of sour cream, with just brown sugar on the top and I cooked them for 18 minutes. They were perfection! A little crunchy on the top, soft and moist in the middle. I loved them!

eh. I'm not sure if I made a mistake or not, but the batter came out like dough and I thought that was weird since every box mix of muffins I've ever made was pourable. these came out bad.

This recipe is not good as is.  It needs modifications.  With modifications I would say it is a 4 star recipe.  My changes: 1 c milk, butter vs oil, add 1/2 tsp of baking soda, 1 c chocolate chips, add 6 oz of either plain or vanilla yogurt.  With these changes, the muffin was lighter and not as dense which I'm fine with.  It was also more moist.  I still feel like it's missing something and I'm not quite sure what it is, but it was tasty enough after my modifications that my husband and I went back for seconds. lol

I made this recipe EXACTLY as is so I can review it honestly and fairly.  I found these to be on the dry side and lacking in flavor.   My kids both liked them so I will try them again and add a a little sour cream as another reviewer did and also some vanilla.  I thought there was way too much sugar topping as well.

Amazing recipe!! I cooked them for 18 minutes and they turned out moist and fuffy. We made zero changes and they turned out great! Tastes AMAZING warm and right out of the oven. I would definately make this recipe again and recommend it.

I read through the reviews before making these muffins and I'm glad I did. I increased the milk to a full cup (and I also used buttermilk) and I added one teaspoon of vanilla. I did use whole wheat white flour in this recipe. These were easy enough and the kids thought chocolate chip muffins were great but my husband remarked that it needs more of the chocolate chips. He thought using the mini chips was a great idea, it just needs more. I'm really glad I added more liquid because if I hadn't, these would have been really dry. Mine weren't really dry but they weren't moist, either. Good recipe, but needs a little tweaking.

These were excellent. I made a few small changes. I upped the milk and chocolate chips to a full cup and added 1/3 cup sour cream. When I went to get an egg, I realized I didn't have any and I didn't have any applesauce to substitute either so I used apple butter. They really turned out well.

I made 6 jumbo muffins out of this recipe and it turned out great.  I used 1 cup of milk, and 3/4 cup semisweet and bittersweet chocolate cut in small pieces.  Reduced temp to 375 degrees and cooked them for about 22 minutes.  Yum!  I loved them, kids loved them, and I will make them again for sure!

I thought I screwed them up because the batter was so thick.  While I could add more milk etc my hubby loved them so much I'll keep them the way they are

I became a member just to rate this recipe! These are very yummy, and I didn't really think they would compare to a chocolate chip cookie, but they do. Instead of milk I used vanilla soy milk (a friend of mine left it at the house so I thought I'd try it instead of wasting it) and you would never know. I also put 1/2 whole wheat flour. It looked and smelled like cookie dough when I mixed it (except of course, it wasn't as thick as cookie dough). And it tasted like a big warm, soft, cookie fresh from the oven. It was just an added bonus that it had whole wheat and soy milk. It tastes amazing. It worked so well, I am considering buying the Vanilla soy milk just to keep the fat and cholesterol down every time I make this!

delicious!  I substituted 1/2 vanilla yogurt for milk & 1/2 oat flour (oats in a bender), upped the milk/yogurt to 1 cup as others recommended, and doubled the recipe- my teens & their friends ate them all in 1 day!

Followed the recipe to the letter.  I didn't like the taste of these at all. I thought it might have been me so I let my kids try them and they didn't like them much either.

This was the best homemade recipe I've found, but for some reason, I still don't think they're as good as Martha White in a bag.  I used 1 cup milk, 1/4 cup oil, and added vanilla.  Adding all the extra liquid made the mix too runny so all the chocolate chips sank to the bottom.  Next time, I'll likely make the recipe as written - hopefully they'll still be as moist!

I have tried many chocolate chip muffin recipes and none of them turned out as good as these.  I like that there isn't any butter in them as a lot of recipes call for.  Very good taste, I made the recipe exactly and added vanilla.  Have already made these a couple of times.  I must fill the cups a bit fuller because both times I made them it only yielded 9 muffins.

I should have read the reviews before making these. Dry, bland and crumbly, they were more like scones than muffins.  I did add some vanilla, but that didn't help the flavour much. Even the kids didn't really like them much and just picked out the chocolate chips.

I gave 5 stars based on the previous suggestions of using a full cup of milk. I also used a full cup of chocolate chips. This was the best chocolate chip muffin I've ever made, and I will only use this (slightly modified) recipe from now on.

four stars because i cannot imagine this recipe without the changes suggested, including more milk and sugar, and adding vanilla -- how can you not add a teaspoon of vanilla? i suggest mini chocolate chips so that they don't sink. with changes, these were gone in a heartbeat.

These muffins are awesome!  I increased the sugar to 3/4 cup, vegetable oil to 1/2 cup, and the chocolate chips to 1 c.  I found this to make 18 standard-sized muffins.  This muffin recipe is so good it is going to be my go-to recipe from now on.  I am going to experiment, modifying it to use fruit.  I have been so disappointed with muffin recipes lately and this one was everything.  PERFECTION doesn't come around often, but this recipe fits that description.  Thank you very much for sharing this recipe.  The muffins go so fast that I've taken to hiding a portion. *grin*

Great muffins..BUT! I added one cup of milk, 2 tablespoons of hersheys unsweetened cocoa, 1 teasponn of vanilla and 1/3 cup of sugar ( I try use to use less sugar in everything). I also added almost 3/4 semi-sweet choco chips and cooked them at 400 degrees for 16-17 minutes. Any longer and they would burn. They came out great! not too sweet as the chocolate cocoa and chips really gave it flavor! I didn't top it off with sugar as it's way too much sugar for me...use more cocoa for a darker look:)

I made these muffins this morning upon my daughters request for her birthday breakfast. They were delicious. I took the advice of others and used 1 cup of milk and the 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract. I couldn't imagine the muffins without those two changes. Yummy in the tummy!

I'm glad I read the reviews before I made this. It definitely requires alteration because for a second there I thought I was making cookies because the batter was quite dry.    I used 1 cup of butter milk, 1 cup of choc chips (I would add more next time), Vanilla essence & 1/2 a cup of canola oil.    Once cooled down they were sweet enough and moistness was just right. Baked them for around 20 minutes. The sugar at the top was a nice crunchy addition. I would definitely add up to 1.5 cups of choc chips next time because I found it to be quite barren.

I just made these choc. muffins for me and my son (3).  I added 1 cup of milk versus the 3/4.  I added 1/2TSP vanilla, like others said.  It filled the cups more than 2/3 full, but it was fine.  I baked 22 mins and they were a titch over done, but still very tasty.  I only used 1/2 of the sugar topping mix otherwise it would have been overkill.  YUMMMMY!!

This is a great recipe!  I followed others suggestions and changed it to 1 cup milk, 1/2 cup oil, and added 1 tsp. vanilla.  I love the sugar top, which gives it a cookie feel.  I think it would be good without the sugar topping, if you're wanting to cut down on the sugar content.

Followed the instruction to the very last detail, I think they are still not moist enough but really great starter base recipe. I will try this again and I will let every one know. FYI.. You must spray the bottom of the baking cupcake cups. I didnt do this and it cause the cupcakes to burn a bit.

It a very, fast, easy recipe. I did add 1/4 cup of sour cream to help to keep them moist. and 2 tsp of vanilla. They tasted kinda bland fresh out of the oven. but when cooled they were just okay. The topping helped alot.

I always try out a recipe as written before making any changes. This recipe was EXACTALLY what I was looking for in taste. I used Givalia (sp?) Chocolate chips and YUM!!! They were definately too dry though so I will tweak the recipe for more moisture, otherwise though, PERFECT!

The best recipe I've tried!!! I added 1/2 cup sour cream, 1 tsp vanilla and used regular chocolate chips. I also tried it with fresh blueberries and it was also great!! My husband and all of my girls LOVED them!! Very moist and fluffy!!! I will use this as my muffin recipe from now on!

This recipe was bland to me, even with the addiction of sour cream and vanilla, as other reviewers suggested. The muffins were still dry and not at all what i was hoping for. Sorry, but i wont be making this one again.

Added 1/2 cup sour cream to make them moist. Used chocolate chunks instead of mini chips because it's what I had on hand. Didn't put the sugar on as topping. They were great and my kids loved them.

These were a bit bland. It is probably a good base recipe, but by itself they are not impressive. Perhaps more sugar and vanilla would be nice.

I had a baking bug this morning and had all the ingredients around my kitchen.  With a few changes as per suggestions, these came out fantastic!!!  And I almost never say that about my homemade muffins... I changed the milk to 1 cup, added 1/2 tsp vanilla and a 3.75 oz pkg of cream cheese fruit dip. I baked for 20 minutes and they came out fluffy, super super moist on the inside and crunchy on the outside.  Just like I like em!  Great recipe base, could have been a 5 but I didn't try it without my additions first.

Very good recipe!  These sort of reminded me of scones, b/c the batter wasnt' very sweet, but the chocolate chips made up for it.  My picky daughter (who only eats the premade mix kind) loved them.  Will keep this recipe!

These were good.  I made them for my quiting-smoking sweetie.  They came out of the oven during prime-time TV and were gone by morning.    I only gave them 3 stars because of the various adjustments I made to the recipe after reading the reviews.  I threw in the sour cream, increased the chocolate chips, and generally fiddled with the quantities.

hummm...i'm not 100% sold on these.  i made exact changes that "White Chocolate" mentioned in his/her review.  i think i over cooked them at 20 minutes....plus, my chips all floated to the bottom.  i think i will add less milk next time to see if that helps.  They were moist and tasted good...just not exactly how i had hoped.

5 Stars! Easy,Fast and Delicious! I did increase the milk to 1 cup. I didn't have any mini chocolate chips. I use regular size "Milk" Chocolate chips. The results were awsome! The topping is the perfect compliment for these muffins.Yum!

awsome muffins, never made muffins from scratch before and they turned out really well. They are even better with a little mixed fruit rather than chocolate chips. we did add a little vanilla and some sour cream just like the other reviewers suggested. YUMMY!!!!!!!!

Wow!  An incredibly bland muffin...not even the chocolate could save them.  Needs something more.  I'm thinking brown sugar and a TON of vanilla.  Not worth making again.

Yummy muffins! I added extra chocolate chips and extra sugar to the tops. Probably could have used some vanilla but I was all out anyway and still delicious.

This came out more like scone-like muffins. I used 1 cup of AP flour and 1 cup of ww flour. I also used 1 cup of milk as suggested by reviewers ( I used soy milk).  Added 1 cup of regular size semi sweet chocolate chips.  I think what really boosted the flavor was adding 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon.  We love the combination of cinnamon and chocolate.  They may be the ingredient missing for some reviewers.

These were good fresh the 1st day but they got pretty hard and dense after that. I followed some tips from others and added sour cream but still not my favorite.

I loved this recipe.  I made a few modifications.  I added 1 cup milk, 1/2 tsp vanilla, only 1/2 cup of chocolate chips (which was more than enough). Instead of 1/3 cup oil, I added 1/4 cup oil and the remainder I filled with applesauce to make the 1/3 cup of oil required in the recipe.  I thought they were delicious and I didn't even notice the small amount of applesauce I added, so next time I might try to add more and then less of the oil.  I didn't even add the topping and thought they were perfect!

These were GREAT!  I did add one cup of milk and a little extra oil... following other reviewer's advice.  They were SO good!  They were best right out of the oven but they froze well and we enjoyed them with  company on morning.  Yummy!  I totally recommend.  They make more like 1 1/2 dozen.

*****  I did not have skim milk (or any milk left!) so I used Carnation Instant Milk & the recipe still worked really good.  *****  
These are SO good.  I made them yesterday and again this morning.

Made a few changes, like others, and these came out incredibly good, with a dense, coffee-shop muffin texture and a delicious taste. Very moist, too. Made 16 medium sized muffins.

For the flour, used 1 cup all purpose and 1 cup whole wheat, plus 1/4 cup wheat germ. Used 1/2 cup dark brown sugar instead of white (extra moisture and more flavor). Instead of milk (I always bake non-dairy for allergy and kosher reasons), I used 1/2 cup chocolate soy milk and 3/4 cup regular soymilk. Used 2 eggs and only 1/4 cup canola oil, and added 2 tsp vanilla extract and about 1 and 1/2 tsp cinnamon. And about a cup of regular non-dairy chocolate chips. My husband isn't usually a big muffin fan, and he couldn't stop raving about this one. And the sugar topping was a nice addition, though it really didn't need any more sweetness. Baked for 19 minutes at 200 Celsius, middle rack.

Too bland... I used 1 cup of milk and a little vanilla extract. Only baked for 18 min as recommended. Didn't put the topping on. Maybe it needs more chocolate chips... It was very moist though...

Based on other reviews, I made some changes.  I used 1c milk, 2 eggs, 1/2c sour cream and 1 Tbsp vanilla.  This made the batter a little too loose, so I tossed the chocolate chips with an extra 1/c flour before stirring them into the batter. I got 18 regular sized muffins from this amount of batter.   I baked them for exactly 20 minutes and they were perfect.  They rose beautifully and were lightly brown and crispy on top.  Moist and delicious inside.  I only gave the recipe 4 stars since I made so many changes.

I added the extra milk as suggested and some vanilla. Followed the rest of the recipe as written. My dough was thick and sticky .... I had a bad feeling about it. The muffins are chewy and have no flavour. Not sure I'll try it again. Sorry. =(

These were pretty awesome, considering the changes I made to them. I was making these for my cross country team, and so I doubled the recipe, and I used 1 cup of protein powder and 3 cups of flour. Also, we had no oil so I used an equal amount of plain fat free yogurt, which worked out pretty well. Then, because I'm not really used to using protein powder and I didn't want it to taste weird, I added one lemon's worth of zest and some orange juice, and they tasted good. Also, I didn't have enough chocolate chips, but with the background flavor I didn't really have anything to complain about.

I love this recipe so much that it has become my staple muffin recipe. I like the fact that I always have all the ingredients on hand to whip up a batch!
The only changes that I make is that I don't add the additional sugar on top. I find the sweetness just perfect without adding anymore. I also love to add some nuts and raisins into the batter. Mmmm mmmm!
Thanks so much for this recipe that will definitely be used over and over again!

I made these for my Boyfriend who won't eat my healthy muffins. He thought they were great.And he's very fussy.I took other reviewers suggestions. I used a full cup of milk and a full cup of regular chocolate chips. Turned out great. I did also add a bit of vanilla.

These were a big hit at my house, and I have already made them twice.  I did as many others suggested, adding 1/4 cup of sour cream and 1 1/2 tsp. of vanilla to the recipe.  I plan to make this again, substituting other ingredients for the chocolate chips - it's a good basic muffin recipe.

These were good! Although like some other reviewers; I thought they was missing a little something. Next time I would definately add some vanilla. Apart from that, I thought they were very good; I really like the sprinkling of sugar on top! Thanks for the recipe!

Thought this recipe was very good.  I did follow advice and use one cup of milk, and added a teaspoon vanilla.  My daughter used this recipe for a science experiment (yes, the original owner of recipe received full credit).  We tested five different kinds of flour.  All baked well and was edible, although some tasted better than others.  I think the whole family enjoyed this muffin.  Try it!

i really liked these! as usual, i got tempted 2 put more than just choco. chips in 'em: i put butterscotch & rainbow as well. (i REALLY like the effect of rainbow chips-so nice & colorful) i also luv the idea of the crusty top from putting the sugar on before baking-i like toppings like that sometimes. (i actually used that idea for the "sugar-coated muffins" as well. -the sugar is actually supposed to go on after coming out of oven, but i put it on before, & got that yummy crusty result that i learned from this recipe.) definitely not the only time id make these!

We love this recipe! My four year old daughter and I made them today. We did use 1 cup of milk instead of 3/4 cup, as suggested by other reviewers. We also added the topping, which we feel the muffins definitely needed to make them sweet and yummy. These are just tasty all around! And we did use half of the oil, not all of the 1/3 cup it calls for, as I see some other reviewers left the oil out all together. We will make these muffins again!

I added extra milk like recommended by others. They turned out great and were best when warm. However, after a day or two they were rock hard, but made good scones with tea. Especially since they weren't over sweet (I left off the topping). I might try them again.

My 3-year old daughter wanted to help fix breakfast this morning, but I didn't have any prepackaged mixes on hand. I chose this recipe because it used ingredients I had on hand, seemed quick, and had a high rating after many reviews.

I followed the advice of previous reviews and increased the milk to 1 cup. I kept everything else the same, except I used mini-muffin cups. Baking at 400 degrees for 10 minutes yielded perfect results.

My entire family enjoyed this breakfast treat. The muffins were soft and sweet!

One thing I would note: several people mentioned leaving off the topping. I think that the batter would not have been sweet enough on its own. I was tempted to add sugar after tasting it, but didn't. The sugar topping remedied this in the final product. If you plan to leave the topping off, I would add a little sugar to the batter. If you add sugar and use the topping, you'll probably find it too sweet.

Thanks for a quick and easy recipe!

Substituted white chocolate chips + 1/4c dried cranberries.  Also used 1c milk instead of 3/4, and a little more oil (as suggested by someone else).

I thought these muffins were fairly tasty, but the sugar topping was a little weird, to my palate. I might've liked them better without it, like another reviewer mentioned. They didn't rise very much, though, I didn't think, and were a bit flatter and denser than they might have been; not the light-and-fluffy kind of muffins. They were also a little dry. Not too sweet either. Just okay, in my book, but I did make a batch for my neighbors, too, and they told me they liked them (maybe just being polite, though!).
I did make them exactly as described, with no alterations. I suppose that a lot of the other reviewers were correct to make some changes to this recipe.

I made the following changes based on other reviews: 1 c. sugar, 1 c. milk and 1 c. chips. The muffins were done at 15 minutes using a standard muffin pan. The batch made 18 muffins. The taste was only average for the amount of effort/changes involved. Next time I'll use a box of Duncan Hines or Betty Crocker Choc. Chip Muffins for the same taste and less work. Thanks anyway.

The muffins were a little denser than I was hoping for, but they were still good. 

I had a bit of extra batter, so I added a little shredded coconut and a touch of coconut extract. Very very delicious, and worth a shot if you like light coconut and chocolate together.

These muffins come out very dry. You would have to load the centers of the muffins with enough chocolate chips to offset the dryness. But the recipe was quick and easy to follow.

These were good, but not great.  I was looking for something more moist, I think.  Still, everyone here seems to like them, and they were incredibly easy to make, so I will likely be making these again.

When I mixed the dry & liquid ingredients together it wasn't a batter, but rather a dough.  We found the texture dry, and the combined flavours of the bland, biscuity muffin and sweet chocolate not very good.

These muffins tasted awesome. The sweetness of the muffin came from the sugar topping. The muffins weren't sweet enough so next time I will add a tad bit more sugar. Besides that, they tasted really good.

This recipe is a little light on the sugar to satisfy my sugar cravings.  Next time I will use 3/4 cup.  DON'T forget the sugar topping!

very good. I especially like the sugars sprinkled on top.  I multiplied the recipe to yeild 18muffins and the batter was way too dry - I had to add more milk, but they ended up quite tasty anyway.

These were great muffins for a toddler.  My daughter loves them.  They are simple, light and the chocolate chips really stand out.  I did make some modifications: 1/2 c. sugar, 1/2 c. Splenda, 1 c. milk, 1/2 c. oil.  For the topping, I crushed three graham crackers, spooned in one heaping wooden spoon of brown sugar and about 1 T. melted butter.  I mixed it by hand until crumbly and all moist then put on top.  Very good.

I made these this weekend, my husband and two year old could not get enough!  I did add 1 cup of sugar, 1 cup of chips, 1 cup of milk and 1 tsp vanilla (advise from previous messages).  They turned out great.  I will definately be making these again.

Very good but 20 minutes was a little too long for my oven. I'd say it's more like 15-18 minutes.

Like some of the other bakers, I used 1 cup of milk and added some vanilla and apple juice as one other, I also added 1 1/2 cups fresh cherries.   I did need to increase the bake time to about 27-28 minutes but the moisture was just right due to the cherries and apple juice.  They were very yummy!!

I also put 1 C of milk in. I increased the oil a little. I added almost a cup of sugar. I also used a full cup of chips. They came out awesome. Don't overbake though. Oh and I recommend using course sugar for the topping.

I definitely added more milk- but I was disappointed with the taste of the actual batter. Very bland, I taste predominantly flour. It needs to be sweeter and stickier. If I make these again I'll probably use applesauce.

By skiping the glazing or frosting of Brown and white sugar, and adding a cup of coconut flower, another 1/2 cup milk and a table spoon of instant cacao you can make these even better.

Did not come up in a nice "muffin" shape which is kind of a disapointment.  But the taste was great, and it was easy to make.  
It only took 30 minutes to cook, which is not too long, but long enough.

 3/4 cup of milk to 1 cup.

Yesterday I tried the chocolate chip muffin recipe, I found it easy to make, and quick,the only thing I found was that it was too dry as if there was not enough liquid or too much dry ingredients other than that they looked great especially with the sugar topping.
Any suggestions on where I might have gone wrong or what I can do to make them a bit more moist would be appreciated.
Thank you

Feedback: 
This recipe was the first time I made muffins from scratch.  Came out good, and I made a few personalizations.
My hubby, teen and 10yr old liked them, and had a few!
My Bosch oven gets very hot at 400 degrees F.  
I baked for 18 minutes, but muffins were a bit crispy on top.
I will decrease baking to 16 minutes next time to see difference.
Muffins were soft and yummy on inside.

If you follow this recipe as written, you will have lousy muffins.  I think the only reason it rated so well is that nearly everyone is changing it.  The ingredients listed will make a very dry muffin.  The baking time will burn them.  I followed the many suggestions to increase the milk and oil and add vanilla extract.  I also baked them for 15 minutes instead of what’s listed.  They turned out just ok.  I’ve had such great results from all the highly rated All Recipes recipes that I’ve tried, that I was expecting a really delicious muffin.  They were a bit on the dry side still and just not much flavor.  Great for dunking in coffee but that’s about it. With the changes suggested, they are a solid 3 stars.  But as written it’s barely a 1 star.  I think recipes should be rated based on how they are written.

Followed this recipe exactly and ended up with batter as thick as cookie dough. Had to add another 3/4 cup of milk to get it to a point that it could be spooned into a muffin tin. I read some of the top reviews, and they all mention adding more wet ingredients than it calls for. If your recipe has to be adjusted that much to work, it's not a good recipe.

Love these muffins, easy to make and delicious! I didn’t have mini chocolate chips on hand  so I substituted regular sized semi-sweet morsels !

I creamed the sugar with the wet ingredients then added the dry ingredients in my KItchenAid.  I adjusted the following ingredients to 1 cup  of milk, 1/3 cup oil, 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla, and 1/2 teaspoon of  salt, and  3/4 cup of chocolates plus a few.  I baked for 18 minutes.

I didn't quite care for THIS PARTICULAR Chocolate Chip muffin recipe. Upon preparing, things seemed "ok," but as a very experienced cook AND pretty darn good baker, I was disappointed with how "dense" and dry this recipe was and it also wasn't too sweet. Mind you, muffins don't have to be SO terribly sweet they are almost sickening. However, these were bland. Even with the chips. 
If I had to rate them on a scale of one to ten, ten being super delicious, I'd give them a two. 
They "looked" okay. But I wanted to bite into them and taste the goodness. I thought the ingredients, while simple, weren't "enough" in volume for the moisture and flavor these "dry mounds" needed. 
MY suggestions would be to add at least A HALF CUP of OIL, One Tsp of Vanilla Extract. In addition, approximately 1/3 cup MORE of milk (that, could be added in a bit at a time, but should be fine). In addition, being these are Chocolate Chip Muffins, more are needed; about 1/2 cup more, at least. You can also add a bit of grated orange zest, for a tasty addition (up to 2 tsp). Combine all the ingredients as directed. Watch time in oven. Don't overbake.

These were very very dry and crumbly. I should have read the reviews first and added more liquids and vanilla. Maybe some sour cream to make them moist.

Muffins came out dry and although they had flavor, they tasted a bit like too much flour. Next time I make this I will add more milk and oil. Hopefully those are better! 

Side note and unrelated to my review: I thought I’d split the batter and do half with blueberries instead. Turned out awful. Don’t do that lol. Stick with the chips.

I followed it as is minus the sugar topping. They are delicious, but, something might be missing. 5 stars because these are good, just missing something. A bit dry.

These turned out great! After reading reviews, I added 1/4 cup sour cream,1 tsp cinnamon, and 1 tsp vanilla. Next time I’ll up the sour cream to 1/2 cup for more moisture and possibly the vanilla. Super easy and they came together fast for a quick breakfast treat.

These came out great! I took the advice of others and increased the  oil to 1/2 cup, milk to 1 cup, chocolate chips to 1 cup and had to use cream of tartar + baking soda as a substitute for baking powder since I was out of it. I also sprinkled chocolate chips on top along with the sugar mixture. I did not use all of the sugar mixture. Glad I didn’t because they were a little sticky on top but they looked bakery made!!!  I will definitely make these again. Thanks for the recipe.

Didn't have any mini-chips, so chopped up a dark chocolate orange/ginger bar—close to the 3/4 cup. Added 1/4 tsp fresh-grated nutmeg.  Added a tsp or two of oat bran & wheat germ (probably not my greatest mod). Did not use all of the sugar/brown sugar topping. Very tasty and I will make them again.

I followed the recipe but did as some others suggested by adding 2 eggs, 1 cup of milk, and a tsp. of vanilla extract. You only need half the topping that it calls for. They were good but if I made them again I would add maybe a tablespoon or 2 more of sugar. They weren’t sweet enough which kind of surprised me.

The first time I made this exactly as written.   They were very hard and dense. The batter was thick and they looked the same coming out of the oven as going in, if a bit browner.  The second time I made it and made some changes based on other’s reviews. I added 1/2 c of oil and 1 c of milk.  They were much better but still not the light fluffy muffins I was hoping for.  Given the flavor they do have potential though.

Good solid recipe.  I also upped the milk to 1 cup and added 2 tsp of vanilla and they turned out great.  Be sure not to overtake these, mine took only 18 minutes.

I tend to follow these recipes exactly so that I can provide an accurate review. They came out on the dry side. Just like another comment, I usually cream the sugar with the wet ingredients. I will try this out again, but with my modifications. Stay tuned!

I literally made an account just to rate these muffins. The recipe when made exactly as described are terrible! Very dense and soooooo dry. I couldn't even eat them, and this is coming from someone who really isn't that picky with desserts. Of course i made them before I read the reviews and definitely learned my lesson. I also don't think people should be giving good reviews if they are changing the recipe because thats not technically a review for the exact recipe.

I don’t know why people change so many things in a recipe, then give it 5 stars. I made the recipe as follows, and muffins were very dry. Next time I will do as suggested and use 1c, milk, 1/4c oil, and 2 eggs.

Good recipe....I added 1/2 cup sour cream, 1 tsp vanilla, increased the oil by a couple TBSP and used 3/4 cup mini chocolate chips. I think because of these alterations, next time I will increase the salt to 1 tsp.  Light and fluffy muffin though! I will make it again!

This is a mini muffin ideal recipe as-is! 

Followed the recipe as is, did one batch cupcake and another mini muffin. This muffin recipe is perfect for mini muffins, without alterations, the muffins have the expected pockets of air, they rise to the ideal size. 
The dough is heavy for a larger size muffin (cupcake or bigger), that’s why amounts of liquids need to increase.

These were so good!!! I followed some recomendations from other reviews and added 1 cup of milk instead of 3/4 and added 1 tsp of vanilla extract. They took about 18 minutes and were a perfect baking project for myself and my 2 and 4 year old.

I liked this recipe. I like the idea for increasing the milk. They were a little dry, so next time I make them, I will use 1 cup of milk.

I read some reviews before I made these so I went with some of the popular substitutions. I used 1 cup of milk, 1/2 cup of oil, 1 cup of sugar, a teaspoon of vanilla extract, and a little over 1 cup of regular chocolate chips (because we love chocolate and I was out of mini chips).  With the alterations, I had enough to make 18 muffins, which I cooked for 20 minutes.  They taste delicious, my only complaint is all the chips sunk to the bottom. I don’t know if that would happen with mini chips. Either way, they’re a hit in my house and I will be making them again, hopefully with the right chips!

So far they are coming out good. Will update after they come out of the oven.
~Update~
Turned out great. ??
Would use tsp instead of tbs on sugar topping next time.
Made 18 instead of 12. ??

I would make this again. I didn't think it was okay, I didn't love it, I liked it. It was very yummy but I think there was a little too much baking powder. I cooked the muffins 23 minutes and the top of the muffins were kind of hard. I don't know if I cooked it to long though.  The inside of the muffins, were moist and delicious. Just the top of the muffins were the problem. I would definitely make this again though.  Delicious!

I upped it to 1 cup of regular-sized chips and 1 cup of milk. 
I mixed the liquids, sugar, and eggs in my KitchenAid, and the powdered ingredients in a separate bowl, then combined. Stir in the chips by hand. I skipped the topping. Maybe next time? Made these for CC catering at the pool and they were at hit!

I made the recipe the way it was written. Everyone loved them. I liked them but it’s still not what I am looking for in a chocolate chip muffin. I am looking for a recipe that tastes similar to ones you get from Tim Hortons, Dunkin Donuts or grocery stores.

I substituted melted coconut oil for vegetable oil! They turned out amazing! I was skeptical at first because the batter wasn’t like most muffin consistency’s. It was in between cake and cookie batter. The muffins turned out really good with a subtle hint of coconut.

I followed the recipe and made no changes for a change.My grandchildren didn't like them at all I tried them and it seems that something is missing to me.
I may try them again as this would be a good starting point and make some changes to them I would like a little more flavor to the batter.

I had to use canola oil instead of veggie oil because thats What I had :). I also added the chocolate chips at the end. My 5 year old helped me make these yummy muffins. My kids love them and i will be making them again.

Very fluffy and tasty. Fell apart kind of easily, but not a problem if you have a fork. Not a ton of flavor but I'd say they're more of a breakfast recipe than a dessert one.

This recipe was a very kid- friendly cooking project. We ended up changing some ingredients; we used Stevia instead of white sugar and coconut flakes as a topping. We skipped the brown sugar step, and we used one cup of milk. We had so much fun making these tasty muffins.

Not the best. My family did not like it. We still have muffins from last week and there is 8 of us and I made 16 (So we can both have 2) if you really want a good recipe go to tasty. But this one is not so bad just not for family. If you add vanilla it tastes better. And if you add brown sugar.

I did what others said and added a full cup of milk. I also added 2 tablespoons brown sugar and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract. I used canola oil instead of vegetable oil. They puffed up nicely in the oven, they tasted ok nothing special.

I left the sugar topping off, so that may be why they seemed a little dry and not as sweet as I expected. Overall a good recipe though.

I read the reviews and changed to 1 cup of milk.  My kids love them. Oh, and I think the second time I made this, I put some vanilla in there.

I tripled this recipe to make 36, although I could’ve stretched it to 40 - several of my muffin cups were very full. I heeded many reviewers’ advice to increase the milk and add vanilla, especially since I was making such a large batch. For fun, I added a couple dashes of cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg (I usually do this with my muffins and quick breads). I almost never fiddle with muffin toppings or streusels, but I decided to do the brown sugar/sugar topping and am glad I did. It gave the muffins a nice look and was hardly any effort at all. The kiddo tasted one this morning and gave it rave reviews - said it tasted like cinnamon roll chocolate chip heaven.

Overall, it was a bit dry but good. I would probably make it again but with less flour. The color was not like in the picture, it looked it golden with ridges.

I agree with other reviewers who added extra milk, but I used a combo of milk and yogurt. I also agree that 2 eggs will produce a nicer texture, I added a splash of vanilla, and used half white whole wheat flour,  half unbleached white flour. With  those modifications, I was happy with the results, but I will probably keep tinkering with the recipe.

Followed fellow bakers and increased milk to a cup, added 1/3 cup sour cream, added 2 tsp vanilla, increased chips to a cup.  I would omit brown sugar on top, doesn't do anything to the muffin at all

Just ok. When the recipe  said to fill cups with batter... I didn’t expect a cookie dough  consistency. 
I followed the directions to a T and having never made muffins from scratch,  didn’t really know what it should be like. I wish I had read the reviews first and changed it up with more milk, etc. 
will look for a better tasting recipe.

The muffins turned out all right, although they just seemed to me a little bland, kind of like only the chocolate chips gave them flavour. I did listen to some of the other reviews and used 1 cup of milk and 1/3 of oil, and this seemed to work out well. The only problem I had was with the flavour... don't think I will use this particular recipe again but it's a good base recipe if you know of other ingredients to add to it that will make it a bit more tasteful

I tried first batch with 1 cupof milk and that was too much. The second batch with 3/4 cup and had to add a little more.! Both batches were great tasting. Obviously my measuring skills! The sugar topping topped it off!

Ok, I substituted milk for almond milk, and used the amount it called for. I also doubled the recipe. I had to use an extra cup of almond milk because the batter was dry and extremely lumpy, almost like biscuit dough. When we tasted them, they were bland, and tasted more like biscuits or pancake muffins. They were also too heavy and stuck to the muffin paper. We would have had to scrape the stuck muffin off with our teeth as well. Otherwise the muffin that got stuck would've gone to waste. I consider this recipe not so good. I definitely won't be using it again.

This is an easy and simple recipe. It came out great! I wasn't sure about adding the sugar mixture on top, but it does add a nice sweetness to the muffin. My family loved it! I wouldn't change a thing.

I modified it a bit.  I used half whole wheat and half ap flour, 1 cup of milk, 2 eggs, and I added vanilla and cinnamon.  I also did half a bag of mini chocolate chips and no added sugar on top.  Baked them at 350 for 20 minutes and they were perfect. My girls loved it!

These were just OK in  my opinion.  Good, tender crumb, but even with the addition of vanilla (and extra chocolate chips!), it needs something to amp up the flavour.

These muffins were AMAZING! I made them for my wonderful neighbor across the street because he helped us by snow plowing our driveway last week so we did his today, and wanted to help out even more by making him some muffins. He sent the box back 3 hours after we dropped the muffins off, he came back with the container and said they were delicious so  I made 3 more batches. :) Thank you to the person that came up with this recipe it is awesome!

I enjoyed this recipe, but the second time I made it I added 1 cup of milk instead of 3/4. I also put 3/4 cup of sugar instead of 1/2 cup. I added a 3.9 oz package of Chocolate Instant Pudding. You could totally add a package of vanilla pudding instead to make them supper moist and yummy. Overall, good recipe.

I followed advice and increased milk to one cup. Added vanilla, and reduced baking time to 18 minutes. I also added chopped walnuts and used regular size chocolate chips. The muffins are very good.

I read the reviews prior so I made a few changes to the recipe.  I used 1 cup milk, half cup sour cream, 1 cup coconut sugar and used a mix of dark and milk chocolate chunks amounting to 1 cup.  I also used butter instead of vegetable oil, about the same amount maybe an extra tablespoon or 2.  I baked them for 18 mins, I think I could of left them in for a minute or 2 longer but they came out great.  They were very, very moist! Very easy recipe I whipped them up in no time.  Hubby was happy.

I followed the recipe exactly except for the sprinkling sugar ontop. And they turned out a pretty pale white color. They taste really good, but could be sweeter. I dont know how to make the whole muffin browner other than longer cooking.

The temp was a lol too high, mine were done 12-15 minutes tops, even a little too browned. They aren’t as sweet as I’d like and I added a few drops of vanilla extract to the recipe. Next time I’ll def add sugar. Butter would prob be better than the oil too.

Not great! The flavor is bland and the texture is dry. I did add 1 cup of milk instead of 3/4 cup as suggested in the comments. Wouldn't make these again.

Made these for Christmas and they worked great. I did use olive instead of vegetable oil and sprinkled colored sugar on top before baking; nice muffin as a snack and with hot cocoa in the morning.

I made these at work yesterday and substituted the salt for sodium free salt as well as milk for almond milk. I used the same measurements as the recipe called for and everyone loved them. I now have to make them again today. They are not supper soft moist muffins but I prefer a little dryer of a muffin to drink milk with.

Very good! I used one cup of milk and 1 cup of chocolate chips. I also split the recipe in half, so had to measure my egg to divide the volume in half. I was worried that this would ruin my batter, but the muffins came out extremely soft, fluffy, and delicious with 18 minutes in the oven.  It also took very little time to prepare and is perfect for breakfast, snack or dessert. Would recommend for those looking for a yummy muffin that is fluffy, quick and not overpoweringly sweet.

Very disappointing. There was no flavour or colour to them, they were kind of moist but  also a bit rubbery. Would not make them again. Not an ideal late-night snack, as I had hoped it would be.

Like others, I used 1 cup sugar, 1 cup milk, and 1 cup chips. I only baked these for 18 minutes and they turned out wonderful! I made mini muffins and baked these for 13 minutes. I didn’t use the sugar toppings and will try next time. Definitely a hit at my house!

Amazing Fluffy, and crispy on the edges! these were amazing but i made a few changes and I used other peoples feedback on if you should add more or less of something in the muffins. I would have given it a 5 star if I didn't have to add more or less to the recipe.

I added an additional 1/4 cup milk as the batter was very thick. Muffins had a pretty thick crust all around after baking, but were also moist in the middle.

Followed the recipe and they looked like they’d be tasty, but they were mediocre at best. Actually only  ate 2 and threw the rest out. What’s the point of indulging in the calories if they don’t taste good? Very disappointed.

Will not make again.  Very floury and bland. I substituted applesauce for oil.  Also used ours suggestions of increasing milk and sugar. NEEDs something.  Maybe the applesauce made it bland?

I notice a lot of reviews altered the recipe.  I made them as in the recipe and they didn't rise and were dense.  I'd definitely look for another recipe next time.

This was easy, but when I tripled the recipe to make 3 dozen muffins I did t get 36. I may have made them a little large but I used standard cups and filled them with a disher so they were all the same size.

If it wasn’t for the chocolate chips, they would have been so plain. Didn’t add the sugar topping though, to be fair. I’ll keep searching for a better recipe.

I have no idea how these muffins got this high of a rating.. possibly because the sheer amount of idiots who review at 4 or 5 stars when they drastically changed the recipe. I wish people would stop doing this! Review it as is, no changes or it is a different recipe entirely. 
So I made this exactly to recipe. The mix was literally all dry ingredients when I mixed it. There is no way this would make muffins. Too little moisture.  I had to add an extra 1/4 cup of milk and it was still barely wet enough to form a dough. I followed the directions exactly and it was a disaster. These muffins turned out tasting absolutely horrible in every way . Do not bother wasting your ingredients 
Cooking time was also way too long  
Bad recipe

Dahlia2's experience was also mine - there is something missing, though I don't really want to make the muffins again and make all kinds of adjustments like she did. 

They were certainly not horrible, but just not something I'm interested in trying again.

Made these per the alterations suggested by other reviewers and they came out great. I used a full cup of milk, half cup of oil, and a full cup of sugar. I also baked 18 minutes precisely and it was plenty baked. Gave this recipe 4 stars because it really needed these modifications. Will make again!

These were great! I changed a few things: did half white and half whole wheat flour (only because I always try to sneak it in for my kids, I’m sure using all white would have tasted even better!), knowing that would make it a tad more dry j added 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/4 cup oil. Also 1 teaspoon vanilla. Only needed about 16 minutes to bake, if you’re are turning out too dry you probably need to increase moisture and decrease cake time. Will make again. :)

I made them according to the recipe the first time, and they turned out great, except they were to dry. Also, I had a lot of the sugar topping left over. I made it again with more milk and reduced the sugar ratio by 1 TBSP. They were wonderful! Great Job!

Very delicious! I added 1 1/4 cups milk and 1 cup chocolate chips. I also added a little vanilla extract (1/2 a teaspoon).  I made 12 normal muffins and 12 mini muffins . Both cooked in about 10 minutes.  Over all a 4 because of the changes and they were a little dry.

i think the recipe is very simple and yields good result, but the proportions of ingredients could use some tweak. i found the batter a little too sticky while mixing it, the consistency looked more like a scone dough if followed exactly as given recipe, so i decided to add more milk. i believe i eventually used 1 cup of milk, but still think it's on the dry side. my final product was yummy yes, but definitely dry. so next time i'm thinking to increase the oil measurement and milk measurement, or maybe use sour cream in the m ix as well.

Perfect. I just couldn't resist them and I loved them so much.
This is the 6th time I am making it and still have not been dissapointed.
It's the perfect balance between Amazing Taste and Value.
If u see this recipe do not hesitate to make it even the Beginners can make it.
The first time I made it I was a beginner I didn't even know what to do.
Thanks for sharing this recipe with the world because it truly is an absolute masterpiece and should be featured on masterchef or by Gordon Ramsay

Not even 1 hour after they were baked, they tasted one week old. Hard as rocks.  Checked all my ingredients and temperature and time.  I did everything according to the recipe.  Worst baking I have ever made.

Not the best muffin recipe. I'm sorry that I didn't read the reviews before I made this recipe. Making the recipe just as it is, they taste like biscuits with chocolate chips. Will look for a different recipe.

I did not like these muffins, they had a “cornbread texture” and we’re not sweet enough. I thought the batter looked awfully thick when I put it in the muffin tins, but I had followed the recipe so I baked them anyway. They were moist but the cornbread consistency was not good.

I followed some of the other reviewer's suggestions and used 1 cup of milk, 1/2 cup vegetable oil, and added a teaspoon of vanilla. I have a 6 muffin tin, so I baked them in two batches. The first batch came out burnt at 20 minutes, so I baked the second batch at 17.5 minutes and they turned out much better. These were decent, kind of crispy on the outside if you're into that. I prefer my muffins soft.

Instead of using milk I used almond coconut milk since I don't drink cow's milk.  I used a cup of regular sized chips since that is what I had on hand.  I also did not sprinkle the top with the sugar mixture because my husband would have thought that they were too sweet (I probably would have liked that but tried to save some calories).  I liked them!  This recipe is exactly like one of the blueberry muffins on this site that I made and loved so decided to try this one.  I love its convenience, so easy to make and with ingredients that I always have on hand.  I did not give 5 stars because I did not make it exactly as written but really liked them just the same.  Will definitely make them often!

Wonderful! I increased the milk a bit. This is an insanely easy recipe with delicious results! We love the chocolate chip muffins at our local bakery and I was delighted to find that I could make some just as delicious at home. I mixed the batter by hand. Yes, the batter  was sticky and thick  but it baked out just wonderfully! I used regular sized dark chocolate chips. These were fantastic!

These muffins are very good. They are moist, fluffy, and sweet. The reason I  gave this recipe only 3 stars  is because I had to change some things. I added 1 3/4 cup of milk instead of just 3/4, I added 1 1/2 teaspoons of vanilla extract, and I added a whole (small) bag of normal sized chocolate chips.

I didn't find this the best muffin recipe. I read the reviews before hand and did what they told me, added 1 cup of milk and a splash of vanilla. Tastes really dry and feels like it is missing something. The only good part about it in my opinion was the chocolate, because I added my whole pack instead of measuring it like it says to. I also did the topping with sugar and brown sugar, but instead of making it taste better it just made it taste burnt. Also, they weren't sweet and I most likely will not make again.  It ended up looking nice, but not tasting the part.  Even worse, it didn't even smell good while baking. Big disappointment.

Muffins were ok. They were a little bland. I did use the full cup of milk and 1 teaspoon of vanilla, but I also added another egg instead of just 1. Next time I will try adding more oil instead. Not the best muffins ever, but definitely not the worst.

These muffins are delicious. However, I would increase the oil and the milk. I would increase the milk to at least 1 cup. Also I would decrease the chips from 3/4 cup to 1/2 cup. Also I would decrease the cooking time to 14 minutes. Still, this is a delicious recipe—just needs a little tweaking!

This is an awesome muffin recipe. I did follow the lead of some of the other reviewers and increased the milk and chocolate chips to 1 cup each. I also decreased the amount of sugar used to 1/2 cup and added 1/2 cup of Splenda. I suffer with Hashimoto's disease, so I am mindful of my sugar intake. I also added 1 1/2 tsp of vanilla, and left off the sugary topping. The batter actually makes 14 good sized muffins instead of 12 which was a plus for me. My muffins were done after 22 minutes of baking. This recipe took very little time out of my busy day, and was a breeze to make. The best thing about this muffin recipe is how easy it is to modify in terms of how much sugar you use. I already have this recipe tucked away in my special kitchen drawer, and it will definitely be used again and again.

I followed the advice of the other reviewers and used 1 cup of milk and added vanilla extract. I also decreased the amount of oil to 1/4 cup. I also added a stick of butter. 
I didn't follow the recipe as is,  as a home baker, I creamed butter, sugar, eggs and vanilla extract. I added dry ingredients alternating with the milk then folded in the chocolate chips by hand. I then topped with the sugar mixture. Didn't use all.  I baked for 25 mins at 375. The came out great. I have 4 stars because many alterations had to be made to the recipe.

Recipe is very easy but they came out more like scones.  I didn't review the reviews until after I made them, I would definitely add more milk next time I make them.  Otherwise they were tasty.

These were a great muffin. I used the added 1/4 cup sour cream and used 3/4c white and 1/4c brown sugar. We baked with out liners and for 18 minutes. Very moist and delicious. We used mini chips to make the chocolate factor better. I think personally they would be extra delicious with just a touch of almond extract- but that's a personal touch!

I loved the ease of this recipe. I'm an experienced baker and didn't over mix the ingredients, and baked for 20 mins. But, the muffins were very dry, not at all moist.

Just made this recipe as written. The only tip I will suggest is to keep an eye on them in oven. I took mine out at 18 minutes and probably could have a minute sooner. Kids went back for seconds. Tasty muffins.

I made it 2 times already for my family, they loved it and so did I! I'm going to make it again for my friends. They're so moist and chocolate-y, and the touch of sweat on the top is just amazing! The best thing is that they're super easy and quick to make!

I added the vanilla and used 1 cup of milk like other readers had suggested.   They were missing something maybe more sugar
not sure, but won't be making these again.

Like many others, I read other reviews & tweaked the recipe a little.  I did add 1 cup of milk, 1 cup of sugar, 1 cup of chocolate chips, 1/4 cup of sour cream & 1 tsp. of vanilla.  I baked @ 400 for 20 minutes and they came out delicious!!  Nice & moist inside, just the right amount of sweetness & nice and crunchy on top because of the sugar topping.  Will definitely be making again!

I will start off by saying that I'm writing this review while lying in bed with my foot in a cast. Okay that's a joke , but you definitely don't want to drop one of these "muffins" on your feet. We made these this morning and followed the recipe with no changes. We did use white chocolate chips if you consider that a change. The recipe calls for 3 teaspoons of baking powder which was the first sign that this recipe wasn't going to turn out well. Also the milk and oil amounts  seemed off according to how much flour the recipe calls for. The batter was very thick. It was very close to being the consistency of bread dough. The directions state that the "muffins" should be baked for at least 20 minutes at 400 degrees. These took over 20 minutes. I never have to bake muffins for more than 15 minutes. This recipe takes longer due to the batter being so thick. So what you end up with is a very dry, dense muffin. It was also lacking in taste other than the saltiness due the 3 teaspoons of baking powder it calls for. If you're wanting a sweet, moist muffin I would suggest skipping this recipe. Even with additional wet ingredients they would probably still taste very bland.

Don't have eggs or milk in the house, so I used Red Mill's egg replacer and Vanilla Almond milk - really happy with how these came out. Will make again.

This is the WORST chocolate chip muffin recipe I have EVER used in my life. I have pretty good experience baking and followed the recipe to a T, only adding a small small splash of vanilla. The batter completely bubbled and overflowed in the oven!  Made a complete mess of the oven and are impossible to clean, let alone eat. Extremely disappointed.

I've never baked muffins before so I was a little nervous to make these. But they turned out delicious!! I baked mine on 400 for 20 min and the edges came out crunchy and the inside soft. I did exactly what the directions said and it was so simple and easy! Now I know what recipe to go to when I want to make muffins again!

I followed some of the other suggestions by using 1 cup of milk and 1/2 cup of oil. I also added 1/2 cup of brown sugar and a handful of shredded coconut. In addition, as was pointed out by another reviewer, I stuck to the traditional way of creaming the sugars with the wet ingredients then adding the dry ones. THIS will be my go to recipe.

These were great! However, I'm giving it 4 stars because , like many others, I made a few changes. I made the changes because of comments about the original recipe yielding dry muffins. I like my muffins moist and light. I added a teaspoon of vanilla, an extra 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder, and used 1 cup of buttermilk instead of regular white milk. They were  moist and delicious. I will be using this again with the buttermilk.

This is a quick and easy muffin recipe that turns out great.  I have added some flaxseed, used applesauce or Greek yogurt instead of oil, used raspberries or blueberries in place of the chocolate chips, added some cinnamon, and I have made them just as printed.  This is a good basic recipe that lends itself to your individual taste.

When I think of homemade muffins, I think they automatically have to beat the pre-mixed packages that you can buy at the grocery store in order to be worth the trouble.  I wanted these to be, but they weren't.  While the taste was great, they didn't have that soft moist density that we love about homemade muffins.  In addition, I wish I'd eliminated the sugar on top.

Really really easy to make. They turned out perfect! I did not add a cup of milk but followed the recipe exactly and used mini chocolate chips...so I didn't have any issue with the chocolate chips sinking to the bottom.  I only baked them 18 minutes and they turned out perfect, moist and golden brown.

My family was begging me to make these again the very next day! 
Only thing I tweaked on the recipe was added 1 cup of milk instead of the 3/4 and 1 cup of chocolate chips instead of the 3/4. 
The extra milk made it even more cake-like and moist and the extra chocolate chips well, you can't go wrong with extra chocolate! 
I'm thinking next time I'll try adding a little Vanilla to the recipe....

These muffins were certainly easy to make but the recipe as posted is much too dry. I added more milk and oil like some of the other reviewers. I will keep looking for a better recipe but this was quick to whip up in a hurry.

Very good! I did 1c milk per the suggestions of others and added a little vanilla. I didn't do the sugar topping. I also mixed all the wet ingredients first and then added the dry.

This recipe was really easy bit it is lacking in the flavor department a bit. I even added extra chips to it. Next time i make them i will add some vanilla or almond or orange extract. And i will most likely use real butter instead of oil. But this is a really great base recipe.

I don't know if something I did was wrong but these were definitely not the right texture going into the tray. Baking usually is very soothing for me but this was a horrible experience. The batter was sticky and didn't go into the tray properly. I haven't eaten them yet though... hopefully the taste will make up for what I just went through... :/ update - muffins taste SUPER GOOD Was worth the struggle

I will definitely make these again, as they were a big hit with my kids.  I followed the recipe; however baked made 36 mini muffins.  I baked them for about 10 minutes and they were perfect!

I followed the recipe exactly. The muffins were dry and were not fluffy and moist as the tagliine says. Total waste of time unless you are having a food fight and require hard grenades....

The muffins were delicious, but I did not do the butter, sugar crumble before baking, but instead dipped each done muffin in butter than granulated sugar for a topping

These muffins were way too crumbly. if you leave them in for 25 minutes they get burnt! even if i added more milk  to the batter, they still ended out crumbly. they were too dry. Nice try, and good effort.

Made the recipe with 1 cup of milk as suggested by previous reviews. Great texture, soft and moist on the inside, and the sugar on top gives it a nice touch. I used a mixture of cinnamon and sugar for the topping instead, just because. may try adjusting the sugar next time, as they weren't sweet enough for most of us, but that might work for other families.

Made this the other night and was super easy! I didn't have quite enough chocolate chips, but they still tasted delicious this morning! The only downfall was they were kinda plain in the middle and when I made the mixture of white sugar and brown sugar to sprinkle on top, there was way too much and I had to throw out the leftovers. They could have also been fluffier, but overall these are some delicious muffins!

Unfortunately, this recipe did not work for me. Baked as directed, but all the chocolate chips fell to the bottom of the muffins while baking, so the tops were white and the bottoms were gooey chocolate. They fell apart when I tried to pull the wrapper off, because the bottom was just melted chocolate. Disappointing.

These are my first muffin a d i have to say that they came out really good... I used organic coconut oil and came out really good ooh and also i used baking soda instead of baking powder.. I should have added some vinegar to it but completely forget for the first 6 i made and they were good! Now i added the vinegar for the other 4 as the quantity just gave me for 10 muffins.. And it came oit even better! Sooo good with a glass of cold milk yummm! Thabks for this recipe, easy to make and really good! ??

My recipe always turns out super great and I always make these muffins because they are like a go to recipe! But this time I was half a cup short for 2 cups of flour, so I kept baking and they turned out store bought beautiful! Also when it tells you to use a small bowl for wet ingredients and a big one for dry, I vise versa that because when you pour your big bowl into a tiny bowl that doesn't work, but I do love this recipe!!

I followed some of the adjustments by other reviews. Instead of adding more milk, I added a 1/4 cup of sour cream, which did make the muffins pretty moist, but I may add more next time. I also added 1 teaspoon of vanilla, which seems to be pretty perfect.

Great quick & easy recipe to make! Nothing spectacular, the kids enjoyed them. The only addition to the recipe I made was 2 teaspoons of vanilla. I used a small muffin pan so cooking time was reduced to 15-18 minutes.

Read the reviews and added in 1 cup milk, more sugar, vanilla essence and more choc chips... but still did not care for it. 

Muffins tasted very 'floury', were too dense  and hard(maybe cause i baked it a little too long so it turned hard). I'm thinking the 'how you make' influences the way the muffins come out too.. so recipe is not specific enough imo

Light and fluffy, with the intensity of the chocolate. I recommend dark chocolate as it adds a bit more contrasting flavor.

This was just and OK muffin. I've made a TON of muffins and wanted to try a new recipe for a chocolate chip muffin. The texture of the muffin was excellent..I did follow other reviewers and added 1/4 cup of plain Greek yogurt along with the milk and also added vanilla extract, but the flavor was just so-so. They were good, but not great.

Made this for mother's day!  It was a smashing hit!  It's the best fresh out of the oven!  I loved how easy it was to make, and how light and fluffy it was.  I used normal semi-sweet chocolate chips (I used over 3/4 cup, since they were bigger and I had only a little left in the bag).  I can't wait to make these again!

Good recipe...with a few changes. One, these muffins do not rise at all, so fill the cups fully. Two, the sugar coating on the top makes no sense. It does not melt in. So, I decided to remove it. Overall, these muffins were good.

I made them when I was hunting for a perfect recipe and this was far from it. They wouldn't bake in the middle no matter what temperature they were kept it (I made three batches of 6 muffins) I found it very disappointing.

I would actually give this 4.5 stars if I could. I added a little bit of cinnamon to the dry ingredients, and 2 TBSP. of butter since it was a little dry. My friends and family cannot get enough of these muffins!!!

If you're looking for a quick and simple recipe to make chocolate chip muffins, this is it! However I think next time I will use apple sauce instead of the vegetable oil, (I didn't have any on hand or else I would've)
The muffins tasted GREAT!

I followed the original and added vanilla extract and extra milk as some had suggested. Made 15 and were moist but didn't have much flavor beyond the chocolate chips. My kids and husband thought they turned out bland and wouldn't eat them. Definitely missing something.

I made this muffin recipe . It was so delicious , couldn't stop eating it. I am totally making these again. The changes I made where adding 1 cup of milk instead of 3/4 . Plus, I left off the sugar toping. It was still delicious and moist.

I added vanilla extract, and might throw in a healthy dusting of cinnamon next time. Use all the sugar-brown sugar topping! I skimped, but next time I won't. Deliciously crusty on the too and soft, warm, and gooey inside.

Changes:  1. oven turned down to 375°, baked for about 16 minutes   
                  2. used 1 cup of milk, 1/3 cup oil, 1/4 cup sour cream for moisture   
                  3. used 1 cup of regular chocolate chips and skipped the sugar topping   

If you love muffin tops, use the muffin liners, but if you want to enjoy a whole muffin, skip the liners!

Made it as per instructions, no modifications other than a little less sugar on top. They came out great, and taste great when eaten right out of oven. Judge is still out on cooled down taste :)

These were quick and easy and actually had all ingredients on hand, which was great. The grandchildren loved them. I made 6 large muffins especially for them. It only took 20-22 min. to bake. I might try some vanilla or almond extract next time.

This recipe has too much baking powder and not enough liquid.  Even after adding another 1/2 cup of milk the muffins turned out dry and this was after only fifteen minutes of baking.

I made this for a snack and I like it. I used white chocolate chips instead and it turned out good. 25 min at 400 is a little high. I would say 375. It dried out the muffins.  Overall id make this again but add some sort of flavoring

Good muffin base when using 1 cup milk and a tiny bit more oil. I would skip the sugar on top, or at least put on very little.

25 minutes was too long. They came out really dry and hard. Instead of 3/4 cup of milk, we used 1 cup of milk as other reviewers suggested. We made this a second time at 20 minutes, and it came out great. Probably won't make again, but it's a good recipe.

It was easy to make and most ingredients are in the pantry already.  However, I made this and there were extra batter and the muffin came out more on the crunchy and dry side.  I followed the suggested ingredients and cooking time.  If I use this recipe again, will definitely make some modifications like what others had suggested.  Taste wise, it was ok.  It wasn't that great.

It was so much fun I made it at least 3 times and it's a favorite! Sometimes I put more of something or less but stays the same. You must make this!

I thought these were fantastic.  I used 1 cup of milk/yogurt combined, and 'full-size' chocolate chips.  They were very easy, and very delicious!  Next time, however, I'll use less of the topping.  I loved the texture, but the sweetness competed with the flavor of the muffin itself.

This recipe was easy to follow and I liked baking it. They smelled delicious and tasted even better!! The only thing I changed was I added one cup of milk and a teaspoon of vanilla, and baked it for 18 mins instead of 20-25.

Love this recipe!! I too used 3/4 cup milk and 1/4 cup sour cream. Maybe some extra chocolate chips too. Never too much chocolate. No left overs in this house.

These are amazing! I did tweak the recipe a bit as others have suggested by using 1 cup of milk, 1/2 cup of oil, and 1 cup of chocolate chips then baked for 17 minutes. I also didn't sprinkle any sugar on top and they were sweet enough without it. I have baked these several times as muffins and recently I tried them in a fluted muffin pan (makes 6 large muffins) and they were great. Had to cook them for 20 minutes in the fluted pans since I used all of the batter to make 6 large muffins. I've also made this recipe without the chocolate chips and just upped the sugar level to 1 cup, and they were delicious too.

I decided to give this recipe a try despite the mixed reviews, by using all the recommended changes. I used 1 cup milk + 1/2 cup oil + 1 tbl spoon vanilla. But the muffins still came out too dry. They rise well & look pretty in the cups but was disappointingly dry.

Delicious potential ! I bumped oil and milk up and was a little heavy handed on the chocolate chips. Also added about a teaspoon of vanilla extract. 

My only complaint is that I should have gone with my gut and not baked at such a high temp. The bottoms burned at 17 minutes. The only time I start a muffin that high is corn,where I give it a nice crisp top at 400 then kick it down to 350. I kicked this one down to about 380 at the 10 minute mark and opened the door to rotate and cool the oven,alas too late.  Next time ( which there will be ) I will go 5 min at 400 then kick it down to 350.

delicious, easy and quick! I used 1 cup of unbleached and 1 cup of whole wheat flour, used 1 cup of milk and 1 cup of chocolate chips, I only used 3/4 cup of sugar, used applesauce instead of oil and omitted the sugar topping. I'll be using this recipe again for sure!

Good recipe. It was dense, but I didn't care too much about that. Lots of chocolate chips (I'd add 1/2 cup next time). I added 1c. Mylk and 1/2c oil. Also I used a 'flax egg.' (Made it vegan)

I liked it,but I am glad that I put a quarter cup sour cream in as some suggested or it would have been dry.  I also did half brown half white sugar. I think next time I might add applesauce to add moisture. It makes a pretty muffin.

Before putting these in the oven, I was a little concerned about how they would taste...They were more like cookie dough than like muffins. They looked the same coming out of the oven. I was surprised; they were delicious and my family enjoyed them too. The next time I make these, though, I will only be using a tablespoon of sugar to sprinkle, half white half brown, because I had a lot of sugar left over. Overall though, great recipe. Will be using again.

These muffins are so tasty and very simple to make. I used white whole wheat flour , substituted the vegetable oil for olive oil, and added a little bit more milk to the batter.

I followed the recipe exactly except I added some icing sugar on top of the muffins after they were baked. The texture turned out great, and they were a hit with everyone. I would use this again and maybe add an extra 1/4 cup of milk.

After reading reviews, I used 1 cup milk 2/3 cup oil and baked for 20min. They were delicious but I forgot to add vanilla, also per reviews, and feel they would have been delicious-er with it. Bonus: quick and easy!

Not a good recipe; follow everyone that says to add more milk, oil and eggs as these are far too floury and dense. Kind of like eating a ball of dough :( quite disappointed and should have followed my instincts before plopping them in the oven!

I wish I had read more reviews before trying this recipe.  Adding more milk would have really done the trick.  They are tasty, but turned out more the consistency of scones than muffins.  I too shortened the bake time for these, and if I hadn't they would have been nearly inedible.  I will change it up a bit to get more moisture and a more muffin-like texture next time, as it is a very easy and quick from scratch option for muffins.  However, regardless of moisture additions, 20-25 min is too long a bake time!

This recipe was easy and had such a great taste. I used butterscotch and white chocolate morsels instead of semi-sweet chocolate morsels. Also 1 1/2 cups of milk instead of 3/4 of a cup. Also a reaspoon of vanilla as well. I also put some cinnamon on top with the sugars. They were nice and moist perfect for desserts on Friday evening after dinner. :)

Sooooo disappointing. I followed directions exactly, and they were gummy and heavy. Flavor was boring. Finished muffin needed butter badly just to be moist enough. Will not make again.

I used 1 cup of milk instead of 3/4,and raised the sugar to 1 cup and omitted the salt. The recipe said the better will be lumpy and the muffins came out with lumps of unmixed flour. These muffins are really dense. Try these, you might like them.

I followed it exactly, except for adding 1 cup of milk, and the texture was all wrong. It wasn't tender at all and they didn't rise. They're decent, I guess, but I won't be making them again.

The muffins were great, but I too had to make a few changes. I followed the advises given by others here (1 cup of milk, some vanilla sugar, 1 cup of chocolate chips, no sugar on top and to bake for 18 min) and added 1 teaspoon soda bicarbonate, 2 teaspoones cinnamon, a couple of drops of lemon juice and 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar instead of the only half cup of white sugar given in the ingredients. After the muffins were done I put some Nutella as frosting and they tasted amazing :)

The only reason I'm giving it two stars is because the flavor was okay. Everything else about this muffin is completely wrong.

I gave this recipe 5 stars as it's such an easy recipe to work with. I did make a few changes as suggested by others. 

I added 1/4 cup more of milk and 1/4 cup of sour cream. Love the sour cream! I added 1/2 tbs of vanilla extract. When making these, I mixed the flour, salt and baking powder together. I added it to the other ingredients as I prefer to mix sugars with the wet ingredients. And, I added the chocolate chips last. We love chocolate so I doubled the chips. 

I baked them for 20 minutes and they were perfect. I think cook time depends on your oven. 

I particularly loved the sugar topping. It added some sweetness as the muffins aren't super sweet. And it also added a slight crunch. Husband and kids love them. I'll be making more soon. :-)

I was looking for a muffin recipe with limited ingredients since I was stuck inside the house during a storm. After reading the reviews I decided to try this recipe with the alterations suggested (I used 1 c (almond) milk, 1/2 c oil, 1 teas. vanilla and 1 c reg. sized choco. chips). Unfortunately, the muffins were very bland, and not very sweet. I would not make these muffins again due to their lack of flavor.

3 words, Oh, My Gosh. These muffins are so easy and taste so good. My kids loved them. I followed some tips from other bakers. To use 1 cup of milk, and 1 cup of the chips. They turned out super moist and mouth-watering. I doubled the recipe, because my kids love muffins, and all of the muffins were gone in less then 10 minutes. I will definetly be making these again.

This recipe was super easy. I decided to also use 1 cup of milk and 1 cup of chocolate chips I  made a reduced fat version using a half cup of fat free vanilla yogurt instead of oil and baked for 18 minutes. The muffins turned out thick and moist.  I thought that there was a little too much white sugar to brown sugar for the topping so I will probably do even portions the next time around.

I liked it, but my husband certainly did not. The first time I made this I left off the sugar topping and thought it was a little bland. The second time I did use the sugar topping but only about a third of it, and my husband would not eat it after the first bite. He said it was too sweet. Not a bad recipe, just not for us I guess.

Fuss-free as it uses oil instead of gg thru the hassle of measuring and softening butter. A little dry and lacks the flavour.

Very easy to make, only thing wrong is that they were a little salty. Will be cutting down the 3 tablespoons of baking soda down to only one.

Very easy to make. I added 1/2 cup sour cream. And used milk chocolate chips. I didn't put the sugars on top because that would've been too sweet however for some reason the muffins weren't as sweet as anticipated. Would add more sugar next time. Or try a different recipe. Wasn't as mind blowing as I'd hoped. Took only 18 minutes as mentioned in other recipes. Decent though.

I added quite a bit more milk, a little bit more oil, and decreased cooking time to 15 minutes. I also omitted the topping and added a few more chocolate chips. I used the minis. They are perfect and moist!

This recipe is ok. I did up the milk to 1 cup and add 1 teaspoon vanilla extract. As for the 3 tablespoons sugar & 2 tablespoons brown sugar - I think that's way too much topping for 12 muffins. I only used about 1/3 of it. I think 1 & 1 would be a better ratio. Next time I will add the extra 2 tablespoons sugar to the batter. After eating these I also agree with some of the other people, there is "something" missing from these muffins. I can't quite put my finger on it but I'm thinking a mashed up banana in the batter would be good. It would provide some extra sweetness. And as for the dryness, it wasn't as bad as others have suggested, but next time I will use yogurt instead of oil. That usually helps a lot. All in all, good. But would be better with a few changes next time. (Oh and, 19 minutes was perfect.)

Absoulutely delicious!  Only thing I changed was I substituted whole wheat flour for the white flour, which didn't affect the flavor. The sugar mixture on top is a nice touch!

I love these muffins! I have made this recipe several times with no problems, but today the batter was dry. I added 1/2 more milk and then decided to experiment with about 1/4 cup chocolate syrup, and omitted the sugar topping. Moist, chocolatey, and delicious!

I made these as mini muffins and they turned out AMAZING! I read the other reviews and took the advice to use 1 cup milk and the muffins turned out very moist and delicious even after 2 days in a container! Also, instead of semi-sweet I used milk chocolate chips. I have already made these twice and they will definitely be made again

No good... Won't make it again. Even though I adjusted the recepie more milk more oil it was super dry, hard and tasteless. Will keep searching for another but won't be making these again.

I did 1c milk, 1\4 c Greek yogurt, 1 tsp vanilla and mixed wet, including sugar, first. Then added dry. Then mixed in 1c dark chocolate chips. I sprinkled tops with dark and white sugar. Cooked 15 min. Only 3 stars  because of all of the modifications.

I made this recipe and kids loved it like anything. They finished all of it and we could just eat 1 each leaving the rest for kids as they do not like many things. One thing I found was it was a bit hard, something my hubby would not prefer. I am also planning to increase the quantity of milk and oil so that they are soft and fluffy. I think 1 cup or more of milk should work.

I made the muffins this morning and I adjusted it as the reviewers said too. I used a streusel topping 1/2 cup sugar 1/3 cup flour and 1/4 cup butter softened crumbled on top they came out so yummy.  I would make these muffins again and again.

I have made many different kinds of muffins and cookies and pies all from scratch and when I made these they tasted kind of like dry tasteless bread and although I had to add milk and oil to help De nastify it. It still tasted like dry bread.

This recipe has been our family's go to muffin recipe for a few years now!  The only change I make to this recipe is I add 2 large eggs & 1/3 cup Half & Half & 2/3 Almond Coconut Milk, as I found the original recipe a tad bit dry. Because i make this recipe often, I make the sugar topping mixture times 10 & store it in mason jars with a few mini marshmallows in the jar to keep the sugars from hardening.

Great texture and really easy. A little bitter so recommend adding a little (a little) less flour and some more sugar. That's all, will be sure to remake and  try again!

Overall not a bad muffin recipe. Good bite and crunch. The major downside and the reason that this is only getting 2 stars is the baking soda aftertaste. You cannot serve these to other people!

Great recipe. Like other reviewers I made some additions to suit the personal tastes of myself and my family but the basic listed recipe works well. I upped the granulated sugar in the batter to 2/3 of a cup. I like puff :) so I upped the baking powder to 4tsp. I kept the milk at 3/4 of a cup but then added 1/4 of a cup water which lightened the finished muffin. Oil was also upped to 1/2 cup and I did 2 eggs instead of one for airiness and fluff. I finished with a few chips (regular size) on the top plus a sprinkle of granulated sugar. A lot of changes! I know, but this is after making the recipe several times on separate occasions with the first time being as listed. Great five star starter recipe though with plenty of room for switching things up or tweaking.

I listened to other people's advice and used 1 cup milk and I used 1/2 cup oil... And because I ran out of chocolate chips I put I fair sized chunk of chocolate in the center and topped with powdered sugar when they were cool and although I don't eat these my teachers fell in love

These were average, but nothing to write home about.  I did follow the advice of some other reviews to add a bit more milk and oil to moisten them up, and the texture turned out lovely, but the taste is fairly bland. Also, I can taste the baking powder in them, even after they are cooked.  I think maybe I would have benefited from adding a bit of vanilla or something, just to brighten up the flavor. If I make these again, it will definitely be with some more heavy-handed adjustments. Still, they aren't terrible. They'll get eaten.

Unfortunately I did not care for these muffins. I was looking for a good breakfast muffin that didn't have buttermilk in it, as I did not have any on hand. I was very disappointed in them. They were extremely dry, and honestly just tasted like flour mixed with milk. I agree with other reviews they need some vanilla at he very least.

I was looking for an oil rather than butter recipe for muffins and found this terrific and easy one - a breeze to put together, and so tasty! I'm sure this could be adapted for blueberry or other add-ins. I have made it with white flour, but last time I used olive oil, palm sugar, and Trader Joe's gluten-free flour - surprisingly, they turned out great. I didn't have such high hopes for the gluten-free flour itself but they were delicious. Palm sugar just has a lower glycemic index than white sugar, but it does tend to dry out the baked goods, being less moist than regular sugar. I used the full cup of milk as other reviewers noted, and despite these major substitutions with the flour and sugar, the end result was golden brown on top, moist and fluffy inside. In fact I am going to make these again right now for a Sunday morning treat!

Easy and tasty. A little dry, but there's always coffee tea or milk! My 12 year old daughter made them. She stayed with the recipe. May just add a touch of sour cream in them next time... just to see how that works.

This is my first time rating anything so I'll try to keep to info I think others would find useful:  I added extra milk (making 1 c) as per other reviewers recommendations, and I added a tbsp of vanilla.  I also used raw sugar for garnish instead of the sugar/brown sugar sprinkle garnish.  The muffins were easy to make, and they tasted alright, not a mind blowing muffin but I would use this as a base quicky muffin recipe if I need them.

These were great! I followed some of the others' advice in the reviews and adjusted the milk to 1 cup, and used 2/3 cup of melted butter instead of the oil, I think it gave it a richer taste. Also, eliminated the sprinkled sugar on top and baked them as mini muffins. They were done in 15-18 minutes depending on how brown you like them. I do think that next time I'll add that 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, I think it might be what's missing. Other than that I will definitely use this recipe again.

My family loved this recipe. But it is not the same texture as a traditional muffin - it is heavy and almost crispy. It's like a mixture between a muffin and a scone.

This recipe was ok. Mine came out a little chewy;  maybe I cooked a little too long. Think the sugar on top is a nice touch.  I will make these again but I'll tweak the recipe based on some of the other post suggestions.   I did mix my wet & dry ingredients separately in my Kitchen Aid.

The recipe turned out great.

I gave this four stars due to feedback I took from other reviews. I added 1 cup of milk and 1 teaspoon of vanilla. I also baked this for 22mins. This was very easy and will make it again!

Great muffin recipe.  I also added more milk, oil and sugar as others suggested.  (One cup milk, 3/4 cup sugar and 1/2 oil)  I used jumbo muffin pan and filled all six up and cooked them for 25 minutes.  They turned out great.

Gave it four stars because they were great after following other reviewers suggestions.  Have done these a few times now for kids school.  Increased milk to 1 cup, sugar to 3/4 cup and 1 cup of mini chips, 2 tbs vanilla, skipped the sugar on top.  I have also replaced oil with bananas and/or applesauce with success.  Does do more than 12 (I'm sure because of the increased ingredients), I got 18 nice size regular muffins and when I did mini muffins I got 38 nice size muffins.  For me, baked at 375 for 18 minutes for mini muffins and 22 minutes for big ones.  I like this because I usually have the ingredients on hand, it's simple and quick for kids as snacks or to take to school.  Thanks Janice!

I just made this recipe. I have to say I'm not sure what the original taste like. I looked at the reviews and did a couple adjustments. I put a whole cup of milk and 1/4c of sour cream I also added a dash of cinnamon. I love them. I made them for On-campus student at college. I will find out tomorrow what they think. Thanks so much for the base of the recipe. I always tweak recipes to fit myself.

These were very good. I normally do receipes extactly like stated the first time. However. so many people suggested going with the full cup of milk and the 1/2 cup of oil and a splash of vanilla so that is what I did. I baked in a spray pan for 18 minutes( alsoi recommeneded by many)and they came out perfect. I did like the 1/4 cup sour cream suggestion in place of the extra milk so I might try that next time.

I tried this recipe and thought it was just about perfect.  I did add 1 cup of sugar, 1 tsp vanilla and I sour my milk.  Instead of the 2 sugars, I use coarse sugar on top of each muffin which gives a nice extra crunch!!

These are pretty good. My daughter LOVES them, but that might be because this was her first time making muffins (starting small here! :) ) They are kid-friendly and easy to make. For my preference, they are slightly dry; you have to drink something with them. Love the crustiness to the top from the cinnamon sugar. Thank you for a recipe that I am sure we will be making again!

I followed the recipe exactly.  I took them out of the oven at 15 minutes and they were dry and had a kind of hard crust on top as well as the sides and bottom.  I would have given these two stars, but I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt, as I am not known for my culinary skills -- perhaps my oven runs hot?  Side note:  Two out of three kids, who normally love choc chip muffins, liked them.

These muffins are fantastic! The only downside is the recipe only makes about 8-10 muffins, so I suggest doubling.

I was soooooo excited about this recipe that claims to be easy and delicous......well, 18 minutes into baking and the smell of burning chocolate permeated my kitchen.....I wasn't even done washing the pans, and the timer indicated that they had at least 2-7 more minutes and they were completely charred in the bottom and sides!  What a way to start my Sunday morning.  Company is coming in 15 minutes and I wanted them to have hot chocolate chip muffins.........instead they will come in to the smell of burned muffins and a VERY UNHAPPY host!
The timing needs to be changed so that this doesn't happen to others out there!!!!!!!!

My mother and I doubled the recipe and made 24 scrumptious muffins. My cousin came over to play with my two younger brothers and they tried the muffins. They loved them and begged for more! They are more like chocolate chip biscuts and don't have the texture of a muffin, but they are great! When baking, I will always use this recipe for my chocolate chip muffins and I recommend this recipe for you! 
Here are some more things:
The outside of the muffin is dry and the inside is moist (because of chocolate chips). They don't burn easily and they make a perfect treat! You should really try them! 
You'd like using this recipe for your muffins!

I made these exactly like the recipe said, except mine were done in less than 20 minutes. I work as a nanny and made these with the girls I work for... all three of us loved them! I like that the muffins are not too sweet.. the topping adds the perfect amount of sweetness.

I cooked these this morning and was a little disappointed at how dry they came out. I think I would probably add another egg, some more milk and a tad bit more oil to moisten them up some. As for the flavor that is missing from this I have to say it may be vanilla. So maybe even a teaspoon or so added may improve the taste. I did love the sugar mixture on the top, and even liked how the brown sugar caramelized around the edges. I will try these again with a few changes.

Great recipe! I did alter as well but I gave 5 stars because I didn't try it without alterations. I used 3/4 cup of milk, 1/4 cup of sour cream, 3/4 cup of sugar and 1 cup of chocolate chips. The muffin batter was delicious and personally I'd cut back on the chocolate chips, too much chocolate to me. I did the topping but added 1/2 a tablespoon of cinnamon to the sugar mixture and that was delicious! I didn't change the oil and I only had 3/4 cup of sugar because I don't like things too sweet. I thought the muffin was perfect in sweetness. I also dont own a muffin pan and made these in coffee mugs! I filled these 2/3 full and placed them in a pan with approximately 1.5 cups of water. The steam keeps them moist. You need to grease the cups (I use butter and a spoon to spread it around in the mug). Exactly 25 minutes and they were perfect. Very cute way to serve to guests. These mugs are small and only hold about a cup of liquid by the way. I also live at a high altitude but I didn't change anything just watched the time (started with 15 since everyone was saying their cooked at 18 and added a few min at a time) and at 25 min used a toothpick to check centers and they were done. Many people say use oven safe mugs, mine are old and I have no idea if they are, I just tested one first and no cracking occurred and so I used all. Made 6 muffins and used all the batter if the mugs are all the same set/size like mine. I did notice one mug still says microwave/dishwasher safe.

These were ok.  I followed the recipe exactly except I added 1/4 c sour cream(another reviewer had suggested for dryness).  They had a great flavor but I thought they were still too dry & dense. I'm not sure how to fix this so I'll try another recipe next time.  Thanks!

I made these with white whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose, because I didn't have any all-purpose flour. They came out slightly dry, but otherwise delicious. I tend to butter my muffins, so the dryness isn't much of an issue.

These muffins taste just like from the muffin shop.  I also increased the milk to 1c, added 1/2 tsp vanilla.  However, I would omit the sugar sprinkle on top.  I only used a quarter of the sugar topping and it was still too much.

Rose really well, look lovely. However, just a bit dry and dull tasting. They look so great, and seem to have a good base, so I'll definitely try it again. Probably next time I'll do the sour cream plus vanilla as another member suggested. Also, only baked them for 18 minutes and it was perfect.

Great recipe! I made a few changes though. I added 1 cup of milk and 1/2 cup vegetable oil. For the topping instead of mixing brown sugar with white sugar, I used brown sugar and a lil bit of instant coffee. Totally delicious! I will definitely be making these again.

Muffins were a bit dry. Cut the baking powder to 1 tablespoon....much better. Even add some vanilla extract for a little extra sweetness...YUM!!

Could be better. I have a big sweet tooth and these aren't nearly sweet enough (and I used milk chocolate chips). Needs about 1/4 (maybe even a third?!) of a cup of brown sugar in the batter. If you make minis you can get about 48 out of the batter. Definitely a good idea to use 1 cup of milk instead of 3/4.

I, alike most others, had an issue with the dryness. Next time I'm going to add in a cup of milk instead of 3/4c. I also added in about 1 1/2 cup of chocolate chips and about a tsp. of cocoa powder and it gave the muffin a sweet flavor. I will be making these again in the future.

I love this recipe.  It's quick easy and is my go-to for muffins.  I add extra chocolate chips.  You can't fail with these.  It's a crowd pleaser.

I don't know what happened to mine....LOL! I did what WHITE CHOCOLATE (reviewer) told me and my muffins moist on the inside and tough and slightly overcooked on the outside. And guess how long i put them in for? 15mins! I want to make these again because I enjoy finding what is wrong with the product and fixing it.  Good Luck!

Fondly, The Bakin' Teen

I put in baking soda by mistake but they tasted fine. I'd recommend cooking it about 18 minutes. They were awesome and I would make more soon!

I increased both the milk and chocolate chips to one cup and reduced cooking time to 18 minutes after reading other reviews. I still found the muffins to be a little dry, certainly not moist. If I used this recipe again I would increase the oil to half a cup to try and combat this. I would also add vanilla as I found the muffins to be a little bland. I reduced the sugar sprinkled on top by half, that seemed adequate. My kids loved them but I wasn't that keen. I think there are better muffin recipes out there.

Easy and delicious! I use egg whites, wheat flour, and applesauce in place of oil to keep things healthy.  Try adding 1/3 cup of cocoa powder, 1 tsp. of vanilla, 3/4 cup of coffee, and only 1/4 cup of milk to get a flavorful chocolate chocolate chip muffin!  I also like to add white chocolate chips and sliced almonds.  Enjoy!

These were pretty good. I didn't care for the brown sugar on top, though. Next time I'll just add regular granulated sugar on top. I added a tsp. Of vanilla per other reviewers and they came out really flavorful.

If you add 1 cup buttermilk, and 1/4 tsp butter extract, these are a hit. Just adding milk doesn't quite get the melt-in-your mouth my customers (and I) want. :) With these additions, it's great!

Very good.  Quick, easy, and quite tasty!  The only problem I had with them was that, this being day 2, and they are alreayd getting a litt dry and hard.  That being said I didn't read any of the other reviews until just now, and adding the extra milk and oil probably would've helped.

Loved this recipe. Made some changes after reading others review. My changes were like "White Chocolate" 1c milk, 1c sugar, 1/2c oil, also added 2 eggs and 2tbsp vanilla. One batch I put in 1c mini m&m for my kids and OMG they couldn't get enough. My husband loved the first batch with chocolate chips. The muffins were mosit and the added sugar topping was amazing. I did add 1/2 tsp of cinnimon with the 2 sugar (I love cinnimon in everything). Loved it but because of the changes I will give 4/5. I think the base of the recipe is good and it allows room to customize the way you want it. Quick and easy will be a recipe I make again and again.

I made these in the morning for breakfast and they were fabulous. I did change something though, i added 1 cup of milk instead of 3/4 cup like other reviews suggested.  I also added some mashed up over ripe bananas, I think the bananas really added a great flavor to the muffins, and its a great way to get rid of overripe bananas you wont be eating! The muffins only need to bake for 18 minutes, any longer would be too long.  All in all, a nice easy recipe!

i give it four stars because it was really easy to make but there's something about the taste and texture that's a bit...'weird'. it's not exactly like the texture of a muffin, but it's not of a cupcake/cake either. the taste, i feel, was saved by the sprinkled sugars and also the extra mini chips i sprinkled on top. had i not sprinkled anything on top then the taste would be a bit on the bland side. i would definitely add a bit more sugar to the mixture. i also added some plain yogurt (because i ran out of sour cream) to make it a bit moist.

here's a question though, how different is it from NORA'S SPECIAL CHOCOLATE CHIP MUFFINS, because i compared the ingredients and they were EXACTLY the same...hmmm...

Good muffins- my kids enjoyed them. They are a tad dry, maybe will add a bit more milk  next time. Only thing I did different was use mini semi-sweet chocolate chips(all I had on hand) and made 24 mini muffins instead of 12 large. Will make again- kids already asking for more!

These were the best chocolate chip muffins I have ever had! I agree with the other users that said vanilla was too important to miss, which is why I only gave this 4 stars. I added 1 teaspoon of real vanilla and increased the milk to 1 cup.  Also, I didn't have any all-purpose, so I used 1 cup white-wheat flour, and 1 cup whole-wheat flour. They were ever-so-slightly dry, but I I know this was caused by the wheat. I just warmed them up in the microwave and the melted chocolate chips were enough to return moisture to them, and they really were so good! My son even called them cake! This is definitely going to be my standard chocolate-chip muffin recipe from now on!

My six year old daughter and I made these last night- the recipe was so easy she could almost make them herself!  My sons and their friend thought they were delicious and all the kids can't wait until we make them again- thanks!

I used this recipe with the changes made by WHITE CHOCOLATE. 1 cup sugar, 1c. milk, 1/2c oil, 1c. choc. chips I also made mine in mini muffin pans.  This batch will make 48 mini muffins, cooking for 11min.  I didnt use the sugar for the tops.  They come out soft and fluffy.  I can't keep the kids away from them.

these were pretty good, though I'm not a chocolate lover so it's hard for me to rate it.  I think it had too many chocolate chips though i'm interested to get input from others on that. I will definitely add a little more milk the next time I make them because they were a little dry.  they were good, just not my cup of tea.

i really liked this recipe. it was everything i wanted it to be. i didn't give it a perfect score because it didn't blow my mind, but this was a really good standard recipe, that i will definately use again. i used 1 cup of milk and a little bit more oil and baked them for 18 minutes, and they turned out very nicely!

Very easy to make and my six-year-old enjoyed making them.  I found them to have more of the consistency of a scone than a muffin.  Would probably find a different recipe next time.

I originally found this recipe titled as "Noras chocolate chip muffins" but one of the reviewers noted this link, which leads me to believe this may be the original.. Anyway, like many reviewers have said, I used 1 cup milk instead of 3/4, and would probably use a *little* more oil next time.  Substituted reg-sized semisweet choc morsels instead of minis, and the muffins still came out great - no "sunk to the bottom" problems.  I ended up with about half of my brown-white sugar mixture leftover, so I would suggest mixing 2 tbsp white sugar and 1 tbsp brown sugar... or whatever smaller 2:1 ratio mixture you'd like to adjust the sugary topping to.  Spray your tins with Pam (with Flour for Baking) and give another quick shot into each paper liner for super easy removal of these delish muffins.   This recipe is a keeper!

These muffins were delicious! Instead of using chocolate chips I used chocolate chunks. I also added 1 cup of them instead of 3/4 cup. I used this recipe for a 4-H judging and the judge loved them!

I just pulled these out of the oven.  What a delight!  They came out perfect.  I used a cup of buttermilk instead of 3/4 milk.  They weren't dry at all and I really liked the use of mini chips in the recipe.  I will be making these again.

I thought these were delicious! :D I read the reviews and added a 1/2 tsp of vanilla and 1 cup of milk instead of 3/4 cup and baked for 12 minutes (my oven runs very hot) and they came out perfect. I will definitely make again and pass the recipe along to friends.

These muffins tasted perfect!!  I did change the milk & mini morsels from the 3/4 cup to 1 full cup and found these muffins moist and tasty just the way we like them.  Easy to make and ready in 20 minutes!  The children would like me to like them again!

Very yummy and easy to make. I didn't use all of the brown sugar/white sugar mixture and they were still a little too sweet for my liking. Next time I think I'll use less chocolate chips. I did follow the advice of other reviews and use 1 cup of milk ( 1%) which left muffins nice and moist.

very easy! I went with the other reviewers advice and increased the milk to 1 cup, the veg. oil to 1/2 cup and they are moist, but not super moist.  I would watch the bake time carefully.  I did a double batch so it's possible mine went a minute or two over.  I also used 1 cup of regular sized chocolate chips and sprinkled raw sugar on top instead of the white and brown sugar.  I made these for my daughter's class and I would definitely make again.

The only reason I gave this muffin a four star is because I had to change the recipe. I did what others suggested. 1 cup milk, 1 cup sugar, 1/2 cup oil, and 1 cup chocolate chips. I also added in a teaspoon vanilla. It was delicious, but not sure how good it would have been without the changes.

great and easy. i followed the other reviews and added vanilla and upped the milk from 3/4 to 1 cup and then added a bit more milk until the consistency was right.  my only disappointment was that it yielded exactly 1 dozen.  next time i'll make more for sure.

Mine did not turn out very well, but in fairness to the recipe maker, i used splenda instead of sugar.. and whole wheat flour..  sometimes these changes don't take well to a recipe..
TRIED AGAIN..... followed recipe - use 1 cup milk, 2 eggs, and real sugar.. they are fabulous! But they do need the extra ingredients to keep moist..

Just finished baking these & they're delish! Gave 4 stars because I changed the milk (1 cup) & used applesauce instead of oil.

I thought these were really yummy! The sugars on top made it just the thing I was looking for. Unfortunatly my "picky" son didn't like the texture of the sugars, but my other son thought they made the muffin the best recipe I have tried!! Thanks for this recipe, it's a keeper! I followed directions and recipe EXActly!

Easy and good as promised! I made these with my preschooler and made them in mini muffin cups. They came out with a nice little crunch on the top, but soft in the middle.

I made these at night for morning. Once they had cooked I let them cool then covered in wrap. The next morning they were hard rock! I heated them up, then the muffin part was still hard but the chocolate was melted. They were O.K.

Love this recipe!  I followed the recommendations of 'whitechocolate' and added 1 cup milk, 1/2 cup oil, 1 cup sugar, and 1 cup chocolate chips.  I also added a hint of vanilla and they are delicious!  I made mini muffins and baked for 9 minutes and they came out perfect.  Also I used regular chocolate chips because thats what I had, can't wait to try them with the mini chips!

I realised last minute I was out of vegetable oil so I used some olive oil and butter instead (bizarre I know - but taste-wise they came out great, just moist enough!) I also added some vanilla essence and a little cinnamon. Only problem was the tops came out a little brown for my liking after 20 mins at 400 degrees F. Next time I might put them right at the bottom or try a slightly lower temp to stop them being so brown on the top. Tasted fab though and the insides we light, fluffy and delicious!

I followed the other raters instructions to add a whole cup of milk, but I still found these muffins extremely dry.  The flavor was good, but I think I would maybe use whole milk next time and add a teaspoon of vanilla.

Fast easy recipe and tasted great!  I took others advice and increased milk to 1c, increased oil to 1/2 cup, and added a dollop of sour cream.  Also added extra chocolate chips, and cinnamon.  Used about 3/4c sugar and it was perfect, not too sweet.

ok, these are FANTASTIC if you make a few changes.  add 1 1/2 tsp of pure vanilla. use 3/4 cup milk, 1/4 cup sour cream and a splash of flavored coffee creamer if you have it ( I used vanilla cinnamon) and a few sprinkles of ground cinnamon.  they are amazing.

These were just okay. I added a 1 /4 a cup of sour cream and a tsp of vanilla. They seemed really plain. I also thought the baking times were off, mine neded up a little burnt of the sides and bottom and I used baking cups too.

My first muffin attempt. Sprinkle sugar meant put a little on top, I think I put too much and covered the whole muffin. Not quite a hit with the home crowd.

this is a great dish! this is my first time making these and they were the best muffins i have ever had. i read a review were you should put half a tsp in an use a entire cup of milk instead of just three fourths a cup. a little twist I did was instead all three fourths of a cup of the chips being chocolate, I did two fourths chocolate chips and one fourth peanut butter chips. it was delicious and I assure you i will be making this meal again soon. and bye the way, i was out of oil so i used three tbsp of butter and two tbsp of apple sauce. you may want to give that a try. :-D

These were great!  I made a few modicfications:  I used 2 C whole wheat flour.  I added 1/4c ground flax seed & added 1c of Hershey's Dark Chocolate chips.  I also added a little ground cinnamon to the white/brown sugar topping.  In addition, I also, used 1C milk & 1 C sugar & 1/2c of oil.  Thank you. These are a keeper.

I followed some of the other reviews and added extra milk and oil.  I also made this gluten free by substituting an all-purpose flour mix with xanthan gum already mixed in.  It came out so well that you could not tell it was gluten free.

Good recipe, but altered a little bit.  Used 1 cup regular flour, 1 cup whole wheat flour.  Also used 1 cup milk, 1/2 cup vegetable oil and 1 tsp vanilla.  Won't substitute wheat flour next time.

I loved this recipe. It was simple and tasty. Instead of  chocolate chips I mixed in some cinnamon and sugar with tasty results. Also I tried a few with nothing added and even plain the muffins were pretty great.

I think these are definately missing something, the batter was very thick and the muffins too dry.  I will try it again with some additional moisture.  I wish I had read the other reviews before I tried it though..

These were super easy to make and they taste wonderful!  The only reason why I'm giving 4 stars is because I read the reviews and followed the suggestion of adding more milk and a little vanilla extract, and that wasn't part of the original instructions--therefore, I wouldn't fully rating this recipe.  Otherwise, this is a great muffin recipe and I will be using it again. =)

Boy did these hit the spot!  I followed the revised recipe with 1 cup of milk, etc.  I would probably leave off the sugar topping next time b/c it's very sweet!  Otherwise, delicious.

Simply excellent. I did the 1 cup of milk and 1/2 cup of oil and added vanilla extract. I didn't top with more sugar only cause my kids don't need it and they were a huge hit!!

4 Stars with alterations.  I didn't try the base recipe.  I read the reviews before trying this recipe.  I made the following alterations:  1. Used 1 c chocolate chips. 2. Used a heaping quarter cup of white sugar and a firmly packed 1/4 cup of brown sugar. 3. Used 1/2 c canola oil; added an extra splash of milk. 4. Added 1 tsp. vanilla extract. 5. Stirred batter to combine, less than 20 strokes.  Then let the batter sit for about 10 minutes. 6. Added a streusel topping instead of the sugar sprinkle. 7. Reduced baking time to 15 minutes.  Despite the reduced baking time, the muffins were still overdone and consequently a little dry.  But it's close... Next time I will try reducing the baking temperature (to 350 deg; 400 seems high to me) and watching the time very closely.

this was really good and easy. i added more milk and oil as suggested as well as some vanilla. one thing that i didn't like about it was the sugar topping so we just brushed it off. other than that, it was delicious!

Somewhat bland, even with 1 tsp of vanilla extract added in. The coating on top was a bit much, and I only used half of my sugar mixture! My kids won't even eat the muffin tops because they're so crunchy :(

These muffins were perfect and easy to make. I increased the milk like the others suggested and I combined the chocolate chips with white chocolate chips(just for my daughter). My kids adored these muffins.

As others said, these muffins are not overly sweet ..... but that's a good thing for me!  Many muffins are as sweet as cupcakes but these aren't.   I omitted the sugar topping.  Also upped the milk to 1 cup, based on other reviews, but still found them a little drier than I prefer.  Next time, I will also add some vanilla yogurt.

I halved the recipe to make 6 muffins, enough for 2 each for breakfast.  They were on the smaller side in comparison to muffins I've made previously, but still enjoyable.  I worked them out to be 198 calories each when using the following: 5 oz sifted white flour, 50g sugar, 1.5 teaspoons baking powder, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/3 + 1 T skim milk, 2 T oil, 1.5 T egg, 30g chocolate chips, 6 teaspoons unpacked brown sugar for sprinkling on top.  Mine cooked for 19 minutes and barely filled 6 muffin cups 2/3 full, but they did rise up well.

Amazing chocolate chip muffins. I woke up this morning and had an erge to make muffins. All I had was chocolate chips on hand and I found this. I followed the recipe exactly other than adding 1 cup of milk instead of 3/4. They were very yummy and a huge hit with my family! Moist, chocolatey, and fluffy! I'm definitely keeping this recipe! YUM!

Even when undercooked these muffins were extremely dry and had way too many chocolate chips (If I would make again I would half them).  They were not very sweet either.  Not our favorite.

Great, fluffy and moist but every one stuck to the bottom of my muffin pan.  I sprayed just the bottom, like it said and I did adjust the recipe as suggested.  Oh well, they were just for the family and we love muffins tops.  For friends, I'd be afraid to try it.

I found these muffins to be really dry, and I made sure to not overwork the batter or overbake. They also didn't have much flavour. The sugar on top is a great idea unfortunatly it was the only part I could get the kids to eat.

These were very good.  I made three batches for my son to take to school for his birthday.  He said everyone loved them!  I increased the milk to one cup, subbed canola oil for the vegetable oil, and added one half teaspoon of vanilla.  I noticed that the texture becomes more dense after you cover them for storage.  I'll make these again!

I added more milk and oil as recommended, but I found these muffins a little bland. I'm not sure what exactly is missing, but these were not the greatest I've ever tasted. They are not bad, but I would probably not make them again.

My husband absolutely looovvvveeess these muffins. I have made this recipe about 10 times and he devoures most of the muffins by himself. I didn't give the recepie 5 stars only because I find it to be a little bit better when I added extra ingredients as other reviewers suggested. But this recipe will stay with us forever.

This recipe is really easy and quick to put together. This was my first time making muffin and I will definately be making it again.  Similar to other review, I also decreased amount of sugar than recipe.  Thanks for great recipe

these muffins are realllllly good. i used a whole cup of milk and some extra oil like most suggested. i only had normal sized chocolate chips so i used those and increased to a whole cup of chocolate chips.  my muffins baked in less time than the recipe suggests- so make sure to keep an eye on them. and just to share this gem of knowledge- every time i bake muffins the thin aluminum foil kind of muffin cups work so much better than the thicker non-stick metal ones. im not sure why- but the flimsier muffin cups seem to cook more evenly and the bottom never burns or gets tough.

They're fast and easy, expecially for breakfast. At first I thought the batter was too moist and they were going to br soggy, but they were perfect. (a big hit with the kids frends.

These were really super easy to make, but they really weren't muffins. I took some advice from the reviews and added more milk to the recipe, but they were pretty much like tea biscuits with chocolate chips in them. I wouldn't make them again as muffins, perhaps omit the chocolate chips and make them for when people come by for tea.

Easy, fast, delicious.  The outside was a little crispy, more like a biscuit, but I loved it like that.  Dough seemed more like dough, less like batter - more milk next time? I took the advice of one reviewer and added just under 1/4 cup sour cream - very moist but not doughy or gooey.  I also added 1 1/2 Tblspn orange zest - gave it another dimension. Can't wait for my 4yr son to wake up and give his review!

My boys loved these. Made some changes though, added 1/4cup butter, reduced oil to 1/4cup, increased white sugar to 3/4cup and added 1tsp Vanilla. Also, reduced cook time to 18mins as recommended.

I followed the recipe with the exception that I used 1 c. milk and 1/2 c. vegetable oil. The batter was really, really thick. The muffins came out more like scones, like another reviewer mentioned. They were good, but not what I would classify as a muffin.

I added 1 cup of milk as suggested, I accidently ommited the 1/2 cup of sugar, but the chocolate chips made the muffin sweet enough, so I will leave the sugar out the next time as well. I also used whole wheat flour instead of all purpose flour. I think that this was a great recipe, very moist and I will def make again!!

This is my first time making muffins that didn't come in a box! These turned out pretty good. The only thing I changed was the amount of sugar topping. I only used about a pinch on each muffin. Gave them just the right crunch.

I am an avid baker and usually am able to get things right when it comes to baking. . .easy to make is about the only good thinng about these muffins.  I would almost not even call them muffins except for the fact that they were made in a muffin tin.  I tried to make both muffifn tops and mini muffins.  I listen to other reviewers and did add 1 cup of milk, and slightly more oil.  When I put the batter in the muffin top pan, it was sticky and impossible to spread out because it was so thick.  I thought for sure it would spread out as it baked in the oven but they actually came out looking exactly like the lump of batter I put in.  They sort of resembled scones.  Taste, was more like a biscuit and that was definitely not because of over stiring.  Overall, not a recipe I would make again.

This recipe is great! I tried it today and it turned out perfect. Some alterations I made: I used 1 cup of milk and 1/2 tsp of vanilla. My muffins turned brown at the tops at the 10 minute mark yet remained uncooked inside, so I lowered the temperature down slightly to 190 degrees C to prevent them from burning. The batter made 12 lovely, slightly large muffins, and my family loved them! Thanks!

Delicious! I made the changes that other people recommended and these turned out really light and fluffy.
Had these ready when the kids came home from school and they disappeared pretty quick!

I followed the recipe and used 1 cup of milk, as was suggested, as well as a tsp of vanilla.  I am disappointed in the results.  They are more like a biscuit with chocolate chips than a muffin.  Cooking time is way too long and should be 18 min.

These are awesome!  Irresistible!  Just the right amount of sweetness.  I made them to have on hand for my kids' lunches but I have to admit that a lot of them made it into my tummy.

Great tasting with or without sugar on top. Also can change chocolate chips with about anything you want to. GREAT recipe.

Really good recipe, made with ingredients one normally has around the house.  I too used one cup of milk, and added a tsp. of vanilla.  Great for a Sunday morning treat!

Excellent!  Very easy to make.  My one tip is to halve the amount of sugar for the topping.  My daughter and I made a double batch (this works well with blueberries too) and there was enough sugar for both batches.

even when adding more milk and applesauce, I found this batter very tough to work with and the gluten developed very quickly- so I had to let it set for 20 minutes before scooping into the muffin tins.  They tasted more like scones as opposed to muffins.  Also 3/4 cup of chocolate chips was plenty!

These muffins are great. I can't stand it when people give something a bad review when they haven't followed the recipe. "I added this and took away that" Don't give a bad review when you've created a totally different recipe. I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect. I also made a second batch using chocolate chips and strawberries. Very yummy!

These were quick and easy to make but I did not like the taste of them at all. They were very bland the only thing you could taste was the chocolate chips and though there were plenty of those it did not mask the blandness of the muffin itself. I would find another recipe.

We loved these! I used white chocolate chips and added a few raisins. I also followed the advice of some reviewers and used 1 cup of milk, 1/2 cup oil and 1 tsp vanilla.  They were just perfect, moist and tasty.

Thanks!

I used 1 cup milk and 1/2 cup oil as did others. My five-year-old and I gave these 5 stars.  My 8-year old gave them 3 -- she said, "Needs more chocolate and more flavor -- like more sweetness."

These are great, I made half blueberry and have chocolate chip(for the kids).I used 1/4 cup of sour cream(as another reviewer suggested) and used apple sauce instead of the oil, they came out really moist and the whole family loved them. Thank You, will make again.

Very yummy. I made them into mini muffins and used 1/2 whole wheat flour and added flax seed which gives it the health factor and added flavor.  I also followed some others advice and used sour cream in addition to the milk and vanilla.  The kids love them and are eating them up.  I like to make something I can consider atleast somewhat healthy, but offer it to the kids as a treat and this recipe definitely fit the bill.

Surprised I couldn't find anyone who subsituted applesauce for oil.  I did and they came out okay.  Good snack but, yes, a little dry. Next time I'll try to increase the milk like everyone suggests...or more applesauce.

These are ok... I think it'd be better with some tweaking though.  I used a cup of milk like others recommened, which worked well, but they were still awful crumbly.  It said not to overmix, but maybe I'll have to mix a bit more next time.  It's worth working with to get right though :)

This was good, but I did add 1 cup of milk, and the 1/4 of oil. I didn't add any more egg, and I did add  1 1/4 tsp of vanilla, however, this made it a little too rich for us. I think next time I'll use just a tsp or so. Oh, and I didn't put the sugar topping on either. I'll probably make these again.

I can't say as I was too impressed with this recipe. The muffins don't look like muffins at all- just shapeless balls of dough. They taste acceptable, but I would not be inclined to bake these again.

I have tried this but substituted a half cup of all purpose flour with 1 half cup of cornmeal to give it a little more flavor.  I found them to be very good within a few hours out of the oven, but sadly they dry up very quickly.

I thought these muffins were yummy. They were easy to make and baked quickly. I just wish that I would have added the vanilla, as others have suggested. With that one modification, we will definitely use this recipe again.

I was not impressed with this recipe because the muffin was extremely dry.  I added more milk and vanilla like others advised and they still came out more like a scone consistency.  Not sure what they need to make them moister.

This recipe was very simple. I had all of the ingredients in my cupboard already (which is rare for me), and I thought they tasted great.  I will make these often!

Thanks so much for this! I skipped the sugar topping and shortened the cooking time (my muffin pan is shallow), and viola: beautiful, comforting goodness. Cheers!

I tried this recipe a couple of weeks ago, and I'm not sure what I did wrong, but all of the chocolate chips fell to the bottom of the muffins.  They tasted fine, but I was a bit disappointed...I will try this again!

I like this recipe best with extra chocolate chips (1 cup) and I use  regular sized chips instead of the mini ones specified.

These were pretty good.  I used 3/4 cup sugar and 1 cup chocolate chips and left off the sugar topping.  The kids loved them.  I think next time I'll use 1 1/2 cups of chocolate chips....my boys love lots of chips!

Very easy and delicious!  Tasted almost like chocolate chip cookies.  I added a little more milk, a little brown sugar, and some vanilla extract.  I omitted the sugar on top.  They were just the right amount of moistness and sweetness.  I made 18 muffins, as I prefer more of the "muffin top" type muffin, and cooked for about 11 minutes.  Will definitely make often.  My three kids loved them too!

Great muffins! Upped the milk to 1 cup reduced fat milk and 1/3 cup olive oil.  Thought the muffins needed the sugar topping.

This recipe is very easy to make.. I had to add a little more milk than called for because the batter was too thick. They're a little dry (they're perfect if you've got a big glass of milk!) but the flavor is good.

A little dry but a good flavor. The recipe also calls for too much sugar on the top but overall, a pretty good recipe. My small siblings approved!

This is good.  I didn't have any choc chips so I used 3 tbsps of cocoa powder.  I also added vanilla and used nearly 1 cup of milk.

These are very dry. I added a little bit of vanilla but followed the rest of the recipe exact. The flavor is great- just DRY. Would be good with coffee or milk.

The mixture was too dry so i added extra milk- about 1 cup. I thought that there wasn't enough flavour in them but maybe that is because i forgot to put sugar on the top. But they taste very good frozen!

I substitute 3/4 cup of choc chips to 1/2 cups choc chips & 1/4 cup raisins to add some variety. The instructed time is a little too long, my muffins turn out to be rather dry.
Still tasty though! Suggest to shorten the baking time to 18mins.

A little bland, quite heavy.  This was my first try with these muffins so I will try them one more time and post my findings again.  I certainly wouldn't enter any contests with this muffin recipe.

these were good, but a little dry.  I added a little extra milk and it did no good.  Maybe adding even more or trying to add applesauce?

I've been baking muffins with your recipe since 2001, and I must say it's always perfect, quick and easy.
My sons'Boyscout group use it to bake muffins for sale and they're always sold out.

Quick and easy recipe.  Great for kids to do with
parents.  I used mini muffin pans and cut cooking time in half.  They came out grat and my 4yr. old loves them.
