This was delicious.  I would recommend it if you like trying new popcorn toppings.  I can't believe someone would use peanut oil instead of coconut and then give this a bad review.  They are to totally different oils with very different flavors.

First, I have to admit, I didn't have any coconut oil, so I don't know if that makes a huge difference.  I used peanut oil instead, it tasted okay...but I really want Fred's recipe...a friend of a friend who won't share his popcorn seasoning secrets...dang it.  I'd give his popcorn 5 stars and him a -4 for being selfish!

I am usually the first to substitute ingredients that I don't have, but for this recipe if you don't use coconut oil then you are really missing out.  The coconut oil is part of what makes this recipe great.  The only thing that makes this a little better are raisins and salt.... peanuts are good too.  YUM.

Very tasty!  I actually heated the coconut oil, added the spices and unpopped kernels and popped it on the stove.  Delicious!  Will definitely make again!

Fantastic!  I used 1/4tsp chili powder instead of hot sauce.  Everyone gobbled it up.  I will make this on a regular basis.  We call it Masala Popcorn.

A delightful twist for a change. Not 'better' than another recipe I have (onion soup mix) but a nice change and worthy of making again.

This was great! The only thing I'd change in the recipe is the part where it says "serve immediately". I made this popcorn (along with Pad Thai popcorn and truffle popcorn and some other appetizers) for an Oscars party and it would have been nice to know that this recipe is just as delicious made a day in advance as it is made minutes before serving it.

Great taste.  The only thing I wasn't pleased with was that so much of the flavor sank to the bottom of the bowl!  The flavor mixed into the popped corn before sinking, though!

Great popcorn! I get the same finished product in a slightly different way. I cook my popcorn (1/2 cup) in 2 tblsp of coconut oil. I then melt an additional two tblsp of coconut oil, pour half over half of the cooked popcorn, then mix in half of combined spices, and repeat. Seems to more evenly distribute. Also, everyone has a different taste preference so at first, I was a little light-handed on the spices. Like anything, you can always add more later. I used garlic powder in place of fresh and chile powder in place of hot sauce. Also added a few pinches of paprika, chipotle seasoning and sea salt. Nice change from regular popcorn, and healthy with coconut oil as well as the spices. Thanks Spiderwoman77!

Don't add the hot sauce, if prevented mine from popping. Maybe I added too much. Started over, and doubled all the spices. My boys thought it tastes like Tikka Masala, which I make often from a recipe from here, we eat on linguine pasta. We call this " Tikka Masala Popcorn"

I didn't have any coconut oil, so I used motor oil. Dry popped the kernels in a paper bag in microwave. 
Great recipe. Thanks!

Didn't have any turmeric so I subbed in garam masala.  This is very yummy!  Trying to cut my butter and sodium consumption,and I had some coconut oil laying around that needs to be used! (To make a gallon of popcorn on the stovetop, pop 1/2 cup in 3 T oil.) Easy and good!
