To be honest, I was pretty disappointed with the way it turned out, and it would have been an easy mistake to fix.  Just cook the pasta separately!  I considered doing this, but was afraid the pasta wouldn't take on the flavor or spices.  Boy, was I wrong.  By trying to cook the pasta in all of the ingredients, I had a gooey albeit tasty mess at the end.  Save yourself the trouble: cook pasta and sauce separately and you will have an easy, tasty meal.

This was a great basic recipe for goulash, but seeing as how I have to always be tweaking recipes, I made the following changes:  Instead of stewed tomatoes I used 1 can of diced tomatoes.  I used a red onion as that was all I had on hand.  I added a couple dashes of Worchestshire to give it more of a beefy flavor.  Also added a dash of ground pepper and used whole wheat macaroni which I cooked seperately per package directions as there wasn't much cooking liquid in the goulash.  I topped it off with some grated Romano cheese.  Delicious!

One of my husband's favorite dinners.  I made the macaroni(I only cooked about 1 cup of the macaroni) seperately and cooked the ground beef with the onions and spices.  Put them all together and heated through.  Since I made the macaroni seperately I used the 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes and an 8 oz can of tomato sauce.  Also I had to add some salt and pepper.

I liked this recipe, but did make a few changes. I cooked the pasta separately,added a little crushed red pepper flakes to give it a little kick. Then I poured it into a baking dish added cheese to the top. And put in the oven at 350 until the cheese melted. Turned out great.

This didn't last long at my house ~ the boys ate 2-3 helpings each. Pretty good stuff. :-) It's a lot like the goulash my Mom used to make with the exception of the garlic and chili powder. I followed other reviewer's suggestions and cooked the garlic and onions in with the ground beef (which I seasoned with a little pepper, salt, chili powder, and paprika while it was browning). Aside from that, I followed the directions. The macaroni cooked up perfectly in the mixture. Thanks a bunch Cheryle ~ this one's going into the regular rotation!

This was delicious! I used tomato sauce instead of paste and added some chopped green pepper and topped with grated cheese.  We all like this even my picky teenager ate it!  Thanks.

i added a cup of green peppers and a cup of mushrooms (fresh); used a 28 oz. plus 14 oz. can of cut tomatoes; was very liberal on the spices, adding cayenne and cumin; and no tomato paste. i cooked the pasta in the pot with everything else- why clean something else when you don't have to? this dish turned out very flavorful- and SO easy!

This was a super simple and tasty dish. Similar to beefaroni. I added some frozen chopped green peppers and more garlic. I also used a 28 oz. can of diced tomatos w/ onions and peppers. I didn't use the paste. I added about 3/4 cup of water to help cook the noodles and let it simmer away. Will make again.

I didn't care for this at all but my husband loved it. The pasta comes out chewy when cooked in the sauce.. and the flavor is rather bland.. even with extra garlic and added red pepper. I may make this again because my husband liked it and because it was super easy, but I will cook the pasta in boiling water and add it after next time. I will also play with the spices a little more. I gave it three stars because hubby liked it.

This was a very good and simple dish. I substituted the stewed tomatoes for diced tomatoes and I didn't use any tomato paste. I also added another clove of garlic and a half can of corn to the last 15 minutes. You could easily use half of the beef, as 1 lb. was WAY too much. It seemed to take forever for the noodles to cook...I will cook those ahead of time next time.

This is a pretty good basic recipe.  I have tried it as is, and have tweaked it as well, and have found that I like this modification: instead of stewed tomatoes, I use one 15 oz can of tomato sauce and one 28 ounce can of diced tomatoes.  I also add a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce, 2 teaspoons of cooking wine, a teaspoon of kosher salt and another 1/4 cup of onion. After I drain the meat when it is just turned brown, I saute the garlic and onion in about a teaspoon of the fat until translucent and then add the meat back in to brown a little more.  I add all the ingredients to the meat.  I cook the macaroni separate until almost al dente and then let it cook gently in the ragu until it is softer and the residual water is gone.  I find this makes a tasty goulash that adults and kids will like.

Up here in New England, we call this "American Chop Suey." I cook a big batch of it in a 6 Â½ quart Dutch oven on the stove. I brown 2 lbs. of lean ground chuck with finely chopped garlic, chopped vidalia onion and red pepper flakes. Then I add a 32oz. carton of Swanson beef broth, a 28oz. can of good quality petite diced tomatoes (Hunt's or Cento) with a 28oz can of crushed tomatoes. I add spices like Italian seasoning, bay leaf, black pepper and a couple of Tbs. of soy sauce. I let it simmer for 20 minutes, (covered) then add chopped bell peppers and another chopped vidalia onion. Let simmer (covered) for another 10 minutes then add raw elbow macaroni. Simmer 5 minutes more then turn off the heat and let stand, covered, for 15 minutes. The macaroni absorbs the the broth and comes out perfectly Al dente, along with the pepper and onion.

This is a great clean out the fridge recipe.  To the original recipe, I added a chopped green bell pepper, a whole chopped white sweet onion, 2 T chile powder and a half tsp of liquid smoke.  I cooked the mac in with the mixture adding 1 can chopped tomatoes and about 2 cups of mushrooms and gravy I'd made the night before, and 2 heaping tsp of chopped garlic from a jar.  The smell was fabulous while cooking it, and everyone at the table ate until the dish was empty.  Thanks for a great basic, but very easy and yummy recipe.

I'm vegetarian, but for some reason (the weather I guess?) I really wanted to eat some goulash. So this worked well- I just didn't use any ground beef. :] Easy.

Ok, admittedly I tweak EVERY recipe I use.  So don't be put off by the seemingly vast amount of tweaking I used for this recipe.  First, i browned the beef with salt, pepper, garlic powder and a bit of Worchestershire sauce.  Also I used about half a large sweet onion (about 1 cup chopped) and 1/2 of a red bell pepper.  I did not use stewed tomatoes but instead used 1 8oz can of tomato sauce (no paste) combine with enough diced tomatoes with the juice for the total tomato mix to come to about 4 cups.  Then i added a splash of extra water in order to cook the mac satisfactorily (which it did, cooking seperately was not necessary).  I used 3 tsp of paprika and only 1 tsp chili, and used 3 cloves fresh garlic instead of just one.  I also gave it a dash of ceyenne pepper and red pepper flakes for some kick but i'm not sure it needed it...it turned out a bit too spicey for my taste but probably not spicey enough for my husband's.  After these modifications, it turned out VERY good, plus it was very quick and easy.

I didn't have the  tomatoes or onion called for so I substituted a small can of diced tomatoes and a 16 oz. bottle of medium salsa. I filled the can and bottle with water which cooked the macaroni quite well. If you use salsa, you don't need the paprika. I changed the chili powder to 1 tsp. but it all depends on how spicey you like it. My husband and I thought this was the best goulash we've eaten.

I made this tonight and my husband had seconds.  Therefore, 5 stars.  I cut the recipe in half and we had enough left over for another serving.  I didn't have stewed tomatoes, but did use 1 can tomato puree and 1 can diced tomatoes / green chiles.  I read the comments about the pasta.  I cooked all ingredients (except pasta) about 30 minutes, then added the pasta and kept checking for "doneness" .  It took about 11 - 12 minutes for small macaroni; it would take more for larger pasta, like penne.  I will make this again.

This recipe is exactly as my mother made it! Rich delicious and perfect fora cold weather meal! Real stick to your ribs food! All the ingredients are perfect, however I always like it with a can of kernel-style corn thrown in. Also, you may consider cutting the tomato paste by half and always cook the pasta seperateely and you can eat it right away, as soon as the noodles are incorporated into the meat sauce! YUM!

I loved this recipe!! I made a few adjustments though. Instead of using ground beef, I used ground buffalo, due to the MUCH lower fat content. I used a 28 oz. can of diced tomatoes, a 15 oz. can of crushed tomatoes, and half of that can full of water. It helped to cook the macaroni better. I used cayenne pepper instead of paprika. All in all, this was an AWESOME dinner for a chilly night. Thanks!!!

good base recipe that I have used for a while!  I use equal parts ground beef and sausage, fresh garlic, and add a half packet of fajita seasoning for a kick of extra flavor.

This is almost identical to my recipe, only mine has a dash of worchestershire, and a few dashes of Tabasco, and the lady who taught me to make it over 50 years ago, told me to always use Hungarian Paprika. I don't measure the Paprika or Chili powder, but having made it for so many years, I just have the feel for it.   She called it Hungarian Goulash.  Good stuff!!!

Very similar to what I have made for years. Thanks for posting this one and now I am going to make it today!  

Suggest the focus be on the ingredients and the tasty or not result, not the name as a rating point.

This was regretably forgettable for me (sorry!). Not only was this nothing like any goulash I've ever had, it was bland (I could not detect ANY spice whatsoever), WAAY too tomatoey and had an odd texture that I just couldn't get past. For starters, I think diced tomatoes would be a FAR better choice here. The only stewed tomatoes I could find at my well-stocked grocery store were sliced ones (I have never seen them sold any other way). Unless you coarsely cut into bite-sized pieces beforehand, you'll end up with HUGE tomato chunks that overpower the entire dish. Second, the addition of tomato paste made this far too thick (and as mentioned earlier, tomatoey). My last complaint is that my pasta took more than DOUBLE the amount of time to cook thru (and it still was nothing like properly cooked pasta). I should have known better..... Without the addition of water (more than a T or two as suggested), there is no way that you will end up with a saucy dish. This doesn't cook long enough to allow the stewed tomatoes to break down (into a sauce) and if you add paste, you'll end up with an over-concentrated, pasty mess. Maybe this will float your boat, but it certainly didn't mine. Thanks anyways, Cheryle.

This was a really simple recipe and came out very delicious.  I did change it up a bit in order to work with what I had in the kitchen.  I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes and half a can of left over spaghetti sauce in place of the stewed tomatoes and tomato paste.  I also cooked my macaroni noodles first, drained them, added them back to the pot and then put in the remainder of the ingredients.  Cooking time took about 15 to 20 minutes.  :)

Awsome starter recipe.  I used 2 cans diced tomatoes, a can of corn, also added a can of Ranch Style Beans.  Cooked the onion and spices with the meat.  Added additional amounts of spices after draining onion/meat mixture.  Also chose to cook macaroni with the meat mixture which required extra water.  Family added shredded cheese to their portions.  Super easy delicious recipe.  Whole family loved it!!!!! EDIT: made again using ground turkey and (needed to use up) fresh tomatoes. still added more garlic and used small can tomato sauce...  as i am out of paste.  :)  cooking pasta separate this time.  still wonderful!

found this yummy with a few alterations. I did omit the tomato paste which I think would have made it too heavy and, added a little less chili powder.   I also used the diced tomatoes with green chiles as others did and added some canned corn during the last 10 - 15 minutes of simmering time.  it was very tasty; especially served with warm, buttered cornbread! I will definitely use this recipe again...great for those cold winter evenings when you want something quick, easy, tasty & filling!

Like most other reviewers, we had mixed reactions at my house.  I found this bland, my husband too spicy.  You can't win, right?  It definitely needed salt and a fair amount of water added to boil the noodles.  This is a great recipe for someone who doesn't follow recipes to the letter.
It's a good starting point.  With a little tweaking, it's excellent.  (I WILL make it again.)

This goulash is supreme and very simple to make!
I had to add a little salt, more garlic and substituted shells for the macaroni, but it turned out delicious.  Easily one of my favorites for a night when I just want to throw it together in a hurry.

I've been trying to find a goulash recipe like the one my Mom made when we were kids and this was the closest I've found. I liked it and will try some small tweaks next time to try and get it just a bit closer to her recipe, but this is a definite keeper. I didn't change anything.

When I cooked this dish up it was really promising and smelled wonderful, but when completed, there wasn't much flavor. Maybe I did something incorrectly, but this recipe turned out very bland.

Fabulous quick dinner!  I added garlic powder, salt and pepper to the seasoning mix.  I also added a can of drained corn.  Great for those nights when you just don't have time to spend time on dinner.

Well, if you add kidney beans, its chili macaroni.  It's a good recipe though.  I didn't really fiddle with the spices too much except to use fresh garlic instead of garlic powder.  I did as some of the others and used 2 cans diced tomatoes.  I also used a can of tomato paste.  Because I cooked the mac in with the meat I ended up adding about a cup of water to get the mac to cook properly.
Nice idea!!

Edible - barely.   It was almost impossible to get the pasta cooked and even then it was not evenly cooked - some undercooked, some over cooked.  Also, tooooo much tomatoe taste.  Would be better to precook the pasta and also have some other veggies inside, such as mushrooms, green peppers, corn, green beans, etc.

I had looked around for something quick to cook, to get rid of some things in my fridge and food cabinet, this was a good basis, but somehow the recipe got away from me, lol..mainly due to what I had..it turned out rather tasty. I had 1/2 a box of Penne Rigate and I boiled them while browning my ground beef, along with the onions, garlic and 1/3 cup of sliced green pepper. I added the paprika, but used a packet of Chili Seasoning Mix anstead of Chili Powder, also and this is a must in my family, I added 1-2 TBSP of brown sugar and a can of red beans..I let that simmer for a while, to let the flavors combine, then I added the Penne and just simmered it long enough to get a good consistency. Even my picky 4 year old ate it. We had some Italian Bread on the side and I like a dollop of Sour Cream with mine, try it! As an add on, I didn't use the Tomato Paste, I didn't see any need for it.

This is similar to the recipe I use, except we like it a little spicy so I used 2 cans petite chopped tomatoes and 1 can tomatoes with green chilies.  Also added 8 oz can of whole kernel corn and salt and black pepper to taste.  Served in a bowl with crumbled UNSWEETENED cornbread mixed in.  We southerners gotta have our cornbread.  Very good.

I've been making this dish for over 50 years and my three sons love it. The only difference is I put chopped green peppers in it and leave out the chili powder. However, my son who has a family of his own and loves to cook, does put chili powder in it.  Great dish.

I am pleasantly surprised by this dish. I omitted the macaroni as we are on a low-carb diet and made the rest per the recipe. It is very rich and has hints of sweetness (which surprised me as a lot of tomato based dishes tend to be a little sour/bitter). It is also very rich in part due to the addition of the 6 oz of tomato paste. I might have preferred it better if it had less tomato paste, perhaps 3 oz instead of 6. Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing. Very easy dinner to prepare, great for times when you are too tired to whip up a meal. Thank you for sharing the recipe!

I love this Goulash recipe, its easy and quick and is perfect for a rainy day. 
I ran out of chilli powder so I replaced it with taco seasoning. I also added a few table spoons of chicken stock instead of water and as other reviewers had suggested I prepared the pasta (I used egg noodles) separately. I also add a dollop of sour cream to the top of the dish right before serving, which adds a wonderful flavor. This was thick and delicious and I will definitely make it again and again.

Very easy to make.  I cooked the pasta in water and added it to the meat/tomato sauce.  I let the goulash simmer for 40 minutes.  It wasn't my favorite flavor.

My family loved it.  I cooked the noodles first added extra fresh garlic and chopped onion.  I used 1 small can of stewed tomatoes and a small can of diced tomatoes with celery, onion and garlic mixed in.  All my boys went back for seconds.  It was quick easy and will be in the monthly menu rotation.  The best part was I already had all the ingredients already.

As written, this was "okay" at best.  Before serving it, I had a sneak-taste of it and went into "oh-no-dinner's-yucky-how-do-I-fix-this mode".  As written, it was bland.  I added more spices, cream cheese (as previously suggested), and out of desperation, added about a cup of spaghetti sauce.  After the additions, it did upgrade to about 3 1/2 stars.  Still don't think I'd make it again but at least tonight's dinner was salvageable.

This is good- but it needs a good cup of water and I would use 1/2 the chili powder next time.  I used bow ties and Italian style tomatoes- I chopped my tomatoes up a bit with my spoon because they were big pieces and I used Italian style. I think it could use a bit of sweetness, but over all it's a good meal :)

Like others, I found it rather bland.  I added some salt and that didn't really help.  I also wasn't sure how long to let it simmer, since the macaroni was put in raw.  I probably won't make it again, but keep looking for a goulash recipe that suits our family.

Just the everyone else, I added spices too (probably making it a brand new recipe).  It was very bland and tomato-y, so I added about 2-3 T. of sugar to take away, then added 3/4 cup of grated parm. cheese (my mom puts this in hers all the time too).  Some extra salt and pepper and what an incredible dinner. The leftovers were even better!!!!!  Do the pasta separate (for about 7 minutes) and then add to the mixture 30 minutes before you eat.

This is a regular in my house. I do cook the pasta separately and then add it to the meat mixture once it is almost tender. I also add a couple shakes of red pepper flakes since my husband likes it better with more spice.

Makes a very satisfying meal - nothing to write home about, but simple to make and relatively quick.

Great goulash!  I did add some beef broth to help the mac cook as others suggested and did partially cook the mac first.  Has just a touch of heat, perfect.  My husband loved it.

Good, very much what I remembered goulash to taste like. I used venison ground and more garlic, of course. Home canned tomatoes are a natural for this dish. No paste was needed, and I ended up needing about a half cup of water. The noodles cook just fine in with everything.

Quick easy dinner thrown together with on hand ingredients. I like that. This would be much better if you cooked the noodles separately and then mixed with meat mixture.  The texture of the noodles was just off when cooked in skillet and needed to add water to keep from drying out and that also watered down the flavor.

not bad, I read the reviews and omitted the paste and added 14oz can of tomato sauce. I also used italian diced tomatos instead of the stewed. After adding the pasta which took about 20 min. to cook, I added 1/2 cup water to thin it out some.

This was an okay recipe. I made quite a few modifications, however: I added and/or used a 14 oz. can of white chicken (in place of beef), 3/4 c frozen corn, 1 tsp. cumin, 1/2 c black beans, green peppers, sliced carrots, 1 cup of water, omitted the tomato paste, 3 cloves of garlic, 1 28 oz. can crushed tomatoes and 1 10 oz. can Rotel tomatoes with green chiles. I cooked this all down with the pasta until it was relatively done, then I placed it in a 9 x 13 baking dish and baked @ 400 degrees for 20 minutes. I served it with cheese and sour cream. It's a good starter recipe.

This was a disappointment after seeing so many positive reviews. I followed the recipe exactly and chose to use the tomato paste.  I had to use LOTS of water to thin it down and the macaroni never cooked properly. If I choose to make this again I will cook the onion and garlic with the ground beef and cook the macaroni separately and add in at the end.  I would also use some whole kernal corn as an addition as some have suggested and definitely would not use the tomato paste.

DEEELishus!  My hubby, child, and I were all suffering from the flu today, and when this came in my IN box, I decided to try it and VIOLA.   My hubby ate 2 bowls and said it was good, which is his ultimate food compliment!!  I really liked it, and thought it was a great Flu-fix, with the chili powder and all.  Thanks so much!

I combined this recipe with the Goulash I recipe on this site.  I used egg noodles and added kidney beans; that's where the other recipe came in.  This is very hearty and filling.  The kidney beans made it a little like chili.  My mom doesn't make it that way, but I find that it is a good flavor and texture addition.  This seems like a pretty flexible dish, and great for making a big batch and freezing for lunches.  Maybe it could use a little more spicing.

I did make a change and used tomatoes with chili peppers to give it a little ump! and also didn't use tomato paste but used an Italian sauce. It was a big hit with the husband. He said it brought back memories of his childhood that he missed with his aunt's awesome cooking in Texas.

This was great! I only had 2 eating in my home so I halved the recipe.  I added a little worshishire sauce, a little cumin and a little brown sugar (I always add brow sugar to my tomato-based dishes).  Mine did not turn out gooey as some reviewer's had. You just have to make sure the meat mixture has enough water in it(1& 1/2 cups) and that it is at a rolling boil before you add the pasta.  I had another small pot of water boiling on the stove just in case I needed to add more water, which I did have to add (1 more cup). I had enough leftovers for another 2 servings. It turned out perfect! Thank you for sharing!

My husband asked me to make this. I was hesitate and told him that itâs not the goulash he is used too (he is from Austria). He said it was the American version. SO, I made it. The first thing I noticed was that it smelled like I remember the âhamburger surpriseâ smelled like from cafeteria food, in school! Ewww. But it tasted like the Hamburger Helper (AKA Chemical Hamburger Helper) my mom would make. If you donât remember either of these uhhh dishes, you might like it. My husband did not like it and actually told me I was right.  Wow!

This was a good recipe as a base for goulash. I added mushrooms to  it and also used Spicy V-8 juice along with a touch of cumin. I will make it again. Nice dish for a cool fall day. It also keeps well in the fridge.

This was delicious!  I've been looking for a good goulash recipe that doesn't just taste like baked macaroni and this is awesome!  I'm not a fan of big chunks of tomato so I just made sure to crush them in my hands before adding them.  It was a little too hot for me so I will cut the chili powder and paprika in half next time.  I also added a teaspoon of brown sugar.  The macaroni cooks in the mixture just FINE, you just have to cook it long enough.  And keep adding water like the directions said if it's getting too dry or sticking to the bottom.  I kept adding probably a 1/2 a cup of hot water as I went along.  It's pretty much the same thing as when you cook hamburger helper, you have to simmer it for like FIFTEEN minutes to get the macaroni to cook.  Don't expect to add the macaroni and have it be done in 5 minutes.  Delicious, definitely a staple in my house now, thanks!

Very good- only changes were to add chunks of green pepper and an 8 oz. can of tomato sauce instead of optional paste. Note that two 14-1/2 oz. cans stewed tomatoes is about equal to a quart. Was a bit dry after adding dry macaroni- had to add about 1/2 cup of water extra, so next time will add another can of stewed tomatoes OR another small can of tomato sauce. Took about 20-25 minutes simmering with lid on to get macaroni tender, stirring occasionally. Why cook the macaroni separate, as other reviewers suggest?  Was easier and less cleaning to just add to pot!

This is very similar to the one my Mom always made minus the paprika and chili powder!  I always boil the macaroni separately so it's not quite done as it continues to cook in the tomato sauce if you let it simmer awhile.  I use a big can of tomato sauce and a couple of cans of either stewed or diced tomatoes. Sometimes the ones with Italian flavoring but LOVE the ones that have the garlic flavor added.  Sometimes even the canned whole tomatoes! Lots of onion and extra garlic!  Sprinkle a little grated parmesean cheese on top! This is one of my husbands favorites and always his request for his birthday meal! I am going to try adding the chili powder next time I make it!

This is a great starter recipe for goulash, but it was a bit bland for my family's taste. I use ground turkey instead of beef. Then, I use diced tomatoes and celery for more texture, dijion mustard, cumin and cayenne for kick.

I grew up on this, and occasionaly still make this for my family. We never add the tomato paste and use garlic powder. I usually keep diced tomatoes on hand because i prefer them over the stewed.

alright, it needs more dichotomy. My grandpa always adds brown sugar, so I threw some of that in, then bumped up the amount of chili powder and also added a little tabasco. The children are eating it, so good.

Great recipe. Yes, it may be a little bland, but it is a classic comfort food recipe. Reminds me of the goulash I had as a child with home-canned tomatoes. I've made it with and without the tomato paste and I prefer it without. The key to this recipe is to add a little water if needed, do not overcook the noodles, and add salt & pepper to taste. There is no need to cook the noodles separately, just keep checking them to make sure they don't get overcooked & mushy!

Seasoned the meat first.  Didnt have stewed tomatoes or tomato paste.  So I used two cans of tomato sauce and a big can of diced tomatoes.  I cut back on the chili powder, didnt want it to spicy for the children.  I did par boil the macaroni for 5 minutes.  I added about a cup of water and let it all simmer.  It came out looking kind of like watery hamburger helper.  The taste was great with creamed corn.  Thanks

Loved it! I went with the suggestions of a few reviewers to cook the pasta first, and I used diced tomatoes and some tomato sauce instead of the stewed tomatoes. I also used cumin instead of chili powder. All in all, it was a wonderful dinner. . .all my changes didn't change the fact that it was a good, solid recipe to begin with. It was plenty to go around, with leftovers, which is a huge thing for our family! Thanks for a great recipe! :D

Pretty good, made it just like the recipe stated, added more veggies but other wise made it word for word. I found that it did need more water to not come out so dry, otherwise a great tasting and easy recipe for busy moms

I am giving this a 5 because I don't usually like Goulash, and this is the best goulash I have ever tried.  It does need spiced up a bit...however men love it, my husband, his dad, and brothers made this stuff disappear and went on and on about how great it was.  It's easy to make just be sure to add some spice to it...and cook the noodles seperate.

My mom used to make this when I was little. She hadn't made it in so long she couldn't remember what was in it, leaving me and my (now adult) siblings craving it. This is as close as I've gotten to mom's recipe, and I think if I had had the tomato paste to add it would have been perfect! Very easy and quite yummy! Thanks for bringing me back to childhood!

Very yummy, simple Goulash recipe...exactly what I was looking for.  You'll probably most definitely want to cook the macaroni separately and add to the meat mixture towards the end. I used diced tomatoes instead of stewed, and I added more garlic (2 large cloves). I did use the tomato paste since I like the tomato taste. Some of my additions: 1 teaspoon of smoked paprika in addition to the regular paprika; 3-4 dashes of Worcestershire sauce; 2 teaspoons of sugar (to cut down on the acidity), and salt & pepper to taste.

This is an easy, delicious and quick meal. I've made it twice now, once with ground beef and another time with ground turkey. Either way, it is quite good.  With ground turkey it was a bit more "bland" so next time I might increase the chili powder and the paprika. Serve with a green salad and you have a great simple supper!

I didn't care for this. I added bacon to this dish and substituted one can of stewed tomatoes for diced tomatoes (I was short one can). The noodles came out chewy if you cook them in the skillet. I also thought the seasonings tasted odd in this dish. Don't plan on making this again.

This is really yummy! Not at all fancy, but perfectly enjoyable for a quick, healthy and cheap dinner. It made enough to feed about 8 people, too! I had to substitute a can of black beans for the meat, cumin and oregano for the paprika, and I added some mushrooms that I had to use up. Also I used 16 ounces stewed tomatoes and 16 ounces tomato sauce as well as 16 ounces chicken broth and an extra half cup of macaroni. The black beans surprisingly went really well with the goulash. I think the recipe would have been pretty good how it was written too.

So good!  I put a lid on and simmered with about 1/4 cup of water for maybe 20 minutes or so and the macaroni was cooked perfect.  I served with toasted homemade italian bread.  I will definately make again!!

Quick & simple dish. I used this as a base for the goulash my mom used to make & made the following changes; I omitted the chili powder and tomato paste, & added (4 servings) 1 tsp basil, 1 tsp oregano, 1 1/2 tsp onion powder, 1/2 tsp garlic salt (or to taste), I tossed 1 tsp of sugar into an 8 oz can tomato sauce. I cooked the macaroni part way through then added it to the beef after browning along with the rest of the ingredients & then added the tomato sauce & simmered. I had to add a little bit of water at the end but it turned out pretty good.

This is exactly like my grandmother's! It is one of probably two things she can make decently, so you know it has to be easy! I added the onions and 3 cloves of garlic while the beef was browning. I also only added a little over a teaspoon of chili powder, more than that would be way too much. I also mostly cooked the macaroni seperately, because I didn't want mush and there is NO WAY that amount of liquid could cook the pasta. I added the meat mixture to the drained macaroni and let it continue to cook until most of the liquid was soaked up and the macaroni was done. It was excellent! Thanks for the recipe!

I added Egg Noodles instead of macaroni.  For some reason, they just kind of melted into the mix, became dough.    If you are making this, cook the pasta separately.  Even besides, the flavor was nothing to get excited over.

My family and I *loved* this recipe!! Our goulash ended up probably a little more on the sweet side than the regular recipe as I only had Hungarian Sweet Paprika on hand - but personally we loved how it turned out with the sweet paprika, and I would be hesitant to try it the other way now! Thanks for a great recipe!!

I made a ton of changes but this is a good start. I used 2 lbs of ground beef, 8 oz of macaroni that I cooked seperately, one whole chopped onion, salt, pepper, garlic powder, chili powder, paprika, minced garlic, 36 oz of diced tomatoes, 8 oz tomato paste. At the end of cooking I added the drained macaroni to the mixture and then added 8 oz of shredded colby jack cheese, stirred and served. This was great for a family dinner, probably wouldn't serve to company. I like that I have the ingredients on hand and that it is quick to prepare.

This was good for such a quick and simple recipe. I added a little bit of cumin, extra chili powder, and garlic clove. I used whole wheat macaroni noodles. I cooked the pasta by itself after reading other reviews. I used one small can of stewed tomatoes and a small can of rotel tomatoes for added kick. I eliminated the tomato paste and used a small can of tomato sauce instead. Will make again as it's a great weeknight meal.

I made a ton of changes to this but I give it 4 stars because it is a perfect recipe for a night when you do not have much time and you need to use something you already have onhand. I mixed a chub of pork sausage in with the ground beef and I added 3 chopped cloves of garlic, 1 tsp of garlic powder (we love garlic), 2 cans of chopped tomatoes instead of the stewed ones plus 2 cans of tomato sauce and 1 can of green chilis and cooked until brown and onions tender. I did not cook the pasta with the meat. I mixed it all together at the end. Overall a good recipe for when you need to just throw something together.

I did not enjoy this recipe as is. I opted to use the tomato paste which as someone else said made it very heavy. I needed to do very serious "doctoring" in order for my husband to eat it and then it ended up tasting more like chili-mac.

I really did like this recipe.  I cooked the noodles seperately like so many said on these reviews and it was really delicious.  I will be making it again.

Delicious! I used Hot Hungarian Paprika and it gave this dish quite a kick. Very tasty. For days my husband raved about how good this tasted. This definitely goes on my Quick, Easy & Satisfying list.

Very quick and easy. I found it bland though. My mother made this dish for us as kids.  I'll ask her what she does to make it more tasty and try that.  Great quick meal.

I will start with ALWAYS cook your macaroni separately. This is a basic recipe for goulash. My mother cooked this as I grew up learning how to cook from her.  
I saute my ground beef, onions, and green bell pepper together. 
Drain the grease off after the beef has browned and the onions and bell peppers have softened. 
Add spices 1 tbs chili powder, 1/4 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp salt..stir until well blended, then add 1 can stewed tomatoes and 1 can tomatoes sauce. After your macaroni has cooked separately in boiling water for about 5 to 7 minutes, drain well...rinse then put into the meat and tomato mixture and let cook medium heat for 20 minutes stirring occasionally.

I have made this a long time and just wanted to add using the Stewed Tomatoes with peppers and onions gives it more flavor. Also add a pinch of sugar to bring down the acidic taste.  My kids and my family loved this for years.

Delicious!  Very family friendly!  The only change I made was that I cooked the pasta separately and then mixed them together! Yummy comfort food on a chilly night! My family asked if I would make it again and I will!

This recipe makes a lot. I cut it back by using 1/2 pound ground beef and 751ml can of crushed tomatoes and it still made enough for 4-6 people. Other reviews suggested cooking the pasta separately, which I did. Just make sure that the meat sauce is to the thickness you desire and then add the el dente pasta, mix and serve. I also added hot sauce for kick and Parmesan cheese once plated. Good and easy!!!

This was good.  I substituted the stewed tomatoes for a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes and a can of diced tomatoes with Italian seasoning.  I used tomato sauce instead of paste.  Liked many others I cooked my macaroni first.  It all came together very well and husband loved it.

This is a good recipe.  It allows you adjust the ingredients if you want more veggies, or spice level.  I had all the ingredients, and added some canned veggies as well.  You can adjust the liquid if you want more "sauce" for soaking up with bread or rice.  Will be using this again.  Thanks for the recipe.

It was good I liked it! It can taste a bit bland, but when I added some honey that really made it taste better. My family of four finished most of it so I guess it was pretty good:) definitely make this and add tweaks to your liking, like I added honey to mine to add a sweet taste to it!

I made this recipe today after seeing it in the Allrecipe's magazine. I almost had trouble finding it. The magazine titled it: Cheryle's Goulash. I noticed they also added 1 cup chopped green pepper. I think that was a good addition. This made a quick and easy meal. Being more familiar with the classic goulash recipe on the site, I did let it cook for about 30 minutes after the noodles were added. I just covered it with a lid and turned it to low half way through. I sauteed the vegetables, until softened, in a tblsp of oil. I then cooked the meat and once done, added the rest of the ingredients. There was a suggestion, in the magazine, that the tomato paste was too strong. As a result, I used a half sized can of tomato sauce. The pasta also required an additional 1 1/2 cup of water. For the tomatoes I used 2 cans of stewes sliced tomatoes. I also used 96% lean ground beef, Barilla vegetable elbows, and added a sprinkle of onion powder and garlic salt . The recipe yielded 6 servings, at 240 calories, plus the grated parmesan added as a garnish from another reviewer. ty

Saw this recipe in my recent AR magazine and knew my hubby would love it! We use our own ground venison in place of beef and it goes very well with Mexican flavors so I used a taco seasoning packet in place of the other seasonings.  I did season meat while browning with S&P and did still  include garlic.  The magazine recipe included diced green pepper which I added along with a 4oz can of mild diced green chiles, a can of diced tomatoes with garlic and a Tbsp. of tomato paste in place of the stewed tomatoes and can of tomato paste. I had some sliced zucchini in the freezer from our summer garden so I defrosted this, drained well and added it for some extra veggies and moisture. Following some of the other reviews, I cooked 1 cup of macaroni for 5 minutes and added when all else had been simmering a while.  I simmered all this a while longer then topped with some shredded cheddar and served after it had melted. It was a delicious hit!! I used my electric skillet which made it so easy to prepare. Great recipe! Thanks!!

I use Hunts tomato sauce 28 or 32 oz and 1 sm. can of diced tomatoes and 1 glove minched garlic.  I also add a good size chunk of veleveeta cheese (1/3 of a small box of velveeta)  I also cook an entire 1 lb. box of  pasta then add to the sauce.

I know, more like Italian Goulsah than Hungarian, but the taste is much better.

Pretty good. I'd add more water from the start or maybe add a can of beef broth next time. I added water a tablespoon at a time as directed and it wasn't enough to keep the macaroni and meat from burning a bit. I caught it in time, though. Overall, the recipe is good. It's really just chili with macaroni instead of beans. Doesn't take long and very satisfying on a cold winter's night.

Delicious was all I could hear my husband and son telling me.  I gave it 4 stars since the chili powder was a bit too much, will cut down on that next time.  I browned my meat with the onions and garlic.  Added tomatoes and seasoning - include s&p and simmered to let it cook down some and marry flavors.  Made the macaroni separate and mixed together as I was serving.  Definite on my menu!!  Thanks Cheryle for such a good and easy recipe!

Yummy!  Thanks this is a good one.  Will add to my rotation.  Added marinaria sauce instead of stewed tomatoes because that is what was on hand.  Also added red and yellow peppers to make it more like what mom did as a kid.  Really good hearty dinner.  Hubby like it a lot.  Good seasoning and flavor.

This is really bland and very disappointing. I followed the recipe exactly and it looked great but when in the mouth was just blah mush. I won't be making this again.

Goulash Supreme you failed me.  I have yet to find a good goulash.  I know its in the sauce and I even played around with the ingredients when I made this, but to me it still turned out blah.  Thankyou, but no thank you.  The search continues.

Very good and easy. I used ziti noodle no macaroni in the house. Also used two cans of stewed tomatoes (14.5 oz.) no paste. Added fresh red pepper.

I grew up with a babysitter who would make this for lunch once or twice a week with a side of cheap white bread slathered with Gold-N-Soft margerine. A family favorite because it's freaking easy, filling and total comfort food. Couple twists we use to make it our own is add a couple tbsp. italian seasoning, brown sugar, and fire roasted tomatoes. Also good with whole wheat pasta.

I give it a four star if you add your own preferred spices, a cup of water and some sugar to counteract the bitterness left behind by using  tomato paste.Also adding a bit more veggies in this dish wouldn't hurt either. Without them, I would think it would be a very bland and way too thick meat sauce. So it would be only a 3 star for us at best.

I took the idea of this recipies and made it my own. I added fresh tomaots instead of canned. Also added peas, peppers, and mushrooms. I also baked it with cheese. This recipie was alot of fun due to how much you can personalize it. Somthing you can just throw the leftovers into

Lately I've been craving the goulash that was served in my school cafeteria growing up.  I didn't modify any of the recipe and was surprised out how closely it tasted to what I remember.  Nothing fancy, but it's satisfying, cheap, and is almost better leftover.  I may add a little homemade tomato sauce next time so the leftovers aren't so dry.

I followed other reviewers' advice and pre-cooked the macaroni.  Also, I sauteed the garlic and onion with the ground beef.  It was pretty good.

I had ground beef I needed to use and was looking for a good jumping off point, this was it.  I read some reviews, and I cooked the macaroni separate, adding it in at the end, I didn't use paprika (didn't have any), and used garlic powder instead of fresh, and I used diced tomatoes instead of stewed.  I also topped the whole thing with cheese and baked for 10 min at the end.  Yummy

Very good.  After reading some reviews about pasta troubles I took everyone's advice and cooked the pasta separately and added it at the end.  I also added a couple splashes of Worchestershire and doubled the garlic. Hubby and I loved it but the kids wouldn't touch it.

I gave it four stars because I had to add a lot more spices to it because it was a little bland.  I added a little more Chili Powder, a lot less paprika (not a fan), salt, pepper, garlic powder in addition to the cloves, and Italian Seasoning.  At the end it still needed more salt.    This reminded me of Gram's recipe, stick to your ribs and hearty.  It brought me back.

I omitted tomato paste and used tomato soup and tomato sauce instead.  I thought it was very bland and I even added a lot more chili powder as well as onion powder, garlic powder, salt, pepper, basil and oregano.  This is a recipe I will not be making again.

This was really good, but I also tweaked it a bit. I used 3 cloves of garlic and 2 lbs. of meat. After slicing the garlic, I put it and the oil in the cool pan so the garlic flavor would come out a bit more, then added the onion and meat. I omitted the paprika and chili powder simply because I didn't have them on hand. Used a 28 oz. can of peeled whole tomatoes that I crushed by hand, and then a 15 oz. can of tomato sauce. I threw the noodles in, covered the pan and everything was done 7-10 minutes later.  Very easy and tasty! Will definitely make again, with more experimentation.

Very good!  I cooked the noodles seperately like some of the other reviews.  I also only used one can of stewed tomatoes.  I still think it needed a little more spice to it.  Next time I'll try adding some cumin.  BF liked it!  :)

This is similar to my mom's goulash and her father was German. The only difference is we use tomato or V-8 juice in place of tomato paste. Also, you can adjust the spices to your taste. This is great served with a tossed salad and crsuty bread. A wonderful meal on a cold fall or winter night.

This was wonderful! As close to my grandpa's goulash that I have found so far.  I followed another person's advice and boiled the macaroni separately and it turned out fine.  I used quite a bit more garlic salt, but that is just a personal choice.  Perfect meal for my family of 8 and tastes even better the next day.

I needed a lot more liquid to get the noodles to cook properly, and there wasn't near enough taste. I had to add another garlic clove, salt, pepper, more chili powder, red pepper, and some basil. It tasted better after the additions, but not great.

This is exactly what I've been craving! Just like grandmas! I did make a few additions/changes. I cooked the onion and garlic with the meat, then added salt, pepper, and italian seasoning. I used 3 cans of Italian stewed tomatoes, then added one cup of water with a beef bouillon cube dissolved into it, for more flavor and to help the pasta cook. I waited until everything was done cooking before adding the tomato paste, then I only added half a can of Italian seasoned paste. It was PERFECT!!

This didn't work for me, I had to add more than a cup of water just to bring it to a consistency it would simmer at. It needed something more for the flavor as well.

I was excited to try this because I love goulash but ended up being pretty disappointed.  I had to keep adding more and more seasoning to get any flavor.  My husband added lots of parmesan cheese just to make it edible.  Will not make again.

Good starter recipe but I had to alter it as it was too dry.  I cooked the macaroni separately (no way would it have cooked with it, not enough liquid).

This recipe is an exact replica of what my mom used to make when I was young. I do omit the onion (hubby doesn't like it) and add some ketchup (a friend's mom used to make it that way when I was a child) to give it some zing. :)

Used diced tomatoes "chili style" and kept the chili powder seasoning too. Didn't use the tomato paste, though, and it was still moist and delish! Cooked the noodles separately in boiling salted water, added and simmered about 5 minutes at the end. Put lots of cheddar cheese on top. Yum! 3 stars because of a missing spice...couldn't put my finger on it. Will try again!

Very good and very filling. Great comfort food. Very tomatoey but still good. I added a T of sugar, the T of chili powder was heaping, and hot hungarian paprika. Also some salt, about 1 tsp. I did have to use about 1/2 to 2/3 c water, just added it right off and let it cook out. My son loved this and had two very large servings. I won't make it again, as I am not into goulash much and DH doesn't like tomatoes with his meat, but like I said, my teenager loved this. I used 1 can of diced tomatoes with the green peppers/onions in it and 1 can of stewed tomatoes.

This goulash is just like the ones you eat at pot lucks! I just made it tonight and it was great! I revised it by doing the following. I added 1 can of mexican style stewed tomatoes and one regular, I doubled, maybe even tripled the chili pepper. I added Kosher salt and I did add the paste and some corn and ta da, had lots of flavor and everyone loved it! I would also recommend to cook the noodles in with everything else as the recipe states so the noodles absorb the flavor.

Pretty good. I made this for my husband and I. It makes a lot, so we had a lot to freeze. I added a can of corn and left out the pasta sauce. I added about 1/4 cup of water, and also cooked the noodles seperatly. I can see where you might need to add extra spices, as it can be kind of bland. Garlic powder and chili powder helped. All in all, a good quick dinner!

I'm sorry, but we did not like this. It was extremely bland. We added a lot of basil, oregano, and garlic salt to get some flavor to it. 

Cook the noodles separately.

Just like I remember my mom making when I was young.  This is total comfort food!  I cooked the macaroni al dente first and used canned diced tomatoes instead of stewed for a chunkier texture.

Wonderful!!!  I gave it a 4 only because I did have to add a bit of water.  I also added a shake or two of additional paprika and chili powder.  Also, I added a shake of garlic salt. Definately will make again and again!!!

This just wasn't what I was looking for.  I had to add a lot of water as it was very dry.  I thought it made a decent chili-mac, but not a great goulash.

This was ok, not too bad.  The pasta ended up kind of sticky.  I had to keep adding more water so keep an eye on it.  The taste wasn't terrible, but not special either.  It kind of tasted like a bland chili where you'd mistakenly added pasta instead of beans.  One of my 13 month old twins loved it, though, so thanks for the recipe!

A good, simple meal to make when you're short on time.  I did not use the tomato paste, but I did add an extra 14.5 oz can of stewed tomatoes, and also added a handful of more macaroni.  Pretty tasty :)

my husband and I thought it was good. I think I would cut down on the paprika next time- maybe add 1-2 tbl of tomato paste - no more!  All in all very tasty and easy! Will make again.

Very good! My husband and daughter loved it. I wasn't going to use the tomato paste but I didn't have tomato sauce so I had to and it turn out great!.. not heavy like others reviewers said. Next time I'll try with tomato sauce and see the difference.

I didn't care much for this.  It seemed to be missing something.  I thought it was more of a chili base if you used it without the noodles and added beans.  I wouldn't make it again.

This was okay, but it just wasn't spicy enough.  I added more chile powder and used stewed tomatoes with Italian spices, but it seemed very bland.

My husband and I loved this recipe. It was quick and easy and though not a dinner party meal, one that could be used for buffet type  meals. I did not add the tomato paste but instead of adding the stewed tomaotes I used a jar of pasta sauce. I did not have macaroni so I used penne pasta instead. I put it in raw though I was worried about it cooking in time. The pasta cooked fine and did not take long at all. I also reduced the amount of chillie powder to 1 tsp as I am not fond of spicy foods and I think next time I will add a bit more.
Perfect meal.

This is a dish I've been eating all my life, but my mom called it "glop". We cook the macaroni separately, being careful to not cook it all the way so it can finish cooking in the meat and tomato sauce. That brings me to another difference, we use tomato sauce or puree, not stewed tomatoes. We also added lima beans and/or corn, either caned or frozen. This is definitely comfort food for me, it takes me back to my childhood, it is one of the first dishes my mother taught me how to cook.

My whole family loved this. We even ate the leftovers again,the next night. It was super easy to make. The only change I made was to add a little more garlic.
I was afraid it might be too spicey with all that paprika and chili, but it wasn't. We'll definitely have it again.

This was surprisingly easy and tasty. I followed some suggestions by adding salt and pepper. I see a lot of suggestions to add a can of corn -- I will try that next time.

Instead of stewed tomatoes I used 1 can diced tomatoes with green chiles and 1 can tomato sauce (15 oz. each) and about 1/2 can of water. I also added a tiny bit of crushed red pepper flakes to add a little heat. It was delicious! My 4 kids even ate it. They were a little put off by the name "goulash" though!

I have been making this dish since I was 16 years old I am now 51, the only difference was I have always used egg noodles, the other way seems more like "Chili Mac", anyway Goulash has been a family favorite of my family for years, with a side salad and garlic bread, its delicious!

Awesome!  Like other users, I omitted the tomato paste and instead of using the stewed tomatoes, I used two cans of diced tomatoes with green chiles and then some extra water.  I also added a can of kidney beans to mine.  This was so good.  I am going to make it again today with homemade bread.  Thanks for sharing!!!!

My family wasn't overly thrilled with this recipe. It was easy and filling but wasn't very flavorful. I think it can be a good basic recipe that can be doctored with additional ingredients.

I have made a recipe sort of like this for years, except I use alot of chili powder, garlic powder, and 2 cans of diced tomatoes with green chiles.  I do not use tomato paste. I would recommend to anyone.

This was an awesome easy recipe for a quick dinner.  Like others I used 1 can of crushed tomatoes and 8oz tomato sauce.  I also added a couple dashes of hot sauce, but next time, I think I will try red pepper instead.

My family wasn't very impressed with this. They said it was "missing something." I opted to use the tomato paste with this recipe and probably shouldn't have. It was very heavy. I think it was too much. I'll keep looking for the perfect Goulash recipe.

Great recipe.  Instead of just plain macaroni I used macaroni and cheese (that I made separately), and a threw in a can of corn.  I also added some Tobasco sauce which added a really nice little kick.  You can add almost anything and it will taste good!

I use Italian saugsage instead of ground beef to kick it up a notch. I also pre-cook the macaroni. Great meal, and easy.

Followed "NJSS2000's" advice almost to the letter and it turned out "good." (cook macaroni seperately, cook/season the meat, used 14.5oz can diced tomatoes, and 8oz tomato sauce). However, I did add some sharp cheddar cheese to melt at the very end.  This dish is very homey and although I wouldn't consider this guest-worthy - my family enjoyed it enough to make again on those hectic nights. Thanks.

this recipe tastes good, but the instructions need some revising...  it's clear you need to cook the macaroni separately. seriously. it needs to be SEPARATE. Also could use a bit more water. I tried adding a tablespoon at a time and had minimal luck. it tastes great, but it's an insanely thick mess. I'll give it a 3 for now until I can try it done correctly.

I did as some of the others and cooked my noodles separate. This was more like a chili mac than goulash. Way too much tomato taste and chili powder.

Great recipe.  I made it according to the original recipe and it was quick and easy.  We like spicy foods so the next time I used hot Italian sausage, hot Mexican chili powder.  For fun we put in some peperoni and celery and loved it!  Thank you for a great base recipe!

Was super easy! Cooked noodles separately. I browned ground beef, onion & garlic together then added cooked noodles and everything thing else. I did use tomato paste and added close to 20 oz of water so because it was kinda thick. 10 year old loved it.

First time I followed the recipe...pretty good though missing some things. Second time I added onion, carrots, celery and a few artichoke hearts. I added some unsalted chicken stock and pasta to cook in the soup. Both times I used a mixture of ground chicken/pork since I don't eat beef.

My late mother often made this dish when I was a kid, but she called it "Lob Lolly".  It was fairly economical and she didn't have to use a lot of expensive beef that way.   I made it for my own family and have passed the recipe down to my sons and their families.  The great thing about this dish is it can be tweaked a LOT to suit individual tastes.  With salad and garlic bread, it's a neat little meal.

This a great recipe! Something that you can put together after work.  Next time I think I will leave out the tomato paste and add bell pepper. Also, it will be better if the macaroni is cooked just a little before mixing it in with the other  ingredients.

I did not use the tomato paste or the quart of stewed tomatoes. I used prego traditional sauce  and prego jar of water. I also used 1 can of fire roasted tomatoes and added green peppers. Didn't have garlic cloves so I used garlic powder.  I will definitely make again.

This is a solid one-pot supper dish. For modifications, I substituted one pound chopped kielbasa for the ground beef, added a medium bell pepper (chopped), 1/4 cup red wine, 3 tblsp sugar and 1 tsp garlic powder. For tomatoes, I used 3 14-oz cans chopped tomatoes (including liquid) and omitted the paste. I ended up adding about 3/4 cup water while the macaroni cooked on medium high heat, which took about 15 mins. I like the combination of chili powder and paprika with the other flavors. I will make this again, and I will probably cut pasta to one cup and add in some garbanzo or kidney beans for more fiber/texture. Tasty, quick & easy!

I added a T. sugar to take out the very acidic taste. That helped but I still felt that it was missing something. Maybe just the green pepper. It definitely is a man's dish.

Iâm not one to alter recipes as Iâm not confident enough to do that. With that being said,  I thought this recipe was pretty boring. It lacks a lot of flavor. I used salt and pepper at the table. My husband sprinkled on some Parmesan. I probably wonât make it again. Disappointed ??

I couldn't wait to try this recipe as it could not have been simpler to make. I made a couple of changes by using the Italian style stewed tomatoes that included garlic and oregano and I chopped up an orange bell pepper instead of the green (to avoid heartburn)  Did not use tomato paste as I did not have any but added about a half a cup of spaghetti sauce. For the add'l water I added beef broth instead..it was delicious. I didn't have any special rolls but remembered that I had frozen garlic bread which was perfect! Love that it was plenty for another meal for the 2 of us!

I don't know if I remember goulash being different or if what my mom called goulash was not goulash. What I remember was her cutting a beef roast in to cubes, browning it, cooking it in a brown gravy, and serving it over egg noodles. 

I found this recipe to be kind of bland and it reminded me more of chili with macaroni noodles mixed in.

I made the following changes to the recipe: after draining the grease from the cooked ground meat I sauteed the onions and some chopped red pepper with the meat. I added a 1/4 cup of white wine to deglaze the pot. Along with the other ingredients I added a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce and half a bag of frozen peas and carrots.  

As was stated in other reviews, in the future I will cook the pasta separately then add it to the completed sauce. By adding the uncooked pasta to the sauce, I ended up with a gooey mess of "almost" pasta. This is the main reason I didn't rate the recipe higher. I might also consider cooking the peas and carrots first before adding them to the sauce.

Super good and will definitely make it again! I didn't have paprika so I added Worcestershire sauce, more chili powder, salt and peper, and some ground cumin. Also added shredded cheese on top towards the end. And I had to add some water to help the noodles soften up. But my fiance and I loved it! ??

First time making Goulash, and it was delicious!  Definitely wanted seconds.  I didn't use chili powder or tomato paste, and added in a diced green pepper.

This is yummy but as someone who comes from a Hungarian family, I have no idea why Americans call ground beef and macaroni âgoulashâ (gulasz).  Goulash is much more like a beef stew with chunks of beef, browned and simmered in its own sauce (add liquid, of course, after the browning).   As you can tell, this has been a pet peeve of mine for decades!??

This goulash has good flavor but I had to add 2 cups of water?  I made it as directed and I used the optional 6oz tomato paste. Be careful. Noodles absorb a lot of liquid.

Too bland for my family's taste.  Needed a  lot more spices for us.  I returned to AllRecipes and found "Classic Goulash and added the ingredients from the Classic Goulash recipe.  It was more to our taste.  Next time I'll prepare just the Classic Goulash recipe and  then I can give it a true rating.

Like others, I cooked elbow macaroni separately.  I used garden tomatoes & bell peppers because we had an abundance in the garden.  Itâs always a favorite & a quick meal to prepare.

I made this pretty much per the recipe. It was ok.  The only real change, I knew it would have to have more water and I added at least a cup right at the start. You don't have to cook the pasta seperate, you just have to taste it until its done on a lower temperature. 
 Really this recipe shouldn't have the stars it has, folks make their changes and rate the outcome per their changes. I think the person who submitted it should have been more detailed. One would certainly wonder, am I really supposed to add the pasta without cooking it.  Take the time to be specific.  What other details are left out?

I never follow a recipe to fidelity! I read lots of reviews and then created my own version. I cooked my pasta separately. I used diced tomatoes,  Worchestershire sauce, seasoned pepper, beef bouillon, smoked Hungarian Paprika, and garlic powder.  The hubs doesn't like spicy so I left that out.  I also gave some to my custodians at school with some artisan bread and they loved it!  Perfect comfort food!

Oh come on! This is the most basic, bland "goulash" recipe I have ever seen here. Yet this site won't publish some recipes because there are all ready too many similar ones when you try to submit one? Seriously? No offense to the submitter, but this is really a basic recipe most cooks have doctored up to make it better.

I followed suggestions by other users and replaced the stewed tomatoes with diced, used tomato sauce rather than tomato paste and added a green pepper.  I cooked the macaroni in the goulash and it worked perfectly.  So easy and we really enjoyed it.  Getting ready to make it again tomorrow!

You have to add water if youâre going to cook the macaroni in it. Thereâs no way around it. I bet I added 3/4 cup. I used a 28oz can of diced tomatoes and then a 14oz can of Mexican stewed. Added great flavor.

We made this with the tomato paste.  It was good but next time I want to try it without the paste, just to see what it tastes like.  My husband and I have leftovers for tomorrow.  Thanks for the recipe!

Calling this Goulash (and Supreme, of all things) is like calling spam Kobe beef.  There are several decent goulash recipes on this site, but this is not one of them.  For example, look at the ones called Classic Goulash or Hungarian Goulash. Better yet, look at Anthony Bourdainâs version (in his latest book, âAppetitesâ, page 51), or at the five (!!) different versions of Goulash in Susan Derecskeyâs masterpiece, âThe Hungarian Cookbookâ page 103 onwards.

It was good but the six ounces of tomato paste was too much, would cut that down by at least half. I added a little sugar to counteract the acidity. Will do more tweeking next time.

Made it just like the recipe said and I really didn't like it. It was dominated by tomato taste. I had to cook it longer because the noodles were not done. I added beef stock to get more moisture in it but the flavor did not improve. I won't make this one again. Sorry!

4 stars because I tinkered with the original. I followed others' recommendations. I added worcestershire sauce, cumin, yellow bell pepper, crushed red pepper, basil, oregano, salt & pepper. I cooked beef, onion, & peppers together. I used 8 oz tomato sauce instead of paste. It was lovely & great for a rare snowy night in Atlanta, Ga

This is the best Goulash I have ever made. I used turkey hamburger. Diced tomatoes, instead of the stewed tomatoes. Otherwise, I used the recipe as is.

Very simple, easy to follow recipe. Someone else mentioned cooking the pasta separate â â I concur. Otherwise everything was perfect. I added some Cayanne pepper because I like heat! My 19 month old twins are devouring it

Great recipe! We loved it! I doubled the recipe and accidentally switched amounts of chili powder and paprika but was still great. I didn't have double  amounts of diced tomatoes so I used tomato sauce instead. Will make again.

Paprika may be the only ingredient this recipe has in common with goulash, a classic Hungarian dish. To call it that is misleading to readers who are not familiar with Hungarian cuisine. Best made with beef shank instead of ground beef, (less fat), dumplings instead of pasta, caraway seed added for real goulash taste. Potato carrots and peas added. More nutritious and tastier.

More tomato taste than I would have liked...needed to add water much more than the recipe called for.  Other than that, it was ok.

Boring. I add 1/4 cup of brown sugar, worst sauce, steak sauce, canned chopped tomatoes,  can of whole kernal corn and this basic recipe. Great with fresh, hot corn bread.

The picture posted did not match the recipe.  The recipe didn't look that great so I modified it.  First, I cooked onions and garlic in tomato paste.  Then I added the ground beef and cooked those all together along with some sliced green bell peppers.  I then added some home canned tomatoes and some homemade hamburger/mushroom spaghetti sauce.  I mixed those all thoroughly and added some elbow macaroni and added some chili and paprika for spice.  My homemade spaghetti sauce was quite spicy so I didn't need any more.  It turned out great.

DELICIOUS! Just right for a cold night after a long day of teaching. I used ground turkey instead of beef, and ground red pepper instead of chili powder, and the results are tasty! I plan to add mushrooms next time.

This has been a comfort food in our family since my Mom leaned to cook after getting married in 1945.  You must cook the macaroni separately at least to aldente.  Otherwise you will have a gooey mess.  I use either 3/4 bottle ketchup or tomato paste, but if you use the paste, add at least 1/4 cup sugar to offset the bitterness of the paste.  I use garlic pepper for seasoning instead of the chili powder.  If I want chili I make chili.  Diced or stewed, use whatever you have but if you use stewed, chop them up a bit.  Brown the beef, onion and garlic together, drain then add the tomatoes, .  Add the cooked Mac and  seasonings.  Let it get happy on the stove top then put it in a 350 oven for 30 mins for the mac to cook out. Serve with some fresh bakery bread with lots of butter.  Made it tonight for dinner. Bam!

I parboiled the pasta and added diced carrots to the pasta. I need veggies. Otherwise I followed the recipe increasing the spices to my taste. It was delicious, served with fresh calebrase  buns  Soul food for me.

This is pretty similar to my "swill", a great old standby.  I saute the chopped onion with the ground beef, usually use diced tomatoes rather than stewed, use a packet of taco seasoning instead of paprika and chile powder, and bake it for around 20 minutes, topping with shredded cheddar for an additional 5 or so minutes.  Actually, I started with something very close to this recipe and have tweaked it over the years.

In New England we call this American Chop Suey.   It is basically the same recipe, except we use equal can sizes of stewed tomatoes and tomato sauce, and we do cook the macaroni separately in boiling water.    Add beef,  tomatoes and macaroni in a casserole dish, top with bread crumbs or whatever you fancy.   Put in oven at 350 for about 1/2 hour.    Double or triple for an army or a or a church pot luck.    No one ever turns it down, especially kids.     I use gluten free pasta because of an allergy to wheat and no one can tell the difference.

Wow! Such memories of this dish! This is essentially my mom's recipe for homemade "beefaroni" from about 1963! Which she got from some type of women's magazine or fast-and-easy cookbook. How she did it - brown the meat, garlic, onions and peppers, cook the macaroni separately, stir everything together, serve. Sometimes, she baked it uncovered in a 350 oven to form a bit of crust on top. She used either a can of chopped tomatoes or a can of tomato sauce instead of  the paste.

Amazing taste! Maybe a little less on the chili powder, but the final result was a great success!

Good flavor but noodles cooked in sauce were mushy.  They should be cooked separately then added at the end.

As a start, this was alright, but fairly bland. I basically doubled the spices, tripled the garlic and then added salt, pepper and a little sugar to give it life. Cooking the macaroni in the sauce was OK, but I needed to add about 1 1/2 cups of water to ensure there was enough liquid cook the noodles. That said, we enjoyed it.

I followed the comments and cooked the pasta separately beforehand and it came out pretty well. I also swapped out a large can of stewed tomatoes with a smaller can of diced tomatoes and one can of Rotel too make it nice and spicy. Pretty tasty!

After reading other reviews I made the same changes. I cooked the pasta separately and then added some of the pasta water to the meat mixture to make it a bit saucier. I also noticed it was a little bland for my family so I added 2 tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce and 1 teaspoon cumin and 1 teaspoon Ancho chili powder just to kick it up a notch. This is a pretty good dish, you just need to customize it to your family's taste. Happy eating!

Just made it and it's still simmering. I made a couple changes. 1) I didn't have stewed tomatoes, so I substituted a can of diced tomatoes and a can of tomato sauce. 2) I added sugar because the tomato flavor was too strong.  It is really good. I grew up eating goulash. And it tastes like mom's. She's 84 in July and she still makes it.

I had never used a recipe for goulash before  but this time I used this recipe and loved it.  We live in a rural area and my local market does not always stock spices that few local people use.  This time I added the  purchased ancho  chili pepper and smoked paprika (both purchased online) the smoky taste in the goulash was very good. I added some green pepper but that was the only other change I made.

It was okay, a bit dry if you follow the recipe. I would recommend a can of diced tomatoes or the paste in addition add some green peppers for more flavor.

This was a big hit with my family. Like many others, I cooked my pasta separately. Omitted the onion and replaced it with onion powder because most of my family dislikes them. Also used tomato sauce instead of the stewed tomatoes for the same reason. I still added the paste though and it gave the sauce a bit more body. All in all a great recipe!

This was a good recipe. I changed things a little. I like spicy food. I did not use chili powder. I used about 2 tablespoons of black pepper, a teaspoon of coriander, 1.5 teaspoons of cumin, a tablespoon of cayenne pepper, a tablespoon of garlic powder and a lot of dried red bell peppers. I cooked the pasta separate. I put Tabasco sauce on the finished product. Yum yum

this was Goulash of course but I feel like it was missing something, the next time I attempt this dish I will add chopped green pepper, definitely not adding tomato paste next time.. it gives it this over powering bland strong tomato taste. I love goulash but I feel like this wasn't it for me also instead of stewed tomatoes I used a can of whole peeled tomatoes and squished them by hand and added a little bit of the juice.

We really liked this.  Easy to make.  Used cut tomatoes instead of stewed tomatoes because that is what I had.  I let them cook by themself for 10 to 15 minutes to get a softer texture.  Sprinkled with parmasean cheese when serving. Thank you.

good.  needed a little salt. (Jim and Amanda used Lawry's).  I did cook the macaroni separately and added the cooked pasta to the meat at the end.  I also used tomato sauce instead of paste since I had some in the fridge.

I would cook the noodle separately and cook onion with beef while browning. I also used Italian paste instead of tomato paste. I liked it but was not crazy about it.

It is a perfect winter dish, warm and filling.  We put grated cheese on top.  I use half pound of ground beef and half a pound of sausage.  Easy dish to make.

A good, hearty Meal.  I added chopped green  pepper and zucchini to make it a one pot meal and did cook the pasta separately as others suggested.     Will make again.

I followed this recipe exactly and it came out great.  The macaroni was cooked before I realized it was cooked, but I caught it before it became mushy.  I love the ratio of simplicity of the ingredients, all of which are easy to keep on hand, compared to the complexity and universal appeal of the flavor, which was high.  Even my two-year-old, who does not usually care for pasta with marinara or meat sauce, asked for three helpings of this and devoured them all.  This is going into the regular rotation for sure.  I'll have to load up on chili powder and paprika the next time I hit a co-op!  NOTE:  I plan to try to sneak vegetables in here next time and see how that goes.  I'm thinking a cup of steamed carrot and spinach puree, and some diced bell pepper.  It works with meatloaf, so I figure I'll give it a try here.  Excellent recipe as-is, though!  Thank you.

I think it's a fine goulash.  For once, I didn't change the recipe and made it exactly as stated.  Just now tasted it and am reminded of when I was a kid.  I don't think anything needs changing.

It was a cheap easy meal that filled our bellies. Other than that though, it was not anything to rave about. I cooked the pasta separately and added a few more spices and it was still bland. We are happy to be full, but I won't be making this for company.

I made this with 1 1/2 lbs of venison burger, and 2-3 Cups of cooked wheat macaroni. I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes and 6oz of tomato paste. I also added a can of kidney beans, and a sprinkling of white pepper and a dash of salt.   YUM,  YUM,  YUM!!!    If I could have made a bathtub full, I'd have been as happy as a pig in slop!

I used 1 - 14.5 ounce can stewed tomatoes and 1 - 15 ounce can tomato sauce. I omitted the garlic and tomato paste. I added 3/4 cup water. I would absolutely make this again. Delicious and fast!

I only gave it 4 starts due to me adding/changing a couple of things. I used less paprika, more chili powder and added some green pepper to it.  I also less stewed tomatoes.  The tomato paste is a must for me.  It had a lot of flavor!  You definately want to cook the macaroni seperately.

This was okay for beginning, but I have always cooked noodles in a seperate pan! Instead of tomatoes I used a cup of Ketchup and added green pepper and garlic powder along with some cheyenne powder for a bit of a kick. Kids needed some extra water but hubby really liked it!

This is the first recipe that I've rated this low.
This is a basic meal and easy to prepare but has no flavour.  I cooked the pasta separately and didn't add the tomato paste.  To give it some taste, I had to add some super hot sauce I bought while in New Orleans.

Great recipe without any modifications. However, if you leave out the noodles and onion, and adjust the quantities right this is an outstanding/excellent meal for folks on the HCG diet.... beef, tomato, spices, simple and after weeks of chicken and fish this is a welcome change and excellent taste.

We made a few modifications -- added 1 1/2 cups water, used diced tomatoes and tomato sauce, added cumin and italian seasoning, and most importantly, cooked pasta separately.  Topped with fresh grated parmesean cheese. Overall a wonderful, simple dish.  We will definitely cook this again and again.

You can use any type of bite sized noodle. I follow the recipe to get the base, but then I add a little bit of each of the spices to meet my taste.

This was o.k. I made a few changes, I used cloves garlic and added some cumin. I also cooked the pasta seperatly. I cooked the garlic, and onion with the meat and also added salt and pepper. Once that was done I used diced stewed tomatoes which I mashed so it wouldn't be so chucky. I'm going to make this again only I'm going to fiddle with the recipe.

Used pureed fire-roasted tomatoes instead of tomato sauce and rotel instead of diced. Really good flavor, maybe needs a little more spices. It would be easy to sneak in veggies and no one would realize it.

This was ok. I actually added some corn and used one can of rotel instead of the tomatoes. Tomatoe sauce instead of paste.  Not bad but nothing great actually. Will only make again in a pinch.

This is a great base goulash recipe, but if you make it exactly to the recipe it's very bland. I used a 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes and a 14.5 oz can of kidney beans, both undrained. For the pasta I used 2 cups of medium egg noodles, cooked with the mixture for about 15 minutes. Needed LOTS of seasoning.

AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME recipe. It was rediculously fast and easy to make, delcious and filling. A quick fave amongst my friends and a perfect comfort food for a chilly night. My only changes was: I used 28 oz. of diced tomatoes, not 32 oz. of stewed. A tsp more of the chilli powder A dash of salt

By making this recipe as instructed, I would give this a 2. We wish we would have read the reviews first and cooked the pasta separately. It burned the bottom of the pan and was mushy and pasty. It was very bland also so we recommend adding more seasoning. If we were to have made this recipe from the tips in the reviews, this would have been a lot better I think. We probably won't make this again.

Needed doctoring... Cooked noodles separately. Cooked ground beef with onion, garlic, salt and pepper til no longer pink then added 2 pints diced tomatoes, 2-3 tsp paprika, 1 1/2 tbsp chili powder, small can of tomato paste, some basil, garlic salt, italian seasoning, a can of corn and a can of condensed tomato soup. Was pretty good with the alterations. Great starter though - thanks!

2 stars because I had to revise it to suit my taste. I followed the ingredients/directions  (except I boiled my pasta separately), I tasted the sauce, and it seemed bland... That and the paprika made the taste sweet-ish and a little weird. So I had to revise it because I couldn't serve THAT to my family... So I added literally a palm full of kosher salt, a palm full of black pepper, a half a palm full of garlic powder, and mixed in 2 cups of grated four cheese blend... With the additions, it was edible. I would make this again ONLY BECAUSE it was easy, and only if I was starving and out of $ for take-out :(

My mother has been makign this for as long as I can remember. Perfect for cold winter days! Cook the pasta seperate....very odd to cook pasta in the mixture. If you dont want to use tomato paste just add a small can of tomato sauce and a little water if it seems to thick. I normally make this without the extra spicy seasonings. It tastes great with just a little S and P.  The smell of this cooking is to die for. Serve wtih french bread! Yummy.

Sooooo good! As another reviewer suggested, I cooked the pasta seperately. I used 14.5 oz petite dice tomatoes, 8 oz tomatoe sauce, no stewed tomatoes or paste. Spices were the same plus salt and pepper. This will be added to my rotation!

It was a great receipe I just added a few other touches to my taste. I added a can of corn and a can of carrots and I also used some Garlic powder to liven it up a bit. I also used some tips from other reviews. My family just loved it and my picky 5 yr. old eat every bit in his plate. Over all I was very happy. One more thing I did replace the stewed tomatoes with canned diced tomatoes and I cooked the pasta by its self and then added it later. Tasted great!

Nothing like my moms old goulash.  Much better and so easy. I like the chili/spaghetti flavor of it.  Of course I sprinkled cheese on top and it turned out really good.

I used wheat noodles and added 1 cup of water to the meat mixture when I added the noodles. Came out fine cooking the noodles with the rest of the ingredients.

This didn't really "wow" anyone in my household.  I made this as instructed, but it lacked flavor/spices.  I added some more chili powder and some garlic powder and a dash of italian seasoning, but since this is my first time making goulash, I didn't want to take a chance and overspice it.

I did do another twist on this recipe to "Kick it up a notch" as Emeril says I put an envelope of taco seasoning and used diced tomatoes with chili peppers. I cooked the pasta seperately and followed the suggestion to put shredded cheese on it then bake until cheese is melted! Fabulous!

This was excellent.  I changed just a few things, added 1/2 can of corn, 1/4 cup chopped green pepper and used garlic tomatoe paste instead.  Also added 1 teaspoon of pepper and basil and 1/2 teaspoon of garlic salt.

I added extra spices to this too, I tasted it as is and it was pretty bland and tomato-y. So I added a good amount of garlic and onion salt, and a packet of chili seasoning to the meat!! It was very, very good.

My husband liked this recipe as is, but the other three of us in the family thought it was too bland, so majority rules.  I had to add about a 1/4 c. of spaghetti sauce to it so that it'd be edible. I added a significant amount of salt and pepper above what the recipe calls for. I don't recommend this recipe without some finaggling.

Really enjoyed the flavor combination. I did up the Paprika and Chili Powder quite a bit (we like spicy). The macaroni turned out fine cooking it in the meat sauce. Just cook on low and don't let it cook too long.

Very easy and delicious recipe.  Tastes great with some shredded cheddar cheese on top.  This recipe is rather spicy for me so I cut back on the paprika and chili powder.

This goulash tasted just like Grandma made when I was a teenager. We really enjoyed it. We added a cup of diced green pepper, and added a cup of milk. this made the recipe creamy and smooth. Our family believes this is a keeper.

The only change that I made that I added some chicken broth to thin it down a little. My entire family loved this recipe. They all went back for seconds and also said how much they liked it. Very unusual around my house, so I will be making this one again. Thanks for a great recipe!!!

pre-cooked the macaroni. Added chili powder 1.5tsp, and my husband spiced it to taste. Added celery/green pepper/onion tomatos. We also added some potatoes as my family loves them. I precooked the pototo's that were chopped up for 15 min. Put everything in a pot on the stove.

I'm not much of a goulash fan, but this was pretty good. It definately tasted better next day.  I made a few changes because I didn't have all the ingrdients on hand.  Instead of stewed tomatoes, I used diced.  I also didn't have any chili powder, so I used the Meixcan seasoning I had.  I only used half the can of tomato paste.  I used elbow noodles...but next time I will use a larger noodle because the little noodles kind of got lost in the mixture.  My husband LOVED it.

This was very good.  Only change I made was I replaced the paste with tomato soup.  I like it with a little less tomato flavor and this helps it from being so rich.

This was good with a little tweaking.  Husband and toddler both loved it!  I agree with other reviewers - cook the macaroni first before adding it.  Mine turned out really really spicy hot for some reason - maybe the type of chili powder I used? Next time I'll add the spices little by little so I don't overdo it.

I made this recipe for the first time exactly as written and I have to agree with several other reviewers that cooking the pasta with the meat mixture doesn't really work as their isn't enough liquid to ensure that the pasta cooks completely. I had to repeatedly add water to give the pasta enough time to cook.  I tasted the dish w/o the tomato paste and it was very blah in flavor.  After adding the tomato paste and some additional liquid the flavor was better, but could still use something to liven it up.  We happen to love fresh cracked pepper so we loaded that into the dish which helped.  I'm going to give this another shot, but I'll cook the pasta seperately and add some additional seasonings to the next batch and see how that works.  My husband suggested adding some cheese to the mix, so perhaps we'll try that.

Recipe was easy to follow and quick.  Ingredients on hand and nothing that comes from a specialty store.  I cooked the noodles as recommended and they had a weird chewiness to them, not from being under cooked.  Not too bland for me as some readers suggested, but I now know I HATE tomato paste.  I will not add it again and maybe it will be better.

Edit:  I made this again without tomato paste and now it deserves 4 stars.  So much better.

I didn't care for this at all.  I thought it was too bland.  I cooked the macaroni separately as it didn't seem like enough cooking liquid in the recipe.  I added a bit of brown sugar to boost the flavor.  The only reason I gave it 3 stars was because I took it to a potluck and got a couple compliments on it.

added yellow squash--i liked it, when i asked dh if it was a keeper he said 'well, was it easy'?  goulash probably isn't his style to begin with.

My husband and I really like this recipe.  I like that is only uses one pan and it tastes good.  I always use diced tomatoes instead of stewed.  I also like the versatility of the recipe.  I'll sometimes substitute chicken for beef and use a can of rotel, add some black beans and cheddar cheese and have a tex-mex dish.  Or, use sausage, penne pasta, and Italian seasoning for an Italian dish.

My family and I  thought this was very good. I used 2 14.5 oz cans of tomatoes and half of the paste. I also added a dash of salt. Served with premade bread stick twists that I tweaked w/melted butter, parm cheese and garlic powder. Yum

My version was a four (or less) but I think due to the canned stewed tomatoes used.  So I'm rating as a five.  Only recently realized that many canned tomatoes have added sugar.  I will try again with different tomatoes.

I really enjoyed this dish.  I did make some minor alterations.  I cooked the ground beef with the onion and garlic.  I added about a teaspoon of extra garlic.  I added a little extra chili powder and a dash of onion powder.  I think the teaspoon of cumin really put if over the top!

We had fair results with this recipe, but only with major additions. As others have stated, the flavor is quite bland as is. The pasta was cooked separately until just before al dente, then added to the pot to finish cooking. After sauteeing the onions and garlic, I added the dry spices and some Italian seasoning over the heat to bring out their flavors, and then the tomato paste before pouring in the stewed tomatoes and some beef broth. To serve the dish, a grated hard cheese such as parmesan or grana padano works well.

Fast, easy and delicious.  I used whole wheat pasta and so added a 15 oz can of tomato sauce and about 1/4 cup water, but made no other changes.  The spices seemed just right to us.  Everyone gobbled it up... even our three-year-old.

Very good, easy to prepare dish!  Like everyone else, I made my own changes: I didn't have quite enough stewed tomatoes, so I added some tomato sauce to make enough liquid. Since I left out the chili seasonings and cayenne for those family members who don't like spicy foods, I added one cup of Velveeta and one half of a beef buillion cube dissolved in  3T.  hot water.
It turned out great!

I made with ground moose meat.  Added 8 ounces tomato sauce and 8 ounces of water cause it was too dry.  Tasted great dry!  Have to try again tomorrow.  I used one package of chili mix rather than chili power and one stalk of celery diced and one carrot diced.

Really a great starter recipe. I added some basil, oregano, and parsley as well as using Italian herb stewed tomatoes and it came out fantastic, just a little salt and pepper and it was done before I knew it. Thank you for the great recipe!

A quintessential comfort food - Goulash is a favorite in our house, among all ages.  This is exceptionally easy to prepare, and provides very good left over's.  I generally stick to the recipe, although I sometimes add a little ground pork for a slightly different flavor.

The whole family loved this, and it was very quick and easy. Changes I made: added one 14 oz can of corn, with the water. Added small can of fire roasted chilis. Added a tsp each of oregano, basil, parsley. I cooked the noodles first and added them at the end, then simmered. Served with cornbread and salad. Excellent!

This was just OK.  I have to say though that adding the tomato paste was definitely not the way to go.  It wasn't tasting too bad, then I added the tomato paste, and it pretty much ruined the whole thing.

Very good, but the tomato paste made it a bit thick, next time 3 oz. I think.

Overall this was a good recipe, however it did taste a bit bland and we had to jazz it up a bit with extra seasonings. Next time I will add more chili seasoning and paprika to get more flavor.

Overall, a good recipe, but lacking flavor. I had to add catsup and some tabasco after cooking. Next time (and there WILL be a next time)will add before cooking.That gave it the zip it needed. Good recipe.     ...ELFHELP...

I make this recipe often.  It's my husband and sons' favorite.  In fact I usually have to triple the recipe since my son will eat a whole batch for himself.  It's a bit spicy for little ones, but teenage boys and husbands are gonna love it.

It was okay, except my family didn't like the sweetness of the stewed tomatoes.

Recipe was easy, I used both Stewed tomatoes & Tomato paste.  I thought it had a tart aftertaste...so, I added 2 Tbsp Brown Sugar, and some salt, and it was much sweeter.  Great Recipe!!!

Not bad, but it could be better.  Just too much chili powder.  Needs something more to give it a little kick, but the chili powder doesn't do it.  That's all we could taste.  Probably won't make again without making several changes to get the taste right.

This is really a good quick fix meal for after a long work day. My grown children loved it when they were at home and the other night I showed up at my sons home at dinner time and he said ....'join us Mom I am making a great old standby' It was nice to see it being gobbled up by his children like he use to do.

I also made a few changes.  I used 1/2 ground turkey and 1/2 beef.  I threw in a can of Chicken Gumbo Soup and some tomato sauce in place of the paste.  I also added some "Hot & Spicy" seasoning to give it a kick.  It was great!

This was delicious.  My husband made it and my family made "happy plates"!  He added zucchini and corn which are always big hits in our family.  We will add this to our list of things we make often.

I added grated cheese on top to make it more kid friendly.  It went over well.
