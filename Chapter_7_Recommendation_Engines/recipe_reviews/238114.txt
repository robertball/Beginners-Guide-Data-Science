These were great! Had some leftover Salmon and wanted something to do with it. Made them for a friend and we both really liked them. Will definitely make them often with leftover salmon. They were super quick to throw together and the only thing I did differently was add about a tablespoon or so of dijon mustard. Glad I tried this one!

Hubby loved it so it gets 5 stars. (No seafood for this girl). After reading the reviews I just added a few spices that hubby enjoys. Onion powder, garlic, 1 heaping tsp red pepper flakes.  I did use. 14 oz  can salmon with 2 eggs and 20ish crackers.  I did have to toss in a tbsp flour to make them less gooey for handling. Thank you.

I used this recipe tonight for dinner (for two), and it was delish!! I used some fresh cooked salmon I had left from dinner the other night, which worked perfectly.
I will definitely make this one again!

I really liked this but next time will use some Old Bay seasoning and less crackers (I used about 10). Hint: Be careful of the heat. Mine was a little too high.

I added 1tsp ground cumin because I love cumin, and after making it I now think it might have been a little too plain without it (which is why I gave four stars). This is a good basic recipe to work from.

Very tasty. I chose this recipe because of the ease and the minimal ingredients as opposed to the other salmon cake recipes on this site.  I used two 14 oz cans of salmon but I only used 2 eggs (instead of 4). If I had used 4 it would have been too guey. You will have to spot this recipe in terms of how much crackers (for consistency) vs. pepper (how much spice) vs. how much egg (how moist) to your liking. Nonetheless, my family ate it with pasta and corn. Very quick and easy dinner which is always a winner in my book.

Excellent recipe! I substituted the salmon for a 5.5 oz can of Grace Mackerel in tomato sauce. I used everything in the can. In addition I had no crackers so I substituted that for 1/4 cup of breadcrumbs. Used lime juice as I had no lemons. My husband and I loved it! Will definitely try this again.

These were great.  Made enough for four people.  Next time I will add 1/2 tsp. Old bay seasoning.  Delicious and will definitely make again.

I  had leftover salmon from a lunch at a Red Robin restaurant. I needed to use the salmon and broccoli to make them soft so that I could eat them properly. 
 So my recipe is made with salmon that is already baked.  The only other change I made was to use hoagie oil adding a little spice to the salmon. This recipe softened the salmon so that I could more easily eat them.  I steamed the broccoli adding some water to soften them. This was delicious!!!

Had most of can leftover and needed used, didn’t really measure any ingredients just guestimated. Turned out really good, probably the best salmon cakes I’ve ever had. Threw on to some toasted bread with mustard. Hopefully next time I’ll have some potato rolls available. I also used store bought bread crumbs instead of crackers.

Recipe is perfect! Followed it to a T. Only substituted Olive Oil for the Vegetable Oil.   Wouldn't change anything else. The whole family loved it. :)

I used a shallot instead of onion and did not make the sauce but used a bottled lemon, dill, butter sauce because it was for our lunch. Also, used fresh salmon I had left over from dinner last night.  It was the best I have ever eaten.

This was great! I only had a 5 oz. package of chicken of the sea salmon on hand, so I used that, and made only 2 patties with 1/2 onion diced, 1/3 c. bread crumbs and 1 tsp. lemon juice. I didn't use butter in the mixture but fried the patties in 1 tbsp of butter. I like the idea of a little Dijon too.
