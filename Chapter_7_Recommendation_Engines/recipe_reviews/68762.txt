I made a huge batch of this for a Halloween party last year and made the following additions:  sliced up one green apple, punched out a hole with a thermometer sleeve, and threaded a gummy worm through the hole of each apple slice. Added the apple slices and food grade dry ice to the punch and it looked and tasted amazing. Everyone was standing around the punch bowl all night! This will definitely be my signature Halloween party punch.

Very enjoyable drink...went down very easily. I made a "spiced apple" for hubby as he is a goldschlager fan. After tasting his & tasting mine, I added  1/2 an ounce of goldschlager to mine too. It adds a very nice cinnamony flavor. Thansk ToniaRenee!

Really delicious, like a candy apple. I added more vodka/schnapps (3oz total) to the soda and might up it to 4oz in the future, but that's a matter of preference and tolerance. Thanks very much for sharing.

Bf didn't think I'd like this--not a big vodka fan, but I did like it.  He's my drink maker so he made it for me.  I think I like the vanilla flavored vodka better than regular.  My only complaint--and this is personal preference--is I don't like ice in my drinks.  Something I'd be happy to make again (or let bf make again) without the ice.

wellllll...sorry to be the party pooper here.  but I just didnt care for this.  The flavors for me clashed together with the lemon lime soda.  And I didnt taste the apple flavor at all.  I think I would of liked it better with pineapple juice instead of soda.  I think that would of let the apple flavor thru more.  Thanks for the recipe tho!  I always enjoy making a new cocktail!

I used this recipe for my Halloween party punch and got compliments on it all night!.. I did, however, make a few alterations. Instead of the 1:1:4 ratio, I used a 1:1:3 and the punch tasted perfect. I also left out the grenadine syrup, but added gummy worms and apple slices for effect. I think the additions really added a little extra "OoOomph" to the look of the punch. Truly a delicious recipe and one that I would recommend to anyone!

This was pretty good. I didn't have any grenadine so I left it out.

This was awesome!  I multiplied the ingredients by 4 to make this a punch for friends and we absolutely loved it.

Really good. I added just a little more Smirnoff vodka, just for my taste. 

I'd make this again. And again. ;)

I made this for a girls weekend away.  I was not impressed at all.  It got such good reviews, maybe my hopes were to high.  I do not think I would make this one again.  Sorry!

Love these!  I'd been looking for a recipe that used green apple sourpuss and this filled the bill!  Beware, it is easy to get carried away!!

This stuff is fun to make and looks cool in an old fashioned glass with the red swirling around.  It even tastes great, but they ctach up on you!

Excellent! The alcohol taste is very subtle, which I like. The sour apple taste covers up the vodka....although vanilla vodka is pretty easy on the palette anyway.

This taste like a candied apple.  This one is definitely a keeper and will be used as a treat this Halloween!
