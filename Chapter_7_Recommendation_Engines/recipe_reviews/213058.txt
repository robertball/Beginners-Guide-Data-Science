This bread had a lovely flavor and was very easy to make.  There seems to be something wrong with the time allowed for rising.  It rose very little in the half hour given in the recipe.  To have the correct lightness of a Panettone it will require at least 2 hours for rising.

Sorry, yes, the recipe yields a slow-rising dough. 30 minutes will yield a thick, cake-like bread. 2 hours - as you said - should be enough for those loyal to lighter Panettone breads.

Sam can this recipe be done only in oven or does it have to be used with a bread maker?

I tweaked this so it is lower fat and almondine:  Eliminated the rum & vanilla extract.  Used 1/4 c + 1/4 teaspoon Amaretto to soak the raisins in, adding the liquid to the first mix.  Reduced the salt to 1/2 teaspoon so maybe it would rise better.  To cut fat, I replaced the milk and cream with nonfat 1/2 and 1/2.

It needed more than 3 cups of flour to keep it from being too sticky, so I added another 1/2 cup.  I also stuck tiny marzipan clumps in when folding the dough into the pans for rising.

Turned out delicious!

I had a lot of trouble with this bread.  I followed the directions exactly.  It was so slow to rise that I left it overnight - it rose a bit.  I baked it, in the oven,  35 min and it rose a bit more, but was not cooked.  Another 20 minutes made it less soggy. It turned out a dense brick - flavor ok, but nothing I would make again.

Definitely has a nice flavor. I replaced the lemon zest with orange zest and used mostly citrus candied fruit. Didn't have the cream so substituted it with kefir milk which is a lot like buttermilk. This is a slow rising dough. I left mine to rise for over 2 hours and it still didn't rise much. Baked it an extra 10 minutes and expected a hard brick but to my surprise it turned out to be perfectly baked. Enjoying it slightly toasted with butter or margarine with my morning coffee. Would make again!

the flavor is okay, but it will not rise for just 30 mins. I tried it again to let rise for at least an hour and still didn't rise much maybe it should be overnight. I will try it next time to just bake it in my bread machine completely and not in the oven.

Made this today, with just so so results. I did let it rise for about 90 minutes, but it fell and the bottom, when baked, was quite soggy.
