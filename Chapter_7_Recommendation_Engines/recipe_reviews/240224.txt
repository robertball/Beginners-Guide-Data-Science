I loved the chocolate mixture and would definitely try this again with a more crisp cereal like rice krispies or cornflakes. The puffed wheat became chewy and tasted bland with the chocolate. Although I must say (yes I know how this sounds ;) the flavour improved by the second and third one! The kids loved them, but then they would eat just about anything, if it was smeared in chocolate!

I only used 10 cups of cereal and wound up with a dry overly cocoa'd pan in the end
