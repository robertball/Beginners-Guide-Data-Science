This is good.  A nice change from the classic.  It's best with garden fresh tomatoes, basil & peppers!  Nice bite to it, thanks Mindy & Eric!

serrano peppers are what 4-5 times hotter than the jalapeno?  This is just a little too hot for most of my guests and family.

When I made this I had a few different types of peppers on hand.  Some habaneros, Anaheim chile,banana peppers as well as just some simple yellow sweet bells.  That way people could pick their spice level.

Personaly I like the habernero on this but habaneros are way too hot for most.

I love all the ingredients in this little version of grilled cheese so I knew it would be a winner. I used banana peppers from the jar and they gave the sandwich just the right amount a kick. Thank you!

These were a tasty spin on the original. My husband has requested them a few times since. Prep is impotrant for getting these just right. Slice everything quite thin so that the cheese can melt to keep them together.

Not bad. I didn't have any serrano peppers so I went with bell. Also couldn't find the basil so I used an Italian spice.  Loved the spice but I could do without the peppers. My brother loved it!

Yum! I used a single roma tomato, thinly sliced, and I sliced the serrano pepper lengthwise and just put the halves on the sandwich. A nice change from the everyday grilled cheese.

It's a great update on an old favorite.

I loved this!!!  (My 2 and 3 year old, not so much, but that was to be expected)  Used jalapeno instead of serrano as I was told they're similar.  Next time I will slice the cheese thinner and put it on both sides of the tomato because I didn't really like the tomato next to the bread - made it soggy, but that is just nit-picking. This was delish!!

I am NEVER, EVER eating a traditional grilled cheese again! These are wonderful. I love the flavor of the peppers and the basil... Mmmmm.

Just a note to those who are afraid of the peppers... Don't even worry. I seeded the peppers thoroughly and chopped them, distributing them evenly on the bread, before placing the cheese on top of the bread so it melted in. There was no heat whatsoever. Just flavor. 

My daughter is so grateful for this find. She likes grilled cheese but was so tired of the same ol same ol. My husband asks for these all the time, as well. My son, who LOVES grilled cheese just the way they were also enjoys these.

My two year old, on the other hand, prefers them the way he's used to them so I make his with just cheese! :)

"The best toasted cheese sandwich I have ever eaten!"  A direct quote from my husband - - I think he liked this recipe!  I used marinated roasted red peppers instead of the serrano peppers.  I also had HUGE basil leaves from my garden so I just laid them whole on the tomatoes. Thank you so much for the delicious recipe, Mindy.  It's a knockout!

It was pretty good. Seed the serranos if you don't want all the spice. I left mine in because I really enjoy spicy food.

Excellent grilled cheese. I added 2 slices of bacon and fresh banana peppers instead of serrano peppers. Spicy with a great grilled cheese taste.

I made one sandwich with cheddar and one with mozzarella. The cheddar was yummy but the mozzarella turned out MUCH better! I will definitely be making these again.

Great twist on the classic grilled cheese.  Peppers are an inspired addition.  Used fresh basil because I had it on hand.  Great recipe!

Nice, taste, simple and quick. I did not have any dry basil so put Italian seasoning instead and worked well. We will be eating this again. Thank you.

This was pretty good. Different from the classic because of the crunch. I forgot to add the basil, so that could be why it was a little more bland than I thought it would be.

I ended up throwing the peppers and tomato into a food processor and draining out the liquids.  It made a sandwich that stayed together better and the entire tomato didn't slide out if you didn't bite all the way through it.

This was so good.  It never occured to me to put something in my grilled cheese sandwich other than cheese!  Instead of basil, I used a bit of pesto sauce.  Yummy!  I'll definitely make this again.

I enjoyed the flavor of this sandwich.  I used sweet bell peppers, but adding jalepeno would really add that extra kick the sandwich needs.  Don't be afraid to use a bit more basil...it adds a lot of flavor too.

At least I can understand why THIS grilled cheese recipe is listed online (can't understand about the classic version though)! I have made GC lots of times with fresh tomato and basil, but the hot pepper is a nice new idea.

Hubby and I made this together tonight with Tomato and Basil Soup on this site. Hubby liked the basil on the sandwich, saying it gave the sandwich a nice flavor. 
Although I like tomato in my grilled cheese, hubby tried it, but decided it was just okay...although he said it may be better wtih homegrown tomatos... the ones we had did not have much flavor...

I love grilled cheese and this is a great change of pace.  I use gluten-free bread and cheese and eliminate the peppers and it still tastes VERY GOOD.

this was really good! i added grilled onion and a slice of provolone along with the cheddar. i'm not a big fan of tomatoes so i left them off of mine, but i could tell it was lacking something. when i tasted my boyfriends with the tomatoes it was great! definitely a keeper, i might try adding some turkey slices next time!

Very good. Didn't have peppers, but used jalapenos a couple times.

Yum. Only change would be in prep. I butter one side of each slice then turn the bread over and add cheese, etc., so both sides of the bread are toasted. The spray ' I can't believe it's not butter' is perfect for this task.  Put a lid on the pan at the end to finish/melt the cheese.

Sounds phenomenal.  I know it's not in the ingredients list, but DO NOT add any extra Italian herbs and spices (DO include the basil) to this recipe, you'll regret it.  Also, don't skimp on the black pepper.  It's what makes this sandwich a real winner.
