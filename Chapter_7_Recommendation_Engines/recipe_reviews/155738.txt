this is seriously amazing.  i made some revisions (no confectioners' sugar and not mixing the amaretto in until the drink was poured) but otherwise AWESOME!

Very good, but very sweet.  Try salting the rim, it adds a bit of contrast to the sweet.

I, too, scaled it down to 1 and it scaled perfectly, altho, I tend to eyeball amounts & probably erred a little on the plus size. (For the record, the division scales down to 1.25 oz each of amaretto & tequila & half an oz of orange liqueur (I used Grand Marnier. Will try it with Triple Sec next time) I'm not sure with an almost 1:1 ratio of s&s to alcohol, anyone cannot taste the alcohol.).  I also used granulated sugar instead of confectioners.  I like texture/sweetness level better.

I really liked this drink! Scaled it down to one serving and added a little extra crushed ice. I will make this again.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

This doesn't scale down well - I was hardly able to taste the alcohol.  Overpowered by the sweet and sour mix. Thanks for letting me try.

I didnâ€™t use the powdered sugar around the rim- I prefer salt.  It was delicious and a huge hit with my friends too!

This recipe is delicious! Choose the  sweet/sour mix carefully. I used an organic brand sweetened with agave. This recipe makes about 5 margaritas. It was perfect!

Extremely sweet...I made it for a party and we had to cut it with club soda.
