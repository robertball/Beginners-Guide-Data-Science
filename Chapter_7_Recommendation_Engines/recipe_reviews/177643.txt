I like the concept but I think a little cooked ground beef or finely, shredded cooked chicken, and Jack cheese, would be good.

I gave it 4 stars because I made some changes.  I used "Mexican Mix" shredded cheese and added pepper jack.  Instead of olives I used jalapenos and I didn't use the egg mixture to close the triangles.  They were very spicy and good!

You have to make sure to seal these really well. I thought I did, but as the pastry cooked, the cheese leaked out, leaving hardly any in there. :( But a great idea.

Really dry!  Needs some sort of meat like sausage or ground beef would have been better.  Too much work for what you get

These tasted good, but the result wasn't worth the work. I've tried making them twice, the second time just to see if I could go on what I'd learned from the first, but they were only slightly better. It's very difficult to get the edges sealed well enough that the cheese doesn't leak out, and when it does, it burns and then they're not nearly as pretty as the picture. I brought them to a Superbowl party the first time I made them, and despite their weird (leaked) appearance, they did get gobbled up pretty quickly, once people realized that they tasted pretty good. I do like them, but doubt I'll be trying them again.

Not worth dealing with the pastry imo.  Good idea though.
