Love this recipe!  I'm sure it was a great recipe as is, but to bump of the "health factor" a bit I made some substitutions that worked well. I know that drives some people crazy to change a recipe all around, but if it helps to tweak it, WHY NOT!?  This way there's a healthier version to play with.  Instead of all the butter I only used 1/4 cup of butter and added applesauce.  Then I only used 1 cup of brown sugar.  When I mixed in all the PB etc. I added one big banana too.  I put in 1 and 1/2 cups of raisins because we like them and heated up 1/2 cup apple juice to let the raisins soak in and then I used that "raisin water" in place of the water called for in the recipe.  I also added 1/3 cup of ground flax to give it some more good stuff.  We eat them in the afternoon for a healthy snack or when we're running out the door on a busy morning.

I love these cookies, they're not very sweet and they're good for breakfast or snack.  Don't let the calorie section scare you, I made 27 cookies from one recipe and I used my ice cream scoop and when I measured how much dough the scoop holds it's 1/4 cup (that would make one serving 2 cookies plus like a bite of another cookie, one fills me up just fine).  BUT I make mine healthier and it's moist and holds together well and has to be less calories.  Here's what I did...no butter, add 1 c applesauce (unsweetened), used 1/2 c honey and 1/2 c brown sugar (in place of all the brown sugar), I also used all whole wheat flour and craisins (instead of raisins) - it's sooo good.  If you like a heartier cookie I'd use rolled oats, quick oats make a softer cookie - both are yummy.  If you like crunch in your cookies I think sunflower seeds would be great in them.  They also freeze well, plus I've made them with soy butter for an allergic child, it's a little drier but still good.

LOVE IT!!  I'm a full-time mom and full-time student, so meals aren't really a priority in my life.  These are so quick and easy to make, package in servings, throw in the freezer, and pull out in the morning.  Toss some in my backpack and I'm set for the day.  I shortened the baking time to 15 min. so they'd be a bit chewier, and substituted choc. chips for the raisins to get my son to eat them.  I love getting to be a cool mom and letting him eat cookies for breakfast.  Thanks!!

I have been searching for just the right "healthy" cookie recipe for a long time.  Usually I make "Ranger cookies" that have lots of good-for-you fillers but tend to be dry and crumble easily.  This recipe just became my favorite!  I like to bake things with nutritional value but ... really what makes a cookie a cookie is fat and sugar.  A "health" cookie made with no fat, honey to sweeten and no eggs honestly isn't very satisfying.  This cookie gives me a real "cookie fix" yet is versatile enough to be quite nutritional.  
I used natural peanut butter, substituted 4 egg whites for the 2 eggs (best to buy carton of pure egg whites), added 1/4 cup skim milk powder with the water, used all whole wheat flour (2 cups), and stirred in 1 c raisins, 1/2 cup mini choc chips, 1/2 cup chopped dates, 1 cup chopped walnuts.  The dough is chunky so it helps to flatten it a little (to 1" thick or so).  Also, I found they only needed about 15 min or less to bake -- they turned out slightly browned with firm tops but inside they were surprisingly "light"and soft.  I used a wire wisk to beat the butter mixture and  to add the whites and water.  This may have helped.  I also would try adding dried cranberries, and other nuts & seeds.  
I must say, I liked the results of this recipe so much that I have singlehandedly polished off 1/2 of the cookies in less than a week!   
May have to change the name to:
 "Hearty Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner Cookies"

I have never felt compelled to rate one of these recipes before, but these cookies are the best thing I've found here!  I replaced the cinnamon and raisins with chocolate chips and upped the percentage of whole wheat flour to white flour and used buttermilk powder with good results.  They freeze fabulously.  And...I've gotten several requests for the recipe - one from a mom whose kids don't even believe in anything remotely resembling healthy food!  Thanks for a great recipe!

What a great recipe.  I'm a grad student, so I don't have a lot of time to cook elaborate meals, and I'm a vegetarian so I have to pay attention to protein.  This recipe is perfect: easy, yummy, protein-rich, and it produces really filling cookies.  I subsituted 1/4 cup of applesauce for half of the butter (to cut down on the fat a little and add some more nutrients), and I also substituted 1/2 cup chocolate chips for half of the raisins and I threw in about 1/3 cup chopped walnuts.  It's like trail mix in a cookie.  If these freeze well, I can see myself making this every two weeks or so and not having to worry about breakfast/lunch all semester.  Thanks so much for sharing this.
Update: I just have to add, these stayed soft and tasted fresh for over two weeks, without chilling or freezing.  I am so utterly impressed with this recipe.

Excellent breakfast cookies that tasted great and were easy to make.  I kept the batter in the fridge and baked them as I needed them... warm cookies in the morning, mmmmmm.

My husband loves to take breakfast to work vs. eating it at home because he gets up so early so I try to get creative. These "cookies" are great.  They came out very moist and freeze well.  Like others, I modified the recipe a bit.  I cut the recipe in half and used 1/2 c. of brown sugar and 2 Tbsp. of honey.  I used whole milk vs. water and 1 c. of all purpose flour.  I also used 3/4 c. of oats and 1/2 c. of grape nuts instead of wheat germ.  I also added 1/2 c. of chopped peanuts along with the raisins.  They baked up very nice and smelled great coming out of the oven.

These cookies are wonderful.  I have a hard time getting my 3rd grader to eat breakfast... now I just hand him a big cookie and he is thrilled.  I used applesauce in place of all of the butter and ground flax seed in place of the wheat germ. Great recipe.  Thank You.

I have just made these cookies and they have cooled down enough for a taste test.  I must say that, although I tweaked them to my own taste, they came out especially good.  I admit that I ‘borrowed ‘ideas from other reviewers, but I and M’Lady liked the finished product.  Here are the changed I made:  I used ½ applesauce for ½ the butter, I cup of brown sugar and about 1/3 cup honey, buttermilk for the liquid, ground flaxseed for the wheat germ, ½ cup of raisins and ¾ cup of chocolate chips.  I think I might try adding about 1 cup of chopped walnuts next time.

I've been making these for years ... don't know when they were posted, but it seems like years.  Tonight I made them with dark brown sugar, substituted ground flax seed for wheat germ, and added a cup of toasted chopped pecans and almost a cup of mini chocolate chips.  Baked for 12 minutes at 325 on full convection, and they are awesome.  I go back to these again and again when I want something with protein in the cookie jar!

Unfortunately, these did not go over well in my house.  They were dry, and I even added the banana like some suggested.  Using a measured scoop, mine only made about 20, so maybe they had to bake longer since they were bigger, therefore drying out.

I have made several recipes from this website, all 5 stars, and have never felt they were good enough to take the time to write.  But this one is worth the effort.  I made it exactly according to the recipe, using the suggested buttermilk alternative, except that I used Craisins instead of raisins.  It is awesome and simple and our daughter and son-in-law who were visiting just had to have the recipe.

Great cookies!  I added 3/4 cup of Smarties to the recipe, which my 2 1/2 year old loved.  They're not too sweet and actually great to grab when running out the door in the morning.

These are amazingly good! My batch made about four dozen, and I froze three bags thinking they would last a while.  I'm pretty sure my family had them eaten within about five days.  In place of the butter, I used one mashed banana and 1/4 cup applesauce. Added dried cranberries and chocolate chips, toasted almonds. Didn't have wheat germ on hand, so I ground up some Quaker Oats squares for a little crunch.  These were so soft and yummy...a healthy breakfast option or a healthy snack! Everyone in my house from age 13 mos to five to 32 loved them!

I added about 1/2 cup of applesauce to this and bake it in a 7 x 11 pan; then cut it into bars when it was cool. Very mosit and peanuty too. I also used crunchy peanut butter---that's all I had on hand.

This is a hit or miss with kids. My 1 yr. old liked it, but my 5 yr. old wouldn't touch it. I thought it was pretty good, but too fattening for me to eat for breakfast. I would suggest halving the recipe until you know if it will be a hit because it makes a lot of cookies. There is only so much a 1 yr. old can eat, so I ended up throwing away most of them.

These were great. I split the whole recipe in half though. Partly since I didn't want a lot and partly because I didn't have enough PB. Used only whole wheat flour, only a half cup of brown sugar, 1 1/2 tablespoons of butter, added 3/4 cup of wheat germ, put more cinnamon (because it's delicious), use rolled oats, and added half of banana. I placed them in huge chunks and they came out bulky, which was good. And they came out sweet but not too sweet. I will definitely make these again.

I agree that these cookies taste good...but they are in NO way a better alternative to pastries or doughnuts!  They are good, just don't think they are a healthy option. Sorry.

Great!  Three out of our four young kids like them, and the grownups like them with their coffee.  To adjust to our taste, we skipped the raisins and cinnamon and went with chocolate chips instead.  To make them healthier, we used Smart Balance butter sticks, reduced the sugar to 1 cup and added 1/3 cup of ground flax.  Yum.  We like them both made with water and made with buttermilk.

GREAT recipe. I tweaked it: not a big peanut butter fan, so I used 1/2 cup peanut butter and about 1 cup pumpkin, so I didn't need the extra liquid. I didn't have wheat germ so I added an extra 1/2 cup of finely chopped nuts. I used dried mixed fruit - raisins, dates, pineapple, mango, coconut, cherries, cranberries and apricots. I added about 1 cup of chopped mixed nuts. I also doubled the cinnamon and added about 1/2 tsp. freshly grated nutmeg. I made them slightly smaller and was able to get 17 big cookies out of the recipe; as such, they only baked for about 13 minutes. I would like to play around with this recipe to lower the fat and calories.. the nutrition info is the only drawback to this recipe. Also - I would suggest that as soon as these cookies cool, they should be stored in an airtight container, otherwise they dry out fairly quickly. Other than those drawbacks, this is a DEFINITE keeper!!

This is a great recipe!  I didn't have raisins, but I had currants (I know.. crazy, right?), and then because I am a chocolate addict, I added a small handful of mini-chocolate chips.  I did not change anything else.  A-MA-ZING.

Very good. Would suggest to drink milk or coffee (or coffee with milk) with the cookies. Would suggest less peanut butter in recipe and more sugar.

Very good, but I don't recommend using Simply Jif peanut butter.  It has 33% less sugar, so I think this recipe needs more sugar next time, unless I use regular peanut butter.  But overall, very tastey and healthy.  I didn't have wheat germ so I added more oatmeal.  I didn't have quick cooking oatmeal so I used the old fashioned kind and it turned out just fine!  I'll make this again - I need a change from the same 'ol same 'ol breakfast!

Great Breakfasty cookie!  I used the recipe as written, ONLY switching the mix-ins.  The texture is great and the flavor is super delicious and healthy.  It tastes more "health food" than "cookie."   It is not as sweet as a traditional cookie - I didn't feel guilty eating them for breakfast with a yogurt!

I used a whole bag of cranberries, 1/4 cup of flax seed and about 1/2 cup of pecans.  I did consider the wheat germ a mix-in and switched that to GrapeNuts cereal.  

OO might I suggest chunky peanutbutter for this.

OH, YUM!  I made these with2C whole wheat pastry flour, 1/4 C apple sauce and 1/4 C butter, and instead of rolled oats, I used rolled 5 grain cereal from the bulk foods section of my grocery store (rye, barley, wheat, oats) and pulsed them in the Cuisenart before adding.  Other than those modifications, I followed the recipe and they turned out great!

Love these cookies!  I had been looking for an alternative to purchased breakfast cookies (which I love).  So I tried these, this is the 2nd time I've made them.  This time I substituted a container of plain lowfat yogurt for the butter (last time I tried applesauce and they were too dry).  I also baked them a little less so they would stay a bit moister.  Added extra raisins and chocolate chips, and a little handful of coconut.  They are awesome!

Yes, I changed this up a bit.  But, they were delicious!  And, in spite of my forgetting to add the water, they still came out perfectly, I don't think I'll add it the next time I make them.  I followed the others advice--substituted 1/2 cup of honey for 1/2 of the brown sugar (this will also keep them a bit softer over the next couple of days) and I changed the raisins for chocolate chips, since only one of my three kids likes raisins.  I didn't have wheat germ, so I just didn't worry about it.  Plus, I like the idea of substituting some rice krispies for 1 cup of the oatmeal, so we did that.  Yummy!  My 4-year-old is polishing off hers right now, and I really enjoyed one with coffee.  Oh, and I came up with 30 cookies, which is good for us since I don't like to have so many calories in one serving.  (I think the original recipe assumes 2 cookies per serving, which may be fine for my tween boys who can consume many calories and still be thin as rails, but not for me or my hubby!)  Try em, and don't be afraid to mix them up a bit!

I have been making these cookies for a couple of years now. They are very filling and will actually hold a teenage boy over until lunch! I use buttermilk instead of water, add 1/2 cup ground flax seed, and replace raisins with chocolate chips(need something to attract the kids). Don't forget to flatten slightly because they don't really spread while baking. I bake mine for 18 minutes. Perfect!

I have never written a review before but have to say that these are a new favorite recipe.  My husband is never hungry when he leaves for work, but wants to eat when he gets there, so this gives us a healthy, delicious, portable breakfast for him to take with him.  The recipe is easily altered to suit your tastes; I like to mix up the fruit (i.e. 1 heaping cup chopped dates, figs, dried cherries) and can't wait to try it with apricots. Also great with a handful of chopped nuts thrown in. We'll use this recipe again and again!

These aren't bad!  I used a 'cookie' size scoop and got 4 dozen cookies.  1-2 of the smaller size work fine.  Followed recipe very close with the only change reducing brown sugar to 1 cup.  These are not very sweet.  Will make again - but, maybe add craisins for a sharper taste, and more cinnamon.  Great little snack before sports practice or a work out.

Great for when you don't want to feel so guilty about eating a cookie. Use your imagination when adding the 'extras' to this recipe: I have used chocolate chips; dried cherries or blueberries with white chocolate chips; today I am trying shredded apples with toasted pecans (out of walnuts). (For this, I shredded the apples then squeezed the extra juice from them, plus added a touch of nutmeg & allspice with the cinnamon. Can't wait to try them, 'cuz the dough is tasty! Also, I am letting the dough 'rest' in the fridge for an hour or so. I heard this gives all cookies an even better texture.

FANTASTIC!  I go to sleep excited knowing I get to eat this for breakfast, now how bad is that!  I substituted applesauce instead of butter and did not miss the butter - that also made them a little more soft.  Off to the freezer they went.  Instead of egg, I also did a "flaxseed" egg.

My gosh did these cookies turn out great!  Wonderful recipe.  The only change I made was substituting a cup of mini choco chips for one cup of the raisins.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly!  Super healthy cookie!

I love the healthy ingredients but the first batch I made came out very dry. Made these cookies as written except used 1/2 raisins, 1/2 craisins. So I added 1/2 cup of chopped apples to the mix and continued baking-they were great, boys loved them.

These are a hit! My kids love getting to eat cookies for breakfast, even though they're healthy. I did sub in some different things to bump up the nutrition factor. I subbed 1/2 c. pumpkin puree for the peanut butter, and 1/2 c. flax seed meal for the wheat germ. I also used the buttermilk instead of water as the author suggested. I only bake them about 16 min. They truly are a breakfast treat.

These are so good you can't stop eating them. I made them with 2 Tablespoons butter, about 2/3 c. peanut butter, and an overripe banana, and they were moist and chewy (and healthier too).

Oh yeah! These are just what I was looking for! I needed a warm and healthy breakfast for my girls and this is perfect. As others suggested, I only baked them for 15 minutes and I didn't flatten them very much. The inside is soft, warm and just perfect. I also added a 1/4 cup mini chocolate chips and decreased the raisins to 1/4 cup. These are really great!

Wow!  These are fantastic!  I did everything pretty much as the recipe suggested - used buttermilk in place of milk, but did use dried cranberries instead of raisins.

I did end up cooking mine for about 18 minutes, but don't think I flattened them as much as other people.  Mine are satisfyingly thick and chewy, with great flavor and not too sweet.  I made good sized cookies too - the end result is about 2-3 inches in diameter and maybe 1/4 inch thick.  Just like I was hoping.  I'll take these over donuts or pastries for breakfast any day.

Awesome! I used about 1/3 cup of butter and added two mashed ripe bananas, used 1/2 cup whole flax seed in place of the wheat germ, and added 1/4 cup of skim milk powder to the dry ingredients.  I also added 1/4 cup of sesame seeds, 3/4 cup milk chocolate chips, 1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips, and some peanuts and whole almonds in place of the raisins.  These cookies are dense and filling - not overly sweet.  Taste very wholesome!  I can't believe this recipe is only supposed to make 12 cookies - I ended up with close to 40 (regular sized) cookies.  Will definately make again and again.

This is my new favorite cookie. I made them for a camping trip, and they were a big hit with everyone! Tasty, but did not give you the sugar crash that other cookies can. These really can be eaten for breakfast, as the name says! I made these with soy milk instead of water/buttermilk and oat bran instead of the wheat germ (it's what I had in the house) and they were perfect. I've made them again, and like to experiement with the additions. My current favorite is raisin/choc chip/cashew. YUM!

I love having a "healthy" cookie recipe that the kids will eat.  Some of my kids don't like raisins so I only put them in half of the dough.  They love taking them for a snack before basketball practice.

I scooped these out with an ice cream scoop and we called them "muffin tops", which is just what they look like. My kids and husband loved them as is, although the one with a huge sweet tooth had to have them with jam. We usually try to go low-sugar, so this was a welcome addition to my repertoire!

I think I may have over baked these, because they came out quite dry and dense. The taste is okay (probably would be better if I had had the ingredients recommended). I used sunbutter instead of peanut butter and half applesauce and SmartBalance margarine, and flaxseed with wheat germ because those are the items I had on hand. What's really turning me off is that the insides of these cookies are positively GREEN instead of brown.

Yum! I was looking for a healthier cookie to have on hand. This is it: delicious, satisfying, hearty and more nutritious than the usual (albeit tasty) blobs of butter and sugar.  What's more, my teenagers like these hearties! Thanks for sharing your recipe, Janet.

Yummy!  My husband and daughter both love them.  I put some in the freezer to pack in the diaper bag (she's 19 months).  It will be thawed by the time she's ready to eat it.  I might reduce the sugar to just 1 cup next time... I think they'd still be wonderful.  Taste like oatmeal breakfast squares, only better.  Thanks Janet!!  I'll be making these over and over again.

I just made these.  These are great!  The kids loved them and I love that they are quick and easy to make.  I only had 1/2 of the brown sugar so I added 1/2 a cup of butterscotch chips to the batter.  YUM!!!

This is my newest FAVORITE! I started feeding my husband "breakfast" cookies last month... and just this week got around to trying this recipe. Simply Awesome. Only changes: Added nutmeg and upped the cinnamon and I substituted 1 cup dried cranberries for the raisins which I soaked for 10 minutes before adding.

I've tried this a few different ways and liked them all, but this was my kids favorite:  Use 1/4 C applesauce and 1/4 C butter, 1 C oats and 1C rice crispies, in place of brown sugar I used splenda brown sugar blend. Instead of raisins, I used choc/peanut butter swirl chips. They turned out very soft and my kids and the neighbors kids devoured them! (also try pumpkin version with pumpkin pie spice, yum :)

OK, let me qualify by saying I had to alter the recipe, but these are awesome!!  I didn't have the wheat germ so I ground some whole grain oat flake and blueberry cluster cereal in the food processor and used that. I soaked the raisins in warmed apple cider just cause it sounded yummy and used the cider for the water. Subbed out half the butter for applesauce and threw in a banana when I creamed the butter and sugar. I used a regular size cookie scoop and baked for 10 minutes. Got about 5 1/2 dozen cookies. The base recipe itself sounded yummy too, so I may have to try it again when I'm better prepared. Thanks for a great idea!

This is an excellent recipe as is! I added mini chocolate chips to part of the batter for my chocoholic husband. Why buy prepackaged breakfast cookies when you can make them? Great recipe for adapting too and I can see trying with applesauce, flaxseed meal, wheat germ or dried cranberries for something different. Definitely a keeper in our house!

Wonderful recipe!  After having argued with my kids about what to eat for breakfast (for ever, it seems), as soon as I put cookies on their plates, breakfast became an instant hit!  I also substituted mini chocolate chips for the raisins (the grownups got dried cranberries), and the cookies turned out great!  Thanks for a great recipe!

These were really good.  I made a couple changes due to not having all the ingredients on hand.  I didn't have whole wheat flour so I used all purpose which worked great.  Also I didn't have enough raisins so I made it up to one cup by adding chocolate chips and walnuts.  My boyfriend didn't like them, saying they tasted too healthy but I loved them, as did all my coworkers when I brought them in this morning!  I will definitely make these again.

Wonderful!  These are delicious, nutritious, and filling.  I used brownulated sugar in place of brown sugar to save on calories and milled flaxseed in place of wheat germ as a personal taste preference and these were still fantastic!

Very good! I substituted apple sauce for half of the butter I also did all wheat flour instead of some all purpose. I added more raisins and also some almonds. My picky 2 year old even loved them! Next time I will do less sugar and more raisins. Thanks for the great recipe!

Very good recipe, and yes, these do freeze very well.  I added dried cherries and blueberries and added quite a few more raisins. Next time I'll cut back on the brown sugar a bit, as the dried fruit I added gave it a bit more sweetness. Thanks for the great recipe!

Excellent cookie!  Exactly as described!  Tasty, hearty and very easy.  A very flexible recipe, we made it as is except we left out salt (always do) and reduced sugar to 1/2 cup.  Next time we will add different fruit, seeds or nuts.

These were great.  Everyone at work loved them.  I used only whole wheat flour and used flax meal instead of wheat germ.  Also reduced the sugar by 1/4.  They are great warmed in the microwave and really kept me full until lunchtime.

Being a new mom doesn't always allow for extravagant meals…or meals at all for that matter. So I wanted to find something quick and easy, but healthy as well. This recipe was just that, but I put my own "healthy" alternatives to test when baking up these treats. To significantly cut down on the fats and sugars I substituted two 4oz jars of apple and blueberry baby food for all of the butter, Splenda brown sugar for the packed brown sugar, and gluten free Redmill oat flour for both the wheat and white flour. Also, I didn't have wheat germ handy so I used whole flax seeds instead. I got creative with some slivered almonds and walnuts to add in some omega 3's. These turned out fabulous and are a super healthy breakfast option or quick snack to keep me powered through the day. Next time I'll try adding in a scoop or two of protein powder to take it to the next level.

These lasted about 24 hours in my house.  We all loved them.  I used all natural peanut butter (the kind you have to stir) because its all that was in the house and I only baked them for 12 minutes instead of the suggested 20 minutes.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly and everyone from our one-year-old to my husband thought they were great!

I've made these twice.  The first time I made them as written. The second time I made made a couple of substitutions.  My family does not like raisins.  I chopped up an equivalent amount of dry cherries and added in a handful of mini-chocolate chips.  Yummy!

We love this recipe because it is a great grab n' go breakfast.  Have made it exactly as written numerous times and is great but recently tried a couple of variations just for variety.   I soaked some craisins in hot water then pureed them before adding them to the mix.  My kids don't like raisins/craisins and they didn't know they were in there. Also, I have made them into bar cookies--I spread the dough out in a large cookie sheet (12"x17") then baked as directed. I often add a few choc chips to disguise the ground raisins.  thanks for this recipe!

My husband has high cholesterol so I had to tinker with this recipe to suit his needs. I used smart balance oil and applesauce instead of butter. I used egg substitute instead of eggs. I also used Smucker's organic peanut butter which is lower in sat fat. Husband doesn't like raisins, I used 1 cup of walnuts instead. Oh and instead of wheat germ we used milled flaxseed which is very high in omega 3. Cookies turned out flavorful and filling. Thank you for the basic recipe.

Really pretty good. I made two changes...instead of wheat germ I added whey protein powder and instead of 1cup raisins I chopped up a granny smith apple into little pieces which was about 3/4cup and topped off with raisins. I might form them into more of a bar next time and not call them cookies...they don't earn the name cookie but are definately a satisfying healthy snack and I will make them again.

Great cookies! My daughters didn't care for them, but I loved them! In my opinion they taste better a day or two later though. I didn't add raisins, but did add M&M's instead.. Thanks for a great recipe!

I used crunchy natural peanut butter, and followed recipe exactly.  I think they turned out wonderful.  Getting my picky kids to eat them is a different story!

Although I live in a house of picky eaters, I was still surprised no one would eat these. These taste a little too "healthy" for my tastes- you can't really taste the peanut butter, just more of a whole-grain taste. Next time, I'll try adding a banana like another reviewer suggested, and double the peanut butter.

My husband's new favorite on-the-go breakfast...he is up at 4 AM and out the door at 4:15!  A tasty change from toast.  These are delicious as is, and also a terrific cookie for adapting by add-ins such as some chocolate morsels, some trail mix, or a dribble of honey.  All in all, a delighful keeper.

I thought these were excellent. My 3 1/2 year old asked me if he could have cookies for breakfast so I jumped on Allrecipes.com and found this fabulous recipe. So the answer was YES he can have cookies for breakfast! I added chocolate chips instead of the raisins and I also only had 1/2 cup of peanut butter on hand and they still turned out perfect!

Excellent straight from the oven, but dried out quickly.  I will add some applesauce or yogurt to the next batch to make a more moist cookie.

These are great. I like to add a mix of dried fruit and nuts--the combination just depends on what's in the cupboard. Today I made them with raisins, dried cranberries, walnuts, and some crystallized ginger. These are satisfying and a slightly healthier coffee snack than a muffin or donut.

After buying the Baker's Breakfast Cookies for sometime, I came across this recipe.  Tired of the expense, I decided to try this one.  A great alternative at a lower price!  I reduce the flour to 3/4 cup of each.  They taste a little more moist that way.  I don't care for raisins so I leave them out or add in nuts.  I also usually add flax seed.

Kids did not like the peanut butter flavor the first time I made this. Made second time with very chunky applesauce and they came out just fine and tasted better. I also used pecans, dried cranberries and rasins. Very good recipe without the peanut butter.

These cookies were so healthfully delicious! I had to make a few minor changes since I lacked the proper ingredients...but they still turned out great!
 I replaced the wheat germ with half cup whole flaxseed, and I only had old fashioned oats, so I used those, but added a half cup less, (since I thought they would use up more moisture from the wet ingredients).
I also skipped the raisins, since I didn't have those either! 
I used a large cookie scoop, instead of an icecream scoop, and I didn't flatten them...they were picture perfect! Who say's healthy can't taste good? Thanks a bunch Janet!

Wow, these were great!  I used all whole wheat flour and I added in 1/3 cup ground flaxseed, plus about double the oats--old fashioned, not quick oats.  They are absolutely umscious...and next time I will sub in apple sauce or apple butter in place of some or all of the 1/2 cup butter.  The kids loved these, I loved these...just delicious and perfect. Thanks!

These were very good but a little dry. I will do some tweaking with it next time. With all the sugar I was afraid they would be too sweet but were fine in that area. 2 of our 3 kids liked them. The one that didn't is really picky and didn't even taste them so if he had he may have liked them. I did not have wheat germ but did have wheat bran and used that. Next time I may try ground flax seed which should make them chewier and less dry maybe.

A big hit with our carbo-loading, carbo-loving runners!  Like other reviewers, I used dates instead of raisins.  I put about 2 tablespoons of Brown Rice Syrup in with the dates to add more complex carbohydrates. We thought the 12 cookie recipe itself could yield 24 cookies and still be filling so we'll probably do that next time.  Awesome recipe... we'll use it often!

Cookies are a big weakness of mine, but I feel guilty eating them for breakfast.  So I was pretty excited to find this recipe.  I guess they're healthier than a chocolate chip cookie.  These cookies are dense and heavy, but what with the whole wheat flour, the oats, and the wheat germ, I actually expected them to be even denser, like little cookie black holes.  And if I hadn't burnt my batch, they might almost have been a little fluffy.  I do like the mild peanut butter flavor.  I substituted chopped dates for the raisins.  Good with hot tea.  So I will probably make these again; they are convenient to grab for a quick breakfast.

I only gave this 4 stars because I used dark chocolate chips instead of raisins and cinnamon.  These are yummy and will be good for breakfast on the go (endurance riding).  Not very sweet, but nutritious.  :)

These cookies are fantastic! My son is allergic to peanuts, so instead of 1 cup of peanut butter I used 1/2 cup of soy butter (healthy) and 1/2 cup of cookie butter (not so healthy, but tasted oh so good). Also, I couldn’t easily find wheat germ, so I used flax seed instead. Turned out beautifully!

So much was wrong with the recipe, which I followed except for using flax instead of wheat germ.  I initially went light on the brown sugar, but ended up adding more because they were just so blah, no sweetness at all.  Extremely dry to point of cookies just crumbling.  Had to cut the cook time way down (even pulling the first batch 2 minutes early, the raisins were burnt.)  Which BTW 1 cup is not enough raisins.  Kept adding liquid, and shortening the time even more, still dry and crumbly. I'll have to try a different recipe next time, there is too much I would have to change to call it the same recipe.  Bummed!!  I added a piece of chocolate to one cookie, and so I believe adding a bunch of chocolate chips might really jazz these up, but there is still the dryness issue.  IF I tried them again, maybe I will try adding the banana, and more sugar, liquid, RAISINS, more nuts - and shorter cook time, dependent on size of cookie.  I'm pretty disappointed, because I really wanted to like these.  I'm going to add the crumbles to some ice cream, see if that is a way to salvage the product!!

I really don't know how to feel about these breakfast cookies. I think the taste was just ok. Maybe using chunky pb and adding nuts next time will boost my opinion? Until next time... UPDATE: I spread a thin layer of pb on the bottom of a cookie. It tastes a lot better this way. Thank goodness because I have 54 cookies that need to be eaten.

This recipes is a good base for a breakfast cookie. I used almost the same ingredients and added some extras to suit our taste. I used 1/2 cup of flax seeds instead of wheat germ and added 1 cup of granola, 1 1/2 cups of chocolate chips, and crunchy peanut butter. I made them pretty big and flatten them to about 1 inch thickness. It pretty much keeps its shape from dough to done. I checked the cookies at 15 minutes and was hard to tell if they were done due to they were already a dark color to start off with. I took the first batch out at 20 minutes and they turned out a bit dry and slightly burnt on the bottom. Second batch, I did 15 minutes and it wasn't quite to my liking. It was between 13-14 minutes seemed to be better and more moist. My son didn't like the 20 minute cookies but liked the 13-14 minutes much better. My husband said that he could eat 5 of them.

A very hearty cookie for anytime of the day. Great for hungry crowds with lots of young adults. This cookie really satisfies and does not give you the sugar crash -unlike most desserts. 

I did add 1c applesauce in place of the butter. Very moist.

Versatile and delicious!!! I will use this often for a healthy quick snack for me and the kids. This time I used currants and hazelnuts with honey.

Just finished making these and they are great!  My kids will get home later today from school so the true test will be then!  As I read in a previous review, I used 1/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup butter.  I used chocolate chips instead of raisins because my kids won't eat raisins.  However I think 1/2 raisins and 1/2 chocolate chips would be good.  I do think that I will 1/2 the cinnimon next time because they do have a rather strong cinnimon flavor.  But they are moist and really good. Good sub for breakfast on the fly.

Really liked this recipe. I have made it before using self rising flour and it turned out great. I used all purpose flour and added the 1tsp salt and my husband said they were way too salty. So I am going to try unsalted butter instead. Also the recipe said 2 tsp of baking soda  that would also make them taste salty. Can I cut down on the salt or the baking soda without making it too heavy?

Delicious!!!!  And not that peanut-buttery, thank goodness.  I used dates instead of raisins, and my little guy thought they were chocolate chips!!!  Also, 16 min. seemed enough baking time.

Excellent cookie!  Will be great for morning snacks, much healthier alternative!  I replaced 1/2 the butter with applesauce, reduced the brown sugar to 1 c, and replaced the raisins with craisins.  Yummy!  We will probably keep our freezer stocked with these!

I used flax seed instead of wheat germ, and milk in place of the water cause that's what I had.  I baked them for 15 minutes and that was enough.  Next time I'll use 1/2 more dried fruit and might add nuts.  Very good breakfast cookie!

These are so good and my family eats them so well that I have to make a batch of them each week. I bake one or two cookies sheets of them and then make 'cookie logs' in waxed paper to store in the fridge/freezer. I take them out and cut off cookies to bake anytime. I alter the recipe each time I make them, but this is an excellent recipe and I get requests for it  often!

Loved these! I would have liked the cinn./raisins, but to be sure my kids would eat them, I substituted milk chocolate chips as another review mentioned. I will keep these in the freezer for a quick breakfast on the go!

For a healthy cookie these are really tasty! I used sea salt for that salty crunch and used 1/2 banana to replace one egg. I also used Sunsweet brands lighter bake as a replacement for the butter in the recipe. I used 1 tsp. maple extract in place of the one tsp of vanilla and also used walnuts instead of raisens. I know this was a lot of changes but it make a light crispy cookie with a walnut/mapley flavor. Inside is soft outside is crunchy. baked them for only 10 minutes on convect, which would be about 13 min reg. bake. Will make these again and again in different combinations!

My family really liked this recipe. All my children like these and it's easy to make custom variations for each one's idea of what a breakfast cookie ought to be. I put in chocolate chips in part of it for my sweet tooth son, fruit for my fruit loving son, and just plain for my daughter that won't eat breakfast. It works.

Great and filling breakfast cookie!  I did use buttermilk instead of the water.  I also used half raisins and half chopped dates.  Because of what I had in my pantry - I used half peanut butter and half sunflower seed butter.  I also ran out of oatmeal and only used 3 cups.  Both not by choice....but the cookies came out great anyway!!!!!  Thanks a bunch!!!  I look forward to also crumbling a couple of these cookies in a bowl of vanilla yogurt, as well!!!

These cookies are THE best.  I make them as the recipe reads except use chocolate chips instead of raisins.  It makes up 24 good sized cookies.  My toddler, kids, husband and parents love them!

Yum!  Filling, and it tastes more 'breakfast' than 'cookie', and that's exactly what I've been looking for.  Due to lack of resources, I had to make a few substitutions.  I used white instead of wheat flour, flax seed instead of wheat germ, and honey for half of the brown sugar.  I also used a combination of half dates and half walnuts instead of raisins, and I soaked the chopped dates in hot coffee beforehand.  I drained the coffee and used it instead of water.  Next time I'd add more dates.  I look forward to trying the ginger-candy-and-sesame combination.

My toddler has been obsessed with "cookies" lately. She ALWAYS asks for them and most of the time, from a nutritional standpoint, I have to say no. But with this recipe, I can feel a little better about offering this as her snack with a glass of milk. I wanted to up the nutrients so I adjusted the recipe according to other reviewers comments. Instead of 1/2 cup butter I used 1/4 cup butter, 1/4 cup apple sauce. I added a ripened banana in with the peanut butter mixture. I didn't have wheat germ, so I subbed ground flax seed.

Kids and parents will enjoy!

This is soooooooo YUMMY I can't believe it's healthier than a regular oatmeal cookie!  The only change I made was adding 1 cup chocloate chips instead of raisins since hubby doesn't like raisins.  Next time I will use applesauce instead of butter as other raters have tried.  I will also add some raisins to half the batch for ME.  This is a filling and healthy breakfast on the go or a treat any time of the day!

I have made these cookies a few times now, and feel the need to write a fantastic review.  I did make modifications based on other reviews to suit our own tastes.  I used white whole wheat flour in place of the whole wheat and part of the white.  I also used rolled oats, applesauce for half of the butter, egg whites, and chocolate chips, and omitted the cinnamon.  I used a combination of regular peanut butter and natural crunchy.  These were fantastic.  I understand that reviewing a recipe based on our own changes is a little off, BUT the original is so good, it can handle lots of changes.  I am not planning on serving these for breakfast, instead as a replacement for some very pricey all natural kids granola bars.

I've been searching for a quick and easy breakfast substitute and this is a great one!  The peanut butter flavor is subtle, but very yummy!  I used all of the suggested substitutions that sounded worthwhile- 4 egg whites instead of 2 eggs; flax seed instead of wheat germ; half applesauce for some of the butter; a combination of honey and brown sugar instead of ALL of the sugar and chocolate chips instead of raisins!  Very good!!!

These are very good!! Very adaptable recipe.  Incorporated Soifua's suggestions (May 20, 2008 Review), added some flax meal as well and dusted tops with cinnamon brown sugar prior to baking. A good option for a quick breakfast on the go.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

I really like this recipe.  My son hates to eat breakfast and since he started school he really needed to have something before he left.  These cookies have a lot of nutrition and compared to things like Nutri-Grain bars are very healthy.  I substitued chocolate chips for the raisins just to make them more appealing to my family and used natural peanut butter.  I love that this recipe does not call for any white sugar.  You won't miss it!  They are great and just what we needed!

These cookies were a bit dry, I will try using some applesauce like another person suggested.  I may even throw in some yogurt to moisten them up.  None the less everyone enjoyed them.  My 2 1/2 year old couldn't get enough of them and was sure pleased to be able to eat them for breakfast and a night snack.  Will definately make them again

Good but not great, but probably due more to my changes than to the original recipe.   cut the sugar, perhaps too much, and I didn't account for the lack of sugar in my natural peanut butter.   also added mini choc. chips and banana.  They are good for breakfast and my preschoolers like them (which was the whole point) but the don't satisfy my cookie craving so I think I will try "Beth's Oatmeal Cookies" next.

These are yummy. I did make a couple pf additions. I added 1/3c of flax seeds and unsalted peanuts. Also used 1 1/2c of whole wheat flour and 1/2c of white. They were good out of the oven but much better then next morning. I sent some with my boyfriend on his business trip.

I'm wiping my hands off right now, after eating my second cookie!  Had one straight out of the oven last night and actually liked it better this morning.  Cooked for 15 minutes, used mixed dried fruit instead of just raisins (cherries, blueberries, raisins, raspberries).  YUM!  Can't wait to serve these at my brunch in 2 days.

AMAZING!! I stumbled across during one of my healthy eating bouts and they have stuck!!  I love these, sometimes I tweak them by doubling the cinn. to two tsp. and leaving out the raisins and finally sprinkling a little cinn. on top. They are great for on the go or throwing them in the mircowave for 15 secs to have with my morning tea!

These cookies are true to their name.  I am a peanut butter lover, and they satisfied me!  They come out pretty moist, and are a great cookie for Breakfast or as a protein packed snack.

I made this recipe because I have a picky breakfast eater and she still didn't like it but the rest of the family did. I did just as recipe calls for and added chocolate chips. Most likely to make again.

Excellent!  These turned out delicious.  I think next time I will use a bit less salt, but I am very sensitive to salt.  A very hearty, filling cookie!

My kids love the idea of having cookies for breakfast.  I do use mini semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of raisins.

I have made these cookies a couple of times and they turn out great.  This time I accidentally left out the cup of all purpose flour. And they still turned out pretty good, just a little softer then I'd like. They were very moist, and flattened out very well, which I noticed were problems with this recipe in previous reviews.  I will probably add 1/2 cup all-purpose flour next time, just to give a little more body, this recipe made 18-20 large size cookies, and I cooked them only for 13 minutes, let them rest for 2 like the recipe says.

These were very good, and not as dense as I thought they would be.  I forgot to flatten them before baking, and they did not spread at all.  Now I have cookies shaped like scoops of ice cream!

These went over well with my family. They enjoyed the subtle sweetness and whole grain "healthy" taste, though I personally found them a bit on the dry side, but tasty nonetheless. If you're looking for a moist and chewy cookie, this may not be to your liking.

If you aren't looking for a regular "cookie" - these are really good.  They are a bit dry and heavy and should not be confused for any kind of standard chocolate chip cookie replacement, but if you are looking for something to replace an energy bar, or to serve to small children without guilt, etc.  these are fabulous.  A couple of notes though - I used fresh, natural peanut butter which was pretty chunky - this may have added to the dryness in my batch.  I also replaced half of the raisins with sunflower seeds and carob chips - this also probably added to the dryness.  I used apple juice in place of water, and replaced 1/3 c. of the brown sugar with honey (ran out of brown sugar).  I also had to reduce the cooking time to 15 minutes.  In the end, my husband liked them - which really surprised me, my 2 year old likes them, and I think they are fairly good.  I give 4 stars for overall taste and versatility of the recipe.

I've been trying for a while now to change my bad eating habits into good ones, and it wasn't going so great. So now im trying to find healthy versions of my treats.

I used apple juice in place of the water and soaked craisins in the juice for a half hour. 
I used almond extract and vanilla and added ginger and nutmeg with the cinnamon. I added 1/3c ground flax, so I added extra 1/4c peanut butter and a splash of juice and extra vanilla and almond to add a little more moisture for the flax.

I love, love these cookies!  I have made the recipe 4 times.  I liked the idea of making them even healthier and used several reviewers suggestions.  I do half butter, half unsweetened applesauce; 3/4 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup honey; use flax meal instead of wheat germ.  I also use regular oats instead of quick and they work fine.  I love cinnamon so I add 2 1/2 tsp.  Using my ice cream scoop I get 21 big cookies every time.  I also only cook 12-14 minutes.  Cookies are moist and delicious!  They freeze well too.  Thanks for the great recipe!

We are GF, so I substituted GF all purpose flour, omitted the wheat germ. I cut the sugar down to 1 cup and used dried cherries instead of raisins. We LOVED these with coffee. They had a great texture for dipping (not as hard as a scone— but they stayed together to dunk in coffee). We really enjoyed these lightly sweet breakfast cookies.

I did change the recipe a little bit. 1/3 cup raisins, 1/3 cup currants and 1/3 cup dried cranberries. Nice big cookies and not too sweet. I will definitely be making these again, maybe with dates or figs. Very good recipe.

Thumbs up, but - I made them as suggested and they are just too big. So next time I’ll make them smaller and problem solved. Very good and nutritious too, can’t beat that!

Here we go with another one who rates a recipe with personal changes!  I was looking for something that might work well despite my food allergies and thought I'd go ahead with this one.
Rather than 
peanut butter, I used sunbutter;  
whole wheat flour, used cornmeal; 
wheat germ, used chia seeds (1/4 cup);  
flour, Bob's Red Mill All Purpose Gluten Free flour blend and for my soul, 1/2 cup chocolate chips.
I started with a small scoop to shape the cookies and then decided to roll out the dough and use a small biscuit cutter.  Since they were small, I baked for only 10 minutes.  I shaped the rest of the dough and put it in the freezer so that I can bake a few as needed.

This was a great recipe.  My kids gobbled them up.  I may tweak it a bit next time and add less butter and less sugar.   I did substitute craisins as I didn’t have enough raisins.  I will definitely make it again.

These are wonderful cookies.  It's hard to stay away from the jar.  I used dates instead of raisins, used 2 tsp cinnamon, and burned the first batch (it's my oven obviously) so lowered the temp to 330 for 14 minutes.  Perfect

The original recipe is very good. So good I omitted the wheat germ only because I had run out and was too hungry for the cookies to delay baking until I could go buy some.

I used dried cranberries instead of raisins. (the crasins have a brighter bite but each one need to be cut in half for best cookie flavor. You can food processor them  if you have that appliance. Also try dried apricots chunked into small pieces
 Delightful! I also added a cup of fresh grated carrot. The cookies came out moist and chewy, AND DELICIOUS!

Great cookies. Was surprised by the nutrition facts. A lot more healthy than oat Other cookies and my son loved them. Will definitely make them again.

Delicious!  I couldn’t even wait for them to cool before trying!  I’m gluten free so I made changes to the flours.  I substituted cup 4 cup gf flour for the all purpose flour, oat flour for the whole wheat, flax meal for the wheat germ.  I made them with rolled oats, organic peanut butter and chopped dates instead of raisins.  I have 24 cookies and they cooked in 20 minutes.  Moist, perfect amount of sweetness and yummy.

I really liked these. I made half a batch and got 6 large cookies. I shaped them into circles when I was patting them down. They stayed together (as long as I let them cool completely) and they are still moist two days later. I think they will freeze well. They really remind me of the Quaker breakfast cookies or breakfast squares, except I like these better. I cut back on the sugar a bit. I ran out of wheat germ, so used half milled flax. I used chunky peanut butter. These are going to be so easy to tweak to whatever I want to put in them. I might make some a bit smaller next time so I can have one as a snack or as a second breakfast item with something else. Thanks for a great breakfast cookie.

What a great tasty cookie.  A good alternative to a donut / muffin for breakfast and so easy to make.  I put them in our lunch bags for a morning snack.

These were just ok. I made them according to the recipes. They are dry and kind of bland. Next time, I would probably add chocolate chips.

Just got a request from my daughter for these - they're great when we have to wake up early to go to a volleyball tournament.  A couple modifications - I substitute flax seed for wheat germ and do 1/2 cup chocolate chips and 1/2 cup raisins.  Yum!

Not sure it is fair to rate this recipe.  I switched 1/3 of the brown sugar  with raw honey.  Used half quick oatmeal and half Old Fashioned.  Added flaxseed, a little coconut, walnuts, and substituted craisins for raisins.  Used powdered milk/water for the water.
Only baked for 14-15 minutes.  18-20 minutes was too long for my oven. 
Hubby ate 4 before I got the third cookie sheet in the oven!

I made this and shockingly my kids loved these! I added chocolate chips and they asked me to make more. I am thrilled, I thought they were ok, and a bit dry the second and third day but they still loved them. I'll be making them again and again as long as they eat them.

Super great cookies! I substituted the brown sugar for 1 cup of brown sugar (instead of 1 1/3 cups) and 1 banana. They were super good and tasted like little banana bread bombs.

So I made these last night so hubby and I would have a quick breakfast that was relatively healthy for the week. I did substitute 1/4c coconut oil and 1/2c applesauce for the butter, used 1-1/2c wheat flour and 1/2c white flour, and used 1/3c brown sugar and about 2T honey and they are sweet enough and, I assume, healthier.  The recipe made 24 big cookies that I will freeze as others suggested. Thanks!

I love this recipe. I have made it 3 times since I found it early last month. A great on the go breakfast option! Today I added 1/2 cup  of ground flaxseed and a cup of dried cranberries with a few mini dark chocolate chips and a cup of chopped walnuts-- hearty and yummy!! I love that they bake  up thick and chewy.

These were ok, not great. I didn't have wheat germ so I used flax meal instead.   They were dry and I even put in an extra egg white when I could tell the dough was very crumbly.  I also only baked them for 12 minutes,  they would have completely burned at 18-20 minutes.  My kids will probably eat them but I don't think I would make again.

Love the flavor of the cookies.  I added pecans and used craisins, but all else was following the recipe.  Yes, I will make it again, but, next time, less sugar.  I made them to pack out my breakfast as I go to work at 4am.  Thanks for the easy and delicious idea!

I followed the recipe to the letter, with the only exception that I used 1C of sugar instead of 1 1/3.  They were a little bland.  There's a ton of potential though - I think some chopped nuts or some other dried fruits (dates, craisins, etc.) would help.

I liked them but they were a little too dry and crumbly to make for an appetizing breakfast. Next time I'll either try a different recipe or use some tricks from the comments.

Absolutely Love these cookies!!! I made them as recipe called for the first time, but I have made them numerous times with slight tweeks. I used flax for half of the wheat germ, I also soak the raisins in hot liquid to plump them up. I add 1/4 chia seeds, 1/4 cocoa nibs, and sometimes use half almond butter for half of the peanut butter. The last time i also added 1/4 cup of hemp seeds.

If I make it again, I would use milk or buttermilk instead of water, and honey for some of the sugar.  I baked for 17 minutes and I got 40 something cookies--so mine were smaller than the recipe's.  They are a good on the run.

Loved these! So flavorful. It's a light and chewy cookie that everyone loves.  I substituted dried cranberries for the raisins and added pecans.  The first day I left them on the counter and my husband ate one every time he walked by because they were so good.  I finally put them in a tupperware dish and kept them in the fridge. They were a nice welcome addition to his packed lunch each day and they have kept fresh very nicely all week long. Will definitely make again!

Great recipe--I would "tweek" it as well and use less butter and add a bit more to customize to my taste.

These are very band. I swapped out 1/2 the butter for applesauce -other than that I didn't change anything. Disappointed bc so many ppl gave it good reviews!

These are so good! I added one cup of walnuts and one cup of chocolate chips to add more protein and a little bit of sweetness. I also used chunky peanut butter. Yum!

Loved these cookies!!!  What a great alternative to cereal/breakfast bars.  Even my 18 month old daughter likes them and I can feel good about sharing them with her because of all the good ingredients.  Thanks!!

These are pretty tasty.  The kids enjoyed them.  I added millet to them because I like the crunch.

I made these without the wheat germ, since I didn't have any, and added about 1/2 cup of chocolate chips (I realize that defeats the healthy attempt. . .)  I didn't find them to be dry, but definitely flattened them before baking.  They don't spread much in the oven.  My two young children loved eating these for "breakfast" and I plan on sharing them for snacks at church tonight.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

Very good! I left out the raisins, as a personal preference; and used all-purpose flour instead of whole wheat. They have more fat than I'd like to start my day with, but I'm sure I'll make them again for convenience. Thanks, Janet!

I was excited to find a breakfast cookie recipe and this is a good one.  My husband loved these.  I was only so so about them, but I'm not a big peanut butter fan.  I made these with an ice cream scoop and got fewer than the recipe suggested.  They turned out great though!  Great for grab and go breakfast on the run!

Totally yummy!!!  I used dried cranberries instead of raisins and they came out excellent.  Great recipe for people who cannot sit down for breakfast or maybe for hikers who need some portable energy.  Thanks for the recipe.
