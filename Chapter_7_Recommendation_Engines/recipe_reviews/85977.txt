This was such a good meal.  The meat mixture is like a mini meatloaf.  Trying to find nice  "pepper boats" to hold the goodies was a challenge at the produce market, but the meat mixture stayed together so nicely.  I did not have all the salsa called for in the recipe so I used what I had mixed in the meat mixture then poured a small can of V-8 juice over all (my Romanian Grandma used to use this with her stuffed peppers and cabbage rolls).  Sprinkled cheese on top at the very end of cooking time and what nice compliments from all!  DO NOT PRECOOK THE MEAT.  All the flavors meld together.  Will be making this one again and again.

Excellent! Although I made a few changes. I used small yellow, orange and red peppers (appetizer style), 1lb of meat, more salsa, and instead of white rice, I cooked up a mexican rice dish (you can get a package mix) and stole some from that, and added cilantro to the mixture. The cooking time was also shortened by about 20 minutes.

Will definitely make again, and take to parties!

Tasty. I actually cooked the meat first (because I didn't read the directions right) so I only had to bake them for 30 minutes.  I also topped them with cheese and then added more salsa and a little sour cream once they were cooked. Very good.

This is a really good recipe. You can be as creative, as you please. I chose to lightly brown the meat. Along with the onion, I added chopped garlic and cumin.Didn't think the egg was necessary...so I left it out. Pre browning the meat enabled me to cut back the cooking time, by about 15-20 mins. Thanks for sharing:)

I love this recipe!  My husband and kids love it, too.  I pre-cooked the meat,  then rubbed the peppers with olive oil and baked them for 30 minutes before filling.  We melted some pepper jack cheese on the top...sooo good!  This is surely a keeper for us.  Thanks!

I didn't read very well and cooked everything first but it turned out fantastic!
I carmalized my onions, added some mushrooms and then beef with some spices.  When beef was cooked i added half of the salsa and let it simmer for a bit.  Becasue everything was cooked I had to figure out a way to soften the peppers (as this would have happend over the hour they were in the oven). So I just boiled some water and tossed them in for around 3 minutes.  After draining  them, I stuffed them put the rest of the salsa on top and heated them up for about 10-15 minutes.  It was yummy.  Maybe next time I'll try it the way the recipe says :)

Instead of meat, we cooked veggie burgers (morningstar garden veggie patties) and crumbled them up (no egg needed).  These were wonderful with Newman's black bean & corn salsa, a little tomato juice, and some corn!  We also roasted our peppers with olive oil for 20 minutes and sauteed the onions with Pam before stuffing.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

...I used leftover taco meat and brown rice. Just mixed with a handful of grated cheddar and a little salsa (forgot the egg).  Prepared 2 green peppers by cutting from top to bottom...removed the seeds, boiled for 3 mins and drained...Once stuffed I spooned a little extra salsa on top, covered with foil and baked for 30 mins...topped with more grated cheddar and back into the oven until melted.  VERY flavorful!  I served with corn on the cob (just threw them in the same pot of water I cooked my peppers in) and tortilla chips. Great way to use up that leftover taco meat..Thanks Lisa M for a great dinner idea.

Quick to put together, but I wouldn't say it is tasty. I found it lacked flavour.

Really liked this recipe. 
I adjusted the recipe a little by adding 1 carrot and 1 onion ground up in the food processor to the beef mixture. We couldn't taste them at all but it increased the number of vegetable servings in this meal.

I also added a little bit of taco seasoning. The next time i make this I will skip the egg.
Definitely a hit around the table, we will make this again, often.

Very good flavor. I browned the meat first so that I could just bake until the peppers were done without worrying about the meat. I have a thing about pink beef.  I did add a little jack cheese which I highly recommend. I have never had stuffed peppers before because they always sounded so blah but I'm glad I tried this recipe.

This is a great recipe! I just had to do 4 stars because I did modify it quite a bit. I didn't use an egg and added taco seasoning to the meat and cooked it prior to stuffing the pepper. Cooked the rice in chicken broth for more flavour. Topped the peppers with cheese and served with sour cream. So good! Thanks for a great base to work from!

These were awesome!  After reading the reviews, I decided to cook the onions and beef first, then I added 1/2 package of taco seasoning, rice and the salsa.  I simmered for about 15 minutes then stuffed the peppers.  Cooked for 40 minutes at 350 and added Mexican blend cheese to the top.   my son rated this a 5 which is hard to get around here.

5 star with modifications: on stove, cooked & drained beef.  To beef, added onion and salsa, 1/2 c instant white rice and cooked until boil, cover and sit 5 min. To this I added a leftover mixture of stir fried chopped bell peppers, zucchini jalapeno peppers, onions, canned corn, and minced garlic.  Added dry spices: cilantro, cumin, red pepper flakes.  Stuffed into prepared green peppers, added ~1T salsa on top of each stuffed pepper.  Cooked in SLOW COOKER 4 hrs on low. Topped with shred Mexican style cheese & thinly sliced green onions last half hour of cooking time.  A+!

I thought these were a nice variation of a stuffed pepper. I only used two peppers and one pound of ground beef. I didn't have as much salsa as I needed, so I mixed what I had in the beef and rice, and then mixed some chile powder, cumin, oregano, salt and pepper with a 28 ounce can of crushed tomatoes to pour over the peppers.

Very good. After baking I found it to be a bit dry as I made it as the recipe directed. So I added a little bit of water to the bottom of the pan and covered with foil and continued baking. This steamed the peppers and made the dish moist. Excellent flavor! The salsa makes a wonder seasoning for this dish! Thanks for sharing your recipe!  :)

I ended up changing the recipe quite a bit but what I did make was excellent. I used poblano peppers and stuffed them with the following: taco seasoned ground turkey 1 egg small can of corn sliced black olives green chilies poured a small can of red enchilada sauce over the whole thing and baked to an internal temp of 160. I then added cheese and returned to oven to melt. Finally I topped with mashed avocado, sour cream and green onions.

Very easy, very good recipe. I omitted the egg (didn't see the reason for it) and added some cayenne pepper and garlic powder. I also threw in some corn and fresh chopped tomatoes. I read that some people browned the meat before stuffing the peppers, but I think this is a mistake. I think mixing the raw meat with the other ingredients and then baking allows the flavors to meld together more thoroughly. I topped mine with more salsa and cheddar cheese before baking. Afterwards I served them with a dollop of sour cream. I will definately be making these again. In fact I doubled the filling recipe and I intend to freeze it for future use!

I precooked ground turkey in place of the raw beef.  (Using raw beef just sounds plain scary).  Other adjustments:  add cheddar cheese to the mixture, skip the egg and salsa, added a can of fire roasted tomatoes.  This can very easily be adjusted to your tastes.  This was served with the mexican rice recipe from this site.

Excellent!  I used ground deer meat because that's what I had on hand, added 1 chopped portabella mushroom and some diced garlic, left out the salt and added 1 egg because I made a larger portion than specified (2 lbs meat).  The real kicker though I think was the type of salsa I used - zesty salsa, medium spice, with cilantro and jalapenos.  Also added a slice of Muenster cheese over each stuffed pepper during last few minutes of baking.  Loved it!

i think this was a good base recipe, but needed something extra.  maybe more ingredients (cheese, sour cream, garlic, cilantro) should have been mixed in the stuffing?  not too sure.  will probably make again with additions.

It's like golebki but in a pepper with too much onion - especially considering that the salsa also has onion.  Also I think the remaining salsa should be put on fresh after the pepper is baked.  Wasn't so nice cooked like that.  Also it's best with green peppers, not orange, red, or yellow.  My husband wanted me to throw it all out , but I ate it myself for a couple more days because I didn't want to waste the food.

Ok so I made this doing exactly as told except I added a clove of garlic too. I thought the flavor would be bland because the ingredients are so simple but it was amazing! The meat was thoroughly cooked and the peppers were soft -after an hour in the oven-.  Also I thought that the recipe provider (lisa) just did not like green peppers because of personal taste- I have to agree that green pepper is a NO GO. I made 5 overflowing peppers following the ingredient list and one was green. The green lacked taste and was bland and was just not good at all. I tried some of the other peppers and they were amazing. Also to use up the pepper cut offs I just cut them into small pieces and mixed them in with the meat mixture. Or you can just put then on top of any of the peppers. Overall very easy delicious recipe.

These were good. I followed the directions exactly. I used the taco seasoning from this site. I stuffed yellow green and red peppers, and the green ones tasted the best. The recipe made way too much, next time I will cut in 1/2, or even less.

This was pretty tasty.  I seasoned the meat with taco seasoning, used hot salsa and added mushrooms.  In the last couple minutes I topped them with shredded cheese for the last 5 minutes it was baking then a dollop or sour cream.  Would definitely make again.

people are right, the recipe is kind of bland. I altered it a bit by browning the meat (ground turkey) adding lots of mexican style seasonings, and a can of diced chilis. I used half the amount of rice and more salsa.  top with cheese...yummy!

This recipe as written, is pretty bland. I doctored it up with more salsa, sour cream and chopped jalapenos.It wasn't bad just bland. So next time I'll use some taco seasoning in the meat mixture, and a can of chiles. And def. more salsa

This recipe was not that great.  It needed something else.  After reading the reviews I saw that some people used other spices and added corn and cheese that might of made this dish much better.  Maybe I will try it again but kick it up a notch.

Thought it might be a little bland so I added some jalapenos and crushed red pepper.  I definately think that you could use more salsa as notes have said above and invest in a good salsa.  Adding shredded cheese on top added a great touch.  Think I will tweak it a little bit more but definately will try again.

These peppers were a yummy way to end a rough day.  After reading the reviews, I poked minuscule holes on the bottom of the peppers to allow any oil to drain out.  I used a bit of Ketchup as well as spicy salsa to give it a bit more flavor.  Also dabbed some cumin and ground mustard into the filling mixture.  YUM-O!

The recipe was good but even with all the salsa, it still seemed a little bland. I even added sharp cheddar to the top of the peppers but it didn't seem to help much.

We liked this receipe. But all I had on hand was green peppers, which aren't my favorites. Next time I will use the colored pepperes. But my husband liked this recipe. I liked the stuffing but I addedmore salsa, so it would not be dry. I also bioled the peppers before hand as suggested by some other members. This cut my baking time and during July in Baton Rouge, LA that was very helpful!!!

This was delicious, colourful, and so easy to make.  I was skeptical about not browning the beef first.  No worry, they turned out great and what a time saver.  My kids do not like cooked vegetables, so I doubled the recipe, used half the mixture to stuff the peppers, then added bread crumbs to the balance and formed them into meatballs.  I served raw peppers on the side.  My kids thought they were the best meatballs ever!  I won't hesitate to serve this to company.

this recipe was pretty good but i did change a few things.  i used ground turkey and put some taco seasoning into it to give it more flavor.  i also made my own salsa.  i did not use the egg either.  i topped the pepper with pepperjack cheese and then served it with a little sour cream.  i think these changes made it a little tastier.

Very yummy recipe! I did make a slight change and used 1 lb. of spicy sausage with 3/4 lb. of extra lean ground beef. Plus, the salsa I used is a hot variety, so we had very tasty peppers (not dry at all!). Also, I used a pablano pepper in addition to the red and yellow to provide more spice.  

I don't understand the negative comments... this a great, flavorful recipe. Thanks for sharing!

This was fantastic! -- I substituted ground chicken for the beef to reduce the calories & fat. I am following Weight Watchers plan and by making this reduction it was only worth 5 points/serving!

This was excellent.  I've never been a fan of stuffed peppers - I think the taste of the green pepper just threw it off.  But I had everything on hand to made them, so I thought I'd give it a try.  I'm sure glad I did!  Easy to prepare and they tasted great!  Thanks for the recipe Lisa.

These were pretty good. I didnt add an egg and I found that the meat just fell apart when eating and was kind of a mess. So I think that the egg will help with that. I added extra salsa into the meat mixture which was a good thing because after tasting them I thought they could use a little more...maybe a full cup. I put cheddar cheese on top and they were yummy! I will be making them again! Thanks =)

Made a couple of times now & still making some adjustments. My husband would like more rice, less ground beef & top w/cheese just before taking out of the oven. This is a easy, colorful recipe.

My family loved these peppers. I cooked the meat first together with onions and some salsa and I also added some fajita seasoning. Then mixed it up with the rest, put it in the oven and topped it with some cheese about 5 min before they were done. Delicious!

This was excellent.  I used a mild jarred salsa (whole jar) and a cup of cooked rice.  I was able to fill the 6 pepper halfs and make a small loaf which I served with the peppers.  (I cooked loaf 15 minutes longer).  I plan to make this a lot this summer.  Thank you!

This was a great recipe but I did make several changes, which include: substituted the meat for roasted chicken breast, added taco seasoning to the rice, added a can of green chili peppers, eliminated the egg and put a lot more cheese in than what was called for.  I then topped each pepper with sour cream and guacamole at the end.  I only cooked them for about 40 minutes because nothing I included was raw.  My husband and I thought they were yummy!

My husband is a vegetarian, so after reading others reviews here are my "tweaks". I like to stand my peppers up, I just think it looks nicer. To the 1/2c cooked rice, three thawed, diced veggie patties (the kind that imitate beef), 1/4c diced onion, 2 green onions finely sliced, 1 jalapeno finely diced,  1T chili powder, 1 can whole plumb tomatoes, drained and crushed,salt and pepper
stuffed the peppers upright, baked covered for 50 min, removed cover, topped with pepper cheese and returned to oven until melted. I served these with a spinach and tomato salad dressed with an orange vinaigrette. My honey said "these are really good, let's remember this recipe" Thanks for the inspiration!

These are a great way to serve colored peppers to picky pepper eaters (my husband, for instance). And, the multi-colored peppers create a better presenation and are more sweet and flavorful than the less-ripe green variety. When I make this, I double the rice and meat mixture and freeze it for future use.

I used southwestern style rice and medium salsa.  They were good, definetely better than green peppers, still not my favorite dish.  I had to cook them for nearly an hour and 30 minutes; I thought they were done after an hour but discovered the meat was still pink in the middle.  My peppers were pretty big though.  I should have used leaner meat too, because the grease from the beef gushes out of the pepper when you cut it.

Awesome!  Did not use egg--personal preference.  Also used lentils to sub for some of meat--worked really well.  Could also use black beans.  Thanks for the recipe! :)

These peppers were very tasty, but turned out a bit dry.  Next time, I may try to keep the peppers intact and stuff the meat mixture inside of them so that it will stay more moist.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  I wouldn't try stuffed peppers before because I don't like green peppers, but the red and yellow ones were fantastic.  The salsa gave it just enough bite.  It was a wonderful supper. Thank you Lisa.

This recipe tasted great.  I followed the advice of a few others and used yellow and red bell peppers instead of green.  I also cooked my ground beef before baking it.  I also did not seem to need the egg.  It did not hold anything together for me and it just seemed like there was a bit of cooked egge every few bites or so, but still very tasty.

I usually use green peppers, but also love yellow and red peppers, so I decided to give this a try. Gald I did. I added a little hot sauce and black bean sauce to the meat as I was cooking it. That gave a really good flavour. Topped these off with LOTS of aged cheddar. Really good stuff! :)

This is a great recipe! Everyone at my house loves when I make it. It's simple but tasty. I usually double the recipe and find that I have a ton of meat leftover, which I then use to make "fiesta" meatloaf or burgers for the next night's dinner! Yum!

We love this, have made it many dozens of times.  I like to add a package of taco seasoning and some cumin to it for a little more flavor.  I also add a can of black beans and omit the rice for a more low carb version.

This recipe has potential.  I made these for my boyfriend and I the other night and followed the directions exactly since it was the first time making them.  I agree with other reviewers that they were pretty bland.  Pre-cooking the meat and onion with a taco packet I think would give it an extra kick.  Also, I thought that these had way too much onion.  I would recommend using only half an onion.  Our other critiques included reducing the amount of ground beef to a pound (just because of the size of the bell peppers) and maybe adding a little extra rice into the mixture.  Once the peppers came out of the oven, I did add some cheese to mine and microwave.  I would probably mix some cheese into the mixture or on top for extra flavor as well.  I would definitely try it again with a few changes to give it some added flavor!

Was good. Make sure to use tons of salsa on top of the peppers, though. I only had enough for 2 tbsp on each, and it was not enough.

This was the best stuffed pepper recipe ever.  I love my peppers crispy so it's great that all the ingredients are already cooked prior to cooking them in the pepper.  That way the peppers stay crisp and yummy.  My hubby also enjoyed it and that says a lot.  He's real picky about what he eats.

An easy, VERY tasty recipe.  Because I had 4 peppers; I increased the rice to 3/4 cup, the salsa to 2 cups and I used 1 lb. of ground pork and 1 lb. of ground beef.  I also only used 1/2 onion because of the onion already in the salsa.  Like others, I browned the meat first and then only cooked the peppers for 30 minutes in the oven.

We really enjoyed this recipe and it was really easy to make. I didn't make any changes this time except that I used green peppers because that was what I had. But I think next time I will add some grated cheese to the top and maybe a little more salsa as some of the other reviewers suggested.

I wish I remember what it was I did the first time I made this, it was amazing.  The second time it was still great but didn't have as much flavor.  You definately need to use red,orange and yellow peppers...no green.  They just don't have enough flavor.  My daughter (4yrs) didn't like the crunchy rice on top so I sprinkled more cheese on hers which kept the rice more moist.

Like most people do, I changed this just a little.  I was running late, so I didn't have time to cook the rice for an hour and then bake it for an hour.  So instead, while the rice was cooking, I browned the ground beef, added the salsa to it, then turned it down to simmer while I cut up the peppers (I used RED peppers, too).  By the time the rice was cooked, the peppers were all chopped, so I mixed everything together (I left out the egg) and let it simmer for just a couple minutes (about 5, because I don't like my peppers overly cooked).  It was more like a casserole.  And my family loved it, including my excessively picky husband.

This was a great hit with the family. I did add 1half pack of taco seasoning and some meatloaf sauce canned by Hunts. It added more flavor to the meat and kept it moist and I topped with cheese. I also baked the peppers with olive oil for 20 minutes.  Again, really great recipe.Thanks for sharing it.

These were very good, although the pepper filling seemed a bit dry maybe I didn't put enough salsa. Tasted and smelled great! Will make these again they are easy.

Love the extra spicyness!!!! Using rotel in place of salsa works just as well.  - very tasty!

This was really good.  I actually did not end up stuffing the peppers but cut them up and made a "skillet meal" out of them.  Very yummy.

I too am not overly fond of the green peppers, ever since I tried red peppers, and my husband feels the same.

I loved this recipe, along with the change of flavor pepper, you get the salsa-a lot more vegetables for a healthier meal.

thanks

I really liked these, but next time will probably add cumin, cayenne, etc...  I did add some garlic powder and extra rice (a bit more than double), which came out well.  They are easy to make.  With the extra rice I could have easily made four peppers instead of three.

My DH loved these!  I skipped the cheese on some, and they were just as good.  Easy and yummy.  I made extra and froze them, they heat up great.

I don't know what the big deal is with these. They were okay but nothing to rave about. I made them exactly according to the recipe. I guess we prefer some sort of sauce over them. They were very dry. I did however enjoy the yellow peppers much better than the green. I will keep looking for a stuffed pepper recipe. Sorry.

Thanks, Lisa M, for submitting this great recipe! Like you, I don't care for green peppers; but the red, orange, and yellow peppers were simply divine in combination with the stuffing. I doubled the recipe and left salsa off the tops of half the peppers (to make them more kid friendly). I'll make this again, soon!

This was so good.  I have made it a couple of times.  I used mexican rice instead of white rice and it turned out great.  My husband said it was the best stuffed peppers he ever had.

I followed the recipe for the most part. Here are the changes I made and it turned out delicious.  Instead of using rice, I added 1 1/2 C riced cauliflower.  To make it a little more “fiesta” I added a can of rinsed black beans and about a 1/2 cup shredded Mexican blend cheese to the filling.  I also added a little bit of cayenne pepper and a some chili powder.  Since I added the beans, I did need to make a few more peppers because I had extra filling. I baked for about 1.25 hours, without covering.  When serving, I sprinkled with more cheese and a dollop of sour cream.  My family devoured it!

When I made this, Wife said about  this recipe “where have you been all my life.”. The peppers, not me.  This kicks bland out the window.  Will make again and again.

Surprisingly easy and yummy! Even my 4 and 6 year olds ate it up. I substituted with cauliflower rice for an even healthier option.

Thank you for sharing this recipe. Was very easy to make, and absolutely delicious! It's all in the amount/type of salsa you put in, and whether you get creative adding different types of cheese. I found this was a great base for a great dish! Thanks again!

super easy, healthy and really flavorful, will make it again.  I used ground lamb meat in my families and ground vegan meat in mine.  Both were a hit.

Easy to make, but a tad bland so added a few more spices. I definitely will make again!
