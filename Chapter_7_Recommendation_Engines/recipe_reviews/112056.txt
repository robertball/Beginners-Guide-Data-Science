I followed this recipe quite closely, and it was a gently-spiced, rustic, lemony soup. I used sweet paprika, and I think I'll try hot paprika next time.

Interesting combination of flavours and the dried apricots add a different texture. I used a can of tomatoes since the 'fresh' ones available right now have no flavour.
