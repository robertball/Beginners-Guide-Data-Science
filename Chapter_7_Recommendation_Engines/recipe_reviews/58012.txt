I left out the potatoes and apple cider vinegar in place of the red wine vinegar. DELICIOUS! I cook collard greens pretty often because they are extremely nutritious, but I had never tried using vinegar. Thank you!!! I also found that mine cooked to my desired tenderness in about 25 minutes.

Very good recipe for collard greens.  I did not use the potatoes, I added cidar vinegar, chicken stock and crushed red pepper flakes to the boiling water.  Added garlic along with the onions and bacon.  This recipe was a very good starting point and I'm glad I found it.  Thank you

Since I am pregnant and trying to follow an organic diet as much as possible, I left out the onions to avoid the heartburn and used only 1 tbls of artificial bacon bits instead of actual bacon.  To amp up the taste a bit in the bacon's absence I added 2 cubes of organic vegetable bullion. Since I had no red wine vinegar I substituted balsamic vinegar and white wine vinegar.  Obviously I strayed from the recipe significantly but it turned out delicious.  The bacon would have been tastier, but this more heart healthy.

This recipe is very good. I never tried collards before, and I was glad someone posted this recipe on the website. I didn't have red wine vinegar, so I substituted with Apple Cider Vinegar... IT WAS FABULOUS!!!

Sorry to copy review, but LINAGNEL72' method is the one I used. Also we used too much water along with chicken broth and the flavor was diluted. So at the table I added garlic salt and hot sauce and this spiced it up just enough.

This is the first time I've ever prepared collards myself, and had only sampled them a few times.  I found this dish to be just okay. The vinegar seemed a little overpowering.  Cooking them for so long just seemed to take away any taste.

These weren't as good as my Mothers.  I got the family recipie that I normally use by watching my Mom make it for literally decades, she learned from her Father, who learned it from his Mother, etc.. 

We start by putting 2 onions, quartered, into a stockpoot with hamhocks and neckbnones, and we render them down for about 90 min to 2 hours to get the fat out.  This adds WAY more flavor than even the best bacon can.  We also only use maybe a capful of regular white vinegar along with the usual ingredients and spices.  I added dandelion greens along with Collards, Kale, and Mustard greens, this gives the dish a variety of textures and flavors.  ALSO...hopefully a helpful hint:  if you buy fresh collards and kale, you need to wash and rewash at least 10 times to get all the dirt and grit out.  The best way to loosen the grit is to soak them in lukewarm, bordeting on cold, water with a LOT of salt for about 30 minutes before washing.

Delicious keeper for traditional Southern cooks.  My family adds a can of Rotel instead of the vinegar to have a spicy version.
