A fantastic cinnamon roll recipe that my Husband asks me to make again and again so he can take it to work for his coworkers. I get about 24 large rolls from this yield.  The dough looks a little sticky at first, but if you keep a healthy amount of flour close and keep adding as needed through the 5 minute knead, it firms up beautifully.  Another reviewer suggested the cream cheese frosting, and I won't ice them with anything else...it really makes them bakery quality.  To repeat the posted frosting recipe, it's : 1/2 cup butter, softened 8 ounces cream cheese 4 cups confectioners' sugar 2 teaspoons vanilla extract Directions 1 Beat softened butter and cream cheese until well blended. 2 Add powdered sugar and vanilla. Beat until creamy. Makes 2 Cups.

Heavenly!  These rise very slowly in the refrigerator, so you can make them say, in the afternoon, put a pan in the fridge, and bake them the next morning.  I'm so happy not to have to slave away in the kitchen at 10:00 the night before!

I made this for Christmas Breakfast, and it was a real hit with the family - light and fluffy, even 3 days later!  The author just needs to adjust the amount of suggested flour! (or reduce the amount of water), depending on the quantity of rolls you want. Instead of the 6 c., add 9 c all-purpose flour, and 1 c. more to your desired consistency. The important thing to remember, is NOT to add additional flour after the first rise (dough should be slightly sticky for the light and fluffy part), as flour added in later doesn't mix in well and the result is dry and 'floury'.  Also to knead and even 'throw' the dough down on the counter repeatedy, until dough is elastic.  Dough took 2 hours to rise, so there is no way it can rise double in 45 minutes.  A final recommendation is to bake the rolls only 20 minutes! and anything further creates a dried out pastry that won't be light and fluffy.

These cinnamon buns were awesome.  It made a lot more, It made 45 huge cinnamon buns.  I opted to make the cream cheese icing as suggested and they were better than Cinnabons.  Actually we are having a Christmas Shop at church next week and I've been asked to make these to sell !!!!  Great job and thank you for sharing !!!!

Family told me this was a "grand slam".  Can't do better than that.  One adjustment. Don't know how these could be made with only 2 Tbsp. sugar in the filling. I used lots (about 1 cup) of brown sugar, mixed in the cinnamon and then followed the directions.  Superb.  The cake mix is the secret ingredient.

Wow! Highly recommended. Easy and very tasty. I used equal parts of brown and white sugar, also doubled the amount recommemded, to make them super sticky!

I made these buns on a Saturday morning for the kids brunch. I made the mistake of running out to the store while they were cooling......they must have been good, cause the kids and friends gobbled them all up!

Ok everyone has pretty much said that this recipe needs a LOT more flour than listed.  I just wanted to say that with a lot more sugar and cinnamon and raisins* (I soak my raisins in eggs and a t. of vanilla to moisten them)  They cut better with the floss or string.  AND most importantly they come out MUCH MUCH better if you put them into greased (spray) cupcake pans without liners.  This helps them come out in perfect circles and they are still moist on the inside and golden brown on the outside.

This recipe is wonderful!  My husband says he'll never eat another "Cinnabon" again after having these, his new all time fav.  I used the dough recipe but doubled the carmel recipe from Kathy Newell's as the topping and the bottem. I brought it to a piano recital and got rave reviews. Delicious! Thank you!

These were/are absolutely delicious!! I had a hard time understanding,after eating one of these, how the negative reviewers came to there conclusions? The only thing I can honestly come up with is A)The directions were not followed carefully B)Yeast used had expired or C)Way to much flour which toughened it and made it dense. Otherwise this recipe is a "cinnamon bun fans" best friend! I was shocked at how eas this recipe was actually! After many attempts with other recipes this one has shined through for me. Adding that extra cup of flour was necessary and a bit more cinnamon as well-That is the only reason I gave the recipe 4 stars, for the in-accuracy of measurements. To all reading reviews for this recipe, be patient and follow carefully the advice within the reviews and your "Buns" will be a success!!!

These ARE the best ever... And, in my first attempt at actually using homemade dough (versus premade or cresent rolls), I appreciate the clarity of the directions.  Being very careful to follow them exactly as written, as far as the dough preparation goes, I have never had a mistake in the 5 times I have made them in the past few months. (I have sent them with my husband for his two "golf weekends" and to work a few times...my popularity has increased!)   THE ONLY change I make is to boil 1/2 c margarine, 3/4 cup brown sugar and 2 teaspoons of cinnamon to make a caramel mixture to cover the bottom of the pan before adding the rolls.  AWESOME!  Thanks for boosting my confidence with yeast!!!

I used butter for the oil, milk for the water, brown sugar for the white in the filling and doubled the cinnamon in the filling.
I halved this recipe, made 15 buns in 3 9" round pans.
Delicious buns and very easy, no problems with rolling out dough.

These were really good.  Everyone was so impressed to see homemade cinnamon buns, but they really weren't hard at all.  I rolled them and cut them and then froze them right in the pan.  Later I took them out, let them thaw and double in size and then baked.  They turned out perfect.

This was not a huge success in my house.  We found the yellow cake mix gave the rolls a rather artificial taste. However the icing did "save" these a bit.

Nice texture and flavour. But needed a lot of extra flour to work the dough. I halved the recipe, made 18 medium rolls. Freezed half and baked the other half. Would increase cinnamon in future.

I first tried this recipe using a yellow cake mix and the recommended amount of oil and the results were so so. Next time I used a golden cake mix and increased the amount of oil, and the results were spectacular! Good recipe.

These are very, very good.  Don't let the bad reviews keep you from giving these a try.  I used bread flour and 1/2 cup less water.  Also used a white cake mix (only kind in my panty), a bit more filling and these were really light, big & fluffy.  They were gobbled up fast.  Thank you!

Overated? No way! These buns taste great, they are easy to make, and my whole family enjoyed them. Be sure to use a good quality mix. I made mine the night before and chilled them. In the morning I let them sit out and rise as usual, and they were absolutely perfect!

I scaled this recipe by 1/2 and it came out great. I made the rolls on Christmas Eve, let them rise overnight, and baked them on Christmas morning. They came out perfectly - tasted just like ones you buy at the bakery. I've tried other cinnamon roll recipes before and never have been completely satisfied. I will definitely use this one again. Thanks re!

My first ever cinnamon rolls and everybody loved them! I needed some extra flour because the dough was very sticky at first but I will definitely make these again. Also the dough freezes really well!

Sorry, I was really disappointed with this recipe.  I was looking forward to homemade cinnamon rolls.  Neither my husband nor I enjoyed the flavor or texture of the rolls.

I don't like giving recipes a negative rating, but this one made the "don't make again" list.  The dough was extremely sticky.  I couldn't even work with it.  I put the dough in my Kitchen Aid with the dough hook just to be able to work it.  I had to keep adding flour just to be able to pick it up.  But I went ahead with the recipe any way.  I wanted to call it quits when it came time to roll it out.  Some how I rolled the dough up and baked them.  They baked fine, but the buns had no taste.  I guess because of all the flour I used.  They were very dry and bland.  I'm sorry, but I will not be making these again!!!

These are good but not what I expected.
They are yummy if you just want a cinn.
bunn but not for a cinnamon roll.

Delicious.  I made the dough and cut the rolls last night, covered them, and refrigerated til this morning.  I took them out an hour before baking and let them come to room temperature.  They rose in the oven beautifully, with a light and fluffy texture.  I did make a couple of changes;  I substituted melted butter for the oil and I used half water and half milk for the liquid and added 1 tsp vanilla to the dough before adding the flour.  Thanks to the other reviewers who noted that more flour was needed--I ended up having to add another 2 cups.  My whole family loved these buns, however.  These are the permanent recipe for cinnamon buns at my house from now on.  So much better than the ones that taste like bread with cinnamon.  The cake mix is a wonderful addition.  Thanks for the fantastic recipe.

These are "the best ever".   You'll never want to use another recipe again!!   I have made them many times and give one of the pans away to friends and family.   People actually request I make them again----and soon!!    Be certain to have extra flour on hand when you are kneading the dough.   This dough can be rather sticky.

Best-ever cinnamon rolls! Loved them! I got rave reviews from friends and family. I had to add 1 extra cup of flour to the recipe.  They had to cook longer than recipe required.

these buns definitely arn't the best. they don't taste all that great, and check your buns often, or you'll end up running to the kitchen to find that they are black and they've only been cooking for 15 mins.

These are the best cinnamon buns ever to make from home.  1st time I made them, I discovered it was way more than our 2-person house could eat so I sent my husband to work with some. His co-workers thought I was amazing and asked when I could make them again.  I used extra sugar and cinnamon. Probably, 1/2 c. sugar and 6 TBSP cinnamon.  Really, i eyed it to to just smother a thick coating over the dough before rolling.  I wanted it to turn out like Cinnabon's Rolls... and did they ever!  The key was loads of cinnamon and sugar.  Don't be afraid. The more, the merrier.  It's very forgiving.  This is supposed to be a sweet treat :)

These turned out big, fluffy and fabulous! I knew the recipe was a winner when I took the first pan out to the neighborhood kids playing in the yard and it was empty in 30 seconds. They're my most honest food critics and they loved it. I sprinkled about 1/4 cup of cinnamon chips along with the sugar and cinnamon. Next time, I'm gonna add a few pecans and some brown sugar and a bit more cinnamon. This is a great recipe!

It's OK.  I think is makes much more than 2 dozen, because my rolls were HUGE and didn't get all the way done in 35 minutes.  Good taste, though - I will try again and make more.  I don't think I got the best taste out of the because they were still doughy.  Coworkers ate them anyway, but they eat anything...

A little time consuming for me to prepare. It may have been because it was my first adventure with yeast & kneading. However, got rave reviews from kids and neighbours who tried them. Will make again!

Wonderful recipe.  Very tender rolls.  After shaping into cinnamon rolls I froze them on a cookie sheet and then stored them in a freezer bag to use as I needed.  Freezes great!!

This recipe is really the "best ever".  They turned out light and fluffy just like the ones that you can get in the mall.  Just the recipe that I was looking for.  I have made them twice now once with cream cheese and once with the glaze and they were GREAT!!
I highly reccommend this recipe to anyone!!

This wa my first time making cinnamon rolls and I was reaaly surprised when they turned out so well!  They were so soft and moist!  It only took a couple hours to make and they are so worh it!  Everyone loved it!
They were like the Cinnabon ones only with a different topping. :-)

This is a great recipe just as it is -- BUT -- if you want to make the sticky buns extra gooey -- try this.  Use a small box of Cook and Serve Butterscotch pudding mix (be sure it is not the instant but the cooked kind).  Sprinkle half the package on each of the two pieces of dough.  I cut the sugar in half and add a little brown sugar instead -- just eyeballed it by sprinkling it on.  I also added chopped pecans - I used lots as I really like them.

This was the nicest yeast dough I have ever seen, you could do a lot of different stuff just with the dough, but I made two pans of it makes a lot.  They were THE BEST EVER!!  They take some time but well worth it.

I used the cream cheese frosting instead of the sticky bun frosting and they turned out great. It was my first time working with dough that needed yeast, kneading etc. I was a little concerned with letting the dough rise, because I felt it didn't rise enough or like it was suppose to, but regardless they turned out great!  I made them for work and everyone loved them.I did smash up some pecans and placed them into the rolls along with the cinnamon. Great recipe!

These taste very good.  I used a cream cheese frosting instead.  The next day I popped on in the microwave to warm it up, then spread the cream cheese frosting on top, and it was so yummy!

This is the cream cheese frosting I used.  I found it somewhere on this website.

1/2 cup butter, softened 
8 ounces cream cheese 
4 cups confectioners' sugar 
2 teaspoons vanilla extract 
 

 Directions     
1 Beat softened butter and cream cheese until well blended. 
2 Add powdered sugar and vanilla. Beat until creamy. 
 Makes 2 Cups.

Great recipe- best described as tasting like Cinnabon's cinnamon rolls.  Very soft rolls- tasted great even the next day when re-heated- a lot of yeast doughs harden up the next day- not these!!  I topped half of the rolls with cream cheese icing and the other half I made into sticky buns.

This is a great recipe!  I wasn't sure about the cake mix but I followed the recipe exactly and these cinnamon buns are the best I've ever made!  Thank you for a new family favorite.

This recipe just replaced my old stand-by for "sticky buns"!  These are easier to make and taste better than any I have ever had.  The only thing different was I added a pinch of ground clove to the cinnamon sugar.  I will defintly make again next weekend for a family get together.

These are wonderful cinnamon buns..and they couldnt get much easier! Wonderful texture..sweet and soft. The cake mix is the secret. I only changed a couple things. I used a bit more butter and melted it in the microwave before pouring it over the rolled out dough. Lots more cinnamon AND BROWN SUGAR INSTEAD OF WHITE SUGAR. For the icing I made a maple cream cheese icing, 8oz of cream cheese softened..add the confectioners sugar,melted butter,vanilla extract and milk..then whip till fluffy.. Instead of spreading the icing over the cinnamon buns, I put the icing in a plastic zip-close bag, snipped off the a corner and drizzled over the buns that way. The cream cheese icing is so wonderfully rich and delicious that I think if you use too much it takes away from the cinnamon.  YOU HAVE TO TRY THESE PEOPLE! I HAVE SOLD THESE TO A LOCAL RESTURANT AND PEOPLE ADORE THEM...NEIGHBOR PLACE ORDERS FOR THEM FOR THE HOLIDAYS..HAVE FUN MAKING THESE. MAKING A BATCH TODAY..WILL POST A PHOTO SOON!

Seriously these are the best ever. I was experimenting with several different recipes in an effort to find the perfect one, and now I can stop. Hands down my whole family's favorite. Thank you for this heavenly recipe!  It may be the humidity here in Houston, but I knead in at least an extra cup of flour to the sticky dough, just until it's workable. After it rises, stickiness is no longer an issue.  And I use soy milk in the icing, for what it's worth.  The best part about these rolls, besides the taste of course, is that they're reproducible - I get the exact same yummy result each time.  Making them ahead works well, too - I just put the risen rolls in the fridge in their pans and let them come to room temp before I bake.  This recipe is also adaptable for being creative.  My daughter loves pink, so I tried a strawberry cake mix - delicious! - and then I found that lemon, orange, banana, and chocolate (with Nutella in the middle!) all work well.  Sometimes I replace some of the butter in the icing with cream cheese.  I'm looking forward to trying brown sugar with the cinnamon next time.  Long story short - make them!  You'll be glad you did. :)

These cinnamon rolls turned out GREAT!! I'm a high school student and I made them for some of my guy friends and male teachers. They loved them. My sister wants to start a new Christmas tradition with them because she loved them so much! I was a little concerned at first because the dough was so sticky (I was afraid I had lost count on the flour) but after kneading and rising, the dough was easy to roll out with flour. I used the suggested icing instead of the icing that came with the recipe and it was amazing. That icing was- 1/2 cup butter, softened; 8 oz. cream cheese, softened; 2 tsp. vanilla; and 4 cups powdered sugar. Combine butter and cream cheese, then add sugar and vanilla.  I also added much more cinnamon and sugar to the rolls so you could really taste it. Great recipe! :)

Best Ever! For months I hesitated writing a review since I use the recipe to make rolls, not buns. Recipe is made every four to eight weeks to freeze for future use (they don't last long in our household). Having bought a package of factory-made cinnamon rolls with layers that peeled away, I was intrigued to make them. After watching allrecipes' video on making cinnamon rolls, I chose to use this recipe. Within six months, I perfected the method I needed. The last batch yielded 10 dozen rolls. Needs no sugar coating. I separate dough into four balls, not two. Each ball is rolled out approximately 3/8- to 1/2-inch thick. To create layers that peel off, spread more soft butter on top of dough (I use about 1/3 to 1/2 stick). Using a sifter, I evenly spread a layer of cinnamon/sugars/pinch of nutmeg on the butter then hand-sprinkle finely-chopped nuts on top of that. Using a dull knife, I cut the rolled out dough in half and roll individually. This allows me to roll the dough tightly making it as small as possible (remember, dough will rise before baking). Again using a dull knife, I cut 1/2-inch thick pieces along the entire length of the log. With a metal spatula, I carefully move then lay each piece flat on a cookie sheet to rise. Recipe bakes as directed.

I made these for the family and they LOVED them.   I did need to increase the rising time and flour as many others have stated.   I think I will try them again and use less water.  I believe the taste will improve with less flour.  I cheated and used premade cream cheese frosting and added some pecans to one pan!  they were GREAT!

Made these rolls, they are excellent. I used my Kitchen Aid mixer to mix them and knead them. They were a snap to make.I froze two pans uncooked. I will let you know how they do when frozen. I didn't let them do the second rise, figure they can do that when I thaw them.

these were GREAT, my college aged sister and her roommates were obsessed with them.  the dough was kind of a sticky mess though, so i had to add a lot of extra flour, probably about an extra 1.5 cups.  but they were fun to make and i'll definitely make them again.

Excellent! Took some time to make, but it was well worth it. I used dark brown sugar instead of the white sugar. My family loved them and asked me when I will be making them again!

Love this recipe!! The dough is so easy to work with. I also had to add about another cup of flour after turning out after mixing but they still came out light and yummy. I changed the sugar to half brown and half white for more intense flavor and added raisens. These were a hit at my husbands office.

Absolutely out of this world! I've made a lot of cinnamon rolls in my time but never got the results like I had from this recipe. The dough handled better than any I've made up before, it was a delight to roll, seal, and cut. They rose and baked up beautifully, in fact they overwhelmed the pan; they must have ended up four inches high!. The texture was incredible, I've never seen the likes of it! As for flavor, you absolutely can not buy anything that would surpass them. I just got done baking them up for Christmas Eve and they were a hit, the star of the show! It has to be the addition of the cake mix that does the trick! Whoever submitted this has my thanks for sharing a recipe that I will gladly and happily make over and over again to the delight of my cinnamon roll loving husband, family, and neighbors!

These are really great - have been a huge hit for me at work.  I use some milk and/or 1/2 and 1/2 to replace some of the warm water, and also add an extra egg as I'm at high altitude and that seems to help hold the air in the dough.  I used the brown sugar/granulated sugar combo with extra cinnamon and about double the volume this recipe calls for - more gooey stuff inside!  Also, cream cheese frosting is my preference.

The easiest and most delicious roll dough I have ever made.  Like other reviews, I used 8 1/2 c flour - I can't imagine how 6 c could do for anyone.  I did not use the recipe for the cinnamon/sugar/butter - did my own thing because I like it very buttery and sweet.  But this will be my dough recipe for life - great one and thanks for posting!

Consistency is pretty good. I've had problems getting the soft, gooeyness that I love in cinnamon rolls with the recipes I've tried. This was good!  The taste just wasn't what I expected, though. It almost tasted like sour dough, honestly. I expect that replacing the veggie oil with maybe softened butter-flavored shortening might help the flavor. I think the dough needs some honey or sugar, as well.   Some things that might have been left out for newer cinnamon roll makers:  1) When rolling, roll tightly. After cutting, make sure you pinch the bottom of each piece before placing it in the pan. Otherwise, all the "stuff" just falls out in baking. Cutting with a dull knife or using floss doesn't always work well for me.  2) Using two 9X13 dishes worked well for me, and it made 24 buns. They should be about 3/4 inch or so apart in the pan when you place them. They'll be close together after rising.   3) The second rise might take 45 minutes to an hour.   4) Some people prefer brown sugar as opposed to white sugar for filling.

These were rather dissapointing. The dough originally seemed that it would be perfect, but upon cooking and tasting, the dough is just not quite right for a cinnamon roll. It is more cakey than would be desired for the perfect cinnamon roll. They look good and taste ok, but just ok. I had high hopes for this one!

Good, but definitely needed more filling. Used a whole lot more than six cups of flour to get the dough to a workable consistency. Cinnamon buns were very "bread-like". Be sure to check out the "Clone of a Cinnabon" recipe if you're looking for something a little more authentic.

I am a cinnamonbunaholic if that's possible. I have made many many different recipes and so far, this is the best I have found.  I like them large, so I usually only get 16-18 from the recipe and I use more cinnamon than recommended, but these are SOOOOOOO GOOD!  Thanks for this great recipe!

WOW! are these good. I was a bit skeptical about using a cake mix to make cinnamon rolls but I am SO glad that I did! These are so flakey and moist. My hubby, who is a huge cinnabon fan, LOVES them!.  Only changes were that I used bread flour instead of all purpose, added a tsp of vanilla to the dough mix and doubled the butter and the filling (hey if you are going to be bad be ALL the way bad!).  I made a simple cinnamon/vanilla icing drizzle to add a bit of "sweet" to the tops. They turned out great! Take a chance on this recipe. SO worth it.

I had never made cinnamon buns before. It had been eight years since Ive baked anything besides biscuits from the pioneer mix. This is a good recipe, it's easy to make ok cinnamon rolls, but for really good to great takes a little tweaking the recipe. Ive made this recipe about 8 times now. From following the recipe word for word and having to add more flour, to adjusting the amount of water. Like gardengirl said, you need to adjust the flour or amount of water. The first change I made was to the flour, but the rolls came out a little flat in taste, next time I tried less water it was ok. Third I tried more flour again but added 1/2 cup sugar. I found the adding slightly more flour with sugar to be good. Also after reading gardnergirl I went with a way sticker dough than I had done anytime before and with a harsher/longer kneading, my buns became much fluffier. one key is the rising. It must rise. both before you roll out and after you cut the rolls (use a way sharp knife, I use a steak knife and mind the counter or your wife will totally freak.) for a good rise you need a good yeast mix. may help to add a teaspoon of sugar to yeast mix even if your using 'easy yeast'. also dont roll out too thin, roll it out a little thicker than you think may be necessary this will really help in the fluffy. I roll mine out thick on one end, thin on the starting end then I roll a little loose to much tighter. this gives center room to expand and will alleviate the cinnamon-mountain. LOL.

Too bad there aren't more stars. This is absolutely wonderful. I tried it several years ago for my son's scout troop when they went to winter camp. It became a yearly request, and even now that my son has aged out of scouts, they still ask me to make a batch every year. I do make the caramel gooey stuff for the bottom of the pan: 1/2 c margarine, 3/4 c brown sugar, and 2 t. cinnamon. Heat till sugar is melted and put on bottom of pan. I also used the cream cheese topping: 1/2 c butter, 8 oz. softened cream cheese, 4 c confectioners sugar, 2 t vanilla extract. Beat softened butter & cream cheese until well blended, add powdered sugar & vanilla. Beat until fluffy and creamy.
I too used brown sugar instead of white, and doubled the sugar, butter and cinnamon for the inside. Also added extra flour, and used dental floss to cut them. The first time I put them in a really big pan, and the ones in the middle didn't cook through, so be sure to use a smaller pan.

These came out ENORMOUS.  Very good and easier than I expected.  Wish I had halved recipe.  Have a dozen or so taking up a lot of room in freezer!  Was traveling over the weekend and stopped at a Cinnabon® to compare.  VERY close in flavor. Would make again.

This is a fantastic recipe. I halved the recipe, followed the instructions and added 1/2 cup extra of flour. I also made the buns in the evening, placed them in the fridge overnight and the next morning I let them rest at room temp for 1 hour and them baked them. My husband and I woke up to the yummy smell of cinnamon buns. Great recipe.

This is a good recipe for cinnamon rolls. I used brown sugar instead of white for the fillings, it makes a difference. Next time, I will reduce the water a little bit & I recommend pouring some caramel frosting before the buttercream.

As usual with the best-rated recipes here, these are a bit over-rated - but they are great.  They make slightly less sticky/gooey buns, which isn't what I'm used to, but they grew on me (I did add extra filling as reviewers suggested).  I did not try the cream cheese glaze, mostly because other family members whined, but I would if I make these again.  I found they tasted better the next morning.  Also, don't overbake them - I think 35 minutes is definitely too long (I did about 20).

This is the best recipe. Will be making these on a regular basis! I did have to add an extra cup of flour while forming the dough and had to add another cup of flour while kneading, but they came out very soft and were still wonderful when we finished them 2 days later. Will try freezing unbaked rolls next time, as there are only 2 of us and this recipe made 30 huge rolls.

recipe was fantastic,, dough was great,, I had to add another cup of flour though.  To the filling, I added strawberry preserves, with a bit of flour to absorb the water, and walnuts and raisins, I will be referring back to this often.

They were very good and easier than other recipes I had tried.  I was amazed at how soft the dough was....I added more flour, but will try it with less next time around.  The cake mix definitely gives them a unique taste.

I spent three hours making these yesterday and all I got was little tastless cinammon bricks, the dough didnt rise, Could I have gotten bad yeast?, just bought it the day before. I tried cutting them in half today and toasting them in butter to see if they would soften up...., no luck. So I have to rate these as not good.

This makes a lovely, pliable and workable cinnamon roll dough. I used a different filling and frosting but the roll dough is spot on! I also used a white cake mix.

After reading some of the other reviews, I decided to make the filling by using 1 1/2 cups of packed brown sugar and 1 1/2 tablespoons of cinnamon.  They turned out perfect that way!  I was not too pleased with the icing....it came out too runny for me....I may try a cream cheese frosting next time.

These are great!  I had to add another 3/4 cup of flour, but it did not dry it out a bit.  I prepped the buns and wrapped them with plastic to store overnight in the fridge.  Baked them first thing in the morning for an excellent brunch treat.  I used raisens in one dozen and craisens in the other.  The craisens were awesome!  Dont forget to let plump in hot water for 30min first though.  Also added cream cheese to the icing.  Yummy!

This is a solid recipe. Don't bother with the cream cheese, the printed icing is great. I did the minimum preperation time on everything, baked right away, and these turned out awesome! Took some advice off one of the other reviews and cut bake time to 20 minutes. Perfect. What a wild dough.

This is the best ever recipe!  Thank you!!  Only thing I did different was to us 2 cups of warm water and after mixing the cake mix and 1 cup flour I added in only four more cups of flour.  The last cup of flour I kneaded in at the end with about 1/2 cup more.  Came out perfect!
Thanks again!

this was the best recipe ever. i used another filling so i can only rate the dough, which i believe is the heart of the recipe. it was amazing. i was a little iffy about the recipe calling for yellow cake mix but it took out some of the work of adding extra ingredients. i made the dough at about 4pm before christmas then i popped it in the fridge over night. christmas morning i put in the filling and rolled them up and realized i was supposed to let them rise again and i had a half hour until family arrived for breakfast! i put them in a baking dish on top of the oven hoping some extra heat would help them rise. i only did that for 15 minutes, even though they definately need more time, then i popped them in the oven & in 20 minutes they were finished. they came out more on the doughy side but it was exactly like a cinnabon! everyone LOVED them. i used the icing recipe given on first review. the filling i used was 1/2 c softened butter, 1 c brown sugar, 2 tsp cinnamon. using a little extra wouldve made them extra gooey. i will be making this again and again and next time i will try letting them rise completely. excellent buns!

These were delicious.  Time consuming and messy...but worth it.  My warnings...IT MAKES A TON!!!  I put them in 2   8X8 pans and 1   9X13 and once they rose, they were OVERFLOWING!!  It was a total of 26 rolls.  I made them for our family and each of my neighbors.  Also, I used my Kitchen Aide stand mixer and it was too full.    As for the recipe, as others recommended it did take about 7.5 c. of flour and I used 1 c. brown sugar and 2.5 T. of cinnamon and butter for the filling.  The frosting was sooooo runny!  I ended up adding more butter and sugar and it was still like water.  Next time I will make a different frosting.  I also used soy milk because of our allergies.  Skip the frosting and use your own recipe.    I will make this again, but for special occasions only.

Okay, I by passed this recipe so many times because it called for cake mix.  After failing with the other recipes, I decided to give this a try. OMG these are the best!! They taste just like Cinnabon Cinnamon Rolls!! My friends and family were amazed how light and fluffy and oh so good these are....Thank you for sharing this, I will never buy another can of cinnamon rolls again!!

This recipe was really sub-par. I was leery of a cake mix in a bread recipe to begin with but I had one I needed to use up so thought what the heck. First of all, after adding all the ingredients the "dough" was like soup. I added at least another 2 cups just to get a very soft dough, really should have added more but didn't want them to end up tasting flour-y. Finally, the finished product was seriously lacking in any flavor other than a slight cake mix taste. Sorry I will never again veer from the Clone of a Cinnabon recipe.

I have made these twice and I have to say my family love them!  Very easy and very rewarding.  If you are making cinnamon buns for the first time, I HIGHLY recommend this recipe!  My kids won't eat the pilsbury cinnamon buns...only if it's the last resort for breakfast...!!!

I tried this recipe for a Red Cross Blood Drive our organization was having.  I doubled the recipe and used brown sugar instead of white sugar.  I had no rolls left!!  There were people arguing over who was gonna get the last one!  I will keep this recipe for life!

I used 2 1/4 cups water and 7 cups flour and it worked out great.  I added 1 tsp vanilla to the dough.  Also I used 4 tbsp white sugar and 4 tbsp brown sugar with the 3 tbsp cinnamon for the filling.  Also used the cream cheese frosting recipe that has been posted.  Everyone LOVED them - no need to try another cinnamon roll recipe EVER!

The first thing I thought when I bit into this was, "I can't believe I made this!". SO GOOD! This was my first time making any sort of bun, let alone cinnamon buns and they turned out so well. It did take about 85 minutes for my dough to double the first time, so allow some time there, as others have said. I used FlourGirl's icing recipe and it was perfect. Next time I might try it with an orange cream cheese icing... yum. Thank you so much for making me feel like a validated baker! :)

These cinnamon rolls are great with a few alterations to the recipe. I decreased the amount of water to about 2 cups so that extra flours did not have to be added. (I found that in me first batch with the extra flour, they were just too floury and dry.) Also, I used brown sugar instead of white and double the amount. After cutting the rolls, I let them rise for several hours, so they were the size of Cinnabon cinnamon rolls. I only cooked them for 20 minutes. They are actually softer once reheated in the microwave for about 30 seconds. This is the only cinnamon roll recipe I've used, and it's the last one I'll need.

This recipe was awesome! The softest cinammon buns I have ever made! It was a hit with the family. I did some things differently... I used brown sugar instead of white sugar and I added raisins to the dough. I also found that you have to use a cake mix that doesn't have pudding in the mix. But I love this recipe! Thank you for sharing !

They were great. I used golden cake mix, brown sugar, and more than the called for cinnamon, but there still wasn't a strong cinnamon flavor. I will add more cinnamon next time. This recipe made 24 large rolls for me and my flour ended up being 9 1/2 cups! Thank goodness I've got a Kitchen-Aid or it would have burned out the motor. Still, very good recipe and I will be making it again (maybe 1/2 at a time).

I too needed to add 1 1/2 cups extra flour. They came out AWESOME, but I think I will use brown sugar and pecans next time. BTW, the dental floss works the best!

p.s. I made my umteenth batch today, cutting the water to 2 cups works fine. You dont want the dough stiff at all or the buns will be dry. You want a nice elastic dough.

p.p.s Proof your yeast with a small amount of water and a tspn sugar, then you can add enough water to the dry ing. to make a nice dough without sacrificing the flavor by adding too much flour.
These are awesome with a simple cream cheese icing.

I just baked my first batch of these scrumptious buns, and I have to say they were absolutely super!!  I tweaked the recipe, by adding a tsp of cinnamon in the dough, and 1 1/2 cups more flour. The dough is sticky, but workable with my bread hook on my mixer.  They only took 25 minutes to bake. I can't wait to bake a lot more batches for Christmas gifts.

these come out very nice. You want to roll the dough out thin and when you roll it back up make sure it is tight.  They look very nice this way.  Also, when making the icing, add almond extract in as well as the vanilla.  They are very good when they are convered with icing and then stored.

These are very delicious, although I used about 8 cups of flour not 6, and I used less cinnamon and sugar, but they still have a very nice flaky sweet bread which has been difficult for me to make in the past.

I have not had great results in the world of yeast breads in the past, but this recipe is truly the best!!  Thank you!  Followed previous advice and added more flour (about a cup and a half) and this made the lightest fluffiest rolls EVER!  Cinnabon who???

Made this recipe to bake my neighbors a nice treat. While the dough turned out fabulous - I followed it to a T, it is majorly lacking in the filling portion and the icing. I'll be remaking it tomorrow but likely tripling the sugar/cinnamon portion, or finding another recipe that will produce something nicer, and a cream cheese icing.

I made some alterations as well.  I used a golden cake mix as suggested.  Make sure you use a quality cake mix and not the generic or store brand as this makes a difference. I didn't feel as if there was enough sugar for the filling.  In addition to the white sugar, I added approx. 3/4 cup brown sugar plus about an extra tablespoon of cinnamon.  these were fairly easy to make.  I took them to church and they were gobbled up!  I was the hero of the day.  But I also made them with cream cheese icing, this is what really makes these the best rolls.  Not sure if the glaze would be enough.  You really need to icing these while they are warm.

This was my first attempt making cinnamon rolls and only my second time baking with yeast.  I made the mall pretzels that are on this website and they turned out great these rolls unfortunately did not.  All it says is to bake in pans. It doesn't say what kind of pans so I just put 20 in a 13x9 and 4 more in another pan I should have known better but did it anyways. Please DO NOT bake in a 13x9!!!!!! Cook them in either four 9" round pans or in muffin tins. I just think they would definitely have turned out better that way cuz the buns in the middle were not cooked even after 40 mins. The recipe for the buns is pretty decent but the baking instructions were not complete. I had high hopes but was let down but I will try and make again even though I was pretty frustrated!

I was skeptical about how close they would be to the real Cinnabon, but I have to say these are amazingly soft and fluffy just like the original. It does take a little time to make, but so worth it. I used a cream cheese frosting. Definitely will make these again. 2 thumbs up!

These remind me of the cinnamon rolls I had as a kid that were packaged on a yellow and white corrugated paper tray.  The texture is somewhere between bread and cake. There not bad, but I'll keep looking for a recipe that yields a gooier roll.

I have to start by saying, this is not a recipe for someone who has never worked with dough.   It, like EVERY dough recipe requires your own discretion, talent and experience. 
With that said, these are really yummy. 
And note, these are not sticky buns, they are cinnamon buns. 
I added a sticky topping and they were scrumptious!! Soft, full and beautiful! 
But they only get 4 stars (I'd give 4.5) because the recipe is tough. 
I halfed the recipe (used 2 eggs) and easily filled a 9x13 plus another 8 x 8. Also, I did not measure my filling, I just put in as much butter and sugar as I wanted.
I added a bit more flour than the recipe called for in the mixing part to make it a sticky but managable texture. Again, use your discretion but, I imagine that if you don't use enough flour, they could have a little cake taste. Mine did not.
P.S. We hate Cinnabons and these weren't anything like them.

Not sure what happened but mine turned out dry and definitely were not the ooey gooey treats I was expecting!  Rose nicely, smelled wonderful, but the flavor just didn't win me over.  For the amount of time they take to prepare, I don't think I will be trying these again.  Maybe they just need more of the cinnamon/sugar/butter in the middle?

I thought the filling needed more cinnamon and sugar. I added about 2 tablespoons for each half and added liberal amounts of sugar, too. Great recipe!

Great recipe! My two suggestions are to use three packages of yeast instead of two. Rises faster and you get a "lighter" result. I also replaced the water with milk!

Yum!  Used 3/4 cup brown sugar, 3/4 cup white sugar, and 2 tbsp of cinnamon for filling- will probably increase that to a cup of each sugar next time.  Otherwise, excellent!

The name says it all.  They were very tender and chewy with the right amount of sweetness.  The glaze was delicious.  I mixed in some cream cheese in and they were the "best ever"!

These are the BEST cinnamon rolls I have ever made!  I thought they were really easy to make, too.  I did have to use about 7.5 cups of flour total but other than that, the recipe is perfect as written. Thanks!

these truly are the best ever! I did change the filling and made my own mixture of 1c butter, 1c each white and brown sugar and some cinnamon. Just kinda tossed it in the bowl and mixed it up, then spread it on the dough before rolling. This made it much for sticky and sweet! yumm! Also I used the cream chz icing instead of the icing listed here. Much more tasty. I've received rave reviews with this recipe. Family and friends asking for the recipe and my inlaws even want me to mail them some! lol One other thing I did after reading other reviews, I let the dough rise for 2 hrs initially. It's work, but well worth it! I highly recommend making this recipe, you won't be disappointed!

These turned out great yet only because I didn't panic. You say use only 6 cups of flour yet 1 and 1/2 cups of water when dissolving the yeast. This faulty ratio almost wasted a lot of food yet my dad came to the rescue. We ended up using 13 cups of flour because a dough couldn't be made from that original ratio. I strongly suggest you use less water or more flour to save yourself a mess. The end result was very delicious.

I wasn't too impressed with these. I followed the recipe but the buns were heavy and hard and I didn't like the icing. I'm going to keep looking for a recipe and will stick to the traditional cream cheese icing.

whoa these were amazing!!! my dough didn't really rise in the beginning but i rolled it out anyways and followed instructions. i let them rise for about 35 mins while they were cut and in the pan. to make them super gooey i melted on a saucepan a stick of butter with 1/2 cup of brown sugar and poured half on top and half on the bottom of the pan before i baked them and they're amazing. i also used 8 oz creamcheese, a stick of butter, 2 tsps vanilla extract, and 3 cups confectionary sugar for the icing. however the process took me half a day. so these are nice for every once in a while. thanks a lot =).

These were amazing!  I just had one question.....as they baked the butter/sugar mixture in the dough melted and pooled around the rolls....this caused the bottoms of the rolls to get very brown and hard.  I used two pans...one stone and one metal and the rolls on the metal pan even tasted a little like burnt sugar......HOW DO I PREVENT THIS?  (I did follow the recipe and did not increase the mixture at all)

I have made these cinnamon rolls countless times.  After raising, I separate into two clumps, roll out as stated, butter and cinnamon mix, then on one half I add chunky seasoned applesauce.  The other half I add peaches that I have chunky chopped and seasoned.   

BIG HIT!  I, too, use more flour than called for but I've never had a failure with this recipe or a complaint!

Good rolls, of course it need more flour like others have said.  I think a thicker frosting would be more to our liking, but good nonetheless.

Warning! You need a lot more flour than the recipe indicates. I don't know how much more I used but I estimate that it's about 2 cups more. The dough is a bit fiddly, but the buns turned out great! The recipe made a lot more than I thought but the buns freeze well.

Not good at all.  They were not gooey enough, or at all for that matter.  I have made them twice thinking the first time it was my fault but both times they turned out awful.  I will not make this again.

I am an experienced baker.  This recipe was hard to work with.  I had to work in almost 3 more cups of flour to get it to where I could roll it out.  It was a tender but dry dough. I probably won't make it again.

I made these for a brunch party. I have to say the cinnamon buns looked impressive. My husband and all my guests loved them but I thought they were just okay. It seemed like a lot of work for the end product. And as one reviewer said, the dough was extremely sticky. I'll probably make them again though.

Well... These were ok... We're used to Cinnabons.. we'll even take that 30 min trip to the nearest mall just for the Cinnabons soooo these weren't Cinnabons but out of other cinnamon buns that I've tried to make this was the best so far. We doubled the cinnamon and it still wasn't enough for us but the bread and frosting were definatly nice and the whole family (including my sister's family) all ate them. The pudding in the bread definatly makes a nice difference.

This recipe was a hit at my women's meeting at church. I was able to transport them in my pyrex carrying case, which allowed them to still be warm at the end of our meeting. Everyone loved them and commented on how soft they were.  I feel that the cake mix is the trick in making these rolls different from the typical roll.  Thank you for submitting this recipe!!!

These are the best cinnamon buns I have ever made! I have tried many recipes,this was the easiest and best.I used more flour, about 1 cup more so the dough was easy to handle.This recipe would be good for any sweet dough applications, such as sweedish tea ring etc.These are a s good as the expensive cinnamon buns here that sell for 10.00 for 6 and I had 22 very large cin buns!My family loved them and they were all gone in 2 days!I would recommend this recipe to anyone, and will be using it many times in the future.Thankyou,Kerry,B.C.

Very good recipe.  Immediate family favorite.  We've made several batches since.  One batch I tried with orange flavoring in the icing and everyone enjoyed it!

These cinnamon rolls are EXTREMELY good. I like them better that the ones from Cinnabon because they are not as sweet. They are sweet, but not to an excess. This recipe is going in my 'favorites' pile.

I made these cinnamon rolls for the first time today. I followed dough recipe exactly but I added pecans to the sugar and cinnamon mixture. They turned out better than My old recipe I’ve been using for years. This is a keeper.

They rose about 1/2 as much as I would have liked. It might have been my yeast. I also did't put enough mixture in the roll as I had a jar of sugar and cinnamon already mixed and I just sprinkled some on. I should have followed the directions more. In any case, these were very very good. I used a cream cheese topping and that certainly does not hurt them.

Have passed this recipe to numerous friends who say it is the easiest they have ever made.  Makes large amounts which freeze fantastically!  They never dry out and always taste like the day they were made.  If quantity is too much, I use some of the dough to make loafs of bread.  I made no changes to this great recipe!     KK

Very good dough. Took more than double the cinnamon and sugar to do the fill and I still felt there wasn’t enough. Going to try someone’s brown sugar suggestion next time. Also go with the cream cheese frosting in the comments. Fantastic

Soo delicious! I made a few changes. I used quick rise yeast, so I added it to the flour and cake-mix. I then scalded a cup and half of milk with a half a cup of water. I added the hot milk mixture to the dry ingredients and whisked it together. I then added the egg and oil then worked in flour until it was a soft dough that was slightly sticky. Not leaving anything on the fingers when touched. Because I used the quick rise yeast I let it rest 10 minutes and then rolled it and spread soft butter, then sprinkled brown sugar and cinnamon. Soooo gooood! Going to add nuts and raisins next time. Was in a rush. Going in my use again recipe book

Made recipe as written. Dough was sticky but came together nicely as it was kneaded...about 1c additional flour was added during kneading to keep it from sticking to surface. Let rise at least an hour. Divided it into 3 pieces. 2 cinnamon, white sugar, brown sugar, butter. 1 pecans, orange zest, brown sugar, white sugar, butter. Added all those toppings by eye.  Go MUCH HEAVIER on brown sugar and butter next time. Consider cutting into 4 pieces/varieties.  Don't crowd pan. I used 2 8x8 squares and 1 9x9. Should have been 4 8x8 squares to allow proper spacing and rising. 9x9 was overcrowded and spilled over during baking. Also consider long, thin roll cut into small pieces and baked in mini muffin tins for parties. I greased pans with solid shortening. Put 1 pan in freezer immediately after 1st rise. (Be sure to add more filling on top of that before baking). Other 2 went in fridge for the night. Rose slightly by morning. Set on counter in the morning for 1 1/2 hour. Could have shortened that if I had a warmer place, possibly. Baked at 350 for approx 20 mins. Used canned cream cheese frosting. (Make own next time) and "halved" recipe for glaze here...using 1 1/2t vanilla and 2c powdered sugar with 3T melted butter for thicker glaze.

These came out delicious! This was my first time baking cinnamon buns - and my 2nd real time baking at all!- and they came out perfectly. As a 19 year old and thus, someone who is a beginner baker, I fully recommend making this recipe for anyone of any skill level. The directions were easy to understand and as long as you follow them exactly, they'll come out great.  Another reviewer recommended using muffin pans; I did this and they came out  extremely fluffy and fancy-looking with an almost pop over like consistency. so I definitely recommend using cupcake/muffin pans instead of a regular pan; just make sure that you spray it well so that It doesn't stick!
 Also when sprinkling the dough with cinnamon sugar the more the better! 
 Overall great recipee. Highly recommend

These are by far our families favorite.  Found the recipe and made prior to my son and his family coming to visit.
This recipe made a lot as  I cut them smaller to ensure they were baked well.  I told my son to take them all home and his reply was no they were moving  in, they loved them that much.   Because he has 3 small girls I made some with M&M's, those were a big hit with them.  I made the Holland Cream recipe for the icing and it was delicious!
This will be my go to recipe from now on!
My son and his family have already made plans for another trip home.  This time my granddaughters will put their own topping on ?? Can't wait!  My oldest granddaughter told her teacher and all her friends she needed to take off school one day so she could help make rolls with grandma??
Thank you for a wonderful & delicious recipe !!!!!!!

I am an experienced baker & was surprised that this needed almost double the flour called for but I had read the reviews and was prepared. I would be concerned for someone new to this getting discouraged.  I also followed the recommendation of someone else to use equal parts brown and white sugar and more cinnamon. We made the dough the night before and set it in the fridge overnight. In the morning we let them rise for about an hour before baking them.  We also used muffin pans to bake them in. I finished  them with fresh cream cheese icing. A huge hit!!!!!

I made these yesterday. They are delicious. Like anything you have to use alot of flour when kneading. I didn't have a yellow cake mix so I used a funfetti cake and they were still the best. I got 31 huge buns out of this recipe.

It was mediocre at best. My husband said they tasted "doughy" and the only saving grace was the cream cheese icing I made to top them with. Will not make again.

I halved the recipe and used the bread machine to make the dough. I usually use the recipe with the vanilla pudding and these were good substitute and I'll keep it as my plan B for the future.

We all liked how fluffy they were, they were simple to make and being able to freeze them made Christmas Morning Breakfast worlds easier since most of it was done ahead of time. We added more cinnamon then called for to give it that strong taste and when it came to the frosting we wanted a huge vanilla flavor so we added 21/2 tsp of vanilla and the icing was awesome!

These were my very first scratch cinnamon rolls and my family LOVED them.  I don't have a KitchenAid so I had to knead by hand (KitchenAid is def on my Christmas list)...other than tired hands, I had no problems.  They were excellent!  I made the full batch, so I had a lot of rolls.  The only change I made was a cream cheese icing.  Between my family and co-workers, they were gone in 2 days.  I recommend to anyone.....they were awesome and I will be making these again.

I made this recipe and brought it to work. They LOVED these!! The recipe was very easy. The only problem I had was that the dough came out very sticky but I just made sure my hands were oiled at all times. Since this recipe makes so much dough I was able to make enough with it to feed my entire work crew. They've been begging me for more ever since.

WOW!!! Were these ever good. The best. I used milk instead of water, but don't think it would have made a difference. Also used brown sugar instead of white. I didn't have to add any more flour. The recipe was perfect.  I did use the cream cheese icing, it's nearly a must for those wonderful cinna-buns. Thanks for sharing.  It's a keeper for sure.

I am only giving this recipe 3 stars because I didnt make it right, I guess! They came out flat and didnt taste good at all. . . Although I still have to practice working with yeast, as it was my first time. So if you don't know what you're doing, ask for a lil help ;) hahaa

These are the best! I made them with Christmas breakfeast. Easier than I thought it would be. I used my Kitchenaid mixer to do the kneading. Using this recipe I made 34 buns. I made the cream cheese frosting that another poster shared and it was great! Thanks for the recipe I will make these again.

Have made these one time so far. Great taste and texture of a professional bakery. I will make again, and try to follow the recipie more closely. Like one of the other reviews I had to add more flour and my icing came out clear.

Deelicious! The dough is pretty hard to work with," but that's because the recipe calls for yellow cake mix. I'm pretty sure it'll be okay with white cake mix as well (another cinnamon rolls recipe uses white cake mix and the dough is actually easier to work with).

I followed this exact recipe to make snacks for our church and everybody loved them! They turned out wonderful. Very moist, and perfectly flaky. A friend was shocked to hear they were homemade and thought they'd come from a bakery! I had four of them myself. This recipe is really easy to follow, and I recommend it for beginner bakers like myself.

I love bread but every time I tried to make one, it turn out hard so I quit trying until I find this recipe. Making bread with combination of flour and cake mix was brilliant!! My bread turn out very soft even after 3 days... By the way, when I prepare the cinnamon-sugar filling, I just realized that I just have enough cinnamon for half the dough so I shape the other half of the dough to dinner roll. I got 12 cinnamon buns and 16 dinner rolls and I like the dinner roll better :-) Thank you for this recipe! Now I can make home made bread which is better than buying from the bakery shop.

I followed the recipe exactly- only used 6 cups of flour- and I freaked out a little bit because the dough was SO RUNNY and STICKY- I couldn't imagine that they'd come out ok.  BUT, they did!!!!  They were delicious!  (Next time I'm going to try a little more flour to see if that makes any difference- but these are good as written)

These were excellent! Surprisingly, not too sweet and super easy to make. I did add a little more flour as some of the other reviews suggested. It is quite pleasant with a hot cup of coffee!

These were fantastic, sweet but not overpowering, soft but not mushy, a lovely bread texture. I did change the recipe to brown sugar and exchanged the all purpose flour for equal amounts of whole wheat flour and bread flour. I forgot to soften the butter so I had to whip it with a fork and just spread it on with my hands the best I could and wasn't able to use all the butter, this caused a lot of the cinnamon sugar mixture to be absorbed into the bread, so next time I will definitly soften the butter. I will make this again, very easy, very good, almost store bought quality. Better than the clone of cinnabon and those others that are putting pudding mix into the bread.

These are really good. I love how the cinnamon and sugar proportions aren't overly sweet and that a great deal of the sweetness comes from the glaze. This makes it easily modifiable for the different sweet tooths in your family. For those who don't like overly sweet, you simply use less or no glaze at all. Personally, I find the recipe calls for too much glaze so I use a little less on my rolls. My stepson doesn't like a lot of sweetness so he doesn't like the glazing at all. My husband though loves the full dosage of the sweet glaze. Any way, its pretty simple to fully glaze some, glaze some less, and glaze some not at all, lol. Very nice recipe.

Are you crazyyyy. this is a killer recipe.
I live in Denmark so I could nok get yellow cake mix. I used a Danish brand muffin mix instead - but they came out perfect.
I used less water at doubled the brownsuger, butter and cinnamon. I also used half of the cinnamonmix on top of the cinnabuns before going in the oven. 
It was perfect.
I will make thise till I die :-)

These were the absolute best!  I did follow some other peoples sugg & used only 2 cups water, 6 cups flour & double the sugar (I used brow.)  It did take take 2 hours each time for the dough to rise properly, but WELL worth the wait!

I absoulutly loved this recipe. I didnt change a single thing and it came out perfect. They were a little bit hard on the outside but perfectly soft on the inside (just the way i like it). I made these for my little girl to take to school (i made about 30 for a class of 20) and she came back with nothing!!! I highly recomend this recipe!

This is really the Best Ever Cinnamon Roll Recipe I have ever tried. I am very excited to have this recipe! My mom has always been an excellent cook and she taught me at a very young age but I have spent most of my life trying to make "good" cinnamon rolls without any success until now! I took them to work and people I hardly see throughout my day made a special trip to my desk to tell me how wonderful they are! Thank you so much for this recipe I can't wait to make them again!

despite some negative reviews, I decided to try the recipe. I took many of the other reviewers suggestions, and the recipe indeed needed more flour and less water. I also doubled the cinnamon filling and replaced the white sugar with brown, which was a very nice alteration. But the buns came out very very dense, and not that sweet like a cinnamon bun. But I whipped up some confectioners sugar and brown sugar with some milk and coated the buns with it then let it sit for awhile. They seemed to improve with time. Good buns after a few alterations, however I wouldnt take my time to do it again.

Beautiful cake!  I modified it just a tad. I used 5 cups of grated carrots, left out the raisins and walnuts.  Baked it in 3-9" round pans, for 30 minutes.  Finely chopped a few walnuts and sprinkled over the cream cheese frosting.  Thanks for the great recipe, it lives up to its name!

I made them and they were delicious. I had to add some extra flour to, and I added some walnuts.
They made them taste excellent. You can use any kind of nut you like.

I'm a "new-bie" baker and these turned out great!  My only complaint is that I'll probably put on a few pounds now that I know how to make them! Thanks re!

They are great! Although I substituted butter for the shortening and added chopped pecans and brown suger.  My family and friends love them.  You can also use this recipe forgreat cinnamon twists.

While these buns are good, they are not nearly as yummy as Cinnabon's. Plus, I found the dough much too soft and hard to work with-and I've been baking for years!  I'll keep looking for ultimate recipe.
