Excellent recipe. Just needed a couple modifications to make it perfect!. Do everything as the recipe calls for, except only use two cups of sharp cheddar(3 1/2 cups is WAY to much). Then, add 2.25oz of dried beef(chopped very fine), green onions(just enough for color and a little zest) and a dab of worcestershire sauce. Make sure that you get the RANCH DRESSING MIX instead of dip mix(this is important). It WILL BE to salty if you mess up and get the dip mix. Mixing it together works alot better when done with your hands(feels yucky, works great). Also, I made sure to chop my pecans fine. Taking it out of the fridge about an hour before serving makes it just right for the crackers. We served this at a party of about 6 people and it was gone before anything else was touched. Hands down, a HUGE hit!

I made this cheese ball for my christmas party and everyone just loved it!I changed a few things.I would advise not using the whole packet of ranch mix,to salty.I used all but a tablespoon,turned out perfect.I also added a cup of monterey jack cheese.make sure you get the finely shredded cheese so it's easier to mix.also,i let the cheeseball sit in the fridge for about 12 hours and got it out about 2 hours before my party started.served it with ritz crackers,WONDERFUL!everyone loved it so much they asked me when i would be making it again!

Delicious and SO easy.  BUT - I think the amt. of Cheddar cheese is a printed incorrectly.  I used one cup of finely shredded cheddar and it was perfect - 16 oz. would be too much.

Excellent!  I added 1T Worchestershire and 1T Tabasco. I received lots of compliments. It is a keeper! Note: I have made this twice.  Once using Hidden Valley DIPS mix and once using Hidden Valley Ranch dressing mix.  There is a huge difference.  Use the Salad Dressing mix and NOT the dips.  The dips mix is very, very salty.

Super tasty and so easy to make!  I just put the cream cheese in my food processor and pulse a few times to soften it.  Then add the dressing mix, pulse again.  Finally, add the Cheddar cheese in batches until it's all incorporated.  This method produces a smooth and fluffy mixture that then can be shaped and coated easily.

Wonderful!!!  I made this for a work Christmas luncheon and it went quickly. My husband asked me to make it again for my family for Christmas and my sister claimed all the leftovers before anyone even arrived. I did make a few changes: I added 1 jar of chipped beef, 1 Tbsp Worcheshire, and reduced the chedder cheese to one 8 oz. package of shredded sharp cheddar.  To form it into a ball I lined a bowl with plastic wrap and spooned the cheese inside.  Then pull up on the edges of the plastic wrap to create a ball. I then rolled it into some of the chipped beef.

I formed a snowman and then frosted it with whipped cream cheese. No nuts. I used celery for arms, a small carrot nose, raisin eyes, a radichio "scarf", raisin buttons etc. It is delicious and a big hit.

this recipe was absolutely fantastic. easy to make and it actually tasted like a cheeseball you would buy. (a lot of cheeseball recipes are good, but you can definitely tell they're mostly cream cheese and homemade; not so with this one.)  i laughed when i went to roll the balls, though. i got three, good-sized balls out of it. can't imagine how gigantic one big one would be!

It's a good cheese ball, but if you use a little less ranch dressing mix it's better.  I added chopped green onions and very finely chopped dried beef.  I didn't use the nuts, but covered the cheese ball with small squares of dried beef.

The best cheese ball, by far. This was a hit at Thanksgiving. I added a little minced garlic and parsley flakes to the mixture and omitted the decorative pecan halves. I only wish it wasn't so hard and you could dip your crackers right into it without them breaking! I think a zap in the microwave before serving would do the trick. Overall, very yummy and addictive.

This is the BOMB!  Be sure to make the modifications mentioned by others:   *cut finely shredded cheddar cheese down to 2 cups  *be sure to use ranch dressing mix not dip mix  *add some chopped scallions for color and 2.25 oz dried beef (buddig) chopped for flavor  *add a splash of worsteshire  Oh, so yummy.

I combined suggestions and added one myself.  I used one container of Imperial Sharp Cheese (cold pressed in a red container with black lid) instead of the shredded cheese.  I used only about  a tablespoon dry Ranch dip mix, a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce, about 5+ drops of Tabasco sauce, and 3-4 cloves of garlic minced.  I made the small balls and rolled them in finely chopped/almost ground pecans.  Everyone loved them.

I've made this numerous years and it is great.  Lots of compliments and very easy.  This year, I wanted to get rid of the MSG that is in the dressing mix, so I substituted Pampered Chef's Garlic Garlic seasoning (which is basically just minced garlic, minced onion, etc.) and a couple of tablespoonfuls of buttermilk.  Came out great.  :)

Very good! i Got raves about it at thanksgiving! I only used 1 1/2 cups mild chedder cheese and 1/2 cup of very finely chopped ham. i forgot to add green onions like someone suggested but i can't see why it's really needed once you add the ranch. i did use almost all the ranch i left out about a table spoon because as i poured it in it seemed like more than enough. Covered it in choppped peacans (which i hate) for decorative purpose. but you couldn't even taste the peacans at all! To me it just added a little texture and very pretty coating. I will make this at every party!  and even for a midnight snack sometimes.

Very good!  I made as written, except rolled into individual balls.  Worked our perfect to put the balls into a ring on the outside of a serving plate and fill the middle with Wheat Thins.

As written is very good, but I cheated & did as a few others have done & I added 1 pkg Carl Buddig Beef, scallions, & a "dab" of Worcestershire sauce. It gets RAVE reviews every time I make it. Never fails someone is asking me for the recipe.  Thanks Ellen for a great base recipe!!!

I add 1 small jar of pimentos and 1 package of the pre-cooked, "recipe ready" bacon pieces (usually found in the salad dressing aisle) and call it a BLT Ranch Cheese Ball (check out my recipe, also on allrecipes.com). I also don't use the pecans, but instead use the extra shredded cheese to cover the outside of the ball. Plus, since I'm a Packer fan, I sprinkle a little parsley on the outside, so it's "green and gold" for gameday! : )

This was the best recipe for a cheese ball i have ever made.  I did make some minor changes however.  2 cups of cheddar cheese is plenty and i didn't need the entire package of dressing mix.  As odd as it sounds, i used shelled sunflower seeds instead of the pecans.  It turned out wonderfully.

DELICIOUS!!  I used mixed chopped nuts instead of pecans to roll it in after it was formed.  Soooo good!  I had no left-overs after party so HAD to make a small one the next day all for me!  ;-)  It was great with garlic butter crackers!

Definitely a very simple way to make a good tasting cheese ball. Nothing to brag about to the world, but comes in handy if you need something simple to take to parties. The pecans give it that "classic" look and crunch and the 2 simple cheeses are better together than expected.  I will say the quantities for this are huge. I realize the quantities are easy to measure, but you will make multiple cheese balls out of these quantities. So be prepared before you make it - you'll either need to be at a huge party, or be desiring to keep some at home for a few weeks.  Go from about 1/3 of the recipe if you want just a normal size cheese ball.

This would probably be okay, but the Hidden Valley ranch dressing mix I bought (and I DID make sure it said dressing and not dip!) was in a new looking packet...I think they have now upped the salt in this.  The packet I bought weighed only .4 oz, but that was the only one I saw that said dressing mix. I love salt, but this is so salty...I am so disappointed. I added extra cream cheese in hopes it would take away some of the saltiness, but it didn't. I made these for Christmas gifts, but now I have to throw them out...big waste of money and time for me.

Very good recipe! I added a few dashes of worcestershire sauce very a smokier flavor. Also chopped pecans and sprinkled parsley over the nuts before rolling. Very pretty and yummy! Thanks for this quick and easy recipe!

I made and served at my sister's wedding reception. It was an appetizer reception I catered. I doubled the recipe and made two large cheese balls the pecans and two large cheese logs I rolled in pecans. I toasted the pecans which gave them an added sweetness and crunch. I also only used about 1/2 - 3/4 oz Ranch dressing mix and this was plenty, any more and it would be too salty and over-power the other flavors. I, too, only added 2 1/2 cups sharp cheddar cheese. More and the cheddar would have over-powered the other flavors, probably because I did use sharp cheddar. Both the plain and the pecan were equally enjoyed by the wedding guests.

This was a huge hit at thanksgiving. we had a small group, so I cut the recipe in half and it made one nice sized ball. I only used about 1 1/2 cups extra sharp cheddar shredded really small. I also added some diced green onions and worchestershire, and I made it 2 days ahead of time. It was perfect and I will surely be making it for christmas as well.

I made this recently for a family picnic. I'm giving it 5 stars, but only because I took the advice of a few others and made one addition. You absolutely MUST add a 4 and 1/2 ounce jar of dried beef, finely chopped! It just adds that "certain something" to the cheese ball that makes everyone say, "Hmmm, what IS that?" It got rave reviews at the picnic and did not last very long! Several people asked me for the recipe. This one goes in my archives!

This was my first cheese ball and I looked like a pro! I listened to other reviews and added minced garlic, parsley and some worchester. A few recommendations... it mixes best if you use your hands! Don't be afraid to get messy- it washes off! Also, if you plan to serve it with crackers, take it out of the fridge AT LEAST 2-3 hours before serving to soften.

This is a great cheeseball recipe! I love the simplicity of it- and everyone really loves it. I like to use the finely shredded cheddar cheese- it works great. I also use sliced almonds instead of pecans, and it is very good. If you are making this for a smaller crowd- halve the recipe- because this makes 2 average sized (grocery store sized) cheese balls.

to MrsHavens1984....sorry i didn't see your dissapointment  of this cheesse ball sooner but try my version & you'll be happy...think the original HV ranch is to salty so I stick with the buttermilk blend..our Giant Eagle doesn't carry it so I stock up when I go to Drug Mart....don't need to add anything but all 3 ingred......I've been making it for several people & end up freezing some for emergency situations....in fact I've done some for dips by adding some beer to it so you can make it into a dip..WoW!..naturally you can always add exra stuff (like bacon,etc, but no need when 3 simple ingred work....go with the flo

I've been making this for years and it is always a hit.  I add a little paparika and garlic powder to the mixture.  Sometimes I add a little cajun seasoning to give it a kick.  I usually make it into a cheese log so it fits easily on a cracker.

Excellent! I didn't use as many pecans as the recipe requires (about half the amt) but in their place, I did add about 1/4 cup minced celery. Very good...with any kind of cracker. Will make this for many events to come. Thanks Ellen!

This is delicious exactly as written.  I wouldn't cut back on the cheddar as others have suggested - it is after all a "cheese" ball.   Also yummy with a couple cans of drained crab meat mixed in.

This is very easy to make and tastes great.  I used 2 cups of mild shredded cheddar cheese and it turned out fine.  3 and a half cups of cheese would have been too much and I used mild because I didn't have sharp cheddar.  For the Ranch dressing use salad dressing mix.  I used a food processor to finely chop the pecans.  Put that in a plate to the side.  Then I mixed the cream cheese, cheddar cheese and dressing mix in the food processor.  I formed the mixture into a ball with my hands and then rolled the ball in the finely chopped pecans.  Excellent and easy!

I made this to take to the first football game of the season. I also only used 2 cups finely shredded cheddar and that was plenty. I made it the night before so the flavors could meld and rolled it in Real Bacon Bits because we have nut allergies in the family. This recipe does make a LOT! I thought it would be too much, but not for this family! I served it with 2 boxes of Wheat Thins and it was nearly gone before halftime. :)

This cheese ball was a huge hit at a family gathering.  I could not believe how good it was. I did not use as much of the ranch dressing packet as required because I figured it might be too salty- and it was perfect. The second time I made this I did add some
worcestershire sauce and it was a good extra!!

I made this for Christmas and it gave me two good sized balls.  I added less of the ranch seasoning but substituted in a couple cloves of finely minced garlic, a dash of worchester and hot sauce.  I think these additions took it beyond the bland that it would have been.  It was even better after the first day. Great recipe!

I've made a similar recipe to this one, but a smaller version. It requires 1 package of cream cheese, 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese and 1 package of dry Ranch dressing. It is always a hit at parties. Very addictive. You can also mold the cheeseball in various shapes. For our Super Bowl party, I shaped it into the form of a football and carved the laces into the cheeseball with a knife. Very easy to create. 7 minutes tops.

GREAT RECIPE!!! Followed directions, and loved it- then added chopped parsley, minced garlic, and green onion for a little extra. I left out the nuts since I didn't have them. I coated the outside in parsley and shredded chedder for looks- went over GREAT!

Just made this for a bridal shower for a friend.  Everyone loved them.  Made "individual" balls instead of one large ball.  Rave reviews!  Be sure to finely grind the pecans to get the best coating.  If making "individual" balls, it's best to roll the balls in your hand with the pecans.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I cut down on the dressing and added I tbsp of Worcestershire. I also creamed everything in the food processor for a nice texture and then mixed in some crushed pecans. It yielded 2 large balls that were devoured by my guests.

I've made this several times and it's always a hit at parties.  It looks so fancy - like you spent a long time on it - but it takes about 5 minutes to make.  I only use 2 cups of shredded, sharp cheese.  The last time I tried it I crumbled 3 slices of bacon into it and added a dash or two of hot sauce - it was great!  You can get very creative with this. Great recipe!

This cheese ball is awesome.  I don't know why I've never thought to make one before, but it was the hit of my daughter's first birthday party (as far as the food table goes).  Everyone wanted to take some home.  I made almost double the recipe and used LOTS of sharp Cheddar, exchanging the pecans for sliced almonds (due to allergies).  I had two cheese balls, and my husband liked it so much he keeps snacking on it every chance he gets.  Because there is nothing "crazy" in the recipe even my one year old can eat it without worry.  Definitely a keeper!

This was pretty easy to make...a little hard to mix, but I kept at it and it came together well.  Also, I bought ranch dip mix (instead of dressing mix) by mistake and THEN read one of the reviews that said the dip mix was too salty...so, I used only half of the packet and added 1 tablespoon of worchester - it was great! I'll try it next time with a full packet of the dressing mix and compare!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this for a Christmas party and formed 3 balls into a snowman.  I made it the day before and arranged the balls minutes before the party.  It was good, not great - the hardest part was to get people to "break" the snowman.  I will probably make again due to the ease of the recipe......

This recipe was quite good. I thought the taste improved the second day. I thought it had a salty taste and would decrease the amount of ranch dressing somewhat.

I thought I would try the recipe for my holiday party since it got 5 stars on the reviews... however, I didn't quite see why... it wasn't bad... it was just average at best... my guests agreed with me.  I would not make this recipe again.

I've never made a cheese ball before, and this turned out great! Everyone loved it. I used about 2/3 of the ranch dressing mix so the flavor wasn't too overpowering. It was a great party dish!

This is a great recipe! Always getting requests to bring this to any type of get togethers. I use half of the ranch otherwise the ranch overpowers the cheese. It makes 2 good size balls or 1 huge ball. Breaking it into two you can change it up with 1 rolled with the pecans and one with bacon bits etc. very versatile.

This was okay....I used about half the cream cheese, half the cheese and less than half of the ranch mix. However, I got the ranch dip mix, and according to the reviews, it's better to use just ranch mix. So I'll do that next time, and maybe add some green onions. Overall a very easy dish to make, but not super amazing either.

I have been making this recipe for year and years now. Everyone raves about it and asks for the recipe. For easier blending, using a stand up mixer with the flat blade, or use food handling gloves for hand mixing. If using packaged cheese I use Kraft's Meixican blend, if using freshly shredded cheese, I use co-jack. To roll in the pecans easily, I spread the chooped pecans on a sheet of saran wrap. Then simply roll the log (or ball) onto the pecans, wrap up in the saran wrap and pop into the fridge! This is best with Ritz crackers or those little chicken biscuit crackers by Nabisco.

I made this, minus the pecans, for my friend's bonfire(more like a fire-pit) party, basically a group of high school seniors, anyway, everyone loved it! It was really easy to make, and it tastes great on everything...I put the leftovers on my bagel this morning...I'm definitely going to make it for the next one.

I made this cheese ball for a Christmas party last year, and it disappeared so quickly - everyone loved it! I served this with crackers, but next time I might add a few more choices to the plate (pretzels, apples, toasted bread, etc.).

This cheese ball went over well and was complimented by many at the party I brought it to. I did add a few extra things: 2 chopped green onions, about 3 oz of chopped beef jerky and a splash of Worcestershire and I reduced the amount of cheddar to 2 cups. It was great!

Sounds very good--will try soon. The people who added chipped beef changed it too much. It changes it to something completely different.

I made this as an appetizer for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it.  Super easy to make, all I did was added scallions as per other people's suggestions.  Turned out great, and was much larger than I expected. Still great recipe, will definitely make it again.

I made a variation of this. Instead of one big ball, I made small, bite size cheese balls. I put the chopped pecans on a plate, sprinkled some breadcrumbs on top, and tossed them together. (But don't use too much of the breadcrumbs. There should be more pecans to breadcrumbs or else the pecans won't stick to the cheeseball.) I then rolled each small cheeseball in the pecan and breadcrumb mix until it covered it entirely. I followed the recipe's directions in terms of ingredients and instructions.

I made these for Christmas neighbor gifts this year, and they were a hit! Many people asked me for the recipe. THe changes I made: Like most people suggested, I reduced to 1 cup cheese. I also made three cheese balls per packet of ranch dressing mix. (The original recipe is too strong) Instead of pecans, I rolled in walnuts.

Delicious! I used lower fat Neufachtel type cream cheese and it still turned out great. According to the box, it has 1/2 the fat of regular cream cheese and tastes the same. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.

This recipe is fabulous!  I was worried about the comments about the cheese ball being too salty, but I still went ahead and used the full package of ranch.  I let it sit over night, and it turned out great.  I got tons of compliments and it disappeared quickly!

I tried this recipe and while it tasted pretty good, and entire package of dressing mix is WAY too much.  Also, there was no mention of bringing ingredients to room temp before mixing...this would have saved me so much time and strain on my mixer.  I had to let it rest several times and it took me no less than an hour to prepare because everything was rock hard.  Also, use the finely shredded cheese...mine still had big pieces of cheese throughout....it did not mesh with the cream cheese at all.  Since it didn't bind well, it was crumbly and not smooth at all.

This is good as it is and great as a base. I made two of them... one w/ranch dressing package and one w/italian. If you really want to "get this ball rolling", try adding veggies, like finely chopped garlic & onion, bell peppers (green & red for Christmas)and try out a variety of shredded cheeses & meats. Also, I had/used mixed nuts, originally, and they worked fine. I gave this recipe a 4 instead of 5 stars for lack of creativity alone :(

We make a cheeseball that is very similar to this one.  Difference is - less cheddar and instead of rolling it in pecans we roll it in "Jane's Krazy Mixed-Up Pepper".  May sound strange but trust me...it's good and sure to get compliments.

Don't let the simple list of ingredients fool you.  This is a fantastic cheese ball!  It is the only recipe I use now.  Everyone raves when I make it.  It makes a great Thanksgiving day appetizer.  Thanks for such a simple, but tasty recipe, Ellen!  It's a winner!

This went over really well.  It made several, so I took one to a neighbor as a thank-you.  I added a little bacon and green onions to mine.

I like to place my pecans in a sandwich bag or between 2 sheets of wax paper and mash them into small pieces.  Then roll the cheese ball in the pecans for a pretty presentation.

This cheese ball has wonderful flavor.  I did, however, make the error of buying ranch "dip" mix, and it was a bit salty as a result.  Was a big hit at the thanksgiving party nonetheless.  Will buy the correct mix next time.  Thanks for the recipe!!

I was disappointed.  My family didn't care for that much ranch flavor.  I might try again with 1/2 a package instead.  This does make a lot, unfortunately, the second ball never got eaten.

I followed this recipe exact. I made a small one to try at home before making one to take to a potluck at work. It was very good. I had it with wheat thins. I'm sure the addition's that were suggested by other reviewers make it even better but this is good as it is. There are times when all you need is a basic recipe and then there are occasions where you need to step it up. This works! Thanks for the post.

This was very easy but way too salty for us.  Would recommend on cutting down on the dressing mix or either adding more cream cheese.

I make this cheese ball every year for a Super Bowl parth that I cater.  It always is a big hit.  I shape the mixture into the shape of a football, coat the outside with crushed pecans and use whole nuts for the "laces".

I let everything sit out on the counter for 4 hours to soften before mixing together and let it chill overnight. I didn't change a thing and it was very yummy. My husband's friend didn't know you could make a cheeseball, he just thought they came from a store!

Very yummy!  We don't like nuts, so I rolled the ball in extra shredded cheddar cheese.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  Thank you.  I've made this twice so far and everyone loves it!  :)  PS. It does not keep well through the next day.  It is definitely best fresh!

I made this recipe with no changes or additions except that I used Smokehouse Almonds instead of pecans -- and it was fantastic!  I was careful to use the ranch dressing mix instead of ranch dip mix.  It was not too salty for us -- I made one big cheese ball and served it at a poker party and we ate the entire thing!  I will definitely be making this again.  My daughter, who is a cheese ball fanatic, loved it.

It was okay.  I don't know if I did anything wrong, but the texture of the cheese was too tough...it wasn't very spreadble and the crackers tended to break as I tried to spread the mixture on them.  I made half the recipe for a bridal shower and it made a good sized gheese log.  I rolled it in ranch flavored sliced almonds and that was a great touch.

It was easy to make, but was on the salty side, especially when I spread it on Ritz crackers. Might need to reduce the ranch mix a bit or use plain crackers for this reason.

I find that this is way too much Cheddar cheese, and I often omit the pecans.  But I just adore this cheese ball!  It is always a hit at parties, and there's usually leftovers that are a great snack later on!

I got lots of compliments on this cheese ball over the holidays! I took one person's suggestion and added some chopped chipped beef, cut the cheese down to 2 cups and I ended up using an extra package of cream cheese to mellow out the salty flavor. I made one small cheese ball and rolled it in a walnut/parsley mixture and then patted the remaining cheeseball mixture around the outside to form a kind of cheeseball within a cheeseball. I then rolled that in walnuts and parsley as well. Thanks for a great recipe!

Good, but I would agree to use only half a pack of the ranch dressing. Taste is great, but do need to cut back on the dressing mix due to saltiness.

this was good. Good flavor, somewhat odd texture.  Out of the fridge, it was too hard.  It did soften or so within an hour and was easier to eat.  Overall, good.

This was a great recipe, but I did change it a bit. I added a whole jar of dried beef and 1 Tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce and some chopped green onions. Everyone loved it and it's become a must have for the Holiday's. Thanks

I did not like this recipe much. It is VERY salty. I like a semi-smooth cheese ball and no matter how long I mixed it stayed pretty chunky. Who knows...

I accidentally bought a package of ranch dip instead of ranch dressing.  I don't know if this made a difference, but my cheese ball was extremely salty.  I tried adding another 1/2 cup of cheddar cheese to cut some of the salt taste, but that didn't work.  I just couldn't serve it.

I made this cheese ball for a baby shower, and it was a hit. This was my very first time ever making a cheese ball and it came out perfect. I like the fact that it was a simple recipe and it also taste great. I will be making this cheese ball again.

Nice and simple.. next time, I think I'll use a bit less dressing mix because it was just a little bit on the salty side. But definitely tasty!

This recipe makes one large ball or 2 average balls.  This has been a hit at parties, holidays and hockey game night.  I do reccommend using half of the rach dressing.  A whole package makes it salty. Thanks for a great recipe.

This is a recipe I made last year for a Thanksgiving party -- I'm invited back to the party this year on the condition that I bring this cheese ball!  I have to say, though, that the reviewer who suggested adding Worcestershire sauce and pepper sauce (Tabasco) was right on.  It really gives it an extra-tasty kick.  And Wheat Thins go perfectly with the end result :-)

I have been told on many occasions that I make a MEAN cheese ball and have 2 basic recipes that I will never get rid of.  But, I was bored and wanted to try something new.  I tried this one and it was raved about for days after.  I've had to share the recipe and this website with everyone who was at the party.  Thanks for a new taste sensation!

Easy recipe, but I was surprised at how much shredded cheese required - I added approximately 4 ounces and it turned out great - 16 ounces was WAY too much!  Got rave reviews at our work potluck.

This was super easy and really good! I thought the entire packet of ranch dressing mix would make it taste overpowering... It didn't, and was great! But it is VERY important to get the "dressing" mix and NOT the "dip" mix! Otherwise, it would be waaaay too salty- I have made that mistake before. I had to omit coating it with pecans, due to someone having an allergy, so I chopped half the amount called for and only added it mixed in to one side. (I made cute flags to label each side.) For a little kick, I added in some diced jalapenos. This was loved and will be a keeper in regular rotation for parties & appetizers!

Very good and very easy to make! I did it for thansgiving and got lots of compliments on how good they were.  I didnt mix in the nuts, but did put a pecan half on the back like turkey feathers, and a small little piece of a nut on the front to make a beak.  super cute and really easy!

I agree, use only half the ranch packet. Very salty. I also only used 2 cups of sharp cheese. Overall, pretty good for a homemade cheese ball. I will make again but with slight modifications. Thanks :)

I rolled it in chopped walnuts & parsley.  Pretty & yummy.  To those who said it tasted like an MSG Ball: Come on, it's a cheeseball.  People who eat cheeseballs usually aren't bothered by synthetic-tasting things.  I sort of agree with the MSG comment but I had to admit, I couldn't stop eating it.  Then I made another cheeseball with more "pure" ingredients-- and found myself craving the Ranchball.  So this is the one in my recipe file, not the pure one!

Everyone said they loved this dip, but it seemed too hard for me.  You had to chip it off to put it on the crackers.  Maybe I mixed it too much or something--it tasted pretty good, though.

I made this for my halloween party!  Everyone and I mean everyone loved it, twist I made a little more than the recipe called for and put it in my brain mold.  It came out perfect!  I skipped the nuts...just in case somebody was allergic.  :)  But fabulous and a hit at any party!

I had to edit my review from a few years ago when I first made it, and add a photo... I found the recipe again and made it into a snowman (pictured)! Just as I did before, I added NOTHING to this recipe, went by it exactly and had people from work say "I don't even like cheeseballs but I love that one! Send me the recipe!" Then they were amazed what little was in it but how GOOD it was! Making another snowman for Christmas with the family ;) Thanks again for a GREAT and SIMPLE recipe!

Wonderful addition to any appetizer buffet. Much tastier than store bought cheeseballs and less expensive too!  I made the recipe as is w/ one addition. I mixed in about a 1/3 cup of bacon bits for that extra something. Delicious!

I made this cheese ball for a Christmas party at my office.  Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe.  I used sliced almonds in place of chopped pecans.  Definitely will make this again!  :-)

This was my first time ever making a cheese ball. It was so extremely easy, i just used a pastry cutter to mix it all together. I took it to thanksgiving dinner and was told I was to bring another for Christmas. It was very tasty. Just added some wheat thins on the side. Everyone at my family party ate it up.

Very easy recipe.  It was a hit at our Christmas Eve party.  The only thing that was kind of confusing was that the shopping list called for shredded cheese but the recipe called for grated.  In case anyone else is confused, the shredded worked fine.

Only thing I did differently was I didn't put the whole pecans on it and I used 2 cups of the cheddar cheese. Everyone loved it. I think it would have been ok with the extra cheese, but I figured why open the extra bag if one is enough. I didn't use the finely shredded cheese and mine came out fine. Texture might have been softer if I had, but it tasted fine.

This has become a holiday favorite.  This was the first cheese ball that many of us had ever had and it was an immediate hit.  My husband initially turned his nose up at it, but was the first to dig into the leftovers and complained when it was gone, and he is extremely picky.  I make two balls out of this recipe and usually immediately freeze one of them.  It freezes wonderfully, but as it almost always gets pulled out and eaten within 2 months (we LOVE it)  i can't vouch for its longetivity.  Thanks for a great recipe.  I usually add a dash of worchestershire sauce and a little garlic.

Did exactly as the recipe called for... made two good size balls. I'd cut down on the cheese next time as it did appear to be a bit much. Excellent and delicious!

I ended up adding an addition package of cream cheese and we liked this better.  I would suggest to have an extra cream cheese on hand just incase one thinks there is just too much cheddar and too much garlic taste.  I love garlic but it was a little overpowering for me.

This was my first time making a cheese ball and it received rave reviews!  I used freshly shredded sharp cheddar and probably used more like 4 cups and it was perfect!  My husband who hates anything with cream cheese even ate it and liked it!  I don't even think he knew it had cream cheese in it.  I will be making this again for sure!

I made this the night before my wedding (for the next day) and we ate it before the wedding.  I had to make a second one for the actual ceremony.  I added one green pepper and 6 green onions finely chopped-it was a hit! People keep  asking me for the recipe!

I like the taste. I used monteray jack mixed with mild cheddar. I loved the snow man idea and I used dried cranberries for the eyes and mouth to make a more "chrismasy" appearance.

I have made this several times. I half the recipe, as the full recipe makes quite a lot.  I roll it into a log, instead of a ball and then roll in chopped walnuts.  Yum! Yum!  Have had many compliments and requests for the recipe.

So easy!  I made this for our midday snacking on Thanksgiving day and everyone loved it!  I added monterey jack cheese, too, and as other's suggested, I made sure to finely shred the cheeses.  I used medium cheddar instead of sharp and just rolled it in simple nut topping.  Very quick and easy and yummy!

This is good, I liked the Cheddar.  But I really prefer my cream cheese, chopped deli beef, green onions, rolled in Bacon pieces more.
This was a nice change.

You were right, this is wonderful!! My family agreed this is much better than any cheese balls you can buy at the store. This went quickly at my Christmas party. I used the finely shredded cheddar (vs. the regular shredded)and found it to be a nice consistency. Thanks for sharing this!!

I have now used this recipe 3 times!  First at Thanksgiving, then Christmas, now New Years.  I have received compliments every time.  I love cheese ball and have been looking for a simple recipe that didn't cost a fortune to make.  This is exactly what I was looking for! Thanks!

I don't like cheese, but I halved this recipe for my husband's office party. He came back with an empty platter and said everyone loved it. This is a very quick & easy recipe. I used 1/3 less fat block of cream cheese and only about 2/3 cup of chopped pecans -- it didn't need the entire cup.

I followed the recommendation of others and did not use the full package of ranch dip. I added bacon pieces, and rolled the cheese ball in crushed crackers, because my daughter has a nut allergy.

Wanting a smaller appetizer, I used 1 block of cream cheese and one and a half cups of cheddar cheese.  I added some finely sliced scallions and a bit of Worcestershire too.  I loved it, the party guests raved about it, and there was little left, so I guess it deserves a 5 star rating!!  I will definitely make this again.

This is a good recipe. I read one review where they said use the ranch dressing mix and not the dip mix. I bought the dip mix by accident but used it. It was a little salty. So I toned it down by adding ground up walnuts. About a 1/2 cup, plus I only used 2 1/2 cups cheddar.  I also added some onion powder. It was very good also.

Was looking for an easier cheese ball recipe that required less time and less cost. Prepared exactly as recipe states. I made sure to get dressing and seasoning mix in 1 oz envelope, not the dip, as one reviewer urges. This was too firm  even at room temp and so salty as to be inedible. I tried "fixing" it to no avail. Sorry...sometimes the old fashioned way is best. I learned my lesson and will stick to my go-to recipe. (may try with half pkg of dressing mix...)

I just used 2 cups of cheese and be sure to use ranch dressing mix, not ranch dip mix. Really great!

I followed the recipe exactly! I mean why not, this is the best cheese ball that I've ever eaten. I love the extra cheese as my husband and I are lovers of cheese. I've made this several times and everyone loved it. The next time I'm going to try the additions

Super easy to make and soo good. On advice from a friend I added finely chopped jalapeño and red pepper. The addition added a crunch and better flavor. Add as much jalapeño and pepper as you like.

This was a quick and easy cheese ball that was pretty good but not WOW.  I added green onions and a dash of Worcestershire.  I don't think I would have liked it without the green onions b/c it would have been way too bland.  You do not need 3.5 cups of cheddar.  I used about 2 but will do 2.5 next time.  I'm pretty sure I didn't use 2 cups of pecans b/c I didn't measure that part just chopped and rolled till they were covered.

Awesome recipe.  Simple and elegant.  I made it for office potluck. Folks raved about this dish. It was literally gone by the end of the work day. It was perfect appetizer for our Thanksgiving office potluck. Also added 3 packages  of the Philadelphia cream cheese, with 2 cups of extra sharp cheddar cheese, cut back on ranch dressing, added green onions, chives, and tbsp of worcestershire sauce. It came out perfect dish loved by everyone. Thanks for recipe, hints, and substitutions everyone.

Per another reviewer only use 3/4 of the ranch dressing or it's too salty  :) another reviewer suggested the hidden valley dressing mix vs dip, less salty and the recipe calls for dressing, not dip. Amount of cheese may be too much.

I've made this numerous times, and it's great. My only complaint about the recipe is that there is too much cheddar. If you wind up using 3.5 cups, a lot will go to waste. 2 cups is plenty.

I wasted a lot of cheese making this. It was so bad, I thought I may have messed up the recipe. I double checked, and I did everything right. I made sure to use dressing mix instead of dip mix.
It tasted way too garlicky- just not a good flavor at all.

I didn't like having so much cheddar cheese in this.  I couldn't really taste the cream cheese much because of this.  Next time,  I'll cut back on the cheddar by about 1 cup.  I also added more green onion and some chopped ham.  My party group really liked this even though I thought it could be better.

The taste of this cheese ball is insane! So good! I had trouble handling it (for shaping into a ball) so when I make it, I use a shallow dish and then sprinkle and press the nuts on after smoothing the cheese out. It makes for easier dipping/spreading anyway! Big hit at several family gatherings. Yum!

This was pretty good.  Made as written I thought it was a little too plain. I took other's suggestions and added Worcestershire Sauce and Cayenne pepper sauce. My husband thought that the additions made a big improvement.

Very good and incredibly easy.  I made 1/2 the recipe for a party.  There were 3 other cheese balls at the party so we ended up with leftovers which we discovered tasted yummy when toasted on a slice of bread!  Will definitely make again.

AWESOME!! I never have made a cheese ball in my life and these turned out excellent!  I did goof,however!  I added the chopped pecans to the actual cheese mixture*LOL* Instead of rolling the ball in the chopped pecans, I took the other reviewer's suggestion of rolling it in parsley and it turned out just fine! It looked very pretty,too!  This recipe makes two good size cheese balls and one of them was "abducted" at my party last night by my next door neighbor! VERY GOOD! thank you!!

I love a good cheese ball and was a little wary of the lack of ingredients in this one. Well was I surprised when just about everyone asked for the recipe and said it was the best they have ever had! Thanks for sharing!

Very easy & good.  If bringing to potluck/party, might want to roll in parsley in place of walnuts/pecans (in case of nut allergies).

This was my first attempt at making a cheese ball and it turned out great!  I make two cheese balls and took them to holiday parties.  Everyone loved them!

I was looking for a cheese ball recipe for Christmas last year. I decided to try this one. It was a smashing hit and I had to make another for New Year's Eve. This year, my family is asking me to make this again so it will definitely become a part of our holidays!!

I have never made a cheeseball before, and I took this to a Christmas party--it was gone very quickly. Everyone asked for the recipe and couldn't believe how simple it was. Definetly a ranch-lover's favorite!
