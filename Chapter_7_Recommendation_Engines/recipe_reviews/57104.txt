I made this recipe both with and without the potatoes. Using potatoes stretches the meat a substantial amount without affecting taste - as I don't really care about fat content. Mostly I use the sausage as a breakfast sausage in place of traditional "Jimmy Dean" style sage-dominated sausage. Also with a slice of cheese - like a hamburger. I find the inclusion of veal makes the product authentic. Potatoes have been used in locally produced brats for years, in and around Sheboygan.

This is a great basis for creating your own brats/patties seeing as though no one seems to want to give up their seasoning however sell it. I added fresh green onion and minced garlic after the dry seasoning had set with the meat (deviding the pepper between black and white pepper is also a nice kick). I like the veal idea however ask your butcher for the ribeye end of a porkloin which will give you more tender meat plus the fat content that you are looking for. I rolled the meat out on wax paper and use a cup to press out even patties...yet to have a complaint! great spring/summer recipe!!
