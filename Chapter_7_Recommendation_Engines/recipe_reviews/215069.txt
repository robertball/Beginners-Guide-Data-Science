Soooooo yummy.  The only changes I made was substituting apple cider vinegar for red wine vinegar, canola oil for olive oil - less about 1 tablespoon, adding a tablespoon of toasted sesame oil, and adding about 1 tablespoon of chopped chives.  Adding nutritional yeast will thicken it if you find it too thin, but I did not find that necessary.  I thought the consistency was perfect the way it is.  Very much like Goddess dressing.

fantastic!  I love how it is creamy without using dairy.  I added a bit of lemon zest... really just for the scent (on my hands and in the dressing!) thanks

I surprised by all of the positive reviews.  For me the tahini and ginger overwhelmed all of the other flavors.  I tried to save it by increasing the other ingredients, but it was chalky nonetheless.  I will not try it again.

Wow! This recipe actually deserves five stars!  Absolutely delicious.  I dipped veggies in this and spread it on my veggie and bean burgers.  It taste AMAZING on falafels.  It kind of tastes like a thick hummus sauce.  I'm surprised that only a few people have reviewed this one!

This is excellent.  I substituted dried ginger & garlic powder and used regular soy sauce instead of tamari, and it was still very good.  I am sure it is even better as written.  Makes a great dressing for pita sandwiches or dip for pretzels, pita chips, veggies, etc.

Amazing! I have been making tahini dressing since i was a kid and tried this with some of what i do in mine and it was a perfect harmony. I omitted the olive oil and used 1/4 c sesame oil instead. Then i added chopped green onion and a small handful of parsley. I used just a tad more lemon juice and garlic and cut back on the water by half, i like mine a little thicker. Thank you thank you!

Very tasty!!  I scaled the recipe down to half size as I didn't need quite so much.  Still used 2 cloves of garlic and not quite as much olive oil as called for.  I really enjoyed this - hubby not so much, but it's more a taste preference thing, not the fault of the dressing!

I have made this several times and has become one of my favorite dressings. My kids love it to dip their veggies in.  It can be a bit on the salty side so, I use a little bit less tamari but, other than that, it's great.

Yum! Wow. I'm sitting here feeding this deliciousness to my face, as I type! I will admit, I was skeptical after too many homemade dressing failures. I followed one persons suggestion to reduce the water a bit, otherwise I followed the recipe exact and I will be making it again, for sure! It even smells wonderful!

This was fine.  Not bad but not worth making again.  I'm quite fond of tahini but I thought it overwhelmed all the other ingredients.  I had just opened a brand new bottle of tahini so it wasn't because it was stale.  I'll try a sesame-ginger dressing next time.

I made this with ground ginger instead of fresh just to save a bit of time; otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. I did not use any added salt because of the tamari.

I used it over a salad of romaine lettuce, garbanzo beans, diced cucumbers, feta cheese, tomato, and some pepperoncini peppers. Really wished I had had some Greek olives. 

The dressing was just the type I wanted for this salad. I will definitely keep this recipe, but I will add less water next time (maybe half the amount) and use a little more tahini. It is thin as others wrote, but it worked for my purposes.

Very mild. I added lots of ginger (at least 1.5 inch of root), an extra tbs of lemon juice and about 2 tbs of sesame oil (dark one). I used rice vinegar. I suggest to omit the water instead of adding all that stuff...

Let me just say-"oh yea, baby!" Perfection. Tamari is that secret ingredient that people will love but not be able to put their finger on.

Exactly what I was searching for, a healthy salad dressing with ingredients I had on hand. This dressing was absolutely delicious! I made it just as the recipe stated and I wouldn't change a thing. I will be using this recipe often.

I used mirin ( rice wine vinager) instead. It has a mellow flavour and not so harsh. Turned out excellent. Even the kids loved it.   Used it on a wrap with roasted chickpeas. Delicious.

I began making my own salad dressing about three years ago, and this is an outstanding addition to my repertoire.  I made it to go with a falafel salad and it was amazing.  I followed the directions as given, with the exception of substituting cider dressing for the red wine as many recommended, and my family loved it.

Good start as is, but all I tasted was vinegar and soy.  So, I added a teaspoon of orange zest, a couple of tablespoons of Splenda brown sugar and a dash or two of cayenne.  Much better!

Excellent! I used kikkoman lite soy sauce and ground ginger. Made half the recipe. I put it on our Mediterranean chicken sandwich. Hubby and I loved it! We have had to eliminate dairy and egg from our diet so I was thrilled to find this tasty addition for our menu.

I didn't  measure the ginger and probably did not put enough as I like the zing a lot ginger gives it.  Also used what I had-regular soy.  Next time will try tamarin and more ginger. Still excellent! A nice change from bottled dressings with all that sugar, "guar gum", etc.

Subbed avocado oil for the olive oil.  It's nice to have a flavorful and creamy non-dairy dressing.  Pairing with Greek chicken and tabbouleh.

Amazing. I subbed ACV for red wine vinegar and coconut aminos for soy sauce. I used fresh squeezed lemon juice.

I will definitely make it again! No modification, except no blender. Simply whisked it with a spoon, and mashed the tahini lumps!

This was great! I did not find any of the flavours overpowering. It is simple and fresh. I didn't have tamari or soy sauce, so I used ponzu sauce. I added a little bit more water to put on salad.

Pretty good, but a bit thick for me.  Lightened with fruit juice to add a bit of sweetness and mint.  It needed mint.

I added a tablespoon of nutritional yeast because I thought the dressing needed more body - it was a too wet.  I also added a bit of honey.  Otherwise, a very good recipe!

It's delicious. I made a few substitutions for what I had at home: red wine vinegar-> apple cider vinegar, tamari-> liquid Aminos, olive oil-> canola . I used juice of a whole lemon. I think I would put less water, it was a little too thin for my liking. Im definitely going to use it as a staple. It's very good. I recommend.

When I go to Japanese restaurants, I love their nutty ginger dressing and I could not figure out where the nutty taste was coming from. I thought sesame oil but did not think about tahini sesame paste. This is it!!!  This is the dressing!  Finally. Thank you.

It reminds me of a dressing served on my favorite Middle Eastern Chicken sandwich. I LOVE this! The recipe makes A LOT, I halved it and still have enough for quite some time.

This was a great salad dressing. Only change I made was I used regular soy sauce because it is what I had on hand, plus I added one extra clove of garlic (cuz I love garlic and its so good for you). Even my boyfriend liked it and ate his whole side salad... He doesn't really eat salad or a lot of veggies so it must have been good! It is fairly acidic. I love acidic dressings but I was trying to copy a local tahini dressing I tried which was less acidic and more creamy tasting. Both very delicious in their own way! I will keep hunting but keep this one saved too.

I used balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar.   The dressing needs a little sweetness, I noticed someone else used apple cider vinegar,  so maybe next time I will try that.  I am adding honey roasted nuts to my salad of baby arugula feta and oranges so hopefully it will balance out.  I have to say that tahini  paste on its own tastes nasty.  If you are wondering where to find it in the grocery store, look next to the peanut butter

Very yummy! I added just a little more lemon juice and vinegar to the recipe as I like a little more tang. I also used the homemade tahini recipe that is in the Allrecipe database.

Oh my god! This is so good! I added a little extra fresh ginger, twice the garlic, and a little extra tahini. It came out fantastic! I LOVE ginger and garlic so I absolutely did not find any of the flavors to be overpowering. :) I was surprised that anyone said it came out chalky. Maybe it depends on the quality of tahini paste you use. The tahini paste I used was not quite thick like peanut butter. A little more oily. Anyway, this is a new favorite around here! Will be making it again and again anytime I run out! And salads every day from now on. :D

This dressing was too rich for me.  I doubled the vinegar, added extra garlic and ginger, and would reduce the tahini next time.  Lovely combination of flavors though.

Soo noms.
I've been looking for a recipe to match the Goddess dressing from The Chopped Leaf, and this will satisfy.  Not exactly the same, but definitely good enough when a craving comes on. :)
**I altered the recipe slightly.
A bit more water and soya sauce (I didn't have tamari) to compensate for only using 1/4 cup of olive oil.
Makes approximately 35 tbsp @ 70 cals/tbsp this way.

Way too much tamari! I had to add water, vinegar and additional olive oil to tone down the taste. Trying to recreate a tahini dressing I had at Esalen in Big Sur. This isn't it. Will keep looking.

This recipe was really good! But I had to throw out my first batch because it tasted awful with the tamari! When I left it out it was delish though ! It actually lasted about a week, I would just add a touch of water and shake it up when it would get too thick.

Added 1/3 cup of garbanzo beans to thicken the dressing. Not only was it thicker, it tasted a little like hummus. The tamari definitely needs to be cut back. Overall a fabulous flavor and very simple.

Great combination of ingredients! I didn't measure, just threw the ingredients in a blender, had to use, lime juice no lemon juice in the house.  I didn't use any vinegar we're allergic, no matter still great!  This is yummy on a salad and SO healthy! :-)  Organic ingredients only here.

I swapped apple cider vinegar in place of red wine vinegar and only had powdered ginger but the result was absolutely fabulous!

I like this basic recipe but it seemed really salty.  I think I'd reduce the amount of Tamari next time and perhaps add a little honey.  Otherwise it was very good.

Delicious! I used slightly less olive oil (to save on fat) and only about half the ginger (what I had on hand), but it tastes perfect to me.

Kids ate it up.  That's my rating system.  Had balsamic vinegar but no red wine so I subbed that.

This has become my go to recipe for salad dressing.  When Im out of fresh ginger, I sub a bit of ground ginger, either way this is delicious.

I loved it....the only change I made was using about 1/8 cup toasted sesame oil and reducing the olive oil by that much.

This is a delicious dressing.  A Great Sauce on any Meditteranean style salads (chick peas, parsley etc.) I omitted the water for a thicker consistency. Make sure to use fresh garlic.

I used apple cider vinegar (all I had) half the olive oil and more water. Poured it over sauteed zucchini and brown rice, fantastic!
