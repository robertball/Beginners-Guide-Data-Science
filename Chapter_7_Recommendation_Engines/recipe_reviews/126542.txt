This was a very easy and delicious square. Just be sure not to overbake and store at room temperature. A definite keeper!

Every time I make these, people ask me for the recipe!  I use a double boiler to melt the caramels/butter/condensed milk, though, since you don't have to watch it as carefully as in a saucepan.
