These are the BEST pancakes I have ever eaten.  Usually I like to drown my pancakes in my homemade apple syrup, but these were awesome with a minimal amount of syrup.  
I made these last week, substituting milk and lemon juice for the buttermilk.  It did not work, not sure if that was because of my error or whatever.  In any case, I made it as stated today and they were perfect.  I also scaled the recipe down to 9.6 servings to get equal eggs, etc.  
I really can't say enough about these, this recipe will be my pancake recipe from now on.  You can also scale to 7.2 (3 eggs, 3 flour, 3 buttermilk, etc.); 4.8 (2 eggs, 2 flour, 2 buttermilk); 2.4 (1 egg, 1 flour, 1 buttermilk). 
Thank you for contributing!  My family and I thank you very much!

Okay, so I have never felt compelled to write a recipe review before, but after making and (better yet) tasting these pancakes I just had to write a review!  I am a pancake fiend and have tried just about every pancake mix there is, but I was never fully satisfied w/ the results.  Well, that's all behind me now because this recipe is a keeper!  The pancakes come out so light and fluffy and utterly delicious!!!  I've made this 4 times now for friends and family and everyone raves about them and asks for the recipe.  Also, the last couple of times I made them I added 2 tbsp each of milled flax seed and wheat germ; it doesn't change the taste at all and it adds a little healthy twist to it!

Now that's a pancake!  Light and fluffy...everyone loved them. I scaled recipe back to 4.8 to feed 3 adults and 2 kids. Did not have buttermilk on hand so used 2 tblsp of lemon juice and filled measuring cup to 2cups of Milk...let sit for 5-10 mins to make your buttermilk, then added the required 1/2c regular milk with the rest of the wet ingredients.   Will certainly make again!

Holy PHENOMENAL pancakes, Batman!  I cannot say enough great things about this recipe.  The pancakes come out REALLY light and fluffy... and have a GREAT flavor!  The other reviewer who said that they don't need much syrup, it's true!  I was eating most from the griddle, plain.

I made the recipe as specified, but added a splash of vanilla.  [I also like to try to eat healthy, so I substituted whole wheat flour, which I couldn't even taste because the flavor of this pancake is so awesome, and nonfat plain yogurt for the buttermilk.]

I cannot recommend this recipe enough!  They do come out soooooo light and fluffy and taste like they're straight from the griddle of your fave breakfast restaurant.

[Also, note to those who found their pancakes to be tough and chewy: That's usually a sign that the pancake batter was mixed too long or strongly... try gently mixing in the dry ingredients into the wet slowly and gently until moistened, and see if that makes a difference!]

I have to add my two cents. My family has consistently turned their collective noses up at the many pancake recipes I have tried over the years. Finally, I got unanimous cheers from this one. I never eat pancakes, and I love these. They remind me of the ones at IHOP, soft, fluffy, sweet. These are going in my family recipe book. Thanks a bunch.

My husband has always told me how much he loved the pancakes at a favorite diner that he visited as a child.  He called them "flapjacks", and described them as a thinner, firmer and more flavorful version of traditional pancakes.  I have repeatedly tried and failed to duplicate them for him, UNTIL NOW!!  These are it!!  I made them a few weeks ago for the first time, and he was ecstatic!!  He has requested them every weekend since!!  Since the first time I made them, the only thing I have changed is to add a little vanilla, (makes them a beautiful golden color), but everything else is exactly the same. My search for the perfect "flapjack" is over!!! (After 11 years!!)  Thank you soooo much for this fabulous recipe!!

Yummy!  I had to scale this recipe *way* down as there are only two of us at home and was a little nervous when the conversion was kind of funny (1 1/4 eggs?), but I guesstimated as best I could.  They were fabulous!  My husband's not even a huge pancake fan and he said these were excellent.  They weren't hugely thick like some pancakes, but they fluffed nicely and were oh so good with real maple syrup!  Thanks for the wonderful recipe - it'll be used often.

Great, reliable recipe.  I always like to prepare the batter, then let it sit while I heat the griddle.  The batter thickens a bit which guarantees thick, light and fluffy pancakes.  Real buttermilk pancakes are the best!  I added some frozen blueberries to the batter which made these particularly delicious. Thanks for sharing the reciupe BOBOBEARZOE - these were a real treat!

These are so good! Scaled these back a bit and still had enough to freeze for another time.  There's just something about using real buttermilk that makes things light and fluffy!  Be sure to let the butter cool after melting before adding the eggs so you don't "cook" the eggs. Served with scrambled eggs, bacon,toast, juice and coffee - it's like having the diner experience right in your own house!

I used Sharon's amounts for 3 people (amounts below) and these were the best pancakes I've ever made. My husband said they might be the best he's ever had. Delicious! There was enough batter for about 9 pancakes  For three people and plenty of leftovers I scaled recipe down to 2 eggs, 1/2 cup milk, 2 tablespoons butter,2 cups butter milk, 2 cups flour, 1 3/4 teaspoon baking powder, 1 teaspoon baking soda and 1 1/2 tablespoons sugar.

Have always followed a basic Betty Crocker recipes for my pancakes, with no complaints...thought I would change things up a bit, to see if anyone would notice, so I gave this recipe a try...not only did the family notice, they made me sign a form, stating that, this is the only pancake recipe I will use from now on...

I have been looking for a pancake recipe to please everyone in my family --not to thin, not too heavy, etc--and this one is it.  These pancakes turn out so delicate and moist, they just melt in your mouth.  Don't even think of serving these with anything but real maple syrup.  The flavor combination is amazing.  I have tried making it with milk that I soured with lemon juice (when buttermilk was not on hand) and it just did not work... the batter was too thin.  I do add vanilla like others have done and also a bit of melted butter.  You can't go wrong with this recipe!

very very good recipe.Makes alot but i froze(they freeze wonderfully) the leftover pancake's for another day.I do add a splash of vanilla in them also.Everyone loved them and they were so easy to make.We wont be making pancake's from a box again thnx :) UPDATE:I have been making this recipe for over a year and it is awesome!! For those having issues with the "fluffiness" Make sure all you ingrediants are at room temp  and after you make the batter let it sit and rest for 15-20 minutes then give it a quick stir with your wisk and continue making them.Do not over mix or you will get tuff pancakes.If you having issues with lumps--Please sift your dry ingrediants before mixing with the wet.Lastly REAL Buttermilk is a must with this recipe!!!Powder buttermilk work's.But, doesnt have the same taste in your final product and milk/vinager is just a waste of time.I have add grated apple,blueberries,banana,chocolate chips & even pumkin with a bit of pumkin pie spice.I've scaled the recipe down and up never ever had a problem wiht it.These make the perfect pancakes for me every time and hopefully these tips will work for you also.

These are the first pancakes in 12 years that my husband actually liked! This will be the only pancakes I'll make from now on. The only change I made was that I didn't have any buttermilk so I subbed whole milk with a couple of TBS. of vinegar in it. They were great!

I learned a lot about pancake making by reading through the reviews.  I made this using the exact ingredients - no substitutions - and these were *excellent*!  Here's what I learned from other reviewers....melt the butter then let it sit to cool, let the eggs and milk sit out to come to room temp, DO NOT OVERMIX, cook them a bit lower and slower than a box mix, sift the dry ingredients twice, and don't sub the buttermilk!  We *loved* these fluffy pancakes and, as written, the recipe fed our family of 8 and we even had about 20 pancakes left!  A 1/4 cup measuring scoop works great for a good size pancake.  And, we added blueberries for my husband's pancakes and coated them with a bit of the dry mix to keep them from sinking as one reviewer suggested. EXCELLENT recipe!

I had 2 1/2 cups of buttermilk that had to be used up.  I found this recipe and made a half batch.  I didn't want giant pancakes, so I used my electric skillet (heat @ 350°).  The results were 45 beautiful, fluffy pancakes.  I froze individually on cookie sheets, and then bagged them up in bread sacks.  They heat up great in the microwave (hubby) or the toaster (son) for a quick-hot breakfast.  Thanks BOBOBEARZOE for sharing this recipe.  I will use it again as I'm always looking for ways to use buttermilk.

I'm sad to say I am not a fan of this recipe!  I was so excited to make them based on all the reviews.  I halved the recipe for my husband and I and let the batter sit about 25 minutes.  The batter was a bit runny and made yummy, flat pancakes.  I added flour to make it less runny, as the recipe noted, and they plumped up a bit, but turned completely tasteless.  Syrup could not save them.  Now I have a dozen tasteless disks in my freezer.  Bummer!  I was elated to finally find a buttermilk pancake recipe.  I will not be making this again.

Wow!   These are perfect!  I made a few changes, based on what I had available.  We didn't have buttermilk so I added 5 T of lemon juice to 5 cups of milk as a substitute, and omitted 1 1/2 c. milk.  Also, I used 4 cups all-purpose flour, and 1 c. wheat flour.  The pancakes are as good as any pancakes I ordered at a restaurant.   This recipe is a keeper.

Very tasty recipe. We use it as an evening meal with fruit and vanilla yogurt. 01/0t7/13 Made this again- at last! The recipe is still tops. This time, I served it over mashed potatoes and had Hawaiian Cole Slaw on the side.

Light, melt-in-your-mouth tender. Definitely needs the salt for flavor.  If you leave it out, you'll know it's missing something. If making the full recipe, 1/2 tsp salt is about right (not a pinch.) So quick and easy (and cheap!) to throw together that you'll never so much as think of buying Bisquick ever again.

Absolutely WONDERFUL! One of the best tasting pancakes we have ever had. Fluffy and full of flavor. The ONE NEGATIVE would be the servings. I cut the recipe in half so that we could have 6 pancakes... wrong! Turned out to be 6 servings of 4? lets put it this way, we ate 6 in our family of 4 and the bowl seems to be holding 2 more days of batter. Cut it down to 1-2 servings for a family of four.

Finally, the light and fluffy pancakes I've been looking for! I followed the recipe aside from adding a dash of vanilla.  I took another reviewer's advice and mixed my batter gently JUST until combined (I am guilty of overmixing until smooth before because I thought any lumpiness would cause a problem) and let the batter set for about 15-20 minutes.  These are great, and I think the buttermilk makes a huge difference. I ate my three delicious pancakes with syrup and two pieces of applewood bacon, and it was the most delicious Saturday morning brunch.  I can't wait to have company so I can impress them with these pancakes! Will be my pancake recipe from now on.  THANKS!

We have searched for and made a LOT of pancakes claiming to be like Diner or Truck Stop pancakes, these are THE BEST! The only thing we changed was reducing the sugar (the syrup is sweet enough) and added a little vanilla then we use Crisco shortening on the griddle, that makes the color perfect and the flipping very easy!

I liked this recipe a lot. I've gone through a lot of pancake recipes that I didn't care for, but these were quite tasty! I put blueberries in some of them to add a little interest!

I cut this down to 6 servings because although my boys can eat, they really can't eat THAT much. My boys ate every bit, I only got ONE pancake! I served this with the leftover glazed kielbasa, onions and apples with Absolute Best Pancake Syrup. Next time I'll make the whole batch and freeze the rest in batches to warm in the toaster for busy mornings. NOTE: I took a tip I got from Taste of Home years ago and when adding a half of an egg, measured the egg and then added half of whatever the measurement was. Also, as I learned years ago, I wisk the dry ingredients together, then add the combined wet and mix until just moistened. It makes for a fluffy pancake that's in no way tough.

I wouldn't change a thing in this recipe.  Sometimes the best recipes are the simplest.  I added the zest of a lemon for a twist.  And instead of using maple syrup, I made a Blueberry Compote.  BLUEBERRY COMPOTE: 2 1/2 cups frozen blueberries, unthawed 1/3 cup sugar (can also use Splenda) 1/3 cup water  Combine 1 1/2 cups blueberries, sugar and water in heavy small saucepan.  Simmer over medium heat, stirring frequently until berries burst (about 10 minutes).   Add remaining 1 cup of blueberries.  Cook until compote coats spoon, about another 8 minutes.  Serve warm.  I even top vanilla ice cream with this compote, but it's perfect with pancakes!  Thanks for the recipe!

WOW!!!  These tasted and looked exactly as I expected them to.  They were fluffy, yet had substance to them and had great flavor without being too sweet.  My kids kept saying how they tasted just like the ones at the restaurant (probably because they've never eaten at a truck-stop).  My husband said, this is what pancakes should taste like.  I'm guessing they all liked them.  I did cut the recipe in half, which still yielded me 19 pancakes.  My kids will be thrilled when they get the leftovers for breakfast tomorrow.

Very good pancakes. I think this might be the batter I use from now on. I only used the amount of buttermilk asked for and not the regular milk which was more than enough liquid. After tasting the batter I realized it needed a little sweetening up so I added so light Agave Nectar till desired sweetness. They fried up perfectly on my cast iron griddle, nice and buttery golden brown!

Excellent pancakes.  I subbed spelt flour for about 1/4 of the flour and added some malt powder and plent of vanilla.  The entire family loved them.  They are so light and fluffy.

really amazing pancake recipe!!! really nice and soft and fluffy and yummy and crispy on the edges, and for the first time in my entire life i managed to toss it without it going on the floor...now thats a sign of a good pancake if ever i saw one!! I used gluten free flour and also used lemon juice and milk instead of the buttermilk, really really good! tomorrow i shall be trying the rest of the batter out on the whole family, i'm sure they'll love these pancakes as much as me :D

these are restaurant quality pancakes. Beware, though, you will be making pancakes for at least an hour. The batch is enormous. Also, i would probably add lemon or vanilla extract and a little more butter the next time i make it.

If you like thick, fluffy pancakes, this is definitely NOT the recipe for you.  These are very very thin pancakes.   Will never use this recipe again.

I scaled this to 6 to feed 2 adults, 2 teens with big appetites and 2 more youths and it made 25 slightly heaping ¼C pancakes which was perfect, only 2 were left over.  However I dont think the conversion for 6 very works well.  If I make them again I will reduce both b.soda and b.powder by ¼tsp and the milk (not the buttermilk) by a ¼C. I thought they were about a 3.5 but the kids said they wouldnt mind having them again. Thanks.

i was a little skeptical about freezing this recipe, but sure enough it tasted great defrosted, too. i made the recipe as is and froze the batch in 4 parts (using zip-lock freezer bags)...so pleased that i have 4 tasty breakfasts for my family waiting in the freezer! and yes, this recipe tastes a zillion times better than any pancake mix from the store.

Buttermilk is so thick that any buttermilk pancakes need to be cooked with a lower heat longer to ensure that your cake will not be sticky.

I followed this recipe exactly. It made 41 pancakes and they are delicious! My family loved them. There are only 3 of us so I plan on freezing most of them for quick meals during the month.

We hosted ten 16-year old girls for a sleepover who were treated to these homemade pancakes. They loved them! I followed the recipe exactly as written, and made the whole batch. It made a ton, but only about 5 were leftover.

A++, got rave reviews from happy campers. A keeper. I omitted the optional salt and put the milk in last using it to thin to our preference. This makes A LOT of batter!!!

After trying this recipe and a few others on the site, this recipe is a hassle to make.  It's a huge recipe, there are too many ingredients and the consistency was off.  As far as my recipe comparison has gone, my favorite so far, because of the great taste and  sheer simplicity is the Mom's Buttermilk pancake recipe.  They're delicious lol.

These are delicious pancakes!  I halved the recipe but used 3 eggs.  As part of the flour mixture, I used 1/4 cup of wheat germ.  The only other change I will make next time is to add some vanilla to the batter.  They keep long enough in the refrigerator to use for several breakfasts.  Very good recipe.  They will go into my regular rotation of meals.

This is IT!!! I have been looking for the perfect pancake recipe and this is it!  Light & Fluffy!  I scaled it down to 7 servings ( US ) and we had plenty for dinner for 4 of us and also some left over for breakfast the next day before school for the guys.

Very good!  I halved the recipe for my family of 5 and still had leftovers to put in the freezer.  I can only make 4 pancakes at a time in my electric skillet, so to move things along faster, I also got out the waffle iron, and it made good waffles, too!
(The half recipe calls for 2.5 eggs; I just use 2 whole eggs and one egg white.)

The name for this pancake is perfect.  It tastes just like a diner’s pancake.  It is light and fluffy with good flavor.  This recipe makes a considerable amount so I scaled it back to 5 servings and used 2 eggs.

These are delicious. I cut the recipe to 5 servings and managed to get 2 eggs, instead of a partial amount, in the list of ingredients. It's hard to measure half an egg and wasteful too.

These are so yummy! I scaled the recipe WAY down, as there were only four of us eating them.  Topped with some real maple syrup, these were probably the best pancakes I have eaten.

I don't know if it's fair to rate a recipe where I've made a major substitution, but the flavor of this pancake was so good.  In fact, my quest for the perfect pancake recipe is over.  I really never have buttermilk in my fridge, and a lot of the reviews that subbed milk and vinegar or milk and lemon juice said it didn't turn out, so, I used 2 cups nonfat plain yogurt.  (I had to scale the recipe down to 5 servings as I was only feeding 3 people)  This recipe was so good!  I also added a splash of vanilla.  I hope to try this with buttermilk next time, but it was so good with the yogurt, I'm not sure!  Happy cooking!

Because I eat pancakes solely for the syrup factor I give these a five. They soaked up the syrup like a sponge and had a very light pancake taste. If you are a fan of pancake flavor you may want to add a little something.  I ate them the next day cut up in strips and they reheated fabulously. I liked that they browned well and were as big as my head but still cooked thoroughly.

Really like these, but still can't seem to find pancakes as good as ihop.  Not even the ihop copycat recipe is as good as ihop.  But these were definitely yummy.  Some of the best I've made at home.  One tip, rather than stirring in blueberries, chocolate chips, whatever, pour the pancake batter on the pan, sprinkle with the berries, etc., then flip as usual.  No blue pancakes, and perfect distribution of goodies!

This is by far the best tasting pancake I have ever made. It holds up well enough to mix in blueberries. I didn't have buttermilk so I made a substitute. I know another reviewer had no luck without real buttermilk but mine was great. You mix 1 tablespoon of white vinegar in with just under 1 cup of milk. Let it stand for 5 minutes before using in this recipe. Delish!!! Thank you.

These pancakes were great.  The recipe made a lot but I like to make them and either freeze them for future weekday breakfasts or stick them in the fridge for that weeks on-the-run breakfasts.  I did have to add more milk to make them less thick (but I always do that b/c I like them thinner - and they cook faster).  Overall, these were delcious and better than the other recipe we tried on here I think.

I used the calc. to modify to just 2 servings.  They were fluffy & had nice texture.  Because it's a buttermilk batter I rate it slightly above average.  Perhaps it's the modifying that is making some of the differences but I found these to be just o.k. A little pastey in taste or I would say "good" instead of o.k.  Will try again if I don't find a smaller quantity recipe first.

I felt compelled to make a comment on this recipe.  This is how awesome it was.  I cut everything down to 1 part these pancakes were just for my friend.  He loved them.  He said that taste like Aunt Jemimas' buttermilk pancakes from the box.  Remember, don't overmix. And now I realize a batch from scratch has to cook slower than the box pancakes. I think I will experiment with these the next time and add a little cinnamon and a tad of brown sugar to them.  Awesome Recipe. Thank you so much!

Used AllRecipe to scale down the recipe to 4 servings.. unfortunately, they tasted strongly of baking powder/soda and were inedible - it called for 1tsp of each to about 1 cup of flour.. I might try this again but will use maybe just a 1/4 tsp of powder/soda for the same flour measurements.

These were very delicious.  I did have to make my own buttermilk with milk and lemon juice(5 cups milk-5 tbsp lemon juice)..but I cant wait to make them again when I go out and get some pre-made buttermilk.  I bet they will be even yummier.  It made a ton of pancakes which I like because I freeze the leftovers for a quick and easy breakfast in the morning for the fam.  Pop in the microwave for 30 seconds and they taste just as delicious.  THANKS!

I made these buttermilk pancakes for the first time last week and I won't go back to my regular pancake recipe. I cut it back to 2 servings (1 egg, 1 cup flour, 1 cup buttermilk, etc.) and they turned out wonderful!

Easy and good -- decreased recipe to 1 instead of 5, and the integrity of the original recipe did not seem to be affected.  Will keep this in my recipe box for future reference.

My first attempt making pancakes from scratch - the flavor was just what I imagined pancakes should taste like. The next time I made these I added about 3T cocoa powder and some powdered sugar to taste. After pouring out each pancake, I sprinkled the wet side with nutmeg and cinnamon. They were absolutely stunning. I served them with real maple syrup and a few slices of pink lady apples to combat the richness. I was proclaimed a genius and everyone had at least four helpings.

Very good homemade pancakes...however scaled it back like other cooks did...think it was the 4.8(so you don't have to perform algebra to get your eggs right.  I used 2).  Made a BUNCH.  I can't imagine how big the original pancakes were!  However, measured carefully still came out tasting the baking soda.  Will use less next time.  Nice pancakes...not too fluffy.  I like them a little thinner.  Thanks.

I had awesome results with this one and will toss out my other recipe for pancakes from scratch.  I scaled this to 4.8 servings which called for exactly 2 eggs and a pint of buttermilk.  It made plenty of batter, just over 4 cups, for my family of 5. I followed the recipe exactly except for adding a bit of vanilla.

Very good.  Very tender and yes, they do "melt in your mouth."  Thanks to Charissalynn for the "scaled down" version.  I used the serving size for 7.2 and that fed a family of four, including a teenaged pancake lover.  Followed the recipe exactly.  Thanks for sharing!

darned good recipe for buttermilk pancakes. This recipe is massive, so use the recipe conversion to scale down.  We did it for 6 and still had masses left over.

I found these to be very gummy tasting.  They weren't nice and fluffy like pancakes should be.  They were also very thin, more like a thick crepe rather than a pancake.  I won't make these again.

This is a huge recipe, but don't let that turn you off because it's really good.  We have made the full recipe and scaled down and either way it is yummy.  If I don't have buttermilk on hand I use the 1C milk + 1T lemon juice to make the sour milk.  The lemon adds a nice flavor, especially if we add blueberries!  Yum!

These pancakes are fantastic!! I made them for a Mother's Day Breakfast & they were a huge hit... This is a great recipe that yields a tender, moist & buttery pancake. I think it's  the pancake you find in good diners. It's a must try!!!

These pancakes were just ok.  They came out flat and bland tasting.  I added cinnamon to the remaining batter for additional flavor.  I'll try out a different recipe next time.

These were not my favorite pancakes ever but they were very good.  I couldn't get the widget that recalculates the recipe for a lower number of servings to work and I was too tired to do it manually - big mistake, there is so much batter left over that we (4)  couldn't possibly finish it even if we had pancakes every day for the rest of the week.  I subbed white whole wheat flour for half of the flour, otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  They are very light and fluffy with good flavor.  We tried them with blueberries and syrup and with mini chocolate chips.

Good, but not the best pancakes I have ever had. They were a little hard to flip as they never really firmed up enough, so that was pretty messy. The servings on this recipe seem to be off, as it makes a vat of batter, I would say closer to 24 servings than 12. Good to try, though. Thanks!

These are without a doubt the best pancakes we have ever eaten.  It's just the two of us, but we make them for our grown children and grandchildren on Sunday mornings.  Our grandchildren like to help mix the batter.  After tasting these, they will no longer eat any other kind.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe and for helping us to create a memorable family tradition!

Love these pancakes!!!!  they are so light and fluffy it's great!!!!  they also make a lot so i can freeze the extra fro when the kids want them thru the week!!  i did take a few tips from previous posters.  i mix all the wet ingredients and then put in the microwave for 1-2 minutes just to warm and take the chill off then i add the butter and mix and the "dry" ingredients.  i also add vanilla and more sugar.  these are really great i'm so gald i found this recipe it is definatly my go to pancake recipe!!!!!!!!

I was expecting more flavor. I made enough for 5 servings so that i could have the even amount of eggs. I didn't feel like manually converting the recipe. i dropped batter in the griddle by 1/4 cup to make small pancakes. I will add salt to the remain batter to see if it gives it more flavor and a tsp of vanilla and pecans.

These have a nice buttery flavor.  I am still on the search for big FLUFFY pancakes.  These were very good though.  I used whole wheat flour and so they had a nice texture.

I was very leery based on some of he bad reviews, but I decided to try these out anyway.  I didn't have any buttermilk on hand, but these were still EXCELLENT!  The only changes I made were I soured my milk with vinegar overnight to use in this recipe the next morning to substitute for the buttermilk, plus I added a dash of vanilla.  The batter wasn't as nice as many other pancake batters I've used (it was very lumpy and runny), but the cooked pancakes were so good that it didn't matter.  Hubby said these were the best pancakes he's ever had.  I am inclined to agree, although they look and taste just like my grandmother's pancakes.  I'm ecstatic that I now can make pancakes as good as hers since I never got the recipe before she passed away.  I will never use another pancake recipe again!  I can't wait to try these using real buttermilk too!

My daughter and I tried this recipe as written but scaled it to 5 servings.  I did sift the dry ingredients together after measuring.  The first test pancake was way too thin and rubbery.  Added 1/2 c more flour and still too thin and rubbery.  Added 3/4 cup more flour and it came out fluffy.  Although we liked the taste, I wouldn't want readers to think the recipe works as it is written, at least it didn't for us.  Sorry!

These pancakes were delicious! They did turn out light and fluffy and I was careful not to overbeat the batter.I added a little vanilla and halved the recipe which was easy except for the egg. I decided the best way was to beat it in a bowl then add half.My mom wanted to try one with blueberries so I sprinkled some blueberries on a few of the pancakes before flipping and they turned out really good too.I'll probably make some with blueberries every time.I just used frozen ones that we partially thawed.I plan on keeping plenty of buttermilk on hand because I'll be making these pancakes often.

These have become our family favorite!   It does not matter if you use All-purpose flour or WW flour it doesn't change the taste of these pancakes. Other than the flour we have not changed a thing.  We have served these plain, w Choc chips, sliced banana doesn't matter what you like they are awesome pancakes

These turn out as good as any I've had at a truckstop, IHOP or pancake house in general.  I generously added vanilla, as I always do when making pancakes.  Made for my daughter's birthday sleepover and they were devoured by all.

Really great pancakes.  When I don't have buttermilk easily handy, I use dried buttermilk mix.  It works as well and I don't have a lot of leftover buttermilk.  Everyone loves these pancakes.

I used liquid buttermilk. CONS>> The pancakes consistency was that of french toast (which I do not personally like), but my brother liked them fine. I made waffles and pancakes just to use up the batter.   >>By the way, 5 eggs?? Thanks.. How are you supposed to halve that recipe?> the batter is sweet, I'll give it that. Just need to do something about the texture, and make the recipe more versatile. BOTTOM LINE>>this recipe makes pancake goo. :-/

These are pretty good.  I made 2/5 recipe and got about a dozen pancakes.  Mine came out kind of flat, so maybe I thinned the batter out too much.  I only gave this recipe 4 stars because I thought there was something missing in the flavor.  I'm not sure what it's missing - more salt or add some vanilla?

Wow, these are the best, fluffiest, and tastiest pancakes going. Made as written and no changes necessary.  A word of warning - this recipe makes a lot of pancakes. Also I would use real buttermilk rather than the substitute. Thanks for the recipe!

This is THE BEST pancake recipe ever!  My granddaughter is always asking when she can spend the night and have "Nanacakes" in the morning.  My friends love them too.  The only difference in my ingredients is I add vanilla and I grate fresh nutmeg into the batter.  This is now my only pancake recipe.

These were so easy and SO yummy! First off, I halved the recipe since I didn't need so many pancakes. Also, since I was running out of sugar at the moment, I only used about 1 T- still great! My kids gobbled these up with local Grade B syrup. Yum... Will definitely make again!

These were very good.. A little too thin for my liking, but overall a very yummy pancake!! I had to recalculate the recipe for 5 servings, so I dont know if that is the reason that they were thin, maybe it needs to be made in the amount listed. I also did not have buttermilk on hand, so I used 2 TBSP lemon juice to make a substitution.  My husband liked these and he is pretty picky about his pancakes, so I will defintately make these again!! Thanks!

This is by far the best pancake recipe I have ever made. I will never make instant pancakes again. I only had a pint of buttermilk so I just used milk for the rest and they turned out great. I cut the recipe down to 5 servings and had extras. The only thing I added was a teaspoon and a half of vanilla and a little cinnamon. I will be using this as my pancake recipe from now on.

My husband has never been a fan of my pancakes so I set out on a search for a new recipe. I've tried several but they never quite lived up to expectations. I actually got great reviews from the family on this one. Definitely a keeper.

Wow, This was awful awful awful! I was super excited to try this recipe because of all of the reviews, but the taste of the baking soda was overwhelming and it made the pancakes inedible.

These were very good. So thick and very filling. I did add a bit of extra milk to the batter to thin it out a little bit but not to much. Thanks!

I made these pancakes on Easter morning and they turned out fluffy and light, my husband really loved them, I just added some vanilla to the recipe, and I cut the recipe down to 1/5 the ingredients, and it was plenty for the two of us.

This recipe is really good! I'm living abroad and was craving real fluffy pancakes and this recipe definitely did the trick. I tried to reduce the recipe and it still made a TON of pancakes, so it was a good thing that the batter was okay (covered with saran-wrap) in the fridge for a couple of days, because I had pancakes coming out of my ears. :)

These are amazing!  In the past, made-from-scratch pancakes always turned out flat and tasteless, thus I've resorted to buying pancake mix for years.  This recipe has undoubtedly changed that!  To make it a little lighter, I substituted egg whites for the whole eggs, used skim milk with 1 Tbsp vinegar instead of buttermilk, and used a mixture of whole-wheat and self-rising flour in place of the all-purpose flour (and used a little extra baking powder).  This is a new favorite!!

I guess I can't use expletives... so I'll just say that these are the best pancakes ever, and I didn't even have buttermilk!
I just added about 2tbls lemon juice to the buttermilk "milk" portion of the recipe.  It got rave reviews from my daughters friend spending the night, and she is pretty picky!
yum!

Hands down, the best pancake recipe ever! Fluffy, light and flavorful. Beats the pants off the national pancake chain!! I scaled it to 6 servings and I still have leftovers for quick weekday breakfast for my toddler. A great, versatile pancake recipe! Must try!!!

This is absolutely delicious, fluffy, just wonderful.  I made the recipe exactly as written, except I used light butter. Also since I cut the recipe in half, I used 2 eggs and 1 egg white (to equal 2 and 1/2 eggs).  I debated whether to add vanilla, but decided to leave the recipe as is and I'm glad I did.  This will probably be our pancake recipe from now on.  I have some more buttermilk, so I think I'll make another batch.  I already froze some for my son's breakfast before school.

These came out very fluffy, they rose up very high. Probably the fluffiest pancake I have ever made. The batter thickened up quite a bit during standing so they didn't turn out pretty and round shaped, a bit lopsided, but my guys didn't mind. They ate them too fast. I scaled this down to our small family size. Thanks, I'll use this again.

I made a few changes due to the fact that I didn't have any buttermilk on hand.  I substituted nonfat plain yogurt for the buttermilk and also added Vanilla.  These were the fluffiest, lightest pancakes I've ever eaten!  I would definitely put them up against IHOP pancakes.

LOWER FAT VERSION:  Substituted low-fat yogurt for buttermilk, used less butter, and used WW flour for 1/3 of total flour mixture.  Very, very good.  I cut the recipe in half and still thought there was enough for a truck-stock!

**Update: I had been thinking about these pancakes ever since I made them last weekend, but I didn't have enough buttermilk to make more.  I finally broke down this morning and tried them using half buttermilk-half milk/vinegar.  Although the texture and appearance was the same as the original, I just didn't think that the taste compared!  I also don't care for these after they've been frozen, so I'll have to scale the recipe way back to make only what we need.  I love freezing the Pumpkin Pancakes recipe from this site, but it seemed like the taste of these pancakes changed after freezing!**  
I was looking for a pancake recipe that would make me think I was spending my morning at Cracker Barrel.  My husband says that they don't necessarily taste like Cracker Barrel's (although I think they're pretty close!), but he did say that they are definitely five star!  I really think that using buttermilk is the key (not a substitute).  We'll definitely be making these again!  Oh- I only made a third of the recipe, and it made at least 15 5-inch pancakes!

OHH YEAH!  These were by far the best pancakes I have ever made in my life!!!  I could not ask for a better recipe and I hope I never lose this one.  I used my electric griddle and it worked great. Just be careful to lightly brown on each side.  Overbrowning will cause your pancakes to be harder.  Thank you for the recipe!!!  And I agree with the other person that said these top IHOP's.  I think if IHOP went with this recipe, my budget would be in some serious trouble!!  I love these and will use only this recipe from now on.

Amazing! My family love these pancakes. They always turn out perfect. I like to add extra tbsp of sugar.  I put the left over batter in a pitcher to store in fridge. then just pour batter straight out of pitcher onto griddle. This batter will stay good a couple days in fridge.

I was afraid to making these delicious pancakes because all my past pancakes dont come out as great as diner style. To me this is the closest I will get to I-hop. For my husband this is the closest he will get to waffle house as he says. Thank you for sharing this I love pancakes and Ive been searching for that great tasting pancakes. By the way I added a little more vanilla.

The only difference I did was using oil in place of butter. And because other reviewers had mentioned that the recipe yields too many pancakes, I scalded it down. But, this recipe is awesome by itself; it makes the lightest, fluffiest pancakes. Yum!

I tried these pancakes because of the interesting name, but the taste will keep me coming back to this recipe...  They were the perfect consistency, fluffy and delicious.  I used all of the batter, but froze the leftovers.  Cooled them on a wire rack, then put a piece of wax paper between the stack and froze them in a ziploc bag.

THESE PANCAKES WERE NOT FLAVORFUL OR FLUFFY AT ALL. I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THESE AT ALL. IT SPECIFIED TO MUCH LIQUID AND IT NEEDED SOME TYPE OF FLAVORING AGENT. IT JUST WAS BLAND,FLAT AND OUTRIGHT BORING.  DO NOT MAKE THE WHOLE MIX AS IT READS USE THE SITE MODIFIER TO MAKE A SMALLER BATCH AND SEE FOR YOURSELF.

Oh my God--these were AMAZING!!  I've tried over a dozen different pancake recipes over the years, and these were the only ones that actually turned out as light and fluffy as promised, even with all the low-gluten, low-dairy, no-added-sugar substitutions we have to make.  Here were the dietary changes we made: Used plain almond milk instead of dairy, plain soy yogurt instead of buttermilk (vanilla-flavored would have worked slightly better, but I was out), mixed sugar-free maple syrup in with the wet ingredients instead of sugar with the dry, and used spelt flour in place of all-purpose.  I also added a little more almond milk than the recipe called for to thin the yogurt to buttermilk consistency.  We topped these with organic blueberries and sugar-free maple-syrup, and they were just excellent.  I will never need another pancake recipe again.  Thank you so much, Bobobearzoe!!! : )

Best pancakes I ever had!  To make them lighter and fluffier, I separated the egg whites and whipped them up adding them at the very end of the recipe.

This recipe made delicious pancakes. I did have to add about 1 cup more flour as my batter was too thin and would have made very thin pancakes, and I like mine thick and fluffy. I had a ton of leftover batter even for a family of 2 adults and 4 kids and I'm not sure how long batter can stay in the fridge, so next time I'll half the recipe. Thanks for the great recipe!

I tried these this morning.  I scaled down the recipe to about five servings.  Added some vanilla, fresh blueberries, and wheat germ.  I also added more sugar than called for and some more flour until the right consistancy.  With that said, I thought these were good, but we like our pancakes to be a little more sweet.  I especially like it a bit more sweet, because I like to add less toppings and just eat the pancake itself.  Without the sweetness, I put more toppings to even it out.  So these tasted good, but would be even better with more sugar, in my opinion.  Otherwise, these were nice and fluffy, which is what we love.  I will likely make these again, just with more sugar and added additions, like blueberries.  Thanks!  :)

Perfect pancake recipe.  I used it at my restaurant for our brunch buffet this past Sunday and the customers loved them.

I've been trying pancake recipes for >25 years trying to find the right one.  This is it! I even changed it a bit by re-calculating it to serve 4 and substituted low fat butter, skim milk and Splenda instead of sugar. These were still fluffier and tasted better than any recipe I have ever used.  Thanks, this one is definitely a keeper!

I've tried lots of pancake recipes, but none have ever been requested twice by my picky family.  These are now the only recipe we make.  If I don't have buttermilk, I make my own, but I pretty much just keep it on hand now because these are requested so often!  I use white whole wheat flour & add 1 tsp. vanilla & they turn out great!

Prior to trying these, we thought our favorite stand-by pancake recipe was the greatest... now there's no going back!  We reduced the servings down to 9.6 per another reviewer's suggestion, and this still made quite a lot!

This recipe is fabulous with a few changes. The texture of these pancakes is perfect, but they are a little bland as is. I cut the recipe in half, (because this makes A LOT!) and added about a tablespoon of lemon juice, a teaspoon each of vanilla extract and cinnamon, and a little extra salt. I think the lemon juice was what it needed the most. After that, they reallly were amazing diner quality pancakes with delicious crispy edges. They made a wonderful lazy Sunday morning breakfast!=) Thanks!

I was skeptical of this recipe as there was so much baking powder and baking soda but I gave it a shot and I am so impressed. Thick yet light, fluffy and flavorful pancakes. The only thing I recommend changing is adding vanilla. Great recipe.

Pretty good.  You can really dress them up how you like...apples & cinnamon, toasted walnuts.  They are a bit thin, fine by me but not a "meaty" pancake you'll really sink your teeth into...that's the point - nice and light tasting!

i love pancakes & buttermilk! however, i guess i'm a weirdo... because i really DON'T like this recipe.. first, off, the texture is horrible... way too floppy, eggy, & they seem undercooked even when fully cooked... also, i scaled the recipe down to 5 servings, used 1/2 tsp. salt & they were STILL too sweet. i love pancakes with butter & syrup, but.. these pancakes didn't go well with either. they probably needed to be deep fried & salted.

Very light and fluffy. I took the advice of CHARISSALYNN and scaled to 2.4. It made about 6 large pancakes just enough for my boyfriend and I. I used 1 tbsp vinegar + 1 cup of milk to sub for the buttermilk. I also added 1 tsp vanilla, but may add a little more next time because I like sweeter pancakes. Thanks for posting!

This recipe was really easy and they melt in your mouth.  I decided to have the first set this time.  With 4 boys I am always the last.  THey did not taste bland to me.  Maybe it was the way I cooked them.  I put margarine in the pan to make them after each one.  I tried a little piece before putting anything on them and they were sweet and very light.  Thanks for the recipe BOBOBEARZOE. This is a keeper.

This recipe is probably the best set of pancakes my wife and I have had. It puts to shame any prepackaged buttermilk pancake mixes or any pancake mix. I followed the recipe exactly and voila, exceptional! they rise nicely and are delicious.  Make these, you will not regret having to go out and get some buttermilk.

Ok these are AWESOME!  Many comments already on that. (I made them exactly as stated but halved)  But I want to emphasize not over mixing. The first half of my batch (plain) turned out beautifully. But my children like mini chocolate chips in theirs, and after painstakingly adding a few to each one after dropping in skillet (which still turned out perfectly) I decided to mix them into the rest of the batter.  Just mixing them in changed the batter and the texture of the pancakes. They were flatter and smoother with less life. If you want to add something I suggest adding to each pancake after putting in skillet or mixing in to dry mix before blending with wet. Definitely want the lumps!!

These were DELICIOUS!!!!  My family absolutely loved them! Since there's only 3 eating these I cut this recipe down to 7 servings, thinking that would be small enough, but I had enough to freeze and enough to feed my two kids breakfast one morning.  They make large, fluffy, pieces of heaven that everyone should try!!!!

I've never made pancakes forms scratch before, but I had some buttermilk to use up and the rest of the ingredients on hand.  These were amazing! The perfect start to Christmas Day!  Perfectly fluffy and moist enough to not need a ton of syrup.  I'll never make from a mix again!

These are the best pancakes -- bought buttermilk for another recipe from this site (apricot muffins - delish) and wanted to find another recipe.  They are very good and of course with the real deal maple syrup.

Hey! 

These pancakes are delicious. They turn out very nice and light and fluffy. However, I am taking away a star because of a couple of issues. 

A. I didn't think the batter would be so much. I was like "Oh, twelve servings. That'll be fine. I'll eat like half of it anyway, and we'll just refrigerate the rest."......dear Lord. Pretty sure you could feed an army with what came out of the recipe. Don't be an idiot like I was and scale down the servings a bit. 

B. The batter itself can use some sort of flavoring. For a truckstop, I imagine the most feasible would be vanilla, but anything will do. They're just kind of tasteless. 

C. Time. I don't tend to stick to recipe guidelines for how long it should take, but this took about an hour and a half to complete.

These are so awesome. This is the second time I have made them. It's only my husband and I, but I still make the whole batch and freeze them. They hold up well and now we have pancakes any time we want to and they're on hand for a quick breakfast when we have family and guests stay over.

Had to add about 2 extra cups of milk to make it the right consistency, but they were delicious!! The while family loved them!

These were okay.  Batter was a little less thick than my usual recipe - so it spread more.  Subbed a cup of whole wheat, increased salt to 1/8t & added 1 1/2t vanilla.  Made a lot - filled a 4L bowl.  Prefer Buttermilk Pancakes II by Burygold better.

I didn't like these so much . . . they ended up with a slightly rubbery consistency. Also, there was an excessive amount of batter, even when I reduced it to 4 servings. May try this again, but will reduce it to 3-servings, remembering not to overspray the pan with PAM (as it left a funky flavor on some of the later pancakes).

This is the first time I made pancakes from scratch. I have always made them from a box.  I did not care for these at all.  I'm glad I cut it down and yes, I used the right measurements.  I looked to make sure I didn't forget something, I didn't.  I will stick with the box for now.

I use half buttermilk/half vanilla almond milk. And I add a large dose of cinnamon and a bit of vanilla extract. The crowd loves them!

My son, a professional chef, came for a visit this summer and I suggested we try these pancakes.  We were both thrilled at the delicious way they turned out.  He is going to keep this recipe and put it into his rotation.  A big +PLUS+ for this recipe that we made exactly as written.

AMAZING cooked over a campfire on cast iron, but good at home too:)  Our kids favorite, always a big hit.  I scale the recipe back to 7 servings, and there's enough pancakes to feed 5 of us and still have some to freeze for breakfasts over the next few weeks.

These are a keeper! I made a couple changes you should try. I didn't have buttermilk so I added vanilla yogurt and a little more milk as well as some additional vanilla. This recipe is going into my favorites file. Thank you for sharing

The perfect pancake.  Sift your dry ingredients.  Bring your refrigerated ingredients to room temperature.  Mix sparingly.  Add a splash of vanilla if desired.  This can't be beat!

YUM!  The BEST flapjacks I have had in years!  The only thing I did different was make 5 servings and added 1 tsp of vanilla.  I've been missing my grandma's flapjacks, everything else is a flavorless sponge compared to this.

Restaurant-style pancakes, crispy on the edges with a soft, flavorful center. I have used another allrecipes recipe for years, and just tried this one to use up some buttermilk. Even better! This will be my "go-to" recipe when I have a crowd...it makes a LOT of pancakes!

These pancakes are awesome. I keep buttermilk in my fridge at all times because we make these pancakes almost weekly. I do use low fat buttermilk but I don't know how much of a difference that makes because I have never bought regular??? All I know is that a group of us girls went to breakfast at a local restaurant and I ordered buttermilk pancakes....needless to say they didn't even come close to being as good as making this recipe. It does make a lot... so I half the recipe.

Honestly I have nothing negative to say about these. They are delicious. I've successfully added dried fruit (especially dried blueberries chopped up in the processor) and nuts. This is a keeper and huge family hit. We've had a lot of pancake recipes. I can stop here.

This truly is the best buttermilk pancake recipe ever.  Period!  One caution - definitely listen to all the others who have said that this recipe makes a ton of pancake batter.  Luckily, if you have extra batter, even after adjusting ingredients for another serving amount, the batter keeps pretty well for another day in the fridge or you can freeze additional cakes and microwave them as needed.

Even scaled back this still made way more pancakes than this family of 4 could eat.  They were however by far the best pancakes I have ever made.  I did add a bit of butter extract to the batter, just because I usually do that to all my pancakes and waffles.

I have been making this recipe for years untouched and EVERYONE in my family loves it.  In fact if they see the buttermilk in my frig, the kids say "Are you making Truck-Stop Pancakes?".  So spongy and delicious.  Also, since the amounts of ingredients is so even you can adjust the amount without many fractions.  My family of six had ingredients based on 4 eggs, flour, etc.  I think they could have eaten the full batch!

I thought I'd found the perfect pancake on here months ago, but trying to use up some buttermilk I stumbled across this one and my boyfriend said they were the best pancakes he'd had in his whole life.  They are everything a pancake should be.

Fanananana-tastic!  We made super huge ones, 8" across, and the whole family absolutely loved them. The consistency is very moist; I had never had home made pancakes before that weren't from a mix, these are a winner!

Good pancakes!  I cut the recipe in half, and used a full 3 eggs instead of the 2 1/2.  I also added about a 1/4 cup more flour as well.  They came out nice and fluffy!

I've never tasted pancakes this good!  These honestly melt in your mouth!  I usually drench my pancakes in syrup and choke them down, but these required verry little syrup and they were so light and fluffy.  My husband just raved about them and told me not to lose this recipe!!  YUMMY!

We really enjoyed the pancakes (the name does not do the recipe justice).  Serve this with Buttermilk Syrup (also found in AllRecipes.com) for a great breakfast meal.

Perfect pancakes.  My husband is a pancake snob and asked me to keep this recipe around so he can make them himself.  Definitely a keeper.  Thank you!

Don't see what the big deal is about these pancakes.  They are just ordinary - flat and limp, nothing special.  My ingredients were all fresh - won't make these again.

I wanted to like this more - the reviews were so good! But the pancakes weren't anything special and the batter was difficult to work with. Mine turned out somewhat runny, so it was hard to flip the pancakes and when I tried adding blueberries, the berries would fall out. BUT I didn't want to add more flour because the first couple I'd made already tasted really flour-y. Anyways, they're serviceable enough pancakes, but I could have gotten as good or better results from a store bought mix. Thanks for the recipe, but I personally will go back to kris's "Fluffy Pancakes" recipe.

good recipe,does need vanilla though. FYI buttermilk. You can buy as a dry powder that you reconstitute.Although I usually have fresh buttermilk on hand for soaking chicken, I keep the powdered buttermilk as a backup pantry staple.

Made these with whole wheat flour. YUM! It does seem like a lot of batter, but it's really not when you use 1/4 c. scoops. Based on other reviews I made the full batch thinking it would feed 35-40 people. I got about 48 pancakes from the batter which is 4 pancakes for each of the 12 original servings, and not enough for 40 people. Thankfully we had other breakfast items to supplement. The number of servings on the recipe is accurate.

Excellent. Getting to be a weekend tradition. Recipe is large enough for a truck-stop restaurant but I always cut it down by dividing by 5. Sometimes I use 1/2 wheat flour to make it healthier and add berries and ground pecans or almonds. Have to go make these again now. These are so good that you can even leave them plain and pick them up and just eat them.

These pancakes were a big hit with my husband, who is VERY particular about pancakes in general. I ended up using reduced-fat buttermilk (that was all the store had), and they still came out wonderfully!

I thought this was okay, but rather bland in flavor.  I've tried three popular pancake recipes on this site, and this was my least favorite.  The flour itself really stood out for me.  This is for the exact recipe with no substitutions, because I'm not a big fan of people altering recipes and then rating them.

I used this last night for our church's Shrove Tuesday and it was a hit.  I thought I would have enough with just one batch.  Half way through the dinner I had to make another batch.  They went like hotcakes.  lol  I did make 2 changes though.  I used Bisquit instead of flour, baking powder and soda since we would not use it up at the church before it went flat.  And I used applesauce instead of sugar because I forgot to buy additional sugar for the cooking.  One thing I did notice was the batter was better when it rested for a bit before making the pancakes.  My first batch rested for about an hour.  My second was used right away.  Still good though and I didn't have any left.

We are living overseas and we don't have access to our typical baking mixes. I haven't made pancakes from scratch before so I thought I'd try these - my entire family LOVED them. My only concern is that the ingredients are expensive in our new country so I may not be able to make these as often as I'd like to.

Great recipe -- but take note when it says "Truck-Stop" pancakes, because it DOES make enough for a truck stop!  Get out your biggest bowl and give it a try.  It is a great recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

My husband and I love a good pancake so I'm always on the lookout for a new recipe to try. These are by far THE BEST pancake I've ever made. I shared the recipe with my parents who heartily agree. It's a regular on our breakfast menu and can be made with purchased buttermilk or homemade. I think the batter is even better the second day.

Really good.  That's what  my family said.  Nice thick pancakes quite tasty.  Didn't have Buttermilk so used the mixture of lemon/skim mild to make it.  This recipe makes a ton of pancakes.  Roughly 30 pieces.  So you may need to scale it according to your needs.  Will be making them again.

These are called "truck-stop"" because it makes enough to feed an entire truck stop of people. They are really good. Everyone loved them.  It takes the biggest bowl in the house to make them in.

Wow these were so good!  It makes a big batch.  I poured the batter into individual zip-lock bags and froze them.  If I know I'm going to make them in advance, I thaw them in the fridge the night before.  It tastes wonderful with Nutella spread and sliced bananas.

Good pancakes.  My batter ended up to runny so I had to add more flour, but they still turned out good.

The boys had friends spend the night we made these in the morning! I just followed the recipe not realizing it was for 12 servings and they were only 4 10yr old going to eat! But they turned out great and the boys just loved them so much I did't have any leftovers!!

Hmmmm - something is missing in the flavor.  Maybe vanilla?  I scaled the recipe to 5 and it made 20 pancakes, so it makes a lot.  I guess it just wasn't as sweet as I like.  They were easy and the consistency was nice but the flavor was off somehow.

Have been making these for 7 years, they are always very good. Light and tender. Usually served at a men's breakfast, no complaints ever. The full recipe makes about 48 pancakes using a 1/4 cup ladle.

These pancakes are really good. The entire family loved them. Be warned that this recipe makes a TON of batter! I reduced the recipe to feed 4 and still had lots of leftovers. Good news is the leftovers freeze well for a speedy breakfast on a weekday.

OH MY GOODNESS!! If I could give TEN STARS,I would!  These were absolutely DIVINE! The batter seemed too thick, but before thinning, I decided to make a trst pancake.My DH gobbled it up, and exclaimed how light and fluffyand delicous it was! I scaled amounts down to 5 servings, which made 10 pacakes. I will refrigerate them and microwave each morning until they are gone! Thanks so very much!!  Incredible recipe!

Now these are some excellent pancakes! I make my own buttemilk by added a tablespoon of vinegar to my milk, let it sit for at least 5 minutes, and you are good to go! I cooked my pancakes in clarified butter, so they were crispy and golden brown on the outside and perfectly tender on the inside. This is one of the best pancake recipes I've found on this site. They don't need syrup!

This may sound like a horrible question, but is the baking soda and buttermilk neccessary? I'm living in Korea right now and I can't seem to find baking soda (only baking powder), and I don't think I've seen buttermilk anywhere...any suggestions? I would really like to make these, they sound delicious!!

When I first made these we didn't have buttermilk so I used milk and lemon juice, and they were PHENOMENAL. The lightest and fluffiest pancakes I have ever eaten, and the only pancakes I have ever liked cold and plain--they were just as good as when warm! The second time I used buttermilk and they didn't come out as nicely, but they were still amazing regardless.

Wonderful pancakes. I used half all-purpose and half whole wheat flour and they were still light and fluffy and yummy. I also made only 1/5 of the recipe and it was enough to feed my family of 4 (made 9 1/4-cup pancakes) along with a side of fruit and eggs.

I have been playing around with pancakes for sometime now.  My only complaint about this recipe is adjusting it is a little tricky.  Make sure you always use REAL buttermilk, and not milk with an acid added.  Other then that it is by far and away the best freaking pancake.

these were easy to make, although quite a large recipe. The intro suggests that the batter can be frozen? So I am trying that and will update a new review later. I gave it 4 stars because I have had better.

So, I wish we could give ½ star... I'd give this recipe a 3½.  There have been a few recipes where I stated they were good "starting points" and these pancakes definitely fall into that category.  I honestly don't see what all the hub-bub is about.  The recipe, for me, is not how pancakes should taste.  I believe it has something to do with the amount of baking powder/soda in them.  So, to try and combat that strong taste, I added cinnamon and vanilla - MUCH BETTER.  I made half plain (for me) and half with blackberry syrup (for my husband) and his came out better.  I think if you're going for a pancake to douse in fruity toppings, this could be it.  But, for pancake purists who like only a little pat of butter and syrup, not so much.  Also, I halved this recipe and still came out with about 20 pancakes!  Think I'll try a different recipe next time...

My wife didn't eat pancakes when I met her but she liked mine. For 23 years she would only eat mine. I made this recipe this morning and she kept repeating OMG these are fantastic! I guess I'll be making these instead of mine from now on. The only thing I did different was adding a little vanilla like some of the others did.

These pancakes are great! We make them at least twice a month. Sometimes I substitute about 1/2 wheat flour and they still taste wonderful! I also always add a tsp of vanilla.

I added some mashed bananas as the batter was just beginning to combine, then sprinkled blueberries into the pancakes as they were cooking (before the pancakes bubble and are flipped). Very nice.

This is one of the best pancake recipes ever! I did not have buttermilk, so I used 2 Tbsp. of white vinegar with 2c. of milk (I scaled this to 5 servings) and let it sit for about 5 mins before adding. I also added 1 Tbsp of cinnamon, 1/2 c. of raisins, and 2 tsp of vanilla. It turned out a little lumpy, but after whisking it, this turned out well. I freeze these and then use throughout the week for breakfast! Yum!

The absolute best pancake recipe ever!  If you are looking for the kind of pancake that you get at the best breakfast places, this is it. Finally!  So easy to make.  I do half all purpose and half whole wheat flour but other than that I follow the recipe exactly.  It is perfect as it is but adding a few chocolate chips makes them even more irresistable. I have also tried nutmeg and cinnamon as well. So yummy! I am the only one in my family who even puts maple syrup on them.  Everyone else eats them with only butter. This recipe makes a lot.  I halve it and it is more than enough for my hungry family with leftovers.

AMAZING pancakes. They are delicious plain or with some strawberries & whipped cream. I made the full recipe to feed 14 people and only used 1/3 of the batter. It's perfect if you want to make a huge batch and freeze the pancakes to use over time.

I haven't ever been a big pancake fan, but my kids love them so I've been on a mission to find a GREAT pancake recipe to make everyone happy. Well, after many recipes I've finally found THE BEST pancake recipe ever!! When I think of pancakes I think of thick, hard to swallow pieces of flavorless bread. These are definitely not in that category. I am now a pancake fan (well at least a fan of these pancakes)!  These are absolutely wonderful and I can't thank you enough for submitting this recipe!

It's a very good recipe eventhough I have no means of getting buttermilk in my new place of work (Saudi Arabia).    Thank you very much for posting the recipe.

This has been my staple recipe for pancakes ever since I stumbled upon it last year. It's absolutely perfect as is - although I do add a little bit of cinnamon & nutmeg. Thank you!!!

These are so delicious, loved every bite! We usually don't have pancakes around these parts, so I'm not a pancake expert, but I definitely can tell what I like or what I don't and these were fabulous. I'd tried a couple of recipes before but never got a half-decent result until now. Soft, light and fluffy, mmmmmmmm, ate breakfast twice this morning, lol. Thank you!!

I do not understand the great reviews. I followed this recipe exactly and got very bland pancakes that had an eggy texture. I will not make these again, I would have to change to much.

My favorite pancake recipe!For three people and plenty of leftovers I scaled recipe down to 2 eggs, 1/2 cup milk, 2 tablespoons butter,2 cups butter milk, 2 cups flour, 1 3/4 teaspoon baking powder, 1 teaspoon baking soda and 1 1/2 tablespoons sugar. Recipe taste like IHOP pancakes.

Excellent recipe, simple to make.  The portion size is skewed imo. I adjusted it down to 6 pancakes and it still made 18 lol. I used 2% insted of buttermilk and it turned out fine.  I like to separate my whites from the yolks and beat the whites alone till the peak, then fold them into the rest of the pancake recipe make them little fluffier.

These pancakes are so good that I don't even use syrup, just butter and fruit preserves. Peach, apricot, boysenberry, and strawberry are all excellent!

I have made pancakes for years but wanted to try buttermilk instead of plain and these are the best.  I will never go back to my old recipe these are so light and fluffy.  My whole family loved them and I followed the recipe exactly because we had company to help eat them.  Thanks for a great recipe that everyone loved.

I was a little skeptical that this would turn out.  I had no buttermilk so I had to make my own with milk and vinegar.  It worked fine and everyone enjoyed the pancakes.  Much better than a mix out of a box and I halved the recipe for my family of 5 and I still had 12 pancakes left over.  No problem, because they freeze so well.  Pop em in the microwave for a bit and the kids enjoyed pancakes in the middle of the week!

I am in awe.  I've never had homemade pancakes that were this good. I didn't have buttermilk so I used regular and they were still awesome.  I am sort of kicking myself because I didn't think of making homemade buttermilk, which isn't difficult by using either cream of tartar, lemon juice or vinegar.   I am sure they will be outstanding next time because they were amazing today! Next time just might be tomorrow! Thanks so much for this great recipe!

I altered this recipe down to 4 servings (it said 1 2/3 eggs...I just used 2) and followed everything exactly (well, not the eggs.  ha.)  I added just a dash of cinnamon at the end and these were the best pancakes EVER!  So easy, light, and fluffy.  I made them for a "breakfast dinner" last night and they were fantastic.  My household thanks you for our new pancake recipe!

So So good! I have been searching for a pancake recipe that really hits the spot and this is it! 5 stars is not enough! This amount would feed an army so be sure to adjust the serving size to meet your needs but by all means do try it.

Each "serving" makes around 4 (1/4 cup batter) pancakes.  That's a lot of pancakes!  I had to add about 1/3 a cup extra of flour for 5 servings.  Wonderful though!

I found that I was left with more pancakes than i imagined. Really scale down the recipe if you want to make 5-10 pancakes.
They were really fluffy and yummy but I wasn't too pleased with having so much batter left so I decided to freeze the remaining pancakes.

This is the best pancake recipe I've gotten off this site!  I used a smaller conversion that another reviewer posted since not everyone in my family eats pancakes. They were fluffier than some of the others I tried which is a must for me. I tend to follow recipes to a tee and this one was great!

I have never made a recipe that was rated so highly and that I disliked...until now. I absolutely love pancakes but these were just not as good as people raved about. The sugar did nothing as I still had to drown them in syrup. They were way too "eggy". I really can't pinpoint what was not good about them. They just weren't. I'll stick to Krusteez buttermilk pancakes instead. One thing I did like was that they came out really fluffy. They require too much time and effort for the poor result. By the way, this makes a whole lot of pancakes.

Exceptional flavor but this pancake recipe is a tad too heavy for my liking. I've made homemade pancakes my whole life and have relied upon one recipe for fluffy and tender pancakes.  I'll stick with it because that's what I expect from a pancake.

These turned out great.  The only thing is the recipe made so many even when I cut it in half!!  I added a few things of my own to suit my flavor cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and vanilla and almond extract. Even with out these add-ins the pancakes were wonderful!!  Fluffy and very easy to make!  Thanks!

DELICIOUS!!!  I made this recipe exactly as it is written and it was wonderful.  It makes a light and fluffy pancake that is as good, if not better than what you get when you order pancakes out.  We will be using this recipe every time we make pancakes.

I reduced the recipe thinking the 12 servings would be too much. It's not! The crew pounded down pancakes as fast as I could fry them. There was a little bit of batter left over. I cooked it up two days latter for my "Breakfast Dinner". It was even better!

I am never going back to the pancake mix in a box, these were so good! Because the recipe makes a ton of batter, I used some of the leftover for freezing pancakes. This makes for a quick fix in the morning or for a snack. I would recommend this recipe to anyone who loves pancakes. One thing I did notice was to make sure they are thoroughly cooked before flipping, they come out "fluffier" and "lighter."

these were really yummy.  I also used a tbsp of vinegar as I didn't have buttermilk and added a splash of vanilla as well.  I will definitely make them again!

Very Very good. I cook for my church every week and we usually have about 40 people and everyone loved these pancakes. I used 1.5 sticks of butter by accident and it turned out great.

These are the best pancakes I have ever ate.  I make up a big batch and take to work later in the week and feed the guys I work with.  They all love them.  If you have any buttermilk left over, use it to scramble your eggs to go with the pancakes.  It makes them tastier and fluffier than milk.

Excellent recipe!!! This is the first pancake recipe I ever tried making. I will never look for another. For those of us who like to break down a large recipe like this one here are the proportions: 0.3 cups milk and 1.2 Tbs butter per egg. Also I found that I can make big beautiful thick pancakes by using a cooking them individually in a small nonstick pan using about a 3rd cup per cake. I like to sub some whole wheat flour. I use a little extra sugar, salt and butter.

I made these this morning for breakfast and have to say I was a little disappointed.  I followed the recipe exactly and for the time and expense these just weren't worth it.  They weren't bad, it's just that they weren't great.

I was looking for a new pancake recipe and tried this one. It will be the only pancake recipe I use from now on! The pancakes turned out light and fluffy and soaked up the syrup. My husband loved them also.He's a former truck driver and yes they taste like truck stop pancakes.

These are good, but wouldn't say the best. I cut the recipe in half and made about 35 pancakes (~1/4 cup batter). Half plain and half with mini chocolate chips.

Pancakes had a nice light texture but plain was too plain and they didn't have that much flavor. Balanced well with the chocolate chips.

I scale this down to 2 servings and use 1 egg, 1c. buttermilk, and 3/4 c. flour. Very good, and it still makes several. Each serving must be a stack of pancakes! I usually throw in 1/2c. of sweet potatoes and leave out the sugar.

These fluffy pancakes are a HUGE hit at my house. I halfed the recipe using 2 eggs and added about 4 TBSP of flour to make them thicker and fluffier. AWESOME!! I've already made them twice this week! I added fresh blueberries to a couple and some mini-chocolate chips to a couple and they were good. I put the leftovers in plastic baggies and froze for easy pull out breakfast.

Excellent but too many cakes.  For about 30 pancakes, try 3 eggs, 3 cups of buttermilk and flour, 1 cup milk, 4 tablespoons of butter and 1 tablespoon each of baking poweder, baking soda and sugar.  If you like this recipe, try this one too: "Banana Pancakes I" http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Banana-Pancakes-I/Detail.aspx

The first time I made these, I made only half a batch to see how well it did.  It did do well, and kept in the refrigerator overnight for the second day.  The second time I made it, I made the entire batch.  This was good - it lasts for several days in the fridge for a stress-free fast breakfast.

This is the first recipe I have ever saved to my recipe box.  These are awesome pancakes!!!   I cut the recipe to 2 servings and had 8 beautiful pancakes.  For the buttermilk I used 2% milk with 1/8 cup white vinegar and let it sit for a few minutes.  These will become a Saturday morning regular!

Absolutely THE best pancakes I have ever had.  My husband; who never really pays a compliment to anything cooked actually said these were the BEST!!!  
They are truly like little soft fluffy pillows of love.  I cant help but eat at least 3 of these everytime I have made them.  
WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL.  
The only change I did was instead of butter I used Smart Balance and splenda in place of the sugar.  Never missed them.  LOVE THESE!!!!

These are very good and fluffy. I made the first batch while batter was fresh. I also tested the author's assertion that you can refrigerate the batter for a day or two and use it. The fresh batch cooked up very nicely. I think this is my fault but I found that the middles were underdone. That could be me taking them off the fire too soon though. I am not pancake talented normally. With that being said my husband complimented me on them and ate his whole serving. 

I made the second batch after 1 1/2 days in the fridge. I found that the batter discolored it had grey streaks in it. It didn't smell so I pressed on. After stirring it well the color returned to normal and the cakes cooked up well though again I probably took them off the fire too soon because the middles were underdone. Overall though I think I will keep this recipe and try to improve my skills.

I usually don't write reviews but seeing all the good reviews for this recipe I had to write my own.  I followed the directions and ingredients exactly, and my pancakes came out thin and rubbery.  My family liked them ok, but they weren't my usual light and fluffy pancakes.  There weren't any requests for seconds like usual.  I did go back and look at the earlier reviews and saw a few that also said that they came out rubbery.  I would avoid this recipe if light and fluffy is what you are looking for.

I made these Easter morning & got rave reviews!  I made 2/5 of the recipe and it was PLENTY for 6 adults & 2 toddlers (along with eggs, sausage, and bacon).  If you make this recipe as is, you will have enough to feed 20!  But the pancakes were absolutely delicious.  I will definitely be saving this as my "pancake recipe".

These are excellent. I pre-portion the dry ingredients before I go camping, and then add the wet ingredients as needed to make fresh pancakes at the campsite.

WOW! These are great. The recipe does make enough for an army though. I freezed the extra. Everyone in my house loved these. This is going to be my GO TO pancake recipe for now on. The pancackes were light and fluffy. They had a sweet buttery taste. We barely used syrup because their great flavor.

Next month I am going to try and add banana or blueberry to the recipe. I hope we will have eaten all the extra by then. =p

I have made these pancakes for a couple of weekends in a row.  They are the BEST!!!  I use 1tbs of vinegar and milk to substitute for butter milk.  My only caution is to aware of how much milk you need.  I use far less buttermilk than the recipe calls for.

I quartered the recipe since it was just me. I didn't have buttermilk so I used 2/3c sour cream, 1 1/3c milk, and 1 1/2TB cider vinegar as a substitute.

Even with the substitutions, they were very good. I will make these again.

Absolutely, hands down, the very BEST recipe I've ever found for pancakes. Well, the name says it all! I found them to be just the right thickness and fluffiness and next time will be adding fresh blueberries too. Two things to note: if you don't use cooking spray (and instead cook directly on a teflon pan) your pacakes will have a smoother texture and 'prettier' look to them. Also, be aware that this recipe makes generous portions. I scaled it to half (6 servings) and it made enough for 8 people to have 3 medium pancakes each. I like to put the leftovers in the freezer for use another day - just reheat them in the toaster or toaster oven and they're just as good as fresh.

My family LOVES these!  I make my own blueberry syrup and we have even added chocolate chips to them, DELISH!  Try these, you will not be disappointed.  Oh, make sure you change the servings to 5 or you will have enough pancakes for a truck stop full of people!!

These pancakes were very good. I didn't have buttermilk, so I added vinegar to regular milk, (1 Tbsp. per cup of milk replacing buttermilk). After tasting the pancakes, I realized that some of the other reviewers were correct....they were a bit bland. So, I added a little more sugar, and I added the salt, which I originally omitted. This really made a difference! Over all, a good recipe....just needed a little tweaking :0).

These are really quite good.  I try and make them every few weeks for the kid's before school.  My only addition is cinnamon and a dash of vanilla.

These are SO GOOD!  My husband LOVES pancakes and would eat them every Saturday and Sunday if I would make them, but I'm not that big a fan, normally.  I don't usually care for the texture - too dry or "packy", but the texture of these is unbelievable.  Very fluffy and tender - they really do melt in your mouth.

One tip - I assembled these the night before, keeping my wet and dry ingredients separate until I was ready to cook them.  This kept prep time to a minimum and would make them doable even on week-days.

Thanks for a GREAT recipe!

I had higher expectations for these. But I think I'll try again because I added apples to the recipe, and it changed the consistency. They still turned out good, just not what I had hoped for.

Perfect! I've been searching fervently for the perfect pancakes, and these are IT! I messed with the temperature on my griddle, as mine doesn't have a "medium" setting, but rather shows the temperatures settings.  I found that 350 was perfect as it made the cakes puffier, without getting them too dark too fast.  MMM MMM GOOD!

These were great - I added vanilla to the liquids like some suggested. To have a reasonable amount I just use the 2 of everything rule.

These were delicious -  I cut this recipe in half for my family and it still made a lot ! Also, I used a mix of 1/2 oatbran flour and 1/2 white flour and they were very tasty.

i kind of liked these pancakes, but my family didn't.  they turned out too eggy (like another reviewer mentioned), soggy, and thin.  i guess i could eat them not because they tasted like pancakes, but because it was almost like eating a mild-flavored omlette.

Love, LOVE, LOVE this recipe.  These are probably the best pancake recipe I have tried on this site thus far.  Didn't use syrup...instead used fruit preserves and it was delicious.  Can't wait to make for my father-in-law.  He is a truck driver and I am sure he would love these.  Thanks for the post.

I think this is a great recipe. I am one of those cooks that avoids pre bought mixes, such as pancake mixes. I was really pleased to have found this recipe. We add mini chocolate chips to these already delicious pancakes, and WOW, did we stumble upon a winner. Thanks for this great recipe.

Made these pancakes over the weekend and they were wonderful!  I've tried other home-made pancake recipes in the past, but these were the best we've had.  The whole family loved them.  I didn't have any buttermilk on hand, so I added vinegar to my milk and let it sit about 5-10 minutes and it turned out great!

2 thumbs up!!  The best pancakes I've ever tasted, and they were delicious even though this is the first time I've made them.  Thanks for posting the recipe, bobobearzoe.  I like that you can refrigerate excess batter for a few days.  The pancakes themselves are fluffy and full of flavour without being too heavy or thin textured.  Just right for me.

I modified the recipe slightly with imput from prior reviewers.  I scaled the recipe to 4.8 - and there was still enough batter for at least 12 pancaked.  I added 1/4 teaspoon vanilla as I was having the pancakes with maple syrup, blueberries and ice cream.  

I didn't have buttermilk on hand so made my own with 2 cups of skim milk and 2 tablespoons of freshly squeezed lemon juice.  This was perfect for the 4.8 scaled version of the recipe, I then added another 1/2 cup skim milk.

I didn't have to add anymore flour or liquid beyond what was in the original recipe.  

This is a keeper and the perfect cafe style breakfast at home!

THESE ARE MAJOR FANTASTIC!!!  It's time to grocery shop at my house & I had run out of my pancake mix. I never have buttermilk..used the 2 Tablespoons (1 per cup) of lemon juice to make the Buttermilk.  I scaled the recipe down to 5 (Before I saw the 4.8 & to use the only 2 eggs I had left) and I have TONS of batter left.  (Almost 3 cups!)  I have a family of 4.  Everyone raved about the pancakes..I forgot to add the vanilla that was suggested, and added an extra 1/4 cup of flour (I use King Arthur White Whole Wheat flour) and I should have added more..still too thin for me.  I could only cook one in my skillet at a time.  This was the first time making scratch pancakes..WILL DO IT AGAIN!!!!  Thanks oodles, Bobobear!!

Ahhh... These are absolutely AMAZING!  I kept playing with the recipe to get it down to just 1 egg, which is all I had.  Finally found that magic number.  These are the best pancakes I have ever made at home!  This recipe is definitely a keeper!  I am going to give the orginal recipe to my husband to take to the fire station with him - the guys will love these!  Thank you!

Wish I could give this 3.5 stars...rounded to 4.  It was ok, but nothing special.  I scaled to 5 servings, and it ended up really liquid-y.  I had to add 6 extra tablespoons of flour before it became at all batter-like, and it was still thin.  I wonder if that was a problem with the conversion feature rather than the full recipe, though.  The taste was ok, kind of plain and not quite sweet enough for my taste.  I added chocolate chips to later batches and that helped.  Thanks for the recipe, but I think I'll keep searching.

Even after forgetting to add the melted butter (left it in the microwave...), these still turned out great.  Using 1/4C scoops, the batter spreads to make big saucer-sized pancakes.  I scaled the recipe down to 4.8 (thanks for that tip!) and I still had enough to freeze for 4 more servings.  Thanks for the post!

Flippin good!  The best pancakes ever.  I didn't have buttermilk so I added lemon juice to the milk for a substitution-still turned out great.  I also halfed the recipe, and it was still way to much for my family.  It'll be nice to have them again in a couple of days! ; )

These were a wonderfull change to pancakes from a box! I used the 4.8 servings as suggested. I also added 2 tbsp of vanilla, a ton of cinnomon and used lemon juice and milk for buttermilk. They were a little flat and dense but I may have overmixed. Overall, FANTASTIC!

This was the first time I've ever made pancakes fom scratch...for some reason I just never really bothered doing it before but boy am I glad I did!!!  As per others' advice I added 1 tsp of vanilla extract and then some fresh blueberries to top it off.  I didn't have any buttermilk so I added 1 tsp of vinegar per cup of regular milk. Also, I scaled it to 4.8 servings (like another reviewer) and it was more than enough for 4 adults.  YUMMY!!

These were very good. We scaled the recipe down and used the milk + vinegar since we didn't have buttermilk. I still think that Good Old Fashioned Pancakes on this site is a bit better, but this was scarfed down nonetheless!! Thank you.

Good flavor and pretty easy prep.  I agree with the reviewers who suggest adding vanilla. A bit heavy for my taste -- would like to try again with just egg whites to see if that makes for a slightly lighter pancake.

Well worth the trouble.  I made them ahead and froze them, then nuked them in the microwave for a quick and easy breakfast.  I added a little vanilla for flavor and it worked out just fine.  I also fried the bacon ahead of time also and froze it as well, made breakfast really fast and really easy.

These pancakes came out great! I scaled it down to 4.8 and then added fresh Blueberries to each as it was cooking on the skillet for an extra treat!  Yum! I will definetly make again, even if I don't have Blueberries on hand.

Good pancakes. I scaled down to 4.8 servings and made plenty for our family of 4. I personally love buttermilk pancakes, I think these need something. Maybe some cinnamon and vanilla? Not sure they weren't as special as I thought they'd be. Because they made so many I let the kids choose what they wanted, made some plain, some with frozen blueberries (that we froze after picking last summer) and some more with chocolate chips. All good.

These pancakes were good.  The only change I'll make is to add a little vanilla to the batter, but otherwise, they were great!  I made them last Sunday and froze the leftover batter, so that we can enjoy them this Sunday morning too!  Thanks for the recipe!

These were great!  Very melt in your mouth.  I scaled down to a serving size of 6 and it fed 4 small children and 1 adult with batter in the fridge for tomorrow.  However, I served them with strawberries too!

Very melt-in-your-mouth-good pancakes.  They were nice and fluffy but not quite as thick as I like.  I did scale down the recipe and it's quite possible this was the reason.  I'll have to make some adjustments next time with my scaled down version because there is no way we could ever eat a full batch, our 5 servings were more than enough!  All in all, 5 star recipe for great flavor and all around approval from my tasters!

I love these pancakes!  The kids think they’re the best too which is a double win!!  I made an excessive amount of batter and put it into an old creamer bottle so as a single Dad with 3 children to get ready for school I can make pancakes and have very little mess and very happy children!

This recipe made very light fluffy pancakes when I started.  I cooked about half, sat down to eat some, then went back to the batter to cook the other half and the batter had "gone flat" so to speak. The second half of the batch produced pancakes which were much thinner than the first pancakes. I would reduce the salt a bit, the large amount of baking soda seems to make the pancakes taste a bit salty.

This is a wonderful recipe. I’ve been searching for a recipe that would recreate both the flavor and the porous surface texture of diner pancakes for a long time, and this is the first recipe to actually achieve both! I made it as written, no changes except to reduce the portions to a 3/3/3 portion rather than the 5/5/5 it starts out as, since I was only feeding 4 people. My  one complaint is that they do have a very, very moist interior texture even when fully cooked; I may do a bit of experimentation on my own time to see if I can get them slightly drier, but if that means sacrificing the rest of these pancakes’ good qualities, then I’ll still be very happy continuing to use the recipe as written.

Made breakfast for my co-workers ! They were over the moon for them.. they wanted to  know when I'd make them again ? I let let sit over nite in refrigerator... I heard that suggestion on Home & Family ... a chef said they should be left to rise like bread _ buttermilk+ soda  need to activate for fluffier pancakes!

My husband liked these very much....and he is used to very good pancakes from his mother, so that was high praise! The batter was very thick so I did add a little more buttermilk. I'm not a huge fan of pancakes in general, but these were very tasty. My daughter liked them too and I've added them to my "favorites" file. I cut the recipe down considerably since we are a small family. I still have some batter left for another breakfast. Thanks for the recipe.

Very good. I only added 4C buttermilk because that's all I had and still turned out fine. Stir until just combined and let sit for a bit. Batter gets light and airy so resist the temptation to stir again. Makes a huge pile of pancakes. Fed 7 adults easily with many still leftover. Everyone said they were delicious but I think next time I'll add some vanilla.

Really good pancakes (consensus from the family) but when I store the extra in the fridge even for 1 day it turns blue/grey.  Has anyone else seen this?
UPDATE -- I looked this up elsewhere and found it's due to oxidation.  It doesn't spoil the batter but there's an ewww factor.  Recommendations are to cook all the batter when you make it or store it with no air contact such as a zipper top plastic bag with all air squeezed out or a layer of plastic wrap directly on the batter in a covered bowl.  Upgrading from 4 to 5 stars!

This recipe makes the best flap jacks ever. Lightly crisp and light and fluffy. Everyone loved them.

I made two minor changes. I reduced the amount by 3/5ths. In other words, for every ingredient that was listed as 5, I used 3. For the milk I used slightly less than a cup (aiming at 9/10 c) and for the butter, 3 2/5 tbs (I just eyeballed it). I used a small pinch of salt and I added a tsp of vanilla extract like others had suggested.  

Absolutely delicious.

I made this batter as pancakes AND waffles, and both came out delicious.  I didn't change a thing.  I also made some with gluten free flour and about 1 TBSP of Xantham Gum...also delicious.

Definitely have more milk/buttermilk read if you use all the flour prescribed.  Nicely sized using 1/4 cup measure. Will freeze the batch to use for breakfasts. If you are in hurry at home, make and freeze this recipe and combine it with the batch bake bacon one for quick breakfast fixed.

I guess my husband and I are in the small minority that did not care for this receipe.  I used the exact ingredients, but halved it.  It turns out that we are not buttermilk fans, plus the cakes were not light and fluffy.  Will not try again.

my hubs is a truck driver, so I figured he'd appreciate these.  only the best pancakes I've ever had!! 
helpful hint: only use egg whites for a fluffier, lighter pancake. I would've taken a pik, but they didn't last long enough.

The only changes I made to this recipe is scaling it, depending on how many I'm cooking for. The original recipe makes a ton of large pancakes. These are some of the best pancakes you will ever eat!

I substituted gluten free Bob's Red Mill all purpose baking flour  and even my son said "Mom, these are the best pancakes ever!" These are even amazing with 2 teaspoons of vanilla and ground flaxseed.

My family loved this recipe!  The pancakes were fluffy and delicious.  The recipe, as written (12 servings), makes a LOT of batter.  Keep this in mind if you are used to the small servings in prepared pancake mixes.

These are delicious.   They are worth the extra effort to put together while forgoing the boxed mix.  Have made them now 2 or 3 times for my husband and son and overnight guest.

Made both plain and some with blueberries (thoroughly dried and added a little at  time just before putting on the griddle so it didnt water down the batter) and both turned out delicious! Was having troubles with allrecipie converting to a smaller batch but the recipe was simple enough to adjust on my own.

It's super easy and yummy however you can also put a chocolate syrup or some cream over the top gonna work better than normal syrup, but I always love Pancakes anyways.

Best pancake recipe I've ever made! Followed the recipe exactly as it stated and it was wonderful! Next time the only thing I would add is a little splash of vanilla extract.

My family loved these pancakes! I did cut the recipe in half because I was only feeding four people but you could easily feed a family of six. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla extract and a few blue berries to  A portion of the batter for my daughter's pancakes.  I would definitely make these pancakes again!!!

Made these for a community breakfast serving over 100 people  to rave reviews.  Used full fat buttermilk for a nice rich flavorful pancake and offered them with blueberry sauce as an alternative to "maple" syrup.  Recipe is generous and yields 3-4 5 " pancakes per serving.

Just tried these for Breakfast this past Saturday....and they were excellent.....So light, fluffy and delicious.  We love buttermilk pancakes but always followed a recipe from an old GOODHOUSEKEEPING Cookbook from 1957..they too are delicious but take so much longer to put together i.e. you had to separate the eggs and whip the whites separately then fold into the batter.  After trying this recipe, I am switching over from my old reliable recipe.  My one bit of advice would be don't over mix the batter to achieve a nice fluffy pancake and I always sift my dry ingredients.  Thanks again for sharing

According to my husband "these are the best pancakes I have ever eaten."  Easy to make, delicious, light and fluffy. He said to be sure and keep this recipe!  Made blueberry syrup and raspberry sauce to pour over.  Wonderful breakfast. No additions, subtractions or substitutions. Great recipe as it stands.  Thanks for sharing!

I have now stopped looking for the perfect pancake recipe. This recipe is by far the best, and I have tried many.  I did add one tsp of vanilla because I love the taste of vanilla in my pancakes.  Other than that, it would have been fantastic even without the addition. Five stars +

Good basic recipe. I will have to make some adjustments for high altitude. My first attempt netted good flavor, but not as fluffy as they should have been.

In my life I don't think I've tasted a better pancake. The recipe was enough to feed a football team, so for every ingredient that called for 5, I used 2, with milk reduced to 1/2 C plus 2 T; and 2.4 T melted butter. It made twenty-two 4" pancakes. I took the advice of another reader and froze and put into a bread bag. Truly amazing pancakes that melt in your mouth!

I didn't make the full recipe. I made 2 cups of flour & ajusted accordingly.  They came out good, but next time I would add a tad more sugar. That might be because I added blueberries to it,  I'll make it with raspberries  next time. I probably won't  need  much sugar then because they are a sweeter berry. Thanks for  the recipe.

Good recipe.  I can't stand pancakes from a mix, so I make them only from scratch.   Nice to have the math already done for a large quantity.

I have made these pancakes for a couple of years now and there are a few tricks that make them foolproof.  Don't let the batter sit to long before you use it. When the batter looks puffy its ready it usually take about 3 to 5 minutes.  Fry them quickly, I usually use to pans to make it go quickly.  The baking powder and buttermilk are what gives then their lift and tender crumb, but it stops working rather quickly. Leave them out to cool and dry a little before you freeze them, I reheat them in a toaster oven and they come out a little crispy around the edges, but we like them like that.

I added a sprinkling of salt into batter!  It needs salt -- all batters like this need salt.  Also, a pancake trick.  Add a sprinkling of nutmeg to the batter.  Really special.  Steve mentions freezing leftovers.  I made Sharon's recommendation for three and for the two of us, X 2 pancakes, huge quantities left over.  How to freeze?
Also, it thickens as it sets.  But I did add 2 T more flour.  Left some lumps in the batter and this is awesome, light, and fluffy.  Spread batter after dolloping 1/4 cup on hot griddle.  I also did no use as much baking powder.  Divided by 3, equally and the same with soda.
***Just read how to freeze; use freezer plastic bags, can divide using smaller bags.  Roll into cone shape to release air, seal and freeze.  Thaw when ready to use.  Snip corner of bag and squeeze onto hot griddle.!

This recipe is ok but it needs item to make it really good:  add a teaspoon of vanilla per egg .  I put a little butter on my griddle, add my batter and let them cook.  I use an electric griddle set at about 360.  Let them take their time and serve with more butter and warm maple syrup.,    YUM!!!  I make 1/5 of this recipe for my wife and myself.

I prefer recipes that I can make on the spot because I have all the ingredients on hand - don't usually have buttermilk, but will say they give pancakes a great flavor.  Here's something else I always put in the batter - a few splashes of a carbonated beverage - ginger ale, soda water - makes pancakes extra fluffy!

These Pancakes are delicious! Unlike most of the ratings I made the full recipe for a family of five. This recipe serves of 12 people 2-3 pancakes each with enough left over to put it  the freezer for another day. Made 36 pancakes in all and the family loves that there is some in the freezer for those busy mornings. Win-Win!!

Found this recipe the other day and these are pretty great pancakes! Very moist and quite fluffy. Next time, I think I'll try to add some fruit as toppings, but syrup and/or toppings aren't really necessary as they taste great alone.

Whenever I have some buttermilk around, this will be my go-to pancake recipe!

Best pancakes every time!  
I make it with gluten free flour mix (a full cup for cup substitution) and it's still wonderful.

I reduced the recipe to make 6-8 pancakes:
1 egg
1c flour
1c buttermilk
3/8 c milk
1t baking powder
1t baking soda
1/2T sugar
1 and a little bit T butter
Pinch salt

Really good, nice n fluffy.  This recipes makes A LOT of pancakes (well more than 12 & that's using a ladle for the batter.  For me, the true test is if I can eat them without syrup and I can!!!! Def a keeper!

Fluffy and yummy. I don't use Buttermilk often so I always make a substitute. 1TBSP of vinegar and enough milk to add up to a cup. Let sit for at least 5 minutes to react. I also let mix sit for 5 minutes before putting on hot griddle.

These were the best homemade pancakes I have ever had.  They may be the best pancakes I have ever had.  My husband is picky about pancakes and I have been trying lots of recipes over the years (after years of trying all the box mixes and not knowing how easy pancakes actually are!).  I made the full amount which was too much for one dinner for 5 of us, but the batter stayed well in the fridge until this morning, and we are all enjoying a delicious Saturday morning treat.  I made no changes!  This will be my go-to pancake recipe from now on.

My husband and I have been searching for the perfect pancake recipe for a while now, and this one hit the spot! These pancakes are not too puffy, so if you like inch-thick pancakes these are not the ones for you. A light hand with the mixing and a dash of vanilla added to the wet ingredients made ours tender and delicious. I scaled down the ingredients: wherever it called for 5 (cups/tsp/eggs), I used 2, and I used 2/3 cup milk and 2 1/2 tablespoons of melted butter. I also let the batter rest on the counter for a while and let it get all nice and bubbly. We will be making these often!

My husband loved these!  I scaled the recipe back to use 2 eggs only,  & next time, I would cut back a bit on the baking soda  as I could taste it in the pancake.  The consistency was light & fluffy.

This is my go-to recipe for pancakes on Sundays with family. Everyone always wants the recipe and my dad and brother always request seconds. I change the measurements to 5 servings I think, and it always makes enough for 4 people.

Made these again using the scaled down recipe that fellow reviewer ZombieQueen provided.  Used 1/4 cup of batter and made 12 pancakes...perfect for 3 people with 6 left overs to freeze.

What can I say that hasn't already been said?  I halved the recipe (used 2 eggs and 1 egg white), substituted canola oil for the melted butter, and added 1/2 tsp. of salt.  Delicious!  Be sure to let the batter  sit for a few minutes while you heat up the grill.

I made these as written and was very disappointed, especially since the batch was so large. The consistency wasn't good and they were almost tasteless. I don't recommend and wouldn't make again.

I add a bit more flour.  The first time I made these pancakes was in 2009.  It is my recipe staple for homemade pancakes.   These are delicious and plenty for leftovers.

The best pancakes I ever made. My kids said they were the first pancakes that were so good that you didn't have to add butter or syrup.  I followed the directions and divided by 1/2 until I realized I didnt' have enough powdered buttermilk.  I make the homemade version with lemon juice, but I wasn't happy with the results, so I added white vinegar to the mix.  Since I had added more acid, I added approx. another tbsp sugar.  I added 3/4 tsp of salt to the dry ing. per another recommendation.  After it was mixed and sat for approx. 10 min. I did have to add approx 1/2 c more flour to make the proper consistency.  These comments are more for me or anyone else that gets stuck.  I hate when people change a recipe and rate it, but I feel I kept pretty true to this recipe.  I will make it again with buttermilk next time!

Didn't care for this recipe hubby thought it tasted weird, made it accordingly for 5 servings, eh, then added vanilla, then more sugar nothing worked to make these taste better. Not sure what went wrong, not a keeper. Sorry.

These are absolutely the best pancakes.  I printed this recipe out and taped it inside my cooking closet so I always know where to find it.  I make the original recipe without any changes and store them in container in the refrigerator and freezer.  There are only two of us so it  takes awhile to eat this many pancakes and NO I won't change the recipe to make fewer pancakes.  That might not really work out.
Thanks for this and all your recipes.    Carole

I give these 5 stars because of the texture...they were perfect, fluffy pancakes!  I would however add a little more sugar next time to sweeten them up a bit more!  I like to eat them hot off the griddle with some butter and I tasted mostly the buttermilk (not sweet enough to eat without syrup!)  I also added vanilla, which I always do for pancakes.  I cut the recipe in half and it still made a huge batch!  Overall I thought it was a good recipe but would tweak it a tad next time (a little less buttermilk, a little more sugar!)

This was excellent-the whole family loved them. I added a dash of vanilla and almond extract and about 1/2 a cup of extra flour to ours. Made some plain and some with blueberries-came out great both ways. This is my new go to pancake recipe.

Great panackes!  They turned out perfectly brown and good!  I used lemon juice milk to make the buttermilk and loved them.  They weren't real thick pancakes which is usually my preference but very good!

I was very disappointed in these pancakes.  After reading many of the reviews, I was really excited to try them, looking forward to fluffy, warm pancakes.  Instead I got thin, bland, tasteless pancakes.  I don't know how anyone could think these were better than IHOP.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I didn't scale the recipe down and no one was interested in eating any more that what I cooked.  I'll keep looking for a better recipe and use boxed mix in the meantime.

I have made so many different pancakes with all of them tasting the same=hum-drum.  But not this one--absolutely delicious and very easy to make.  Didn't have buttermilk so I had to make my own but I can only imagine how much more delicious these would be with real buttermilk.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I had to scale this recipe way down because I'm not feeding an army and I'm glad I did because I wouldn't have wanted to save the additional batter. These were rubbery, thin and tasteless. I'm not sure if I did something wrong or if this was because of the scaled down measurements?! Anyhow, I don't think I'll try again.

These were very easy to make and delicious, too! My kids loved them, and ate TONS! Even with a family of 6 we had enough to make some for the family 2 days later. A+ Will definitely make it again!

This is an amazing recipe and yields quite a bit of batter but is surely worth it.

Awesome pancakes!  I make these about once a week, but I decrease the recommended servings to 3.  I then have to somewhat approximate some ingredients, but by doing so, it makes about 18-20 pancakes...plenty for me, my husband and son.

I love this recipe and it has become a family favorite at my house.  I did cut the portion down to 4 servings and it still makes about 30 pancakes which is more than plenty for my family of 5.  The only thing I do differently is I add a teaspoon of vanilla.  That is just a personal preference. These pancakes are perfect as is.

I make these pancakes often.  Family and friends constantly ask if I can make them a batch.  The only thing I added to the recipe was 1 tablespoon of Vanilla extract.   Please note: this recipe makes more than 12 servings.  Put the leftovers in a freezer bag.  When heating up frozen pancakes put them in the toaster.  They are still light & fluffy and flavorable.

Made this recipe for 'breakfast for dinner' last night and followed all instructions to the T. My pancakes were  absolutely delicious but flat as, well, flat as pancakes...but I wanted fluffy pancakes! I will definitely try again, maybe after reading a few more reviews.

These were really good, but I might use one less egg next time.  This recipe makes A LOT, but you can freeze them (let them cool first) and heat them for a quick breakfast (great if you have kids).  I would definitely recommend this recipe, Yummy!

I wish I could give this recipe another 1/2 star. it was easy to make (after buying some buttermilk.) And quite inexpensive. I followed the recipe exact but scaled to 5 servings. The texture was perfect. My problem was the flavor. There wasn't any.

Excellent!  I have made these many times before, but don't always have buttermilk on hand.  My latest adventure has been making my own yogurt.  I was looking for ways to use the whey.  Someone suggested whey as a substitute for buttermilk, so I tried it.  I had to add a bit more flour, but it worked perfectly and no one noticed the difference.

This was by far the very best pancake I have ever eaten. I made them with chocolate chips for the kids and put crushed pecans in mine. My kids raved about how fluffy they were. I did not mix them very much so they were big and lite. Great recipe. Thank you for sharing!

This recipe, as written is excellent! The first time I made these pancakes I added more sugar and some vanilla extract, which was a mistake because they turned out very sweet. (almost tasted more like a sugar cookie than a pancake)  Second time around, I made them using only the ingredients the recipe called for, perfect! We did have the scale the recipe down to 5 servings.

My son told me while eating these that I had to rate them 5 stars.  I scaled it to 5 because that gave me 2 eggs.  I didn't have actual buttermilk, but I do keep buttermilk powder on hand so that is what I used.   Oops, I'm just noticing that I actually forgot to add the melted butter.  They were still excellent.

Well, I must've done something silly, because this recipe (sized to 4 servings) made crepes! I had to add a bunch more flour to get it to puff up, but both styles were very delicious. I'll try this again sized maybe to 6, perhaps sizing it to 4 was the problem. We ate the crepe-style ones rolled up around some strawberry cream cheese from a tub and enjoyed them very much! Served the rest with some leftover blueberry pie filling, very tasty!

WOW, is all I can say!  Okay, I can say some more!  I too didn't have buttermilk on hand so I used plain yoghurt mixed 50/50 with 1% milk, turned out GREAT!  I also subbed in about 70% WW flour, the rest white flour, still terrific!!  These were the only changes I made, & my family said they were the best pancakes they had ever had, & I have to agree!  Thanks for a lovely lovely recipe, I will be sharing with my FB group!

Ok pancakes. The first few was ok, not very fluffy. The rest of the mix the pancakes came out dense and tuff.

The whole family loves these pancakes.  they are light and yummy. This is a very large batch of pancakes.  For my family of 5 I cut the recipe in half and still have a few left over.

Awesome pancakes!  I was expecting them to be kind of dense like diner pancakes, but they were light & delicious.  And they had such a fantastic flavor!  I made them for a large family breakfast and everyone was raving about them.  On a side note, this recipe makes a TON!  I had enough pancakes for 4 adults and 3 kids (and some of us pigged out!), and I still had about 12 or so pancakes left over to freeze for quick weekday breakfasts.  I will definitely be making them again!

Love these pancakes!!! It definitely makes enough for a truck stop.  I only have two men (DH and son) to cook for so I scaled the recipe to 8 servings and ended up with 8 cups of batter.  To use the leftovers, I spread them with butter, sprinkled with cinnamon sugar and rolled up for snacks.  Very good warm or cold.  Prefer buttermilk to the milk/lemon juice substitution.  Best pancakes we ever had!

The BEST pancakes I have ever made!  I long for diner pancakes, and have never yet found a recipe or pre-made mix which gives me what I crave!  I, also, was lacking buttermilk, so used lemon juice and milk instead.  I added a bit of vanilla as well and they were great.  It was a little trying to scale it down for 2, but I managed in the end!  GREAT RECIPE!

With this recipe, you could never failled! I used less fat milk and lemon instead of buttermilk and add also a tablespoon of flour. They were fluffy and delicious like always.

This is my standard.  I've cut it down to 3 servings and memorized everything at one of each -- one egg, one c. flour, etc.  My kids ask for these weekly -- just perfect!

My kids and I loved these.  I was even able to sneak in 1 cup of whole wheat flour and the little people did not notice.  This makes a big batch of pancakes, which is great for us.  I just freeze them and heat them up for breakfast on school days.  Thanks so much for this recipe.

I took this recipe to a family reunion camping weekend and it was a hit. I mixed all the dry ingredients into a zip-loc at home.  Saturday morning I mixed up the wet in a big bowl and added the dry.  My honey cooked them on a campstove grill to a golden brown.  Everyone loved them and wanted the recipe.

I had tried another pancake recipe here but I wanted to try another one, so I tried this one and it is now my favorite pancake recipe. It's so moist and flavorful and the texture was just perfect. I didn't have buttermilk but per Loralie's instructions, I used lemon juice and it seemed to have worked. I can't wait to serve this to others and get their feedback on it.

This is THE recipe for pancakes! Although the batter was a bit too runny for my taste, the flavor was excellent! Delicious! The only change was that I did not have buttermilk and so mixed 2TBL vinegar with 2 cups of milk. I had this scaled down to 2c flour, 2c milk, etc., and had left overs! Next time, I think I will cut down the milk a little bit. Served this with a dolldrop of whipped cream, cut bananas, and grapes, drizzled with a little bit of syrup. Excellent! Even the non-pancake lovers admitted that this is delicious! Will definitely make again. Thanks for the great recipe.

These are wonderful!  A little more work to put together then some other recipes I've used, but well worth it.  We used fresh mountain blueberries in ours, and my husband ate several more than usual, but said they'd be just as good without the berries.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I've tried making these a few different times (One using vinegar & milk for buttermilk substitute that didn't work out and one following the recipe exactly). These pancakes always turn out extremely bland. The look, fluffiness and feel of the pancakes are perfect but the taste isn't good at all.

I always made different type of homemade pancakes and this is the best one yet...I have three boys in my house and loves it...I made such a big batch that I freeze them so that if they want pancake for breakfast or a snack, I just pop them in the toaster over...and voila!!! Great for camping too cause its ready made...so make a big batch, freeze some in few freezer ziplock bags for breakfast...

Absolutely divine! I halved the recipe and still had enough to make leftovers. Will freeze extra pancakes and serve as needed to kids. YUMMY!!! Wish I could give it more than 5 stars.

These pancakes are THE fluffiest, most delicious pancakes i have ever had!  Im a pancake lover and so is my husband and when i made these pancakes this morning, i knew they were different from my usual just by the way they cooked up nice and fluffy looking.  This will definitely be my go-to pancake recipe from now on.  OH and i even used all wheat flour and you know how stiff wheat pancakes tend to look and mine were just as fluffy as the pic shown above!

I have made pancakes for years, but had never tried the buttermilk variety. These have now become a weekend staple for our family. They are, in a word, PERFECT. They are also very simple to make. I sized the recipe to feed 6, and one quart of buttermilk makes two batches.

Followed recipe exactly. I made little pancakes, but next time I will make them bigger. They were very soft and tasty. I wish they fluffed up a little more.

These were a hit at the function where I made them. I used 1/2 whole wheat flour to make it a bit healthier.

This is the best pancake recipe that I have tried!   I have used this recipe as a base, and added a variety of ingredients to it to make it healthier.  First, 2/3 of the flour i used was whole wheat.  Second, i added some ground flax seed - i scaled this recipe by half and added 1/2  of flax seed. I think i might try doing this with wheat germ sometime, too.  Last, i added blueberries.  Absolutely delicious!

The rating is for the texture of this recipe--right on target--light and fluffy!  I added wheat germ to the batter and while cooking I sprinkled on more wheat germ and then blueberries.

I have made these a few times now and they are the best pancakes I've ever had.  The last time I made these I forgot the baking soda which any baker knows is a bad thing...the pancakes turn out too dense and not light and fluffy.  Just remember the essentials baking soda and powder.

Love pancakes - This is a great recipe. I added a few tsps of vanilla extract a few more tablespoons of suger.  To make it the pancakes incredible add cinnamon - enough so that you can taste it in the batter.  Try it! and let me know how you like it.

Delicious! Here are the healthy options I did: Whole Wheat Flour, applesauce instead of butter, instead of buttermilk I used skim milk mixed with vinegar. But don't cut the sugar at all or the taste is ruined. And I added a little bit of vanilla extract to sweeten it up of course. I was worried that doing all these things would totally ruin it, but they didn't!

I tried this recipe reduced to 2 1/2 eggs and I have to say the taste was great. I did add a tsp of vanilla. However, I had big problems with texture, consistency. My mix was lumpy and it wasn't because I cooked the eggs. I used lemon juice and milk for a sub for buttermilk, let the mix sit for 10 mins and it started to curdle, well it kind of curdled everything. I had to strain it, but then the mix was far too runny and made crepes. I added about 1 1/2 cups of more flour and whisked it in and it was better. By that stage I couldn't care less about the lumps but they didn't make that much of a difference. I will try this recipe with real buttermilk and update. UPDATE: I'm changing my rating from 4* to 2*. That might seem a bit harsh, but I am really disappointed with this recipe. I used commercial buttermilk this time in the hopes that this would make the recipe better. It is just as lumpy and weird to work with. Homemade buttermilk makes no difference. I didn't strain it, and didn't add any vanilla and the taste was bland.(more like the orig recipe) I can taste the lumps in the mix as little hard bits of flour and on your plate the pancake is lumpy. Why would you want lumps in your pancakes?

These were very fluffy. I used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose, and they tasted healthier but they were still a yummy treat. (Especially with pure maple syrup.)

These pancakes are unbelievably good! This recipe makes a TON of pancakes, though. My husband and I made the 3-cup reduced recipe someone else recommended and we still made four meals out of it while eating 8 pancakes between us at a time! Thanks so much for the recipe.

I decided to make these this morning for my family. I followed the recipe, with the exception of the buttermilk. I didn't have fresh so I used powdered. Overall they were yummy. But they didn't taste like my favorite buttermilk cakes you get at the coffee shops.

I gave this 3 stars because as stated (I converted it to 7 servings) they were good, but there was a definite baking powder taste.  They had potential though, so I made them again, this time using half the baking powder and baking soda, and added a bit of vanilla.  MUCH better.  They fluffed up just as much, and no baking powder taste.  (These are not that fluffy to start with though.)  With the changes, I give them 4.5* 7 serving is still enough to feed my family of 4 for 2-3 meals worth.  I just freeze the leftovers for future quick breakfasts.  Yum!

Best pancake recipe ever. However, my husband takes a short cut by using Bisquick and omits the baking soda and salt. He then adds 1/2 tsp. of Vanillaand doesn't over-stir. I'm ruined. Can't get pancakes better anywhere than home.

These were great! We had them for our Easter dinner (yes, I meant to type dinner ;). We halved the recipe, but only ended up cooking about half the batter. Hubby did say that he wished they were fluffier, but we both really enjoyed the taste, and our 16 month old who usually gives his pancakes to the dogs ate all of his. Can't wait to see how the batter we have left in the fridge cooks up.

This pancake recipe is excellent. It tasted better than the mix you buy in the store. I halved the recipe and it still made three days worth of breakfast for my family of three. I did add a touch of heavy cream because I only had fat free milk on hand. Best homeade pancakes Iv'e ever made!

Very yummy - the recipe made a bunch (I scaled down to 4 servings and it made a ton) so I froze leftovers in ziploc bags. They were great reheated as well. My son says they are better than any he has ever had

I just made these for supper and the servings should say feeds 12 truckers and their entire family.  Makes way too many pancakes; all in all: they were good but I really didn't care for the consistency.

These were very good, although I tried putting vanilla in like another reviewer said and didn't like that.  Wish I had stuck to the original recipe.  I did modify the size as well.

I had to add a ton of sugar and vanilla to give them some flavor. I prefer sweeter pancakes so I will never make these again.

I made these pancakes today and they came out tasty but had a wierd after taste. I think it was the amount of baking powder and baking soda it asked for. The next time I make them I'm going to cut down on those two.

If you like buttermilk pancakes, this is the perfect recipe.  I scaled this back (2 cups flour, 2 cups buttermilk, etc) and still had enough to use the next day.  I did have to add a little bit of flour on day two to re-thicken the batter.

I loved the fluffiness of this recipe! The full recipe does make a ton, so I will, like other reviewers, scale it back next time. I froze some since it made so many and we couldn't eat them all. I will update my review to let you all know how they tasted. Thanks! UPDATE-The frozen ones are good! Of course,nothing beats fresh, but fine for those times you need a quick  homemade breakfast and don't have time.

My husband discovered bugs in the Bisquick so I suggested pancakes from scratch. He had never made them without a mix but was very pleased with the tender results - even if he wants to mix until all the lumps are gone. Very good.

I used whole wheat flour, which I think changed the complete flavor of the pancakes.  I put some vanilla in the mix and still didn't care for the taste.  Next time I'll try with regular unbleached flour.  I wasn't happy with the recipe, but I think it was my fault, not the recipes.

These are the best pancakes we've ever had! Just delicious.. I had to sub milk/vinegar combo for buttermilk and that worked out great. I cut the recipe to 4 servings, and I still have enough mix for 2 more servings. This one is going in the recipe box! I agree with whoever said you don't need much syrup with these.. they're just that good.

These pancakes were very light and fluffy, but didn't have quit enough flavor.  May I'll try all buttermilk and no milk, plus a pinch of salt, next time.

I was a little disappointed b/c I expected greatness from all the rave reviews, but only got mediocre pancakes. Maybe it was b/c I modified the servings, but they didn’t have much taste to me, even after adding more sugar. My family ate them and said they were good, so they weren't bad, just not great.

Well i learned my lesson about reading how much a recipe makes, lol.  I was making pancakes for an hour. But we froze all of the ones that we didn't eat, just rolled them and wrapped them in plastic wrap, can be microwaved easily at work with some sugar and lemon or for a great pre-made brekkie.  This recipe is very good.  I would have given it five stars, but i followed another foodies advice and used plain yogurt so i don't really know how these are with buttermilk.  Worth making! Thankies for the recipe.

These are the best!  Before this recipe I couldn't make a good pancake to save my soul...but I can do these!  They are delicious every time.   This makes a TON of batter.  I have made as little as 3 servings of this recipe and it has been plenty for our family of 5.

YUMMIE!!!  This makes a whole lot of pancakes!!! Which was fine with me.  I just bag them and put them in the freezer for the kids during the week!  In some of the pancakes I added choco chips, blueberries and cinnamon/applesauce mixture!  This recipe is definitely a keeper!!!  I didn't have any buttermilk...so i just added lemon to some milk and there u go!  Thank You!

This is the best pancake recipe I've used so far...the pancakes come out nice and fluffy...pancakes I've made from other recipes seem to come out too "cakey"...these pancakes pretty much melt in your mouth...I added a little bit more sugar and a little vanilla as my own modifications...that way I wouldn't have to have so much syrup on top...great recipe!!!!

I love this recipe. Very easy. I make about half the recipe. I have been making it for a couple of years now and my family really loves it. As is it is a very thin pancake, which is the way my husband prefers his pancakes. I decided to add an extra half cup of flour and we had delicious fluffy pancakes. These are my favorite pancakes.

I agree these are the best pancakes! After trying 5 top rated recipes here, this recipe is a winner - easy to make, surprisingly tasty, even without vanilla, or cinnamon, or fruits, the texture is awesome too. They are thick, yet light and fluffy- these met my every expectation! Be careful not to burn them, they are done real quick!

These are the perfect pancakes, no need to look any further. Don't be afraid to cook up a bunch of extras, once cooled you can keep them in the fridge or freezer and just pop them in the toaster the next day or when you feel like a snack

These where wonderful!!! I did add some cinnamon to it and 2 tablespoons more of sugar and presto they where great. Very moist melt in your mouth. I will use these again my husband and my kids loved them.

These were pretty good pancakes.  I'm experimenting with the liquids to get my preferred consistency.   My wife loves them and excess batter will store well in the freezer for an easy breakfast down the road.

These pancakes are delicious. This recipe is probably enough to feed a whole truck stop though. I halfed it, using 3 eggs, and it still made a ton. Sooooo good!

These came out really awful for me.  Maybe because I didn't have buttermilk.  The batter was runny and the pancakes came out too thin with no taste.

I gave this 2 stars because I ran out of buttermilk at 3 cups short and I didn't put a exact amount of flower in. my ending result tasted very bad, it was really eggey and non-sweet. I reccomend this recipe even thought it didn't work for me, I am sure it will be delicous for you!!!

I had to scale down this recipe because I wasn't feeding an army.  The resulting scale down was way too thin, so I had to add quite a bit of flour to make it the right consistency.  Even so, it was still rather thin when it went into the pan.  Because it was thin, it didn't rise very much, so my pancake was flat.  I added a teaspoon of vanilla to the batter.  I think the pancakes tasted wonderful and would make them again.

I was optimistic about these pancakes because of all the great reviews but I thought they were pretty plain.  I made a half-recipe and added 3 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/8 tsp cloves, and 1/8 tsp ginger and they were still tasteless.

It was good as is, only small change was to add 3-4 drops of Vanilla extract.  Helps add hint of flavor.  They were great without syrup.

I didn't much care for these but my 2 1/2 year old and 9 month old seem to think they are okay. I made half a batch and froze the left overs!  I also added mini chocolate chips to them and they turned out ok!

fantastic but if you are going to sub the buttermilk with regular milk mixed with 1 tablespoon of vinegar leave out the additional milk that the recipe calls for.  The additional milk makes the batter too runny.  Other than that, these are the best pancakes I have ever made.

These turn out light, fluffy and delicous.  It makes plenty to freeze for school morning breakfasts.  The second time I made them I didn't have enough regular flour and substituted whole wheat flour about 1/2, they turned out just as good.

Sooooo good. Didn't have regular buttermilk so I used the dry version and followed the conversion on the can. Worked just as well.

I made these the other morning and first off they made enough to feed a truck stop! So unless you want a ton of pancakes I would advise to cut the recipe in half. Since I had so much batter I made chocolate chip pancakes (very good) cinnamon/nutmeg pancakes (very good) but the plain ones seemed to have a slight baking soda/powder taste. Not sure if I will make again, but thanks for the post

I recalculated this for 5 servings, for my family of 4.  Had 4 medium pancakes left over to freeze.  My husband and 2 sons all said, "Never make anything else!"  We all loved this recipe!

I made these for my neice's birthday.
We did a vote and all of them wanted pancakes for breakfast.  I made 9 to start with (one for each kid.) and when I came back to give them some butter and syrup, everyone was done eating!   They all wanted more and I ended up making 40.  There were 2 left-over and I had them and they were pretty darn good.

YUMMY!  We even used whole wheat flour, 1/2 cup coconut milk instead of regular milk, 1 banana, 1 apple sauteed in butter, cinnamon, and sugar, and it still turned out soo good!  They were a little crispy on the outside and perfect on the inside.  The flavor was awesome!  Seriously the most adaptable pancake recipe ever!  Next time we might have to try the traditional way just to see how great they are! :)

Just made these this morning.  It makes a lot of pancakes.  I halved the recipe and still froze about 2/3 of it.  These made very fluffy pancakes, a bit heavier I would say than box mixes but that's not what I wanted.  I'm not sure how people are getting thin ones, maybe not using the optional pinch of salt or the griddle heat?

I wouldn't rate these as "the best" because I didn't think they had a lot of flavor. I did love how fluffy they turned out and I didn't have to add extra flour as I usually have to do. I will make them again but add a little extra sugar. I added  little vanilla this time but will have to add more to them next time I make them.

These pancakes were OK. They were not as fluffy as I like my pancakes to be. After reading all the great reviews I was expecting something great and made them for Father's Day. No one else in the family was too excited about them either.

Yummy and they freeze well so they are easy for quick breakfasts or for the kids to make a snack themselves.  I even made them with powdered buttermilk when that was all I had and they were very good.

These turned out really good.  I used part whole wheat flour, which I think made the batter thicker so I did have to add a bit more milk.  I served with the "Absolute Best Pancake Syrup" from this site.  Excellent combo!!

I think I may have done something wrong, because the batter was EXTREMELY watery and I had to add about a cup of flour to make it even stay in a circle on the pan. When I   did get the batter thick enough to use, they had no flavor and were not very fluffy. will try again!

These definitely are the kind of pancakes, doused with maple syrup, you would get at a truck-stop!!

I added a little extra milk. I thought they tasted a little baking-powdery, but the rest of the gang enjoyed them with nothing but mmm's!

An easy recipe and quick! The recipe only gets 3 stars from me, because of the baking-powder taste and its ordinariness. This is the traditional pancake-recipe.

Enjoy!
Louise.

These were pretty good, just nothing special. They came out very thin and a tad doughy. If you want killer pancakes, try Dad's Whole Grain Pancakes from this site. I make them nearly every week, and they are the best!

These were pretty good but the batter was really runny so I had to add more flour to get the consistancy I wanted. They tasted good though and I will most likely make them again.

I needed to make pancakes for my daughters and this recipe was the simplest as I had all the ingredients on hand. They turned out great - fluffy & light & delicious enough to eat on its own.I scaled down the recipe to 2 units instead of 5 & use abt 1.5 tablespoon of butter & makes abt 8-10 medium-sized pancakes. My daughters loved them. Will definitely make them again.

We already love the "good old fashioned pancakes" from this site, so we weren't expecting to find anything close to them, but these are a nice change. Very good! They have a nice flavor and are light and fluffy too. I changed the serving size to 5 and it was perfect for our family of 5. We will make these again.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was just alright.  My teenage boys said the other buttermilk pancakes I make are much better so guess I will stick to making those. Might just have to post that recipe on here.

I have to agree with the one poor rating. These were thin and tasteless. I'm glad I reduced the recipe to 2 servings so as not to waste all that milk. Boxed mixes are much better than this!

Great and simple! Uses much less baking powder (and therefore less sodium) than my old recipe. Also delicious with blueberries.

I have tried other recipes for homemade pancakes. The last one the batter was really thick. My now 2 year old boy wouldn't even touch them and he loves his pancakes.
I wanted to make pancakes this morning so I came to allrecipes and looked up pancake recipes and came across this one.
Well no need to look for another pancake recipe!!!! These were absolutely wonderful!!! My 2 year old had already had cereal for his breakfast but I thought I would give him a pancake anyways.....well he ate the whole thing!!!! My oldest girl who is 8 ate 3 of them, and my youngest girl who is 7 at SIX whole pancakes!!! 
I don't know who it was but someone rated these a 1 and said they have no flavor well I thought these had plenty enough flavor. My husband loved them. He said they were very fluffy.
This is added to my favorites now and I will make these over and over again.!! Thanks for the awesome recipe :)

These are the best pancakes I've ever had!  I liked the texture a lot, they were very fluffy!  I had to halve the recipe, since it makes a very large amount, but followed the measurements exactly. I have tried substituting regular milk with vinegar added for the buttermilk, it does not work at all!  Real buttermilk is a necessity for these pancakes to turn out the way they are intended taste and texture wise.  I will use this recipe for pancakes from now on!

i always loved pancakes, but some taste horrible and others you just want to keep eating until you explode.  these were the latter kind... fantastic!  i used soured milk instead of buttermilk because it's hard to find where i live, and they still came out awesome.  thanks for very easy and delicious recipe!

I've made these twice now.  I leave the butter out and use about half cake flour / half reg flour. (i cut the recipe to serve 4 and sub 2/3C of flour for cake flour.)  I dropped frozen blueberries straight into the batter on the griddle.  First time I made these, I used store brand frozen berries which tasted good but not all that.  Then I decided to do a taste test on the second batch and the extra cost of the premium brands is well worth it.

This recipe is so yummy! I think I'm addicted! I use powdered butter milk & I add a tiny bit more than the receip calls for because I love the taste of the buttermilk in these & it tastes great! Plus it so much easier to keep on hand! What a FABULOUS recipe!

These are most definitely the best buttermilk pancakes I have ever had.  Next time though I would scale the recipe down as it makes a lot of pancakes.  I would say servings for 5 equals servings for 7 and servings for 2 or 3 equals servings for 5.

Loved this recipe.Until recently, whenever I made pancakes they always came out flat and under-cooked.Have adopted this method and now my pancakes are a huge favourite with my family.

Good protein pancake but I can taste the eggs.  They were also very "hole-e", so I assume they have too much bkg powder and soda.
Thank you though.  I will use this recipe once in awhile.
Kids loved it.

I've always cooked crepes and these were my first pancakes.  They were thick and fluffy and so easy.  I didn't add the melted butter and they still came out great.  I'm definitely making this a regular weekend breakfast!

I cut the recipe in HALF, used a 1/4c. measuring cup as directed and it still made 19 pancakes.  A lot of work as far as pancakes go but worth it.  Again, I cut this in half so you may want to scale this down unless you're having a pancake party.

When I first poured the batter into the pan, I was a little skeptical as it is very watery.  However the batter bubbled up wonderfully.

The pancakes are better than any other kinds I've tired, and have a chewy texture.  Really good with real maple syrup eggs and sausage.

These pancakes are the best I have ever tasted! Whenever I made pancakes I used to always use the Aunt Jamima mix, but now my family wont let me go back to doing so. Although it's a bit more work making them from scratch, the taste of these pancakes is well worth it! The only thing I did differently was cut the recipe down a bit. It makes A LOT of pancakes! Thanks for the FANTASTIC recipe!

Excellent pancakes, they are so good I added a tsp. of vanilla and I made way more than 12 pancakes but thats because they probably weren't as big.

This truly is the best pancake recipe I have ever tried. The cakes were so light and fluffy. I did separate the whites and beat them before adding them to the batter, which I feel made them a little lighter and just perfect. I changed the quantity to 4 and my husband and I will have enough left over for tomorrow. I plan to add blueberries to the remaining batter. This is my pancake recipe from now on!

These pancakes were excellent!  I divided the recipe by 5 and it made the perfect amount for my husband and I.  I normally do not opt to eat buttermilk pancakes because the buttermilk changes the texture, but I was happy with these.  They were fluffy enough for my liking, and had good flavor.

These were absolutely *wonderful*! I skimped the baking soda and instead used that amount of baking bowder (we were out and I was hungry for pancakes. :P) and also substitutes the bittermilk for milk and lemon (again, lack of ingredient). I needed to add a bit of flour to thivken it up (I like mine THICK) and I also added a touch of vanilla. But nonetheless, this was phenominal! Definitely restaurant-style pancakes. I'll definitely be passing this recipe on!

These pancakes are fluffy and flavorful. I added a bit more milk as the instructions suggest to make the batter slightly thinner than measured ingredients. I have made zip locked bags of the dry ingredients with the measurements of the wet (egg, milk, etc.) for quicker future breakfasts. Store any unused batter in a sealed container. I haven't used thawed, frozen batter yet. We'll see if the results are the same. These are now the staple, replacing store bought mixes.

My husband and I liked these pancakes very much. I didn't have buttermilk on hand so I soured the milk with cider vinegar. Since I sized the recipe for two I measured 3/4 cup plus 1 tsp milk and added 1 T vinegar and let it sit on the counter for half an hour. I added a dash of vanilla to the batter. They were more like crepes than truck stop pancakes. I will be making these again.

I liked this recipe.  The pancakes rise well and are very fluffy.    The baking powder/soda is a little over powering.

I love these pancakes. I have never made a buttermilk pancake before and I was not dissapointed.  The only downside with these pancakes is that you NEED to know when to stop eating them otherwise you'll be left with a stomach ache ;)Will be making these again and again.  I scaled down the recipe to 6 and using the 1/4 cup scoops it make 28 good sized pancakes.

I wish they had six stars for these pancakes!  These were so great my husband said "if I could make pancakes this good I would make them everyday!"  Only down side is I think they are called truckstop pancakes because the recipe makes enough to feed a whole truckstop!  VERY GOOD!!

This was a great recipe for pancakes! It did need a bit more sugar though. I added another 1 1/2 tablespoons of vanilla sugar.

Wow!  We just had these for breakfast, YUM!  These pancakes taste like cracker barrel's!!  I halved the recipe, but used 4 tlbs of melted butter and 3 full eggs.  I thought I would get 6 pancakes, but I got 12 big ones, so I think a serving is actually 2 big pancakes, next time I'll quarter the recipe.  I'm going to try subbing applesauce for the butter, using ww pastry flour, skim milk, 1% buttermilk and cutting the sugar for everyday, but definately try them as written, they're delicious, and worth the fat and calories for a treat!!!

Yum! These pancakes are delicious, exactly how I imagined a real American pancake should taste!  My daughters both agree as does my husband.  We're from the UK so these aren't typically the pancakes we get here, I will never make those boring flat ones again!

These are, by far, the best pancakes I have ever eaten! I usually cook half the batter and freeze the other half for another weekend. It freezes well and tastes great even after being frozen a few weeks

Cut the servings down to 60%, so I only used 3 eggs, etc. My oldest son had 3 of his buddies over, between them, my other two kids, and my husband, I couldn't make them fast enough. They loved them. My husband even had 6 of them (which is twice as much as he usually has). Even though they loved them, these were just ok for me. My one son preferred them with chocolate chips in them, and when he tried one without the chocolate chips, he said he preferred the other pancakes that I usually make with biscuit. But with so many boys to feed, this was the perfect recipie

Yum!  I had some buttermilk around after making a cake so I thought I'd give these a try.  Usually, I use the "complete" mixes from the store that you just add water to.  I think this will be a permanant addition to my cookbook - these were great!  One of the few recipes I didn't have to change at all!!

These pancakes were very good.  They took longer to cook than most, but that was good, as usually pancakes brown too quickly for me to catch up.  I used whole-wheat-white flour which was great.

These pancakes are very, very, very good.  My husband was a truck driver and I have definately eaten my share of truck stop cakes.  I love the texture.  Fluffy but still has good substance.  I love these.

Best pancakes ever! Makes a ton. I use fat free buttermilk powder (in the baking aisle of the grocery store) and Splenda instead of sugar. Both the cakes and the batter freeze well, and the leftovers even taste great microwaved (cover lightly with plastic wrap first).

This recipe makes some of the best pancakes around. I would recommend scaling it down to the amount needed immediately, though, as when I tried to save the batter it went moldy after a day.

This was awesome! Been on the search for the restaurant style fluffy pancakes for a long time and I think I found it. It does makes lots, but I made them all and froze the remainder for a quick breakfast or evening meal. Thanks!

I agree 100% with MOOLATTE's review. These pancakes were okay, (I didn't throw them away.) but with these ratings I had much higher expectations. I followed the directions and ingredients exactly and simply did not like the texture or the bland flavor.

I halved the recipe and it still made a lot.  These were good--very similar to the pancakes in my 1970's Betty Crocker cookbook--but I will continue to try other recipes in a quest for the ultimate pancake.

Wow!  I will never make pancakes from the box ever again!  Awesome recipe, but makes a ton of batter, so be sure to have bags to freeze some.  I always half the recipe and still have leftovers.  Delicious!!!

I added cut up strawberries to the batter.  Had to add some flour because it was too thin...  Also added vanilla.

I added vanilla, blueberries, and cinnamon and these pancakes were still bland.  I made the recipe exactly as it's written (decreased the servings to 5 using the allrecipes tool), but I used buttermilk powder, so I don't know if that's the reason for the blandness.  They were not fluffy, as other reviewers have stated.  I will keep looking for another recipe.

I made a 1/2 batch and only used 2 eggs. Also used powdered buttermilk and it all turned out great. Very good taste. I made at least 2 dozen good sized pancakes. This will be a regular for our family.

Fabulous!  I used 1% milk with a couple of tbsp. of lemon juice and the pancakes turned out beautifully!

I thought these were so-so. They reminded me of pancakes from a mix, only they were fluffier. The texture of the batter was amazing, but the flavor was lacking. I used lowfat buttermilk so maybe that was the cause. I will keep looking for a buttermilk pancake recipe.

I have tried many methods for making the best pancakes.  This recipe was, by far, the very best that I have tried. I also deleted the salt. The kids said that they were excellent!

These were so-so. Perhaps it was b/c I substituted 1 T vinegar to regular milk instead of real buttermilk.

These were delicious!  I've been looking for a tastier pancake recipe for a while . . . these are it!  I also scaled these back to 4.8 servings, and it made quite a lot!  Both my husband and I loved these, and our three kids inhaled them.  Saturday mornings are big breakfast days for us, and last night, the request for breakfast was "those new yummy pancakes!"  Thanks for a pancake recipe that we love!

These are excellent.  I omitted the milk and used only the buttermilk called for in the recipe, and the batter was about right.

I finally found my Papa's Pancake recipe! Thank you! I prefer my pancakes thinner and less cakey - so I thin it out with even more butermilk.  Love It!!

Amazing pancakes!!! This is my first review and after making these pancakes and seeing some very happy faces, I knew I had to write a review.We all loved these and the next day I made them again with the left over batter and they were still yummy, light and fluffy.I followed the recipe as written but I  whipped the egg whites first and folded them into the batter.PERFECT!!!

These did not "rise" like the pancakes I am used to but hub liked them because of that.  Says he doesn't like them cake-y and these weren't.  I made the 4.8 version.  So 5 stars as I found pancakes he really liked.  Thanks!

I LOVE these. I subbed whole wheat flour and added 1 teaspoon vanilla and 1/2 cup wheat germ. My husband and daughters gobbled them up. They taste even better if you can make the batter ahead and fry them up a few days later - fluffier, creamier. Mmmmmmmm.

these pancakes taste great however my batter, which was made 2 days ahead of time, deflated by nearly a quarter in its depth. i'll definately make this recipe again with the plan to cook the pancakes at the same time to see how fluffy they are. thanks bobo!

Big hit here at my house.  Only thing, I had to add a little more flour because the batter was too thin.  Other than that they were wonderful.  A Keeper!

These are the best pancakes.  They are really egg-y, as opposed to flour-y, which I like... kind of like Perkins or IHOP's pancakes.  I used to make Alton Brown's pancake recipe from Good Eats on the Food Network, but these are even better and less work!

OK, when I saw the name of these I just had to make them.  My hubby and I have a standing joke, when you want 'your usual stand-by...wiht NO frills'...you want "Truck-stop...". These were good.  I love to cook with buttermilk -which I achieved by using milk with vinegar, tried lemon juice and just wasn't working well engough for me. These were similar to my old recipe, but with the buttermilk.  We did scale back to 4.8 thanks for that tip.  My family of 4 loved these!!! Thanks for the recipe!!!!

MY SEARCH IS OVER!!! For the past 2 month everytime I've made pancakes I've tried a different recips looking for the perfect one - and this is it. I followed the directions to a tee and used milk and lemon juice instead of buttermilk. My boyfriend loves them - this recipe is a keeper!! Feeds an army so we've been eating them for 3 days in a row!

These pancakes are very yummy and very filling!  I made 1/2 a batch and it fed 6 people on Saturday, and had enough left to feed 2 more people on Sunday.  Will be making for all special occasion breakfasts!

I made these for pancake-crazy Husband, and he really enjoyed them. I made them with 1/4c batter as instructed, and although they came out rather thin, Husband said it kept them nice and light - they would be rather dense and heavy if they were any thicker. I'll be making these again. Thanks!
