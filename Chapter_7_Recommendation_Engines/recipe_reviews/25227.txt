Easier than I thought it would be, and a great treat on my low carb diet! I don't own a double boiler, so I just simmered a pan of water and rested a metal bowl on top. The key is to put the yolk mixture in BEFORE the metal bowl heats, so that it warms slowly ... just like Avery said.

This was an amazing recipe, the flavor was great.  I did cut down on the lemon juice and used only 3 tablespoons.  I will cut down a little more next time as I only like it a little tangy.  I eliminated the salt altogether, really it isn't necessary since the butter is salty.  I also used margarine as opposed to butter and it still came out wonderful. If you're like me and don't like your sauce with a strong lemony flavor, omit it until the end and just add to your taste.

This recipe is super!  The hollandaise thicken up nicely with very little effort.  I took everyone's advice and only used 1 1/2 tablespoons of fresh lemon juice and it was perfect!  I also altered the recipe a little tiny bit to accomodate the ingredients that I had on hand...I only used 3 yolks because we had extra large eggs and used 1/2 cup (or 1 stick) butter because 1 cup seemed a bit much.  I also added a pinch of paprika to give it a little zing.  Tasted great with my sauteed asparagus and mushrooms!

I'll tone down the leamon next time, but other than that, this is an easy delicious recipe. NOTE: Add all the ingrediants to the pot prior to adding the egg yolks and you'll find it much easier to incorporate the eggs without cooking them too quickly. Basically it allows you to whisk the eggs the entire time they're in the pot.

Oh my goodness!!! This is the BEST Hollandaise Sauce I have ever had. Not too lemony or thick...just right! Very quick and easy, I found, for my first time making it. I didn't have a double boiler, but I used very low heat and whisked constantly. Served over rosemary chicken and asparagus...mmmmmm! Thank you!

So take this recipe and half it.  Keep the yolk amount correct for a full recipes worth.  Perfect amount of lemon this way,nice and thick.  Keep heat very low.  If it starts to curdle add another yolk, it worked for me.

This recipe has become one of my *old faithfuls*. I cut the lemon down to 3T as well, and I temper my eggs. The recipe halves well, except I reduce the lemon even more, to 1T. As far as consistency, I've never had a problem.

Followed recipe exactly. Tasted like lemon egg yolks. My husband said it left a bad taste in his mouth.

Many, many years ago I stayed at the Mccormic
Inn in Chicago and room service delivered to me the best Eggs Benedict I have ever eaten.  This is not it, but with a tweak & a tweak I'm sure it can be adjusted to duplicate my experience of long ago.  Way too much lemon to start, but easy to make.  I will tweak and try again.

This seems to be fail-proof. I made it a number of times and each time it came out perfect. I also added a pinch of nutmeg and thought the sauce only benefited from it. It is now a staple in our home: I usually made it for grilled trout, or steamed veggies. Excellent recipe.

Excellent sauce. No trouble making it in a double-boiler. Rich and lemony.

I tired this making it exactly and I don't understand why people think it's a hollandaise sauce... I think the 3 tablespoons was a typo and needs to be teaspoons. The second time I made it (the first batch was garbage), I cut the butter in half and uses about 1 1/2 teaspoons of lemon juice and it was perfect. Thank you for teaching me the basics of how to make the sauce but the lemon was way, way, way too much!!

Tip, clarify your UNSALTED butter before you start. I just microwave it until it starts to boil and then skim off the foam, make sure it cools a bit before you use it.  For step 1, avoid salts as they break the emulsion you are trying to form, so no Worcestershire (if you must, you can add it at the end).  Just start with the acid (vinegar or lemon juice) and egg yokes, slowly warmed in the double boiler while whisking fairly vigorously (and I stress what the recipe says, do NOT let the top pan touch the water -- you want to warm it up slowly not cook the egg yokes).  When the mixture starts to thicken add the first 1 tbsp of hot water, let it cook a little longer and add another tbsp of water, when it starts to thicken again you are ready to move to step 2.  It should take a while to reach this point, an electric whisk can speed this up (and save your arm) but don't over beat the eggs; let it take it's time.  If it starts to thicken too much then you have too much heat.  Remove from heat immediately and add 1 tbsp water -- if it's really bad another egg yoke might revive it.  For step 2, make sure the butter is not hot.  Just drizzle in about 1 tbsp at a time and then whisk until it's fully incorporated before moving on.  Those finding this "too lemony", are you using the full cup of butter?  Best of luck to all

This was simple to make and tasted pretty good, too!  I'm not a fan of Hollandaise sauce but my husband loves it on eggs benedict.  Normally I buy the sauce mix packets, but not anymore.  I like this sauce and will be making it from now on for our Sunday morning brunches!

First off I have to address the people who are saying they have a quicker way to do this. IE. Via putting everything in a blender. Please for the love of god do not do this. The point of the double boiler is to slowly cook the egg yolks so you do not get salmonella poisoning. Yes it is a bit more work, but please do not risk getting sick for doing more easily. 
That being said, this is a great recipe. Please remember the Hollandaise Sauce is supposed to be lemony. That is the kind of sauce it is. If you want a butter sauce, try going the mornay sauce route.

The lemon was WAY too strong. My boyfriend tried it, and said he didn't know what it was, but it wasn't hollandaise sauce. I used almost $3.00 worth of butter trying to fix it before I threw it out and went with a good ol' Home and Garden recipe.

This Hollandaise Sauce was really easy to make.  I think there was too much lemon juice.  It was way too tangy for my liking, but it was still really good.  I made artichokes to dip into the sauce, while my husband smoked some TBones!  The steaks were also really good when you dipped them into the Hollandaise Sauce.

Too much lemon. To use this recipe as a dip for vegetables would be fine but I don't recommend pouring this over Eggs Benedict since it is so sour.

I think there must be a typo in the recipe...there is no way there should be 3.5 TABLEspoons of lemon.  I even cut down and made the recipe as is except but with 1 3/4T of lemon...STILL too much lemon.  This is the first time I"ve made hollandaise sauce but I eat it all the time, so I'm certain that this is just not how it should taste.

The upside...it was very easy to make and came out super creamy.  I might try it again...

This was delish, and easy peasy! Will definitely be cutting way back on the lemon juice though! Saying it was a bit tart was an understatement. Loved the velvety texture though! Added a bit more worcestshire, and some cayenne pepper and some tobasco sauce!!

The recipe and procedures were very easy to follow.  I will use at least 1/2 of the lemon juice next time.  It was far too lemony for a true hollandaise where there should only be a hint of lemon flavor.  Otherwise a good recipe that I will use again.

Well, I read some of the reviews that mentioned that this receipe is too " lemony", but I decided that based on all the wonderful 5/5 reviews, it shouldn't be too bad.  Boy was I wrong. The sauce is sooo lemony, that you almost feel like you are eating a lemon tart on top of you english muffin.  Horrible.  This sauce would be better on top of a lemon-dill cod, or a sweet maple-syrup salmon, than eggs benedict.  I used real lemon juice, and 3.5 tablespoons was too much.  I saved the receipe by adding brown sugar, mayo, and more worcestershire sauce. Reccomendation: use 1.5 tablespoons of lemon juice , unless you absolutely love   the taste of tangy creamy lemon on your eggs.

Good results, even though I used a saucepan directly on a stove on low heat. Just kept whisking and stirring. However, lessen the lemon juice by half a tablespoon if you don't like your sauce so tangy.

This recipe is delicious and SO easy to make.  I don't have a double boiler, but it works fine in a regular saucepan.  I added lemon to taste, and cut out the salt.  It really didn't need it.  Just remember to remove it from heat as soon as it's at the desired consistency.  Delicious!  It's became a regular staple at our dinnertable, and there's never any leftover.  It's great over anything, especially asparagus.

This was excellent.  A lot easier than I expected.  I didn't have lemon in the house so I tried it with a lime.  I will try lemon next time as the lime left something to be desired.  I would also half this recipe next time.  It made a lot of sauce.  Half would have been perfect for 2 people with 2 eggs each.

holy cow! this recipe was exactly what I was looking for. I cut the recipe in half since I am cooking for just one. I also cut out the salt entirely and replaced it with ground mustard (the best hollandaise sauce I ever had was from a restaurant in Portland who also added ground mustard). Perfect over some steamed veggies!! *yum*yum*

Try and try again... I was finally able to make this, and it came out very well.  At first, I mixed only egg and lemon, and added the water after a minute or so.  Once it began to thicken, in went the unsalted butter. I used cold butter, cut into small pieces, and only used half of what was called for. The cold butter seemed to temper the mixture better. The only seasoning I added was a pinch of cayenne. I held off from adding all seasoning til the very end, as I've read that salt, etc. can interfere with the emulsion process.  All in all, it was delicious over steamed broccoli. Thanks for this recipe.

This was my first time making this and it was wonderful!!  I made it to go on the Potato Salmon Patties and my whole family went crazy over it.  Loved the reviews that said to wisk the egg in the pan before it gets warm.

Wonderful sauce.  Have always been intimidated by the term Hollandaise Sauce but have always wanted to make Eggs Benedict at home.  So when I found this recipe and all the great reviews I went ahead.  Did not have lemons so I substituted lime juice. I halved the recipe, used unsalted butter and 1 tablespoon of the lime juice.  The result was very good, a little more than a hint of lime.  Next time I will make sure I have lemons.  I will also add some tarragon- had tarragon flavored hollandaise in my favorite restaurant in NJ and think this recipe will let me duplicate it.    Note to all first time hollandaise chefs: Follow the instructions! -low heat, whisk continuously, add butter a little at a time.  Your sauce will be silky smooth. Thanks so much for sharing.

Just made this again with lemon juice.  Was wonderful!  Made eggs benedict with asparagus instead of canadian bacon.  The sauce made the dish.  Guests enjoyed it.  Again, thanks for the great recipe.
Note: Never make it with lime juice.  If you don't have lemons, don't make it!!

Worked out great! My husband is a chef and doesn't like making this sauce at home because of the effort. He was surprised when I made this recipe and it turned out perfect. He commented that many professional cooks don't get it right the first time. (though usually it's because they have to make such large batches of it). He assisted by adding paprika and tobasco to taste, a typical restaurant practice. I got creative and added dill which made it the perfect sauce for our salmon filets. For just the two of us, I would cut the recipe in half because this made so much sauce. Regrets, leftovers don't keep well because the emulsion separates.

I cut down the lemon to 3 tbsp as suggested and it was still too much lemon.  No other flavor other than lemon and butter.  Too salty too.

This was a very good recipe.  As recommended I also cut back on the lemon juice.  I ended up using the Realemon instead of fresh lemon juice because my lemons were way under ripe. I also over cooked it a little and it became thick like paste is, I simply whisked in some more water and it was perfect!

This is a great recipe although it seemed to seperate and clump up as soon as I was about to serve it. I suggest adding a little less better and 1 more yolk while whisking in the salt.

This is so very good but I have to triple this recipe. We like a lot of Hollandaise Sauce on a cajun breakfast I make. They used to serve it in a restaraunt we use to go to until they closed up.So now this is my version & I think I am very close to theirs. Thanks to your Hollandaise recipe .

I used only about 2 Tbsp of lemon juice based on other reviews and thought it had a nice flavor. I would hold on adding the water until you have it all together and whisked because I thought it could have been a little thicker and wished I hadn't put the water in.

This turned out really well, and I didn't even measure everything exactly. I used a bit less butter and lemon juice. I don't have a double-boiler, so I stacked two of my deepest pans. Excellent recipe!

My first time making Hollandaise sauce, and it actually turned out! Agree with other reviewers that there is too much lemon juice in the recipe, I'd cut it in half next time, but the flavor is there! 
I sprinkled some paprika over the top as color and garnish, and it added a nice flavor to it!

I don't have a double boiler and I only wanted one serving, so I used a pinch of salt, pinch of white pepper, couple drops of worcestershire, couple more drops of water, one egg yolk and about 3/4 T lemon juice... in my smallest heavy-bottom pot, on low with a plastic whisk, and 1/2 stick of butter cut into 1/4" slices (added one at a time).  It turned out almost perfect - next time I'll make more :) and cut the lemon juice to 1/2 T per yolk.

Fool-proof and very forgiving.  I didn't really measure ingredients--I only used 1-1/2 sticks of butter so I wouldn't have to open another package, I used about 1-3/4 tablespoons of lemon juice, few squirts of Worcheshire, 3 egg yolks, pinch of salt and pepper.  Easy and delicious, Julia Child would be proud.

I've never made Hollandaise before, but this turned out great! I followed other reviewers' advice and cut the lemon juice in half (and it was still very lemony). It was great on top of some steamed asparagus... mmmm

This recipe was easy to make and the sauce turned out beautifully mixed. It did not separate and was very smooth.  That being said it there was far too much lemon in the sauce for it to be used on eggs.  I will use this recipe again but I will start with 1 teaspoon of lemon juice and work up from there.  I have rated this recipe as 2 because it did not work with my eggs benedict and I was unable to serve them with the sauce.

I thought I followed the directions exactly, including removing from heat and covering the pan with a lid to keep it warm.  The sauce was great for about 5 minutes, then it separated and I could not fix it.  That could just be novice cooking.  So, my 3 stars is because it was way too lemony and I even reduced the lemon juice to 3 tbsp.

Why did I buy the Knorr hollandaise sauce mix for so long? This is fantastic and surprisingly easy. I used 3 tbsp. lemon juice and it was great on steamed asparagus, although a little too tangy for the poached eggs. I added about 1/2 tsp mustard powder and that helped tone down the lemon. Next time, I'll start with 1 tbsp lemon juice then gradually add to taste, depending on the recipe.

I made this today and it came out awesome! The only change I made was using a dash of Tabasco instead of Worcestershire, but that's just because I had Tabasco sauce on hand. One note, when tasting the sauce on its own it tastes too lemony, but when it is applied to the target food it is BLISS. My eggs benedict came out perfectly!

I've never eaten or made a hollandaise sauce before, but it was a recommeded sauce for crabmeat stuffed chicken breast.  It was so easy to make, and the flavor was perfect for the chicken.  I only used 1/2 cup of butter and 2 tablespoons of lemon juice.  I wouldn't have minded a little more lemon flavor though.

Like the other reviewers, I wholeheartedly recommend reducing by half the lemon juice in this recipe.  This sauce seems to have far too much butter for my tastes, as well. I'll try with half the butter on a next try. As I emulsified the sauce, I tasted it after adding half the butter. The flavor and texture were just fine, I should have stopped then. Despite my problems with the proportions of lemon and butter, the techniques explained in the recipe are near foolproof. The texture of the sauce is perfect; velvety and rich. Even a beginning cook could nail this recipe.

I'm giving this 5 stars because it is EASY and so good! I used salted butter and found it a tad too salty (didn't add the salt the recipe called for). Next time I will use unsalted and salt to taste. A halved recipe easily serves 4 over salmon fillets.

Was easier than I expected to be. Had my husband help- he whisked the yolk mixture and I added the melted butter. It started to get too thick, so I added a bit of the hot water from the pot that was waiting for poached eggs. I halved the recipe, but didn't measure the lemon juice, so overall it ended up being too lemony, though still delicious. I definitely plan to use again.   Helpful tip: put the sauce in a thermos while you cook the eggs, this will keep it warm and it won't break! (per Alton Brown)

Made Eggs Benedict for my mom this Mother's Day morning!  It was my first time ever making hollandaise AND poached eggs, and everything worked wonderful.  ONLY MAKE SURE TO CUT DOWN THE LEMON IN THIS RECIPE!  I cut the amount in half, and that was good.  Also, I don't think it needs quite so much butter - next time I might try using half the amount of butter.

I should have paid more attention to the comments about cutting back on the lemon juice. I used unsalted butter, but I think that was a mistake.  Needed to add more salt and it just didn't flavor it correctly.  As written, it was WAY too lemony. It had a nice texture...going to try it again.

I thought it was good and the consistency and lemon were perfect!...  Only reason not 5 stars was it was a tad eggy tasting for me, maybe because I used extra large eggs.  I didn't have 1/8 measuring spoon so I went with 1 drop worchesershire sauce...I will try cutting back yolks to 3 next time.  Thanks!

I ended up following the other suggestions and used 3 tablespoons lemon juice and then added a half teaspoon of cayenne pepper.  It turned out exactly the way we like it and it was incredibly easy.

Velvety smooth and tasty.  I found it to be a little too lemony for my taste.  I will definately use this recipe again but cut back slightly on the lemon.

A wonderfull, easy to follow recipe. I did not have white pepper on hand, so I used black pepper and omitted the Worstershire. (I can't say it, let alone spell it!) Served it on baked salmon and asparagus with wild rice on the side.
Creamy, not too tart, and didn't even think about breaking! A great sauce recipe I will be using from now on. Thanks!

This was WAY too buttery. To cut it, I used  1/2 tsp Worcestershire Sauce which only helped a little.  I will probably look for another recipe.

I give Avery 5 stars for the recipe's directions; perfect for the beginner cook.  I like my sauce very tart -- cut back just a smidgeon on the lemon juice.  I like to add sometimes a little Tobassco sauce when serving as an Eggs Benedict...

I used 4 TBS Lemon Juice and reduced the water by 1/2 TBS. (I love lemon) Added a pinch of nutmeg and only used 3/4 C. butter. Maybe I'll experiment and make it with less butter next time. Made it for Eggs Benedict.  Awesome!

This was very good.  I added some red bell pepper and a little garlic.  But I had trouble keeping it warm till dinner and I eventually lost track of it while doing something else and it got all lumpy and separated.  It still tasted good, it just wasn't as pretty.  Good the next day too!

Really good sauce! I used for eggs Benedict. I didn't have a double boiler. So, I just cooked it in a sauce pan over very low heat. It was easy to make and cooked quickly. I little lemony, but I liked it that way. Used lemon pepper instead of white.

I made this to go over crab and asparagus omelets that I prepared for breakfast and it was delicious. I have made hollandaise in the past and have to agree this is a simple recipe and turns out great. The secret to success is, like other reviews suggest, to put the ingredients in the top pan before you heat the water. The only change I made was that I added 1/4 tsp. of dill weed. It was wonderful!

Delicious Hollandaise. Nice mildly tart flavor and good consistancy.  Keeps well (within reason) with just a slight amount of hot water and whisking to bring it back to creaminess.  Thanks for posting it.

Great recipe EXCEPT way too much lemon juice for our taste.  I cut the lemon juice down to 1 1/2 Tablespoons.  I also mix everything except the butter and salt before it goes on the double boiler.  Then I heat it slowly on a low simmer while adding the butter and finally the salt to taste.

This is the best, and easiest, Hollandaise recipe that I have found. I often half the recipe for a quick addition to any meal. I change the amount of lemon juice I use depending on my mood! My main tip, melt the butter on the lowest possible setting, as your first step, let it sit on the counter while you prep everything else! That has been my main key to success!

This was much easier than I expected and was delicious!  A couple of nights ago I poached lobster tails in butter for my husband's birthday, and served it with crab (wretched excess, but it was a special birthday) and had a lot of leftover lobster-flavored butter.  So, tonight I made eggs benedict with leftover crab and used this recipe to make Hollandaise with the lobster butter.  Next time I'll use this recipe for a more standard benedict, but if you just happen to have lobster butter around...

Too much lemon. This recipe called for 3 tablespoons of lemon......use one or two unless u really like your sauce tart. Otherwise the recipe was great and I will never buy store bought hollandaise again.   I gave this 4 stars because its a great starter recipe.

This was excellent! A lot easier to whip up than I was expecting. I don't have a true double boiler, but I just used a metal mixing bowl over my stock pot with about an inch of water simmering below. As suggested, I started whisking the eggs and seasonings before placing over heat, then slowly added the butter. Definitely didn't take 15 minutes to thicken up. I halved the recipe as I was only serving 2, but as recommended I did use less lemon juice than it asked for. Was just the right lemony-ness.

Quick note: This cools off and tightens up VERY fast so I recommend serving immediately.

Who could eat the powder mixes? It is worth trying this recipe. I still use the cold butter method sometimes.

Turned out very nice. So easy! I would say a little on the lemony side (I love lemon and it was still a tad much for me) however...I used bottled lemon juice. If I had used fresh it might not have been as strong. I would say 3T with fresh and 2T with bottled would be perfect.

WAY TOO MUCH LEMON!  I would venture a guess that slightly less than half is a better amount of lemon. We ended up adding substantially more worcestershire and white pepper to try to cover up the taste (out of eggs at this point).

I haven't had good luck with pre-melted butter recipes in the past.  So, I added all ingredients for step one into a small sauce pot over low heat and then added cubed cold butter a couple of cubes at the time and whisked continuously until it was all melted and the sauce tightened up.  Then added a dash of cayenne pepper for a kick. Yum!

Lovely and simple.  I kept out the salt and pepper, just because I wanted to try it with the taste of only the three key ingredients.    I've always heard how hard it is to make, but it just takes constant stirring and a gently simmering pot of water on the double boiler and it's SO quick and easy.  I even used a hand reamer to get my lemon juice freshly and directly into the saucepan, leaving in any pulp that happened to fall in and it was still creamy and perfect.  Final thing, I just moved and lost my whisk on the way.  Instead I used chopsticks to stir and it worked perfectly (Japanese wooden chopsticks).

This is one of our favorites with poached eggs. we do not put worstershire sauce in it and add we add little more fresh lemon juice.  It is great.  Make sure you stir it over a low heat and do not over cook it or it will curdle the eggs.  Stir until just barely thickened

Quite nice! Should've listened to the other reviewers and cut down on the lemon juice. Next time I'll probably use half. It does go directly to my recipe box, though.

This is a very good hollandaise recipe.  I doubled the recipe and only used 2 TBsp of fresh lemon juice and 1 cup of salted butter.  I did not add salt.  It had excellent flavor and consistency.  I will be using this again with changes.

Just a few small tweaks and it's PERFECT....  Use a meyer lemon, and reduce to 2-1/2 Tbsp.  Use unsalted butter  Reduce salt by half  My favorite eggs benedict addict has been ruined for life. He loves it!

This is a good receipe, but like everyone else, I too cut down the lemon juice.  I also only used 3 egg yolks (because that was all I had) and it turned out fine.  I followed the receipe and when I was tasting the final product thought "Oh no, this is way too salty!"  But, once I served it on the asparagus, it tasted fine.  Don't let the taste fool you before serving!  I will make this again.

I've made this recipe twice now, but because I'm only cooking for two, I had to cut it half both times. The Worcestershire came out too fast the first time, and not considering that, I still added salt! You can imagine what a salty mess it was! I was much more successful the second time. Even though I am normally a salt freak, after my last experience I didn't add any the second time around. Sure glad I didn't - it was still salty, but very easy and good. I'll probably make it again, cuz my BF LOVES Eggs Benedict!

In all fairness I can't rate this recipe because I didn't follow it the prescribed way. I didn't have lemon juice so I substituted by squeezing an orange into the sauce. The change was actually good!

Very easy to make. Didn't have a double boiler, but a metal bowl on top worked fine. Margerine makes a perfect substitute for butter. I would also add less lemon and perhaps more white pepper.

Way too much lemon juice ... I'd use only half the amount and use cold water for the other half to keep the consistency the same.  Tweek the recipe a bit and it would be great.

Since other people said it was very tart, I thought it would be fine for me as I like my hollandaise really lemony.  I was wrong- It was overpowering for me and will reduce lemon juice by about 1/2 next time. Besides that, it was great.

Too much lemon! Too zingy!! Not a smooth and creamy flavor.

To Avery's credit, the post did say "tart", which it was. A bit too tart for my taste, so I will add less lemon juice next time. Otherwise I thought this recipe was great. Mine thickened quite a bit, (maybe because I had one egg with twins) but adding one Tbsp. of water at the end worked perfectly! Though slightly modified, I will definitely make this again.

Easy and tasy.  Was a little too buttery flavored for my liking, but was still yummy.  I had a bit of  trouble getting it to thicken some, but it worked out great in the end.

Good but a little to much lemon
