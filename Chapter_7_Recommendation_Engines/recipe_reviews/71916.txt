This is a liver recipe, but it seems as if you could use other meats if you felt so inclined. It's a good recipe, we gobbled it up but it will taste like liver so if you don't like it, don't bother.  I made the recipe per the instructions with two changes. 1) I didn't have wine so I used water with a little dry sherry in it. 2) I baked the polenta in the oven while the rest was being made, it saved time and stress. In case you don't know how to, I prepped an oven safe dish with pam, preheated the oven to 350 and put in the broth and polenta (I skipped the milk, it wasn't necessary but you can substitute the broth for milk if you want creamier polenta). I stirred it up, baked it for about 40 minutes, stirred it once, added the cheese and that was that.  This was easy even with the work involved, I will make this again.

This is awesome. I used all chicken broth instead of wine and broth. I used couscous because I didn't have polenta.  The flavors are sharp, but not harsh and the chicken liver really plays well with the caramelized onions and the pungent cheese.

I made the polenta again tonight with the following changes:  double the amount of chicken broth; add 2 TBS butter; substitute parmesan cheese for the gorgonzola.  This version got a 5 star reception from DH who is not a big polenta fan.  This makes a very nice soft polenta.
