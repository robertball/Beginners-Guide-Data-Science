We loved this!  I had two chicken carcasses from last night and some sweet potatoes that needed to be used up, so I searched for chicken soup recipes with sweet potatoes and this was the best looking one.  (Healthiest looking one, I mean.)  I saved it!

I so enjoyed discovering and making your mother's soup. Thanks for sharing. Used the leftovers of a rotisserie chicken to make broth and for the meat. I didn't have parsnips, and only 2 sweet potatoes, but it worked wonderfully. I added a little curry which went very well with the sweet-salty theme. Used a potato masher to break up the sweet potatoes a little at the end. Very flavorful and satisfying! Will make again!

A very delicious, cozy soup. I made it using my leftover turkey and it still came out great! I would halve it if you just want to make it for four people, which is what I did. A good soup for when you are sick.

We used a whole head of garlic, about 5 small/med. red onions, & half a celeriac (instead of celery). We added a bit of poultry seasoning to the chopped chicken breast as we sautéed it. Then about a cup of white wine was added along with the chopped sweet potatoes. Added a generous half cup of chopped fresh dill but no salt & pepper while it was having its final 20 minutes of simmering.

This turned into a sticky stew for me. Next time I will cut the sweet potato, barley and chicken down to half of what was called for and hope for a soup. It tastes good though.

Awesome soup! May be the best I've ever made. I made a few variations: used cooked chicken, pre cooked barley, vegetable stock and dried dill. All turned out amazing. I definitely recommend this soup to anyone looking for a hearty bowl on a cold day

I thought this was fine overall flavorwise, but mine turned out more like a goulash. The barley absorbed all the liquid. I cooked it in a soup pot and the soup came to the top. I used rotisserie chicken for ease. For the 10 cups of broth I used an equal amount of water and 8 tsp of broth powder (the package called for 20 tsp). Anymore and it would have been too salty. I didnt add the optional parsnips or dill. I had 4 small sweet potatoes already baked. So, I just added them the last 10 minutes. I am wondering if a quick barley wouldnt be better. I think some instant or a little bit of regular rice would have been more to my liking. The barley was chewy, still after over 30 minutes, and a bit dominant in the soup.

This was a great variation of chicken barley vegetable soup. My kids loved the addition of sweet potatoes.

I used fresh chicken breast which I diced and sautéed in the olive oil. I also added black pepper and celery seed immediately. (No celery in the house!). The other changes I made were the addition of freeze-dried lemon grass and freeze-dried poultry seasonings. Not crazy about sweet potatoes so I used white potatoes. So it's BASICALLY the same soup. Lol

I followed this pretty much exactly including using parsnip.I split the recipe in half though. I did have to  add a cup or so more of stock. It is very good. 
I also added a little curry at the end and that really brought out the flavors even more so, though it is excellent as written as well.
