I've made this twice now, and both times it was a crowd hit - first thing gone from the table, and in record time.  I used extra sharp cheddar cheese.  The first time I cubed the cheese, the second time I shredded - both came out equally delicious.  I also added some parm cheese to the panko topping - it browned nicely in the oven and gave it that little bit of extra flavor.  I used a mix of 1/2 & 1/2 and whole milk in place of soy milk the 1st time, all skim milk the second time, and again, both were delicious (obviously the first was more rich).  If you're trying to save a few calories, I forgot the melted butter the 2nd time and nobody noticed.  Thanks so much for a wonderful mac & cheese recipe!

I do not think we would like the soy milk, could I substitute that with like 2% milk?  The whole recipe sounds yummy except for that part. :-(  Help Nana! lol

The taste was ok, but I didn't feel like the cheese distributed throughout the dish very well.  It melted, but it was right where the chunk of cheese was, it didn't spread.  Maybe I didn't cube it small enough, I'm not sure what went wrong.  I also used italian bread crumbs for the topping and 1% milk instead of soy.

It was very simple to make but dry and not creamy. I used garlic/herb bread crumbs and that was tasty...might look for another recipe.

I added ham and used 2% milk.  I've tried several mac and cheese recipes, and this is the only one that my husband has raved about--and not complained.  My 2 year old loved it as well.  I'll be doubling the next batch and freezing half in a cassarole dish for a quick and healthy week night meal!  Thanks for a great mac and cheese recipe!

This was okay.  It seemed a bit dry.  There was a lot leftover.  Not a good sign.

I agree with some of the other reviews: this is flavorless. The cheese should definitely have been shredded not cubed and perhaps quite a bit more cheese. Also there needs to be the addition of garlic powder, onion powder and maybe powdered mustard. Not sure as this dish is new to me. I can say for sure that the pasta should be cooked Al DENTE. And the flavorings should be added to the milk mixture before pouring over the pasta. I covered it in a casserole dish while cooking and I think that helped. Then cooked uncovered for about 10 minutes.

Made for Christmas dinner, only thing gone from the table! Used sharp cheddar, white cheddar and Colby-jack cheeses, mixes some parmesan with the breadcrumbs and was perfect!

I am not much of a mac n cheese fan, but really wanted to give a from scratch version a try. My husband typically only likes the from the box kind ( the color of that powdered cheese just grosses me out). This was a success! It was creamy and cheesy and a lovely side dish. It is hearty enough that it could be a meal on it's own with veggies and proteins thrown in.  Beware, the serving size seems off. The recipe made quite a large batch - I would think 8-10 good sized servings rather than the listed 4.

I cut down on several ingredients. I used 1 T of butter instead of 2. I used 1 1/2 C of almond milk. I left out Panko in order to cut down on carbs, and used 2 egg whites and brown rice gluten-free elbow pasta. Tastes great!

Great base recipe! I was looking for a loose guide to make Mac n Cheese the other night. I used pepper jack, mozzarella and sharp cheddar. I didn't have panko bread crumbs so I used Italian with some parmesan. I also added some onion powder and a little chili powder. I was experimenting! This recipe would also be great as is. I did find it to be a little too much butter, but I also read that someone did without any and it still worked well!

I love this recipe, I've made it a few times and I usually add mushrooms because I love mushrooms and it came out great! I also used regular milk since we never have soy milk around.

good. used soy milk as called for and as usual you wouldn't know the difference. i grated the cheese and added some parmesan in with the panko as well, as another review suggested. it was nicely cheesy and had a creamy texture. the only change i might make next time is to add something for a bit of kick!
