This was very good. I only did a couple of things different. I used shredded cheese (what I had on hand), I didnt add the water to the topping and added some horseradish and brown sugar to it (very tasty), and I poked holes in the top to give the cheese somewhere to go (its going to find a way out, so give it somewhere to go). The small amount of cheese that oozed out ended up on top of the meatloaf instead of the pan. Very nice change of pace for meatloaf. Thanks for the great recipe!!

I added 1 small minced onion, and garlic powder to this recipe. The other thing I would do would be to make sure the edges were sealed better because you do get some oozing out of the cheese. Also I would recommend cutting the water in half for the topping, and only putting on half as much topping altogether, because it runs off of the meat loaf and just ends up on the pan where it burns and makes it real hard to clean up. Other than that great taste, and with these few adjustments makes a great meal the family will absolutely love!!

This was very good.  I did change one thing.  Instead of ketchup and Worcestershire sauce, I used a prepared spaghetti sauce.  The only problem that I had was that the cheese oozed out of the meat during the cooking process...I wish more of it would have stayed in the roll.  But all in all, good and easy meal.  Thanks for the post.

I added 1/2 of a minced onion and 1 green pepper (be sure to drain the liquid).  I also added a pack of dried spices, used to marinate steak, to flavor the beef and give it some heat.  I used 8x3 pans, so I had to break the beef into 2 pans (same temperature and baked for 1 hour).  I used mozz with one pan and gouda with the other.  There was a lot of liquid in the pans after cooking, due to the veggies added, but those were easy to pour off or just remove the meatloaf from the pan before serving it.  We enjoyed the gouda cheese more than the mozz, but that's just personal preference.  Also made my own homemade BBQ sauce for on top.  I hardly ever use plain water in any recipe, why dilute the flavor of your food when you can enhance it.  All in all, this recipe is a good base to build a great recipe.  Mmmmmm, leftovers rock!

This recipe is AWESOME! I usually dont like meatloaf and have never been successful with it. I recommend cooking it for about 15 minutes longer than it says that way it hold better to the knife. I used shredded cheese. When it says rectangle I rolled it out to about 18 inces long and about 8 inches wide. Pinch the ends together so the cheese doesn't melt out the sides and poke holes in top. Get creative with the cheeses!

This would have quite bland on its own, so I added chopped onions, green peppers, Italian seasonings and garlic and onion powders. I also used marinara sauce instead of the catsup. Turned out great and will definitely make this again.

OK, so before I say anything else - I forgot the bread crumbs (duh!) I realized it aftr everything was rolled but, believe it or not, it still turned out great.  I did as other did and added some seasoning.  The sauce gave it a nice kick and, luckily, still adding the egg kept it from just tasting like a big burger.  I used shredded cheese and I think that made it easier to roll.  I also put the wax paper on a cookie sheet so that I could use it as a form - worked GREAT. This was easy and fun to make with my 9 year old son, and he loved it!

This is the best meatloaf I've ever made.  I hardly ever waste time making meatloaf, because our meatloaf has to have the right texture or we won't eat it.  This one is perfect.  It is very stout and not at all mushy.  Maybe due to the lack of milk in the recipe?  I did add garlic powder and chopped onion as recommended by other reviewers.  Thanks for a terrific recipe!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  It came out tastier than I imagined.   I enjoyed how easy it was to make and how few ingredients I needed.  Next time I make it, I will make sure to seal the edges or the roll since alot of the cheese "oozed" out while baking.  Thanks for the recipe, it's a keeper!

Very good.  Simple, flavorful, and filling.  I would suggest doubling the sauce and baste every 10-15 minutes or so.  The sauce is very good, it just thickens a lot while cooking.  By my third slice I was all out and the little lady wanted more.  I am interested in trying it with turkey to lighten it up a bit.  Reminds me of a recipe that I used to make ages ago that mixed three meats and was filled with mozzarella and parsley.  Might need to customize to re-create.  Cheers and enjoy!!!

Use 1/2 the water but great taste for a basic meatloaf. It's kind of creamy to needs something to give more body and chew maybe because all the water in the sauce.

I used pepper jack cheese and it was very good. The only problem I had was keeping it together. It seperated when it was cooked

I did my best to seal the ends, but the cheese leaked out through little tears in the sides. I think it will roll better if I grate it next time. My hubby does not like onions and loves cheese, so this was a meatloaf recipe he actually ate and said he wouldn't mind eating again. Although i followed suggestions to reduce the amount of water in the sauce, I just didn't care for it and will try something different next time.

Really very good!  Cut the recipe in half because there's only two of us.  Also, per reviews, added garlic powder, about 1/4 cup each finely diced onion and green pepper.  Also added about 1/2 tsp salt-free seasoning blend.  Reduced the water in the topping too.  End result was very tasty!  Could probably reduce the mozzarella a little bit and the topping as there was ample but will definitely make again!

This was a very good meatloaf. The only changes I made were adding some garlic and onion powder to the meat mixture. I also cut the water down to a 1/2 cup per some other reviewers. Will make again.

We cooked some chopped green pepper, garlic and onion until they were just beginning to brown, then mixed that in with the meat and used shredded mozzarella instead of slices.  Since a ketchup topping just tastes like (surprise!) ketchup and is better reserved for burgers, in my opinion, we used an 8oz can of tomato sauce with about a teaspoon of italian herbs for the topping.  This was one great meatloaf.

I didn't have any waxed paper, and I didn't dare to try to roll it with out it, so I decided to just mix shredded mozzarella cheese into the meat.  This was pretty good, I will probably try it again and roll it like the recipe says.

Very good!  I never make meatloaf because I remember the really scary ones my mom used to make, but my husband really likes it so I thought I'd give it a try.  It was a big hit even with a picky kid!  Rolling it wasn't too much of a problem, but I really flattened out the meat first.  I also used shredded cheese and sort of pressed it into the meat before I rolled it.  There was a minor cheese blowout at the top, but it wasn't too bad.

This sounds great, with the mozzarella rolled in but I found you do need to seal the ends of the loaf to stop most of the cheese melting out. I also made it with honey/mustard sauce and it was REALLY good.

Made this last night; I did saute some onion, garlic, and red and green bell pepper to add to the meat mix.  Used shredded cheese; for the topping used a little marinara mixed with the ketchup, no water.  It was so good!  Baked it on a cookie sheet/jelly roll type pan.  Will make again!

My family really liked this recipe, but I should have taken the advise of others that rated it and added garlic powder and onion to the meat prior to cooking.  I think it would be perfect then.  Will definitely make again with those changes.

I usually don't care for the texture of most meatloaf but this one was nice and firm. I did add some onions and garlic to the meat mixture. I had bits and pieces of sliced and shredded mozzarella and swiss so I just used them all. It turned out yummy and we'll be having this one again. Thanks for the recipe, Deb!

Ok, I grew up with a recipe very similar called Turkish Meat Roll. I personally think that this recipe needs a bit more spicing up with onion powder, garlic, etc. I also use crushed crackers instead of soft bread crumbs on occasion. I make sure to roll this up so that the seam is on the bottom because the cheese will ooze out if at all possible! I have also made this with swiss.

This is a really good meatloaf.  Instead of mozzarella I used Havarti cheese, almost any cheese would be good.  I mixed up half the amout of ketchup sauce, and it was still too much.  I would use less water too, equal amounts of water and ketchup is too thin.  This recipe is taking the place of my old standby.

This meat loaf was delicious.  My family loved it...everyone had seconds.

I made a couple of changes/additions: 

I added 1/2 pound of hot Italian sausage, half a  bell pepper(chopped), a small onion (chopped), about 1/2 cup of ketchup in the meat mixture.  

Thanks for submitting this recipe, Deb!  Kudos to you.

I think you will like this recipe.  It's really great.

I added fresh spinach the last several times that I've made this meat loaf.  It's delicious.

This is my absolutely my favorite meatloaf recipe.  Yes I had todo my own thing , and wow was it good.  Had the onions, peppers, fresh garlic and used seasoned panko crumbs, but the kicker I think was crumbled bacon scattered on top before you added the cheese.  My family loves, loves this meatloaf

O.k.  I made quite a few additions and it was very good.  I added 1/4 c. minced onion, 1/4 c. parmegan cheese, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1-2 tsp. basil and used 2 eggs.  Mixed meat together and spread pizza blend sheredded cheese and 1/4 c. chopped pepperoni in the center.  I used this sauce.  It was good, but felt it was too runny.  If I used it again, I would add less water.  I would also like to try pizza sauce on top too.  Very good.  Will made again.

This was good, but thought the meat could use more seasoning, such as garlic powder.

This was just the recipe I was looking for! It is like what a restaurant near my home serves, but healthier because I used 1 lb. ground turkey and 1/4 lb. turkey Italian sausage. Also, I made the glaze with spaghetti sauce (still using the Worcestershire) for a more Italian flavor.  I will definitely make this again.

my husband really likes it.  He says it beats the more "funky" versions of meatloaf  I have tried in the past.  Good traditional meatoaf with a hearty flavor.

I have never seen my family eat meatloaf eagerly.  They want me to make this again!  It was so easy, too.  I love how well the ketchup mixture coats the meatloaf, it makes such a difference.

This went over well for the whole crowd.  Only a few leftovers left!  My first and I covered it with spaghetti sauce before putting in the oven.
