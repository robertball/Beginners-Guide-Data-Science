Pretty good and very easy. I used whole wheat couscous, and didn't have sundried tomatoes (although i'm sure they would be awesome in this recipe). I just used some fresh tomato, and then added oregano and basil, along with a little EVOO. Will definitely be making this fast dish again.

I chopped an equivalent amount of peppercinis instead of bell pepper(food allergy), very good and a little spicy.

I used diced tomatoes instead of sun-dried and added some chicken to it to make it a whole one dish meal.  I also added chopped up artichoke hearts, onions, and sweet peppers.  Great and even better the next day cold.  Thanks for sharing.

Love this! The first time I couldn't figure out if the recipe meant 1 Cup before or after cooking the couscous. Second time I just added as much as I wanted. I also added some olive salad I had on hand that had cauliflower, celery, and capers. It added some zing.

Very easy to make...followed instructions first time but second making I sorta played it by ear, so to speak, and just threw it together. Came out even lovelier. My friend at work thought it was delicious-and I had her try both versions.

I made this for a company pitch-in, added some diced garlic stuffed olives and diced red onion. I used very little dressing, the oil from the sundried tomatoes and just a little of the kalamata olives is all you need. Will be making this again for family get togethers.
