2.23.17   I haven’t been baking much bread recently, so I had no bread flour on hand.  I used all purpose flour, but I know it would have been even better with bread flour.  Only one thing that I did differently.  As with any bread or pizza dough recipe I've ever made.  I mixed my yeast and sugar with 110ºF water and let it sit for 10 minutes or so until it was foamy/creamy.  Sooooo easy to make in the KA stand mixer, you just need to plan ahead,  The dough was very pliable and easy to work with.  I put one disc of dough in the freezer and topped today’s pie with olive oil, sliced brussels sprouts and red onion, crumbled bacon, and parmesan.  Definitely would make this recipe again, very happy with its texture and the  way it turned out.

My version of this recipe that worked for me• 2 cups of all purpose flour•1 cup of water•1 tsp kosher salt•1 whole packet of active eat•1 tbsp of sugar •1 tbsp olive oil x 2Heat the water up to body temp add sugar, stir till its dissolved then add the yeast. While it’s bubbling up. Scoop your flour into a bowl, add salt and mix.  Pour the yeast water into the bowl, add 1 tablespoon olive oil, mix. You don’t need to mix it for 10 mins if it’s all purpose flour which is what I had in my pantry 3 mins work enough. Cover the bowl with cling wrap and put a tea towel over it, let it rest for at least an hour. When hour is up, Heat your over to 500F. Once dough has rested, flour your counter, and coat rolling pin, spread dough out with rolling pin to desired thickness. Proceed to transfer the dough to pizza cookie sheet, then assemble your pizza with sauce, cheese, & toppings ( before you put in the oven coat the rim of the dough with remaining olive oil ). Bake for 10-15 mins on the bottom shelf of your oven. This makes 1 large pizza.

I added butter instead of oil, 1 1/2 teaspoon of dry milk, and 1 1/4 teaspoon of fast rise yeast. I too mixed my yeast and sugar with 110ºF water and let it sit for 10 minutes. I did mix dough in bread machine and let it my rise 30 minutes before making my pie.  You will get a chewy pizza crust which my family enjoys.

I made it as the recipe stated and it works wonderful. I use the dough on my outdoor pizza oven or on my pellet grill, it works great for both!
