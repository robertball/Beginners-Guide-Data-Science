This was very good. I did change it a little though. Used 1/2 cup of chopped onion. Sorry, a tablespoon just isn't worth it and you won't get any flavor out of it. I also used an entire small can of chopped chilies. I took this to book club and it was the first dish completely gone! Served it with the scoop Fritos. YUM!

OMG - this was so good.  My family just sat around the table dipping Tostito chips in.  Yum!  I did not shred the chicken, just cut it into really small chunks and cooked it first in the frying pan, then added the rest of the ingredients as per the recipe.

Good queso, but it may as well have been the basic Rotel variety.  Processed cheese is processed cheese, no matter how you dip it.

I totally agree about the onion.  My original submission had close to 1/2 cup of onion, but somehow it got lost between there and posting.

This was excellent.  I left out the chicken as I didn't have any but it was still very, very good.

This was fantastic!!! My children love Carlos O'Kelly's queso so this was a HUGE hit! I omitted the chicken and substituted a can of drained rotel tomatoes for the diced tomato and green chilies because that's what I had on hand. Will try the recipe as written next time :)

OH MY this was so good!  This IS the Ultimate Cheese Dip.  I love the addition of chicken in this.  It was great served on the side and dipping chips in.  But I bet it would be so good poured over chips to make some nachos or as a base for taco salad.  Next time I may add in a block of cream cheese just to see how much richer and creamier I can get it.  Thanks for this yummy recipe!  UPDATE: I have made this a few times now and it is so good!  I do always add in a bit of cream cheese (maybe half a block to a full 8 oz. block to the full recipe, depending on how cheesy I want it).  I really think it turns it up a notch.  Most times if I want just a good cheese dip I make this without the chicken in it and it makes an excellent queso cheese dip.  I do add a bit more onion.  Also this was great to heat up and stay warm in a crockpot.  This is my favorite all time queso dip!  Thanks again for the recipe!

This was an excellent dip.  The only thing that I did differently was add more onions and additional salsa to give it a little zing.

Easy and good! Made this Sunday for the Giants game and it was well received.  Would definitely make again.  One guest asked to take the remainders home which I sent in a tupperware...she loved it that much that she wanted it for the next day!

Love this recipe, but with changes. I used about 10 oz of cooked chorizo instead of chicken and, like others, 1/2 cup of onion and the whole can of the chilis.  I also used a spicier salsa.  It was so good.

This was ok. Too much garlic in my opinion (my guests agreed). Was creamy and had some good chunks of tomato/chili which I like.

I loved this recipe!  My husband thought it needed a little bit more heat and less chicken, so next time I will use medium or hot chiles and a little less chicken.  Thanks for a great recipe that will be used often at our house.

I love, love, love this recipe. I make regularly and often get asked for the recipe. A few simple changes I make is I double the garlic, and I also add a 4oz can of jalape√±os along with the can of chilies. This gives it just a little spice.

I found this to be just cheesy, not the flavor I thought it would be.

This was good. I did not put the chicken in it.  Left it as more of the queso.

This was really good Queso, but I did add more onion than called for and next time I think I will try decreasing the amount of sour cream, as it seemed to be too predominant for our tastes.  We also did not add the chicken although I think that would be a great addition.  Thanks for sharing this tasty recipe, Patty2007!
