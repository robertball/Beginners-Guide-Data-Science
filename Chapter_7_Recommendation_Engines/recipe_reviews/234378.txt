Delicious!!! Cooked on high for 5 hours. Just for fun I used Chili seasoning pack instead of taco. Thank you for the recipe, will definitely use this in the future.

Jay's Spicy Turkey Chili Haiku: "Ooo-wee it is spicy! The few things I didn't have, I will do next time!" So I was out of chipotles in adobo, and I either mis-read the ingredient list, or maybe I was just plain OK w/ having used 3 small 4 oz. cans of diced green chiles. Used a small 8 oz. tomato sauce instead of tomato soup to avoid it possibly being too watery, as we like our chili thick-thick-thick. And I sauteed the onion (along w/ some minced garlic) as the turkey browned. Even w/o the adobo/chipotles, this was a fiery chili, but not so much that it killed any taste enjoyment. W/ cheese and Frito scoops, this was killer chili, and even better as leftovers the next day.

Delicious, but over-the-top spicy for me, who loves spice.  I will cut the chili powder to 2 TBLS.  Also, I added 1/2 cup chicken broth because mixture was too dry.

I don’t like beans. I added an extra pound of turkey instead of the beans. I also subbed the canned green chili’s with 2 fresh jalapeños. When I put it all in the crock pot it was a little dry. I added 1 cup of water and cooled on high for 4 hours. It was awesome! Not too spicy, but had a nice kick. Served on top of a layer of Fritos and added mixed cheese. Sooo good for a cold winter meal.

Excellent recipe! A little too spicy with both the chipotle peppers in adobo and the cayenne so added a can of broth and some corn starch to thicken. I also used only 2 of 3 cans of the green chiles. Still plenty spicy but delicious! For next time: skip the cayenne, use the whole can of black beans and make a double batch of cornbread to go with. Thanks for sharing Jay. This is now my go to chili recipe.

I'm rating it 5 stars because it's true to its name and needs no revisions. Now that doesn't mean I didn't revise it. First, I used Trader Joe's Ground Beef-less instead of Turkey and a 14. oz can of Tomato Sauce instead of Tomato soup. The only hot spices I used were Bill Echols (Allrecipe member) Taco Seasoning recipe and 1/2 Tbsp Chilies in Adobe. I did not brown the meat- less or cook the onions. I put everything in the crock pot, onion, garlic, meat, beans added seasonings and stirred it up while crock pot was on high then I added the tomato sauce, covered and cooked on low all day. It was perfectly thick and just spicy enough for my young crew.

Yummmmy! I made this pretty much as is but I used extra black beans instead of kidney and added some frozen corn at the end. I also added a can of water but it didn't make it soupy. This chili was spicy and delicious. I ate it for lunch with cornbread and I think it will be even better when I heat it up tomorrow!

Did make one change, that is only because I used very lean meat, added about a cup of chicken stock. Fabulous!  Garnished with a blend of Mexican cheese , jalapeno slices and avocado. 
Can't wait for leftovers. Delish

So good! I made it for a family potluck and everyone raved about it!  I was nervous about the spiciness in a group like that, so I opted not to include the adobo chiles; however, I will definitely include them the next time I make it just for my family!  Also, I used two cans of diced chiles simply because I misread the initial recipe! I will definitely be making this again, as will half the people at the potluck who asked for the recipe!

Delish! I made it for a group of friends and they now request it all the time. It is spicy but SO good! I don’t use adobo sauce and I add a can of corn just because we like having it in our chili. Make with corn bread and it is FANTASTIC! Definitely one of my hubby’s favorite meals!

FABULOUS and so easy to make.  I never would have considered using condensed tomato soup, but it's perfect.  The chipotles give a rich deep flavor.  I love spice!  I used non fat Greek yogurt at the end in place of sour cream.  Then I added . some shredded cheddar cheese on top.  Will be making all the time now!

Best chili I have had, just the right amount of spice.
