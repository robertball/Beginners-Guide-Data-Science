Very unexpected!!I modified the recipe bit. I tried the recipe exactly but not enough crunch. So I took some cornmeal, about 1 cup and added an egg and about 1/3 cup beer. Toss cucumber slices in the dry mix and then in the wet. Then fry. Fantastic! I had some mexican squash in the fridge and used those as well. My family was hesitant at first (who ever heard of fried cucumbers, after all)With some ranch dressing or try some ketchup with a bit of hot sauce mixed in. Could not keep up with demand!! Thanks for the recipe.

I rate this recipe a 4 stars because it is good but I did make a few adjustments. I did peel and slice the cucumber as stated in the directions. Then I seasoned the cucumbers with some garlic salt and onion salt and pepper to taste. After that, I tossed the cucumbers in cornmeal for the crunch, then I tossed them in flour to completely coat the cucumbers. I fried them until really golden brown. I thought they came out awsome like this!!!!

This was surprisingly good!! I modified the recipe I used a dry mix of italian bread crumbs, flour and garlic powder. Peeled and cut the cucumber lentgh-wise tossed them in the batter cooking in a deep fryer. Simple excellent quick snack served with ranch or asiago peppercorn dip. My husband agreed it was better than fried green tomatoes.

Our family has enjoyed these for years but we usually cut them lengthwise, dip them in beaten egg with a little milk and then ZESTA cracker crumbs. Add salt and pepper and these are like vegetable steak to me mmmmmm! You have to have the oil fairly hot to start with and keep it hot or they will absorb the grease, then drain on paper towels.

Surprisingly good! I don't have cornmeal on hand, so I use some Bisquick baking mix instead and it comes out terrific. Eat it while it's hot!

I wasn't too impressed with the texture of the cornmeal and it didn't stick too good. Next time I'll work them up like I do zucchini. I'd cut the cucumbers about 1/4 inch thick, sprinkle with salt and garlic powder, do a coating with corn starch, then dip in water, then into panko or Italian seasoned bread crumbs. I'd rather bake at 375 for 15-20 minutes than fry and serve with salsa. Great idea and inspiration!

This was an okay recipe. I took the advice of some other posters and tweaked it a little. I dipped the sliced & peeled cucumbers in an egg, then dipped them in a mixture of flour, breadcrumbs, parsley, paprika, garlic powder, and salt. Fried them in a skillet in vegetable oil. They are a pretty finicky veggie to fry. Make sure you don't overcook. The thinner the slice, the crunchier (and less soggy/mushy) the end product. I recommend changing the oil throughout the process, the ones that tasted the best were the ones that were done in fresh oil (not the oil that i had already fried 10 cucumber slices in). Next time I will add Parmesan cheese to the mixture, I think it would make it a lot better.

I made this exactly as instructed and it was alright but nothing exciting. I never fry anything and I never use cornmeal so I think it was just my taste and inexperience. I will try again using some of the ideas from other posters and hopefully it will be as I hoped.

update: So tonight I gave this another try but changed it a bit. I sprinkled garlic powder on the cucumbers then coated it in corn meal, then dipped in water and then bread crumbs. I then sprinkled with salt and pepper and baked for about 20-25 minutes on 375! they came out sooooo much better. More flavor and crispy instead of soggy. This way is worth 5 stars I think!

I would have never thought to fry cucumbers in the fashion of green tomatos. I had to add my own tweaking to the breading and seasoning there in, BUT this is a really good recipe I loved it and will make again... THANK you for sharing such a GREAT idea....

Not as tasty as I'd hoped. I used another post's breading idea (corn meal, then egg, then italian bread crumbs) and that was good. Just not a fan of warm mushy cucumber.

Okay I admit that as I read the recipe and I knew immediately that cornmeal would not adhere to the cucumber  without liquid. So I mixed some buttermilk and egg together to soak the cucumber. After about 15 minutes of soaking,  I transferred the buttermilk and egg mixture to a flat dredging bowl and mixed some Cornmeal with Seasoned Flour into another dredge bowl.  I then drudeged the cucumber in the buttermilk mixture, in cornmeal mixture and repeated the process; shaking off the cornmeal mixture before frying over med. heat . PERFECT Appalachian cooking

I tried as the recipe said, but used garlic flavored bread crumbs. Was not impressed, most of the bread crumbs came off in the skillet. I dipped the rest in egg then bread crumbs and they were great! Added a little horseradish sauce to the ranch and it was pretty good! My daughter wouldn't even try it - ew cucumbers  - but my husband did try it. We aren't really cucumber fans and I wouldn't make it again, but it was good.

Made as instructed, looked great, tasted not so great, was not a fan of the cucumber itself, the texture was too mushy/slimy, & it did not really have the crunch I was looking for.  I wouldn't make this again

I made it exactly as stated,,,well, I added garlic salt as it was cooking.  I felt it took forever to cook, probably because of the water.  It was good though.
