I made this and the end result was tasty. I love sweet and spicy combo. I live in NJ where blueberries are grown and are awesome so I sought out a recipe to use my massive stock of the yummy fruit. I made no substitutions but I have two suggestions for cooking instructions for novices like me. First I did not anticipate how dry the marinade would be. I would suggest mixing all dry ingredients first before adding oil. I marinated for 24 hours and the chicken really absorbed all those spicy flavors. Second, I had no idea that the cider vinegar would cause the heated sugar to turn into rock candy. I tossed the first attempt thinking I did something wrong. Second attempt I pulled off heat sooner but still had hard globs of sugar. I then spent about ten minutes on and off heat trying to dissolve completely. Eventually it worked and achieved beautiful syrupy consistency of heated blueberries. I followed directions exactly so not sure if problem was my stove. But in the end it was good but a little frustrating along the way.

Fantastic mix of flavors.  And so easy.  I did cut the spices in 1/2 (and only 1/8 tsp of Cayenne) but kept the 1 T of oil.  I was nervous about the spiciness based on other reviews.  I'm glad I did.  It was plenty spicy and the blueberry sauce was a nice compliment to the spice.  I used 3 chicken breasts (weigh 1.7 lbs total) and butterflied them.  Let marinate in rub for about 3 hours.  The trick I learned for the blueberry sauce is to use a big enough sauce pan so you have a very thin layer of sugar on bottom and it melts all at same time.  If not, I had part of my sugar getting very dark underneath and sugar on top not melted.  After I added vinegar (I used red wine vinegar because it is what I had and it work splendidly) I had stirred but added the blueberries and let the small shell of hard sugar melt while the blueberries cooked.  I didn't add salt or pepper to blueberries because I didn't think they need it.  Family loved it.  Thanks for sharing!

Not for the faint of heart. The chicken is extremely spicy. The blueberry sauce really helps to tone down the heat but I would reduce the spice a little next time.

We rate it "extremely yum."
Made it exactly as written. This is unusual around our house. (Well, we used canned chipotles and therefore skipped the cayenne.)The blueberries and garlic were fresh from the market. It was fascinating to watch the sugar...I didn't know it did that. We call it "Boobs 'n' Bloobs."

I'm glad one of the reviewers mentioned that the marinate (more of a wet rub) was not a typical marinate that "drips" off. I rubbed it in, put the covered chicken in the fridge overnight, then rubbed it off before cooking.  It was spicy, but had a great flavor. The blueberry sauce was overwhelmed by the apple cider vinegar. I left the mashed blueberries in the sauce because I couldn't bear to throw them out, but there still wasn't  a blueberry taste.  I absolutely loved the concept of sweet and spicy, but I think maybe lemon juice would be a better fit with the blueberries. The sauce definitely needs some tweaking.

Made it as-is and it came out deliciously. The blueberry flavor is subtle and subdues the spices nicely. I will definitely make this again in the future.

I will make it again.  Only difference I made was more oil in the  marinade because it just didn't seem to be enough  for the 3 large chicken breasts I had on hand.  Grilled them to as close to 165 degrees as I could get and they were absolutely delicious....moist on the inside and spicy on the outside.  The blueberry gastrique gave it a nice touch.  But since the chicken was so good on its own, I won't go out of my way to make the gastrique again.

Man is this a great recipe all six people in the family loved it!  That’s no small trick. 
I bet if you changed the blueberries to cranberries,
It would be a hit at Christmas!!!!

I made the sauce with lemon juice instead of vinegar.  Otherwise I  followed the recipe. It was flavorful, moist and easy to make.

The sauce is what makes this recipe work.  I used my own favorite rub seasoning to marinade the chicken breasts.  Also, proper doneness is key -- to keep the chicken moist, don't overcook.  Result is a true eye-appealing, mouth-watering, very tasty meal.  Served with a garlic herb rice pilaf, garlic-parmesan grilled tomato, and paired with an Australian Shiraz.  OMG -- YUMM!!

Made this twice now , what a quick and easy dish that looks like you've spent much more effort than it takes. 
Marinated in the rub over night, and made the sauce while the chicken was on the grille. 
The sweet and the heat really high lite the dish but the visual is almost as appealing. 
A new summer lunch favorite.

The combo of sweet and spicy is great!  I wouldn't change a thing.  I'm going to try it with a different fruit next.

Yes, I made changes.  Basically I used the same ingredients but add a lot of vegetables - spinach, carrots, broccoli, mushrooms, and I did not BB-Q.  I cut up the chicken and sautéed  it in a fry pan.  Removed the chicken and put in all the spices, 2 chipotle peppers in adobo sauce and vegetables except the spinach.  When the veggies were almost done I put the chicken back in the fry pan and added the spinach and blueberries.  I served it over quinoa with yogurt on the side.  Be careful with the chipotle peppers , they are hot!

Every salty! Next time  I will cut the salt to 1 1/2 tsp. I hate to strain things as it makes a mess, so I ran the sauce in my vitamix, sauce was thick and I didn’t have such a mess

I loved this recipe, after reading reviews I didn’t marinade as long but still a lot of spice to it. The only thing I changed was instead of the vegetable oil I used two tbs olive oil and that worked perfect. Loved it and the sauce was definitely the added bit it needed!

The sauce was delicious but the chicken was a tad too spicy.  I'll cut the cayenne in half next time.  I'll definitely make this again.

Easy to make, super yummy, even the 9 and 7 year old liked it. Left out the chipotle pepper and only used 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper so not too spicy for the boys. Will definitely make again.

This was really good.  I  had blueberries and had chicken and when I searched the two ingredients, I  didn't actually have high hopes of finding anything. and yet, VOILA! I did make a couple of changes, as a result of not having chipolte pepper, I don't have it.  I used jalapeno pepper, which I did have and a sprinkling of cajun flavour.   When I made the blueberry sauce, when I first did it, I had the same issue as another reviewer, the sugar went super hard and I couldn't use it.  I threw it away and used brown sugar.  Worked perfectly.  I also went with a recommendation  and I used lemon juice instead of vinegar.  I liked the idea of lemon with blueberry more than apple....personal preference.  Chef John, great recipe and very creative.  Thanks so much.  I gave it 4, only because of the sugar issue.  I watched the video, I do not know why it didn't work.

I will definitely make this again.

This was my first experience making a blueberry sauce, and it turned out beautifully. The seasoning on the chicken complimented the sauce to perfection.

A winner. Definitely will make again. Very tasty. I baked in oven at 350 degrees for about 45 minutes. Fixed everything according to recipe but did not marinate. Just fixed chicken, poured sauce over it and baked it.

Such a tasty and interesting recipe.  My family loved it.  Paired with baked broccoli and cheesy biscuits for a simple and fairly healthy meal.

This was delicious.  Great combo of sweet and spicy. I made it according to the recipe.  I would give it a 7 on the spice chart. Will most definitely make this again.

Good dish...not mind blowing but good and different.  Rub was very flavorful and pretty easy to make...but you need to like heat...I used "smoked" paprika which i think give it an additional dimension of flavor.  Also made 3 X as much as it didn't seem like original amount would be enough...we had about 2-3 lbs of chicken both Breast and Thighs boneless/ skinless which I think makes it even better.
BB sauce was very good but tasted a little bit like a fruit roll up...maybe could just heat up BB jelly too...tasted a bit like breakfast but tasty !  Different and fun

The sweet and spicy went together very well.  I will cut down on some of the spice on the chicken a tad next time tho.  Will make this again for sure.

I think Chef John left an ingredient out of the marinade, as when I combined the ingredients listed it was all crumbly. I added 1/2 cup chicken stock to liquefy it and make it a marinade. The chicken came out saltier than we care for, but not inedible, so I would cut the salt in the marinade in half for the future. The chicken is quite spicy, so be careful - eliminate the cayenne or reduce the ground chipotle to 1/2 teaspoon if you want - we took it full strength, but we enjoy spicy food. Took a little bit to get the gastrique right - I burned the first batch of sugar. Also, I ended up really cooking down the syrup after working the blueberries through the mesh strainer as it was way too thin.  Having said that, it was a hit and it is going into the summer must do recipe file.

Loved this recipe - but I did exactly what I hate when other people write reviews. I changed the recipe... I used less salt and cayenne pepper, substituted chile powder for the ground dried chipotle pepper and didn't let it marinade. It was delicious. Loved the blueberry sauce (even though my son complained about the vinegar smell it created!).

I have a very similar recipe but w/out the spiciness. I tried Chef Johns and it is amazing, but too spicy for my individual tastes so I stuck w/ my recipe the next go round, lol. My recipe called for a rub of lemon peel/ lemon juice, salt, garlic and ground pepper. His Blueberry sauce though is superior to mine any day. Hats off to you Chef!!
