Sounds yummy and super easy, but stupid question: Is the chicken thigh supposed to be cooked before you put it in the rice cooker, or is it raw when it goes in and cooks with the rice?

I wasn't expecting this to be that good, but it was easy.  It really surprised me.  It was SO good.  I used basmati rice because that's all I had.  I also added a splash of soy sauce and used chicken broth instead of water and bullion cubes.  It tasted like fried rice!  I have tried and tried to make fried rice, and it never comes out right.  This is the way to do it.  Next time I'm going to add some veggies and more soy to make it even more like fried rice.  Save a LOT of fat by cutting out the olive oil completely.  It is absolutely not necessary.

I made this last night to go with my curry chicken dish. 
It was very easy and had great flavor.
I did not use the extra olive oil because I was worried it would be too greasy. So I just used the seseame oil as instructed and it was perfect! 

It was flavored of roasted garlic and scallions but still subtle enough to go with any dish!

Thank you, this will definitely be a regular!

Oh, i love it!!brings back childhood memories. this is an authentic Filipino dish called Arroz Caldo, but usually cooked with a little more liquid...similar to Risotto. You may substitute water,olive oil, and bouillon with chicken stock. you may add salt and pepper. dont know what to do with chicken??? cut into thin strips and saute, or boil and shred...then mix in with the rest of the ingredients. **i would not recommend using chicken breast as it lacks a bit of chicken flavor and very dry meat**

This was super easy and tasty, though I modified it a bit.  Like other reviewers, I omited the olive oil and was glad I did.  I doubled the garlic, added half a bunch of green onions and four boneless, skinless chicken thighs (roughly chopped into bite size pieces).  I also used chicken broth in place of the water/boullion and added 2 Tbl. soy sauce.  Everything cooked perfectly and it tasted great topped with a little chili sauce (sambal oelek) and extra soy sauce to taste.

This was easy and surprisingly delicious!  I made a few changes based on what I had on hand.  I used two cups of rice and three cups of chicken stock that I had leftover from a batch of Hainanese chicken rice.  I skipped the olive oil but used four chicken thighs.  I put in about five minutes of work and then closed the lid and pushed a button.  25 minutes later I fed my family a delicious dinner.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was an amazing dish for the amount of effort you put into it. It tastes just like Hainanese chicken rice (express style). The house smelled so good while it was cooking because all the ingredients were steaming together. I made the recipe without changes but will probably marinate the chicken in some oyster sauce next time for extra flavor. The rice was awesome as is. Definitely a keeper for a quick dinner option.

I used a sweet onion instead of green onion and chicken broth instead of bouillion because I'm on a tight budget and have to work with what I have on hand. The chicken thigh wasn't really needed this time because I served this with chicken. YUM! NOTE TO SELF: This would be good with a chinese main dish next time.

my goodness, i think this recipe is amazing! for how simple it is, i'm still shocked that it tastes so good. it has a chinese flavor to it because of the ginger and sesame oil and i think i could eat the whole dish. i left out the chicken because i was using the rice dish as a side to a roasted chicken. next time i'll 1/2 the amount of olive oil. super good!

this had ok flavor, and was greasy from the sesame oil. I followed the recipe as written, only I halved the recipe and had to put it back into the rice cooker and add more water because the rice wasn't done and all the liquid was absorbed. There is not enough liquid in proportion to the rice in this recipe. The liquid should DOUBLE  the portion of rice  because rice exands as it cooks.

This was the most flavorful dish I've ever made.  I didn't have olive oil, so I substituted it with canola oil.  I didn't have chicken bouillion either.  I added some saffron for a little coloring and it was still great.

I love the the idea of making a whole meal in the rice cooker.  Now that I know it's possible, I will be experimenting more with it.  Frozen peas and chopped cilantro were added before serving to lend color and extra flavor.

Since finding this recipe, my husband and I have made it several times. We ended up modifying the original recipe a bit by omitting the olive oil and adding 2 boneless chicken thighs (sometimes 3!). The juice and oils from the extra dark meat give the rice an extra boost of flavour so only now we only do 1 chicken bouillon as well. Can't go wrong with this and so easy!

I was looking for a recipe specifically for jasmine rice since I had bag of it for some reason. This recipe had truly great flavor. I cooked it over a gas stove since I don't have a rice cooker and was skeptical about it at first. Sauteed the garlic and onions first, then rice, added the other ingredients but replaced fresh ginger with 1 t powdered ginger, I also didn't have a chicken thigh but the bouillon cube works well if you don't mind the increased sodium. I only got to eat a small serving of it before my husband and son devoured it!

Tastes ok but I did not like the amount of oil. It made it very greasy. It was like having fried rice in a rice cooker. I will not make it again.

Used as a side dish so no chicken. Mostly followed recipe. 2 green onions rather than 1. 3 garlic cloves, next time 4. Peeled ginger root, smashed, chopped then squeezed through a hand held garlic press. Only 1/4 cup olive oil. My daughter is 1/2 Asian and grew up with rice - recommends adding butter next time. Then I noticed that there's a glob of butter in the photo but none in the ingredients. Added 1 tablespoon of soy sauce after tasting the finished product. This is the best rice cooker recipe I've tried so far to liven up rice in the rice cooker. Definitely will make often and experiment with the ingredients.

Really good, although I cooked the rice separatly cooked onion chicken and garlic in a pan with some oil till chicken was cooked and then added the seasonings and finally added the rice and cooked until rice was fried.

I modiefied this recipe a bit, to use what I had on hand. I dont have a rice cooker, so did this on the stove top with minute rice. I sauteed some onions at the start, added the rice, coated it with sesame oil, and added the rest of the ingredients. Very easy and flavorful recipe, went very well with the Sage Pork Chops on here!!

this rice was really good, although i didn't taste much garlic.  however i used minced garlic because i had it on hand as opposed to the smashed garlic - maybe that's what made a difference?  anyhow, still good and i'll definitely make it again, with more garlic next time!

This rice was delicious! I followed the recipe (minus the onions-because I was rushed and forgot-and the chicken) and served it with sesame chicken. My guests and family loved it! I have never even considered adding anything to my rice while it was cooking. Maybe I'll try something of my own soon. :)

Absolutely delicious!! This fragrant rice makes a perfect side dish for every main dish.  Small changes though... I entirely omitted olive oil since I wasn't looking for "fried" rice. I added frozen corns and peas and the rice looked and tasted much better!!

Easy to make, and tastes great!  I did sautee the garlic, ginger and chicken in the pan for a bit to give the chicken a little extra time to brown / cook and then I added the rest of the ingredients.  
I have made this multiple times!

The flavor was good, but for some reason my rice was still crunchy. I am  not discounting some mistake on my part causing the problem though.

We used less oil, more chicken (breast) and a little extra onion and thought it was great served with steamed Asian veggies.  Simple but good.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was delicious! I didn't use the chicken thigh or the olive oil. I added just a wee bit soy sauce to taste after it was done. This is definitely a dish I'll be trying again and again.

This was awesome and so easy! I would have never thought of cooking chicken in our rice cooker. We added 2 chicken thighs, peas (could probably add more veggies), and a bit of soy sauce. We used none of the olive oil and it turned out great.

This is my first time making jasmine rice and it was pretty good. I halved the olive oil and it was still too much. So next time I'll use a lot less. I don't have a rice cooker and did it on the stove. The kids even loved it. I will try again to perfect this. Thanks.

This tasted pretty good, though it is difficult to cook if you have a small rice cooker.

I made this exactly the way it was written and it turned out fantastic.  Great flavor, wonderful aroma and very easy to make.  My 6 and 3 yr old both ate it up!  We had parmesan chicken and asparagus and this rice as a side dish. Wife and I had a little white wine.  Delicious. When I make it again I plan to cut the olive oil a little, add more garlic and another green onion.  Just my personal taste.  Give this one a try.
