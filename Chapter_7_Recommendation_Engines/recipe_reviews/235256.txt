Great filling!  I used chives instead of green onions and upped the cumin to 2 tsp. I also used taco sized flour tortillas, brushed on olive oil and baked at 425 for 15 min instead of frying. Oh yum!

This was great.  I omitted the cumin and oregano and added onion powder and cilantro, and a little diced jalapeño.  I found that flour tortillas held together better than corn but both were yummy.  I think the fresh tomatoes really set this recipe apart from typical, processed- tasting make at home Mexican meals.  
I cooked my chicken alone in a crock pot to ensure it shredded nicely, a trick I use all the time.  
I would definitely make this again!

The filling is unbelievable delicious. It was tricky to dip the tortillas in hot oil and then fill, etc., easy,  but tricky. The filling stayed inside the tortillas while being fried, due to the way it was cooked. I didn't have tomatoes, so I added green pepper instead. The flavor was amazing, I'll be adding this to the rotation and playing around with adding things to the filling. At some point, I will try avocado, cilantro, cheese, and/or beans in this recipe.

This filling is GREAT! if it were just the filling I would give this 5 stars(more if I could). However, it could just be that corn tortillas hate me, but in any case the tortillas just broke. What I ended up doing was using the filling to make burritos, with flour tortillas, and then baked.

Definitely love this recipe, the moisture of the chicken and ingredients inside the corn tortilla were great.  Maybe just a touch more salt though.  Did the initial frying of the tortilla to get soft but finished off in the oven.  Worked out great!!!  Crispy and beautiful!  Served with an avocado sauce :)

Super yummy! My whole family loves this dinner and begged for more. I followed another persons suggestion and brushed vegetable oil on top and baked them and they were delicious!

LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe. My boyfriend is very picky and he even loved it. The only things I changed was half the amount of tomatoes and I used egg roll wraps instead of tortillas. I rolled them like spring rolls. So delicious!

This is recipe is spot on. The filling was delicious.  I had no issue rolling the tortillas after frying them for a little bit, like other people have mentioned.  I will definitely make this again!

Husband said that they were the best he has ever had, I made a few changes. We like things spicy so I added 2 diced fresh jalapeños. I cooked the chicken covered with water in my instapot ( electric pressure cooker) then steamed the corn tortillas, making them easier to role, then popped them in the air fryer. And served with salsa. Soooo good!

These are very good and have a great crunch! I skipped the dipping of the tortilla before the full fry as the first try was a bit messy and it worked out just fine without.

Good way to use up leftover chicken! Very flavorful but no matter how hard I tried I couldn't roll them tight enough to be a taquito to me.

My family loves this dish!!  I brush a little oil on the rolled taquitos and bake at 425 F like other reviewers mention.  They turn out great every time!  A definite keeper!

I followed this recipie exactly, except the cooking method. I used small flour tortillas and rolled and lightly sprayed them with olive oil before baking for 15 minutes at 425 (as recommended by another reviewer). They were good but we all found them to be underseasoned. I will definitely make this recipie again, but will at least double the seasoning. Thanks for the recipie, they were great in my kids thermoses for lunch at school!

I made these tonight, and they were grand!  I made some alterations; I used skin on, bone-in chicken thighs that I baked instead of poaching.  That's what I had on hand; of coarse I removed the skin and bone.  I used a tablespoon of garlic, and doubled the cumin; did not use oregano as there was none on hand.  I followed the lead of the other reviewers and baked instead of fried.  They were crispy, and a little chewy and greasy.  Served with homemade guacamole.   Maybe I will reduce the amount of oil I brush on them next time.  My husband is a first generation Mexican-American from the Rio Grande valley; he ate five.

The filling was amazing. The only changes I made were to add cheese and I baked them instead of frying them. Family thought these were great.

I made recipe as stated.  Delish!    For all the people making these with flour tortillas instead of corn they are now flautas not taquitos.     I’ve made them with flour tortillas before also.   Just as delish!

I thought this recipe was very bland as it is.  I modified it quite a bit to get it to where we enjoyed the concept.  I doubled all the spices and added jalapeno peppers to the chicken mixture.  Also added cheese to the rolls before cooking the whole taquito. Also, the  2nd time around I eliminated the frying and opted to bake the taquitos instead.  This made them much less greasy and  I did not need to use toothpicks to keep everything inside.
