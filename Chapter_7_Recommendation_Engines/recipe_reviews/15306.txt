This recipe is a real crowd pleaser. I added 2 1/2 cups of the whole cranberry sauce instead of the cranberries, apple juice and sugar. The dressing was delicious. I used a rub of sage, rosemary, salt, garlic, shallots and olive oil on the roast.  The house smelled great! My roast didn't take as long to cook either, at 7.75 pounds, but I was keeping an eye out, so it turned out moist and tender.  I laid some apples cut in half on the rack with the roast when cooking, and put them on the outside of the platter when serving.  Made quite the presentation, bone booties and all!

One Rib per person was fine,  Delete the egg and apple juice in the stuffing if the bread crumbs are fresh.
I found the roast overcooked when it reached 175 internal temperature.  Next time I would take it out at 155-160 and let it rest for 15 minutes.  The temperature should go up 5 degrees in resting.

The dressing recipe here was good. I have always loved roast pork and crown roasts for the festivity of it. As I read the recipe, it seemed 375 degrees was a high temperature for cooking meat. I cooked it for the exact amount of time since I did not have a meat thermometer. My roast was 10 lbs and it still came out quite dry. My oven has an accurate temperature for baking. Next time I will cook it at the high temperature the first hour and then reduce the heat to 325.

This is a special "family" gathering entree.  Namely because it is simple enough, yet fancy or elegant enough to make your family and friends feel as if you "really" care and out did yourself!  I opted not to include the apple juice, too much moisture can be just as bad as too little. I also sauteed the onions and celery in the butter and used Ocean Spray Jelled Cranberry sauce.  I whipped the sauce and then added it into the onion/celery sautee allowing it to melt/meld. I added three cloves of minced garlic to this mix at the end of the cooking time, (right about 10 minutes before the end of cooking)and added everything to a large bowl mixing with a wooden spoon.  I also deleted the egg, there is no need for this binder if you do not use the apple juice.  If you find your stuffing to dry for your liking add a little apple juice, a little at a time until you achieve the desired level of moistness.

Nontheless, your family and friends will feel warm and fuzzy and you will feel pretty darn good yourself when you serve this roast!

I skipped the crown roast because of cost and used a boneless pork loin roast. The review here is for the fabulous stuffing. It's too bad it's not in a cagagory by it's self because people may not find it. So if your looking for a roast I suggest you do a loin roast and follow the recipe I found  on this site with 1/2 cup vinegar plus 1 tsp thyme and go directly to the stuffing. I followed the recipe as directed and it got rave reviews from everyone. I never thought anything could replace my mother's stuffing but this will come close, at least some of the time. This is great! A+++++

FANTASTIC. Made for mother in laws birthday and it turned out beautifully. Being a self-taught cook I wasn't aware that with crown pork roast it's sometimes better to tell how much you're getting with number of ribs not weight. I got a 12 rib roast to feed my crowd and it worked out very well. I rubbed it before putting it in the oven with a rosemary, garlic, pepper and little but of thyme mixed with olive oil to make a paste. It smelled so good while cooking and the dressing was beautiful and tasted great. It is so easy to prepare and looks so elegant that you can't go wrong!! Keep in mind however that it is NOT an inexpensive dish..definitely for special occasions only.

I did not make the stuffing for this roast, however I followed the cooking method (rib ends down to start with.....I was VERY skeptically) when I cooked my first crown roast.  It was BEYOND amazing.  I cannot believe I was too intimidated to try one of these for so long....and yes, it can be pricey for a single piece of meat, but per person, it is quite reasonable.  I followed other reviewers who said I should only allow the internal temp to reach 155-160 before removing, and it was perfectly cooked.  I also made a light sauce to go with.  I sauted shitaki mushrooms, then used the liquid that cooked out of the mushrooms to add to a tbsp of butter & flour to make a light roux.  After a could minutes, I added a cup of chicken stock, 2 tbsp balsalmic vinegar & about 1/4 cup of drippings from the roast & salt/pepper to taste.  It was wonderful!!!  It was one of the best pieces of meat I ever tasted.....and I MADE IT!  Thank you so much for teaching me how to do it!!

I don't cook much and this was so easy. We made this for Christmas Day and it was a huge hit.  It looked impressive and it tasted fantastic.  I did omit the sugar and used canned whole cranberry sauce instead (as suggested by another reviewer).  It was fantastic.

Great Recipe.  Stuff was just a tad too sweet, would eliminate some sugar next time.  With fresh bread, egg isn't needed.  Family loved it.

Great recipe.  If you want to keep the crown form before adding the stuffing, you can insert a large apple in the middle.  The apple will help keep the form and add delicious flavor.

I'm rating this mostly for the stuffing.  It was beautiful and tasted wonderful.  I used about 3 cups of whole fresh cranberries. My 9.5 lb. crown's center was not open enough to stuff so I made it as a dressing.  This was my first crown pork.  I decided to roast it under a foil tent, crown down at 325.  After 3 hours, I turned it crown side up and covered the bone ends with foil.  I had to kick the heat up to 350 and it had to continue cooking for two more hours to reach 160 (before resting).  The next time, I will begin it at 350, then down to 325.  This is not your ordinary pork chop dinner.  The meat was succulent and the stuffing festive and delicious.  Thanks for all the raves this fabulous meal got for me.  As for cooking temps, I always have success with a slower roast.

A  tip when roasting this Crown pork roast try putting an empty  coffee can in the middle hole. for the entire cooking time.  This will hold the meat's shape and allow a balanced cooking temperature transfer. then add your stuffing or mashed potatoes when serving.

Pork can sometimes be too dry, but not with this recipe!  Looks gorgeous as a centrpiece for a dinner party. Really had to keep an eye on it while cooking so it didn't brown too quickly.

I, too, am rating this for the stuffing which was TOTALLY awesome and made my whole Christmas dinner Very Special.  I love it.  I made a yield for 4 and stuffed a roaster chicken (3 lbs) and also put some in a loaf pan because there was so much.  I am so glad I did because the smells and tastes were out-of-this-world!  I didn't use any egg and substituted a simplified type of wassail (read - I didn't have all the spices!! 8-) for the juice.  After a while I had to re-moisten the stuffing, so I used chicken broth.  The apple chunks were super with the peel on.  It was even better (if that's possible) the next day.  THX!!!

I made this for two different holiday parties, complete with white paper "booties", and it was a hit both times!  I used a bag of stuffing to save time and needed to add more apple juice to make it moist enough. I used the fresh chopped cranberries, but saved about 1/3 of the bag and cooked them down with sugar to make a small dish of relish to accompany the meat.  I cooked the roast at 325 and it turned out very moist.

I had great success with this recipe I used 2.5 cups of ocean spray cranberry sauce instead of the sugar, whole cranberrys and egg as suggested by other reviewers.  The stuffing came out marvelous a real complement to the pork.  The roast was moist and delicious I rubbed garlic, rosemary, thyme, and sage on it during the cooking it smelled wonderful. Thanks for the recipe I will use it again

thank you!  this came out great for my dinner party. For me, the crown cooked much faster (had 8 meaty ribs) so I would recommend keeping an eye on the internal temp of the meat as well as an eye on the clock.

I made this last night for a new year's dinner for family - 10 people.  My roast was 8.75 pounds.  Although a frequent entertainer/cook, I have never made crown roast or any other type of pork - just hadn't but now wanted to try something new.   I didn't like the stuffing; followed the recipe to the letter but I did not like the sweet flavor.  Husband hated it - very opinionated though.  No one else said much.   On the roast itself, I didn't trust my meat thermometer.  My oven is electric and runs hot, but, within 15 mintes of returning the roast to the oven, the therm said 160.  I placed it in different locations, and it quickly reached 160 but didn't go above.   I kept it in for about another 45-60 minutes total as I was concerned that the recipe for a smaller roast (7 lbs) said about another 1.5 hour was required.  In any case, long story not so short, I found it dry and didn't finish it - no one really did.  My teenage nephews will eat car parts but they weren't to into it.  Luckily I smothered everyone with appetizers galore so at least no one went hungry.    So that is my story - take from it what you will.

WOW!  This crown roast was delish!  It was not an easy recipe but well worth the effort. Only minor tweaks.....we used fresh apple cider (AND 2 times the amount called for.....stuffing because we used dried bread crumbs instead of fresh) and added 1/2 cup of finely chopped pecans. We followed the rest of the recipes and loved this roast.  The only thing we will do is take the roast out a bit earlier....it was almost too dry.  And the roast was amazing the next day too!  We have a new Christmas dinner tradition.

I took the advice of Janice and substituted 2 1/2 cups of whole cranberry sauce for the cranberries, apple juice and sugar.  I also toasted the bread before cubing.  The dressing was the absolute best.  It has the traditional taste with a twist.  The whole cranberries gave a very festive look to it.  The meat was flavorful but a little dry.  Still good.  Rating the dressing alone would have been 5 stars.

We had this for Christmas dinner.  It turned out ok!  None of us had ever had crown roast before, so didn't know quite what to expect.  We did cover it while cooking (my mom refuses not to).  The stuffing was different, but in a good way!  I'd never had a sweeter stuffing before, and it was a nice change.  Thanks for the recipe!

I did this as a treat for our Christmas dinner and everyone loved it. The apple stuffing went perfectly with the pork and I used the leftover meat to make bar-b-q. I know our family will be expecting this again this year!

What an amazingly simple dish!  The pork was fantastic, and the stuffing was a hit at my Christmas Eve dinner.  My 12 rib, 7 lb roast took approx 2.5 hours to cook at 350, so it was done earlier than I expected.  I wrapped it in foil and kept it in the warming drawer, but unfortunately, it got a little drier than I would have liked. It was still great though. Since this was my first time making a crown roast, I wasn't sure on the cooking time - now I know for next time.  I couldn't fit very much stuffing inside my crown roast, so I cooked it in dish and it was fantastic - everyone loved it.  I made a separate portion of stuffing for myself that was dairy and soy free, so instead of butter, I sauteed the onion and celery in a little olive oil.  Then I added extra apple juice to make up for the missing liquid.  It turned out great.

As suggested by others, I used 2 cups of whole canned cranberries, no sugar and no egg.  However I did add the apple juice and found the stuffing too wet, but still tasted amazing.  My family all loved it and wanted to take the leftovers home.  Next time I won't add any apple juice.  I also cooked this recipe in a dish and not in the middle of my pork roast and it still tasted great.

this roast is way over cooked. The roast should be taken out at 145F, tented and let rest for at least 20 min. To take it out at 175F would be a shame.

This was a absolutely fabulous recipe.  I made it for christmas dinner last year.  The only problem I had was finding a crown pork roast that was that size.  I would recommend this recipe expecially for its originality and wonderful presentation as well as taste.

I made it tonight for my husband's birthday.  I replaced the sugar with cranberry sauce as suggested by others.  It was an amazing dish.  The meat was moist and the stuffing was out of this world.  I took it out of the oven when the meat reached 170 degrees - I was worried about drying it out but it was perfect.  It is a definite keeper

made this for Christmas. Everyone loved it.  I had it im for about 3 hrs.  The stuffing tasted great, but went down to mush, but my husband said that was great, I didn't thank so, but tasted good.  I didn't have the poultry seasoning, so put in some nutmag, thyme and sage.  Maybe next time I won't put it into the opening in the crown.  I really thank it is the best way to turn it bottom sid up for the first 2 hrs. them turn it over, it got nice and brown.I did use 2 1\2 cup of cranberry sauce, instead of the cranberry sugar and apple juice  worked out great

I made this for our annual holiday meal with friends.  It was a huge hit - the stuffing was great! The pork took a little longer than stated, but it was also slightly over 7 lbs. so that only makes sense.  This made not only a delicious meal but a beautiful presentation.

I made this exactly as the recipe said but for 5 people so had a seven rib roast and couldn't get it into a perfect circle like the photo showed.  So I used some aluminum foil to form the rest of the circle so the stuffing would stay in place and it worked beautifully.  It was my first time ever making a crown roast. Everyone raved about it and I will surely make it again.  The left overs were awesome the next day and I even had enough pork for a lovely sandwich for another day.  It's a keeper for sure and very impressive when you serve it.

This is a good recipe. The stuffing is great. The roast I guess depends on your butcher. My butcher did not do a good job at all. No room to stuff it and meat was tough. I cooked it just as directed. I think it was the roast it's self that caused it.

My first time making this type of roast.  WONDERFUL!  I used dried crandberries in dressing and it was wonderful.  The middle of the roast wasn't large enough to hold much stuffing, so I added more apple juice and baked it for about 20 minutes by itself.  Yummy!

Great Stuffing! This would be really good with a Thanksgiving turkey as well. Very moist and full of flavor. I made the crown roast and stuffing for Christmas dinner and it was a big hit. There is not a lot of room in the center of the roast for stuffing, so you will need to use a casserole dish. Cover with foil and bake it for about 45 minutes at 350 degrees. I will certainly try this again. The only thing I might try different the next time is inject the roast with apple juice for added moisture.

I chose this recipe because it fit my 7 lb crown roast perfectly. Stuffing was good, meat was tasty but dry. 375 seemed high to me, but I followed the recipe. The roast was well done after the first two hours, internal temperature 190. The meat had expanded and filled the cavity so the stuffing was packed between the chopps. Presentation was a complete flop.

I used a 12 chop crown.  Cooking time, I found, is much too long.  And since the butcher placed the "panties" on the rib ends, the instructions didn't make a lot of sense.  But it's a fairly inexpensive and impressive presentation and the stuffing is really good.

People, do not ever cook a pork loin roast (which is what this is) to 175 degrees. This is way too long.  Modern pork will be too dry. 150-160 should work for most folks. Also, trust your thermometer not your clock, in other words go by temp not by time.

I have never prepared crown pork before, it was well received at Christmas dinner.  Very nice presentation.  being inexperienced making stuffing, I used regular white bread and was too, too moist, however judging by taste and not texture it was very good.  I will make again.

I really wanted to like this recipe. I did have some issues though.
1. Like mb any others,  I  found the recommendation for roasting temp and the duration to be excessive. I had a 16 rib, 12.5# roast. I cut back from 375F to 325F after 1 hour, then finished with another 2 and a 1/2 hours as recommended. The roast was very, very dry.  Next time I will start at 350F and cut total roasting time to 1.5- 2 hours checking with my instant read  thermometer along the way.  I did not stuff the roast  (see below) and that may have affected my cooking time.
2.   The stuffing was very good but more than twice as much as I could fit inside my roast,  So I had to do that in a separate casserole dish. I will cut that recipe exactly in half next time.

The stuffing was good however I didn't cook the pork roast this way as cooking until it reaches 175 would be way to cook.  Take your pork roast out when it reaches 145 and it will be done perfectly.

This was good but not great. Was looking for more flavor, maybe needs more onion?

I Made this in 2011 for the first time.  It was a big hit with the family so I am cooking one again this year.  The roast was moist and the stuffing fabulous.

It was a little dry. We baked it at 375 for 1 hour and then lowered the temp. to 325. Also the stuffing was to moist. Maybe if we didn't use fresh bread cubes or left out the apple juice it would have been better.
