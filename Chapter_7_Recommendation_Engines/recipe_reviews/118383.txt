This was excellent. I did however use dill relish instead of sweet, as I always do it is a personal preference. I will be making this again. Thanks for something different for a change.

Yum! Yet another excellent TOH recipe (this is also printed in one of my annual TOH / Light & Tasty cookbooks)!!! It literally took me FIVE minutes to prep this! And, despite other's suggestions to reduce (or omit altogether) the sugar, I found this to be perfect as is. This was a tad runny, but nothing a couple hours in the fridge "setting up" wouldn't fix. NOTE: Be sure to chop your onion fine and use FRESH lemon juice. both make a noticeable difference! Thanks SO much for sharing a great recipe with the AR community, Kristen! :-)

I skipped the chopped onion and sugar and it was still great!

Awesome! This is a slightly sweet, old fashioned type of tartar sauce. I can't wait to try it on battered haddock. Had it today with Baked Salmon Fillets Dijon. It isn't as thick as the stock picture makes it look, but who cares about that? It's creamy and delicious. Don't pass it by! I would much rather have this than the bottled sauce. Thanks!

I'm sorry to be the one person that didn't care for this recipe, but the flavors just didn't work for us. The dijon really overpowered the sauce.

I took the advice and didn't add the extra sugar. GREAT taste. What a wonderful alternative to traditional tartar sauces. The kids loved it.

We really like this sauce!  Rather than fat-free mayo I used Hellman's/Best Foods Canola Mayo because that's what I have on hand.  Since I didn't have a lemon I used an 1/8 tsp. of lemon pepper.  Mine didn't come out runny as some other reviewers mentioned and I'm guessing it's because I didn't use lemon juice.

A little too sweet with the sweet relish AND the sugar.  I'd either use dill relish or cut the sugar next time.  It was still pretty good though...nice change to the normal tartar.

This was delicious! I left out the sugar, used 1/4 teaspoon onion powder instead of chopped onion, added 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder, and served it with fish and chips, thanks for the recipe!

Not bad!  I used dill pickle spears instead of the sweet pickle relish in this, and it worked well enough--I processed some and chopped some so I'd have pickle chunks.  Bf didn't even notice the mustard in this but kept gobbling it up.  It's a good thing we liked it since we have some leftover . . .we have plenty of fish to use it on!  Thanks for the recipe.

This was quite good.  Tastes like good old fashioned tarter sauce, only better, with a kick.
