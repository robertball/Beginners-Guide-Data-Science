Perfect! A hit with the Byrdboys. I increased the corn in this, using 2 cans sweet corn and 1 can shoepeg. There was plenty of butter/curry to stretch. Sprinkled a little cayenne on top for color and heat. Thanks for the recipe!

Absolutely delicious!  Started cooking and realized I didn't have curry...it was still fabulous...such a nice change of pace.  Look forward to making it with curry next time.

Amazingly quick and delicious!!!  I used a lot less butter (about 1/2) and more granulated garlic instead of the powder.  Topped it off with a little cayenne pepper and everyone loved it!

This was a recipe that no one in my house really cared for. We love curry, but the texture of the corn didn't mix well with the flavor of the curry. I ended up mixing the leftovers into some soup the next day. Won't be having this again.

I'm thoroughly sick of regular corn because it's my husband's favorite vegetable, so I thought I'd try this since I love curry.  One thing I did do differently was use the kernels I cut from an ear of fresh corn.  I'm not sure I got the proportions of the other ingredients exactly right, but I did like the finished product and would make it again.

Oh my gosh, this is so good.  We served this last year (2009) for Thanksgiving and so many folks asked for the recipe.  Will serve again for my crowd joining us for Christmas dinner.  A hit!

I really liked this. I did use less butter (a little less than a quarter cup), frozen corn (not a fan of canned), and some seasoned salt. This was a great side to tacos/burritos!

This was very delicious,easy and quick.  If you are a fan of curry you are bound to love it.  I hesitated and used just 1 tbs. curry powder but did not change anything else. It was excellent.

This turned out great. I cut everything in half and went easy on the seasonings since I wasn't sure that my spouse would even eat it. I used red curry powder. We ended up liking this dish very much and I will definitely fix this again.

Delicious!
I used 5 Tb. butter, 1 can of corn, and equal amount of frozen PEAS, 1 can of KIDNEY BEANS, 1/2 c. green onions, 2 Tbl. curry powder, 2 tsp. garlic powder, fresh ground pepper.
I cooked the frozen peas in the microwave 2 minutes.Then I followed the recipe, melting butter and cooking everything except the spices for 7 minutes, stirring, and then adding the spices. 
Served with a pasta dish.
Spectacular!

This recipe was ok.  I used less butter than the recipe called for.  Probably won't make again, but thought I would try it.

Really good. I love curry and I love garlic. I added a little finely chopped green pepper mostly for the color but they compliment the corn as well.

Interesting flavors...not too bad.  I didn't have onion so I used minced real fresh garlic and threw some chopped tomatoes in too.  I will definitely finish the dish, but I'm not sure if I'll remember to make it again.  Might taste okay with cumin instead???

Not that great. I did it exactly as stated. I love Curry flavor, but after trying this, I even mentioned it to a co-worker (Jamaican) and we both agree: curry and corn just don't mix. Thanks anyway. But I don't think I'll be doing this one again.

This is so quick and easy to make. It's pretty tasty, too. Being a college student, this is a great quick fix to make in as large or small a portion as you'd like.

I made this to use up a can of corn, which I hate except in cob form, that I had in my cupboard.  I love curry, so I was excited.  A bit of a disappointment - it didn't mask the canned corn flavour enough.  My husband loved it, though... only make this if you already like canned corn!

Really good! I used one fresh steamed corn, and I followed some of reviewer luv2cuk's suggestions. I sauteed the onion for a few min, then added the garlic and curry powder and a pinch of cayenne to get the flavor going. I then deglazed the pan with a little white wine and added the corn. This would go great with Indian or Mexican food or as a side, as I had it with meatloaf. Thanks James, great recipe!

Delicious!  I cook this all the time.  It's a huge hit.  The corn tastes great with the curry spice, and still shines through.  I have made it with canned corn and frozen corn.  Both are just as delicious.

I used fresh corn, cutting the kernels off 4 ears.  This gave me a rough equivalent to two cans.  I had about a cup of leftover curried chicken breast strips which I cubed and added as well.  I used the other measurements as listed and it is great!  I served it as a main course and it makes really good leftovers as well.

Good recipe  As with another reviewer, I used less butter and found it was much better with frozen or fresh corn.

LOVED IT! Yum! Yum! Yum! I enjoyed the curry taste with the sweetness of the corn...looking forward to trying this with Olathe sweet sweet corn and increasing the heat with more spices! Only because I love to experiment not because the recipe is unsatisfying.

the side dish is very good. for a quick main course i added green peppers carrots and shrimp. i added just enough organic chicken stock to make enough gravy to serve over noodles. everyone loved it! thank you
