This is a fun recipe for Valentine's Day. I cut back the imperial hearts to 3/4 cup and the cinnamon chips to 1 cup. The dough just can't hold any more. Also let cool on the pan for 3 minutes otherwise candies are very gooey and make it hard to de-cookie the sheet.

Tasty and easy to put together. I had to go to the local cake decorating shop to get the cinnamon chips as the grocery stores nearby didn't carry them. I accidentally baked them at 350 and at that temperature they went 10 minutes in the oven. These will be a great addition to our Christmas cookie plates!
