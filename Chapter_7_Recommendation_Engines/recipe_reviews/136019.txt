This was AMAZING!!!  The only thing I would change is getting the bigger tub of Cool Whip (I seem to run out before I got to the top) and to use fresh raspberries on the top.  The frozen ones were all mashed and you couldn't tell that they were actually raspberries. Also, I didn't buy the frozen raspberries in syrup, but I had raspberry syrup that my husband and I use for our coffee, so I brushed that over the brownies and it was really good.  I will make this over and over.

I have been making this for years, it is easy, and everyone's favorite!! Also good with a fresh banana on the side.  Just don't mix it in, of course, because they turn brown.
