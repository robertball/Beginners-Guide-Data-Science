I used diet 7-UP and Smirnoff Whipped Vodka. This is potent, that's for sure but my husband and I thought this was quite good--but sweet. For me, I didn't care much for the 7-UP in this particular drink. I'd make this again but I think I'd use soda water in place of the 7-UP to cut the sweetness......if only a little. Good dessert drink.

This is excellent! I used to tend bar and this was the recipe I used. I liked club soda instead of lemon-lime soda as it isn't as sweet but this way is quite good and it packs a punch!!

I'm not much of a drinker, but tonight I am with this....woooo (I'm a woo girl). LOL very good drink though I needed to double the soda since I like the sweeter side of things.

I use club soda in place of the lemon-lime soda. I also use only 1 oz each of the vodka and Kahlua, and about 1.5 oz of club soda. Layer vodka, then Kahlua, then club soda for each shot. That way, by the end, your palate is clear. :) Yum!

I'm really not sure where the idea to use lemon lime soda came from. The traditional, and even contemporary, recipes call for plain club soda. Lemon lime soda is too sweet and this is not a sweet drink. I'm usually not passionate about reviews, but please please please don't use lemon lime soda. In fact, somebody on this website needs to change that ingredient.

I'm a sissy when it comes to chugging/shooting shots (and I hate all things coffee flavored), so I was not sure about this one.  My BIL and I decided to give these a try and I was pleasantly surprised.  This went down super smoothly, with no issue.  I can see myself making these again. CHEERS, Emily!
