This is the best, most delicious and cost effective granola bar I 've made. We eat a lot of Kashi bars and they can get really expensive. This recipe makes A LOT and they freeze well, too! I love the recipe as is, but sometimes I kick it up a notch by adding flax seeds, raw pumpkin seeds, unsweetened coconut flakes and carob chips. Delish! I also use brown sugar instead of white and when I add all the extras it  gets a little dry so I add more honey and peanut butter. This is a five star recipe either way! Thanks for submitting it. I'll never buy commercial bars again!!

I love this recipe! I used pancake syrup instead of maple, skim milk instead of the evaporated and semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of the white and they came out wonderful. I took the advice of another reader and took the bars out of the oven after 10 minutes to press them down and I think that really helped them stay together.  I will be making these again. Next time I might try adding pumpkin.

Granola bars are a regular meal replacement in my house of  boys. We regularly make the Chewy Granola bar recipe. I was pleasantly surprised when I made this recipe - it was just the alternative I was looking for in filling out our granola bar selection in the freezer. Not only did the kids like it but so did all the moms I served them too.

I liked these.  I needed a granola bar recipe to have with fruit for a quick meal and these are WAY better than store-bought.  I had to use pancake syrup because I didn't have maple, raisins instead of cranberries, dry roasted peanuts instead of walnuts and sprinkled mini chocolate chips on top.  They were really delicious.  The only thing I would change would be the serving size because I like granola bars to be the size of store bought- longish; these were kind of small. I loved 'em though. :)

This was my first time to make granola bars, and I am more than pleased with the outcome of this recipe! In the middle of mixing up everything, I realized I only had instant oats instead of old fashioned, and used them anyway. It didn't seem to hurt the recipe at all. I lined my pan with nonstick foil and created handles on each end. When they were done, I was able to lift them out of the pan easily, and then let them cool on a wire rack. They were easy to cut, and are super delicious.. I can't stay out of them! I'll absolutely make this recipe again :)

I really like how many things one can do with this simple recipie. My BF and I really enjoyed them i have a sweet tooth and he doesn't so i just cut bigger bars for myself :). They stay fresh for a long time in the fridge [a few months]. I prefer the taste right out of the fridge anyway. overall just a stellar recipie. for storage i put them all in a big ziploc baggie last time, this time when i make them i will put them in a fold over baggie for me to take with me on the go.

They are pretty tasty, and really easy to make. I took them out of the oven halfway through and re-pressed them into the pan so they'd stay together better.   They are a little TOO chewy though. I've already made them twice, and I love the taste, but next time I am going to scale back on the oats and add more rice crispie cereal. Hoping that will do the trick!

These were so good! I made the recipe pretty much as is except omitted the nuts and added a bit more rice cereal to make up for it. I also used pancake syrup as I donâ€™t really like the taste of pure maple syrup and that worked just fine. I pressed the bars down halfway through cooking and baked them until the edges of the pan started to brown up a little (about 20 mins). Everybody loves these and I will definitely be making them again!

These were ok. My husband and I liked them, the kids however couldn't be swayed. I don't think I'll make them again, as I had hoped to not have to eat the whole pan myself, even if they are healthier sweets.

my kids liked these, but prefer the brown chocolate. My nephew loved these and asked for the recipe- he's 17 and eats them on the way out the door to school.

Great basic recipe. I used all oats instead of the rice cereal. I also used semi-sweet chips & pecans. I was out of honey & used equal parts brown sugar & pure maple syrup. Also added 2 T flax seed. They turned out perfectly.

Wonderful flavor and so easy to customize based on what type of granola bar you like! Only had pancake syrup on hand and I didn't want to waste a whole can of evaporated milk, so I just used half & half and it turned out great. I also omitted the walnuts since I'm not a fan, but next I plan to try milk chocolate chips, cranberries, and almonds.

We thought these were ok, not great.  The bars seem quite dry.  I prefer the Playgroup Granola Bars.

I was so looking forward to these.  I have made many batches of different granola bars looking for a variety that I can choose from that I like.  One condition, they stay together!  Mine completely fell apart.  These wee not chewy, half of everything fell back into the pan.  I followed the directions pushed them into the pan well and pulled them out right at 18 minutes to make sure that they would not overcook.  The little bit that actually did hold together was okay, but not worth the hassle, time or money of trying to make these again.  Luckily, I will take the ingredients that fell apart... pretty much all of it) and use them in another recipe I have that sticks well together.  I really wish this would have held together, the spices seemed good, but would have probably put more in them.

Never made granola bars before,really liked these, though I did sub chocolate mini morsels for vanilla chips and sugar free orange marmalade for honey. Also used brown sugar instead of white. I don't think I'll be trying another recipe for granola bars, just change this one up as desired.

Thank you for sharing this recipe, I pretty well have kept some made since finding this recipe a few months ago. The only change I made was to use self rising flour as Hubby likes a softer granola.
