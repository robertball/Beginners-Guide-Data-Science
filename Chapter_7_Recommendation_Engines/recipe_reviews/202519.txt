W-a-y too much butter and oil mixture - I just used a scant 1/4 c. olive oil with a dollop of butter.  I also substituted fresh sauteed mushrooms for the canned.  This recipe can have its heat increased by the addition of a good cajun seasoning.  Good recipe to play with.

OH WOW!!!!  I never make a recipe without tweaking and the only change I made was to substitute angel hair pasta 'cause hubby's stroke makes linguini and spaghetti harder to wind on the fork.  This is absolutely fabulous just as is.  Very quick, easy, and affordable.  I may cut back on the butter and olive oil as suggested by the first reviewer but if cholesterol is not a problem...make it just as is for one of the best dishes ever!

Great recipe!  Added a little white wine, but besides that, followed it exactly.  Thanks!

This is a delicious recipe.  I tried it just as written one time, and then the next time, I added 1/4 cup of white wine instead of the clam juice.  It was even better.  Thank you for sharing.

Your photo shows penne or rigatoni. I had no zucchini so used baby spinach.  Added some chive and herb cream cheese as well and less oil.  was tasty with small tweaks. Edit..used fresh mushrooms. IMO canned are awful. Used less butter too.

I left out the zucchini but added sun-dried tomatoes and a splash of lemon juice. The recipe made quite a lot of liquid - I don't think a whole bottle of calm juice was necessary.

I did not care for this recipe. It was so hot I couldn't swallow it!  It would be great without the pepper, or 1/2 the amount possibly.  We might make it again, but NOT with the pepper!

I have never made this before and was a little nervous at first...was skeptical with adding the zucchini and cayenne pepper...however it was FANTASTIC! Best linguini and clam sauce I have ever had...this will be my forever recipe for this dish! Thank you!

This is the fist time I have written a review and that's because this is undoubtably the best recipe ever!  I followed it to the letter except for reducing the butter and olive oil as suggested.  I also had to use "Knorr Clam Base" as I did not have the bottled version.  Wen I got to the end, though it was delicious already, it was a bit soupy.  By adding a trick from my Sicilian mother, two dollops of cream cheese (1/4 of the 8 oz pkg),  it turned to pure silk.  OMG - This deserves more than 5 stars!
