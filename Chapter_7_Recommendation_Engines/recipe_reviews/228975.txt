I had cling peaches from my tree so I used 4 lbs. I chopped the tomatoes onion and bells into quarters. I couldn't find cherry peppers so I subbed with 5 sweet mini peppers as they are about twice the size of cherry peppers. I am not a big sugar user so I halved the sugar. I omitted Braggs as it was optional and I was out. After I strained the BBQ sauce I felt that I wanted it thicker so I added another can of tomato paste. It made it thicker but still not a 'clinger' type of BBQ sauce. More like a super thick glaze. Flavor was great. Sweet up front and spicy at the end. My recipe only made 5 - pint jars. Very time consuming but the flavor was worth 5 stars!

I've made a few variations of this bbq since I first found the recipe. I love that it's mostly pureed veggies with just a bit of sugar and vinegar. The first time I followed the recipe almost exactly subbing a brown sugar burbon bbq rub for the Bragg and that was really good. By the end of the season I had so many yellow peach tomatoes that I decided to make a yellow version with yellow bell peppers and a spicy little yellow Peruvian chili I found at our local farmer's market. This version was a winner as well.
