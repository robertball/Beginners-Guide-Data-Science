This is almost exactly my grandmother's recipe but I put it into one pie plate rather than 2 and use an additional tablespoon of shortening.  I make it the way I remember my grandmother doing it and that is to put a handful of crumbs on the bottom of the pie dough already in the pie plate and then add a little of the molasses mixture and mix it up with your finger to make a "wet bottom".  Then keep alternating crumbs and liquid saving a handful of crumbs for the top.  Bake at 350 degrees for about an hour.

in the past i've enjoyed eating shoofly pies which were made by the amish & pennsylvania dutch. a simple, no frills pie, this recipe comes pretty close to how i remember them tasting. note: we prefer our shoofly pie served warm. it is also good with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top (optional). thanks for the yummy recipe & the history lesson robert!

I made these pies exactly by the recipe and they didn't turn out right.  The molasses filling was fine but the topping was dry and dusty and didn't brown well.  I will try again but either use less flour or more butter.
