This is a tasty little side dish. I topped it with smoked paprika.. mmm good. The only thing I found this needed was some olive oil on the bread. I tried it without oil and it was dry.. a little olive oil was perfect

In the end it was tasty - BUT the instructions in this recipe do not yield the results as described. 2 tsp of olive oil in a nonstick pan did not make for tender broccoli after 4 minutes unless the broccoli which I cut into small pieces needed to be 'finely chopped'?(so I gave it some more time - standing over the hot pan and stirring) The potatoes where very soft after the instructed 12-15 minutes -  - It was the broccoli which needed softening . I cooked and mashed and it took a lot of effort and strength to try to 'mash' the broccoli - and all the mashing was just starching out the potatoes. In the end I shut the gas and put the mixture into a glass Corningware baking dish and tightly covered it. And waited the 10 -15 minutes for the broccoli to truly finish softening. When I chose this recipe, I did not expect needing to stand over a hot frying pan, stirring for close to 15 minutes and then finding that,  the mashing needed some serious muscle

Pleasantly surprised with how well the cumin worked in this dish. Easy and fast, would certainly make again as a side dish or pair it with a salad for lunch. Thanks for sharing!

Yum! The cumin really works with these two ingredients! I added some olive oil to the french bread, and that really made a difference! But it was an easy and simple recipe, and delicious!
