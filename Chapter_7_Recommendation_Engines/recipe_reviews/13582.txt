This recipe is the best all round cake for every diet format, ease and speed of prepraration and it really tastes terrific! I substituted 1 cup of applesauce for one cup of the oil. It was an outstanding low fat cake this way.

I was really disappointed with this cake. The ingredient list sounded so yummy, but it overflowed out of the cake tin & it tasted WAY too oily.
I think I'll stick to my old banana cake recipe & just add pineapple.
Looks like the other readers have changed the recipe & then given it 5 stars which isn't very helpful for people like me who just make the recipe as it appears.

My husband loved this cake.  I reduced the sugar to 2 cps. and cut the oil down to 3/4 cp., and the recipe turned out fine.  I only had to bake it 70 min.

Very good even making it a little healthier!  I used 1 cup of applesauce and 1/3 cup of oil.  I used 2 cups Splenda and 1 cup sugar.  I used about 1/2 cup pecans and 1/2 cup slivered almonds (what I had on hand).  I did add a jar of drained maraschino cherries.  My bananas were very ripe ones that I had frozen so it made for a very, very moist cake.  Pleasantly surprised by this great homemade cake!

The whole family loves this recipe.  I do cut back on the oil to 2/3 c. and on the sugar to 1 3/4 c. I use a 10 inch bundt pan with no overflow problems. I also bake it for 70 minutes (with about 60 minutes of that on the Convection Bake setting).  I've made it with and without the optional cherries, but prefer the flavor without the cherries. It's easy, looks great, and tastes delicious!

Deeeeelicious!  My husband says it's the best cake he's ever had!  Easy to make.  I found the cooking time to be about 1 hr. for my oven, so check it often so you don't overcook it.  I will definitely be serving this one for Thanksgiving this year!

This cake was yummy.  I made a few variations: I reduced the oil to 2/3 cup and added an additional 2/3 cup of mashed bananas.  I reduced the sugar to 2 cups, substituted 1 cup of chocolate chips for the pecans, added 1 Tblsp. of cocoa and ommitted the cherries.  It turned out great.  Also, I made a small loaf pan and advise people to pull it out sooner or it will burn on the bottom.  Will definitely make again and will try with cherries next time.

The first time I made this cake it turned out perfect. I took it to church for Birthday Celebration and it was a hit with everyine. I followed the recipe, didn't change a thing. No over flowing as some have said. I did think it was a little on the sweet side but not too bad, may reduce the sugar in future. The second time I made it something went a little wrong. It started to darken soon after it went in the oven and I had to take it out before the recommended time. About 1 hour is all that is needed. I will probably reduce the temperature next time also, 325 might be better than 350. Maybe it was just my oven. I will surely make this again! It is a wonderful stand alone cake, no frosting needed. I did not add the cherries and I think I might add a little extra pineapple next time. Great moist cake with an addictive flavor.

This is getting 2 stars because the part I was able to salvage tasted good. The amount of oil is definitely off. I cut it back to 1 cup and wondered if I was going to have a mess on my hands.  The answer to that was YES. It overflowed from the pans, never cooked in the middle and got crunchy on the top. (Although that crunchy part was pretty good.) If I had followed my instincts, I would have added more flour and a touch more baking soda OR used much less oil.  I can't believe that the submitter of this recipe is using it as written and not having the same trouble.

I made this cake for the first time this Thaksgiving.  Yes, it was a hit, but it was more like a bread than a cake.  I like it in the mornings w/ butter on it.  WOW!  Also, the recipe yeilded more batter than I felt safe using in my 10" bundt pan.  The first one I made overflowed everywhere and then fell in.  NIGHTMARE!  For the second try I used less batter and it came out nicely.

Excellent everytime!  I use 1 cup unsweetened applesauce and only 1/3 cup oil, and I substitute sweetened dried cranberries for the cherries.

This is THE cake of the year for me-I have made over 15 of these this year. Everyone loves it and I love baking it!! I baked these in loaf pans and gave them out door to door on Christmas eve-I am making my final one of the year tonight for our party. I havn't had one bit of trouble from this cake as other's have with overflowing, but I did read the reviews and maybe headed that problem off. I don't even have to use the recipe anymore, I just know it by heart now. I hope others will try this recipe again-I use 1 cup of oil and two cups of sugar and I haven't tried the raisans but I think I will do that next--ONE OTHER TIP-THIS IS JUST PERSONAL PREFERENCE-THE BEST WAY TO EAT THIS IS TO CUT A PEICE AND HEAT IT UP IN THE MICROWAVE! my kids also spread their pieces with softened cream cheese!

The very name of this cake convinced me to attempt to make it. I did -- and the entire family and now many of my friends love it!!! I made the cake in a bundt pan and it too came out dark, though I used bleached AP flour. I deviated from the recipe somewhat - adding a bit more banana, cherries and pecans. This cake is now one of those cakes that everyone is asking for at my home. Thanks for the recipe.

I followed the recipe as directed, except that I substituted 1 cup of applesauce for 1 cup of oil (we are on a diet;) ) and only added 2 1/2cups of sugar, as the applesauce had some sugary flavor. I went on a culinary shopping spree this morning and I bought an "Angel Food Pan" - I didn't know better - but it turned out fine, no problems. I will upload my photo and I will update the rating, as directed by my family who still have to try it :) I loved it - but I like anything I make...so, we'll wait for them! UPDATE: 5 starts from my entire family!:) Thank you for sharing!

Good cake...I used applesauce for half the oil and only used 2 cups of splenda.  I didn't use the cherries and this cake was excellent with just a small dollop of whipped cream.  I love cakes that don't need frosting! Will make this again for sure.

This cake is soooo wonderful. I was expecting it to be "just ok" My non-cake loving husband liked it , too. I just used 1 cup of oil and 2 cups of sugar. I think next time I might add more pineapple...just for experimental purposes. I did not add nuts cauz I didn't have em. I also didn't add cherries. ha ha I guess I really changed it, but the base recipe is wonderful. Thank you so much.

Nearly as good as the Austrian Black Tea Cake on this site. I reduced the oil down to 1 cup, doubled the cinnamon and added some allspice. I didn't have any problems  with it overflowing. It also tastes fantastic with some cream cheese frosting

Made this today and everyone gave it thumbs up!  I used 1/2 c applesauce and 1/2 c of oil, also reduced sugar to two cups as others suggested.  Only used the juice from an 8 ounce can of pineapple as I did not want the pulp.  Added 1/2 cup each of chopped walnuts and chocolate chips.  I always have bananas in the freezer and am always looking for ways to use them.  Baked for only 75 minutes.  Sifted confectioners over it just for looks.

This is very delicious. It will probably replace my standard banana bread recipe. It made a bundt pan and also a mini loaf pan.

Have no idea how this tastes, I've got to clean out the oven and shut off the smoke alarm first. I even used 6 cupcakes plus the 9" bundt & everything has overflowed.

I made this cake for the first time at Thanksgiving 3 years ago and have made it every year since.  It is one of the most delicious cakes I have ever tasted.  I ususally make it 3 days in advance, because it seems with this cake the longer it sits, the more flavorful it becomes.  I do not add the nuts or the cherries, though.  I have never had a problem with this cake bubbling over in the oven.  Every year my family requests that I make it again.  Thank you so much for this recipe, it has become a regular holiday treat in my house.

This cake was delicious with no changes to the recipe. Next time I think I will add some dates also, but just because we all love dates not because I think the recipe needs any changes. And I think I will use an angel food cake pan instead of a bundt pan as the cake almost over flowed my bundt pan, but I will definitely make it again.

The recipe just says take all the ingredients and mix together dry, wet, eggs,  oil - just throw it together. Of course I did not do that and followed a more traditional way of mixing the cake ingredients. 
Also used some of the suggestions to cut down on the ton of oil suggested. I used 1 cup applesauce and 1/3 c oil. I added 1 tsp baking powder. I used 1 1/2 c Splenda and 1 cup sugar. I only had enough banana to make 1 cup.  And I did not use the cherries - too many chemicals in maraschinos. 
Baked it in a bundt for an hour and it came out fine. Definitely not the best cake ever made, but dense, and good with coffee.

We really liked this.  I substituted 1 cup applesauce for the olive oil.  Next time, I will put in more cherries.  I will also line the bottom of the bundt pan with cherries so that the presentation will be nicer.

The cake is very flavorful and tasty.  I suggest you cut back on the oil by a third to a half of a cup.  The oil causes the texture and the appearance of being overly moist.  I omitted the nuts because of dentures.  It is very good.

This is SWEET but I liked it. Sort of like a cross between muffin and banana bread. I  did not have pineapple but I did have the cherries. Next time I might try less white sugar and substitute with something else (maybe some brown sugar)

I can't for the life of me see how anyone can give this cake a bad review. I followed the recipe EXACTLY except added more pecans for my husband. Amazing.  There was a lot of batter so I filled my bundt pan up to about an inch from the top.

I substituted 1 cup unsweetened apple sauce for 1 cup oil. Still used the remaining 1/3 cup oil Used 4 bananas which I think was about 2 1/2 c. No cherries this time. Not against them, just didn't have them. Used 1/2 c white sugar, 1/2 c Splenda, and 1 cup raw sugar. Added about a cup of chocolate chips and 1 cup of raisins. Baked for about 70 minute.

Excellent recipe. I made a couple changes but that’s the beauty of this recipe.  It’s customizable. I used a whole can of crushed pineapple and reduced the sugar to 2 cups.  I doubled the cinnamon. Personal choice. This recipe filled my bundt pan to about an inch from the top.  It was just the right amount.  If your pan is smaller I would reserve some batter and make a small cake too. I baked mine at 340 degrees and it took approximately 70-75 minutes. Next time I may add some coconut for a more tropical cake. Thanks for a great recipe.

Cake had a fantastic taste very moist Problem was it stuck to the bundt pan even after it was sprayed and floured. Had to be scooped out which was not an acceptable dessert to the party I was taking it to. lol

Followed recipe exactly.  I did cut the cherries in half instead of using them whole.  It was a big hit.  Very good.  Will absolutely make it again.  Very sweet, may cut sugar back to 2 cups next time.

Followed the recipe except used 1 cup of applesauce in place of 1/2 the oil and used walnuts in place of pecans. Was good but not great. Probably would not make again.

This will replace my old banana bread recipe.  Cut back on oil by mixing oil and melted butter to equal 3/4 Cup then used less sugar mixing white and brown with pumpkin pie spice.  Pineapple was a good add, didn't have cherries.   Too much batter, filled bundt pan 2/3 full and the rest went into a small round corningware dish. Set your time for much less time and then check every ten minutes. Mine was done in about 50 min. and small dish in 20.

Absolutely love (!) this cake.  It turned out perfect as written, although  I did add only 1 cup of vegetable oil and baked it at 350 for 1 hour, 20 min.  Everyone has raved over it. Thank  you for sharing!

I made this cake recently and I thought it was too sweet.  I like the ingredients, but I think the next time I’ll cut the sugar to two cups.  Like some others, I substituted apple sauce for one cup of the oil, and still came out moist.  The recipe does make a lot of batter, so, even though it didn’t spill over in the oven, it stuck to the top of the pan and was hard to get out.

Taste was good but the cake itself was to wet and oily.
I would explore reducing oil to 3/4 cup and sugar to 2 cups.
I would also pay close attention to the amount of time in the oven.  May be able to come out sooner.

Hope this helps.

It was delicious but I only had 1 1/2 c mashed bananas so I put 1/2 more crushed pineapple in to it since I was using fresh pineapple I had extra.

Splenda was a good substitute for the sugar in the recipe.  The cake was moist and delicious.  On a whim, I added a cup of halved Maraschino Cherries for an attractive and tasty fruit addition.

I used apple sauce in place of the oil, brown sugar in place of white sugar, pineapple tidbits instead of crushed and no cherries. Basically used what was in the pantry.

Also known as a Hummingbird cake. Tastes delicious. Definitely one to keep in your cake files for special occasions or just because I need something sweet.

What can I say?  My family absolutely loved this recipe.  We ate it warm with some vanilla bean ice cream.  Three-fourths of the cake was eaten that night.  Excellent recipe and please follow the directions from start to finish.  You cannot miss.

Delicious. I made two mini-bundt cakes from this recipe, used fresh cherries and reduced oil and sugar (my choice was Splenda baking sugar)  to one cup as others suggested.  The flavor is more like a banana bread snack cake with extra fruit than it is like a cake with fruit. Cool well or it may be tricky to remove from pan.

It did turn out very moist. I followed suggestions of other reviewers and reduced the oil; I used 3/4 cup. As some others experienced, it also took only 1 hour in my oven.

Like many others I cut the oil to 1/3 cup and used 1 cup applesauce.  I also cut sugar to 2 cups.  Still was probably sweeter than my own personal preference.  Next time, will start with 1 cup sugar and add additional to 'taste'.  1 cup pecans chopped equals about 4.4 oz, 1 cup crushed pineapple equals about 9 oz, 1 cup chopped m. cherries equals about 7 oz .  For those that find weighing ingredients helpful.  Great recipe, but benefits from altering fat and sugar content I feel.

EXCELLENT.  Bunt pan was too small and it bubbled over.  Had to switch ovens.  Next time I'll use the largest I can find, 12-15C.  Presentation less than stellar, BUT not a crumb left over.

If I rated this cake just on my opinion, I'd give it 3 stars. However, I took it to church and a party and got several compliments, so will give it 5 stars. To me it's just banana bread in a bundt pan.

I liked the cake.  I brought it to a party and it was a hit.  I subtracted 1/2 cup sugar, it seemed like it would be plenty sweet with the ripe bananas and crushed pineapple.  I agree with reviewers who said this was too much batter.  I didn't fill the bundt pan, and it rose correctly, didn't overflow.  I made about 14 muffins with the remaining batter.   I thought it was a little oily.  I will make it again and use applesauce for part of the oil.  I will either use a larger bundt pan, or use the decorative one again and use a square cake pan for the remaining batter.

I had sifted my dry ingredients together and when i went to mix my wet ingredients, I looked at the ratio of sugar to flour and had to look twice.  This seemed like too much sugar to flour.  I only added 2 cups.  I almost always replace applesauce for oil in banana bread/cake type recipes with great results so did that.  After stirring it up, I could see there was no way I would be able to safely put this in a bundt pan without the overflow problems that others encountered.  I baked in a 9x13 pan for 50 minutes and it was perfect.  I did add a bit more pineapple drained.  iced with cream cheese frosting and toasted coconut.  with those changes, it was good.  I think I see where the overflow issue may come:  the amt. of baking soda.  Looking through similar recipes, most add less oil, 2 cups sugar and only 1 tsp. soda.  The proportions of this are way off.  probably the reason for the consistent comments of overflow(due to the amt. of soda), crunchy(due to the amt. of sugar and oil).  I would search for similar recipe.

Was so looking forward to making this cake.  I am sorry to say it did not live up to my expectations.  Loved the idea of the other fruit added to the cake, but it was way to oily , which left an after taste.  What I thought would be light and fruity, turned out heavy with oil which over shadowed the fruit.

I made half of his recipe in my 6-cup bundt pan.  It took 46 minutes to bake.  It turned out well and Hubs took it to his fishing buddies.  I'm not sure it's a favorite, but the guys liked it.

I'm not crazy about banana nut bread and this cake tastes a lot like it although it is quite a bit more moist. It is too sweet -- will reduce the sugar in the future. Having said the above, my husband loved this cake. Will bake again in the future since he liked it so well.

I've made this cake many, many times and have never had a problem with it. I use a tube pan. Always tastes better on the second day. Try adding some golden raisins, a chopped apple - excellent! Perfect autumn dessert.

I reduced the oil to 3/4 cup and added 1/2 cup of applesauce. The cake turned out great. It was a moist and a very filling cake. It does however rise quickly in the oven, but thankfully it didnt overflow for me, as it did for other reviewers, maybe because I didnt add the full amount of oil.

Good cake overall. I used only 1/2 cup of oil and turned out perfect. Not the best cake i've had but still good esp. with the cherries. Also i dont get why eggs are listed as part of the ingredients but not used in the directions. ???? was a little confusing to me whether to use the eggs or not but i did and it turned out well.
