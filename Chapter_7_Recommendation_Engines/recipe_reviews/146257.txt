This is so good and so simple to make.  The  smell is amazing when cooking.  I made it as written and it was very good.  Second time I added a 2 tablespoon of tomato paste and used chicken stock instead of water and it was even better!

This stew is fabulous!  The flavors are complimentary, and not overpowering.  My local store did not have bulk chorizo, so I used a 1 lb. package of chorizo links, removed the casings, browned and sliced 'em.  I may actually use 1.5 lbs. next time, just to have a little more meat.  I also used chicken broth instead of water, which made the stew almost too salty, so reduced sodium broth is probably the way to go.  My BF was a little turned off by the lentils, so I may even try a different bean next time, just to change it up a little (an 8 or 16 bean blend would probably be nice).  All in all, a fantastic recipe that will definitely be at the top of my soup list.  UPDATE: I made this again, doubled the chorizo, and used a 13 bean blend in place of just lentils.  Love it, love it, love it!

Delicious stew!  The chorizo gives it a smoky flavor.  I added potatoes and carrots to make it a true one-pot meal, great for a chilly evening'

I had some kale that I needed to use up and I wanted to use it in something that would do dinner and have leftovers for lunch. I used the advanced search on allrecipes to find this. It was great. I think I overcooked it slightly though - my fault.

I'm gonna make this tonight.  Even better if you can find Lamb Chorizo.  I'm drooling as I type.

The people who edited the recipe said to use bulk stuff that crumbles... but I prefer to slice chorizo and fry it a little.

The flavors in this recipe are very, very good, but it's not what I would call a stew.  The only change I made to the recipe was substituting a can of chicken broth for some water (I still used 3 cups of liquid) and it came out more like a thick sauce you would eat over rice than something eaten from a bowl.  In fact, with the exception of the chorizo this had very strong Indian flavors.  It was tasty enough that I'll make it again; the only reason for four stars instead of five is that the "stew" implies it's a meal in itself, whereas it really needs a little something to go with it.  Next time I'll serve it over Basmati rice.

This recipe was good but I thought it lacked in a couple of areas. My family likes A LOT of flavor so that may be why.  I added Corriander to give it a little more brightness.  Next time I will add a leafy green such as Kale.  It could use the texture of something like that and why not fit in something extra nutritious whenever you can?!  I'm looking forward to making this again!

Very very good, and easy for an after-work meal.  Just used italian sausage to tone down the spice a little and added some onions because, well, we put onions in everything :-)  Overall a great recipe. Thanks!

I identified this as an Indian inspried dish right away and I have been so excited to try it! I found it when trying to find a dish to make with Chorizo after I found a veggie soy version of the sause and wanted to try it. I added some potatoes, onions and peas in place of the celery and served with some warm Naan. I also think cauliflower would work really well here too. There is a lot of room for experimentation and variety.  Next time I will make some rice to serve over, this dish is amazing and it going to become a staple in my house.

This was simple and delicious! I added chopped onions (b/c I love them) and a couple peeled and chopped potatoes (to make it more of a one dish meal). I added one cube of a veggie bouillon to round out the flavors and didn't add any salt. I used 2 chicken chorizo sausages that were precooked (Aidelles), so I just diced them and added it in with the onions when I sauteed them.  I added a touch more liquid than called for so it wouldn't be quite as thick, though it was still a thicker stew. Seasonings were basic and delicious!  This one is going in the monthly rotation.

Great flavor, but I made a few modifications.  I sauteed chopped onions with the garlic before adding the chorizo.  I also added chopped carrots, turnip, potatoes, and leeks along with the celery.  Since I added all these extras, I upped the water by another cup and added some chicken bouillon to add more flavor.  This definitely made it more "stew" like.  So great to eat on a cold day!

Added chopped onion and carrot.  My husband REALLY liked it (this is his rating).  It was a bit too much on the spicy side for me - I would give 3 stars or dial things down a notch. Cleared out my sinuses though! It came out more like a chili than a stew, but that was fine.  Served it with a big green salad.

Very good, well liked at my house. I added onions and about a cup of diced butternut squash, both sauteed at the beginning, before adding the chorizo. I also tossed in a bit of leftover diced cooked carrots and green beans near the end of cooking. I served with some hot corn bread.

What a great meal I was able to make!  I served this with the Simple Spiced Rice recipe from this site for a Indian-inspired dinner.  I used Cacique Beef Chorizo, chicken broth instead of water, added 1 tsp of garam masala and no salt or pepper.  I loved the texture, taste and spice!  Thanks!

I enjoyed this hearty dish.  It reminded me more of a chili than stew. Since I didn't have any celery on hand I used dried celery flakes. I started with 3 cups of vegetable broth and ended up adding about 2 more cups. I'm a vegetarian so I used soy chorizo and added potatoes and kale as others suggested.  I made old fashioned cornbread with a little sugar to compliment the chorizo. I would make this dish again.

Fabulous! I soaked the lentils in water for 24 hrs and then used 3 cups of lentils. Small changes: Added 2x the amt of the 3 seasonings, and some extra garlic. I used chorizo that I had already grilled, and then cut in half circles. I made sure I used the celery leaves too, for some added flavor, and a 1/4 cup of parsley. I blended the soup with an immersion blender to make it thicker. Delicious!

Great dish.  When I read some reviews that this dish was too spicy, I was like "Are you kidding me?"  But the very next day, the spices started to kick into the dish.  The only subs I made were red lentils instead of green lentils.  Also, after 17 minutes of simmering, my lentils were done.  But that's probably due to the differences between the red and green lentils.  I actually had to save the dish with a few more cups of water.  One thing, is this an Indian dish or a Latin American dish?  Update:  This dish is spicier the next day.  Bravo

This recipe was really spicy. I'm out in the middle of no where and my grocery store doesn't carry Chorizo so I used italian sausage.  Let's just say it was so spicy I think my soul is burnt.

this was very good.  i used and made my own chicken broth and added some of the meat left from that.  added some kale and carrots also.  we liked the spice of chorizo. i would not have thought to use indian spices, but it works for us.  i should have tossed some flour in with the veggies before adding the broth to have a thicker consistancy for the stew. for me it was more like a soup.  but, either way it was delicious.  thanks for the post Spiderwoman77!

This 'stew' is delicious, though I added a little extra water and some italian spice mix (with a bit of chili in it) to give it a bit more oomph.

I really enjoyed this dish and its quick and so easy to make.  I substituted turkey sausage for chorizo.  I didn't have curry powder on hand but I had jerk seasoning powder. Man did that work out well.  Next time I'll throw in some sauteed onions and chopped potatoes.  It would definitely be great for a rainy day.

We thought this was fantastic, as lentil soups go. And in general as far as any soup goes, this is one of my favorites. I was out of celery so I subbed 2 whole onions and 1 whole grated carrot. I added celery seed to get that flavor in there. When I make this again, I'll have the celery too, but I'll definitely keep the onions and carrot :) Thanks for the recipe, we loved the use of curry powder in this, it made these lentils sing!

This is now one of my favourite stew recipes - I always add in some frozen chopped spinach, and often chop up and toss in whatever veg I have on hand that I need to use up - bet you could use kale as well, will try that next time.  Works great in the slow cooker!

This was really good! When I said what I was making for dinner my girlfriend turned her nose up at it (she doesn't care much for lentils). But after her first bite she was in heaven. I added an onion, some kale, and used chiken broth instead of water. I will make this again.

I didn't have Chorizo so I used Turkey Kielbasa and tossed in a couple of fennel seeds. This was delicious. And healthy, to boot! A genuine keeper!

Excellent.  Flavorful. Spicy, deep rich taste. Made it exactly as listed except I increased cooking time by 10 minutes or so because lentils were not tender to my liking. Highly recommended, especially for cold weather .

This is a great recipe!  I took other reviewers advice and added a teaspoon each of garam masala and coriander, 1 onion, 2 medium potatoes and I used 3 cups of chicken broth and 1 cup water.  I only had a half pound of chorizo on hand and it turned out fine with that.  I think next time I will stick to only 3 cups of liquid, I'd like it to be more stew-ish.  Served over rice it is wonderful!  This is definitely going into the rotation, I may try it with chicken next time.

Don't like the chorizo/lentil combination.  I used Mexican chorizo which we do like, but this was just not for us.  Still glad I tried it though

Like other reviewers I added onions, carrots, potatoes, garam masala, coriander & spinach. But I also added a dash each of red wine vinegar and Worcestershire sauce. That really enhanced the flavors for me. My husband and 3 year old liked it, too! A keeper for sure.

This stew is amazing. I make my own chorizo and so it is always ground chorizo. I put my Lentils in the crock pot with onion, celery, potatoes, carrots, broth/water and spices and in the evening it is an amazing tasty meal that really pleases. I would think this to be a winter meal but I tell you what doing it the crock keeps my house cool and coming home from the lake or pool it really is a great summer meal!

I followed the directions but added about 1/3 of an onion because I love onions in soup.  I didn't find it too spicy or too salty, and I'm generally sensitive to that.  Overall, I liked it a lot.  But I wished it wasn't so thick and that there would have been more hot chorizo flavor.  I think next time I will add at least 2 cups of chicken broth and maybe a bit more chorizo.  I also read another review where some spinach was added, that might be a nice touch when there's more liquid.

Edit:  I made this recipe again and made the following changes--1) add 3 cups of chicken broth, 2) add 1/2 of a medium onion diced, and 3) add 12 oz. ground hot italian sausage.  It was phenomenal!  If that were the original recipe I'd give that 5 stars!

Really, really good as-is and lends itself well to improvisation if you're lacking (or want to add or substitute ingredients). I subbed beef kielbasa for the chorizo which is really hard to get where I live and it was still great. After tasting I wanted to get more creative with the spices, so I threw in a little hot paprika, ginger, coriander seed, and cardamom, then stirred in a little tomato paste that I had leftover from yesterday. I bulked it up more by throwing in some leftover garbanzo beans too, and it tastes an awful lot like channa masala, which I love. I know you could improvise as much as you wanted with the vegetables...basically whatever you like or have hanging around in the fridge would work great. This is a great "all-purpose" Indian curry starter recipe and I had a lot of fun with it. Make it, you'll enjoy it, even as written here. Have fun!

I didn't follow the recipe exactly. Ended up using Italian sausage instead of chorizo and used a pound of meat. Used about half the amount of celery and added half a diced onion. Also added 2 cut up roma tomatoes and a couple handfuls of baby greens at the end. I used 4 cups of chicken broth and 1 cup of water. I did stay true to the amount of lentils and seasonings. The seasonings were perfect and I really enjoyed this dish.

It needed 5 cups of liquid. I used a combo of chicken/beef stock base.  I added 2 large diced carrots, half a bunch of kale, half a large onion, diced, and decreased celery to 3 stalks. I used the seasonings listed except subbed garam masala for the curry powder and added 1 tsp of coriander, and sauteed them with the onion/garlic.  Smells awesome and tastes very good. My chorizo was chicken with Mex seasoning made by my local Sprouts store.

This was so tasty!  I didn't have any celery on hand, so I added one tsp. of celery salt and chopped up carrots and onion along with the garlic.  Everyone loved it, wasn't spicy~but tasty.  Made it easy to please everyone, using the hot sauce at the table.

Delicious, and couldn't be easier! I used linked chorizo (peeled the casing and sliced in 1/4 inch rounds), sauteed in olive oil with sliced onion, garlic, and the spices until slightly browned, then added the lentils and water. I served this to some friends yesterday, and everyone loved it.

Not sure. I liked this quite a bit but then I really like chorizo and I like lentils. But I'm not sure if the combination was anything special since the chorizo flavour is quite strong. I will try this a second time to see and try some other chorizo recipes to compare.   Am updating this review as I made this again - I know I was ravenous but it is soooo tasty. I don't think I would make this for friends for a full dinner but its very good as a supper - a small amount is very filling - or just a smaller evening meal - with crusty bread which takes a little edge of the spicyness - yes, its a keeper!

I left out the turmeric and cut the celery down to one rib. This was delicious and very filling, although my family couldn't be tempted to try it, they're not big lentil eaters. This one is going in my favorite recipes binder!

Never really made lentils before and this was the perfect recipe for a first timer. I did make some tweeks due to what I had/didn't have on hand. Didn't use celery, didn't use curry, didn't use, turmeric. DID use 1 chopped red onion, DID use 1/2 teaspoon dried crushed oregano, DID use 1 cooking spoon of spanish style tomato sauce, DID use 1 packet of ham bouillon, DID stir in cilantro at the end. DELISH!!!!!!!!!!

Delicious!!  I followed the recipe, except for using chicken broth in place of water and I added a small onion as the 1st step.  I also used a good chorizo sausage link, sliced.  It's a keeper -- thank you!!

The flavor profile of this dish is very nice! I was a bit iffy on combining chorizo with Indian spices, but it turned out well. I wilted spinach into it at the end so I felt like I was being a bit healthier. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that it was soooo thin. Next time I make it, I will either decrease the liquid or increase the lentils.

EXCELLENT!!! Used sliced chicken chorizo links. Added 1 small diced onion, 2 chicken bouillon cubes, 2 sliced carrots, 2 cubed russet potatoes, a few sliced cherry tomatoes that were threatening to go bad, and 1/2 bag baby spinach. Served with warmed Naan. DYN-O-MITE!! rave reviews from the fam.

If you want this to resemble a stew/soup, you will need to double the liquid. I don't understand having chorizo with the spices listed. It was just ok. I'm going to stick to my usual lentil soup recipe.

The only way to go is to use Basque (instead of mexican) Chorizos. They are very hard to find but Gem Meat Packing Company in Boise Idaho makes the best and most authentic Basque chorizos that can be shipped all over the country. Every Basque like me knows exactly where to get them.

Good recipe.  I added 1 tsp of garam masala (for more spice), and 1 can of black beans.  I think more liquid is definitely needed for it to be a stew - maybe about 5 cups.

Perfect! We do not have chorizo in Slovenia, so I used some local sausage. I also replaced curry with 1/2 t cayenne pepper and added half cup of bulgur at the end.

It was wonderful for a cold winter night.  I used French lentils and Niman Ranch chorizo links.  I did not use celery, but instead used an onion and 3 cloves of garlic.  I also used a teaspoon of smoked Spanish paprika instead of curry.  I could see pairing this with a nice green salad and some crusty bread.

To make this a meal in a dish, we added sliced carrots, gr. peppers and pork loin in bite size pieces. I had a chorizo sausage on hand and just used it sliced. Used chicken broth instead of water. I didn't have dried lentils so used a can of black beans and it was very good. We did increase the spices though, especially the curry. Finished this with chopped cilantro.  Very nice!

This dish was similar to a meal we had in a fabulous French restaurant.  I added about 4 boneless skinless chicken thighs cut into bite size pieces.  Great flavor and is even better the next day.

This was very good, but seemed to be missing something. The following day I added cut up chicken to the leftovers and it seemed to give it a more well rounded flavor.

Cheap, nutritious, filling, and delicious.  An excellent soup that I look forward to making lots this fall/winter.  Not pretty colour-wise, but anyone brave enough to try it will fall in love.  Has the power to make believers out of celery/lentil haters.  Make sure you keep an eye on the water level, adding more if necessary.  (Modifications: I had 4 or 5 new potatoes I wanted to use, so I cut lentils back to 2/3c and used 2c of water/stock to start with, adding more when it looked low.  On the suggestion of other reviewers, I added a tbsp of tomato paste with the spices and a few handfuls of spinach at the very end.)

This is very nice, I used a little less Chorizo - 225g and next time I am going to add a coule of Red Chilli as I did not find it spicy at all.   As others have suggested, adding other bits and bobs such as potato and carrots is a good idea as it is so rich.   We ate with buttered granary bread.   Thanks for the recipe.

This was wonderful. I did use caution since I have a 3 year old.  Didn't want to go overboard with the spice. Omitted the extra spices because the Chorizo itself has plenty of it.. My husband really enjoyed this.. Thanks

Apart from omitting the celery (I was making it for Husband, and he doesn't like cooked celery), I made this as written, and really wasn't impressed with the flavor. I ended up adding in some sauteed onions and jalapenos, a handful of chopped fresh cilantro, and a few Tbsps of tomato paste mixed with chicken broth. It was ok - a little too salty - but nothing to really go crazy about. This was pretty healthy but not something I'd make again. Thanks ahyway!

Not my favorite.  It was a little too hot, without being all that flavorful, for me.  ***** I have to change my rating from three stars to one.  I'd been generous at first, but really, it didn't deserve all three stars.

Really good! I added potatoes and carrots which were a delicious addition. I also sauteed mushroom with the garlic. Love the flavors!! Instead of salt I used one beef bullion cube with the 3 cups of water and it was perfect.

Tried it with 400 grams of chorizo salami and a little smoked bacon. I like the flavor, but it is a little salty - I guess bulk chorizo is less salty tasting than the sausage / slicing kind?

This was great. I had to add a few more vegetables because I was not able to use celery. I added carrots in place of the celery. At the end I added red bell pepper and fresh spinach. We had it as a lunch meal rather than a dinner meal. Took some to work the next day (and I took some the day after that) and it worked out great. Even the 4 year old ate it!

Although I modified this recipe somewhat, I still want to pass along my rave review. Based on others' comments, I substituted italian sausage for the chorizo and added a bag of pre-washed spinach, a small bag of mini-carrots (too lazy to slice carrots, I guess), and a measure of coriander equal to that of the other spices.  I also used canned chicken broth instead of the called-for water (something I routinely do for most soups).  Good, warming wintertime soup!  Thanks!

Geez, I did not like this at all...I made huge additions: carrots, diced onions,coriander,all spice, lemon juice, nutmeg, small potatoes and a can of beef broth.  3 cups of water could NOT feed 4 people.  I added 5 + the broth!
I must say after ALL these additions, I would give it 4***, but it just was good on its own....

This was simply too spicy for my husband and I, and we like spicy. I think if I had used a different brand/kind of chorizo this might have tasted really good. I may try it again with something milder. It's not going in my box as is however.

Great base recipe. I used the Mexican style pork chorizo and it turned out great. I definitely made this my own, using a 16 oz. bag of lentils, subbed 6 cups chicken broth for the water, only 2 ribs celery, added onions, carrots and spinach. I held off on the turmeric and curry powder and used cumin, crushed red pepper, oregano and tomato paste.

This was really gross. First off- i used Mexican Chorizo Sausage which basically cooks down into what looks like hamburger which made this dish look like dog food and it didnt taste much better. I think if i would have used another type of link sausage this recipe would be much much better. My suggestion: use link sausage and stay away from the Mexican Chorizo!

Wow!  I'm usually pretty stingy with my stars but I would give this one a 6 if I could.  So easy and SO tasty.  I modified a bit by adding a thawed, drained package of frozen spinach to "up" the nutrient value and squeeze in some greens.  It tasted terrific!  This recipe is going in my regular rotation - thank you!

Budget Chili - that's what I'd rename this dish. And it's good, so spicy that I had to eat mine on rice. I'm not really a chili person so I'll probably not make this again. But why are the directions so complicated? Couldn't I have skipped the olive oil and browned the garlic right along with browning the meat - would it really have changed the flavor?

We loved it!  We are vegetarians so we used no meat chorizo and sausage, we added carrots, onions and hatch peppers served with corn bread. Yummy

I added potatoes, broccoli, onions and carrots. Incredibly simple, tasty and easy. Highly recommend. I am not an experienced cook and this is a great one pot meal. I made enough for several meals with this one recipe. Great for leftovers

This was one of the best soups I've ever made.  I actually woke up thinking about it!  We have a local shop that makes 5 different chorizos!   I also used chicken stock, added 2 chopped carrots (wouldn't be soup w/o them) and added chopped kale.  It is delicious.  I'd made spicy cornbread that morning and added side of avacado and feta on top.  Super good.  Def repeat.  Thanks so much for sharing!

Good bite to it! Though I feel like the ration of chorizo to lentil is too high; the lentils get lost at the listed amount. I would also add spinach and carrots and okra next time. Overall, yum!

I've never tried combining lentils and chorizo into a dish before but was trying to use up what I had on hand without having to make a trip to the store. This recipe was yummy! And so easy.

The flavors were very good but it ended up being kind of dry. It was more like a side dish than a stew or soup. I would suggest adding much more broth and you may even have to add some more while reheating leftovers.

This was very tasty. Trying to make more vegetarian meals and this is a keeper. I used just over half a lemon and seemed perfect. I added a little Rosemary as others suggested.  I also increased the lentils to 1.5 cups given the ant of liquid.  Delicious!

I only put in 1 clove of garlic as I am not a huge garlic fan. I also left out the curry powder. I followed Todd Dakin's advice and added the 2 T of tomato paste along with the chicken stock instead of water, and it was perfect

Delicious! This hit the spot and was fairly easy to make.  I would have preferred for the directions to say 'chop' instead  of slice but I don't think it matters.  We will definitely be making this again!!!

I made a few minor modifications to the recipe.  I used Better than Bouillon Chicken instead of just water and added shrimp at the end.  I served it with rice.  The picky kids even loved it!

Delicious!! I made homemade chicken stock by using my pressure cooker and cooking two roasted chicken carcasses (after the meat had been removed) with water.  I used this stock in the stew rather than water and it enhanced an already tasty recipe. I also cooked the chorizo first and drained off excess fat, then cooked the onion and garlic with the meat.  I didn't want to drain away flavors and vitamins with the fat. I followed someone else's lead and added cubed potatoes and carrots.  My last change to the recipe was to stir in a couple of tablespoons of tomato paste at the end of cooking. This added additional nutritive value and enlivened the flavors a bit.  We ate with a salad and a hearty bread for a truly scrumptious meal.  I'd give it seven stars if I could.
