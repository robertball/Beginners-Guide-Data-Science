Although I love all of the ingredients and was really looking forward to trying it, I found that this drink had a very odd taste.  I ended up throwing it out, and I followed the recipe exactly.

I have been searching for this recipe!  I had it at a bar one night, and have not been anywhere that knows how to correctly make it.  Thank you for the recipe!  If you are having problems with the recipe, make sure that the top, middle, and bottom layers do not mix.  Keeping the layers separate makes it taste a lot better.  Hope that helps!

I am writting this review the day after having had it at a  sportsbar. The bartender must have known about this drink. Because all I did was write down the ingreds and it did indeed come layered. It was very tasty. Love the name. Really good day, we went to dinner and I ordered the alligator appitizer. Lol had more gater in one day then I have in my whole Life!  Thanks Dr.S

The  taste was good but to layer it it must be done a certain way when you add the raspberry and yager otherwise you get one reddish brown color

I make this all the time, more as shots or short cocktails.  I never used anything other than the raspberry, melon, and Jager.  It's great without the extras (such as the juice, or in some recipes, sweet & sour mix).  I don't mind the addition of the coconut rum, which I never saw before this recipe - not too shabby.  To help with sinking the raspberry to the bottom, turn a spoon over face down and touch the inside edge of your cocktail glass.  Slowly drizzle the raspberry onto the spoon and down the inside of the glass. ;-)
