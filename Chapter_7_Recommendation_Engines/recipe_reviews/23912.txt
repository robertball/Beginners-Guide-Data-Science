I made this for a mom's group that I'm a part of and the ladies loved it!  There was only about a spoonfull left over.  Like others, I used 4 eggs and about 2 1/2 cups of cheese.  I also used the smaller crispy crowns tater tots and baked them for about 10 minutes before adding them to the casserole because I noticed other posters said the tots were a little mushy and it seemed to do the trick.  This one is a keeper.

Wonderful recipe!  I frequently use bring this to company breakfasts.  I refrigerate the recipe overnight, and stick it in the oven before work.  I usually substitute bacon for sausage, but have also made it meatless!  Increasing the eggs to 4 makes a huge difference!  If you are cooking it after it has been refrigerated, and are using 4 eggs, increase the temperature to 375, and cook for about 40-50 minutes.

We all loved this! I used Turkey Sausage, egg substitute, skim milk and Crispy Crowns   instead. I also baked the Crispy Crowns about halfway first and placed them in the pan crunchy side down. The only complaint was that there were no leftovers! MMMMMMMMMM says it all!

mmm...mmm...mmm..Everyone liked it, even my picky eaters. I used 4 eggs instead of 2, was worried it might come out to runny with only 2. With the 4 eggs, it came out with a quiche like texture. Will definately make again. Think I'm gonna try bacon next time!! thanks for the recipe...its nice to have something new for breakfast!

I made this for my daughter's slumber party, and all 7 of the girls (11 year olds) loved it and wanted seconds.  My husband ate what was left, and loved it so much that is going to the store for more tater tots so we can have this again today!!  I also used 3 cups of cheese, and 4 eggs, cooked it at 375 degrees for 40 mins...delicious!!!

This recipe is wonderful. Made it several times. It's my granddaughter's favorite. But using 4 eggs and increasing cheese to 3 cups makes it even better. Also increase baking time few more minutes.

I've made this a couple times now, both times increasing the eggs by 2 and the cheese to three cups.  Cook temp of 375 degrees for 40-45 minutes and topped with a bit more shredded cheese and heated just until melted.

I've substituted shredded beef for the breakfast sausage and served for dinner.  Yum.
I added some more flavor by adding a bit of salsa to suit my taste.

I had a small group of women and their babies over for an afternoon, and was looking for an easy casserole to make.  I was a little hesitant to make a tater-tot casserole at first...it just didn't seem "adult" enough.  And, my husband is very "anti-casserole"...he doesn't like them in general.  But, since the ingredients seemed simple, and it WAS, after all, a Moms group, I decided to try it.  They LOVED it.  Everyone absolutely RAVED about it!  I couldn't believe it...and every person, INCLUDING my husband who snuck into the kitchen for the goodies, went back for seconds!  I did use 4 eggs and 3 cups of cheese as others had suggested, and it worked out perfectly.  I have already given out the recipe to friends, and will use this recipe often myself!

Oddly addictive!  Used the popular brand sausage substitute and an additional egg (as recommended by previous reviews) it did need salt but it seemed the more I ate the more I liked it.  My toddler tore it up! I did have to add a bit of salt and pepper.

Great recipe! I cooked the sausage the night before.  The next morning, I pretty much cooked the tater tots fully (maybe 5 mins. short of full cooking time) and put them in a 9x13 pan as a base.  I crumbled the sausage over tots and poured the 2 cups of milk and 6 egg mixture over everything.  I finished it off with 3 handfulls of cheese.  Cooked for 40ish minutes to a nice goldern brown.  It came out FABULOUS!  The tots "melted" together and came out very much like hash browns with eggs, sausage and cheese on top.  The extra extra eggs gives it much more flavor and makes it more substantial.  Season to taste.  Will be giving up the bread version of this as the tots give much better flavor!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This recipe can go from good to wonderful with a few changes: 
4 eggs total (as others suggested)
More cheese
Pre-baking the tater tots
AND some seasoning!  I love paprika, garlic powder, Trader Joe's 21 Seasoning Salute and salt & Pepper.  The seasoning really takes this to a new level.  I've also mixed in about 2 tbs of hot sauce to the milk before for a crowd that likes spicy things and it was a hit.

I just tried this and it was delicious!!! I changed a few things and it was the perfect consistency and flavor. First I diced & cooked both 1/2lb of sausage and one package of thick cut bacon. I placed the meat in the bottom of a 3qt casserole dish and sprinkled 1/2 cup of the shredded cheese over the meat. Then I mixed 4 eggs, 2 cups of milk, 1 cup of shredded cheese, 4 ounces of softened cream cheese, salt, pepper, and some garlic salt in a mixing bowl until the eggs are whisked and the consistency is a smooth as it can be with all those ingredients. Then pour the mixture over the sausage, bacon & cheese. Once the mixture is down I topped it with a 1lb bag of extra-crispy ora-ida tater tots. I have no idea how I would have fit the recommended 2lbs of tots on my casserole as 1lb more than adequately covered my casserole. I then baked at 350 for 25 minutes. At the end of the bake time, I sprinkled the remaining 1/2 cup of cheese over the top of the tater tots and baked another 10 minuted. Then I let it stand for 5 minuted and it was perfect. Not to milky. Not bland. Just perfect! Give it a shot. I guarantee you'll enjoy it!

This is a great base recipe that you can adapt to suit ingredients you have on hand, or to switch things up a bit! Great for left over tater tots!  Last night we gave it a "taco" flare.  Used ground beef, taco seasoning, and a mexican cheese blend.  Also followed other recommendations and used 4 eggs.  Thanks for the recipe!

A hit for my family.  Only gave it 4 stars because it is a little to milky. Needed some salt and pepper to taste too.  I  used turkey sausage the first time and made as per recipe.  The second time I decreased Milk to 1/2 cup. The third time I made in 13 x 9 and used 6 eggs and 1 cup milk which came out perfect. 

Sometimes I add chopped onion and bell pepper instead of sausage so  I can serve the sausage or bacon on the side. Our family like to top it with salsa before eating it.  Thanks for sharing.

My family loves this recipe.  I do make some changes.  I use a combo of bacon, ham and spicy sausage.  The more meat the better in our house.  I do also use 4 eggs like many others have suggested and I use tater tot crowns....and before putting them on top of the casserole I cook them in the oven so they are nice and crispy for the final product.  Great recipe.

Used some fresh pork sausage and it turned out great, but way to much for two people! Even with leftovers.

4 eggs, 1 c. munster, 1 c. swiss & 1 c. evaporated milk (=1/2 c. evap + 1/2 c. water, in addition to 1 c. reguler whole milk) was what I had on hand when I made this the 2nd time, Plus, I added, as suggested, onions & mushrooms to the milk/egg mixture before pouring on. Came out quich-y, but REALLY yummy! (I might add ham next time.) I also precooked the Tots for 10 minutes, as per anothers' helpful suggestion :-)  *I made this recipe as written the 1st time & it was really good, too, except for the mushy Tots. I'd use it again, if that's all I had on hand. For me, it turned out to be a great "base" recipe. Thanks!

After reading some of the reviews I followed some of the suggestions, used 5 eggs, more cheese, tater tots with onion, a good dose of pepper, 1 cup 2% milk,(what I had on hand), and 1 cup of half and half.  Was pretty good for a quick week night meal; served with biscuits and fresh sliced tomatoes.

pre cooked tots with seasoning (garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, s & p). 2 eggs to 2 cups milk sounded way too soupy so I went with 5 eggs. I increased cheese to 3 cups and used one cup for topping.

This was great!!  Easy to whip up the night before and so handy to bake the next morning.  This casserole has been a treat at our Sunday School breakfasts more times then I can count!!  Great recipe.  I also used 4 eggs and added a little hot pepper flakes to kick it up a notch!  Love it!!

As some others recommended, I used 4 eggs instead of 2, and I put the tater tots in the oven to cook while it was preheating. I think the 
Crispy Crown-type tots will work better, too. I also added some spices, and I think green chilis will be GREAT in it! Everyone liked it a lot!

I love this recipe! I have made it as instructed, I have made custom versions with bacon and ham, we've had it for supper, breakfast and lunch, I made two pans of it for breakfast after a bachelorette party, everyone has LOVED it!! I do like to bake the tater tots as directed on the bag before putting them on top and then I smother the casserole with more cheddar cheese in the last few minutes of baking :D

I have changed this to 4 eggs and I do like it better. I have not tried crisping the tater tots first but it sounds like it would be good.

This is amazing! I added salt, pepper, and garlic of course! I also added an extra egg. I topped it off with green onions and salsa! We will be making this for holidays to come.

Great tasting and easy.  I cut this down to a 5-serving recipe the first try and I still ate half of it.  I thawed frozen tater tots and they came out crunchy.  To determine how many tots to use I just spread them out in the casserole before cooking.  I seasoned the sausage with a clove of garlic and a dash of red pepper, and added salt and pepper to the egg/mixure.

Fabulous! I halved the recipe but used 3 eggs, and I'm so glad I did. I didn't have much hope for this recipe because twas so simple, but what a pleasant surprise! I will definitely be making this regularly from now on. Thanks for a great recipe!

My family LOVED this. I've made this several times. The second time I made it..I added ground chuck with the sausage, and added bacon peices.  I always make it in a huge pan and there aren't any leftovers.

I made the 8x8" version using the 5 serving calculation with 2 eggs and 1.5 cups cheese. I followed others advice and precooked the tater tots for 10 mins on 450 degrees.  I used Sage seasoned sausage. Then I cooked for 45 mins on 375 as another reviewer suggested.  It was done perfectly.  I would say this meal is more brunch or lunch since you can't really taste the egg.  It is very good if you make these adjustments.

It's exactly as advertised, simple and satisfying! Gave it three stars because the cook time was so far off- mine took an additional 15-20 minutes with the temperature turned up to 375 to set up! Next time will add more eggs & some onion! I saved the sausage grease and made a pan of gravy while this baked and served on top- yum!

This is now in our dinner rotation.  I have made several adjustments to make it lower fat and meat free, but the taste is still terrific!  I use Morning Star farms veggie sausage patties, triple the eggs (fat-free egg substitute), half cheddar/half mozzarella, and use frozen fat-free cubed potatoes (like for hash browns).  My family loves it!

I doubled the eggs, and my husband's comment was "it doesn't taste like there are eggs involved" -- cutting back on the milk would probably help.  I added 1/4 spicy sausage to the regular sausage, which gave it really nice flavor!

It was soupy -- maybe putting it back in the oven for another 10 minutes would help.

Tasty, but I didn't get a quiche consistency :-(.

This is very similar to a skillet recipe I used, but easier because I don't have to stand by the stove or cut up potatos. I added bell peppers, mushrooms, and onions before the cheese so I could get some vegetables. They turned out well. I also had to increase the temperature to 375 because the egg mixture was still to runny. Overall a good recipe and something I will be cooking again.

I exchanged 1lb ground turkey for the sausage and added garlic to the meat as it was cooking.  I made this for my boyfriend and our roommate for dinner and it disappeared fast, they loved it.  This will become one of my semi-regular recipes for the house.

I followed some of the other reviewers tips to add 2 more eggs and more cheese.  I cooked the tator tots a little first, and I used the pre-cooked sausage.  Picky kids loved this and went back for seconds!!!  Definitely a keeper!!

Cooked tator tots in the oven for 10 minutes before placing on casserole.  Might even try 15 next time.  Troy thought it tated like a croissanwich.

Great for family who enjoys breakfast potatoes.  Made a 1/2 recipe since I only had a half-bag of tater tots. It tasted yummy and reheats nicely in the microwave for a hot breakfast the next morning.

The first time I make something, I always follow the recipe as written.  However, I really wish I would have followed other reviews and used 4 eggs instead of only 2.  Also, not being a big fan of sausage, next time I will use bacon or ham and add onions and green pepper.

This was really good, and my family ate the whole pan!  I used four eggs, like others had suggested and baked the tater tots at 450 for ten minutes before putting them on top of the casserole.  I put a bunch of cheese, probably 3 cups altogether.  We ate it for supper because we often eat "breakfast-type" suppers.  This recipe is worth a try if you like the ingredients.  You could easily substitute cooked bacon or ham as well.

This is one of the easiest, and most delicious breakfast casserole recipes I've ever used!  I used Tennessee Pride hot breakfast sausage and didn't even have to add any more seasonings to it!  While frying the sausage, I also added 1 cup diced onion.  You can add or subtract things from the main recipe to make it as simple or complex as you want.  I just can't say enough about this one...I'll be making it a LOT!

My husband and son really liked this.  I made it as written but added some onion which I sauted and some minced garlic.  We love onion and garlic.  It also took about 60 minutes to bake.  I used an inserted knife to check if it was done.

Yummy!  Thanks, Nelda.  We aren't big tater tot fans normally, but this was great for Christmas breakfast.  I used spicy sausage and turned on the convection oven at the very end to get crispy tots.  Super good.

It's a crowd pleaser! Made this for a family brunch this morning. Very similar to my go-to breakfast casserole recipe, which uses bread, mustard, swiss. I doubled this and used twice the sausage, six eggs, eye-balled the half and half, it was maybe a cup, added a few spoonfulls of cream cheese and sour cream to the egg mix and seasoned it with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and a little cayenne. Served with green onions on the side. Very easy and delicious..thanks for posting it.

I used the concept of this recipe as a guide more than a real recipe.  I didn't measure anything.  I browned sausage and sauteed some onions and lined the bottom of my pan with the mix.  Then topped with a liberal lair of cheese and poured egg substitute over the whole thing until it was almost even.  Then I topped with tater tots (which I had cooked in the oven 5-10min to get some moisture out and to help them get crispy, also sprinkled garlic powder and onion powder on them).  I didn't add milk at all and when it was all done, while I let it sit, I topped with cheese.  It's a really yummy breakfast that you could make for a big group that would be quick.  It's def not intended to be a gourmet soufle, so don't expect it to be!

This is a very simple and delicious dish, especially when you make it the night before and pop it in the oven the next morning.  I have a similar recipe I am thinking of posting as well.  My one and only suggestion for this recipe, that I personally do myself, is to allow the Tater Tots to thaw while still in the bag.  Then I break them up before mixing the ingredients all together.  It looks nicer, presentation wise, and actually tastes better since they tend to really absorb the eggs, sausage and cheese better when they are broken up.

I was quite disappointed after reading the reviews for this recipe. I even sorted them by most helpful and used 4 eggs and 3 cups of cheese. This was an ok recipe. I made it for a church function and it was bland. It needs a bit more tweaking before it gets 4 or 5 stars from me.

This was a good recipe when you need alot of food quickly and inexpensively. The only thing I did different was add diced onion when I was cooking the sausage and add 2 extra eggs. Also you might consider adding a little cheese to the top a few minutes before you get it out of the oven. Overall, a keeper.

This was a hit with most of picky eaters in my family.  I listened to alot of the reviews and added more cheese and 4 eggs.  I think it needed to cook maybe 5-10 minutes longer and it would've been even better.  I will still make this again and again.

Overall a great starter recipe. I made a few changes according to my preferences. I used 4 eggs instead of 2. I also thought it needed more meat. So, I tried 2 Lbs. of pork sausage. I also tried 1 Lb. pork sausage combined with 1 Lb. bacon. It gave it much better flavor and texture. Mmmmmmmmm....

What a cool idea!  The tater tots might as well be hashbrowns.  This was easy and tastes great.  You hardly notice the eggs being in it, I guess they act more as a binder.  I would add extra eggs next time like the others suggest.  It's an easy recipe and it tasted good the next day too.

This recipe is SOOO good!!!  It smells so good which is a fabulous precursor to eating it.  I removed the casing from some breakfast links, cooked that like ground sausage and doubled the eggs.  35 minutes wasn't enough - I threw it in for another 10 and then was worried the eggs were overcooked, but it was fantastic.  I scaled it for 4 and my boyfriend ate 3/4 of it until he couldn't eat anymore and it was entirely gone.  When I've made this the day of, it's worked out perfectly. When I made this the night before, following the recipe, the casserole came out really soggy, there was a watery mess.

I followed the advice of some of the others here and doubled the eggs.  We also used Morningstar Sausage Links for a vegetarian version and that worked really well!

I made this with 4 eggs and 3 cups of cheese (all I had) per other suggestions. My wife and I both liked it, but it was a tad greasy. In the future I will use the reduced fat cheese to reduce the greasyness as well as drain the sausage thouroughly under some hot water. But over all pretty good!

This was great!  Very easy to make and everyone liked it.  I did follow the suggestions of using 4 eggs and 4 cups of cheese.  I used sharp cheddar and monterrey jack cheeses.  I put it together the night before, stuck it in the fridge, and added the tater tots in the morning.  Worked just fine, although I did have to increase the cooking time a bit, probably  since everything was starting cold.  I'll be making this one again.

We liked it very much and also doubled the eggs. Good suggestion. The only thing I did different was add sliced green onions and S & P. This would make great breakfast burritos with the leftovers.

The recipe is good as is. After a few times of making it I added about a half pound of sausage and used 8 eggs. To me and my family it made a world of difference. I would also change the picture that shows up, it looks burnt and not very good.

Thanks for that great "tip" at the bottom to use foil to make clean up easier. I lined the bottom of the pan with foil and the dish was so good after I peeled the foil off and picked it out of my teeth!

My family doesn't eat pork. I know bacon is missed. I have substituted turkey bacon, shredded turkey ham, turkey sausage, chicken sausage and homemade beef sausage. I use colby jack, Mexican blend cheese, taco cheese or a mix that sounds good at the time. I have used milk, almond milk, skim milk usually  only 1 cup. I use 4 eggs or egg substitute or 6 egg whites. I increase the oven temp to 375° and increase the cooking time to 45 to 50 minutes,  but since all ovens are different, I start checking after 30 minutes.  

If I make for dinner  I add some veggies like green onion, finely chopped  broccoli or spinach, green peppers or finely chopped jalapeños. I have made a taco version with taco seasoned ground turkey, beef or chicken.  There is no end to the options. My family loves it. I usually serve with gravy and biscuits or toast, just depends on how many people are eating. This is so easy and adaptable.

Everyone loved this casserole! I followed other reviewers and increased the eggs and cheese, 5 eggs and 3 cups of cheese.  I added salt and pepper to the egg/milk mixture and used Ore Ida Extra Crispy tater tots--I did not pre-bake the tots, but did broil for a few minutes when the casserole was done and they were crispy, not soggy at all. I set this up the night before, minus the tots, and also followed the 375 degrees/45 minute bake time--perfection!

Made it for an office breakfast this morning. It was a big hit and several people asked for the recipe. I used four eggs as others suggested and half and half because that's all I had. Will be making this again. Would be perfect for Christmas morning breakfast.

I have not had my family complain once about this recipe.  I do use an extra egg and last night I added cubed ham to the mix.  I also swapped out American cheese for the cheddar due to not having cheddar on hand last night.  It's good as written or with the minor changes.  I always get the same response "It's good!"

Tweeted it a bit. For a big casserole dish I used a dozen eggs and 1 1/2 cups of milk. Came out a lot more fluffier. Also cook tater tots (as directed on package) separately then place on ALL READY COOKED egg mixture then bake a bit more to melt together

Really good! Added some extra stuff, onion, salt & pepper, garlic powder, an extra egg, and cut back the milk to 3/4 cup and added 1/4 sour cream. Next time I think I'll add some fresh diced tomato, or a can of rotel would be nice! Thanks for the awesome recipe!! :)

Wow, this is go good.  I added a small onion with the pork sausage.  The key is to let it sit for 10 minutes so it sets up.

I'm a teacher and it was my turn to host breakfast for my staff. I was looking for something hot and easy. This recipe seemed perfect. I did alter the recipe a bit. I added 4 eggs and used cut up sausage links instead of what the original recipe called for. I made two of them and added a can of green chilis to one. Next time I may add some salsa as well. They were both a huge hit. I had multiple people ask me for the recipe. I did make it the night before like it states, which made the day of much easier.

This is sooooo GOOD! I am not a breakfast casserole person, but I LOVE this one.  From now on, this will be the only breakfast casserole that I make.  The only change I made was to reserve some of the cheese to sprinkle on top about 10 minutes before it was ready to come out of the oven. I make this for the first day of school/exam weeks for my son.  Make it the night before, and pop it in the oven in the morning.

My family loves this recipe! It is so yummy.  I do alter it a little and add bacon just because my family loves bacon.

This was an awesome dish. I did make some changes, as the others. I doubled the eggs and cheese, added garlic powder and pepper for a bit more taste. Everyone loved it, some suggested adding bacon so I think I'll do that the next time I prepare this! Thanks!

Perfect dish for a buffet and/or pot luck.  The only change I made was to add 2 extra eggs.  It is the type of recipe you could easily add seasonings/ingred. for your own tastes....but, to serve a group of people, it works great.  As someone recommended I pre-baked the tater tots about 10 min. before putting them on top.

This is a delicious, fast, and very simple recipe to make! It's fun to whip up on random mornings/early afternoons and give everyone a little treat! I replaced the pork with turkey bacon, used 4 eggs instead of 2 like everyone suggested, and was extremely liberal with the cheese (around 3-4 cups)! I've used both tater tots and crispy crowns and liked the tots better, not that it makes a huge difference. I've also reheated it in the oven and it was still great, didn't dry out at all! It's even good cold. It's too bad it's so bad for you, otherwise I'd be making it a lot more!

This is pretty good, but could've used some seasoning or extra flavor. I do like how easy it is to make, and the minimal amount of ingredients.

The hardest part about this recipe was shredding the cheddar cheese! The only thing lacking was some seasoning. I used salt/pepper/garlic powder on the meat and liberally sprinkled the same mixture into the eggs. As others suggested, I used 4 eggs instead of two and this was the perfect amount.

This was great! Changes I made: Omitted meat completely, used four eggs, and two cups of cheese. I put the egg/milk mixture in the pan first, then dropped in the tater tots (which I had baked for about ten minutes first) and covered it all with the cheese. Baked it for 45 minutes and it was perfect! It was also great served with ketchup on the side.

This was a great recipe and so simple to make! I did however, make a few changes. I added chopped green pepper and chopped onion to the sausage as it was browning. I also used ground Italian sausage as I had no regular breakfast sausage on hand. I also added 2 extra eggs. Thank you for this nice basic breakfast dish!

Great Budget Casserole. My 5 pickiest eater loved it! Like other reviewers I used 4 eggs and 3 cups of milk. I topped the casserle with Parmesan Cheese. I baled it ay 375 for 35-40min. Next time I will fluff it up a bit with onion and mushrooms and green peppers! Delicious and simple!

Pretty good! It was a nice breakfast for dinner recipe, and I think it would be very kid friendly. Please don't be afraid to add plenty of your own seasonings and spices. When I make it again, I will use alots of garlic, onion, pepper, season salt, little bit of hot sauce. We also used hot sausage! Remember that potatoes and eggs soak up lots of flavor so season liberaly!

I definitely enjoyed the taste of this, the only problem I had was that after baking for a while, it still wasn't set up in the middle, so I think I will do what some others have and add an extra egg.

This is so good. I did however modify it somewhat. I added chopped onion and black pepper and used six eggs instead of two and I'm glad that I did because the tater tots is what you can taste the most and I think with only two eggs the potatoes would have overpowered everything else. I also added more cheese to the top and baked it again until the cheese was melted. This is definately a keeper.

This is a holiday staple in my home, although I have never made it with so few ingredients.  Try adding salsa or a sm can of Ortega chilies and black olives or pepperoni and sun dried tomatoes mozzarella instead of cheddar or pre-thawed and very well drained frozen spinach and Swiss and a can of mushrooms or...it’s very malleable.  Anything I would consider as omelet constituents would work in this recipe.  My family has come to expect it as a part of every holiday that includes brunch or an overnight stay

I make the dinner version of this often and love the breakfast version very much! My variation includes:
4 eggs (For the same reasons stated above)
Sauteed mushroom, onion, ect. 
Colby-Jack cheese rather than cheddar for the flavor.
Turkey sausage

A friend tried a low fat version with the turkey sausage, low fat cheese and such and it turned out just as yummy :) This is one of those recipies that no matter what you add (mostly) it is always good!

I would have given this a *** but it was very easy to make and my husband and son loved it.  I thought it was lacking in flavor.  I added minced chives, salt and pepper, and extra cheddar ontop as per other reviews, and it still didn't wow me.  If I try this again, I will probably go for a more savory sausage meat, and add more seasonings.  It was very easy to prepare last night and throw in the oven for an easy Christmas breakfast, though.

I made this for Christmas Eve breakfast today.  I used 4 eggs, kept the milk the same, added an additional cup of cheese on top for the last 15 minutes of cooking.  Baked at 350 for 50 minutes total.  Added salt, pepper and garlic powder to the egg mixture.  It was FANTASTIC!  Six of us ate the entire casserole in one sitting!  Excellent recipe!

DELICIOUS. Didn't read all the reviews before I made it and only used two eggs.  However, I didn't use as much milk because I thought it would be too runny. It came out perfect. Made it for breakfast and it was very yummy later in the evening too! Will definately make again. It was SO EASY.

This recipe was GREAT!! Quick, easy, and everyone loved it.  I was a bit unsure at first, especially since I was serving for dinner, but I bought a 5 pound bag of tater tots and needed to do something with them (those sale items get ya, haha).  It was GREAT!!! I cut the recipe in half since there are only 4 of us (2 adults, 3 year old and 18 month old).  It's a great base recipe, but if you're making for dinner I STRONGLY recommend throwing in chopped green pepper and chopped onion, and season with a bit of pepper.  I used sage flavored sausage, but added about a tablespoon and a half of syrup while browning (to give a TINY bit of maple flavor), and added an extra egg.  It was SURPRISINGLY yummy!!! My husband thought I was crazy at first, but he loved it! Will definitely make again!!!

All I have to say is this recipe is so good that it was gone very soon after being made.  I used a sage-flavored breakfast sausage, two eggs and extra cheese.

Very good and so easy.  Used previous suggestions of green pepper and onion and found sausage blended with bacon.  Used 4 eggs and cooked 375 for 45 min.  A little cheese on top and everyone had multiple servings.

Wonderful recipe - I make it all the time.  I use the 4 eggs and add more cheese.  It does seem to take longer to fully cook than the stated 35-40 minutes, but this may be because of the extra eggs.  I am going to try raising the oven temp slightly next time.  Perfect for brunches, breakfasts, you name it - good for picky eaters.  I have tried it with various meats, prepackaged cubed ham being my favorite because it was easiest and tasted great.

I made a couple of alterations.  I used 4 eggs, about a cup of milk, and a little less cheese.  I thought it was a great dish.  My bf thought it would be more than 5 stars had I added onion, green pepper, and mushrooms.

I added the extra egg and cheese and substituted turkey sausage.  I just didn't like it at all.  My two year old, who eats just about anything, wouldn't touch it and my husband asked me not to make it again.

This was pretty good.  I can tell a good recipes if my husband and two picky kids eat everything on their plate, and this was cleaned.  I would have used a few less tator tots, because the potatoes overwhelmed the dish.  I also used 4 eggs, and should have used 3 cups of cheese instead of two.  Thank you!

This recipe was so easy and quick to put together.  I did change the number of eggs to 3 and reduced the milk to 1 1/2 cups.  I baked for 35 min took it out and sprinkled a little cheese on top and put it back in the oven for 10min.  I have one child that does not like eggs but the way the casserole turned out he never knew they were in there.

Made this Christmas morning and it was great! It was also very easy! I did add one more egg than the recipe calls for. This recipe is great because you can pretty much just eyeball it and throw in whatever you want...green peppers, mushrooms etc...

Sadly I did not read the other reviews before I made this.  I used 2 eggs, as it calls for, and it definately needs 4!  I still thought it was good so I''m giving it 4 stars, but my husband said it was too soupy.  I'll try it again with 4 eggs and I'm sure that will help.

This recipe is super easy and a great change of pace.  Even my youngest, who is the pickiest eater I've ever met, loves it.  The only changes I made were 4 eggs instead of 2 and I added a few slices of crumbled bacon.  Tastes great!

Very good casserole!  I put 4 eggs in rather than 2 and at least 1/2 cup more cheese.  It also took 65 minutes to cook and my oven is usually spot on with time.

ThIs was delicious and so flippin easy! I made it  New Year’s morning (along with a French toast casserole) for a group of teenage boys and it was gone in about 2.4 seconds. They both went, but this was the one that went down first. The one thing I like to do is keep recipes as fresh as possible, so instead of buying a bag of shredded cheddar, I like to shred my own and it makes the world of difference...I just don’t care for the “sawdust” texture of bagged cheese. 

I wish I could tell you what leftovers were like, but there were none. 

This would be a GREAT recipe for a brunch or potluck.

This was very good.  As other reviewers posted I upped the eggs to 4.  I also added onions and mushrooms.  It would've been very good even if I hadn't added them.  I was going to make this for breakfast but that didn't work out so I made it for dinner.  It was fairly quick to make and easy.  Thanks for posting Nelda!  Will make this again for sure.

This is a good basic recipe.  Have fun with experimenting! The second time I made this, I adjusted the eggs to 5, and added an extra cup cheese.  I also chose a milder sausage, but added broccoli and mushrooms to the meal.  I had no onions but experimented with a small amounts of onion powder, salt and garlic. Not bad!

I read a lot of the comments before making this. 
These are changes I made:
1. 4 eggs instead of 2. 
2. Added a little dry mustard, and salt and pepper to the eggs.
3. I cooked the tator tots for 25 minutes before putting them in the casserole.
4. I put 2 cups of cheese in the casserole, and cooked it for 45 minutes. I then added more cheese on top, and cooked it for another 15 minutes.

My family loved it, and I will be making this again.

Made with 2 extra eggs but no extra cheese. Added caramelized onion and red pepper, and would definitely do that again, maybe even reducing the amount of cheese. This seems like it would lend itself to a lot of variations ... spinach, bacon, and pepper jack might be good!

Made this today for a Christmas Brunch.  Fabulous.  Took others advice. Used 5 eggs, 3 cups cheddar cheese, Jimmy Dean Sage Sausage, and 1/2 lb thick sliced chopped bacon. Par cooked the tater tots as oven was pre-heating and seasoned them with onion powder, paprika, garlic powder, salt and pepper.  Super simple and delicious. What is not to love

I followed other reviewers and added extra eggs and cheese so this review may not be fair to the original.   It was not bad but not very good either.  My grandkids wouldn’t eat it.

Very easy, very versatile recipe that can be modified easily to one's own tastes. Did as many reviewers suggested and used more eggs and less milk, added sautéed onion and green pepper and more seasonings ! An excellent potluck or brunch recipe !

I used Johnsonville Mild Italian sausage. I followed what everyone else said and used 4 eggs also 1 1/2 cup of milk, crispy crowns instead of the tater tots. I increased the temp throughout cooking it to help cook the egg/milk mixture. Turned out wonderful. Taste was perfect, and my husband loved it. Will cook again.

My husband loved it!  I am just not a sausage fan. Someone wrote about using turkey sausage or bacon.  I might try one of these substitutes or double down on the eggs and cheese and make it without meat?

A guilty pleasure, to be sure. I made a half batch since I had that quantity on hand. I agree with other reviews in that 4 eggs work better than 2. I also added salt, pepper, and a shake of onion powder. Should I make again, will add veggies to it to make it less heavy, less filling. Thanks!

I've made this so many times, is great to serve for brunch or bring for a potluck. Like other reviewers, I use 3 eggs instead of 2. I also use spicy sausage (or add some red pepper) and use a shredded cheese blend with spice, e.g. cheddar & pepper jack. (Mild sausage and regular cheddar cheese seemed bland to my family).

Love the simplicity of the recipe.  I followed others suggestions. 
Popped the tots in a 375 oven first for about 15 minutes.  I used 4 eggs and added S&P to season them.  I used 3 cups of cheese. I baked for 45 minutes in a 375 oven, then topped with more cheese, baked 5 minutes, then broiled for a few minutes for an extra crunch.  Soooo good!

Too much milk! I increased the egg count to 4 as others suggested because I was worried it would be too soupy and it was still too soupy. When served, a puddle of oily milk pools in the plate and the consistency is that of mush. My husband wouldn't eat it and the whole thing went in the trash.

Fabulous! I was concerned about it being bland with no spices, but with a flavorful sausage and sharp cheddar cheese, it was great. Very quick and easy dinner on a busy night. I may try adding broccoli for a one-dish meal.

My family loved this-even the picky ones.  After reading some reviews, I made only two changes per their suggestions. I increased the eggs to four.  Also, i used crispy crowns, baking them for about 7 minutes before adding them to the casserole.  It was delicious and easy.

This was a great casserole for my big crowd Christmas morning.  I added an extra egg.  I prepared it the day before and refrigerated it with a package of frozen tots ( they defrosted in the fridge overnight) on top and just popped it in the oven as soon as everyone was up.

After reading the reviews I increased the eggs to 6. Used  2 lbs of sage sausage, and a little more cheese. We ate it with salsa that we heated up to avoid cooling off the casserole. It's a keeper!

This is an excellent make ahead recipe - just refrigerate and add the tots right before putting in the oven.  I cut the recipe in half and it was perfect for 4 hungry people.  The only thing I did differently was to add extra eggs as suggested by others, and saute onions & green peppers.  You can make your own by adding whatever spices or veggies you wish.  It's a definite "keeper".

I made the changes suggested by others, a couple more eggs, a little extra chees, crispy tater tots cooked for 10-12 min before putting them in the casserole. My husband and his friends think it is the best thing ever!

Made 1/2 the recipe in an 8x8 pan.  Used chorizo sausage, 2 eggs and 2 cups of combined mozzarella & cheddar cheeses.  Very good with a mild spice.

This casserole was easy enough that my 9 year old made it all on his own (with me close by).  He and his siblings loved it and told me to rate it with 5 stars. I'm rating it with 4 because it seems like it is missing something... green onions? broccoli? bell peppers? It is definitely a side dish to go with something lighter.
We used 4 eggs, which seemed just right. We may use less tater tots next time.

Made this for my residents at the group home and they loved it! Forget the hash browns that can get soggy - the tater tots are very crisp and adds great crunch! It is a very filling recipe. You can also add whatever you like to it as well (ie:bacon,peppers,) Definitely will make again!!!!

We like this much better than the breakfast casseroles that have bread in them.  Five stars with a couple of fine tuning alterations.  Used only 1 lb. bag of tater tots.  Season lightly with salt and pepper, then cook tater tots in oven while putting everything else together.  (Keeps the potatoes from getting soggy after putting on top of egg mixture.)   I used six eggs instead of two and it still turned out yummy.  1;0 minutes before being done, I sprinkled more cheere on top.Just to experiment, think I'll try muffin tins next time to make individual servings.

This is YUMMY & very easy.  I made exactly as is.  Only adding a three blend frozen pepper and onion mixture to the sausage while browning.  You can easily adapt this recipe to fit your own taste and likes.  A keepers.

I made this casserole for dinner tonight. I did make a few changes. I used 4 eggs instead of 2 per other reviews. I like mine cheesy, so I used lots of cheese. I didn't have enough tater tots, so I used frozen hashbrowns instead. I cooked as directed, except I added the hash browns right from the freezer. It turned out perfect! This is definitely a keeper!

The only good thing I can say about this recipe is that it was easy. No seasonings beyond what was in the sausage, and it was serious soggy tater tot overload! I don't think even adjusting it with more eggs and cheese like others have done would make it worth trying again.

Very good! I added chopped onions and peppers for some texture and threw a couple of spices in there. I also added four eggs and more cheese, like other reviewers suggested. I'll definitely make this again.

This is a favorite recipe at our house. It's  a great base recipe that you can be creative with and add your own flair to. I mostly follow the directions, but add a small amount of onion to the sausage while cooking it. I also use four eggs instead of two and cut down the milk to 1 1/2 cups. I add pepper and a few dashes of garlic salt and seasoning salt to the egg mixture. I like to use the onion flavored tater tots and cook them for about 12-15 min. prior to adding to the dish as other reviews have stated. This prevents them from getting mushy. I add some shredded cheese on top the last 10 min of baking. I upped the baking temp to 375° for 35-45 min. Let it set for about 7-10 prior to serving.  Easy to make and goes a long way for a large breakfast crowd.

Made these changes:

4 eggs and 2 cups of milk
2 1/2 cups of cheese
baked tots for 10 mins to crisp before putting on casserole
raised oven temp to 375 when baking casserole

Made 2 and every single bite was gone. Huge hit.

I have made this recipe several times now. I found this recipe because my 8-year old had something similar at school cafeteria and loved it. This is a big hit with my family (I have 4 boys). The last time I made it I was out of milk and had no time to go to the store. I improvised and added 3 eggs, a cup of sour cream, and a cup of water. It was really cheesy and good. I got no complaints from the 5 men in my house.

I added onion when I made this, because I felt it needed something more when I read the recipe.  However, when it was finished, it was just ok.  Nothing really wowed us and thus only half of the pan got eaten and the rest thrown out.

This was Great!!!! Made a few changes after reading the comments. I only used 1.5 cups of milk and I  4 eggs. I also added onion to the pan when cooking the sausage. I put the sausage/onion in the casserole dish then put half the cheese. I put the other half on top of the tater tots ! Perfect. This may also be good with bell peppers! Might add that next time

The recipe as is was not a keeper.  However, after reading the reviews where people suggested 2 more eggs and cooking the tots beforehand will definitely work.  I cooked this today and had to cook it for an additional 15 minutes.  It's frustrating that recipes are rated so high with alterations to the recipe.This recipe needs more egg definitely.  I cooked the casserole for one full hour on the top rack.  That helped cook the tots a little, but next time I will brown them in the oven first.  Also, it definitely needs more flavor with onion, garlic, and maybe green chile too.

Wow! Very, very yummy! Made it last night following the suggestions of other reviewers, although I'm sure it would have been fine as written. I used 4 eggs, extra cheese and baked the tater tots while I was cooking the sausage, before adding them to the casserole. One of my kids said (happily), "No onions or anything?" I realized he was right. The recipe called for no seasoning and I wondered if I would regret not adding anything, but I didn't. It was so full of flavor. I have 9 kids. Every person in my house loved this recipe. I'd call that a keeper!

This is always a big hit. I'm always asked to make this for any family function. The husband can't get enough. I usually have to make two one for him. Lol. The only thing I changed is I use a 1/12 cups of milk, pancake syrup and 3 eggs. Takes a little longer to cook but has great consistency. Salt pepper and garlic to taste!

Made it this morning for Christmas breakfast. I added extra eggs like suggested. Like someone else said, it's oddly addictive :) Maybe I'll add peppers and onions next time.

Just made this today, wonderful taste and texture.
I did bake the tater tots for 12 minutes prior. Used the 4 eggs and baked at 375 for 45 minutes. Only extra thing I added was pepper. My other half suggested one thing - mushrooms so maybe next time I will toss some in. An easy and tasty meal. Will make again!

I added some chopped onion to the sausage while it was browning, and used less cheese. Not bad.

Super yummy! Took advice of others and used 4 eggs...took almost an hour at 375 degrees, though! Also added onion to the sausage.

Very good recipe.  I used 6 eggs and 3 cups of milk to give it more volume.  Also used frozen hash browns instead of tater tots.  I thought it needed salt so next time will add some to egg mixture.

Overall it was good, there was too much milk so next time I will add two more eggs as some others suggested.  Also I may add some onion and pepper to the egg/milk mixture for a little more flavor.

YUM!  I made this for New Year's breakfast this morning & it was well recieved.  I did add in 3 extra eggs, a pinch of chili powder, some black pepper and and extra cup of mozzarella cheese.  Per other users suggestions, I baked this for an hour at 375 and it came out with the perfect crunchy top consistency that I was hoping for.  Next time I might add in some mushrooms or some other type of veggie, just for some added texture and flavor but it is very good as written too.  Thank you for sharing!  :)

Tasty dish. I made one with sausage and one without out and both were a little greasy. That might have been due to the tater tots so I may try this recipe again with fresh shredded potatoes. We had some left overs and it was even better the next day!

Rave reviews for this at my house.  I used regular sausage, then just mixrd up a bunch of eggs with a little cream and layered it over the cheese until it was even.  I used the disc shaped tots and cooked them about 10 minutes before adding them.

So yummy! I, like others, also prebake the tater tots a bit and use 4 eggs instead of 2. Everything else the same. Our family enjoys it. I bring this for MOPS (Mothers of Preschoolers) meetings too, and it's a hit every time. Thank you! P.S. Next time I'm going to add a salsa layer before the eggs.

Everyone loves this recipe.  It is so yummy. I do prefer a more "breakfast Casserole" type Casserole so I increased the eggs to 6.  But everything else is the same and it is great.

I have used some different flavored sausages (chicken and garlic or chicken and sundried tomato) and the extra flavor gives the dish an extra boost.  I have also cooked up onions or put green onions in with the sausage.

we use two pounds of sausage and add in a green pepper and onion. Makes the dish that much better :) we also tried italian sausage for a spicy flavor. You could also add in ham or bacon.

I took this to a women's meeting at church and it completely disappeared.  I did as others suggested and cooked the tots for a few minutes before I put them over the egg mixture which was no big deal.  I just let them brown in the oven while I was making all the other ingredients.  Kids can't wait till Christmas morning as they have reqeusted this one for then.

excellent quick breakfast for large groups of picky eaters!  I also doubled the eggs and I only used 1.5 cups of milk and it was delish!  Great Christmas morning since you can make it the night before.

YUM!! I was skeptical on whether to use pork sausage, as I am not really a fan. However, I am glad I decided to stick to the recipe. As others have recommended, I used four eggs. When layering in the casserole dish I put the sausage, then the eggs, and sprinkled a cup of shredded cheese on it. I baked the tater tots for 10 minutes prior to adding them to the dish but next time I will probably bake them for 15. Finally, I used seven slices of Velveta cheese to top it off. I baked it for 45 minutes and it turned out perfect.

This a a great recipe. I used ground turkey which brought the protein up and followed other advice about chopped veggies and eggs. My family loved it and I will continue using this recipe. My search for the recipe is done. Thank You!

I LOVE this recipe and so does my picky family.  I use 3 eggs instead of two.  I am a teacher and often take it to work on "treat" days, and the teachers clean it out...they love it too!  When my son comes home from college I make it the night before so he has it for his first day home.

Not bad. I followed the directions but soon relized i should have followed the the suggestions... adding 4 eggs total and another cup of cheese on the top. While browning the sausage I added some chopped white onion, red and green peppers. My hubby gobbled it up with no problem, I added salt and pepper to taste.

Like others, I precooked the tater tots, which turned out good.  Instead of adding an extra egg, I added a bit of mayo and added broccoli (we ate it for dinner).  It was delicious!

Very good!!!  Used 4 eggs like others have suggested and 2 1/2 cups cheese. Another great recipe from this site is the Breakfast Pie recipe.

This was a good way to use up leftover sausage links.  The first time I made it I used four eggs like most reviewers suggested, and it was good.  Good enough for my husband to request it again! The second time I only had two eggs in the house so I made it according to the original recipe and I liked it better that way.  The potatoes and sausage stood out more.  Both times I added diced bell pepper and onion to the sausage, and once I threw in leftover onion dip with the egg/milk mixture and that was really tasty.

It was very good, especially as leftovers.  It needed something though.  We think it needs diced and sauted onions, green peppers and mushrooms.

Never tried this before but wanted to contribute to the breakfast portion of our annual family reunion.  People loved it!  So much so, that it was gone when I went to get some.  The only change I made was I used spicy sausage.

Thought this was great! I didn't have tater tots, so I used shredded hash browns instead. Also, in the egg mixture I added salt, pepper, and minced onions. I had some fresh mushrooms, so I added to the layer between cheese and hash browns. Put more salt and pepper on top, and cheese. Will make again! Great for breakfast and dinner too!

This recipe is okay. I accidentely bought maple breakfast sausage, and that really overpowered the entire dish, so make sure you are getting plain ole' sausage. I followed other suggestions and added extra cheese, and I don't think I would do that next time. I also think I will make this will bacon instead of breakfast sausage next time, and on a smaller scale.

This was popular with my co-workers. But I think two cups of milk is a little much, it made it somewhat watery.

I wish I could give this recipe more than 5 stars!! Was the best! I made it for a meeting at work and it was a huge hit, so I made it for our family's Christmas morning breakfast and it was another huge sucess, everyone wanted the recipe! It is soooo easy to make, and sooo easy to eat! I love it! I used lowfat sausage, and after I put the tater tot's on top I mixed some more eggs and milk together and poured that over the tater tot's and then put some more cheese on top of it all... and it was fantastic!!

This was just okay. After reading the reviews, I was expecting to like it more than I did. I like each of these ingredients individually, but I did not like the taste of them combined. I used half colby-monterey jack cheese and half cheddar cheese, one extra egg, a little less milk, and one extra cup of cheese. I personally thought it could have used more tater tots and less sausage... maybe another layer of tater tots? I probably won't make this again to find out if it would taste better with more tots.

This recipe was great after I got done altering it.  I used 5 eggs, but think it would be just a tad better with 6 eggs.  2 cups of nonfat milk. I also sprinkled cheese on the warm sausage as well as the tater tots. There's nothing like melted cheese on warm tater tots! I cooked it for 40 minutes (prepared all ingredients the same morning).  I let it stand for 10 minutes before serving. Everyone loved it.

YUM!!! I made this for dinner, using 3 eggs as suggested and an extra 10 minutes in the oven. I used hashbrowns since I had them on hand. I thought we'd have leftovers, but we ate the whole dish. My husband thought it was fantastic, I'll definitely make it again.

I love this dish! My mom suggested a bit more, to make it not so much of a 'breakfast' dish, and it worked out very very very well! 
I used ground beef, instead of sausage
Added corn, green beans, peas, and mushrooms, 3 eggs, and more cheese...Boyfriend loves it, I love it, it has become something for a hectic week, or a laid back weekend!

We tried this recipe as list and it was VERY GOOD! The next time we made it we added onions, green pepper and mushrooms. Plus we doubled the eggs and cheese.  This was an EXCELLENT addition to this fine recipe. Next I'd like to try this recipe with cut up sausage links or little smokies!

This was very delicious. My family just loved it. I changed it alittle by adding 3 eggs instead of 2 and add cheese on top of the tater tots. Also added a can of mushrooms in the middle. Next time I might add onions too. Great dish not only for breakfast but for dinner too.

Our family loves this. We even had a special birthday Tater Tot casserole with candles stuck in foil covering the dish.  BTW, stick with just sausage - we tried it with bacon at the request of the bacon lover in our household...  even he agreed that it's better with plain sausage, as directed.

I made this last night for a quick dinner.  It was delicious.  I did add an extra egg...ended up turning the oven up to 375 deg and cooked an additional 15 mminutes.  Added extra cheddar last 5 min.  We let it set about 10 minutes before cutting.

My husband and I really enjoyed this.  It was very filling and all the flavors worked well together.  I added some (cooked) bacon in addition to the sausage, and topped it with some additional cheddar.  I think it could use some more egg, as we couldn't taste much.  A green onion would have been a nice addition too, but that's the beauty of a recipe like this...you can add on to it!  Overall, a definite keeper!

Good but I changed original recipe after reading other reviews. I set oven at 375, used 4 c. cheese, 5 eggs, and still had to bake it 10 minutes longer.

Easy, hearty and likely to please everyone in your household.  I used 3 eggs...next time I will try 4 to make it thicker.  Thanks for a great breakfast alternative!
