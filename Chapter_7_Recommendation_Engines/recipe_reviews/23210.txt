Besides looking cute, these muffin tops were delicious.  My mom said they were good, and believe me, that says a lot!!!  Very simple, very easy.

This is not a real recipe, it is a pre-packaged, boxed cake mix that you buy at the grocery store.

This should have just been directions on making muffin tops, for ANY kind of muffins, as this was a packaged mix dropped on a cookie sheet.  Rather silly, I could have gotten it right off the box.

These muffins are excellent! They tast great and they are super easy! I like to cut them in half and spread lots of butter with a tall glass of orange juice. Enjoy!!
