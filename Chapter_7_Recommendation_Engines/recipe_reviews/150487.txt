This was a very good dessert.  I made this two times.  The first time I used cool whip in place of the whipping cream and the second time I used actual whipping cream.  They both turned out excellent.  The cool whip version came out a little bit sweeter.  So if you don't have a Kitchen Aid to whip the whipping cream, I would use cool whip.  Thanks for the recipe, I will be making this every CHRISTmas, kids love it.

A little goes a long way.  VERY sweet.  I crushed the candy canes very small based on a previous review and actually thought chunks would have given it more of a peppermint taste.  I took it to a Christmas luncheon and was very disappointed.  1/2 of the people didn't finish it.

a hit at a christmas party with both adults and kids. Bring the recipe you'll be asked for it. Make sure the candy canes are crushed fine, chunky was not as nice to eat as the finely crushed candy was. Would probably taste good with a little chopped chocolate too. I will be making this one every year for sure.
