The sauce was too thin, and the beef is bland. Great recipe for people who don't like spices.

This was very good.
The next time I will be using half the amounts for the tzatziki, I had enough for 10 people. :-)

My hubby and I loved this! I think I put too much lemon juice in the tzatziki for my hubby's taste so he used some Trader Joe's goddess dressing instead. I added Salt and Pepper to the meat. Also, I added some sesame seeds and a dab of prepared horseradish on my gyro. For the kids sake, I put the onions, cucumbers, and tomatoes as a salad on the side with oil & vinegar.

This was great. I made a few changes. I used a naan like break, so it was fluffier then the pita bread. 

I also, based on other reviews hand chopped the cucumber vs blending it to avoid the tzatziki from  having too much liquid.

People who are having trouble with it being watery. Try running the cucumbers through a food processor, blender, or grate really fine on a cheese grader first then put on a terry cloth or a lot of paper towles and ring out the extra mosture form the cucumbers. This will help remove the extra liquid and make the tzatziki thicker.

Made it the fist time as written, yep it was way to thin. It took a little thought, but to thicken it:
1) shred the cucumber
2) wrap in paper towels and squeeze the moisture out
3) MIX BY HAND DON'T USE THE BLENDER.
Now you have a great tzatziki ;)

Loved this. Super easy and quick.  I cheated and bought the tzaki sauce pre made and used pita pockets instead of rounds. id recommend no bigger than 1/2 in strips of the sirloin as well. Great recipe!

Didn't use the blender, cut out the seeds, and marinated the meat. Great meal.

I will definitely be making this again but I will season the meat a bit before cooking. It was a bit bland. Otherwise my mom and dad loved it as well as my very picky kids! I had macaroni and cheese on standby just in case. Haha!

This recipe was really good! Instead of regular yogurt I used Greek yogurt to help thicken the sauce and seasoned the meat before hand . My husband and mom really enjoyed it would definitely do this again.

The flavors in this recipe were great, but my tzatziki sauce was very watery!  I ended up doubling the amount of yogurt and that helped, but it was still quite thin.  I will definitely make this again, but I will have to do some tweaking of measurements to fix the sauce.

This was delicious! I used some bison skirt steak that I had on hand in place of the beef. Also, I had to omit the lettuce b/c I was out of it. LOVED the addition of the feta! What a great take on a gyro...a keeper, for sure~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)
