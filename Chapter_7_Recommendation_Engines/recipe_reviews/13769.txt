This recipe is tasteless. Forget the flour and the fat. Brown the meat with one medium chopped onion and then drain the fat off. Stir one can of beef broth into 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup in a large bowl. Add this mixture to the meat and heat thoroughly. Bingo! You've got some great tasting gravy.

Not a bad recipe.  Easy to make...easy to spice up.  I really like the idea of mixing the flour with the hamburger first.  I added the onion soup mix, the worchester (?) sauce, some garlic, and no-salt extra seasonings.  The recipe by itself may be a little bland as one of the reviews stated but cooking, I believe, is the art of creation.  Out of chaos can come beauty!!!

I cooked the beef with 3 cloves garlic and about 1 1/2 cup chopped onion.  I also added 2 beef boullion cubes with the milk to give this more flavor.  We served it over mashed potatoes.   A great cook ahead dish to eat on a busy night.

Oh my gawd .... did everyone grow up with this meal in rotation?  I like it over mashed potatoes with steamed veggies on the side.  If you're looking for robust flavor, this isn't it - just quick comfort food on a cold night.

This was really good - I added some onion soup mix and some Worchestershire sauce for extra zip and it was a hit at our house.

Winner!  Everyone loved it.  Very tasty over egg noodles.  I only used 3 cups of milk and although I overlooked the onion, I did add a package of onion soup mix.  Kids and adults couldn't wait to tell me that this was GOOD.

My husband loves this!  He asked me to make hamburger gravy for him, and I found this recipe.  He was so happy because it tasted just like his mothers.  I won some brownie points. :)

This reminds me of my Daddy's homemade hamburger gravy.. we'd have this a lot during the Winter months.  The only thing I'd add to this is a couple pinches of ground sage, 1/2 tsp of chicken or beef bouillion and 2 tsp butter or margarine.

Yum... we added a few things too... but the basic recipe was a great place to start.  I've been making sausage gravy for biscuits for years, but had never even thought about using ground beef and serving it over egg noodles.  Kids loved it too!  We added beef/onion soup mix and garlic salt.

Consider this a base recipe...strangely addicting and ultimately comfort food lol. Very inexpensive to make (7$) and makes a full skillet to boot (I used just one pound of hamburger and had a full skillet of beef gravy). I put some over a leftover biscuit but it would be great on mashed potatoes as well. Like others, I amended the recipe a bit. I added more onion, a few slices of leek, 2 Tbs Worcestershire, 2 Tbs A1 Bold/Spicy sauce, and 2 Tbs of chopped garlic. If I could have gotten the darn jalapeno jar open, I would have plopped some of those in there too :)

I had my doubts about taste after reading other reviews, but tried this anyway.  My family loved it!  I did add 1 package of dried beefy onion soup to the mix and used seasoned salt.  The result had pretty good flavor, and everyone had seconds.

Quick!  Easy!  Yummy!  Thanks for the recipe!  This is one of my husband's childhood favorites and he said it tasted great.  We served it over white rice.  We will be adding this to our regular recipe ideas.  Thanks again!

This is good old fashioned comfort food, from back before everything had to be spiced and seasoned to death! My father-in-law used to make this for my husband when he was a boy, and although he passed before I met him, I managed to duplicate my husbands favorite breakfast. I like the idea of adding some garlic, and maybe a dash of crushed red pepper. This is a excellent recipe to start, and then tweak to your familys preference. About the only thing I do different is I used dehydrated onion flakes and I add them to the beef as it's browning, that's just my husbands preference, for I can't seem to dice a fresh onion fine enough...:)

This was very good (and so easy too), just like mom's and that's what I was searching for!  I do admit slightly on the bland side at first, but that's why the recipe says salt and pepper to taste.  I fried the hamburger with minced dried onion, 2 cloves garlic and seasoning salt.  I'll be using this recipe from now on, thanks.

Great Gavy!  I did add a whole packet of Onion soup mix for flavor, and had to add a little more flour to thicken it up enough.  I had it over egg noodles, my husband over baked potato, and our son really loved the leftovers mixed with macaroni and cheese!  Overall, a easy, satisfying recipie that can be used in numerous ways. THANKS!  :)

Major nostalgia with this one -- felt like I was back in the school cafeteria! Now, before you think that is a slam, the cooks in the small town in which I grew up were quite good. Not sure it's "show-off-for-company" fare or anything, but certainly respectable, to say nothing of quick and easy. Followed the suggestions of a couple of other reviewers and added a packet of onion soup mix and some Worcestershire (actually, I guess I "halved" the "called for" ingredients, and used a full packet of the soup mix). Went a little easy on the milk and it thickened up nicely. Next time, I might add some sour cream, at "The Hubbs'" request, to give it a "faux stroganoff" feel. Served over rice with a salad. Very satisfying meal. Thanks!

Growing up, my family had this very often.  Our house (and all others I knew of back then) served it over toast and everyone called it "S.O.S"  Does everyone remember what that stands for? HA! Down home comfort food that brings back many, many memories...even if it does have a nicer name in this day & time! HA!

Very good recipe.  I served this over mashed potatoes. Browned the meat with onions and added about 1 tsp. of beef soup base. This is what I call comfort food. Thanks for sharing this great simple recipe.

My mom taught me how to make this yeaars ago! But I like the way you added the flour dry to the hamburger it cooked in better this way. My mom use to mix the flour and cold milk and then pour it over the hamburger it was lumpy that way! My mom also added a little sugar to make it have a sweet taste, yum!

Made this for dinner 2night and the kids & I LOVED it, even my finicky 3 & 1/2 year old found no fault with it and my 18 month old son gobbled it up as did his father when he got home. Not one speck was left! 

Now I did tweek slightly, I cooked 1 Lb gr beef with 1 onion diced (though this was not mentioned in the directions I am sure that was what was intended since it is listed in the ingredients) and 3 cloves garlic crushed. I added lots of  fresh ground pepper and kosher salt & slightly more flour and more milk in hopes this would be left overs for lunch, LOL- until my husband ate it ALL!!

Makes a nice gravy - but agree with some previous reviews - needs some spice. I cooked onion and a little garlic with the ground beef and it still could have used more flavour. Worcestershire sauce or something like that perhaps? Still the gravy was a good consistency and very easy recipe and fast.

This classic just needed a little help. I added a little minced garlic and beef bouillon to the ground beef. Replaced about 1/3 of the milk with 1/3 cup heavy cream. Turned out Great. No leftovers!

This is a great recipe and I think people need to remember that hamburger gravy is a very basic dish with basic flavor and very versatile!  it is not ment to pop with lots of flavor just good ol' home cooking adding some salt and pepper to this recipe will make a great difference ! YUMMY

My husband and I liked this recipe.  I thought my two little boys would like it but neither of them cared for it. I served it over mashed potatoes.  Next time, I might try it over wide egg noodles.  It was really simple to make the gravy.

This was alright and certainly is filling. I cut this in half for 1 lb. of beef, and used some dried minced onion (about 2 T) in from the start. I didn't have any onion salt. I dumped all the milk in at once after the flour had time to cook a few minutes. This was too meaty for me and I wanted much more of the gravy part. This was simple and a good comfort food though. Not my favorite recipe but it filled us up. Thanks I enjoyed trying out your recipe.

I love hamburger gravy, but it is hard to make it have taste.  You need to add salt and lots of it!  Onions are a must for me, you can even add brown gravy for more flavor.  Ive served mine over mashed potatoes but, Ive used white rice too.  Delicious!

This is total comfort food served over egg noodles with some brocolli! So good! I've made this one several times, and even used ground turkey, and still Delish!

I added Extra Spicy Mrs. Dash and lots n lots of pepper, and my family gobbled it up like crazy over mashed potatoes! My husband and I ate the leftovers over toast for lunch today. Thanks for a great base recipe that even those of us who can mess up Hamburger Helper can handle! :)

This recipe is a great start but definitely is a success with the additions of a package of onion soup mix, 3 cloves of garlic and 1tbsp worcestershire sauce.  Yum!

I added the flour in the last two minutes of browning the burger (with a diced up onion) and this worked out very well because the flour got cooked with all the other aromatic flavors, ensuring there wouldn't be a flour-y taste.  Once finished I couldn't help but feel there was a flavor missing, and after adding oregono and garlic, I came upon the celery salt, which was it.  In the future I will either add celery in with diced onion while browning up the meat or add celery salt with the flour.  I used a few good sized dashes. (plus I've halved the recipe as it's just me and my Marco) With the celery and perhaps even some cilantro I would give this recipe 5 stars.

I tried this because I was looking for a rather inexpensive, fast meal to make.  That's what this was...just OK.  Rather tasteless, but filling.  If I make this again, I will have to season it up quite a bit more.

I liked this recipe, but I doctored it a bit.  I fried up the ground beef in a bit of the bacon grease I had left over from the morning's breakfast.  I also finely chopped an onion, and threw that in along with about half a pound of sliced mushrooms.  I drained the meat before I added the flour and seasoned it with a Montreal Steak seasoning blend that we had in the cupboard, along with a little salt.  I served it over a rice that had been cooked in a beef broth, so it was pretty savory.  I would make it again.

This was an okay recipe.  Not something that I will make again. I did change somethings (added Worcestershire, onion soup mix, cut up onions cooked with the ground beef) suggested by other reviewers.  It filled us up but had no WOW, like a plain bologna sandwich!

As many others have stated, this needs some seasoning!  I sauteed onions and garlic in some butter with salt and pepper, I added some white wine (Have to share while I'm cooking dinner!).  I then added an onion soup mix to the burg.  At the end I added some of Tupperware garlic herb seasoning that I had.  HOLY COW! Husband gives it a 8.5 out of 10 (Porterhouse being a 10)

I like the consistency but only used 3 1/2 cups of milk and I added kitchen Bouquet gravy additive to it to darken and add flavor + added a dash of garlic salt and 1/2 cube beef boulion. I served over mash tates with green beans and homemade biscuits. Yummy my family ate every bite ...the poor dog only got to lick the pan. It will be in my rotation for late fall -winter warmers. reminded me of my shepards pie but much easier. Thanks Steven for sharing.

I really liked this alot! It was the closest recipe to my mothers that I have made.  I have literally threw out the other recipes I have tried!  I served this over mashed potatoes and my whole family loved it! I did add alot of salt/pepper and "Cookies" seasoning to take some of the blandness away.  Great comfort food and easy on the stomach!

My husband is one of the pickiest eaters I know but he had always loved hamburger gravy when we had it at his sisters house.  Been married 26 yrs. and never made it until today.  Didn't have a recipe so I tried this one. The only thing I did different was to add a pkg. of dry onion soup mix when browning the hamburger.  My husband and daughter loved it!  Would have given it 5 stars but reduced it to 4 given the fact that I added the onion soup mix.

added the onion soup mix and worcestershire sauce that others suggested and did some of my own seasoning...great taste, but way too runny.  Will try again using less milk.

I am NOT a GRAVY maker...it never turns out right. This recipe made PERFECT gravy the first time shocking everyone and making me king of the kitchen!!! Thanks for a great easy recipe. I had a sick one that wanted comfort food and so I took part of it out and made it pretty much according to recipe...for the remainder of the family, I did add a dash of garlic powder, a bullion cube and some extra pepper that made it a total smash! I will make and use this recipe again and keep it on the top of my recipe box!

I've never needed a recipe for this, but curiosity made me look.  I noticed that people mention it needs more flavour, but spices are always a variable.  I wonder how bad beef has gotten if it has no flavour anymore... . Well one thing I do different is to put a teaspoon or two of soya sauce, this darkens the colour and makes the gravy smooth as silk.

Suffering from withdrawal on my low-carb diet and craving starchy food, I came across this recipe. I modified is so I wasn't cheating so much that I was riddled with guilt.  I used only 1 tbsp. of flour, which worked well with the two cups of half and half (slightly less carbs than milk), omitted the onion and used about 1 tsp. of onion powder, 1/4 tsp. garlic powder and a dash of paprika. Served over steamed cauliflower, I *almost* felt like I was eating Mom's hamburger gravy over potatoes. Thanks Steven!

This was very bland as is, so most people will probably need to season it up quite a bit. It was very quick and easy though and I might use pork or italian sausage next time.

I cut this recipe in 1/2 and then followed it to the letter.  This meal turned out so badly I had to throw it away and go out to dinner.  I don't know what I could have done wrong.  The gravy had no taste.  I tried to doctor it with the onion soup mix - but it offered no help.

Excellent recipe!!  I also added a half package of onion soup mix like others suggested.  It turned out great!  I only had one pound of ground beef to use, so I just decreased the amount of milk and it turned out perfect!  Even my picky kids asked for seconds!  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

My mom used to make this when I was a kid.  Real comfort food & it 
is a budget-friendly meal.  For a little kick, she always added a dash
of curry powder and seasoning salt.  That gives it the extra flavor it needs.

I have been eating this for over 50 years! It's our go-to comfort food. My gravy however, is made with Cream of Mushroom soup, milk, garlic and Gravy Master. And always with a side of peas!

This was one of my husband's favorites that his grandma would make...needless to say, I was nervous to try it, especially since I had never made this kind of gravy before!  But this recipe is so simple and I added a few of my own seasonings (a little sage and garlic powder) and he loved it!  Phew!  I wouldn't have known where to start without this easy recipe!

I fixed this hamburger gravy tonight for the family because I was looking for something quick and easy. I remember my father fixing this and putting it over toast. He has a military background and called it SOS. 
Anyway, this was simple and tasty. I fixed it pretty much as is with just a few changes. I cooked the onions with the hamburger instead of using them as a topping and then I didn't use the onion salt. I used 1/2 tsp. garlic powder because I was out of fresh garlic. Otherwise, I kept everything else the same. Yum, I will fix this again!

This looks like a really good recipe. When we make it at our house we use ready made beef gravy and add frozen mixed veges over potatoes, rice noodles, even toast.

Absolutely love this.  Learned how to make this in my home ec class in junior high school (grade 7, 8 or 9) in the Lehigh Valley area (Allentown) of Pennsylvania and it was called Saucy Hamburger Crumble.  Lost recipe and haven't made it for a long time!  Was absolutely thrilled to find this recipe.  At 58 I now make it for me and my 18-yr old son and he loves it too.  Thank you!

this classic recipe is one i've been using for years and i was surprised to find it on here as well, since i made it from scratch in my head. but it all comes from somewhere. yes, it is bland... but i find it's always best the person making it season to their own personal tastes and likes. add in some peppers, some veggies, whatever you think it needs to suit your own likes.

I stirred in about half a cup of sour cream to the mix to add a little bit of flavor and served it over mashed new potatoes. I am pregnant and too much flavor in any direction makes me nauseous. I liked it but probably won't after baby is born. My husband grew up eating it and thought it was fantastic.  No matter how much salt we added, it still didn't taste all that astounding, but for a total of five ingredients, who is going to complain?

Good recipe grew up on this one. You do have to use fair amount of salt, pepper, or will be bland. Like eating fries with no salt.

I make this often but instead of just salt, pepper and milk I use 1 packet dry Beefy Onion soup mix, a little water and flour to thicken.  Now that's got some taste!

This gravy turned out good. I submitted a photo of it. Not much flavor though. Maybe use some of the suggestions, like anding mushroom soup mix or something. We ate until there was no leftovers, thanks.

This was just what I remembered as a child. I personally like it dressed up a bit, so couldn't give it any more than four stars.  However, it was a great base to start with.  I added onions, worcestershire (sp), garlic, and beef bullion.  Served it over some leftover rice, with steamed veggies on the side, along with the Flakey Whole Wheat Biscuits, also from this site.  Yum!  And it's not only cheap, but it's also a fast and easy recipe, with quick clean up afterwards.

Without mad seasoning on my part, this would be a 2 or maybe 3 star recipe.  Even if you season the meat while cooking as I did, you'll still need to add about 1 tsp salt and a 1/4 tsp pepper to the final product - cook a bit longer for the flavors to meld, a dash of garlic and it's golden.  This is a good base recipe, but "salt and pepper to taste" as called for in the recipe is just not accurate, unless it's a cook watching sodium intake or just doesn't care for an average amount of flavor in their dishes.

I just got done making this for my boyfriend. I don't think it is bland at all you just have to know how to spice things up. Here is what I did.

Before you brown the meat add garlic powder and onion powder. Then After it browns add a lil bit more. Then add your actual chopped onions. When the milk thickens and your gravy forms add the salt and pepper and onion salt. This was a amazing dish thank you so much for this recipe.

Tonight was the first time I made hamburger gravy...didn't follow the recipe to the "t", but it gave me the start that I needed. I added seasoning salt, pepper, garlic salt, minced onion, and reg salt.  Came out great!  My boyfriend and myself were quite pleased....Thanks!

This was a good basic recipe to start with.  But drain the grease!!!!  I found it much better to drain the grease, set aside the hamburger and form a roux in the pan with butter and flour, then pour in the milk and create the gravy only then adding the hamburger and letting it simmer until desired consistancy.

I halved the recipe but used a whole chopped onion, fried with the ground beef.  I also added some beef base for flavor and color.  Still, a good base recipe.

I totally loved this recipe. I did change it up a little bit, I added some fresh garlic and onion, cooked it the same time as the meat. I also added a big heaping of diced chilies (from a can), as this household loves spice, some chopped red peppers and some dill (dried).  Ohhh ....SO GOOOD!!!  I served it over mashed potatoes.  Wonderful, I will defenitly be making this recipe again. It is one of those comfort foods, great for a rainy day. :)

I made this recipe for buscuits and gravy... the texture was great, but it had virtually no flavor.  I had people over and no one cared for this gravy because it was so bland.  We tried garlic powder and salt, which did help some, but this recipe needs to kick it up.

This recipe is very good--and flexible.  I added fennel seed and ground sage (maybe 1/2 teaspoon each), as were recommended by other reviewers.  The fennel flavor was prominant, so be sure you enjoy it, as I do, before adding it.  I intended to add a packet of onion soup mix, as was recommended by other reviewers, but forgot.  I will do that next time.  Mom cooked something similar to this recipe when I was a kid, partnering boiled potatoes with it.  For convenience and speed, I used instant mashed potatoes.  I had Hamburger Gravy for dinner last night and breakfast this morning.  Very good.

ADDENDUM:  I just prepared this again on 9/12/19 and wish I had not waited so long (the first time was in 2007). The only change from last time is that I added the packet of onion soup mix that other reviewers have recommended and a small onion to the hamburger mixture. With the fennel and sage, some ground pepper and only a little salt, there was a lot of flavors going on. I love this recipe. Comfort food, baby.

Not as good as Mom used to make (nothing's as good as Mom used to make), but an improvement on the last time I tried, without this recipe! Thanks!  I enjoyed it thoroughly.  With lots and lots of garlic and onion, mmmmm...

My mother always made this with spicy bulk pork breakfast sausage (drain off some of the fat before adding flour).  This should be a good fix for those of you who found the taste too bland.

It was really quick and easy, but very bland. I added Seasoning Salt and a dry Onion Soup Mix packet to give it some kick.
Salt and Pepper doesn't cut it.

Easy, yes, but extremely boring in flavor.   It desperately needed some oomph.  We added ketchup, but even that didn't work.

As is this needs a lot of jazzing up. Try adding two teaspoons of chicken bullion, a small block of tomato bullion or a tablespoon of tomato paste, 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder, a teaspoon or more of Italian seasoning, and a teaspoon or more of dried parsley along with the salt and pepper that's called for. I didn't want a full cream gravy so I used mostly water and probably 1/2 cup of 2% milk. Now it has some flavor. Not bad for a recipe that calls for mostly pantry items.  Also, I used 85% ground beef and took out most of the fat.

The original recipe is a good base. Here are the additions I made and came out very tasty. Approved by a teen, a toddler, and husband:
-One whole onion chopped and cooked with meat (instead of onion powder)
-3 cloves minced garlic (instead of garlic powder) added to meat when it was almost done
-1.5 tsp pepper
-1.5 tsp beef better than boullion 
-0.5 - 1 tsp all purpose seasoning.  

We will be making it again! Good for a night you don't have much time. We did it over garlic mashed potatoes this round, but will try over egg noodles next time.

It was a great recipe to start with but I had to add a few of my own twist.  followed directions after adding milk I added a can of cream of mushroom  soup and  2 T of chicken bullion and a cap full of Worcestershire sauce. It was perfect!!! Thanks

Very easy to make! It was delicious. I used onion soup as one rater suggested and it gave it more flavor. I used to have this same dish when I was in high school it was one of the meals I really enjoyed.

The recipe is easy to make and I love it. My kids love simple meals so this was perfect.  I do have a big family and we love to eat so I used 3lbs of ground beef and for that I used 3cups of milk all together. I for sure will make it again.

My Mom used to make this in the 1960s and also add bell pepper, celery, onions, diced (1/2") potatoes and peas.  She called it "Hamburger Hash"  It fed a family of four very inexpensively.  I haven't made it for years but my hubby and I still love it even after 50 years!  LoL !  It is a very  easy and comforting dish.  PS:  If she didn't have milk on hand, she would just use beef broth or water-- still always good!

Not much different than the recipe I've made for years. I use very lean burger so it doesn't need draining. Then I mix the flour in with the meat in the pan. Then poured in milk until consistency we wanted. Definitely add some of your favorite seasonings. This is just a basic recipe from days gone by. PS: We also called it S.O.S. and normally just served it on buttered toast.

I made mine with ground sirloin and used Carnation Milk. I served it like an open faced sandwich. You make the recipe and lightly brown a roll of your choice. Once roll gets to desired brownness I lay it open on a plate spoon mashed potatoes on it and top it with your beefy gravy. I served buttered sweet corn with it. Everyone loved it, I cook for 8 people most of the time and the 4 kids gobbled it up like hungry wolves. I took 20 minutes to prepare. Love this recipe and the best part is how easy and cheap it makes feeding a hungry crowd.

The primary reason I saved and then used this recipe was that it reminded me of when I was in elementary school. This was my favorite school lunch in the cafeteria. I didn't think this would taste the same but I was wrong. Took me right back to the good old days. The nostalgia!

I served it with mashed potatoes but might try noodles next time.

I've been making this for years. However I drain the fat off of the meat, make gravy, add to it onion, garlic, grated carrot, diced sweet peppers. Served over mashed potatoes.

Add chopped bell pepper, celery and more onions and maybe a jalopeno pepper, minced.  When gravy is just about done, add coarsely chopped green onions.  The more time you can simmer the gravy with the veggies, the better the gravy will taste.  I also use saved bacon grease to saute the veggies.  It really does not add a lot per serving to the cholesterol count and elevates the taste immensely.

This is good if you have hamburger meat defrosted and don't really know what to do with it hahaha this is what I did: brown the meat drained it added onion and red and green bell peppers, then 1/4cup of flour with about 1/2 pint of whipping cream 1/4 cup of milk added Worcestershire sauce (1/2cup) then pepper, creole seasoning, accent' flavoring, liquid beef broth about a cup and let it simmer. Came out amazing!!! I like to season according to mood when I cook hahahaa OH! spoon it over fresh mashed potatoes....mmmmm

This is my second time making this recipe...the first time I followed the recipe as written and it was OK . This time I used ground chuck and was very skeptical that 1/4 cup of flour would soak up the grease but it worked perfectly. I browned my chuck with a small onion chopped up. I read a lot of the reviews and suggestions, and added a couple dashes of worcestershire and two beef bouillon cubes and they made it way too salty. Had to add more milk and pepper to cut the salt taste down but then it wasn't thick enough. Finally I just added a teaspoon of cornstarch mixed in a little more milk and it was perfect. The only other thing I changed this time was adding about a teaspoon of garlic powder. This is an excellent base recipe that can be "doctored up" to suit your taste. I know I will only use 1 beef cube next time...

This was a quick, simple recipe to prepare.  It earns an extra star for being so easy to make.  I used only half a pound of ground beef and substituted  a can of evaporated milk and water for fresh milk.  Served over long grain brown rice it made two substantial servings...delicious.  The leftovers were just as good heated up the next day.

Since the cafeteria in grade school, hamburger gravy on whipped potatoes has been a favorite of mine.  This recipe must have come straight from the hair-netted women behind the counter, and it took me back.   It was easy, there were no lumps, and the leftovers were great several days later.

This is a great base. I added green peppers and different seasonings to make it my own. Otherwise I believe it would turn out very bland. I was able to use Lactaid milk to make this dairy free, which was great!

Super easy and fast to make. I added in a garlic salt instead of onion powder and drizzled some sriracha sauce and it made it 100x better! Put over Grands and a side of strawberries made the perfect breakfast! Will totally be making this again.

I remember Hamburger gravy from my childhood, but I had never made it before. This recipe was easy and quick.  I sautéed onions and garlic in butter and Worchestershire  until onions were opaque. I added 2 lbs lean ground beef and cooked it through. I drained the meat and then added the flour, stirred it up and added a can of beef broth.  Then a pint of fat free half and half and cooked till thickened.  We ate it over mashed potatoes (we were craving comfort food!)  My family liked this and after we each added our desired amount of salt and pepper, we ate it all right down. I gave it 4 stars as I feel it needs tweaking a bit, but very good and filling. Thank you!

I cooked the beef with 3 cloves garlic and about 1 1/2 cup chopped onion. I also added 2 beef boullion cubes with the milk to give this more flavor. We served it over mashed potatoes.

Good, easy recipe. I added some garlic powder and Worcestershire sauce to give it some added flavor. Great on baked potatoes!

Made this with Jimmy Dean's maple sausage which gave it so much flavor! Only had a lb of sausage so only needed 2 cups of milk. My husband loved it more than the package gravy and even my 2 yo, who hates biscuits and gravy, had 2 servings!! I'll never buy the packaged gravy again!

This is the traditional way of making a gravy. You can easy add chicken or beef bouillon to recipe for more flavor like a meat gravy. This is more of a white sauce gravy. This is a good solid recipe.

Basically OK as far as it goes. Not much seasoning. I added much garlic, worcestershire sauce, salt, pepper, mushrooms, cajun spice, and more onion. I don't use any recipe with the soups, too many carbs, and don't do dairy.

Some of the reviews say this is bland. Of course it is unless you spice it up. This is the recipe I grew up with. I like it just with salt and pepper over buttered bread. One of my favorite breakfast foods.

Tasted like  flour paste. Even with the seasoned burger with onions and mushrooms. Read through the reviews and decided to add a packet of onion soup mix. One packet worked well with a half recipe. I added more salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder, and it was edible. Ok at best. Back to cream of mushroom soup and bit of sour cream.

My husbands grandmother cooked this when he was young but a very fatty version. I leaned it up with very lean ground beef. First I sautee, onion, crushed garlic in a small amount of grape seed oil, then i add the meat and season. My favorite to season this is McCormicks steak seasoning, once browned, add whole wheat flour to skim milk, add to the meat then we have found that is very good over brown rice instead of potatoes.

Great recipe!  Reminded me of my Mother's hamburger gravy.  A real comfort food.  My husband loved it.  I added a bit more onion salt, salt, and pepper than called for.  And I didn't add the onions.  The recipe can be halved which is good for couples like my husband and me.

My family and I really enjoyed this recipe. It was super easy and super quick to make. I made it on a night when the fridge was empty and we couldn't find anything else for dinner. 

I did however heed warnings from other critics on here. I added a small can of mushrooms,  2-3 TBS A1 Steak sauce and 1 packet of Onion soup mix to kick up the flavor a notch. 

All in all a very hearty meal though!

This is pretty much the same recipe I use when I make this. Sometimes I add a few cloves of chopped garlic and or garlic powder (we love garlic! lol) and a finely diced onion to the meat while i brown it. Also I don't like to use that much milk so most of my liquid comes from draining the potatoes. A good tip - you should use quite a bit of salt if serving over potatoes. Add salt until the point that you think it is just about too much. You want the meat to be quite salty because the potatoes will need it.

TRY THIS: Sauté chopped garlic and onions (as much as you love) in 1tsp olive oil until onions are near caramelized, salt to taste. While caramelizing, season ground beef with generous amount of chili powder, 2 good shakes of cayenne, a few dashes of curry and a couple puffs of ginger. Add to onions/garlic and cook until just brown. Mix flour in: 1/8c or less per lb of beef. Add 1/4c milk and mix thoroughly, add chicken or beef broth until desired consistency. Cook over med until bubbly and flour is cooked. Add soysauce/salt/pepper to taste. Serve over rice. =]

Great, quick, comforting dish. However, it was lacking flavor. I added 1 package of onion soup mix while meat was browning, as others suggested, and also added a few splashes of Teriyaki sauce when it was finished as I was out of worcestershire. Turned out lovely. Big hit with kids. Thanks!

This recipe reminds me of the dish my husbands Grandmother used to make. She called it creamed hamburger. I make it about the same way. I do add pea's and at the end I put some celery salt to add flavor. Sometimes instead of potato's I serve it on slices of toast.

My family loved it.  I added dehydrated onions since I was out of onion powder and then added a little garlic salt since I think everything is better with garlic (but only a little for this recipe).

I really did not like this recipe. It got a little better after I coated it in salt and pepper but it still didn't have much flavor. Maybe I just didn't add extra stuff to it? I'm not sure, but I don't think I'll use it again.

I have been making this recipe for years. I brown the meat with the onion.The only other spice I use is garlic powder. I also add a little butter to the gravy.I think the garlic powder adds alot to this recipe.We have it over mashed potatoes. Yummy !!

Very good for those of us looking for something as a break from spicy over-seasoned dishes. Just good old fashioned comfort food. Also good to add your own flavor additions. Best served over fried potatoes or hot biscuits.

I have made this several time. However I use water instead of milk (my family has milk allergies) and will add green peppers. It's nice for something quick and different

very good basic recipie, but does need additional seasonings. I added crushed red pepper, celery seed, and a lipton onion soup mix as well. my husband said it was good, but still put lots of salt/pepper. I like it because i;m sure everyone has their own version. The gravy is a great consistancy. This will be in the rotation at our house.

perfect gravy for my husband, a meat lover, who now often requests it poured over an entire meal. as a vegetarian i honestly don't really understand. it sounds kind of gross to me. but if he likes it, it gets 5 stars in my book :)

This is very good. Have always made something similiar but coating the meat with the flour really helps. I added soy sauce and that really gave it good flavor and I served it over homemeade buttermilk biscuits.  Yumm! My family loved it.

It was pretty good. I used ALOT of salt and pepper. Next time I think I will try to add some onion soup mix and curry just to add a bit more taste. Thanks for the recipe!
