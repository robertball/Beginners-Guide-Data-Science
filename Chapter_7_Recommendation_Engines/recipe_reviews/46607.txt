The main problem with this recipe is that the liquid-to-rice measurements are off. I'm amazed that it got so many good reviews considering that there is either half as much liquid or twice as much rice as needed for it to turn out. I adjusted my liquids and followed the rest of the recipe. The flavors are good - I like the curry and ginger, but also thought it could use a little sweetness and/or more coconut flavor. Thanks!

Good recipe, I followed it exactly the first time except I used basmati instead of long grain rice.
The second time I made it I used 2 cups coconut milk and 1/4 c water and added a little more ginger and again used basmati rice (it doesn't take as long to cook).  It's a keeper.  Guests asked for the recipe too!   Thanks

My Husband and I enjoyed this very much!  We added more water than the recipe called for,  found the rice was not cooking quite right!  Flavour was EXCELLENT!

Depending of the type of rice, the amounts of water and coconut milk have to be changed; anyhow, maintaining the proportion of 2 parts of coconut milk to 1 part of water, all in my family loved the result. And that without the green garnish shown in the picture.

I adjusted the liquids ratio and cooking time  to use brown rice, subbed chicken stock for water, added some garlic and sauteed my onion, garlic and ginger in a bit of oil before adding the liquids and rice.  I also toasted some coconut and chopped cashews that I mixed into the rice right before serving.  I topped each serving with chopped cilantro.  With my modifications this recipe gets five stars, I'll make it often, my husband ate three helpings of it and all three of my 2 year olds enjoyed it.

Bland, and liquid ration off for sure - so I tried to adjust - used much less water, more coconut milk (14 oz was in the can) and less rice to intensify the coconut flavor - also used ginger paste rather than fresh.  I chose to try this recipe because of the rating and a lot of people had tried it - but advise to look for another that has more flavor, or just stick with plain white rice.

I've made this recipe several times over the past few years, always serving it with the "Lamb Masala" recipe I found on this site. They go very well together, as they both include coconut milk and curry. This rice is very nice with Indian food. It does, however, require additional water during cooking.

This makes a very good rice, even done with brown rice instead of white. I did need to add another 1/2 cup of water, and after tasting the final product a few drops of soy sauce brightened it up a bit. Great flavor, slightly sweet and creamy, and a dollop of plain yogurt and handful of parsley leaves accompany it very well.

Wonderful but I omitted the ginger root. This was a great new way to make rice and it indeed gives any dish an exotic flavor.  I served with a chicken dish named "pollo encebollado" and we thought we were eating a dish from a far away land....

I scaled this to serve two and omitted the curry, since I was serving this with another allrecipes.com posting for Peanut Butter-Chili Chicken... This is a great recipe!
I added 1/4 cup of shreaded coconut for more a bit more coconut flavor.

This Coconut Rice is delicious! Normally I don't make changes, but after reading previous reviews, I did make some changes. First of all, I reduced the amount of rice to 1-1/4cups instead of 2 cups. Also, I love curry so I doubled the amount of curry. I thought the coconut flavour really came through - I know other reviewers had trouble with that. Definitely a keeper!

I really enjoyed this recipe. I used 1/4 cup less rice and 1/4 cup more coconut milk and a little more water and 1 3/4 cup rice. It cooked in about 25 minutes. I used powdered ginger. I really liked the flavor. We had carribean grilled chicken with it and fresh salad.Thanks for something different

Great rice!  I did the 2 cup coconut milk/water mix to 1 cup long grain rice ratio and it was perfect.  Next time I think I'll try adding some quick fried fresh pineapple chunks to stir in while fluffing at end. Served it with bbq'd cedar plank salmon and a light green salad.

This was yummy!  I added a couple teaspoons of sugar (because someone from Thailand recommended I do so).  Next time, I'll try red onions for a little more onion-y flavor

I also used 1 3/4 cup rice and 1/4 cup more coconut milk and about half cup more water.   Also used about 2 tsp. powdered ginger and half tsp. garlic powder.  Added raisins at end. It cooked in about 25 minutes. In future, would probably add a shake of red pepper and some fresh pineapple at end of cooking.

I made this recipe with the Chicken Makhani (Indian Butter Chicken) from this site. While the chicken was very good, although relatively complex to make for such a simple dish, this rice recipe was terrible. The ratio rice to water/liquid was completely wrong. I had to continually add liquid to keep the rice from scorching. In the end, it did not even taste remotely like coconut although I added some grated coconut to it for some texture and flavor. It ended up being a gummy mess. It's too bad... but I would not make this again.

Yup, the others were quite right with the water thing, needs either minute rice instead or a whole lot more liquid.  But after added lots more water, it had a good, very mild taste.  Make sure not to have this accompany something overpoweringly spicy. Pretty good.

I think this is a good recipie, but not very coconutty.  I followed the recipie, blindly, and I had to keep adding more water and it took 1 hour to cook.  If only I would have thought about it, and not followed blindly, rice takes two cups of water to cook for every 1 cup of rice.  This recipie needs only 1 cup of rice or 4 cups of liquid.  Not a bad flavor though.

Easy to make.  The coconut milk flavor is very subtle, but gives it that extra something.  Much better than plain old rice!  Will definitely be making again.

needs more curry.  Add red pepper, garam masala and coriander for an added kick.  Goes best with fish, in my opinion.

I made this tonight, and it was pretty good, but more curry flavored than coconut.  I used jasmine rice, and only simmered for about 15 minutes.  Next time I will add more onion, or something else to give it a little more zing.  Still, it was quite good!

mine didnt come out to well and as a prior poster said, the ratios are off.  nice time i am going to just use coconut milk, no water.  and i am going to add the ratio based on the rice directions.  But it was a great idea and I can use it as a base to try othe things.

Had to add a little more water which wasn't a big deal, after water cooked out and rice a little undercooked.  So a little more water (maybe 1/2 cup, didn't measure) with about 10 more minutes worked great.  It was a little on the bland side when it came out but I added a little more of the curry powder and bit more salt and it really came to life.  Yummy, will use again.

We really enjoyed this rice-a nice change from the others. I made lots and put the remainder in a ziplock bag in the freezer and pulled it out for a later meal-yummy

This was heavenly.  I have made this several times as a side to Asian dishes.  I haden't worked much with coconut milk, remember to shake the can wildly before opening it. Also, SunnyByrd (one of my favorite cooks) is correct about this recipe, you need to adjust the liquid/rice ratio, after that is done, it will be great!

Yummy!  This was great!  It was a nice change from regular rice.  It complimented our spicy chicken really well.  Thanks for the recipe.  It has been added to my recipe book.

This was just okay. It was pretty bland until I added a bit more salt. Really, it just wasn't what I was expecting: I wanted coconut, but I got curry. I didn't realize that this is probably the basis for most curry dishes. Now that I know, I will probably use it again, with steamed veggies and extra sauce over it.

smells awesome, but bland, it came out a bit soggy (might have been my fault), but still it wasn't what I expected.  I added some fresh garlic, chopped carrot, and extra ginger and just not a wowser.

I used light coconut milk and I added a bit of fresh coconut to increase the coconut flavor.  I also added quite a bit of paprika to spice it up a little more.  We ate it with our family-favorite Jerked Chicken, and everybody really liked it!  I will say that this is not a side dish for an everyday meal, as the flavor is very unique.

This was really good. I adjusted the rice to liquid ratio using 1cup rice and one can coconut milk plus about 1/2c water. I didn't have fresh ginger so I used powder, I also added peas. Rather than throwing everything in the pot I first sautéed the onion in olive oil for a few minutes on medium, added frozen peas for a few minutes then stirred in the rice and cooked in the oil for a minute before adding everything else and finishing according to the recipe. It was a lovely curry rice pilaf.

I followed the recipe to the letter and it's taste-less...excited to try now embarassed to serve.  I think the coconut milk needs to be replaced with coconut cream (not sure).  Anyway thought I would share my experience so others don't end up in the same place as I.  Best

The flavor of this rice was great. However, as everyone has said, the liquid measurements are off. To fix this, I used the measurements and cooking instructions provided in another recipe on this site, "Asian Coconut Rice," by Silvrezs. Using those directions and the liquid measurements from that recipe, this came out wonderfully.

argh, I made this without reading the reviews and using my own good judgment.  I thought the recipe sounded off as I was putting it together but went with it anyways (big mistake). The rice to liquid ration is WAY off and I figured this out after a full 20 mins of cooking time ( I will chalk it up to a full day at work and trying to prepare more than one meal at a time). I tried to add more water, alas after 1 hour of cooking time I had a big pot of gloppy undercooked rice.. If you are going to try this recipe do heed the reviews (as I mistakenly forgot to read) so yours does not turn out like mine.

I was disappointed with this recipie.  The liquid ratio to rice was really off, and I had to add quite a bit more liquid to get the rice to cook correctly.  The flavor was fine, but would add some raisins for added flavor.

The amount of rice to liquid is off.  I reduced the rice to 1 and 1/2 cups, and still had to add more liquid (I used chicken stock).  It was also bland.  If you've had flavorful coconut rice to compare, this one is weak.  And that liquid thing...it was a hassle to keep checking the rice and pouring in more stock.  The end result was quite mediocre and the texture was dry - not tender.  My son thought it was fine (he's 13), so I will give it 2 stars.

Lovers of Thai cuisine will be disappointed by this bland, undercooked coconut rice.  We used Basmati and followed the recipe to the letter and had to add much more water and spice.  The cooking time is certainly longer than indicated.

This is a real tasty rice, fits my fried chicken perfectly. I cooked mine in rice cooker. Somehow it took longer than the usual white rice. I had to repeat the cooking process a couple of times. Maybe it was my rice cooker that wasn't smart enough. I'll cook it stovetop next time.

This recipe needs more liquid. Rice was undercooked after 15 minutes of cooking and all liquid was cooked out of the pan. I had to soak the pan for a day to get all the stuff burned on the bottom off.

Gave only 4 stars due to the rice to liquid ratio but that is the only reason!  This is a good, subtle rice that goes well with fish, pork, chicken and even beef.  I will definitely make again.

I loved this recipe. I left out the curry as my husband doesn't like it. I used a ratio of 3 parts coconut milk to one part water. Probably next time I will go 50/50.

I loved the flavor! Tooo much rice ! Next time I'll try using only one cup of rice. I kept adding more water with the 2 cups of rice. I will make it again! Tasted great!

I use basmati rice, at ratio of one cup of rice to 1 3/4 cup water the rice turns out perfect. There is definitely a mistake in this recipe, if followed, it comes out very dry. Otherwise it's very tasty.

The flavours in this rice are delicious, but the proportion of rice to liquid is wrong. There should be twice as much liquid as rice, or you will end up with hard, scorched rice. That said, if this issue is fixed it is wonderful.Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe calls for two cups of rice, but the liquid measurements aren't correct.  I substituted chicken broth for water and ended up using another whole can of chicken broth to get enough liquid into the recipe, once I realized I'd been steered wrong.  The end result was alright, but not what I was expecting.  Will be trying the recipe again using only one cup of rice and leaving the rest of the ingredients as is.

This did not turn out for me at all. Not enough liquid as others have stated. The flavor was ok but the texture was a mess due to all the adjusting i had to do during cooking. You can taste the curry more than you can the coconut. Will not make again.

This turned out so bland! We were expecting this to be a good way to make "plain rice" delicious and interesting, and instead it was just a bland, mushy mess. I doubt I'll make this again.

This is great!  We were having salmon one night and wanted something different.  What a pleasant suprise!  Even let the ladies at work sample some of the leftovers, everyone loved it except the two people that didn't like coconut....they didn't.  But I loved it and will definatly do it again.   Thank you for sharing.
