This was tasty. I added some red pepper flakes and cup of heavy cream toward the end and let it simmer a little while until it reduced a bit and thickened slightly.

My husband and I tried this with just two differences.  We used diced tomatoes instead of stewed because they're more "bite-sized."  We also used "bow-tie" pasta instead of angel hair (for some reason he's not a big fan of angel hair pasta).  Not a bad dish, I'd say!  We're definitely making it again.  However, next time we will probably try something closer to angel hair than bow-tie.  I imagine it's easier to eat that way.  We're also going to try a little less tomato and more onion and pepper.

my family loves Kielbasa! Never thought of cooking it with pasta before so when I saw this recipe, i said I should give it a try, because my family loves pasta as well. I didn't have the stewed tomatoes so I just used 2 regular sized tomatoes and followed the directions as stated. I didn't have angel pasta, the only thing i have was shell pasta which is great! My 3 y/o girl loves it so much, she keeps saying "Mommy i love this, mommy its so good" My husband loved it too, and my mom who's the toughest food critique actually said its good, so if she says its good, its really good!!! This is definitely a keeper!

This was great!! I did modify it a little, because I had some things I needed to use in the fridge. I didn't have the green peppers, instead I used Brusselsâ€™ sprouts & asparagus and I used some more spices to make it a little more Hot (cayenne, oregano & Italian seasoning). YUMMY!

Loved this!! I am not usually a huge kielbasa fan but my boyfriend had bought some and I had to use it up so it wouldn't go bad. Great recipe! My son had two huge servings!! (Although he did pick out the green pepers.. hehe) I am definately going to make this again. I now have a reason to love kielbasa!!

This is one of my go-to quick dinner meals. I use red pepper instead of green, throw in some homemade italian seasoning and sometimes I like to make a quick alfredo sauce to make it creamy (which basically makes the additional butter unnecessary). My kids especially love this meal.

This was a very good recipe, very tasty and satisfying.  However, a few tweeks are in order. 1st, cut the kielbasa down the middle before slicing.  Second, a better description of ingredients would be, 1/2 a small green pepper, chopped medium, 1/4 a medium onion, chopped medium, and 2-3 cloves garlic, minced.  For the tomatoes, use diced Italian style tomatoes with garlic for one can and small diced tomatoes with garlic for the other.  The long pasta doessn't hold this chunky sauce well.  I would suggest butterfly, twists or short tubular pasta to better capture the sauce; the new 12oz packages should be enough.  To thicken the sause, grate one cup of Parmesan Reggiano and mix half into the sauce after simmering.  Retain the balance to sprinkle at the table.  Finally, 1st saute the kiellbasa over medium high heat for three minutes and transfer to a paper towel lined plate to drain.  Then add the onion and pepper to the empty skillet and saute for about 5 mins to soften slightly.  Then add the garlic and saute for 30 seconds until fragrant and then immediately add the tomatoes and kielbasa and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to med-low and simmer for 10 mins.  At the end add the cheese and, optionally, butter.

OMG, I made this last night and it was a HUGE hit! I cannot explain how delicious this dish is/was. I cooked it exactly as described and found that it was lacking in nothing. A fairly simple and unfussy meal. We really loved it and all voted that it was a keeper! Thanks so much for posting this recipe. Yum!

I have made this twice already and my husband and I both love it. The only thing that I changed was, we didn't have green peppers so I used asparagus instead.  Very very good. I also used a little more garlic.

I made this dish using 1 can of plain petite diced tomatoes and 1 can of petite diced tomatoes flavored with garlic and olive oil. My family does not like the veges listed (or any veges for that matter). 
My whole family LOVED this dish and we will definitely make this again.

Delicious! I found this recipe after my husband asked me to make some type of pasta with kielbasa. I never thought to combine the two! Anyhow...I added 1cup of red bell pepper & 1tsp of garlic.  followed the directions & tossed the pasta w/1tbsp EVOO & parm cheese before plating.

The only reason I made this last night was because I had all the ingredients in the house and didn't know what I wanted to cook.  I was incredibly surprised.  The flavor of the sauce was wonderful! I had some heavy whipping cream and added about 1/2 of a cup to the sauce at the end of simmering, as suggested by another reviewer.  I think the addition of the whipping cream is what pushed it over the top.  This recipe is easy and very  flavorful. The creamy tomato sauce delicious and it can be made in a jiffy.  This one is definitely a good family meal and a 5 star winner.  Thanks for sharing, Ann.

We liked this...added more green pep and onions. Used 1 can italian diced and 1 can petite diced. Had dry thin spaghetti on hand and some leftover cream cheese, so I put 1/4 of a block in the sauce (saw a reviewer wanted it a bit more thicker). Also added some basil, oregano, and cayenne pepper. Didn't add the butter...didn't need it.

This was a little weird at first but it was good. I used Fettucine pasta, added more garlic and a teaspoon of Italian seasoning. I think green olives or mushrooms would add something to it also.

Excellent!  Used turkey kielbasa and made a small dish for my vegetarian daughter using Lightlife Smart Sausages.  Used tomatoes seasoned with basil, garlic and oregano and added some minced garlic to the peppers and onions.  A keeper!

This was a great starting off point recipe.  I gave it 4 stars though instead of 5 because I just wung it a little bit with what I had on hand.  I used just some regular diced tomatoes since I had a tomato to use up, and used less onion and green pepper since again, I only used what I had.  My son and daughter loved it, which doesn't always happen!

Hello from Bolivia again! This recipe was a great hit tonight. We don't have kielbasa here, so I used a meat called 'Salchicha Vienna', I was not inspired to make the dish with 'Chorizo'. The salchica turned out great though. I completely forgot about the green pepper when shopping, but as I was reading some of the other comments I came across carrots, so I tried that instead. I am a lover of garlic, so I added much more of that . . . actually, I didn't measure anything, I just do it all to taste and preference. Stewed tomatoes are not available, so I chopped up 2lbs fresh tomatoes, added some sugar, salt, and basil and called it good. Didn't have the parmesan either, but I used some grated cheese (no idea what it is) and it ended up being a crowd pleaser. Because I used fresh tomatoes, I added them to the pot and let them cook down for about 30 minutes. This was a refreshing change for us. The whole family (even my very picky 5 year old) really enjoyed this. I'm sure that the actual recipe is delicious (I'll have to save that review for when I'm back in the USA where I can get the correct ingredients), but I say all this to say . . . don't be a stickler to the ingredients and measurements! If you like something, use more of it, if you don't like something, substitute it with stuff you do. Living here in Bolivia has certainly made me a more flexible cook.

Delish!  I used 1/2 a box of regular dry angel hair pasta & added steamed asparagus to up the veggie content a bit.  Just wonderful!

I didn't put the garlic in, but it was delicious anyway.  I think I might try using tomato sauce next time, and adding some basil and oregano (not very much, though - and sautÃ©ing in butter before adding the tomatos)

This was a good dish, with some added changes. Like some others suggested, I spiced it up a bit with crushed red pepper flakes and minced garlic. Also I changed the vegetables a little: squash, red onion, zuccini and mushrooms.  What I didn't change still tasted good!

This was great.  I took anothers person advice and added a small amount of hot pepper flakes and some heavy cream.   We all loved it.  I used regular spaghetti noodles.

Easy and great tasting.  I used two green peppers, one onion, two large cloves of garlic, olive oil and one large can of diced tomatoes with basil and oregano along with the kielbasa.  I also used half pound of elbows cooked al dente and added it to the saute pan.  Served with parmesano reggiano.  It was a big hit and I'll be making it again.

This is great!! I made this for my family today, and they love it! My step-dad is Polish, so we usually have kielbasa on hand. This is a great and easy way to use it up. My brothers loved it! The only changes I made were instead of green pepper, I used 3 small carrots. I let them cook the entire time and they were  so tender! I also used 1/2 c. of tomato sauce instead of stewed tomatoes, and bow tie pasta instead of angel hair. I omitted the cheese, but my family didn't even notice! I also used about 1 1/2-2 cups of mixed veggies that had already been cooked. Yummy! I'll be making this again!

Cheap, easy, and delightful!  I added black olives, red bell peppers, fresh mushrooms, and bow-tie pasta.  I am feeding 3 hungry teenagers and a construction worker, so I doubled it.  Not a bit was left over and it didn't do that much damage to my grocery budget.  LOVE IT!!
**EDIT 2/6 - To make this even more filling and tasty, use boiled cheese tortellini (fresh or frozen) instead of pasta.

This was yummy!! I used Butterball Turkey Kielbasa, fresh mushrooms, fresh zucinni & fresh garlic. I also added frozen mixed peppers b/c that's all I had, a can of petite tomatoes and 1 can of tomato sauce. I know it's not exactly what the recipe called for but, I used what I had on hand and it turned out great!

I followed this recipe exactly as it is listed and it was very tasty but not nearly enough sauce.  Once I doubled the sauce it was really good though.

Since I enjoy and rely on other people's opinion before trying a recipe, I felt compelled to do others the same favor.  Tried this recipe for the first time tonight and it is a keeper.  My husband is a kielbasa fan so it was definitely a hit with him.  I was surprised that no seasonings were necessary.  The flavoring comes from the vegetables and smoked sausage.  I'm sure any variety of tomatoes could be used.

I've made something similar to this for years (minus the green pepper) and it's one of my favorite quick and easy dinners! I use two cans of fire roasted tomatoes and artichoke hearts in mine and mix it up with penne pasta.

This was a delicious quick & easy weekday meal.  I used turkey kielbasa & added peas toward the end as I did not have any green pepper.  A definite keeper - simple, but good.  I also did a little less butter & melted w/ a bit of low fat milk & the parmesean, then added that in.

This is a very good recipe.  Quick and easy.  I didn't have any stewed tomatoes on hand so I used petite diced tomatoes and then added a pinch of oregano & basil.  Didn't have the angel hair so used the thin spag.  Recipe calls for 2 tablespoon of butter but I used 1 tblsp. and olive oil.  Even with these modifications, this recipe is great and going down in my recipe files!!  Thanks

This recipe is good. I forgot to add the cheese but I don't know if that would have made a big difference. Although I gave it a 3, I would still make it if I'm pressed for time on weekdays and have some sausage in the fridge.

This is a great recipe, and has become a regular at our house. The only change I made was I used diced tomatoes instead of stewed. I have also made this with zuccini and yellow squash as a meat free dish.

This was a quick and easy dinner recipe that everyone in this house loved.  I used red pepper, bow tie pasta and just one can of diced tomatoes, since that is what I had on hand.  I did add some dried basil, too, which was very good.  I can't wait to try it again, with fresh  basil.  Definitely a "keeper"!

This tastes like a dish from a fancy italian restraunt.  I had fresh tomatoes I needed to get rid of, so I used those with a bit of water.  In looking at the recipe, I doubted the flavor, but i was so wrong.  This is a flavor bursting recipe. So good.

Just wanted to say that I finally tried this at it was great! I have a family of 11 to feed, so I had to increase the butter, parmesan cheese, and pasta. The only changes I did was that I did not have enough kielbasa, so I also used Italian sausage with it. Added just a couple of extras, some Italian seasoning and a couple of dashes of Franks hot sauce. Also I had simmered my dish about a half hour or so. It takes a while for my water to boil for all the pasta I have to make. Didn't have angel hair, but used thin spaghetti, turned out just as well.  Everyone really liked it and enjoyed the noodles as well.  Will be making this again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was a solid "good".  We actually enjoyed the left-over more than the original dish - the flavors all soaked into the pasta.  We used shell pasta because that's what I had in the pantry.  Use lots of parm for more delish!

Yum!  I made this tonight and even shared it on facebook.  I made it as written, but think next time I will used diced tomatoes instead of the stewed because they are smalller.  I tried to half it, but I still could have used that 2nd can of tomatoes.

This was delicious. Made exactly as written except my husband's tummy doesn't "do" green peppers well so I used red instead. I brought the leftovers for lunch the next day, and I don;t usually do that. Mmmmm.

We liked this very much.  I took some of the suggestions from various reviewers and added a dash of Italian seasoning and red pepper flakes.  To the finished dish I thought it needed a little salt and pepper.  I will make this again.

YUM! I have been trying new recipes and this one was on the menu tonight.  This dish was relatively easy to prepare and didn't take too long.Here's what I did: 1: I put some butter in the skillet along with the vegetable oil to get a nice sizzle. 2: I mixed the kielbasa, green pepper, garlic, and onion in the skillet for about 1 minute, stirring constantly. 3: I arranged the kielbasa flat side up and let sit for a few minutes, then flipped them all to the other side so they would evenly brown. 4: I didn't have any stewed tomatoes, so I used 1 can tomato sauce and 1 can diced tomatoes. This made a perfect amount of sauce/kielbasa for 3 hungry people (and enough pasta for four, as one member of the family is a picky eater)! We all loved it!

Made it last night during the Ravens and Steelers game.  Everybody liked it.  I followed the recipe exactly.  This is a great recipe for a busy week night.  It took no time at all.  Look forward to making it again.

This recipe was great!! I also used diced tomatoes  instead of stewed and added some red pepper flakes and cup of heavy cream toward the end and let it simmer a bit until thickened slightly. The heavy cream put this recipe over the top.

I never would have thought to put these ingredients together but it was a huge hit at my house. I will make this over and over again!! Like many other reviewers I tweaked the recipe based on what I had in the house. That was one of the wonderful things about it, it's very versatile. Thanks for this wonderful recipe!!!!

I too, tried this dish when my husband was dining elsewhere for the evening. I like kielbasa and he doesn't care for it. I used bow tie pasta and red sweet pepper omitting the green pepper. It tasted great! I thought this was a very imaginative invention with putting the butter and cheese on the pasta first, then adding the meat mixture to serve it. It tasted way better than I thought it would. Hubby tried a little when he came home and thought it was ok once but didn't want it in the rotation. That's ok. More for me, and it goes into my file for meals when he is away! Thanks Ann Dee!

I didn't have stewed tomatoes so I used one can of diced tomatoes with basil, oregano and garlic and one can of regular diced tomatoes. I also added red bell peppers and other seasonings to try to give this dish a little more flavor but even doing that my boys ages 8 and 12 only ate what was on their plate to be polite, saying that they didn't like it. Maybe if I would have added red pepper flakes it may have given it a little more of a kick but this is one recipe that we will pass on in the future.

I like thicker sauces so I added a few changes and now. I used 1/2 an onion, added some red pepper, and added a can of hunts spaghetti sauce. Mixed it together with bow-tie noodles and let it cook for a few more minutes, adding the noodles to the sauce during cooking was new to me but really helped the sauce soak into the noodles. I will definitely make this again!

While I did a few things differently, this was a very simple and tasty meal.  I used an entire large green pepper, 2 tsp minced garlic, only 1 can of chopped tomatoes and since I had no Parmesan, I used Swiss.  The meal was very good.  With the Swiss Cheese, it probably wasn't as visually appealing as Parmesan would have been,  but it was still good.  I also add a few healthy shakes of crushed red peppers.  Next time I would increase the canned tomatoes to the full 2 cans and of course use Parmesian.  Thanks for a good recipe.

We made a few changes to this recipe when we first made it to work with what we had.  It was so good we keep making it that way.  This is what we changed: Instead of green pepper we use either red/orange/yellow pepper - 2 garlic cloves - 1 can of diced tomatoes - 1 package of elbow macaroni - Crushed red pepper to taste.  We mix it all together instead of serving the sausage mixture on top of pasta.

My family and I really enjoyed this.. My 5.5 year old doesn't like tomatoes and even she loved it. :)
I only had one can of Stewed tomatoes, so I had to use a can of Diced also.. It still turned out great. I also used Bow Tie noodles instead of Angel hair. I added Fresh mushrooms, and had no Green Pepper to use.

Tasty and easy recipe ... I will for sure make this again!

This was a tasty, convenient, quick, and economical dish to make.  For that, I gave it four stars.  I would not, however, serve it at a dinner party.  It is a good, hearty, family dish that is easy on the budget and easy on the cook.

This was awesome.  I added some fresh mushrooms with the onions and peppers. And for the Oil in the pan I went half olive oil and half butter.  I used Bowtie pasta.  The folds helped keep the juice on the pasta.   5 Stars for sure!!  Leftovers for breakfest.lol  Thx for the Recipe.

This recipe was GREAT!! Not only is it super quick but also tasty! Dinner was cooked and on the table in less than 30m. I didn't have stewed tomatoes in my pantry so I used a can of Rotel diced tomatoes w/ mild chiles and about 1/2 a can of tomato sauce. It gave the sauce a nice spicy kick.

Absolutely delicious.  I did change up the veggies a little, more onion and garlic and sliced brussel sprouts.  It was a surprising delight.  Will make again for sure.

I made this on a recent snow trip for a group of friends.  So EASY and really good. I did it with spicy sausage instead. Fresh parm on top is a must.  Served it w/french bread and a great salad. Getting hungry thinking about it...

Just made this last night for my family, and it went over BIG! I didn't have any angel hair, so I went with using regular spaghetti noodles. It's easy, hearty, and a change from our usual jar pasta sauce. I will be making this again.

I made this recipe and it was a hit at our house. Since I had a couple of cans of pasta sauce I substituted for stewed tomatoes. The kielbasa worked fine and was delicious but I am sure any sausage would work. This one is a keeper. Qucik, easy, tasty.

This was terrific! I added a pinch of cyanne pepper and left out green peppers, we don't like them.  My fiancee adored this and so did I. Goes well with the focassia bread recipe!

This is the best recipe I have ever tried on this site! I am not a stewed tomato guy so I used diced tomatoes w/ chilies and the only thing I added was an 8oz can of tomato sauce. Thank you for posting this recipe Ann!

Anything that all 3 kids will eat gets 5+ stars!  This was quick, easy and very tasty!  We love kielbasa and I am always looking for different recipes that aren't too spicy (2 of the 3 kids love spicy along with mom and dad, but one will not even touch it!)  This was perfect for all of us and you don't have to alter the recipe at all!  Thank you!

It's funny, I came up with a similar recipe a few weeks ago. Day before payday pasta. I use kielbasa, butter and garlic sauteed (sometimes I add onion), then add cooked, hot spaghetti, grated parm and fresh spinach. YUMMO!

This was really good! My whole family liked it,even my non-sausage loving husband, and we are all currently stressed and exhausted!  I made minimal changes, but I did use frozen pepper and onion blend, used a garlic salt seasoning instead of garlic, and added in some leftover tomato-basil-mozzerella salad with the tomatoes.  This was fast, easy, and filling, and I would definitely make it again.

This was delicious. I was a little leery that there wouldn't be enough flavor, but it was great. I added a little red pepper flakes and a couple shakes of italian seasoning. Even the picky hubby thought it was great. He did suggest I add some shrimp to it next time, which I agree would be delicious!

This was really good!  A different taste, but we liked it (including my 2 and 4 year olds)!  I used crushed tomatoes instead of stewed because that was what I had.  The sauce had a sweet taste to it, but it tasted really good with the salty kielbasa - a great flavor combination.  Thank you!

This pasta dish is a nice change of pace. I always try to cut calories where I can without altering the taste too much so I didn't use oil when sauteing because the kielbasa has enough fat in it to "oil" the pan without burning. (Would you ever put oil in a frying pan before frying bacon?) I also omitted the butter because I wanted the sauce to stick to my pasta. The other change I made was I added a little white sugar to the tomatoes before pouring in with the meat & veggies. If your like me and prefer sweeter tomato based dishes (chili, spaghetti sauce, etc.) then add some sugar to yours too. Oh yeah, and I also added some garlic powder and onion powder for a stronger flavor. Thanks for the recipe!

I used Tofurkey kielbasa and skipped the parmesan and butter to make this dish vegan. I also didn't have any bell peppers on hand so I substituted 4 small sliced zucchini, the result was wonderful. I would totally make this again. Super quick & easy weeknight meal.

I was hesitant to make this at first, but I was so intrigued I couldn't resist. I used Tofurky brand "vegetarian Kielbasa", which worked fine, I used 1 can less of the tomatoes, since they're not my kids' favorite, and I added 16 oz of sauerkraut. All in all, the dish was PRIMO! Thanks for the great idea. :)

I tried this with all the ingredients together and with cooking the sausage first, as another review mentioned.  I was much happier with the results of cooking the sausage first and then the veggies.  I did not use the refrigerated pasta.  Very tasty, though.  I also included some diced zucchini from the garden as well as some halved cherry tomatoes.

This is one of my new favorite dishes.  It is super easy to prepare and I don't really change much in the recipe.  The only big change is that I use crushed tomatoes instead of stewed (the BF prefers the sauce more saucier than chunky).  Other than that I usually up the cayenne pepper because we like things a little bit hotter.  Excellent recipe, thanks for a great new way to use up kielbasa!

It was wonderful and full of flavor. My boyfriend and I enjoyed it since we aren't big fans of heavy red sauce, so having the juice from the stewed tomatoes were perfect. Instead of Parmesan we used grated Mozzerella. Yum!

We both thought this was yummy! The only change I made was I used diced tomatoes because that is what I had. I also used Philadelphia plain cooking cream to make a creamier sauce. Next time I would drain the tomatoes a bit in order to make it creamier. And I noticed the zuchini in the fridge AFTER I had made it and would like to add that as well.

Not bad at all!!  I did make changes!  Omitted tomatoes due to the youngest spawn hates them.   Added the following spices:  Italian seasoning, garlic, pepper, smoked paprika and a couple dashes of cayenne and parsley.  A tsp or so of liquid smoke.  !/2 can of tomato paste (8 oz) and about a cup of milk. Omitted the butter.  Reduces the saltiness of kielbasa and keeps the heat at bay too.  Need to work more on this though.  Also, exchanged green pepper with celery.

I used turkey kielbasa and dry noodles and diced tomatos instead of stewed.  It came out great!  I received rave reviews from my fiance.

Wow, this is really good! We had spaghetti at a friends house last night unexpectedly. Since I had planned on making spaghetti tonight I was looking for an untraditional spaghetti recipe. There is no way my fiance would eat spaghetti two nights in a row. I was so happy when I found this. I had everything except the green pepper so I used yellow squash instead. It was so good my fiance had a second plate! I will be making this again.

Fast, easy, and delicious!  Great week night meal and had enough for lunch the next day.  We used turkey kielbasa, the petite diced tomatoes and regular pasta - nice and light meal.  A definite keeper in the recipe rotation.  Thank you Ann!

Wow! This is one of the most delicious meals I have ever prepared, and it was exceptionally easy to boot! My only deviation from the recipe was eyeballing an amount of extra virgin olive oil instead of the 2 tbsp. vegetable oil. This is at the top of my list to make next time I cook for a date.

I made this for dinner and it was SO delicious.  All my friends loved it!    I added a cup of cream to the sauce and simmered it till it was a little thicker and put in some red pepper for a little more flavor.  But it was easy and really delicious!

Decent, simple dish. I only used one can of tomatoes, which suited my family better. Oddly enough, it reminded me of a dish that a Chinese coworker brought to a potluck, only her sausage was cut into thin slivers rather than slices.

I really like kielbasa, and I wanted to love the end result, but it just didn't click for me.  Next time I might use a bottled arribiata sauce instead of the butter and parmesan to give it a little something extra.

Great recipe!  I tweaked it a little by adding black beans and a pinch of oregano. If you don't have pasta, it's also good with white rice.  It's great comfort food on a cold night :0)

Have made this twice now, my family loves it.  I would have never thought this would have been such a hit at my house, but each time there are no left overs.  The only change I have made is to use a 3 cheese blend instead of Parmesan cheese.

I added an 8 ounce can of tomato sauce, Italian seasoning, and red peppers because we like our pasta with more sauce and spice.  It was delicious and the left overs were good as well.  My husband loved it and asked me to make it again soon :)

Really good and a great "base" to adjust to your family's tastes.  I used turkey kielbasa, a 28 oz can of whole tomatoes.  Added italian seasoning, extra basil, salt and pepper.  Used Cellentani pasta.  Yummo! Had leftover meat/sauce over white rice the next day, hmmmmmmmm.

I loved this. Very easy. Very fast. Very good.
Don't even think of cheating and using non-fresh (refrigerated) pasta; this makes all the difference in the world. Definitely will make this again. :)

Fantastic! And soooo easy. I used diced tomatoes instead of stewed tomatoes and sauteed mushrooms instead of the bell pepper (I hate bell pepper with a flying passion) and threw in a can of tomato sauce to give it a tad more liquid but oh man what a keeper. 

One tip - if you'd like to cut down the grease, the kielbasa itself gives you enough grease to cook the onions in. You don't really need the oil. Start the kielbasa first and let it cook for a minute or so, then add the onion. It had plenty of grease without being too much.

Great simple recipe. I had all the ingredients on hand.  My family loved it.  I used turkey sausage and added the onions and peppers after the sausage browned because we like those still a little crunchier and not so soft. Turned out great. Definately a hit with the family.

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE. I made this just as it was written and once it was done- of course I needed to taste it. Well I kept eating; I ate so much in fact I needed to turn right around and make more so there would be enough for my husband who was coming home late. I ate the leftovers the next day AND made it again that week. Great recipe! Hopefully you will love it too.

I have to be honest..... I didn't make this much like the recipe. I used smoked beef sausage as I couldn't find smoked Kielbasa. I also used diced fire roasted tomatoes instead of stewed b/c Im not a huge tomato fan unless its spiced enough to make it taste differently from raw tomatoes.  For the same reason I used two cans of diced tomatoes and one can of tomato paste for a double recipe. I also added some Italian seasoning and red pepper flakes to make it taste more like a spaghetti sauce and taste less like plain tomatoes. Everyone seemed to like it as Im sure they would have had I made it as per the recipe.

Delicious! The only change we made was using diced tomatoes instead of stewed so that it was easier to eat for my 16 month old. We loved it, including my little one who kepts saying "Nom, nom, nom!" while she was eating :)

A nice warm, comforting meal on a cold winter night.  This is a super easy recipe to make up without measuring the ingredients.  I cut up a green and yellow pepper and half of a purple onion that I had to use up.  I sautÃ©ed everything until the sausage was browned and the peppers were limp, but not mushy.  I should have cut up my stewed tomatoes as they were in pretty big pieces.  I didnâ€™t have angel hair pasta, but did have a box of rigatoni and it worked great.  I served this with bruschetta and a toss salad.  Glad we have leftovers for lunches tomorrow.

This is so easy & versatile, we love it! Great for a nice, light lunch or dinner. We have used 2 fresh tomatoes, chopped instead of the stewed, and it's just as good. Also, I butter the noodles but set the parmesan on the table for everyone to add to taste. Thanks for a keeper!

Wow. First recipe so good I had to rate it.  Simmered it long enough to thicken it (about 2 hrs). Fabulous!  Added a little salt, pepper, and basil as well.

This has become one of my favorite "go to" meals when I want something easy but tasty!  Originally, I followed the recipe, but have adapted it slightly the more I make it.  Some suggestions that I've tried are to use red or yellow peppers for a sweeter flavor - I also add a cup or so of quartered mushrooms.  One time we added shrimp along with the sausage and that was WONDERFUL as well. 

This has definitely been one of the best recipes I've found on allrecipes.com and would recommend it (and have) to anyone!

The only thing I did differently was substitute spaghetti sauce for the stewed tomatoes.  I also left out the green peppers as I had none.  This had a LOT of flavor and was a QUICK meal!  I also used penne pasta instead of angel hair.

This is a good comfort food. The kids liked it. I had to reduce the sauce by quite a bit due to the water from the canned tomatoes. Perhaps, don't add that liquid next time, strain the tomatoes out of the can. 

I think I would prefer this with more Italien herbs.

Quite good! I stuck to the recipe with two alterations. I seldom keep stewed tomatoes in my pantry, so I substituted a can of fire roasted chopped tomatoes and a can of crushed tomatoes. I also added a bit of brown sugar at the end to give it a touch of sweetness to complement the smokiness of the Kielbasa. My girlfriend and I both enjoyed it. A keeper for a tasty and quick weeknight meal.

I made this spur of the moment with ingredients that we had in the house. So, first I only had kielbasa & minced garlic & onion, so that's what I sauteed. We had some garden vegetable sauce & marinara sauce to use up, so instead of stewed tomatoes I used up the sauces, which gave the recipe a great flavor! For the pasta, I used the Quick Cook 3 minute Penne Rigate noodles. So tender & perfect taste with the Parmesan cheese & butter~ will make again & so easy!
