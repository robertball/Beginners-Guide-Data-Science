The reviews were mixed... some people loved it, some thought it was just o.k.  The crumb/chocolate chip topping was very loose after baking, maybe add an additional egg.  The peanut butter filling is difficult to spread, so I would suggest cooling the crust completely first.  I baked for 20 minutes which seemed to be just right.

Delicious. However, mine came out gooey more than chewy. So gooey in the middle that I'm not sure it's edible. I'm wondering if I should have baked them longer than 15 minutes. Wish there had been instructions for what to look for when done. Hardest part was cutting butter into the dry ingredients. Also, I poured the milk/PB mixture on top of the hot 1st layer, and then couldn't spread it without breaking the 1st layer. Glad I poured somewhat evenly. Other than that, very easy to make. Bars lifted from unprepared pan very nicely. Would make again, but maybe bake longer.

These were pretty good. The crust was pretty thick and didn't have a lot of flavour, but the sweet peanut butter layer and chocolate chips on the top pretty well made up for it. One of the reviewers commented on the crust being too crumbly, so I added an extra egg white to help it hold together. A good trick to help the condensed milk/peanut butter spread easier on the base is to put it in the microwave for 15 to 20 seconds after mixing. It will spread no problem after this.

Always a good combination of ingredients!  I left out the peanuts, added vanilla to the peanut butter.  It is a little dry to eat, need a big glass of milk!  Had to use an immersion blender to mix the pb and can of condensed milk.  also had to add a tad of milk to thin it out as it was a little thick.  Next time I'm going to try nutella instead of the pb for a different flavor.

After I poured on the condensed milk & peanut butter, and sprinkled the oat crumbs/chocolate chip mixture, I baked it for 35 minutes. The bars were way too underdone after only a second 15 minutes.
