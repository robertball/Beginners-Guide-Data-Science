Very good base recipe. I did make a few changes. I couldn't see using chicken broth when I had clam juice just sitting there. Tossed that in and added a little white wine.

I have been searching for an excellent creamy clam sauce to rival those in restaurants for years.  This is it!  In my house we call it heart-attack pasta, but it is worth it!

It was easy and I didn't take that long as stated on the recipe. You can save some steps and it still very good!

Good, but bland. I hate having to put salt and pepper on a dish and that's what I had to do. This dish needs some more seasoning. And their is no point in spending money on clams when you can't taste them.

I am NOT a fan of seafood, and I thought this was excellent!! It did not have that "fishy" taste that I don't like. Used 2 cans of chopped clams and one can of baby clams. Skipped the broccoli, and sauteed several cloves of garlic with the mushrooms and red bell pepper I used linguine, but I didn't add butter, and I added the herbs and cheese to the sauce after adding the broth and cream. I used half-and-half. Easy to prepare and very filling. Highly recommended.

Very good recipe! I didn't have heavy cream so I used plain yogurt instead. Turned out wonderful. My kids loved it!

Great recipe. Very decadent. Tastes best day one, not as leftovers.

I liked it - others did not.  I subbed 1/2 and 1/2 for cream and subbed cut up chicken breasts for the clams.  I know, I know, not really the recipe, but thought chicken would work better.  I definitely will try it next time with the clams!

I love this recipe. I have tried 3 or 4 other white sauces with clams, and this is the best, by far. And this recipe also works without the clams, or with vegetable substitutions.

This recipe was perfect.  I wouldn't change a thing.  My husband, two-year-old, and I all loved it.  It definitely made more than 6 servings.  We will have quite a few more meals with the leftovers, but we will be happy to eat it again!

Very good. Easy to make and took your short cut to steaming the broccoli; one less pan to wash.  I actually made this with chicken instead because I didn't have any clams and I had broccoli and bell peppers to use up in the frig.  Also, used lowfat milk and it came out really good.

This has a lot of butter, but it is so freaking good! I added an extra thing of clams because my family is a huge fan. It really was a yummy meal! Only complaint was I had a lot of dirty dishes.

Really good...I made it with canned shrimp instead, because my husband doesn't care for clams. He also didn't care for the green peppers, but other than that he loved it, and he's picky. Great recipe....I'd recommend it

The cream sauce overpowered any sense of the clam flavor.

I made it as the recipe states and found it bland.
