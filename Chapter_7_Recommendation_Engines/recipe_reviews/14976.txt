This was so easy.  I figured out that I could just use a little over a cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips in place of the squares.  I was looking for the recipe that would taste like a candy bar on the cake and this does.

In a word, PERFECT. I used good quality chocolate (Scharffenerger) and used this to glaze little egg shaped cakes made with the "Black Chocolate Cake" recipe. This was so easy, so quick, so rich and delicious. Shiny and glossy, very easy to work with, and sets up nicely. I kept the glaze in a double boiler and kept it warm as I glazed my little cakes--just dipped each cake--and had them glazed in a New York minute! I am so impressed with this glaze that not only will it become one of my favorite recipes, but I'm also going to tinker with it to make a white chocolate version as well (may have to adjust the butter for it, but I'll figure it out!) I believe that sooner or later this simple and beautiful glaze will "catch on" and it will become one of the favorites on this site!

Wonderful thick rich chocolate that holds it shape without being hard. Used this on flourless chocolate cake II  from this site that I made in mini muffin tins. I was able to stack these mini cakes with no sticking!

Fantastic recipe!  Here's a trick I learned from my dad: you don't need a double boiler to melt the chocolate!  With the water heating in a regular saucepan, put two thick glass tumblers into the water.  These become your double boiler!  Put 1/2 the butter and chocolate into each glass slowly and stir with a butter knife or a spoon until everything has melted.  I would suggest at least with this method to put the butter in first because it's harder to get it to melt if you melt the chocolate first.  And experiment with different types of chocolate!  I used 4 oz Nestle semi-sweet baking chocolate, 3 oz Ghirardelli 70% dark and 3oz Ghirardelli 100% cocoa and it came out delicious!  I'd like to see how a few oz of mint chocolate would come out, too.  :-)  Good recipe!  Will use again!!

This recipe is fabulous! I don't know why more people haven't tried it. I used it b/c the ingredients were simple, none of that corn syrup nonesense! I used 2 1/2 4oz Ghirardelli baking bars.(Each 4 oz. Bar Contains 8 sections(1/2 oz. each). 2 sections equal 1 oz. I have to admit I am horrible with math so I was confussed with the measurements for the chocolate. I used regular butter b/c I didn't have unsalted. As soon as I poored the glaze on my bundt cake it started to stiffen and has a wonderful shine to it. Not to mention it tastes great. I love it and will use this from now on. Thank you Trica for making my day and my cake great!

I used this on sugar cookies: I dipped my Hallowe'en cat cookies right into the bowl. It made a tasty, firm (not hard) coating. I made half a recipe, and used chocolate chips: 1/4 cup of cold butter with 5 oz of chips in the microwave for one minute, then stirred. They were awesome cookies!

Another nice thing about this recipe is that you can pour the glaze on top of a warm cake. (I did it with a 11x7" pan). Just tilt the pan to distribute the glaze. Great when you're in a hurry and don't want to wait for the cake to cool in order to frost it. Thank you!

After I saw a photo by misserin13, who used this glaze for cupcakes made with Dark Chocolate Cake I, I had to try it. The glaze is everything that previous reviewers raved about. It sets up to a beautiful, shiny, firm but not crackly, and delicious, but not-too-sweet glaze. I combined squares of semi-sweet chocolate with milk chocolate chips, and I used a mix of salted & unsalted butter.

It was easy to make, and looked very nice, but I just didn't think it tasted perfect.  Next time I will add Vanilla or almond extract to give it a little something extra.  It stayed liquid long enough to work with, but set up nicely as soon as I put the cupcakes into the refrigerator.

This is SUCH a great glaze! I've been trying to figure out what kind of frosting/glaze/fondant to use for my mini heart shaped cakes for Valentine's. This was the winner by far! I added a little more chocolate chips (I used a 12oz bag) and the butter and voila! It was spreadable with the ratios I used and I put it in the fridge and it hardened. I will say this, it wasn't like hard like it would crack like creme brulee, but it had a wonderful sheen.

Worked perfect! I used a little over a cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips and melted it and the butter slowly in the microwave and it turned out great. nice and firm and shiney and tasty! I dipped cookies and mini brownnies in this glaze and topped with pecan halves... make sure you work quickly once you've dipped them because this stuff sets up fast! Really good!

This recipe was a GREAT find!    Instead of melting the ingredients in a double boiler, I used the microwave.  It took no time at all.  I let the mixture cool down a little and dipped my cupcakes into the warm glaze.  The cupcakes looked just like Hostess cupcakes, minus the white squiggle~    1/2 batch glazed 18 "Self-Filled Cupcakes I", recipe also on this site.  My co-workers were quite happy with the results... Enjoy!

This was PERFECT! !st though... I used about 1 & 1/4 C. semisweet choc. chips...and melted in the microwave...WORKED GREAT! i dipped choc. cupcakes in this..put it in the fridge to set,although you don't have to unless you want it harder/ chilled like that. Otherwise you can let it set on the counter & It is FAB:) we were litterally dipping each bite of cupcake in this at easter...and we dipped mini lemon cakes in it aswell...to die for!

I made a recipe and a half of this this to coat 16 Fluffy Cake Doughnuts, which are also from this site. This was very simple to make and turned out wonderfully. Not one single complaint about this glaze. NOTE: The recipe's serving count is exact, I was very thankful for that.

Perfect, don't let anybody tell you it's too much butter. Use a small bowl so it's deep enough to dip things into it.

I have used this for many occasions over a couple of years (cupcakes, macaroons, over bundt cakes, on cookies etc) and it works perfect every time! I measure out the chocolate and butter and melt in the microwave on low for a minute or two and it works great.

This is a wonderful chocolatey glaze that dries hard and looks sensational.  I have made it several times now, the latest with a little added peppermint oil to complement mint-flavored Oreo Truffles from this site.  I dipped each cold truffle into one recipe of the glaze and let it dry.  Then I dipped the top in again so I could catch some of the Oreo crumbled cookies as dictated in the truffle recipe.  Yum!

This is so yummy and soooo easy.  I always use it to top the Too Much Chocolate Cake on the site. People rave...its absolutely wonderful.  I ususally use salted butter because thats pretty much all I buy and its fine.

I needed a frosting/glaze for my mini chocolate cupcakes.  This recipe worked wonderfully.  Was able to easily dip the cup cakes in sprinkles after dipping in the chocolate without making a mess and getting chocolate every where.   This is a great recipe.

Wonderful! I used an entire bag of milk chocolate chips, and refrigerated the cake I used it on and it turned out hard and delicious.  Gave the cake a very pretty sheen to it as well.  I will use this again.

This recipe helped me because I couldn't understand why my chocolate wasn't coming out right and it was because I wasn't tempering it. I used this on truffles and cupcakees.

Excellent and easy!  I used it to cover 36 cupcakes (Cream Filled Cupcakes also on AR, also very excellent by the way).  It hardened just to the right consistency so that it didn't crumble when bitten into but also plastic wrap didn't stick on top.  I'll be using this on lots of things!

Glaze is super simple and super delicious.  The photo shows the glaze before it has set so it is still shiny.

I halved this recipe, used chocolate chips and put it in the microwave for 30 seconds on high, stirred and voila!  Within one minute I had a nice chocolate glaze for my pastries!  It couldn't get any easier!!  Thanks, CCACHEF!

Probably most experienced dessert cooks/bakers already have this recipe in their repertoire.  I'm not, so I don't.  I was surprised at only two ingredients and how easy it was, and it worked great.  It really does set up as a hard glaze.  Used it as a topping for Pistachio Eclair Dessert also on this site.

I'm soo going to use this again. I used this as a glaze for a cream filled cupcake recipe i used on this site as well and they turned out so pretty! My only suggestion would be to let it cool for a bit before using it because then it isn't so liquidy, but I guess that depends on what you are using it for.

Yum! I actually like this much better than the glazes with corn syrup. I used 10oz of semi-sweet chocolate chips since that's what I had. I used half of this for Chocolate Zuchinni Cake III and put the rest in the fridge for my next cake. I hope it warms up okay?! I put the cake in the fridge as soon as I was done glazing and it now has a firm yet soft texture. LOVE IT!    I don't have a double broiler so I used a pyrex bowl over simmering water in a pan. Make sure the water doesn't touch the bowl. Anyway, great little trick for a double broiler substitute I see others have done too.

I used hershy's dark chocolate chips to make this and thought it turned out great.  I used it to top a cracked cheesecake and it worked perfectly.  I also made this in the microwave.  I just heated in 10-15 sec incraments and was carful not to let it burn.

I thought it was good, tasted better the next day, unfortunately it just tasted like chocolate melted and hardened. Not much else, I do like a little more flavor then that. Otherwise, quite nice.

Used this to ice doughnuts, and used semi-sweet chips instead of squares of baking chocolate. Perfect texture, beautiful high gloss, and the taste is divine. Definitely would recommend!

Oh my, what a treat. Super simple recipe I used for a last minute dinner with friends. Ingredients are available at a moment's notice. I poured this glaze in between and on top of a rich chocolate layer cake. It was so good, it was almost illegal.

Perfecto! This is awesome chocolate glaze! It dries beautifully and stays shiny as it dries (no weird crackly, frosty, or powdery finish) and is super easy (and tasty). I halved this recipe for detailing an UglyDoll birthday cake... An ice cream bowl set in a cast iron skillet of simmering water works well. Once melted, I immediately poured the chocolate into a plastic storage bag. After a few minutes of cooling, I snipped a tip off a corner and was able to pipe, write and draw with it. Love it! All the glaze recipes that I've messed with over the years - I now scoff at them...

Very easy to work with.  I used this glaze to coat the cake balls (from this site) and they set up wonderfully and when out of the refridgerator for a little bit it's still firm but soft, if that makes any sense.  I've used it three times already and will use it more.

Beautiful and delicous! I let it cool until just before it set up so I could drizzle over my cake and have most of it stay on the cake rather than run off. Careful though, it goes from stirrable to firm fast! I like that this uses semi-sweet chocolate instead of chocolate chips. I know they are nearly the same, but I think the flavor is better (DH says he'd like it to have some milk chocolate combined with the semisweet) .

Silky and easy to spread. But must work quickly, like it says in here, because it gets hard really fast!!

It "survived" a hot day, great!

This reminded me of a soft ganash that sets up. It does have to be refridgerated or froze to harden. I scaled the recipe way down, just to try it, and made it in the microwave. If I made cupcakes, I would definitely try something like this as I am not a fan of most frostings. ty

Excellent and easy, just what I was looking for!  My picture posted is shown on Country Pound Cake (also from this site).  I poured it on while still warm and when it cooled down, it hardened beautifully.  I used some good quality 70% cocoa chocolate bars, yummy!

3 words for this....fab u lous.  I needed a glaze to pour over brownies that I cut with a cookie cutter in the shape of a cross for a christening.  I wanted a glaze that was rich and would slide down the sides of the brownie and set up firm.  I could not have asked for a more perfect recipe.  Sincere thanks

This is a great glaze!  I used it on bite sized brownies and sprinkles them will fall decorations for a fall party!  I used 1 2/3 c. of semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of the squares, and heated it all in the microwave stirring every 15-20 seconds until melted!

This came out very pretty on top of some chocolate cupcakes.  Everyone asked me where I picked them up from.  :O)

Very versatile.  I used this on an ice cream cake and was pleased that even frozen, it sliced nicely without cracking.  It still keeps that hard, but workable texture.  Next time I think I'll use a combo of semi-sweet and milk chocolates, to see how that tastes.

Very easy, and very tasty! I sometimes use chocolate chips so that i wouldn't have to chop the chocolate bars.

Great flavor, but not quite as "drip-able" as I wanted.  I had to help the glaze drip down the sides of the tube cake.  I  made the recipe as written, using Callebaut chocolate.  With only two ingredients, each one should be top-notch.  I would use this recipe again, but probably on cupcakes, where each one can be dipped in.

This is the perfect glaze for cookies, brownies, cakes, biscotti...whatever! I reduced the recipe, let it cool slightly and then used it on a Ho-ho cake for the kids. It set up perfectly with a nice glossy look. I will use again and again.

I also use this to top Flourless Chocolate Cake II (from this site). I put the chocolate and the butter in a metal bowl (my double boiler pan) and set it over the back burner of my stove while the cake is cooking. The heat venting from the oven melts the butter and chocolate while the cake cooks. No fuss!

Wow! So simple and delicious!  I needed a quick glaze to use on a not-so-pretty bundt cake for a bake sale.  I only had a bag of Hershey's Special Dark chocolate chips.  Microwaved for 3 minutes at 50% power then stirred until smooth and poured over the cake.  Perfect consistency - I just marveled as it slowly dripped down the sides of the cake.... really made the cake!  (Which sold in about 3 minutes after being placed on the table!!  And beleive me, I had some competition!!)  Best of all, with only two ingredients I think I may have this one committed to memory already!

This was very easy to make. I combined the chocolate and butter in a bowl and heated it in the microwave at 30-second intervals, stirring between, until it was melted. I frosted cupcakes by dipping the cupcake upside down into the bowl and putting in the fridge to cool. I was surprised at the tastiness and pleasant texture. I will definitely use this again on cakes, cupcakes, brownies, etc. etc.

Very simple, looked and tasted great! I followed a reviewer's advice and substituted a heaping cup of semi-sweet choc chips. I made this glaze to top the 'Chocolate Lovers Favorite Cake' on this site. We enjoyed this dessert after our Father's Day dinner and the entire family agreed it was the best cake ever! Gone in 60 seconds!

Good glaze.  Plenty of working time, does NOT harden fast.  Was worried it would set to quickly.  Had to put in fridge to get it to set.

I haven't tasted it yet, but it was so easy to make. unfortunately it wasn't as easy to put on the cake, I had wayyyy too much and it looked like a chocolate fondue fountain! I'll need to place my cake in another dish and wash everything up once it hardens.

Perfect!  I drizzled this over rice krispie treats (cooled overnight first) and put them in individual bags for a school bake sale.  They were a big hit.  I was worried about the sauce hardening enough to bag them, but it was just right!  I think this would also be great for dipping strawberries.

I used this glaze to top filled cupcakes and it was perfect! I took the advice of another reviewer and microwaved chocolate chips and butter, stirring every 15 seconds. For a perfect finish on the cupcakes, I dipped and swirled. After about 1/2 hour in the fridge, they had set beautifully. Not too rich or sweet and incredibly simple, I will definitely use this glaze again.

WOW... Incredible Recipe.  I made it in the microwave in a pyrex measuring cup watching it carefully.  I stirred it after 30 seconds and then took it out after another 15.  I drizzled it on a Chocolate Turtle Cheesecake I made and it filled up the tiny cracks I had on top.

So easy to make.  I put everything into a large microwave safe bowl and microwaved on high for 60 seconds, then stirred  and microwaved another 20 seconds and stirred till smooth.  It was enough to cover a 9x13 brownie.  I sprinkled some sprinkles after a few minutes and it was set in about half an hour on a cool day.  I waited a couple hours though before cutting and stacking them into a brownie tower... worked well!

I used 5 oz semi sweet chips and 5 oz milk chocolate chips.  Made it in the microwave.  Put it on brownies.  Soooo good!

Very easy to make and use, I appreciate how simple the instructions were! I used this to glaze my brother's birthday cake, and since I've never made a glazed cake before I wasn't sure what to expect or what to look for in glazes. I almost went with a magic shell recipe for a cake! Super happy with the results, it's the best glazed cake I've ever made!

This was excellent and so simple. I used mini chocolate chips. I was using this to cover a big Swiss cake roll that I made and I tripled the amount of chocolate to the same amount of butter and ended up with a coating that made the cake perfect.

I made this to dip Lemon almond biscotti. I used Ghiradelli bittersweet chocolate baking bars.  I melted the butter and chocolate, I removed from the heat, and whisked in a 1/4 tsp of espresso powder and 1/2 tsp vanilla extract. Was outstanding! The flavor of the citrus was a nice balance to the intensity of the chocolate. Made a great addition for a pot luck coffee event.

Here's my tweak: I used 2 - 100g Lindt chocolate bars (sea salt & caramel flavour) and 1/2 cup of salted butter (didn't have any unsalted). This was plenty to slather on top of my chocolate bundt cake. I finished it off by sprinkling coarse sea salt over top. It was delicious and the chocolate bars had little crunchy bits of toffee, which really gave the cake an extra kick.

I made it with a combination of  butterscotch chips and semi-sweet chocolate chips  to equal slightly more than a cup (as well as the butter) and placed the cake in a cool place for 10 minutes so it would harden. Definitely make this again!

Very forgiving recipe that is easily made in microwave. Everyone loved it and as other reviewers stated - it does taste like the way hostess used to make the frosting on their chocolate cupcake years ago.

Awesome recipe! I made chocolate cupcakes but didnt have any frosting so I tried this recipe and it worked great. All I had was some hersheys chocolate bars...so I used 5 oz of the chocolate and 1/2 stick of butter and it turned out really good. I took the wrappers off the cupcakes and turned them upside down, then drizzled the glaze on...perfect

I had a batch of pecan pralines that tasted good but didn't look pretty, so I used the suggestion of another reviewer and used half a stick of butter and 5 ounces of chocolate chips, melted in the microwave for 2 minutes at 80% power, then stirred.  I put it in a little bowl and dipped the candies to coat the tops.  Now they are so pretty.  And taste good too.

This gem of a recipe saved the day for me.  When I turned my 9 x 13 chocolate cake out to cool it broke apart. Not a pretty sight and no time to redo. It could not be frosted with my go to chocolate frosting so I thought, maybe a ganache that I could pour over the cake. This glaze came up in my search and I made it using chocolate chips because I did not have the chocolate baking squares. It worked beautifully. The glaze covered the cake and set quickly to a smooth satiny sheen. You would never know that there was a damaged cake underneath the glaze. I will use this again for brownies, biscotti  and any future cake disasters. It      was a big hit at the birthday celebration. Thanks CCACHEF for a brilliant recipe.

This is a perfect glaze for drizzling! I drizzled atop the Deluxe Sugar Cookies from this site and it was great. I also mixed a Tablespoon of Raspberry Preserves into 1/2 of the chocolate glaze and topped some tiny sugar cookies that were sandwiched together with the Raspberry Preserves. They were a huge success!

This recipe defines baking excellence in my book. Extraordinarily simple, and super delicious. For anyone that is not used to double boiling, a really easy way is it just fill a bigger pot 1/3 full of water and bring it to a simmer than put another pot in it with the butter (or margarine) and semi-sweet chocolate. Just like the recipe says, it hardens into a perfect chocolate layer when cooled. I will use this recipe all the time.
