This was good but I’ve had a few issues with the steps.  How would one add 2 Cups of fudge on top of the cool whip/. You have  to add it after placing the ice cream.

This was made for Christmas dessert this year and everyone loved it.  We made a light version using reduced fat sandwich cookies- light churned mint chocolate ice cream - we splashed a little peppermint extract in the FAT FREE topping and it was great!
