I love Chef John, my favorite recipes are his, i love his videos, and i love 99.9% of his recipes. Unfortunately, this is the .01. A little bourbon after the fact helps.  Sorry.

My wife and I really enjoyed this recipe. I substituted flake style imitation crab meat because my wife is allergic to the real thing. I also cut the cayenne in half and the dish still had a nice heat to it. When I make it again I plan to use diced onion in place of the scallions but still use the chopped scallions for a garnish.

Added chopped fresh cilantro, fresh bean sprouts and lime wedges and it ended up being comparable to a dish we've enjoyed in a real Thai restaurant.

I thought it was decent, not sure I'd make it again but it wasn't bad and I'm glad I tried it!

I didn't think the smell or taste was very appetizing, and the rice noodles took a long time to cook. I had to speed up the cooking of them by boiling them instead of soaking them in cold water for a few hours and then I hot water, like the directions on the package states. This might just not be a type of dish that I'd ever like. This is the first Chef John recipe that I haven't absolutely loved, however - the others all aregreat!
