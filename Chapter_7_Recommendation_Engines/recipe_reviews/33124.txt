This casserole was really dry.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Flavor was okay.  The topping was not very attractive, if you are into presentation.  Will not make again.

EXCELLENT AND EASY~!

I made this recipe for our Mother's Day brunch.  I didn't realize that I was supposed to refrigerate it for 8+ hours and was really worried it'd be a bust.  It was such a hit that I even printed up recipes for our guests! 

The only changes I made is that I used 6 pieces of turkey bacon crumbled instead of ham; and an Italian blend of grated cheeses that included asiago, romano, parmesan, and provolone.  

thanks for the recipe!

This is a great throw together dish. We like to use english muffins instead of the   french bread when we make this for breakfast. I have also made this dish for dinner and added spinach, broccoli,and mushrooms. It was also good with chorizo (instead of the ham) with green pepper and onion. I use reduced fat cheese and sour cream and it still turns out delicious.

Great recipe!  I used 4 hamburger buns instead of the french bread and replaced the ham with ground sausage.  This was so delicious and I think the sour cream/parmesan topping really made this one stand out!  Thanks!

Totally yummy! These are the changes I made for personal taste...I used whole wheat french bread, sausage instead of ham and added an extra handful of cheese. SO wonderful, very moist and different with the sour cream topping. Will make for guests!  :)

We tried this recipe at a tailgate brunch and it was a hit.  It's great since most of the prep is done the night before.

I made this recipe for the first time for a Holiday brunch for 7 ten year olds. It was a complete hit even with all of their likes and dislikes.  It was easy and delicious. It even held together while serving!

This recipe was a little dry and maybe bland for my taste.  I'd make it again, but I'd increase the milk/eggs --- and spice it up a bit, I think.  One unique aspect was the sour cream topping, something you don't always find on a b'fast casserole.

Very good. I made the recipe for Easter brunch and was nervous serving it to my family without having tried it first. Everyone liked it though and I will make it again.
