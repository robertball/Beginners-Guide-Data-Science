Fabulous, but only 4 stars because I had to tweak A LOT! Follow these instructions and you'll love it too.  First cook at 400 not 350.  Increase shredded potatoes to SIX CUPS and reduce your butter to 1/3 cup.  I didn't have paprika so I used 1 tsp of garlic spread mix and a dash of pepper...yum!  Cook for the 40 minutes then put it under low broil for 5 minutes to crisp the top (watch it so you don't overdo it).  Pull it out, add your chedder and back in the oven just till melted.  Take it out and let it "rest" for 5 minutes before eating. (This gives the butter a little time to absorb because you will see some in there when you pull it out.  My hubby and 3 girls devoured this and was so sad I didn't make a bigger batch!  I served it with pork chops and veggies.  Sooo good!

I have been making this for years. My Granmum passed this on to all her granddaughters (with slight differences). My family always enjoys this and we make it regularly. For those that are complaining about it being greasy it is most likely because you are using Margarine instead of butter. My sister did this years ago we found IF you are going to use Margarine instead of Butter then only use 1/2 of what the recipe calls for (so about 1/4 cup instead of 1/2 cup). Just a note using margarine instead of butter does change the taste of this recipe.

My husband and I both liked this recipe. The next time I make this I will add more potatoes. I only used half the butter that it called for and it wasn't greasy at all. This was good, very easy and simple to make. One good thing about this recipe is that you probably already have all the ingredients on hand. Thanks!

I found this recipe to be tasteless and mushy. I did make it according to the recipe as stated -- something I wish EVERY person would do on this site!  Make the dish according to the recipe FIRST and rate it as such, then, if you want to, post the changes you make to a subsequent try of the original recipe. This is the ONLY way to know if a particular recipe is GOOD or NOT so good and isn't that why we're rating these recipes to begin with???

I've been making this for years and find it to be delicious every time. Something similar to this has been made in my family for generations. 
To those who rated this only one or two stars: please rate only the original recipe. If you change it (i.e. using margerine instead of butter) then it's no longer the recipe that was submitted and you're rating your own changes, not the submitter's recipe.

My entire family found this recipe to be, frankly, disgusting. It tasted like old, soggy potatoes, and its appearance was very uninviting. We'll pass on this one.

This is a very good dish but I agree
with another reader's comment...either
add more potatoes or less margarine.
I opted for less margarine but next time
I will even add more potatoes.
Nice taste.

I made a large batch of these potatoes, and no one really liked them. There was too little potato, way too much butter, and I think they were a bit too salty, too. If I were to make them again, I'd definitely add more potatoes and cut back on both the salt and the butter.

This was very bland. I prefer my own recipe for hashed browns, that includes more chopped onion,  sour cream,  mayo, a can cream of potato soup, more seasonings and more cheddar cheese.

The comments at the dinner table were:  rank, mushy, tasteless and gross.  After everyone had one bite, they were told they did not have to eat it.  Out in the trash it went.

This was a good base to start with.  I added 1 thick slice of crisp bacon crumbled up, two green onions with tops.  I think the reason some thought this was mushy is because the grated potato gets very starchy after grating.  I put my grated potato in a large colandar and rinsed all the starch off  before adding to the ingredients.

A different twist!  I followed others and increased temp of oven.  Came out fine @ 400 degrees.  Really rich though! Used skim milk, and might try a better cheddar cheese opposed to processed shredded. May try again some time, worth exploring for a change of tune!

i would have given 5 stars but since i made some changes i only gave 4. i didn't know if "minced" onion was dried onion or fresh onion. anyway i used 6 cups shredded potato and 1/2 of an onion, grated and 1/4 cup of butter. 3/4 cup of milk as well as the eggs. added garlic powder becuz i didn't have paprika. i put a handful of cheese in the mixture. used a 13 x 9" pan at 400 degrees. i used a cooking spray for the pan, otherwise i would have had a heck of a time getting it outta there.  it came out great! all brown and crusty on the sides. i put the 1/2 cup of cheese on the top as instructed but because i put some in the mix, it didn't really need a 1/2 cup. maybe just a sprinkle for looks. next time i will chop up some italian parsley and sprinkle on top to make it look more pleasing after i take it out of the oven. it tastes like potatoes au gratin. super easy and i will definitely make it again. thank you for the recipe!

One half cup of butter for two cups of potatoes is way too much butter!  The potatoes were actually greasy!  And had very little flavor.  I won't be making this again!  Sorry.

After reading all the reviews...this is what I did. Hope it helps someone else who might make this...  3 Cups Shredded Potatoes; 1/4 C Melted Butter; 3 Eggs; 1 Small Onion, minced; 1/4 tsp Paprika, 1/4 tsp Cayenne Pepper; 1/2 tsp Salt; 2 C Shredded Cheese 3/4 C Milk.  So I increased the potatoes, onion, milk and cheese and decreased the butter. It didn't look good going into the oven but it was golden gooey and delicious when it came out! Everyone liked it and there were no leftovers!  I did everything according to the instructions with the extra ingredients EXCEPT I mixed in 1 1/2 C of the Cheese in with the potatoes. The rest was sprinkled on top with a few cranks of fresh cracked pepper.

5 minutes prep time to peel and shred 2 cups of potatoes, beat 2 eggs, mince onion, shred 1/2 cup cheese? Let's get real. Like the recipe.

After reading reviews this is what I did.  I increased potatoes to 4 cups and used a medium chopped onion (my family loves onions so I can see using minced onion to hide them LOL but that was not a worry for me).  I decreased butter to 1/3 cup and added 1/2 tsp garlic powder.  I baked this in a 400 degree oven until slightly brown and potatoes were done (sorry I didn't time this).  I thinly sliced the potatoes on a mandolin because I hate to grate stuff and used skim milk.  We loved this and they asked for them again.  This was a good base and I just changed to suit our taste.  Thanks for posting this and reminding me how good potatoes are baked and not fried.

Excellent! I've made this and variations thereof for years.  I sometimes add dill and or garlic - some green onions makes it rather like a champ casserole its a great side for holidays - For my own taste though, i do use double the potatoes -  this is an excellent recipe. thanks!

Very disappointing recipe... far too greasy and tasteless. I will not be making this again. What makes this dish "Irish" Potatoes?  I'm half Irish and have traveled all through Ireland and have never eaten potatoes prepared this way. For a true Irish potato dish try the recipes for Colcannon or Champ.

I'm not sure why the recipe suggests using so little potato and so much butter.  It's definitely better with more potatoes, less butter and less salt.

I made this for dinner tonight.  My husband loved it and so did I.  I did vary it a bit.  I added one medium finely chopped onion, some Mrs Dash, sea salt, and less butter is better. I will make this often especially when I need to make it for a family function.

Really easy to make and has a great consistency.  Needed some more spice to it.  I just added salt and pepper and it was perfect.  Will definitelymake this again!  Great alternative to fries or mashed potatoes.

This was very good, I had my doubts when I started making it but it was a big hit. It's a bit labor intensive if you have to grate the potatoes by hand but well worth the effort. I belive I used low fat milk and cheese and it was still very tasty.

Very yummy. I read other reviews that said it was greasy but I used real butter and mine was really good.  I did however cook mine very well before I put the cheese on.  It was very browned.  Everyone loved it and had seconds, even my 3 year old who doesn't always eat potatoes.  Also I added half of a chopped onion instead of minced (just for preference) and I doubled it and put it in the same size casserole dish.  It barely fit but it worked.

This was okay.  Not near as good as it sounds, though.  not really very cheesy, and I don't think the eggs help the recipe.

This is so good! Of course, less butter, more potato, like everyone else... but, yum! I can finally replace the old family Cheesy Potatoes with the canned soup. I might add parsnips or turnips, or broccoli or cauliflower, and also lighten each serving up with a topper of minced parsley, lemon-basil, and red onion (and a orange or lemon slice as well). And as for the reviewer that said theirs tasted like old potatoes, I can only imagine that they must have been using old potatoes. And make sure the cheese is good and sharp.

I have to say first, in my opinion, anyone who reads a recipe like this and doesn't tweak it to suit their own tastes does not do them selves or the author of the recipe justice. 
I used 8 cups of frozen hashbrown potatoes, 2 eggs, 1/3 C real butter, 1 C minced onion, 1 C canned milk, 3 ounces shredded sharp cheddar, salt, onion powder, pepper and paprika to taste. I put the hashbrown potatoes in a bowl, added dry ingredients. Mixed egg, butter and milk in a separate bowl, poured it over the potatoes and turned to incorporate. Baked at 400 for 40 mins, topped with cheese and baked another 10 mins. It was AWESOME!

I used 1 large russet potato, not knowing how much shredded potato I would end up with. After peeling I had 18oz of potato. After shredding I had 4 cups of potato. I let this sit between two towels to dry up a bit while I sauteed my onions, I didn't want to use raw onion. One medium onion with a quarter inch dice and one head of garlic finely chopped. Saute the onion in 2T of unsalted butter, add the garlic when the onion is almost done. melt the remaining 6T of butter and mix together the potato, onion, garlic eggs, salt and paprika. I put them into two au gratin dishes (about 5x8, not sure what size that is). pour milk over the top.  Now let's see I doubled the amount of potato, added lots more onion and garlic, 4x the paprika double the milk, double the cheese. Just a half cup of butter though and reduced the amount of moisture in the potatoes. I like the result.

My guys thought this tasted like scalloped potatoes.  I think the only change I would make next time is to bake it is a shallow pan instead of a casserole dish.  This way there would be more surface for browning.  It is definately a different texture for potatoes.

Sorry, there is nothing Irish about this except for the potatoes. If you want a great Irish potato dish, try colcannon.

A friend made this with minor adjustments - she substituted a bit of sour cream for some of the butter (added richness) and instead of cheese she used lightly crushed corn flakes for the topping.  Nice crunch and added texture.  Other personal touches can't change the fact that this is a simply wonderful dish!

Potatoes need to be dried off! This is why it comrs out mushy. With all sorts of modifications to give this some taste, it will not reappear on my table.

Was fairly bland (but I guess that fits with Irish Potatoes).  Next time I will add some garlic and some more onion.  I did use 6 CUPS of potatoes and then 1/3 cup of butter.

This were very good.  I substituted minced garlic, for the onion flakes and only used one egg.  I will probably cut some of the butter next time.

My whole family loved this recipe.  I made it  as directed and added 1 whole onion diced  and doubbled the entire recipe.  I was very skeptical because of the amount of butter but I made a special meal and figured we would give it a try.  I did find it a bit wet on top with grease and would probably cut the butter down to half or a third than called for.  I used salted butter and needed to cook it for about an hour finding I needed to raise the heat at the end of cooking time to get the potatoes done at the same time as my meat.  My son ate his and asked for seconds and ate leftovers the next day. We enjoyed this and I will definately make this again only cutting down on the butter and cooking for longer at 400*.  Thank You for a new recipe for potatoes.

I liked that this recipe can be made easily from ingredients that I usually have laying around the house. I will double the recipe next time as it barely covered the bottom of the pan. Plenty of room for variations such as sour cream, bacon, etc.

Not enough potatoes in the recipe and too much butter, just not good at all.  I have had far better.  Slicing the potatoes and reducing the butter may improve the taste a little.

I hate to rate anyones recipe this low but this one would have been great if you triple the potatoes, halve the butter and blanch the potatoes after you shred them.  Even after cooking them for an hour and a half it was still like eating raw potatoes.  Gross.  The overall flavor was really good.  I would have rated higher if the texture had been better.  However my husband did like it but he would eat most anything.

I multiplied this recipe by 1 1/2 and baked it in a 9x13" pan.  I thought the flavors were good, but there was quite a bit of butter/grease floating on top of the casserole when it came out of the oven.  If I try this again I will probably reduce the amount of butter in order to avoid this.

Because I was pressed for time, instead of shredding raw potatoes, I boiled them first and then grated. I omitted the salt and used parm in lieu of cheddar and topped with a little paprika. Delicious Sue!

This is okay...but not worth the time it takes to prepare. I used less butter than called for in the recipe. It still came out kind of bland even with the sharp cheddar on it. It could use some ham or bacon and maybe some kind of vegetable in it to give some more flavor...I probably won't make it again since my husband took one bite and didn't like it.

Got rave reviews.  I will defintely add this recipe to my normal rotation as a side dish.  However, I agree with previous reviews: add more potatoes (shredded and wrung dry) and use much less butter- a 1/3 cup sounds adequate as there was excess butter in the bottom.  To avoid an extra step, I put the cheese on the top from the before I put it in the oven and it came out perfectly.

I have been making this for years with some changes.  My mother in law used to make it with thinly sliced potatoes.  She made a white sauce and layered it, potatoes, sprinkle of minced onions, some thinly sliced hot dogs, more potatoes, onions, hot dogs, etc, half way add half of the white sauce.  Continue until all potatoes and onions and hot dogs are used up.  Top with remaining white sauce.  Top with grated cheese.  Cook in oven at 350 until potatoes are cooked, about one hr.  She called it hot dog casserole!  My grand kids love it as do we!!

I gave it only three stars because after reading everyones input, I made a few changes myself as I didn't want it bland, greasy or mushy.  I used 3 cups frozen hash browns to save time, 1/3 cup of butter, chopped fresh brocolli, 3/4 cup grated cheese, 2 eggs and 1/2 cup milk.  I seasoned it with Mrs Dash, paprika, salt and pepper.  I did not use onions as I have picky eaters.  Cooked it at 400 degrees for 45 minutes and 15 minutes before it was done, I mixed 1 cup rice krispies (out of cornflakes) and 3/4 cup of grated cheese.  It was nice and crispy and my family ate the whole thing.  I could have used even less butter and if I'd had sharp cheddar, I would have used a bit less cheese also.  Yummy - I will make this again!

My son (6 yrs) and I both loved it! He said he liked it even better than baked mac & cheese which is his favorite. I agree with anyone who said a few modifications and this is perfect. Wanting to go along the lines of more potatoes, less butter as other stated while keeping it  proportional for just two people; I used four cups of potatoes and 1/3 cup of butter. Also, instead of shredding the patatoes I diced them into 1/4" wide, 1/2 inch long pieces. I added about 1 tsp of garlic powder, an additional tsp of paprika (taste preference) and also  1/4 cup of Best Food mayo for a bit of an extra kick. Along with 1 tbsp of onion instead of tsp, I added about 1/2 cup of diced yellow bell peppers. I cooked at 400 degrees for about 40 minutes before spreading a generous amount of chedder on top for another 5-6 minutes. (We like gooey cheddar.) The only thing I wasn't too crazy about was the "eggy" taste... which tasted good, but reminded me more a breakfast dish than a savory dinner... thus 4/5.

Way too greasy. Doesn't say whether the potatos should be patted dry after shredding, but they should be.

I made this for my family of five.  All agreed it was far too oily.  I saw one review who said they used six cups of potatoes and half of the margarine.  I think that would be better.  We would have liked it with less margarine - and I didn't use as much as it called for.

I added black pepper and Tabasco sauce for an extra kick.  The next time I make this, I will definitely increase the quantity of potatoes and decrease the amount of butter.

I took the advise of others and added more potatoes.  THe only problem I had was the baking time.  I needed at least an hour and 10 minutes.  Te milk adds a sour creamyness to it.  My boyfriend is not a fan of sour cream but he didn't complain about this at all.  : )

An awesome comfort food, so good.  Grating the potatoes is easier with a food processor if you have one!

I didn't read the suggestions until after I put this in the oven, but it was sooooo good! However, it was not pretty to look at. My 2 year old wouldn't touch it, but my 8 year old loved it. Pretty good as leftover too! Next time I will follow the suggestions of more potatoes.

I followed some of the advice and used 6 cups of potatoes. I also cut the butter back some also. My family thought we could cut it back to half even with the extra potatoes. My little brother, who will not eat potatoes, ate these and liked them! The other addition I did was to add a little garlic powder. I'll be making these again!

Great new way for potatoes.  I think I will use PepperJack cheese next time as it needed just a little more kick.

It was very good, I honestly would say I have to agree with the majority that the Butter could certainly have been cut down slightly.  It's certainly worth another go, but I think for my next attempt, I'm going to Chop the onions (to match the shredded Potato), mix in some shredded Spinach, and Mix approximately 1/2 of the cheese into the initial mixture, for a tad more stick to the casserole.

I've had better and I've had worse.  I probably would think it was better if I was in Ireland.  I thought this dish was very greasy.  I would eat it again if I were served it at someone's home.  But the next time I want something Irish, I'll try some recipe other than this one.  This is not the worst thing I've ever tasted though.

Love the simplicity of the recpipe and the taste was great.  However, I agree that the recipe calls for way too much butter.  Also, the consistency was a little strange and took a little while to get used to.  Will definitely make it again using less butter next time.

I watch my fat intake, so cut the butter to about 2 Tbsp.  It was still plenty buttery!  I also added a little extra onion.  These were great and brought compliments from the family.

Great, simple recipe. I doubled the recipe and added some cheese with the potatoes as well as on top. Also, it tastes great if you bake it a little longer until the edges become a little crispy. Great with corned beef & cabbage.

This was pretty good I liked it a lot but it was a little dry for my taste.  Prefer the cheesy potato casserole with the sour cream and mushroom soup in it.

I would give this 3.5 starts. It was pretty good, family enjoyed it. I baked a layer of broccoli over it and served it with meatloaf for something different. I missed the regular mashed potatoes but I would like to experiment with it, (perhaps mix it with sour cream and onions or some bacon bits) and serve it with something else.

Ah I have been making this for years but with some tweaks. I first heat tater tots sprinkled with seasonings in a pan (size depends on servings being prepared) sprayed with non stick cooking spray in a 375 degree oven, while I am mixing together 2 eggs per serving with seasonings of choice, pour the eggs over heated tater tots, cover with tin foil and bake appr. 30 min + for additional servings. Casserole will be firm to touch, then add cheese to top, return to oven untill melted and serve.

Thought this was super-yummy!  My kids were not fans, but my picky husband was! I doubled the recipe.  Had to cook a little longer that the directions said, 40 min, then about 15 more once I put on the cheese.

I baked it at 400 like others suggested, but I wished I had also cut down on the butter.  This was way too greasy and that was after adding a lot of potatoes.  It is slightly bland.  Definitely edible, but nothing I'd be craving.  Probably won't be making it again.

I added more cheese b/c that's what the family likes and it tasted great. I did add more paprika and salt than what it called for. It was the first time I made it and I was asked to make it more often.

This tasted good, but didn't look so great! I didn't like the way the eggs looked in it. I had to put them off to the side of my plate. This had a nice flavor but next time I'd add more onions and even try turning it into a breakfast casserole.

I generally love potato casseroles, but found this one to contain way too much butter for my taste.  Adding more spices and seasonings would improve the dish, as well.

My husband really liked this but I didn't care for it.  (for some reason it tasted too...salty?)  Okay dish.  Might try it again some time.

This was easy and delicious.  However, it took considerably longer than 45 minutes to cook at 350 degrees in my oven (at least 1 1/2 hours).  Everyone loved it!

Fast and easy, but not very flavorful.  I ended up adding salt and pepper, and some chili powder, and it was a little better.  There were left-overs though, and no one ate them.  I ended up having to put them down the garbage disposal.

we are 4 and 2 people really couldn't eat it. On the contrary, my husband and daughter were not so negative and said it was different but good. I honestly prefer many other, more or less similar, recipes with potatoes, also not involving the shredding process, which is frankly not worth while in my opinion. All in all, I really don't think I'm going to repeat the experience, sorry!

Good, simple recipe that could be used as a main dish if you add more ingredients. I added Italian sausage, and mushrooms. Maybe it's not "Irish" anymore, but it was hearty enough to serve as a main dish. Thank you for posting!!!

This recipe is absolutely delicious! After reading the reader comments I did make a few changes. I halved the amounts of milk, butter, and only used one egg. I believe that some readers didn't really take into account that potatoes have liquid in them in addition to the liquid and salt you're adding. So after I put the potatoes in the pan I poured half of liquid left in the bowl on top. They came out great and I will be making this again!!

I read through a bunch of reviews and decided to add an extra potato and half the butter.  It only took 10 minutes to put this together, I don't know why it took others so long.  I did it all by hand.  ANYWAY, it was awful.  SOOOOO GREASY.  I used REAL butter and it was still nasty.  Plus, the potatoes tasted raw after cooking them 40 minutes in the oven then another 5 in broiler.  I ended up cooking them in the microwave afterward for additional 15 minutes but still, didn't help the taste.  After the family tasted it, I ended up throwing the rest out.

Very good and easy. Next time I will cut down on the butter and try it with frozen shredded hash browns. I also used smokey paprika. A little more flavor.

My children and I (except for 1 really picky eater) all love this dish! It doesn't even make it onto plates - everyone just gathers around the baking dish to eat it. The first time I tried making it, I tried to shred the potatoes myself. That make it extemely soggy (as per other reviews I've read on here), but the next time I used frozen shredded potatoes (like for hash browns) and it was great. I'm thinking chopped ham or even crumbled bacon will be a good addition.

I should have known not to put a half cup of butter to two cups of potatoes. Half of the butter sat on top of the casserole after baking it off. It was a greasy mess.

My family enjoyed this dish. I doubled the potaoes,used no butter or paprika and added only 1/4 tsp. of salt with a sprinkle of garlic powder.I mixed the cheese in as well and baked it for 1hr. I should have baked for 15 more minutes. It was still tasty and filling!

This recipe is amazingly delicious!  Even my boys, who are picky as all get-out, ate every bite and said, "This is actually really good!"  I took the someone's advice and made more like 5-6 cups of potatos, I grated half a small onion instead of just a teaspoon, I added a clove of garlic and fresh-ground black pepper (about a quarter teaspoon), and a half teaspoon of dried rosemary, which gave it a really nice flavor.  I also took the advice of someone and broiled it after cooking, for four minutes, to crisp up the top before adding the cheese.  This is really, really good, and I will definitely be making it again.

I followed the receipe exactly, except I added the cheese before I started baking, oops.  Still came out great.  Think of it more as a side dish, because there's no meat.  Might add diced ham or sausage next time to make it more filling.

I made this recipe for St. Patrick's Day. However, I added hamburger. I first cooked up the hamburger using onion, garlic, worcestershire sauce and steak sauce, then added it to the potato mixture. My husband really enjoyed the casserole prepared in this manner. He wouldn't have enjoyed it as much, otherwise.

too greasy, way too much butter. I wish I had read the other reviews on here first would have taken the advice about less butter. The texture was a little wierd too. How about cooking the potatoes first then mashing them and adding the additonal ingredients and browning in the oven? Guess I won't make this again.

Good!  I used much less butter (3 tablespoons), a little less milk, more onion and more cheese and along with cabbage it made for a good vegetarian St. Patrick's Day dinner last night!

Great St Pat's Recipe! My daughter doesn't like corned beef, but wanted something "Irish" for the day and we all loved these potatoes. I followed the recipe, but did use 1/3 cup butter instead of 1/2 but didn't bother to measure the potatoes, knew I had way more than 2 cups.  Will definitely make this again. Thanks for the new twist on St Pat's Day food!

I followed PP advice and used about 6 cups of shredded potatoes and just about 2 1/2 Tbs of melted butter.  Baked at 400 for 45 min, then added colby jack cheese and broiled for 4-5 min.

This recipe was a big hit with my guests on St. Patrick's Day.  I followed the advice of other cooks and added a couple more potoatoes, as well as added a bit more cheese on top, and it tasted delicious. The appreance of the dish wasn't the greatest, but that was easily overlooked by the taste. I was asked for the recipe that evening from a couple guests, therefore, I will be making this dish again in the future!

This recipe was delicious, did follow the other users comments and used 2 tbs of butter, 5 medium potatoes, and added garlic power, and substitued green and white onion powder for the minced onion.  I mixed the cheese in the mixture then added more to the top.  I also added in ham for a different flavor and more appealing look as well as parsley.  Cooked for about an hour and twenty minutes.  Was delicious, will defnitely make it again!

I used olive oil instead of butter and it did NOT turn out at all.  It was very oily.  Hopefullly it's better with butter.  If I made it again, I would add broccoli or some other vegetable and more cheese.

The only real changes I made were to use Old Bay seasoning instead of paprika and an entire small onion diced fine.  Otherwise, I used four medium potatoes and increased recipe accordingly.  It baked perfectly - the potatoes retained their shape while being tender and creamy, with a nice cheese topping.  My husband loved it, the rest of us found it inexplicably lacking... something.  The recipe works, which is why I gave it three stars.

It took a lot longer to bake, even with the oven set at 400°. When if finally was done and served all the liquid ingredients were curdled. No one liked it.

As is, this was ok. It definitely needs more seasoning. I adjusted some of the seasoning after tasting it when it came out of the oven, but it wasn't quite enough to make it 5 stars. I'll definitely make it again, but I'll add more seasoning. Thanks for the recipe.

Neither my husband or I are Irish however, I do corned beef & cabbage every St. Patrick's Day but I do not like the traditional "boiled" dinner so I found this recipe 2 years ago & not only do i make it on St. Patrick's Day but I make it a few more times during the year (mainly because it is loaded with calories or else I would do it at least once a week!)  It is delicious! 
UPDATE:  I made this yesterday on St. Patrick's Day and had another couple over for dinner - they absolutely LOVED it.  I doubled the recipe and there was on about 1/4 of it left.

did what i needed to rescue aged potatoes with what i had on hand.  four medium yukon gold potatoes, not peeled but grated, three eggs, half the butter and salt, added a chopped med/small onion.  just filled the 1.5 qt pyrex dish. next time i will cook it a bit longer though as it was still a bit crunchy. add s&p at table, if desired.

I loved this and so did everyone else.  Unfortunately the only reason I can't give 5 stars is because I couldn't follow the recipe exactly. Somehow inexplicably I had no cheese in my house whatsoever so I made this without any cheese in it. I'm certain that a nice sharp cheddar would have made this even better and 5 stars.  

I will be making again soon and with cheese I'll up my rating to 5 LOL
