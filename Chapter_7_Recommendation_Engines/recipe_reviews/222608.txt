I agree with another reviewer who said they were not pretty but they tasted great. Once you mix the ingredients, the batter was similar to a really thick pancake batter. Like pancakes, make sure to leave room in the pan for spreading. That may help with their appearance. I threw in the left over french style green beans (chopped up) and they tasted  pretty good. Could use a little cheddar or Parmesan cheese for sharpness.

These are awesome! I had exactly 2 cups of leftover potatoes and had a craving for potatoes. What a great evening snack :) I cooked them up in butter and I used garlic salt that had a little parsely in it. I added a little salt after cooking...even though you really don't need it if u use garlic salt and not the powder.

Good base recipe...I double the flour, add pepper, shredded cheese and botb garlic and onion powder, then I roll balls in some flour, then flatten and fry in butter & oil...they don't spread this way  and are more crispy :-)

DELICIOUS!!! I am so glad I found a easier alternative to potatoes pancakes, just one big pancake. I cut it in quarters afterwards, topped with sour cream and chopped green onions. Such a good breakfast. I won't be afraid now when I have mashed potatoes left overs when we have guests, I even need leftovers :-)
I want to make things clear for those who said it was bland: If your mashed potatoes were bland, then this will come out bland too. The mashed potatoes should have the right amount of salt and be tasty, then you'll get a great pancake. I don't know how other people make mashed potatoes, maybe they just mash them and that's all. I always add salt, butter, milk, and sometimes a little sour cream and a dash of garlic powder. They are not bland. So my pancake wasn't bland either. Thank you for this recipe!

If you like bland food then you'll like this. The first time I made it I didn't like it at all. The next time I added more garlic, some paprika, a little salt and pepper, onion powder and a little finely chopped jalapeno pepper. It was much better.

Excellent - but I found one egg to be sufficient. I also made them into individual patties.

Made this recipe tonight, adding a little Mexican 4-cheese to mixture and topping with sour cream and a sprinkling of cheese--Yum! and easy too.  

Just a comment to some reviewers regarding appearance:  This recipe is for only one big pancake which does not require flipping while cooking.  When inverted onto the serving plate, the nicely browned side makes an appetizing appearance. Cut into wedges for serving.

This is the easiest recipe. it cooked up yummy and brown and even. I should have taken a picture of my result. It looked almost exactly like the picture in the recipe. Unfortunately, we ate it all and now it's too late to share my success.  Best and easiest use of leftover mashed potatoes!

I had about 2 cups of leftover mashed in the fridge from Thanksgiving and this was EXACTLY what I was craving.  I looked around because my first impulse was to make patties and bread them but I wasn't really wanting to deal with the mess.  Anyone who says that they are not getting crispy pancakes, 2 steps: 1. make sure your pan is HOT, I had it preheated at about med high & 2.) put a T. or 2 of olive oil in the pan so it has something to fry/crisp in.  Sour cream is the perfect topper.  Great breakfast.

These are really good. Served with bacon and eggs for breakfast. I cooked the potato cakes in the bacon grease. Yummy! Thanks!

Trying to recreate a childhood memory & reader tips helped me nail it!  I have made many times with wonderful taste, but not pretty on the presentation.  Think it helped to keep leftover potatoes cold & make sure the oil & pan are hot to create a good crust.  Can't rush the flip.  I used about 1-1/2 cups potatoes & one egg.  I added garlic powder & about 1/3 cup shredded Parmesan & they were delicious!  Served with grilled pork chops & roasted brussel sprouts for a fabulous cold winter dinner.

I think they came out pretty bland, but they certainly have potential. Next time I plan to add some sauteed onions to the mix, and place a poached or "over easy" egg on top.

Made these for breakfast this morning.  As many of the reviews said we made some adjustments.  We added some salt and pepper, 1/4 cup cheddar jack cheese, extra garlic and 4 slices of crispy diced bacon.

I used 1/4C all purpose King Arthur flour and 1/2 tsp granulated garlic, but otherwise followed the measurement specifications. They were yummy! (I also had a mashed potato/parsnip puree blend leftover, so that's what I used instead of plain mashed potatoes.)

One of the best uses for taters...BUT - don't forget to crumble some (real) bacon in there.

I tried these using the exact recipe and I don't know what happened???
I couldn't keep them together in the pan to fry...or mash down or flip or anything.  They were just too thin I guess.  Needed to be thicker consistancy and hold together.  I tried adding more flour but that didn't really help.  Maybe the mixture got too warm?  I just don't know, but I'm going to try again because the taste was still good.  I saw another recipe suggesting to use 2 eggs, but to separate them and only add the yolks to the potatoes at first...then whip the whites till fluffy and fold into the potato mixture just before ready to cook and makes them light and fluffy on inside and crispy on outside.  Also suggested keeping mixture very cold.  Maybe I will have more success.

This recipe definitely needs more flour when its being made with leftover mashed potatoes.  Leftovers usually already have extra liquid added, and the eggs add even more.  You need at least a third to half a cup of flour to hold it together.  I recommend self rising flour, or add about a teaspoon each of baking soda and salt.

My mom always made potato cakes out of leftover mashed potatoes when I was growing up, but I never bothered finding out how to do them. I couldn't believe how easy it is!  I didn't measure anything, but my leftovers appeared to be about 1 1/2 cups, and I used one egg, 1 chopped green onion (next time, I'll add more), and 1/2 TBSP flour, then fried them in a non-stick skillet with a little olive oil.  There were no leftovers this time!

I tried to stick to the recipe pretty much but did alter a few things. I took the advice of some of the others who said use only one egg, and I added real crispy bacon bits to my pancakes. I also seasoned to my liking. When they were done, I loved the way they looked but when I tasted them the flour seemed to over power the taste. Disappointed, I couldn't finish it but I knew what I did wrong and so I'll pass that on to you so as to not make the same mistake. I placed my pancakes  on a bed of  light flour before frying, believing that would help keep them together and fry better however, it compromised the taste so I look forward to trying this again missing that step. Overall, this is a great recipe and I'm going to give it another try. Hopefully with better results.

I am so glad I found this recipe! I vow to make extra potatoes every time. They were a huge hit with my family. The pancake was easy, quick, and a nice change as a side for our suppers. Last night was pork tenderloin but I feel this could go with any meat. People who say they were bland, just had bland mashed potatoes. Like any recipe, if you need extra spice? Just add it. That does not reflect on this recipe at all. Use your imagination.

I just made these this morning and my boyfriend asked why we haven't always been doing this w/ our leftover mashed potatoes, lol. I made a couple of over easy eggs, so the yoke ran onto the taters...so yummy!!

Quite bland like someone mentioned earlier. I would recommend turning them over after 5 min. Needs more seasoning somewhere just haven't figured out what. The texture is pretty good. With a few modifications this could be a good dish.

This is a great way to use up those leftover mashed potatoes! I doubled the recipe, but omitted the garlic and chives - as we always make our mashed potatoes with chicken stock and real garlic - so they are very flavorful to start. My kids really liked them with sour cream. Will make again.

Good basic recipe.  I added more flavor to the mixture by adding shredded sharp cheddar and more garlic powder.  Also, cooked them in individual patties.

I added chopped onion and panicked when I couldn't get them to stick together! Grabbed the Parmesan Seasoned Panko Crumbs and thickened these up WOW you gotta try it! My daughter wants more. We put guacamole on top. Funny how some accidents turn into something wonderful.

I tried to make it it tonight.  When I flipped the pancakes, they fell apart.  What didi I do wrong?  My mashed potatoes are made with sour cream and cream cheese.  Could that be the reason?   They tasted good, but appearance was something to be said.

I'm with several others who think two eggs is too much. This made it necessary to add lots more flour. But, after that it-it was great. I'll make it again soon!

This was the biggest disaster I've ever had in the kitchen! The temp was too high as they burned in the middle. Wouldn't have done one big pancake. They stuck to the spatula when pressing down so that really wasn't possible. They turned out to be scrambled potatoes rather than pancakes! I was introducing potato pancakes to my husband tonight but he'll probably never want to try them after this!

Well, I didn't have any leftover mashes potatoes, but I did have a big ol' bag of instant potato flakes. Made about three cups of potatoes, made the recipe without the chives because they were for my grandsons,and I added some pork breakfast sausages on the side  and...voilá!! They ate 'em all gone!!
I got me a new kid-friendly recipe! Who knew?

My Mom made these when we were little.  I tried to imitate it years ago, but my Mom says she used to use "a little of this, a little of that" and mine never turned out.  These were perfect and just like Mom's.  She never put chives, but I had some dried ones and added along with a little onion powder and pepper, in addition to the garlic powder the recipe called for.  Thanks.  This is a keeper.

It was pretty good, except it was lukewarm in the middle even though it was browned well on both sides. I did have to add a couple more tablespoons of flour as my taters were watery. I also made a few changes like adding chopped green onions directly to the mix, adding 2 teaspoons  dry ranch mix since  I was using roasted garlic mashed potatoes to begin with, and added about a half cup of shredded cheese.  Making them individually right now and this time adding three-quarter cup of bacon flavored cheddar cheese and 1 tablespoon of dry ranch mix. Maybe will even top them with some crunchy crumbled bacon & a fried egg! They’re sure to be delish!

I might make it again, but it's very bland. Next time I'll add salt and pepper. Needs more garlic powder or fresh garlic. Something. It needs more.

The ingredients work, flour eggs etc. Cooking for 10 minutes covered over medium high is a disaster. I thought so after reading  it so I cooked uncovered about 4-5 minutes, reduced heat to medium low, flipped them and covered for 4-5 minutes. They were crisp outside and warm in the middle. I had a bit left after initial batch and tried it covered for 8 minutes on medium high. Burned to a crisp

I added Mozzarella Cheese and diced onions to the mixture. I didn't have chives. I used 1 tsp Onion powder.
It was so delicious. I ate the whole plateful.
I plan on adding pieces of ham next time.

Thank you for sharing this recipe with everyone.  It was delicious!  My kids couldn't stop going " Mmmmm...Mmmmm." I used fresh unseasoned mashed potatoes my wife made so I used onion salt, garlic powder, and some Kraft powdered parmesan cheese in the recipe and tasted the batter until I was able to pick up the flavor.  Also I omitted oil in the mix since I am a generous with the oil in the frying pan.  I was able to get a good golden color in the crust but the inside of the pancake didn't turn into a crumb like regular pancakes.  The mashed potatoes may not have been boiled long enough as I could still pick up a slight firm texture while chewing and I thought potato pancakes usually have a loose internal texture.  Nonetheless, the wife and kids both love this and I will remember it for the future!

I am giving this four stars just because I made a few small changes.  Our mashed potatoes were already rather seasoned, so I didn't add anything mentioned here.  I did add about a 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar cheese, though!  Yum!  This was really good.  I topped my patties with sour cream after they came out of the skillet, too!  Will definitely make again and again!

my family has made these for over 4 generations. except we don't add anything except salt & pepper and fry in margarine or butter. we prefer the left overs to regular mashed. the real trick is to let the margarine get a good crust to it without burning before you flip them so they are a nice gold n brown color.

I made these but with a twist. I doubled the flour, doubled the garlic added salt and pepper a few dashes of tabasco sauce, two dashes of cayenne pepper, 1/8 cup of good parmigiano reggiano, 1/8 cup of finely grated cheddar, and about half teaspoon of parsley. made balls rolled them in flour and then fried them in light extra virgin olive oil and 1 tablespoon of butter. They were so good if you add a salad you have lunch or dinner.

What a great way to use up leftover mashed potatoes! I only had one egg on hand which worked out fine. I added salt and pepper and a little extra oil. I also made individual patties out of habit due to years of making potato latkes (these taste better). Savored and saved!

Just finished making these and I really enjoyed them for breakfast with eggs; the leftovers will be a side dish for my husband's dinner.  I didn't have two cups so used only one egg. The changes I made were:  I used finely chopped red onion and garlic salt and more flour.  I also made individual ones instead of one big pancake.  When finished cooking, drained on paper towels to absorb some of the greasiness.  Will definitely be making them again.  This recipe is much easier than my scratch potato pancakes and more convenient when in a hurry.  Susan P.

Very disappointing. NOT crispy at all, mushy in fact, and lacking flavour even with the addition of loads of garlic and grated onion, not to mention salt and pepper, and cooked in butter/oil.  Might be better with only one egg.

These were very good. I too found one egg to be sufficient. Added equal amounts onion & garlic powder as well as salt & pepper. I used a nonstick skillet & was able to omit the oil. I'll be making these again.

Loved it!  Based on the reviews and what I had on hand, I omitted the chives and ended up having to triple the flour. (Maybe my potatoes were too wet.) I also added salt & pepper and was glad I did.  Next time, I'll reduce the heat to medium after I cover the pan.  It was browning too quickly. Note to self: make sure to ALWAYS make too many mashed  potatoes from now on!

this was good, the reason some may not of liked it had to be because there mashed potatoes were bland, this is the base to the recipe so if your potatoes were not good that is your fault not the recipe itself.

These were okay - I made as directed, but the garlic flavor was too pronounced for me.  It is possible I had used garlic to flavor my mashed potatoes (can't remember - sometimes I do, sometimes I don't).  Either way, I think I'd nix the garlic next time.  Just not a flavor I'm used to having with breakfast...

This recipe is really good! A great way to use up mashed potatoes, which we always have leftovers for. Even the skeptical hubby ended up loving it.  I will try adding some curry powder next time - I think that would be really really good.

I gave 4 stars cause of the extra flour I had to add. It was a good recipe. Add more flour to your potato cakes if the potatoes aren’t coming together after adding recipe ingredients then add oil to pan ( I used avocado oil) pouring potatoes in hot pan but not on top of each other while cooking this will give you more room when ready to flip them leave potatoes in pan cooking until you see the rim of bottom of cakes turning  brown then flip them I feel this is the secret for the success of this recipe with them turning out scrumptious. There are so much you can add to your left over potatoes before cooking like cheese, chives, jalapeños peppers ( with seeds left out but optional) garlic etc. Then top off with butter, green onion tops or sour cream to taste. Delicious!

I made 2 batches, one exactly following the recipe, 1 with modifications. I would give a 5 star with the following modifications: Add 2 tablespoons finely chopped red onion, freshly ground salt and pepper and 1/4 cup finely grated sharp cheddar cheese. I got oil very hot in skillet, dropped potato mixture into personal size cakes, flattened somewhat with the back of a spoon and cooked till crispy, flipping once. Served with sour cream and chives. They stayed together nicely and were delicious.

I didnt have chives..well I had dried but omitted.  But my aunt used to make these whenever we visited her in the Bronx.   Hers were very simple.  Might sound odd but she would put melted butter and sugar on them..lol..its delish

The secret to success is making just ONE big pancake. I did flip mine with an extra-large spatula and it got crunchy on both sides while remaining creamy in the middle. I added rosemary, but I think this recipe is versatile enough to add other spices and/or cheese successfully.

This recipe is awesome! Instead of using Mozzarella cheese, I used Sharp White Cheddar, it held its texture better in my opinion. Also, have to add a bit more flour, I just made the mash and living in a humid climate for the next time.

They were pretty good and nice way  to use left over potatoes. I had 6 cups of left over potatoes so I tripled the recipe. I only used 5 eggs instead of the 6 that were called for to triple. Happy I did. The patties were  very soft and another egg  would have made  the batter too soft to keep formed.. I was super careful flipping them and they did come out looking pretty good. Even though they were crispy, they still tasted like mashed potatoes only in a patty form.  I did add Parmesan cheese and would again.  The video adds cheese, but no mention in the ingredients list on the written recipe. . 
 The recipe does call for cold mashed potatoes and this is helpful. The warmer they got, the for difficult to work with. 
 I would make them again, but will try another recipe or work to improve this a bit.

I like this recipe because you don’t have to go through the hassle of forming and frying patties. This is a much quicker way, especially when little people are complaining they are hungry. I was able to mix the potatoes, throw them in the pan and then leave it while I made eggs, poured juice, etc. This is an excellent base recipe, I read the comments and made the following tweaks: 
-3 tablespoons extra flour (my batter was very wet, everyone might not need as much as I used, I think it depends on the consistency of your mashed potatoes) 
-handful of shredded cheese 
-a few dashes of seasoning salt (no garlic powder in the pantry today and my potatoes weren’t very salty) 
-fried in a combination of oil and butter 

The result was delicious, perfectly crispy on one side, fluffy on the other. Great way to use every last bit of those amazing thanksgiving mashed potatoes. The kids loved it!

Very good base recipe for potato pancakes!  I used about 4 tablespoons of flavored bread crumbs. Teaspoon of garlic powder. Added one cup grated  cheese. Fried in PAM, I don't like oil. VERY good. Hubby said so twice. I might add chicken or turkey or bacon next.

It is what it is, don't expect it to be more than left-over mashed  spiced up and cooked up crispy. That said, it was exactly what I was looking for! I added a dollop of sour cream and a tbsp parmesan cheese. I'll probably reduce eggs to only one next time.  Cooked on a grill on the BBQ next to the chicken made a perfect Monday night meal.

Love this recipe, been making it for many years.  I like to cover mine in salsa after frying.  It’s never bland because I start with a garlic mash.  I’ve added many things depending what I’ve had at hand, it’s a great way to refresh leftovers.  I’ve used everything from red potato w/skins, garlic mashed russets, to white potato....and any other leftovers I can muster.

The texture is different, of course, because its made with  potatoes. So, no syrup needed. My Dad & son both liked it and that always a plus, in my book. ??

Followed recipe to the letter, with my Thanksgiving leftover cold mashed potatoes.  Keep the mixture COLD, as you fry, I made mine into patties, in two batches, second batch I could tell the waiting mixture should have been refrigerated during the first batch frying, a softer, flatter, difficult but possible flip happened with the second batch.  They looked beautiful, tasted awesome, just like "the good old days"...bad for you but SO good!  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a GREAT simple recipe for left over mashed potatoes!
I added 2 eggs, some cheddar/mozz shredded cheese I had on hand (not much) and onion flakes, garlic salt, parley flakes, and a little paprika to add lots of favor. I also needed to add more flour than the recipe calls for in order to bind the cakes.
 I did as one reviewer suggested and rolled them into a ball shape and placed them in the hot oil. Once they were a little crisp I flattened them slightly. Keep the lid on!  They came out SO crispy and delicious!

Love the idea of using leftovers however these were just like fried mashed potatoes. They were ok but next time I would suggest coating the potato pancakes in panko prior to frying them and topping them with cheese or a Crema fresh mixture.

I  tried this recipe and for me it fell very short from what I was expecting. What I got from this recipe was not pancakes but panmush. The mashed potatoes did hold together at all, I could tell when I went to flip them they felt loose and I knew it wasn't working. I followed recipe exactly so not entirely sure what went wrong. I wish I could have give a better review but if it don't work it don't work.

These were delicious with sour cream!  I have made a couple of times and added chopped up leftover vegetables - corn, mushrooms or green pepper.  They don't flip all that well, or at least mine didn't, but they taste so good that who cares if they're a bit of a mess on your plate!

I have always loved potato pancakes and it is such a great way to get rid of old mashed potatoes that may otherwise have gone to waste. 
I feel the maker of the recipe probably kept the spices simple and true to the original recipe, but you can add whatever you like that suites your tastes.
My favorite is to add hot sauce on top of the sour cream and green onion for a zesty kick.
This recipe was simple and did the trick for a great consistency of pancake.

Tasted great & super simple.  I made  six smaller pancakes  with  it. The only things I did wrong was used too much oil and flipped too soon.    They did not look too pretty but it  sure is a recipe I would repeat.  Definitely recommend.

For some reason I listened to others and only added 1 egg. It fell apart. Next time I'll follow recipe as is before making revisions. Rating 4 for flavor.

I'm having a bit of trouble reconciling some peoples issue about the potatoes breaking up etc.  This recipe calls for mashed potatoes, not whipped.  there is a big difference in how you cook  them.  Mashed potatoes are a bit lumpy, they don't have as much liquid.. whipped potatoes have much more liquid and adding eggs adds to that.. you need more flour, best self rising flour.  Also cooking  temperatures change for each, a little bit more heat for a "chunkier" pancake and for whipped a bit less, they should be bit thinner with a bit more oil in the pan. also, whipped potatoes in my house get shaped and popped into a freezer for a good 20 minutes so they hold and keep shape, mashed potatoes dont need that step. As far as bland... well the author mentions she likes chives so she adds chives.  I think you can add whatever you want.  I usually do anyway :) skys the limit :)
this is a great solid recipe.

Loved them and I usually don't like mashed potatoes. I did make a few changes, I used triple the amount of chives, one egg,   added a 1/2 tsp of roasted garlic salt and I used the flour on the outside. One large pancake didn't appeal to me so I made four patties that I rolled in flour. Thanks for the recipe.

Used very finely chopped onion that was chopped in the little food processor/chopper.  This created a juicy finely chopped nice onion that made for a good onion flavor in the potato mixture.  Only used 1 egg and it worked well.  Other than salt and pepper, I didn't put any other seasoning in as I was cooking for other people who don't care for a lot of different seasonings.  In addition to the flour in the mashed potatoes, I scooped out enough to make  a ball a bit smaller than a tennis ball and rolled it in flour, flattened the ball out and patted on more flour before frying.  I was able to get 5 patties out of the potatoes.  They held together fairly well and were well liked!

I used left over mashed potatoes from Christmas dinner, and threw in the left over carrots (chopped) as well.  I was a bit afraid it would be too bland, so I also added some diced purple onion and sprinkled with paprika - and it was positively delicious.  I will definitely be making these again!

We absolutely loved this. It was perfect for all those leftover mashed potatoes from Thanksgiving. I did use 1/4 cup flour and added 1 tablespoon of dried chives. This made for a really firm cake that stayed together and presented beautifully. We topped it with sour cream and they were fantastic. Definitely will be making these again!

This recipe is pretty good as a base.  On their own, they are kind of bland, but with a few spices, they are quite good!  I used onion and garlic, both fresh, and the chives then made them into individual patties as Naples34102 also did.  They remind me of the latkes I make each year, but without all of the work!
I would post a picture but they were gone so quick, I just never got the chance :-)

I had some leftover chopped onion (2 or 3 tablespoons) which I added to the mix as well as some shredded cheddar cheese. I only had one egg so I cut the amount of potato to 1 1/2 cups.  I also added 1 tspn of ground black pepper.  After I added the milk and egg to the potato mix I thought they seemed to runny and I added a couple of tablespoons of rice bran to firm it up. The mixture held together but didn't hold together that well in the pan (I'm guessing because of the missing egg).  However, the taste was great and I'll try it again following the exact recipe when I have allof the ingredients.

Made it as designed. It was a good potato pancake and not at all bland. Assuming you have fresh potato, a good egg and decent butter this was simple  meld of subtle flavor so that was very good.  Even excellent.

Thanks to this recipe, I now have a delicious way of repurposing left over mashed potatoes! I precisely followed the proportions of the ingredients listed in the recipe and the only thing that I changed is that I made individual serving-sized pancakes rather than one skillet-sized one. The pancakes were delicious and presented well, being perfectly beautiful golden brown!

There's some with complaints of it being bland but I started with some tasty garlic cheesy mashed potatos and it was perfect. A little salt and pepper and maybe a dash of thyme didn't hurt either though.

Tried these twice and unfortunately they failed both times.  The pancakes don't hold together for me, even after extending frying... so on trying to flip them, they just fall into mashed potato pieces.  Basically ended up making fried mashed potatoes both times.

A great base recipe! I added some chopped roasted garlic cloves to this with some cayenne, rosemary and fresh cracked pepper. I would then say it was 5star for my tastes. Yum

It's a good and basic recipe, but it is a little bland. I had to double up on the garlic and add a bit more salt to try and cover all of my bases.

I thought these were fine. I made them to use up some leftover potatoes from Easter. My main issue was they did get crispy on the outside but the centers stayed so soft. I think I just prefer potato cakes with the shredded potatoes for that reason. Only thing I did add was a 1/2 cup of sharp cheddar cheese and a sprinkle of garlic salt.

Just made these for dinner with some leftover mashed potatoes. I followed the recipe exactly even though I was skeptical about adding 2 eggs to only 2 cups of mashed potatoes which gave them too much of an eggy taste for me. My mom always made these with only one egg and adding just enough flour to bind. I did like the addition of the garlic powder in this recipe but next time I'll stick with my momma's version.  I topped these with sour cream to hide some of the egg flavor and I enjoyed the combo of the hot potatoes with cold tangy sour cream. Almost like a twice baked potato.

Haven't tried yet, but will.  Looking for something to do with a lot of leftover mashed potatoes.  Can these be frozen for future use?

I added green onions, chopped thin sliced deli ham and shredded sharp cheddar.  

As it cooked, I divided it into quarters and flipped each over to brown on both sides.  It was a little tricky but I got it done.

I will definitely be making this again!

I usually make mashed potato patties with leftover mashed potatoes.  I have never made them like this with egg...  I just would form the patties and fry them in butter or bacon fat, sometimes I would add some Mexican corn flour "Masa Harina" for variety and more firmness.  I usually eat the patties as a snack, sometimes adding ketchup.  These ones sound delicious and with the addition of the eggs will offer more nutrition.  I can hardly wait to try them.  Thank you.

This is a great way to use leftover mashed potatoes. I did use only one egg and @ least 2 tbs. flour. Two eggs would definitely not worked for me, and I did use just a bit more than 2 cups of potatoes. Will make again

Just joined today so glad I did. I found a great recipe for leftover potatoes and my husband loved them! They are going to be a regular at this house! I didn't have scallions on hand put diced onion in mix.

I am a frugal minded person, so this is a great way to use leftover mashed potatoes!. These are great served with steak and eggs (sunnyside up or over easy). You can add additional spices if you desire to change it up a bit. Potato pancakes are a good contrast to hashbrowns for breakfast.

Tasty! and so easy too.  I put garlic in my mashed potatoes to begin with, so I omitted the garlic, but added a small chopped shallot, and didn't bother adding any flour.  Awesome!

Delish ... although I simplified for husband and kids and kicked it up for myself.  Made 2C mashed plus one egg, 1 TBSP flour for them ... then took last portion or two and added diced ham, cheese and onion plus shredded carrot.  A bit sticky but turned out well.  Dolloped onto pan and pressed into a patty with the spatula.  YUM!
