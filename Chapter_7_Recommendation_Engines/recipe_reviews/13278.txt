As written, this soup would have been way too bland for me, but I liked the idea. With the following additions, which included, garlic and onion powders, cumin, chili powder, paprika and low sodium, fat free chicken broth, it was just about perfect. I ran the beans thru my food processor before adding them to the liquid. Good start and thanks!

This soup prompted me to become a member just so I could comment on it! It was simple, delicious, and a great source of fiber! Because I use it in almost all my soups, I added a dash of garlic powder. A bit of carrot or celery might be nice as well. Thanks for a great quick soup!

As suggested I added a bit of onion powder, garlic powder and cumin, as well as the hot sauce.  The soup was easy to prepare and delicious.  Will definitely make again.

I changed this recipe a bit and it tasted great! I made 4x the recipe and froze it in portions to be eaten with future dinner. I used canned white beans instead of pinto beans (that's what I had), I omitted the hot sauce and added some freshly minced garlic and some cumin. Once cooked I pureed the soup with my immersion blender. This soup couldn't be any easier! Just opening up some cans - and no chopping!!!

I did change it quite a bit, but without the original I would have been lost. Amazing soup.

This soup is delicious! I gave it 4 only because I changed it a little.  I double it and to make it simple, used 1 can of pinto beans and 3 cans off garbanzo beans.  I used 4 cups of chicken broth rather than the water and bouillon.  As for seasoning I used 2 tsp of onion powder, 1 tsp chili powder and 1/2 tsp of cumin along with the recommended hot sauce.  It was just enough seasoning to give it a hint of flavour without overwhelming the beans. So quick! Yumm! Thanks so much!

Following Linda Mclean's lead, I added garlic powder, onion powder, and cumin. I didn't add any chili powder because I didn't want it to taste *exactly* like chili "broth." It was okay; I enjoyed it. After tasting, I felt the need to add more hot sauce. At the amount called for in the recipe, I couldn't discern any hot sauce flavor at all. I added another five or six shakes of hot sauce. Spiced up, this is a somewhat tasty (and healthy) recipe. As written, it is somewhat ordinary. Because this is healthy, easy to prepare, and tasty, I will have it again.

Thanks for the idea!  Was looking for a quick, hot and nutritious lunch.  I didn't have the exact beans called for, so used a mix of pinto, navy and great northern.  Tasty!

This soup is really easy and delicious. I do recommend adding the extra seasonings other reviewers have recommended if you like a little kick.

Ok, I am COMPLETELY impressed by this soup! I've had it in my recipe box for ages, and honestly thought it would be bland and require a lot of tweaking. Was I wrong!  It's crazy fast to make and so simple! It's even better the next day. My only complaints: 1) the servings are on the small size (I ate 2 servings for lunch) 2) the ingredient amounts are strange - 1 cup of pinto beans isn't even half a standard can of beans, so you'll have leftovers. The same with the 2 cups of garbanzos, you get  some leftovers. 3) You do not taste the hot pepper sauce, so you may want to use at least 1 tsp.  After making the recipe as is (which was pretty good), I added another 1/2tsp of chicken bouillion, extra hot sauce, 1/2 tsp of garlic powder and some freshly ground pepper. Perfect! I served it with a sprinkle of sumac for a bit of color.  Next time I might even use chicken broth instead of the water and omit the chicken bouillon. Also, to make things easy and prevent leftover beans, I'll just use 1 can of pintos, 2 cans of garbanzos and adjust the seasonings. Thanks for the super simple recipe! This would be tasty with so many different seasonings and is easily customizeable.
