I really liked this. It's been many moons since I've been camping so I made the home version. The recipe was cut back by half and I made the following changes: I finely diced a small onion and  roughly chopped 4 oz. of cremini mushrooms. This combo was cooked in the oil until the onions softened and the mushrooms browned, about 5 minutes. The herbs were then add until fragrant. I garnished the dish with fresh chopped parsley. Thanks for the recipe.

Don't need the pepper unless you like it really hot. The Old Bay has enough heat for me.

Iâ€™ve never been camping, but if I do this will be a terrific recipe! Even without camping this a yummy dish to make. I used a clam product (bar harbor brand) that was just clams, clam juice, and sea salt. This is just a personal preference for me, but I prefer to use butter instead of oil in the sauce mixture; however, I do understand the use of oil when camping.
