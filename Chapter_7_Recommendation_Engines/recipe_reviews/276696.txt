Fabulous tasting soup.  Made it exactly as written.  I am fairly new to the Instant Pot and like every other dish I have tried it took much longer for the pressure to build and also to naturally release.  After over 15 minutes I released the pressure.  Loved the bacon on top.  I added some shredded cheddar cheese and chopped chives as other toppings.  Will definitely make again.

I followed the recipe the only different thing I did was throw the chopped bacon in the pot because I want it within the soup. Now, it had a bitter taste to it and I Donâ€™t know what that taste is. Was it too much of a certain ingredients;  perhaps onion too big , the thyme?  if anybody can tell me please let me know...

This is simple to do and tastes amazing! I doubled the recipe and used a 5lb bag of mini potatoes so it took ages to chop everything but that's the only hard part.

This is my second time making this soup. I didn't have milk this time so I subbed 1/4 cup of sour cream and skipped the cornstarch. It still came out super tasty and I loved the tang from the sour cream.

I didn't make any changes and it is delicious. I wish it was a little bit thicker so I might use more cornstarch next time.

Delicious! My 14 yr old son ate 3 bowls the night I made it - glad I doubled the recipe!
