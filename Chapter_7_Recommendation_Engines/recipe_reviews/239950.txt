These cupcakes are delicious! I made them for a holiday school event and they were a big hit with my class! I think the frosting could maybe use a little less sugar though, it was a bit too sweet. But other than that, they were easy to make and super delicious!

I made this with a spice cake mix (all i had) with an additional dash of cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice, a tad bit of vanilla, and a few addsd tablespoons of sugar. It came out excellent. I frosted with a mixture of canned pumpkin, powdered sugar, butter, cream cheese, vanilla, and spices. these came out so good. This was a great base recipe to play with for me.

These were delightful. I made them for my nieces wedding shower and everyone loved them. I did use a spice cake mix but other than that kept the recipe the same.

I followed the recipe exactly, and was very disappointed.  The cupcakes didn't have the correct consistency, despite the fact that the "toothpick test" came out clean.  As I began to ice each one, the cupcake just fell apart.  Not only that, but the butter cream icing had no flavor.  I was supposed to take them to a dinner party tonight, but now I'll have to think of something else.  :(
