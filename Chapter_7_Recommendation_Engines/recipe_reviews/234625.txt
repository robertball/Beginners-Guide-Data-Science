First of all, these brownies are more like a red velvet/cheesecake swirl brownie than a brownie with cream cheese FROSTING. Anyway, I think they're pretty good, but they aren't perfect. They were done at 30 minutes, and they make a lovely presentation. The cheesecake-style topping is also delicious, and I love the suggestion to reserve a bit of the red velvet batter to make swirling a little bit easier and more successful. However, I think the red velvet layer could use a bit of work...the texture came out a bit "gummy" to me, and I think it could use a little more flavor as well. Otherwise, it's a pretty good recipe...thanks!

These were good and everyone seemed to like them. However, I think perhaps they might be missing something. I haven't quite figured out what that might be yet, but I am working on it. They seemed a touch dry also, but I would really like to experiment a bit and try to make them again.

I already had all the ingredients, because I made red velvet brownies before. However, I couldn't find that recipe so I used this one. My old recipe called for brown sugar and milk, so I did add some and a little extra flour. I didn't do the cream cheese topping. They turned out yummy, but not as good as the other recipe.

My husband loves them. Next time I'll use Pam instead of butter to grease the pan, they were hard to get out.  The recipe doesn't differentiate between ingredients for the brownie and those for the topping, you have to figure it out from the instructions.  I baked mine in my toaster/convection oven so I lowered the temp by 25 degrees.
