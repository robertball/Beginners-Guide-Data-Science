You may be a little put off by the fact that this recipe has only two ingredients. DON'T BE. I've made this recipe about a hundred times and every time it is the hit of the party. It's addictive, and you can't mess it up! I so enjoy answering the question, "How did you make this?" because no one can ever believe how easy it is. Here are two tips: First, instead of white chocolate chips, I use two packages of vanilla candy coating. It's a little sweeter and has this pleasing melt-in-your-mouth quality. And second, after you crush the oreos, put them in a colander to sift off the powdery part of the cookie crumbs. The powder will darken the white chocolate and it won't be as pretty. I wish I could give this recipe 50 stars!

I love Oreo bark, but it is so expensive at the gourmet candy store in our town, so I decided to try this recipe. Perfect! Exactly what they sell! I used Baker's white chocolate and broke the oreos into 4 pieces each. No discoloration either. I did notice that after three days, even in an airtight container, the consistency of the bark (the white chocolate) changed and didn't taste as good- I'm guessing that's the limit unless you freeze it for a later occasion.

I made several batches in the matter of a couple of days, this is a total 5 star recipe. My little neighbor kids called it "Cookies and Creme Candy" and all the kids just went to town. I mean to tell you when they all have their mouths full saying how good it is...and barely understanding them but showing thumbs up and hmm and awws and ohhhs.....it must be really really good. The last batch I did was with mini oreos and let me tell you this, if you don't want to make a huge batch that this recipe calls for...simple trick is 1 package of almond bark and 1 8oz package of Oreo Minis...and follow the recipe. Only note is, you don't have to break up the minis. They are already in bite size pieces. This is a fun recipe. Hands down.

This recipe is great! And so easy. I used the mint and creme oreos and sprinkled the top with red sugar while the mixture was still warm. It's perfect for the holidays (or any other time of year) and tastes fabulous!

This was a great recipe, very easy to make. I used the new Reynolds Release foil instead of wax paper and it worked great.

This was a good recipe, but I found it hard (impossible really) to cut up so I tried breaking it up but that was pretty tough too and I ended up with big chunks instead of smaller bite size pieces.  Make sure to crush the cookie up small enough so you can spread the mixture about 1/4 - 1/2 inch thick.  That should make it easier to break/cut up.

My girls made this recipe without me helping at all.  We ended up making this recipe 3 times during the holiday season.  New note on 12/10/09:  I have been making this for over 10 years now and have tried many different oreo types.  Some change the color, but are still up to our standards.  This year we made them with Trader Joe's peppermint oreos...OMG they are the best we have ever made.  Just enough peppermint without changing the color!!

Delicious, and dead easy.  You can make it while half asleep!  (Speaking from experience here, given my Christmas cooking marathons.)

Don't crush up cookies too fine, though, or the overall colour will be a little weird.

Incredibly simple and very addictive. I had to hide it so I wouldn't eat more than one piece, seeing as it's a gift for someone else. I think I might try this with vanilla bark and see if it tastes as good.

I didn't follow this recipe at all-just melted hunks of white chocolate and mixed in oreo---I didn't crush them as much and the bark appears "whiter" but its delicious and easy.

This was great!  We made it for Thanksgiving and we had relatives request the recipe on the spot!  It makes a lot, it's easy to make, and I can make it and still use the oven for something else.  This will definately be on my cookie trays this holiday season!  Thanks for such and easy, great tasting recipe.

Five stars for simplicity and winning flavor. I cut the ingredients in half and spread it in an 11"X7" pan. The microwave was perfect for melting the  white chocolate. Only took about a minute and a half (stirred after the first minute, then again at 30 seconds) to get it perfectly smooth and prepped to have the Oreo quarters folded in. BTW, place your quartered or chopped Oreos in a sieve and shake to remove any crumbs, thereby preventing a gray-colored finished product that can happen when the fine crumbs that result from breaking up the Oreos get mixed in. I popped it in the fridge for about 45 minutes and that was all it took. No problem cutting it into pieces with a chef's knife. My son, who absolutely adores white fudge covered Oreos, went CRAZY for this.

HUGE hit at a cookie exchange I went to.... Word of advice though, I didn't have wax paper or foil so skipped it and just greased the pan... bad Idea. It was impossible to get out of the pan. I only ended up with about half because the other half got too crumbled from me trying to scrape it out. Delicious though, and next time I'll use the wax paper.

This worked great for me. I needed a quick treat for game around Halloween. I kept reading the comments about how sweet the bark was. So I added some crushed pretzels along with Reese's peices and candy corn to my bark. It was a perfect combo of sweet and salty!! Plus the bark was very Halloween-ish, check out my pic! I had to stop eating it so I would have enough left for the party! The guys at the party kept saying how great it was...some of what they said is not AR appropriate, haha. It was THAT good!

5 stars for simplicity! I used one 24 oz. pkg of almond bark and one 8 oz. pkg of mini-Oreos. It could not have been easier to melt the bark in the microwave. After melted, I just dumped in the Oreos, stirred it together and spread it out on a smaller cookie sheet lined w/ parchment paper. Stuck it in the fridge for about an hour. Started out trying to cut it into neat squares, but that was a pain. Ended up just breaking it into very individual looking pieces...gives it character! This was a little messy...cracking and breaking everywhere. DDs just tried it...Oldest one: "That's good!"...younger one: "Is that for US??!!" as she was rubbing her hands together and bouncing up and down...LOL! Act like they never have sweets!

Two of my mothers favorite things in this world are dark chocolate and double stuff oreos so thats what I used in this cookie bark to give for her for Easter.  It was SO good.  I used high quality dark chocolate, which I think is important in this recipe (if youre giving it as a gift or serving it to others for an occasion) considering all youre doing is melting it into bark.  I wouldnt use semisweet or baking chocolate.. so yes, its expensive to make since you use up a pack of oreos and lot of nice chocolate but you'll make someone so happy! I also melted some white chocolate, added food coloring and drizzled it on top to decorate - in pink and yellow for easter.  One more thing.. it you break the oreos into big chunks it gives it a nice crunch.
This recipe has endless variations considering all the different types of both chocolate and oreos out there. I will definitely be making this again.

I must admit that if I rated this recipe based on my own taste, I would give it just 3 stars.  BUT...I brought these to work and everyone raved about them.  They were gone from the table before lunch.

These were great. Everyone thought they tasted just like the cookies and cream candy bar. I used foil for the bottom. Then I used a knock of brand of oreos and 2 packages of vanilla coating. I used a different method though. Break off half of the carton of oreos and place in pan. Melt half of vanilla coating and spread on top. Then melt other half of coating and spread evenly and sink the rest of the broken cookies on top. This worked way better and didn't make the vanilla coating black! I will use a 9x13 pan next time to make it thicker and better.

Good porportion of chocolate to cookies, and yes with just these two ingredients you really do get a 5-star candy masterpiece. For my preference I chop the cookies coarsely, about 6-8 pieces per oreo cookie. My favorite version of this is to add peppermint extract (to taste, ~1 tsp total) and green food coloring to the chocolate before mixing: I renamed it "Blizzard Bark" because it looks and tastes like my favorite Mint Oreo Blizzard from Dairy Queen. Thanks so much for submitting :)

I took another cook's advice and used the Mint Oreo's.  I used Ghirardelli 60% Cacao Bittersweet Chocolate chips and everyone is asking for the recipe.  This is a keeper.  I'll try the original way next.  A tip:  if you are melting the chips in the microwave in a glass bowl spray a little Pam on a piece of wax paper and swoosh around the inside of the bowl.  Far less chocolate will stick to the bowl.

This is NOT a low carb recipe!  I can have a thimble full of anything and have less than 10 carbs.  Just because it is a miniscule portion doesn't mean that it is low carb.  I wouldn't even give this one star for low carb, except there is not option for less.

These were so easy to make…I used gingerbread oreos and semi sweet chocolate and topped them with vanilla flavoured baking chips… These were the first to go from the tray of treats I brought to work… I wouldn't hesitate to make these again with different variations of cookie and chocolate.  Very sweet!

This recipe was so easy to make and the baking time of it took me about 15 minutes tops! This is definitely a keeper. Being it is Christmas time I used the peppermint ones for red coloring and the mint ones for the green coloring! I also used tollhouse white chocolate chips.

I gave it 5 stars for the simplicity of ingredients and steps. It is so easy to make and sets up extremely quick!  I used one package of Oreo cookies, one 24 oz package of almond candy (white chocolate), crushed up cookies, stirred into melted chocolate and poured onto aluminum foil lined baking sheet. Within 25 minutes I was able to break off a piece and taste test - it is delicious!   This treat is VERY sweet and VERY simple!

This is a great recipe that you can customize however you like!  I like using one bag of semisweet chips and one bag of the white chips.  Once the white chips are melted, I add about 3/4 cup (maybe more or less, I never measure) of peanut butter and mix it until it's totally blended with the white chocolate.  Then I add my crushed cookies, scatter-drop the white mixture on my wax lined cookie sheet, then I fill in the gaps with the semisweet mixture.  I use a spatula to swirl the two flavors together.   The peanut butter really adds a nice flavor to the white chocolate.

I have been making this for several years and people are always amazed at how simple the recipe is.  I am always asked for the recipe by at least one person each time I make it.  I have to laugh at the other reviewers - you SIFT your cookies?  LOL!  Yes, it may turn gray if you don't, but once it cools and you break it into chunks, it's still pretty.  And, it's still YUMMY!  I put my cookies into a large ziploc bag and crush with my hands to save time.

This wasn't my favorite but I made it (and other candies) for a holiday exchange and everyone loved it.  The family also loved it at the holidays.  I gave it the 5 stars based on their reviews.  It is VERY simple and easy, plus with 2 ingredients, who can go wrong!  One note, I use either Ghirardelli candy coating or almond bark instead of white chocolate pieces.  I feel the quality is better than the baking chips.

Easy recipes with great results but I changed mine up. First I broke up oreos and pretzel sticks and laid them on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper. Melted 1-2 lbs of Wilton Vanilla Candy melts and poured over my Oreo/pretzel mix. Then sprinkled red, white & blue M & M's and 4th of July cupcake sprinkles over the top. Let it harden up, broke them in pieces and put in bags tied with sparkly 4th of July ribbon! SO cute! I will be making the same concoction at Halloween and christmas only changing the color theme!

This is so addicting!  I used part vanilla candy coating (AKA almond bark) and part white chocolate chips.  Mine wouldn't cut nicely, so I just broke it up into pieces with my hands.  Thanks!

This was wonderful! As stated by other reviewers, make sure you use a colander to sift oreos before folding them with the white chocolate. I also added crushed peppermint to half my bark which tasted great! This recipe is really simple and delicious.

This was fantastic, very addicting, and a hit at a recent party.  It makes quite a bit (mmmm...leftovers only because it was a small party with other desserts  :) ).  I froze some of the leftovers and they tasted great later.

Absolutely addicting!  I used three 11oz. bags of Ghiradelli white chocolate chips.  I didn't use quite an entire package of Oreo cookies.  I think it would have been easier to melt the chocolate in a double boiler as opposed to using the microwave.  The double boiler melts it more evenly and the chocolate is smoother and easier to spread.  It is very easy to make and even easier to eat! ;)

Super easy to make and my boyfriend had fun crunching up the oreos-though I had him do that in a large gallon zip bag instead of his hands. But easy to put together and everyone loved them! 
thanks for the recipe!

Very tasty and not difficult at all. Followed recipe and directions to a tee, I did add about 1/4 cup Valentine plain M & M's with cookie pieces.  I would think you could really play around with cookies and candies to customize this to your tastes or holiday.  A little piece goes a long way as it is very rich tasting.  I followed other's advice and broke the cookies up by hand carefully in fairly large pieces and had no trouble with lots of crumbs in the chocolate making it look "dirty".  The easiest way would be to use mini Oreos. My grown son loved this treat!

This is a naughty, naughty candy. I couldn't stop eating it! Everyone told me I should be a professional candy maker, I didn't tell them it was only 2 ingredients! I used almond bark and christmas oreos with red filling. They came out beautiful. So easy, too! This is a must try.

Yum!  This recipe was delicious.  I will be bringing it to a holiday party and I am sure it will be a hit.  It does turn a kind of off color as previous reviewers mentioned so I will try sifting next time.  Thanks for a quick and super easy recipe!

An excellent recipe.  We melted all the chips in a double boiler on the stove.  Our preference was also to break up the cookies with our fingers.  We just liked the size pieces we had that way.  There is no need to spray the waxed paper before putting the candy on it.  It broke up into delicious bite sized pieces which all our friends are going to love.  SO EASY TO MAKE!

I just finished making these for gifts!  Very easy to make!  I just used a regular cookie sheet as opposed to a jelly roll sheet and it was fine.  I also sifted the oreos like a previous reviewer suggested.  My husband just had a taste and said it was excellent and wanted to know if I made extra for him!  I can't wait to give these out!

Quick and Easy!!!  My 18 year old son loved it. I made goodies bags for the girls at work and they all enjoyed their treat.  It was a little sweet for some, but you can never please everyone.  I used two 12 oz bags of the white/vanilla flavored Candy Melts and one bag of Oreo mini's.  I spread half the melted mixture into the pan, placed a layer using half of the mini cookies evenly spaced, covered with the rest of the melted mixture, and topped with the remaining cookies in the open spaces.  I also sprinkled the crumbs only on the top for texture and color.  It came out perfect and did not look "dirty" like some other reviewers described.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  I will definitely make it again.

This was a huge hit at my party! Everyone loved it and couldn't stop eating it. My boyfriend does not  typically like white chocolate, but he told me to make more just for him. I wish I had more occasions to make this more often, as I would eat the whole pan myself!

Made this for a Thanksgiving get-together with family and everyone loved it. My husband said it's better than Hershey's Cookies and Cream candy bars. Don't crush the cookies too much or else you get more powder and not as much cookie. Super easy to make and a crowd pleaser. Thanks for sharing!

Yummy - kids loved it, but it is very sweet.  I couldn't quite cut into nice shapes, so it turned out rather jagged looking.  Good thing my kids don't care what things look like.

I can not get enough of this. My whole family loves it, but I think I will have to make much more because I want it all for myself! Super easy, my four year old made it himself! (With Mom's supervision)

Made these for a pre-Thanksgiving party.  They were a huge hit with both adults and kids.  I will be adding to my holiday candy making list.  I used white bark instead of the chips, easier to melt and work with.

I took the advice of another & used the vanilla flavored candy coating.  It turned out delicious.  I think a 1/2 batch spread out in a jellyroll pan would've worked, too (I like my bark a little on the thinner side).  Very easy, very good.

Very simple, very sweet. I love it, it tastes like Hershey's Cookies and Cream bars. I broke the Oreos into quarters, and crumbled up the excess cookies on the top of it before it set.

This was a huge hit at my family's Christmas celebration this year! I took other cooks' advice and was careful to spread it as thin as possble and that made it easy to break. I made 2 batches and bagged it up as stocking stuffers, and we're munching on the leftovers. This will go on my make-again list!

Awesome. Sooooo easy. Everyone LOVED it!!! I sifted the Oreo crumbs. I don't know if it made much of a difference in color, but I used the crumbs as a coating on top and I really liked it like that. It made it so the white chocolate wasn't as overpowering. It doesn't really matter, though. This is delicious if you follow it exactly or alter it. Seroiusly, it has been a HUGE HIT at every holiday party I've been to this year!

This was very easy to make and tasty too. It was pretty difficult to break up, so I had to use a knife. But that didn't really bother me. The only problem I had with this recipe is that the finished product was almost too rich if you ate more than one piece. However, the only reason I know that is because I ate a bunch of it at once because it was so good. But otherwise it was fantastic.

I made this with the Christmas Oreos.  Green has a mint flavor and I put it with semi-sweet chips, and the red looks nice with white chocolate.  Krogers makes good red and green oreo cookies in December.

OMG so good and sooo easy. no one belived that there were only 2 ingredients!! I melted a whole bag of Ghiridelli white chocolate chips in the microwave and broke the Banana Split Oreos(limited edition)into quarters..so easy to just dump the melted chocolate onto the oreos and refrigerate. I blew my diet for the day and ended up eating this for breakfast and lunch. Yummy!! A new, awesome addition to my cookie reportroire!!

I make this a little differently. Melt one Bakers box of white chocolate and when melted stir in a heaping tablespoon of peanut butter until melted. Melt on box of Bakers semi sweet chocolate and add crushed oreos to the melted chcocolate. Line a cookie sheet with wax paper and alternate the white and brown chocolate. One all chocolate is on the cookie sheet, take a butter knife or spoon and swirl the two chocolate mixtures together who it has a marbeled look. I get TONS of compliments and attention from this treat, people are amazed.

may be it was due to the not using the absolute best ingredients in the market, may be it was due to the fact that i am not a cookie fan,but it didn't like this recipes.. i would advise people who dont like cookies to not go for it as thats what you will get..extremely sweet tasting cookies....

I had already made marble cookie bark for Christmas, but saw this recipe and decided to try it since I had leftover white chocolate and mint flavored oreos.  Very good and oh so easy. At Christmas time Nabisco makes Oreos with red or green filling.  That would add nice color..wish I had some.

I make a version of this: I melt a pot of white chocolate and mix in regular oreo cookie pieces and a pot of semi-sweet chocolate and mix in golden, or vanilla, oreo cookie pieces.  Then I alternate spoonfulls of each onto the wax paper and swirl with a knife.  Very tasty and always a hit.  Stick it in the freezer for quicker cooling time.

If there is any way to screw up a candy recipe, rest assured I can find a way!!! HOWEVER, this recipe is awesome and not even me could screw it up!!!!!! I took the advice of another poster and used Oreo Mint Cookies and topped with red sugar--they look so festive, I can't wait to take them to my cookie/candy exchange tomorrow--I am sure no on will believe that I made this!!! What's even MORE amazing than it being easy (only 2 ingredients) quick and pretty--it TASTES good!!! Imagine!!!  Thanks so much for this recipe--I will be making it again soon!!!

So easy, and so yummy!  I used almond bark and halloween oreos for a fall theme, so the candy coating turned orange.  I also sifted the cookies as well, so it looked "neater".  I'm going to try it with peanuts to get that sweet&salty taste~thanks for the EASY recipe!

as my name states, i'm a picky cook.  as another member states, dont be put off by the lack of ingredients - try this one.  it's phenomenal.  i'm using it as well for holiday gifts.  use the wooden spoon to break up, sift off crumbs and you'll come out with, guaranteed, beautiful bark.  tastes like white chocolate covered oreos.  i used ghittards white chocolate chips and it was amazing.  thanks!

Yummy, easy and pretty, but a little expensive. I made mine like the pic and sprinkled with red and green sugar to go with my Christmas tins. I don't mind the crumbs mixed in, it looks just like cookies and cream should look.

I found that using the advice in the recipe, crumbling the cookies with the back of a wooden spoon works the best.  I used Reduced Fat Oreo Cookies and it was just as good!

This recipe is so easy and always a hit! I agree with other users in sifting the Oreos first. The crumbs do turn the white chocolate a brown-ish color. Also, make sure to use the clear, vegetable non-stick spray as instructed. I have mistakenly used a spray with a yellow tint and it is very difficult to remove from the bark! :)

Made this recipe using two and a half bags of Meijer-brand vanilla baking chips and a 15 oz bag of oreos. Turned out truly delightful! Also tried the recipe with cool mint and the family loved it. A lovely treat for the family, or for a gift! Will definitely be making again. My only tip is that if you crush about 2/3 of the cookies and separate the other 1/3 into chunks it is easier to work with. First time making it I crushed half and cracked the other half and it was a bit hard to deal with. Delicious recipe! :).

I can't believe how well this went over with my office.  Several people begged me for the recipe.  It takes 5 minutes to throw together and turns out beautifully.  Just make sure you don't make the batch too thick or it will never break!

It was delicious, but I think that using the mini oreos and maybe a little less chocolate would have been a good idea because it was very thick and hard to break apart.

This recipe was outrageously easy and the end result was fabulous!  I used a box of Trader Joe's Peppermint Jo-Jo's with white chocolate chips and put red sugar sprinkles on top to be festive for the holidays.  Everyone loved them and I've referred a bunch of people to this site.  Even the guy who said he prides himself on his peppermint bark made a point of finding me to say "This is brilliant!"  My kids are looking forward to trying lots of variations, starting with peanut butter cookies and chocolate chips.Thanks for sharing the recipe.  It's a definite keeper.

Way to sweet (and I like sweet).  The presentation was not very appealing either.  I could have found a better way to use my white chocolate and my mini oreos (maybe I should have use the large oreos for a better taste & presentation).

Kids love this very sweet candy - a Christmas tradition.  We use three bags of Ghirardelli 11 oz white chocolate and one 8 oz bag of mini Oreos.  To keep the white as white as possible, I suggest first put Oreos in colander to get rid of little crumbs, then mix 1.5 bags of melted white chocolate with all of the Oreos.  Then spread into 9x13 pan (not jelly roll).  Melt the remaining white chocolate chips and spread on top of the previous mixture.

Delicious! Simple tip... buy the MINI Oreo cookies! You don't have to crush them up that way and the color stays white! I have done both white chocolate chips and vanilla candy coating, I also have used mint oreo cookies and tinted the chocolate light green. YUMMY!

Yum! I made half the size because I only had one bag of white chocolate chips, but I wish I could make more! I bought the generic Oreo-type cookies, and it came out fine. I bought the mint flavored one so it would look festive. Used other reviewers' advice and sifted out the crumbs before mixing in. Be careful not to overheat the white chocolate in the microwave... I had quite the disaster... but overall, cute & delicious holiday presents!

WOW!!  I used red filled oreos, which turned the chocolate pink.  I also used a colonder to get the small crumbs out of the oreos and then used those as a dusting on top.  So pretty, sooo good!  Thanks for the idea!

This is a winner. I made these for my co-workers and they devoured them like a bunch of giddy 5-yr. olds. Adults and children love this recipe. I tweeked mine a bit by adding a touch of McNess Peppermint Extract to the white chocolate after it melted. 1 tsp? maybe. Be careful a little goes a long way. I placed the Oreos in a big Zip Lock bag, pressed out any excess air, sealed it, and went to town with my rolling pin crushing them.

I don't normally like to bake, but this yummy recipe requires no baking at all!  Crumble the cookies, melt the Ghiradelli white chocolate bars in the microwave, combine and mix. I also sifted the crumbled cookies to get rid of some of the crumbs, but my white chocolate still came out with specks of Oreo crumbs - - it's inevitable, people!   Trust me, it was still delicious.  So easy.  Even non dessert people can make this recipe.

This was fantastic!  Last year I made this as well as a few other barks for holiday gift bags.  This one is quite addictive.  The recipe couldn't be easier.  Make sure you use chunks of cookie and NOT crumbs or it will not look very pretty.  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is super easy and everyone loves it! Who doesn't love Oreos??
My only issue is with the measurements - I had to tweak it a bit to make it work for me. When I followed the recipe exactly I basically got broken up Oreo pieces with a very thin layering of white chocolate holding them together. I was looking for a more prominent chocolate to Oreo ratio.
A 20 oz package of Oreos is one of the big family pack of cookies with 4 rows. It turned out really well for me when I did 2.5 rows of cookies with 20 oz of white chocolate. (Less cookies, more chocolate).
Will make again!

Super easy and so good! I always make this at Christmas time and use dark chocolate mint wafers and candy cane Oreos. I just melt both bags of chocolate and add all the Oreos rather than making two batches as the recipe states.  It is pretty thick but Still covers the entire pan. I break it up into bite size pieces and it always disappears!

fantastically easy and great to make last minute-the only change I made was to use mini Oreos so I wouldn't have a mess from the reg. size cookies.

Yummy! I made it with mini peanut butter oreos. The mini oreos were nice because I didn't have to break them up. Next time I think I'll do mint oreos.

It's sheer simplicity. and who doesn't like Oreos?  I only had a small sample before packaging it all up for gifts, but it was really tasty, and oh so quick to prepare.  Very easy.  I did spread it thin and there were some holes, but it broke into pieces easily.   (Just got feedback from the recipients--this one's a winner!)

Easy to make and it's soo good!  These were everyone's favorite cookies from my cookie tray.  I had also made half to bring to my second party and the host had saved some and put to the side for safe keeping.  What I did differently to the bark was to make them into cups by placing the cupcake pan with liners then filled it up to a quarter.  The 2nd time I made them, I lessen the Oreos so that the cookies didn't stick out as much.   Dropped using a tablespoon then manipulating it to even it out with a chop stick.

Great concept. very good as you would imagine since it's oreo's and white chocolate. Cut my recipe in half. Used one package of vanilla flavored almond bark. melted in microwave for about 2 min total. broke one 14.5oz package of oreo's with my hands. folded the 2 together, spread over a small baking sheet greased and lined with wax paper. 45 min later it was done. Great idea for parties.

I made this at Christmas time but forgot to review the recipe.  AWESOME!  This is so simple and so delicious.  I made a batch, broke it into chunks (impossible to cut it.  I just smashed it with a knife) and added the pieces into my cookie boxes.  Everyone raved over this and it was embarrassingly easy to make.

So good! I am tempted to never make it again, however, since I just couldn't stop eating it! I also made a batch using mint Oreos and semi-sweet chips. It was equally delicious.

This is the easiest recipe I've ever made!  I've made this for a few different parties and everyone LOVES it - it is very good with the mint oreos and the regular oreos.  I just saw a different version of this where peanut butter was added to the chocolate - might have to try that.  The recipe as is is fantastic - would be good to give as gifts.

Superb! Super easy and super yummy. I botched the first half by making the oreo pieces too small and overheating the white chocolate, but my second batch was perfect. Everyone thought it was amazing! I will definitely make this again.

Turned out good.  I used double stuff oreos- not necessary the next time.  Looking forward to experimenting with different flavors of oreos next time.  I sifted my crushed oreos and they still turned the bark a darker color.

This was very good!  My husband and I don't really care for white chocolate, and we still liked it!  It is very rich.  Also very easy!  This would make a great gift.

Although it was very pretty sitting on the table, this Oreo bark was waaaaaay to sweet, even for a sweet tooth like me. My kids gobbled it in 2 days, but for two days straight they were on a very high level sugar rush... I couldn't eat more then one piece during the same amount of time... Try only if you like excessively sweet deserts.

This is very delicious, but quite difficult to make (I don't know if I did something wrong but...). I had to melt the chocolate in a saucepan because the microwave took too long and then in the sauce pan I had to add touches of vegetable oil so that the chips would melt willingly. Even though it was difficult to create; It is very good and I have to give out the recipe so many times! All in all very good, but will try to prep it easier next time! Merci beaucoup, pour une recette fantastique!

I just made a batch and it is good, not out of this world.  I cut the Oreos on a cutting board and shook off the excess crumbs.  I felt that the proportions were off and didn't use all the chopped cookies.  The consistancy was good when done.  I will be taking along with my lemon bark to an annual picnic we attend.

I made this using white chocolate morsels. 

I broke the Oreo's into fourths by hand and it turned out great. Very quick and easy to make. 

Will make again!

It tasted pretty good, but even when I sifted the crumbs, the bark turned quite gray.  So it tastes good, but doesn't look too appealing.  Probably a recipe I will make again to eat at home, but not to take to parties.

Everyone loved these.  They were super easy to make.  To crush the oreos, I put them in a zip lock back and pounded them with my meat hammer.  The key is to get them into small pieces but not tiny crumbs.  

I only had a short time to prepare this and fortunately, it set in the refrigerator really fast.

This was pretty good! I'm not a huge fan of white chocolate, so I did half the cookies with semisweet chocolate and it was the biggest hit in our family. Next time I think I'll use all chocolate instead of white!

Delicious!!!  If you love Oreo cookies and white chocolate, this is the treat for you.  Perfect for a quick dessert.  Very easy to make.  Make sure you add a little more white chocolate because it can get to chunky.  I used three packages of white chocolate from Ghirardelli.  This is an awesome recipe for the holidays because you can use the Oreos with the orange or chocolate filling   for Halloween or Thanksgiving, as well as the Oreos with the red filling for Christmas, New Years, or even Valentine's Day.

Super easy to make, thought the white chocolate can get a little expensive. I've gotten lots of compliments on this one in my Christmas treat basket, the people who like it are addicted. I cut my oreos in quarters and carefully fold in so that the white chocolate doesn't get that "dirty" look. This one's a keeper.

Used white chocolate candy wafers (Merkins) and the normal Oreos and they taste and look great. A little sweet because of the white chocolate. I think next time I would use milk or dark chocolate to help cut down on the sweetness. Definitely cut in small pieces because of the richness and sweetness. Would make again.

So so easy to make.  Taste like fancy store candy.  I like to add MnMs.

Super easy & delicious! We are not big  fans of white chocolate but we could not stop eating it! I didn't spray the wax paper & it still came off.

Make sure to use only large pieces of cookies or you will wind up with the ugliest gray candy you can imagine, as I did.  I thought the taste was only okay.

So easy and it tastes like cookies and cream. I made this to put in a "goody" tin during Christmas along with another recipe off this site, and it was a big hit. I will be adding this to my list of Christmas baking.
