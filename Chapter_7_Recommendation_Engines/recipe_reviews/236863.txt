We have been grilling Romaine since forever. It is absolutely amazing. We have just always made it with kosher salt and olive oil, but now cannot wait to try it this way. Don't let warm lettuce throw you off. Once you try grilled Romaine, I bet that you will make it all the time.

Been doing this forever, too.  The first time my son had some, he had THREE!
Other than leaving out the sherry and adding SEA SALT (very necessary, imho!), this is exactly how we do it.
It can be done under the broiler if you don't want the hassle of the grill.

Awesome recipe!  Made it twice yesterday, with a few changes; 
took the advise of another reviewer and made it in my oven's broiler setting. 7 inches from the heat source. Only brushed garlic infused olive oil, garlic power, garlic salt & black course pepper.  Took 5 min. once out sprinkled with crumbled blue cheese & OMG turned out great. Next time will drizzle it with a bit of lemon juice or balsamic before sprinkling it blue cheese. Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful recipe with us all.

I will be making this all summer long! Had it last week at a restaurant with goat cheese so I used that instead of parm.  Do try, you will not be disappointed!

I'm sure my technique will get better.  Grilling the Romaine makes it seem a bit less like a salad, since I'm getting a bit tired of them.  I like the vinaigrette drizzled on before serving, but I left off the cheese.  DH loves Parmesan, so I'll be sure to add it when I make this for him.

No changes. Grilled over hardwood lump charcoal. Topped with fresh grated parm. This recipe is amazing. You can have the rest of your meal done and toss these on the grill for Two minutes. Stand over them... the Olive oil spills onto the coals and flares up, so keep them moving. I also finished with fresh cracked pepper and a small pinch of Kosher salt.

This will be my new favourite “salad”!  We loved it!  I had another side of grilled veggies that had been marinating in a mixture of balsamic vinegar and a few herbs/spices so I used the rest of the marinade to drizzle on the romaine after grilling it.  I might grill cherry tomatoes next time to also use to top off the romaine.

I thought we were grilling on charcoal tonight but instead I tried this on the George grill. It was ok. It was a mix of crunchy and soft lettuce. I highly recommend good cheese, not Kraft shaker bottle. My husband thought it was weird eating warm lettuce. I will try this again on the real grill the next time to really judge this recipe.

I am always looking for new ways to serve lettuce and this is a good one.  I put this on the grill during the last two minutes of cooking my cod with spinach and tomatoes in a foil packet.  It turned out great and my wife loved it. This will be a regular for us during grilling season.

A simple easy salad of sorts! I also added dried spices because of lack of time, but fresh spices would work very nicely.

This is restaurant quality food. It may even be better than that you get in a restaurant because it is not all "junked up" with surprise ingredients that really don't add anything to the dish. I love the simplicity of this recipe. Goes great with grilled meats, fish, etc.

Grilled Romaine is one of our favorite summer side dishes.  In fact, we have it about once a week.  Chef John's simple version is delicious and right to the point. A little oil, a little vinegar and freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese to finish the salad.  Scrumptious!
