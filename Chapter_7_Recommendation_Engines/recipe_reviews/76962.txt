The end result was very tasty but the method was way over complicated! I softened a finely diced onion (couldn't find pearl onions) in a pan whilst the milk mixture was heating in the microwave. I added the butter & flour to the onions added the milk and cooked till just starting to thicken. I then added some frozen green beans and simmered for 10 mins until the beans were cooked and sauce thick. Didn't use 1/4 cup of mustard as I thought that was excessive. How much mustard you need will depend on the brand you use & personal taste preference.

I made this last year for Thanksgiving and it got rave reviews. I used fresh green beans instead of frozen and thinly sliced Vidalia onions instead of pearl onions. Everyone loved it and I will definatley make this again.

Great taste. I made it as a condiment for pasta and it worked out great. I also added carrots because I didn't have enough beans.

This turned out much better than I expected. The only thing I recommend is to stick with the 2 lbs of green beans (if possible) otherwise there's just too much sauce and it ends up overpowering the dish.

I steamed the fresh green beans in the microwave for 2 min 15 seconds so they were crisp and vibrant green. I didn t want the mustard cream sauce to overwhelm the freshness of the green beans so I ended up drizzling the sauce on the top which is the way I will do it in the future as well. I do have some dijon mustard cream sauce left over because drizzling doesn t take as much. That s OK it went into the fridge and will be warmed up and served over a poached egg for breakfast tomorrow. The dijon flavor in the sauce is subtle and mild and it allows the flavor of the vegetables to shine through. Very nice side dish with good presentation.

Yummy! A very nice change from the standard green bean casserole.
