Wow!  A fantastic combination of flavors and packed full of nutrition.  For people like myself who are involved with strength training, double up to 2 cans of tuna for that extra protein!  Great recipe!

I give it 4 stars bc it's good, but needs a bit more flavor. It's an easy recipe. I made it for dinner and it was ready in a cinch! :)

Perfect.  The Spaniards that I had the audacity to cook Spanish food for were delighted, too.

Fantastic combination of flavours. I love the flavour of cilantro so chopped up a few sprigs and added those in. Also added a finely chopped chilly as a personal preference. Used this salad as a filling for a toasted sandwich on Whole Wheat Bread with a few lettuce leaves and some salted potato chips for some crunch. The preparation for this recipe was very simple and the result was a simply delicious lunch.

A delicious change from the American potato salad! I didn't change a thing about it. This makes a TON, but it keeps well in the fridge. Thanks for this one!

This did not go over big with my family it was just to dry.  I rated it a 4 because I'm sure its just a matter of preference.  I had to add mayo before my family would eat this

I love this. My mom makes something similar but she's always done it with pan fried grouper or cod. I don't have time for that so I love that this one has canned tuna! It's an excellent recipe. Thank you!

I took this to the Church picnic, and a lot of people liked it.  Instead of the tuna (disagrees with self), I used pink salmon.  All turned out well.

Great flavor-   I used dried/salted codfish (soaked and rinse) boiled with potatoes-  refrigerate overnight for better flavor,  add olive oil after refrigeration to keep it moist,

This is a good idea and a great base recipe, but is extremely bland.

I am a mayo-lover at heart, but try to not eat it at every meal, so made this salad. I like it, but it needs something more for me. I'm resisting mayo (as I made "Kidney bean salad" too, which has plenty) so I'll try adding zesty Italian to this before glopping it up...I'm going to add another small can of tuna, too - not fishy enough for me! Thanks for posting, AZAHAR, as I love every ingredient in this & will make it often (with my little tweaks).

Definitely fun to try a new recipe.  Should have read the footnote: dont add the tomatoes until right before serving so it doesn't end up mealy.  Good to know, especially if chilling overnight, etc.
