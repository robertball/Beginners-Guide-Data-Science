This marzipan had an okay taste.  In my opinion, I would leave out the added almond extract. It gives it far too much of an almond taste ! It was hard to make it the right texture without adding too much powdered sugar, so I think I would leave out one egg white next time ! The recipe wasn't very clear on how to store the marzipan after coloring.  I shaped mine into fruits, and colored them, but it never really got hard on the outside like the ones you buy in candy stores. I am still searching for the perfect recipe.

for my high school German class, we are having a Valentine's party and i am "trying" this recipe... unfortunatly, since you specified that one was not to creat an "almond butter" i was hesitant with my grinding of the almonds and i believe that has contributed to the gooey mess i have. i have just check other marzipan recipes and they talk about almond paste which i assume is what almond butter meant. additionally, i am trying to add tiny amounts of powdered sugar and flour to add some structure to my marzipan... but to no avail. ALL FUTURE USERS OF THIS RECIPE BEWARE!

This is a very good starting point but there is no way that marzipan could be made with these proportions (Maybe i have HUGE eggs).  I had to add almost a whole additional bag of powdered sugar but the results were heavenly.  Perfect for shaping and coloring (I made fruit for a German competition).  For my needs this recipe worked because i had an extra bag of powdered sugar on hand.  This recipe is what you need if you're a newbie like me and have never made it before, just add more powdered sugar until the consistency is to your liking.

Did not turn out anything like marzipan. Just a big glob of gooey mess that tasted like almonds.
