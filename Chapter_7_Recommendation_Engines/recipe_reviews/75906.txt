***UPDATE***
Chili sauce is like ketchup (NOT spicy thai chile sauce) - I always find it with the ketchup, usually on the top shelf and there is typically only one or two kinds (heinz and store brand) - it tastes like ketchup but is a little thicker - hope you have better luck with it this way!  I can imagine that with taco sauce it would give it a totally different flavor (and texture, as taco sauce isn't as thick :))
I don't feel like I can give this a star rating because I submitted the recipe - but I think it's delicious, and allrecipes makes you give a rating, so 5 stars :)  I usually add a little bit of minced garlic to the mix, as well, and extra chili sauce (it tends to fall apart with too much, though, so watch out :)).  The chili sauce is good even with just beef (or even ground turkey) if you don't have sausage.  Be careful not to overcook, though, because the meat will stay red due to the sauce.  Use a meat thermometer if you want to make sure it's done, or just grill as you would any other burger.

Wow - I loved this recipe!  It satisfied everyone - from the big meat eaters to the people who aren't even big on red meat.  I made this for a family BBQ becuase I wanted something different than just a hamburger.  I used ground italian TURKEY sausage instead of regular and it worked great.  With the help of the Chili Sauce, the burgers were unbelievably moist and I got rave reviews.  Thanks for the recipe - I will make this again and again!

Yummy!  It was hard for me to want to put any other condiments on the burger!  My advice would be to double the recipe!  Everyone may want two!

Made this last night, husband wants it again this week.  I already had plain sausage on hand so I added oregano, basil, and garlic plus a little extra chile sauce.  Good stuff!

I really like this recipe.  The only thing that I do is add two cloves of crushed garlic to the mixture and top it with some sliced pepper jack.  Very tasty!  My girlfriend didn't care for it so much because she doesn't like the taste of rye (italian sausage), but I loved it.  Thanks!

I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe.  My family went wild for them.  We made them into little "sliders" and cooked them on the Foreman grill.  Mmmm.  We'll be making this again!

This is one of the best burgers ever! I've made it with plain and italian sausage and loved it both times.  Per the other review I've been cautious about adding too much chili sauce - but after they're cooked, I put a little more sauce on top instead of ketchup.

I used italian sausage and my homemade chili sauce, with a clove of crushed garlic mixed in. Sooo good, all I serve them with is a slice of tomato, they don't even need condiments!

Great subtle flavor that mixes with the beef juices is delicious.  Added in fresh parsley and minced garlic as suggested.  Pan fried instead of grilled for 5 minutes on a side for medium.  So good with fresh onion rolls....

These burgers are awesome!! Hubby loved them!  I used 1lb of Bob Evans Italian Sausage and 1lb ground beef, Heinz chili sauce, garlic powder and fresh ground pepper.  I put them under the broiler.  They were delicious!  Can't wait for summer to try these on the grill!!

I couldn't seem to get the burgers to hold shape, but it made an amazing sloppy joe with a some onion powder and garlic powder. My daughter absolutely loved it. I also used 1 lb of ground beef and 1 lb of italian sausage, and I added more chili sauce when I decided to just make sloppy joes.

Oh my, my 15 year old son absolutley loved these burgers! He told me to be sure to right down the recipe so when I died he would know how to make them! Awesome or not? I think so. Have made them several times over again, tomorrow my son is having his "buddies" over, these were requested!Thank you so much MEHUNGRY98 for sharing!

I recently tried this recipe, only since I'm not a big sausage fan, I used a meatloaf mix (pork, veal, beef) and it was FANTASTIC!  I can't go back to a plain burger.  I will use the sausage next time we BBQ with family!  I sure they will LOVE it too.

Thanks MeHungry98 for a wonderful recipe!!  I didn't even bother looking for the "chili sauce" as described - when I saw the recipe I already knew what I was going to use.  I have a wonderful baked bean recipe that uses a can of "Hot Dog Chili Sauce" which is used to add to your own meat mixture to create chili for hot dogs.  I love the flavor it adds to the baked beans so I wanted to use 1/3 cup of it for the chili sauce needed in this recipe.  I used probably about the same amount of both hamburger and italian sausage.  I had grill issues so I ended up broiling them. 

Not from North Carolina originally, but here "all the way" is mustard, chili, slaw and onions.  After some time I have aquired the taste for this type of burger, minus the slaw.  So I served these "Chili Burgers" with a slice of Velvetta cheese, Hot Dog Chili, onions and mustard for mine, Ketchup for my husbands.  On the side I used a recipe for potato skins from this site.  Definately an artery clogger but we don't eat this way everyday so once in a while is ok.

Husband Loved these burgers - Really loved the italian sausage and hamburger mixture.  That's what I use in my meatloaf so I knew it'd be a hit.  He called it a d*mn good hamburger.

I found these burgers took forever to cook to proper temp and by that time they were dry as a bone?  May be i didn't get something right, but they still were not good enough to make again.

MEHUNGRY98- This is the hamburger I grew up on. We have always made and canned our chili sauce. Fellow chefs...you gotta try doing it once...you'll never be happy with the "brand" concoctions and it's so easy to make a years worth on a Saturday. I'm making the next years worth tomorrow...man, do I love summer and all its bounty! My mom always added the sausage, whether Italian or plain. Awesome, moist, flavorful burger!

What a great change of pace from an ordinary burger!! I really enjoyed these!! We found that the burgers stayed together better with smaller patties, but we usually make HUGE burgers, so they may have been average size after all.  Hubs thought the sausage overtook the beef and would prefer to just grill some sausage on the side next time. Even so, I loved them!! Such a great idea!! Thanks so much MEHUNGRY98!!

Delicious! I prefer rare burgers, but tried these anyway because they sounded good ... and they are! We ate ours plain tonight, but they'd be great piled with fresh lettuce, tomato, green pepper and onion!

I had to give this a four star.  I could not even begin to find chili sauce so I used taco sauce.  It had a little too much zig for me, which is strange because I LOVE hot spicy food.  I think next time I will cut back just a little on the Italian sausage.  I will keep check back to see if someone can direct me to a chili sauce recipe.  BUT  my husband thought they were great and had three for lunch the next day. IS A REPEAT!  Thanks for the recipe

As I make my own chili sauce, and use a similiar recipe of beef and sausage for my meatballs I had to try this. It's a winner.  I made and froze the rest of the patties.  It's even better with some chili sauce on top.  I will make again and do slider size for appetizers.  thanks for recipe

These burgers are wonderful. So juicy and full of flavor. I used turkey sausage to cut down on some fat, but everyone loved them and asked for the recipe. I did use 1/2 cup chili sauce and 1 tsp of garlic and onion powder along with pepper.

Made a really great tasting burger.  I actually used about 1/2 cup of chili sauce and I broiled the burgers for about 20 minutes on High, as it was too cold out to grill.  The addition of the Italian sausage made these nice and spicy.

I made 4 quarter pound burgers so I just winged the amounts. I used Heinz Chili Sauce, garlic powder, s & p.  Next time garlic, soy or worstershire.
I pressed them thin and also threw them in the freezer for 20-30 minutes  prior to cooking to firm up.  4 minutes a side. They held together well and the burger texture was great when done.

Made about 4x this recipe for a Barbeque. Amazing and everyone loved it. Tip: make sure you cook this through. Medium rare doesn't go well with it because there's sausage meat involved.

We made these last night for the 6th time! I always forget to review the recipe.  We have picky eaters from ages 10-36, and all 5 LOVE it.  Thank you. We season everything, so we add basil, garlic and oregano, salt and pepper before grilling.  A great recipe with perfect texture. Can't be beat.

So good!  I changed it a little: 1lb ground beef, 1lb Spicy Italian Sausage and the chili sauce.  They were so good!  I made the burgers for dinner for me and my parents and then ate the leftovers for lunches all week.  Loved them!  I'll definitely be making these again.

We didn't care for these... even though only 1/2 lb Italian sausage for 1 1/2 lb ground beef ratio... all we could taste was Italian sausage... no hamburger or chili sauce taste to it.  Might just be our preference though, just not for us.

We used ground turkey instead of ground beef due to dietary restrictions.  Also, we grilled some onion and green peeper to add to the mix.  We all loved it.

Very good. Added minced garlic, pan fried it , put thick pieces of cheddar from a brick and covered it with a pot lid to aid in the melting of the cheese. Also made cucumber salad to go with it , nice combination. Five stars. Don't  forget a fresh hard roll.

OMG!!!  These were awesome!! Fed 19 people these amazing burgers for a Memorial Day Cookout.  Can we say "Huge Hit"!!!  I made according to the recipe--had my 11 year old grandson helping and forgot to add the salt & pepper.  We did season the patties with a hamburger seasoning after putting on the grill though.  These burgers are a must have!!!

I made these because they were so simple. Hubby thought they were fabulous. He thought I had somehow put bacon in them. I am making them again tonight.

Excellent, simple recipe.  Followed the recipe exactly and the result was a delicious twist on your standard burger.  The juicy, flavorful burgers didn't even require any condiments, although I did add a little chili sauce to the top of mine.  A++

I made these burgers last night.  WOW!!!!  What a great flavor.  I will never make plain hamburgers again.  I also added a little bit of garlic powder.  I'm not sure it even needed it.
Thanks MEHUNGRY98 for this great recipe.
