This is easy to make but the directions must be followed exactly.  An electric mixer is necessary.  Very good for a diabetic recipe - moist and soft.  Would make it again.

VERY GOOD! Big hit at a party at our senior center. At most parties you eat whatever cake they have or you don't eat it because of the sugar. This was a great alternative and didn't taste like "fake cake". I had many requests to make it again. (I doubled the recipe and added a couple of tablespoons each of nuts and raisins.)

this was pretty good diet cake. It tastes more like gingerbread than applesauce. All of the diet cakes have that sort of slight spongy gummy texture. It was good to be so healthy. I substituted smuckers oil/shortening mixture for the margarine.

Very moist and tasty.  I added walnuts and served with a dollop of non-fat, no sugar added vanilla yogurt.  Nice Fall dessert.

I made this cake twice and it was quite good.  I added walnuts to the batter. The cake has a spicy flavor.

This is quite moist and yummy. It does not taste like sugar free dessert. I have already made it twice, once as cupcakes, and have recieved many compliments. I added a little extra cinnamon. The recipe does need to be followed carefully, but it is not difficult even with a hand mixer. I will make this recipe again and again.

This was a wonderful cake for my mother-in-law's birthday. Everyone loved it. I doubled the recipe with the following modifications: 3 teaspoons cinnamon (instead of 4); 1 1/2 cups splenda and 1/2 cup sugar (instead of 2 cups splenda). For the reduced fat margarine, I used smart balance 50/50 butter blend. Also, I only baked for 30 minutes even though I had doubled the recipe to make a 9x13 cake. It turned out so delicious and moist!! I served with sugar free cool whip. Will definitely make again!

Until very recently, I had cooked the oldfashioned way...diabetes changed that. This is the first cake I have tried, and we loved it.  Moist, sweet, spicy, light, delicious...it's a keeper.

Yummy, yummy, yummy!!!  I doubled the recipe, used 9x13 metal cake pan, and, for the Splenda, I used 1/2 cup of Splenda for Baking and 1 1/2 cups of regular Splenda.  I was so good that it didn't even last 24 hours!  And, even better yet, I ate so much of it, I thought for sure, I would have gained 10 lbs, but I didn't gain even 1!

The cake was very moist and spicy. I made it as a single layer and as a 2-layer cake. I used the suggestion for the whipped cream and white chocolate pudding frosting in another review. The only change to that suggestion is to fully prepare the pudding first according to package directions and THEN add it to the whipped cream. Makes for a very creamy and tasty frosting.

I make this every Christmas for gifts. However, I add raisins, nuts and more and spices, e.g., cinnamin, ground cloves, allspice and nutmeg. Plus I always double the recipe. Everyone I've even given this to loves it.

This was OK.  Smelled and tasted way to much like molasses, next time I will cut back on that and maybe add more cinnamon.  Also, had that typical Splenda after taste,  so I will try with the sugar/Splenda blend.  Texture was fine, no problems there.  Great for those cutting out sugar and watching calories.

We added 1/2 c. chopped walnuts, and used Smart Balance for the margarine.  We also added 1 t. orange zest to batter.  It was made as a dessert so we frosted it with a combination of Cool Whip, O. J., pumpkin pie spice, orange zest and a package of SF instant white chocolate pudding mix. We topped the whole thing  with canned SF apple pie filling also tweaked with pumpkin pie spice and orange zest.  It was a big hit.
