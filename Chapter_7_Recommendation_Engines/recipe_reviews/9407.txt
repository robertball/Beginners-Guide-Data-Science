This was really good popcorn.  I didn't bake it as long as it called for, but it turned out just fine.  Very tasty!  I think there might be an error in the listing of 2 cups of Oil...I did NOT use that much oil to pop the popcorn in.  I used my Stir-Crazy popper instead of using a pot to pop it in, and 1 cup of unpopped popcorn made plenty.  I also added a teaspoon a vanilla when I added the baking soda.  Thanks Yvonne...you've given me something new to make now.  :O)

Super yummy! I used my microwave popper to make my popcorn. I used honey roasted cashews and added in a few white chocolate chips to the mix. Really good!

Excellent recipe!!  I made this as part of my Christmas gifts and it was a hit.  I am making more today as everyone has been bugging me since they ran out.  The only changes I made were to use my air popper to pop the popcorn (no oil used) and to add some vanilla to the liquid candy after removing from the heat.  Excellent!!  Thank you.

very munchie, yummy caramel corn- the whole family loves it.  For me, I make the popcorn the way I usually do but then follow the rest of the  directions.
thanks!

I also only used 1 cupu of popcorn kernels and it popped plenty. I like more peanuts in my mix. But it came out very tasty and everyone loved it.

This tastes awesome, however the ratio of popcorn to caramel is off and the amount of oil is way too much for popping popcorn. I halved the recipe and the end result was a lot of popcorn that wasn't coated enough with caramel. My peanuts weren't even sticking to the popcorn. I had to go back and make some more caramel to make it look and taste more like Poppycock. The next time I make this I will halve the popcorn, but keep the rest of the ingredients as written. As far as the oil goes, I think I may have used about 4 TBS for 1&1/2 cups popcorn kernels.

This is really amazing! ! Not chewy like other caramel popcorn recipes it's like cracker jacks but better!! It makes a great gift and this recipe makes A LOT of servings. I added it to my Christmas gifts last year.
