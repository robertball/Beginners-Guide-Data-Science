This desert is awesome!  It is not however for the timid!  If you're a java junkie like me, welcome to heaven!  Caution, do not eat this desert if you plan to sleep in the next 4-6 hours! It's not going to happen!

One change I like to make is to not finely grind the espresso as suggested, but rather leave it chunky.  You might also want to sprinkle a few espresso beans on top for the ultimate java junkie desert!

Next time you go the the grocery store, check out all the new coffee/espresso ice creams & find which one you'd like best in this desert!

I didnt follow this recipe exactly, but I used the idea as the basis for a more traditional looking (and weaker coffee tasting) tiramisu icecream cake. Since I didnt make this exact cake, I gave it a rating equal to what it currently is at (4.5) to avoid changing the rating. I used the recipe for the coffee syrup, but instead of a sponge cake, I used the traditional ladyfinger cookies. I also used about 1 litre of Chapmans brand cappucino frozen yogurt (a healthier option), and another of vanilla, layering them. I assembled it in a springform pan, wrapped in waxpaper, to keep it upright and prevent leakage. I then shaved a bar of room-temperature dark chocolate overtop, using a potato peeler (some recipes said to freeze the bar, but that just made it flakey rather than nice long peels). Thanks for the awesome idea!

I never drink coffee, but this dessert still had me licking my lips.  Definitely easy to make.  I made this while I was in Turkey in the hot summer so it melted quite quickly and was a bit difficult to assemble, but still tasted great.

I hosted an italian dinner party and served this ice cream tiramisu for dessert - my guests were in AWE! I highly recommend a spring form pan. I used bavarian expresso light ice cream from turkey hill and low fat coffee ice cream from Edy's. I did have a difficult time trying to soak the syrup into the sponge cake - next time I will pierce the cake.  I topped the cake with chocolate shavings and wrapped it with lady fingers for an elegant look. I will definitely make this again... and totally suggest using bavarian espresso ice cream, YUMMY!!!   
P.S.  My husband does not like coffee and he absolutely loved this cake!

Great dessert for summer treat.  But it can't beat the classic tiramisu.
