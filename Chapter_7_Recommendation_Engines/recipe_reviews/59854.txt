This recipe needs better instructions, but it's a great snack!  The first time, I also had a chunky, dumpy topping that didn't coat the popcorn (like other reviews).  I think it's from overcooking.  So take cautiously the instructions to "cook until thick and bubbly."  I guess I misunderstood that exactly.  I think the more fool-proof way is just to do it in the microwave as you are more likely to prevent scorching, overcooking and it'll be easier to pour from a glass measuring cup anyways.  Use a 2-cup measurer, melt butter first (about 40 seconds), then add in other 5 ingredients and mix thoroughly.  Then microwave on high for about 20 sec at a time, stirring inbetween until the topping is a thick sauce.  The stirring is important to get all incorporated and applying enough heat to disolve the sugar is also important.  Should take between a total of 40-60 seconds after you add the 5 ingredients. (I did it twice, total 40 seconds, but I had half a batch, so might make a difference.)  As for baking, the method instructed seems fine.  It does taste pretty good before baking, but like another noted, it will be sticky that way.  It's great after baked as well- a combination between kettle corn and moose munch.  I also mixed in mini marshmallows before pouring the coating.  I liked it.

De-licious!!! If any of you are familiar with the famous and really expensive "Dale & Thomas" popcorn, this stuff comes really close to their cinnamon drizzle flavor but at a fraction of the cost! I followed the recipe exactly and got great results. I basically used 3 bags of microwave popcorn and doubled the sauce. I mixed it all in a really large foil roasting pan that I lined with Reynold's non-stick foil. This was so easy and the results are fabulous! All I needed to do to take it over the top was to drizzle it with melted white chocolate. It was the perfect sweet treat!

I cheated and used two bags of Homestyle microwave popcorn. I took other reviewer's advice and cooked the butter low and with the sugar while wisking it constantly until it thickened, then took it off the heat and added the cinnamon, salt and vanilla. After that step, I drizzled it over the popcorn that I spread on a baking sheet and baked it. GREAT movie snack and using the Homestyle popcorn mixed with the sweet vanilla glaze is just the end all of sweet/salty combinations. We LOVE it.

I had high hopes for this recipe but alas...The taste was great. As others suggested, I cooked everything at a low heat until thick and bubbly. I even doubled the sauce recipe because 1 cup of unpopped kernals is A LOT of popcorn. Anyway, it didn't mix well, never really coated the popcorn evenly and it still wasn't enough sauce. Perhaps the sugar never melted and that was my problem. Not sure. Oh, another thing, make sure you have a BIG bowl because you will make a huge mess trying to mix it.  I will say this though, the taste is pretty darn good. Like Monkey Bread.

This popcorn was so delicious!!  My boyfriend and I were craving something sweet and I love cinnamon sugar anything.  I found this recipe and am so glad I did!  For some advise, make sure you keep the heat very low while melting the butter and sugar, and I whisk it frequently, or else the sugar will be clumpy.  We did not have the patience this time to put it in the oven, so we ate it sticky (which was delicious!) but next time I will put it in the oven.  I also would like to try the sauce with pecans or peanuts!  Thank you for this recipe! I will definitely be making it all the time!! YUM!

This is really good and really easy.  After reading some of the reviews I decided to use 1/2 cup unpopped popcorn and followed the rest of the recipe.  Delicious but a tad overly sweet.  I made it again the next day because it was such a hit.  That time I used 3/4 cup popcorn and 1 slightly heaping teaspoon cinnamon.  Perfection.   And FWIW, I never had a problem getting the popcorn and the sugar/butter mixture mixed thoroughly.  This is a great alternative to caramel corn.

Great. When mixing cinnamon sauce make sure to keep burner at a low temp, otherwise the sugar will harden.

I popped a bag of popcorn in the microwave.  Used 6T of butter, omitted salt and the vanilla...I think there was plenty of "sauce" for the 1 bag of popcorn.  Delicious!

DELISH!!! I microwaved the sauce in my pouring measure bowl, in one minute increments. I used margerine. I doubled the sauce amounts and omitted the salt. I used popcorn leftover from last night. I ate several handfuls once slighty cooled and had to stop myself and wait for the final cooled product! Hooray! A great use for slightly stale popcorn! Mmmmmm! (I'm sure it's super-great with fresh popcorn too!)

Adjust the amount of unpopped popcorn to 1/2 cup, or make double the amount of syrup since the recipe does not yeild enough syrup to cover the amount of popcorn given.  

Also, add 2 Tbs water to sugar/butter mixture while boiling to help the sugar dissolve.  Cook the syrup to the soft-ball stage and then cook another 2 minutes stirring often.    I also added a large amount (2 Tbs) of cinnamon since I LOVE cinnamon, but this is optional. 

This popcorn tastes amazing, but because the directions are unclear and the amounts are not accurate, I only gave it a 4.   With the adjustments above, it's a 5+.

Wow, this is yummy.  Made 1/2 batch in my Orville Redenbacher hot air popper.  I don't think the intent here is to get a really heavy coating like you have on caramel corn, rather, just slightly coat some of the popcorn kernels.  I found using a spoon to drizzle and then stir and repeat worked the best for coating the popcorn.  Simply put, this sugar and cinnamon flavor snack is just "sweet enough" with a little kick of salt peeking through.

Very yummy!  Can't keep my hands out of it.  It was a little difficult to get the butter/sugar mixture even on the popcorn, but it's not that big of a deal.  Just eat a few uncoated pieces with a piece that got some coating.  I'll make it again.

Great Recipe- however, if you use Brown sugar in place of white sugar, you are essentially making Carmel Popcorn. Bake for 10 minutes at 350 degrees, then stir thoroughly. Bake for 10 more minutes and stir again. Bake a third time for 10 minutes, stir and serve. The stiring allows for even coating, and the extra bake time eliminates sogginess.

Being on a diet I have to be cautious what I eat.  I modified this recipe to make it more diet friendly. I quartered the recipe.   Using a microwave safe measuring cup I added 1 T light whipped butter, 1/2 T splenda sugar blend along with the lcinnamon, salt and vanilla.  I then microwaved it at 30 second intervals until it was thickened.  I then poured it over the popcorn and tossed it around in a bowl and baked it according to the recipe directions.  Although modest in the amount of sauce the popcorn tasted very good and killed the sweet craving I was having.

I made 1/3 of a batch, and it was tasty. Would recommend doubling the glaze. Did not let it cool for 20 minutes. No need.

This was a fast and easy way to make some tasty new popcorn!  I halved the recipe and should have used 2 bags of microwave popcorn (there was way to much sauce for just one, despite what others say).  Since I had too much sauce, mine ended up cooking for about an hour until it was crispy, but the pieces that didn't get super coated were just perfect!  Will make again, with more popcorn, and can't wait to have a totally good batch!!

Very good! Nice and crunchy and sweet. I halved the popcorn amount but kept everything else as written. It provided more than enough for me and my boyfriend with lots left over. We were too impatient to wait for it to bake so I took half, baked it and we ate the other half as was, and I must say it is TONS better after it was baked. I read other reviews saying it was still good, which it is but definitely bake it! I'll definitely be making this again.

I couldn't get this recipe to work for me.  The butter to sugar ratio has to be off.  All I got was a big glop of cinnamon sugar.  I even tried making the topping twice. When I went to go pour the mixture over the popcorn it wouldn't even mix in, big glops of sugar just stuck to some of the popcorn while half of the popcorn had nothing on it.  This was a waste of my time and ingredients.  Definately will not make this again.

PERFECT!  Used 3/4 C Kernels.  Perfectly sweet, buttery, and salty.   Was very hard to put into oven because I wanted to keep eating.

This popcorn is really amazing!  Like HawaiiMonkey, I botched the first batch of sauce.  So on the second attempt I did it in the microwave in a glass measuring cup.  I melted the butter in batches then added the rest of the ingredients, stirred like crazy in between 20 second zaps on high (took 2 times or 40 seconds).  Turned out perfect!

I have made this a few times and each time it has come out slightly different.  So I am writing this to help me be consistent. I found the stove better than the microwave because I can keep an eye on it and stir it. I don't use medium heat. I use low heat and cook, stirring just until the sugar is dissolved. If you stop too soon it will be grainy. I spread half the popcorn out in a casserole dish and drizzle the syrup over with a spoon. Then I do the same with the other half. (My popcorn maker only makes 1/2 cup at a time which is a large bowl of popcorn. This recipe is for one cup so it really would take two large casseroles to fit.) I stir and my children catch the flying popcorn before it hits the floor ;) Then I stick it in the oven which, though not necessary, does so much for the flavor I don't skip it. It makes the popcorn toasty and warm. The cinnamon is yummy and the sweet salty is perfect. My company always gobbles it up. Plus, it's very easy and inexpensive for treating a crowd. A keeper :)

It was so fast and simple!! I doubled the recipe (using 1/3 butter 1/3 margerine) as my only changes and it was fantastic! For quick and easy clean up, I lined my roasting pan with tin foil before putting the popcorn or mix into it. This is one that I will be making again for sure!

Excellent. If you have trouble getting the cinnamon mixture to stick, spray the popcorn with butter flavored spray oil and it will stick better.  Awesome recipe.

I tried this recipe with my friends last night and they really liked it!  I actually used double the amount of butter/sugar etc. because the amount I put together didn't seem like it was mixing evenly.  Plus, who doesn't love a little extra butter and sugar!  Reminded me a lot of kettle corn...

Addictive! Used brown sugar (thought it would taste better), but found after adding the cinammon the color turned almost black and when I poured it over the popcorn, it had a burned appearance. I had to convince the kids it wasn't burned! That must be the reason behind the white sugar. I only baked it 10 minutes and did not leave it to cool in the oven. That said, it was good and they woofed it down!  I like that it's a fast version of caramel popcorn that needs to bake for an hour.  Thanks!

This is the worst recipe I have ever made!  I made it exactly as the recipe is written, twice.  The first time I cooked it until the sugar mixture was a syrup so it coated the popcorn well but it tasted really burnt.  The second time I cooked it until the sugar was dissolved and it would not adhere to the popcorn and was clumps of sugar.  I would not recommend this to anyone :(

This was a great recipe and I followed the directions.  However, I am giving it four stars because when I let the sauce cook "until thick and bubbly"....it was way to thick to pour over the popcorn.  I needed to thin the sauce so I added about a teaspoon of soy milk (I have a milk allergy) so any milk would do.  This helped tremendously and didn't have any problems after that.  Other than that one problem it was delicious and something different than carmel.

I love this! I gave this to neighbors at Christmas time. One change (kind of a big change) - I double the topping. I tried it the other way a few times, but it's just so much better with more goop.

I scaled the recipe down to 2 servings, and just ate it all myself, which is saying a lot, considering we are dieting in my house. I let the hubby try some, and he has already requested it for Easter weekend. Must be good!

The sugar-cinnamon mixture never coated the popcorn. Tasted good nevertheless, but I probably won't make it again.

OMG this is DELICIOUS! It tastes like monkey bread popcorn! I did double the topping and add almost 1/2 cup more popcorn. Then I baked it at 250 for 1 hr, stirring every 15 mins to get it crispy. Thank you thank you for a great recipe!

Awesome popcorn. I only made 1/2 batch because I don't have a container large enough to hold a full batch.  I air-popped the popcorn and followed the recipe exactly. It turned out wonderful.  We took it to my daughter's volleyball game and it is almost gone.  Will be making this often and sharing it with some people.  Thanks!

Delicious!  My daughter made this for herself.  I kept trying to steal it from her.  She finally hid it in her room!  We had no problem with it mixing.  You just have to stir for awhile to get it all coated.  The time stirring is well worth it.  Definitely a keeper!

I served this at a party and it was referred to "crack" :)  I wish that the measurements for popped corn were also provided - my popcorn had a ton of duds, so I just made the amount that I wanted (and did I measure - no of course not!!)  I doubled the "sauce" and I don't know that that the sugar / butter every really cooked properly (I live in a humid climate and often have troubles with sugar).  I just went with it and didn't concern myself too much with making sure it truly coated every kernel, rather just made sure the "clumps" were evenly distributed.  I mixed the sauce on the popcorn in small batches and that seemed to work well.  Definitely a keeper!

UMMMM idk how people are complaining because this is delicious! I gave it 4 stars only because the sauce dried out a tad too much for me while it was sitting in the oven so I would recommend only letting it sit for 10 or doubling the recipe drizzling the rest on half way through. I had no problem getting it all to melt I also did not have a problem distributing it evenly. I popped it and put it in a 13X9.  Spooned it over then mixed it to coat evenly.

Yummy snack! Made this and absolutely love the flavors put in. I agree with a few of the other reviewers- be careful not to overcook- use caution with the 'thick and bubbly' instruction. The microwave may be easier to handle in that sense. The flavors are great though. I significantly reduced the amt of sauce to popcorn to keep it a little healthier and love the light flavor.

People, please don't omit the salt! Especially if you are using air popped corn, and unsalted butter especially!

Salt is a flavor enhancer, just because this recipe is for a sweet food, doesn't mean salt won't take it to the next level. 

I made this recipe using a candy thermometer to make sure I didn't over cook the sugar and it turned out so YUMMY! The ONLY think I changed was using vanilla powder instead of extract because I was out of the latter.

**(Please disregard my advice if you have a  dietary restriction on Salt. BUT there are plenty of salt substitutes that could work!)**

This is very good and I make it at least once a month for a Sunday evening snack/dinner.  I didn't give it 5 stars for only 1 reason, the sauce is NOT fool proof and I've botched it quite a few times (easy is one of my personal requirements).  I think the best time I've made it was the first.  I can't seem to get the sugar melted before the sauce gets too thick to spread.  I'll definately keep at it as this is delicious, though.  Thank you for the recipe!

What an outstanding recipe! I followed the instructions exactly as they were written, and my Popcorn turned out delicous. I even made a second batch the very next day (and it was gone again in no time!).

Tasted very much like a cinnamon roll, would recommend to anyone who likes caramel popcorn! This is a really tasty variation!

Four stars for taste! I am not sure if, like another reviewer wrote, the butter-sugar ratio is off or I cooked the butter-sugar too long/short. I will try again, but might use the microwave method instead.

A let down. Much easier to just pour butter on popcorn and sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar. Expected this to be more candy like. Back to caramel!

Very good. I was craving something sweet but overly sweet and this hit the spot! I used agave nectar instead of the sugar and it was awesome. My husband and I devoured it!

I used 4 cups of popcorn instead of the 1 cup in the recipe. The great flavor is still there and the calories are dispersed better so you can eat more! My husband and son raved so I know I'll be making more.

Nice recipe. I did it in the microwave. Melted butter in a glass measuring cup, then added vanilla and dry ingred. put back in the micro for a minute or more till it boils and maintains it for 15-30 seconds at least. Then pour over the popped corn. I didnt even bother baking it -- it was great just like that!

Excellent! For a healthier version, I replaced half the butter with olive oil (melt butter, mix in sugar, stir in oil, then rest of ingredients. stir lots because the oil likes to separate but it eventually mixes in) and used 1/2 cup brown sugar instead of 2/3 cup white sugar.

My 6 year old and I made this for her snack day at school.  It was awesome and very easy to make.  We used the ingrediants as listed and it turned out perfect.  We didn't have a roasting pan so we used two cookie sheets to dry them in the oven.  It was delicious and I will definitely be making again.  Not too sweet but just enough flavor to want to eat more!

Very good popcorn.  I made it for my son and his friend.  They loved it! This is the first time I've ever had a twelve year old ask me for a recipe so that he could make it himself.  The only thing I would change would be to use half as much popcorn as the recipe calls for.

This was great!  I doubled the recipe using half microwave popcorn and half from popcorn that I popped myself.  I put it all in a large paper bag and shook it until mixed then baked as suggested. I will definitely make this again!

Fast & easy to make, but the sauce is so thick it comes out grainy. I'll try it again with more butter/less sugar. I did cream the butter & sugar first, then added the rest as others recommended.

This was a delicious, easy to make, and cheap snack.  Brought to a party and got rave reviews.  Two suggestions - like others mentioned, if you cook on too high of heat it will start to clump, but if you take off the heat and use a whisk it thins out well.  Also, this was too much popcorn for the amount of topping.  I'd guess that 2/3 c popcorn would be better.  Thanks for the recipe!

Nothing like watching classic Christmas movies with a big bowl of Cinnamon popcorn...but  I think it really needs equal parts sugar and butter so that the topping can pour and not turn into a gloppy mess.  My old recipe was equal parts.  I use 1/2 c. butter and 1/2 c. sugar for 3/4 to 1 cup of unpopped popcorn kernels...perfection!

This popcorn is so addictive!  I think I may have eaten half almost as soon as it had cooled enough.  I'm giving it 4 stars because i used 1/3c white sugar and 1/3c brown sugar, and I had a bit of trouble with the melting part even on a low heat, it got thick really fast without actually dissolving the sugar properly.  I also drizzled the mix onto the popcorn on the tray as it seemed a little easier.

OMG this was so delicious!!!  I used exactly the amount of popcorn suggested but I did need to double the glaze to even come close to having enough.  I still give it 5 stars because it wasn't a problem making the extra glaze and it was amazing and everyone loved it!!!!!  I will definately make it again.

This is an awsome snack!  Throw in half cup of marshmellows, drizzle some white chocolate over it, stick it in the oven long enough to make the marshemellows melt and roll them into pop corn balls for a special treat!  I call them Cinnabon balls and everyone loves them.

I LOVED this. It wasn't sticky or too sweet. I'm not usually a big fan of caramel popcorn because it gets stuck in my teeth, but this didn't. The cinnamon added a nice flavor too.

I had been searching and searching for a cinnamon sugar popcorn recipe that works and this is it.  We drizzled the popcorn after it had baked with some melted white chocolate.  My husband loved it.  I thought it was perfection without.  Either way, this is a winner.

It's soo good we can't seem to let it stay in the oven after the 10 min baking time!  The second time we made it..it never got to the oven!  Either way it's a hit.. sometime when no one is home I will let it stay in the oven for 20min time  and see what the original recipe  really tastes like!  Followed the ingredients as stated..using the microwave popcorn and to say it was a hit is an understatement!  Wondering if using brown sugar would make it taste like caramel corn??   Has anyone tried it that way?

This is super easy to make, which I loved.  Since so many other raters mentioned the sauce was high maintenance on the stovetop, I took the suggestion of another person  and made mine in a glass Pyrex measuring cup.  Worked great that way and was easy to pour right in.  I thought it tasted good, but I wouldn't call it phenomenal or anything.  I thought the sauce should have been doubled, but the person I gave it to as a gift liked it the way it was and thought more may have been too much.  Thinking maybe a little more, but not quite doubled, would probably be perfect.  Will definitely keep this recipe and I think it would make nice, inexpensive teacher gifts, but I still plan to try a few other popcorn recipes I've found on this site as well.

Made this today for a trial run for Bunco this week.  Loved it!  The only change I made was using half cinnamon, half cinnamon blend (cinnamon, nutmeg, orange peel, allspice)it's what I had left in the pantry.  I also did not use a bowl to mix this in.  I put my popcorn in a large paper bag then poured the cinnamon/sugar mix on top, closed the bag and shook like crazy.  I do this for caramel corn too.  Everything gets distributed pretty evenly this way and one less bowl to clean!

Popped corn on the stove (1/4c oil, 1/2 c kernels). and used my largest bowl & wooden spoon for mixing. Didn't time how long I let the cinn/sugar mixture boil. I was too focused on making sure the popcorn didn't burn. Put in oven in 9x13, returned to bown I did the mixing in. Aside from hardening the sugar, I don't see any other reason to have it in the oven and dirty more dishes. Tasted great, just have dirty dishes.

I didn't bother baking it. I just popped the corn, mixed up the goop, and mixed it all together. It was sticky, but YUMM :P When I have time, I'll try baking it, but it was quick and easy this way.

I think I needed a bigger bowl to mix it all into.  The mixture chucked onto some pieces and didn't coat the rest of the popcorn like other recipes I've tried.  The flavor is wonderful though.  I think I will try again,  halfing the recipe, but using 1/4 cup of butter in hopes that it will distribute the coating better.

I had difficulty with this recipe as my sugar mixture didn't seem to blend very well.  I could not "pour" as directed but sort of "plopped" it by spoonful and then mixed it around.  I was not able to cover all the popcorn.  It tastes quite yummy though!

I made this last night. It is so addicting. I tweaked alittle and added 1/2 tsp cinnamon extract and 1/2 vanilla extract. I also added planters warm nuts. It is a mixture os peanuts, pecans, and cashews, with some cinnamon and sugar. Very good . I am making big batches for the holidays. Thank you for this recipe..

***NOTICE***
I made this and I absolutely loved it! The one thing I would REALLY like to point out is that it’s that many calories for ONE serving, but there’s SIXTEEN servings!! I substituted the butter for 1/2 tbsp and 3 tbsp of sugar!

It was an easy and tasty recipe,  however the instructions are not very clear so make sure not to overcook the topping mixture.  If you do it'll come out lumpy and won't coat the popcorn.  Good luck!

Delicious! I don't understand why everyone on here is complaining about the directions; it's freaking baked popcorn with a cinnamon sugar glaze! Why would anyone with half a brain require MORE instructions?! Anyway, I thought it was awesome. Letting the popcorn sit in the switched-off oven allowed them to get nice and crispy, just like you'd buy in the store - but much healthier and tastier, of course. Loved it!

I did not change anything! It turned out terribly chunky although it tastes good. It was so thick that it couldn't coat the popcorn at all and just stuck together. I was so careful to follow the directions and make sure I didn't mess up bit this recipe is just seriously flawed.

love this recipe as is. it's simple, cheap, and sweet. But if you are using microwave popcorn with butter you can make the sauce with water instead of melted butter. it comes out tasting the same.

Once you get the timing of the sugar and butter down, this is a great dish. All my friends beg for this popcorn. I melt the butter and all the other ingredients just until mixed and then pour on the popcorn and into the oven.

Only review recipes I make according to recipe.  Nice, variation for a sweet popcorn.  Would prefer a little more cinnamon/sugar "sauce" for the amt of popcorn used.  If you follow the directions the sugar goes into solution quickly and easily.   Fun, Fall treat to munch on.  Would love to add nuts to this recipe if weren't allergic.  Might try peanuts.

Fantastic! I was a little skeptical about the baking of it, especially since just adding cinnamon and sugar works fine as well, but it was definitely worth it.  Plus while you're waiting for it to bake you can be productive by cleaning the dishes and the mess you may have caused(like me)

Very sweet, a great caramel alternative. We did throw in a splash of water because the sugar was having difficulty transforming into syrup, but then things went fine. We shook coating and popcorn together in a paper sack. Perfect for a side dish (appetizer) at a potluck.

I made this for Christmas Eve at my grandma's house and everyone loved it. It was very simple to make too. The only thing, I may do differently next time is use a little less popcorn because the cinnamon sugar glaze didn't fully cover the popcorn. It was still delicious, just had some pieces that were plain in the mix. Overall, a great easy snack!!

We were in the mood for something salty and sweet and this fit the bill perfectly. My kids loved it. We cut the amount of popcorn in half just to make sure more was covered and it worked just great.

This is pretty yummy! I used 4 bags of microwave popcorn because that is what I had in my pantry. I melted the butter in the microwave, added the sugar and ONLY 1 tsp of cinnamon, I thought 2 tsp seemed like too much, omitted the salt since I used the microwave popcorn and decided it wouldn't need any extra salt. I stirred in the sugar and cinnamon, microwave for 30 seconds stirred and then 30 seconds more and it was still pretty thick and sugary, so I added approx. 1 Tbls milk to thin the mixture and it turned out perfect, added the vanilla...pored over the popcorn in the roaster, stirred to coat and popped it in the oven. Turned out perfect...2 tsp of cinnamon may have worked but I didn't want it to be bitter so I cut back. Next time I may try 2 tsp as called in the recipe.

5 min or less in the oven is best, otherwise the sugar becomes too hard.
