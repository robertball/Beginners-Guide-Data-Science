I've made this many times and it's fabulous. I sometimes use half Velveeta  and half sharp white Vermont cheddar, or all Velveeta in the grits and sprinkle shredded white cheddar on top. Also,  a few dashes of  Tobasco instead of cayenne add a wonderful flavor. This a holiday staple for our family and we also use this for shrimp and grits.

Making this recipe for years minus the cayenne and using one stick of butter.  I'm always asked to bring this to family functions.

turned out great, the family loved it. I mixed the Velveeta up in the hot grits and sprinkled cheddar cheese on top.

This was delicious .  I wasn't sure when it came out of the over, but boy was I surprised.  I added minced garlic instead of the garlic powder and put roasted red peppers on top.  The only thing I would change is to add the velveeta to the grits insteadd of on too..

My hubs loves velveeta and I do too. We were raised on the stuff. This little recipe was easy and goes well with grilled shrimp.

this recipe was very good. The only thing I would change is I stirred in the Velveeta cheese instead of topping it. I instead topped it with corn flakes. Other than that, I loved this recipe!
