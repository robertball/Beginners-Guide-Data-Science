Awesome Recipe!!!
I made it for my dog, Sparky's first birthday! We went to the dog park and all of the dogs got a piece. All of them went crazy over the cake and couldn't get enough of it! I did change one thing...I made icing out of honey and oeanut butter. Thank you so much for this recipe!!! :P

I made this recipe into pupcakes and donated them to the humane society for my birthday. Not before I let my Cookie try one--She loved it, and it didn't make her sick =)

Made these last night for Milly's 2nd birthday & both of my dogs loved them!  I followed the ingredients exactly as they were, but I filled jumbo foil cupcake baking cups placed on a cookie sheet for baking them.  350 degrees for 20-25 minutes and they were done!

First off, let me just state that upon finding this recipe, i was so excited to make this cake for my dogs. Both have sweet tooths and will consume just about anything. After reading so many 5 star reviews, i thought i struck gold. After making the cake exactly as instructed, both my dogs sniffed and walked away. Thinking maybe they were just full (which is near impossible because theyre bottomless pits when it comes to food) i left it out gor them. the following day i find it untouched.

Used this recipe to make pupcakes for my Dudley's 4th birthday.  The "kids" loved them.  Used extra peanut butter to frost, and yogurt drops to decorate.  Thanks!

We had a family party and 4 dogs were there, all but one had a birthday right around our party. I made these birthday cakes for the dogs and they LOVED them. I added a little bit of cinnamon and a small amount of salt to the dry ingredients. When I was mixing the wet into the dry, it was too dry (I didn't reallly measure the PB so that might be why), so I added some chicken broth that I had. I did use the honey. I baked them in small aluminum pie pans that are for chicken pot pies. They were perfectly baked in the 40 minutes. My husband decided to try a piece to see what it tasted like and he really liked it. He kept feeding one piece to the dog and one piece to himself hahahaha. I will definitely make this in the future for the pups!!

It was fun to make with my boys and the dogs loved it!  I was worried because the recipe did not call for water but it turned out perfect.  We made it for our sweet Daisy's 70th (10 in people years) B-day!

Happy 10th birthday Mackie!  I baked this in a 8x8 pan.  I followed  ingredients as directed.  I spread some peanut butter on top as 'icing' and she loved this!  Cute idea.  THX

I made this for the first time today for my puppy's first birthday, and it was super easy and fun. I doubled the recipe to make a total of 12 cupcakes and only baked them for 20 minutes. They came out perfect- rose just enough to make the tops nice and rounded. I iced them with cream cheese+peanut butter and topped them off with a milk bone. The dogs all loved them. I expected them to get the runs, but they were all fine! I will definitely be making these every year.

I made the recipe into "Pup Cakes" for my Labs' birthdays.  I added a couple shakes of cinnamon and substituted applesauce for the oil.  These looked better than most of my regular cupcakes or muffins with perfectly rounded tops.  I tried a small piece and it tasted like a very bland muffin.  I made a frosting of peanut butter mixed with a little cream cheese and piped it on top.  Our dogs thought they were fantastic!  I was a little concerned because one of my pups swallowed his whole.

A great Doggy Recipe! I made these in mini muffin pans! Decorated with Fat Free Cream Cheese blended with Sugar Free Peanut Butter Frosting Mix. Left out the Oil. Not need for it. The peanut butter has enough oil for the cake. Also Dogs should not have white flour, You must use whole wheat flour.

This was the BEST doggie recipe yet!!!  It was so easy and they smelled so good!  What a treat after all the disgusting liver recipes I have made!  I did make these into the small cupcakes so I food processed the shredded carrots to make them smaller and then baked them for 10-15 minutes.  Perfect size for a treat!

Well the birthday boy really seemed to enjoy this cake, so 5 stars it is!  I did include the optional honey.  I baked this in a 9 inch round cake pan for ~25 minutes.

We had to make substitutions for our boxer who has food allergies - 1 mashed banana for the egg, rice flour instead of all-purpose, and no carrots (but only because we didn't have any on hand).  I also added a dash of cinnamon to the dry ingredients before mixing it all in.  Baked in cupcake pan for individual-size servings and frosted with a little dollop of chunky peanut butter.  The result?  The perfect banana-peanut butter-honey-cinnamon once-a-year special birthday treat!

I made these for my dog's first birthday.  I did make them as cupcakes so that they were easy to share. The dogs loved them! Next time, I will make them as mini-muffins so that they are even easier to share.

This cake smells wonderful, and, yes, the birthday pup and his guests loved it! To the recipe we added only a tablespoon of honey and used brown rice flour in lieu of the wheat/white. We frosted the cake with a mixture of cream cheese and cottage cheese and decorated with some mini biscuits.

Great recipe.  I was in a hurry and didn't want to grate carrots so I used pureed butternut squash from a can.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written.  I baked in mini muffin tins and frosted with peanut butter. They turned out adorable, and Sadie loved them.  Easy recipe.

Although the batter looks really dry, they bake up moist and soft on the inside. I used a cupcake tin, which made about 6 cupcakes. My Precious loves them--great treat for her 7th birthday today! Thanks!

My dog loved this from the time I prepped it to the time I gave it to him. I wanted to make him a cake for his first birthday. I followed the directions other then using a sifter (I used a fork to sift the baking soda into the wheat flour). I also didn't have a cake pan so I used a pie pan. I dont know if its because I used a gas stove, but mine was good to go in that pie pan in 25 min at 350F. I used a frosting of whipped cream chz, plain yogurt, honey and some cinnamon. Just mix to the consistancy you want. Add the whipped crm chz first then the yogurt little by little. It stays thicker that way. Put it in the fridge for a few hours then I frosted the cake added a few pup treats and carrots for decoration. My dog LOVED IT! It was easy to make too! Im definitely using this recipie again!

I just made this for my mini dachshund's, Frankie, 1st Birthday. He absolutely loved it! I made a mini layer cake with Easy Bake Oven pans, and made mini pupcakes with the rest. I also used cream cheese and peanut butter for frosting. The only thing I changed was that I cooked them for about 15-20 minutes instead of 40. This is a wonderful recipe!

Great base recipe,  i used pumpkin instead if carrots and made cupcakes (12)they did not need the full 40 min, just cook beyond 20 min until top springs back.  Made a yogurt, pumpkin and honey glaze and topped with mini bones made with peanut butter and iced with pumpkin cream cheese.  I crumbled some dog treats and covered the cupcake edges with them.  They were perfectly moist and tasty, considering they are dog treats.

My german shepherd LOVED LOVED LOVED this cake.  He ate the entire thing! Did the same as others used peanut butter mixed with honey. Placed his kibble on top, and I sliced some of his doggy bacon strips in thin pieces and lined that around the side of the cake.

I made these for my 10-year old yellow and black labs! They turned out fantastic and let me tell you how much my babies loved them! I made exactly as written and instead of putting in a cake pan, I used a muffin pan and made 8 muffins.  Will definitley make again!

This was awesome!  I had a doggie party of 6 dogs, made into cupcakes so the owners could feed their own pets.  They loved it..I think some owners 'shared' their cupcake.

It's my dog's birthday today, so I wanted to bake something delicious for him, and these definitely did the trick. 
I cut the recipe in half and made 4 decently-sized cupcakes in foil baking cups on a cookie sheet.
I didn't have any carrots, so I added a bit of chicken broth for moisture and then fried up two strips of bacon. Most of the bacon went into the batter, and I saved four small pieces to put on top of the cupcakes. 
While the cupcakes were baking, I poured just a little bit of chicken broth into the bacon pan and scooped the resulting mixture into a bowl and added a little more peanut butter for a "frosting."
He. went. crazy. 
I had more fun watching him devour the cupcake than he did eating it, I'm sure. 
Great recipe. :)

My dog gives this 2 paws up!  Super easy to make, and my dog loved it (although she loves everything, she's a Lab).  I frosted with peanut butter and decorated it with some o's cereal I had in my cupboard.  I would definitely make this again!

Made these today for my pups first birthday! Hopefully everything turned out alright, the batter seemed more like cookie dough batter than anything, but once it was cooked it all seemed fine. Tried them out on my little brother, who thought they were delicious! hopefully the doggies like them!

I am giving this recipe a 5-star because I gave it to 3 dogs, and they ate it right up fast. I made around 12 cupcakes with this mix, but I didn't have any honey, so the batter was pretty dry. I only baked those for half an hour. I was a bit curious as to whether the dogs would actually want it, but they certainly did!

I made this cake for my English Bulldog's 2nd birthday. I doubled the recipe and baked it in a paw shaped baking pan. She loved it! I made icing with organic creamy peanut butter and low-fat cream cheese, just a little to put over the paw pads to make the shape more noticeable. We shared it with 3 other dogs and they devoured it as well! Very simple to make, will definitely make again and definitely recommend you try this recipe for your fury best-friend!

These deserve 10 stars according to my dog, Jay.  : )  I used a chunky, natural peanut butter and canned pumpkin instead of carrots since these were a last minute decision to make, and the pumpkin was easier.  I also used plain greek yogurt for half the oil, and I used olive oil for the rest of the oil.  I did use ww flour, and I also added a couple tablespoons flaxseed meal for some added health benefits.  He absolutely loves them, and they were a perfect b-day treat.  I've already shared with my fellow dog-loving friends!  Thanks for the recipe...I am definitely making them again!

My Ziggy turns 14 today so reason to celebrate. Had never made him a cake before, always biscuits, but when I saw this recipe & reviews I had to try. I made mini cupcakes (so he could share with his friends) and got 36 from this recipe - 12 minutes in the oven.  Made no changes (& do use the honey) and he absolutely loves them !! As soon as they came out of the oven he was ready to do a quality control check :-)  Did ice them with a cream cheese & honey mix. Everyone loved them. Great recipe - Thank You

I just made this for my Pug, Frank's, 5th Birthday. I didn't have any carrots on hand, and didn't feel like going to the store, so I substituted 3/4 cup organic pumpkin puree. It worked beautifully. I frosted it with peanut butter. All 4 of my pugs loved it!!!

After looking through several dog cake recipes online that involved alot of liver and beef which i'm not to keen on cooking, I settled on this one for Giacomos (my 1 year old pom) first birthday. I iced it with a peanut butter and yogurt icing which mimicked human icing as much as possible in look. I gave him and his dog-friends a slice with a frosty paws ice cream and he loved it!  My mother's greyhound did steal the rest though.

This was very good cake, both for our birthday pups and us! The people servings had ice cream on top, otherwise it is fairly dry. I admit I had to make a few substitutions due to allergies (almond butter and grain-free flour), and I added a sprinkle of cinnamon, but the flavour was wonderful. I baked it in a dog-shaped pan (from Ikea) in a convection oven and it was done in 20 minutes. I think I will play around with it to make it a bit more moist for people!

This was fun and easy. I made the following adjustments based on a dogs diet: 1) Almond Flour vs white or wheat flour. (Rice flour would work as well) 2) one banana vs. canola oil (apple sauce would work if you don't have a banana). We used organic honey and natural peanut butter (lots of oil in natural PB). I used some cream cheese, a little peanut butter, a splash of milk and a splash of water to make icing. We baked this in a 9in round pan. Baked for 35 mins and it looked over done but was not. 
The birthday boy and his guests devoured their treat in minutes.

My "Bear" loved his 5 year birthday cake. I found a recipe for an awesome icing to top off the cake. 3 TBSP Greek Yogurt + 1 & 1/2 TBSP Peanut Butter; I did have to triple the icing ingredients for it to cover the cake, but "Bear" was so excited to lick the spatula after I mixed the icing.

This is a great recipe for dogs! I did make a few changes to it though that are not drastic and really don't require any extra work. I changed the flour to rice flour as it is easier to digest for dogs and I cut the amount of carrot in half and instead added in half of a mashed banana. I also baked them in a cupcake pan so it would be a small cake for my dog because she has a sensitive stomach. I also added a frosting made of fat free Greek yogurt and peanut butter. with a tiny bit of honey. She devoured it!

VERY good recipe!!! Simple, on hand ingredients, dogs loved it! I frosted it with low fat cream cheese and a touch of honey whipped together. Then I wrote on the cake with " icing" which was one grated carrot. I pureed the carrots, added some peanut butter.....then scooped it into a small zip lock bag, snipped off a tiny corner of the bag to make a sort of pastry bag to write with

Really easy and my dog loved it. She is pretty sensitive and it didn't upset her stomach at all. The batter does look dry but bakes and rises nicely.

It was super easy, but our puppy wasn't too sure about it...she eventually ate it, but she carried a piece of it around for awhile before she did!

OMG, delicious! I added the honey, which was a good choice because the humans as well as the dog we were serving it to really enjoyed it. We were celebrating our rescue pup, Thomas's "supposed" 4th birthday and he will eat anything we give him (except frozen kale) and I thought this was a great way to celebrate his birthday! I happened to have these little bone molds that I used instead of the cake mold, in which I baked  them for ten minutes instead of forty. Delicious! Truly a gem of a recipe!

My dog got one for her 2nd Birthday and I used cream cheese frosting she loved it so when we rescued our second dog we just made cupcakes instead of a single so they could share... It has been a tradition every birthday since.

My dogs absolutely loved this and they gobbled it up immediately! Also, do use whole wheat flour rather than plain flour for dogs!  I did make quite a few changes to the recipe, by replacing the egg with banana (but banana isn't much of a binding agent so it was a little crumbly), leaving out the honey, and making it as a muffin rather than a cake. I'll try using coconut oil in the future as I feel like it'll be a healthier alternative. Also, baking time for muffins is around 15 mins. Overall, great recipe.

The batter was extremely thick, not like a normal batter at all which worried me but I double checked I'd done everything correctly and put it in the oven. When I took it out it had not risen at all ) and was more the texture of a cookie than a cake so not very happy with this.

Wanted to make something special for my Yorkie's 12th birthday. Followed recipe and added a quick shake of cinnamon to the batter. The batter was a bit loose for me but since I followed recipe to a T I figured it would be fine. Used a 9" cake pan sprayed with Pam and baked for 25 minutes. Stuck my cake tester in and Cake was done perfectly. Flipped out of pan easily and cooled quickly. According to Spike, this gets "two paws up!"  ... And yes, I had to taste it and it's really pretty good! :-)

We had a big birthday party for my daughter's dog, 13 in all and they all loved it!  Have made it a few times since.  I frost it with peanut butter (a little honey mixed in to make it spread better) and write on it with melted carob (melt at half strength in a ziplock then snip the corner to write.)

Made this for our dogs 1st birthday.  She LOVED it!  I skipped the honey and the batter was very thick so I added an extra egg.  I used a cupcake pan and only needed to bake them for about 20 minutes.  I also shaped some of the batter into tiny cookies and our cat enjoyed those. Our pets thank you for this recipe!

Good recipe! I did sub unsweetened Apple sauce instead of oil to make it a bit more healthy as I planned to make these into cupcakes and ice them. This recipe made 6 cupcakes/muffins and I iced them with a cream cheese/peanut butter icing and topped it with turkey bacon pieces (two stripes for 6 cupcakes). It was a hit with my Chihuahuas who can often be picky, and the cupcakes looked great, good enough for people. :)

I didn't have carrots, but I mashed a can of sliced yams and added that to the mixture. It took maybe 20 mins as cupcakes instead of 40 mins. I added whipped cream cheese as frosting with cinnamon as garnish. My dogs inhaled them!

My pup's first birthday was today, I made the cake last night. I found it weird how the cake turned out, but I remembered..this is not a "normal" cake. Regardless, it was VERY easy to make and Kira ate it up within 5 minutes. I highly recommend it.

I used coconut oil (warmed to liquid state) and added a pinch of cinnamon. I baked in a mini bundt cake pan (20 min), which made 6 mini cakes, frosted with peanut butter and topped with banana sliced. I will be make this again!

Easy recipe and both my puppies loved it.  Made the frosting out of 1 part peanut butter to 2 parts yogurt.  Thanks for making my Lucy's 10 birthday so special with this great recipe.

I made this for my furbaby's 3rd bday and she absolutely loved it. It gets 5 stars because my mom even loved it, so much so that she wrote the recipe down to make for herself (with a little tweaking) LOL.  I personally didn't think it tasted that good for human consumption but my mom sure did.  I added the honey and also added a cup of shredded apple to the recipe.

My 13 year old son and I made this for our dog yesterday and it turned out great.  We used a square 8x8 pan so we only baked it for about 25 minutes.

I made this cake for the 1 year anniversary of my Rez Dog rescue dog, Jasper's adoption and my daughter's rescue dog Nyah.  I substituted coconut oil for the cooking oil and used oat flour instead of wheat flour.  
I then frosted it with a cream cheese and pumpkin frosting.  It turned out great and they loved it!

I made these for my puppy's first birthday and he LOVED them!  I followed the recipe as-is and it made about 9 standard size cupcakes.  I gave my puppy the largest one in the batch and he gobbled it up.  Thanks!  This is a keeper!

Made this today for Tyson our boxer for his 5th Birthday.  I did substitute rice flour (found at Asian market) for the wheat flour as wheat is not good for dogs.  Both dogs loved it!  Will make it for all their special days!

I used this recipe for our Roxy's 3rd birthday.  All 5 dogs give this a 5 star rate.  Even a few humans taste tested.  I used more carrots than the recipe asked for, only because I shredded too much but dumped them in anyway and they were moist and delicious.  Didn't have honey but used a little VT maple syrup.

I made these for my girl's 3rd birthday. Doubled it to make 12 and mixed a few table spoons of cream cheese with all natural peanut butter for icing. Used whole wheat flour and natural pb in the cupcakes as well. They tasted great and she LOVED them. My only suggestion is that 40 minutes might be about 10 minutes too long as they were a bit dry... hard to say if it's the baking or the recipe that made them so. Either way, she didn't care one bit.

I made this for my pup's first birthday. Both of my dogs loved it. I made an icing out of mashed potatoes, water, and purple food coloring. I also used some extra shredded carrots and chopped walnuts as "sprinkles". It was adorable and simple, my 7 year old daughter did most of the work. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this cake just as a treat for my dogs yesterday (February 14), and to celebrate our only female dog's birthday. They loved it! We have small dogs with sensitive stomachs, and I was a little concerned that it might upset their bellies, but, not only did they all inhale it, but managed to keep it down! It made them really thirsty, but I was really pleased how this recipe turned out. Even our finicky Shih Tzu loved it!

Made it for our dog’s 8th birthday (first birthday with us.) she loved it! I added some peanut butter and honey icing for extra flair on one piece, but she ate leftovers with no icing just as easily.

My dog loved it, so maybe I should have given a higher rating. I used pumpkin instead  of carrots and I used a peanut butter-yogurt icing. I used an 8 x 8 pan for 40 minutes. It seemed dry. Haven’t tasted many canine birthday cakes so don’t have much to go by. I’ll watch that next time.

We make for both of my dogs each year, and it always turns out perfect! Me and my family normally eat it for breakfast too. I like to put 3/4 of pumpkin in it to pump up the taste. I LOVE THIS RECIPE!

Cakes turned out great! Have two labs whose birthdays were yesterday! One's Remington Brown and the other is Hunter Jack. They're father and son. I made them this for their birthday and can't wait to let them try them! Added extra peanut butter to the recipe and made a peanut butter, cream cheese, and nonfat vanilla yogurt frosting.

This was a easy, and I believe to be a delicious recipe. That would be  according to my dogs, the dogs @daycare, and dog park. That’s a lot of dogs! And a lot of pupcakes!

I make these as "pupcakes" for our dog and she absolutely loves them!  She sits by the oven as they're baking.  I think the peanut butter smell gets her!

Awesome recipe!! Came out great for the puppy party we had for my friends dog! I took out the vanilla extract because I read that it’s actually toxic to dogs so that was odd that this recipe calls for it. I also added dog friendly frosting made with corn starch & Greek yogurt!! All the pups went crazy for it!

I made this for my pup’s first birthday. She loved it but we didn’t let her eat it all. Probably makes a good 6 servings for a med-large dog. I used grated sweet potato instead of carrots because that’s what I had in the house. We also added Frosty Paws ice cream as “frosting.” She devoured it.

Simple and tasty treat for my dog.  She devoured it.   Although I tried it and thought it would pass as a muffin for dogs best friend.  The only addition was I made a yogurt, peanut butter, and honey frosting to go on top.

Ive been doing a variant of this receipe for a while, im never able to fing my original one but i stumbled on this one. Love it, my dog loves it, my horse loves it, its great. 

For my dog whos a really picky eater (she hates peanut butter and may or may not eat carrots depending on her mood), she loves it. I do half mapple sirup, half honey for my her specifically. 10/10 easy to do as well.

Both of our Golden Retrievers loved the doggie cake!  I didn’t have a small Bundt pan so I used a muffin pan with paper inserts.  Worked like a charm!

This recipe is amazing! I made it for our two Great Danes on their birthday. Instead of a cake, I made “Pupcakes.” I ended up icing them with more peanut butter and sprinkling them with crushed dog treats. Great Danes have really sensitive stomachs and it seemed to sit well with their stomachs. Even so, I wouldn’t suggest giving your dog more than one slice or one Pupcake. Our dogs loved them so much! My sister walked into the kitchen and saw cupcakes so she ate one. She said they were good. We still laugh about that! All in all, wonderful recipe, (loved by dogs and humans alike!).

Made it for my dog's 12th birthday. He, my other dog, and grandmother's dog all loved it. I made the recipe as is but just doubled it. No honey. Just added a peanut butter yogurt icing.

This is consistently loved by my Bichons when I make it for their birthdays.  I take some of their dry dog chow and put their first initial on the cake to personalize it.  Thank you for sharing this recipe it is a fun tradition in our family.

I added maybe a tablespoon extra of peanut butter, 1/4 cup of honey instead of 1/3 cup.  Made a cream cheese, honey, and peanut butter frosting to put on top of the cupcakes. The pickiest of the three of our dogs liked them so I recommend! Made them for a 14th birthday (:

My dogs loved this cake. I made it with the oil that the recipe calls for, but I know you can substitute apple sauce for the oil and the cake would be even more dog friendly (just can’t remember the conversion amounts.)

Easy to make and turned out great!  Dogs were going crazy just smelling it bake.  I used coconut oil instead of cooking oil .  I tasted the batter and I thought it tasted wonderful!  Mixed a peanut butter and honey frosting to attach bones.  I will have to improve my cake decorating skills but overall recipe was a huge success!  My pups loved it!

My chihuahua isn’t a fan of carrots so I substituted with 1/4 cup rolled oats and 1 whole sausage link (cut up and crisped), she absolutely loved it! Also shortened time to 30 minutes for cupcakes because I didn’t want it to be so hard/crunchy it hurts her teeth

This recipe is perfect! So easy, ingredients are all simple and I didn't have to get anything else. My pup loved his cake so much he was begging for it before his party. Definitely gonna make it again!

So me and my moms dog share the same birthday, it's on Monday... and I wanted to make him a cake .. I will be making this one for him but i will not be using vanilla extract or baking soda as these can be potentially deadly for dogs. I suggest editing this post and remove those ingredients..

Made it for my dog jasper's 7 birthday, he ate it but slowly, I don't recommend it as is. I made it into cupcakes when I tried one it was fine at first but then got really bitter, dad tried it with honey and liked it at first, then the bitterness kicked in. Safe to say that if you give your dogs would probably prefer beef, pork or chicken to this.

I baked it in a 6 inch round pan and iced it with cream cheese/peanut butter icing. Decorated it with mini dog biscuits and dehydrated bananas. 

I liked the texture of the cake and the fact that it was a bit dense, like a pound cake. 

Dogs loved it, humans said it was ok, but not sweet enough.

We made this recipe as cupcakes instead of a full cake for my dog's first birthday party.  All of the dogs loved it!  We also added some peanut butter to the top as frosting.  I would highly recommend this recipe to others.

My dog who will eat everything and anything loved this cake, but more importantly, the dog who will leave her food dish untouched for days eats this cake like it's made from solid beef!  She sniffs around the counter like there's a rib-eye on it.  Great doggy cake!

The dogs absolutely gobbled these up! They loved them!  I made pup cakes instead of a single cake so it was easier to feed to multiple dogs. (Cut cooking time in half if making cupcakes) I also added icing that I found from another dog cake recipe.  The icing was simple, just 1/4 cup of peanut butter mixed with 4oz of room temp cream cheese. Then I topped them off with a simple dog biscuit to deter humans from trying to eat! They turned out super cute!

I made this but doubled the recipe (glad I did because it would have been too flat otherwise) and substituted half of the carrots with some yellow squash I needed to use up from my garden. Because sugar isn't great for dogs but it was obvious the cake needed something, I reduced the optional honey by maybe 1/4.  The mixture was very tasty before going into the oven. Coming out of the oven it had a little bit of a funky smell (my son said it was like "burnt honey"). The texture was surprisingly moist given the look of it when it went in the oven, though I would have called it dry had it been a carrrot cake made fot humans. I mixed yogurt and peanut butter for a frosting, as another reviewer suggested (if I had to do it over, I would try mixing the peanut butter with cream cheese). At first my dog took a piece, but then put it down, licked off the frosting, and didn't want the rest. But after I cut it up into bite sizes, she happily gobbled it up and took more when offered. She ate several slices in the end (who knew I'd have to cut up food for my 67 lb. 1-year old pup). I don't think it was her absolute favorite, or anything she would have gone nuts for, but it was a sweet, happy thing to do to celebrate her birthday and I only wish I'd done it at the dog park so more dogs could enjoy. As it was I refrigerated the leftovers and gave her a little each day for the week. My family also tried some. After I got used to what to expect, I quite enjoyed it. My wife said it smelled too

My dog is on the smaller side so I used this recipe with the honey and put them into a cupcake tray and cooked them for around 25-30 minutes. The recipe made about 5 cupcakes and I cut the top off one of the cupcakes and spread peanut butter on it. My dog has been sitting next to the table with the leftovers for the past hour because he loved it so much!

I replaced the wheat flour for oat flour, which basically you can make by processing oats in a food processor or blender. I also added milk to make the batter a bit more runny like any other cake batter, since it had the consistency of a cookie batter!!

My pug just loves them. I made them last year .. she’s two now and I’m sure she’ll want them going forward too. The frosting I put on them is made with 1/4 cup cheese, 1/4 milk and 3/4 teaspoon flour. Microwave at 1 min intervals and stir to combine. Let it cool a bit then frost your muffins

I make this every year for Buddy’s birthday.  He absolutely LOVES them!! I make them as mini cupcakes or pup cakes.  The recipe makes about 50 pup cakes.  For those counting calories, they are about 36 calories a pup cake.

My son & I made this as directed for our puppy’s 1st Birthday. We didn’t measure super carefully, however. For example, I’m sure I had more than 1 cup of carrots...baked in a bundt pan and it was smaller (shorter) than I expected. I took it out of the oven at 30 minutes as it seemed to be on the verge of burning. We frosted the cake with some extra peanut butter and puppy ate it up!  She loved it. I tried a bite and while pretty bland, it wasn’t awful :) I sliced it up and froze to save for special treats.

I've made this recipe several times for my babies, and for my local shelter. All rave reviews!!! I cooked them in mini cupcake tins, so they could be a bite size treat, instead of a meal, lol. I am making it in cake form for a birthday, next week. I'm sure it will  be another hit!!! Nibbler gave it four paws up!

The recipe is amazing although I read online that vanilla extract is poisonous for dogs. I didn’t include it and the cake turned out great!!

I exchanged the canola oil for cooked sausage grease to make it a more dog friendly flavor and I used the honey the recipe called for, my 3 dogs loved it.  I found it to be a little too dry though, and because I have a bigger bunt pan then what the recipe calls for my cake was  a little bit thinner then I expected. I also only baked it for 30 mins, instead of the 45 mins the recipe called for.

I made this recipe for my labs and they devoured them! I replaced the oil with applesauce and didn’t use any vanilla extract. I made these into pup-cakes and it made 9 all together. A little bit of peanut butter on top and a small milk bone. Would definitely make these for their birthday again next year!

Looks cute! Made it twice, the first time it burnt to a crisp and I made it exactly as directed so I’m not sure what went wrong, the second time I baked it just over half the allotted time and it turned out decent. Hope my Hadley girl loves it for her 5th birthday tomorrow!

OMG!!  My 2 puppies (80 lbs. each!) turned 1 year old today.  I found this recipe and had most of the ingredients at home.  I did alter it a bit...I left out the baking soda and the oil and I added Mashed banana and pumpkin purée and sprayed my Bundt pan with Pam butter spray. There’s not a crumb left over!  I have other dogs and the mama dog who I rescued 20 minutes before the shelter was going to euthanize her.  Shelter nor I knew she was pregnant but I did find great homes for the other puppies and kept the two boys. I did frost them with whipped cream cheese cinnamon and an 8 ounce cup of plain Greek yogurt. I will be sharing this recipe with my rescue friends and putting it on my Facebook page because it was just amazing!!

I followed the recipe on my first attempt; the dough was way too dry, but I baked it anyway.  The cake crumbled apart but my dogs still liked it.  On my second attempt, I added 1/3 cup of plain Greek yogurt.  Turned out perfect! I also made a frosting out of  Greek yogurt, peanut butter and honey.

This was PERFEC!! My one dog is very sick & I decided to make sure this birthday was extra special. After reading through the reviews decided on this cake. I did make some changes: Used applesauce instead of oil & used whole wheat flour. I also added freshley grated ginger since she had been nauteous from being sick in hopes of setteling her stomach and it helped wonders! I used a springform pan and baked for 25 min. Topped with peanut butter. 

Made for a perfect addiction to my dogs possibly last dr birthday. Thank you for the recipie!!

I followed the recipe exactly and did use the optional honey. I found the mixture to be very dry but decided to trust the recipe and baked it. It turned out very dry and crumbled as soon as it was out of the pan.

Excellent recipe. Easy to make and bakes up beautifully. It says to bake for 40 minute which is about 20 minutes too long. I baked it for 25 and it was just starting to look over cooked. It makes a small cake so I don't know what the thinking was in saying 40 minutes. I highly recommend this recipe but just be careful not to bake for too long.

Didn't have carrots and used less honey but it didn't dull this dog loving recipe one bit! Baked for 20 min in a small oval pan (from Michael's) as it wasn't really a normal pour it batter due to my not following the recipe exactly no doubt. Turned out perfectly done. Melted 1/2 cup of peanut butter and smoothed on top then used our boys second favorite food, popcorn, to decorate it. Our pup went crazy and my 5 yr old said it wasn't bad but she didn't want it for her birthday

My Toy Pom was over the moon with his cake - i used a rectangle cake tin instead of the muffin molds. For my frosting i combined strawberry yogurt & peanut. My family and i even enjoyed this cake... Its definitely a 'must try' even if you don't have a pet :-)

Great for people and pets! I  made the recipe without honey, reserved 1/4, and doled the rest out into cupcake cups. I added a few TBSP agave to the 1/4 I reserved and baked it all up. It only took 20 minutes in the oven. The cupcakes with agave were delicious, and the dogs loved the ones without.

This was a great treat for my dog, she loved it!  I made it in a meatloaf pan and used the same cooking instructions in the recipe.  I topped the cake with extra peanut butter, too!

I thought this recipe was great. Used natural almond butter instead of pb because that's what I had, I don't think the dogs minded. Loved that we could have eaten it with them!

I made this for my Granddog's 1st Birthday. It was a hit he loved it.  We had a puppy party all the other dogs loved as well, left them begging for more.

This recipe made these into 8 regular sized muffin / cupcakes ( pup-cakes). Substituted apple sauce for the oil. Baked for about 25 min, but that was too long. I would say these are done in about 15 to 20 minutes. 25 made them a little too dry on the inside, but my dog still devoured it :)
Made a frosting out of cream cheese, peanut butter, and honey. Used one 8 oz block of cream cheese, one cup of peanut butter, and about 1/4 cup of honey to make the frosting. Will post picture :)

I have a toy poodle so I used three mini springform pans and lowered the baking time by 15 minutes. I  kept the little pans on a small baking sheet to handle them more easily in the oven.  I was pleased with the results. The mini cakes were still too large so I sliced a small piece and my 6 pound dog ate it with gusto. Next time I will shorten the baking time by another 5 minutes as the top turned very dark in a few spots.

I have made this cake for the past 2 year s for my dog, Shadow.  I will be baking it again this weekend for his 12th day.  I spread peanut butter as frosting along with treats on top.  He devours it in one sitting since I use a small bundt pan.

I made this for my pitbull's 14th birthday. Her and her chihuahua sister loved them. Instead of a cake, I put them in a mini muffin tin. I used the same temperature but only baked it for about 16 minutes. I would definitely make them again. It was cute to see how much they enjoyed their homemade cupcakes!

I made this for my dog and my sister's dogs. The cake was easy to make and cooked perfectly but I found that I had to add  a couple tablespoons of water to make the batter a little less glue-like! Both dogs went CRAZY over them and it was insanely adorable!!!!

I made this for our dog for her 3rd birthday ! She absolutely loved it. I did not put quite as much honey as it called for and it turned out just fine. Another thought- you could sub in unsweetened apple sauce for the oil if your pup is watching their waste-line! I made the icing out of greek yogurt and peanut butter.

I made this cake today for my Newfoundlands first birthday and he absolutely loved it. I did exactly as the recipe said and included the honey for a sweeter taste. I will definitely be making this for him every year!
P.s. He is now also addicted to carrots. (:

I've made this cake every year for my sweet girl. I got a mini bundt cake pan for these and I fill the center with peanut butter. She loves it and her doggy friends do too! It actually tastes pretty good too (from a human perspective).  Will keep making year after year!

I used applesauce in exchange for the oil because I had no oil on hand- still baked up beautifully!!
It was a happy first birthday for Winnie!!

I made it for my Bernese mountain dog, pepper, and she loved it. She liked the floor looking for crumbs. Speaking of crumbs, I would definitely add the honey. I skipped it and the cake was very dry and when I gave it to her, the crumbled and she was coughing like crazy. If you do skip the honey, I would crush it up and add some water.

Made these for my Charlene's first birthday, and she loved them. I tried one and for not having sugar and all things good in them, they were pretty decent. (I'm more of a coffee with my sugar kinda person). I didn't know what the topping was in the picture so I just used straight peanut butter and they were good. If you are making enough for a party or a big cake pan, I would double or triple this recipe because I could only make 6 cupcakes. Overall, Very Good!!

Made this for our Pomeranians birthday and they loved it. Doubled the recipe to use a large bundt cake. Used coconut oil and rice flour and added a bit of cinnamon. Made a dog friendly icing to go on top and added dog treats to decorate :)

Omg!! You can't even say 'Pupcakes' in our house becasue the dogs will go crazy!! I make this for both of their birthdays and put them in cupcake tins. I normally ice them with a tad of peanut butte Re and maybe some carob chips or sprikles. This recipe is a must for dog owners!! And one of my dogs is picky and he gobbles it right up!!

My puppy liked it & so did we. We topped it with Greek yogurt & blueberries. It was kind of a take on banana or zucchini bread but with carrots. You might want to watch the timing so you don't make it too done....I would have baked a little less.

My golden's 4th birthday cake and she devoured it. I added the honey and also mixed honey and peanut butter together for icing. It's actually more like a giant cookie than a cake so I may try rolling the batter out and cutting in shapes for treats.

It was delicious, for my 2 puppies and me. I recommend putting on some kind of frosting, because it brightens up the taste. This dog cake deserves a 5-star raiting.

It turned out good, but it baked in about 30 mins. It barely covered the bottom of my bundt pan. Maybe half inch of batter.  It was a good size though. Plenty to share with four dogs.  I iced it with peanut butter and decorated it with dog treats.

I had all ingredients except an egg imagine that so I substituted some ground flax plus water. The cake smelled great while baking and came out perfectly moist and fluffy. My dog loved it and I thought it tasted yummy too. I froze the leftovers for a treat when my dog decides to NOT eats my shoes.

Dogs can't eat baking soda or vanilla extract, so I wasn't sure about this recipe. I took out the baking soda and vanilla, so the cake didn't rise and could've had more flavor, but the dogs enjoyed it. One of their favorite foods are carrots, so I was glad that there were some in this recipe. Thanks a lot! Almost 5 stars!

I didn't put carrots in there, I just added a little more honey and peanut butter and my dog loved it.  He's 5 years old and really enjoyed his cake as I made it in an 8 X 8 glass pan and it came out really nice.  Put a little peanut butter on the top, piped a little icing on it and still have plenty left over to give him, even the cats wanted to have some so they had a little taste.

I wanted to add the picture when I clicked on made it but didn't have it loaded yet.

This is a fantastic recipe my pup is turning 2 this weekend and we did a test run before her actual party.  Not only did she love it but she couldn't stop wagging her tail, it was a hit!  And also based on the ingredients seems healthy, I added some coconut oil since she really likes it.

I don't see the problem that everybody is having with this cake. I followed the all of the directions, but instead I put it in a pie plate. My dog is a picky eater, but he absolutely loved it! I might even make this every few months for my dogs! I would highly suggest this recipe!

This recipe states that it needs to be baked for 40 minutes in a 6-cup muffin tin. I thought this was too much and cut the time in half and they came out perfect.  (Next time I'll start with 15 minutes and see if they come out less dry.) Other than that,  my dog loved them. I put peanut butter on top and a little dog treat for decoration and it was gone in one bite. This is a great dog "pupkin" and I would make it again.

Made these and love them, for my dog and even myself. I used apple sauce instead of oil, mashed two bananas instead of carrots and I did add in some organic solid honey and added extra flour for the right consistency for muffins. Cut cooking time in half, used muffin tin and made 8 muffins. I filled the cups full and they puffed up nicely.

Recipe is fine, easy enough with ingredients already in the house.  Batter was a little small in volume and a little bit dry, I added about  6 or 8 tablespoons of plain yogurt.  Baked for 35 minutes.

Cooper's birthday is tomorrow but we sneaked one for quality control and it was perfect! Two of his favorite treats are peanut butter and raw carrots!  I made the recipe as written but put the dough in little paw shaped silicone molds and added a little frosting made out of peanut butter and powdered sugar.

I used this recipe to make 18 mini cupcakes.  Baked for about 15 minutes. Iced with cream cheese, honey, peanut butter topping and garnished with a mini dog bone.  My dogs loved them!

I made this exactly as stated and my two dogs LOVED it. Their favorite treats are peanut butter and carrots so I knew this would be a hit. I put my dogs name on the top with the sausage link type dog treats cut up.

Made it as pup cakes for my dog's birthday and he (and his friends) loved it! I used coconut peanut butter, pumpkin purée (instead of carrots), and brown rice flour. I sampled the final product-tasty for humans, too!

Our 3 miniature dachshunds devoured this cake. It did make a very small amount of batter (only enough to make 3 mini bundt cakes) and was very thick (had to spoon into pan and smooth out). I tasted the batter which was pretty yummy, even with having to substitute 1/4 applesauce + 1/2 tsp baking powder for the egg I didn't have. I'd definitely make this again!

I substituted oatmeal instead of carrorts, and made them as cupcakes instead of a cake. I can't believe how great it tastes for a healthy treat. I'm bringing them to work for my lunch and am sharing them with my furry baby.  Thanks!

Alright, so my dog doesn't get any scraps or anything other than his dog food and treats unless he steals it from my husband or I so I thought this would be GREAT. Firstly, this recipe didn't make barely ANY batter so my double-decker idea was dead. and then I put it in for the 40 minutes at 350 and it burned the cake, i had to cut off a small piece before frosting it to make sure my dog would even eat it. Never using this again.

My golden retriever and poodle mix ate them in literally 2 seconds they I am sure enjoyed them my family also tried them and enjoyed them but instead of grating the carrots I thinly sliced them. But they completely deserve 5 stars.

I tripled the recipe and baked the cake in a tube pan.  All of my own dogs and foster dogs loved the cake.  I put plain Greek yogurt in a cheese strainer to get the liquid out and used the yogurt as icing with sliced bananas on top.  Really good recipe..my dogs thank you!!!

Made this for my 11 year old furry baby's birthday. I made  8 cupcakes with this recipe. All of my 3 dogs got one and loved it and I thought it was pretty good, too. I used my expensive gluten free flour so that I could try one. Tasted great! 12 paws and two thumbs up!

I used this recipe and doubled everything and added 3 bananas that I didn't want to waste from sitting too long.
We gave our Marley a piece on a paper plate for his 1st birthday and he loved it!

Made it for my Belle's 1st Birthday she LOVED IT!!!
Only thing I did different was I replaced the oil with apple sauce at the same amount and I didn't use the honey.  Super Simple.  I had never made my doggy any homemade treats before but I will make this for her again. When she smelled the peanut butter baking she started dancing around in the kitchen,

I have 3 dogs, and all of them LOVED this! I made it in mini tin pie pans, and cut it into little slices of cake and fed it to them as treats throughout the day. They ate every last Crumb. I added a little oatmeal flakes to the mix, and also some carob chips. I topped it with peanut butter mixed with cream cheese, which I piped onto it. Then sprinkled some coconut flakes on top. I'm going to have to make this often for my furbabies!

I make this cake several times a year. I make it in an 8x8 pan, bake 35-40 minutes. Once it's cooled I cut in 1" squares and freeze. Haven't met a dog yet that didn't love it!!

We just made this for my baby girl on her first birthday on 11/20/15 and it was a huge hit!!! There are 3 other dogs in the house and they all loved it and ate it right up!! Not even a crumb left. 

Many thanks for providing this super easy amazing recipe!! I'm so happy everything was a huge success and that our dogs including the birthday girl loved the birthday cake. Highly recommend this recipe.

I followed it perfectly.  Except I didn't cook it for 40 minutes.  I think I baked it for about 25.  I doubled the recipe and made a nice size for about 18 dogs.  FROSTING IDEA:  I mixed a block of cream cheese (regular, NOT low or nonfat) and peanut butter.  I also cut up Kosher hot dogs and used Pupperoni treats to decorate the top.  The dogs loved it!!!!!

Amazing recipe. I done it today for my 2 doggies birthday and they loved it. 
Thank you very much for share this recipe.
 As a frosting  I put soft cheese 75% fat free with honey and as a flour I bought rice flour that is better for the dogs. 
This recipe is amazing,  My dogs loved it. Next year I will do it again.

My picky eaters LOVED this cake!!
The only change I made was: instead of a bundt cake pan I used a doggy paw print pan. I kept an eye on it, and at about 20 minutes it was done cooking (toothpick test).
Easy to make my friend's daughter helped me and we had a blast! 
But the best part was watching the dogs eat it at their birthday party!

My dogs could not get enough of this cake! They are very picky, so I was a bit hesitant after reading some of the mediocre reviews. But I am so glad I decided to make it for them! I did use organic peanut butter (trying to be healthy here) and agave instead of honey. But it was a huge hit! Thanks for sharing the recipe! I'll be using this one again for sure(:

I made this for my dogs and they give this 'two paws up'.  As soon as it came out of the oven they were definitely interested!  I used crunchy peanut butter and opted to use the honey.  I used cottage cheese and carob chips as a topping.  Even the crumbs were eaten.

I was super excited to make this for my dog and then my dog George did not like it he look at it and said no he walk away. I  was very disappointed in the cake it didn't rise like i was hoping. I don't think I will make this again .

I'm 13 and I made this for my dog Honey's 2nd birthday and my other dog Tiki and they tore it up! They loved the peanut butter and even locked the remains off the floor! I am TOTALLY making this again ????

This has 2 of my boy's favorites....peanut butter and carrots. So easy and versatile. I didn't have honey so I used agave syrup instead. I baked it in a mini tiered cake pan to make it cute and it turned out great! For the frosting I mixed peanut butter, veg oil, and more agave until it was the perfect piping consistency. It looks so cute! Thanks for this recipe!!!

Easy to make and the Dogs Loved it.  MOST IMPORTANTLY - even my sensitive stomach pup had no issues and wonderfully firm stools the following day.  (You know how important that is!)

I did like a couple of others and put it in cupcake pan for easy dispense..20 min at 350... I didn't even use liners..just oiled the pan first and they came out super easy..

I took the suggestion of using applesauce instead of oil and I did use the honey. I used gluten-free rice flour. Big hit with 7 year old border terrier - looooved the Greek yogurt/peanut butter icing, too. I used a muffin tin and will do mini muffin tin next time as she is a smaller dog. Will absolutely make again!

Made this for my Newfie's first bday. 3 other dogs were at the party. They overate, BUT nobody got sick! Yay! My dogs have food allergies, so I used gluten free flour, coconut for the oil, and no honey. I wrote on the cake with watered down whipped plain cream cheese. Everyone loved it!

My Boston Terrier loved this recipe! I made them into 12 cupcakes and baked for 20 minutes. I frosted it with a Greek yogurt peanut butter mixture and topped them with heart-shaped cheese pieces and star shaped carrots.

Made this for Chase's 4th b-day. Im sure his brother & him will love it. This recipe was really easy & I liked the taste of it. I doubled the recipe because Chase is a big guy & I wanted him to be able to have a big helping & still be able to share. I only had to bake it for 30 min. (with it doubled) I iced it with a mixture of peanut butter, honey &, vanilla extract. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I had to double the recipe or it would have only been 1 inch tall that might have been because the batter was so thick not like when you make a human cake and can pour the batter into a pan. I had to spoon it in and smooth it all down so it would be even.

I made this for my pup's 1st birthday!  She gobbled it up in about a minute.  I brought over a slice for our neighbors dog and he grabbed it from the plate while we were chatting and swallowed it whole!  I used a 9 inch round and baked for 20 minutes.  I also "iced" the top with peanut butter.  Big hit, I will definitely be making this every year for our Kona Bear.

I made this twice! The first time it burned! Second time it was crumbly. Doesn't make much and I doubled the recipe the second time and left out the honey. The dogs all loved it but I think I will look for a better recipe. Made frosting out of Greek yogurt and peanut butter.

The cake itself smelt good and had great texture, but the dogs didn not like it.

Made this for my Staffy x Border Collie male dog for his 3rd birthday. He LOVED it! And I was so pleased to see I already had all the ingredients, although not oil so I did without and still came out perfect. Will definitely use this recipe again. Thanks!

My granddaughter and I made these today for Happy Gotcha Day for our rescue Great Pyrenees and Golden Retrievers. Had everything on hand. Used applesauce instead of honey and baked in mini muffin pan for 15 minutes. We frosted them with a dollop of peanut butter while they where still hot. They were a huge hit with all our puppers. Since we can control what we are giving our furkids, we will definitely make these again.

I like dog treats that you can actually see what's in them.  This is perfect.  I did put my own twist on this recipe and my dog loved it.  Instead of any flour, I ground up Wheat Chex (same amount as the flour called for), which gave a really nice texture to the mix, and instead of oil, I used extra-chunky, unsweetened applesauce from Trader Joe's.  I also used a sugar and salt-free peanut butter, figuring there would be enough sweet in it (and salt they don't need), and used about 1/2 the honey.  Instead of a single pan, I used a mini-muffin tin, and one batch yielded about 22 of the treats.  

I even tried these, and I'll say, they aren't too bad at all--decent flavors, decent texture, and they hold together really nicely.  A little on the bland side, but for a dog and their hyper smell and taste, they are beyond good.  At least my Dougan thinks so.  

Same oven (350), spraying the pan with a cooking spray (wiping and respraying the pan out between batches), baked in the tin for 12-15 minutes.  Cool a little in the pan and they should just pop out.  I put them in a zip-lock bag, and they kept for a good week just on the counter.  

Today, I'm quadrupling the batch to make little goody-bags to take to friend's homes for holiday parties that have a pup. I think they will be well received.

I made this cake for my dog last year, and he LOVED it. I used peanut butter for the "frosting." After he got a sniff, he was so excited to eat his birthday cake- it was the cutest thing. His birthday is actually tomorrow on Halloween, and I'm making it again.

It's awesome!
I make it every year and my dog love it!
But i make it with 1/2 cup banana and 1/2 cup carrots.
I think it's more delicious
Try it and you will see that is delicious

Very disappointed... There is no moisture to hold this together, and it completely crumbled so I ended up slicing it to create one slice of three-layer cake held together by peanut butter.

I made this for my Granddog's 2nd birthday and loved it!  I made them into pupcakes so he could share with his brothers and cousins. I frosted them with a very thin layer of cream, cheese icing and topped them off with little dog bones.  Huge success - lots of happy puppies!

I used this recipe for my Bella's first birthday. I baked it in a 6" pan for about 30 minutes. I only added about 2 tblsp of raw organic honey instead of the 1/3 cup and added in about 2 tblsp of water to thin it out a bit as it was more a cookie dough consistency. It's really important to spread it to an even thickness because the batter is rather thick and lumpy. I frosted the cake with one package of fat free cream cheese mixed with 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tbsp raw organic honey. Bella loved it! We also shared with her brother and cousins and everyone loved it. I would definitely make it again.

We have 3 boxers and I make cupcakes with this recipe rather than a cake as a treat for them. They can not get enough of them! I also make a bit of icing mixing honey and peanut butter then decorate with a little shredded carrot on top.
I also make a cake on their birthdays and they all have a bit each! such a great recipe I'd recommend it to anyone.

I made this recipe for my labrador Knox's first birthday. I used a whole banana in place of an egg for added flavor and to keep the moisture (I don't particularly like eggs and didn't want to waste a carton for one recipe). Instead of making it into a cake, I used a mini cupcake pan and it made 24 perfect little balls and I only had to cook them for about 15 minutes. I decided to freeze them before I gave them as a treat for an extra little bonus (especially in the hot summer we're having). My dog loved them and I will be making more in the future!

I made this for my puggle and she loved it. Not to mention, since all ingredients were edible, we decided we must have a taste too. And low and behold..it was actually pretty delicious!! No wonder she loved it so much!

Made this and my 3 dogs LOVED them. They kept looking at me and pawing for more! I tweaked the recipe a little bit. Instead of the 1 cup of skim I used 1/2 cup of almond milk and a 1/2 cup of chicken broth. I also shredded some cheese into it. Followed all the directions and came out awesome :)

I just tried this recipe and my dogs loved it.  The cake did turn out a little overbaked but maybe that was my fault using a heart cake tin.  The dogs certainly didn't notice.

So easy to make and my dogs loved it. A little big to finish in one meal for my 2 Shelties, but that keeps the birthday happiness going for a few more days.

I used Greek yogurt as "icing" so that I could write on the cake.

My boy Grendel turned 7 today. The recipe was quick and easy to put together. I baked it in a 8x8x2 pan and topped it with a peanut butter and honey icing. Needless to say, he loved it.

Was so easy to make.  I had all ingredients on hand, except honey (which is optionsl anyways).  Made it night before, to celebrate her birthday today.  She really liked the cake.  I've broken it up into a dozen pieces (actually more - she gets the leftovers!) and will take in a piece for each of her puppy friends at our weekly doggie playgroup.  So happy I found this recipe!

These were awesome!  I baked them for my dog's 1st birthday.  I thought 40 minutes was too long, so I baked them for about 30 minutes and they were fine.  My dog gobbled them up.  He loved them and I enjoyed making them.

Made this yesterday and served this today to my dog Drizzy, who turned 5 years old today. I did have to make some substitutions since I didn't have honey, and also due to her skin allergies she doesn't eat grains. So I substituted a gluten free baking mix (made out of bean and potato flours), changed to coconut oil, and added shredded coconut instead of honey. Everything else stayed the same including the carrots. I did find I had to add some water to get more of a batter consistency since the shredded coconut absorbed some of the moisture. I baked this for approximately 20-25 minutes in a round 8" pan. Made a 'frosting' out of peanut butter and plain greek yogurt. My dog went absolutely wild for the cake, and the dog we are dogsitting also loved it. My dog licked the floor for crumbs until I got the vacuum cleaner out!

Great recipe!  I actually adjusted it to 1 serving and followed it exact and it worked perfectly in 2 cupcake liners.  The recipe is quick and easy.   I put all natural vanilla yogurt on top and my dog loved it!   Will definitely be using this recipe again.

I have made this recipe as a cake, as pupcakes and tonight as MINI pupcakes.  All of our dogs and their friends love them!  I baked the mini pupcakes for just shy of 15 minutes. I didn't think they needed liners at all.

My aunts dog turned 4 today so I decided I'd make this for her, it turned out really well but my batter turned out more the consistency of a soft dough than cake batter, I'm just wondering if it was supposed to? I didn't add the honey in either. This cake took only 23 minutes to bake and honestly could've stood less.

Recipe worked great, and all 3 of my cocker spaniels loved them!!!  I used large reynold's cupcake foils. Filled each 3/4 full. Made about 6 large cupcakes. The recipe called for 40mins, but they were done in about 25mins. I topped each with a dab of peanut butter/honey mixed together, a small biscuit, a pup-a-roni treat.  Yum!

Our chocolate lab LOVED it! She could not get enough! I followed directions and I did add the honey.  Only thing is that 40 made the cake burn on the edges...I would cut back 5-10 minutes next time.  I had to trim the edges off..Other then that, fantastic!! I will make this for her every birthday!

I made this for my puppy's first birthday and she loved it. Next time I make it I will make them in cupcake form so they are smaller to eat.  I also added a bit of honey for a bit of sweetness.

I like that all the ingredients are things that you have around the kitchen.

The dogs loved this!!! It was easy to do and well worth it. We only had a little bit of carrots so we didn't add so many, but we also added a jar of carrot apple baby food. Happy Birthday Princess!

I made this for my puppy's 1st birthday and he loved it! I used whipped cream cheese for frosting and wrote his name on it by putting peanut butter in a Ziploc bag and cutting a tip off of the bag. I also bought a bone-shaped tin from Target.com and used that for a fun shape.

I made this for my dog Chief's 4th birthday party and we all (including Chief) loved them. They are a little thick for a cupcake but still good. Thanks for the great recipe!

I used this recipe to make my dog's 1st BD cake. I made it as cupcakes and it turned out great. My dog is a very picky eater and has very sensitive stomach. But this cake, he ate them all and had no stool problem.

My daughter begged me to bake a cake for our dog's 8th birthday, and I found this recipe today.  The dog LOVED it and it was gone in 10 seconds.  I made "6 servings" in four little ramekins, so it was a bit larger than a cupcake.  We all tried it and it's an okay cake for people, but would probably be even better with frosting :)

LOVE IT!  So do the dogs of course.  My pup is 3 this year and I've made him a cake every year.  Thought I'd try a little different recipe this year.  I used everything...substituted part of the oil with flax.  

Followed recipe as far as amount of ingredients, perfect size for 12 cupcakes which I baked for 20 minutes at 350.  They came out great!  And smell really good too :)

Topped some with beef baby food, some plain.  What a hit!

Our dog, Chance, loved this recipe....and so did all of his doggie friends! Quick and easy to make...I used a cupcake pan with foil wrappers to reduce the clean up and make our treats easier to share!

I would like to make this recipe for my daughter's Yellow Lab who is allergic to wheat products.  Would it work just as well using Rice Flour?  He can tolerate rice foods.  I made the recipe for a friend's dog and we all tried a little piece.  It is actually very tasty.  Look out dogs!  The humans like it too!

I've made my critters birthday cakes for years. This is a good one but to make it even better I used cocktail weenies for candles. Dogs can't blow out the candles anyway.

I made these into "pupcakes" instead, and made this for my Bella's first birthday. She and her daddy LOVED them! They were sniffing at the oven before the timer beeped. Thanks so much for a yummy recipe! I've been looking for this for years!
