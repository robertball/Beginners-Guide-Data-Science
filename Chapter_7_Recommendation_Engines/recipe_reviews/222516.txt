Excellent flavor,  but a very dry, coarse crumb texture.

This recipe was fantastic.  Everyone loved the texture of it; it wasn't dry at all.  These were ideal for our brunch.  Everyone asked for the recipe and at the next two get-togethers, other people made these.  Thank you for a great recipe.

Although we could taste the chives, dill, and tanginess from the yogurt we still considered them bland and very dry.

This cornbread was awesome and not dry at all. The only thing I changed was I used margarine instead of butter and a heaping tbsp each of the herbs in dry form because that's what I had. This was so moist and full of flavor. It's now my favorite cornbread recipe.
