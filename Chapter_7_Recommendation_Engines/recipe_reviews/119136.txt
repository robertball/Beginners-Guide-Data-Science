This recipe was also handed down in our family. Don't know who first started it but do know it's great. Only thing differant is instead of water we use milk. It makes it so creamier then water.

Very Tasty. Nice after meal treat for the holidays. This is truly an old-fashioned type of candy. If you try to bite/chew it, tends to stick to teeth. But, very nice for mouth-watering melt away.

First time I've ever made candy.  Wow, I never knew it was so easy and tasted  so terrific!!  I didn't have any light corn syrup or maple extract, but I did have EXACTLY one cup of brown sugar corn syrup and 2 tablespoons of real maple syrup in my pantry so I used those as substitues.  Will make again as recipe states next time, but my substituted way tastes like a clear & hard caramel-tasting candy.

We made this for a Girl Scout open house.  The girls did most of the cooking and all of the cracking!

Wow!  I'd never made candy before so I was really nervous before I started.  However, the recipe is so simple and the outcome so outstanding that I will definitely make more in the future!

Made this recipe to give at Christmas time. I had a hard time keeping my husband out of it so I would have enough to give! Thank you. It is a great recipe.
