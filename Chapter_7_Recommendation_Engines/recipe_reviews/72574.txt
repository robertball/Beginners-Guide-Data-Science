I thought these were OK.  They had a very strong dijon taste, and I guess I would have liked them better with more of a hint.  They complimented my pork chops well, but if I were to make them again, I would use half of the dijon.  Thanks!

I was looking for a new way to prepare mashed potatoes, and am glad I came upon this recipe. After reading the reviews, I halved the milk and cut the sour cream to 1/2 cup. As well I added 2 tbsp of fresh chopped chives, and in place of the garlic salt, added a clove of fresh garlic (cut in quarters) to the potatoes with five minutes left to cook, and mashed the garlic in with the other ingredients. Great accompaniment to lamb.

I used 4 Yukon Gold potatoes.  This is a case where I wish the recipe had stated a weight rather than the number of potatoes.  I also used 3/4 cup FF sour cream and no milk at all because it was already the right consistency.  I started with 1/2 the mustard and am very glad I did.  It was still pretty strong tasting.  This was ok but not something I will make again without some major tweaking.

At almost 300 calories per serving, this receipe is not a healthy alternative for me.  Why not use just a bit of butter and skim milk?

I agree that this goes great with pork - we had it with plain grilled pork chops, and it was really good. I think it would be even better with some cheese or maybe sauteed onion. I'll definitely be experimenting. Thanks!

My boyfriend and I tried this the other night. Even though we're both fond of mustard, the taste was just too odd.

Nice change of flavor.  I used red-skin potatoes and mashed them with peels on and that worked well (besides the time saving)!  Excellent taste and texture.  Quick and easy to prepare.  Try it for something different!

Great taste!  I could have cooked more potatoes though, the sauce was more than enough flavor for three.
Thanks!

This was a pretty good side dish. I made it with a spiral ham yesterday and the mustard in the potatoes complimented the ham nicely.

Very yummy twist on mashed potatoes! This recipe took 20 min start to finish and very little effort. It reminds me of potato salad with the mustard flavor. I froze some of this b/c it made a lot for just two people.

This was good, I used red potatos and left the skin on, we didn't have Dijon in the house, so I used spicy brown mustard instead, it worked, next time, I'll try adding garlic & onion.

I rated this recipe a 5 star because it is easy to make, great on it's own, and would taste great with other ingredients added to it. This time I added some grated romano cheese and next time I will try roasted garlic. It's a keeper!

Very good potato recipe!  This is my second time preparing this tasty dish.  I added an extra touch of dijon mustard and wow, it came out great!  To accompany this potato dish, I prepared pork in mushroom Dijon sauce along with juicy tomatoes fried in basil and thyme and Cajun deviled eggs, which contain Dijon, as an appetizer!  Great combination!  Great meal!  Great recipe!

I used yukon gold potatos and left the skins on and lightly mashed the potatos. I also used a herbed rosemary mustard that I bought at local Farm market. Thought it might go nicely with the pork I was serving.

We love this!  Just a nice touch to regular mash.  If you like mustard flavour & you loved mashed potatoes you will love this one!  Too easy!

Pretty good.  I used 4 med. potatoes and cooked 2 lg. cloves of diced garlic w/potatoes the last few min. of cooking.  I didn't measure the s.cream, just added maybe about 1/2 c.?  I also only added maybe around 1 T. spicy brown mustard.  I did stir in some milk before serving because it was a little too dry.  I also added some garlic powder.

We had some instant mashed potatoes that were horrable, and a little Dijon mustard was just what I needed to fix them, they went great with the Chicken I had prepared that night. Thanks!

These turned out wonderful!  My husband is a mashed potato snob, and just loved these.  I would add less milk next time, though, or adjust when mashing.  Thanks so much for sharing!

I thought I would love this since Mustard Potato Salad is one of my favorites.  However, the flavor didn't work for me or the rest of the family in mashed potatoes.  

The rating is just based on personal taste.  I'm glad that others enjoyed this.

I guess my taters were too small, so it turned out more whipped like than mashed. So next time, more taters! Good stuff.
