This is a wonderful recipe, easy and tasty.  I didn't have broccoli so used pasta instead, didn't have Classico so made my own garlicky Alfredo and it was probably not as healthy as this recipe but we licked the platter clean.

Loved this recipe!!! I picked  it as I had fish, broccoli and half and half.. I try to find recipes that I already have.most of the ingredients This was amazing. I did not stray from the original except I used roasted heart healthy  walnuts.  My husband was equally happy.. I made my own Alfredo sauce, using a recipe from the allrecipes site..  Don't hesitate to make this. It is a keeper.

This was absolutely wonderful! I made my own Alfredo otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  The presentation was beautiful also.

This is very flavorful and tasty. I had some trouble with my cod in that it lost most of its coating and totally fell apart, although I cooked it according to the directions. So presentation was a bit of a mess. Made my own Alfredo sauce, so that added some prep time and cut a few minutes from the cooking time. The combinations of flavors is very good. My daughter thought a little vinegar would have helped the broccoli. Maybe so. Any way, next time I will probably lower the cooking temp and time for the fish just a bit. Otherwise, very nice dish.

Awesome recipe! The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is that it uses bottled sauce. The only addition that I did was in using a splash of white wine to deglaze the pan after searing the fish. Thanks for sharing Baking Nana

I absolutely loved this recipe.  I have never thought of having an Alfredo sauce with pan-fried cod, and broccoli, and mushrooms, lol.  What an awesome combination.  I actually went the extra step and made a quick homemade Alfredo sauce recipe from this site.  Thanks for sharing this Nana.  It was probably too elegant for my kiddos, however. I will wait to make this again when I have adult guests over.  Thanks again.

This was a tasty and different way to eat fish. All the adults and the 7 year old liked it. 

I made this like the recipe but without the nuts or sugar and I used microwave in a bag broccoli florets.  I deglazed the pan after the mushrooms with some white wine. Plus I made my own Alfredo sauce using the Better Than Olive Garden Alfredo recipe on this site. The amount of salt and other seasonings will depend on your cheeses as well as personal taste. I used full-fat semi-soft mozzarella.

It wasn't hard to make the sauce along with this dish. While the mushrooms sweated I started the sauce. While the cream heated I deglazed the pan. Then I turned the heat off under that pan while I whisked the sauce. 

Next time I'll use more fish. (I now use 2 lbs for 3 adults and several kids.)

I've also made this without mushrooms, when I didn't have them. It's still good and every bite gets eaten.

This was delicious when it was fresh, but it didn't make for good leftovers. Next time I'll cut it in half  so we don't have leftovers. I used catfish.

I thought the best part of this was the idea for the combination. One of my daughters has scolded me in the past for buying Alfredo sauce. According to her, no one should EVER make something so simple and easy to make. Hmmmm...
Therefore, I made my own sauce, cooked the fish, cooked the broc, added some noodles that were not in the recipe and then realized (at 65) that I stink at trying to get everything finished, plated, and still hot at the same time. Kudos to the recipe donor for doing this efficiently. Oh well, practice makes perfect, right?

I will absolutely make this again! I made a couple of tiny changes. Didn't have any broccoli so I used kale sprouts. Also I prefer not to use canned or jarred food so I made a homemade sauce (look up Japanese Yum Yum sauce). I made everything else just as the recipe calls for and start to finish dinner was on the table in 35 minutes

Good. As another reviewer said, would have given 5 stars if they included an Alfredo sauce from scratch.  I did not have mushrooms, sauteed a yellow pepper with the broccoli and served the fish over couscous.  Very delicious. Will try it next time with mushrooms (did not have any on hand today).  Be sure the cod fillet is totally dry before coating with the cornstarch mixture.
