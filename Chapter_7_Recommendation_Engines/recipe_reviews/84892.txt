This recipe definitely has a few flaws.  The first is that the ingredients list calls for an egg, but the egg is not referenced in the directions.  I assume it should be slightly beaten, then added at the same time as the other wet ingredients.

The second problem is that the batter was VERY runny.  2 Tablespoons of vanilla seems like an awful lot.  Perhaps this should have been 2 teaspoons?  I've never seen a recipe that called for that much vanilla, so I'm guessing that's the source of the too-runny batter.

The pancakes did taste good.  I'll probably make them again, but use much less vanilla, and perhaps add the milk gradually to achieve proper consistency.

light and fluffy even with replacing 1/2 the a-p flour with whole wheat.  used egg beater,ff milk, and omitted the oil altogether.  When I stirred everything up, I was a bit leary, as the batter was very thin.  I let it sit for a few minutes for the w.w. to absorb more of the liquid.  It still was very thin but went ahead and they puffed up beautifully.  No sticking even with omitting the oil.  I couldn't really taste the sugar but perhaps because it was a bit heavy on the salt side; would perhaps cut salt in half.  I was brave and used 1 tbsp. of vanilla and it gave it a very nice flavor without being overwhelming.  Buttermilk could easily replace the reg. milk if one wishes.  Thanks for the quick and hearty breakfast recipe!

I loved this.  Being a teacher and now having summer to spend with my 1 yr old I am always trying to find something to get him to eat his breakfast in the morning.  We both ate this up right away.  He was a little bit mad that I didn't make more.  Will definately keep on file to use again.  Thanks for the post.

As is, I would have to give these 3 stars.  However, based on the reviewers comments and my own changes, these were a five-star breakfast!  I used only 1/2 C all-purpose flour and then subbed 1/2 C whole wheat flour.  I also added 1/4 C of ground flaxseed meal.  I also decreased the milk to only 3/4 C.  I omitted the oil altogther, used 1/4 C egg substitute to lighten things up, and believe it or not, I do think this requires the full 2 T of vanilla (which I thought was crazy at first, but I started with 2 t and after tasting the batter, I decided it needed a lot more...) and these turned out perfectly!

Very tasty, made the recipe as is.  Remember standard rules of pancakes: do not overmix and let stand a few minutes before cooking to allow baking powder to puff up.  Also, its usually better to add the fruit to the pancake after it is poured on the pan, it is much less soggy that way.

I'm a younger cook (13) and it always make me nervous trying recipes  I've never tried before. I always tweak the recipies I find on this site a little bit, and I found with these that if you add 2 table spoons of regular sugar instead of brown, and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon of vanilla, you get a much much better pancake! I also used about 1/2 cup more strawberries, and it made a big difference. I made small to medium sized pancakes, and it made about 20 of them, and my sister, who's a very picky eater, ate every one!!! I highly recommend this recipe!

I thought these pancakes were very good.  Definitely not too much vanilla and my batter was not too thin.  I made 12 pancakes and we will pop the leftovers in the toaster so they taste just as fresh as they did yesterday!  Thank you!!!

They're definitely good. The pancakes were not thin at all. I had never tried strawberry pancakes and I'll definitely be making them again. I did adjust the recipe, when I added the egg I made sure to beat it pretty well(helped the pancakes not be so thin?), 1/4 tp salt and 3 tb brown sugar(maybe 3.5 tb next time).

I give these a 5; my husband a 4.  They weren't thick enough for him but I like 'em thinner... I halved the vanilla... added some dashes of cinnamon; a dash of nutmeg... I sprinkled a little powdered sugar on the chopped up strawberries to make sure they were just a little sweeter.  I'm wondering about trying it with self-rising flour next time.  Overall, I thought the flavor was wunnerful!  Thanx for the recipe!

Overall, a good recipe. I would only change the amount of vanilla extract used. Instead of 2TB, I would go 3TB for more flavor, especially if you're using fresh strawberries. I've substituted blueberries in and that works quite well ...

I am going to give this 5 stars because I made very simple changes and they were delicious. Due to other reviews, I decreased vanilla to 1 TBS and it was plenty! I also gradually added the milk because I wanted a thicker consistency, so ended up probably using about 3/4C milk. Other than that I followed the recipe and used blueberries as my fruit. Delicious! Can't wait to make again tomorrow morning!

Followed the recipe to the T and these are GREAT . Thanks for sharing .           On my second attempt I  burned the pancake to a crisp . Sure  could blame the writer , But I forgot to set my timer . I was thinking how some haters jump to make a minor issue seem like the end of the world ,So haters, blend in your keyboards while you are cooking or baking. enough hating in the world  Suck it up buttercup and Shut up . Thanks for sharing my favorite pancakes recipe. Lyle

So good. This recipe doesn't need any alterations! It's pancakes, not rocket science. I made this to use up leftover strawberries. I burned the pancakes and they still tasted good :)

These were pretty good but the batter was a little too thin. It wouldn't stay in a circular shape when scooped into the skillet, so I ended up with some pretty oddly shaped, very thin (I definitely wouldn't call them 'fluffy' like it says in the description) pancakes that were kind of difficult to flip over. If your batter seems thin, I would suggest making small pancakes as they'll be easier to control and flip, and some of the larger ones I made I had an issue with them not cooking through, especially around the chunks of strawberry (I probably should have chopped into smaller pieces, but the recipe didn't really indicate how small the pieces should be). The taste was fine though, not anything I'd rave about, but no complaints and I would try it again. I was going to make a strawberry sauce to serve on top but I didn't have end up having enough usable strawberries so I made Vanilla Honey Simple Syrup from this site and that was a good pairing.

Awesome. I made a few modifications to make these a bit healthier. Used half ww flour and omitten the oil. I also used blackberries instead of strawberries, they had gone bad:(, the blackberries worked great though. Great recipe that we will use often. Thanks!

These pancakes are fantastic.  They're my favorite way to use up the bags full of strawberries I get when I go berry-picking.  2 tbs of vanilla is a little overwhelming (I did try it), but 1 tbs is just right.  Also, be sure to chop the strawberries very small (less than 1/2-inch dice), or you will get raw spots in your pancakes.

The pancakes came out light and fluffy despite of how runny the mix was,  which doesn't bother me anyway. However, I sort of made up my own recipe by making these alterations. I cut the cup of all purpose flour in half and added 1/2 cup if whole wheat flour. I also used almond extract instead of vanilla. My taste buds prefer the almond extract with strawberries over the vanilla. Waaaaay too much salt.  I put in the teaspoon of salt but it was overpowering, so the next time I make these, I will cut it down by half.

We eat this all the time. Best combination is to put whipped cream infused with cardamom on top. Possibly the greatest breakfast we need to have at least once a month now.

The batter is too thin, there is too much vanilla for my taste in this recipe, and the color from the vanilla is unappetizing. The recipe should have called for more flour and only 1 T. or less of clear vanilla. What redeemed this dish was Chef John's Fresh Strawberry Sauce.

These were very good, my family ate them all! I would say they need a little more sugar, but that could depend on how sweet your strawberries are.

Love these pancakes.  The fresh strawberries go so well with the vanilla flavor in these.  Served these with whipped cream and some sliced fresh strawberries, and they were delicious.  Will keep this one for sure!

LOVE this!! I was leery of how the strawberries would be, but they were amazing. I actually use the batter for all of my pancakes now. I absolutely love how sweet they are just as normal pancakes or for blueberry!

I made these today for breakfast and they are really good. I will defiantly make these again. I followed the direction and took some of the reviewers advice also. I only used 2 tsp. of vanilla. The only problem I had was that they stuck to my pan even with the non stick cooking spray, but the only thing that really got stuck were the strawberry's so next time I think I will slice them super thin not chop them.

These are *very* good. I used skim milk because we never have whole on hand and my batter was pretty thick and the pancakes were a bit heavy, but i think that suits this recipe...it's almost like dessert! Thanks for a good recipe.

These were really good.  The fresh strawberries really added to the flavor.  Only real complaint is that they are very dark due to the large amount of vanilla.  Make sure to wait until the baking powder has time to react to ensure nice light and fluffy pancakes.

Good flavor.  But would probably omit the oil as others have said.  Had the same slightly runny problem.  Also, decrease vanilla to teaspoons.

After eating in complete silance, I asked the boys (husband and 12 yr old son), "Well, how did you like the pancakes?" - hubby said, "I thought they were really really good, possibly the best pancakes you ever made" My son said "oh, yeah, these were the best". I made mostly as written, 2TBSP vanilla was no problem, yes it was rather thin, but as most said, it fluffed right up. My only hiccup - when it was time to put in the vegetable oil, oops, I don't have any, no canola either.....ummmmm...ok, well I added one TBSP of melted butter (didn't want to do two, just in case it really screwed up the recipe)....no problem, tasted great as stated earlier.

These were amazing!  We liked them best with the strawberries on top instead of inside. The batter is runny like crepe batter, but fluff up like pancakes.

I made these following the recipe exactly and they deserve 5 stars. After that, I adjusted the recipe to our taste -- half white flour and half whole wheat, and plain yogurt instead of milk and they came out great. They have the texture of recipes where the eggs are separated and the whites whipped.

Really good!  We had some half-and-half to use up, so that replaced the milk and only used 1T vanilla (which was plenty).  Very nice, fluffy texture.

I had concerns about 2 tbsp of vanilla, so I used just one.  You definitely could taste the vanilla in the pancakes, and 2 tbsp would have been too dominant for us (just a taste preference).  The batter consistency was pretty runny, so I did add a bit more flour, otherwise, followed the recipe as written.  I wanted pancakes that had some height, and next time, I'll actually add more flour.  The strawberries really add moisture to the pancakes, and they had just the right amount of sweetness.

These are a hit in my house!  I have made them several times.  My in-laws especially love them when they come to visit.  I always also add bananas along with the strawberries, and I have added a little flour in the past to thicken up the batter.  Also tried with some cinnamon and nutmeg in the batter, and it was delicious.  Try them with whipped cream instead of maple syrup, too.  Very tasty!

Accidentally left out the oil, and only had 1 T of vanilla on hand. My 8 year olds rated them "special and delicious," and I didn't miss the oil at all. Without the oil, the batter was the consistency I expect from pancake batter. Using 1/2 C scoop, this made 7 filling pancakes.

These were good. I doubled the recipe and followed it exactly except didn't put in as much oil. The batter was thin and lumpy but they did fluff up without issue. Everyone liked them.

These are some delicious pancakes!  I used all 2 tbsp of vanilla and found it to be the perfect amount for my pancakes.  As with all pancake recipes I try, I just added the milk gradually until the batter became the consistency that I prefer.  These are very tasty and well worth trying!

Well, another pancake recipe my 'pancake averse' daughter just raved over! I made these as written, but used 1% buttermilk for the milk. The vanilla and strawberry combination was divine. The pancake batter was not thin for me as it was for some, probably due to the buttermilk. In fact, I had to add an extra 1/4 cup. They were fluffy and beautiful. Top with whip cream and a sprinkle of nutmeg. Thanks for giving us a wonderful new option for breakfast!

This is a great base recipe for pancakes. I didn't include the strawberry jam b/c I just wanted an easy, good pancake recipe. I agree with another review that 1 tsp salt is too much. I used 1/4 tsp and it was significantly better. I also used spelt flour instead, as I have a gluten-wheat intolerance.  Thanks!

My family loved these.  I had lots of very ripe strawberries after a trip to the farmer's market and found this recipe on an ingredient search.  I have a family of pancake lovers and decided to try this.  I did use half spelt flour and a combination of white sugar and sucanat and added an extra couple of tablespoons.  I used double-strength vanilla and used the full amount (we LOVE vanilla!).  It was perfect for us.  The really ripe strawberries are nice and sweet in these...I don't think I would add them if they aren't super ripe, though.  I served with more strawberries that I tossed with agave nectar.  Delicious and very light and fluffy.  I doubled the recipe and had many pancakes!  I froze the leftovers in plastic bags with parchment paper between the pancakes.

The batter was runny but they were good.  I didn't rate it higher only because I didn't get to taste them.  I served them at an impromptu family breakfast gathering and everyone said they were great.  My husband really liked them and he doesn't like fruit inside things or cooked.  For him to say they are his new favorite summer time pancakes that means a lot.

Yummmm!  I omitted the oil as it doesn't need it and reduced the vanilla to 2 tsp added 1/2 banana (sliced) instead of strawberry.  Very light and fluffy.  Hubby loved it and so did I!

An excellent basic pancake recipe with simple ingredients. I was in a bind because the little ones wanted pancakes for breakfast, but I had no buttermilk or baking soda. So I found this recipe, which calls for regular milk and no baking soda. I didn't add the strawberries, but otherwise I followed the recipe. It made very nice pancakes. I added more flour because we like thick pancakes, and the six of us loved them. I no longer need to worry about buttermilk and baking soda. Next time I will add strawberries.

The vanilla is way too much, I used less than half the amount specified. Salt not really needed in my opinion. Not as fluffy as I was expecting as the batter was very runny, too wet. I will make again with my own modifications though. They were good with extra strawberry jam on top and sprinkled with confectioner's sugar.

I thought these pancakes were delicious.  I was afraid that they would not completely cook around the strawberries but they were fine.  I did cut the vanilla to 2 teaspoons and the salt to only 1/2 teaspoons.  I had a bumper crop of strawberries and will be making them again. Thanks for the recipe

Good flavor, but batter was very runny.  I think something is off in the recipe.

This was fantastic! I used fresh strawberries from the garden, and followed the advice of some other reviewers by reducing the vanilla to two teaspoons. My wife and I loved them! We will definately be doing this one more with our surplus strawberries! Don't forget to add the egg though.

I tried this recipe out, and it was great. This is a great way to use your fresh strawberries! It was nice a fluffy, and it was gooey and nice juicy on the inside filled with strawberries. I had to add a little more flour because the batter was a little runny, but once it got thickened up, it was great and easy to make. You can also make changes to this recipe and instead of adding strawberries, you can add a different fruit, like blueberries. I even tried it plain! It tasted like a nice sweet vanilla pancake. I definitely hope you try this recipe out, because it's a really great one!

Impressive. I did reduce the salt and Vanilla by 1/2 but other than that left everything else alone. Tasted great. Yes the batter is runny, but so what, they cook up fine and the end result is a full pancake. In fact I'm now thinking the thin batter is what keeps them light and fluffy.

It's a good recipe overall.  I've made it twice.  Once with puréed strawberries & quick cooking oats and another with puréed mangos.  Both times were delicious & toddler approved.  My two mischievous monkeys enjoyed cooking with mommy.  We make a bunch & freeze for later in the week for those crazy rushed mornings.

My family loved these pancakes.  I used vanilla almond milk in place of regular milk and that added even more vanilla flavor.  I only used a 1/4 tsp of salt.  They were very fluffy and very flavorful.

One reviewer said the egg is not included in the direction-but it is. I agree with that reviewer that the batter was VERY watery; however, since these are called Vanilla pancakes, using less vanilla extract really doesn't seem to be the logical answer. Adding more flour, however, does. I added a whole cup of flour, making it 2 cups total. I also opted to use cake flour, something I picked up from a different pancake recipe. Do not over whisk pancakes. That is kind of the first cardinal rule. It is difficult to know if you over whisked, but if batter is slightly lumpy, you probably didn't. If upon flipping the pancakes, the rise slightly, you will know they are light and fluffy! I thought the recipe overall was great! One of the tastier recipes I have found, with minimal tweeks.

My daughter ate these up, but I didn't care for them at all. Too salty-I would reduce that or eliminate it altogether. I used applesauce in place of the oil.

Yummy with strawberry pancakes! But, if you make it with fresh berries, the strawberries do tend to give off a lot of juice.

I made up this batter for my dad when he had to have a test done and couldn't have his normal breakfast of cerial. His  favorite flavor is vanilla. So for a change of pace I made this for him. He liked it and so did I.

I had to triple the recipe (without tripling the salt) to make it so that it wasn't too salty. Holy cow, it was salty! Also, instead of using milk, I used leftover strawberry smoothie (kefir with strawberries blended in), and I used a mix of oat flour and brown rice flour. I also added a little cinnamon. With all these changes, it then tasted good.

I don't usually review the recipes I make but these pancakes were delicious! I made them as a special breakfast for my 9 year old son & he loved them! He ate 2. The first with chocolate syrup and the other just as it was bc they are so good as they are that they don't need syrup. The only change I made was reducing the vanilla to 1 TBS. I WILL BE MAKNG THESE AGAIN

I followed several users suggestions:

- Used only 2/3 cup of milk
- Used 2 tsp (NOT tbl) of Vanilla
- Replaced vegetable oil with unsweetened apple sauce
- Used 100% wheat flour.

DELISH!!!!

These seemed more like crepes than pancakes.  I wasn't a huge fan of the strawberries cooked into the pancakes either.  The taste was all right, but I will stick with my strawberries on top of pancakes in the future.

I thought they were dry.  You are better off taking the buttermilk pancake recipe and adding vanilla and strawberries.  Thank you anyway, though!

I don't know why anyone would use boxed pancake mix. This recipe was great. I made them without the strawberries inside. We put them on top instead.

I only had one bad reaction to this recipe - she made a face and spit it out.  She was 2. I love these pancakes and make them as often as I can!!

Good idea.....but ingredient measurements...way off.  Too much vanilla, too much salt, batter very runny....this recipe has potential, but I will need to play around with it.  Next time I will try 1/2 the vanilla, substituting half the milk with vanilla yogurt, and much less salt....

Easy to make and they tasted great.  My family was eating them as fast as they could and there were no left overs.  We used soy milk because of allergies but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  We will definitely make them again during strawberry season.  It was well worth the expense for strawberries in the winter though.  We used maple syrup on some and cream and strawberries on others.

These pancakes were spectacular.  I added a tablespoon of wheat germ and substituted blueberries for the strawberries.  They were gone in a flash!

These were good- I used half ww flour, half white, and 1/2 tsp salt, and no oil. I do think that there was too much strawberries though- it made the cooked pancake seem raw it was so gooey with berries...next time I will only do a 1/2 cup. Yummy though, thanks.

These were wonderful!  I used 3/4 c of milk, just 1 tbs vegetable oil and 1 tbs of vanilla, just a dash of salt and extra brown sugar.  I had NO problems with them being runny or thin, they were very fluffy and delicious.  As a side note, I prepared these with bluberries the first time because my little girl requested them.  But both she and I agreed they are MUCH better prepared with strawberries!  The flavor is just so much better.  Thanks for the great recipe Kristi!  Oh, and also thanks to Beba for the toaster trick to rewarming the pancakes.  Worked like a charm!

This review is based on the recipe "as is"  WAY WAY too much salt- they were inedible.  Cut the salt way back and use 1/2 the milk, and they have some potential.  I'll try again with modifications because they kinda smelled like strawberry shortcake when cooking and my son loves anything strawberry, but I would NOT recommend making this as per the recipe.

I agree, too much salt, I would cut back to half the amount. I liked the addition of vanilla and brown sugar to this recipe, it really added another level of flavor to the pancakes. You could easily add blueberries in place of the strawberries.

Way too salty!I got all excited to make homemade pancakes, took the effort to chop up the strawberries than had to throw away the whole batch on account for the salt. Next time 1/2 teaspoon at the most than the recipe will turn out just fine. Well now I have to wash a lot of dishes on account of my mess, but at least my b/f said it was the thought that counts.

I made these exactly according to the recipe . Too much salt. Not enough sweet. Too much milk made them kinda lumpy and uneven in the pan. My boy enjoyed them but thought the strawberries didn't match the rest of the flavor. I found them to be pretty much inedible. They might eb improved with less salt and more sugar, but I'm not trying this one again.

These were good and my boys ate them up, which is huge since they are picky eaters. As everyone said the batter is very thin, but they rise very nicely to a nice thick pancake. I did cut the salt down by half and didn't even notice. This is a great way to use strawberries when they are in season! Thanks for the recipe!

These were really light and fluffy.  My batter was somewhat runny so I added two more tablespoons of flour.  I used the suggested amount of vanilla and thought they were really good.  My kids were happy and surprised to get such a nice breakfast on a weekday.

Wow these were great and a good change from blueberry pancakes.  I only added 1 tablespoon of vanilla as other reviewers suggested and am glad I did.  One word of warning, the recipe said it served 4 but I was only able to get 5 six inch pancakes which in my family barely fed 3 people.  I would double it for 4 people.

This was a delicious recipe, I couldn't get the pancakes off the griddle and cooled fast enough for my family!  Changes made: soured the milk with lemon juice, 2 TBS applesauce for the oil, reduced salt to 1/4 tsp, increased brown sugar to 3 TBS and added a dash of cinnamon.  I let the batter sit for about 5 minutes and it thickened up nicely.

I'm always looking for recipes with a surprising twist, and strawberry pancakes fit the bill nicely.  The basic recipe is identical to the one I've used for years, but it wouldn't have occurred to me to add strawberries and vanilla.  I always substitute whole wheat pastry flour, and I'll admit I chickened out on the colossal quantity of vanilla.  (I cut it in half and felt that was plenty.)  The batter did need to sit for just a few minutes to thicken up (which is just a matter of the baking powder doing its thing).  The teenage boys to whom I served them were enthusiastic, and I enjoyed the two leftover cakes even without any syrup.  They didn't really need it!  Can't wait to make these again.

For me, this recipe was unedible ... I reviewed it several times to make sure I did not do anything wrong, and sure enough I followed it exactly as it said. I found this recipe while looking for pancake recipes because I wanted something simple but good to fix for dinner tonight. When I saw this one I thought it sounded wonderful so decided to make it, and I had just picked fresh strawberries the day before so I thought it would be a perfect way to use them. When I first read the recipe I thought to myself that it was an awful lot of salt for just 4 servings, and I double checked it to make sure that's what it said, and it did, so I went ahead and put what it called for. Also when I got done mixing the batter it was very runny, which made me question again whether I had done everything right... I went ahead and cooked the first 2 and got them done and onto a plate, started cooking the next 2 and decided to take a taste of the first ones I'd cooked. They were SO salty they were unedible, and just did not have a good flavor overall. I like for my pancakes to be on the sweeter side but these were not sweet at all. Disappointing :(

I hate to give a low rating but it is only because something seems amiss with the batter.  These are so runny.  I followed the directions exactly and had a hard time especially flipping them.  I waited for them to bubble up and still had trouble.  The two pancakes in my photo are the only ones that I got flipped without a mess.  The flavor is excellent though.  I will not make this particular recipe again.

Good pancakes.  My family liked it.  I made the following adjustments:  1/2 cup wheat flour and 1/2 cup white flour (instead of all white flour).  1.5t baking powder instead of 2t added 0.5t baking soda  Added 1t apple sauce instead of the oil. Added 1t of brown sugar. Added 1t of vanilla. Added 0.25t salt. Added 0.75 cup of milk.  I took about 1/3 cup of strawberries and added some powdered sugar.  I added these strawberries on top of the pancakes (along with maple syrup).

These are excellent! I served them with Strawberry Syrup from this site. I used half as much sugar as called for and thus also half as much salt, because I do that with every recipe pretty much. Factor in that the sugar I do use is half sugar, half Splenda, for those of you who seek healthier diets! I replaced all of the oil in this recipe with 1/2 c. of applesauce, and I used butter-flavored spray to cook the pancakes. I used only half the vanilla the recipe called for but only because I don't generally like it as much as other people, not because I thought 2 tbsp. was too much. Changing the oil (and butter) out for applesauce (and cooking spray) causes my pancakes to cook up darker than they would otherwise, but that isn't a fault of the recipe! This is a 5 star recipe even AFTER I removed all the fat and 75% of the sugar! I confess to eyeballing the milk and adding gradually because I've learned from experience now that liquid ratios can vary hugely from day to day depending on humidity and how your food was stored (frozen flour, for example, is "wetter" than flour which has never been frozen), etc. To anyone who is thinking about skipping this recipe because the #1 reviewer had thin batter--don't. Add your liquids gradually and quit when it looks right and give this recipe another chance :)

These were really tasty. I was scared at first because the batter was really thin. But they came out so good. And even better than that the kids didn't think they needed syrup! Love that. Thanks.

My family loved these!  The only thing that keeps this from being 5 star is that the batter was quite runny.  We like our pancakes a little thicker, beside it's easier to deal with on a griddle when the batter's thicker.

This is a definite keeper for pancake lovers. My 10 year old daughter made these as her first ever pancake making experience and even having a 1st timer make this recipe, the pancakes turned out great! Tender and fluffy. These are so good with the amount of vanilla and strawberries already in them that you can skip syrup!

This recipe was a pleasant change from the ordinary traditional pancakes I usually make. I wouldn't say I liked them enough to make them exlusively , but once in awhile is a nice treat.  btw... 2 Tbsp. of vanilla is perfect !

These sure sounded fantastic, but unfortunately they weren't as good as they sounded. I just wasn't impressed and I am a strawberry fanatic. I enjoyed trying out a new meal, so thanks!

Really good, however I did make a few drastic changes. After finishing, even while skimping on the vanilla a bit (only about 1/4 tsp is what I skipped), I added another tablespoon of unbleached flour (which is what I used throughout) and skipped the strawberries (mine were frozen and I forgot to thaw!) however added the zest of a whole orange along with the juice (just by squeezing, so I didn't use all of the juice). Probably one of the best pancake recipes I've tasted. Thanks!

I made these for my mom and myself this morning. I used 1 tsp salt, walnut oil, I was out of baking powder so I used 1 tsp baking soda and 1 tsp lemon juice, about 3/4 cup milk, tsp each of vanilla and almond extract. As we were eating, we wondered what they'd be like if we added white chocolate chips to the batter....Certainly not breakfast fare, but sounds yummy.

I give this 4 stars mostly for the delicious vanilla flavor. As another reviewer mentioned, I think these would be great even without the strawberries.

This was great! Sadly, i didnt have any strawberries so instead i substituted cinnamon for them. It worked out really well, although when strawberries are in season, i'll definitly add those! Oh and one more thing for everyone out there who likes to lick the spoon - cinnamon batter is disgusting!! Otherwise, very good recipe!

My kids wanted breakfast for dinner and I had some strawberries that needed to get used up, so this was perfect!  Per several reviewers' suggestions, I reduced the salt by half, which seemed to be perfect.  I also added mini semi-sweet chocolate chips and topped the pancakes with whipped topping.  I'll definitely make these again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

These were SO yummy!

I used white sugar instead of brown and 
used buttermilk. These were light and fluffy and the diced strawberries were a nice contrast against the buttermilk. 

My kids loved them, too. I'll make these
again when I've got strawberries I've 
got to use or lose.

I did not like these at all.  I must've done something wrong, because they came out tasting rubbery and bland.  I did cut back on the vanilla (as some have suggested) but I can't think that made a difference in the rubbery texture.

This recipe made a pretty decent pancake. I  mixed the "wet" ingredients together and then added them to the dry mixture. If you are looking for a sweet pancake recipe, this is not for you.

I used a bit more flour and about a 1/2 tsp. of salt.  These pancakes were pretty good, but thin and very moist, even with having added the extra flour.

I thought this was a great recipe for a quick and easy breakfast. I usually use the "just add water" and foud this to be a good sub.
Only problem we had was the serving amount. This served just my 5 yr. old and I. I would def. double the recipe next time.

This is a great pancake!  My batter was actually quite thick, which is fine with me.  I used buttermilk instead of regular milk and only 1 tbsp of vanilla.  Also only 1/4 tsp of salt.  Delicious!

Pretty good! I did make some modifications though, I used half of the vanilla, half of the baking powder and only a pinch of salt. I added a bit more flower to the batter too because I was worried it would be a little runny but it turned out fine. I only added about a tablespoon. I snuck some extra strawberries too :D My fiance thinks I'm weird, but I put a little peanut butter on them and it was very tasty!

These were pretty good pancakes. I used half the vanilla and half the salt and my batter came out fine. They aren't too sweet but they aren't bland either. They have a hint of strawberry and even with half the vanilla it could still be tasted.

Great pancakes.  I reduced vanilla to 1 Tbsp, added cinnamon and added a Tbsp of granulated sugar to sweeten it up.  Using a 1/4 cup to ladle batter, it made 14 pancakes.  Everyone gobbled it up!

These pancakes were great!  I followed the recipe EXACTLY and they turned out sweet and fluffy.  I agree with others that the batter seemed a little thin but once I got them in the pan they fluffed right up!  A real hit with my kids!

Pretty good - not great, but good.  Strawberries were kind of sour compared to the rest of the pancake - next time I think I will leave the strawberries out - I think this would make delicious vanilla pancakes

This recipe sounded delicious, but I was very disappointed. The pancakes were very thin, and didn't have as much flavor as I expected.

These were wonderful pancakes.  My kids loved them.  However, I think it calls for too much salt, so I only added 1/4 tsp.  I also added 2 tbsp vanilla yogurt and just 1 tbsp. oil.  I cut the vanilly in half to just 1 tbsp.  Since my kids don't really like fruit in the pancakes, I omitted that and had a side dish of strawberries cut up for them to put on top.  Thank you for a great recipe!

I agree that there is way too much vanilla in the recipe, considering most baking recipes call for 1/4 - 1/2 teaspoon.  The first time I made these, 
they were runny and salty.  The second time, I cut out all the salt, used vanilla soy milk to replace the milk and vanilla, and added another few Tblsp. of flour to thicken it up.  The results were much better!

Being a novice - and no indication of what to put egg, I got confused and put with milk, oil etc.  They turned out good - not too runny at all in my case - in fact, a little thick where 1st one didn't cook all the way thru!  I followed as directed and really enjoyed them.

I'm sorry but these just didn't work for me. I admit I'm not a great pancake maker so this might have been down to user error but I don't usually end up with a gooey mess. I tried everything 2 different pans, more butter less butter but couldn't get anything that was edible. I'm sure others will have more luck. Thanks for letting me try.

My husband loved this recipe!  It's a great way to sneak fruit into my kid's breakfast, too!  They were a bit thin, so I added more flour to the batter, but they still turned out great.

These were really very good, however I too think the listed amounts of vanilla  and salt are way tooooooo much.  I used 2 tsp instead (vanilla) and that was sufficient.  Will make these whenever I have fresh strawberries to use up.  Thanks!

The vanilla is over powering, I would scale back to 2 teaspoons.  Batter is meant be runny. Fluffy, good even without any fruit added, but add 2 tablespoons of regular sugar.

I used blueberries instead of strawberry s . They turn out really good . My son-in-law , daughter & grandkids enjoy them a lot . This year I'm thinking about using pineapple & cherries in them . My daughter B-Day is on the 4 th of July . That will be a special B-Day breakfast for her this year .

I used coconut oil and heavy whipping cream instead of milk and vegetable oil. I also topped them with cream cheese. These pancakes are really good, though I strongly recommend using coconut oil!

Family & friends love them. I also slice 3-4c. strawberries in a separate container the night before with  1/2c. sugar & 1c. Pure Maple Syrup. Stir together until sugar is dissolved to make a strawberry maple syrup.  Just heat it to room temp the next morning. Pour over Strawberry Pancakes...YUM ??

5 stars cause they are good! I followed the recipe to the T and was sceptical because it was very thin. About half way through the batter I added a little more flour and ended up burning most of the rest. A commenter said to let the batter rest (I didn't know this) so I will do that next time. I will also spread out the middle so the middle will cook better. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe. It's really good! Never had brown sugar in pancakes before.

I used evaporated milk instead of whole milk and only used 1 tbsp of vanilla as others suggested that 2 would be overkill. These turned out great. I added the strawberries to the mix at the end so they weren't too soggy when I ate the pancakes. I thought the recipe wouldn't make very many, but it made 5 average- to large-sized pancakes, which was perfect for me and my husband (no need for leftovers). Definitely saving this recipe.

Worst pancake recipe I've ever made. Batter is too thin and runs all over the skillet, even after the skillet is heated. They don't get fluffy and cook unevenly. Don't waste your time or ingredients.

I made this Strawberry Pancake for my sister birthday and SHE LOVED IT. So does my mom, haha. It was perfect, while I was cooking it the smell was super delicious. 
I give this recipe 5 stars. 
I didn't change a thing, I just shift the flower twice. I set the batter aside for like 15 mins before I start pouring it in the hot pan. The only thing I did was I sweeten the strawberries with 1/2 cup sugar to bring out it's natural juice.  Then I add that juice to my pancake batter, because of that the flavor was little stronger which my sister liked it a lot. 
Over all very successful recipe, loved it, can't wait to make is again.

I did not make any changes. The batter was more like crepe batter than pancake batter. It had a nice flavor but was difficult to flip. I made this recipe because my 7 yr old grandson saw the picture on my phone and he nagged me until I made them. Then he didn't like  them. I may try them again but cook them in my crepe pan.  Next time I will try the "fluffy pancake recipe".

I made it first by placing the strawberries after I poured some on the griddle, and the second time by folding the strawberries into the mixture.  Folding them in was definitely better.  If was a fluffy recipe!  It was salty tasting to me.  It was just okay.

Really good, I made it with the Splenda brown sugar blend and instead of 2 tablespoons of vanilla I only used 2 teaspoons.  It was still fantastic, my daughter was so thrilled, she kept wanting more.   Great recipe.  I might have to try it without the oil too.

I wish the recipe gave guidelines for how long it takes to brown on both sides. For me, one side ended up burnt, and the other side ended up undercooked.

These were so moist and fluffy-- really beautiful texture. You couldn't ask for more moist pancakes! I upped the brown sugar to 3T and dropped the vanilla a bit to 1.5T, and sifted the flour. I didn't find the batter to be extremely runny, like some other reviewers, but letting it sit for a few minutes before adding to the pan is crucial. Also, I chopped up the strawberries and let them sit on a paper towel, to let any excess liquid soak off, until I was just about ready to use the batter, and then mixed them in. Try these-- you won't regret it! Thanks for a great pancake recipe! =)

Tasted delicious! I changed the measurement of the vanilla from tablespoons to teaspoons though because it seemed like too much vanilla.

Use egg whites when making pancakes. It helps make them fluffier and goats milk gives that extra yummy taste. These turned out amazing with just those two changes!

This was wonderful!  And so easy to make. Only substitution I made was to use real maple syrup for the sugar. Used whole milk and mostly organic
Ingredients. Next time I'm going to try it with almond flour and almond milk but the original is definitely wonderful. 2 T of vanilla sounded like a lot but turned out to be just perfect. I also made a topping by cooking down sliced strawberries, a touch of maple syrup and a tiny bit of water.   Thanks so much for sharing!

I would have given this recipe a 5 except the cakes were too thin for my liking. Taste was delicious though.  I substituted 1 TBLSPN of brown sugar Splenda for the 2 TBLSPN of regular Brown Sugar and 2 TBLSPN of applesauce for the oil. My kids devoured them.

Very good!  Just made them for the kids and I; they were a hit.  Batter was a bit watery so I did add at least 1/4c extra flour.  They had the consistency of crepes, but I still served as pancakes.  Recommended!

Mmmmm...  I used whole grain white flour, added one more T sugar and only did 1/2 t salt per previous reviews.  The batter did seem thin, but they fluffed up so nicely!

I've made these for years with just the box mix. Has always been a favorite in my house. Also optional is adding a tsp of cinnamon or get really crazy and add a pinch of lavender.

A bit too salty for me... I had to increase the amount of sugar by another tablespoon. I also used whole wheat flour so the batter wasn't runny as others had problems with. I ate it with honey and it was just alright for a quick treat in the morning.

Good. The batter was a bit thin, but isn't a big deal if you make the pancakes a bit smaller than usual. The 2 TBS of vanilla was excessive to me not because it was too much vanilla flavor but because you end up tasting the alcohol of the extract since it's so heavy. I'd cut back on that a bit next time, but otherwise fine as is. They'd also be fine with 1/2 all-purpose flour and 1/2 whole wheat.

Good but next time I may sprinkle some sugar on the strawberries and let set for several minutes.

The recipe is delicious! I prefer my pancakes thick and fluffy, so I added a little more flour to the batter. They have a great flavor and make your entire kitchen smell like fresh strawberries.

I used self rising flour instead of the ap flour and baking powder and it turned out fabulously. I followed the directions otherwise and although the batter was runny I let it sit for a couple minutes before cooking it. That did thicken it up some but I don't like super thick batter anyway so this was perfect for me. I will definitely be making these again!

Too salty! Salt is not a flavor, it is a flavor enhancer and helps baked goods rise. I questioned the amount of salt but thought maybe it was to help the pancakes rise. Nope...thin, flat, salty pancakes were what we got. Won't be using this recipe again. I'll try adding vanilla to a pancake batter mix to get the same flavor. I don't like cooked strawberries, so we sliced them and used them as a topping.

My daughter does not like chunks of fruit in her food, so we liquified the strawberries in a blender.  

I gave it four stars because we had to tweak a lot of things-we added more sugar, had to slowly add the vanilla (2 Tablespoons seemed like too much-we added 2.5 teaspoons).

We will make this again!

These are great!  Made the recipe as is, but chose to reduce salt.  This is a thin batter......and due to the moisture in the strawberries, they can be slightly soggy.  Made a triple batch and will freeze the remaining pancakes.  Yummy!

I give this 4 stars because i believe it's a good concept but some changes are necessary to make it great! I used 3/4 cp of whole wheat flour and substituted buttermilk, ommitted the oil and only used 2 TSP of vanilla. After doing that these turned out to be some of the BEST pancakes i've ever made!! They were not runny at all. I have never tried putting strawberries in pancakes but they were delicious with a little bit of maple syrup. I will be trying these again!

I liked this recipe taste wise,  but I found that I needed almost two cups of flour instead of the listed one. Without the extra flour, they were runny and didn't cook well. Other than that, they were yummy :)

Yummy pancakes! My toddler loved these. I pulsed my strawberries in a blender a few times and added a little extra sugar so they were sweet enough for her to eat without syrup. Very good!

While I enjoyed these pancakes, I do think you could cut back on the vanilla extract just a bit. The pancakes tasted great with maple syrup, but I also think they tasted even better with fresh strawberries and Reddi Wip Whipped Topping!

I doubled the recipe to accommodate my family, omitted the oil . I found these pancakes to be runny in the middle, even though they weren't very thick. The flavour was really good but there is definitely room for improvement.

It was very good. I made stuffed pancakes. I used cream cheese and marshmallow fluff for the stuffing. The mixture of the 2 sounds terrible but it is great.

super yum.  have made it exactly as done a few times.  Now I try to cut down on my all purpose flour, so for a doubled recipe I used 1 c whole wheat pastry flour, 1/2 cup all purpose flour, 1/4 cup quinoa flour and 1/4 cup white bean flour.  With doubling the recipe for 1 adult, a 5 yo and a 2 yo there were only 3 pancakes left.  I need to remember to start quadrupling the recipe to have leftovers, plus I need to remember to cut the strawberries smaller for easier cooking.

I made a very yummy and slightly healthier version of this recipe: 1/2 c. white flour, 1/3 c. whole wheat, 1/4 c. ground flax seed, same amount of brown sugar, baking powder, 3/4 tsp. salt, 2 eggs, 1 c. milk, no veg. oil, 1 1/2 tbsp. vanilla extract. 3/4 c. fresh strawberries and 1/3 c. semi-sweet chocolate chips.   These were amazing! Thanks for the basic recipe. I love how it can be altered and still work! Yummy!

I only made 2 changes to this recipe and it was a hit... I just deleted the oil and added a bit of organic yogurt for extra protein... It is loved here... Oh and add a little chocolate chips or shaving and you can get the kids to eat anything ;)

These pancakes were pretty yummy. Definetely too much salt, i will use half of what the recipe calls for. Also will use half of the vanilla, 2 tbl is just too much vanilla. I added 3/4 c chopped pecans...i love nuts in my pancakes. I will probably use blueberries instead of strawberries to mix things up a little. I rated the recipe 3 stars because i made it as is, except for the pecans, but with what i know now next time I make them they will be 5 star for sure!!

Very good, but if you omit the brown sugar like I did, make sure you scale down the salt dramatically. It was WAY to salty the way I did it.

I really liked these! It's easy and quick. I used frozen strawberries, steamed them and then chopped them into smaller pieces. They were great!

This recipe turned out to be a disaster! I followed every measurement and all of the instructions but my pancakes turned out very thin, and they weren't even fluffy! The bottom of the pancakes were kind of watery also. I will NOT be trying this recipe again!

I made this for the first time minus the strawberries because I didn't have them.  Now I think I am stuck making them from scratch forever. This is a fantastic recipe.

Love this recipe!  We have made this recipe many Saturday mornings since discovering it.  I usually stick to the recipe except I use about 1 tablespoon of vanilla, mix in 1 egg white that has been beaten to have stiff peaks, and sometimes mix in blueberries and/or banana.  Many have commented on how runny the batter is; I was startled the first time I made the recipe as well but decided to try it as stated, and it was fantastic!

Ok - from many of the reviews I was reluctant to even try this recipie. Based on what others have done, I modified by not adding any oil and reducing salt in half. My kids didn't want the strawberries either - but WOW. These had to be the BEST pancakes we've ever eaten. As mentioned by others, the batter was a little thin, but I kind of liked it that way.  Only thing I did note - the recipie says to use a greased pan. Having a non stick pan that works great for pancakes, I didn't do this. Big mistake. After my first batch I let the pan cool off, coated it with some spray and voila - perfect pancakes that the kids couldn't get enough of.  Oh - and as for the vanilla - use the 2 TABLE spoons full - perfect!

Just made this for "Brinner" and my family loved it.  I didn't use all the oil that it called for.  I just poured a little in the batter.  Very good!  We will make them again.

I used 3/4 cups of milk, 3 tbs of brown sugar and no oil at all (per the advice of other readers) and I thought they were awesome.  I've never made pancakes from scratch before and I thought they were great.  I also added a few chocolate chips in some of them which went over really well with the kids!

I cooked 1 pancake and it was too thin and it was messed up. So I had to add 1/4 cup flour. They were delicious tho! It tasted like I was using strawberry syrup on them! I couldn't single out the flavour of the vanilla so I definitely don't think 2 tablespoons was too much.

These pancakes were yummy however there are a few minor changes I made and I'm glad I did. First the batter was VERY thin. I added 1/4 to 1/3 of a cup more flour. I also thought they were quite salty, next time I will decrease the salt. I also added some pink food coloring, and I finished the pancakes with freshly whipped cream, powdered sugar and pink sprinkles... fun and girly, perfect for a girls princess sleepover breakfast!!!

These pancakes exceeded my expectations.They were not at all thin and definitely rich with strawberries.  I really liked them and they made my kitchen smell amazing.  I changed a few things though. I used half the vanilla, after reading some other reviews, and I used half the veggie oil. I am not a big fan of oil. Overall though, these were great. ill be making them again.

these were great, but like most people, i altered the recipe:  i lessened the milk to 3/4 cup and then added 1/4 cup of ricotta cheese. i omitted the oil.   sooooooo good!  i find that if you let the batter sit for a few minutes before you make the pancakes, the batter will fluff up a bit.  i will definitely make these again.

These were ok but not a favorite.  Batter is very thin but if it sits a little it gets a little thicker.  They are fairly sweet.

The way the recipe is written was not  good for me. But I did make something real  yummy out of it, with a little changes.   I made the recipe the way it is written, minus the strawberries. I could tell the consistency was not what I like. So I added another 1/4 cup of flour and 1 tbsp of brown sugar. It was perfect after that. I made a few pancakes with out the strawberries and they turned out fabulous. I then added the strawberries, and I just did not like the look, feel or taste of the pancake with the strawberries inside. It may have been b/c I used frozen strawberries. I may try again with fresh. But the pancakes minus the strawberries were great and I will make them again.

These were pretty good! I was about to give it a lower rating as my pancakes had a bit of a salty aftertaste, but then realized my daughter told me to put in 2 tsp. of salt! And I wondered why there was so much salt...lol. I will make again, with me double checking the quantities. :0)  Thanks!

It thought that it was OK.  I personally like light and fluffy pancakes.  These were a bit thin and it didn't have the right texture...

I followed the amount of ingredients exactly and the directions. The pancakes were so incredibly thin that every time I tried to flip them they would fall apart. If I did a thicker pancake, it crumbled into mush. I used 3 different pans, different temperature, different sized pancakes, etc. I have made pancakes plenty of times so I know how to make them, I was just trying out something new. The one tiny pancake I got out of it, tasted a little salty and kind of plain. No offense, but I expected it to be much better. It did make the house smell really good...

AMAZING!! Everyone loved them, kids and all!!  I did skip the brown sugar because I felt it wasn't needed & i just try to use less sugar for my kids.  It was delicous & have made them every weekend for the past 3 weeks!

These were okay. I used half whole wheat flour and added a bit of mashed banana that I had left over from making my daughter's baby food.

Like other reviewers, I found the strawberries were sour although when eaten on its own, they are quite sweet. The pancakes are edible just not to our liking.

First of all, I have to admit that I did make an addition to the recipe. I added 1/4 c. white chocolate chips for a little fun. I did not love these pancakes. Mine came out very salty and thin. I did however eat two. ;) But my 18 mth. daughter did not like them at all, and my hubby was not home to try them. Hmmm. . .  they sounded sooo good.
