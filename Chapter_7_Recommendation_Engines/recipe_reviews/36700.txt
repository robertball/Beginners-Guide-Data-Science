This was a wonderful tomatoe soup recipe. I did'nt blend the second batch to have some "chunky" pieces in the soup.I also added 1/2 cup sherry to replace the 1/2 cup water in the amounts of water asked for.

Wonderful fresh taste, very flexible recipe.  I used vegetable broth instead of water to add a bit more richness.  Great for add-ins: garbanzo beans, cooked rice, cooked pasta, thinly sliced quartered zucchini or yellow squash.  I use an immersion blender to puree and then strain it to remove the seeds.  When tomatoes are plentiful in the garden, I make up huge batches and freeze in dinner-sized containers, for quick and versatile meals.  Mmmmmmmmm....

Nice and easy - some wine or veggie stock would make a nice substitute for the water.  I might puree half, just because the texture is nice.  If you are feeling the lack of sugar, just be aware that tomatoes differ in acidity and canned tomatoes often have things in to try to keep the 'brightness' of the tomatoes over time.  Taste the soup early so you can adjust the sugar.  Broth or wine will help this a lot (wine is acidic too, but it chemically interacts with tomatoes to release a whole set of flavours that just sit there and do nothing.  Another trick with this - and all tomato sauces is to add the paste in at the beginnign and let it do the Maillard thing..essentially caramelizing a bit, just let it darken. then the tomatoes for a minute (stir, the paste and garlic would burn otherwise) and then the water and such.  You probably won't need any sugar.

This was very simple and easy to make ... a great use of end of summer's garden fresh tomatoes and herbs!  I thought the soup needed a bit more sugar than the recipe called for but it was still very good.

Pretty good, I agree that it needed more sugar.  Came out like a generic spaghetti sauce.  Easy if you're craving tomato soup.  Thanks CLM.

LOVE this soup!  Quick and easy, really fresh taste.  I give out very few 5 star ratings, and this one deserves every star.  When my garden yields more fruit than I know what to do with, I plan to make a huge batch of this soup and can it for summer fresh taste in the middle of winter!

This just wasn't very good to us and we love tomato soup.  We ended up trying to cream it up with some cream, then it was so strong on the tomato bite that we had to sugar it up to 4 1/2 tsp and more salt.  We just didn't find it very satisfying at all.

Really good and simple. My child was sick and wanted tomato soup and I was out. I also did not have any tomatoes so this is what I did. I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes with oregano, garlic and basil. I did not have a tomatoe paste so I boiled my beef bouillon cube in the water and add 2 tbsp of flour after the bouillon water was cooled.  I also added more sugar than what was called for. It smelled great and tasted great. My children loved it!
