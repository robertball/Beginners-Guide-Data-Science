Despite his skepticism while these were cooking, my husband loved these.  I thought they could use a bit more spicing up.  The recipe doesn't indicate to cover the lentils while they cook, but mine dried out while still crunchy, so I had to add water.  Next time I'll cover.

This recipe was very good. I was a little skeptical at first, not being too familiar with lentils and all. I did have to use about 2  cans of chicken broth for the lentils to get somewhat soft. I added a dollop of sour cream, half of a cut up avocado, and salsa to top it off. My husband, who is a die hard meat lover,  even liked the nachos. Won't make it often, but every once in a while these will come as a nice change of pace.

This was OKAY... Definitely not spicy in any capacity, EVOO works fine in place of coconut oil if you're not looking to spend the extra money. I recommend adding a can of diced chilies if you want some warmth to the dish, you absolutely need to double the liquid to soften the lentils, I just eye balled it after my broth was absorbed 15 minutes into the simmer. I also recommend topping with a little dollop of sour cream.

Delicious!  I only threw the lentil mixture and cheese on the chips and it was really good.  Husband loved them and has already asked for them again.  I'm sure the rest of the ingredients make them even better, but not even necessary!

This is such a great cheap and easy meal.  The lentils and black beans add great protein and vitamins with a much lower fat content than ground beef.  We like these nachos with sour cream, salsa and guacamole.

This was really good!
We had used a bunch of chicken broth in other recipes this past week, so I was getting sick of it and used water instead.  Just make sure you add quite a bit of salt and pepper to taste or it will be bland.
Instead of black beans I used a can of tri-bean blend that had black, kidney and pinto beans.
We didn't add the salsa and cheese this time but I'm sure it would have been delicious!
I added frozen corn and the bean blend to the pot with lentils and cooked an additional 10 minutes.  We dipped corn tortilla chips into it and everyone gave it great reviews!

Pretty tasty recipe. I didn't have coconut oil (kinda expensive) so I used a little veggie oil instead. I also used two cans of vegetable broth, as that's what was already in my cupboard. I covered it for 20 min. and then took the lid off the last 10 minutes. The lentils were nice and soft and had just the perfect amount of slight liquid. I added a can of diced chiles to the beans and corn. I think next time I'll definitely throw a little avocado on top. This was a really great meat alternative meal.

Made this recipe several times. Perfect for football games with friends. The crowd LOVES the 'healthier', meatless option. Most times I make just one pan of nachos, then all the remaining goodies become a "Spicy Lentil Nacho" soup later in the week . . . begin with onions, carrots, and celery which have been sweated, add chicken stock, and whatever kinds of veggies you like (or have in the fridge). No need for a starch . . . crumple leftover tortilla chips on top. YUM!

I made this tonight. Very good. I did make a couple of additions. I pressure cooked the onions and lentils with spices (including a packet of sazon) in chicken broth for about 20 minutes. I spread this onto tortilla chips on 2 cookie sheets and sprinkled with a can of southwest bean salad and canned diced green chilies., topped with cheese. Baked in oven at 350Â° for about 6 minutes. Flavors were very good. Will make again for sure.

I have made these several times and pretty much followed the recipe. I do use veg broth to keep it veg-friendly and add chopped serrano with the onion for heat. I always double the seasoning...yummy.. I do add additional broth but I also simmer over an hour with the lid on, then remove the lid to let thicken. We like to top tacos/nachos with cheese, guac, mango, cilantro, cream, white onion, tomato, peppers...anything that sounds good! ..refried beans and rice (sometimes) on the side. Thank you for Taco Tuesday...I did make a ground beef version for the men!

When I saw this recipe in my email it was titled 'Spicy Meatless Nachos'. I guess meatless is not vegetarian. The chicken broth makes this no-so-much-meatless. Yes I can sub veg broth I just get tired of being led into recipes that start out as meatless and end up with 'meat broth'. Can you please do a little better of a job, All Recipes, of NOT doing a bait and switch? Don't want to rant - just asking you to advise your writers that "meatless" recipes should contain no meat OR meat byproducts. Thank you, in advance, for being understanding.

Yum! I followed the directions as written (except I covered the lentils while cooking) and it came out so well. Even my meat loving teen liked the veggie version. It didn't turn out spicy at all - but it is still tasty. The spice-loving folks at the table added sriracha. I have made this a few times now, and if I have the ingredients, I add a layer of guacamole and sprinkle chopped green onion on top. Even better!
