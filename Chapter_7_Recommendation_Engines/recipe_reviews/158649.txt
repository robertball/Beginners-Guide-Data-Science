This was an easy recipe.  Light and delicious.  I didn't add the chile (kids don't like it).  Would make this again and again.

Quite good! Tastes like something you would get at a nice Italian restaurant.

I was a little concerned that it might become too bitter (had this problem before with cherry tomatoes) so I added a bit of salt and sugar while cooking them. May not have been necessary, but it came out nice anyway.

Also added a little more garlic and red chili pepper for my taste.
The olives add a nice touch, thanks for this one.

This recipe made a really nice sauce. The olives were a nice touch so be sure to use them.  I sprinkled in some sugar as well and also added a tablespoon of balsamic vinegar.  The crushed tomatoes I used were fire roasted and I found that added something special to the sauce as well. I upped the garlic to three cloves.  It's four stars because I thought the sauce was a bit too chunky and needed more liquid.

I omitted the crushed tomatoes and it was still tasty.  Thanks for sharing!

This was ok, I would maybe add a little canned tomato sauce or something to make more of a sauce. Also the cherry tomato skins were a bit too tough, I think I would use skinned tomatoes for this since the crushed tomatoes have skins too.

I made this for a class project and it turned out wonderful. One ingredient that isnt really needed, I noticed, is the red onion. We forgot to put that in and it still turned out wonderful. Amazing! ( :

What a great way to use all those cherry tomatoes from the garden. Different than our usual tomato sauce and really tasty.

This was very tasty! To make it even better though I recommend adding some red wine. I also threw in some marinated artichoke hearts.

not too bad - easy and tasty. I used yellow grape tomatoes (which were super sweet). I agree with Michelle - the olives really make it.

This recipe gets 6 stars from me! I am a lazy cook so I added water with the crushed tomatoes and cooked the gnocchi right in the sauce. I had roma tomatoes, so I chopped those-- 4 tomatoes was 2 cups, exactly. I am glad I bought kalamata olives and didn't use plain old black olives. The flavor was fantastic as written. Can't wait to make this again!

My daughter loves gnocchi, and I was looking for a new sauce to make for it. This was really good. I had a jar of olive tapenade (from Trader Joe's) open, so I used some of that in place of sliced olives. Everyone liked it! Thanks!

I used Spanish olives instead of Kalamata and I used tomato puree, delicious and plentiful here in Spain instead of the tomatoes in the recipe but it was delicious and yes it is a permanent in my recipes saved

I had an overabundance of cherry tomatoes and this seemed like a great way to use them.  We found this very enjoyable, but not special enough to make again.

Awesome recipe!  I only added mushrooms and artichoke hearts and a pinch of sugar.
