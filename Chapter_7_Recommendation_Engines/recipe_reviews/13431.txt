This was an excellent base recipe.  I added a couple dashes of worcestershire sauce and habanero sauce to spice it up a bit.  I will definately be using this recipe again.

It was terrible. Bland didn't really have any taste to it. Not really anything to make it special. blah. I waisted my time and money on this one.

We loved this.  Sorry to say, I did make some changes.  Grilled the pumpkin, 1 chopped onion and 3 carrots in the oven with olive oil, pepper and seasoning salt.  Blended it up with the chicken stock and added probably double the curry powder.  Everything else the same.  Put the shrimp in the bowl and poured the hot soup on top - yum!

Had this type of soup in Puerto Vallarta, MX & it was excellent.  I am going to try to make it with less milk & usecanned pumpkin.  I will simmer the pumpkin 15 minutes with seasoning & liquid.  Will cross my fingers that it works.

This turned out okay, but needed more flavor, and we thought it was too thin. I think the milk and broth could both be cut in half next time. I added some carrot puree I had on hand to try and thicken it a bit. I saut√©ed some green onions in olive oil, doubled the curry, and added black pepper, seasoning salt, cayenne and habanero hot sauce. I would like to try this again; it has potential. As written, it was a little bland and thin for our tastes.
