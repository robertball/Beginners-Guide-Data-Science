I can't imagine that anyone would add dried onion flakes to a salad like this without hydrating the onions first.  Seems like a lot of people did though.  I boiled 8 large eggs, grated 1/4 of a med onion, (because I do like the flavor of onion), added 1/4 teas. onion salt instead of salt, added 1 teas. lemon juice and cut the mayo to 1/2 cup.  Outstanding egg salad.  I hardly ever made egg salad but will make it more often now.  Can't wait to share this with friends.

Egg salad is one of those things that's pretty hard to mess up.  Eggs, mayo, mustard, dill relish, salt and pepper - right?  But when this gem of a recipe landed on my RSS feed, I just *knew* I had to try it.  I now  have a new favorite way to make egg salad sandwiches.  The mustard powder gives it that mustardy flavor without the extra vinegar that's present in prepared mustard.  And the dill weed!  Oh my - THAT is what sets this whole recipe apart.  With a more intense dill flavor than regular dill relish, it perfectly compliments the eggs and mayo.  And, since we love onions, I finely chopped about 2 Tblsp. of fresh onion into my salad instead of the plain onion flakes (which can sometimes be more pungent than the "real" thing).  Try this recipe - you won't be disappointed!  Thanks, Sara!

Someone said there was something missing and I agree.  The missing ingredient is paprika.  Can't make egg salad without it.  Other than that, good recipe.

Good, but I made some changes based on the other reviews.  Cut the mayo to 3/4 cup at least, used 2 tsp prepared mustard, and fresh onion chopped fine. Because it made so much, I took the leftover added it along with 2 tsp of pickle relish to 2 leftover baked potatoes that I chopped up.  Made great potato salad!

This was a very good egg salad. I used minced onions instead of the dried onion flakes & I served it on a honey wheat bread w/ leaf lettuce & a slice of havarti cheese. Yumm!

Very good. 4.5 stars. I omitted the dill and used chopped onion instead of flakes. This hit the spot for comfort food. Thank you.

Egg salad is one of those recipes that make it tough for the submitter of the recipe because seasonings are not generally a "one size fits all."   It's too bad recipes can't read, "season with salt, pepper, mustard powder, etc." TO TASTE.  I did just that, but couldn't bring myself to use the dried onion flakes, so I subbed onion powder instead.  Mustard powder is something I use in my egg salad routinely, but dill and garlic powder is not.  I really enjoyed the addition of both, along with chopped green onion and the "gotta have it" chopped celery!  Good recipe - just add your seasonings and mayo to your liking!

Pros: Heavy flavors (if you like that); very easy; wide range of spices that can work well together; all dried ingredients you likely already have so no-brainer on the shopping list. Cons: Calls for too much of almost everything. Suggestions: Start with half the recommended amounts and add to taste from there. Use a quarter (just to try it) or omit ingredients you know for sure you don't like.

I thought this was delightful. As written, it has a little too much dill for my (and my family's) taste - so I did 1/2 tsp. Also used very finely chopped onions (2 Tbsp) instead of dried. The original recipe has too much mayo, so I did about 3/4 C. and then also added in 2 more eggs. Also added in 1 stalk very finely chopped celery. If you let this sit in the fridge for a few hours or overnight it is WONDERFUL. (add paprika too!) I love this on a piece of toasted bread, openfaced.

2nd best egg salad sandwhich EVER! I(2nd to only my dads which I just like because he made it) I followed other reviews as I added 2T real onions a little less on all the spices than whats called out, 1/2 cup mayo. I suggest you start with 1/2 cup and add as needed, no way to fix too much mayo. I highly suggest adding one stalk of celery. It really was the cherry on top. Will make again.

This was really good.  I only made a couple changes.  I used fresh green onions instead of flakes.  I also added smoked paprika.  I admit that I did not have time to refrigerate it overnite, but it was still delish!

Personally, I prefer using a REAL onion.  I also like a little crunch in mine so I used some celery that's been cut up.

I was looking for something more creamy and comforting than the traditional vinegary egg salad with sweet pickle relish.  My husband's favorite way to eat this is on toasted sesame seed buns or bagels, with crisp bacon and thin slices of tomato for breakfast. It's my favorite comfort food.  Once, I didn't have the dill weed, but used dried basil instead. I think you could use any fragrant tender herb here or use chopped chives or scallions instead of some of the dried onion.

Love this creamy recipe, especially the dill.  Used real onions instead of dry.  Recommend letting it sit for several hours for everything to blend together.

This egg salad is a decent base, but as written it wasn't quite to my liking.  I scaled the recipe for one serving, but kept the proportions right for the ingredients, and all I could taste was mayo and dill. I noted a lot of other reviewers cut the mayo, but I am not a fan of dry sandwich fillings.  There was too much mayo even for me! Couldn't taste any of the other seasoning or ingredients, and I even added a diced rib of celery.  If it weren't for the nice crunch, I wouldn't have even known it was in there.  There was more mayo and dill than egg, so you could hardly say it was egg salad!  I think in the future I'll use half the amount of mayo called for (you can always add more if needed, after all), and half the amount of dill, add in an equal amount of paprika as dill (1/8 tsp each for a 2-egg batch), and add the celery again.

Maybe I messed it up (cuz I'm pretty new to this whole cooking thing) and added too much mayo, but it wasn't "eggy" enough, and the dry onion flakes were crunchy, but not in a satisfying way like fresh onions might be. I rate it 3/5 because it's possible that I did something wrong (I know... WHO messes up egg salad???), so maybe it was me!

Good receipe! I did change a few things...I didn't have any onion flakes so just used onion powder instead. Used the pampered chef dill mix, and used a combination of sour cream, cream cheese & mayo to equal the total amount of mayo called for.Definately needed some salt & pepper also. Really good, thank you Sara.

This recipe is delicious! I did make quite a few changes. To start I used fat free Kraft mayo. I didn't have mustard seed but I did have horseradish mustard and used about two tbs of that. A dash of dill, dash of garlic powder, pepper and a dash of cayanne pepper. I didn't have paprika. It came out so good. The best part is that it tastes so good without the guilt of the real mayo.

Yummy! I used a quarter diced onion instead of onion powder. Next time I would use just a bit less powdered mustard.

I was looking for a recipe with dill in it, because I like that tartness dill gives to egg salad, like the kind my mom used to make.  This was better than mom's, even my first time around making this salad.  I will cut down on the onion flakes next time.  I did use 3/4 Miracle Whip and 1/4 Mayo since I prefer a sweeter egg salad.  All in all, this was good and it was better than 4 stars but not quite 5, according to my tastes.  I will make this again and again.

I didn't have onion flakes on hand so I substituted onion powder.  The dill gives it that something extra.  Very tasty and I will be making this on a regular basis.  Thanks Sara!

Great recipe!  Only minor changes I made were to use 1/4 teaspoon of onion powder in place of the 1/4 C of onion flakes (fresh onion makes me burp up onion fumes for a week). Also, since I had no dill weed I used a teaspoon of 'Lemon Dilly' dip mix.  Also, I like to add diced celery for a nice crunch, purely my own personal preference though.  I would not reccomend exchanging mustard powder for prepared mustard, i used to do this and they really are NOTHING alike in flavor.  Invest in mustard powder- it's fabulous stuff.  This was definitely full flavored and I'll definitely make it again.

I also made this for a meeting for my partner on tuesday and it was great the Combination of flavors was Awesome.I did change this some what by using 3 tsp of onion powder instead of regular onions(the powder is not as strong as reg onions) The dill was great it had people asking what was the great flavor in the background of the salad of course I said that it was a secert. This recipe will make a lot more sandwiches than it says.

Everyone Raves over this recipe! The onion flakes give it a very different flavor over raw onions. I like it b/c it is mostly pantry items.

I think I would like it better by adding paprika and not using salt. It was still good... just seemed a little too much salt for my taste buds!

The only change I made: I used minced green onions because I could not find onion "flakes." Is dried minced onion what is meant? Clarify, please.  
Otherwise, my main complaint is that, with the exception of the pepper and mustard, amounts given for seasonings are heavy-handed for my taste. 
The first thing I noticed was saltiness. Now, my salt shaker and I are fast friends, so when I say something's a little on the salty side, it's a considerable problem. Half the amount should do it. Fortunately, it's not inedible once it's spread on bread, but the saltiness is still very noticeable. 
Second, the garlic powder leaves an unpleasantly heavy aftertaste. Again, I like garlic, but somehow a pronounced garlic aftertaste from an egg salad seems a little strange. You will need breath mints. 
Third, the dill is overpowering at the amount listed. I like to taste the eggs in egg salad.
In the end, all I ended up tasting was salt, dill and garlic, pretty much in that order. The eggs seemed to be nothing more than a vehicle, which I find a shame. The delicate taste of egg just couldn't survive the onslaught of seasonings.  
Perhaps the original amounts would work better with fresh garlic and dill. With dried, they're just too much. I would cut each in half, at least. 
I will most likely make this again, because I think it has great potential. But I will not use the original seasoning amounts unless I am able to use fresh ingredients, and I will cut the salt back in any case.

I made it as written. It was way too salty. Also felt it had too much mayo. I'm giving it 4 stars because if the ingredient amounts are altered to taste it is awesome. I cut the salt, dill and mayo in half, used fresh finely chopped onion instead of the flakes, and sprinkled in some paprika. It's now awesome :)

I make this quite often for my husband but I don't add the dill weed or the onion flakes.  The first time I made it with those ingredients he did not like it.  Once I cut those 2 items out he said it was much better.  He is SO not a picky eater but he liked these so much better without those items.

great twist on a basic!   I used 1/2 cup mayo, and probably 1/4 dijon, 1/4 cup regular mustard since I didn't have dried mustard.  Love the garlic powder!  I added probably a 1/2 tsp of paprika and a little cayenne since I love it.  I only used 1/4 of salt, and it was too salty, so I added another egg.  Perfect

I followed the advice of many to reduce the mayo to 1/4 cup.   I also added 1/2 teaspoon of paprika and instead of the dill weed I added 2 chopped dill pickle spears and one chopped celery stick.  It was awesome.  My sandwich consisted of toasted bread, lettuce tomato and the egg salad.

This is absolutely delightful!  Granddaughters love it; as a matter of fact, I make it when I'm ready to assemble potato salad and add this egg salad to the dry ingredients of the potato salad.  My granddaughter loves it, she calls it Grandma Susie's egg salad potato salad.  Smile.

Not a bad recipe, but needs some tweaking. Here's the modifications I usually make: I always reduce (or leave out) the 1/4 cup of dried onion flakes to kill the overwhelming onion taste and I add about 1 teaspoon of Mrs. Dash and 1 teaspoon of Morton's Nature Seasoning. Sometimes I add about 1/2 teaspoon of lemon pepper too. Sometimes I substitute Miracle Whip for mayo for a little sweeter taste. Instead of dill weed, I use about 2 teaspoons of dill relish (or sometimes 1 teaspoon dill relish and 1 teaspoon sweet relish for a sweeter version). I leave out the salt and use garlic salt instead of garlic powder, and I always serve this on homemade or store-bought sandwich crescents.

I had used this recipe some time back and LOVED it but forgot to save it.  Recently was asked to make egg salad for a friend (which gives me the excuse to make a big batch - as I'm the only one in the house who LOVES egg salad lol), so I had to go searching for this recipe again and realized not only did I not save it before I also didn't rate it!  This recipe produces a lovely, light and fluffy, and very flavorful sandwich spread.  I grew up with egg salad that had chopped onion and pickle in it and find this recipe to be superior to that for my taste.  No excess watering down from pickle juice, just a subtle hint of onion, and the big fresh boost of flavor from the dill weed... perfection!  Definitely saved the recipe this time; will use again and again!

This was too oniony and too salty for my taste.  The next time I'll tweak it by using HALF of the dried onion and no salt. ----------------------------------------- I tried this again today with a few changes, which made this salad MUCH better.  First off...I substituted regular onion for the dried stuff.  I used half of the mayo called for so the salad held together without dripping all over the place.  I also omitted the salt.  These little changes made such a big difference...it was wonderful.

I found the review saying there was too much mayo after the fact. I'm glad I had an extra egg to add to it, it could have used even more egg for the amount of mayo. I cut back on the dill, thought it would overpower it and I'm glad I did. Also the 1/4 cup onion would have been way to much. I only used a couple Tabs fresh diced onion. When cooking I always remember what my mother would say "You can always add more, but you can't take it out". (Miss her lots)

This was really good. I didn't see the part about letting the onion flakes sit in hot water for awhile if you are going to eat it right away so my egg salad was a little crunchy. I'll remember that next time. I might put a little less salt next time but otherwise it was perfect

i am not a huge egg salad girl, but with 2 dozen easter eggs left, i was searching for a recipe to try. i ran out of minced onion and ended up only using about 1 tsp. i think it def needed more, but i think the 1/4 cup would be way overboard. maybe 1 heaping tablespoon?  i liked the amount of dill in it and did not think it was too much. with that said, my dill was old in the cupboard and i am sure not as pungent as newer spices. i love to add salt to foods and tend to use alot of salt, but i agree with other reviewers, this recipe is VERY salty tasting. cut it to 1/4 tsp instead. i also cut the mayo to 1/2 a cup. i cut my eggs with an egg slicer, cutting them once the long way, then turning them the opposite way and cutting them again. i like it a bit more chunky than smooth, personal preference. with all that said, i would give it 4 stars. the onion thing that everyone speaks of is personal preference again. if you are not a huge fan, cut it in half, as you can always add it in again when your done...

First, I'd like to note that I changed the recipe a bit (maybe more than a bit). It wasn't too salty, but there was two much mayo. People in my house don't like mayo too much, so I ended up added more spices (cayenne pepper, curry powder, and Johnny's seasoning). I also used regular mustard and chopped up onions. If I had done the recipe exactly as it says, I would have ended up with a dish no one would have eaten. Needless to say, my mom and little brother liked it, hence the three stars. I will, however, be going back to my more traditional recipe for egg salad sandwiches, because this recipe just didn't work for me.

Used the leftover Easter eggs to make this. The dill gave this salad a truly unique taste that I've never experienced with egg salad before. I thought the proportions were right on. Will definitely make this again.

A pretty classic recipe that was delicious with mini rye cocktail bread. A tip to make it SUPER quick and easy: use a cookie scoop to portion onto the slices of bread, then simply top with another slice of bread. I used freshly minced onion in place of the onion flakes.

I gave this 5 stars because honestly it's super easy & yummy. At one time I didn't have the onion flakes, mustard powder, dill weed! And I just didn't add those and added a little bit of curry powder I had and a little more black pepper and amazing! Egg salad is all about what seasonings you'd enjoy rather than the actual recipe.

This was a great and easy recipe for egg salad! Its fairly bland, which was good for my kid. The only spice she didn't love was the dill weed, but I think it added good flavor!

The egg salad is delicious!  I also used chopped fresh onion instead of flakes and reduced the mayo to 2/3 cup.  I still feel this was a bit much and will likely reduce it further next time.  I would definitely recommend this with less mayo as it is a quick, easy and yummy dish.

Oh...I'm so sad to give my first bad review on anything. I followed the recipe exactly with a few reviewers' suggestions (including less mayo) and it was SO salty. I absolutely love all of the components of this dish - especially dill - but I thought it had WAY too much of it. I may try it again, but maybe with half the amount of dill.

Good, but not great.  I like dill flavor, but I thought this recipe called for a bit too much.  
Very flavorful, but at the same time all the spices overpowered the egg taste.  I wanted to taste more egg.

It was very good!  Definitely best eaten when chilled. I didn't have onion flakes so I added chopped fresh onions about 2 TBS.  Instead of 1 cup Mayonnaise I used 1/2 C mayonnaise & 1/2 C Miracle Whip, and a dash or 2 of curry powder.  Since my family is in love with bacon I sprinkled some of that on top.  I also toasted my bread & it was YUM!  One of my kids didn't like the flavor of dill ( I think he's nuts!) so next time I make this, I'll have to take his portion out before adding the dill & sprinkle a little bit of dill on top of his so I can control the amount of dill flavor for him..after all, kids need to be shown the food like 10 times in order for them to try something new :) My next move is to add smoked salmon & avocados, can't wait!

I took this to work for a "mini-food" day and it was a huge hit.  I suggest using biscuits instead of bread (I rolled out a can of the Grands biscuits and cut out mini-rounds).  The guys loved it and the ladies all asked for the recipe.  Don't be afraid of the onion flakes.  They make all the difference.  If anything, reduce the amount and add to taste.

If you like your dill weed egg-textured, then this is the recipe for you!  I like dill, but thought it was overpowering in this dish. I guess it's just a matter of personal preference, but I like a tangier, crunchier egg salad than the one this recipe produces. After tasting the salad as prepared almost per the recipe (used fresh onion instead of the flakes and half the mayo- which was PLENTY), I added some vinegar and later some lemon juice. That helped a little, but nothing could really "fix" the dill weed overload. My husband didn't really care for it either. We ate it, but I won't be making it again.

I begin this review by saying that I love onion, dill and garlic.  I also must note that I followed this recipe exactly as written and was excited to try it as all of the ingredients are among my favorites.  I should have known better than to take something to a gathering before trying it myself beforehand...  I usually make my egg salad by putting in my ingredients and adjusting as needed to taste.  Because I was going to take this to a get-together, I thought I would follow a recipe that had gotten plenty of good reviews.  The result was not so good...none of my girlfriends cared for this and all agreed that there was way too much onion.   The garlic just didn't work either.  We all agreed that the dill may have been ok if the other flavors weren't so overpowering.  Sorry, but I think I will go back to my traditional egg salad.  Wouldn't recommend this recipe.

Something was strange about this recipe.  Either too much dried onion or too much dill seasoning. Maybe my dill was too strong, it was a new bottle from Trader Joe's.  It was edible but a strange taste for sure.  Will try other recipes next time.

I prepared and ate this recipe right away instead of letting it refrigerate for 8 hours. I had some green onions on hand so I used those instead of the flakes. And I probably used about half of the mayo which was enough for me. Even though I was full I still wanted more after I inhaled my sandwich, so I kept eating the salad by scooping it up with some crackers. Luckily there's a little left for tomorrow.

This recipe is fabulous! I had 9 eggs already cooked when I came across this recipe. I was surprised at the amount of mayo though! So I made half a recipe of the dressing. It was just enough to make a thick but creamy salad for my sandwiches.

This was absolutely great!!  I don't know how people can say it's too salty.  I used sea salt which is less refined so maybe that cut down on the saltiness.  I also used White Ground Pepper instead of black pepper and it gave it a nice subtle taste without being too peppery.  Will use over and over!!!

Just made this.I did not care for this recipe.  WAY TOO MUCH SALT!!! Beware. I would start with an 1/8 tsp and go from there. (and I only used 1/4 tsp myself down from the 1/2 tsp the recipie calls for). I also added pickles cause I prefer my egg salad with them. I think I will stick to my nromal recipie from now on.

These sandwiches are fantastic.

I've got few complaints of the recipe, but would still say that it's delicious.

Next time that I make this recipe, I will omit the onion flakes, and use pickles instead of dill weed. I'm used to a chunkier egg salad sandwich, and when using dill weed instead of pickles, it omits the "chunk" that I like. 

The onion flakes seemed to add a pungent taste to the sandwich. I didn't use the entire amount of onion flakes as called for in the original recipe, and I still felt that it was too much.

All over all, the recipe was great. I will undoubtedly use it again, with minor modifications.

Nice blending of flavors. I used ground onion just because my kids don't like tasting the onion flakes. Everything else I did the same. This is great with spinach leaves and avocado and tomato slices.

Non-Salt Lovers BEWARE!!!!  I scaled this down to four servings and followed the recipe exactly.  Recipe called for 1/4 tsp. of salt.  I HALFED that and it was still way too salty!!!  I couldn't eat it!  If I ever try this recipe again, it will be without the salt!

This was my first go with egg salad.  I could tell that after I followed the recipe it was going to be too creamy for my taste as well.  I just added about 6 more eggs and it fixed my issue!  Very good!  I went a little easy on the salt and dill.

I wish I could give this more stars than 5. I'm not an egg salad fan at all, but I'm pregnant and was having a craving for it. I tried this recipe and I am now an egg salad lover for life! The dill and onion really make this flavorful. It's certainly not bland like most egg salads. It would be REALLY good with a couple of pimento stuffed olives chopped up in it. Yum! I will never search for another egg salad recipe.

Too salty, and way too much for only four sandwiches.  Can easily make twice as many.

If you're stuck with leftovers, you can boil some potatoes, mash them, and then make a nice potato salad with it.

Loved the dill in this salad Sara, not to mention the mustard. I used fresh onion and a bit of celery. I prefer my egg salad warm, so I served it to myself immediately. YUMMO and thanks!

If this was the egg salad you "grew up on" it would be great.  It's a little TOO much different from the one I'm used to.  Too much dill.

I have made this twice, now.  The first time, I followed the recipe to the letter.The garlic and dill was too much, and I didn't think it melded with the other flavors very well.  The second time, I omitted the garlic and dill, and added a half-cup of sweet pickle relish.  That's all it took to make it a perfect recipe.

Pretty good recipe, next time I'll try it with fresh dill.  Way too much mayo in my opinion.  I only used 3/4 cup and still felt like it was a little too much.

Add some paprika and two cans of de-boned sardines and you've got an amazing creation. (You can also add a can of drained sweet corn to top this off)

Very good, especially the next day. I omitted the mustard powder since I didn't have any on hand and increased the pepper. I also mixed garlic paste with my mayo before folding into the eggs, but I'm a garlic fiend. I like this on toasted multigrain bread with a side of chips for a quick lunch or snack.

Dill weed in egg salad LOVE IT! I didn't have mustard powder so used a little yellow mustard. Will try as written. Used red onion instead of dried onion. Served on a bed of greens. I was not even a fan of egg salad TILL NOW! thanks for sharing.

I was careful about adding the mayonnaise because of earlier reviews, but ended up adding more later.  I think it might have been because I used duck eggs and they are bigger.  Very good recipe.  Thanks.

I agree with what many people said, this had WAY too much mayonnaise!  Other than that, it was an absolutely DELICIOUS dish! Simple and tasty! I'll just cut the mayo way down next time.

I wanted a more "elegant" egg salad, so I customized as follows:   I used 16 eggs (double servings), using 1 cup Miracle Whip and 1 cup Greek caviar spread. Finely diced garlic and onions (no flakes). And lots of dill.   When assembling the sandwich, I added thinly sliced tomato (marinated in olive oil, well-aged balsamic vinegar, tons of black pepper, and a healthy dollop of wasabi) on top.   My boyfriend loved the combination of flavors, and I will definitely make it again.

This recipe used as is produced a very runny concoction which oozed out of the sandwiches. Use about half the amount of mayo so it doesn't all squeeze out of bread and onto the floor.

I thought this tasted very strange...... almost an undertone of sweetness!! I have had much better egg salad, I ate it but would never make again.

I love egg salad.  I love dill weed and thought I would love this recipe, but it had a strange spicey taste (maybe the mustard), and I missed the vinegar I usually get from relish and prepared mustard.  My husband and four year old didn't like it either.

Flavorful and simple to make. This recipe is great tool for teaching kids how to cook, esp. younger children if the eggs are already hardboiled.

The entire family liked this except Kaylee. That's okay though. She doesn't like anything.  Next time I may reduce the dill.

This is a great, straightforward egg salad recipe.  I found them to be way too "dilly" for my taste, so I think next time I will cut the amount of dill in half.  I also added celery because I love a little crunch.  Yum!

I loved it. Didn't have Onion Flakes though, so I used 1/2 tsp Onion Powder instead. Other than that, left the Recipe as is, didn't need any Changes in my Opinion.  Was enough for many, many Sandwiches.

Ugh!  Onion flavor was way too overpowering!  I should have reduced the dried onion flakes considerably or just left them out all together.  This recipe may have been good without the onions, but I'm rating it based on the ingredients listed.  Onion lovers may think this is the best egg salad ever, but the overwhelming flavor just took too much away from the rest of the ingredients for me.

Not my favorite egg salad recipe - and I typcially love egg salad.   I made the recipe exactly as posted, except I reduced the mayo to approx. 1/2 cup + 2 T. based on previous reviews (you can always add more if needed, but can never take it out once made). I did not care for the dill or the garlic, as they overpowered every other flavor.  And I am a dill lover, so I was very disappointed that I did not like the dill. I will try this again, omitting the dill, adding some sweet pickle relish, using either freshly minced onion or Onion Salt instead of Onion Powder, and probably omitting the garlic.

The first time I made this (a week or two ago) I followed the recipe exactly...5 STARS!  I made it again tonight using fresh onion and adding a little bacon and it was once again delish.  I've read several reviews that people have added sweet relish, so I'll have to try that next.

This was delicious!!  I unfortunately didn't have any dill on hand so I had to leave that out but it was still so so yummy.  Also, I didn't have the onion flakes so I substituted a half tsp of onion powder and used onion salt for the salt.  I always measure the amounts of spices because I don't have the natural ability to just guess, and this recipe's measurements led to a fantastic egg salad.

I simply can not imagine putting that much onion in it! I want egg salad not onion salad. I didn't measure anything that I changed but I put roughly a Tablespoon of onion in it (admittedly could have been a little more than that). I used less dry mustard as well but didn't cut it down by all that much. I didn't have dill so I couldn't use that.. I think that would really make this recipe though (perhaps cut back the amount a little but it's hard for me to say since I didn't have any).  Also, I didn't have quite enough mayo so here's an interesting twist.. I added Rach dressing to it.. probably 1/4 cup or a little less. I also added bacon bits.

I halved this recipe and didn't use the dried onion.  It was pretty good except the dill was a little overpowering.  Next time I will use less dill.  Other then that, I didn't mind it.

It seemed ridiculous to use a recipe for egg salad, but I was curious to see what it would be like. It was great! A real cut above the regular. Like other, I cut the mayo to 1/2 cup, used finely diced fresh onion rather than flakes and added a dash of paprika. Excellent!

Very good egg salad.  I halved the recipe, then also haved the mayo amount (I used 1/2 lite mayo & 1/2 lite miracle whip).  There was plenty of sauce mixture for the eggs.  I also added green onion instead of dried.  This makes for a great ww meal--3 points per serving, plus whatever bread you use.

My husband said this was the best egg salad sandwich he has ever had. BUT.... there are some things I didnt like and would change: The amount of minced onions (1/4 c) was way too much!!! I added about half and it was still too oniony for my tastes. Plus, the minced onions are even stronger than fresh. I think I would have rather had fresh minced onion. It wouldnt have been so overpowering. Next, the dill weed was a new thing to me so I just added 3/4 tsp. instead of 1 tsp. It was good. I think 1 tsp. would probably have been just fine. 

So, to sum it up, great recipe, but I would have used 1/8 cup of fresh minced onion. The onion flakes were just faaaaarrr too strong!

Simple and simply fabulous.  I make it all the time just as the recipe calls for.  I have two "gormet" variations that work great with this on flat bread or foccacia with fresh spinich leaves.  Use 1/2 Tblsp groud cumin or curry powder.

This recipe is good, but only with a few changes.  I used just a little over half the amount of mayonnaise called for (it was perfect that way--the full amount would have been way too much for us!), and I used 1/4 tsp of onion powder instead of onion flakes.  I also added a bunch of chopped celery.

GREAT! The best egg salad recipe ever. The mustard powder is the difference, all the flavor none of the tang. You can actually taste the egg too. I did not add garlic powder or onion powder because they were not flavors I was interested in today...but this is the best ever.

I thought your recipe was great! I used miracle whip light instead of mayo and it turned out delicious! The dill weed flavor came out once I put it in the fridge for about an hour.

Good recipe, but I use onion powder insted of onion flakes because there is just something a little wrong about eating egg salad with crunchies, it makes me think that I missed an egg shell somewhere.

Loved this one! My 5 year old ate it for days...and she's awfully picky. I followed the recipe, but added a stalk of diced celery & a few green onions. Made it great. Just don't tell my 5 year old there was celery in there!

Too much mayo and too much salt.  Recipe calls for 8 eggs,to fix the mayo disaster I had to put an extra 8 in.

This was an awesome recipe!! The only change I made was instead of using 1 1/2 cups mayonaise, I used 1 cup mayo and 4oz of cream cheese. The cream cheese makes it creamier and it DONT GET RUNNY!!!!!!!!!!

Personally, I thought this recipe was a good example of over-egging the pudding. I didn't like the onion in it at all, and the mustard and dill were just too much. I'll stick with the good old-fashioned egg/mayo/s&p. Thanks anyway.

This was really good! I love the dill and even added a little extra. I chopped up a little onion instead of flakes and used garlic salt since I was out of garlic powder and didn't add any additional salt. This was a great egg salad.

The best eggsalad recipe ever!!! I like spices a lot so I went a little heavier on them, extra heavy on the dill. I served on honey Hawaiian rolls with 2 slices of bacon on each sandwich ... it was a huge hit!

There was too much mayo for the amount of eggs. Instead of onion flakes, I used half the amount in onion powder. To make it healthier, I recommend 1/2 cup nonfat plain Greek yogurt plus 1/4-1/2 cup mayo.

Egg Salad is one of those sandwiches that I always forget about, but when I get to making it, I remember how much I love them. This was a great recipe. It was a little heavy on the mayo side, but I'll know to just cut back a smidge next time. Otherwise, delicious!

This definitely had way too much salt, and too much mayonnaise; it drowned out almost all of the egg flavor, and left you with basically a garlic/pickle taste without the crunch.  Not a fan.  Maybe we were just used to the less-is-more way we remember our moms making it when we were kids; a bit drier (less mayo), and just enough salt so the egg wasn't completely bland, and a bit of black pepper.  Maybe she put mustard in there - that part was pretty good in this recipe, and though I'm a fan of dill and certainly garlic, it just didn't play out in this concoction very well.  Unless you plan on adding a bunch of smaller items (diced/minced onion, minced garlic, celery, bacon/ham bits, or whatever else) - definitely cut the mayo down and add gradually to taste; that part was a huge factor, I think, in why this didn't work.

So easy and delicious. Definitely use fresh diced or minced onion instead of dried, and you can cut back the mayonnaise to 2/3 cup. Otherwise excellent as stated.

Awesome...just made this recipe halved with leftover eggs from Easter recipes.  Love it and will definitely do this again.  Only change was adding approx 1/4 of onion diced instead of onion flakes and substituting onion salt for salf.

Made this yesterday right before lunch so we were eating it within the hour...  my husband thought I should have stuck to his mother's recipe...  :(  But when we had left overs today - it was a completely different story.  Letting the flavors blend overnight - made all the difference!!  He has changed his tune!  Thanks for the great recipe!

My husband and I thought this recipe was perfect. Beware, though!  It has tons of calories from the mayo content and is very salty.  We both thought it tasted great and wouldn't alter a thing.

Gave it 4 stars because I did tweak just a bit:  Used about a tablespoon of minced fresh onion instead of dried.  Used 1 teaspoon of regular mustard instead of powder.  Omitted garlic powder because I don't like it.  But it was delicious! Ate it on Friehoffer's Country White bread. Yum!

I always love trying new recipes and have made egg salad several times before.  Prepared this one day and my husband commented "Perfect!  Keep this recipe!"  Absolutely delicious.  I never seem to have mustard powder on hand so I used a tablespoon of stone ground mustard and also decreased the amount of mayo--one cup is just too "saucy" for me.

This was a great way to use of some eggs that were needing used. The only think I did differently was that I used chopped red onion instead of the flakes because I like the crunch they add.

These were great...  a hit at a potluck and then a hit at a picnic with a bunch of kindergarteners!  I added celery both times but otherwise left the recipe as is.  Delicious!  I will be making this again!!

LOVE, LOVE, LOVe this egg salad!  Just made it tonight, and it's the second time I have made it.  (I ate all of it up last week.)  The second time I made it, I made some changes-I cut back to 1/2 cup mayo, and 1/4 tsp. salt.  I sprinkled some paprika on both times.  Very important that if you use the dry onion flakes that you refrigerate it 8 hrs or overnight as stated, so it isn't crunchy.  I just love the unique blend of dill, garlic and onion in this egg salad.

I didn't like this at all........for me the dill weed just mad the whole thing bad........I see that many people like this recipe a lot and this may be personal taste. So.........if you don't like dill weed DON'T MAKE THIS RECIPE!!! For me, it just wasted a lot of ingredients. I usually really like egg salad but this one didn't cut it. Well.......I tried!

Had to find something to do with the dyed EAster eggs, and this fit the bill.  Love this salad.  Like many other people, I didn't have dried onion flakes, so I just used some fresh, diced onion.  Mine turned out extra colorful due to the Easter Eggs, but it was delish!!

I made this as posted except the additon of 1/3 cup of plain bread crumbs and the reason of the addition of bread crumbs is because when I make tuna salad I use dried minced onion [instead of fresh] and bread crumbs and it is amazing!! This also came out amazing - I guess people find it strange to use dried onion but it works wonderfully in absorbing excess moisture in salad like these.  The dried mustard is also great because it does eliminate the vinegary taste which reminds me of deviled eggs instead of classic egg salad. The only thing I would do different next time is add fresh dill instead of dried.

I adore egg salad, but I did not care for this version. I did reconstitute the onion flakes beforehand, but I did not care for the flavor they and especially the garlic and dill added to it.  Maybe I prefer a more 'plain' version than others though. I think I'll stick with mayo, mustard, celery and a bit of relish. Thanks though!

I am not traditionally an egg salad fan, but we were not eating our easter eggs quickly enough so I gave this one a try.  I really liked it - it's got a nice kick to it!  I had to make some substitutions based on what I had on hand: 2 diced dill pickle spears for the dill weed, real onion for flakes, and I cut the mayo in half.  I will make again!

I love this recipe.  Great for sandwiches.  I think it is well seasoned and tastes very fresh and Springy with the dill.  I've substituted fresh for dried for the onions and dill and enjoy it just as much.  Sometimes I add a little more of each seasoning and some black pepper.  If the dried minced onions are used, don't forget to let the egg salad sit for a few hours or overnight so they aren't crunchy.

This is a delicious recipe.  Some have made a comment about the dried onions, but I believe that is why Sara says to cover and refrigerate at least 8 hours, this then makes the onions soft and delicious! The only thing I changed, to cut out some fat/calories, is I put a 1/2 cup of mayonnaise instead of 1 cup.  Thank you Sara!  We love it!

The Dill was just too much, very overpowering.  It was too differnet than traditional egg salad, I was looking for something just a little different.

Soooo good and simple since you would most likely have all the ingredients in the cupboard.  I substituted onion powder for the flakes.  People ate them so fast I literally had to run to the kitchen to make more, and when I got back someone had ate my sandwich right off my plate!

I scaled this down for one, but I used 1 egg, 1 egg white, 2 T Miracle Whip lite, and everything else (except dill since I don't have any). It sat in the fridge overnight with some romaine lettuce keeping the bread dry and it was AWESOME!!! Thanks so much for a great recipe! Next time I might add some more mustard and garlic though. :)

Great egg salad.  Don't change a thing!  Definitely good to make it the day before, though.  I don't have mustart powder in the house, so I simply use prepared mustard.

I just made this egg salad today..It is good with the exception of the onion flakes.  While it needs the onion flavor (I'd probably use onion powder or onion salt next time), the flakes give it a rough/crunchy consistency.  It's like I'm chomping on egg shell bits would be my description. Otherwise, a good egg salad.

I found that the dill and onion were overpowering to the salad flavor. Next time I will cut back on both.

very good BUT i will add my changes..in agreeance with the other reviewers i'm not into the onion flakes, however i added onion powder (which i use in everything) and fresh chopped green onions (whites and greens) i used prepared lemon as i didnt have a fresh lemon, and instead of prepared yellow mustard i used 1/2 honey mustard and 1/2 horshradish dijon mustard (i dont care for yellow mustard) but the whole cup of mayo is TOO MUCH> i used 1/4 cup and it came out perfect. of course that a personal preference but i "personally" dont need that much fat. the dill weed is THE BEST!! it really adds a unique spin and the flavor is phenominal. easy and super fast..the longest part was waiting for the mixed egg salad to chill before i could eat it. yum!

just ok. I don't like raw onion so I thought this recipe would work out for me but I found it was missing the extra crunch and texture from using actual relish.  I also think the relish gives it a nice fresh taste that you don't get when you rely all on seasoning. Sorry but this was just ok.

Terrific, all I can say is after 32 yrs. of marriage...my husband finally raved over my egg salad. The only thing I omitted was the salt, I never add salt to anything!

I actually only used half a cup of mayo and added a teaspoon of sweet relish. I served it for a bridal shower, and it was a HUGE success. 11 women asked me for the recipe and fought over the last one. I am still getting emails about it

I couldn't decide whether to give this 3 stars of 4 because it is waaaaay to much mayo. I cut the recipe in half using 4 eggs and it called for 1/2 cup of mayo. I started with a 1/4 cup of mayo and oh my god my eggs were swimming. I was very dissappointed although the flavor was good. I put it in the fridge and the next day decided to give it a try and oh my god it was perfect. Start of with a small amount of mayo depending on egg size, mine were large. The next day this salad was gone in minutes...so thanks for the recipe. I added chopped pickles.mmmm!

I can't imagine a better recipe for egg salad! I used light mayo and cut it down to about 2/3c. Also used finely chopped fresh onion instead of dried flakes, and cut the pepper in half. I won't make this often because of the fat content, but it really is delicious!

Good recipe. A little heavy on the mayo for my taste, and I use 12 eggs not the 8 called for.  Didn't have any dill so I added some juice from the pickle jar.  That was a good addition.  Most of my kids enjoyed it (nearly impossible to make something they all enjoy!).

Very good egg salad.  I used half the dill and half the mayo and chopped scallions the second time I made it and it was even better!  But I do like the idea of using onion flakes just for the ease of it.

I am sorry, I did not stick to the original recipe. I was trying to make it a little healthier & 1 c. mayo was too much. I used 6 Tbls light mayo and 1/2 c fat free plain yogurt. I also omitted the salt. This was very good. Thank you for sharing.

Absolutely delicious!  I did modify it in that I used 1/2 Mayo and 1/2 Miracle Whip and I made a larger batch so I had to modify that amounts.  And instead of dried onion flakes, I used onion powder.  This is wonderful!

Liked the little kick of the mustard powder but, even with some chopped celery added, this was a little bland for my taste. Maybe will add some chopped sweet pickles or hot pepper flakes next time. Good way to use up all the Easter eggs though!

Ok, I love egg salad.  I love dill.  I love salt.  Why don't I love this?  Because it has way too much dill and salt.  I really don't know about the mustard powder either.  Next time, I'm going to use prepared mustard, pickle relish instead of dill and cut wayyyyy down on the salt.  I'll probably add a little paprika as well. :(

This was a great recipe. I have to admit that I was skeptical about the onion flake, so I cut the amount in half. It turned out great! Next time, I will try the full amount of onion flake. This is a definite keeper!

Almost as good as my grandma's egg salad sandwich.  I cut the mayo to 2/3 cup, added more garlic powder, paprika, dill weed and mustard powder to taste and added cilantro.  I also soaked the onion flakes as others mentioned so I could eat it right away.

I didn't care too much for the dill weed.  I only added 1/4 tsp, but I may omit it next time.  Essentially, I cut all seasonings in half and only added 1/4 tsp of dried minced onions.  The kids ate it, so I was happy.

I used 1/4 chopped red onion in place of the dried onion and added three diced garlic dills. After trying it, I did add a tbsp. of lemon juice and paprika like other reviewers have. We like a crunchier egg salad. This would be good with diced celery, too. I'd make this again.

I used onion powder instead of dried onions and next time won't use any at all and will reduce the garlic powder, it kind of over powered it.  I also added some paprika.  I will also increase the dill.  Family liked it.

Great recipe.  I added paprika and didn't have dry mustard so I used prepared mustard.  Also, no point in using dry onion flakes.  Put the real stuff in if you like onions.  Turned out pretty good.

We ate the salad right away w/o chilling it. This was a good recipe (I adjusted it for serving of two) & ended up halving all the seasonings & mayo amount (didn't have onion flakes, so I used real onion & seasoned with paprika, omitted salt since enough salt for us from the mayo). 
With any seasonings I learned to flavor it slowly by having repeated tasting tests & then adding more seasonings as needed to adjust for everyone. Will definitely make again!

Great recipe, I followed the recipe at first & it was good, however I thought it needed a little more kick, so I added some extra salt & some extra dill. I took these to a baby shower & they were devoured. Great recipe!!

this recipe was good, but I did change it a lot to get it there...  I used only 1/3 of the mayo called for and it still seemed like a lot.  I used fresh onion, spicy brown mustard, and chili powder (I don't have paprika or I would have tried that instead).  I don't think I would have liked it as much if I made it exactly as the recipe says, but it was a good starting point.

We've made this recipe several times. I have omitted the onion flakes, but add fresh grated onion. I'm not much of a raw onion fan so this adds the flavor that is needed for us.

I do not know what I was looking for, but I certainly found it in this recipe! I used a tablespoon of finely minced sweet onion instead of onion flakes. I didn't have any dill so I used a combination of sweet&dill relish in my salad. Like other reviewers, I reduced the salt and also added paprika. This was so good. I will definitely be making this often.
(For those saying that they found something to be missing, you may want to try a dash or two of hot sauce. It's a 'secret' ingredient in many mayo-based salads like this.)

The mustard powder was overwhelming and left a bitter taste. Same with the garlic powder. I much prefer my own recipe, using all the ingredients listed, but fresh. Diced onion (very small amount) and regular yellow mustard. No garlic. Would not make this again.

Super Yummy! My husband was getting tired of the meat sandwiches I packed for his lunch.So I thought I would try this one for a change in the week. It was a hit!The only things I changed in the recipe was replace a couple of the dried Ingredients for fresh ones. Diced red onions in place of the dried onion flakes, and gouldens spicy brown mustard instead of the dried mustard powder. I always prepare his lunches the night before, so I really think keeping it in the fridge over night really helped blend all the seasonings together. He now has asked for the lunch at least twice a week! Thanks!

This was great.  Except the recipe is too big.  I used 7 eggs for only 7 people and it made 5 sandwiches.  Everything else was great.

This was a pretty good recipe.  I will probably make again.  I did add the paprika like another reviewer suggested, but still missing something--maybe a little sugar?

Absolutely the best egg salad I have ever had.  Tons of flavor.  The only thing I did different was to add chives instead of the onion and that is mostly because I love onion, but it doesn't love me!!  Really good, try it.

Delicious! I used fresh onions and celery, chopped very fine.  I used 1/2 cup miracle whip and 1/4 cup mayo. Both my mother and I had seconds!  She said it was the best egg salad she's ever had- the dill really made it great.

This recipe uses way too much onion - it's all I could taste. I think 1 tablespoon is quite sufficient. The only thing I changed was using dried dill. I won't be making this again.

This was a very good salad. I used freshly chopped onion, regular yellow mustand and fresh dill instead and served it on a sandwich bun with butter lettuce and a slice of tomatoe. Very good. I though 1 cup of mayo would be too much but it was perfect.

Very good, but I think I prefer it with dill relish instead of dill weed. I used 9 eggs (grated on the large side of a box grater, it's faster and easier than dicing!), around 3/4 cup mayo, maybe 2 TBS of finely diced yellow onion, 1 TBS of prepared yellow mustard, some salt and pepper, and the dill weed. I served it on white bread with a lettuce leaf and some celery salt and pepper. Maybe it would have been better if it had sat longer in the fridge (I made it 1½ hours before we ate), but the dill flavor wasn't as pronounce as I'd hoped. Oh, well, it was still very good. Thanks for sharing, Sara!

I wasn't crazy about this.  I don't know what it was or wasn't though...I love egg salad, but hadn't had it in a long time.  Maybe I don't like dill as much as I thought I did?

I've made egg salad sandwiches many times, and never used a recipe.  I decided to try a recipe this time to make it even better.  This one is really good.  Although I really like dill, I halved the amount of dill just like the other "dill lovers" suggested in their reviews.  I also halved the amount of mayo.  I can't have onion (migraine trigger) and don't really like it anyway.  I did add a tablespoon or 2 of dried chives, though.

I made this for lunch today following the recipe exactly except I soaked the dried onion flakes in hot water until they were soft, and then chilled the egg salad for an hour and a half.  It was absolutely wonderful!  My hubby freaked out and begged for seconds because it was so good!

I also used fresh, chopped onion instead of dried - and I agree with another poster that the dried mustard was a nice touch - but the dill weed was too overwhelming.  My husband and I usually enjoy dill flavor, so I thought we would like this recipe, but in our opinion, it calls for WAY too much dill weed. My husband couldn't eat it at all, and I could only eat it if I spread it on the bread very, very thin.  I will probably make this recipe again, but I will definitely cut down on the dill weed or substitute pickle relish instead.

Very good recipe for a rookie egg salad maker.  I think egg salad and your likes/dislikes depends on what you grow up with.  To adjust to our tastes, I reduced the amount of mayo by about half (used light, not full fat), used a tablespoon of brown mustard, real onion and 2 stalks of finely chopped celery.  My husband likes dill pickle relish in his, I like sweet relish, so I didn't add any.  You could also add some finely chopped green olives or pimentos.  I did not add much dill, just a sprinkle for some color.

This was my second time making this recipe and I liked it more this time. I omitted the onion flakes as I don't care for onion much and just used onion salt in place of the salt (and less than called for). I also only used about 3/4 cup mayo and that was the perfect consistency for me. Finally, I do love dill, but I think there is a bit too much in this recipe. Bottom line, this is really tasty, but it's not my favorite. I'll keep looking for a perfect egg salad. Thank you :)

This is very good, but I used green onions instead and I also omitted the salt, as I think it is salty enough. Put on some Hawaiian bread with lettuce and it was very tasty. Oh, and I also added celery as I love celery in my egg salad.

Definitely needs to sit overnight to let the flavors mellow together, it tasted better after sitting, so don't try to skip that step! :)  I hesitated at the 1/4 c. of onion, and added only half, which was plenty.  

*Very* flavorful, a little overpowering.  Thanks for submitting!  :)

YUMMY!!! This is the best egg salad ever!  I made some minor changes and additions and it has received rave reviews.  I used dried onions (only 1.5 TBLS) but soaked them in hot water for 30 minites first.  I used 1/2 cup miracle whip instead of 1 cup, 1 tsp spicy brown mustard in addition to the mustard powder and lowered the salt to 1/4 tsp.  I also added 3 drops of jalepeno flavored tabasco.  Although it was tasty enough to eat immediately, it was even better after marinating in the refrigerator for a while.  Thanks for the recipe.

I thought this was REALLY good.  I did have to make some changes or else it would have been a 5 star recipe.  I began by using the whole amount of mayo but with only 8 eggs it was way to much.  So I had to add more eggs.  I think I added 7 more.  I also only added about a tablespoon of dried onions and I thought that was perfect.  The flavor only gets better the next day.  Yum!

This was great!  I used light mayo, otherwise followed the recipe to the letter.  I tasted it immediately after putting it together and wasn't too impressed, but after refrigerating overnight, the flavors really came together.  I like lots of onion, but if you're not a big fan, you might want to cut back on the amount.  This will be my go-to recipe for all of those leftover Easter eggs.  Thanks!

I used onion powder, a dash of salt, and bottled mustard. I didn't have dill weed so we made it without. My husband loved the it and have asked me to make it again.

Great salad! I used egg whites, light mayo and since I had no mustard powder added yellow and dijon mustard.

For all of you who love dill this recipe will be terrific.  I only like dill so thought it was a little overwhelming.  Next time I will use less dill.  Keep the party going though as this recipe deserves a high rating.

For my tastes, I give the recipe a 3* rating as is.  I like to taste the egg in egg salad.  I ended up adding 4 more eggs and adjusting the salt & pepper to taste. I creamed/smashed the egg yolks into the mayo mixture til smooth, then added the chopped egg white.  Next time I will probably just reduce the mayo/spice mixture.  The combination of flavors is a nice.

This is not only GREAT, but simple and fast to make.  The dill taste is incredible.  I did not have any mustard powder, so I used regular yellow mustard and it was perfect.  Thanks for the recipe!

I love egg salad sandwiches but this just didn't do it for me. And although I like onions, I would prefer this without the onion flakes. I added some prepared mustard and a splash of vinegar, which is what I usually add to my regular recipe. It was nice to try a different variation of this recipe.

This is a great egg salad recipe.  I thought it was a bit heavy on the mayo so I backed that off a bit.  I also used fresh minced onion in place of the dried.  The other measurements seemed right on and it is very tasty.

This sandwich was delicious. I made it on white bread, but a wheat bread would have been great as well. Next time I may try toasting the bread, which I think would also be good. The egg salad is one of the best I ever had, the perfect flavor of egg and spices - neither is too overwhelming.

With a few modifications, this was awsome! I reduced the mayo to 3/4 cup, used 3 tsp. onion powder instead of minced, and used 2 tsp. mustard powder instead of 1 and added 1/4 cups bacon pieces. I love the dill! Also, I have made a low fat version, with half the fat and calories of the regular and it's almost as good. I just subed 1/2 C low fat mayo and only used half of the egg yolks. Will definitely use recipie again and again!

With some minor modifications for personal taste, I really liked this salad.  (I used half of the mustard powder and onion flakes suggested.) I thought the amount of mayonaisse was way too much, but I ate the salad with wheat pita bread, which tends to be dry, and it was just right.  If I were to serve this with other bread, I would probably use less mayo.

This was good.  The only thing I would change is to use onion powder or real onion in place of the flakes.  I didn't like the crunchiness.  I would make this again.  It was a nice change from the usual egg salad.

I only used 1/2 cup mayo. Did not have dill weed so chopped up a dill pickle and used that. Loved the onion flakes in place of real onion. This was creamy, light and delicious.

Awesome Egg Salad!! I love anything with dill in it. It tastes amazing! I did change it to grated fresh onion, like some of the other reviewers suggested. This is definitely  a keeper and I will be making it again.

Love this recipe! I always use miracle whip, mustard, celery and paprika which is a good basic recipe. I tried this recipe just as is with real mayonnaise and dry mustard rather than miracle whip and yellow mustard that I’ve always used. The result was a creamier egg salad with no vinegar flavor. I wasn’t sure about using dill weed but it adds a great unexpected layer of flavor. It is a smoother, more blended taste bursting with flavor. This is definitely a step up from my good ole stand by recipe. Thanks for sharing!

Very yummy, definitely need the dill weed. I used 1/2 cup mayo and it was plenty. I also used prepared yellow mustard instead of mustard powder and diced onion instead of onion flakes. Will try adding paprika next time.

Made as the recipe stated. I found this terrific recipe years ago here on AllRecipes, and I have been using it whenever I want egg salad sandwiches. I never change anything in the recipe, it stands out just as is.

Great egg salad recipe! I used 1 tsp of onion powder instead of minced or raw onion and added two pieces of chopped cooked bacon and it turned out delicious!

Came out eggcellent. I omitted the onion as I don't like it. I also used white pepper instead of black. I think the taste is milder. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe showed up at the perfect time...due to too a surplus of eggs in the fridge. Subbed real onions (green onions, to be exact) and added paprika...I really didn't measure anything, but I definitely didn't use 1 whole cup of mayo...awesome recipe...I love the reviews that give a few added hints. Thanks Sara!!

I buttered my white bread and cut off the crust before placing the egg mixture on top. Then I sliced it into two rectangle strips. Reminded me of Tea Time in London.

Excellent!  I used real purple onion instead of flakes, added finely chopped celery (I like it a little crunch to my egg salad!) and then I served it on a bagel dressed with a sliced tomato.  Loved it!

I never have liked Egg Salad. However, I decided to try this recipe. I am now a lover of Egg Salad Sandwiches. OMG this was so good! Maybe it's because I don't like the traditional... The dill made it taste great. I did use fresh onion.

I also thought it was missing something, so I added a bit of smoked paprika.  This recipe was tasty to begin with, but the paprika added a little something extra.

very good! I wanted to make a lower fat version, so I substituted low fat plain yogurt for the mayo. Instead of the dried onion, I used minced onion. I also added a touch of lemon juice and some chopped black olives. Great flavor!

This is a good recipe. I had a feeling the onion might be a little over-powering for my taste so I reduced the amount to 1/8 C. My hubby isn't too crazy about dill, I decreased it as well to 1/2 tsp. It still turned out tasty!   We also liked eating it on hamburger buns instead of regular bread.  It was a little firmer to the bite.

This was so bad that my husband and I could not finish our sandwitch! We would much rather have a plain old egg salad. The dill weed added a really funny flavor.

Great job Sarah! I was craving egg salad the other day and decided to try this. I didn't have onion flakes so I used 1/4 c. diced onion. It's bursting with flavor! I just finished making a second batch...can't wait--YUM!

Delicious, with a comfort food quality that we love. The dill and dried mustard are wonderful additions. We use 1/4 cup finely diced onions instead of the dried onion flakes.

I made this egg salad for a co-workers bridal shower, and now I get requests to make it whenever we have a treat day at work. I have never changes a thing; the recipe is perfect the way it is. Just one hint, if you scale it to make enough for a crowd, make less than what you think, it makes a lot!

I doubled the recipe and only used about 1 cup of mayo, didn't have dill on hand, but I threw in 1-2tbsp of Tastefully Simple's Onion Onion mix and 2tsp mustard.  It is excellent! We serve these on whole wheat pitas.

for me this was just a little bland. I've never had egg salad without relish, so I added some diced bread and butter pickles (I had no actual relish on hand). I also added paprika and omitted the dill weed, mainly because I didn't have any, but I might get some and try next time. Like others I also used fresh chopped onion instead of flakes. I stuck with 8 eggs and just used the rest of te recipe as a guide rather than actually measuring everything. oh, and I used about 1 to 1.5 tsp mustard instead of mustard powder (like you would potato salad) all in all a good recipe with some tweaking.

I made this for mother's day b/c my sil is a vegetarian.  She loved it and the rest of us loved it, including my hubby!  This is the first egg salad recipe I've tried, but don't think I need to try another one.  I followed the directions exactly, no changes and it was a huge hit.  thanks!

I liked the flavor of the egg salad, but found it way too strong. I only used half the dill and substituted green onions for the dried ones. I ended up adding 4 more eggs to calm down the intense flavor. Maybe my eggs were smaller or something.

this is very good egg salad.  a few small tweaks the second time i made it made it sing.  i cut the mayo down to 3/4 cup, took out the salt altogether, added plenty of paprika and threw in 1 T. of white vinegar.  delicious.  can't wait until next easter surplus of eggs!

Best egg salad sandwich I've ever had!  The dill definitely adds something to the flavor!  I did make a couple additions though, some smoked paprika, a little dijon mustard, didn't have onion flakes so I used powder and I also added a little garlic salt.  Excellent

This was very good!  I cut recipe to 3 servings, which actually yielded 4. Tasted very "dilly", so reduce dill weed to 1/4 tsp. Added 1/4 tsp paprika. Served with lettuce.  Dill spears and carrots on the side complemented very well.

This is excellent as is. I omitted the salt and added chopped green olives. You have to be careful not to add too many or the salt overtakes the flavor. Thanks for the post

I used this recipe for deviled eggs but sprinkled the paprika on top of the eggs instead of mixing it in. Got rave reviews for the deviled eggs. Thanks for sharing a terrific recipe that jazzes up the tried and true! I will use this recipe for a long time to come.

My husband said this was the best egg salad he has ever had!  The only change I made (out of lack of ingredients) was to use Caraway instead of Dill. (Can't believe I didn't have dill on hand.)  It actually made a nice twist and it was delicious!

Had to add some paprika to it.  Forgot to put any type of onion in it, and as for mayo, I just put it enough for the consistency I preferred :)  I've never had egg salad, and this turned out great.  My husband loves it, too.

YUM!!! My mom and I were craving egg salad and this hit the spot! I did exactly as the recipe said except I didn't have any onion so I left it out and added a dash of paprika and lemon juice. Oh and I also added some pickle for crunch! This will definitely be my go to recipe for egg salad!

** Fabulous recipe** The dill adds a great flavor, which is a nice change from the same'ol egg salad. The only addition I made was a 1/2 cup cooked,  finely chopped bacon, otherwise I followed the recipe as written. I also ate this on an Oat Bran Pita pocket with lettuce . NUM YUMMY !!

I think the mayo would have been overkill in this recipe had I used the original amount.  I definitely cut it down noticeably.  I think the key ingredient missing from this egg salad is chopped celery.  Egg salad really needs that crunch.  Anyway, the spice combination didn't really impress me.

Delicious. I will never buy deli egg salad sandwiches again! The only change I made was use only 3/4 cup mayo.

It needs some crunch!   A 1/2 tablespoon/sandwich of chopped fresh onion and celery improved it for us.  Used 1/2 the mayo. One egg/sandwich is plenty for us. We like the flavor a lot.

By far the best egg salad I've ever had. The dill weed and mustard powder work perfectly together. I didn't have any onion flakes but I don't think that made a huge difference.

This is an excellent egg salad base, however, I thought it was kind of bland. I read some of the other suggestions and limited the salt and added paprika. It was still very tastless to me so I added about 2-3 teaspoons of spicy brown mustard and this did the trick! Excellent flavor and just a little bit of kick to it. Very creamy. I suggest you omit the mustard powder and use real mustard instead.
Update: I have started using the Pampered Chef's Dill mix with this and it makes it perfect! I make it the day before I need it and all the dry spices in the dill mix will rehydrate themselves. This can also be done with the minced onions the recipe calls for. Simply let it set over night or for a few hours and all the spices will be moist enough and not crunchy at all. I plan on adding in some chopped celery the next time I make this.

I did not care for this, way too many onion flakes.  My husband, however, ate it but he said he was hungry.  Wanted to try something different then just salt and pepper and Miracle Whip but should've just stuck with the usual.

This egg salad is great! Perfect for a shower, luncheon, or if you have company. Easy to put together! I used some of the other suggestions by adding an extra egg, reducing the mayo, and reducing the onion flakes. Overall great recipe! Will make again!

This recipe was great.  I didn't have dill the first time so I omitted it.  It was wonderful.  The second time I put the dill in.  It was too much for me.  Next time I'll either leave the dill out completely or use half.

These were very bland, in my opinion.  I thought they were ok, but my husband really didn't like them. I added some cut up sweet pickles and that improved the taste, but still not the best egg salad recipe out there.

I enjoyed this recipe, with two minimal modifications.  I don't like egg salad to be too moist, and I reduced the mayonnaise by 1/4.  I also reduced the amount of onion by half, because it overpowered the flavor for my taste.  Other than that, it was great and I used it for a baby shower/tea party.

I thought this recipe was fantastic!  I did use seasoned salt instead of regular and probably didn't use all the mayo because I just added enough until it was the consistency that I wanted.  It was very smooth and flavorful.  Definitely the recipe I will use from now on.

Love the dill in this egg salad.  Yum!  It may be better for this to sit for an hour or so to give time for the onion flakes to hydrate before eating.

I've tried quite a few different kinds of egg salad and this is my absolute favorite! The dill adds a really nice flavor to the mix, and the mustard powder rather than mustard makes it not quite so juicy. Five stars!

What a wonderful egg salad recipe.  One of the better ones that I have found, at least.  However, I accidentally put about a 1/4 cup of chopped onion in the recipe instead of the minced onion.  Wow...what was I thinking?  I will use much less real onion next time, but this one is definitely a keeper!

Good recipe, nice change from yellow mustard and sweet relish. Only 4 stars because I added a lot less of the onion (I only had powder on hand) and it was fine but would have been overwhelming with the full amount.

I made this and it had way to much dill for me. Thats all I could really taste. I'm an egg salad lover and this one just didn't fit my taste buds.

Every recipe I have tried from this site has been 5 stars.  With that being said, I had just been been out to lunch and saw the yummiest egg salad so I came home to make some.  In fact, I made a double batch exactly as the recipe states and it was so overwhelming with salt flavor and dill that I could not take another bite.  I added more eggs and mayo but still horrible.  In an effort to not throw out any food I resorted to adding tuna and in the end had to add 5 cans of tuna with another cup of mayo just to tone down the saltiness and make this edible.  Not great, just edible and I now have enough tuna/egg salad to feed an army.  Very disappointed!

As a kid, I would never touch an egg salad sandwich. Now that I'm older, I've found myself to be quite a fan of them. I made my sandwich exactly, but I left out the mustard powder because I didn't have any. However, I'll be picking some up because I'm sure I'll be making this sandwich often. Great tasting and easy, thanks!

I cooked this recipe for my husband who loves egg salad sandwiches.  He agreed with other reviewers that there was way too much dill.  I will probably only put in about 1/4-1/2 of the amount of dill the recipe called for next time.  Other than that, my husband said it could be a very good recipe.  I will try making it again!

Very yummy! I used fresh garlic, dill and onion though, and cayenne instead of black pepper. Plus I addes diced red pepper and celery. I like the slight pickle-y taste

Great recipe!! I took others' suggestion and used real onion as well as adding some chopped celery just because it wouldn't be egg salad for me w/o celery. Delicious and exactly what I was looking for!

I made this for a baby shower. It was such a HIT!!! Everyone was asking for the recipe and said it was the best egg salad sandwich they have ever tasted. I served it on wheat bread with the crust cut off. YUMMY!

I used fresh onion instead of dried. I think it tastes good and my kids love it, but it's a little runnier that I would like. I will try cutting back on the mayo next time. Overall a good recipe.

I thought this was very good--I like dill and didn't think it was overpowering at all but gave it a little different taste.  Based on other reviews, I cut the mayo in half and that seemed to be just right.  Also, I used fresh chopped onion instead of the onion flakes.

Great egg salad recipe. I made it a few times and it continues to go over very well. I use fresh onions and reduce the salt. I just add the amount of mayo needed by my own judgement so it is always perfect. The dill is the real secret ingredient for this one. Thanks

I love this recipe.  I have made it several times and it's a very easy quick lunch to mkae.  I usually leave the onion flakes out so that I can eat it right away and I don't miss them at all.

I loved this recipe but the dried flakes made the egg salad crunchy which I didn't like.  Next time, I'll use onion powder instead.

I suspected what I was in for when I opened the container to taste test the egg salad after it had "brewed" in the fridge for a few hours.  I followed the recipe to the letter and I usually agree with most raters but this is WAY WAY too oniony.  I can't taste anything except a lot of onion with a subtle hint of dill.  There is no egg taste whatsoever in this egg salad.

I'm not usually a big fan of egg salad, but this was pretty good. I mashed up the eggs before adding the other ingredients, so it was very creamy.

I had a bunch of eggs and didn't know what to do with them, so I made this salad. Tasty! I did not have onion flakes on hand, so I used real onion. I didn't have dill either, so I used basil. I found the salad a little salty, so maybe I will only use 1/4 tsp of salt. Tastes great on a whole wheat pita. Thanks for the recipe.

I didn't alter anything in this recipe and it was really good. But for my taste, I would cut back a bit on the salt. The dill adds to the salty taste already. I think half the salt would be better.

Delicious...used dried onion in a pinch, but you really should let it chill in the fridge for a while to soften up and blend flavors. Better with fresh, only substitute was dijon mustard instead of mustard powder. Have made it many times, always yummy!

Easy and good.  Like others, I added fresh onion instead of dried -- I used it right away and everyone loved it -- I served with Romaine lettuce leaves on fresh whole wheat bread.

It was pretty good but the onion flakes and dill overpowered the dish.  Next time I will half their amounts.

I really liked the taste of it, it was a bit too creamy for me. I didn't add onion, I don't like it but if I had onion flakes I would have. I also didn't have dill weed, I had dill seed. My son ate it all. Will use again! Thanks

I loved the dill flavor of this recipe.  I took this and Cream of chicken and Wild Rice sout (from this site) over to friend's who were returning from vacation.  They were sure gald to see food in the fridge after a long day of traveling.

I used this recipe after my daughter requested egg salad for lunch one day.  Thanks- it is yummy.  I agree however that the onion is too much, I even only used a little bit.  I think that may be what some reviewers are talking about for after taste.  Other than that, I will use it again!

Mmmm... so good. I made this for dinner and ate the rest for breakfast this morning! I used it right away when I made it and it did taste better when it had sat in the refrigerator for a while. Still wonderful though! I didn't measure just eyeballed it and didn't use the mustard powder as I didn't have any on hand. I just used a couple squirts of French's spicy bold in it's place.

With Easter eggs to use up, I had to make this. I recommend reducing the amount of mayo to 1/2 cup -- and I added French's mustard for more zing. Its outstanding. Best egg salad recipe I've found.

made this recipe with our hard boiled easter eggs.  the kids thought it was great fun and ate it up.  i did use only half of the dill weed since it's not my favorite.  we will make this over and over again.

If you want fresh onion flavor but don't want the crunch in your salad, try grating the onion.

I love egg salad and your recipe was awesome Sara.  I scaled the servings down a bit since this was just for me. I did not use the dill, and substituted real mustard for the dried.  I also threw on some cheese and totally enjoyed this sandwich. Thanks for sharing.

I make my egg salad only with miriacl whip and eggs so I decided to try this. I like mine better. I didn't like the mustard taste in this one. I will stick to what I'm used to.

This recipe was pretty good.  I rated it a four because I didn't really care for the dillweed.  I believe it was a little much.  It wasn't the best, but it wasn't the worst either.

Fabulous!  I used fresh white onion and less mayo.  I didn't let it chill for very long and it still tasted great.

This was a very good egg salad recipe!  I followed the recipe, except adding regular mustard instead of powdered and a few mustard seeds for texture.  I plan on making it again using this recipe.  Next time I will just reduce the amount of dill slightly because it was somewhat overpowering.  Overall, delicious!

Initially, the amount of dill and onion scared me, but I went with the recipe as is anyway.  My husband and daughter both wanted seconds and begged me to make again.    Thanks for the recipe!

I liked it, but I omitted the dill due to the fact that I am not a big fan of it and used minced onions as opposed to the flakes. Overall, very tasty!
