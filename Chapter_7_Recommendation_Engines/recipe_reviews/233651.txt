Updated: To get your flour to stick, put your onions rings in a bowl of cold water before coating. Work with one or two at a time, shaking off excess water then toss into your bag of flour mix. This worked really well for me. I ended up with fully coated, crispy onion rings. Old review follows: These were really good for being baked. My flour didn't want to stick well and so I had only partially breaded rings when they were done. That didn't seem to hurt anything, though. They had enough coating to have a good crunch and with less coating, the onion flavor came through nicely. Also less coating meant less calories. I added some powdered garlic and onion to the flour mix. Great recipe!

For a baked version of onion rings these were very good.  I did add seasoning to the flour, egg white and panko crumbs.  Also, I found that using the convection setting on the oven helped to crisp them up really well.

I made these for dinner tonight.   I thought they were very good, coming in at half the calories as fried ones, this is a keeper. I baked for 15 minutes.  Next time I will go less than that; maybe 12.    The longer they cook, the crunchier they get, obviously.  I like the fact they were not as messy to make as frying.
I followed the recipe exactly.   I drizzled olive oil over them b4 baking

Not pleased at all with this recipe.  I made it as written.  The onion rings were bland, the coating was dry.  Not worth the time or effort.  My husband and son ate one or two, then left the rest on their plates.

I could eat 4 onions cooked like this! I added flavors to the different layers for fun. I am one of those people who uses the whole eggs, so yes I used 2 normal eggs, yokes and all. They turned out great! 12 minutes was perfect for mine!

It is really hard to duplicate deep fried onion rings.  These were quite good.  The difficult thing was trying to get the flour and then the panko bread crumbs to stick.  I will try them again.

Flavor was good.  But the pano did not stick.  Not so sure it's worth the mess.

Followed a previous persons recommendation and put the onions in water prior to the breading. Worked much better.

Made these with egg replacer and almond milk and they turned out fantastic! Not exactly like deep-fried oniony goodness, but I don't want to deal with the boiling fat and greasy cleanup.  This was a great recipe for the kids to help with.  We all giggled with tears in our eyes as we popped apart the rings from the onion slices as fast as was humanly possible!  The kids LOVED them, so I'm happy.  We'll definitely make this recipe again.

Great recipe! Used the tip from Mark and soaked the onion rings in cold water. Flour and crumbs stuck to rings very well!

Excellent! These were better than fried - and I love friend OR's.  Used the convection setting and they were perfect.  Also used Mark's suggestion of crisping-up in ice water (actually sliced and refrigerated in water most of the day).  Thank you again, Chef John

They need more flavour and maybe not so long in the oven
But definitely better for you than deep fried

I used saltine crackers in place of breadcrumbs because I did not have any and it turned out really amazing. I can't wait to see how it turns out with actual bread crumbs. Really easy to make and fun. Melt-in-your-mouth awesome

These are absolutely delicious!  All I did differently was season the flour a bit and spray with Pam before baking them. They were crispy, golden and so, so good.

I liked the results, but disagreed with the amount of ingredients. I used regular bread crumbs, not panko, but three cups? I used two cups and used less than half. Same with the flour. Still, not as good as fried (what is?), but a good recipe if you adjust it.

This is delicious! Great alternative to a fried onion ring.  I used a whole egg rather than egg whites. And I used almond milk rather than regular milk. Recipe still came out great :)

Pre-soaked the onions, added Italian seasoning to the panko, and loved every bite!  My only problem this time was that my pepper adhered to only the onions it touched and didn't redistribute during the shaking.  I'd recommend pre-mixing the salt and pepper with the flour or nixing this step all-together and applying salt and pepper to the finished onion rings to each person's taste.  I'll never buy pre-made onion rings again!

I made the recipe as is...except using whole eggs because of laziness. It was good. Not great, but good. Nice and crunchy but very bland. I will make again but add some seasoning. I didn't have the issue that other reviewers had with the coating not sticking. It might be that my onions are from the garden and stored on the counter (as opposed to in the fridge that seems very prevalent here in north America) so they are very juicy. All in all, a good recipe my 9 year old and my husband liked them after dipping them in ketchup. So I definitely think I will add more seasoning next time.

To be completely honest if I had watched the video I would not have used this recipe. I like old fashioned onion rings which can be adapted to baking. There is not enough coating for my taste. This is not to say the recipe is not good, it is just not my idea of onion rings.

I followed the recipe almost exactly, except I used a whole egg and added Italian seasoning to the coating flour. I brought them to a party, and they were a big hit. Two people even said the were BETTER than regular fried onion rings!

I think these were amazing and they were a hit at a party I had.    I used milk instead of water and added some cayenne pepper to the flour mixture to kick it up a bit.

I used Italian seasoned panko. The flavor is a bit bland, but  with a little tinkering, should be very adaptable to pretty much any palate. What I loved is the texture. They are super crunchy w/o all the fat from deep frying. I just added a little panko at a time and made sure to coat each ring. I ended up dipping  them in a chipotle ranch dip.

The breading didn't stick well for me even trying the other member's tip to use ice water. Still, these were delicious and retained enough coating to be good and, best of all, I could eat a huge serving of delicious onion rings for barely any calories at all! Much better one or two teensy regular onion rings in my opinion.

Yummy and easy to make. Yes, I need to make more because my 6-year-old triplets can't get enough of them!

These turned out great, I used regular bread crumbs because I didn't have panko.  Next time I will cut the onion rings bigger.

The Panko crumbs did not stick to the rings. I will not make these again! I would not recommend these to anyone that likes onion rings!

This is the worse recipe I've ever made. The flour barely clung to the onions, most of what was left came off in the egg dip, making a pasty mess in that bowl, since there was nothing left on the onions for the crumbs to stick to  most of them fell off.

I really loved these! I made them with sifted whole wheat flour.  My only regret is cooking them longer than I should have to properly freeze for frying or baking later. I got some 1 quart bags and the ones that weren't golden brown yet got put in the freezer for later. We had enough for two from the ones that got fully cooked, and two portions for a later dinner.
