i use serrano chiles instead of green chiles to give it a little more spice. this recipe can also be used to make pinto beans and it is just as delicious!

Turned out great and was easy to make.  I like to cook my tomato paste a little so I added before the beans.

Thank you for sharing this recipe. It is better and healthier than canned refried black beans. I made it twice already and is delicious every time. Since I like mine seasoned more, I used 3 cups of dried black beans (instead of 4 cups) and used the remaining ingredients as stated above for 4 cups.  I used a hand blender to emulsify the beans instead of a food processor so I can control the consistency better.  In addition, I added about half a cup of the reserve water to slightly thin out the emulsified beans.

A big hit at a church gathering! My husband added some hot sauce to his bowl and it added some bite to it if you like it a bit spicier.

First of all, this recipe makes enough beans to serve an army.  Keep that in mind.  I cut it in half and still had oodles.  I tried doing it without the aid of a food processor.  Those beans are harder to mash than they look.

This is a very good recipe I did not give it 5 stars because it was slightly lacking in flavor.  Very grateful however for the creativeness.

This recipe is flawless. The ingredients, their amounts, and cooking times are right on. You can freeze some before you mash them and they work perfectly! Thank you for the recipe.

Awesome recipe. I modified it a bit, chiefly by using black beans. I added in seasoned cooked ground turkey for a great taco salad/burrito ready made mix. I store some in fridge and some in freezer in meal sized packets. Thanks so much!

this is time intensive but worth it.
it has nice flavor and a zippy kick at the end, so if you don't like spicy you may want to tone it down a bit.
serving it with a little sour cream did the trick for me.
i also added a little grey sea salt after cooking was complete.

Excellent recipe! Amazing difference using fresh beans instead of canned and much better flavor than what is usually served at a restaurant! I found that I needed to slowly add more liquid (broth) when trying to blend the beans and to get them to the consistency we wanted. I left the beans simmering on low while other dishes were finishing and simply added a little more liquid when they seemed to be drying out a little. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I made this Refried Black Bean recipe Activity #4 in the Spring Bling event 2015. It is really easy to make with minimal work and great results for your efforts.  I accidentally used Kidney Beans instead of Black Beans but I think it is still worthy of a 5 star rating on allrecipes.
