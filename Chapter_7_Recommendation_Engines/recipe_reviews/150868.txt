Katie bar the door! As written this recipe will knock you back to last Tuesday! Try it with about 5oz espresso or strong coffee, a tablespoon of cream mixed into the coffee plus whipped cream and only an ounce of whiskey for a slightly more mellow drink. Slainte!

A warming cup of cheer for a cold winter's night.  Good balance of alcohol and sweet coffee. Mmmmmmm don't omit the whipped cream, it makes it!

We really enjoyed this coffee. I did not put quite as much Bushmills in mine. Jane
