Recipe Group: Yummy chicken. I cubed before marinating (I like to cut the chicken up while just a hair frozen, it's much easier). I used three breasts only because they were enormous. Only other change was to use bottled lemon juice instead of fresh. I soaked my bamboo skewers in water before threading the chicken on. It's a very easy recipe. I felt kinda bad throwing away a whole onion though; maybe a half onion would be enough to flavor. I convect roasted at 350 for about 20 minutes; served with homemade naan, yum!

Made this for Recipe group...Very good! I cut my chicken into cubes prior to marinating b/c I thought it would be better and less messy that way. I used fat free Greek yogurt, which worked out great. Really nice combo of flavors and was great for something different. This would be awesome tucked inside a pita w/ all the fixins'. I will def be making this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Recipe Group Selection:  03, January 2015 ~ This was just ok for us.  I marinaded the chicken overnight, which I cubed first.  I wasn't really sure how or with what to serve it with.  I sauteed some onion and after baking the chicken skewers, as directed, served it in a pita shell.  It was good, but extra sauce would have made it better.  I'm never sorry trying a new recipe, and this wasn't bad by any means.  But, additional instruction on how to serve would have been helpful.

Recipe Group.  It may have been "operator error" but I wasn't impressed.  I made it exactly as written except subbed yellow onion for red.  Now I'm on a hunt for recipes to use the garam masala I had to order from Penzys since I couldn't find it locally.
