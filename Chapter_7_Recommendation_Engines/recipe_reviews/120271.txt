This is a favorite comfort food of mine!!  My mom has made these for years.  I usually leave out the olives and onions.  My mom has a friend who will make these up ahead and freeze them to pull out later as needed.

My mother-in-law makes these to use up leftover ham after Thanksgiving and Christmas.  She too uses chopped Velveeta and it makes nice little pockets of melted cheese throughout.  We all look forward to these after the holidays at my in-laws.

These are OK. Thought the olives made them too salty. Not bad, but not a favorite.

We LOVED these! FYI... if you are using velveeta, you don't need to use two cups! We have the leftovers frozen, and can't wait to try them another time!

My ex husband's aunt makes these and they are so good.  She uses small cubes of velveeta nd it melts nicely into the sandwiches and chipped ham from the deli cut into small pieces.  I have not tried them with olives but that sounds like a great addition.
