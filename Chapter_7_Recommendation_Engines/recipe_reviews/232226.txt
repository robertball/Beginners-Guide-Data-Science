this was really really good!  I was using up some hamburger meat so I used 2# ground deer, 1# deer sausage and 1# hamburger meat.  so I doubled the recipe.  I didn't have any brandy... so I used 1/2 c white zinfandel wine.  I left out the sage b/c I didn't have any.  I DID use the buns according to directions.  I was TEMPTED to use bread crumbs,,, but didn't.  AND I am glad I didn't because it was OUTSTANDING!!!

I did not have the buns so I used stove top stuffing (turkey flavor). I had fresh ground pork and fresh ground venison. I also used Jameson instead of the Christian brothers as well. I followed the receipt as close as possible. Omitted the red pepper flakes as well. I have a 5 year old that doesn't do spicy foods.  It turned out great. My daughter didn't even know it was deer meat. LOL
