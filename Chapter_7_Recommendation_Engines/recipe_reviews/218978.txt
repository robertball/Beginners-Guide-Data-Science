Whoever submitted this recipe please review your cooking time/temp.  After following this recipe exactly I was left with two loaves of mush, although the house smelled delicious!  I ended up cooking for at least 45 minutes longer, and I kept increasing the temp.  Okay, bake @350 for 55 minutes, cover w/foil and bake an additonal 10-15 minutes.  Perfection!!!

10/30/11 - Okay, after making this recipe at least 5 times (we love the flavor!) I've perfected it to our liking with the following changes:
Bake @350 for 55 minutes
cover with foil and bake an additional 10 minutes.  Still test w/toothpick or knife but with the above changes this now turns out perfectly!

Whoa!!!  This is delicious.  I baked one large loaf pan and 6 small loaf pans.  I made a little more topping to cover all.  I had no trouble with mine getting baked.
The small ones took about 30 minutes and the large one about 48 minutes.  Check with a toothpick.  A delightful, and tasty banana/apple bread.  Thanks so much.

The bread itself is great, but as another poster said, the time and temperature are not correct.  I started out following the 325 degrees, but after 45 minutes increased it to 350 and cooked for another half hour.  Then I checked Betty Crocker and their banana bread is at 350 degrees.  So I recommend starting it at 350 degrees.

After reading the reviews for this bread, I was a little skeptical.  But, I thought I'd try it, keeping in mind the others alterations.  I substituted shortening for the butter (only because I didn't have any).  I added the dry ingredients at the same time as the bananas and apples.  Then I used 2 bread pans and 6 mini loaf pans (2 x 4 inch).  I also sprinkled a mixture of brown sugar and cinnamon on top (just a little).  I then baked in a 350 degree oven for 20 minutes (mini loaves) and 45 minutes (for regular size loaves).  These turned out moist (yet cooked through) and delicious!  My kids asked for second helpings.  Will definitely make again!

Thank you everyone for your comments, I do realize that the time and temperature are off...my oven seems to cook at a rapid/scary rate! I will change it, thank you for bringing it to my attention!

I don't typically write reviews but this was delicious.  I made it as is except that I didn't have greek yogurt so I added sour cream instead.  It took me a lot longer to bake but that's cause my oven is .  I haven't given any to my family yet, I'm not sure that I will, haha but if I do I'm sure it won't last longer than a day or two.  Thanks.  
Oh and p.s if you need to be told to mix the dry and wet ingredients together, perhaps baking is a hobby you shouldn't peruse any farther.

I haven't even finished baking it yet, and no one's eaten it yet, and I'm reasonably optimistic that they'll love it, if it ever finishes baking, but I'm pretty irritated by the flaws in the recipe as published. I used one 8" x 4" loaf pan and one larger, and still thought, "Hmm, that's a lot of batter." Half an hour later when my smoke detector went off, I opened the oven to find a mess of batter and topping on the floor of the oven. They've been in an hour now, and have at least half an hour to go. I set the temp at 350 from the beginning because 325 seemed too low for a quick bread, and I wish I'd known to either reduce the entire recipe by a third, or make 3 loaves.

I was really between three and four stars with this recipe.  The finished bread is delicious, but there are a number of flaws with the recipe. The baker is instructed to combine the wet ingredients in one bowl and the dry ingredients in another bowl, but is never told to mix the two together.  The loaf pans called for (7x3 inches) are too small.  I used 8x4 inch pans and they nearly overflowed. The baking time, as others have noted, is off and the temperature is too low. Like others, I increased both time and temperature. The foil simply stuck to the top of the loaves and tried to take the banana slices with it when removed. Even after baking for what seemed like an eternity AND passing the toothpick test, the bread was gooey on the bottom after cooling and cutting. But it tasted great.

This is such a comforting bread for cool fall days.  This was loved by family members.  Was told that the apples "makes you want to keep eating it to figure out  what's so good and different about it". 

I used a convection oven and still had to cook it much longer.  Will use 350 degrees in the future and check at 45 min, and at intervals until done.  
I also substituted 1/2 cup applesauce for half of the oil and used 1 cup of whole wheat flour (the rest was all purpose flour).  Excellent!  Will make this one again!!

Had too cook longer...about an hour and 10 minutes.  I set the oven at 340.  It was really good but if you don't want a really sweet bread, I would cut sugar back to 1 cup.

This was incredible! I did change the cook temp to 350 like the other reviews suggested, but besides that I followed the recipe. (I also used vanilla greek yogurt because I didn't have plain, but I doubt that made much of a difference) It was so moist, dense, and flavorful. I will definitely be making this again in the near future - thanks for the great recipe!!

Delicious and I will make it again but it needs a higher temperature (350°) right away to get it going. I cooked it for an hour and it still had a doughy bottom. tastes great though and we´ll see how it comes out next time.

This is actually one of my favorite recipes on here and I've made this many times. This bread is SO DELICIOUS. It doesn't last in my home because everyone else loves it too. I definitely agree, the oven temp needs to be 350 and after the first 30 minutes, I keep baking and checking at 10-15 minute intervals.  I know ovens vary, for me, baking time is 1:15-1:20 total,  but it's well worth the wait.  With these tweaks, you'll have some awesome awesome bread! Thank you!

Everyone really loved this. It was super-moist. I made it in a bundt pat instead of loaf pans, so it took a lot longer to cook. I can't speak to the accuracy of the listed time for loaf pans, though.

Love it!  Changed the time to bake but left the temp the same. Cooked uncovered for and extra 15 min and covered, an extra 20. I also substituted half of the yogurt with banana babyfood.  I also added oats to the topping. It's beautiful and yummy. :)

I haven't made this yet. I'm just thinking about it but I don't think I've ever made a quick bread that didn't bake at 350 degrees for at least 50 minutes when there are chunks of moist fruit inside the batter. It sounds delicious, I might try it. If I do, I'll practice common sense. If I do make an error in judgement, I promise I won't blame the very nice person who gave us this recipe???I

Wonderful is the only thing I can say. Sweet, fruity, crunchy from the nuts, apples, and the sprinkle on topping. Takes much longer to make at 325F than the recipe calls for. In a silicon pan it took an extra hour cook time and the aluminum pan took an extra 20 minutes. I don't know why that is, but overall, I liked the silicon results better. The aluminum baked loaf caved in big time while the silicon baked loaf stayed beautiful even after cooling. The only change I did make was to add a half cup of unsalted sunflower seeds. BTW, the cooks choice morsel of this recipe is the crispy goo that runs down the side of the pans. Great stuff! Try it.  Oh, one more thing...do not try to toast this in a standard toaster as you will have a mell of a hess. Use a toaster oven or hot frying pan. This recipe is a keeper.

This was wonderful. I did follow one reviewer's  suggestion and baked it at 350 for 55 minutes. I got 2 8 x 4 loaves and 7 muffins from it. The bread was moist and the apple chunks added a nice flavor. I will make this again!

No mention in the recipe for actually mixing the dry and wet ingredients.  7x3" loaf pans, you've got to be kidding.  Used regualr 8.5 x 5" and it still overflowed 2 of them.  It's baking as we speak so I can't attest to taste, however the batter was delicious.  Glad I read this so I know to bake longer.

Liked the recipe, but definitely recommend baking much longer. I baked for a good 10-15 min longer and still had doughy insides. Also, I'd wait till the bread set before sprinkling on toppings...the dough bubbled up and "swallowed" all the toppings on mine. Still eat, just not pretty. I will make this again with these modifications.

Had leftover apples and bananna's from thanksgiving and decided to try this. AMAZING!! My household loved it!! Next time I am going to try to add some shredded zucchini just to back in the fruits and veggies. Followed a review and baked without the foil and then at the end added it. It did have to bake a while but delish!! The topping is so yummy also!! Thanks for this recipe I will use many times I am sure.

Wow! Not only were the other reviews correct- it took 2 experienced cooks to complete this, a whole  lot of work! Am waiting for it to bake, and knowing my oven, probably 1 and1/2 hours I will see if it is worth it!!!!

If you are trying to eat healthy Don’t  bother with this one. Too much butter and sugar.  Cooking time and temp was incorrect and it yielded three 8x3 loafs Instead of two.  Much too sweet for my taste.  I was disappointed with this recipe.  No instruct for high elev.

Excellent recipe.  4 stars for poor directions of recipe.  325 degrees for the stated time increments left us turning the temp up to 350 and baking for additional time.  Wish we would have read the reviews that mentioned the same before hand.

Cook for at least 60 min! Other than that, the recipe is great! I didn't do the crumble topping to save on calories and because I didnt have brown sugar. It was still delicious!

I used 4 small bananas and 3 small apples. Started checking doneness at 50 minutes but overall, like most banana bread recipes in loaf pans, it took 70 minutes. I did not cover with foil.  Boy did the house smell good! Took 2nd loaf to neighbor while warm and she had it with ice cream.

I made this for a trip with my family.  Very delicious and moist, the topping made this bread.I used Macintosh apples. My sister-in-law who is an excellent baker herself asked for the recipe. That is a real compliment  I was excited I kept a loaf at home in the freezer to have again.

Yummy, yummy, yummy! Love this recipe. Half recipe made 1 regular loaf and 4 muffins. Baked at 350 - muffins for 30 minutes, loaf pan for 55 min (didn't use foil or adjust temperature). Turned out perfectly! Thank you for sharing! 
I love sweet, yet if you don't, the topping is very sweet and could be left off...

Turned out okay, I liked it but parts were kinda dry. I will try again. I live in higher altitude than most so that could be the reason or my oven. But taste wise Im good with it will just try some variations to make sure.

So good!  I halved the recipe and poured it into a 9x5 glass baking dish. Baked at 350 for 50 minutes then covered with foil and baked about 20 more minutes. Perfect!  I also used coconut Greek yogurt because that's what I had on hand.

This bread came out very moist and is delicious...Next time I would put less of the topping on. I thought with the amount listed, it made it too sweet...But I loved the bread....

The bread was very flavorful and moist.  However, it ended up being more like a coffee cake than a quick bread, very moist and sticky from the topping.  My wife and kids loved it, we ate both loaves within 3 days!  Would make again, but going to try to thicken it up to make it more like a bread.

Good bread but after reading the comments I made several adjustments. Used 1 1/4 c. Sugar, 2 full eggs + 1/2 c. Egg whites, 1/2 c butter +1/2 c applesauce, a little more than 1 t. bs, apple flavored yogurt for plain yogurt, banana extract instead of vanilla. Baked in my  large 10” bread pan and 9x5 in bread pan. Made 1/2 topping which was sufficient for tops of both loaves. Baked smaller loaf for 70 minutes and larger loaf for 85 minutes (probably could have used another 10 minutes) very tasty and plenty sweet enough. Per My Fitness Pal calorie count for 30 slices is 168.

I found this to be a difficult bake. I think something was off with the measurements or time because I found that this took much much longer than the indicated cooking time. My family still thought it tasted ok but I was disappointed. The topping was also very bad and the fresh fruit on top is a bad idea I do not suggest trying. Will not make again, really bad.

Delicious! I reduced the sugar in the mix from 2 cups to 1 and 1/4 cups. It was perfect. I also reduced the sugar in the topping and still had leftover after sprinkling it sparingly over my muffins and loaves. I will make it again but will most likely leave out the topping altogether.

I gave this recipe 3 stars because the loaves were tasty.  However, my loaves came out mushy after following the recipe exactly.  I  continued to bake them for an additional 30 minutes.  They browned on the outside, but were still very moist, almost oily like, on the inside.  I was a bit disappointed.

I loved it! The only thing though it didnt state in the directions how many bananas or apples. I thought it might be a typo cause it said top with banana slices and apple slices twice. I used one banana and one apple and mashed them both in a blender. I didnt top with slices but I loved the sugar mix on top.

Taking other suggestion on cooking time, I increased temperature to 350 and baked larger loaves for 55 minutes and small loaves for 35 minute. That being said, THIS IS THE BEST FRUIT BREAD I HAVE EVER MADE! Thank you so much for sharing. Followed the recipe exactly as stated and wouldn't change anything. It was moist, evenly cooked, flavorful and none of the loaves I baked to share made it out of my house.

Awesome recipe, I make a double batch and make a mix of muffins and a loaf or 2. It's a family favourite! I also bake at 350F  and leave the muffins in for 35-40min and the loaf for an hour

Delicious! However the bread took WAY LONGER than the recipe said! I lost track because I kept putting it back in 10 min intervals, but I think total cooking time at 325 for two loaves was about 90 min! I say up the temperature to 350-375 and remove the foil all together (this has not been attempted by myself yet, I'm just think it would work better and within the 45min frame that way).
Still super tasty though!

Really enjoyed this bread!  It was a neat combination of apple and banana.  I made a few minor tweaks (honey vanilla greek yogurt - didn't have plain) and added a little extra leavening.  I would definitely make it again.  Also, I did an initial bake for 10 minutes at 400 degrees, and then turned the heat down.  This recipe made one regular loaf pan and 4 smalls.

it is very moist for a banana bread.  I cooked the full recipe in a bunt pan.  I filled the bottom of the pan with half of the batter and then added the topping.  I topped it off with the remaining dough.  This put the topping in the  middle of the cake.  I did increase the heat to 375 for the first 30 minutes and then added the tin foil to the top for the last 40 minutes.  We enjoyed with coffee - mid afternoon.

Delicious as muffins too!  I baked mine at 350F for 25 min and they came out great.  It made about 24 muffins.  We also substituted wheat flour for the white flour and decreased the butter by half.  We grated the apples instead of cubing them. Very moist and yummy!

WAY too much batter for the size pans indicated. Baking temperature is far too low and time in oven is much too short. I ended up with over-flowing pans, burnt on bread on the bottom of the oven, under-cooked loaves.

I very much liked this recipe! It came out moist with a strudel-like cinnamon topping that drizzled down through to the entire loaf. I used larger loaf pans - one stoneware & one glass, along with a small little one. So, there is a lot of batter! I baked it at 350 for 23 minutes, then covered with foil for about 30 minutes - removing foil for another 5. Long ago I learned to freeze extra-ripe bananas to use when baking. Once defrosted, it brings out a great flavor. So, I used 2.5 very ripe, frozen (then defrosted) bananas, and diced up one King apple. Fabulous results! It is now in my "favorites" on Pinit!  Thank you!

Absolutely delicious! I changed a few things, to make it less moist, as many reviews have commented. So, the details here are as much for myself - for when I make it again next week - as for you all! Only a cup and a half of sugar, 2 eggs not 3, half a cup butter and half of applesauce, only 3/4 cup of the yogurt, only 1 teaspoon of vanilla, and I left out the walnuts. It made 24 muffins and one mini loaf. Left the topping out completely, same with the garnishing fruit. Only had to bake for about 32 minutes on 350, no tin foil necessary. Really awesome flavour, texture, and smelly goodness for the loving household! I will be sharing this recipe with the home ec class at my school!

This bread tastes so wonderful!  As others suggested, I did increase the oven temp to 350 and baked it for almost an hour.  I watched it closely and when the top was looking like it could possibly burn, I covered it with foil (about the last 15 minutes). It made two regular loaves of bread.   Unlike some of the other reviews,  I did not have trouble with there being too much batter for the loaf pans, as there was the perfect amount.   Also I had no problems with soggy bottoms.  By increasing the temp and cooking time, it was perfectly baked through.

This was so delicious. My only issues were that the topping ended up sinking down to the bottom of the loaf pan and my apple slices also sunk in. Next time I'll bake it for a little bit before adding the crumbled topping and slices

This was fabulous! All ovens are not the same, I followed just as it is written and each time I bake it the time is different, that is just me.  I make this in 7 mini loaf pans and use it for church as gifts for visitors.  Thank you sooooooo much.  Love it.

As an amendment to my previous review, I forgot to mention that I substituted gluten free flour for the regular flour and it worked just fine.
