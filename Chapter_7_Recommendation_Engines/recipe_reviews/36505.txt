I made this as directed and no one in my family was impressed. For one - the ingredients list "cooking sherry" but the recipe doesn't say when or where to add this ingredient. I added it to the sauce once I removed it from the heat. I think with some work - and customization this recipe might have potential, but as is - its just not very flavorful.
