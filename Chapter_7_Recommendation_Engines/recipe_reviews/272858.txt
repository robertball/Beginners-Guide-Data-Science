This was the first thing I cooked in my new Air Fryer. It's easy and the seasonings stay on the meat. It does need to cook longer then the recipe says, but it could be the size of the thighs that took longer to cook.

super easy, super delicious. I cooked my chicken with skin on, bone in. They took 25-30 @ 400 degrees.  This will be a new favorite of mine.

The flavor was great, but the chicken was dry. I am playing with time and temp to get a juicy piece of chicken. My last batch was done at 380 degrees for 14 minutes, still dry internal temp of 185.

This is a super easy quick dinner.  I used boneless skinless thighs and it worked great, very moist and evenly browned.  I cooked it 19 min at 400 and flipped after 12 min.  Perfect 165f.

Seasoning worked well, but I didn't bother measuring. Using 3 skinless thighs instead of 4 with skin, it needed less time to cook. I've tried many air fry chicken recipes and this so far has turned out the best. Just periodically check the cook since it varies with both fryer and meat selection.

Very tasty recipe and super easy. We had skinless thighs, which wasn't a problem. We also had 6 thighs instead of 4, so I turned them twice and added 5 more minutes to the end of the original 20 minutes. They were perfect.

I used bbq sauce instead of the seasonings listed in the recipe. This was the first time using the air fryer for chicken thighs. I think the basket was too close to the top and blackened the skin way before cooking the middle of the chicken. In the future I think I will bake at least half of the time first and then maybe the last 7-10 minutes switch to the air fryer option.

This recipe turned out great.  I had boneless skinless chicken thighs. So I didn't get the crispy skin. It tasted very good. Tender and juicy. My family enjoyed it too.  I will make it again.

Yummy!  I added olive oil and crushed garlic.  I cooked 2 at a time for 9 minutes, then turn them over.  I cooked extra to make chicken salad.  Moist and delicious- a definite keeper.

Great recipe!  Fast and easy.  The chicken was a tad overcooked at 18 minute, maybe due to my use of skinless, maybe because I only buy skinless thighs  - I'll play around with the time.  However, even at 175 internal temp, the chicken was moist and tender.  The spices are pretty close to perfect, it would be a challenge to find any better.

Great base for cooking the chicken. Just a note, only the small pieces cooked in 18 min. The large ones I had to pierce the bottom of and cook 3-5 more minutes. Though the temp read 165 degrees, they were still pink and bloody.

I made this dish in my air fryer and it turned out great! I marinated the chicken (chicken thighs, bone in and with skin) for about 24 hours, put it in the air fryer (my first time using one) and it came out great. No fuss and no mess. I'll definitely make this again. Delicious!
