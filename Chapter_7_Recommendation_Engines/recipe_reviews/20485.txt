I used homemade vanilla ice cream to make this. I liked it more than Husband. Thanks!

So I've made punches like this in the past for parties, only I've usually used lemon-lime soda and lime sherbert. This was just as DELICIOUS! Because I don't have a party planned for tonight, though, I "downsized" the recipe to be drinks for my son and me, and added everything to our glasses...made some lovely ice cream sodas!!!
