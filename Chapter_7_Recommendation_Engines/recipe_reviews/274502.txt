7.22.19  The only adjustment I made was cutting the red pepper flakes amount in half (personal taste), otherwise, followed the recipe.  I marinated the chicken for about 4 hours, and since it was skinless there was no  “…skin golden and lightly charred,” but the 5 minutes per side was spot on (checked with a meat thermometer), the thighs did brown up nicely with good eye appeal.  Really enjoyed the tang of the fresh lime juice.  Nice and easy recipe, would make again.

I marinated chicken thighs for about an hour. Then I cooked this in a stir fry with a tablespoon of peanut butter added in the wok. It was very good!  Very citrus-y with a hint of spice.

I marinated it for about 3 hours and it was the perfect amount of time for us.  It made for a delicious citrus addition to the chicken without overpowering it.

When I don't have a lime on hand, I substitute a lemon, and with this dish - lemon or lime - it in my opinion is freakin fantastic! My father complained about the spice - a little too spicy, so while it was perfect for me, next time I'd be sure to have the lime on hand and I'd reduce the red pepper usage to about half to tone it down for him, but should I be making this for myself, lemon or lime, it's really quite awesome. 

Of note: I didn't use this as a marinade, I cooked two thinly cut chicken breasts in a narrow bread pan, after sliding them through this mixture and then pouring the mixture on top... At 400 degrees for 20 minutes, I then flipped each piece midway through, then for five more minutes I set the oven to broil to get a good nice sear on top. 

Then, I took the chicken out, served it on a plate,taking a spoon and pouring the juice over each piece, topping with cilantro. 

Perfecto, in my opinion. I'll do the marinade with lime next time, but the cooking in the oven method worked out fantastic. 

THANK YOU FOR A GREAT RECIPE BASE TO WORK FROM!

I made this as chicken for tacos with a cilantro lime rice. I would definitely make it again.
