Ughhhh. I made this pizza with my own homemade crust for a few friends. This sausage is so greasy we had to use a napkin to sop some of it off the pizza. I wish I had looked further down the page for the "nutrition" Information. One serving is most of your day's fat and sodium. I will never use this sausage again.

Simple and delicious! This was perfect for a Friday night meal. I used store bought pizza dough and opted out of the green peppers (husband isn't a big fan of it on pizza). I removed the sausage from its casing, crumbled it and pan fried it removing a lot of the grease. Overall, very tasty!

Made this last night and it disappeared in no time. Omitted the green peppers (no one here eats them) and used homemade crust. We had some Johnsonville Hot Italian Sausage on hand so I made it with that - the cheese and sauce cooled the meat down some and it was perfect. Will make again!

Sausage pizza has always been a favorite of mine. We loved the combo sausage pizzas I made. I precooked the sausage in a fry pan so that I could drain the grease.  I used the Johnsonville all natural mild and hot Italian sausage to make combination pizzas. I used a 1/2 pound of sausage for each pizza. The combo pizzas I made may not be simple, but we love lots of toppings. I loaded up on toppings which included black olives, green pepper, onion, green chili, mushrooms, sausage, and pepperoni. I topped the pizza with shredded provolone cheese and mozzarella cheese. The day before, I made homemade crust, home made sauce and cut up all the veggies. The prepping the day before did make it easier to make the pizzas the next day.

So easy and delicious!  I had no issues with the sausage not cooking (this is how most pizza places do it!) and used sliced tricolor peppers since my crew doesn't care for green.  This recipe is versatile also, you can add anything to it.  Pineapple, parsley, or green onions would be great on it.  Thanks for an easy recipe and wonderful product, Johnsonville!

Another superb pizza by Johnsonville!  I used homemade pizza dough for the crust, used Johnsonville's hot Italian links, added minced garlic to the sausage (which I cooked before adding to the dough...made it less greasy!) and, as always, brushed the outside of the crust with extra virgin olive oil mixed with dried herbs (basil, oregano, parsley, & onion powder).  I would also like to pass on a little tip on removing sausage casings: cut 3/4 of the way down lengthwise into the link and pull the casing off.   Soooo good!

Mr. LTH deemed this the "best pizza ever".  That may not sound like high praise, but I make homemade pizza more than 50 times a year, with a lot of variations.  I made this w/homemade crust (Jay's Signature Pizza Crust from this site), homemade sauce (Exquisite Pizza Sauce from this site), and Kraft (R) Pizza Cheese, shredded cheddar, and fresh mozzarella.  I pre cooked my ground sausage to avoid greasiness and I still found the crust to be a bit limp as a result.  I baked at 550 for 6 minutes on bottom rack and another 6 on the top.  I'm decidedly NOT a sausage enthusiast and I enjoyed this, too, though not as much as Mr. LTH.  THANKS for the recipe!

I browned the sausage first and glad I did because I had a chance to let it drain...I think the pizza would have been way too greasy otherwise...it had a great flavor!

I actually cooked my sausage beforehand (I used ground Italian sausage) due to other reviewers' concerns about greasiness - this worked great!  I used a homemade, whole-wheat crust and added a whole bunch of other toppings (eggplant, mushrooms, onions, and the sausage) because I figure that's the fun of making pizza at home!  The ground sausage cooks up quickly in the skillet and you can drain the grease off of that, making it perfect for topping your pizza.  Yum!

This is a good basic recipe, but putting raw sausage on pizza is never ok. It might not cook thoroughly and it will produce a very greasy pizza. We added pepperoni, diced black olives, and banana peppers and really enjoyed it.

Easy, tasty and fast!  I loved the Johnsonville mild Italian sausage.  I fried mine first to remove some grease.  I like sausage with that crispiness on the outside anyways. I kept eating the sausage as I removed from pan because it was so good!  I will definitely make again! I'm giving the recipe 4 stars but I give the sausage 5 stars!

I used a home made crust and sauce and this was so good.  I don't think I've ever made a better pizza.  I used Johnsonville mild Italian sausage and it gave the pizza just the kick it needed.  Delicious!

I made this for my husband and once again, the sausage was a stand out. We don't like green peppers in this house, so normally I add yellow for him and red onion. I wanted to try and stay as true to this recipe as possible so I just made it with the sausage. On its own, it was lonely. Next time, I will make sure to have his red onion and yellow pepper and I think this would be outstanding!

Great for a quick meal.  I sauteed the sausage along with onion, garlic and orange & red bell peppers.  Also used some shredded cheddar cheese.

We loved this pizza! Very quick to throw together for a Friday night! I love that the sausage cooked in the oven instead of precooking on the stove before adding to the pizza. This is a great flavorful, quick recipe that uses ingredients I normally have on hand!

I used a homemade pizza crust and cooked the sausage with some diced onion, pepper, and fresh mushrooms in a skillet for about 15 minutes (then drained) before adding to the pizza crust. Topped with a blend of mozzarella and cheddar. Delicious! Johnsonville Sausage is flavorful and has a great texture that both my boys definitely enjoyed.
