Light, fluffy and very good.  I used butter instead of shortening and added 1 tsp. of vanilla to the batter.  For the filling, I used brown sugar instead of white and took a knife and swirled it through the batter before baking.  Very moist, I might add nuts to the filling next time for some crunch.....

I made this yesterday and only have 2 pieces left.  I doubled the recipe and put it in a 9 x 13 pan.  I added margarine instead of the shortening.  I did not put in half of the batter first I spay coated the pan and put all of the batter in.  Then I generously shook the cinnamon and sugar mixture over the top.  I also took a knife and made swirly movements till it was all the way through  the batter then I shook more cinnamon sugar on top.  This was liked by all the boys as well as Hubby and I.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks Terri for the good recipe.

I made this last night and it was meant to be a breakfast cake for hubby in the morning.  Well, our home smelled so good while it was baking that we decided to eat some for dessert.  It was still warm and light with a light flavor and crusty top.  Delicious!  This morning I found a note from hubby that it was wonderful in his milk for breakfast, too!  I took someone else's advice and folded in the dry ingredients and sour cream instead of beating them in to avoid a tough batter.  I used brown sugar for the filling/topping and also flecks of butter.  The cake rose very well, and was very moist.  I refrigerated it overnight and this morning it seemed heavier and denser.  It was sweet but not overly so which is exactly what I like. Great recipe, Terri!  It's going to be a regular at my house.

The basic recipe is fantastic. It does need more topping though. I have make this a couple time adding canned peaches, frozen blueberries, or jam and it works out perfectly. I've also used yogurt instead of the sour cream and it works just as well or better.

Wow! Takes some time to mix but well worth the effort. 

I used brown sugar for the center/top and upped the amount to 1/3 cup. Used 1/2 for the middle layer and added toasted chopped pecans to the top along with about 1/4 stick of cold butter cut sliced and cut into quarters over the entire thing. When the butter melted and folded back into the cake there  formed a very nice roll of the sugar, cinnamon down into the cake surface.

This was a MUCH prettier and tasty presentation.  

Thanks Terri for a classic coffee cake!

This was very easy to make and very tasty, however I think that brown sugar would be better for the cinnamon sugar mix that is put on top and in between the layers.  I would also add a few toasted nuts to the topping to make it extra yummy.  Overall, a winner!

This coffee cake was moist, mildly sweet, and had a beautiful crumb texture.  I've already made this several times and have made it a "regular" on the weekend breakfast menu.  I sometimes put in some fruit in the middle layer, with a little cinnamon and brown sugar, then put the remaining cinnamon mixture on top with some pecans.

This was a tasty recipe, but more of the cinnamon-sugar mix in multiple layers as well as laid in a 13x9 pan and this would be perfect!!

What can I say except Wow and double wow.  I am a bakers daughter and found this cake to be  moist, easy to make...but it was harder to keep any for myself and my morning cup of coffee. I did manage to take a photo to post here.

This coffee cake rose beautifully and has perfect texture but is a little on the bland side.  I made the recipe exactly as written even though the other reviewers said it needed a little something.  I will make again but will add some vanilla and brown sugar to spice it up a little.  Thanks for submitting!

This is a very good basic recipe for coffee cake! The batter was much more muffin-like than I anticipated and needed to be pushed to the sides of the pan, which was harder to do for the second layer without messing up the first. Be careful not to over-mix! I made a "perhaps slightly more healthful" version and made it with white whole wheat flour, smart balance (instead of shortening), and fat-free sour cream. I also added 1 tsp of vanilla as others had suggested. Definitely adaptable to add things like currents, raisins, walnuts, pecans, etc as you like.

I am always trying to find a streusal coffee cake that compares to those Hostess cakes. This was close. I had to subtract a star because the batter did need a little something. I added 2tsp vanilla and a little cinamon and nutmeg. I also found the batter thick, so it was a little hard to spread. I made this cake with butter, I dont keep shortening in my house. I made a streusal topping (butter, brown sugar, sugar & grahman cracker)and put that in the middle and on top. I always reserve streusel and when the cake comes out of the oven I melt it with a little milk or vanilla almond breeze and 1 tsp honey. I lightly drizzle the melted goodness on the cake slice and on the serving plate. Tonight it was just me & the hubby eating the cake....I even drizzled it on our paper plates, lol....sooo yum!!!!

Wow, this is the lightest and fluffiest (is that even a word? I don't really care :b) cake I have ever made. I made a couple of modifications, I used 2 tsp baking powder instead of baking soda, 1 cup evaporated milk + 1 2/3 table spoons vinegar in place of sour cream. Having read things about it being tough, I beat the margarine/sugar (which I cut down cause I don't like sweet things much) more, added the eggs together and whipped it in hope for it to be lighter. Than I folded into the flour/sour cream alternatively and baked it round 37 minutes at the temperature stated. Yum! Next time though, I will prob not put the sugar on top, kinda hard when the only way for me to remove the cake is to flip it, may totally cut the sugar out next time for it to be "healthier"

We enjoyed this, nice with a glass of milk or a cup of coffee. I did add a tsp of vanilla to the batter and double the topping/filling as sugggested-even so the cake was a bit bland. Not sure if I would make again.

Definitely a coffee "cake" rather than a coffee "bread".  This easy-to-make recipe yields a wonderfully tender pastry that is a bit lacking in flavor.  I will definitely make it again but add some fruit (blueberries) or nuts (toasted almonds + almond extract) to enhance the flavor.  This recipe could also be used in a shortcake-type role with fresh fruit and a dollop of cream.

This was great!  It raised well and had a tender crumb.  I substituted brown sugar for the topping and must confess.....doubled the topping!  Thank you Terri, for posting a tasty and economical recipe!

Great coffeecake recipe! I used butter instead of shortening and added cooked apples to the batter and the top before baking in a 13X9 pan.  It was perfection - very moist and not too sweet. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I thought this was great.  I added 1/2t vanilla and 1/4t cinnamon to the batter; also added chopped walnuts to the sugar/cinnamon mixture.  I topped it all with Alton Brown's doughtnut glaze.  I thought this cake was wonderful.  The cake was moist, plenty sweet... delicious!  THX for the recipe.

I found this recipe a bit eggy tasting and dry without enough sugar/cinnamon in the middle.  I substituted butter for shortening and used a square glass pan (add 10 minutes to bake time,) so that may have affected the recipe.  If I tried it again, I would double the cinnamon/sugar that goes in the middle of the recipe.  This cake fortunately was better the second and third day, after refrigeration.

I made this with a few modifications (only because of what I did/didn't have on hand).  I used 1/4 c. shortening and 1/4 c. margarine instead of all shortening; I used dark brown sugar instead of light brown sugar for the filling; and I added some pecan pieces to the brown sugar mixture. This was really quite yummy-licious.  So yummy-licious in fact, that I ate the entire thing myself, piece by piece by piece, within 24 hours!

Really good despite my mistake. I put all the topping in the middle by accident. I did add a little almond extract and will probably add some vanilla next time as it was a wee bit bland. But overall easy and delicious.

This recipe was impressive. After reading other reviews, I armed myself with a plan. Need I say it..YES I deviated from the recipe a bit.. I added vanilla extract and also i used dark brown sugar instead of white for the filling & topping. It came out marvelously. Don't drink coffee but it's great with tea. My family liked as well, very fluffy & moist.
