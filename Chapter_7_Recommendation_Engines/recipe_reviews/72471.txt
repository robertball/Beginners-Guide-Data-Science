This is the same recipe that my mom and I use for special occasions.  
We use grated cheddar cheese and for the seasonings that somone missed in the previous review, we mix an envelope of Hidden Valley Ranch dressing mix with 1 Cup Mayonaisse and 1 Cup Sour Cream.  It makes all the difference in flavor.  This is really a great salad!

This salad is great, EXCEPT, there is no seasoning whatsoever. If it had salt and pepper, lemon pepper, seasoned salt or something it would REALLY be outstanding. It was good but rather blah. Seemed like something small but important was missing.

I made this for a graduation party and it was a BIG hit... I did make a layer of hard boiled eggs instead of just a few on the top. I did not use use the onion just b/c I am not a fan. Great salad and so easy to make.

This salad was yummy.  Made two containers from one recipe so that one could stay in the cooler at the cookout.  Didn't stay there long, everyone loved it.

I layered vegetables that I had in the refrigerator and used iceberg lettuce with romaine lettuce. I did not use Parmesan cheese but cheddar. I put in ranch dressing mix with the mayo and sour cream on top. This recipe is great to use with what you have on hand and mix it up. I made it in the morning and served a early dinner. I was great the next 2 days without being soggy.

This was way better than I expected!  I added salt and pepper and a tsp of lemon juice to the mayo before spreading it on.  I think this helped to make the sauce a little thinner, which I liked better.

This had very good flavors- I did add salt and pepper, but otherwise followed the recipe. My only recommendation would be to put it in a low shallow dish so that the dressing spreads out across the salad- I put mine in a taller bowl thinking it would be prettier but was left with plain lettuce at the bottom that went to waste. Thanks for sharing!

This is very pretty (and easy and economical) individually plated on clear glass plates for a bridal or baby shower.   For a more manly version....my husband enjoys taking the salad and rolling in a tortilla for a wrap type sandwich !

Love these types of salads, especially for a party. Used turkey bacon, red onion, cukes, tomatoes, shredded carrots, shredded purple cabbage, peas, green peppers, used Splenda sugar substitute instead of regular sugar (2 packets as used for coffee), 1/2 c low fat mayo, and one (6oz) container of fat free plain yogurt, and a splash of cidar vinegar for the dressing. Also topped with reduced fat pepper jack cheese. So good and the leftovers are even better. Great party or pot luck salad made the night before. Excellent!

Loved this salad!  Like others recommended, I did use 1 cup mayo, 1 cup sour cream and a packet of Hidden Valley Ranch Dressing mix for the "dressing."  So, so good!!  (I was concerned that it would be too much dressing, but it wasn't at all.)  I also added a little salt and pepper to the dressing.  I substituted chick peas for the water chestnuts - just personal preference.  I used 4 eggs, sliced with an egg slicer and spread all over the top, and cut up 5 Campari tomatoes.  They're in between the size of a grape tomato and a regular tomato, so the slices are perfect bite size.  And I did use shredded cheddar as it was what I had on hand.  Oh, and finally, just a tip if it helps....because it isn't very easy to spread a thick dressing on top of the salad ingredients, I put the dressing into a gallon zip lock, cut off the tip, and "piped" it all over the salad.  Then, just moved it around a bit with a spoon to fill in all the gaps.  Worked great!  Thanks for a great recipe!!

Very pretty salad! The family loved it, in fact my 13y.o. decided she would skip the rest of the meal in favor of this salad! It does need salt and pepper and I was generous in adding these to the mayonnaise dressing. I see this making many appearances at summer barbecues!

Made for Thanksgiving dinner, and it was delicious.  I subbed cauliflower for the water chestnuts as some of the family aren't crazy about them.  I also used cherry tomatoes, halved, in place of the wedges and added them to the salad before adding the dressing.  This salad was very well received by everyone.  Thanks Peach822 for sharing your version of the salad.

This is so much better than the standard 7 layer salad.  The eggs and tomatoes added a lot to the flavor.  Had for card club and both the men and women commented  on how good it was.

My mom used to make this when I was a child and still makes it. Now as a mother I make it as well. The only thing I do differently is I add more egg. I just personally like it with more.  :)

I made this one for Thanksgiving.  It was good, but not everyone was impressed.  My Aunt used to make one similar to this ages ago, I was hoping for that same flavor.  Unfortunately, it was not what I was dreaming of.  I'm still on the look out for that recipe!

I followed the recipe  except I took the advice from other reviewers of adding a package of ranch dressing mix to mayo and used grated cheddar cheese. I  also used 4 hard-boiled eggs and left out water chestnuts, because no one but me likes them.  I  ground salt & pepper on top too. Delish!!

I made this for the first time at a dinner party and it just vanished!  I used Romaine instead of iceberg, and threw in mozzarella cheese and green onions on top, and next time I will add mushroom slices.
