I have been making "Rice and Peas" as us Jamaican's call it, for quite a while and this is really lacking.  To start, you should soak your red kidney beans in cold water overnight. When you're ready to cook the peas, you would boil with it 1-2 cloves of garlic. Since the peas are presoaked, it should take approximately 45 mins to 1 hour to cook. After the peas is cook, you can add approximately 1/2-1 can of cocunut milk, 1 sprig of escallion, about 1 teaspoon of sugar, 1 sprig of thyme, black pepper and seasoning salt (all purpose seasoning) to taste (about 1 teaspoon of each), 1 table spoon butter, 1 whole scotch bonnet pepper (for flavouring). You can add onion if you like, but it should be finely chopped. Allow that to boil for 2-3 minutes. Then you wash your rice, and add it to the mixture. Once the rice is brought to a boil, reduce your fire and allow it to simmer.  This should give you a much better version of the Jamaican Rice and Peas. I make it every sunday, and each time I make it for guests they absolutely love it.

Ok, i'm a pretty good chef and was hesitant about this, I was pretty sure that it wouldnt be near enough liquid and boy was I right. To get this recipe right you will need 2.5C of coconut milk, 2C of brown rice, the onion and seasoning levels are fine, you need to use canned or precooked kidney beans, and finally to make it not bland as so many have complained, you need to add about 3tsp of white sugar. Anyone who has ever had raw coconut compared to the refined stuff will know why... I'll try to get my brother's version of this recipe (as made in Belize) much better and post it!

I changed this recipe up a whole lot- but in the end it turned out delicious.  I made the brown rice seperately.  In another pan I sauted 3 cloves of garlic, then added a red pepper, and the green onions and let them cook for about 5 minutes.  I poured in a can of lite coconut milk, some red pepper flakes, dried tyme, and some curry powder.  Then I added a can of kidney beans and the rice.  I let it all cook for a few minutes and then salt and peppered to taste.  It was very good and I will definitely make it again.

I really liked this recipe. I added a few more spices, though and used both canned prepared beans and frozen previously cooked beans instead of waiting for the beans to cook. I put them in a slow cooker with the coconut milk for about an hour, then transferred everything to my rice cooker. That increased the easyness factor alot.

Here's a fail proof version: 2c uncooked rice,1 can kidney beans, 2 garlic cloves minced, 3 sliced green onions,1 tsp thyme,1 can coconut milk, 2 cups water, and a whole scotch bonnet. Bring it all to a boil for about 20 min., remove the whole pepper. Season with additional salt and pepper to taste. You could add some curry powder if you like it as well.

1 cup of coconut milk is not enough liquid to cook 1 1/4 cups beans AND 2 1/4 cups rice! I sure hope somebody submits a better recipe because this one doesn't work as written!

Oh dear...the person who posted this assumed that persons attempting the recipe would have had some experience with this sort of thing. Usually, the peas are cooked seperately in enough water to cover and the coconut milk is added with the rice. And chilli pepper! No self respecting Jamaican uses chilli pepper :) Just toss 1 whole scotch bonnet peppr (if you can find it) in to flavour the meal.

Ok, so I had to revise the receipe somewhat. 
I really used 40 oz. coconut milk, (3 13.5 cans minus a little). 
I started with the original 1 cup and kept addeding to keep beans drowned until I added rice (which I then considered the rice rule 1 cup rice=2 cups water) 
I used 1/2 the beans that the receipe asked for, I used only 1 cup brown rice and isteand of sticking to the 25 minutes I just kept checking and making sure rice didn't burn on the bottom and kept fire burning into the majority of the liquid was gone. Taste Great!!! Good Luck!

I hope nobody tries this recipe with only 1 cup of coconut milk as the total liquid. You're probably supposed to cook the beans and rice separately, then add the other ingredients.

The recipe sounds great but there must be an error.  The only liquid in the recipe is one cup of coconut milk and this isn't enough to cook the beans and the rice.  I hope they make the necessary corrections because the recipe sounds like it has potential.

After spending all day locating a can of coconut milk, I followed the recipe to the T.  About halfway through the 2 hours, I started scrambling for more liquid.  I added a can of evaporated milk, since I had no more coconut milk, then I ran out of that and just added milk.  Bottom line is that the pan was horribly scorched and I threw the whole thing out.  I was very disappointed.  I'll never try it again.

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars and only b/c the adjustments I made produced a really yummy dish. I didn't even attempt to use the original recipe after reading the comments. I turned this into a one-pot meal and it was quick, easy, and fabulous! 

Here's my recipe:
2 cups water
1 cup uncooked brown rice
1 cup coconut milk (or go ahead and use a whole can which = 2 cups)
1 can red beans (or kidney beans)
3 cloves garlic, chopped
1/4 C. green onion
2 Tbsp. sugar 
1 tsp. dried thyme
1 tsp. curry powder

Put all ingredients in a pot, bring to a boil, and cook until rice is tender (and liquid has reduced)--about 20-30 mins. Voila!

I omitted the chile pepper b/c I wasn't sure if it would be too spicy for my kids, but I may try a small amount next time (or add a small can of green chiles). Tasted delicious!

I first tasted a variation of this recipe in Costa Rica on the east coast. Very similar. This recipe and the other I tasted in Costa Rica is one of the most satisfying foods I have ever eaten. Whats better, eaten once or twice a week I never get tired of it. Try it, you will love it. If you have a pressure cooker you can have the beans done in only 40 minutes to a nice soft consistency.

I kept the coconut with the coconut milk, and cooked both in with the beans and additional water.  I cut the rice down to 1 cup, cooking it in 2 cups of water.   I served the beans on top of the rice.  This has great flavor!

Turned out very dry. I needed to double the coconut milk. I used canned kidney beans instead of the dry. Still needed to add some water so the brown rice could cook properly.

I have to say that I followed debP's review.  I, too, cooked the rice beforehand, but while cooking it, I also sauteed pork, green onions and 3 cloves of garlic.  When the pork dish and rice were done, I transferred the pork/green onion mixture into a big pot and added the whole can of coconut milk.  Then I added generous dashes of dried thyme, salt and pepper as well as crushed red pepper flakes. Added the brown rice as well as 1/2 cup of black eyed peas that I pre cooked a couple hours before. There was no "drying out" of the rice, was liberal w/the water that I cooked the brown rice, after reading all the scarey previous reviews!  In the end, I prepared the dish nothing like the actual recipe, but it turned out fantastic.  There were hardly any leftovers!  This is a good "idea" of a recipe, but there is some major tweaking that has to be done in order for it to turn out with a consistency that is edible!  Good luck!

The liquid proportions for this recipe are wrong.  I used 3 cans of coconut milk.  I dumped everything into my rice cooker and set it to the brown rice setting.  Once cooked, it was really lacking in flavor so I added all the seasonings in again.  This dish has subtle flavor and was a good counterpart to the Jerky Chicken recipe on this site.

There is no way you can cook raw, unsoaked beans for only two hours and them be cooked. This has to be for already prepared beans and rice. A fixer upper I guess..

I pre cooked the Beans and then simmered an entire can of coconut oil with the other ingredients plus 2 cups water.  
Decent flavour and crazy spicy thanks to the habanero pepper I used.  
Pretty easy to make.  Might make it again... might not.

Our family really enjoyed this dish.  

I did add twice the amount of coconut milk to the beans, and ened up adding about 2 cups of chicken broth (since I had no more coconut milk on hand). I added the garlic to the pot after the first hours to enhance the flavor.  I ended up making the rice seperately as well, and used tobasco sauce and chili powder because we didn't have chile peppers.

Next time I would probably pre-soak the beans, and use only cocont milk (3, 14-oz cans per cup of beans) , but they turned out well just the same.

Yes, if you've ever ate authentic jamaican beans and rice, then you know that it is a pretty dry dish. sooooo good though and also good with tofu in curry sauce right on top with a salad on the side.

I found out the missing instruction behind this recipe and still cheated.  Soak beans overnight.  It's on the package instructions for the kidney beans.  Also, I did add more water as it cooked.  I could not let it burn.  The flavor is OK with the fresh thyme, but I think I'll stick to my own way by cooking the beans and rice separately.

This recipe was delicious, although i did have to use more milk. I did precook the rice, and was glad that I did! One cup of milk would not be sufficient for 2 1/4c uncooked rice to absorb. The flavor was outstanding!!!! Love the creamy taste of the coconut milk paired with the spicyness of the chili pepper.

I used a variety of beans in the slow cooker with coconut milk. I cooked the rice seperately too. Basically took the idea and changed it. Turned out good though!

I will not be making this one again.  I used 3 cans of coconut milk (almost 6 cups), 2 cups of rice and 2 cans of beans.  The only way we could stomach it was to mix it with our creamed spinach.  I had to drown it with hot sauce.  I am sure there is a better recipe out there.

A little bland, but my husband loves it.   I added red pepper and a chopped jalepeno to spice it up a little.  It really added to the dish.

Very bland, even after adding cinnamon and nutmeg to the recipe

Well, my bad for not reading the reviews before attempting this dish.  Normally I do read the reviews so I can get a feel for what needs to be tweaked, but I was in a hurry... I realized after the first 20 minutes that this recipe had some elements missing- 1 cup of coconut milk and dry beans?  Oh boy.  I spent 3 hours trying to fix and redo many elements, but in the end I threw away a giant pot of hard beans and undercooked rice.  There are some other reviews on here that actually have a decent recipe in them, so if you want to make this dish- read them.

This recipe was a disaster. Liquid measurements were all wrong. Beans should be soaked or use canned. Will not be making this ever again.

Really great!  I added about a 1/2 tsp. of curry powder and added about 1 1/2c. of water.  If you have a rice cooker, try it in that, mine turned out really good and only a little spicy.  I used canned kidney beans and  I threw out the whole habinero at the end of cooking.  My daughter took the left overs to school the next day!

I used 1 can of drained and rinsed kidney beans (next time I will use 2 cans) and 1 can of coconut milk.  Simmered together.  Cooked rice separately with added spices and garlic then combined.  Had the taste I was looking for.  Will definitely make again but cut ingredients in half as this made a huge pot for the 2 of us.
