Hmm... I sure had to make a lot of changes to this recipe. But, I think it's a decent base. I eliminated the green pepper and mushrooms. I used pickled jalapeno pepper slices instead of a chopped fresh one. I added 2 cups of shredded cheddar and a 3.8 oz. can of sliced black olives. And, I served it with sides of salsa and sour cream. The cheesy beef mixture is really good and is what makes this recipe unique.

Delicious and easy to make!  I added 1 can vegetarian refried beans and a can of sweet corn (drained) and allowed guest to serve themselves.  We placed the meat in a bol,sprinkled cheese over it and stacked chips along our bowls for easy scooping.

A coworker brought these in to work, and he had used freh mushrooms and grated Cheddar cheese. Really nice, fresh taste, seasoned just right.

This recipe is tasteful and yummy. It went so quickly I'll have to double it next time. The only change I made was using Turkey meat instead of red. It is a must try.

This was excellent. We had to buy another bag of nachos. Add jalapeno peppers for extra spice
