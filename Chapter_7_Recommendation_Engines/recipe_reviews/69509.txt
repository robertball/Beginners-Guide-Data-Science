The only one who got fed tonight was my garbage disposal.  This was so nasty.  The picante was was the worst combination with it, also perhaps queso blanco and some cream cheese.  I'm going to toy around and see if I can offer up a better alternative.

Ok, I LOVE fundido, but I am not a fan of this recipe. Don't like the picante, olives or cheese choice.
Here's what I suggest for a restaurant quality dish:
Cook chorizo over med heat until most of the grease has cooked off (about 10-15 minutes). Drain and return to pan, increasing heat to med high. Cook until about 1/2 the meat is charred  (about 5 minutes). Shred 8 oz Chihuahua cheese with jalapeno, 4 oz reg Chihuahua cheese, and 2 oz Cojita cheese in Cuisinart - blend together. Spray 8x8 baking dish with cooking spray. Layer 1/2 of cheese,  then charred chirizo, then top with remaining 1/2 of cheese blend.
Cook at 325 for 15 minutes, until cheese is mostly melted. Stir around and broil for an additional 5 minutes, until top is bubbly. 
Serve with warmed tortillas, tortilla chips or as a savory topping to chicken. 
DELICIOUS

I don't know that I would consider this queso fundido, which I've always thought of as more of a fondue type dip, but it's very good.  I made it for our first Sunday football watching party and it was a big hit.  I seasoned the ground beef with a little garlic salt while it cooked, and used chicken chorizo from Trader Joe's (less fat and all of the flavor).  This turned out like a layered dip.  I think I'll add more cheese next time and mix everything up.  Really though, a great alternative to bringing a seven layer bean dip.

I made this for my boyfriend (I dont eat meat). He feels it was good, but next time I do make it I will add PLENTY more cheese. Also, I made the dish half picante sauce and the other I left without (he ate the side without). Unless you really like your fundido spicy omit the sauce.

Like other reviewers, I was expecting more of a restaurant-style queso fundido.  This was a meat dip, which in that sense in not bad, just not what I expected from the name.  We ended up adding 1 lb. velveeta to give it something other than meat.
