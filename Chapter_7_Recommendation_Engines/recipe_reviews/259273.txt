Made this for myself when recovering from the flu.  I liked it quite a bit.  I had to use condensed tomato soup, which I added water to instead of ready to serve soup... too contagious to go to grocery store.  Would be good with meat added too

Such an awesome tasting soup! First minestrone soup I’ve ever made and I’m normally making soups alone but I convinced my husband we can do this for supper! We had 5 hours before supper LOL .

I made it but did not add the pasta feeling that it was too much carbs. I am a diabetic and didn't want all the starch. But it was delicious on its own.
