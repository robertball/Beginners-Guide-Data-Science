I am trying this recipe today and I thought I'd share since I read someone saying it was a bit bitter. That is from the eggplant. If you first chop and soak eggplant in salt water for about 30 minutes, it takes that bitterness out of the eggplant and makes dishes with eggplant super enjoyable. Hope this helps!

Boy was I glad to find this recipe!  It was delicious, easy, low calorie and authentic. My family likes things a little spicy, so I made a the following additions:  an extra pinch of both red and black pepper, 1 Tbsp of fresh garlic, double the amount of Italian seasoning, and a sprig of each of fresh herbs- parsley, marjoram, basil and oregano.

I think the original recipe would be good  as well, 
maybe a bit bland for us.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  It is our new favorite!

Did the original recipe and some additions. Added organic cauliflower, green cabbage, real organic tomatoes instead of canned and pressed garlic instead of powder. Excellent. Will make amaranth as a side with this.

I also made this in the crock pot. I used a little more zucchini and eggplant than called for, turned out great. It's really better the next day or two. I toasted some thin slices of ciabatta on the grill ,put this on top along with chopped pepperoni and mozzarella cheese. Put under broiler for a minute or two. Excellent! Hubs wants it again this week! I'll serve it with a big Italian salad. Can't wait! Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious, healthy, and satisfying all in one meal!  I used the crockpot method and made the dish twice...both times i got rave reviews from my family.  I did not have yellow squash to add but it didn't matter, it was wonderful.  I like to serve it in a bowl with a 1/4 cup light ricotta on top...mmm will be making this many times for sure!  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good. A little runny. Next time I might try draining the tomatoes a little.

At first I thought I added too many veggies because the pot was near full. Once it started to cook down the amount of veggies was right on the money! Recipe was delicious and my house smells amazing!

I love ratatouille and had to try out this recipe. With a few minor adjustments, it came out beautifully! I wanted equal amounts of zucchini, squash and eggplant, so that wound up being 3 zukes, 2 squash and 1 eggplant. I used 2 cans of fire-roasted tomatoes and 3 cloves of minced garlic. I also added about a teaspoon or so of sugar to cut the acidity of the tomatoes and the potential bitterness of the eggplant (hey, I'm Southern; we add sugar to everything, lol). I added about 1/2 tsp of cayenne, and most importantly, instead of Italian Seasoning, I used about a tablespoon of Herbes de Provence (this is a French Provencal dish, not Italian). It was everything I wanted. And I have leftovers to put in the freezer!

I have never had ratatouille in my 20 years of life until recently and since then I've been dying to try and make it myself. I love how simple this recipe is, just veggies and seasoning. I used fresh diced tomatoes, and red and yellow peppers instead of zucchini as well as some cabbage and cremini mushrooms. Even my squash hating, meat and potatoes of a guy father liked it! The giant kettle was nearly gone within a few hours! Definitely a good recipe to have in your back pocket!

I made this with a few slight modifications, which are the following:
1.) fresh picked, vine-ripe tomatoes from the garden instead of canned
2.) no italian seasoning
3.) one large clove on minced garlic instead of garlic powder.
4.) A little extra salt and pepper

It was fantastic.  Thank you for posting this recipe!  

Also, another person (Britty) posted a note to soak the eggplant in salt water for about 30 minutes before starting. I did that in a large pan (the pan I was using to make this), about half full, with a tablespoon of salt dissolved into it, and it got rid of the bitterness, so thank you Britty for that.

Great recipe and great tip!

We loved this ratatouille.  We made it in the slow cooker, substituted 1 tbsp minced garlic for the garlic powder, added an extra tsp of oregano, and added a 1/2 tsp of chili powder.  We used a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes instead of diced (that's what we had at home), and then added in 3 fresh, chopped tomatoes.  We used freshly ground pepper.  It turned out great.

I usually make ratatouille with fresh tomatoes, but I'd tried this as is in the slow cooker and don't think it would have made much difference. For reviewers who said it came out a little bitter, try adding the tomato paste earlier (I added mine at the beginning, because I find that longer cooking softens its bitter notes), and be sure to use a large onion for sweetness.

Delicious!  I made it in the crock pot - the whole house smelled wonderful!  It took some time to dice everything up but WELL worth the effort!  We had it by itself, likely even better over rice or pasta!

As written, this recipe is just okay and BLAND. With that said, it is a solid foundation for a much better recipe with personalized tweaks as you will read in a multitude of reviews for this dish.  For my personalization, I added a tablespoon of italian seasoning, a half-tablespoon of dried parsley, a full teaspoon of garlic powder, and at the end with the tomato paste, I added a splash (about a tablespoon) of red wine vinegar.  I also peeled my eggplant to save time on the salt soak and removing the bitterness.

I also cooked this using the submitter's suggested crock pot method and  this method is a solid one for prep, set, and forget.

Yummy!  I was trying to make it like my mom made it growing up so I added chunks of fresh mozzarella  at the end and let it melt in and get gooey.  Really gpod!  I also spiced it up with some hot pepper and a little hot sauce.  I really wish I had fresh basil too but was good without!

I sauted the veggies in the oil and spices for a couple of minutes then put everything in a crock pot for a couple of hours. It cooked to perfection with just an occasional stir. When it was done to my liking I served it with grated parmesan cheese. 
The parmesan cheese makes it 5 stars.

My husband put this together today.  We had it in the crockpot on low for 8 hours.  The taste was fantastic and not heavy.  I do not have Italian Seasoning but I looked up what spices made that seasoning and created my own.  I also had 2 large minced garlic cloves as we like garlic.  He served it over pasta and it was a great dish.  Will make it again, and again, and again.

I prefer "sweating" all the veggies in olive oil before adding crushed canned tomatoes and spices, peel the eggplant or it will be bitter, then simmer covered loosely until thickened. Sweating veggies for soups, stews carmelizes and intensifies the flavor and reduces the cooking time. Tomato paste gives a more intense tomato flavor,  I have never used in any dish.

I made this tonight using tomatoes, zucchini, eggplant and herbs from my own garden. Onion and garlic were waiting in the fridge. Yummy with grilled lamb chops. And enough left over to have cold with a poached egg for breakfast!  My garden capsicums are almost ready too. I’ll add them to the next batch. Amounts of veges in mix can be varied and so can herbs. This time I used sage and marjoram

I made this for dinner tonight and it was so delicious and easy to cook. Instead of can tomato, I added tomato pasta source, but the idea was not bad. Because I didn’t need any seasoning. Everything is included in pasta sauce.

I followed the recipe for the most part. I wasn't sure what "Italian seasoning" meant so I added garlic, dried basil, dried oregano and dried thyme all ground up to a semi-powdery consistency.  Near the end of the cooking, I removed all the vegetables and reduced the remaining liquid to about 1/3 cup.  It was far too watery.  That worked like a charm.  Just enough to finish off the dish.

This was good my first time making this dish. I have had store bought in a jar and could not stop eating. This is as good I keep going back tasting to figure out which veggie is making it taste so unuasually good.

I followed the advice of another reviewer and soaked the eggplant first.  The end result was much better than I hoped for - very tasty!  I didn't have yellow squash, and added shredded carrots, but otherwise followed the recipe.  It made a huge batch, but very low calorie and flavorful.  I serve it over rice.

I will definitely make this again!!  My first round with this recipe was delicious then the second time I made it,  I added cooked ground beef and a can of black beans  then topped it off with fresh Parm cheese.  

May add pasta to it the next time as well!!  Great Vegetarian dish if wanted or with meat...either way my family loved it, even my "where's the meat" husband!

Great idea for using up veggies. I had an eggplant, a zucchini, a green bell pepper, an onion, and also 3 Indian green chillies and fresh garlic. I diced up all these veggies and sautéed them first till they browned a bit, and then added 3 gorgeous vine tomatoes. This helped the veggies stand out a little more, I felt. The chillies spiked up the flavour for sure!! It was delicious and so easy to make.

I have never cooked ratatouille before so I thought "why not?". I did add more spices to the dish, such as Basil, Oregano, Thyme, Marjoram, and lots of Garlic. I absolutely loved it!!
I will definitely prepare this on a regular basis!

I made this in my crockpot and it was delicious.  I served it over quinoa, topped with a little feta cheese.  A healthy and filling meal.  I will definitely make this again.

Enjoyed this and it was so easy, even though I have never eaten, much less, cooked Ratatouille.  I added a small, diced potato, just because I thought it sounded good.  It all smelled like spaghetti sauce, probably because of the garlic and Italian seasonings.
