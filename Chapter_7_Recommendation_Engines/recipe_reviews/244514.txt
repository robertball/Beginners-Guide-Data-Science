Saute the onion in the butter before you make the roux. Cut down the flour to two tablespoons, then follow as directed except add 1/2 c shredded cheese to the mixture. Sprinkle another 1/2 c on top after you've turned everything out into the casserole.

Family loved it!  Instead of "3 tablespoons chopped onion" I put in an entire dices sauteed onion (we love onion).

A little bland. Needs more salt and pepper and a little too much mayo for my taste. But would make again with these adjustments.

We did not care for this.  Husband is not a big fan of vegetables to begin with and this was no exception.  I made as directed except I didn't need 10 servings so I reduced the recipe to 4 servings and I used fresh steamed broccoli.  It was very pretty
but was very bland and mushy.  I am sure I could tweek this with spices but I won't and will not make this again.  Sorry just didn't work for us.

Absolutely delicious! I sautéed the onions plus 1 Tbsp minced garlic with the butter before adding the flour and milk to make the roux. Otherwise, I didn’t change it and wouldn’t! It says ten servings, which may be correct if you’re serving it as a side dish. As a meal, this made only 4-6 servings. I used a 4 quart casserole dish and it didn’t even fill it halfway.

My family includes 2 Vegetarians and I wanted something that they could enjoy with Thanksgiving dinner. But the leftover was enjoyed by all for Breakfast the next morning!  This will be a traditional dish for the Holidays for sure! 
It was delicious and the only difference was I used a grated 4 cheese blend instead of only cheddar.

I used Harvarti Creamy cheese and added a few chopped garlics and caramelized it with onions when I heated up the butter. I added chopped ham.  This came out OUTSTANDING! Soooo good!

This was a very good broccoli souffle. It's the first time I've ever made one.  I found this recipe easy to follow and forgiving of minor mis-steps. Leftovers kept well and reheated in the oven nicely.  I made mine with fresh chopped steamed broccoli. Next time I might add a few touches of my own to add a little more flavor as I found the taste just a wee bit on the bland side.  It was one of those deals where the first bite or two tasted a little bland but the more you ate the better it tasted...lol.  I'll be keeping this as my basic broccoli souffle recipe.

It's rare that I actually have all the ingredients for a recipe, but I was pretty close on this one.  I used soy milk and mixed Swiss cheese with the cheddar.  It was GREAT!

Made it. Loved it. Will definitely make again! 

I made two small changes:
- used liquid eggs (egg beaters) vs real eggs 
- cut back a bit on mayo (used about 75% of what recipe called for).

We loved it and it is now a favorite in our family!  The only change I made was to use fresh broccoli (because that's what I had on hand) that I chopped, then steamed a little before combining with the other ingredients.

We enjoyed the recipe but thought the white sauce a little to thick -- next time I would reduce the flour by 1/2 and I think it would be a better consistency.

Even though there were no added spices, this was very flavorful! I used fresh broccoli and scaled it down to 2 eggs. Perfect for a small casserole dish. Had a portion as my main dinner tonight. It would be a good side dish. UPDATE:  Very light and fluffy. Added garlic powder to the sauce this time. Delicious.
