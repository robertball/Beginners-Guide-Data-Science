lemon is a must in this for me...and cilantro also but I sometimes don't have i and find that adding some hot sauce makes it nice too. don't think the mayo is really necessary either. for me this isn't really guacamole but another type of avocado dip. guac needs lemon and cilantro

For as simple as this is, I really liked it! I liked the bit of sweetness and lightness of it. This would make a wonderful sandwich/burger spread, but I was dipping pretzels in it, and that was great too...I will def be making this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Pretty decent tasting guacamole. I switched out the pepper for granulated garlic and added less mayo and more pepper sauce. I have a garden that is over run with tomatoes right now so I used up a small one. Good little snack, thanks for sharing.
