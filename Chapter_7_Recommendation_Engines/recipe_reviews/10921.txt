These bars are really good despite how easy they are!  I've found that to take away the "cake mix" flavor of the bars, I use a yellow cake mix and add a tablespoon of lemon juice, and a tsp. or so of lemon zest (or lemon extract works well if you don't have fresh lemon zest).  To make these bars a bit prettier, I drizzle them lightly with a powdered sugar/lemon juice glaze, and cut them into diamonds or triangles.

Made these for a graduation party!!!
Fabulous and so easy...I couldn't find a Lemon Cake mix with the pudding already in, so I added a small package of Lemon Instant pudding and it worked out great!  Will make again!

very nice.  Made exactly as stated but did add 1/2 tsp. lemon extract to the cream cheese layer and the grated peel from 1 lemon.  These were not sweet and sickening, and had a wonderful lemon flavor with the zest.  The cream cheese layer offset what could otherwise be a very sweet rich bar.  I didn't think they tasted like cake mix at all.  I would definitely make again.  *Make sure they are completely cool before cutting.  Thanks for the nice recipe.

I made these for a party, and was a little leery, only because I don't like making things for gatherings that I haven't tried before-it's so embarrassing to make something that turns out terrible.  These are awesome.  So much better than any lemon bar I have ever made, and I'm a huge lemon bar fan.  So for those of you that are non-believers like me, this one rocks.  As per other suggestions, I did double the filling, and added a little extra lemon (juice of two lemons, total)  Perfect.  I'd give it more than 5 stars if I could!!

This was a really good lemon bar recipe, however it really needs to have double the filling.  Also, the amount of lemon juice the recipe calls for makes for a really mild lemony flavor.  I would suggest, if you like the bars to be lemony, increasing the amount of lemon juice.  We used 5 tbls in ours.  This recipe passed my boyfriend's taste test--and we've been through every box recipe the stores have to offer!

I used a lemon cake mix and a small box of lemon pudding for the crust and then i doubled the filling, using juice from 3 lemons, it was a hit everyone loved them!

Very good.  I did decrease sugar in cream cheese mixture to 1/4 cup, doubled juice and added lemon zest.  Not too sweet as others had said.

We really enjoyed the recipe....very tasty, and so easy to make. We like ours a little more lemony so we used juice from two large lemons. Very good....A keeper!

Made changes as suggested by others and these were AWESOME!! This is one of those things that tastes and looks so good you will find it hard to believe you made it yourself. Notes for next time: Used 12 oz cream cheese and a bit less than 1/2 cup sugar.  Used the zest from one lemon and 1/4 c. lemon juice (from 1 1/2 lemons), put 1/3 of the zest and a Tablespoon of juice in with the cake mix and the rest of the zest and juice in the cream cheese filling.  Cooked as directed but with the extra liquid it needed about 25 minutes for the second stay in the oven instead of 15.  Dusted with powdered sugar once it was cool. Soooooo yummy!!

This recipe got me 2nd place in a cookie contest today!  It was a big hit. I made a double batch and the only thing I might change for next time is using less cake mix for the bottom crust because it was very thick. I added a pack of instant lemon pudding mix in with the crust as well.  I did double the of filling so for a double batch I used 4 cream cheese. I used 2 fresh lemons for lemon juice and also put a little lemon zest in with the cream cheese filling and another pack of lemon instant pudding mix.  I baked it with the filling and crust crumbled on top for about 25 minutes. Do let it completely cool before cutting to cut smoothly. They stay very moist. I rate this 5 stars and will bake again!

These lemon bars were pretty good and very easy for my kids to make. Although they didn't like them, they did have fun making them. I listened to some of the other reviewers and doubled the filling, I don't think these would have been very good at all if I hadn't.

So easy and so yummy! I was skeptical of how this would turn out but it was great for a casual mother's day dessert. I used Lemon Supreme cake mix with a box of instant vanilla pudding mixed in and I used 1.5 packages of cream cheese with half a juicy lemon, a bit more sugar than asked for and a tsp of pure vanilla. Will definitely make again for friends.

I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW GREAT THESE TURNED OUT!! THEY'RE JUST DELICIOUS. THE LEMON FLAVOR WAS VERY GOOD, AND THE CREAM CHEESE FILLING MADE THEM LUCIOUS. BEST OF ALL, THEY'RE RIDICULOUSLY SIMPLE. THIS IS A KEEPER!!

These were so easy and tasted great. I made them for a work function and they were a big hit. I used the juice from half a lemon in the base, and the juice from the other half, along with the zest from the lemon for the filling. I dusted the top with icing sugar before serving. I will definitely be making them again.

very good, so rich and creamy, I tried some suggestions others had made, I mixed cake mix and added the pudding mix, I doubled the filling and used about 5tbsp of lemon juice in total and about 1tsp of zest, and some yellow food colouing to the filling. I made this and another lemon bar recipe from this site (Lemon Coconut Squares) at the same time to see which everyone prefered and this got the most votes with everyone also commenting on how great the crust was

Holy Cow, these were good! They were gone an hour after I made them. Terrific Recipe!!!!! I always read the reviews before trying any of the recipes on this site; a lot of people doubled the cream cheese layer. I only had one package of cream cheese so I used 1/4 cup of lemon juice and that made Plenty to cover the bottom layer. I don't think you need to double the cream cheese unless you want some RICH bars.

These were REALLY good.  I increased the filling ingredients by 50% as suggested... they are definitely not like traditional lemon bars but they are much easier to make and taste lovely.  These will be made again, I'm sure!  (I used Betty Crocker Super Moist Lemon Cake mix... no pudding, but that didn't seem to matter.)

These are delicious! I could not find lemon cake mix with pudding added so I took someone elses suggestion and added a small box of lemon puddingto the cake mix. Other than that I followed this recipe exactly. If I could give it more stars I would!

I just made these to bring to a baby shower. I was nervous because i dont like t bring something i have not made and tried before, but these seemed easy enough too not screw up.

I was nervous when I pulled them because the edges of the crust were browning but I thought the filling was still too jiggily. i cooled on the counter and that didn't help much. I chilled them in the fridge and that did the trick. Everyone at the party RAVED about these and wanted the recipe. I just emailed it out right now to about 5 ladies. What a simple dish and what a huge hit! THANKS FOR MAKING ME LOOK LIKE A ROCK STAR!

This recipe is incredibly good, the only thing I changed was that I used 8 tablespoons of lemon juice.  So many people called them phenomenal! I enjoyed sharing Peggy's recipe with my sisters-in-law and mom.  Thank you!

Going by the other reviews, I also doubled the "filling" for this cookie bar.  I don't believe the amount written would have been enough.  I also, like many other reviewers like a stronger lemon flavor, so I used the zest and juice from 1 1/2 lemons.  I also added 1 box instant sugar-free lemon pudding to the cream filling and couple drops of yellow food color.  The bars are very good.  My family liked them.  They are kind of like a little cheese-cake cookie.  Very good.

I wasn't thrilled with these. I added toasted pecans and allmonds to the topping - which ended up being my favorite part. I think they might be better with a yellow or butter flavored cake mix. I'm a big cake mix fan, but the lemon tasted really artificial and chemical to me. It's a good idea for a quckie dessert, just didn't work out for me. Thanks for the chance to try it. :)

Once again I've been fooled from seeing so many 4 and 5 star ratings for this recipe.It's been 2 days since I made this and I've still got over 2/3's of a pan left.If this was good it'd be all gone by now.I'm not sure what I'd do to improve on this,one thing I'd definately do would be to use fresh lemon juice,the bottled stuff just doesn't have enough taste.Then there's the taste of the cake mix base,all I could taste was the chemical preservatives in it and I used a leading brand too.Any recipe that I've tried that calls for a boxed cake mix as a base always has that taste.Sorry but I'll never be making this again.

Definitely easy.  These are not quite as good as a true lemon bar, but are still great.  I took these to work and they were all gone by the end of the school day.  I had no problems with assembly, and although the crust seemed thin when I was pressing it into the pan, it did puff up and was fine.  I let these cook to room temperature and then refrigerated over night, which made them cut easily and cleanly.

I absolutely love this recipe. I add a different twist by crumbling coconut macaroons on top instead of the reserved cake mix. Delicious.

Delicious and so easy to make.  I've made them several times and they've always turned out great.  Everyone that has tried them says they're really good.

If you are looking for a traditional tart lemon bar this is not the one to make.  I prefer traditional style but made this one because I had some lemon cake mix in my cupboard.  I myself did not enjoy the imitation lemon flavour created by the cake mix. I took them over to my mother's house because my boyfriend and I couldn't eat them. RAVE REVIEWS!  I was shocked.  My mother served them with tea to some of her friends and they all wanted the recipe.  One lady took some home to her husband who hates lemon bars I might add!  He loved them, he told her to get the recipe so he could have his own batch.  I rated this with 3 stars because I didn't think they were that hot...but got rave reviews from others.  I guess this is one of those recipes you either love or hate!

I had been craving a good Lemon Bar recipe for a little while and thought this one looked easy.  My whole family and I really enjoyed Peggy's recipe for Thanksgiving.

A big hit and truly easy!  I made 1.5 times the filling and used 4 tablespoons of lemon juice.  These were even better the next day, they need time to sit!

Just like other reviewers, I found that there was not enough filling.  The cake mixture that you're supposed to save to crumble on the top expanded in the oven - when i took the bars out of the oven, they resembled Barney Rubble bars!  Taste was fair....

My husband seemed to really like these but I just don't really care for fruity type desserts. He said he would like me to make again so that makes it a winner for me. They were easy to make which was a huge plus! Also I didn't find mix with pudding so I used plain lemon cake mix and I used lemon extract in place of lemon juice since I did not have it. It seemed to work out fine.

I wouldn't have believed it.  I was desperate for a non-dairy lemon bar recipe and all I had handy was HALF a box of lemon cake mix, some lemons and some Tofutti cream cheese (half a tub).  I prepared the recipe exactly as directed, using HALF an egg (broken in a cup and stirred well) in the cake mix and HALF in the "cream cheese" mixture.  Well, I wasn't expecting much, but it was actually very tasty, with almost no taste of cake mix at all!  Made in a smaller pan, obviously, and I would recommend making a full-sized batch ... if only because everybody's going to want seconds!

YUM!  I'm not a huge craver of lemon stuff but these are just delicious!  I made two small changes per previous reviews.  1) I doubled the filling.  Hey, I AM a craver of cream cheese and figured it wouldn't hurt. :)  and 2) I added a Tbls of lemon juice with some zest into the cake mix.  I might add some more next time just to make it a little more tart but they're yummy as is.  Thank you so much for the recipe!!  They sure were easy - except for the 2nd trip to the store because I was out of sugar.  Haha!

I can't overemphasize how easy this recipe is.  More specifically, how easy this crust is.  And cheap.  For about $1 you have a perfect crust.  I was a little concerned how thin it was, but it expanded while cooking and was great.  I'm going to use this crust recipe for all sorts of bars now.  A great shortbread crust is good, but with the cost of butter these days, this takes the cake!  The filling was also good, although I prefer a traditional lemon bars topping over this cream cheese one.

Yummy!  I like these bars better than traditional lemon bars.  The crumble topping is very good.  I took the advice of other viewers and added the juice from half of a lemon and also zest from half of a lemon to the crust mixture.  I also added extra juice and more zest to the filling and they turned out with lots of lemon flavor.  They are good as is but next time I will double the filling as some others suggested to see if I like it better.  Overall, this is a very good and easy recipe.

I've been making these lemon bars for years, I believe this recipe was originally from Duncan Hines. I remember my mom copying it from Good Housekeeping magazine many years ago. :) I always thought the bars were delicious and easy to prepare but a little too thin. To remedy the problem, I started making a double batch and using a small browie pan for the "second" pan. Doing this gives you enough to make the whole bath a little thicker.  I also agree with others that add some extra lemon juice or lemon zest...gives a more lemony flavor.

I thought these bars were really good. I made them for mothers day and was not disappointed. I did double the cream cheese mixture and added 1/2 tsp more of lemon juice to the cream cheese. Yumm!!!

What's wrong with me?   I made this just as the recipe states-- but there was too much bottom crust and not enough filling or topping so the crust on the edge curled.   I would try this again but I would reserve more of the cake mixture for topping and press the bottom crust a little thinner and I would double the filling. It could be good.

This was pretty good.  I think the brand of cake mix you use probably makes a difference.  I altered slightly:  for the filling I added 1 cup of whipping cream and an egg.  Whipped it all together with the cream cheese and powdered sugar (didn't have any other) and it was fluffier.  I baked it and it tasted good, but I think next time I'll leave off the top layer and freeze the bars instead.  I think this could be interesting to try with chocolate cake mix or a cookie crust, and mint added to the filling in place of the lemon.

Good lemon bar BUT the cake mix in this is obvious.  I think if you tell people then they'll be impressed by the versatility of the cake mix, if you don't tell then it's not so hot.  I made an addition to the recipe.  Many people said there wasn't enough cream cheese so I decided to add another filling.  I made a lemon meringue type filling by whisking together 1/2c sugar, 1/2c water, 2 tbsp cornstarch, 2 tbsp butter, and 3 tbsp lemon juice and bringing to a boil.  I spooned that directly on top of the cream cheese and swirled the two together a little and finished baking as instructed.  It's a little more tart that it would have been but I love it like that.

I just made this recipe for a Mother's Day brunch and it turned out beautifully!  Very easy, yet very tasty as well.  Very subtle on the lemon so it's not overpowering.  I am so pleased with these that I will definitely make them again.  Couldn't be happier!!

I liked these for the simplicity . I did however tweek it a bit, added fresh lemon juice to cake mix, and added 1/2 cup of lemon curd (found at grocery store international section) to the cream cheese mixture. Yummy!

i definitely found this lemony enough!
additions i made: 
*i doubled the cream cheese mixture and found it to be too much so I would stick with the original recipe.
*i used the juice from 1 lemon. i microwaved the lemon for 15 seconds before squeezing to yield more juice.
*also added lemon zest from the one lemon i used for juice.

These are different from usual lemon bars.  The base is very cake-like, so the bars end up very soft and dense.  The recipe does not exaggerate - the dough for the base is dry when you mix it, about the consistency of Play-Doh, but is very soft after baking.  The flavor is good, very rich.  I followed other suggestions and doubled the filling mixture and added even more lemon juice, about 6 Tablespoons total.  With the sugar and richness of the cake base, they were not too tart.  If I made these again, I would probably only reserve about 1/2 cup of the base to sprinkle on top, and maybe top with some sliced almonds for texture.

I didn't have lemon flavored cake mix 
on hand so I used a yellow cake mix
and added one box of instant lemon flavored
pudding. I also doubled the amount
of lemon juice. This was quick and 
easy for a last minute party. 
Next time, I might try adding chopped nuts to the
top of the cake or toasted coconut. Thanks!

Yummy!  I couldn't find a cake mix with the pudding inside, so I bought a lemon cake mix and lemon pudding.  So tangy and sweet!  It was perfect.  Everyone at the office loved them! Thanks!

This is a great recipe.  The only change I made was to increase the lemon juice to 1/4 cup, after reading reviews that 1 T. wasn't lemony enough.  My husband HATES lemons and lemon-flavored anything, but said these were good and that even with the increased lemon juice, were not overpowering.  All the reviews saying the filling should be doubled, I don't agree - I thought the amount of filling was perfect for a lemon bar, which I think of being more of a cookie rather than cakelike.  To each his own!  I will definitely make again! (Also, I used a plastic tumbler to roll over the crust in the pan, rather than pressing it with my fingers...much faster and less mess!)

EXCELLENT! I did as others suggested, doubled the filling, but I ALSO doubled the cake mix part. I used 2 lemon cake mixes with pudding in the mix (Betty Crocker), ADDED 1 small box of instant lemon pudding, 2 eggs & 1 C. oil and 1 Tbl Lemon Extract (1/2 mixture into 9 x 13, 1/2 mixture for top). Then for the FILLING, I used 3 pkgs, 2/3 C. sugar, 1/4 C. lemon juice, yellow coloring AND 3 EGGS (so it would firm while cooking).  Baked about 30 mins until topping browned and middle firmed... EXCELLENT.

This is a great recipe, easy and I too got loads of compliments.
Changes I made...  
I doubled the filling as suggested 
Used golden cake mix and small package of lemon putting mix.
Juiced lemons, half a lemon in the crust and 1 1/2 in the filling.  
Zested the lemon rind and put zest from half a lemon in the crust and zest from 1 1/2 lemons in the filling.  
I added lemon extract to the filling and some yellow food coloring for presentation.
I found when baking, after 20 minutes the top crust was not toasting, so I put the oven on broil for just a minute and it came out perfect.
Sprinkled with icing sugar also.

Make these for a bake sale to try them out. I love lemon so I too added 5 tbsp of lemon juice instead of the 1 tbsp.   Very quick bars to throw together at the last minute!  Great bars and had people asking for the recipe!

This recipe has a good flavor and consistency.
I added half of a lemon zest.
It's a good lemon bar, but the best I one 
that I have ever had comes from the 
recipe book called 101 things to do with a 
cake mix:)

As published, it's a 4 star recipe, pretty good & ridiculously easy.  Once the numerous reviewer recommendations are incorporated, it's a 5+ star delight.  What I did: coarsely shredded rind of 1 lemon added to crust mixture.  1/4 c sliced almonds added to reserved top crust mixture. Combined 1/4 c fresh lemon juice w/ low fat cream cheese,  4 oz tub of lemon yogurt, 11 drops of NuStevia extract to filling.  Bake as directed.

I made these for a church picnic. Can you say simple!! These were pretty good but I did add more lemon juice to the cream cheese filling. I would probably add some lemon juice or lemon zest to the crust next time as well. They werent SUPER lemony but still very good. They were all gone so they were well liked!

LOVE these!  My mom used to make these back in the 80's and she had gotten the recipe from a magazine I think.  I am so glad I found this recipe on here!  I like to add the lemon zest and juice from one lemon too!

Actually, I have to disagree with the reviewers who double up the cream cheese filling.  I DO agree with adding more lemon flavor.  My version added the juice and zest of one lemon.  Even our pickiest family member said these are the best.  And he's a chocoholic!  Thanks so much for sharing this.

This was the best recipe ever for Lemon Bars.  I've made them for my family several times as well as for an office cookie party.  There wasn't one left over, so you know they were good.  I have finicky eaters at the house too, and they loved them.  It's a great and easy recipe, and well worth trying - you will not be disappointed.  :-)

I love these bars. So quick n easy to make. Cheap too. Everytime the lemon cake mix is on sale I always stock up. I usually add a little bit more lemon juice b/c I like the "kick" it adds to it.  Great recipe. Thanks.

Very easy recipe and it tasted great! Instead of the lemon juice I used pure lemon extract. I also sprinkled some coconut over the cream cheese mixture before adding the rest of the cake mixture. Great lemon taste!

I doubled the filling like everyone suggested. I struggled with the baking time though. I added in an extra 10 minutes of baking time because the cheesecake filling didn't seem to set (and the topping wasn't browned). It still didn't work. I took them out cause I was afraid the crust would get too dark. It became a little bit more firm when it cooled but it was a still a little jiggly. I'm not sure what happened. But it was still delicious!

These were excellent.  I wasn't sure at first if I was going to like them, but they came out great - especially after chilling for a day in the fridge.  I used extra lemon juice (not sure how much, just used a large lemon and squoze the heck out of it).  Great flavor.  Hubby suggests using part oil and part butter for the cake mix to give the crust a more buttery flavor.  Will try that and let you know.

I made these lemon bars just as directed and they tasted great and are super easy to bake. I think that this recipe is much better than the lemon bars that come in the box down the grocery isle too. I will be making these again and again.

These bars were easy to make and a hit with my husband and at work,the only thing I suggest is to double the cream cheese filing and I used 1 lemon and used the juice from it and about 1 T. lemon juice from the bottle and the zest from the lemon,thanks for a easy and delicious recipe.

I'm not sure what I did wrong but when I combined the cake mix with the egg and oil, it became a paste instead of being crumbly.  I followed the directions carefully.  Not sure if the brand of cake mix makes a difference. The taste was fine for the base and filling but the consistency was just not right.

These were soooo good, and didn't taste like cake at all like others had stated. They had a really good lemony taste, and the cream cheese layer made them just delicious.  Will be making these again.

Super yummy - I used a yellow cake mix and added a package of lemon pudding. I also added a bit of yellow food coloring in the filling. These are light, and taste wonderful!

Very tasty. It does have a cake mix taste, but not overly so. I would make this again, though I think I'd double the filling. I also used a lemon box mix without pudding added.

i loved the recipe, the only thing i change was the pudding, mix. I used Duncan Hines Moist Deluxe Lemon Supreme. It was really good, tasted just like when I was a kid. Our oldest had some before through a friend, and it left a sour taste in his mouth, and claimed never to try them again. Now after seeing them come out of the oven, and pacing for them to chill, he LOVED IT!!! This is a keeper. Thank you!!!!

This was a very quick and easy recipe. I like more of a tart flavor then a sweet flavor so I added 1 tablespoon of lemon juice to the cake mixture (as suggested) and 2 1/2 tablespoons of fresh lemon juice to the cream cheese mixture. I kept the sugar amount the same and added some lemon zest. Baked for about 18 minutes after adding the cream cheese mixture on top. The bars were easy to cut and came out of the pan with no problems. They are more of a cream cheese bar but still very yummy and a great alternative for my daughter who is allergic to eggs. Easy to substitute 1 egg then the several that are in a normal lemon bar recipe.  Great recipe, will make again.

Enjoyed this easy recipe, with a few changes.
Used yellow cake mix and added 2 Tbl. lemon juice consentrate.  This resulted in the mixture not being dry and crumbly. So I had to spread it into the pan.  Then to the reserved cup of batter I added 1/4 cup sugar, beat it and it became crumbly for sprinkling over the cream cheese mixture.

Good, but not great. A little too sweet and not enough lemon flavor even though I added 2 tbsp extra lemon juice as suggested by other reviewers.

I picked this lemon bar recipe because a lot of people said it wasn't too over powering with the lemon.  Which was true but it still wasn't very good.  I didn't like the crumbled topping.  Maybe I'll try something different next time.

I usually use a different recipe for lemon bars, but I wanted to try something new and a little different.  After reading other reviews, I also added more lemon juice.  Overall, I just didn't care for this version.  I like the idea of using cream cheese, but I didn't like the the packaged cake mix.  I brought them to a party, and they received good compliments.

These were GREAT! As others suggested I doubled the cream cheese, used a scant 1/2 C sugar and more lemon juice. They did take longer to cook with the extra cream cheese and lemon juice. I will try to use lemon zest next time and/or more lemon juice, but WILL make again.  Also, they were better the next day (good thing there were some left over).

Wow!  Fantastic and easy!  I followed recipe exactly except I used the juice from one lemon - approx 4 tbsps, and then zested the lemon and added zest to the cream cheese mixture.  Will definitely make again!

These were delicious!!!!  I could not have been more pleased.  I had to improvise some though.  

My store did not have the lemon cake mix with the pudding.  So I ended up using Duncan Hines lemon supreme cake mix.  I added to it a small box of Jello instant lemon pudding mix.  No milk, just the dry powder.  I doubled the filling layer.  To the filling I added the juice of a small lemon (no measuring) I baked the crust 15 min just like the recipe says.  To get the topping to cover I used my hand to finely and evenly sprinkle it over the filling mixture.  I had to bake it 20 mintes for the filling to set.  I refrigerated them before cutting and serving them.  They turned out perfect!

These are excellent lemon bars! But after making them per the recipe, I did tweak future batches. First, I now leave out the cream cheese filling and substitute lemon curd. Adds a great burst of lemon to this bar and makes this easy dessert even easier since I use jarred lemon curd! Second, please don't let this try and brown on top, even slightly. You will have dry bars. Just bake until the top is set, and you are good to go! Moist, delicious and super lemony!

I made these lemon bars - haven't tasted them yet.  But one problem I had was that the lemon cake mix was only 15.25 oz, not the 18.25 oz and I could not find a bigger one.   I did complain to Betty Crocker.  I added a little flour but the topping was still not crumbly and didn't really brown.  Don't know how they will taste, but I don't think that there is quite enough filling.   I am trying them for a party but may end up eating them myself if they don't turn out right.  May have to go back to my mother's recipe which always turns out but is a bit harder.

This was actually so disappointing. I'm always skeptical about using boxed cake mixes and this recipe just confirms that scepticism. It tasted so fake and processed, and you could barely even taste the lemon despite me increasing the amount of lemon in there. Would not recommend this to anyone.

This recipe was great as is. I didn't change a thing. I was craving something lemony sweet and this was perfect. It hit the spot and the kids liked it too! It was really easy to make. I will definitely keep this recipe on hand.

These were terrible!  All I could taste was the fake lemon almost chemical taste from the lemon cake mix.  Even my kids wouldn't eat these and I ended up throwing out the whole pan.

The cake crust bottom was thick and hard as a rock - like a few day old lemon cook left out on a dish.  I doubled the cream cheese filling and it still spread so thin like a light frosting - quadrupling the batch would have equaled a "FILLING" and perhaps would have kept the crust moist - ?   How she got away with just one batch of filling is a wonder!!

definitely have to double the cream cheese,sugar and lemon juice (filling part)    Also I buttered the glass casserole dish, cant imagine how it would have come out without doing so.  But all in all for a quick recipe i think it is very good.  p.s. I forgot that i added a tsp of vanilla and a tablespoon of butter to the filling :)

Not enough lemon filling or flavor and way too much crust. On top of this, the crust was not good. We only ate two bites (to try it) and threw the rest out. Waste of time.

They were pretty good, I'm not a lover of cream cheese but didn't mind it in this recipe, I thought the edges got a bit over done, but that could have been my oven. Next time I will only save half a cup of the mix for the topping, 1 cup was too much I thought. Would make again:)

This was great! Super fast and easy. I doubled the cream cheese filling and squeezed a whole fresh lemon in it. They taste like summer. I don't even like lemon bars! The topping looked like scrambled eggs on top though, Im not sure how I would fix that next time.

I thought I'd overcooked the "crust". After 15 min, it was pretty brown. However, it turned out crispy and delicious.

I think a better name for these bars would be cheesecake bars. There was not much of a lemon taste. The filling needs to be doubled.

My husband and I both thought these were good - he liked them more than I did.  I used a "super moist" cake mix as opposed to one with pudding. I never could notice much difference between them.  I think they need more of the cheese flavor so if I make these again, I'll definitely have to double that part of the recipe.

This is similar to the recipe I used to make from an old "Mr. Food" recipe book that I loved.. and lost. It makes a nice, firm bar - not as messy as many lemon bars.

The only thing that I had trouble with is the package size of the cake mix; it's hard to find a cake mix that is 18.25 oz. I used a 15.25 oz box. The bottom crust after it cooled seemed tough but when you put them in fridge overnight, it softens to a great texture. Good reviews from friends and family on recipe! thank you for posting it!

After reading other comments I planned to add extra cream cheese.  Did not have any, so I added 1/2 cup of sour cream.  Also added lemon zest to cream cheese and sprinkled a little on the topping.  My crust was very moist so I added a box of instant vanilla pudding to help dry it up.  Then I a few tablespoons of flour to the crust I saved for the topping.  The topping looked much better.

These are wonderful lemon cheesecake bars! I doubled the filling, and tripled the lemon juice plus I added some lemon zest. I baked for 15 min to set the crust, but it took about 30 min to set the filling and brown the topping. I live at high altitude, everything takes longer. Plus I did double the filling. So good! Definitely a keeper!

I love this recipe and so do my daughters! I double the filling, just a personal preference for a little thicker bar, but that is the only change I make. So easy and so Yummy!

I just think the recipe directions need some reworking. I felt like after I removed 1 cup of the dough I really didn't have enough left to adequately cover the bottom of a 9x13 pan. So I added about 1/4 cup back in. After the first bake, I'm thinking that maybe it just is meant to be spread more thinly than I thought as it does puff up nicely. It would have been more difficult to cover completely, but maybe the directions should mention that it will be quite a thin base. After the first bake it does say to cool while making the cream cheese mixture. Perhaps it should say to cool for at least 30 minutes as my mixture got quite melty and difficult to spread on the, still warm, base.   That said, it was very easy to make and they taste great. And this recipe would lend itself to many different flavors: chocolate cake with peppermint flavoring or vanilla cake with almond flavoring all would be delicious as well.

I could tell by reading the recipe that the filling was not going to be enough so I added a third more.  I still think it is lacking, it's more like a cookie than a soft bar.

We loved this recipe.  The only changes I made, were ones that I got from other reviews.  I doubled the filling, added more lemon juice, and for the "crust" I used lemon juice and zest (vanilla cake and vanilla pudding mixes).  Very lemon-y!  This got great reviews!  Thank you :)

Yummy as written.  However, we decided after making it as written that it really needed just a little more filling so we will double filling next time.

I really like this recipe. It looks and tastes great. I did make several modifications, however. I doubled the filling. I increased the lemon juice to 3-4 tablespoons (I used fresh squeezed). I added the freshly-grated zest from one lemon into the cream cheese mixture. I used melted butter instead of the oil. I mixed in sliced almonds with the topping. I baked it for about 7 minutes longer than the recipe stated because of the increased filling which included 2 minutes on a 380 degree broil because it wasn't browning very well.

I did add the small package of lemon pudding, also doubled the  cream cheese,  added 2 T. lemon zest I had previously grated and frozen plus the T.  lemon juice.  It came out pretty  good for not being totally homemade plus easier to make.

I changed the amount of lemon juice to 2/3 cup and added an extra tablespoon of flour to lemon topping mixture. Well, they were delicious....I just need to figure out the cooking time for my oven. First batch I over baked the crust (35 minutes) batch #2 under baked (27 minutes) ughh, I read a review that said better to over cook the crust than under  cook. She was RIGHT!  They still taste great, I'll try batch #3 soon.

I have never made lemon bars before, so I was relying on suggestions and the recipe alone to be wonderful, and it was!  I brought these to parent teacher conferences and several teachers told me how much they loved them! A couple even asked for the recipe.  Note that I did also double the cream cheese filling part as some others had suggested.  Because of this, they baked for probably 15 extra minutes.  I just kept checking them every 5 minutes or so until I felt like it was generally firm and the top was browned.  I also placed some powdered sugar in a fine strainer so I could sprinkle some on top- it made them looked more finished.

I made these bars as directed except I used a cake mix that did not have pudding. They were still fantastic, very easy and will make again. I like them better after they are refrigerated. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was an absolute hit at card club. I took the advice of other reviewers. Doubled the filling, added 5 additional Tbs. Of lemon juice and made a drizzle for the top of lemon juice and powdered sugar. I couldn't find cake mix with pudding so I added a box of instant lemon pudding. Absolutely sensational!

I made this recipe exactly as written, they came out perfect! And I won best tasting cookie at the cookie swap I made them for. For the crumbly bottom layer, you just have to really PRESS the crumbs in and they work out perfect.

Pretty good--definitely needs a lot more lemon juice--I added lemon juice until the filling tasted about right to me. That was my only deviation from recipe, except I had to bake it about an extra 15 minutes (30 approximately) to get some toasty golden brown onto the top crust.

Wonderful recipe. Brought these to work and my coworkers loved them, so did my boyfriend. The only note I would make is that 15 min in the oven might be a little too much (at least for my oven) on the second part of the baking process. Bottom got a little burnt, so watch that time. Otherwise, Awesome! I'll be making more this weekend.

So delicious! I added a box of sugar-free instant lemon pudding to the crust along with a teaspoon of lemon extract. I reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup in the filling and used the juice of one large lemon because I like my lemon bars tart. I agree with some other reviews and suggest doubling the filling. I made my bars in an 11 x 7 in. pan and everything came out perfect. I will be making these again and again!!

Not what I think of as lemon bars, but still pretty good.

My whole family enjoyed these very much, my husband who doesn't care for many sweets ate half the batch.  I did add a little more suger and lemon juice to it.  After I baked it I also drizzled a little powdered suger on top of it.  Great recipe.  I will make this one again.

I would definately make these again.  There were enough for the bake sale and to share with family.
