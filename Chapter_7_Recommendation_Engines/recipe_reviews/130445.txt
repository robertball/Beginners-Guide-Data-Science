Very nice. I love curry and we both like eggs - so this was a great new recipe.  I used sweet onions and eliminated the coriander.  My curry is a homemade dry blend so I only put 1 tablespoon and that was just right. Didn't use the cilantro either.

This just wasn't for me. I'm not a fan of eggs or curry paste, but luckily my boyfriend is! He enjoyed them, I didn't as much, hence the mixed review. Followed recipe perfectly, only used normal flour instead of ghee.

I used 1/2 t of the curry and it was simply great.

Just a mention from the author from the comments so far- the recipe should definitely include salt and pepper in it- plenty of seasoning is important in all egg recipes of course. Also, that in stage one, you should fry the thinly sliced onions until they start to brown/caramelise, not just when they are soft- this gets you a better flavour. 

Also, if you like it spicy, garnishing this with freshly chopped green chilli is a nice addition.

These were ok but the eggs themselves were pretty bland. Next time I will season both the onions and eggs, and add garlic, salt, and pepper.

Great flavors but very spicy. For one yield I only used 2 of the 3/8 amount of cayenne and it still had quite a kick. If you like spicy then you'll like it though
