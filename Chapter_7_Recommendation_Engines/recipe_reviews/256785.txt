This was very tasty! It was a great cheesy dip for tortilla chips, and then I used some of the leftovers to mix with ground beef and cooked bell peppers and onions and used alongside rice as a burrito filling... also delicious! Versatile and flavorful. Loved this.

Loved this! I didn't measure a thing that wasn't "pre-measured" for me (i.e. the can of chiles, the block of cream cheese), just turned on the stand mixer on low and started dumping things in until it looked right. We inhaled this stuff with Fritos scoops, chilled beers, and trashy reality tv. Fantastic recipe.

I made it for a Christmas get together. Everyone including myself liked it. But I found it a bit salty. Maybe next time I'll try making it with salt free taco seasoning, 'cause I think just the ham by itself makes the dip pretty salty along with the brine from the canned green chilies. Maybe i'll also reduce the amount of the chile brine i put in the dip too.

I made this for Family Dinner night. It was a big hit. I served it with Tostitos, but I think it would be really good with crackers or  baguette slices too.

This is a simple to make dip with a surprising twist with the addition of the ham.
