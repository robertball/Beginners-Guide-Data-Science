This was fantastic.  We took the advice of others and froze the milk in the ice tray.  we froze 1 cup and then added all to the blender.  Super tasty.  Our son wanted a bit more maple taste so we drizzled the top of his with a bit more.

This shake tasted nice--very peanut buttery! It was tasty and not as heavy as an ice cream shake. The night before I made this, I put the milk into ice cube trays. Then I just added a splash of milk to get it mixing in the blender. It had a nice frozen consistency.

This was a very good recipe. I suggest adding a little more maple syrup and I also added some ice to make it a little bit thicker.
