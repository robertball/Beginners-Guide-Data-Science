Chef John you did it again. Great recipe. Easy prep. Impressive presentation. Tasted great. Lots of compliments. 

I docked it one star because I was so tempted to eat the tails after the first step of cooking them in butter. Glad I didn't but the temptation was strong. 

The time estimate of about an hour for prep and cook was about right for me. I can recommend this recipe and will make it again.

Oh. My. God. I never liked Lobster Thermidor because of the horrible heavy sauce. Chef John fixed it. Thank you so very much for this recipe. My 23rd wedding anniversary was memorable,  in part because of this.

We thought these were good.   The tarragon was just a little overwhelming, so next time (and there will be a next time) I will cut that in half.

Made according to recipe. Awesome. Tarragon was a major ingredient to this recipe. Actually I  did make a minor change as I used lactose free whole milk instead of  regular whole milk.

I really liked that this recipe gave alternative ingredients. They made no difference in the taste. Wasn’t as rich,which was perfect. I will definitely make this again.

Absolutely fantastic! I only had minor changes because of what I had. Bourbon for the cognac and plain panko for the bread crumbs. I also used heavy cream for the milk and crème with a splash of lemon juice(thank you video). Love the addition of the mushrooms! The BF was blown away! The crumb mix on top gave it such a delicate crispiness to the creamy stuffing.....just wow! Yes, we will have this again!

I followed the recipe exactly. Even hunted down fresh tarragon at my grocier.  I've never had lobster thermidor before so, to be fair, I can't really compare this to others, but I'm going to stick with plain lobster tails.

We used claw meat so did not have shells for serving.  Doubled the recipe, and added some dry Colman's mustard and topped with panko bread crumbs in addition to the Parmesan cheese.  Baked in an 8x8 casserole dish for 20 minutes.  Delicious!

I did not have tarragon or shallots so I used regular onion minced . It was great! I loved this recipe! Chef John you knocked this recipe out of the park and my whole family loved it.

Made the recipe in 8 oz lobster tails.  They were just delicious!
I love that you can prepare them before guests arrive and bake them when you are ready to serve.

I use Allrecipes for almost everything I cook, and at least a dozen of Chef John’s recipes have become go-to recipes for me.  That said, this is the first time I’ve been compelled to review.  I made this as a treat for my lobster-loving boyfriend.  He said it was “awesome” and proclaimed it his “favorite way he’s ever eaten lobster.”  The recipe was easy enough and I followed it to the letter.  Plus, it looks so darn impressive!  Thanks for a great recipe; we can’t wait to have it again!

I followed the recipe and didn't change anything and it was AMAZING and EASY! I  served it with a side of  linguine and clam sauce and my husband loved it!!!!
