This is an excellent recipe.  I went a step further and put a "crisp" topping on it, i.e., equal parts of oatmeal, flour and brown sugar with a dash each of baking powder and baking soda and melted butter.  I added a little cinnamon to the berries and decreased the sugar a little.  What a dynamic duo!

Delicious recipe!  Careful when pouring huckleberry mixture into pastry mixture on bottom...pour slow and evenly over the pastry, otherwise the middle is very runny and messy.

This is my favorite way to bake with huckleberries!  The first time I used this recipe I was short on berries.  I chopped up some Fuji apples to make up for the missing huckleberries, and it was delicious!  I have found that I need to cook the cobbler 5 - 10 minutes longer than the suggested bake time in order to fully cook the center so it's not doughy.

I had been given a recipe very similar to this one by my husband's aunt when I got married 30 years ago.  It was a staple in our house and I made it with all sorts of berries, peaches, even apples.  I lost the recipe a few years ago and have been searching for it and here it is!  I knew as soon as I saw boiling water on the ingredient list that this was it!  One thing I do to make it a bit easier is to just layer the fruit on top of the batter, followed by the sugar and pour the water over top.  Like another reviewer suggested, keep a cookie sheet under the pan, it usually bubbles over.  This is one oof my favorite recipes ever!

This is a super yummy way to use up all those blackberries growing in my yard. One word of advise- the berry mixture has a tendency to bubble up out of the pan so it helps to put a baking sheet underneath to make cleanup a little easier

This was an awesome recipe! I took the advice of another reviewer and strained the berries before putting them on the batter. SO GOOD! The batter ended up being a cake-like consistency, which I didn't expect, but it was perfect. My boyfriend and I ate almost the whole pan right out of the oven. Make two, they'll go fast.

I've been on a "cobbler kick" for a few months now and have tried about 10 recipes from this site.  This is my favorite one so far.  I don't use huckleberries, though.  I've been using a frozen fruit salad mix (peaches, pineapple, honeydew melon, strawberries) which I toss with just a little sugar and 1 tbsp of cornstarch (no boiling water or butter).  Increase baking time to 60-65 minutes.  Come summer, I'll try this recipe using a variety of fresh fruits.

This was really easy and good!  I didn't put quite all the juice on when I was scooping the huckleberry, water, sugar mixture on top of the crust.  I just drained the berries out at the end w/ a slotted spoon after I figured there was enough juice on the crust.  We served vanilla ice-cream on top of warmed huckleberry buckle and was really good!!!

My family uses a similar recipe.  We mix the berries right in the batter, and after it cools from the oven, we top with powdered sugar.  It's good for breakfast!

This is a FANTASTIC dessert, and insanely easy to prepare. A couple of the changes I made to the dessert was instead of using huckleberries I used a frozen mixed berry blend. As well, the topping I changed up only because I had read a review that suggested making a crumble like topping. So I mixed brown sugar, butter, cinnamon and oats together and sprinkled it over top. I highly reccomend doing this because I'm sitting here waiting for round two of this dish in one week to be done in the oven! Soooo good!

Yields great results!  My family really enjoyed this dish!  I used a  slightly smaller dish, 8 in, as it was all i had on hand at the time but it worked fine! I didn't have any issues with it bubbling over.  I was a little hesitant to try this since we spent so long picking our huckleberries and I had never tired this before but it was more than worth it! It turned out great and everyone really enjoyed it!  One thing that I did add was a little cinnamon to both the flour and berry parts.  Overall great recipe! Will use again!

This was fabulously easy...few ingredients, easy to assemble, and a delicious warm desert with whipped cream or Cool Whip.  My family liked this so much I made it two nights in a row...1st night Blackberries, 2nd night  Peaches...whatever I have for frozen fruit during the winter months will go into this buckle! The kids loved it too!

This was very yummy! I used whole wheat flour because that is all I had, and it was still really good. It's the best warm with icecream for sure!

Made a double batch using 1/2 fresh huckleberries and 1/2 fresh raspberries.  Baked in a 9 x 13 x 2-inch glass pan for 55 minutes. Excellent taste and consistency.  This would be good with most any berries.

Very good and I did take a few of the suggestions listed; less sugar in the berries, I added a bit of cinnamon to the dough and added half cup each of oats and flour, 1/8 tsp each of baking powder and baking soda, cinnamon and bound it with 1/4 cup butter and spread over the top.  This will be my go-to cobbler recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly and it was great.  It tasted like huckleberry pancakes.  I thought it would be too sweet but it wasn't.  I will make again for sure.  Thank you for your recipe.

I was looking for a basic cobbler recipe to use up the wild raspberries and blackberries that grow on my property.  I used a mix of berries, but didn't make any other changes to the recipe and it was amazing.  Thanks.

I used fresh blueberries and added the crisp topping someone suggested.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe as given. I thought it was just OK.  The flavor was so-so, but not the texture.  It seemed a little gooey to me.  I could see how some people may like it, but I much prefer a good southern cobbler.

Made this for company yesterday with blueberries. It was fantastic.  I doubled it for a 13x9x2 pan and added the crispy crumble on top as suggested by other readers.  I didn't have whipped cream or ice cream to top it off, but as it turned out, this buckle did not need it. This is a stunning dessert. Thank you!

I made this recipe with raspberries. I also doubled it & used a 9" x 13" pan. It turns out great! After mixing the boiling water to the berries, I drained the berries before placing them atop the batter. This recipe is a keeper in our house.We brought it to church, everyone loved it!  There wasn't a morsel left. Next time I'm adding vanilla extract to the batter. The cake was nice & light... I sprinkled sugar atop after it came out of the oven...Yummy (I noticed a lot of people thought it was too sweet, but since I was using raspberries I didn't adjust the sugar, other than doubling the entire recipe.) -Cynthia (Bakersgirl0506)

Simple & delicious. I substituted frozen mixed berries and mixed them with only 1/2 cup of sugar. It was still sweet and 
tasty.

I have since made this with a few different fruits apples, peaches, pears as it is always a hit with the kids.

Needs something, but I'm not sure what. I might have to tinker with this one.

I tried this the other night when my 11 year old picked a bunch of red huckleberries! This is such a great recipe. I have no complaints and wouldn't change a thing... I will definitely be using this for other types of fruit.

Would have gotten 5 stars but for the fact that it was a hair too sweet for me. Next time I will try only a 1/2 cup of sugar in the berry mix.  Delicious flavor, though, and nice texture. I made it with fresh blueberries in a 9x13 pan... it cooked for about 40 minutes.

This was awesome!  I just tried it out on my parents tonight as an experiment before taking one to a church function.  My dad finished his, asked if there was any more left, then said he wanted to experiment some more.  I used blueberries because we don't have huckleberries around here, and it took only 40 minutes.  Otherwise, I followed the instructions to a T.  I have a feeling I'll be in the kitchen again tomorrow!

WOW. This recipe is not only super easy, but it's also one of the tastiest "buckles" I've ever had. My daughter, who is not a big blueberry/huckleberry fan, asked for seconds. The only thing I tweaked was to add about a teaspoon of lemon juice to the berry mixture. It was fantastic and we'll definitely make it again! :)

Yum!  This turned out very nicely- I used blueberries instead of huckleberries, and I drained the excess water from the blueberry mixture before pouring over the batter...it was lovely.  Will make again!

Wow! I thought it wouldn't turn out right because it seemed so simple but it was amazing! The only thing I did differently was put half the batter on the bottom of the pan and dribble the rest over the top of the berries and it was super delicious. Thank you!

Super easy with minimal ingredients and super delicious. I have baked quite a variety of cakes/pies using huckleberries before and this one is the easiest and most delicious. Having the berries on top Really brings out the flavor of the huckleberry rather than having it on the inside.

I had a bunch of red huckleberries growing in the yard and wanted a recipe that I could use them in. Though this one is designed with a darker huckleberry in mind I added a little lemon juice and zest to the huckleberry mixture before adding it to the pan. I also used the oatmeal/flour/brown sugar topping suggested by another reviewer which made it delicious from top to bottom. Once I took the buckle out of the oven I garnished it again lightly with brown sugar and lemon juice and then I served it a la mode with a little more lemon zest, yum!

Yum...this was good we pick fresh huckleberries in our area every summer and I usually just make pies and freezer jam but this was a nice change and it was good served still a little warm with vanilla ice cream. Even my picky 8 year old loved it!
