Made it for the first time and it is very easy and tasty as heck. I used half of the large bag of pre-cut fresh broccoli, six slices of bacon instead of eight, used pecans instead of sunflower seeds and real mayo. Mixing the pecans in with the warm bacon, warms them up & mixes their flavors,  so I would not recommend using store-bought bacon bits. I'm reading comments about skipping the red onion, but I would say to just cut them smaller...the red onion adds so much to the overall success of this dish.  It was a hit and my picky-eater son polished off the left-overs for breakfast this morning. Next time I'll initially cut back on the sugar then add to taste, but I plan on making it again tonight!

Lovely, I substituted 3/4 C greek yogurt plus 1/2 c. mayo, since I used a little bit more broccoli, then I added about a TBSP of pomegranate balsalmic vinegar to punch it up a bit.Yummy!

The first time I made this I followed the directions exactly.  The second time I diced the bacon before cooking it, Then I mixed everything together and put it in the fridge overnight.  We all like it better this way.  We all thought it had more flavor.   I added a handful of chopped Walnuts too.

I made this twice. The first time was a disaster and I ended up throwing a lot of it away but the second time was excellent. I don't know what I did the first time but the sauce was very runny. Instead of coating the broccoli, it collected at the bottom of the bowl. The broccoli was very bland. Take 2: I refrigerated the sauce overnight which resulted in a thicker consistency and I also only added enough sauce to coat the broccoli. Much better! Another change is that I didn't blanch the broccoli first. Ugh. Don't do that! The broccoli turned yellow overnight in the fridge and hmm, it just occurred to me that the extra moisture from cooking and rinsing the broccoli might have been what made the sauce runny. I also added a very small amount of red onion the second time around because IMO a little onion goes a long way in a cold dish like this. Lastly, despite my best efforts to wait until the last minute to buy grapes and carefully hide them in the fridge, it was not enough to prevent my children from laying waste to the entire bag in record time. So I substituted craisins instead. Grapes would probably be just fine but now I'm in love with the craisin version. It was amazing and I got lots of compliments. There it is. I hope someone else can learn from my mistakes!

Yummy and easy to make.  This dish is always a hit as a take along side dish.  Substitute a raspberry vinaigrette dressing for the mayonnaise if it has to sit out for any length of time.

I know this recipe is good, I came up with it 25 years ago( minus the onion). I'm more than a little pissed that it found it's way online. It used to be my go to.

My family and coworkers love this salad! To make it a little healthier, I double the broccoli and replace 1/2 the mayo with plain Greek yogurt. Fantastic:)

Yum, I subbed dried cherries since I didn't have any grapes. No onion, so I left it out. Added slivered almonds and a sharp white cheddar. Easy to play around with and very tasty!

I substitute red wine vinegar for the cider vinegar  and marinate the salad in tight container in frig by turning over and allowing the dressing to permeate the whole salad, upside down.
Good!  Husband loves it, too.

Made this for a bring a dish potluck. Even though the directions state to not substitute anything for the grapes, I used apples. Turned out awesome, with zero left overs...and by no leftovers, I mean someone scraped the bowl clean.

Tripled this for a wedding luncheon. It was a hit and had multiple requests for the recipe. Only change I made was using sliced almonds and roasted them to bring out the flavor in place of the sunflower seeds because its what I had on hand.

A fresh tasting salad with nice texture.  The vinegar is not overwhelming.  When you let the flavors marinate the result is tangy but not overpowering.

My family loved this! My Dr had told me to eat broccoli more because of it’s anti-inflammatory properties. Problem isn’t I have hated it my whole life. Tasted bitter to me. But this salad changed that! I subbed red vine vinegar for the other kind and a little less red onion but other than that......this entire salad was eaten in one night so I turned around and made it again the next night. And yes, if it sits overnight in the fridge, it  gets even better!  This will be regular at my house now. (BE sure and keep bacon and sunflower seeds separate till right before serving.)

I used this for a guideline but wanted to make it lighter. Subbed fat free plain greek yogurt for all but 1/4 cup mayo, used dried grapes (because I needed to use them) , green onions, no bacon, and stevia.  Same basic flavors (except the bacon) and a bit healthier.

Ok hard to give anything that's mainly broccoli  4 stars even but this does it. I made a few changes to make it even more healthy, changing to yogurt instead of mayonnaise, honey VS white sugar and added raisins. Oh ya and I left out the bacon. Sinful almost I know but it's a lot healthier and faster to make. This is great for men past 30 to block estrogen. Fast and easy to make and take anywhere.

A friend just gave me a recipe similar to this and asked me to make it for him. I checked out AR for tips and what not on prep. They are all basically the same views...which is saying that it is a good solid recipe! They vary with slices of bacon, amount of mayo, what seed, sugar, kind of vinegar, etc... So basically like any salad add more if you like it and less if you don't! Thank God for Mothers !

I had been looking for a great Broccoli Salad recipe and found it in this one.  The only changes that I made were that I added some extra mayo (the apple cider vinegar flavor seemed stronger than expected) - and I added some golden grapes and some chopped pecans to fill things out a bit (since I had a little extra sauce).  I also let it marinade overnight.  It was perfect for our Mother's Day BBQ and will be a staple throughout our Summer cookouts for sure!

Loved it! I added some roughly grated cheese to it - turned out excellent. Sorry, didn't get any pictures because it was devoured.

I have made this a few times and its always a hit! Instead of regular sunflower seeds, I use some that are "butter toffee". I find these at Dollar General (for $1!!) and they add a great sweet, brulee-type flavor to the salad. This year I am using "Cotton Candy" Grapes, too!

Making for a 2nd time; brought to work potluck and it was gone in no time.  Left out bacon for vegetarian coworkers and I didn't miss it.  This was a hit!

I got this recipe from a coworker at an office BBQ and fell in love.  I doubled the amount .  In doing so I found that it was saucy.  I would only recommend that if you do DBL the recipe, to visually judge how saucy you like as it does not absorb into or thicken.  I  added every amount for this round as a test run.  Kept the recipe exactly to the letter with the exception I used Light Mayo.... Just delicious!!!!   Will be making again, makes a great meal.

This is delicious! I didn't know broccoli salad could get any better! I was out of sunflower seeds so added the only seed or nut I had, pistachios.  I also made another half batch and added cauliflower to use up. Both were tasty and easy! Keeper.

So delicious & different! It was well received by my husband & my dad who are both a bit particular about salads. I made mine with a 50/50 mix of green & red seedless grapes. Making it again today, only a double batch as the last time I made it we all had one good sized serving & there was only enough leftover for one more serving lol. Try this, it's tasty. My tip is to chop up all the bacon before you cook it so you don't have to fight crumbling the fattier pieces.

We used pecans instead of sunflower seeds and subbed honey for the sugar in the dressing.  Excellent!

I love this salad just as it is, however one time  I only had 3/4 cup of mayo so finished the cup with ranch dressing.  We loved it, so I always make it that way now.
