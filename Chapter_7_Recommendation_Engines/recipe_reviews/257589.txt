I subbed chopped fresh baby spinach for the arugula, as it wasn't available at my store. The toasted buns and Sriracha mayo were a delicious addition to the eggs, sausage and cheese. Thanks, Ball Park!

Easy to put together breakfast sandwich with a twist using arugula.  I loved the spicy fresh bite the arugula added to the sandwich.  I wasn't a fan of using scrambled eggs.  The eggs kept falling out of the sandwich.   I would use a fried egg next time.  I also buttered and grilled the buns instead of toasting in the oven.

7.1.18  What a nice breakfast today.  I like arugula, however,  I’m not sure I’d add that again, but I really enjoyed the sriracha mayo on this sandwich, excellent partner to the sausage!  I did butter and toast the bun (always do that),  otherwise, followed the recipe to the letter.

I really liked the sauce and the arugula.  This was a nice twist to an old favorite.  This was a hit with the family.  I'll be making them again.

These were excellent and a great way to start your morning. They'd make a great breakfast for dinner too! The spicy mayo and arugula  really sets this one apart from other breakfast sandwiches. This is one I will make often. Thanks Ball Park!

Pretty good sandwich. I used spinach because I don't care for arugula and I used garlic Sriracha because that's what I have. Really liked the mayo/sriracha sauce. Ball Park Buns are excellent.
