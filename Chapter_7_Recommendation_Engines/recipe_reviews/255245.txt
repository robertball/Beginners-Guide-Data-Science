This is one of the few recipes I make regularly that everyone in my family gets excited about. I make it exactly as directed. As other reviewers have noted, the recipe doesn’t specify what to do with the chicken. It works well to cut it into small cubes and throw it in the crockpot raw, along with the other ingredients. Make sure you drain the corn and the beans. Then cook everything in the crockpot on low for about 6 hours. There are several good cornbread recipes in this site that go well with it.

Yummy!!  Definitely a keeper.  The recipe didn't specify what to do with the chicken- dice it or leave it whole and then shred it after cooking all day.  I diced it but I think next time I might leave it whole and then shred once cooked through.  My husband says he would have liked a little more heat but that's easy to remedy.

I made this on the stove top using ground chicken. It was phenomenal! I love the taco seasoning as opposed to chili seasoning. I can't wait to serve it to friends and family.

I used ground turkey browned with green chilis, onions, and lots of garlic instead of chicken. Served it with lime flavored tortilla chips. I am a beginning cook and this was so easy and tasty! Everyone had seconds and wanted leftovers the next day.

Followed the recipe exactly. By 10 hours, the chicken Shred so easy with a fork. Didn’t precook the chicken. Used hot Chile peppers and hot taco seasoning. Could have used a bit more heat. Also I topped this with tortilla chips crushed. Delicious. Will make again!

I made subs using Tony Cacheres salt free spice *yummy*  (I use all salt-free spices) and a dash of cumin.  I diced my chicken and added *hold on to your cooking hats* yellow squash in lieu of corn, it was delish! Better for all to digest too as we are of the Senior Persuasion *smiling sweetly*. Next time, I will use more greens too ;-) - perhaps egg plant too?

I was not sure if the beans and corn were to be drained or not, so I drained the corn, but not the beans. I did put the chicken breasts in whole and when it was done I pulled them out and shredded them. I got rave reviews at the chili cook off, so this is a keeper. Next time I will garnish with green onions and maybe add more chili's or a spicier taco season for a little more bite. Over all a great and easy recipe.

I have made this recipe multiple times and nothing ever goes to waste! I have found that if you want to make it a little more spicy, substitute the green chilies with jalapeños. Also, I put my chicken raw, whole, and frozen into the crockpot with the other ingredients and cook on high for 4 hours, then remove the chicken and shred and put back in. It is the best white chicken chili I’ve tried so far and the easiest to make!

The chili was a crowd pleaser at football game party. I followed the recipe as is.  I opted to shred the chicken after it was cooked, and I would do it again the same next time. Chicken fell apart so easily and I had chicken in every bite. Oh, I did add a small chili pepper to add a little kick. That’s just a personal preference though.

Really, really good. I used low sodium organic chicken broth (which, on it’s own, has less flavor than boiling the wax-paper box) and low sodium taco seasoning. This still had amazing flavor.

It was very good, and much easier to make than my usual chicken chili recipe which involves cutting up lots of onions and tends to be too thing.  The recipe doesn't mention dicing the chicken breasts, but that seemed to match the picture, so that's what I did.

Amazing! I cooked and diced the chicken while I got the rest of the ingredients going in a pot. Added extra green chiles cause I accidentally bought a bigger can, doubled the pepper jack, and used perhaps a little less out of the taco seasoning packet. Everything I bought was low sodium. The whole thing simmered for about an hour and a half, about 40 minutes with the chicken. It was freaking tasty! Will absolutely be making again!

Followed the recipe exactly and this chili is awesome. I would classify the “heat” intensity as mild, which is what I prefer. If you prefer more heat, I’d suggest add another can of diced jalapeños, and maybe more pepper jack cheese. I put the chicken breasts in whole and shredded them right before serving. Delicious recipe!

Came out great! I added some chopped jalapenos to give some heat. I used White chicken chili seasoning instead of taco / chili seasoning.

Oh. My. Gosh. This is amazing!! I'm not giving it 5 stars because I changed a couple of things with stuff that I had on hand. I used Ranch Style Beans, rather than Northern Beans. I cut back on the liquids per other reviews. I used yellow corn rather than white. I used diced jalapenos from a jar rather than green chili peppers, and I made my own taco seasoning per this site. Next time I will cut back even more on the liquids, because this turned out a little more soupy than we hoped for. Other than that, this was a winner!

This turned out great!  It was a big hit for my family and they are usually very picky eaters. I was looking for a chili recipe without tomatoes and I found this. I will make it again because it was so easy and good. I used white hominy and only one can of white beans and used a homemade taco seasoning found on AllRecipes.

Good flavors in here but as others have said it's a bit on the soupy side for chili. I used frozen chicken breasts and they shredded easily after 8 hours on low. I drained the corn and beans before putting them in. The only changes I made were to add some hot peppers and in an attempt to thicken things up a bit I threw in a can of black beans toward the end. This is an easy-to-make comfort food that made the house smell wonderful to come home to. Just don't expect the texture of traditional chili.

This is pretty good chili!  I used three chicken breasts and shredded them and I used a recipe for taco seasoning from this site rather than buying the prepackaged stuff.  It’s a keeper!

Yes, it's awesome just as it's written.  I put about 2 1/4 lbs  of chicken breast in the recipe and didn't have to adjust any of the other ingredients.  Made it ample for 4 -5 people.  Also used 1 fresh diced green pepper instead of canned green chilies and it added color and texture and still tasted Mexican. Everyone Loved it !

Super simple, I added a onion, diced. I would add 1 more can of diced chiles for a little more kick.  Other than that it was excellent.

Easy to make.  I accidentally bought cream style white corn so I put that in, but it made it too soupy, so I got another can of white corn to add too.  It was good with both in it.  I just added the pepper jack cheese on top instead of melting in the crock pot.  I used hot and spicy taco seasoning and it wasn't too spicy.  And I just shredded the chicken after 8 hours (2 on high and then 6 on low).

We liked this recipe a lot--it was rich and tasty. I added a can of petite diced tomotoes and served the soup with Fritos. Next time, I think I will try substituting plain, Greek yogurt for the sour cream, to save on calories. This is unconventional "chili," but do not be deterred by that. It is very delicious and easy to prepare.

The recipe is great as written - don't change a thing. Someone said it had too much liquid - drain the northern bean and white corn and it is great!

This was fabulous, I did make my own taco seasoning (from a random recipe on this site). Only minimal changes made to suit our spicy taste preference.

Easy and delicious!! I drained the beans and the corn. I also left the sour cream and cheese out. We topped our bowls individually as we liked. Add some tortilla strips for some extra crunch and flavor.

So easy to throw together if you remember to defrost chicken the night before.  Mine was maybe a little wetter than expected since I cut up the chicken whilst still frozen .   There’s another white chicken chili on this app that my husband prefers.  It’s also fast and doesn’t require the corn or the soup, but pretty easy to make and not a slow cooker recipe (fwiw).

My family loved it !
They added their own hot pepper flakes to customize their heat.
Tips: I drained my beans but didn’t drain the corn. Ultimately it worked out because I had a bit more chicken and so I cracked the lid for some steam to escape and after shredding all the chicken at the end it was very thick. Very hearty and we ate it all !!!
I will be making it again and again !

What I made was really delicious.   I took note of the use of ranch beans from one rating and using Rotel tomatoes with chili from another.  Didn’t add the additional can of green chilies.  Love the use of taco seasoning instead of chili powder.

Only change I made was a shake of cayenne to liquid ingredients before pouring on the chicken.  Served on scoops, shredded cheese and more sour cream. Very hard not to overeat! I forced myself to stop after two bowls! First white chili I've ever made but I'll be making it regularly going forward.

Added one small yellow pepper and one small orange pepper. This was delicious! I actually wound up making it again a week later because everyone requested it on our first snow day of year. I subbed Chicken Taco seasoning instead of the regular taco seasoning and it was even better.

Amazing!! This chili was such a BIG hit with the family. I followed the recipe exactly but added a few extra ingredients: 1 white onion, 1tbsp fresh garlic, and an extra cup of pepper jack cheese. I cut my chicken up into cubes too. I will be making this again for sure!

Despite using a Chipotle Taco Seasoning packet and hot green chiles plus onion, celery, and garlic, this was just blah-bland. .

I re-seasoned with cumin, more garlic and added chili powder. Much improved.

Great results.  I made it with 1 can of northern bean & 1 can of spicy pinto beans.  Also, I used 1 regular taco seasoning and 1 hot taco seasoning.   Just right.

It was great and pretty simple!  I used 1 can of black beans and 1 can of northern beans.  Also, Aldi didn't have green chilis so I cut up 1/2 orange bell pepper.  It is wonderful!!!! Yummy!

I made this tonight for dinner and it was wonderful.  I placed the chicken breast whole on the bottom and then shredded it once the time had elapsed.  My husband was surprised, it wasn't what he expected.  He suggested using the left overs to make chicken enchiladas, would require draining off some of the sauce, but I'm thinking that could be thickened and used on top.   Will definitely make again.

Really yummy chili. Wish I would've read the reviews first though, as others have mentioned it is rather soupy.  I took about half cup of the soupy part and added a tablespoon of corn starch, whisked until smooth and added it back to the crock pot. That helped , but next time I would only use 1 cup of chicken broth.  It's good with tortilla chips!

Excellent, kept going back for more.  Consistency was not soupy.  Flavor was very good, could see benefit of adding heat if you like spicier dishes.  Will definitely make again.
Didn't dice chicken
Did drain beans and corn
Added 1/2 can of cream of celery
Used 1/2 of taco seasoning packet
Added 1/2 tsp smoked sweet paprika

My husband absolutely loves it!! He asks me to make this once a week and he'll eat on it for at least a few days for dinner and maybe even for lunches once I get a thermos for him. I  changed it up just a bit. My husband loves a good soup, so I add more broth and sometimes a good beer. I add a couple of chopped serrano peppers and use my owe seasonings (crushed pepper flakes, cumin, chili powder, cayenne, onion and garlic powder, oregano, paprika, salt and pepper) instead of the packet of taco seasoning. We love it! Thank you for sharing your recipe!

Oh. My. Gosh. So good. I made it for a movie night and it was a huge hit! I made a double batch and we had just a couple servings left over. It will be on my permanent dinner rotation now.

Really easy recipe. I subbed white chicken chili mix for the taco season, drained juice off all canned veggies, drained juice off chili once finished and added another 1/2 cup

Great recipe that was super easy to make! I used roasted chicken strips and they were perfect. I wasn’t sure if I would like the corn but it added crunch and a slight sweetness which was a break from the heat. Do-over!!

This is taco soup, not chili.  It tastes nothing like chili.  If you want an easy recipe that's somewhere between canned soup and homemade food this is a good option.  It's quite edible but that distinctive canned soup taste lingers.  If you're expecting the goodness and flavor depth of homemade chili you'll be sorely disappointed.

I used frozen chicken thighs, omitted the white corn and substituted another can great Northern beans (3 total). I cooked it on low in the slow cooker for 7-8  hours (or high for 4 hours), removed the chicken thighs and shredded with two forks before returning to the slow cooker. Delicious with a fresh, tossed green salad, home-made cornbread with butter, and glasses of icy milk. Easy and quick to prepare. I use frozen chicken thighs as I always have several in a bag in the freezer, and it's faster this way. Works well with frozen breasts, too. Adjust time as needed and cut the cooked breasts in cubes before returning to cooker.  I always keep on hand enough ingredients for two recipes, so I'll be able to make it whenever the whim strikes...which is often,  as everybody loves it!

One of our new staples! I make it as instructed, except for the cheese (I use cheddar or Monterey Jack). On the stove, slow cooker, or Instant Pot - any way you choose to make it will be fantastic!

Literally changed nothing and it was a HUGE hit. I only bought “mild” items though to be better for my toddler. EASY EASY EASY, and will be made many times in the future :)

This was really easy to make and was perfect for a snowy day! I drained the beans and corn. I placed whole chicken breasts (uncooked) at the bottom of my slow cooker and used a shredder/separater tool to shred it up in the slow cooker. Very filling and yummy!

We really enjoyed the taste of this. It might be a little to tacoy, (I know that's not a word). I added more chili powder. I also made the mistake of adding to much liquid, which I then had to thicken, otherwise than that.....Delicious.

I just made this tonight for my family. Amazing! It just had enough kick to please everyone.
I made it with The Roasted Rotisserie Chicken from Kroger instead of cooking chicken breast. I pulled all the chicken from the bone and then used my handheld blender to shred it. 
Will be making this again soon!!

It was easy and delicious...if you like a little kick to your chili I would suggest cayenne pepper...after I added the sour cream and cheese it went from a thick consistency to runny...I may try to not add the sour cream just cheese

Won't make this again. I doubled the recipe but thought the chicken soup made it too thick. Also tried using Instant Pot and it could not reach pressure so I cooked it way too long without pressure.

Made it just like the directions said except I increased all by 50% to get more servings.  I threw out half the water the Northern beans were packed in and wish I'd thrown it all out.  Was WAY too soupy.  I also threw out all of the water the corn was packed in but still had this problem.  I drained a quart of liquid out of this mess  (which I'll save for a pasta sauce of some sort) yet was still too soupy.  Taste was ok.  Entered it in a chili competition and finished in middle of pack.  Wont' be making it again

I really enjoyed this chili. We substituted some things because we used what we had on our shelves. Used green chili enchilada sauce instead of green chilis, left over chicken, navy and great beans, and added some zucchini and yellow squash. Turned out very yummy even still! Definitely needs more time than 1-2 hours in the croc pot. Had to put it in the stove to let the zucchini and squash cook through. The kiddos (4 & 2) loved it! Will definitely be making again. Maybe with corn bread. :)

I made this for a large (10-12) group, increasing the ingredients accordingly.   Even before presenting it for the meal,  I had to make a second batch, because, there was no way the finished chili was going to feed everyone .  Also, the first batch was way too thin, more like a soup than a stew/chili,  so I drastically reduced the amount of liquid for making the broth (I use the compacted, add water type), and combined the two batches.  After that, everything else was ok - my group really liked it.  Now that I know to not add any extra liquid, this will be five stars.

This is definitely my go to for chili!  The only difference is I would chop jalapeño or pablano peppers to add on top of sour cream!!   I made supreme corn muffins to go along with it and bellies were filled!

So after reading the notes I realized I should try to add some more spice. Totally overcompensated and was worried we were going to chug milk all meal long. I added hot green chili’s, diced jalapeños and used half spicy taco seasoning and half regular.

When making this recipe, I didn't realize at first it was a slow cooker recipe. I made it on the stove top, from start to finish it was ready to eat in about and hour. Served it with fresh baked corn bread. My family loved it. Will definitely be making this again.

This was so good that I literally licked the bowl.  I think it was the cream of chicken soup, sour cream and cheese that put it over the top!  I adjusted it to my instapot, so it cooked up quickly and I added some fresh cilantro.  Definitely one to make during the cold months.  Yum!!!

Pretty good! We found the corn to be distracting, would add onions instead next time.

I had read that most people felt it needed a little more heat, but didn’t want it to be too hot. I used one original taco seasoning and added about 1 tablespoon of the hot and spicy taco seasoning. Everyone I had for dinner loved it and said the heat was just right. I cooked the chicken and shredded it.

The family loved it! I have made another white chicken chili recipe before, but it was too spicy for the kids and grandparents. This one is mild. I used chicken thigh meat because that is what I had in hand. Everything else was as written.

This is so delicious! I cooked and diced  my chicken first. I only added 1/2 of the taco seasoning but added 1 teaspoon cumin.I also added 1 can of butter beans. I cooked everything together in crock pot on high for about 4 hours while I was gone and it was ready so it may cook in less time. My kids loved it too, it's not too spicy, it's so good, I will make it again

This was very tasty!   My husband is asking when I am making it again.  I roasted a whole chicken and  once cooled, shredded most -used about 1/-2-3/4 of it.   We like beans so I added one more can of white beans.  I  did not have time for the crock- pot slow-cooker thing and just used my Dutch Oven on the stove top still turned out great!

I give this 5 stars because this won my neighborhood’s chili cook-off. I cooked on low with frozen chicken and drained the liquid from it and shredded the chicken. I added more seasoning to it - called “Chicken ” which made it more salty and delicious.

Made this recipe for the first time and it was absolutely delicious. However, I made a few additions to my liking to make it perfect for my family and I. I decided to season and boil the chicken instead of slow-cooking it, using the same prep for the rest of the recipe. I will be making this again.

I made this today for my church group of 11 people and it was absolutely delicious!!  It scores an A in my book because it was SO easy to prep.  Everyone said it was fantastic!  I will definitely be adding this in my rotation.  I adjusted the servings for 15 people and it was still nearly gobbled up.  I had extra shredded cheese and sour cream on the side as well as some chips to add a satisfying crunch.  YUM!!!
