Oh Wow! Really a divine confection! If you are intimidated by this recipe, watch the accompanying video. Made a pourable version to top Marty Fries' Tiramisu Cheesecake on this site.
SUGGESTIONS/SUBSTITUTIONS: To make this recipe pourable, test the temp of the chocolate mixture with a (clean) finger. When it feels neither hot nor cold to the touch fold in the whipped cream - instead of waiting until it's room temperature. Also, because I didn't have any rum/wine on hand, I used chocolate liqueur instead. Chef John is an amazing teacher - entertaining AND thorough.

This is really good.  I might've made the coffee a bit too strong, so I won't make it as strong next time.  Also replaced the marsala with brandy.  Used the mousse as frosting for chocolate cupcakes.  Absolutely incredible!  Filled the cupcakes with cream cheese mousse (4 oz of cream cheese at room temperature, 1/4 c powdered sugar, 3/4 tsp vanilla extract, 1/2 c chilled heavy cream.  Beat the cream cheese, sugar and vanilla until light and fluffy. Beat the heavy cream in another bowl until peaks form. Fold whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture. Cover and refrigerate for at least an hour.)

I made this for an italian themed dinner party and everyone loved it! I didn't have any masala or rum so I used frangelico instead. I also served the dessert with a glass of frangelico & freshly squeezed lime on the rocks and it worked perfectly. I definitely recommend this one - delicious!!! :)

This was good, but to me, even though I love Tiramisu, not as good as other non-tiramisu chocolate mousse recipes I've tried. Turned out to be neither quite Tiramisu nor quite chocolate mousse instead of the wonderful combination I had been hoping for. But that's of course a matter of taste.

This was very good and pretty easy. I didn't pipe it into glasses because a. mine was a little too liquid for that before chilling and b. I did not want to leave any chocolatey deliciouness behind in the pastry bag. Ha!

Made it according to the recipe but used a cafe rum inplace of the espresso and Marsala wine. HIGHLY recommend watching the video to understand how to cook the eggs without scrambling or curdling them.
It was a huge hit, served with ladyfingers.

The only change I made was that I cooked the egg yolks and the marsala over a double boiler, similar to a sabayon - this made the mixture thicker .  All in all - a major hit!

I may have taken a wrong turn on this recipe but it did not turn out like a mousse.   It was more like a pudding.  I wonder it I used the wrong type of chocolate.   I will try it again.

I made it according to directions, but will not make it again. It is eatable, but not great.
