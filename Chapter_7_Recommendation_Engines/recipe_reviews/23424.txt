Very good.  Next time I will heat the cranberries and oj, then let it cool.  This should help to get more orange flavor into the cookie.

I like the combination of chocolate and cranberries, but while some recipes are too sweet and others border on health food, this recipe is just right. Yummy. White chocolate gives a subtle sweetness to these cookies, but I think dark chocolate chips (semisweet are OK) best complement the orange flavored cranberries and thus create a bigger wow factor. I use the Ghirardelli cocoa chips - when on sale - which are extra large and also make the cookies slightly larger  so that the chocolate isn't overpowering. Time saving tip: Buy packaged orange flavored cranberries. Trader Joe's sells an 8 oz bag for the reasonable price of $2.00 (and the leftover cranberries make a tasty midday snack at work.) Thanks for the great recipe! Not only are they a family favorite, but they also make a great gift for the winter holidays.

These were delicious -- I substituted chopped dark chocolate for the white chocolate, threw in some raisins (because I didn't have enough cranberries), and left the dried fruits to stew in the warmed orange juice for closer to an hour.  I left them in the oven for a little longer, maybe more like 15 minutes, because they seemed especially gooey.  (That may be because I used margarine (ew) instead of butter.)  

Oh -- I also threw in some flax seed for good measure and a bit of oat cereal that I wanted to get rid of, so mine were a bit crunchy, but I like that.

I also warmed the OJ and it made a stronger orange flavor in the cookies. They needed to bake for about 12-14 mins, probably because the dough was a bit moist from the OJ.  Overall - very delicious cookies and quick to prepare. I will make these again for sure!

These are good. I substituted 1/2 c whole wheat flour for all-purpose and used semi-sweet chocolate chips. The were fabulous when they came out of the oven, but didn't keep as well as some other cookies. The only thing I would change next time is to either make more dough or reduce the extras (cranberries, chocolate chips). The ratio wasn't quite right.

I need to confess that I forgot the orange juice step, I think they would be even better with that.  However, I liked these a lot.  I used fresh cranberries (since I needed to use them up) and dark chocolate chips.  They looked gorgeous with the bright red cranberries. The taste was very good, not amazing, though I’m sure the orange flavor would help.  The ratio could be a little off, or maybe it’s because I used fresh cranberries, but I needed to cook them longer as well, they were very gooey, even though the batter appeared a bit dry.,

Delicious! I should  broken apart the clumps of cranberries. Great taste! It needed longer to bake, maybe didn't drain/squeeze all the juice out?

Bland and boring, even using dark chocolate instead of white.

I am in love with these cookies! I too heated the cranberries with the oj and they came out moist and flavorful. Added toasted chopped almonds to balance the creaminess of the white chocolate and to add bit of crunch. Wonderful.
