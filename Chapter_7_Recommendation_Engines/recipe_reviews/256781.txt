Drizzled over crispy tots along with shredded mozzarella, it was a hit!

Wow, this dip took a batch of French fries over the top!  I served this with burgers on the grill, and my family was licking their plates, the gravy dip was that good!

Four stars for ease. It seemed a bit rich for me, but the over all flavors were really good. We'll make this one again.

Tasty dip similar to poutine and easy to make too.  I served with waffle fries for easier dipping.
