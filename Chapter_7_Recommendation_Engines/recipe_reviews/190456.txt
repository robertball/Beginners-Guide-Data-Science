You can substitute strawberries, but I found that it needed a cup less water, which made it sweeter.  Use your discretion.  But works just fine as the recipe states.. just makes more sorbet!

YUMMY!  I made this recipe for tonight's dessert.  I followed the recipe except for the freezing.   Since I didn't have 6 hours for it to freeze, I froze it for an hour to get it cold, then put it into my ice cream machine.  The end result was a yummy raspberry sorbet.  Thank you Toasted Garlic for sharing your recipe.

This recipe is very refreshing! I only made a few changes. I used frozen raspberries, the juice of 1 lime, used less honey and increased the sugar to 1 cup. I did use my ice cream maker - 45 minutes and it was perfect. My 6 year old did not like the seeds so I strained a batch for her and she was happy.

So delicious, but added lime juice after I froze and scooped it. Its the perfect summer recipe especially if you don't have an ice cream machine!

Excellent. Followed recipe; strained out the seeds. Half the batch was frozen in freezer. This creates more ice crystals although stirring it up brings it back to a slushy consistency. Other half refrigerated over night and made using an ice cream machine. In the future, prefer making this in an ice cream machine as the texture is noticeably smoother with the entire batch having the same consistency.

Have to freeze in 9x13  so it freezes evenly.  Strawberries work well with one less cup water.  Freeze in 9x13 for 6-8 hrs and then re-run through food processor. Freeze 2 more hours.
