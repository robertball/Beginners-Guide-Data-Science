I was highly disappointed with this recipe, and I followed it to a T. There's something off about the instructions - the marinade isnt actually a marinade, but a watery mix of seasonings, pineapple, etc.  Then you're supposed to pour it all into a skillet and cook it. Well, the sauce/marinade doesnt evaporate well, and the chicken surely doesnt brown,  and adding cornstarch doesnt help much.  I think the recipe provider should take a hard look and make sure this is correct.

My family loved this!  I doubled the recipe, as I had family from out of town visiting, and I found the broth cooked down too far at first.  So I added more ginger ale, then some chicken broth, then I thickend it with the corn starch.  I served this over brown jasmine rice I found at Trader Joe's, and I did substitute splenda for the sugar to make it a little healthier.  Finally, I realized I was out of fresh ginger, so I ended up substituting 2 tsp. of ground ginger, and it was perfect.

Tried this tonight and was very disappointed.  Extremely bland flavoring.  We ended up adding soy sauce, chinese hot mustard, onions 
for flavor.

We will definitely add this recipe to our rotation. It turned out great. The chicken was a little dry but next time I would cut the chicken strips a little larger so it doesn't overcook by the time the liquid is gone. Also I cooked it about 30 minutes instead of 25. I can see how the liquid would not evaporate if cooked on low heat. I left it on medium high for the duration and left it uncovered. Next time I will add more pineapple and less coconut.

It was good, but I felt that it was a bit bland. Maybe I wasn't doing it right.

The dish had good base flavours but needs to be kicked up a bit.   Maybe up the spices? 

If I do this one again I would brown the chicken first before adding the veggies and fruit.
