Excellent and SO easy! I used bratwurst sausage and used 1/2 bag of large shelled pasta and mixed it all together and served it with salad. Yum!

Couldn't be easier and the results were fantastic. I didn't slice the links, but cut them into 2 inch chunks so we could have these on sandwiches. Because of this the sausage took longer to cook. Thanks for this simple recipe!

Just what I was looking for as a quick and easy meal for the whole family. Luckily I had all the ingredients right in my fridge. Husband wolfed it down and the 2-yr old loved it too.  Thanks for a great recipe!

My husband cooks this.  He used regular flavored Ragu and then serves it in a sub bun.  He cooks the peppers and onions in the sauce until they are tender.  We love it

Excellent recipe!  Very tasty!  I used turkey sausage to make it healthier.   I served it with penne pasta because there was a lot of tomato sauce.

I had this same recipe several years ago from Classico pasta sauces.  Try making this same recipe but with Classico's Sausage and Pepper sauce.  It ties the flavors together really well.  My husband proposed to me the first night I made this so I like to joke that it was the food that motivated him. =)

This was very good and so simple to make. I served this with penne pasta and topped with dollops of goat cheese which made it "wow!" A big hit and my bachelor son asked for the recipe.:}Thanks.

Hubs requested sausage and peppers so I selected this recipe.  I used hot Italian turkey sausage and after cooking I cut it crosswise into chunks.  I didn’t want to lose the vibrant color of the peppers (I used a combination of red, green, yellow and orange) so I sautéed those along with the onions and removed them from the pan.  When it was time for dinner, I just threw everything in together and heated it up.  I meant to add a glug of white wine, but forgot!  Darn!  Served over penne pasta and Hubs was a happy man!

Another 5 star recipe on AllRecipes.com in my opinion! This was so hearty and delicious- tasted like a real comfort food. I used Ragu brand roasted garlic and herb sauce, since the store didnt have tomato basil kind- and I added fresh basil and extra garlic cloves the sauce myself. I used a mix of hot and sweet italian sausages and cut them into 1 inch pieces after browning, then threw them in the pan with the sauce and vegetables to finish cooking. I served this on large asiago cheese dinner rolls. What an amazing dish! Will definately make this again, and try it with penne pasta also =)

Excellent and easy to whip together.  I, too, used turkey sausage and Classico Italian Sausage sauce and it turned out fantastic.  I served it over rice instead of pasta and it was a hit!

My boyfriend loved this when I made it.  He is so not a cook, but I left the recipe with him and told him it was really easy.  Clearly it was, because he sometimes makes it on his own and his daughter loves it too

I'm not sure what I did wrong, but my sausage didn't end up cooking all the way.  It turned out fine, I just popped it in the microwave for a few minutes to finish the cooking.  Either way, it was a super yummy, easy dish!

Pretty much what I expected...I spiced it up with some chile flakes....I actually liked this better as leftovers the next day after flavors fully melded.  Definitely serve over pasta.

Supergood! Served with kaiserbuns, and they were a huge hit with my hubby.
