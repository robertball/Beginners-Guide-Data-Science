I added about 1.5 tsp of liquid smoke to the recipe and used apple cider vinegar instead of wine vinegar.  It was really tasty and easy.

I took the advice of the previous reviewer and added liquid smoke and replaced the red wine vinegar with Apple cider vinegar.  However I only added about a teaspoon of the liquid smoke (I'm not a big fan of it) and I browned the pork on all sides in a pan with  extra virgin olive oil.  It turned out REALLY good, especially if you add Sweet Baby Ray Honey BBQ sauce to the sandwich.

Easy delicious. Loved the vinegar tang and that there wasn't a lot of tomato taste - different than most pulled pork

Very easy to make great Carolina vinegar taste, I substituted the wine vinegar with apple cider vinegar, turned out very good.

I made this recipe on a whim because I had all the ingredients for it. My husband likes the fact it's tangy and sweet, but not too sweet. I don't tend to like slow-cooker pulled pork because it's too wet for me, but everyone else liked it fine. We've eaten it for several meals now. It makes quite a lot.

I made it as written. The pork came out very tender, but lacked flavor. It could be partially because I used more than 2 pounds of meat. I am considering making more vinegar based "sauce" to add to our sandwiches, like you would find at a true NC picnic.

Very easy and the meat was nice and tender but it just didn't have much flavor. I won't make it again unless I make some modifications.

This was so easy and delicious! My husband was skeptical and suggested that I add BBQ sauce. I convinced him to try it first before he added any sauce and he loved it!  We will definitely make this again!!

Made this for the family and they devoured it ! I don’t have any left overs either. I used the apple cider vinegar as a few people said instead of the red wine vinegar. I don’t use the liquid smoke.

This is the absolute best and easiest pulled pork recipe I have ever used.  It's the only way I will ever make pulled pork again and everyone I have made it for loves it.

Made it just as stated.  It was a real crowd pleaser.  Made  it for Superbowl  party.  I never eat much for dinner and I ate two sandwiches.  I went to school in North Carolina and this one is a winner. IT is not Eastern Carolina but it is just a really good flavor sensation.  . Will definitely make it again.

Used this recipe to make BBQ pulled rabbit. Didn't have red wine vinegar, so I substituted cider vinegar. Had to double the sauce measurements to make enough. Also, added 1/2 red onion and additional brown sugar. When it was all done , drained excess fluid and coated with three lil pigs BBQ sauce and put on an egg onion roll. It was really good. Next time I would like to try the red wine vinegar and see if/how that changes the taste.

I added 1 package of Taco seasoning rubbed all over pork.  My guests enjoyed as sandwiches. It would make good & easy tacos.
