This is one of those "out-of-this-world" dishes.  The combination of ingredients is so different!  I also like the versatility -- we had it as a hot side dish with Banana Meatloaf, but I can easily see putting the prepared banana pieces in the freezer until serving time, then using the sauce as a dip.  This is definitely worth a try!

I started out making it like the recipe calls for, but then I decided to do my own thing to it and put the 1/3 cup of peanut butter in with the sauce and just a splash of maple syrup... poured it over the bananas with peanut butter and it was pretty good.  My daughter had two helpings of it... The peanut butter sauce was more like a peanut butter fudge...but not set up.

I haven't made this yet, but my grandmother used to make a Banana/Peanut salad. You might try mixing the Peanut Butter in the sauce, and then LAYER it along with chopped peanuts over sliced bananas.

It wasn't quite what i expected. The vinigar was extremely strong. Maybe if there wasn't so much vinigar it would be good. Still it was very interesting.

This is an interesting dish.  It wasn't "bad" but after a couple bites I had enough of the sauce.  I ended up wasting practically all of the sauce this recipe makes.  I won't be making it again-but do give it a try and see if you like the sauce yourself.

This recipe is wonderful.  I love vinegar and the combination with the sweet bananas and the peanut butter...I made it for my toddler (she also enjoyed it) but found myself eating more than I had intended.  I substituted apple cider vinegar for the white vinegar and it was great.

It may sound weird, but it really tastes good!  My whole family loves it.  It is a great side dish to those casseroles that have "everything" in them!  I highly recommend it!

This was interesting.  I made it as a side dish, but it should probably be a snack or dessert.  It's got an interesting flavor and might be good over some angel food cake, but was strange all by itself.

Hmmm, not sure I'm totally on board with this one.  If I make it again, I'll cut the vinegar in half because that's what I wasn't really wild about.  I love sweet-sour combos, but this just didn't completely work for me.  It's fun, it's pretty, it's different, it's fast, and those are all good things.
