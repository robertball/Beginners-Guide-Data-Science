4.29.17  I baked these on a rack over a foil-lined baking sheet, so as they were cooking, the fat from the sausage drained, rather than having the egg sit in a little puddle of grease on the parchment paper.  Sitting on the rack, the egg cooked all over, so there’s no need to turn every 10 minutes either.  I used Italian Panko Crumbs (what I had on hand), and I think a little salt mixed into the crumbs prior to breading would be a nice addition.  One tip when you’re wrapping the sausage around the hard boiled egg is to keep your hands wet, so you can get the egg completely covered more easily.  These are baked, so they’re healthier than the traditional deep fried Scotch egg, so they’ll never brown up or look quite as appealing.  BUT they still taste delicious.  Served with Mustard Cream Sauce from this site.  Thumbs up from us!

I was only able to use 6 hard boiled eggs with 1 lb of sausage. I rolled out the sausage between 2 sheets of parchment paper to ~1/8" thickness. Then made up a mixture of 2 tbls prepared horseradish and 3 cloves of garlic minced and mashed, and spread that over the sausage. They came out great! With the extra heat I made up some mustard cream sauce (also on this site) and both of us loved them!
