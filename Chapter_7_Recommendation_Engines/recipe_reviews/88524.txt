I love banana milkshakes like these but I modify this recipe a little bit to suit my preferences.  I made just one serving by using 3/4 cup of milk, 1 banana, and ice.  I don't add the sugar but sometimes to make it a bit more sweet I'll add 1 packet of Splenda.  This is a great basic recipe to play with though.  Thank you mary!

Yummy. Instead of using ice cubes I used one frozen banana,one cup of milk and one tablespoon of sugar and blended till smooth. I also use other frozen fruits like strawberries,blueberries or plums.

The recipie was delicious. I however, did not use ice cubes. It worked perfectly. (To make sure that the milkshake is cold, use cold milk) My friends loved it!!! (and so did I)

If you're looking for a strong banana taste this is not the recipe for you.  This didn't taste bad - but it was kind of like drinking thick, foamy, slightly sweet milk.

These are the best. I have played with this a lot it is very versatile. I use NO ice cubes but frozen peeled bananas instead. Approx- 2 bananas, 1 & 1/2- 2 cups milk, blend. I have added vanilla, pumpkin pie spice and even chocolate syrup to make different shakes. My family loves them a keeper, thanks

My family simply loved this recipe.  I modified the recipe, though.  I used frozen bananas as in one of reviewers' modification.  I used 

1 frozen banana + 1 cup of cold milk + 1 TB sugar + 1/2 ts vanilla extract.

It was good enough for 2 cups + baby-cup.  It seems a little bit sugary but I am going to keep 1 TB for sugar.

This is tasty, but it is hardly a milkshake. The large quantity of milk makes it more of a sweet, banana-flavored milk drink instead of a milkshake.

Very tasty! I used 3 cups of milk, 8 ice cubes, and a 1/4 cup of Altern (Wal-mart brand Splenda). I recommend using cinnamon. Add a little and then taste it. Add more as you see fit.

Instead of 5 cups, I used 3 1/2 cups of milk, and i used 1 tbsp less of sugar and it was less liquidy and a little bit less sweet. it was great!

Thank you Mary for this recipe. This was delicious, I made it for my grandson who is 6 yrs old and he is an authority on bananas, absolutely loves them.  He gave this recipe the thumbs up. Every time he visits I have to have some ready for him.

Mmmm!! I love this! I babysit a three year old every Sunday, and when she wakes up from her nap she always wants a snack. And she loved it! I even added a spoon full of Nutella in while blending, and it was delicious!:) Thanks for the Recipe!:):):)

This recipe is AMAZING! It tastes EXACTLY like a milkshake, it's very good. I halved the recipe because I only had one banana. I used a frozen banana instead of using the ice cubes, and I also added a 1/2 tsp of vanilla. Mmmmmmmm! So good! Thanks.

Tasty. 5 cups won't fit in my blender though--3 was the best I could do, and I think I have a pretty standard blender. I used ice cubes made of milk, and replaced all the sugar with Splenda. I also added a few extras that we like in milkshakes/smoothes (namely, yogurt and wheat germ). I also refrigerated my bananas for about 4 hours. The result was tasty, but not particularly thick. I think next time I will either use more milk cubes, or freeze my fruit. Thanks!

I give this only 3 stars because the recipe as written was not that good-- too watery, not enough banana flavor. Tweaking using reviewers' suggestions, though, I got *great* results. I used two bananas, 1 c. milk, a scant Tbsp. of sugar, and about 1/2 c. crushed ice. Yum!!

I'm giving this 4 stars because it is a great base recipe, but it does need to be tweaked a bit.  I used Marian R's suggestion of 1 frozen banana, 1 cup milk and 1 tbsp sugar, and that turned out very tasty!!  If you like more sugar, feel free to add more, but it really doesn't need as much as the recipe calls for.

I had over ripe bananas on hand and didn't want to toss them out, so I came across this recipe.  Not a bad recipe.  I varied it a little -- I used 3 over ripe bananas, 2 cups of milk, about 8 ice cubes and 12 packets of Splenda.  It's pretty tasty -- something quick and easy.  If I have over ripe bananas on hand again, I'd  make this again.

yum. Used old bananas - extras from banana bread making and it made it so much more flavorful. Also, added less milk and more ice.

Good, basic recipe.  I modified it and did 1-serving, using, a cup of crushed ice, 2/3 cup of fat free milk, 1 banana, 2 packets of Splenda, one scoop of vanilla protein powder, and a squirt of chocolate syrup.  REALLY GOOD POST-WORKOUT SNACK!

This milk shake has great taste and easy to make. The only thing that could be work on is the density. This is about the same thickness as milk.

Very delicious recipe, I didn't use as much milk and instead used a little more banana for a thicker tecture. Also it doesn't require nearly as much sugar, I used a little honey and Goji juice instead.

This is a good banana shake recipe to add more ingredients to. You could add chocolate chips, strawberries, orange juice, etc. What I did: I reduced the milk to 2 cups and added 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. Yum!

This is yummy!  I make one serving, so I used 1 cup milk, 1 frozen banana,  1 Tbsp. splenda blend and tossed in some ice cubes...5 or 6 will do it.  Also good with some Light Hershey's syrup if you are in the mood for chocolate.  I will be adding some strawberries and coconut next time for a twist.  I will use this recipe often.  Thank you for sharing!

Delicious.  My first batch came out thinner than I liked; so on the next batch, I eyeballed it and used less ice and milk.

Great basic recipe to work with! The only thing I tweaked was to use maple syrup instead of the sugar (for health reasons). I put in about 4 Aussie tablespoons of the maple syrup. The kids and I just downed this in record time, it's a keeper. Very enjoyable!! Thank you  :o)

I used 3 bananas instead of 2. I could only fit 2 1/2 cups of milk in my blender. The shake was thick & sweet. My husband couldn't believe there wasn't any ice cream in it. He put his in the freezer to make it extra cold before drinking. A big hit.

I adjusted the servings amount to 3, and got a blender full of banana milkshake for 5. Very good though, but I would make one change: cut back on the sugar. It was very sweet, (a little too sweet for me), and I would recommend others to cut back on the sugar as much as needed.

I make this for my daughter a lot, and she loves it. For 1 serving, I use a whole banana and only about 1/2 Tablespoon of sugar or honey. If I use a frozen banana, I omit the ice. If it's her whole breakfast, I omit the sweetner and add a packet of Carnation Instant Breakfast.

This was way too sweet for my tastes. Maybe because our ice cubes are smaller? Great base though!!! Glad it didn't call for ice cream since I had none on hand. We added a bit of Mexican vanilla.

I followed as instructed and the milkshake came out just great! It was rather quick and easy to make it, although I think more bananas should be added to the recipe; mine came out not tasting of bananas as much.

Good basic recipe! Instead of sugar, I followed another reviewer's suggestion and used a packet of instant chocolate pudding mix; I also used 4 cups of milk instead of 5, and added extra ice. My kids loved it!

i like this. it's basic, you can add in some things you like. but there was too much sugar. i'd reduce it and if you have a sweet tooth add in some artificial sweeteners. i added in a dash of powdered ginger and it turned out ok.

overall a good recipe to keep.

Well, mine was too thin, and I didn't want to use all the sugar.

Very good! A great way to use over ripe bananas. I made half the recipe to the "T" and for the other half i added some chocolate syrup... almost like a dirty banana. Both were very yummy.

Not great, though not bad. Used 3 bananas based on other reviews. One of them frozen. Did put in freezer to make it colder.

I loved this recipe. It was very easy and quick to make! I used 3 bananas instead of 2 and used less sugar. It was simply delishish and had just the right amount of sweetness for a dessert or breakfast.

It was a good recipe with a little modifications. I used 2 bananas, 6 frozen strawberries, 3 cups of milk and 2 tablespoons of honey. It must of been good since my fussy kids just gobbled it up. It made 4 servings.
