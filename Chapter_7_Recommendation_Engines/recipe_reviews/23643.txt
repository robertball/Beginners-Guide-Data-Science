These are extremely tasty.  I made them with butter instead of shortening (therefore getting rid of trans-fats) and they were excellent.  I made the whole recipe, and then froze the left-over rolls.  Pop the frozen rolls in the oven for a few minutes, and they taste fresh baked!  This recipe is a definite keeper.

I have won blue ribbons for my yeast breads and have never made anything that even came close to as good as these turned out.

My whole family loved these rolls. I used a smaller pan though and tried putting some in muffin tins. They worked nicely too, but I should have used bigger pieces of dough in them.

I cut this recipe in half. I used my Kitchen Aid mixer to make these rolls. I proofed the yeast with the slightly-cooled scalded milk and sugar for ten minutes, then added the cooled water, shortening, egg, and then gradually added the dry ingredients. I did need just bit more flour than the recipe stated to get it to form into a ball and jump on the bread hook, almost another full cup. I kneaded it in the Kitchen Aid with the dough hook for about five minutes or more. I set it to rise in a greased bowl on my heating pad for an hour, then formed them into rolls and plopped them into greased muffin tins (about a heaping 1/4 cup for each roll?), covered them and set them to rise on my heating pad until they doubled. Right before baking, I lightly brushed them with a little melted butter. 400* for 12 minutes was just right. I ate one right out of the oven and I have to say, I'm not a fan so far. This is not my favorite roll recipe. It was a slow riser and kind of a cranky dough to work with. The rolls have a consistancy of beer bread, which is fine and dandy if that's what you're making, but that's not what I was expecting. Plus, there's almost NO flavor in these rolls at all, aside from salt. I think if I'd used melted butter instead of shortening, I think the outcome would be more favorable. Even brushing them with butter didn't make much of a change. I'm really disappointed. I'm sure these rolls were fabulous for others but not for me. It was just okay.

Wonderful rolls!  I've made this recipe twice now and each time the rolls came out just great. I had to use a bit more flour but I really think that had to do with the weather on the days I made them.  Really a keeper.

I loved these rolls.  I have made many different recipes and this one works out best.  I use almost 1 1/4 cup less flour though.  I found it got to flaky if I added all the flour.  Thanks for the recipe!

I've been looking for a really good roll recipe and I found it.  The first time I made them they turned out great.  My family loved them, but we're used to a little bigger roll.  The second time around I made 16 instead of the 24 and substituted a little whole wheat flour.  They turned out even better.

Very, very good! I made them for a Thanksgiving celebration with friends and everyone raved over them. If they were a touch sweeter, they'd be everything I ever dreamed of in a roll. I divided mine into 18 portions (because someone said that 24 were very small) and they ended up being bigger than I anticipated. Next time I'll make 24 like the recipe says.

They were good rolls, but my kids (4 of them)really didn't gobble them up as I had hoped they would. I am still going to look for that recipe that tastes like my grandma's did. Thanks.

I used whole wheat flour in place of 3 cups of the flour. I also added 1/2 c of flax... the rest, I used white flour. I also replaced the milk with almond milk, and the shortening with olive oil. They were thick, yummy & quite tasty. I served 8, and they were gone by the end of dinner... I make these once a week and only cook them 10 minutes.I freeze the 24, taking out 1 for each person and thaw, heating them at 350 for about 8 minutes before dinner. They go really well with soups, or split in half with jelly.

Excellent and easy!  I used butter instead of shortening, and upped the salt to 2 tsp.  After baking I brushed w/melted butter to make them even yummier.  This will be a standard for many meals from now on.  Many raves from family and friends!

I have had this recipe for over 25 years from a friend's mother and it is the exact duplicate except that the rolls are stuffed before baking with a mixture of ham, bacon and onion.  Just made them 2 days ago.  They are yummy.

I tried to make these for Thanksgiving and didn't really care for them all that much. Some of my aunts and uncles really loved them but others didn't. I thought they were too heavy and the taste of flour over powered them. Not the perfect roll recipe I was looking for.

Wow, these rolls are exactly what I've been craving. They are just like the ones at a wonderful Southern comfort food restaurant I loved. After baking, I brushed the tops with melted butter and coarse Kosher salt. Thank you for sharing the recipe.

Love these rolls.  I make them on a regular basis and freeze large batches.  I make large rolls and slice them in half for hamburgers, I make smaller rolls to eat with lunch and soups.  A versatile recipe.

This recipe was my first successful attempt at making bread by hand.  I used butter instead of shortening and it could be why, but I found the buns to be very flavorless, even buttered.  Very easy to make but taste like they are missing something to me.

I made 1/2 recipe for Thanksgiving and used my bread machine to mix and knead the dough.  Just dumped all the ingredients into the pan and turned it on.  I then baked them in the oven at 350% for 8-10 minutes.  This made 12 rolls.  The rolls were soft and flavorful with a wonderful taste and texture.  This is the recipe that I've been searching for.  Excellent!

I'v used this recipe so many time because everyone raves over the rolls. There isn't anything in any store to compare to these. It is my #1 most requested food at gatherings. If you've never made them, at LEAST try it once, they are excellent. It does take a few hours (waiting mostly) for dough to rise, but well worth every minute. Thanks GrannyRob for making me such at hit at something I'd never done before, (making rolls that is). Thanks for submitting the recipe!!!

This bread has a somewhat biscuit texture to it. My husband and I love using it for eggs on toast.

The rolls had a nice look to them but that's about it. They were very bland to me, even when I put butter on top while they were cooling. Next time I think I'll use less flour and put some cinnamon and a little more sugar to give it some kind of taste.

Very good rolls, but didn't have the yeast taste I was wanting.  It was still very very good though

I've never made rolls before. I didn't have all the right equipment (told hubby I need a  kitchenaid)and it still came out pretty well. I will make it again with the kitchenaid of course!

I made homemade yeast rolls for the very first time and it was very easy and Awesome.  I will never buy store bought again if I have the time to make these!

This is a wonderful roll recipe that was extremly easy to prepare. I prepared this for Thankgsgiving Day and these rolls were a raving hit! I followed the recipe to a T except I covered with clingy plastic wrap instead of damp cloth during the risings. They came out perfect! Thanks Grannyrob for sharing your scrumptious recipe!

We love both ways with butter or with shortening,  this is just our absolutely must have dinner rolls!  No changes aside from the butter substitution occasionally.  Thanks much!!!

I made these for the first time today. I rarely bake bread let alone buns. Even though I goofed up while making the dough they still turned out soft and yummy! Love this recipe.

I made no substitutions. I microwaved the milk instead of cooking on the stove top. I used butter flavored shortening. These were the best rolls I’ve ever made! They were a big hit at our Thanksgiving Day dinner. Thank you sooo much!

These rolls were very bland, and despite the sugar and yeast, didn't taste of either. I'll stick with my own recipe next time.

Thank you very much for this recipe, I made a batch divided and made with half of the recipe sticky buns with a topping of some melted cream cheese and confectionarssugar, they were a treat just like the rolls.
Will make lots more of delicious things with this recipe.

hi! this is my 5th time making a baked good using yeast. and these came out great! they took a little longer to rise and cook for me but they were still tasty! if you make these you MUST eat them with butter! youll never buy rolls from the store again!
