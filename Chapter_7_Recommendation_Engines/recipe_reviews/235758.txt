This was really good, we also have used other types of cookies and graham crackers. So much easier than traditional cannoli

I double the cream cheese in this recipe.  Gives it so much more flavor.  Always a crowd pleaser!

When I make it again I would leave out the cream cheese, didn't taste like the cannoli I get from Italian Bakeries.
