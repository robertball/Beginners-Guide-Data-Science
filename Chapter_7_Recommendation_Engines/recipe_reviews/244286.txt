I made these with Kirkland Signature plain greek yogurt. They take a long time to cook on low heat, and even after a while they will remain mushy and gooey inside. I dumped Aunt Jemima syrup overtop to make up for a lack of sweetness, but it was still just mediocre. This could be a great base recipe, but needs a lot of changing. I may try this again with additions.

My picky kids and picky kids loved these. I used vanilla yogurt and used half whole wheat pastry flour and half all purpose and added a little vanilla. Amazing! You do need to spread these out and they do take a little longer to cook but the texture and flavor were awesome.

They were so easy to whip up! Added a few things to make sure my kids would like them - cut in a banana in thin slices, a few dashes of cinnamon, a splash of milk, and a little bit of vanilla and agave syrup. Served with blueberries and strawberrries. It was delicious.

These pancakes are not difficult to make and should have fewer carbs and more protein than ordinary pancakes. I found that the original recipe was too pastey for pouring so I had to add a 1/4 of a cup of water (for 4 servings). Also, because these may taste bland, I suggest adding in blueberries for some sweetness and antioxidants!

These are the BEST pancakes I've ever had! 
Love that there's no sugar, butter or oil in the recipe! 
Made exactly as written, using plain Greek yogurt (3/4 cup) . 
I whisked the yogurt and egg really good to get as much air as I could into it. Folded the dry mix in very carefully. I was surprised to see how beautifully fluffy the batter was.. Like pillows. 
I cooked mine in a bit of coconut oil. 
You do need to make sure to spread them out a bit.. To ensure they cook properly. 
I got 5 nice sized ones. You can easily use flavored Greek yogurt that would add some sweetness and you could really change it up. I love the tanginess plain Greek yogurt brings to these pancakes. I served mine with a dollop of Greek yogurt, a drizzle of maple syrup and fresh berries. 
Thanks!.. Will be making these all the time :)

I will be using this recipe from now on! I used vanilla Greek yogurt and white wheat flour and it turned out great!  I am going to try this batter in my waffle iron next. I will update on how it turns out.

I’m a fan! I love pancakes. I subbed the flour for cup-4-cup gf flour and added some vanilla extract. I will make again.

I decided to play with the recipe. I used 2 eggs instead of 1, used 2 containers(5.3 0z each) toasted coconut greek yogurt and a touch of vanilla extract and I had no cinnamon but used pumpkin pie spice. We loved them, very good.

I used homemade yogurt so i was able to control how much whey/liquidy the yogurt was.  If you use typical store bought greek yogurt you might need to thin the batter a bit.  Definitely add salt - I used 1/2 tsp.

My son doesn’t eat Greek yogurt very well, but he LOVES these pancakes. I actually pour the batter into a 9 x 13 inch glass baking dish and bake them in the oven.

I love them but I was wondering if anyone has made waffles with this recipe?  If so, did you change anything?
Thank you in advance!

I would add a pinch of salt to the recipe and 1/4 cup of water to make the batter a little more fluid.  Done with whole fruit yoghurt like cranberries or strawberrys gives an additional layer of flavor.

So light and fluffy! I doubled it, added vanilla and used 2.5 teaspoons of baking soda. Delicious with homemade jam!

I added milk to this recipe until it was more like traditional pancake batter.  I also added a little bit of vanilla extract.  With these additions, it was fantastic!

The batter ended up too thick (like cookie dough or biscuit dough).  I added a bit of almond milk so that it resembled batter but the pancakes were flat and bland.  They also took a long time to cook.  I agree with another review that it might be a good recipe with some adjustments.  Perhaps add a banana for sweetness.  I'll try it again with less milk and add a banana for sweetness.

The texture was surprisingly great. When i made it, i realized the mixture was MUCH thicker than expected(So it made less than i thought it would).  It was a little hard to spread but wasn't that bad.

I made one batch exactly as the directions say, and another with a bit of salt and blueberries. I personally preferred it with a hint of salt as it added more flavor to the pancake. I also used coconut oil to cook it, so the salt may not be needed if cooked with salted butter.

I made some changes. I used an 8 oz container of Noosa yogurt. I also doubled the recipe: 2 c spelt flour,  2 whole eggs, 2 tsp baking soda also added 2 tsp sugar, 1tsp vanilla. Preheated a non-stick pan with some canola oil spray and cooked for about 3 minutes on each side. They there delicious and very hearty pancakes, perfectly browned. Will add blueberries next time.

These were good, but could have used a little more flavor. I'd probably use a vanilla yogurt next time.

This was super easy and a great way to use up extra yogurt. I've made this a few times now- I like to add a 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract and for a twist, I ladd a few thin banana slices on top of the batter right after I pour it on the griddle. Satisfying!
