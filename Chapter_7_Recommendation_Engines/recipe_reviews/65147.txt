A decent, basic duck recipe that doesn't overpower the flavor of the duck with too many spices.  The butter, however, is *extreme* overkill.  Duck is already a very fatty meat.  The last thing it needs is to have a half cup of butter dumped over it.  Stuff the cavity with some onion, lemon wedges, and garlic cloves, skip the butter entirely, and it's perfect.

Awesome recipe the duck was fabulous! I added a bit of garlic to the rub, I also put half a stick of butter in the duck before putting it in the oven and the last 15 minutes of cooking i glazed it with the orange sauce, and it was just so good. We have duck every year during the holidays and this was the best it has ever turned out. TY for the great recipe!

Love, love love this recipe.  I had always liked the inside of duck, but was not fond at all of the sweet sauce that was always on top.  Noone else seemed to know how to do a savory skin.  thanks so much...It was delicious.  I will now make duck often, and not just for special occassions.

Great recipe. Very easy and tasty. I put a quartered lemon and some sprigs of fresh thyme and savory in the cavity. I did not add butter but basted it with the rendered fat. I made a gravy with the pan drippings (fat separated)and some stock made from the neck, gibblets and wing tips along with chopped carrots, onions and celery.I took the advice of previous reviewers and reduced salt by 1/2t and overall cooking time by 15 mins. A great recipe that you can fancy up or make as is.

I debated on giving this 5 stars (I feel people give those too easily and they lose value) but this dish earned it. My husband and I both stopped mid- first bite and looked at each other with surprise, it was so good. It also looked beautiful, I should have taken a picture but we were hungry! I did not use any butter or oil, and neither should you. Duck is VERY fatty and will produce plenty of oil to baste in during cooking. Also, I elevated the duck on quartered potatoes so that it wouldn't be swimming in fat during cooking. I definitely recommend this as it also covers a tasty side dish. I also stuffed the duck with a quartered onion. This recipe is a keeper and my husband demanded the leftovers for lunch.

Very simple to make and delicious. The whole family loved it!
One tip, get a food thermometer that  you can keep in the meat while it's cooking. The probe runs a wire to the outside of the oven attached to the display. You can see the internal temp w/out opening the oven. The full 2 hours would have been a little too long for my bird.

WONDERFUL!!! I made this for Thanksgiving, a bit fearful, but with so many raving reviews I had to try it. First, I poked many holes in the "skin only"  to help release the grease (as recommended by other sites.) I used the ingredients in this recipe plus 1 tsp. garlic and 1 tsp. seasoning salt as others had suggested. I rubbed the seasoning on it the day before and let it sit overnight in the frige.
WOW! It was the best duck that I have ever eaten! 
I was so impressed and so very pleased. Throw away the orange sauce that comes with the duck, it does no justice! I have tried it before and was never impressed. Before trying this recipe I really wasn't impressed with duck, but now, WOW!
You must try it! This will be my only "go to" recipe for duck! 
LOVED IT, as did the family! I cooked a 7lb duck. Used the meat thermomiter to reach between 160 and 180. I also put a rack in the roasting pan so it wouldn't sit in the grease. Also, I read to save the grease in the frige, it is great for the best fried potatoes or fried eggs.

This is such an incredibly delicious recipe!  I was skeptical at first, given the simplicity of the recipe. Anyway, this was a huge hit with my entire family.  Next time though, I'll be making two ducks so there will enough for all four of us:-)

I must say I have had duck in 5 star restaurants it was always delicious. I never seen duck for sale in my grocery store until one day I was in Aldi an they had a 2.5lb duck for sale for $12 I knew that was a good price a single serving of duck in a restaurant is $15 or more. Well as simple as this recipe is it's all that's needed. I did alter a few things my rub was made with garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, & black pepper. I stuffed the cavity w/ lemon wedges, garlic cloves, & sprinkled dry thyme in the cavity. My sister inlaw had the perfect raised baking pan for the duck which I cooked covered w/ foil for the 1st 45 minutes in the bottom of the pan I put carrots & potatoes cut up. I did poke holes in the duck with a big fork so the fat can drain off into the pan which season the veggies well.. This duck was so flavorful. Next time I make it I will cook 2 ducks. This is a fatty meat, & does not need the "butter" at all it got more than enough oil.I did season the duck overnight left in fridge and took it out to air dry get room temp 2.5 hours before cooking. & the cooking time is 1.5 hours to 2 hours depending on how well you want your poultry cooked. I don't chance it I cooked my meat for maybe a little over 2 hours.

The duck came out fantastic. I tried other recipies that called for pricking the skin / steaming the duck before roasting to get rid of the fat - etc. Out of these complicated methods - yours was simplest and gave the best result.  My tip - as duck releases a lot of fat, I made a "grill" to raise the duck above the pool of fat - so I lined the bottom of cast iron pot with peeled whole carrots. When the duck is done, the skin is crispy and carrots are tender and soaked through with delicious fat and drippings. The carrots got eaten more quicky than the duck itself.

I added 2 tsp garlic to the rub, and a bit of lemon juice, like someone else - I put quartered lemons inside the bird with fresh thyme and basil. Roasted at 400 for 15 min per LB + 15 minutes. for last 1/2 of baking added 1 can mushroom soup (not diluted) to roasting pan, and approx 2 c baby bella mushrooms sliced and 1 c enoyke mushrooms - AWESOME even my 4 yr old and 5 yr old enjoyed it!

This was my very first time ever preparing duck and it was fantastic! For thanksgiving I prepared duck and roasted chicken and there were no left overs from the duck. I will be using this receipe again for our Christmas dinner and beyond. I was very pleased with the results. I would recommend to season the meat the night before to get the full benefits of the seasonings. Bon Apetit!!

It is good to rub your duck with butter (or oil of your choice)before roasting, but you do not need to baste it with butter throughout the cooking process. Duck is a very fatty meat and does not need this extra fat overkill - especially if you are planning to reserve the duck fat for other cooking projects.

I pierced the skin of the duck to allow the fat to drain out and roasted it on a rack above a pan so it wouldn't be cooking in its grease.  I also omitted the butter.  It's amazing how much fat came out of the duck!  The duck tasted good, the skin was crispy, but there was very little meat and despite draining out most of the fat, there was still a fairly thick subcutaneous layer remaining.  I think there are slow roasting methods that eliminate that problem, but I didn't feel like spending 5+ hours doing that.  The biggest problem I had with roasting a duck was the smell.  I LOVE duck, but the smell of roasting duck in my apartment was nauseating.  I was no longer hungry when it was finished and my living space smelled for days.  I think the next time I have a hankering for duck, I'll go to a restaurant.

This was such a flop for me, and a HUGE disappointment since i had all my family over and I spent a lot of money on these ducks. It took much much longer to cook, and the meat was not tasty at all. The best part of the meal were the potatoes and carrots I cooked under the duck...Never again..

The cooking time was right on the money, and I was very happy to find a seasoning idea that didn't include fruit or a fruit glaze.  The only thing I did differently was to omit the butter because duck is notoriously greasy.  I removed the duck and the juices from the roaster, deglazed with white wine and then made a delicious gravy to serve over roasted potatoes.

I made this duck for Thanksgiving. I used all the butter called for, and it turned out wonderfully!! I carved it and put it on the platter, and it was gone in seconds. Everyone said it was seasoned perfectly. Thanks for the recipe!!

Made this recipe with a duck we raised this year.  The duck was skinless, so I used butter, but, only 1/4 cup.  I also cut the salt in half since the butter was salted, and added a scant teaspoon of garlic powder.  I tented the bird with aluminum foil and cooked it at 400 degrees for an hour and 15 minutes; then let it rest for 10 more minutes still under the foil.  Next time I will cut the time down to 45-60 minutes and stay with tenting/resting time at 10 minutes.  My husband LOVED it.  We skinned half of the ducks we butchered this year and left the skin on the other half, so with the ones WITH skin, I would cut the butter down to only a tablespoon - just enough for the butter flavor.  I also think this would be awesome on the grill for a skin-on bird.

Exceedingly simple but so incredibly delicious!  I had never made duck before but I certainly will do it again, it was amazing!  I followed the recipe as stated and I don't think I would have changed a thing.  I served mine with garlic mashed potatoes and roasted green beans and asparagus with mushrooms and apple crisp for desert, will become a regular meal around my house!  Thanks for sharing :)

Great recipe, I added garlic powder and smoked paprika (hot). I also put potato and onion chunks (salted) into the fatb in the pan for the last 30 minutes or so. It was great.

I wanted my kids to try duck and am not a big fan of the glazes that were out there and found this recipe. As some of the others commented, I was curious to see if it lived up to the rating with minimal ingredients. I made the recipe as stated then read some more reviews while it was baking. I was nervous that it would be too salty so I basted with unsalted butter.  Not sure if it made a difference, but it came out DELICIOUS.  My kids are eating it up like crazy.  The duck is small, but was perfect for me and my 4 kids (under 10). If my husband were here I would definitely have to make 2.  My kids loved the way it smelled and looked when it came out of the oven. Another plus!  Also as others have stated, I would recommend a meat thermometer, to prevent the duck from drying out.  I will definitely keep this recipe and maybe try adding garlic to it next time, just personal preference though.

This recipe was very easy to cook. I have never had duck before or have cooked it. To give you an Idea I am a 25 year old man that just started getting into cooking. The only changes that I made is after letting the duck cook for an hour I used 1/4 of a cup of butter. You do not need to add any more butter after that. The fat on ducks is so thick you dont really have to worry about it drying out!!!!! This recipe is so simple even a cave man can do it....... Just make sure you check the internal temp....

I added 1/2 teaspoon onion salt, 1 1/2 teaspoons table salt and 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder to the rub. I then added 3 cloves of German Garlic crushed inside the duck. Also it was roasted on a rack in the roaster pan with the lid on for the first hour and then with out the lid. It came out less greasy on a rack. All around a great recipe to start with just needed a little tweak for my personal taste.

Just like others, this rub was simple and the duck tastes great! While one person of my 5 did not like it the others loved it. Seems that duck yield about 50% of its weight so buy accordingly. My duck's weight was over 6# and we were lucky to get 2 1/2 -3 lbs of moist eating.

This was very good and so easy to make.  I basted the duck with it's rendered fat, you do not need the extra butter!  Here's is a trick that I think makes for a crispier skin:  24 to 48 hours before you want to serve it, unwrap, score ( cut across the fat diagonally in both directions, making sure to avoid cutting into the flesh) rub pepper and salt on/ into the skin and cavity and place in the fridge uncovered.  This will let the bird dry out and acts as a dry brine. Dry bird= crispy skin!  Thank you Rhonda, now I have a go to duck recipe.

AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING!  Can't wait to make it again!  I wanted to have duck at Christmas but I never made a duck before, so I tried this one because it seemed easy and I had all the ingredients.  WOW!  It was SO good that I bought another duck the next time I went to the store and threw it in the freezer just so I could do it again soon!  

I also threw half of a pear I had left over in the cavity - which I think added to the flavor - but other than that I followed directions exactly.

My husband has been asking me to prepare duck for years (his mother often made it for holidays)  This was simple and very tasty. I followed recipe but made two ducks and placed lemon and onion in the cavity because I had them.  I also eliminated the last butter basting after reading other reviews. Very tasty and simple.  I was glad to find a recipe that did not use orange sauce.

This was great, but with the alterations!  I know it's good when my husband makes this certain grunt/moan noise.  That sounds weirder than it is...
Either way, followed suggestions and put half an onion and lemon in the cavity, threw some chopped garlic and rosemary on top, and ignored the butter (basted it in its juice)

I made this last year for Thanksgiving because it was simple, and it was such a huge hit that I had to make another one for Easter.  Here it is one year later and the smell of duck in the oven again is just heavenly. 

This duck is a new Holiday tradition in my house.

Exactly what I wanted!  I didn't want a sweet duck, but more of a savory.  And now I have a wonderfully roasted carcass to make a soup.  Will make again!

Instead of butter, I used EVOO and made a wet rub with that, paprika, salt, pepper, garlic powder, thyme and savory.  I quartered a lemon and an onion and inserted it into the cavity.  I roasted it, basting it several times with its own juices.  I also made a gravy with the drippings and stock and a medium roux.  PERFECT!!!  Thanks for giving me this base to start with and thanks to all the other reviewers for your suggestions.

I cooked duck for the first time for my family for Valentines day. This recipe was delicious but I did make a few changes as per the other reviews. Leave out the butter completely - duck is very oily. And I added a quartered lemon, 4 halved scallions & 4 garlic cloves inside the bird. I pricked the duck around the neck and drumsticks to help drain some of the fat & I used the drippings from the pan to baste the duck.

I am pretty much learning to cook & I love duck.  My hubby & I were having cousins over to celebrate anniversary & I wanted to make a special dish (hubby is an excellent cook) & I chose this one.  I had never attempted to make duck before.  This duck was so easy & came out awesome!!!  Only thing I did different was to chop up youkon gold potatoes & some onion, layered that on bottom or pan & put the duck on top.  I did not season or oil the potatoes/onions at all, the juice from the duck & butter that was poured over the duck during cooking flavored them perfectly.  I suppose a more healthful option would be to roast the duck in a roasting rack so you don't consume all the yummy fat/butter & do veggies on the side.  Enjoy everyone, you've only one life to live.

This was so simple to prep and cook and it tasted fantastic! The seasoning is simple allowing the natural flavor of the duck to dominate, and the large quantities of butter made the duck extremely moist. This may be the only way I ever cook duck again, with absolutely no change to the recipe.

Made this dish for Easter and followed the recipe to a T and it worked out well.  I always start with the premise that I'd follow the recipe as submitted first and the second time around, do some modifications as I see fit.

Skip the butter. Duck is fatty as it is and does not need anymore fat. Simply baste the duck with its own juices every half hour or so. For a more tender duck, I would cook it for an hour and a half or so in foil at about 350 first, and then uncover and cook another 1 hour or so at 375.  Squeezing an orange on the duck is also nice.

This is a great base for roasting your first duck.  I used 1 tsp of seasoned salt, 1/2 tsp of accent, 1/2 tsp of meat tenderizer.  It needs 2 teaspoons of salt as stated. I thought a 5lb duck would not need so much salt. My mistake. But I still had flavor.  I gave a four star rating because the instructions did not state whether to cover the duck while roasting. I used a frozen duck and the package said bake uncovered.  So after an hour, I put 1/4 cup butter on the duck and it began to fry the duck in the oven so I covered the duck for the last hour so my duck would not burn.  I did not apply anymore butter.  It was done to perfection. It looked absolutely beautiful. Thank you for the recipe.

I am very rarely intimidated by the concept of preparing any kind of meat, but I've been regaled with many tales of why duck is difficult, and why someone who isn't a classically trained chef and/or doesn't have the "proper" equipment should steer clear of this tasty bird.  After trying this recipe, which marked my first foray into duck-roasting territory, I'm pleased to say that ANYONE who has ever roasted a chicken can pull off this recipe.  I changed the recipe only slightly: added 1 teaspoon of garlic to the rub, used only 1/4 cup butter, basted every 30 minutes, and had it in the oven for 20 minutes shorter than the instructions called for.  What came out was perfectly crispy skin with moist meat cooked to medium (might not recommended by the USDA, but it's how it is properly served).

This recipe is very simple and goooooddddd!!!! 

No salt, just add garlic and onion powder to rub. I also used Mrs. Dash's Steak Grilling Blend pepper mix in place of regular black pepper and margarine in place of butter. Best to do the rub at least 12 hours before cooking.

Put a stick of margarine to the cavity of duck. After about 30 minutes of baking, brushed on a mixture of half a stick of margarine and garlic with onion powder. 

Believe me, when it was done, and my family ate it, there were hugs and kisses galores for me. From now on, this recipe will be for special occasion dinners.

I used this recipe and found it to be excellent. Instead of salt I used Adobo(spanish seasoning)which is salt based and added a small amount of garlic powder.My wife(latina) thought this was the best duck she has had.

I bought a 2.7 lb duck on a whim on Saturday and decided to try this recipe. It was amazing! 

I used a little less of the seasoning mix due to the smaller bird, I also added garlic powder. I stuffed the cavity with a cut up yellow onion and a mandarin orange I had poked holes into. I cooked it for a little over an hour at 365F and just used the fat to baste every 30 min or so (I didn't use the butter). I also don't have a roasting pan so I just used a rectangular square baking pan and it worked fine. I used a meat thermometer to make sure it was 180F and let it rest for about 20 min with a foil tent. It was so juicy and the skin was delicious! My brother and boyfriend was so impressed that my boyfriend has demanded we have duck every week!

I am cooking another one (6 lb this time) right now and I have cut up carrots, onions and garlic under it this time to lift it out of the fat a bit. So excited! Thanks for the recipe and the reviews, they are so helpful! :D

Love this recipe. It's the start of my Duck L'orange. The duck is so fatty I eliminate the butter. Cook one hour at 375, drain all fat and return to casserole dish, add one small can of defrosted orange juice concentrate and teaspoon of orange zest. Cook 45min more and serve with wild rice. Simple and elegant.

This was not worth the mess it makes of your oven. Had to clean the grease from oven twice before turning the self cleaner on. It also needed more flavor and skin does't crisp up well. First whole duck I have ever cooked and will be the last.

Excellent and very easy to make.  I had never cooked duck before and was quite surprised at how little meat there is once you carve the bird.  It was just enough for 3 people.  Next time I'll use a bigger bird.

The seasoning is good but the duck came out a bit dry.

This was my first attempt at cooking a duck, and even the first time I had eaten it. Like some others I put onions, garlic and a quartered lemon inside. It tasted wonderful! I also put a rack underneath so it was a little less fatty/greasy. I barely got a chance to eat a piece because everyone loved it so much. Now I need to make one when I don't have family over!

Sadly, this didn't do much for us.  We were very disappointed.  Could have been that we just had an ugly duckling, but I followed the recipe to a T, our it turned out very average.

oh my God!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i didn't know duck could taste sooooooooooooooo goooooooooooooddddddddd@!  lol! but it is very greasy so make sure you place duck in a pan with a rack for grease to drop off that is deep enough to hold ALOT of grease! the duck disappeared before i could even get it to the table! everyone nibbled on it until there was nothing left! lol!

This recipe was awesome!  I was searching for a VERY EASY duck recipe because we didn't have enough ingredients to make the other recipe I was planning on.  This recipe made our Thanksgiving delicious.  My husband can't stop talking about the amazing duck I made.  I did change it a little-instead of 2 tsp paprika I did 1 tsp paprika and 1 tsp garlic powder.  I also added red potatoes and carrots in the roasting pan and let them soak in the duck juice.  Mmmm.  We'll definitely be using this recipe again!

I think duck needs a stronger base of spices to complement the rich taste of the meat, not simply salt, pepper and paprika though those are good choices. I used a mixture of garlic powder, white pepper, a little brown sugar, kosher salt, and raosted then crushed juniper berries and powdered thyme. I scored the meat in diamonds then rubbed the spice in, lightly coated that with olive oil and let sit at room temperature for 45 minutes before searing in a hot skillet both sides darkly (just a few moments because of the sugar). I lowered the heat then cooked about 8 minutes per side on medium low heat for rare. I used Magret Duck Breasts instead of a whole duck.

This is a perfect example where good does not have to be pretentious. A simple well organized recipe. I suggest a good bottle of Corbieres as a complement.

So simple but so delicious.  Suprisingly my  children said they preferred having duck then chicken.  If your not a big salt fan like us then I recommend cutting the salt back a little.  Otherwise it´s delicious!

Excellent!  However, my 7 lb duck didn't take nearly as long as the recipe calls for.  Also, we did not put orange duck sauce on top as my family likes their duck savory.

The rating is for the recipe as written. The changes I made to make it 4 stars are as follows. No butter, just basted with duck juices half way through. Stuffed the inside with 1 lemon quartered, 6 pearl onions, & 1/2 teaspoon minced garlic. The skin was delicious.  I plan on tweaking the stuffing some next time. Overall I really enjoyed the simplicity of this recipe.

This was fine - I never had duck plain without a sauce before - I'm used to Peking Duck or with the usual apricot sauces. It leaves the duck meat "on its own" - and the flavor is a bit stronger than chicken or turkey. A good dish if you definitely know that you like duck "unmasked".

Such a great recipe. Deffently compliments the bird. I took the advice from another reviewer and added 1 Lemon, 1 Bulb of garlic, and 1 sweet onion all chopped in pieces/wedges in the duck cavity. I also added fresh thyme. I rubbed the bird down with the spices listed, and skipped the butter. I baisted the bird with its own juices about every 30 min. It came out so perfect and tender

I made this today for my husband and I for Christmas; I used fake butter (I Can't Believe It's Not Butter) just to reduce the calories a bit and it was still bloody fabulous.  My husband demands I make this every year, and I was skeptical because he hates turkey and chicken! Thank you for the recipe :)

Simple and wonderful! Followed as is, you can't go wrong, but this recipe also leaves plenty of room for you to add a customization or two (eg. substitute olive oil for butter and/or add a teaspoon of turmeric, etc...).

I have never had much success cooking duck.  This recipe is remarkably simple and delicious!  There is no reason to try a more complicated recipe.  My cooking time was much shorter than the recipe called for.  A thermometer is a good idea.

It was pretty good.  I loved how crispy the skin got.  Nothing fancy but it was definatly tasty.  I don't think I'll wanna eat a duck again for a while though...I can still feel all the grease in me....but it tasted great!!

Sorry but we were not thrilled with the spices on the duck.  I think this would be a great spice to use on roasted chicken but we thought it takes away from the duck.

Our granddaughters have raved over duck for 18 years because of Avo and Ava having them eat it from time immemorial. We decided as a lark to give it a go, at 70 years old I kick my butt for not having tried it long ago, this recipe is spot on for newbies as it is foolproof. I will keep you abreast (pun intended) of any future meanderings within the duck culinary society.

This is a an awesome basic duck recipe, like other reviews I only added 1/4 cup butter because duck is already greasy. I added fresh garlic, onion with chopped parsley and some seasoning salt for the rub. It turned out fabulous.

Excellent rub. We cut the butter to only 1/4 cup at the hour mark and did add in garlic powder 1/2 teaspoon and reduced cooking time to 1 3/4 hours.

Most times a recipe is never followed exactly, as not everyone has the same palate.  I use most recipes as a starting point to make dishes that appeal to the taste of my family.The recipe was a little heavy on the butter.  We basted it during the cooking time with a little butter, but nowhere near the amount suggested in the recipe.  My daughter made up a delicious rub to give the duck more flavour, as the recipe seemed a little bland for us.  Fresh savory, thyme and rosemary from our garden was placed in the cavity of the duck.  It was a great meal, and was the first time we tried duck.  A dish worth repeating. Thank you.

Rating is for the basic recipe - with one deletion and one addition it becomes a five star recipe. The basic recipe is a good starting point for a very basic, decent duck. It's a good first recipe!

The two changes:

1) Don't bother with the butter. It's duck; it doesn't need it. Seriously.

2) Add a teaspoon of granulated garlic to the rub.

That's it!

This recipe is basic, but really good.  I used smoked paprika instead of regular paprika, and used the same amount of spices it called for.  Also, I placed 1/2 stick of butter into the cavity. Underneath the duck, I placed diced potatoes, carrots, whole garlic cloves, and thickly sliced onions.  At the one hour point, I basted and uncovered the duck. I cooked the duck for 50 more minutes until it reached and internal temp of 180 degrees. (5 pound duck). Will definitely make this again.

OMG!!! I just made this duck for our  Thanksgiving meal. I also added garlic powder to the rub.  I just love garlic so i followed suit. I saw the other reviews and was scared to use butter. I compromised and did 1/4 stick of butter.  I made 2 ducks. 1 to keep home for me and my hubby and 1 to take to my in-laws for dinner. Of course I had to try the one I made for us.  This is the best duck recipe. I try new ones every year. Even my rotisserie. I like this the best..thank you. It's great.

This is a very simple, and excellent recipe for roasted duck.  The ducks I buy at a nearby Asian grocery mart run between 4 and 5 lbs.  2 total hours at 375 F is about all you want to roast this.  I recommend cooking the duck for 45 minutes breast up, then 35 - 40 minutes breast down, then the final 40-45 minutes breast side back up.  While I do use Kosher salt and pepper, also use a Chinese Roast Duck Mix from NOH (Hawaii).  Plus, I enjoy stuffing with the duck and being in a hurry, I just whip up some Stove Top.  I concur with the comments regarding basting with butter.  Not necessary and you can use the duck fat at the bottom of the roasting pan.  However, no harm in it and definitely add garlic.  One last thing.  Don't forget to keep the duck fat for later cooking.  Yummy with frying eggs, potatoes, all kinds of things!  Enjoy :-)

I used this recipe to prepare my duck last night. I was a little skeptical because it didn't include the fancy sauces or numerous spices. I strayed a little from the recipe by rubbing margarine on the duck and adding Chinese 5 spices.  I cooked it 1/2 hour more and it came out so crispy.  My husband's job is to do the carving - he didn't have to because the meat just fell from the bone and he touched it.  He couldn't stop eating it.  This was the best duck I have ever prepared.

This is the FIRST time I have cooked a duck and this recipe works...  I made some minor changes, including rubbing with 2 tbsp of home made harissa paste and letting stand for 2 hours (instead of the paprika and pepper) and I filled the cavity with wedges of lemon and onion and 4 cloves of garlic.  I served it on mashed potato with harissa and a tomato and onion salad.

Yummy!  I added garlic to the rub and it was Delicious. 1/2 cup butter was a little too much for us. 
Next time I'll use 1/4 cup and place some in the cavity. 
Family enjoyed too and was picking meet off the bone!

Easy and terrific! We all loved it. I skipped the butter altogether (as many previous reviewers suggested). Added 2tsp garlic powder, and 2tsps of onion powder.  I cooked it covered in foil, on a rack, or an hour and then uncovered for an additional hour. The duck did not render any fat while it was covered. It did render fat after I uncovered it. I roasted some carrots and string beans under the rack in the rendered fat during the final 40 minutes. Delicious!

Had duck a couple times and it was incredibly moist. Found a 5.7 lb frozen duck on sale and tho it came with an orange sauce packet I didn't want sweet. Used this recipe and cut the butter in half per one suggestion. Then per another suggestion stuffed cavity with 3 chopped garlic cloves, about 1/4 c sliced onion and half a sliced lemon. Added 1/4 tsp of garlic salt to the rub...The results were spectacular! Fixed for my boyfriend and his dad for Christmas Eve supper... Rave reviews!! Even the stock was saved!!

Excellent! Best duck we have ever had. Easy no fuss recipe. Mixed a few ingredients together from different reviews. Sprinkled,  garlic powder, paprika and Morton's Season Salt on outside of bird. Stuffed it with lemon, onion and 1 tablespoon of butter. We did a test, the last 15 minutes we basEdt half the bird with Duck Sauce and left half left plain. The winner... The plain side, although the Orange Sauce was great! All in all, this is a great recipe for Holidays or any special occasion. This was one of the best Thanksgiving Dinners ever!

This was the first time I enjoyed duck! This recipe was simple and delicious.  I didn't have paprika so I used Adobo instead. Our duck came with an orange marmalade sauce, which we used as a gravy, rather than pouring it all over the duck. It was nice, but it really didn't need anything.

This was our first duck, we should have gotten 2 our sons ate this up and us parents had to share our portions. We added rosemary and used seasoned salt instead of salt and pepper. We also cooked ours on a baking rack. Not greasy and great flavor. Our VERY picky son with sever texture aversions ate a ton of it.

I tried it and changed it. I started it in slow cooker and basted with its own liquid. Then I made an orange cranberry glaze. Brushed it with the glaze in a 375 oven.

I wouldn't change *a thing* about this recipe. Just make sure the duck is perfectly in the center of the oven so it isn't too close to the elements (so it won't brown too fast). Since I roasted two ducks in one oven, on top of one another other (one on a higher rack, one below) and switched them out so they would brown evenly. It came out WONDERFUL. There is a LOT of butter but that's okay because it tasted even better. Mmmmm!

I just made this today for my husband and I for Thanksgiving. We wanted something other than turkey because we will be celebrating the holiday with family this weekend and didn't want to get "turkeyed out". I had never had duck before much less cooked one, but I agreed to try it at my husband's request. WOW... I am SO glad I did, it was just simply to die for. I followed the recipe exactly except for adding a 1/2 tsp each of garlic and onion powder to the rub. My duck was just over 5lbs and we had no leftovers at all.  I will definately be making this again.  Thank you for such a great recipe!

I have to say - this was absolutely delicious.  We made the recipe as written with the exception of adding garlic and sugar to the rub and stuffing the cavity with green onion and an orange.  
We did use the butter; even though duck is extremely fatty, I believe the butter on the outside of the skin initially got the browning process going.
The fat was rendered out of the skin and it was crispy and unctuous, just the way a duck should be cooked.
Served with bruschetta topped with carmelized figs in honey and manchego cheese, as well as the "Easy Arugula Salad" here on AR.  
Amazing!

This is the first time I tried cooking duck.  It is a simple, full of flavor recipe.  It was very moist.  No greasy flavor at all.  I definitely recommend using an orange sauce as it brings out the flavor in the meat.

This is absolutely the best, simplest recipe for cooking a duck in a way that doesn't overpower the flavor of the duck, it enhances it.  DELICIOUS!!

I first made this duck two weeks ago and again today.  It came out very moist today - I realize I overcooked it last week.  I got rave reviews from my family and my husband said this is what he will 'order' when his mother and brother visit next time.  Thanks for the delicious yet easy to make recipe, Rhonda.

Tried this recipe for the first time on Christmas day.  Made sure to drain the extra fluid out of the duck during the roasting.  I may try to roast it breast side down for the first hour next time to try to crisp the skin a little more evenly all over.  The meat was wonderfully roasted, not chewy like duck often turns out.  Great, simple, YUMMY!

Excellent recipe! I cut a star because Duck is already so fatty that it doesn't need the extra half cup of butter. I skinned it and after adding the season and putting garlic and a lemon in the cavity i placed strips of bacon on top of the duck then roasted it then just discarded the bacon after.

Was looking for a recipe that didn't involve glazes and fruit stuffings and came upon this one.. so glad i did. Have eaten duck many times but this was my first time cooking it.  I added garlic and seasoning salt to the rub but otherwise kept the recipe the same.  Was hesitant about adding the half cup of butter but did it anyways and glad i did.  This turned out very tasty and good.  My kids and husband loved it!  Will keep this and make it again, maybe experiment with a few other spices as well.  Thank you for sharing!

I truly can't believe how delicious the duck tasted with this recipe, in all it's simplicity. It was so easy. I added a little bit of garlic to the rub (we're big garlic fans) and it was just marvelous! Thank you for this recipe. I've never been a big fan of sugary or fruity glazes on meat. This was perfect! I think I may use this every time!

Only giving this a 4 star because this is the first time I've tried duck.  It was much greasier than I anticipated.  I had made it for Thanksgiving last year to try something different but I think I'm going to stick to the turkey.

This was pretty good, not really different from roasting a chicken, and not much different in flavor, either. I followed other reviewers' advice and cut the salt and eliminated the butter. Not bad when you really have a craving for duck, but not a regular dish. I made a duck stir-fry with rice with the leftovers, and that was better.

Very good. Although I found I had to cook my duck for 2 hours not the 1 hour 45 minutes listed. I quartered an orange and stuffed the cavity with it I also stuffed in sprigs of fresh parsley. I basted every 15 minutes and turned the duck upside down half way through cooking.

What a wonderful and simple recipe!  I made this for Easter dinner last year and everyone loved it. Even the picky kids there thought it was awsome. I do add garlic and onion powder to my seasoning but it's still perfect just the way it is. Great for anyone looking for a great duck recipe without all the pomp and circumstance (who needs orange sauce when it tastes this good).  Two Thumbs up!!!

I made this for my daughter's communion and it went quick!  Not only was it gobbled up by adults, but the kids were eating it too!  I put the 1/2 cup of melted butter on the duck before putting in the oven and added a little white wine to the pan.  I'll make this again and not just for parties.

My fiance RARELY tells me that I'm a good cook or gives me "A" ratings on dinner, but he couldn't get enough of this!  Taking cues from those before me, I added a little bit of garlic ot the rub and melted slightly more than 1/4 of butter the 2nd time around so I put some in the cavity.  Also, before I basted the duck in butter I took it out of the pan and drained the pan each time.  Also, I used margarine instead of butter- both that and draining the pan I felt made the duck a little bit healthier.  Wonderful recipe!  I can't wait to make it for Christmas 2008 for my fiance's family!

easy and delicious!  the melted butter was more than enough (I decreased it to 1/8cup for the 2nd basting).  Make sure you measure your internal temperature (180).

Simply Delicious!!!  I made this for Thanksgiving and it was devoured in no time.  I pricked the skin to allow the grease to drain out while cooking.  I also allowed it to marinate overnight.  I will be making this every year from now on.

This is a great and easy recipe! I cut the salt in half and did 1 teaspoon kosher salt and 1 teaspoon garlic powder.  This was the first time I made duck and I couldn't ask for a better recipe.  If you are cooking 2 ducks at the same time allow an extra 30 minutes are so for cooking

This was really good and really easy.  

I cooked two duck breasts with skin, in a slowcooker with the recommended salt/pepper/paprika.  I didn't use the butter however.  

I put foil balled-up in the bottom of the cooker and put the duck, skin side up, on top of them.  

The duck turned out pretty good but the skin wasn't crispy enough to eat.  The flavor was great.  The meat was a little bit dry (my fault), but that might be due to not using the butter.  I cooked it for 2 hours on high, and 7 hours on low.  I let it sit covered for 10 minutes before cutting and serving.

Next time I'll baste it with the butter in the last hour or so and see if that helps with the dryness.  

Thanks for the recipe, we enjoyed it.

I was inexperienced at cooking duck, which as from past family experiences, can be quite fatty.  This basic roasting recipe allowed the true flavor of the duck to be enjoyed without being adulterated by strong added flavors from seasonings.

Worked pretty good, but cooking time was a little long for mine.  The taste was great!

This was my first time cooking duck. I have enjoyed it at other homes for years. I found this recipe very easy.

However, I didn't understand how/when/if I should have used the "orange seasoning packet" that came with my duck in conjunction with this recipe. I did use it and it wasn't as good as I hoped. 

Overall, my bird wasn't great, but I blame my inexperience not this recipe.

This is the best way to prepare duck - I used this recipe as a guideline and seasoned 4 duck legs and thighs with whatever I had in the cupboard: thyme, oregano, parsley, garlic, and I squeezed fresh clementine juice on them while they baked.  Another idea is putting orange glazed prunes in the roasting pan which add a great flavor to the natural sauce   . Delicious with red potatoes and stuffing!!

I made this intending to shred it into pieces for an appetizer.  The skin was a little too salty, but some of the guests still loved it.  This recipe turned out great.

Thank you so much for this recipe! I have made it twice and each time people rave how clever I am to cook duck (and I am too sneaky to tell them how easy it is!) It is a great dinner party staple, particularly for the festive season.

Truly delicious.  I have heard and read many things about preparing duck and the fatty-ness of the bird.  I got all kinds of recommendations on how to steam it to get rid of the fat etc.  All is nonsense.  In the end I prepared the duck as I would a chicken or turkey, which is what this recipe essentially calls for.  It was delicious.  Even my wife, a finicky eater, liked it.  This was my first duck and it will not be my last.  On the downside however, I had a 6.5 lb farm raised duck and when all carved up provided only 4 servings.  Lots and lots of bone with little meat other than the legs and breast.  Delicious none the less.

This is probably one of the easiest you'll find, yet it tastes awesome. The prep time is not much & the low level of additives brings out all the flavors of the duck.  while the butter acts as a flavor enhancer & keeps the meat moist. 
It's one I'll be coming back to again for sure, the only thing I did differently is stuffing the duck with chopped celery sticks & yellow onions.
It tasted awesome!

I have never cooked duck before but I wanted something different than a turkey for the holidays.
I thawed the duck and dried it off, scored it, rubbed it down with salt, pepper, paprika, and garlic powder and put some fresh thyme and garlic in the cavity, placed it in a pan and left it in the fridge for two days.   This really helped get that skin super crispy. I cut some Yukon gold potatoes in half and peeled whole carrots and placed my bird on top.  It never touched it’s oil and the potatoes and carrots were amazing.  I’ll definitely definitely cook this again!

I added a tsp of garlic like others did. This duck was made for a special occasion and was a huge hit. My husband, who is picky when it comes to meat, raved about it. I will make this again!

First time cooking a whole duck. Everyone liked it. It carves a little differently than a roast chicken, so might want to watch a YouTube video on carving a duck. I don't think you need the butter... the  duck makes so much delicious fat on its own, adding more seemed like overkill. I mean, we probably had about a cup of fat in the roaster, which we saved and froze.

By the way, one other thing we did was we took the duck out about half an hour before it was done and put a layer of halved small red potatoes cut side down in the duck fat, then put the duck on top of them for the rest of the cook time... potatoes cooked in duck fat... Yum!

I agree with not adding the butter.  What I did, however, is I laid sweet potatoes (cut in thirds) on the bottom of the pot and laid the duck on top of it so it didn't sit in its fat.  I also basted it every 45 minutes,  Let it rest for about 15 minutes before cutting into it.  Mashed up the sweet potatoes and served duck with the peach sauce.  Believe it or not, it was better the next day!!!

Didn't change anything. I roasted  two birds that we raised didn't quite take the whole time. I did use thermometer. I did use the melted butter I believe it helped with the browning.

Well that’s was about the best duck ever.  Not sure why it is reviewed so poorly.  Someone even commented that the butter was unnecessary.  I disagree... a duck can go from perfect to over cooked really fast and the butter helps to keep the meat moist.  It does add some calories, but who counts calories on special occasions?

Make sure you pierce the skin before cooking.  Otherwise you end up with meat so coated in fat that it is difficult to eat.  Another thing I like to do is coat the skin with salt, put it in the fridge (or a cooler with a tight lid outside if it is a cold night) and allow the skin to dry.  This makes for a glass like crispness.  It is delightful!!

I made this last year for the first Thanksgiving I cooked myself. It was so good, I'm doing it again this year! I cooked the duck on top of the carrots and potatoes as suggested by other commenters, so the duck doesn't sit in the fat, and it eliminates the need for gravy on the potatoes. I also put a few cloves of fresh garlic inside the duck. Be sure to keep the fat for making duck fat fries later!!

Be sure to add garlic and onion powder to the rub, and don't be stingy with the salt. Surprisingly delicious for such a simple recipe (just let the duck do all the work!)

Nice and easy duck recipe even my partner who isn't fond of duck requested I make this again. I reduced the amount of butter to 1/8 cup I felt it made the skin brown and crisp up nicely. 
 I did a few additional/different steps such as pouring boiling water (with a touch of soy) over the duck beforehand and drying it out overnight in the fridge.  Also roasted it on a rack with veggies underneath

I followed the recipe but also stuffed the duck with garlic cloves, cut up onion and lemon as someone else suggested, and it was DELICIOUS!

I have never made duck before and I wanted to give it a try. This was good. I had a six pound bird that took 3 hr to cook. I put cut onion and butter in the cavity and that may have been why it took so long to cook. The butter I used to baste the bird was infused with garlic. I did remove some of the fat from the roaster and added it to the veg and potato’s as they roasted. If I was to make this again I would brine the bird. I always brine chicken. Everyone thought it was good. Some said it tasted like dark meat turkey some said nay, nay.... chicken. It was good. Thx

I wanted to make something different and this very simple rub was awesome. Have made it with chicken also. Definitely worth trying. Watch that it doesn't dry out towards the end.

This is so simple and amazing. I’d never cooked duck before and thanks to this recipe it’s all my family wants for the holidays. I’ve made this duck several times now and it’s never failed to please.

I made this for my first foray into cooking duck. I added a teaspoon of garlic to the rub and left out the butter. 

It was fantastic. I need to learn how to decently butcher a duck, and I look forward to many more attempts until I get it just right.

i prefer wild duck. These was tame ducks....very dry.
One duck was paprika, salt and pepper.  Myrna loved the flavour.  The other was apple, celery, and onion.  Both were cooked in the oven at 350F at the same time.  Both were very dry, even with much basting.

The recipe is a little bland for my family's taste. I thought it needed more salt and something to add more flavor to the skin, perhaps orange concentrate or a honey mixture. The butter was overkill and really not needed although I did use it. I used a Char Broil Oilless Turkey Fryer (it is really a roaster despite it's name.) Our duck weighed 6 pounds and roasted to 165F in one hour. The skin was crispy and the texture of the meat was good.

Quack, quack, quack, . . . very moist, but still took longer to cook, reach the 180F internal temp, than the recipe said. Not as tasty as I had hoped. Stuffed it with clementines, and basted it with a mixture of spices, honey, oj, butter. Recipe said about two hours, 20 minutes/lb at 375, NOT, took another hour to cook. Pretty bland.  Oh well, must be the quacker, eh

My husband grew up with duck or goose at Christmas, this year we made a 3.5 pound local grown duck for our Christmas.
It was the perfect size for the two of us, I used the carcass and left over meat and made a duck both the next day for further asian recipes that we sourced. 
I did add apples and onions to the cavity and turned over ever 45 min until done and omitted the butter. Duck is fat..
Duck is very pricey so you really have to like duck, to invest in this one very  often.

This was my first attempt at duck, and it came out incredibly well! I also added red pepper flakes and garlic powder.  All I ever heard prior (and even during) to making it was how hard it was to get duck to come out right.  It was also incredibly greasy; I recommend a deep pan to roast in, as mine came very close to the lip, which caused for some delicate balance when removing during periodic basting.  Other than my disappointment over the yield of meat my duck gave, I am happy with this recipe!  However, I also recommend a back-up dish, such as a ready-made dinner ham, in case of a mishap.

Excellent - simple and effective! Like many others, I didn't need any butter - plenty of fat (and veggie juice from the tray below) to keep pouring over the duck.

Sometimes I use these seasonings to roast a chicken. I love this duck.  If I have extra onion carrots etc I stuff the cavity. This carcass makes a great broth!

Easily the most popular bird I've ever made for Thanksgiving. I didn't use any butter, and inserted a few things in the cavity before roasting (microwave 1/2 apple, 1/2 onion, 2 slices of ginger, and some garlic in a bowl with water, then dumped the water and put the solids inside the bird). Other than that, I followed the recipe. I used a 5 lb duck and it was at room temp when put into the oven---the cooking time seemed just about right. I also pricked the skin to let more of the grease drain. Finally, be sure to dry the bird thoroughly before rubbing it down with the salt/pepper/paprika mix, and use a good grade of paprika. Delicious!

So simple and so tasty! 

I did pierce the skin all over to allow the fat to drain out of the duck. And I didn't add any butter. Without the butter it was already so fatty and oily! 

The other thing is that I ate it with a bit of apple jam (thick pieces of apple), and the tastes of the duck and apple went very well together. So perhaps just a suggestion of some simple little bit more flavour to compliment the taste of the meat (raisins or apples or oranges or onions or some other thing placed inside the duck?) would make this recipe a 5-star.

Recipe is super easy! I added a Parmesan garlic seasoning. Also used a smoked paprika instead. The duck turned out perfect! It was so tender and juicy. Melt in your mouth! Would use this recipe again.

This is so easy and is for the roast duck purists who like the taste of just duck.

Ok so this rub is delicious. The flavors are great however duck is not. Too fatty, and since it is, the spices don't get through it to the meat. I'm going to use this on a chicken. I think it will be amazing.

Great recipe! I added a bit of garlic to the rub and also put some butter inside the duck before roasting.  I covered the wings with foil towards the end so they wouldn't burn and later also covered the duck with foil.  Other than that, I followed the recipe. It came out very moist! Best duck I've ever made! :)

This was the best duck I ever tasted!  I followed the recipe with a few exceptions:  I did not put butter on the skin of the duck, but instead I poked holes to allow the fat to run out.  I stuffed the duck with an onion, a lemon, and 4 basil sprigs.  I added garlic to the rub. Great duck!

This was my first time making duck. I did what the other reviewers suggested and stuffed the bird with lemons and onions. I roasted at 425 degrees basting every twenty minutes or so for a total cook time of about 2.25 hours. Duck was pretty tasty.

The duck was so good!  I bought an organic duck from a local butcher which I've always thought improves the quality of the meat ten-fold.  I marinated the duck in a white wine overnight then rinsed it off the next day and cooked according to the recipe.  It was done in under two hours, which may be due to cooking it in a dutch oven.  Everyone enjoyed this recipe!

Really delicious duck recipe without going overboard with all the sauces and glazes like some recipes do. The 2 hours would have been too long for my bird, even though it was 5 1/2 lbs. 1 1/2 hours was plenty. I didnt use the butter as the duck rendered enough fat itself. Perfectly crispy skin, and wonderful flavor.  Definitely a keeper.

The spices are good and I did not use butter; the duck comes out fine. Use a good sweet sauce, orange, cranberry or whatever you like to coat the duck the last 15 minutes of roasting.

it has been a long time  since I last cooked duck and this was nice, my wife and guests enjoyed it. BUT the cooking times really are way off as some reviewers have pointed out. it was clear that after just over an hour it was pretty much done and I had to keep it covered until the other dishes were done, making it overdone by  that time. I pricked the skin on fatty places and used butter.... but I eat low carb so was not phased by high fat.

Made this for Easter dinner today minus the melted butter, as duck has plenty of fat anyway! The skin was crispy, tasty and fought over... Yummy! Will use this for my go-to duck recipe!

I made this duck with my husband, but we made little cuts on the skin and put the duck on a special "pedestal" so that the fat would drain out.  It  was delicious, wished it was 3 times bigger! Definitely making this dish for special occasions. Great recipe!

I made this and pretty much followed the recipe. My only changes were that my rub had onion and garlic powder and Old Bay seasoning (highly recommended) as well as salt and pepper. I also made a rack with sliced potatoes and whole, peeled carrots and cooked it covered with foil for the first hour. It looked beautiful and tasted great. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Loved the spice combination all the family loved it too.  Will use this as a rub for other grilling recipes. I understand why the use of butter, it helped the spices stay on the skin especially for the first stage if grilling, but used half amount in recipe because of the fat already in duck. Also put in a quartered lemon in cavity and basted the duck at I hour and then after 45 minutes with the juices. Great recipe and so simple.

Great recipe!  First time cooking duck, and it came out delicious and tender. . .  but very greasy -- especially with the butter on top.  Won't use butter next time, found the duck browned well on its own.

Excellent recipe. Great spice rub. I only use about a tablespoon of butter and baste it every 30 minutes. After 30 minutes I put melted butter on the bird, after that I baste it with its own juices every 30 minutes. Takes about 2 hours total. Great for duck or chicken.

Delicious. I made it the way it is written only put potatoes and onions under the grill in my roaster. I also soaked it in ice water like other suggested. Finally, I made duck sauce from this site. Everyone loved it and leftovers were minimal. Which is a good thing in a house where leftovers stay in the fridge for days. Thanks for the recipe, this was my first time ever making a duck.

This recipe is simple and excellent. I did follow the advise of another member by not using butter and adding some garlic powder and yet it still is delicious.

Absolutely fabulous!  My family have never been very keen on duck, but this recipe has changed their minds.

Great recipe, and really easy. I used white pepper and rock salt, and put a good amount of salt inside the cavity. That flavors it throughout.

I love this recipe.  It is so simple, but when ever I make it, it turns out amazing!  I used light olive oil instead of butter the first time I made it, but the duck is so fatty that it was unnecessary the next couple of times.  Great recipe!!

Easy and fail-proof.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  Stuffed an orange and a slice of ginger in the cavity.  Made the duck more fragrant.

Very good.  I've tried to get a crispy duck like my favorite Thai restaurant, but this is the one that comes closest.  I read the reviews and added garlic and other spices, and left out the butter completely.  I also used just a small amount of kosher salt in place of the salt.  Kudos to the reviewer who mentioned juniper berries; I've used them with a standing rib roast before, and they add a great pungent taste to the rub.
