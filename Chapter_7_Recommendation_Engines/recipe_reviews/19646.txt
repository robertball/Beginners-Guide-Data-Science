This is exactly the same recipe given to me by my mother-in-law, only without the addition of the cheese.  For a variation, I highly recommend shaping the loaf "free form" on a foil-lined broiler pan, and lay slices of bacom horizontally across the top and sides, tucking the ends under the loaf.  The bacon really makes this meatloaf delicious!

My kids love cheese inside their meatloaf, so I've used several types. Mozarella in the center with marinara sauce covering the top of the loaf is a nice italian version. Pepper jack and enchilada sauce makes it a little mexican. You can let your imagination go wild. Try ham and swiss and cover top with cream of mushroom soup too.

I absolutely loved this meatloaf!  I don't like traditional meatloaves with ketchup, so this was a refreshing change.  The cheese ribbon tasted too much like just bread to me, so next time I will leave it out but the meat was so flavorful and delicious I will keep making it.  A keeper for sure. Would have been a five star without the cheese.

I used only beef since we raise beef cows and have ample supply.  Husband and I really liked it.  8-year-old daughter hated the "stuff" in the middle even after I explained that it was cheese.  Usually in her opinion everything is better with cheese on it but it was a no go.  Will make it again but not extend the ribbon to the end for her.

This was delicious and super filling.  They are not lying when they say it takes two hours, so leave yourself some extra time.

I really liked the cheese filling, although I didn't care too much for the meatloaf itself....but I'm thinking I'm just not a meatloaf person.  My husband is and he liked it quite a bit. :)

Even though meatloaf is supposed to be simple to make ....... I never have luck with it.  I made this last night and both my husband and I absolutely LOVED it.  It will now be OUR meatloaf from now on.  Thanks SO much!

This is my favorite meatloaf.  I changed the recipe a bit by substituting ground turkey for the beef, doubling the amount of bread, and using mozzarella instead of cheddar (it holds its texture better in the oven).  I also found that using a breakfast sausage mixture for the pork works very well, or you could add a touch of maple syrup for that sweet flavor.  A wonderful recipe that I have been using for years!

Thank-you so much for this recipe. I lost mine and my sister-in-law always asks if I have found it yet. I can now make it again. It's a great recipe and everyone that has tried it, loves it. Thanks again!!!

I made this meatloaf tonight with my husband, whose favorite recipe for meatloaf is double cheese meat loaf. This recipe was soooo good, the only change I maden was I put the ketcup and mustard mixture atop the meatloaf and sprinkled parmesean while it was baking and after. My favorite recipe by far, double cheese was my favorite but slim comparison. Served with Spinach mushroom caserrole and romaine ceaser salad

This is a wonderful recipe but I did something abit different or should I say extra.  In the middle with the bread and cheese I also added some bit's and pieces of broccoli into the mixture in the middle and wow it was awesome.

This was totally fabulous. My boyfriend is going through a phase of not wanting too many flavours, and this was exactly the right thing.

I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of adding bacon to the top.  The bacon is the only thing we ate.  The meat was dull & lacked flavor and the cheese "ribbon" in the middle was overpowered by the flavor of bread.  I tried to save it the next day by slicing, spicing, pan searing & serving between garlic toast (like a cheeseburger) but it was still inedible.

Before making this recipe, as always I read the reviews., and made some revisions.  I did use the mozzarella for the middle.  But we were very disappointed with this recipe.  The only flavor we tasted was the ground pork, and it didn't please either my husband nor my adult son.  Won't be making it again. 
Sorry

I made the Italian version with mozzarella and tomato basil pasta sauce.  Even the leftovers didn't last.  There are as many ways to tweak this recipe as there are cooks.  You'll enjoy every one!
