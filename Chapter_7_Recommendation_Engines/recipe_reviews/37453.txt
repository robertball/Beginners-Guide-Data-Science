Super easy and my husband loved them.  Just add what you want and they come out perfect.  Hint, Doritos do not work well, the powder on them burns when put in the oven.

I had a graving for nachos and these where some of the best I had tried. I used different refried beans, but it was still great.

This was pretty good especially for how quick and easy it was to make.  I did not use Taco Bell brand beans or salsa.  Just used whatever brand I had on hand.   I was a bit skeptical about cooking these in the microwave but it worked out fine.  Dipped in extra salsa and sour cream.

Tastey. Always done the salsa but mixing in refired beans adds some fun. Always add hots and black olives. Yum!

Didin't use any toppings but served them with guacamole and salsa on the side. Went incredibly fast even if I had left them too long in the oven. Cannot imagine with the perfect timing!

This was easy but I thought it was a little dry. My family thought they were okay and they are easy for kids to make which is nice but I personally didn't care for them.

Really easy, pretty good but not great.
