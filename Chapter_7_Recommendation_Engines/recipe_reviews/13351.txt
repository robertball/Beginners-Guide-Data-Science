I read every single review (all 114) prior to making this soup, so I changed a few things.  It turned out wonderfully!!  Here's how I did it:  I diced two boneless, skinless chicken breasts and cooked them prior to starting with the olive oil, 2 cloves garlic and 1/2 cup diced onion.  Then I added 4 cans condensed chicken broth (many people said the soup was very thick - chili-like consistency, and I wanted more of a soup).  I also added a can of water (filled a broth can with water).  I added the crushed tomatoes (28 oz), the hominy (15 oz), the diced green chili peppers (4 oz), 1 tsp each of cumin (instead of oregano as many reviewers suggested), lime juice and garlic powder, and 1/2 tsp of chili powder.  I brought to a boil and let simmer for 1 hour (as others also suggested).  Top with shredded monterey jack cheese and garnish w/ tortilla chips.  EXCELLENT!  My husband said it tasted just like the chicken tortilla soup we'd had at Chili's - which was what I was aiming for!!  I think the sour cream would have been a good topping as well, maybe next time.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

My husband and I loved this soup - it tastes just like the chicken tortilla soup I've had at restaurants.  I made the following changes.  I first sauteed cut up chicken breast in a little olive oil, with salt and pepper and garlic powder, and then I shredded the chicken.  I used 4 cloves of garlic, because we love garlic!  I substituted 2 tsp of cumin for the oregano.  I added 2 cans of chicken broth and omitted the water.  I don't particularly like hominy, so I substituted 2 cups of frozen white corn.  And I didn't have any canned green chile peppers, so I used half a can of diced jalepenos.  I topped off the soup with Monterey Jack Cheese, crushed tortilla chips, fresh minced Cilantro and a little sour cream .  It was wonderful!  I served the soup with Mexican cornbread (basically cornbread mix to which I added diced jalepenos and 1 1/2 cups of Monterey Jack).  I definitely be making this soup again !

I can't say enough good things about this recipe!! Suffice to say that I've made it at least 6 times in the past several months.  It's such a good, hearty soup, and so easy to make. I've made it for friends several times and EVERYONE has asked for the recipe. Here's what I've learned: 
1) Make sure you use FRESH cilantro.  It truly does make a difference.
2) I bake the chicken and chop it up (rather than shredding) using my Pampered Chef hand chopper. REALLY fast and much easier than shredding.
3) Eliminate the water and use another can of chicken broth instead.
4) Omit the oregano - use 1 teaspoon of cumin (as others suggested) instead.
5) Rather than shredding Monteray Jack, I find that Kraft shredded Mexican cheese works just as well and is easier/faster.
6) I've never had a ripe avacado on hand, and though I'm sure it would be good, it's not necessary because this soup is already delicious. 7)I add sour cream as an additional garnish.

Not sure if people are rating this recipe based on their personal revisions, but as written this recipe does not deliver. It's too watery, it needs more time to cook, and it completely lacks in spice/flavor. Luckily I had a couple ingredients on hand to fix it, and the end result was wonderful and the whole family asked to have it again (soon). So I will share my changes:  1) Use shredded chicken - it's more like what you'd get in a restaurant. 2) Let this soup simmer in a crock pot - I did it on low for a total of 5 hours. It thickens the soup and helps the flavors blend. 3) Substitute the water for chicken broth (I used a total of 3 cups of broth). 4) Skip the hominy - one cup of corn is enough. Add an extra 4oz can of green chilis.  5) ADD A PACKET OF TACO SEASONING (I had McCormick's on hand) and increase the chili powder by 1 tsp. Add a sprinkle of cumin and a little salt (or garlic salt). 6) Add 8-10 finely crushed tortilla chips (baked are ok) into the soup (they'll cook down so you won't have crunchy bites but they add a good flavor - it is TORTILLA soup, right?) 7) After simmering for 4 1/2 hours, stir in 1/2 cup of sour cream. Continue to simmer for 30 minutes. This is what really puts the soup over the top and gives is a creamy texture similar to what I've had in most restaurants. 8) Serve with diced avocado, shredded cheese, and more tortilla chips for crumbling.  End result - awesome!

Not like the tortilla soup I had in Mexico, but very good with some changes other reviewers suggested. I started with the base and it tasted bland so I added cumin and more chili powder (salt and pepper to taste) and let this simmer (after only 10 minutes the tomatoes still taste raw). I recommend an hour.  Towards the end, add the chicken and beans-they only need to be heated through.  I have no clue what condensed chicken broth is, so I used regular broth. I ended up adding 2 more cups of chicken broth, as it was too thick. Topped with cheese, tortilla chips, Franks hot sauce and sour cream and it was pretty and delicious!

So delicious!!  I only gave this four stars because this is the second time I've made it; the first time I followed the recipe exactly but this time I modified it slightly.  My changes made it even better!  I used a pre-cooked chicken, omitted the oregano and cilantro, added 1 tsp cumin, and used 1 tsp regular chile powder plus 1 tsp ancho chile powder.  It was aMAzing!!  I STRONGLY recommend the ancho chile powder to those who can find it...it gave it such an awesome flavor!  Next time I may just use all ancho and none of the regular...  Will DEFINITELY make again!!

GREAT - We are big soup lovers and make many kinds of soup all year round. My husband, son and I love this soup. I have made this soup at least 4 times over the last year. I usually double the recipe and saute the chicken breasts in a little olive oil with garlic powder and black pepper then shred before adding to the soup just before the simmering step. I also use additional chicken broth instead of water and add 1 jar of salsa. Sometimes I add hominy, sometimes not. I also add cumin and some lemon juice to taste. HOWEVER, I always let the soup simmer for at least a hour or more on low heat to let the flavors come together. This makes it even better the next day. This is very good topped with sour cream, chopped green onions and shredded cheddar or pepper jack cheese.

We loved this soup!  I didn't add the oregano because that seems like an Italian herb.  Instead I added cumin.  Be sure to use crushed tomatoes and not whole or chopped.  The crushed is thicker, the others are too watery.

Excellent lightly spicy soup, Star! I think the base flavor needed "something" though. The oregano was a little too prominent, to me. I added 1/4 cup red wine (boil off the alcohol for a few minutes) Did the trick. WAY GREAT! Oh, and I thought it needed to be cooked a little LONGER (10-15 minutes, simmering) to blend flavors.  If you do, don't add the (we prefer slightly shredded to chunks)chicken until last few minutes or it will be "mushy". If you like chili and chicken TRY THIS RECIPE. You won't even need the toppings-great without too!

This is the best recipe I have found on Allrecipes.com so far.

Simply tremendous.  It's so good, I don't bring it to family functions because I want it to be all mine!

When people say this is restuarant quality, they actually mean it.

Added a teaspoon of cumino and omitted hominy.  Used fresh chicken broth and added salt for balance.  Tasted better the next day.  Overall - a great recipe.

Instead of part water, I used part chicken broth and part tomato sauce. I wanted more flavor in my soup, I didn't want it watered down. After  it'd cooked for a while I tasted it, then I added in more of the spices (I used ground california chili powder instead of regular chili powder so it would be the same flavor but less heat behind it), including the cilantro and I added a teaspoon or so of cumin. It really did more spices. This was okay. A good throw together soup but I think I really was expecting more.

I don't like to review recipes based on the substitutions/additions that I made, but it was difficult to even consider giving this less than 5 stars! For all the chicken tortilla soup recipes out there, I came to this one b/c I had most of the items on hand. I had every intention of making a ton so that I'd have leftovers to freeze, but alas, it was all gobbled up!! I'll go ahead and mention what I changed, but in all honesty, I imagine this recipe as written is just as wonderful as all of the suggestions that all of the other reviewers made. I omitted hominy and used only a can of Mexi-corn. I sauteed 1 chopped bell pepper w/ the garlic and onion, and used a 28 oz. can diced, not crushed tomatos. Passed on the oregano and instead added a packet of taco seasoning. I also shredded the chicken, rather than dicing. I had my soup in the crock-pot on low for 8 hours, and added a healthy handful of cilantro in the last half-hour, along with a generous splash of sherry. (Sherry + black beans = THE YUM!) Anyways, THANK YOU for a wonderful recipe, regardless of my wee changes!! *Munch munch slurp slurp. I

So good! But I recommend these tweaks: use 1 heaping Tbsp chili powder, 1 tsp oregano, and 1-2 tsp cumin. LIME juice is a bright, refreshing addition. Fresh cilantro is a must. The toppings really make the dish. Also, I added several dashes of hot sauce and a Tbsp of pickled jalapeno for kick (the green chiles are not spicy).
Idea: save your canned chicken broth. Boil the chicken breasts in enough water to cover plus a couple inches until no longer pink in the middle. Then just use that liquid for your stock! No sodium, no extra cost.

Excellent!  You must use fresh corn and top with the avacado.  We've had this many times since I found this recipe.  Love the hominy too.  Thanks!

I have my own version of this recipe that's similar and excellent.  If you don't have all of the spices, a packet of enchilada sauce seasoning is cheap, quick and easy and adds the perfect flavor to the soup.

I have to give it 5 stars, because even though I made some changes, they were very minor and just my preference. I am confident the original recipe would have been just as wonderful :). I omitted the hommony completely, added 2 cups of chicken broth, added 1 package of taco seasoning mix, used 1 can of rotell tomates and 1 can of chopped tomatoes and omitted the green chili peppers. I topped with cheese and crushed tortilla chips when served and it was out of this world. A keeper for sure...Thank you for sharing!

Wonderful soup.  Not like the first chicken tortilla soup I had in Mexico, but the best this side of the border.  I actually cooked my chicken breasts in the onions, garlic, and tomatoes until cooked then took them out, chopped/shredded, and returned to the pot.  Alterations: I used what I had on hand (no hominey), frozen corn, my grandma's canned stewed tomatoes, canned jalapenos, and crushed blue corn chips on top.  Don't skimp on the black beans or corn!  Very filling and very tasty.

Mmmmm We had this tonight; it's very filling and I felt like I was having a healthy soup.   I did make a few alterations to the recipe which I believe made it easier and just as tasty.  I used all broth (no water) threw everything in the broth (skipped the oil) but used garlic powder and onion powder.  I also threw in the chopped raw chicken after it had simmered 10 minutes and let simmer another 10 on low... :0)  Even my youngest liked the hominy and he's the picky one!  I skipped the corn and used a large can of hominy.

Loved this soup!  I read the reviews and made some changes as well.  No oregano, no hominy--a little more corn, added 1 tsp cumin, no water--chicken broth instead.  The biggest change was with the canned crushed tomatoes.  I thought I had some in the pantry--but NO!  I didn't....quickly did an inventory of potential substitutes.  I added two cans of Rotel tomatoes (which are tomatoes and chopped green chilis), omitted the can of green chilis, ended up adding a 16 oz can of tomato sauce to give a little more tomato flavor and body.  This was delicious!!  I garnished it with grated cheese (mexican blend), crushed cornchips, sour cream, chopped green onions and fresh cilantro.  This recipe is a keeper!

Great soup! I did add more broth (1 qt homemade). Also a little cumin and about a half can of diced jalapenos. Plus a little Adobo seasoning. Delicious! This is a keeper!

Great recipe! I followed the advice of others and added both cumin and lime juice. Also, I used fresh corn which enhanced the flavor a bit more. We garnished with blue corn tortilla chips, cheese, cilantro, and sour cream. Yum...Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This is a really good recipe!  Made this for my bf and I yesterday.  It hit the spot on a chilly Chicago night :)  Here's what I did to modify it / make it my own:  a) I subbed a bag (used nearly entire bag) of fiesta mix - seasoned onion, corn, green bell pepper & black beans for an onion and cans of beans & corn, b) subbed 1 t. of cumin for oregano, c) used half of a 28 oz. can of crushed tomatoes AND a 14.5 oz. can of diced tomatoes & green chilies, d) omitted can of green chilies (didn't need them since they were mixed in with the tomatoes), e) used 2 (14.5 oz.) cans of chicken broth (we do not care for thick soups), & f) sliced a small lime & squeezed half of it in the pot before serving (this gives the soup a nice zippy twist!).  I think that next time, I'll cube one more chicken breast (just didn't seem like there was enough meat in the soup), use a whole can of hominy (again, 1 c. was not enough) and up the spices a bit by adding some cayenne or a dash or two of hot pepper sauce.  In case your wondering... hominy tastes (and smells) a lot like a corn tortilla and is barely noticeable in the soup - try it!  Thanks!!!

Very nice - everyone ate it.  a great use for leftover cooked chicken, and would probably work just as well with turkey.  Will try it with hominey sometime, but extra frozen corn worked well too.

Another recipe to add to my keeper file.  This is good, thick soup the way I like it.  I used a can of chicken broth and didn't add any water.  I do think that cumin would be a good addition.

Delicious!  Used 2 cups of frozen corn (no hominy), 2 cans chicken broth, omitted water & beans, 2 T cumin instead of 1 T oregano, added a few chopped jarred jalapenos instead of green chiles, cut 2 chicken breasts into small pieces and sprinkled w/ salt & pepper & garlic powder & sauteed in olive oil while onions and garlic sauteed.

This was delicious.  I grilled a whole beer can jerk chicken the night before.  I removed the bones and skin from the breasts and thighs and used that as my chicken for the soup.  I then boiled the leftover bones and any skin in about 6 cups of water and let it simmer.  I then used about 2.5 cups of the seasoned water for my broth.  The grilled jerk chicken flavored water gave it awesome flavor.  I did not have any canned tomatoes so I used a jar of hot salsa.  No hominy but doubled the corn, added some lime juice.  I am sure that this recipe was good before but these changes made it awesome along with the accompanyments mentioned in the recipe.

This soup is wonderful, I make it more often than any other soup. I freeze chunks of cooked chicken in 2c portions, which is ideal for this recipe, they don't even need to be thawed first. I do add more liquid (usually broth) for consistancy, which is just preference. Healthy and flavorful, I'm so happy you posted this!

I have fallen in love with chicken tortilla soup lately and came here to find out how to make it myself. (At $5 a pop at the local restaurant, it was getting pricey!)  My husband declared this is the best soup EVER.  I love it because it is hearty with the beans and hominy- more of a meal soup than just a side dish.  I quadrupled the recipe and have 3 ziplock bags for the freezer.  Delish. Delish. Delish!

We loved everything about it.  After many bites my husband was still saying "yum" after each bite. I made it exactly as written.  I think the hominy adds something special.  We topped our bowls with diced avocado, crushed tortilla chips, and some cheese.

Fabuloso!  I had a ton of bone-in chicken breast in the freezer and this recipe had great reviews and it did not let me down.

My changes/additions:  I added 1 chopped jalapeno pepper (sauteed it with the onion and garlic), 1 t. cumin, 1 chipotle pepper in adobo sauce (chopped), and instead of regular corn I used a whole bag Hanover Latino Mix Corn (frozen food section).  The Latino mix has corn, green peppers, onions, and black beans.

As a result of my changes the soup was spicy, but still bearable (we love spice in this house).  My husband doesn't like fresh cilantro, but I added it anyway and he says it gives the soup a fresh taste.

This soup is quick, easy, and affordable.  It's also pretty healthy and can be made with mostly pantry ingredients.

I'm serving ours with cornbread... the soup was so good that I had to write a review before the cornbread got out of the oven.  Can't wait to eat the leftovers for lunch at work!

This recipe had a pretty good base.  I did wind up adding a lot more spices.  I put about 3 T of cumin in. I also added more chili pepper, deleted the cilantro,hominy and added about 2 cups of fresh corn.  I did not cook the corn first, I cooked it with the rest of ingredients minus the beans until the last minute.  I did add the lime and most of us thought that it was pretty tasty. Thanks Star!

This was a really enjoyable soup, and just as good the next day.  A lot of ingredients, but easy to put together.  I stirred a little sour cream into my last bowl and that was good, too.  Highly recommended.  Not a favorite with the kids, but they ate some.

GREAT SOUP! - as a Mexican, I know the tortilla soup (and love it) but I have never tried one with all these ingredients (no beans, corn or hominy in a tortilla soup, at least from where I am from!) BUT I overlooked that fact and I thought the ingredients were a good mix. I decided to give it a try and once you get over all the prep work (chopping onions is always a chore for me) it's pretty easy to make. I didn't have a large enough pot so I used one to cook the onions and garlic and mix the first ingredients (step 1) and bring it to a boil. Then I moved the soup to my slow cooker and added the rest of the ingredients. I let it cook at low temp for a while and it turned out delicious! Since I am mexican, we add lime to mostly all soups so I added some to my plate and it was yummy. Great recipe, will try again for sure! :)

Excellent, used a whole turkey breast (bone in) for the stock and meat, regular canned corn and more chili powder. I extened the simmer time as well.

I have made this over and over and over again...and it's one of our favorites.  And I can make this almost anytime because I always have the ingredients on hand (never add the hominy just because it's not something I keep in the kitchen.)  I always add a full 32 oz of chicken broth (never the condensed chicken broth) and omit the water altogether. Never add the Cilantro and never miss it!!  The longer it simmers the better for sure, but don't fret--even just 20 minutes makes for a very flavorful dinner.  Best recipe ever!

This recipe is delicious. Definitely use more broth about 4 cups, and twice as much garlic for a more authentic flavor.

This soup was amazing!! I made a few changes to the recipe, but for my husband and I, it was for the better :)  We added a can of enchilada sauce, used carrots instead of corn/hominy, added about a half of a can of evaporated milk to make it a little creamy, and some cayenne pepper to give it a kick...turned out awesome!!!

Fantastic recipe, I made it for a meeting (30 servings, the serving calculator made it a breeze) and picked up most ingredients at GFS.  They even had tri-color tortilla strips for the garnish, and frozen diced chicken which made the prep easy..  The only missing item was hominy (white corn comes in a can) which I picked up at the local grocery.  Many people asked for the recipe, a huge hit. I highly recommend this recipe!

I served this for an extended family gathering.  I thought this was a good recipC.  comments from my family were that the appearance warded them off ( I thought it looked fine personally), I also had comments that it needed more salt and that it was too watery.    Also comments were that it needed more heat!

This was simply delicious!  I omitted the oregano and replaced it with 2t of cumin.  I omitted the hominy (not a fan) and replaced it with an extra can of corn.  I used Del Monte's "Fiesta Corn" because I liked the addition of red & green bell peppers.  Used more chicken broth instead of water.  Added the juice of one lime.  Half of the juice was used to saute the chicken the other half was added into the soup.  Will be making this again really soon!

Great recipe but I change a little bit (1) I didn't use cilantro because I didn't have any and I think the cilantro have a really strong flavor which take way the soup flavor (2) I didn't use water just changed it for 20 oz of Chicken broth (3) I didn't have crush tomato so I used 1 jar of Classico traditional favorites Four Cheese tomato sauce (4) 1 can drained black beans (5) 1 can drained Pinto beans (6) 1 tablespoon of lemon juice (7) I use left over Turkey so everything ends delicious ! ! !

I like that this recipe is easy to alter to your own tastes. I did not follow it to a T but stayed darn close to the original. Didn't use hominy or avocado, lessened the oregano, and used about 6 cups of homemade chicken broth!  Boyfriend has been raving about this, and I enjoy it very much as well! What a good way to clear out your pantry! Makes delicious leftovers too. I definitely simmered my soup for at least an hour, I can't imagine cooking any sort of soup for only 20 minutes.

Wow! This is some amazing soup. I've used this site maybe 10 times now when I I need to quickly find a specific recipe that I can manage. My husband and I are Texans living in Melbourne, Australia, and I'm coming to this site more and more to find fabulous tastes from home. I only made changes due to lack of ingredients at our local store. We could not easily find "black beans" (canned) so we substituted the equivalent of whole refried beans (over here called "Mexican Beans) and that worked out great. We also used cumin instead of the oregano, and we added in one extra garlic clove and then a tsp of garlic powder. I threw in 2 tsp lemon juice right at the end as I kept reading the reviews. I agree that by simmering it for about an hour, by the time I made cornbread muffins and got everything ready, the flavours had really all come together and we garnished with crushed chips, sour cream, cheese and man was it great! This will surely be my new "go to" recipe for shared lunches at work, any time we want a hearty soup. I did also use the natural chicken broth from the chicken I boiled as well as other stock and it worked out great. Thanks for the great recipe!

Me and my kids really liked this soup.  I thought they'd see the green chilies & cilantro in there and wouldn't touch it but they did.  They were careful but loved the chicken, corn, beans and broth.  I used a box of chicken broth (no MSG) and added about a 1/4 cup water because I used 3 chicken breast instead of two.  I knew my kids would be mostly after the chicken.  I also didn't used hominy (didn't have it), added cumin, added Penzeys fajita seasoning, and little salt.  I used a can of original stewed tomotoes since I didn't have crushed and just ran them through my Magic Bullet with juice. (my kids don't like chuncks of tomato but like the flavor).  I didn't drain my can of corn either. Turned out great! I could have stood it a little spicier myself but I love heat, have to watch that with my kids though.  I will definitely make this again, it wasn't too time consuming or difficult. Oh and too, many may be surprised to find that oregano is used commonly in Mexican dishes, subtly, not like it is in Italian dishes, don't be scared to add it, it doesn't make this soup taste like spaghetti I promise.  Oregano is even one of the spices in my fajita seasoning along with basil, thyme, rosemary, marjoram, nutmeg, cumin, red pepper, celery, garlic, and s&p. Just an FYI...enjoy!

I made numerous changes and came up with a quick dinner that is quite tasty and uses ingredients we all tend to have on hand.  I started by using a full pound of boneless, skinless chicken breast cut into strips.  I browned it with garlic and seasonings and then shredded it in my food processor.  I doubled the onion, increased the chicken broth to 4 cans (eliminating the water), substituted 1 cup of medium salsa for the tomatoes (eliminating the oregano, cilantro and chilis).  I also cut the chili powder to a half-teaspoon and eliminated the hominy.  I'm afraid it was a completely different recipe by the time I finished but it was quite tasty and much easier to make with fewer ingredients.

In order to make it an actual "healthy" soup, I replaced the canned items with fresh ones... such as: make a puree from fresh tomatoes to replace the canned tomatoes, boiled black beans instead of canned beans, used real chicken broth instead of canned broth. Trust me, it makes a big difference in the taste when you use fresh ingredients!

I've never been a fan of the tortilla soup that you get in restaurants, but I wanted to try my hand at making it.  I am glad that I found this recipe. I took the suggestions of other reviewers and just used homemade chicken stock and threw in chipolte peppers instead of the green chiles. The first night it was ok, but it got sooo much better the longer it has sat.  It's delicious when topped with chopped tomato, avocado, shredded cheese and a little sour cream (what wouldn't?).

Very, very good.  Made this in my slow cooker because family is fighting colds and no one wants to cook.  First in slow cooker I put in black beans, green chilies, corn, 2 cans 14 oz chicken broth, 1/2 tsp each chili powder, oregano and cumin (omitted hominy, kids won't eat it and also omitted water) and substituted 14 oz can petite diced tomatoes for pureed tomatoes.  Then roasted onion, 2 cloves minced garlic and a yellow bell pepper in the oven at 350 degrees on a cookie sheet for 5-7 minutes, pureed and stirred into contents of the slowcooker.  Added frozen chicken breast and cooked on low for 6-8 hours.  Before serving removed chicken and shredded adding again to slowcooker with cilantro.  Garnished with the Baked Tortilla Chips from this site.  Such a relief to make something so good with little effort.  Thank you for this versatile recipe.  The aroma gave us something to look forward to all day.

OMG, this soup is fantastic!!!  I grilled my chicken with some Emeril steak seasoning (love the stuff) before chopping it up and putting it into the soup.  It was totally awesome.  I also must mention that my husband rated this soup in his top three favs of all time--a big complement!!!

This was really good. I bought and shredded one of those rotissarie chickens from the grocery store. I used all chicken broth instead of h20 and I didn't have black beans, so I used kidney beans instead. I never tried homeny before, so I used half the can. Next time I will def. use the whole can, it was good!

Delicious!  To make it even quicker and easier, I used frozen pre-cooked chicken, and for half of the tomatoes,I substituted  Rotel tomatoes with the green chilis and cilantro already in them rather than separately adding green chilis and fresh cilantro.

The soup is not bad. It is a good base.
I personally felt it was a bit lacking in taste.  

On my redo, I made some changes and came up with an excellent soup.  I added canned chicken instead of oven baked chicken, garlic powder, salt, fresh cracked pepper and a pinch of cumin.  I left the hominy and cilantro out and left the avacado and green onions off as well.  There are too many flavor-styles trying to be blended into this soup.  I could not tell if the original recipe was going for mexican, tex-mex or southwest.  Thank you for the recipe.

Really Good! Made a double batch, with intentions of freezing half, but it was gone before I could freeze any. We did not think this was spicy at all, might even add more spice in the future. I was alittle concerned about the hominy (since I have never used & it looked disgusting) but I added half the amount called for & actually it was good once cooked (also added a nice texture). Will use full amount next time. The only other thing I changed was I added 2tsp cumin like others suggested. The topping of cheese, chips, sour lean, g. onions, & avocado really added to this dish. My husband loved this! Thanks!!

This was really good.  Like others, I omitted the hominy and the beans (although I'll probably try it with the beans next time, but we were just tired of bean soups) and added celery which made it really crunchy.  Plus I added some of the chips to the soup while it was cooking which gives it a bit more flavor.  Really easy and really tasty.  Thanks for sharing, Star!

This soup was terrific and my family loved it. Next time I'll cut the hominy in half, as it made the soup a little too thick and I'll double the black beans. Delicious!

This was very yummy.  I suggest not adding the fresh cilantro until you serve it.  It lost it's fresh flavor.  I sprinkled it on with the cheese.  I also found it a bit bland and increased the seasonings and added red pepper powder.

Different than any other soups I've made before but excellent in its own right!  I basically made the recipe as is except I couldn't find hominy at my (Canadian) grocer.  To ensure max. taste I used (a) kernels from 4 fresh cobs and (b) beans made from scratch.  Since there seems to be a debate about the soup's thickness, I used concentrated chicken stock and added water to my liking.  Definitely will make again (and again).

I have tried this recipe a couple of times and as is, I wouldn't give it 5 stars, but with changes it is fabulous! Here are my changes...I diced up fresh tomatoes (anywhere from 2-4 tomatoes depending on how much of that flavor you want) instead of canned and they were perfectly ripe, so it worked! I also added in a fresh yellow and red bell pepper and added more chili powder and cumin. Those make it SO much more flavorful and yummy! I also used ALL chicken broth instead of any water (homemade from boiling the leftovers of a rotisserie chicken--so much better than the canned stuff!!), added about 2 tsp garlic salt, skipped the hominy and just put in corn. I added another 4 oz can of green chiles and stirred in some sour cream 1/2 hour before I served it (just like many other reviews suggested). I threw everything in the crockpot and let it cook for 5+ hours to let all the flavors come together. As soon as the chicken is cooked through, (about 3 hours into it), I take out the chicken, shred it with a knife and fork, and then put it back in to soak up some more flavor. Add crushed tortilla chips, cheese, sour cream, avocado, fresh cilantro to top it off and it's amazing!

Followed the recipe, except instead of water, I used all chicken broth. This was great! We all loved it. I will be making this again.

Made this last night and followed some suggestions from other reviews. You really can't go wrong with this recipe. Here are the changes I made. 64oz of chicken stock for the liquid, 28oz can of white hominy because that is what my store had, 2 cans of diced green chilies, 2 cans of corn and black beans, 1.5tsp cumin instead of oregano. After sauteing the onions and garlic I put everything into a large stock pot, brought it to a boil, then simmered for just over an hour. It was awesome! My 19yo son usually hates anything with chili powder and cumin and he asked me to put this in his college recipe binder so he can make it on his own.

One of our family favorites.  This makes our family winter rotation quite a few times as it's quick and easy. I will also use left over rotisserie chicken which is super flavorful. Thanks for a quick and easy weeknight recipe.

I left out the hominy and justed used 1 can of corn. It was delicious. i also added more chicken broth while it was cooking and some in with the leftovers as I wanted it more like a soup than a stew. It's a new regular soup here!

I have used this recipe for years and love it especially the hominy. My only suggestion is you may want  to leave out the green Chiles if you have small children or don't like it spicy. Thanks for a great recipe =)

This is an EXCELLENT, fast, healthy recipe that everyone raves about! I make this as directed, but I usually skip the hominy out of personal preference, and instead add extra beans. I keep the ingredients for this on hand at all times. After making this the first couple times and having tons of wilted cilantro afterward, I’ve started freezing my cilantro, and using just slightly more than the recipe calls for to compensate for (very minimal) flavor loss from freezing. This soup also freezes well, so I usually double the batch! One of my (and my family’s!) all time FAVORITE recipes!

A fabulous, thick and hearty soup!  Highly recommend, especially to use up leftover chicken.  I substituted one fresh jalapeño for the can of green chilies and regular chicken stock for the condensed broth and water because that is what I had on hand.  I used leftover chicken from the “Busy Day Chicken” recipe on this site.  I then prepared it exactly as directed.  After 15 minutes of simmering, I decided to add a little more spice for my taste.  I added in 2 teaspoons each of cumin and smoked paprika, plus one teaspoon ground coriander, and simmered for another hour.  I also had all of the optional toppings.  This recipe makes a large amount, and I thought I would be able to freeze the leftovers to have for quick lunches, but there were no leftovers!  My husband, who normally turns his nose up at soup loved it! We had unexpected company the next day and served the soup.  It was gobbled up with rave reviews!

Delicious and easy to make. Like so many others I did some tweaking (no water / all chicken broth, no oregano / add cumin, add Tabasco, salt and black pepper) but the base recipe still deserves a whole lot of credit. This recipe was so good I actually signed up here just to post this review. And having been a lurker her for many years, that says a lot.

I made it missing the cilantro and the chili peppers- and it is STILL delicious. I also added a box of chicken broth instead of the water and condensed chicken broth. I also found that cutting the chicken up into small bite size pieces, then cooking it in olive oil, salt and pepper- gave the chicken a great browning on each piece.

Excellent & Easy!! I made chicken stock with a whole chicken. Then, deboned the chicken and added it back to the stock. Added the chili pepper (i doubled the chili pepper) & some italian seasoning (didn't have oregano). Added one can corn, one can black beans, and two cans of tomatoes (14oz). Didn't have hominy. Topped with avocado, cheese, tortilla chips & sour cream. The soup was fabulous! This is a keeper!!

Simply yummy!  I made the changes many others suggested and omitted the oregano and added 2 tsp of cumin.  I used about 2oz of green chilies and it was rather spicy, however, if you like it hot, then you may want to add the whole 4oz can.  Other than those adjustments, I made it as written and it was so good!

This soup is fantastic and you can add anything you want. I made this two weeks in a row in the Crock Pot instead of on the stove. The first time I made it, the few changes I made were, of course, the cumin instead of oregano. That is a must. Second, I used all chicken broth, no water. (about 3 cans broth) I wanted more veggies so I added in a large, diced and sauteed zucchini. My boyfriend wanted me to make it the next week with EVEN MORE zucchini!!! It was a fantastic addition. I also sauteed my chicken breasts with the minced garlic, took the onion and blended it into a "sauce" and sauteed it with the chicken as well. Sometimes I add some green tamatillo salsa, some lime-juice, cayenne pepper... There are so many variations you can do. This recipe is awesome to make as is, or with whatever changes. You cannot go wrong.

This is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!! I read every alternate recipe and hundreds of reviews before making this. I found that a few tweeks made the flavor really pop and gave it that authentic Mexican heat that my family loves. First, the longer it cooks the better. I tenderized my chicken breast with a meat hammer in between wax paper and then put it on my George Foreman grill with salt and pepper until it was approx half way cooked (about 3 minutes) It makes the chicken melt in your mouth and much easier to dice into the soup. Instead of oregano I added 1 tsp cumin, 1 tsp garlic powder, 3 tsp lime juice. I didn't want an extra thick soup so adding 1 additional can of condensed chicken broth and an extra 1/2 cup water makes it just right. I added 1 4oz can of diced jalapenos peppers. I simmered this for 90  minutes before serving. A big dollop of sour cream on top gave this soup a perfect balance. Will definitely be adding this to my menu of regular dinners.

Also used 2 tsp. cumin for 1 tsp oregano, added more chicken broth and some sugar to cut the tomato taste.  The soup actually tasted better the next day.  My husband and I really enjoyed this soup.  Froze the leftovers for later.  Good soup!

Simply delicious. I used fresh corn, which I recommend if you're making this in the summer, and made the chicken soup base from scratch. I shredded the chicken that made the broth and put that in the soup, sans bone. I also incorporated changes from other reviewers (cumin in place of oregano), added lime juice, and extra cilantro, didn't add garlic, and scaled the soup up to 16 servings (I was making this for my boyfriend and his roommate because I was getting tired of eating subs for dinner every night). They loved it.

This was the best chicken tortilla soup! My husband couldn't stop raving about it!!! After reading all the reviews I made a couple changes. First I omitted the oregano (as others recommended). I also used 2 10oz cans of Ro-Tel tomatoes with green chiles instead of the crushed tomatoes and used additional taco seasoning along with the chili powder and added cumin. Also when I boiled the chicken I seasoned the water with Adobo and taco seasoning and used the broth from that instead of the water. Can't wait to make this for company!!

This was very good; thanks for a great recipe. I made this in a slow cooker - just dumped it all in (except for the hominy) and served with tortilla chips and chopped avacado ... yum :)

After reading the reviews I went with the following suggested changes and this soup was fantastic with little effort.  Saute diced chicken in olive oil with 5 cloves of fresh minced garlic and the chopped onion.  I transferred this mixture to a crock pot and added 1/2 tsp chili powder, substituted 1 tsp cumin for the oregoano, tomatoes, 1 14.5 oz can of chicken broth, 1 chicken buillon cube, 2 cups of water, 1 can of corn (drained), 1 can chopped green chilis, 1 can of rinsed/drained black beans, 1/4 c cilantro.  I let this simmer for 3 hours and served it topped with the chips, cheese, avacado and green onions.

Amazing soup! I did it as a main dish for dinner and everybody loved it! I added extra water since it looked more like a stew but overall... AMAZING! Definitely a do!

Wow, I love this recipe.  I have made it so many times, and I'm finally reviewing.  I like it exactly as is, but I LOVE to add other stuff.  My favorite things to add:  lime juice and/or vinegar, about 1/4 cup each, cumin and extra chili powder, pork instead of chicken if that's what I have leftover in the fridge, even potatoes and an extra can of beans if I'm going meatless.   I like to keep adding seasonings since I generally simmer it for quite a while.   Thank you for a terrific recipe!

Very tasty!  I have made this soup several times.  Instead of using canned chicken broth & water, I substitute by using 6 cups of my own broth made from cooking the chicken breasts.  I omitt the oregano and use 1 tsp. cumin instead & upped the chili powder to 3 tsp. and added salt.   I also omitt the hominy.   I simmer the onion, garlic, spices, tomatoes and chicken broth for 1 hour then add the corn, chiles, beans, and chicken and simmer for additional 20 min.  This soup tastes even better reheated the next day.

i have a similar recipe to this and i caompared them, i did not make a lot of changes however one thing my other recipe had that this one did not was adding lime juice to it. it just really brings out the flavors in this soup.I also used 5 cups chicken broth and omitted the water, it worked great I think it is one of my familys favorite and whenever i take it in as a meal to someone they rave about it.

Since moved far away from my favorite Mexican food restaurant that served great tortilla soup. I was forced to try and make my own.  This recipe is even better then the restaurants.  This is now one of my staple recipes.  I add about a teaspoon of liquid smoke to give the soup a smoked chicken taste.  Since the soup did turn out a bit thick for me, i added an extra can of chicken broth.

This is delicious!  I just throw everything in the crockpot (except the tortilla chips) and cook it for 7 hours on low.  Then I take out the chicken and shred it.  I use bought tortilla chips, put those on the bottom of the bowl and pour the soup on top and garnish with cilantro and avocado.  I did make a few substitutions: doubled the chicken stock, added a can of mexican salsa and used cumin instead of oregano.  I never have any leftovers!

I was totally disappointed with this recipe.  I didn't think it tasted like a very good chicken tortilla.  It was more of just a tomato soup with some chicken and a few veggies added.  This was definitely not the style of chiken tortilla I was hoping for.

This was so delicious!  I took other reviews advise and substituted the oregano for the cumin.  I also used plain chicken broth instead of the water and doubled the corn as I didn't have hominy.  It was so easy, smelled amazing while cooking and tasted incredible.  It was a huge hit and I will definitely make it again!!

I love tortilla soup. My favorite is from On the Border. I had hoped that this recipe would be as good as their's is, but it was better! I never eat leftovers, but I put this away in the fridge and it was all eaten! My mother in law loved it as well and froze some to take with her for lunch during the week.

My guests loved this soup, but I wasn't crazy about it--"too tomato-y".  I think I will spice it up a little more next time and use a little more chicken.  But I will definately make it again.

This was excellent.  I followed the directions exactly...only I added a bit of cumin too.  I do think the avocado on top is key and wish I would have bought a lime to squeeze on top.  Will next time.

I made chicken tortilla soup a few months ago, but without tomatoes, so this was fun to try.  this was a fabulous recipe, but even better b/c i added chilis in adobo sauce (instead of chili powder), cumin, and crushed up tortilla chips right to the soup (this added the thickness that i'm guessing the hominy is supposed to do)  oh, also i did zest and juice of lime.   my boyfriend says i could sell this one to a restaurant down the street!

EXCELLENT! This was a great soup and you can cater it to your own taste. I used three chicken breasts instead of two, and seasoned the chicken w/ some fajiata seasoning, salt and pepper before I cooked it. I first sauteed onions and some green bellpeppers and added the chicken to cook. (like others) I addeded two cans of chicken broth (and didn't use water), used cumin instead of oregano. I also added a one sliced jalepeno and some tabasco sauce for some kick. I put all the ingredients in together and left it on the stove on low for one hour and it came out great! I served it with packaged mexcian cornbread it was a big hit!!

This recipe was even better than I expected it to be!  Very, very yummy!  I made a few changes:  I used regular chicken broth in place of the condensed chicken broth and water since my supermarket doesn't carry condensed chicken broth.  I also had to omit hominy, so I doubled the corn amount, again because I couldn't find it.  Otherwise I followed the recipe, delicious!  Well, except I omitted the cilantro due to personal preference.  Thanks for the delightful recipe!

great recipe. i used muir glen roasted tomatoes which gave it a nice smoky flavor. i took others advise and used chicken broth instead of water and cumin instead of oregano. i also put in all ingredients except chicken, after sauteing the onion and garlic, and let cook for about 2 hours. then used my cuisinart hand blender in the pot for a few seconds to give it a slightly less chunky texture. then added shredded store bought 1/2 roasted chicken. served with avocado, shredded cheese, scallions and crushed tortilla chips on top. very nice. i will make again.

I made a double batch of this soup to serve about 12 people. Every one of them raved. The only things I changed were to use cumin in place of oregano and add more chicken. The soup came out very thick and hearty--I let it simmer for quite a while because the rest of the meal wasn't done yet. I think this helped the flavors blend better and made the soup thicker.

This would be super-easy to make vegeterian as I intend to do next time.

We made this dish for our Super Bowl get together. It was a hit! We served it along with pepperjack/cheddar quesadillas, cornbread, and chips and salsa. Great menu! The only modifications that I made were to substitute 2 tsp. of cumin instead of oregano, ommitted the corn and hominy (my husband is not a fan), and doubled the amount of chicken broth. We will make again.

This is a good quick soup. I cheated and used rotisserie chicken. I also added more chicken broth(another can), because I though it was more like a chili than a soup.

Yummy, absoultely perfect. The only thing I changed was I cooked the chicken in lemon juice before I put it in the soup. I also think I may try it over some rice as well. But awesome recipe- all my friends loved it.!

So YUMMY!!!  My husband just loved it.  I did make some minor changes.  I cooked it in a slow cooker all day so the flavors could blend and a added two jalapones with seeds in for more spice.  The only other thing I will change next time I make it is to add some lime juice.  This is an awesome recipe!!!

Upon returning from a week vacationing in Mexico, my family and I were not yet ready to give up the week long trend of out of this world mexican food! So, as we arrived home late that evening, I looked to allrecipes.com for that special "quick & easy" soup. This one hit the spot!Didn't change a thing. Definately a big hit in my home. We'll keep this one around. Thank you Star Pooley for submitting this delighful dish.

Why didn't I make this sooner?!?!  My son and husband loved it and it was so easy and fast to prepare.  I boiled the chicken with onions, carrots, celery and garlic.  I then boiled down the stock to a wonderful rich brown broth and used that instead of the canned broth.  We did add light sour cream to the garnishes as well.  This is going to be a staple around here now.  Next time I'm going to double the recipe and freeze it!

Loved it. Not spicy at all. Next time I will use 1 14oz. can of crushed tomatoes and 1 can Ro-Tel to spice it up. I also used 3 cans regular chicken broth instead of condensed broth.

You will never believe a soup that is so easy can be this good!  I would recommend adding a 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder to give it a little more seasoning.

This soup is awesome.  It has become part of my regular recipe collection.  I have substituted pinto beans for the black beans and it is still just as good. Unlike many of the reviewers, I really like the hominy too, adds a nice texture. It is so much better the next day, that I would almost advise making it a day ahead and reheating.

I have made this several times, always using leftover chicken. When making chicken fajitas, grilled chicken, or even parmesan chicken, I always cook two extra breasts so I can use them the next day in this wonderful soup. When we really want to spice it up, we use Del Monte's Fresh Cut tomatoes with Mexican seasoning, which adults like but is a little too hot for my kids' tastes. Another time saver: we've used Tyson's Time Trimmer chicken with the southwest seasoning - precooked, preseasoned chicken already cut into small strips, which we then just tear into smaller bite-sized pieces. You can find it in the freezer section of the grocery store. A great recipe, Star!

I made this soup for a soup & salad luncheon at my office.  It was a big hit and I'm still handing out copies of the recipe.  I put it in a slow cooker after everything was cooked, and the flavors really blended together well.  Some people thought it was a little hot, though!

Here is how to get the most flavor from your soup.  Saute onion, add two or three or more tablespoons of mild chile powder, pinch of Greek oregano, pinch of cumin (1/4 tsp) and 1/4 tsp. of cocoa powder. (no garlic)
Mix all the spices together and put them in with the onions after they have turned transparent to make a roux.  Heat this mixture for 2 or 3 minutes to release the flavors.
Add the chicken so that is picks up the spices.
Add the chicken broth.  I use Better Than Broth chicken paste or homemade, 1 tsp of paste to one cup of water.
Cover and simmer for 30 minutes so the spices will dissolve properly and the flavors marry.
Garnish with chopped fresh cilantro.
Add no tomatoes until the end of cooking.  The acid in the tomatoes prevents proper cooking.
Personally, I don't use any tomatoes for a more traditional Mexican soup.
This is a good base for albondigas (meatball soup).  I will be making this tonight.

Great recipe!!  This is a keeper for my family!  Even my pickiest eater loved it!  After reading several reviews, I decided against adding the oregano and subbed 1-1/2 tsp. of cumin.  I also added 1/2 tsp chipotle powder in addition to the chili powder.  I didn't have crushed tomatoes on hand so I used peeled whole tomatoes and hit them with the immersion blender.  It didn't yield quite the same thickness I would have liked but this was still wonderful in flavor.

Delicious! We like spicy so we added the following. Half a jalapeno chopped, half teaspoon cumin and half a teaspoon Goya as well as a sprinkle of cayenne pepper. I used red onion instead of white. I was shocked at how good it turned out the first time.

I didn't make the recipe as written after reading many reviews.  I made some changes, and the soup is wonderful!  Everyone in my family said it was really good - and that's a victory!  Here are the changes:  1) used two cans condensed chicken broth, plus the juice from the baked chicken  2)  did NOT add water  3) replaced oregano with 1 tsp. cumin  4) used only 1/2 tsp. chili powder  5) used one 14 oz. can diced tomatoes and one 10 oz can Rotel Mexican LIme & Cilantro - pureed in blender  6) Did not use hominy - didnt miss it  7)  Added lime juice - didnt measure, but it was about 1 -1.5 tsp  8)  Added about 1/2 cup plain yogurt at the very end - then let it simmer about 1.5 hours.  Do NOT allow soup to boil once yogurt is added.    This was so good -  i will be making this again, very soon !

I love, love, love this soup.  I did add cumin as several reviewers suggested.  And I do use chicken broth instead of water.  Overall, though, I find this to be an amazingly versatile recipe.  I have made alterations when I did not have the exact ingredients on hand.  For example, I have used hominy instead of black beans.  And I have even tried it with Goya pink beans.  My suggestion is, stick to the recipe as much as possible.  If there is an ingredient that you don't care for, make adjustments as you go.  In my opinion, the toppings contribute a lot to the overall flavor.  So don't omit them.  Enjoy!!

Absolutely LOVED this recipe. I looked at the other reviews and changed some things, too, to make it just right. Instead of one can of chicken broth, I used a 48 oz container of it for a perfect consistency. I also added a little more cilantro to taste, because you can never have enough cilantro in my house. :) Also, I used a can of Rotel instead of chile peppers for a little more flavor, and a whole bag of frozen corn instead of hominy. If you like a little kick, you also HAVE to add a couple tablespoons of chopped jalepenos (depending on how spicy you want the soup.) Garnish with avocado and a squeeze of lime, and it is the PERFECT soup. Better than any restaurant, and even better when heated up the next day. Enjoy!!

I good basic recipe that you can easily tweak to fit your own tastes. Read the most helpful reviews for some great tips on improving this recipe. I tried chick peas instead of hominy-won't use them next time too crunchy. I do strongly suggest using fresh corn when in season not that time consuming to take it off the cob and taste is awesome. Do watch how much green onions you add at the end-they overpower the flavors. Don't tell anyone( I am Wisconsin born) but the cheese made this soup too rich for me. I did squeeze fresh time over this soup before eating and next time wont use the tortilla strips-they got soggy fast and didn't add much flavor. Again use the flavors and ingredients you enjoy when making this and you will be sure to love it.

After about a year of looking over this recipe, I finally decided to make it. I read and re-read most of the reviews. From there a made a few small variations. Like most, I opted out of the oregeno and used cumin instead. I also added ancho pepper for a nice kick on the back end. I substituted water for strictly broth,using 4 cups in all. Finally, I diced onions, green peppers, garlic and green chiles, placed them in a small amount of olive oil and sauteeed. I added my chicken (seasoned with salt and pepper) and broth and let cook until chicken was perfectly tender. After reading the reviews, I decided to combine the broth, corn, tomatoes (I used Rotel), chiles, black beans and seasonings in a stock pot and let boil until my chicken was finished. Garnished with  cheese, avacado, green onions and tortilla chips; my husband and children LOVED it! This is definitely a house favorite now!

like the ingredients and recipe trail to the final ending point. Like any other recipe on here, you typically have to adjust to your taste.

I used a little less than a 1/4 cup of cilantro, added more water because like other suggested really thick, used less chicken broth, added half cup more corn, did not use hominy at all and replaced oregano with cumin. I also added a like 1 tablespoon of sugar, some additional garlic and some black pepper to bring it all together. I topped with a few zesty tortilla chips and a little sour cream. My 4 year old and husband both loved! 4 stars because I had to tweak to bring out the flavors in the background. Will definitely make again, and will make a larger pot next time.

I've made this twice now and loved it both times, though it isn't quite the flavor I was looking for (like the soups in the restaurants).  This is more like a stew. Used hot green chiles for a little spice and love the hominy in this.  Since I didn't have anything else to do with the rest of the cans, used 1 whole can of corn and 1 whole can of each.  Since the soup doesn't simmer that long, the cilantro is very strong flavored (it doesn't have time to mellow, so if you don't like cilantro, leave it out - tastes just as great without it!).  Used 3 chicken breasts (just poached and hand-shredded) and could have even used another.  Replaced the water with the broth from poaching the chicken.  Pretty quick to throw together with some great flavor! Might throw in a teaspoon of cumin next time.

Though good, the hominy could be left out of this dish. The up-side of including hominy in this soup is that it helps make more soup.

Family loved it!  This is a super base recipe!  Used left over cooked chicken and doubled the hominy, and corn (used 1 can, drained).  Also, added more chicken stock and 1tsp of cumin along with the oregano.  Topped with crushed tortilla chips and shredded cheddar.  Fast, easy and healthy.

This is a wonderful dish. This has a great flavor. The  changes I made was to grill the chicken seasoned with some salt pepper and lime. I also toasted some tortillas on an iron skillet and cut them into triangles for topping and extra dipping.

Looking for a quick dinner at 8pm and this came together in a flash.  Had to improvise with a 28oz can of tomato sauce instead of tomatoes but the flavors were fantastic.  Took all of 20 minutes to make too.  I threw the chopped up raw chicken in with the onions and garlic then finished cooking it in the broth.

This soup has phenomenal Flavor!!!  I really followed the recipe, I just didn't have hominy on hand so I added the whole can of corn.  Also, I used some frozen already cooked and sliced chicken breast chunks as a time saver.  Next time I cook a whole chicken this will definitely be a go to recipe for a fabulous way to use chicken leftovers!!!

Based on other reviews I changed things a little. I used 1 tbsp chili powder, 1/2 tbsp cumin, and the oregano. I added the spices to the onions and garlic just before I added the tomatoes so that the spices could toast a little. I used a box of chicken stock and 2 cups of fire roasted corn from Trader Joe's and skipped the hominy. I let it simmer together for about 20-30 minutes then added pre cooked pollo asada and the can of rinsed beans. To finish it off, I squeezed about half a lemon into it and stirred in a handful of chopped cillantro. Topped with reduced fat cheddar cheese and a little diced avacado. Super good! It's also weight watchers friendly at about 11 pps per bowl with the cheese and avacado.

tried this for the first time. Really liked it. But had to add more cayenne pepper and ramp up the heat. But that might be a personal preference as I like food very spicy. Will definitely be making this again!

My family's absolute favorite soup!!  This is so easy and delicious!  Only omitted oregano and hominy, but didn't add anything -- just extra of what's already in it : )  Well worth trying!

This recipe was great!  I made the recipe pretty much as shown, and I thought, "Hmmm...that's really good!"  Then I added some generous squeezes of lime juice, tasted it, and thought, "Oh, my word!  This is outrageous!"  I can't wait for my husband to try this--and the recipe is certainly worthy of serving to guests you want to impress!  (My changes--instead of concentrated broth and water, I used straight broth, most of which came off the chicken I stewed.  Also, I added the entire can of hominy--Bush's is my favorite brand.  And, I needed to use up some left-over crispy taco shells, so I used them as a topper.  Yummmmmm!

This is an excellent recipe! I made it as is, except to fiddle with the saltiness by adding some chicken bouillon granules. Thanks for the great recipe! :)

I make this soup without the oregano & hominy. I typically use cilantro that is can buy in a refrigerated tube as to not waste the leftover. Everyone loves it and I have passed the recipe on to many who have eaten it and asked for the recipe. It is the easiest soup out there. Open a bunch of cans!

A couple of days ago, I cooked this soup and my 9-year-old son and my husband (not my 4-year-old daughter who is very picky! :( )and I raved over this delicious and spicy soup!  I read other reviews, I used the cumin instead of oregano and It worked perfectly and wonderfully for the flavor.  I move this recipe to my recipes box as I want to make it once a month and it is one of our favorite meals!!  Thank you so much for this recipe!! Two Big Thumbs!!! 

P.S. my daughter is like my son when he was her age and I know she will love it when she gets a ttle older.

Yummy and EASY!! I didn't use water, used all chicken stock.  I also used diced canned tomatoes instead of crushed tomatoes because that's all I had and it was delicious!  I bought chicken breast, boiled it with some garlic, then shredded it.  Great chunky, hearty soup!  Will be making again and again!

Good recipe but i believe my changes made it great thanks to listening to other reviews

1) I uped the veg by starting with a holy trinity instead (onion, celery and green pepper - 1 cup each) sauteed in butter and EVOO for 20 - 30 minutes

2) then seasoning - I used (1 tsp each) Chili powder, Ground cumin & Oregano 

3) I added 3 cups homemade stock & no water and 1 can crushed tomatoes & simmered very low for 20 - 30 minutes

4) Then I added turkey (leftover from Thanksgiving), green chilies, corn, black beans and cilantro - sorry no hominy (I live in the sticks) & simmered very low for 20 minutes 

5) I garnished with sour cream, lime wedge, cilantro and picked jalapenos

This is absolutely delicious.  I love all the veggies - I use the entire can of corn and hominy.  I add a sqeeze of fresh lime juice on each serving, and this gives the broth such a great flavor.  Also, frying your own corn tortilla strips is totally work the extra effort.  Their texture hold up so much better than plain chips.

I use already frozen chicken fajita strips, add a green bell pepper to onion and garlic when sautéing, and also add one can of Rotel HOT with Habeneros. Super good flavor! For the chips, I add Doritos Taco Flavor. I love this recipe!

Wonderful!  I made this with chicken from a bland recipe I made the night before - totally redeemed the chicken.  I am a novice cook and I think this recipe is very forgiving and easy with subsitutions if you don't have something on hand.

I made this recipe as per the instructions. When the soup was done I felt that it lacked flavor. I added an additional tsp of chili powder and 1 tsp ground cumin. With those additions I thought it was a very good soup and I will make it again.

This turned out pretty good. Things I didn't add was hominy, green chile peppers, cilantro because I didn't have them. I did however add the whole can of corn with everything else & cumin and garlic powder. Topped with the tortilla chips, sour cream, and cheese!

My son had had Chicken tortilla soup at a local restaurant, and could not stop talking about it. I decided to surprise him with that same soup at home, and when he tasted this recipe, he said "This tastes exactly like the restaurants!!" Thank you so much for letting me use this recipe, it is now a monthly dinner dish:)
 I did make one change however, per a review, I changed the oregano, to cumin:)

Easy to make, very tasty!  I use one of those larger cardboard rectangular chicken broth boxes and no water.  Also used cumin instead of oregano, though Mexican oregano would be fine.  Nums!

I didn't see a chicken dish in my recipe box I felt like having, so when I came to this, I started cooking. I just used water, and poured some half & half to make it creamy, and added some thickener as well. Poured in some left over frozen carrots and peas, OH! picky daughter gobbled hers down and hubby polished it off. Nice touch with the chips! Mmmm-mmmmm!

I am mexican, raised here in america. I love it! it was so easy to make and the flavors came together so nicely. I didn't find tortilla strips (which I could had made my self) but I wanted it quick and simple so I just bought the wheat tortilla chips threw them in, the wheat tortilla chips gave it even better taste (like a cherry on a sundae)

This recipe is wonderful!  I did put in 4 cups chicken broth and mixed in 1 tbsp cornmeal (masa) with 1/2 c. hot water-poured that in and topped with red onion-not green.   Perfect for everyone!  I will be making this again and again!!  Thanks for posting :)

Dee-lish! Made a few adjustments though. Didnt have dried oregano so used ground oregano (1/2 teaspoon) didn't use hominy, chile peppers, or green onions. I'm a 'texture' eater so I blended the stock before adding the chicken. Used red kidney beans in place of hominy. If you're making this to freeze, brown beans tend to get a little mushy when you reheat it.

Not much to add after 800+ reviews, it's wonderful and easy to customize to suit tastes and available ingredients.  Personally love the hominy in this.  Thanks!

This soup got rave reviews from my family.  
My picky eater loved this and asked for more. 

It is very mild and surprisingly not salty considering I used canned chicken instead of chicken breast. 

We put sour cream, shredded cheese, green onions, and avocados as garnish so that those who didn't want certain items could choose.

omitted green chillis,green onions, hominey and used pinto vs black beans - these changes weren't intentional- I justed used what I had on hand- Still turned out great- the husband really loved it- I added alittle taco seasoning and that did give it a spicy kick! Very quick and easy!

I followed this recipe to the letter, and it came out great! I served it at a party, and it was the first thing to go. Even people who don't necessarily like soup enjoyed it. This is now one of my favorite recipes, and I'll definitely be making it again!

This was terrific!  Very easy and very pretty when topped with some sour cream and fresh cilantro.   I froze some (without the tortillas) and will use later.  Good enough to serve at a dinner party.

This was sooo good.  I halved the recipe because I only needed enough for 2 adults.  I read some of the reviews and did some differences.  First I bought a rotisserie chicken that I shred and sauted with garlic, onion and olive oil.  Then I added 2 cans condensed soup as was suggested by a reviewer and a can of water.  Then I added the can of tomatoes, beans and chilis, along with 1 tsp cumin, lime juice and a handful of cilantro and seasoned to taste with salt and pepper.  It was delicious.

I haven't had a single person yet tell me anything negative about this soup.  They LOVE it.  I have to quadruple the recipe and cook it in a huge stock pot to make enough for everyone.  The only changes I've made to it is that I omit the green chilies and the green onions - just a taste preference on my part.  I also add a little more beans, hominy, corn and chicken because I like a heartier soup.  Definite winner.

I didn't have hominy, green chillies and only a 14 oz can of crushed tomatoes so I improvised. I used 1 chopped jalepeno pepper as a green chillies substitution and I chopped 2 medium tomatoes and smashed them to make up for the crushed tomatoes. Added cumin and an 8 oz. of sour cream at the end which I think made it. This was a good dish but I've definitely had better. Quick and easy though!

I've made this soup 3 times this past week. The first time I made it exactly as the recipe said but without hominy and with the addition of 1 tsp of cumin.
The next time, (and each time after), I substituted the 4oz can of green chiles with 1 poblano pepper, 2 seranno peppers and 3 jalapenos. I seeded and removed most of the pith and finely diced the peppers.
I also use my own home made chicken stock - about 6 cups - and fire roasted canned tomatoes. 
This is really good and my family loves it!

The BEST chicken tortilla soup recipe out there! This is my favorite soup, and when I told my fiance' that's what we were having for dinner he was less than excited. I made changes others suggested, such as cooking the chicken with the onions and garlic and using ground cumin instead of oregano. In fact, I followed the first review I read completely because it sounded perfect. And it was. I was planning to send some over to his best friend and my fiance' said NO WAY! He said this is one of the best dinners I've ever made. I'm so thankful to the person who submitted this recipe. It is an instant favorite in my home. And really made it a great night for me!

Wow!! This was really, really good!! I added chopped Spanish Chorizo to this...it gave it a smoky kick, I also subbed Cumin for the Oregano....  After putting it in the bowl, I did all the garnishes, but I also squeezed a little fresh lime on top...all I have to say is Wow...

Awesome!  I subbed cumin for the oregano and added 3 tablespoons of lemon juice.  Also used pinto beans instead of the black because that's all I had.  After cooking onions and garlic, dumped the whole thing in a crock pot.  Turned out delicious.  Thanks!

I just made this soup for a cold winter day and it hit the spot!! I used a carton of chicken broth rather than the condensed and frozen cubes of cilantro- always a great thing to have on hand since fresh is highly perishable! Its perfect, wouldnt change a thing. Add some chopped jalapeno if you like it spicy.

OMG, this was DELICIOUS!  Followed the recipe mostly; used 56 oz of homemade chix broth, a 29 oz can of hominy (thats all the supermarket had ... it wasn't overwhelming at all) and a little extra meat.   Cooked everything but the hominy and corn for about an hour, then added the hominy and corn and cooked for about 15 mins more.  Served with the tortilla chips, avocado, shredded Mexican blend cheese, chopped onions (all as in the recipe) and also chopped cilantro and sour cream.  This was absolutely delicious and filling and I will SO make this again!!!

Delicious! I made it 100% organic with the exception of the hominy. I originally was considering doing rice or quinoa instead of hominy, but the woman at Whole Foods insisted that not using hominy would severely alter the consistency! I did use diced tomatoes instead of crushed, and used flax tortilla chips. Yummmm!

Very good.  Personally I would prefer it without the chicken.  I added an extra can of beans instead of the hominy.  Next time I will use medium chilies instead of mild for more of a punch.

This dish was easy, no doubt, but absolutely no flavor! I had to spend time at the end tweaking the spices with a touch of cayenne, sugar, salt, cloves.. and although it's better, still it's disappointing. I stuck very closely to the recipe with the exception of leaving out the black beans and substituting the water for chicken broth. I think the big player is the canned crushed tomatoes. If they aren't from a ripe and flavorful batch they can kill the dish (and I've rarely had a great batch of canned tomatoes). I won't be using this recipe again.

Even the soup hating son went back for seconds!  I pretty much stuck to the recipe, just adding more broth to make it soupier, and it was excellent.  Tip:  I recently found cilantro frozen in tiny teaspoon sized blocks at my grocery store.

Thank you for this recipe.  This soup is delicious.  My husband said this is the best thing he's ever tasted.  I do add cumin and more chili power (I also add a little Ancho chili powder for a little more kick).  I also shred my chicken!

This soup is awesome.  Everyone in this household loves it.  I made it as written except for ditching the cilantro in favor of cumin (personal preference).  Simple to make and extremely tasty!  This will have a solid place in my soup rotation during these coming chilly months!

Very yummy! This makes a thick and wholesome soup. A big bowl of this is definitely enough for a full meal. However I would say this makes more like 4 large servings (not 8), if you plan on only having this for the meal.   I find the easiest way to do the chicken is to just buy a full, fresh cooked chicken at the grocery store that you can quickly break down into shredded chicken. Also, I like adding pepperjack cheese instead to give a little extra kick.

This soup was a hit!  My 12 year old son had two bowls and told me to give it a great rating!  I did omit the hominy (didn't have any) and the cilantro (my family doesn't like it).  I also seasoned the chicken heavily with fajita seasoning and chili powder while I was cooking it. I used all chicken broth and no water to make it a bit richer and it was perfect!  I will make this recipe again and again!  It was super easy and super delicious!

Fantastic!  Changes I made: I had leftover smoked chicken, so I used that. Then to make it easier I used stewed mexican style tomatoes and did not use the green chilies, onion or garlic...turned out great!

Wow - great recipe!  I did spice it up a bit more by adding more chili powder and some cumin. More garlic.  Also topped with diced jalepenos, but we like it hot!  Thanks for a keeper recipe.

The first time I made this, I used all the ingredients minus the hominy, green chiles & black beans & it turned out great, just too much of a tomato base. The second time I made it, I did the same thing as the first time, but used a smaller can of crushed tomatoes, I increased the chicken broth by 3 cups & also added 2 zucchinis & 2 yellow squash.  It was very good & my kids enjoyed it! In place of the tortilla chips, I used Fritos chips (they stay crunchy longer) I tasted very mich like the soup that I order at a local restaurant.  Still very delicious!!

I've made this soup several times and have given out this receipe with a few changes.  I use 32 oz. box of Chicken Broth and 2 cans of Cream of Chicken soup and 2 cans of water. I use a 28 oz jar of salsa instead of the tomatoes and chilis and I have used mild and medium heat depending on how spicey I want the soup.  I don't use the hominy and add 2 cups of frozen corn - much sweeter and I use 2 cans of black beans.  I also add 1 tablespoon of smoked paprika in step 1.  I also have use frozen chicken boneless & skinless in step 1 and it cooks very quickly, I remove it and shred it and put it back.  The rest is the same.  A real crowd pleaser!!

Super yummy! I upped the chicken broth  to 3 cans (instead of the water).  I opted for 1/4 cumin instead of oregano, added a good squeeze of fresh lime juice as well as about a teaspoon of white vinegar to give it more zip.  Oh, and about a cup of good salsa instead of the green chiles and only used 14 oz of crushed tomatoes as a result.  Delicious!

This was delicious!  I took it to a dinner party and got a ton of compliments.  Everyone asked for the recipe.  I made the following changes according to other user suggestions... 4 cloves of minced garlic instead of 3... cumin instead of oregano... 2 cans of chicken broth plus one chicken boullion cube instead of condensed broth & water... a full can of corn and no hominy.  I also added some black pepper, cayenne pepper & a tsp. of brown sugar.  Definitely include all the toppings, they really make it spectacular! (note: tastes better with plain crushed tomatoes than the crushed tomatoes with italian herbs)

This was very good. I served it in a crockpot at a potluck lunch; they every bit and asked for the recipe. As suggested by others I used cumin instead of oregano, added a spoonful of lemon juice (since I was out of lime) and offered sour cream and fresh cilantro along with the other proposed toppings. I think it really helped to make it the day before and warm it for a few hours in the crockpot before serving.

Absolutely delicious! This soup has great flavor and is very filling. I did add about 1/2 tablespoon of cumin. I didn't have any hominy, but I added a can of great northern beans and a can of Mexicorn, in addition to the cup of corn. Served it with shredded cheese, sour cream, and warm flour tortillas. Thanks!

This was good but not spicy enough for us.  I will omit the water next time and if I need more 'juice' I will use more chicken broth.  I did add a can of Rotel tomatoes, didn't have hominy so added a can of Garbanzo beans which worked out really nice.

We love this recipe. We have made it several times and there are a couple of things we do differently. Like many others, we saute the chicken in olive oil and the garlic and onion, but before we add any of the other ingredients we add the oregano and chili pepper to the chicken mixture and let that cook for about a minute. We have found this really awakens the flavors of both spices. But this is such a wonderful and easy recipe that anyone can make it.

This soup was amazing with my modifications:
I cooked the chicken in the soup pot before adding the onions and garlic (adds more flavour).  When I was shopping for this recipe, I found small tins of Mexican sauce in the Mexican section of the grocery store (Herdez brand).  I bought three to use instead of the crushed tomatoes but when I went to add them in the soup pot one small tin was HOT!  I added the one tin, chopped up a fresh tomato, and added a half jar of tomato sauce I had left over.  I also added 2.5 cups of chicken broth, and about 2 cups of veggie broth.  Like others, I used cumin instead of oregano.  I left out the hot peppers, because with this Herdez sauce, it was honestly really spicy.  Limes are essential though, to counteract the heat.  I added three limes and the zest of one lime to the soup when cooking, and chopped up small sections of lime and avocado when serving the soup.  Monterey Jack cheese made this dish!  thanks a lot for the awesome recipe!

This soup is awesome and one of my family's favs!  The only change I make to this is using one cup of rice instead of hominy.  I just use the quick-cooking rice and add it right to the soup to cook.  I make this all the time in the winter.  It is very light and flavorful!

Great recipe.  Made modifications to suit personal tastes and it is DELICIOUS.   Added half teaspoon of cumin, omitted hominy, beans, water, doubled the chicken broth, finished with some lime juice.  Served with a dollop of sour cream, some diced avocado, and crushed chips.

What a keeper! This soup is terrific. The only "changes" I made was to use chicken broth instead of the water, and I doubled the corn as I couldn't find hominy at the market! Regardless, it turned out great - not too spicy, but just right! We will definately be making this one over and over. Thanks!

I believed the hype and was disappointed. I followed some of the reviews - used cumin instead of oregano, i used chicken broth instead of water, and i used 1 cup of corn instead of white hominy. 

This recipe was expensive to make, and the finished product was bland and tasteless. A complete waste of time.

This is good!  Couldn't find hominy up here at my local grocery store in central Maine so I added about 1/4 cup of uncooked quinoa to the broth.  I know it's nothing like hominy, but I wanted to have some small grain in the soup, and quinoa works!  I used homemade chix broth instead of canned and also in place of the water called for in the recipe.

I hated the hominy in this, which is the only reason it wasn't a five star recipe. I'll definately try it again - without hominy!

This was a good soup.  We did not think it was too tomatoey.  However- My husband and I both felt like it was lacking something.  I served it with avacado and shredded cheese.  We both enjoyed the taste and texture of the avacado.  I think next time I'll add more spices and a touch of fresh lime juice at the end.  I will also add the cilantro at the last minute so it isn't so wilted.

This was really flavorful soup!  I used ancho chile powder and the juice of one lime as other reviewers suggested and left out the hominy because I couldn't find it in the store. I also used chicken thighs and was pleased that the end result was really good!  Thank you, it's a keeper!

This was very good, but different then other chicken tortilla soups I've had.  I only changed the recipe by using 3 chicken breast halves, 1 CAN of corn rather than 1 cup, an extra can of broth and I added cumin...it was really good and not too spicy making it good for my 1 and 3 year olds to eat!

I made this for dinner tonight and it was a BIG hit! Very easy to make, but tastes like something you would get in a restaurant! Like other reviewers, I omitted the water opting for 2 cans of low sodium chicken broth. I also used 1 tsp. cumin instead of the oregano and added a few squeezes of fresh lime juice which is a great combination with the cilantro. Served with warm cornbread, this is a very filling dinner for cold winter nights! A definite new favorite!

Everyone really enjoyed this soup. My husband had second helpings and demanded that I send it with him to work for lunch. I used canned vegetables and rinsed them really well since my husband has to watch his sodium intake, and even though I normally like frozen vegies better it still worked. The flavor was great. I didnt have any cilantro around the house so didnt use any but still it was great... I substituted fresh chopped jalapenos for the chiles for a more spicy soup. Very tasty and I will make it again definately since most of the ingredients are already handy...

Amazing! The changes I made were: 1 can of crushed tomatoes and 1 can of diced tomatoes instead of the larger can of crushed, and 2 cans of low sodium chicken broth instead of the concentrated chicken broth and water, I also left out the hominy. We also ate the tortilla chips with the soup instead of in it. I will definately be making this again, my new favorite dinner!

Super recipe!  My kids and husband don't like beans so much, so I left it out. I used 1 can of Rotel for the stewed tomatoes. I didn't realize until it was too late that I needed another can.  I used 2-1/2 cups of chicken broth in exchange for the broth and water.  I also used 1 tsp cumin instead of oregano.  Delish!

Excellent recipe! 

we're all sick this weekend so to simplify, i used Tyson canned chicken and it was still good....

i gave it 5 stars based on the hearty flavor, how easy it was to make and the fact that most of the family enjoyed it...

I read several reviews and used the cumin instead of the oregano....and also, i used all chicken broth and no water....i like my soups thick and hearty so i did not use additional liquids....

i still thought it needed more flavor so i also used 1 tsp each pepper and salt...in addition i juiced two limes into the soup as it was simmering....

i think the lime added just the touch it needed.....

the soup is incomplete without the cheese and tortilla chips...i also added 1 tsp sour cream....the addition of these brings it all together...

Thanks! will definitely be making this on a regular basis....

We absolutely loved this recipe. I was feeling lazy, so I made it without the chicken, and it was still amazing. It had a great flavor and was really hearty. I couldn't find the condensed chicken broth, so we just used 20.5 ounces of regular chicken broth. I also added an extra cup of corn because we like our soup chunky. And added cheddar cheese on top in addition to the Monterey Jack. Loved it and will definitely make it again. Hominy is available in the canned veggie aisle. If you can't find it where you shop, I'd just use extra corn - it's very similar. This recipe is hard to mess up!

This soup was wonderful! It was so easy to make. It had great texture and flavor. I added an extra can of chicken broth because my family likes more broth. I also added 1 teaspoon of sugar,1/2 teaspoon of dried powdered cumin and some salt and peper.
I will make this again and again. It will be better the next day when all the flavors blend

Another good soup recipe! I used a whole can of hominy (left out corn) just because I LOVE hominy!!! I had small red beans on hand, so used them instead of black. And 2 cans of regular chicken broth instead of the condensed plus water. A quick soup to throw together!

I made a few changes to this- just the ommision of the chili powder and avocado, out of preference.  It was absolutely amazing. the flavors are perfect together.  i'd never had hominy, and i think by itself i wouldn't like it, but it complimented this dish well.  i sauteed the onion and garlic in the same pan i had cooked my chicken in, and  added some diced carrots as well.

Have made many tortilla soups, this one is super tasty.  Boiled my chicken and used the water along with chicken broth.  Added cumin and extra garlic.  topped with no-fat sourcream and black bean tortilla chips and fresh avocado slices for a little healthier alternative.  This is a keeper!

The absolute best tortilla soup I've ever made, and it only gets better over night!  It even rivals those from my favorite Mexican restaurants.  Instead of using tortilla chips though, we usually cut tortillas into thin strips and deep fry them.  It gives the soup a little something extra, plus it's a great way to get rid of extra or stale tortillas! :)  It's probably worth noting that this is a thicker version of soup, so if you really like your tortilla soup runny, you might want to make some adjustments accordingly.

Wonderful!!!  Full of flavor and easy to make.  I used two cans of broth and one can cream of chicken and didn't add any water, substituted cumin for oregano, substituted diced tomatoes for crushed tomatoes and omitted the hominy.  Half can of chili peppers is plenty...I used almost a whole can and it was a little too spicy for me (but my husband thought it was perfect).

FABULOUS. My family is Texan hispanic and my husband begs me to make more of this. It's better or equal to most resturants version of this soup. A little advice: Go easy on the green peppers, they can easily overpower other ingredients, I didn't use any. I also cut out the hominy since that seems a little too pozole for me. One thing you can add more of is the cilantro, THIS is the essence of the soup! Thanks, to who posted this my family loves you!

the fresh ingredients filled my kitchen with yummy aromas!  i, too, used cumin instead of oregano and added fresh lime juice.  a beautiful, simple dinner when served with a plate of do-it-yourself toppings (avocado, cheese, cilantro sprigs, chopped green onions, and lime wedges).  i served it with corn bread muffins and  watermelon margaritas.

I made this recipe while working at home today and having a craving for a local restaurant's chicken tortilla soup.  This was absolutely excellent.  I did make a couple of changes.  I used two cans of chicken broth and one can of Enchilada sauce in lieu of the water.  I used lots of chili power and cumin while cooking the chicken as I like it spicy. That and the enchilada sauce really kicked it up a notch.  This will be one of my favorites that I make again and again.  Thanks.

I loved this soup because it is quick to make and so delicious. (I made mine without hominy or oregano.)It's a good recipe for when you can't get to the grocery store, since most of the ingredients can be kept on hand for a quick meal.

Everyone wants this recipe after they try aste the soup. It's easy and, even with all the canned vegetables, quite tasty. I use 2 cans of regular broth instead of the condensed, and use whole cans of corn and hominy. I also add a heaping tsp. of ground cumin and lime juice. As with many soups, even better the next day.

Great soup. It wasn't one of my family's favorites, hence the for stars, but I loved it. We had this soup and Mexican Cornbread (also from this site.) If you're not a fan of garbonzo beans I recomend using white corn. I also recommend canned corn if fresh corn isn't in season.

Pretty darn good soup. I used 3 C. homemade chicken stock rather than the canned broth, as I had this on hand, and the leftovers of a roast chicken. I omited the hominy(do not like it) and substituted cumin for oregano as suggested by many reviewers.I also did not have crushed tomatoes, so used diced tomatoes that I pulsed in the food processor. The soup was a bit thick, this was probably why. I just thinned it with a bit of water and upped the spices a bit. Turned out great! Garnished with shredded cheese, sour cream and tortilla chips. Yummy! Will make again.**Tip** I have garnished this soup with both purchased tortilla chips and homemade. Go with the homemade. It takes just a few minutes to fry up some corn tortilla srips, but makes all the difference in the world!

This was very tasty.  I didn't have leftover chicken so I sauteed the chicken w/onions; cut back on the liquid and cooked it on low heat for a few hours.  I'll definitely make this again.  Very easy and makes good leftovers!  Even my picky husband enjoyed it.

We love this recipe.  It makes the house smell GREAT!  I omitted the hominy, beans, and green onion.  Instead I added zucchini and chayote.  I don't know what condensed chicken broth is, so I used cream of chicken (YUMM YUMM!)  My husband brings the leftovers for lunch and his co-workers have been asking for the recipe just from the aroma!

This soup is absolutely wonderful!!!  I made mine with Tyson flash frozen chicken tenderloins, a whole serrano pepper minus the seeds, a can of green giant shoepeg corn, a can of black beans with the juice, I omitted the hominey (my husband thinks it's too dry).  I used gebhart chili powder, a couple of dashes of tabasco, plus I added some comino (mexican sesoning).  I used onion powder instead of real onions (my husband hates those too).  Talk about deeeelicious.  Add some regular corn Doritos and some shredded monterrey jack cheese!  It's great!!!  Hope this helps!

Delicioso!  So easy to make and tasted so good!  It's beautiful to look at too; I garnished with a rolled hot tortilla, avacado, sour cream, and crushed blue tortilla chips.  It looked like a piece of art, and tasted like one too. Freezes well and almost tastes better the next day. Thank you so much!

An excellent soup!  I made chicken stock from leftovers yesterday so I used fresh chicken stock and the meat that fell off the bones.  No Hominy but everything else!  I saved the tortilla chips to top the soup with rather than putting them in at the beginning because I really think I would not like the texture!  This was wonderful for a great Oregon Day!  Thank you so much Star!

I’ve made this soup once a month for the past 2 years and it never disappoints. Over the course of time I’ve made changes based on my family’s likes, usually adding extra chicken bouillon for more depth of flavor. We love adding any of the following just before eating: cheese, sour cream, crushed corn chips or chunks of fresh avocado. Bone ap the teeth!

Enjoyed this very much!! Mostly stayed true to the recipe except as follows; Was pretty generous with the ingredient measurements, used a whole rotisserie chicken, added about 2 tsp cumin, used no water only chicken stock, and added extra stock at the end to thin the soup to my preferred consistency. I don't feel that the flavors were diluted especially with a little heavy handed spice measuring and some extra simmering time. Will add this to the rotation!

so easy and so good!  I added 1 tsp cumin, omitted hominy because I didn't have it, subbed white northern beans for black beans and added sour cream to the garnishes.  I thought it came out perfect.  I threw the two chicken breasts into the soup still frozen and let them cook in the soup and then shredded the chicken before serving. ready in less than an hour, so so good.

This is my first time doing a review. My husband told me he wanted soup for dinner and I felt like buying him a can and telling him to have at it. I like soup ok but as a meal? I really thought well I guess I'm not going to eat dinner. So I found this recipe and the reviewer below me who read all 114 reviews ( Thank you so much!) saved me tons of time. I did have two unique tasks in order to keep my hubby and a picky eater happy. #1 no hominy or corn. #2 what was I going to put in its place?   I chose okra to replace both of the veggies omitted. This viewer also added lime juice and I didn't see an amount so I went back and referred to another tortilla soup recipe and based on servings I added 3 tablespoons. I used 3 garlic cloves on accident so I left out the garlic powder. I used a whole onion. Everything else I followed step for step by the reviewer. When to put in the spices, which ones she substituted. Like I said she saved me a lot it time. The soup was incredible. I did use the sour cream on top with the cheese and tortilla strips. The avocados got left in the fridge. I guess soup can be a great meal!

Wow, this was so easy and tasted delicious! I just tweaked a couple of things: I squeezed half a lime while simmering, I used a rotisserie chicken and used pepper jack cheese ( my husband loves it spicy). This is a definite repeat meal!

Great base recipe, I'd give it 5 stars but I had to make some adjustments to make it amazing.  I made it as shown but with these changes: 
I used 5 cloves of garlic instead of 3.
I cut the chili powder to 1 tsp.
I used 1.5 tsp of cumin instead of the 1 tsp of oregano. 
I added 1 tsp of garlic powder.
I added the juice from 1/2 of a fresh lime.
I added extra hominy (drained very well.)
Instead of chicken breasts I used the breast and wing meat from a garlic pepper rotisserie chicken, diced. 
I let it simmer on low for an hour and topped it with sour cream, jack, green onions, and avocado and served tortilla chips on the side.  It was even better the second and third day. 



I used twice as much broth, then added even more at the end to thin it.

This is my favorite tortilla soup recipe. As other reviewers suggested, I substituted cumin for the oregano and I always keep extra chicken stock on hand to get the consistency that I want. A lot of people leave out the hominy (not a huge fan, either) but in this soup, it works. I think it gives it the tortilla flavor. I'm actually getting ready to double this batch and pressure can it for the winter.

Made this last night for my family and we all loved it! I boiled a whole fryer instead and used the broth from that. This is definitely a favorite now.

The first time i made this soup i accidentally added jalapenos instead of green chili. Now the only way i make this is with jalapeno because it tastes amazing. I omit the water and just stick with using chicken broth and I tend not to measure, but just poor until i get the consistency i like which is a little on the thicker side. I usually double the crushed tomatoes, corn, hominy and beans  to make plenty for everyone. The soup is even better the next day. Love love love this soup!

I can't believe that I haven't rated this recipe yet.  I found it last winter and this year, my kids couldn't wait until it got cold enough for me to start making soup again.  This is their favorite by far!  I follow the recipe except that I use Knorr chicken bouillon and water instead of stock.    This soup tastes amazing but it's also easy and inexpensive to make.   Top with strips of lightly fried flour tortillas, shredded sharp cheddar, and a dollop of sour cream and you have an awesome meal.

My family liked it. I looked at a ton of recipes and chose this one. glad I did.  I made some substitutions due to necessity of what was in my closet:  I didn't have hominy, so I substituted creamed corn instead of the regular corn and hominy together.  I used jalepenos since I didn't have green chiles.  And I didn't use the water.  It was thicker and my family liked it this way.  Also added a dollop of sour cream to the top. (and no green onions since my family doesn't like those)

I've made this recipe several times and my husband and I both love it.  It can be made mild or spicy, and with or without the hominy.  I'm not a big fan of hominy with the corn already in the soup.  I always make it as is, but a full carton of chicken broth (uncondensed) can be used with the same result.

Added 1/2 teaspoon of Cumin, and substituted chicken leg quarters for the breast meat. Excellent flavor and consistency. Will definitely make this recipe again!

This was the absolute BEST Tortilla soup PERIOD! Yes I changed it too, but not by much.I prepared dry black beans instead of using canned. I used three large Beef Steak tomatoes and cooked them down while the chicken was baking.  I used a 10 oz. bag of frozen corn. I omitted the oregano as others suggested but did add fresh cilantro with about 2 Tbs. of cumin.  All my ingredients were Organic as well as the chips. DELICIOUS!!!!!!

This recipe is a keeper. I did follow most of the instructions and ingredients except that I usually add dry oregano to soups at the end when I am about 5 minutes away or so to turn off the heat. The reason being that oregano gets a bit bitter if over cooked. As for everything else, I did everything the same however I had some pre-cooked chicken for Lime chicken Soft tacos found in this website. Needless to say the chicken tasted very, very good already. I encourage you to try the recipe of the Soft tacos and if you have left overs use them to make this recipe and if you like the flavor of limes add a few drops you will see how this recipe gets even better!

I used cooked rotisserie chicken pieces (Costco) and it made this recipe SUPER fast and easy. Threw it all in the crockpot on low for 6-7 hours. Delicious!

This recipe is very forgiving but only one warning: it's spicy! I did not use chili peppers, just chili powder.  Two teaspoons was too much! We are used to spicy Indian and Thai food, (we are a Mixed Race family) but this was too hot.  Maybe cut down to 1 tsp. I used diced tomatoes and no hominy. I doubled the beans and added the tortilla chips right before serving. It was yummy but cleared our sinuses.

Deliciouso!!!  Very good, I underestimated this recipe but let me tell you you won't be disappointed! I did use the cumin instead of the othe no like suggested and I let it simmer for about 30 to 45 mins to let the flavors developed . I makes plenty for a fulfilling meal and enough for a quick lunch the next day!

Hearty soup, almost tastes like a quesadilla. Next time I will probably make a side of fried plantains to dip in the soup. Also I added a pinch of salt and pepper for taste.

We love this soup. I add a can of chick peas instead of hominy, because hominy is hard to find.  I also add fresh cilantro to the soup (1/5 cup chopped) and a cup of chopped orka for color.

I made this for my family (7 of us) the other night. I used a can of whole kernel corn (drained), added 1 tsp cumin, and also served it with sour cream to make it a tad creamy. This recipe does make a thick chili-like recipe

Not many recipes get 5 stars as-is, but this one nailed it.  My changes were really just not measuring most of my things; I used a full can of hominy, a leftover bowl of corn that was probably a can's worth, and Better than Boullion with the tomato can full of water (which was roughly 3.5 cups).  Oh, and I didn't have chile peppers, but didn't miss them.  As it was simmering, I kept tasting it, expecting it to need a little something, but it never did.

The only thing I noticed is that it does come out pretty thick as is.  It doesn't look all that thick in the pot, but if you don't thin it out a little, and then add tortilla strips and a little shredded cheese, it thickens up to a stew consistency immediately.  So I added another couple cups of water until it felt right.  And the family is even eating the leftovers!

I LOVE this soup.  Yes, it's thick, but that's the way I like it.  I made it just as written many times.  To make it faster I cut up the chicken add 2 Tbs of olive oil and brown it in a stock pot.  Then I add the onion.  Once everything is in the pot, I simmer it for an hour.  If you want to spice it up replace the tomatoes with a can of tomatoes and chiles and a can of fire roasted tomatoes.  It's the best thing for a cold, it beats the heck out of regular chicken soup.

LOVE,love,love this tortilla soup receipe! I originally found it years ago and unfortunately lost it but then found it again on the spinner app. Everyone in my family loves it, even the kids. This is the best receipe I've tried. You can't go wrong with this soup!

This was too "tomato-y" and not at all spicy so I added another cup of chicken broth, another teaspoon of chili powder, a teaspoon of cayenne pepper and a good sprinkle of creole seasoning, southwest seasoning, salt & pepper. I added shredded cheese, green onions, sour cream & crushed tortilla chips on top. It was divine!

I'm not much of a cook but we gotta eat. This is my favorite soup and maybe the best recipe I have found on here. I tend to customize for what I have rather than buying unusual items. I leave out hominy since I'm not a fan and I use canned corn because I'm lazy. If you like spicy I've found that subbing a couple cans of Ro-Tel for the crushed tomatoes and the dice green peppers works to give it a tiny bit more kick. I've made it both ways and we prefer spicier.

I tried this tonight and wow, we loved it! I had leftover pork roast and some turkey broth that I needed to use, added the rest of the ingredients and it was so scrumptious! I will make it again because it is healthy, easy and fast to make. I added some cumin and coriander simply because I love them. Appreciate your website.

excellent and easy to prepare. My soup was a little thin so I added a little cornstarch to thicken it up. Otherwise, perfect as is.

I think  2 teaspoons of chili powder is WAY too much!  Both my husband and son prefer spicy hot, but 2 teaspoons rendered the soup inedible even to them. The inclusion of the corn, hominy, black beans, and green chills made the soup heavy, and unbalanced. 

I remade the recipe a second time with delicious success with the following changes:  I used only 3/4 teaspoon of chile powder, and 3/4 cup of corn.  I completely omitted the hominy, black beans, green chiles.  The result was a delightful, well balanced soup, that was happily devoured by my family.

This was great.  Tasty, just enough spice, thick consistency.  I did not add black beans and added a little bit of lime juice for personal preference.  Definitely a keep for me.  Thanks!

I made this and edited it according to most of the reviews. I used cumin instead of oregano, I used two cans of chicken broth instead of the condensed chicken broth and water. I did not use hominy. I added a can of corn. The one thing I did that I did not see in reviews which I do to store bought tortilla soup is I added a chopped chipotle pepper, it adds the smoky flavor and kick I love. I will make this again for sure.

Loved it ! and so has everyone whom I've shared this soup with. I do take a short cut by using a whole roasted chicken from the grocery store (shred it and discard the skin and bones) I also add chipotle peppers in adobo instead of the green chilies , 1 tsp of ground cumin and 1-14oz can of diced tomatoes. Very yummy.

This recipe serves as a great guide but required some changes. Based on others reviews and my personal taste, this is what I used: 

½ onion, finely diced
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 Tbsp olive oil
½ tsp chili powder
1 tsp ground cumin
4 cups water
2 Knorr chicken bouillon cubes
1 can (28 oz) crushed tomatoes
1 can whole kernel corn, drained
1 can white hominy, drained
1 can black beans, drained and rinsed
¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro
1/2 jalapeño, seeds removed 
6 chicken tenderloins
salt to taste

1. In a frying pan, saute chicken tenderloins in a little olive oil (lightly seasoned with salt and pepper) just until cooked through. Shred and set aside.
2. In a medium stock pot, heat oil over medium heat. Saute onion and garlic in oil until soft. Add all ingredients, cover and simmer on medium-low heat for at least 30 minutes. 
3. Serve topped with crushed tortilla chips, avocado and lime. 

The first night I made this soup, we topped with cheese, avocado, tortilla chips and sour cream. It was good but not great. The second day when I ate the leftovers, I didn't use cheese or sour cream but topped with tortilla chips, avocado and lime and its the lime that put it over the top. This is my new favorite recipe!!

This soup is my favorite Chicken Tortilla ever. One way to make it much easier is to first make the Slow Cooker Cilantro Lime Chicken, then use the leftovers for this soup! The chicken is already shredded and seasoned for you, and tastes excellent in this soup. The hominy really adds texture and taste. I wasn't familiar with it before this, and now I'm a fan.

This is an awesome soup. I did make a few slight modifications. I double this recipe so I can freeze 1/2. Add extra 1/2 tsp chili powder. Add cayenne pepper to taste. 2 full cans of corn 3 full cans of black beans. 1 large can hominy  and I usually use a roasted chicken from Costco   Tastes great freezes well. Crowd pleaser.

Very Good flavor. I cooked my cubed chicken breast, garlic & onion in the olive oil until chicken was no longer pink & onion was cooked. Then added the chicken broth & spices & cooked for 10 min. I didn't have cilantrol so I added 1/2t cumin. I used all chicken broth (no water). After cooking for 10 min.I added the chilies, 15 oz Hominy, 15 oz canned corn, black beans. I served with Monterey Cheddar cheese, tostitos & sour cream. I also baked corn bread as a side.

My family of husband and young men raved about this soup! I did make changes only due to what I had on hand. I followed the recipe exactly until it came to the black beans. I thought I had some but the cupboard was bare. I had some leftover Texas beans from this site, so I tossed them in, also some leftover refried beans!  I didn't have cilantro or avocados. It was very easy and delicious! Thank you.

Great soup! DH and I ate it quickly ate it all up! I substituted cumin for the oregano. I also added a little more chicken broth so it wasn't so thick. DH wanted it a little spicier so we added cayenne pepper to taste. This one is definitely going in the recipe book! :) Thank you for sharing.

This is the best chicken tortilla soup I have ever made.  I use shredded chicken and dried beans with reduced sodium fat free chicken broth.  I love the inclusion of the hominy, which I would never have thought of! Thanks!

Yikes!  I added about 1.5 tsps of chilli powder instead of the 2 tsps the recipe called for and oh my good heavens, the soup cleared out my sinuses and sent a fire down my throat and burned me inside out!!! And this is from someone who likes to eat whole jalapeno peppers and LOVES spicy Mexican food! But not this!  All you could taste was chicken broth at first and then fire. My husband who likes things spicier than me even said the chilli pepper was way too strong and the flavor over-powered the soup.

In the future, I will make this again but with some major changes.  I added two Tbs of heavy cream because I like my soup a little creamy.  More tomatoes.  Cumin instead of oregano.  I think I will omit the chilli powder all together and then play with adding a little... maybe 1/4 tsp to start.  1/4 tsp of salt would  help.  The Monterrey Jack cheese is a must!  Sour cream is good, too and chips - we love the blue corn tortilla chips from Target.  Avacado was an excellent addition, as well.

This was good and we'll make it again, but with modifications for personal preference.  In our opinion, this was way too tomato-ey.  I plan to used canned diced tomatoes next time.  Enjoyed it otherwise.

I only gave this 4 stars because I followed JENNANTHONY99's suggestions so I don't totally know what the original recipe comes out like.

I didn't have crushed tomatoes so I used 2 cans of petite diced tomatoes (drained) and threw them in the food processor since I don't like chunks of tomatoes.

We put some shredded lettuce and shredded cheese with some home fried tortilla chips on top and it was SO good! A couple of us also added a big dollop of sour cream.

Good stuff!

Great easy recipe!  I always boil the chicken breasts, then shred them once cooked through.  Like that better than chunks.

Fabulous!  I too changed from oregano to cumin, left out chili powder for 1 pkg. taco seasoning. I dissolved chicken bouillon cubes instead of water also. I used chicken thigh meat also, (breast meat tends to dry out ).  I only wished I had doubled the recipe.  I made a pot of white rice in case some guests wanted to pour the soup over the rice. Please don't worry that it will be too spicy for children, my grandkids loved it.  Which means the next batch I make I can throw in a can of HOT green chili's instead of mild, and the taco seasoning hot as well.  Needless to say there was not a drop of this rich and hearty soup left,  But my soup and I were the talk of the evening. Everyone thought it was an old family recipe, not my first try out!

It was phenomenal. We didn't even have some of the ingredients on hand (don't like garlic, didn't have hominy and cilantro) and it was still excellent.

Awesome recipe!  Delicious and healthy too. I'm watching my weight so I poached the chicken. Before poaching, I seasoned the chicken with a packet of Sazon Cilantro and Tomato seasoning.  I added one chopped chipotle pepper and 2 tbsp of chipotle liquid to the poaching liquid.  Omitted the oregano and used 1 heaping tsp of chili powder mixed with another packet of Sazon Cilantro and Tomato seasoning. Followed the remainder of the recipe as written, but used Kraft's 2% shredded Mexican cheese blend.  Yummo!!

I've been looking for a great tortilla soup and this is a fantastic recipe. So easy and tasty. I did not add chicken, but used homemade chicken stock instead of the condensed soup & water the recipe called for. This is a keeper!

I have always loved tortilla soup, but never actually tried making it myself! I am so happy that I found this recipe! I didn't add as much oregano though, and I used 1/2 cup of masa flour. A wonderful soup to eat!

I've made this recipe so many times and everyone has LOVED it. I even won my boyfriends work cooking competition with it! I like to subtract the hominy and add bell peppers as well as double the garlic. Also make your own tortilla strips and top with a dollop of sour cream and cheese and it will be a hit!

Tried this tonight and thought it was really good. I upped the spice, didn't know what Hominy was, so left it out and used kidney beans instead of black beans, because that was what I had. Used loads of cilantro and a good squeeze of lime, oh and cumin instead of oregano. I would definitely make this again. I think it would be hard to mess this recipe up, it's very forgiving.

Nothing fancy - just a great (and EASY) soup to make. I used canned chicken because of time constraints. It freezes well so I plan on making a double batch soon.

Good recipe Star.  I changed a few things as well.  I was hoping for a more southwestern taste.  I added a packet of chipotle taco seasoning mix and a little black pepper. I omitted the hominy and added a can of cream of mushroom soup. Thanks for the recipe. Keep posting!!!!!

My 13 yr. old son asked me to make it again...

No kidding about being quick to prepare! Even though there are a lot of ingredients, they are all very cheap and I had most of these things on hands.  Such a colorful, tasty, healthy meal! I am saving this one to bring to friends who are at home sick. It makes me look like a master chef. SO tasty!!!

Another winner at my house. I followed one reviewer's advice and swapped out the hominy for frozen white corn. I do recommend adding the avocado though, it really adds something to the soup.

I love this recipe but made some changes.  First I cut up the raw chicken and cooked it with the garlic in the oil.  I can't eat onions so I left them out.  I didn't use oregano but did put in 1/2 tsp. cumin. I used 4 cups of chicken broth and forget the water. I also simmer it for about an hour just to blend the flavors.  Very good topped with cheese, avocado, tortilla strips and sour cream.  Requested by my family all the time.

Great recipe! I simmered the tomato/broth mixture for about 45 mins then simmered the whole thing for about 2 hours. Added a jalapeno and cumin as others have suggested. Stick with the hominy if you can find it. It adds a nice texture.

I followed the recipe exactly, only leaving out the hominy, and my family loved this soup! My favorite part is its simplicity, and the fact that the ingredients were already in my pantry, fridge,and garden (minus that hominy).

Love this soup!!  I have been making it for years...Have yet to find anyone that doesn't love it.  Everyone who tries it always wants the recipe...Also very healthy..I usually omit the water and use more chicken broth, use lots of cilantro and leave out corn/hominy (add xtra black beans)...YUM!

Absolutely delicious!  I didn't have hominy on hand, so omitted that.  Also omitted the can of green chilies that I also didn't have, but finely chopped a frozen serrano pepper.  Best soup I've ever made!

Perfect!!
I grilled a couple of large boneless skinless chicken breast while sautéing and mixing the rest of the ingredients then chopped and added the chicken.  Sliced a couple of flour tortillas with a pizza cutter into narrow strips, sprayed them with cooking spray and baked at 400 for a few minutes until crisp.  Can't say enough how good this was...

this soup is DELICIOUS!  I make this at least 2x a month.  The whole family loves it, which is a huge bonus.  My only change is I add more black beans, 2 cups of corn instead of one (in place of the hominy), and I use homemade chicken stock instead of canned broth (which means an adjustment with the water, I usually skip it all together).  It is sooooo good!

So easy & so delicious! I couldn't find hominy & didn't have cilantro on hand so I just omitted them. We topped ours with shredded mozza (it was in the fridge) green onion & avocado. Great for left-overs, too!

Really good. I WILL make this again.  I really would give it 5 stars, but because of the few changes I made didn't think I could give it a 5.  I didn't mention to my 15 year old son, that wont eat beans, about the beans in this soup.  He gave it a thumbs up.  (I still haven't told him about the beans, not sure if I ever will.)  That alone made it a keeper.  I did follow a few reviews and added a little lime juice, only used chicken broth, and served it with sour cream.

I've been making this soup for years and it's a staple in my family! I too add more chicken broth(the box container or more) and omit the water, add cumin and itailian seasoning and as much cilantro as you like, we like 1/2 c. minimum, always fresh though, dried doesn't compare. I also use 3 chicken breast, meatier makes the men happy. Everyone will want the recipe, Seriously!

Absolutely loved this recipe! We didn't have chili powder so used a package of fajita seasoning instead. Also used a full carton of chicken stock. Delicious and so easy. Hits the spot on a cold winter night.

My family and I loved this soup. Really the only change I made is that I sauteed the chicken in the olive oil with the onions and garlic. I added the other ingredients and let it simmer for about 40 minutes. At the table, we just crunched up some corn tortilla chips on top of our bowls, which was delicious. I will definitely make this again.

This is sooo good.  I double it, and I add a little extra broth. I follow jennanthony's version, but I use more chili powder than she does, and I do put a bit of oregano, and two cans of beans - one black and one kidney, and I don't drain.

Very good! I omitted the hominy and added an extra can of corn and used the fresh broth from the chicken I boiled. I used more broth than what was called for since I prefer soupier soup! Overall very good recipe!

Delicious! I wouldn't change one thing about the recipe. It's perfect the way it is. Better than tortilla soups at restaurants. This is a GREAT recipe.

We loved it. I made a small amount of changes to the recipe. I did not have oregano so I used Parsley flakes instead. I also fried the chicken in butter, garlic, and a splash of white wine vinegar, as well as sprinkled pepper and crushed red pepper.  Before serving I added sour cream.  I loved the taste of the hominy.  That was the first time I have ever had that.  It was definitely a favorite.  Totally filling we did not need a side dish.

I am a gluten free chef, and my husband is lactose intolerant, so finding a recipe that accomodates us both is a miracle.  This recipe was wonderful.  I replaced the oregano with cumin, as I love cumin.  Otherwise I did this pretty much as the recipe states.  It was super flavorful and easy to make.  A plus is that both my kids ate it.  I have been craving it since I made it last.  If you are skeptical....just try it.  AMAZING!

This was so good!  I didn't add the hominy and used all chicken broth instead of adding water.  It rich, but so good!!  I served it with sour cream and fresh cilantro for more tang.  Cooking it with cilantro is key!  Loved it!

I too read others reviews prior to making this, used some other adjustments and made a few adjustments of my own. I used 1/2 c. of onions, 1/2 c. bell peppers (both very finely diced, almost minced being my family doesnt like either so I have to hide in foods for the flavor). I did use 2 t. chili powder, and as others suggested I omitted the oregano and used 2 t. cumin. 1 (14.5 oz) diced tomatoes (mexican style), 1 (8 oz) can tomatoe sauce, 2 (14oz cans) chicken broth (filled one of them with water three times), 1 can whole kernel corn drained (omitted hominy husband won't eat), green chilies, 1/2 can of black beans well rinsed, 1/4 c. cilantro and italian parsley mixed, I used a honey jalapeno roasted chicken (breast only diced), I also added 1 boil n bag rice(cooked). I cooked as directions stated, but simmered for an hour, then topped each bowl with shredded habbanero cheese(local store carries), and hint of jalapeno tortilla chips, and fresh squeezed lime juice, added avocado, and black olives to those who wanted it. At first my husband said I am not eating that being he doesn't eat soup, once it was finished he not only ate it but came home to eat it for lunch the next day. I will make this again on another cold rainy day, it was the perfect warm you up from the inside food.

This soup was very good.  I made a few changes though.  When I make this soup I roast a whole chicken the night before and use the leftovers in this soup.  I just add the chicken the last 10 minutes of cooking.  I also add:  1 tsp of cumin  2 Tbl of chili powder instead of 2 tsp 2 14.5 oz cans of fire roasted diced tomatoes 1 14.5 oz can of spicy re-fried beans 3.5 cups of chicken broth/stock (I don't add the water)

I've made this soup countless times and it turns out amazing each and every time!    I made just a few modifications.    1) I cooked the chicken separately (with crushed garlic in the water), shredded then added it to the soup in step 2.   2) I replaced oregano with cumin.   3) I love spice so I added a 1/4 tbs of a habanero; seeds removed and finely cut.  If you choose to do this please wash your hands thoroughly after handling.  Enjoy!

THis was great. I used it as a last minute way to use some pulled pork, so I didn't make it traditional with chicken.  I was also out of a few things (Hominy, chile peppers). It still turned out fantastic! I omitted the oregano and used fire roasted crushed tomatoes. The flavor was unbelievable! Loved this for a basic soup recipe that I can throw any left-over meat into!

My second favorite chicken soup and my husbands first. He called from a trip and described a chicken tortilla soup he had just eaten. I entered the ingredients and this popped up.  This soup is awesome just as it is.  Don't miss this one.

We liked this soup.  You really can play around with the ingredients and flavors.  I added more broth (a box plus a can) and no water.  Then more chilis (7 oz. can I think).  No hominy.  Sub. cumin for oregano.  And added sliced corn tortillas.  Great recipe for leftover chicken, and I'm glad it freezes well because that's what I intend to do!

With a quick addition of a corn tortilla slurry..(flash fry tortillas in sautee pan, coating both sides in oil til soft, not crisp)cut small sections and place in food processor or blender, add chicken stock or base from soup and blend til consistency of a daquiri or slurpee. Pour back slurry into soup and let it simmer to finish. Just a great background flavor enhancer. Try it!

I really don't care for soup and especially my younger sister doesn't either. She is always hating on soup and after she saw her picky boyfriend eat and rave about it she gave it a try. I'm soo glad I finally gave this recipe a try because I'll continue to make this soup! I didn't use this exactly. I started off with whole chicken thighs in the pot and seared them for a few minutes on both sides while sauteing onions & garlic with the chicken. Then added the liquids. I decided not to use hominy since I was trying to cut back on carbs. I cut corn off fresh corn on the cob. Used one can of fat free clear broth, 1 chicken bullion cube & 1 tomato bullion cube. I used 1 jalapeno chopped and a can of whole stewed tomatoes. I didn't have any black beans, but I used a can of red beans and it's just as good.  Topped with cheddar cheese, chopped white onion, cilantro, chopped corn chips, sour cream and guacamole.  FANTASTIC!

Excellent recipe!  The whole family said it was the best soup they had ever had!  I wish I wouldn't have added the oregano, because I spent some time trying to get rid of that flavor.  Last time I didn't use any.  I ended up adding 3 cans chicken broth, 2 cans hominy 1 can mild rotel and one can hot with green chiles.  I also love black beans so I used 3 cans of those.  Added quite a bit of chipotle spice along with chile powder and cumin.  I used my own made up mexican spice and grilled the chicken before putting it in the soup.  Great recipe all around!

I did not care for this recipe.  I've had Chicken Tortilla soup from many different restaurants, but I've never had any that tasted like this.  I even simmered it for awhile hoping it would get better...and then just ended up ordering a pizza!!

This is tasty, but a little tomato-y for my taste. Next Time I'd use Rotel, like the review by 1970sall says.   But I like the beans + hominy. Yum!  Anything is good with crushed tortilla chips and all the other delicious toppings. Great with cornbread.

Yum! We love soup at our house and we love "mexican-y" type foods too, so this was a hit, even with the kids (age 4 and 17 months). I added a heaping tsp. of cumin (because we love it so much). I didn't have a can of green chiles, but I did have a can of rotel diced tomatoes and green chiles, which I drained and added instead. I doubled the black beans because we love them and all I had was a big can anyways. Yummy!

This is wonderful! I made it without the black beans (my bf is not a fan) but I believe would have been even better with them.  I let it simmer for over an hr and used cumin instead of oregano. Definite keeper.

Very good recipe.  I was trying to make something like the Aztec soup from the Mexican restaurant that my boyfriend LOVES for Valentines.  He said he liked this one better because I didn't cheap out on the good stuff!  The only real change I made was that I used a can of drained diced tomatoes instead of crushed and extra broth because I wanted it more like chicken broth rather than a tomato-based soup

This soup is absolutely awesome! My husband said "honey, another home run!".  I followed the recipe as written to a "T".  I wouldn't change a thing and don't think it's necessary.  I read many of the reviews and some added extra liquid to make it more "soupy".  IMO it's plenty soupy, adding additional liquid would make it way too thin as it wasn't really that thick to begin with.  Just be sure to use the exact measurements etc.  My friend recommended this to me and says she never changes a thing.  I can't wait to have this again tonight for dinner!!!

I made my own stock and used the chicken in the soup.  It was really good.  It is a keeper.  Also I crushed a 1/2 of a cup of tortillas up in the soup for the last 10 minutes.

I loved this soup!  I made my own stock with a leftover chicken carcass.  I added boneless breasts for more meat.  I didn't cook the chicken with the garlic, but added the garlic to the broth.  Other than that, the only things I did differently were to add a can of rinsed black beans and chopped cilantro.  Delicious and easy with most items already in pantry.   Update:  so sorry, I rated this one by mistake.  It should've been for the Chicken Tortilla Soup V recipe.  They are similar so I'll try this one too since it looks good.

I loved this receipe...I live in Texas and if we even think its cold we want something warm! This was the best just the way it was, but I omitted the hominy(hubby hates it) and added some citrus zing with lime and cilantro and for the monterrey jack we used Muenster cheese...to die for!!!

We made this dish for our Super Bowl get together. It was a hit! We served it along with pepperjack/cheddar quesadillas, cornbread, and chips and salsa. Great menu! The only modifications that I made were to substitute 2 tsp. of cumin instead of oregano, ommitted the corn and hominy (my husband is not a fan), and doubled the amount of chicken broth. We will make again.

This recipe was a hit with my family & guests!  I've been making this for a few years now.  Since I've become a vegan in the last year, I still make it without the chicken, the cheese and tortillas!  I add a bell pepper, jalapeno and cumin as well.  The hominy makes the recipe (it tastes like corn tortillas).  This freezes well by putting in individual sized containers for lunches.  :)

This is a great soup!  I make a few modifications.  One, no hominy.  Two, no oregano but rather cumin.  I also cook it for about an hour to let the flavors blend more.  I make this soup on a regular basis, and not only is it tasty but healthy as well!

My family loves this soup.  I have made it several times, with minor changes each time.  Sometimes I vary the bean, adding red or evey blackeye peas, more or less corn, omit green chiles, just depends on what is in the pantry.  It is all good.  I have even added dried cilantro when I have been out of fresh and that works great, too. Try it in your crockpot.

Excellent Soup!!  My Mexican friend had me add some Mexican Oregano, cumin, squeeze of lime, and exclude the hominy.

I cooked the chicken, onions, and garlic in the soup pot until soft.  Then I added the other ingredients...broth last.  I cooked it for about an hour.  

Full of flavor!!!  Mmm!

This recipe is a "keeper".  I love Tortilla Soup and this was a tasty version that was easy to make.  I added two cans of chicken broth and deleted the water.  I omitted the hominy and used fresh Hatch green chilis instead of canned.  I wasn't sure about the black beans but they were good in this recipe.

This was my first time ever trying hominy so I wasn't sure what to expect but this soup was great.  I liked that mine was almost a chili-consistency since I cooked it down longer than suggested.  I also added more spices (cumin, more chili powder and a packet of Sazon tropical).  This was really good served with shredded cheese, avocado and cornbread.

The soup was awesome!  It's not really tortilla soup, it's kind of a mixture of different soups all in one.  Even though I wasn't sure what to call it, we really loved it!  I cut the chicken into pieces and cooked it in the oil with the garlic and onion and then just dumped in the other ingredients.  I used 2 cans of chicken stock and no water.  Everything else I left the same.  Cooked it for an hour.  I will be making this soup on a regular basis.

Like many people this is also one of my favorite soups.  I have made it many times and in various ways.  If I want it to be soupier I add more chicken stock (my husband likes it like this) and I usually use fresh green chills that I sauté with the onions and garlic instead of the canned.  I have also made it omitting the hominy when it is not available in m cupboard.... I do like it better with the hominy but if you don't have it still do the recipe, it is amazing!  Thanks.

Amazing.  I used 1/2 cup of mild salsa rather than the chili peppers and was just as good.  I also used two cans of chicken broth and three cans of water, for some extra broth.  Still tasted great!  Also, fresh cilantro is a must!  So fragrant!

I followed the tips from the readers review and used chickpeas instead of hominy. (Cumin instead of oregano) To make more broth I just boiled the bones of the chicken quarters and added it to the end and just added more seasonings if needed. I also added corn - Delicious!!! A big hit from my family and church friends!

My Husband said it was the best tortillas soup he had ever had.  I did make a few changes: used 3 cans of chicken broth (no water) and instead of regular canned tomatoes, I added 2 cans of Rotel tomatoes with Lime and Cilantro.  Also added a few tablespoons of lime juice and some cumin. Excellent recipe.  Thank your for sharing it.

I used some frozen homemade chicken stock that I had made from a whole chicken baked with a Mexican rub under/on the skin and lime juice under the skin/limes inside. I think the Mexican stock really made a difference.

Came out great. I skipped the corn and doubled the Hominy. I used Red Bell Pepper instead of the green chiles to reduce heat for the kids. As a garnish, we provide Sliced Jalepenos and Serranos to add spice to desired level.

Well, I just got done with my 2nd helping of this and OH MY GOSH was it good.  Here are the changes I made.  I used left over fajita chicken from the night before that I had marinated for 48 hours in dry sherry, soy sauce, garlic, sugar, and veg oil.  I misread the amount of chili powder and thought it said 2 TBS, then I caught my mistake so there I was spooning some of it out.  I omitted the hominy and used a larger can of black beans.  I used a cup of frozen corn and 1 can of stewed tomatoes and 1 can of diced which I threw into the food processor for a bit.  I also used bottled, pickled jalapenos in place of the green chilis as I like those better, but I just eye balled to my liking.  This was sooooooooo good!  Thank you!!!

This recipe was a great way for me to use up the majority of the leftovers I had from enchiladas a few nights earlier.

I didn't have any crushed tomatos on hand so I just used tomato soup instead and that worked just fine.

Next time I make this soup I will probably omit the chicken, for some reason I enjoyed the spoonfulls without it better.

Cheese, sour cream and broken tortilla chips on top made the soup just that much better.

Good recipe, thanks.

I hate to write such a bad review, but the overwhelming flavor of this soup was TOMATO!  I used other reviewer's advice, and subbed cumin for the oregano, sauted the chicken, garlic and onions together, then simmered for 1 hour.  Also increased chicken broth to 4 c - good thing b/c the soup was still thick.  But all I could taste was the tomato flavor in my bowl, even with sour cream, cheese and chips.  My husband tried bite (without toppings) and thought it was veggie soup.  I will not be making this recipe again, sorry!

This soup was great! I only changed it by adding cumin vs oregano (a suggestion from other reviews) and adding more chicken broth. My 2 yo twins even loved it.

Delicious! I also found that you can just add chopped avocado to the whole pot at the end, and it holds up just fine.  Easier (and less messy) than adding it to each bowl!

AMAZING!  I added about 2 cups more water because I like my soups more watery.   The second time I made this I omitted the chicken and instead put in an extra can of corn.

Loved it!  I took this to a couples dinner party where we all bring a recipe and vote for our favorites.  Our chicken tortilla soup won 1st place out of 12 other dishes!  Next time I make it though, I'll put in about half of the chicken broth that the recipe calls for so it's a little thicker - more like a chili than a soup.

I love this soup and so does everyone I've made it for. I've been cooking for one for years and have had trouble adjusting to cooking for my boyfriend and his 15 year old son.  This is a recipe that is easy and fast to make and that everyone enjoys!

This is a great recipe that I've made several times now. I think the cilantro is an essential part of this recipe. I usually top with chopped avocados and shredded cheese if I have it on hand. It's also great with cornbread muffins to soak up every drop!

It was good, except it was too thick for me, I like a little more water in my soup, especially when you add the tortilla chips soak up alot of the juices.

I gave this recipe a 4 because it is very good but not OMG good.  We will definitly make it again.  I read a lot of reviews and did the following,  I did not add extra water and used my own chicken stock for all the liqiud.  I added 2 onions, 5 garlic, 2 tsp. cumin, extra chili powder and sour cream as a topper.  I also cooked for 5hrs. covered and on low to blend flavors.  I would highly recommend cooking longer.  For those who are not hominy fans, it really took on the flavor of the soup and was good.  Great recipe to add your own flare and personal touch. My husband said he would have liked it hotter, so I think I will add some crushed red pepper to spice it up.

Excellent - very hearty.  I added a few fresh jalepeno peppers and a bell pepper in place of the canned chiles.  Trying adding the uncooked (even frozen) chicken to the boiling tomato/broth mixture.  Boil til chicken is cooked through and then remove to shread and toss back in.  Very easy!

This was SOOOO DELICIOUS! At first, it looked like this made a LOT, but we only have one serving leftover (there are only 3 of us)! ...that should tell you how good this soup is! We tried it both with and without a dallup of sour cream, and honestly couldn't tell much of a difference. Oh, and I forgot to add the cheese - my Hubby (the mouse) didn't even notice! Very, very, very good soup. Thank you!!!

This was pretty good the first day but it seemed like it was missing something, so I took the others advice and added some cumin and cayenne pepper. It was better but not great. The next day however I ate it with chips and nacho sauce and it was wonderful. Had I not eaten the leftovers I would have missed out and never made it again.

The best tortilla soup.  It's really thick - more like a stew.  It tastes very homemade and I like that it didn't have any premade taco seasoning or salsa in it. 

Use rotisserie chicken

Delicious!!  I didn't use any corn or hominy and used jalapenos instead of chilis as others had suggested.  Will definately make this again!

This soup is DELICIOUS!  I omitted the hominy, and added another can of broth and 1 can water. Best soup I've ever made!

Very yummy! I've never had hominy before and was a little afraid to try it, but the soup turned out very good! I had no cilantro, so I added 1 tsp cumin instead. Great with tortilla chips crushed on top.

Amazing!!  My new favorite food!  I did add about a tsp of cumin.  I used a whole rotisserie chicken and added extra hominey.  Great comfort food!

Great recipe! Quick to do and tasty. I went a bit overboard with chili powder and had to de-hotilize it some, but that was my own doing.

Loved this!  It's so quick and I had all the ingredients on hand(except hominy, which we don't eat anyway) so no shopping necessary.  Added a little cayenne pepper and dinner was served.

Really good soup! I changed the spices to just under a teaspoon each of chili powder, cumin and oregano. Will add more next time. Topped with cheese, avocado tossed with lime juice, sour cream and tortilla chips and would always serve it like that again. Added more broth as others recommended, but would scale back as we thought it might be good thicker. Skipped the hominy, but might try it next time and maybe some red onion on top, too -- there will definitely be a next time!

I LOVED THIS SOUP!!! My boyfriend was so excited to take it to work for lunch the next day. I didn't use oregano, just some more cilantro. I used two cans of chicken broth, instead of water. The flavor was awesome. I also used crushed fire roasted tomatoes which added a nice flavor. Cheese, avacado, and chopped scallion on top really was wonderful. I made Mexican Cornbread with this and it was really delicious together.

this was SO yummy! of course I changed it a little. I doubled up on the recipe so that there would be leftovers and I substituted cumin for oregano and doubled up on the broth (no water) so that it was more of a soup. I also omitted the hominy. I served it with warm corn bread. mmm, so good. I will definitely make this again!

Unbelievably delicious and soooo easy and quick!!! Easily made vegetarian also -- I doubt meat eaters would even miss the chicken. If you like Mexican flavors at all, try this. My 3 kids and my parennts -- none of whom like spicy --all love it, and so do my husband and I, who do. This is now a staple in our house.

Wonderful soup, very filling, my husband loved it!  With extra avocado, cilantro, green onion, a couple tomatoes and little salt, whip up a little guacamole dip with chips for a great accompaniment to this soup.

So, so good!  I didn't have any black beans so I used pinto.  Also we love a super chunky soup so I used more hominy, beans and corn than called for.  Perfect for kids.

Did not care for the taste of the hominy, I would omit this next time. Also, wasn't spicy enough for me, too much tomato taste to the sauce, I expected something hotter.

This soup is amazing!  I read other reviews and took their advice and cooked the chicken in the garlic and onion.  I also added cumin.  Instead of a can of black beans, in the frozen veggies section there is a bagged 'fiesta' mix of black beans, corn, onion, red and green peppers and poblano chili.  I added that in addition to the hominy and a can of corn.  The soup was thick but sooo yummy and filling.  Top with cheese, sour cream, and crushed tortilla chips.

I made this soup and absolutely loved it.  I could not find hominy so did not use it but I dont think it needs it.  Its chunky has a lot of taste and loved the texture and flavor.  I think the tortillas are unnecessary this is a  healthy soup.

Wonderful soup!  Even my picky husband loved it.  Made a few changes.  Instead of can condensed chicken broth & water, I used homemade chicken broth.  I also put in a tsp. of cumin for a smokey flavor and I used frozen corn and used the whole 14 0z. can of hominy.

This was a great recipe. My husband, who doesnt like to try new things, thought it was fantastic. Next time I will add more broth because as it was, it had more of a loose chili consistency.

This is an incredible recipe!  My whole family loves it (that is no small feat).  I did add a can of black beans & more chicken (4 breasts total).  The flavor is fantastic & not too spicy for the kids.  This one's a keeper!

Great! I followed most of the suggestions: used a whole can of corn and horminy, used cumin instead of oregano, didn't use any water, added another can of broth, and used only half of the tomatoes.

I absolutely loved this soup! I didn't add the hominy, or grain of any kind, a perhaps as a result I didn't have the thickness problem that others complained about.  I also chose to shred the chicken instead of chopping it, which in my opinion makes for a better consistency.  I took other reviewers' advice and used cumin instead of oregano.  The result was amazing! I will definitely be making this again.

Loved this soup!  I used a rotisserie chicken to use both light and dark meat, but it was just great.  Loved the hominy. Thanks.

Excellent and easy to make.  I used diced tomatoes and followed the recipe pretty closely.  I thought it might lack flavor but the cilantro gave it the kick it needed.

This one has become a family favourite. It's very good.  The only change I make consistently is to add a fair bit more chicken broth to it than it calls for. A cup or so more the night I make it, then I might add more fluid when I reheat it as well. No matter how much broth you add, it's still a meal in a bowl. You can serve with corn bread or salad.

When I viewed the recipe and read the comments I said I have to make this one.  I tripled the recipe because I had guests coming.  I bought marinated chicken breasts and BBQ them then chopped them to bite size pieces, I was hesitant to add the hominy, but went ahead and added it and couldn't tell they were in the soup. I also added fresh black pepper and sprinkled with red crushed pepper while simmering.  I did serve it with all the condiments; crushed tortilla chips, avocado, green onion and jack cheese.  WOW!!!! What a meal!!  Absolutely delicious!! EVERYONE LOVED IT!

When I make this again I will leave out the hominy, add some jalapenos (I added some crushed red pepper) and possibly add more water again.  This is a very chunky soup.  Great flavor - great soup.

I thought this soup was pretty good, but too tomatoey. I think next time I might try using diced tomatoes instead of crushed (which is essentially tomato sauce). Still, it was filling and tasty. I do plan to try again with a little tweak. Thank you!

This soup is amazing.  I did use a hand blender to puree the soup just a bit before serving.  It broke down some of the hominy (which were quite large) and gave the soup a wonderfully creamy texture.  I served it with chopped green onion, chopped avocado, sour cream and shredded cheddar cheese.  My girls had a great time "topping their own creation".  Will make it again and again.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

This recipe is terrific, the only thing I changed was to omit the hominy (since I wasn't sure that my family would like it)  and add a cup of cooked rice in it's place.

My S.O. wanted to make some soup tonight and I had saved this recipe in my recipe box to try sometime. I can't believe that we waited so long to try this...it was awesome!! He followed the recipe and even garnished it with the avocado, Jack cheese, chips and green onions. This would be a great dish to serve a crowd. This just became one of our favorite recipes!

Excellent!  I've made this for family and friends and have always been asked for the recipe.  I throw a pinch of cayenne pepper in for a little more spice and top with diced avacado.

This is my first "tortilla soup" experience and WOW! This recipe was a huge hit with my whole family, including my extremely picky 4 year old and my 15 month old.  My husband said just tonight, "I think this is the best soup I have ever eaten."  My first thought was that it was a little too tomato-y...so I added about another 3/4 cup water and it was just right. Thanks for the terrific recipe!

I loved this soup!  My husband loved this soup!  We had eaten at Chili's the other day and just loved their chicken tortilla soup, so I thought I'd try something like it.  This was FAR better!!  I also added some tabasco at the end to give it a little kick, and YUMMY!!  Very filling, tasty, and perfect for leftovers the next day.

I made this soup and it was really good, but I would definitely omit the oregano the next time.  I wanted this to be a southwest/mexican dish and the oregano gave it more of an italian taste.  I will try this with some cumin or chile powder the next time.

My daughter made this for us for dinner and we enjoyed it so much, I asked for the recipe to make it myself.  When I made it, I didn't have any diced tomatoes, so I used salsa with cilantro and jalapeno peppers in it and that gave it a little pep -- really good!

Delicious! This is a new favorite. I followed the recipe almost exactly, except in place of the black beans I added a can of diced tomatoes (don't care for black beans that much). I topped it with a little cheddar, green onions and crushed Tostitos chips. I will definitely be making this again. Many thanks for sharing!

Our family's favorite!  I do not add the hominy, and because my husband hates the texture of tomatoes, but likes the taste, I puree my crushed tomatoes which makes the soup a bit more hearty. LOVE IT, and so does anyone and everyone I have ever made it for.

Great Recipe even though I did make a bunch of changes. My husband ate 3 bowls!!! Changes are ... Took out hominy. Added chopped yellow & green squash, 1 cup instant rice, 4 cups of chicken stock, chopped red & green bell peppers. It made a lot but I froze part of it. The last change I will make for next time is using 1 can diced tomatoes instead of crushed. I used so many veggies because it's the only way I can get DH to eat them! Terrific! A keeper for sure.

Excellent recipe.  I made a few changes.  I substituted cumin for oregano, used another cup of broth, shredded the chicken and omitted the hominy.  I just couldn't get enough of it.  Very easy and filling.  We garnished w/ sour cream.  YUM!!!

Great soup!!! I made some changes, based on my love for spicy food - I added a pinch of cumin, two diced fresh jalapenos along with the canned chiles, and omitted the hominy. I also baked corn tortilla strips in the oven (with spray @375) for texture, but the soup didn't need it at all. If you enjoy spicy food, consider adding fresh peppers and chili powder from your ethnic aisle - it really adds flavor.

This is good soup. I also used cumin instead of oregano. I also added some extra chili pepper and hot sauce at the end because it was not spicy enough for us. Definitely better topped with sour cream and jack cheese. Better the next day also!

This was so delicious.  I added crushed red pepper and hot sauce to spice it up a bit.  I also used fiesta corn which really gave it a great flavor.  Thanks so much.

Awesome Soup!!  The best part is it is fast and most of the ingredients are from a can.  It's great topped with monterray jack cheese and tortilla chips!  I wouldn't change a thing, this was a perfect dish!!

My family LOVES this recipe!!  I changed a few of the ingredients like omitting the beans and hominey, substituing cumin for oregano and using more chicken broth.  I have to double the recipe because my husband will eat the whole pot and my 14 yr old actually comes to the table for dinner!

Just made this for lunch and served with cornbread. I used two cans of chicken broth and 1 1/2 cups of water which was plenty of liquid, I also omitted the hominy as I don't care for it and added a can of salsa. Not a jaw dropper but good on a rainy day.

This recipe was awesome. My mom is a picky eater and she had already eaten but she ate a whole bowl and loved it. I agree with other reviews that it was more like a chili or stew rather than soup. I used only broth, not condensed as the recipe called for. Also, I did use the hominy and it gave it a true tortilla soup taste. Instead of adding the cooked chicken, I put in the chicken to cook in the soup then I took it out, shredded it and added it back in. Last thing I did differently is I added corn tortilla chips into the soup and not just as a garnish. I added this toward the end before serving. This soup is awesome and especially tasty the next day!!

I loved this recipe!  I used some of the recommended subs (cumin for oregano) and additions (cream of chicken soup, double broth, no water)...and the result was a HUGE batch of delicious soup.  I also added more chili powder and garlic (as the size of the pot was enormous).
We'll have leftovers for awhile...but that's great, because this freezes really well (like chili). A+!

Yum.  This was good.  Like others I made a few changes.  I left out the hominy, reduced the chili powder by 1/2 a tsp. beacuse my mother (who was coming to dinner) is sensitive to spicy food.  I chose to shred the chicken so it would be more evenly distrubuted and used cumin instead of oreagno.
Since I was cooking chili at the same time my big pot was already in use.  I used a sauce pan to saute the onions and garlic, then added the spices, tomatos (I got the kind with chilis in them since I couldn't find a can of just chilis) and the chicken broth and simmered them.  I added the water (hot from the tap)to my crockpot and turned it on high while the rest simmered.  I then dumped the tomato mix into the crockpot and added the remaining stuff and let it simmer there until my guests arived.
It was a hit all around and several went back for seconds. Thanks for a good, easy recipe that I will make again.

This soup is wonderful!  It is even better the next day.  Great to take as leftovers for lunch.  It is even better with a sour cream as a topping.  But, it is more of a chili or stew than a soup, not much broth to it.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I added some more chicken broth because I didn't want the consistency of chili.  Also added some carrots and some worchestire sauce. I would suggest using diced tomatoes instead of the crushed.  It freezes very well.  Very good recipe.

A nice summer-type version of a black bean chili.  Very flavorful!  I topped with ALL of the garnishes and had some lime sour cream (8 oz. sour cream + juice of 1 lime) as well!!  Yum!!!

I made this recipe for dinner tonight - it was fantastic!  I had leftover roasted turkey from Christmas so it only took about a half hour to make.  Also, I left out the hominy and used 2 cups of turkey broth and it still turned out thick and flavorful. Great recipe will definitely make again.

I have made this soup many times now, and have passed the recipe to several friends.  My whole family ( 10, 7 and 3 year old children and XX year old husband!) enjoys this soup and ask for it often. Super easy and I usually have everything on hand!  Thanks for sharing a great recipe.

This was very good. I udes dry cilantro because the store didn't have any fresh, and it still turned out great. Everyone had seconds, and my family is picky! I think next time I will add some more veggies. Bet it would make a yummy dip for tortila chips with some cheese melted in!

A great soup!  I scaled the recipe to 16 servings for a family Mexican dinner and didn't make a single change.  Everyone (even the kids!) loved it (and we're Irish!).  I chose the recipe because I already had most of the ingredients on hand.  The hominy and black beans were a nice touch, adding a lot of flavor and texture.  It was even better the next day.  Next time, I think I might cut up some corn tortillas to toss in.

This was a great fall soup. I, personally, omitted the hominy and black beans but did add some celery along with mexicorn instead of regular corn. The result-- fantastic! Note: We only had HOT chili powder as opposed to the regular stuff. If you do not like things to spicy, I advise using only 1tsp of hot chili powder for this recipe.

Wow was this ever good!  I left out the hominy and used fresh hot peppers out of my garden instead of canned.  I froze half of this (without the garnishes on top) that way we have an istant meal for later!

I doubled the recipe and shared it with my daughter's teacher, my neighbor, my family and my very busy best friend. I should have tripled the recipe, everyone wanted more. Thank you sooo much.

This is the easiest chicken tortilla soup recipe I've made.This soup is so good and filling! I did make a few changes to suit our tastes. I left out the oregano and hominy, as these are two things I do not like. I also used Chinese hot chili oil instead of the chili powder,and added 1/2 a can of hot tomato sauce. It's called El Pato and comes in a yellow can with a picture of a duck on it. All grocery stores carry it in the aisle with the regular tomato sauces. Go easy, it has a kick to it! I also used the broth the chicken made when I boiled the chicken instead of canned broth. I highly recommend this recipe!!!!!

Nice!  I omitted the corn, black beans, and hominy and added a little fresh squeezed lime juice.  I also used leftover roasted chicken breasts and baked some corn tortilla wedges in the oven instead of the chips.  MMMmm.  I will be making this AGAIN and AGAIN.

Excellant soup!!  I added a little bit of cumin to accentuate the "taco-like" taste.  Instead of crumbled tortilla chips, we misted a flour tortilla with olive oil and baked it at 350 degrees for 5-10 minutes until crisp.  All in all, I can't wait to make this recipe again!

Absolutely yummy! The hominy really added to it. I made a lower fat version, just having hot corn tortillas on the side, and leaving out the chips, cheese, and sour cream. My husband, also loved it! It's a complete meal. But you must garnish with cilantro, lime and avocado. 
So delicious!

This soup is so good.  However, if you cook it like the receipe says to, it'll be pretty spicy.  I suggest you cut the chile part in half if you don't like it to hot.  Other than that, awesome!

This was really good.  I spiced it up a little by adding more chili powder and some hot pepper sauce.  I garnished with diced avacado's, jack cheese, and green onions. Didn't use hominy but added more black beans.  I received rave reviews!

I am not a soup eater.  I loved this soup.
I might change it a little the next time I
make it.  Maybe less vegetables.  I will
probably halve the veggies and not use
the hominy.  But the flavor is perfect!
Just right on the spices.  Loved it.

Followed the recipe mostly (didn’t use beans or hominy bc they don’t belong in a tortilla soup). Very underwhelming soup and I’m not sure how it has so many good reviews. This tasted nothing like any tortilla soup I’ve ever had. I’ll keep looking for a better recipe to try. It was still edible! I just wouldn’t make it again.

I started by baking the 2 chicken breasts at 450 seasoned with salt pepper and cumin for 18 mins. Then I shredded it to add to step 2 of the soup. I followed other’s advice by adding cumin instead of oregano for the first step of the soup. I also added an extra can of chicken broth. I paired it with a cornbread mix that I added jalapeño and cheddar cheese to. My fiancé loved it! Garnished with green onion and sour cream. I omitted the fresh cilantro and don’t feel like it affected the final product.

I used 5 cups of chicken stock to make this. I started with 4 cups but added another cup because it seemed too thick for our liking. After tasting it, I added another teaspoon of chili powder and 1 tsp of cumin. I did not have hominy so I just used 2 cups of frozen corn. I had leftover smoked chicken that I chopped. I also used the juice of 1 lime. I simmered it for about an hour before serving. This recipe has some flexibility and it is easy to suit to your taste. Besides the chicken broth and hominy, I followed the ingredient list but added some things to better suit out tastes. Will make again with these modifications.

This is delicious.  Yes, I made some simple changes.  I did not use the oregano but did use 1/2 tsp cuman and 1 tsp garlic powder.  I also did not drain the black beans,  green chilis, or tomatoes... I used original Rotel tomatoes. My husband loves it.  It was easy to make and will be a favorite of ours.

Great base recipe but i did modify it in the following way. I drained all the cans. I used 4 cups chicken broth and 1 cup water. I boiled the chicken and cut it up into cubes prior to beginning the soup. I did the onion and garlic as instructed but added all of the remaining ingredients after and let simmer for 1 hour. I put 1/2 lime in and added the chicken about 20 min before finishing (about 40min in). I topped the soup with the cilantro, avocado, sour cream, & tortilla strips. I did not add green onion. Great soup and will make again for sure!

What the heck is condensed chicken broth? That confused me immensely, even my main grocery store in Phoenix had no idea about this. So I used a 32oz box of chicken stock instead (and added no extra water.) I added a teaspoon of cumin. I used 2 cups of rotisserie chicken from the store because I suck at making chicken. I added juice from half a lime since I had to use it and it all turned out great! Adding this to the rotation :)

This was amazing! I look for recipes where I can substitute healthier ingredients because I follow the Westin price nutritional guide. I made it as stated but substituted regular broth for chicken bone broth and added some Himalayan  salt.  Also, I omitted hominy and tortilla chips but added grass fed sour cream to top in addition to the cheese and avocado. So good!

It was great. I did change slightly, added only chicken broth and no water, I feel it gives it more flavor. I also simply added chicken breasts to boiling soup prior to adding corn, beans etc...Cook the chicken breast in the broth, onions, tomatoes for around 15 minutes and pull it out and cut it up added it back in with the beans and corn. Less clean up and the chicken gets the flavor!!! Also don't be afraid to add some jalapeno based hot sauce! I like the trader joes jalapeno hot sauce. Amazing recipe great meal.

Fantastic! I made a few changes as per the reviews, and it came out awesome! My husband likes rice in everything (amateur) and my son and I don’t so the hominy was the prefect fit! Excellent flavor and texture!

It tastes good but I agree with others that it is lacking something - more spices, most likely.  Not the perfect recipe - yet.

I like this as a BASE for a great tortilla soup. On its own it's meh but if you tweak it a bit it is great. (I mean does anyone actually stick to recipes?) 

 Here's what I did: 
1) rubbed chicken breasts with the following: equal amounts spicy Mexican chili powder, onion powder, garlic powder. Then Baked for 35 min at 400. Shredded it up and use that 
2) I jacked up the garlic to 7 cloves (basically a whole bulb)
3) added a cube (about a teaspoom) of frozen cilantro (I make this myself with left over cilantro. You food process it with a bit of olive oil and freeze in ice cube trays) 
4) doubled the broth and added a dollop of Better Than Bullion chicken stock 
5) halves the Oregano and added 2 teaspoons of cumin
6) instead of Green Chillies i did a whole can of Total diced tomatoes with green chiles and chipotle peppers
7) added a couple spoons of masa (tortilla base)

We made this today and it was so good. We all loved it. I made just a few changes. I cooked it in a big crockpot. I first sauteed the garlic and onions in olive oil before putting them in the crock. Then I dumped everything else on top and let it cook on low for about 5 hours. It smelled wonderful and tasted the same. We garnished it with crushed tortilla chips, grated cheddar cheese, avocados, sliced green onions, and sour cream. We also added a second can of beans and left out the cilantro.

I made this in my Instant Pot and I feel the flavors we better infused versus cooking on the stove top. 

I made the following changes: I swapped oregano for cumin, added 2 cans of chicken broth and 2 cups of water, I added 2 teaspoons of salt and used a cooked rotisserie chicken from the store. This saved time cooking the chicken. 

I don’t ever sauté in my instant pot. I dump all the ingredients in and used sauté on high to the soup while I cooked the onion and garlic in a pan on the stove. I incorporated the garlic and onion into the mix once cooked and I cooked this soup in my Instant Pot on high pressure for 20 minutes.

Good basic recipe.

I amended this recipe a bit to recreate a very good tortilla soup I had in a local restaurant recently.   The basic recipe was very close and was pretty nice as is, but I thought the chile flavour was overpowered by the tomato.   To get it closer to what I was after, I used a teaspoon of smoked cumin powder and a tablespoon of my own chile powder made with dried pasillas.  That was the missing flavour.  I also pureed the tomato/onion mix before adding the final ingredients. Next time I'll just use two tablespoons of pasilla chile powder.  If you can, make your own chile powder.  It's much more flavourful than the stuff in jars.

Super easy and very flavorful! I made the shredded chicken in my Instant Pot ahead of time, so it was quick and easy to make on a week night. I didn't have hominy so I used garbanzo beans.  Not bad, but I will use hominy next time for a more unique balance of textures.   Used all the recommended toppings and they were great!  Will definitely make again.

I used this recipe loosely and I have to say it was one of the best soups I have ever had. I used fireroasted tomatoes because its what I had on hand. I added cumin, a little tomato paste, a bell pepper and a jalapeño also I excluded the hominy. It was absolutely delicious and I will certainly make it again.

I simmered tons of garlic, cilantro, green and white onions in olive oil for 15 minutes. Added cut up rotisserie chicken, Johnny’s, oregano, taco, lime and lemon juice, ghost pepper seasoning salt and let it simmer for half an hour. Added boiling water, black beans, diced tomatoes, chicken broth & mixed vegetables. Made a paste out of the broth and Argo starch to thicken the soup. Served with sour cream, fresh cilantro, green onions, lime juice and tortillas. Delicious!

Family loved it!  I think next time, I will  try cumin instead of oregano. Today, I used oregano, and sprinkled in a little cumin.  Bottomline, it was good with both.

There was more vegetables than chicken in the soup. Had to add more liquids to keep it in soup form, and there wasn't much flavor to it, so added some of my own to spice it up. It was fine.

I could not for my life find white hominy in my area so I used 1 cup of canned corn in its place. It was delicious however it had no heat to it at all and we were expecting it to have a bit of heat. It was very good and I’m sure it will be so much better if I find the hominy. Thank you for this recipe

Big hit with the family! I moderated the powdered chili and substituted pinto beans in for black beans...it came out just fine, but the beans didn't hold up as well as the black beans would have. For garnish, I added a splash of lime juice for some zing!

This is great! Couldn't be better. I used half the onion, though, because I use those larger yellow onions, and I thought it was WAY too much. When it was done I was very happy I didn't add more.

I had followed the instructions, but the only difference was that I had shredded a rotisserie chicken a couple nights before and used that (:    Still tasted great but made one step a bit faster and easier! Loved it!

I LOVE this soup, as does my hubby and daughter. It is super easy and very yummy. The only changes I made were that I added an entire can of the corn as well as the hominy instead of just 1 cup (mostly because I didn't want it to waste). I also added more than the 10 or so oz. of chicken broth. I used 64 oz. altogether. I know that sounds like alot but it was two of the tall cartons. The end result was perfect.

Made this for guests that do not like spicy food. I used cumin as suggested and two cans chicken broth. Everyone enjoyed it but I would use more chili powder for our family that prefers spicy food.

Excellent soup!  I followed some of the other recommendations (use of cumin, only chicken broth, eliminating hominy, and adding sour cream at the end) and it was fantastic.  I will make this again and again!

My family liked this and we'll definitely make it again! I just made a couple of minor changes: 1. I didn't know what condensed broth was, so I just used regular broth and omitted the water; 2. 1 added a chopped jalapeno because we like spicy; 3. 1 shredded my chicken instead of cutting; 4. I baked my own tortilla strips instead of using chips. I loved that each person could garnish to their liking. Yummy and easy!

This was delicious and my fiance who claimed he didn't like chicken tortilla soup said he is now a fan. I followed the recipe except I subbed cumin for the oregano, used diced instead of crushed tomatoes and cut corn off the cob and added it raw. I couldn't find hominy so I added a little extra corn. I seasoned chicken thighs and boiled them whole with some carrots, celery, and spices while I was prepping the other ingredients and used the cooking liquid, plus some chicken bullion, instead of canned stock. I let the chicken cool before shredding and adding to the soup. Topped with a Mexican cheese blend, green onions, and sour cream. Definitely looking forward to making this again!

Fantastic!!! I put chicken tenderloins in the crock pot on high for 3 hours so they would shred, which made for a nice consistency in the soup. Left out chile peppers to make it for the kids and it was perfect with no spiciness at all. Eager to try it next time adult-style!

With any recipe you have to tweak it to your taste so Instead of chicken chunks, I boiled my chicken in broth, then deboned it so it was stringy, added more chili seasoning, added taco seasoning and I skipped the harmony and added mushrooms, extra corn and spinach. I was surprised that the olive oil that I simmered my veggies gave it a thicker texture.. I always use less water and add if needed.. adding is easier than taking away I always say.. Anway I allowed it to simmer for 2 hours on low heat which made the flavors pop and gave it a silky texture and huuuum the smell and before serving in my personal bowl I added fresh tortillas, cilantro and chives at the end and it was ammmmmmazeballs! No complaints at all   :-)

Made this tonight, using the original recipe.  Thought I would see what changes I would make on succeeding tries.  Enjoyed it very much, but agree I would use more broth to thin it out and of course add more spices.  The only things I added were another 4 oz, of green chilis and a few shakes of crushed peppers, as we like things “spicy”.  Both hubby and son loved it!

I made it exactly the way recipe called, I didn’t like the  water part and wish I would’ve went with my gut and just used more broth. It was watery to us. But we still enjoyed it and I will used broth next time. Also added sour cream to our add in ingredients.

DELISH! BUT- I made changes (Did not follow as written). Here's what I did:
1. Sauteed a very large onion in the pot with 3 cloves of garlic in olive oil (+salt and pepper)
2. Added cumin (about a tablespoon), 2 small cans diced green chilis, and a chopped poblano pepper
3. Added my raw chicken and cooked.
4. Added chicken  BROTH (not sure what all this 'condensed broth' nonsense is about), the crushed tomato, a can of black beans (drained), and a whole bag of frozen corn.
4. Added hot sauce (to taste) and cilantro
5. Let simmer together for an hour.
 
Top with cheese and crushed tortilla chips.

WONDERFUL!

The prep work was minimal and dinner was ready in about 40 minutes.  The family loved the flavor and the filling nature of the soup.  This is definitely a dinner I will make again.

This is a tomato soup recipe.  I am trying to dilute it with more chicken broth and water and adding some salt and pepper and other spices to make it actually taste like tortilla soup. Awful!

It was good but I wouldn’t call it restaurant quality.  Flavors were good makes way more than needed for one meal for a family of 4 needs.  I will have to freeze some and see how that goes.  Doubt I’ll make it again.

I have made this soup twice now and it’s amazing! I only added a couple of ingredients. I like things a little more spicy so I got 3 fresh jalapeños, sliced them and let them boil in the soup. I used oregano, cumin and knorr. About a tablespoon of each. I also use 32ounces of chicken broth and no water. Delicious!!! As far as the chicken, I boil it in water, salt and cumin until it’s cooked all the way through. Then shred it while it’s warm with a fork. :)

Love this recipe.  Easy to make, and delicious.  I didn’t have fresh cilantro or garlic, so I used  dried.  I recommend this on a cool Fall day!

Good recipe! I made it for  my boyfriend and I as we get into fall and want some hearty, warm food in the evenings. I was (almost) a purist when it came to following the ingredients, only reducing the oregano to 1/2 tsp and adding 1 tsp cumin.

Initially this resulted in a bland tasting soup base, so I went back in and seasoned more aggressively. I added more chili powder, a good amount of salt, pepper, garlic powder, and more oregano. This gave me a much more flavorful soup that I enjoyed much more. I also chose to simmer the soup for much longer than  10 min. I went for a full hour to really get a good marriage of flavors. 

Overall, good recipe. Just go in and flavor to taste!

I added fresh jalapeno to give it a good kick. I also didn't have concentrated chicken broth so I added less water and more broth. It's filling stick-to-your-ribs soup.

Delish! I followed the suggestion to sub oregano for an additional tsp of cumin. I used a store bought rotisserie chicken and served with tortilla strips and fried jalapeños.

10/6/18:  Great!  I did make a few tweaks.  I quadrupled the broth and didn't use water, I at least doubled the hominy, I doubled the green chiles, and I added a good amount of salt.  SUPER yummy!

Absolutely loved it! I made this on a chilly Friday night for myself and two roommates. I don't cook too often, and had never made tortilla soup but it's hard to go wrong! I did eye ball the amounts of a lot of the mix-ins, usually not adding as much as is listed here. If anything, I would recommend to use more broth and water to make it a little less chunky and let it stretch it a little further! Overall, a great hit and will definitely look to make this again!!

This is a really good chicken tortilla soup recipe. I made it in the crockpot and that worked just fine. I usually add a can of cheddar soup in my tortilla soup but made this one to recipe since this was a new recipe. I think next time I’ll add the soup. It adds a nice creaminess and depth that I think would have enhanced this one.

I was hoping to create a tortilla soup that is similar to one I get at a local restaurant and this came pretty close with some modifications.  I skipped the chicken altogether  to make this a vegetarian recipe. I used 3 cups chicken broth and no water.  I also squeezed in half a lime, substituted shredded Mexican chihuahua cheese, substituted cumin for oregano,  and added avocado at the end. Very flavorful!

Great recipe with some minor revisions. I added a splash of lime. I don’t know what Hominy is, so I didn’t put it in,  didn’t have canned chilies, so I added fresh diced jalapeño and red chilies. I used chicken broth instead of the water, shredded turkey instead of the chicken, and a TON more cilantro! Used mixed beans instead of black (because that’s all I had) It was super-delicious!!

Delicious soup with some tweaking. Added lime juice; cumin and crushed tortilla chips. Skipped the hominy. Let cook for over an hour. Used 2 cups of homemade chicken broth. Big hit with everyone in my family

Fresh and delicious authentic base soup. Modification: I didn't add the black beans, hominy or chili powder. Used sliced Anaheim chilis and non-canned chicken broth. Added a little chipotle chili juice for smokiness and heat (the only chili I know is used in tortilla soup).

I made changes garlic, cumin chili powder and more broth.
I cook chicken in crock pot day before.  I use celery, carrots, 1 potato, beans, corn and rotel tomatoes.  I also add few white corn torillas.  My family loves.

Really loved this recipe. I added smoky paprika that brought up a less tomato taste. So filling and goes a long way. I I’ll make again.

Only changes I made was sweating off some diced onion, carrots, celery trimmings and garlic.  I then added a box of chicken stock, then to it a portion of the beans.
Then I took the immersion blender to it to create a thicker base.  Once this was done, the rest of the soups cooked ingredients were added.
Definitely a make again

My husband loved this!  I ised Rotel's diced tomatos with chili since I was out of the other tomatos, and I was also out of black beans unfortunately, because I love those, but used dark red kidney beans.  I used Wahoo Chili seasoning and it gave it a fine kick!  I love that I can freeze this.

This soup is good and hearty, but I made a few changes incorporating a similar recipe.  I did not use oregano or hominy.  I also used 2 cups of chicken broth rather than condensed chicken broth and water.  Lastly, I squeezed lime juice in it just before serving.  Yummy!

Spectacular!  My hubby said we could have this soup 2-3 days a week while its cold.  Made a couple of minor changes.  First, I used ~3 lbs of boneless thighs cooked with chili powder and oregano.  I left out the corn, opting instead for a full can (15oz) of hominy.  I used a quart of chicken stock and about 2T of chopped jalepenos because I had them, but didn't have green chilis.  Served 5 (including 3 teenagers), with enough left over for one lunch.  Quick and easy.  Definitely a week night option for me.

The thing I love most about leftover turkey is the tortilla soup I can make later.  This is a really good recipe, but I did change a couple of things. I added tomato and chicken bouillon, more hominy, cumin, salt, and shredded cabbage garnish.  My husband and I debated on if we wanted to save room for dessert. Very delicious!

This soup is fantastic! I’ve made I many times and have froze it for future meals. I followed a few comments and used cumin instead of oregano. I use 1 carton of low sodium chicken broth and add the water slowly while simmering. I simmered most of the ingredients for an hour, then added in the chicken (I shred it), corn (I use 1 1/2 cups), and beans. I don’t use hominy. I also add salt and pepper and garlic powder while cooking. Continue to simmer for about 30 mins.

I don't care for hominy so I exchanged that with more corn. I also used a little more garlic cloves and added the cilantro last, just before serving. To me, it seems to lose a lot of flavor when it is cooked for too long. I have been making this recipe since I found it in 2001. It's delish! Thank you Star Pooley.

I love the recipe the only change that I made was that I had cooked some chicken breasts in my slow cooker until they shredded so that it was dispersed throughout the soup but other than that I pretty much followed the recipe as stated… Awesome!

I followed the review of the person who added more chicken broth. I cooked up the carcass from a store bought rotisserie chicken and used that broth. It was 4 cups.  Hubby and I both thought it was fantastic!

Very tasty!  I made the recipe just as it is.  The family really enjoyed it!  Definitely serve it with the avocado and crushed chips!...I also made some cornbread the same day as I made this chili.  The two made for a great combo, the bread worked well with the tortilla chips.

Great base and can make so many variations. Agree with others to use broth versus water. Quick and easy.

This was delicious--i did make a few changes as a result of the other reviews.  I did add 2 cans of chicken broth since I wanted it to have more of a soup consistency.  With two cans, it was not runny by any means.  I added lime juice and left out the oregano.  I let it simmer on the stove for 1 hour for the flavors to blend.   I will be making this again and again!

The taste was good and it was easy to make.  Unfortunately because of so  much tomato onion and green chiles this soup triggered my acid reflux.  I will have to throw it away.  If your sensitive to acidic foods stay away from this recipe.

I was looking to use 3 chicken breasts I had in the  refrigerator.  I pan cooked them slowly till they were nice and tender.  Followed directions  but adde the extra chicken. I was afraid my picky 14 yr old would turn up his nose at the black beans but no problem, he scarfed down a bowl before I sat down. Chips, cheese, hot sauce and sour cream.  Everyone loved it.

It was fantastic and won approval from a very picky eater! I boiled the chicken (used in the soup), then used the stock in place of broth and water (called for in recipe). I didn't have hominy on hand so left it out, and it was still deeeeeelish!!

Left out  corn and hominy, added liquid smoke and more seasonings, great way to repurpose grilled chicken breasts, used home made vegetable broth from freezer, added sliced jalapeño, double onion, double celery, used sharp cheddar had on hand,  way awesome, doubled the chili powder and oregano

One of the best tortilla soups I've ever had.  We made it without the chicken and it was still soooooo good.  We omitted the hominy and subbed 2 cans of regular chicken broth instead of the condensed chicken broth + water.  Turned out great!

I followed most of what user JENNANTHONY did , however, I used regular chicken broth, not condensed. I also did not have cumin. It was delicious! It definitely needed to cook for an hour !

This is an excellent soup! It's a few extra steps than other recipes I've seen, but definitely worth it and not a big deal! We're not garlic lovers so I left it out. With the other spices, though, it really wasn't missed.

It's thick and hearty, which I love but too tomatoey for my taste. If I were to make it again, I would add half the tomatoes that the recipe calls for.

Great soup! I had the ingredients on hand, except hominy and only one can of tomatoes. It turns out that one can was perfect for my taste, and I will make it that way again in the future.

I made it for the heat sensitive grandchildren so reduced the chili powder and eliminated the green chilies.  But the end result was still very tasty and they liked it.

Good base recipe. I added beef bone broth cilantro to the pot along with a lot of ?? powder and oregano. I do like my tortilla soup with a light base broth.  Will definitely make this again. Served topped with avocado, cheese, sour cream and tortilla strips

Last night was my first attempt to make chicken tortilla soup and it came out excellent! Thanks to this recipe and the suggestions given in the reviews. Modifications I made to the recipe include sautéing an ancho chile pepper with the onion and garlic, substituting chicken broth for the water, added 1 can of enchilada sauce, adding 1 tsp of cayenne pepper, substituting cumin for the oregano, added 1 tsp garlic powder,and  substituting corn for the hominy. The soup was not as soupy as I wanted, perhaps because I added the enchilada sauce, so I ended up adding a cup and half of water. I did not add cilantro until serving. I cut corn tortillas into thin slices, placed them on a baking sheet, sprayed them with olive oil, sprinkled sea salt on them, and baked them for about 20 minutes. Served with green onions, cilantro, and tortilla strips. I like my soup somewhat spicy. It was delish!!

Delicious!  I did make a couple of changes after reading other reviews:  instead of 1 tsp. Oregano, I added 1/2 tsp oregano and 1/2 tsp cumin; used chicken broth instead of water.  Very tasty!!

This as excellent!  I've made this a few times now. It's so easy and healthy too.  I don't use hominy or oregano, personal preference. I do add a good amount of chili powder and cumin, as well as garlic powder.  I sauté the onion, red pepper, and garlic in pan for 8-10 minutes, then add spices and cook for 5 minutes. Then add crushed tomatoes and one can of fire roasted crushed tomatoes (this added a nice flavor) and one 32 ounce carton of low sodium chicken broth and let simmer for one hour. Then add two cans of drained & rinsed black beans and corn.  Cook for additional 15 minutes then add the cooked chicken at the end, to heat through.  I cook the chicken, sliced in half so it's thinner and coat it with garlic powder, salt & pepper, and cook in my pampered chef deep oval baker in the microwave for 5 minutes for each side. Then shred the chicken.  This turns out so moist and excellent, not rubbery at all. I add this at the end to the soup.  To serve, ladle soup into  a bowl, top with crushed up tortilla chips and Mexican cheese.  Delicious!

Very good!   Subbed cumin for oregano.  Subbed corn for hominy.   Sub  one can Rotel for chopped green chilies. .  Baked whole wheat tortilla, thinly sliced until crisp and added them to soup upon serving.

WAY to much tomato. And I don't think I like the hominy in it. It would do in a pinch but definitely not making it again

Loved the crushed tomatoes, as it added a whole new depth of flavor.  I didn't have black beans, so I added pinto beans, and they were delicious.  Loved it!

Made this a couple of times now.  My daughter doesn't like black beans so I left that out.  I substituted a wild rice mix instead.  I think a combo of beans and rice would be ideal.  Thus is a winner!

This is now my favorite chicken tortilla soup. So good! Yes, I did make seasoning changes: less oregano, added cumin and a little hot chili; used a can of fire-roasted tomatoes. My chicken breast was frozen so I poached it first in the chicken broth, then shredded the chicken and put it back in the broth. The chicken, onion, garlic and seasoning were simmered  for an hour. The canned items were added and simmered another half hour.

I made this tonight for my children, and I loved it! I am just learning how to cook and I was looking for something easy. I must admit I was scared I was going to mess it up after reading all the comments, however I just followed the recipe, and followed some of the suggested in the comments  and it came out great. Only thing I did not use is the white beans or whatever they are called. I also used all fresh organic ingredients.

I've made this soup several times and love it.  I omitted the oregano for cumin as several others did and used all chicken broth (3 cups) instead of broth and water.  Also I used whole cans of hominy and corn.  It's about the same.  This recipe can easily be made low fat by leaving off the avocado, cheese and chip garnishes.  The fat per serving goes down to around 3.0 instead of 19.

The general idea of this soup is wonderful! I love soup, and so does my husband. We can eat it even in a hot day. 

I dogs make a few adjustments to my liking. I did put a can of condensed chicken broth. But I Also added some reduced sodium chicken, as well as a bit of water. I like soup to be a bit hearty rather than runny, which is why I did this. 

I have no idea where to find hominy, so I couldn't add that. I did put some corn. I also toasted some corn tortilla to make my own chips, which is so much better than crushing some store bought chips.

All in all, very tasty soup!

Love this recipe and thank you for sharing  it! The only changes that I made to this dish was that I added salt and a packet of chicken bouillon. And I did not add the green chillis because my kids won't like it.

Delicious!! I followed the recipe and having read the reviews made a few edits of my own. 
edit 01 - Put Cumin instead of oregano;
edit 02 - Put the spices before the tomatoes and broth so they could cook and blend a bit (low heat - about 2 minutes) prior to the sauce; 
edit03 - put a boxful of 32 oz organic chicken broth instead of the condensed chicken broth and water;
edit 04 - put two teaspoons of vinegar (amazing!);
Overall the soup turned out absolutely delicious!! Hubby went to get some for a midnight snack as well lol

So easy! Really good last-minute dinner- if you really want to speed up this recipe, buy a rotisserie chicken from the store and simply shred 2-3 cups of it into the soup.  Boil your own corn and cut it from the cob if you can- tastes much better than canned corn.  Feel free to leave the black beans out if you aren't into beans- they are just a filler.  Cheers!

I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this recipe. I have made this many times in large quantities for church pot luck and it is always gone by the end. Even the pickiest people love this soup. I am one of those people that usually tweaks every recipe to make it my own, but I don't have to with this one. Made just as directed is amazing! Thank you for sharing this recipe!

The soup turned out really yummy though I didn't have all the ingredients on hand. I made it without the hominy, the green chili peppers, the oregano. I generously used the cumin and the chili powder. The chicken was precooked and used the broth I cooked the chicken in. I ate it with tortilla strips, cheddar cheese, the green onions, and sour cream. I will definitely make it again!

I substituted left over turkey for the chicken and added 2 more cans chicken broth and a half cup of uncooked rice. I also cooked the onion, tomatoes, broth, rice, and spices for 30-60 minutes before adding corn and chicken/turkey. So yummy!!

I was excited about the ratings and have been looking forward to making this soup. It wasn't what I expected. it comes out very thick, like a chili, not a soup. My husband explained it perfectly. It's like eating chicken and hominy mixed with pace picante. Disappointed overall...

I was really excited to make this soup because of all the great reviews. I followed the recipe exactly, but after seeing the thickness of the soup, I quickly read some of the reviews and decided to add in the rest of my 32 oz container of chicken broth (had only used 10.5 oz originally like recipe called for), another cup of water, and a bit more chili powder and oregano. It didn't help the flavor. The soup is SUPER bland. And VERY tomato heavy. It really wasn't a hit at my house at all, and we love tortilla soup. :( I'm disappointed. This recipe did not deliver and I won't make it again.

I used 1/2 a package of taco seasoning to season the chicken breast and baked it in the oven. I used the other 1/2 of the seasoning mix in the soup (in place of the chili powder).

Maybe I did something wrong but I didn't really love it. I read the reviews and took the advice of others to replace water with broth, use shredded chicken and let simmer for an hour or more. Still, seemed to lack flavor. We added Tabasco after pouring into bowls which helped a bit. Do not think I would make again.

Based on what I had on hand - switched to small white beans , instead of black beans. Used two whole jalapeños diced instead of chiles. Omitted hominy but added two stalks celery sliced thick. Very good - I suggest to add milk or cream if u want more creamier texture ..

I've made this several times and it's one of my husband's favorites!  Of course, changed a few things to meet our tastes.  I made this for company so I increased the amount of chicken to 2 lbs, cooked them whole and then shredded about  1/2 hour before serving (added back to soup at end).  I used all very low sodium chicken broth instead of water + broth.  Added more garlic (we love it),  1 1/2 tsps. regular chili powder and  1 1/2 tsps. chipotle chili powder.   Also added a 4 ounce can of fire roasted green chilies, 1 can low sodium black beans, and used diced tomatoes with jalapenos instead of whole crushed tomatoes.  I added the cilantro at the end when I added the shredded chicken and lime juice.  Seems like I changed a lot but really just modified for the degree of spice and texture to what we like.  Everyone loves this recipe.

I whipped this up in half hour!  I switched pinto beans for the black beans and left out cilantro (don't like it).  Soup was amazing!!

I found a chicken broth with the tortilla chicken base and  added cumin, one can of Rotel (tomatoes with green chilies) and 1 can  crushed tomatoes so no need for additional chiles I also used rotisserie chicken to cut down on prep time and added at the end just to warm up. The soup tasted great, not too spicy; total cook time 30 minutes. 
Note: I liked it better without  the cheese, it  didn't add much flavor , just stuck to my spoon

I really enjoyed the soup it went over well with the entire family, I spiced it up a bit more, I because that's what I do, if I've been a certified gourmet chef for over forty years, I but am always looking for new recipes or additional ideas I can implore into my cooking, because they teach you mainly French dishes, I but I'm a Jew not orthodox though so I eat pork, ham, and shellfish. I want to learn as much about cooking various foods as I can it's been almost a life long journey, thank you for this recipe, this app, and Shalom.

This was wonderful. Only changes made were to increase the amount of chicken broth. It was a bit too "tomatoey" as is. Also added juice of one lime to the soup while cooking. Terrific!

Best tortilla soup recipe I have found. I prefer mine to be thicker, not so watery, so the addition of crushed tomatoes is perfect. I followed the recipe with only a few minor changes. After sautéing the onion & garlic for a few minutes, I added in 4 raw chicken breasts & cooked them in the pot for 20 minutes.  I then removed the chicken & shredded it in my kitchen aid mixer before returning it. I omitted the hominy, used 1/2 t cayenne & 1t cumin in place of chili powder. I also added a squirt of lime juice. Cheese, green onions, cilantro, avocado, tortilla strips & sour cream are must have toppings.

I like spicy foods & I thought it was a little  too spicy.  Using sour cream, Monterey jack cheese & avocado for condiments helped.

As the recipe is this soup has no flavor and too watery and tomatoy. After I added a  2 to 3 more cans of broth, a pack and a half of taco seasoning, and another can of chiles it was savory and goodAnd of course salt to taste (this recipe had no mention of salt). All was great with the changes I made.

Great recipe, very easy to make. I actually added 32 oz of chicken broth, about 12oz of water, omitted the hominy and fresh roasted Hatch green chile instead of canned. I also seasoned and cooked the chicken before adding it. I will definitely make this again!

This is  "The Best Tortilla soup ever" according to all that have tried it including my 4 kids. I use a few different items such as one full chicken broth box, along with 1 Tsp ground Chile de Arbol. Every single time, it's the hit of the table, no matter what else is there!

Delicious!  I used broth in place of the water, added some cumin, turmeric, and extra veggies, and let it cook for about 30 minutes longer to develop more flavor.  We loved it!

First off, thank you for the base to begin with. I used All the listed ingredients and then some. Of course, I modified it a bit to suite our taste. I used 1 14.5oz can crushed and 1 14.5 oz. can diced tomatoes. I do use the Oregano. Many Mexican dishes call for Oregano.  I added a teaspoon of Cumin, we like the deep hearty flavor it brings. Looked a lil thick, so I added 1 cup water with a lil chicken bullion. I prefer shredded chicken vs. chopped so I seasoned and lightly browned my chicken a bit, then added it to the soup that I transferred into the crock pot. Just before dinner, I will pull it out, shred it an return it to the soup. I have sautéed my onion and garlic before and thrown everything into the crock pot and let it do all the work as well.  Everyone loves it either way. I had a lil more time today.

I made this recipe exactly as it said. This is my favorite recipe. I've made it several times and it has always come out perfect. The flavor is amazing.  If people are saying it's too runny, it's probably because they didn't get condensed soup.  Regular broth has water in it,  so if that's what you are using,  don't add water.

So, I love this recipe. It's a great base to play with and make your own, but it's also delicious following the recipe exactly. I've made this dozens of times, and it has morphed into something slightly different, as often happens with an experienced cook. So, I'll include how I change it, but don't hesitate to try this one as is.
I use fresh corn, and saute it with onions and bell peppers, then garlic before adding it to a slow cooker. I don't add the green chilis - that's just a taste preference. I scrape the corn cobs with my knife for the corn milk to thicken the soup. I also add 1/3 cup of pearled barley, which makes the soup almost like a chili, but it's really delicious. I add 2 Tbs. of sugar to offset the canned taste of the tomatoes, and a good shake of Worcestershire sauce. I make my own chicken stock, so I'm sure that improves it, and I add the chicken drippings separated from the fat from the roast chicken I will add to it later. I don't add water, only stock or broth. Watch what kind of chili powder you use; if it's hot, the soup can get very spicy. I let this come together in the slow cooker for several hours, and add the chicken and fresh cilantro towards the end. This recipe made me a hominy lover. This soup is really addictive and delicious! A great dinner staple that can be made in large batches and frozen.

I did make a few changes:
-Used 32 oz of Pacific OG low sodium chicken broth and eliminated the water.
-Used 1 can of OG Great Northern white beans instead of hominy as I cannot find OG hominy.
-Added ½ of a haas avocado, chopped up
-Omitted Oregano, not a fan
This soup was thick, flavorful and so yummy!

Awesome! We LOVE this soup! I let people put cilantro in separate, since is repulsive to some unfortunate palates ;). Ooh, and slice lime wedges to squeeze into individual bowls—perfection!

I made my stock from scratch, bones and skin.  I think that makes for a completely different take on an easier version. My roommate doesn't like tomatoes or onions, except the dried ones, so left out the tomatoes and used dried minced onions.  Turned out great!!

It was absolutely delicious! I did not add any hominy and I used shredded chicken instead. Also I did not use the can of chicken broth or water I just used the chicken broth from boiling the chicken. Will be making this again very soon!

I put 2 whole chicken breasts with 20 ounces of chicken broth and a packet of taco seasoning in crock pot for 3 hours. 

Then i sautéed onion,  garlic,  cumin,  salt,  oregano, and double the chili powder for about 3 minutes.  I added just one can of corn,  beans,   crushed tomatoes,  and chili till it reached to a boil. 

I added these ingredients to the crock pot with the cilantro. Kept on low another 3 hours.

Shredded the chicken and went for a taste of the soup!  It was so delicious I had to hide all my "taste tests" from my inlaws! I couldn't stop! 

I bought sour cream,  lime, cheese, green onion, and tortilla to add on top but I don't see how anything could make this any better! Thought I would add them before I served the dish but now I think it's best to set them out for everyone to tailor the soup to his/her taste buds.

In other words. ......YUMMM!!!!!!!!

I didn't make any changes.  I like the "soupiness" about it because I like dipping fresh tortillas into it.  It made a lot so I froze the other half.

So easy and so good. I shred the chicken breast rather than cube it. Use it for luncheons and the guests always rave about it and want the recipe.

I used some leftover rotisserie chicken from Costco and used two cans of diced tomatoes.  Also, I didn't have condensed chicken broth so I used a box of chicken stock instead. Other than that, cooked the soup as directed and it turned out great!  My wife and kids enjoyed it and said it was one of the best soups ever!  Thanks for the recipe.

we stage our tortilla soup a little differently.  we place the tortilla strips, chicken, monterrey jack cheese,  and avacado in the bowl. then pour the broth over right before serving (the broth is just the soup part with the chicken broth, garlic, onion, and corn). yummy!

I started with a pre-cooked Costco chicken, stewed it in 6 cups of water.  Strained liquid. De-boned, then cubed white and dark meat.  Added all ingredients in recipe with a few changes.  A squeeze of fresh lime, 1 can of kidney beans, 1/2 of tomatoes listed, some red chili flakes, 1 1/2 green beans, and left over 1 1/2 yellow corn on the cob kernels, 3 small mixed bell peppers 3/4 cup diced.  I didn't add garbanzo or black beans because I didn't have them on hand.  Salt and pepper to taste.  Served with cilantro, and cojita cheese sprinkled on top, & diced avocado.  Crumble in chips or make your own strips.  Yum!  Very colorful due to kidney beans and yellow corn.

This soup was a hit!  I added a little extra chicken broth just because we like our soup thinner (and so then I also added a little more chili powder and a touch of garlic salt).  My whole family loved it.  I'll definitely make it again.

Always delicious! I do however shred my chicken rather than dice it. Super easy-just boil some water, prep your items while the chicken is cooking.  Once the chicken done, I just put it in my mixer while it's hot and voile, shredded chicken!  This is a thick soup, more like a stew. I just add more water and broth.  Also, I portion out the soup once it's done and freeze it. Turns out perfectly! Just go to the store and get some fresh avocado to serve with it :)

Bland. Just bland. It was like a movie you know will end badly but you hold out hope it turns around. Nope. One of the very few times I have been duped on this site by a 4.5-star rating from a large number of reviewers and it turns out to be a total disappointment. This one's hitting the round file.

Here goes...I am basing my review off of the changes recommended by JENNANTHONY99. I did as they recommended, for the most part. I did not add an extra can of water, and I am glad I didn't. I followed the seasoning recommendations, but it seems like every recipe I try from this site ends up tasting bland. It's an easy fix. I seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, and garlic powder on both sides. Then, I cooked it with the garlic and chopped onion. I shredded it, and dropped it in my electric pressure/slow cooker with the 4 cups of chicken broth, corn, pinto beans (didn't have black beans), canned chile peppers, and diced tomatoes. I added the seasonings. Chili powder, garlic powder, salt, pepper, a bit of cayenne pepper, and cumin instead of oregano. It wasn't enough. I added more of each seasoning until it improved. The chips help a lot with the finished product. Finally, I cooked the soup for five minutes at high pressure. I wish I could find an accurate McAlister's chicken tortilla soup recipe. This was alright, but not close enough.

Very good recipe, everyone loved it. I did add about 1/2 teaspoon of salt. I used regular (uncondenced) low sodium broth and I added 32 oz, a little bit more than recomended. Maybe if I used regular sodium then the extra salt might not have been needed.

The only major difference I do to this recipe is swap the water for chicken broth.  It is a great recipe on its own and as a base for other spice flavors such as those others have added in the reviews.  You really can't go wrong with this one.  I usually season my chicken before I cook it with a little cumin, chili powder, garlic & onion powder, oregano, and s&p.  Seems to give it a little more pizazz.  Leftovers are good too.

the best recipe out there. I add other beans to it like pinto, garbanzo, plus the black beans, and i add diced tomatoes. Also instead of using the 2 teaspoons of chili powder, i use 1 teaspoon of ancho chili powder, and 1 teaspoon of red chili powder. it gives the soup a nice kick to it. 

i love this

I tweaked the recipe a bit, as I love a lot of flavor in my tortilla soup. First of all I doubled the recipe, then I minced 6 jalapeños (no seeds) to the onion instead of using the green chiles. (Now I'm not one for HOT flavor at all but without the seeds, the jalapeños are just a nice bell pepper-type taste.) I saved the cilantro to be served on the top of the soup. I used 2 cans of corn, 1 can of black beans, 1 can of pintos and 1 can of sliced olives along with 3 cans of the tomatoes. I used two large cartons of chicken broth. Instead of using the hominy, I used 6 corn tortillas and minced them (in the Cuisinart) together with the seasonings, and then added the tortilla mixture to the tomato vegetable mixture to thicken it which worked very well. I sautéed the chicken separately and added it to the soup at the very end just before serving, so as to keep it soft and tender. I set out crunchy tortilla chips, grated cheddar cheese, sour cream, minced cilantro and chopped avocado to add to the top of the soup as it was ladled into the bowls. The soup turned out absolutely magnificent!

This was so easy and came out great.  I'm a midwestern girl, living out in West Texas.  I've been trying all different kinds of Tortilla Soup and this recipe is pretty authentic to what I get around here.  And it's shamefully easy to make.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the lack of seasoning recommended in the recipe.  I actually took the corn, frozen, and cooked it at the bottom of the saucepan, so it browned a little, added the garlic and onion, and then put in 1/4 cup of Chili powder, some oregano, cumin, coriander and cayenne pepper.  I used Mild Hatch Chilies.  The White Hominy was really good.  I hadn't used that before.  Everything was perfect, except if you like some seasoning without it burning off your tongue, you need to add a little more than was recommended.  Thank you for an easy and delicious dish!

Good flavor, made as is except without the hominy. More of a chili consistency, but that was ok. Would shred chicken next time.

I made my tortilla soup using a little bit of advice from several reviewers. I left out the hominy, water, chili powder and oregano. I added a packet of Lawry's taco seasoning, and sliced olives then swapped the water for broth. I used chicken breast from a rotisserie chicken I picked up at Costco. This is a quick meal to whip up but taste as if I spent the entire afternoon cooking. I forgot I used red kidney beans instead of black beans. This is definitely a keeper. The next time I make it I will add more broth or water because it was very thick.

This soup was fantastic, out of this world, we loved it. It was pretty spicey though so if you don't like that I would cut back on the chili powder to taste. Loved it!

This was my first attempt at making chicken tortilla soup and I chose this recipe after looking at several on the site, and was not disappointed. This is a great recipe!  I followed it exactly with a few minor changes based on other reviews: I used 40 oz of chicken broth, substituted cumin for the oregano, added the juice from half of a lime, I shredded the chicken instead of cutting it into pieces, and I omitted the black beans as a personal preference.  I let it simmer for about an hour as others had suggested and this seem to really set the flavors.  I also made my own tortilla strips using corn tortillas cut into strips and baked in the oven until crispy.  I used the toppings as called for in the recipe and it was just perfect.  I'll definitely make this again!

sooooo Good!  I make this quite often, this is a great base recipe.  Honestly, you can add so many things to your liking and it is great every time.  I don't think I have ever made it the same, haha.  It is my kids favorite meal and it is good for you too!! Thank you so much for sharing.

Very good! I used 2 cans of chicken broth and left out the water, used the whole 15 oz. can of hominy and added a packet of taco seasoning and left the rest the same. Will definitely make again!

Great recipe! Even my hard to please husband loved it. The recipe is a great base and easy to follow.  I added more chicken broth for a soupier consistency and squeezed some fresh lime to add more flavor.

Yes yes yes....so simple, easy and tasty! We cut the recipe in half for just the 2 of us and whoever goes to work earliest gets the leftovers :)
We used lots of fresh cilantro and left out the homny. Will definitely make again

My boyfriend and I LOVE this soup. I make it often,  especially when one of us has a cold. I use shredded chicken and cumin rather than oregano. Garnish with monterrey  jack, avocado, yellow corn chips, and fresh cilantro. The green onions do not fit with the flavor profile, so I don't use those. This is a must try recipe. You won't regret it.

I made this recipe for my husband when he was sick with a sore throat and head cold. He loved it, I added a few red pepper flakes when simmering and it had a nice kick, soothing on the throat but clears the sinuses. Very yummy will defiantly make it again.

Delicious recipe as is! I substituted shredded chicken however because that is what I had and I like shredded better. Perfect for a cool fall evening or winter night! Will definitely be making this again and again! Add a dollop of sour cream on top for perfection!

After reading reviews, I replaced water with chicken stock and added extra spice...still quite bland. Needs lots more salt and spices. Once added, and put all toppings on, very good.

darn good recipe, tried hominy for the first time that I know of, love it.  Who wouldn't want more corn tortilla flavor in their soup?  I pretty much followed JennnAnthomy's most helpful review instructions.  I dug the addition of the cumin. The avacado is an absolute must, don't skip that. You can cream this recipe up too by adding heavy cream, halfnhalf or even 2% milk.  Good stuff

So, at first I did follow the recipe exactly.  After the soup had finished simmering, I did a taste test and made some additions:  I added ground cumin, lime juice and 1 can of Rotel.  For me, this was GREAT!!!   The next day, I did have to add some extra chicken broth and tasted even better.
I used the recommended garnishes plus sour cream.  VERY GOOD!!!  I would highly recommend tasting before serving and add what you like.

The recipe is a good base recipe, and with a few changes the soup itself is worth 5 stars.  Like other reviewers, we added quite a bit more seasoning and used all broth (homemade) and no water.  We also omitted the hominy, using corn instead and used roasted Anaheims instead of canned.

SO GOOD!  I read a lot of the reviews and used some of the suggestions such as switching out the oregano for cumin and adding a bit of coriander.  I had a half a jar of salsa verde, and one can of Rotel .  I had diced tomatoes which I put in UN DRAINED.  I had about 1 cup of leftover  Chicken stock so I threw that in and made up the rest of the liquid with water.  I didn't feel the need for the chilies because I already had the salsa and Rotel.  I used  B/S chicken thighs and added them WHOLE with everything into my crockpot. 

 I didn't have any hominy. I just added an extra cup of frozen corn  with the black beans.  I used the amount of chili powder called for and I sautéed my onions and garlic before adding them in.   It cooked all day on low, took the chicken out, shredded it and returned it to the pot.  

DO NOT skip the part of putting in some crushed tortilla chips.   It really adds that authentic taste. 
  
This recipe is so forgiving!    I was able to use up things from my fridge, pantry, and freezer and it came out Muy Bueno! 
 
 INO, the crock pot allowed the flavors to meld and added to the finished dish.   The chicken shredded  perfectly.

DO USE the extras! Sour cream, shredded cheese, avocado, etc add to the authenticity.  I would put this up against a restaurant any day!  

Thank you, Star Pooley for such a great, FORGIVING recipe!

I found this soup to be very thick, I added about a cup more water than it calls for, and still didn't have as much broth as we would have liked. I would suggest to add somewhere around 2 cans, and then rinse out the cans and put the water from that in as well. I halved the recipe, but still used two chicken breasts, but that still came out to less than a pound of chicken. I was surprised how flavorful this was, while only having chili powder and oregano as seasonings. I also used slightly more green chilies that this calls for, I was supposed to use half the can and accidentally poured the whole thing in, I took out all I could of the "pure" peppers, but it was still slightly more. 
Thank you for a great recipe.

Tried this tonight and it was delicious.  I did not make any changes as I like to try a recipe as written for the first time even though some of the reviewer changes sounded good.  One thing I found at the grocery store was crushed tomatoes with Mexican seasoning which I may try the next time and I might also put in a jalapeno while it is cooking for a little more spice.  Would not be disappointed if I ordered tortilla soup at a restaurant and it tasted like this recipe.  Thank you for sharing.

I just wanted to say that I did everything except the corn, hominy, black beans, and green chilies. I also used a teaspoon of cumin, extra 1/4 cup chopped cilantro and chicken broth I obtained from boiling the chicken breasts. I also used pepper jack because of the lack of green chilies. It came out perfect, better than a restaurant. A dash of pepper too cause I am a Texan.

I made this recipe almost to the letter, i just left out the hominy.  My husband said, "you can make that chicken tortilla soup stuff agaun anytime you want." That means "keeper" in this house!  The avocado and cilantro topping is a must.  Gives it that little extra something.

I have to give this recipe at least three stars because I did follow some of the ingredients per all the other reviews I read on here. I did change the amount of chili powder to 4 tsp., I added the taco seasoning. I used great value; taste just like old el paso, I omitted the hominy beans, and oregano. I substituted the condensed chicken broth to 4 cups of chicken stock or broth. I added a capful of white cooking wine, added diced red and green pepper (as I've seen used in most chicken tort soup recipes), added the 2 tsp. of cumin and this soup was absolutely delicious. Topped with fresh cilantro, hint of lime juice, diced avocado, and sour cream. I also cut up some corn tortillas and fried my own strips. Outstanding!!

Great soup for a cold night, with some cornbread and apple crisp for dessert.  I did roasted cumin also rather than the oregano. Perfect fall meal!

This recipe is fabulous!  A few modifications....I sauteed the onion, garlic and corn (3 fresh corn on the cob kernels) for a few minutes, then I added 1/2 serrano pepper for spice, Instead of chicken broth, I added water and caldo de pollo seasoning and lots of pink himalayan salt, boiled 5 fresh roma tomatoes, peeled and cut, then added to the soup. I brined the chicken before adding to the soup for more flavor. (soaked in salty water for 3 hours before cooking). Cooked the chicken in a pan with onions. When the chicken was done cooking, I added the juices to the soup for flavor. Thickened up the broth by putting a cup of the liquid and dissolving 1-2 tbsp of flour and adding slowly to the soup.  Added a pinch of cumin and oregano. I let this simmer for a few hours before serving so the flavor would infuse throughout all the ingredients. Cooked 2 zucchinis in the pan that I cooked the chicken in then added them to the soup last so they wouldn't get too soft. Omitted the beans and cilantro. Next time I think I'll add some potatoes for more starchiness and a few more zucchinis. My favorite chicken soup recipe by far!

Terrific!!

Like most others I omitted the hominy only because this is not an ingredient I am familiar with since I live in the north east.

Also I do not like Cilantro like some other, to me it has a soapy taste. I also flavored it up a bit with cumin & hot sauce and of course a dollop of sour cream upon serving.
This recipe freezes great!

I liked it but I changed up a few things. We enjoy our soups thicker so I had a can of mixed veggies(yuck) that my Mom gave me when she cleaned out her cabinets. I pureed them in the blender with a cup of chicken broth and added it to the soup. It thicken it up and made it creamy with out the extra fat that sour cream would have added. I also added a cup of hot salsa in place of tomatoes. It was wonderful!

By far the best chicken tortilla soup I've ever had. The only thing I didn't use in this recipe was the condensed chicken broth. I boiled my own chicken with a bouillon cube and used that instead. My kids and husband wiped my pot clean. Delish!!

Great soup.  Used the ingredients as listed, only omitting the oregano and adding a can of rotel because I didn't have green chilies.  Only other changes I made were  I used a rotisserie chicken and added one chipotle pepper in adobo sauce because I didn't find it spicy enough.   I simmered for one hour as others suggested. Served with guacamole, cheese, sour cream and chips.  Delicious and very filling.

We make this soup quite often, especially in the winter. Its absolutely amazing, especially the next day. 
I try to use a whole chicken that I cook in broth, 2-3 garlic cloves & couple sprigs of cilantro. Then I strain the broth and use it for the soup. I found that using a whole chicken gives it a better flavor due to the dark meat and it being simmered for about 2 hrs in the broth. 
I double the recipe, but still only use 1 can of green chili peppers. I add 1-2 tbs lime juice to it. At times I have to add salt, although this is one recipe, that hardly needs any salt! I only use fresh cilantro and pull the leaves off the stems (I do not like the tough stems) and then gently chop them. 
Its simple and feeds quite a lot of people. I serve with shredded cheese and toasted tortillas that I cut into strips

We love this soup. We always make a double batch and it's usually gone within a few days. We have fine-tuned this recipe based on reviews by others and our own preferences, with the following adjustments:  
(1) if doubling, use a whole 2- to 3-pound rotisserie chicken picked clean (instead of chicken breasts); 
(2) skip the oregano, replace with equal amount of freshly ground cumin seed (lightly toast the seeds in a heavy skillet before grinding); 
(3) the recipe is on the thick side, so add up to 2x the chicken broth to achieve more of a soup consistency;
(4) after simmering, before serving, add 2T lime juice (4T if doubling).

I love the recipe. I used leftover chicken that was originally made for chicken tacos. Also I could not find hominy. Followed the recipe otherwise. Shared with my mother and she still raves about it. She usually tells me what I need to change when I use her recipes but this time she actually asked for mine. It's a keeper for me.

Love this recipe!   I first made it according to the recipe, but I have learned that we prefer to leave out the oregano and hominy, add a bit of cumin, Ro-tel, and carrots.  We prefer to load this soup up with the meat from two roasted chickens and scoop it onto some Tositos "Hint of Lime" chips.  Our favorite soup :)

This is a pretty good basic soup. Try it; you'll like it. And, as with most soups, you  can "improve" on it by tasting, then adding your own spice/ingredient preferences. However, if you are tentative about making soup, just go with the recipe as provided and eat it all up. Yum!

This soup is awesome- everyone loved it! The only changes I made were adding more chicken broth (with all the yummy garnishes it just seemed too thick) and adding jalapeno and hot sauce (the garnishes balanced out the "heat" very well). Thanks for sharing this recipe- I'm sure I will be making it regularly for many years to come.

Good starter recipe. I boiled the chicken and used the broth from the boiled Chicken instead of chicken stock. I added salt as well. There are a lot of ways you can make this soup to your liking. Thanks for the recipe. It's a good starting point for a quick and easy soup .

I have been making a double recipe of this, exactly as written, at least once a month for almost a year now.  My husband loves it, and the leftovers freeze great!!!  I freeze the leftovers in individual serving size containers, and he takes them for lunch to work almost every day.  He gets a little tired of it every 3-4 weeks, but then after only one week of different lunches he asks for it again!  Even with all my experience making this recipe, I have never felt a need to alter the recipe.  However, since chicken breasts are so much more expensive than whole chickens and since when the meat is in a soup even my white-meat-loving husband can't tell the difference, I use a whole chicken when doubling the recipe.  I make it easy by putting a 4-5 pound chicken in some water in the crockpot on low for about 6-8 hours (this also makes great broth for the soup!), then when the first ingredients are simmering I strain the fresh broth into the soup and I remove the bones and shred all the chicken to add to the soup.  This is easy to do after slow-cooking, even if you're clueless about how to take apart whole chickens, because it's falling off the bones and the pieces don't matter because you're using all the meat anyway.  Try this-- it's way cheaper than chicken breasts and the crockpot makes it easy.

The soup came out delicious.  The only adjustments I made were adding a teaspoon of cumin, per other reviewer recommendations.  I used red kidney beans instead of black beans and I omitted the hominy.  The flavor of the soup is outstanding, but what really makes great is the toppings.  Yum!  I love that it was quick and easy to make.  A great way to use some leftover chicken.  I definitely plan on holding onto this recipe to make again.

I would shred the chicken next time I make this, and I did also substitute the hominy for an extra cup of corn. Otherwise it was quite good.

Excellent dish, and a crowd pleaser. I fried tortilla strips to add to the top, and added two jalapenos to the soup to give it just the right amount of kick. Very popular at my dinner party.

I did mine in the crock pot - delicious. Sear the chicken before putting it in so it stays juicy. I also sautéed the onion before putting it in too. My only change to the recipe was a bouillon cube with 2 cups of water instead of the condensed chicken broth. It came out great!

Outstanding!  This is probably the most useful recipe I've found on this site.  We are not soup eaters at all, but this one is just so hearty.  There is no downside to this.  It is affordable, healthy, satisfying, easy to make, easily modified to personal preference, and keeps well for days on end.  This one may make soup lovers of us afterall!  Well done

My whole family LOVES this recipe. I add about 1/2 cup finely crushed tortilla chips and squeesed in some lime juice.  I'm not a big fan of hominy, so I substituted white corn. I cook my chicken all day in the slow cooker and used the broth instead of canned broth and water. I do end up using more broth to thin it out a little. This soup freezes great.  I double the batch and freeze several bags to pull out on our busy nights.

Totally awesome! Very easy to make. I had to make a couple changes because I was out of two things. No tomatoes--used 15 oz of tomato sauce instead. Also out of chili powder--used 1 tsp each of hot sauce and paprika instead. Can't wait to try it as written.

I love this, my husband loves it, and my kids love it! I use green chili (from here in south west Colorado) with only a quarter of the onion. I use more hominy and I put it all the items needing to be cooked in the crockpot on high for five hours if I'll be home. If not, I put it on low for nine hours. Love this during the winter!

This is by far one of the best recipes I have made!!! the flavor was so on point! My whole family loved it! They said I can make this anytime! what I loved about it was that it was simple...I made a double batch. the only thing I changed was I used chicken stock instead of broth for more added flavor and I just let it simmer longer for all the flavors to come together!!! I would recomend this to anyone!! ENJOY! P.S. there was nothing left!

I stumbled across this recipe when I was looking for a chicken dish. I love love love this recipe. I ended up omitting the hominy since I do not care for it. I already had roasted Hatch chillies on hand and opted to use my own rather than a can of chillies the recipe called for. I think the roasted Hatch chillies gave the recipe a little bit of a kick (which I enjoyed since I love spicy food). I would recommend this recipe to anyone. Extremely easy to make.

This is one of our favorite soups we eat regularly in the fall and winter. We are eating alot more vegetables and less meat so I omit the chicken and it still is great! Make it just as is, no changes.

Made some changes according to what I had at home and my family's liking but only in the spices department;the base was the same. I used the broth from the chicken I cooked, 2 tsp. taco seasoning mix instead of the chili powder,omitted the cilantro, used only half of the canned green chile peppers (mild) and did not use the green onions to serve it with. Had a little sour cream with the corn tortilla chips, the cheese and the avocado! My soup actually turned out a little thick at the end, more of a chili consistency, so I added about a cup more or so of water and seasoned to taste. Great recipe!!! Had to work till 5pm that day and needed something quick and delicious for the fam and this soup was just perfect for the cold wintery day!! Thanks!!

I made this soup because I had recently had tortilla soup at a high end well known restruant.  I made it according to the recipe and it was every bit as good as the tortilla soup I paid for in the resturant.  Yum!

I doubled the chilli powder and actually made it with left-over turkey we had in the fridge.  The entire family (none of which like soup but me) LOVED IT!

I made this recipe as is and didn't care much for it at all. It was lacking the right kind of flavor and had too much of a tomato taste to it. I've thought about what I'd change for the next go round, but I honestly can't put my finger on what it was missing.

THIS IS A WONDERFUL RECIPE! EVEN THOUGH MANY PEOPLE HAVE ALTERED SOME OF THE INGREDIENTS, PRAISES SHOULD BE GIVEN TO "STAR" FOR SUBMITTING IT!!! I ALSO SUBSTITUTED CUMIN FOR THE OREGANO, AND BOILED DOWN MY TURKEY SCRAPS (BONES AND SKIN THEN REMOVED) AND USED THIS BROTH WITH MY CHOPPED UP LEFTOVER TURKEY INSTEAD OF CANNED CHICKEN BROTH AND EXTRA WATER. YUMMY, YUMMY, YUMMY!! THANKS STAR!!

This soup was really delicious. I personally used fresh jalepenos (2) but it still wasnt spicy enough. Next time i would double up on the hot peppers, and add some extra chili powder plus cayenne pepper. Also, the chicken that i used in the soup i first baked in the oven tossed in tex mex spices. Yum !

I tried this recipe for a church soup dinner and it was fabulous.  It was rated one of the best soups there for the evening.  Easy to make and very flavorful, to spice it up a little I brought a bottle of hot sauce on the side if anyone wanted it spicy.  Thanks for posting the recipe!!

This was amazing. I used cumin instead of oregano and I shredded the chicken. With all the flavors, it was awesome. My boyfriend loved it, and it was a very healthy. I highly recommend this recipe.

Very good. Added more chicken and less tomato. I would recommend shredded chicken and definately let in simmer for more time to allow more flavoring.

Delish! They had fresh green chilies at Ralphs so I used fresh jalapenos and the larger Pasilla instead of canned. Just dig out the seeds and the inside if you don't like too much heat. Next time I will roast the chilies first and peel the skin to bring out more flavor.

Great soup! The cilantro makes this soups flavored stand out.  I am not a fan of avocado, so next time I will leave that along with green onion off my grocery list. This soup is great garnished with a little shredded cheese!

Delicious soup that is very filling and goes a long way. If you want more chicken, I suggest taking all the meat off of a rotisserie chicken and using that instead of just a few chicken breasts. I would definitely make this again!

I just HAD to comment on this soup. It is A.MA.ZING!!! I used Chipotle Chili Powder and cumin as suggested by others and it was spicy and DELICIOUS!!! My husband told me “I love you” after every bite of the first bowl :D My only complaint is that I only have one stomach to fill! Thank you for posting this and to all who left their great suggestions!

Yes I made it today and my family loved it!! I made it exactly the way they did in the video,I just boiled my chicken before with garlic salt and pepper. I added an extra can of chicken broth to make more soup. All I added was a little salt to taste but I would not change a thing and I will Make this again!!

OMG I made this with quite a few modifications because I didn't have some of the ingredients and it was still AMAZING! Even my husband who doesn't like "brothy, chunky" soups ate a good bowl of it. I can't wait to have more for lunch tomorrow!

I have been using this recipe for a few years.  Really love it just the way it is.  Sometimes substitute the black beans for pinto since I always have them on hand.  Turkey for chicken, what ever is in the fridge or freezer.  Broth or Better than Bullion.  Fresh for dry oregano, and dry for fresh cilantro, what ever you have on hand.  My favorite cheese is sharp, but use any tasty cheese you have.  Add some Jalapenos or hot New Mexico chile, wonderful contrast with sour cream or plain yogurt.  Or leave them out for those that do not like heat.  Fresh avacado makes for a coolness on top of the hot soup and shouldn't be skipped.   The chips add just enough salt and crunch.

It is such a beautiful dish with the different colors and so many possible substitutions.  It is one of our family favorites, guests rave about it, and coworkers ask for the recipe when they see my leftover lunch.

This soup was delicious! My three year daughter liked it too and she is quite a picky eater. I like foods with a lot of flavor and this soup didn't disappoint.
I followed the recommendations of other reviewers to add 2 tsp of cumin, omit the water and use a lot more chicken broth for soupier consistency. I also squeezed in a half of lime - for more flavor and extra tang. I added sour cream to garnish as well. You can't go wring with this one! Definitely a keeper!

I've made this recipe multiple times now and is always delicious.  It's easy to make and only modify it by omitting the black beans (only because my fiance does not like them, but I bet it would be even better with them!).  I didn't care to add green onions, but you can try it for yourself.  I definitely recommend this recipe- tastes just like the mexican restaurants here in AZ.

This recipe is probably my favorite thig I've ever made. If you like Mexican food, you will LOVE this. After reading the reviews, I used more chicken broth instead of water, and also cumin instead of oregano. I didn't use the avacodo or tortilla chips, but topped the soup with cheese and sour cream instead. Amazing! I could eat this everyday!

Made this for 64 persons - only change was instead of canned green chili peppers, I roasted my own Pablano Peppers in the broiler.  It was the hit of the banquet and I had some guests say it was the best Tortilla soup they have ever had.

OMG!  This soup was DELICIOUS!   We had just bought some avocados from a guy selling them out of his truck- seriously 10 for $5 bucks- (That's CA for ya!)  so I wanted to make some chicken tortilla soup and use them as a topper.  I've never made this soup before so I figured I'd give it a shot! 

 I modified it a bit-no oregano and added cumin instead and used canned chicken from Costco.  (my go-to chicken for everything when I have no fresh chicken breasts!)
 No hominy- I didn't have any- no water- just low sodium chicken broth, no green chiles and I added carrots and three tablespoons of sour cream into the soup.  Only had diced tomatoes preflavored with Oregano and Basil (yes Italian style- but it worked!)

I also added two chicken bouillon cubes and a pinch of cayenne pepper.  I used taco shells instead of tortilla chips and they worked just fine (I crushed them up) and string cheese.  YUM!  

So this is the use what's in your pantry version!  It was mouth watering!  Mmmmm....

Everyone LOVES this soup.  I have made a little revision to my version.  I take about 5 cups of water and 4 chicken boulon cubes and boil the chicken first for about 90 minutes.  Then I pull the chicken apart so its shredded rather than cubed and I subsitute the broth and water with the broth made from the boiled chicken.

Verry yummy!!! I didn't cook chicken first, I added it uncooked in the beginning. I also added more hominy, and 7oz green chiles instead of 4oz. A new favorite!!

This recipe is fantastic!! Made it on a rainy day and it hit the spot.  I added some things which only made it better...thinly sliced jalapenos(not seeded), mushrooms, bell peppers and garlic.  Put it in the crockpot for about 6 hours just so it got nice and hearty.

This is one of my favorite to make soups.  Hearty and easy.  Instead of adding monterey jack cheese, I like to toss in some mexian cheese and lime tortilla chips.  Super YUMMY!!

I have made this soup a few times and normally add or subtract to taste all my recipes.  I used one whole chicken and covered with water and boiled adding 2 bay leaves until done.  This makes great broth without all the salt added.  Debone and add chicken back to broth. I was making for a few people so I add a large container of chicken broth (36 oz) and about 2 tablespoons of chicken bouillon (no Msg). Added cumin instead of oregano and 4 tablespoons chili pwd. Used diced tomatoes, fresh jalepenos, 2 cans black beans drained,  I just used a full can of all in recipe instead of measuring.  I like this soup with thicker broth so I made a thickening paste with maza flour mixed with hot broth in bowl and then stirred into soup until right consistency.  Everyone loves this soup!

Loved this! I ended up using a bit more than what they said. I used 1 can each for everything, and I added kedney beans. I also added Cumin Spice and Cayenne pepper. 

So yummy!

This recipe is fantastic... the only thing that my husband complained about was it being too thick so I added more Juice to it.. The chicken I boiled and then shredded and I used the juice from the chicken for the broth and completely omitted the water to it.. I did add the oregano but it still lacked a little flavor to me so I added a  little cumin and that did the trick.. My husband is from Mexico and he gives it a five star..So it has to be a fantastic recipe and it was so SIMPLE!!! IT's leftovers for dinner tomorrow nite.. thanks so much for this recipe!!!

Very easy to make. I changed a few things. I added 1 cup of rice into the soup, a half small tub of sour cream into the soup to give it a creamy look, and I kept the avocado out of the recipe.  VERRYYYY yummy!

Awesome tortilla soup! I did have to figure a few things out on my own, though. I followed other reviews and used more chicken broth since I had no idea where to find "condensed" chicken broth... I did add about 1 can of water... I added enough liquid to suit my tastes (I like a soup-y soup). I used the hominy - delicious. This soup had a lot going on and was almost a "stew". I could almost scoop it up with tortilla chips! I used fresh cilantro and agree that everyone should NOT OMIT THE CILANTRO! It adds such a freshness to the soup. When I added the tomatoes and broth, I also added some frozen chopped chicken cubes and left them in the pot until serving. Yummy!!!

This recipe was delicious and exactly what I was looking for. I wanted more of a chicken both based soup as opposed to a tomato based soup.

I followed the suggestions made in the review below mine. Only thing I did differently - I live in China and couldn't find Cumin, so I used 1 1/2 teaspoons of Mexican chilli power (has cumin in it), and a dash of ground cayenne pepper. I couldn't find canned jalapenos or chillis, so I used a random spicy green pepper (no idea what type). First I put onions, garlic and green pepper with a little olive oil in the pan - threw in 3 chicken breasts, added the chicken broth, brought to a boil for 15 minutes.  Took cooked chicken out and shredded it, then added it back in with everything else.

Delicious. highly recommend!

Loved this soup!   Changed it up just a tad.  Instead of tomatoes -  Rotel
Instead of chicken broth - 1 large container spicy V8 (thins it a bit too!)
1 large can of tomato soup.  Yummy!

I've made this several times, and my family absolutely loves it, with no modifications necessary. For my DH, I also make a vegetarian version substituting veggie broth and garbanzo beans for the chicken. This is a quick, easy, delicious soup! Thanks, Star!

I rated this recipe a five bc I could nt figure out how to rate a 4 1/2... I only rated it personally as a 4 1/2 bc I made some changes... I boiled my chicken while I saute the whole onion whole green pepper whole orange pepper and I seasoned the peppers and onion with cumin and chicken de pollo ( I don't do exact messurments I just add until I think its enough then add just a little more) o and I added salt and pepper. The I took out the chicken and put it to the side and pulled it apart in chunks.. Then I got a new pan and added the can of crushed tomatoes added cumin and chicken de pollo again with salt and pepper and garlic salt and added 2 cans of the water I boiled the chicken with then added the onion and pepper mix, can of corn can of black beans... Then I added the cilantro.. then added the chicken a little more water from the chicken I cooked and the other can of tomatoes.. and just played with it from there.. I think that is all i did and MAN WAS IT WONDERFUL!!! Thanks for the recipe...

Super yummy and simple. I used pork just because that's what I had and it was great! I did add cumin and cinnamon, because I just can't imagine Mexican food without those two flavors. Oh and to those that omitted the oregano, it is very common to use oregano in traditional Mexican and other Latin American foods so don't leave it out! :)

My first time making chicken tortilla soup! I cheated... Here's what I did: I bought a whole roast chicken - I was lazy to marinate and cook the chicken breast Instead of the usual chili powder I used 2 packages of chili powder from Mama noodles - super spicy! I didnt measure my cilantro & oregano...  Turned out wonderful!!  Thanks for the recipe!!!!

This was great I doubled recipe & added more garlic @ 1 sqeezed lime, I also left out the hominy because we are in Austin TX & have never heard of it being made that way but both my girls & my husband ATE IT UP! I will keep this one & make it again & again.

Amazing!  But...I used 3 cans of chicken broth instead of water, canned corn, no hominy (even though I love it), light kidney beans instead of black (for no particular reason), and instead of chicken breast I used all the meat from a rotisserie chicken.  Yummy !

I made this tonight and it was VERY good!  I will definitely make it again.  I used the tips given in JENNANTHONY99's review from Jan. 12, 2004.  I live in San Antonio where Chicken Tortilla Soup is served everywhere and this recipe is equally as good as some of my favorite restaurants.  The only things I did differently were to use 4 chicken breast instead of 2 and I added drained & rinsed pinto beans and omitted the hominy.  Next time I might try adding some Mexican oregano just out of curiosity.

Absolutely loved this recipe!  I dont like beans, so I threw in some fresh spinach & zuchini.  To make it easier- I got 2 roasted chickens from the store instead of preparing the chicken myself.  I liked the rich flavor of the roasted chicken.  Only other change I made was to sneak in a bottle of Honey Brown Beer to the stock!  It was delicious!

so far i have only made this once but i read almost every review (like i always do) so i could get some hints to make this great. i added cumin but still kept the oregano (i didnt think it was too much). didnt add hominy but i will next time just to see what it adds since i love it. i added a couple more cups of chicken broth because i like my soup thinner. i didnt add crushed tortilla chips because that would have just made the soup thick but served the baked Tositos Scoops instead of using a spoon. it was GREAT! i chopped up some jalepenos to garnish along with adding sour cream, lime wedges and more cilantro. i may have changed a lot but this was an amazing soup. i looove All Recipes!!!

Definitely a good, hearty soup.  i substituted the oregano for cumin as suggested and more chicken broth instead of water. I feel it could use more flavor still but i'm not sure what!  Only topped it with cheese because that's all I had on hand.  Still good.   Would make again and try to make it a little more interesting!

So good!  Easy to make even with the long list of ingredients.  I made a huge pot and it disappeared fast.  Make sure to put the shred cheese on top - it is a great touch!  As good as it is the first day it is even better the next day - if you manage to have any left!

I made this recipe as written. We have 6 children and while they're not at all picky eaters, it is difficult to find a recipe they all LOVE. This one was a hit! Will use it often on chilly autumn or cold snowy days. I've been looking for a good chicken tortilla soup for awhile. After  trying several recipes we found one!! Thanks for the recipe.

This was very very good.  I will definitely make this again.  It was quick and easy to make, and very tasty.  I made this for 40 people, and most everybody liked it.  Some people thought it was too tomato-ey, so if you're not crazy about tomatoes, maybe this isn't the soup for you.  (the base of the soup is mostly tomatoes) However, my husband doesn't like tomatoes at all, and really liked this soup.  I made a few changes - cumin, instead of oregano (a must), and I ommited the black beans, as I do not like them. I bought some corn tortillas, and cut them into strips, sprayed them with cooking spray and baked them in the oven at 350 for about 10-12 minutes, and put them on top of the soup, along with sour cream and mexican cheese.  Fantastic!  I served this dish with mini cheese quesadillas, and mexican rice.  Definitely a keeper!

this soup was what i was looking for! i did take some suggestions of others and made a few changes. i eliminated the oregano  and added cumin. I also eliminated the hominy as i dont like it. i added two cans of regular chicken broth and one can of water.  i also did two cans of chilies as we like things a little spicy.  i let it simmer for an hour to let the flavors come together better.  also instead of crushed chips, i cut corn tortillas into strips and broil them in the oven until they are golden brown and crunchy. The cilantro in this soup gives it so much flavor. i will definitely be making this soup again!

This soup is awesome and easy to make. I used leftover rotisserie chicken and instead of the chili powder I substituted 1 chipotle pepper w/1tsp of the adobe sauce. This provided a little extra kick and a lite smokey flavor. I am so full right now as I had seconds okay maybe thirds!  :)  Enjoy.

This was excellent! I added more broth than the recipe called for, the tortilla soup I'm used to is not that thick. I left out the hominy because I didn't have any, but the soup didn't seem to be missing anything. Also I used some salsa verde instead of green chilis because I was out of those too. I'll be making this again soon!

To die for tasty!  The hominy makes this soup so don't skip it.  Took me less than half an hour to make and i just added the chicken in with the onion to brown, then simmer to cook.  Yum!

I have also taken the suggestions of others...I use mexican style diced tomatoes instead of crushed...cumin definitely not oregano, even though oregano is most definitely a spice used in many different mexican & cuban dishes. I also include fresh cilantro in the soup...and serve with homemade corn tortilla strips.

Tastes like tomato sauce after more than 90 minutes cooking. This tastes nothing like Chili's Restaurant Tortilla soup. I followed recipe exactly and it tastes like Tomatoes. Ugh!

This wasn't was i was actually looking for, for it is very very good.  More chunky and heaty, almost like a chili.  But very good.

I didn't use pre-cooked chicken (there's no need to, it cooks quickly). Used only a sprinkle of oregano and added raw jalepeno with the onions and garlic. It had quite a kick!

SO good!  I could not give it 5 stars because I did alter a few things but this recipe was such a great base recipe.  I omitted the hominy and the cilantro (my husband hates cilantro).  I also used cumin instead of oregano.  It was really good. I served it with mexican cornbtread muffins shredded mexican-style cheese, and sour cream.  We didn't even need tortilla chips :)

Very good!  I added about 2 teaspoons of cumin and a little poultry seasoning and pepper and extra chili powder.  Very very good stuff.

This recipe is Delicious!! With a family of 6 it is hard to find a recipe that everybody loves. Well, everybody loved this one. They couldn't wait for dinner, they kept eating spoonfuls out of the pot. It was an extremely easy and quick recipe to make. I did add a bit more garlic, an extra tsp of chili powder, a 7 oz can of green chili peppers instead of 4 oz, more cilantro, and my own homemade chicken broth. I used 4-5 cups of broth because we like more broth. It was perfect. Bottom line - Easy and Delicious!!!!!

I was skeptical.  I didn't think it would taste as good as resturants, but it did. I added sliced carrots and increased the water & broth to 2 cups.  Omitted the green chiles & hominy because i didnt have any and it still tasted great.'i also did add 2 sliced tortillas into the soup since it is tortilla soup.  Instead of tortilla chips on top, i just crushed up the TOSTADAS i already had.

This was delicious!  I used the whole can of hominy and corn.  I added some extra chicken broth as well and some extra fresh cilantro.  I also added the cumin and just a dash of oregano.  Topped it off with all of the suggested toppings.  I made it last weekend and will make it again this weekend it was so good!

This was wonderful.  My husband is a big Tortilla Soup fan and he loved it!  I couldn't find a can of the green chili peppers but found a small can of diced tomatoes with green chili peppers in it and it added just enough bite (I'm a pretty big baby with hot stuff) to make it good.  Can't wait to have the leftovers!

I have made this soup a few times and I've finally got it nailed. I buy a rotisserie chicken and shred the breast meat. YUMMY. The meat is so much more flavorful. I use 3.5 cups of chicken stock and 1 cup of water. I use 1 tsp of cumin in addition to the chili powder and oregano. The magic ingredient is a jalapeno pepper, chopped, seeds and all. Adds just the right amount of kick. DELISH!!

Delicious!  I skipped the hominy, used 1/2 an onion, 28oz diced tomatoes with green chilies, and added a small block of velveeta (chopped and added along with the beans and stuff).  Next time I will try this in the slow cooker.

This soup was lovely! I tweaked a couple things. I only added 1tsp of chili powder because i don't like super spicey, and then i used a can of crushed tomatos mixed with green chili's for speeds sake. I also used white beans instead of black.  Next time I will simmer for an hour like others have recomended and add more chicken broth, no water. So probably 3 or thre 14.5 ounce cans.

Made it tonight, we found it very good. Left out the hominy since all I could find was a big can, it'd all go to waste so I skipped that. Forgot the green onions so instead we just had sour cream, cheese and avocado on top. If you like thick hearty, stick with the directions here.

I made this last night for our family. I have had tortilla soups before and I tend to like it very thick.So what I did was chop up 5 corn tortillas very small and added it to the soup as it was cooking and then added 1 extra can of chicken broth, I also let it cook for about 1 hour more than suggested. It was wonderful! So full of flavor and my kids ate it! Will definately make again...might also consider this something to make for guests.

I scaled this recipe up to make enough for a soup swap.  It scaled up nicely - a good sign of a nicely balanced recipe.  I did use diced tomatoes instead of crushed and kept the liquid from them as well and used non-condensed broth. In the end I didn't add in any water and the soup is very flavourful.  I used only corn as hominy is not available in my area, but I think if I did have hominy I would use 1/2 the amounts of both or it would be overwhelmingly corny.  I also used shredded rotisserie chicken meat, both white and dark meat instead of just chicken breast - fast and more flavour with the dark meat.  Good recipe.

MONTHLY DINNER..at least twice! this is my family's favorite soup recipe. we cheat and use tortilla chips sometimes as well as swap out monterey jack cheese for mozarella. don't be intimidated by the long list of ingredients...everything practically gets dumped from a can into the pot! it's so easy yet so flavorful and wholesome!

My daughter got this recipe here and made the dinner for me and my husband while I was recovering from a surgery.  My husband normally does not like tomato-based soup, but he had two bowls of this soup that night.  It was quite delicious.

Very good soup.  I like to make it for the Super Bowl and keep in a crock pot and any left overs I freeze for future lunches!  I use 2 cans of corn (or frozen) rather than hominy and diced tomatoes rather than crushed.  The cilantro makes it taste so fresh.  I also grill the chicken and shred it rather than cut up.

Made this for super bowl and got nothing but raves.  It was easy and delicious but I didn't add the homony so I could freeze it.

Great tortilla soup!  Just like the mexican restaurants!  I made this for my boyfriend and he couldn't stop eating it!  Like a few suggestions before... i also added 4 cans of broth (roughly 50 oz) and 14 oz H2O and it worked PERFECTLY!

5 STARS! Love this. For some reason this came out a bit too-soupy for me, so I just ladled this over brown rice. Then I added a dollop of sour cream, some red onions, some fresh cilantro and a tortilla chip or two:) WE love this.
We also use Rotel HOT tomoatos. We love ht heat. 
Try this, you won't be disappointed!

Very nice flavor to this soup.  I've made once with fresh cilantro and once with dried.  Much better with fresh.  I also shred the chicken which I think makes a better texture to the soup.  And I use an extra can of corn in place of hominy.

This was really good.  I did make some changes out of necessity.  I didn't have any black beans so I used some chile beans undrained.  Out of corn so I used a small can of mexicorn.  I also added an extra can of broth and added a can of diced tomatoes.  Because of the spiciness of the chile beans I reduced the amount of chile powder to about a teaspoon.

Awesome..did as other suggested..used 3 cans of broth, omitted the water, used cumin instead of the oregano, and mexicorn instead of hominy.  Used fresh chilis and a whole can of corn semi-drained.  only gave it 4 stars because of the changes but its amazing, i'm having the leftovers for lunch now!

Delicious, but I made several changes based on the recommendations of others.  Used 3 cans of chicken broth but eliminated the water.  Substituted cumin for oregano.  Left out the hominy.  And simmered for an hour to let the flavors blend together better.  The result was fantastic, especially when topped with sour cream and diced green onion.  The only change I'd make?  Add more corn - a cup didn't go very far, with the extra broth.

Loved this soup!! I tweeked just a bit based on other reviews.  I added more garlic (4 cloves), omitted the water and only used chicken broth.  I added 1 tsp of cumin along with the oregano and the chili powder.

I love soup, and this is great!  I made two minor changes; I partially cooked the chicken with the onion and garlic and let it simmer with the broth for a bit longer.  Also, I used a 15 oz can of crushed tomatoes and a jar of homemade salsa for the balance.  Very hearty and the kids loved it.

This soup was very good.  I did make minor adjustments like chicken broth for the water and cumin for the oregano like others suggested but other than that I followed the recipe to a T.  It was very filling and only 2 WW points per cup.

I'd give this a 4.5 if I could. I followed the advice of several reviewers to add more broth, which I definitely recommend. I kept a big measuring cup full of my bouillon mix next to the skillet, and added as it cooked down. Came out very tasty, and the toppings definitely make the dish! 

Thanks for sharing this easy and filling recipe!

I was really looking forward to making this recipe, but was disappointed.  I didn't feel like it had any flavor, even though I added additional seasonings.  It was easy, but I won't make again.  Thanks anyway!

I LOVE this recipe. My boyfriend tells me all the time this is the thing he craves the most (I told him today I was feeling under the weather and making soup and he perked up instantly!) I add cumin and a little hot sauce and only added a little chiles, this is the first time i attempted to use canned chiles and they wern't that great. I mix this recipe up every time (ive made it at least 5 times) I use it and it tastes great no matter what!

I use homemade chicken broth and omit the water. I use pinto beans insteaed of black and omit the hominy. I add the green onion at the end while the soup is still simmering. Lots of changes, but a delicious soup thta can be adapted endless ways.

AWESOME! The only change I made was to omit Hominy -- did not have any on hand. I topped my bowl of soup with sliced avocado and a dollop of sour cream. I also added a bit of lime juice and cumin to the pot of soup while it was simmering. Will definitely make again.

Loved it and it's now a favorite.  I did leave out the hominy, though.  Didn't have it on hand.  I freeze the leftovers, but it doesn't take too long before I'm thawing them out for more soup.

This was an excellent soup! My husband detests black beans so I used kidney beans instead. It was delicious! This is a great way to use the tortilla chips at the bottom of the bag! We will definitely make this again.

Delicious & very flexible! Changes: I used an extra oven roasted chicken that I made (My  mom told me to always do 2), used white beans only (canelli & butter) & 2 cans of chili - ready diced tomatoes.  Also no hominy, it had too much sodium.

Yum, this recipe was wonderful. I cooked the chicken with the onions and garlic. Instead of a 28 oz can of tomatoes, I used a 16 oz jar of mild salsa. Then I added a can of Rotel with green chilis. I used 4 cups of chicken broth, no water. This added plenty of liquid for the soup. And I used cummin instead of oregano.  The rest of the receipe I left the same. I let it simmer on the stove for about 30 minutes. I think the simmering is key here, so the flavors can meld together. Served it with tortilla chips, advocados and cheese. Good eating. This is going in the keeper file.

This soup was magnificent!  I followed the recipe exactly and WOW!!!  The only thing I changed was that I doubled the water and broth - but it was excellent!  This will definetly go into rotation, and I have already printed and given this recipe to 3 people!  WELL DONE!

I followed the recipe exactly except for subbing cumin for the oregano and doubling the chicken broth.  It was so so so so good!

This recipe is great.  I left out the hominy (and did not substitute) and used cumin instead of oregano as others suggested.  Delicious.

Amazing! I love LOVE this soup. It's even better the next day as leftovers-that's saying something! Like other reviewers, I leave out the hominy-no reason, other than this is usually a recipe I make on a whim, and I don't have hominy laying around the house. If I'm in a huge rush, I just pick up a roasted chicken from the store and shred that. Serve with cornbread-HEAVEN!It's seriously one of my favorite meals.

This was really good. I liked the herbs as listed in the original recipe (it didn't taste Italian because of the oregano). I used extra corn rather than hominy, but otherwise the recipe is great as listed!

Not great.  There wasn't much flavor.  It seems like it needs more of a tomato flavored base.  We didn't like the hominy in it, either.  I won't make it again.

I made this for my boyfriend and he loved it!!!  I didn't add the corn, hominy, or the beans because he didn't want any of that and I used 3 pieces of chicken instead of 2.  He did say it could have been a little more soupier.  I used 2 cans of broth so next time I'll probably use 3.  The recipe doesn't say how to cook the chicken so I boiled mine and then shredded it.  When I asked him how it was, he told me it was better than what you get in the restaurants!

Followed the recipe as written and my husband loved it. It's very spicy, just as you would suspect from the list of ingredients, so my 10 and 11 year olds did not like it very much. Mine came out more as a gumbo than as a soup, but very good just the same. It was actually better the next day too! Thanks for sharing.

I made this for a large group of people for a volunteer dinner (second time I had made it).  Everyone loved it.  One lady asked to take the leftovers so she could freeze it and wouldn't have to cook for a week!  The only changes I made were to use a rotiserrie chicken to save time on cooking, I omitted the hominy, and I added frozen corn.  Also, when serving this, make sure to toast some corn tortilla strips in the oven.  This was also the first recipe I used to impress my boyfriend :)

This soup was good, but did not bring the raving reviews that I had hoped for.  I followed the recipe as it was written, adding additional simmering time to allow the flavors to meld.  I thought that it was missing a little something, so added 1/2 teaspoon of cumin.  With all of the ingredients mixed in, there was very little liquid in the soup.  After serving a few portions, I went ahead and added another can of chicken broth.  The soup tasted better the second day, but still not 5 stars.

My husband doesn't usually RAVE about soup but he did with this so it gets 5 stars.  We don't like hominy so I didn't use it and he added sliced jalapeno to make it hot. Made as directed and it's really good but it's even better the next day.

This way really good, fast, and easy.  Like other reviewers, I used cumin instead of oregano and only half an onion.  I also used 2 cans of stock instead of condensed and water.  I left out the hominy and used two cans of black beans.  It was really good and filling.

This was GREAT! I made it just like the recipe but was out of oregano and didn't add as much chili powder because I was cooking for lots of kids. We also squeezed some lime juice in our individual bowls. We all loved it! Thanks!

This recipe gets a five for taste.  I added cumin, paprika, and coriander  (kept the oregano).  I simmered the tomatoes, chicken stock beans, chicken, onions, garlic, chilies, and spices for one hour.  At the last minute, I added fresh corn off the cob, but omitted the hominey. Garnished with shredded cheese.  Next time (yes there will be a next time) I think I'll add tortillas, since it is tortilla soup. Thanks for the delicious recipe.

Excellent recipe.  My kids liked it (even the one that doesn't care for Mexican food) and asked for seconds.  A mistake I made is that I didn't have crushed tomatoes on hand and so I used a can of diced tomatoes.  Next time I'll make sure I have crushed tomatoes.  My husband really liked the oregano but I think I'll try using cumin next time like others have suggested.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

This turned out great! I made the recipe exactly as written except for the cilantro. I didn't have it on hand, but I will definitely add it next time. I will also add more chick en and pull it rather than cube it for a meatier texture for the soup. Contrary to what other people said, I enjoyed that it was more soupy. Once you added the tortilla chips to the top, they soaked up the juices. I also added a spoonfull of sourcream before serving. Yum!

Hubby LOVES this soup. I add a chopped hot pepper when sauteeing the onion and garlic. Adds some kick. Freezes well (without garnishes, of course).

One of best soup recipes I've found here!  I only changed a few things though- used a can of Cream of Chicken with Herbs + 1 can of water instead of chicken broth so it would be a little creamier. Also, I used a can of chili beans instead of just adding the chili powder, a can of Rotel instead of the can of chilies.  Last, I added way more cilantro than suggested- probably a cup or more. This one goes great with a piece of sweet corn bread.

This was quite simple and tasty.  My husband wasn't a big fan at first, but was a convert trying it the next day.  Way better after sitting and reheating, next time I'll make it the day before I serve it.

I served this soup at a recent dinner party and it was a hit! I substituted a can of corn for the hominy and added a can of white beans as well. I served cheese and sour cream on the side. Thanks for a great recipe. I will definitely make again and again!

Holy guacamole! What a winner.  I used the leftovers from a roast chicken, and it was perfect.  Couldn't find hominy in that size (only the gigantic cans!), so I just increased the amount of corn.  Served mine with sliced avocado and lime-flavored tortilla chips.  Other than that, I followed the recipe perfectly and couldn't have loved it more.  Is sure to become a staple during weeks when we have roast chicken!

This soup was good, but it didn't live up to my expectations. It did have nice flavor, and I serve it with chips, sour cream, avocado, and cilantro. I's make Taco Soup II over this anyday.

I roasted my own chicken and made broth. Added @4 cups of water with the broth and a few boullion cubes as well. I upped the spice quantities accordingly. I also ended up sprinkling in 1/2  pack of taco seasoning mix. I used fire roasted corn from Trader Joe's and the whole can of hominy. Definitely use fresh cilantro. My only advice to let it all simmer on low for 30 minutes BEFORE you add chicken and cilantro. Everyone loved this and asked for the recipe.

Excellent soup that the whole family likes.  I also used cumin instead of oregano, and substituted tomato sauce for crushed.  I thought it was too thick, so I used 28 ounces of water instead of 1 1/2 cups.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a really quick and easy recipe. I boiled the chicken in water and used the broth in replacement for 1 1/4 cups of water in addition to using regular chicken broth. Other than that, I followed the recipe as is and it turned out great. It even tastes great after freezing. Yummy! Thank you Star for sharing the recipe.

Excellent tortilla soup but was a little spicy for some in my family. A lot of ingredients but well worth the effort. If you like spicy this is great. I took some out seperate for me and added some chopped habanero peppers for that extra kick.

Delicious!  I did omit the hominy, only because I didn't have any.  I also couldn't find condensed chicken stock, so I used a whole can (approx 2c)of chicken broth.  It was wonderful!  I will definately make this again.  Thank you!

Great for a very windy winter day.  I substituted chicken broth for H2O as several people suggested (and I accidentally used a can of tomatos that was seasoned with italian herbs) and it turned out great. I seasoned the chicken with sea salt and ground pepper, then grilled it on the gas grill to add a little more flavor.    The avocado, cheese, and crumbled tortilla chips on top are a must. I'll definitely be making this again.

This soup is delicious! I've made it several times and I leave out the cilantro, just because I don't like it. Everything works perfectly together, and it is one of the easiest soups to make. Great for an easy weeknight dinner and with only 3 of us there's plenty left over for lunch the next day.

I loved this!  It was fairly easy, very flavorful, and definitely hearty.  Like another reviewer, I skipped the hominy and increased the corn accordingly...I almost doubled the amount of black beans, and used chopped pickled jalapenos instead of green chile peppers (all I could find!).  Don't skimp on the chips and cheese!  My boyfriend and I ate waaaay too much of this. :)  Yummy!

This was okay, but a little bland. I added some cumin and salt and extra chili powder, which helped a little. In all fairness, I didn't have green chiles, which is why I gave this a 4 instead of 3. I did use the hominy, which I found in the canned veggie aisle, right near the corn. It has a chewier texture than corn, and did sort of taste like a corn tortilla! It was a nice, hot, quick meal on a busy night, just not anything we raved about. I probably would just make chili instead next time I'm craving something like this.

Great recipe! Simple to make and not a lot of preparation. I did end up adding extra garlic, chili powder, and a bit of cumin just for a little extra flavor (it's just a bit on the bland side without). The avocados didn't add much to it so I'll probably leave those out next time. I did add some fried tortilla strips as a garnish that was much better.

This soup was good.  For some reason I just felt like it needed a can of med enchilada sauce.  That added a bit more spice to the soup.  For those of you who can't find hominy...look in the Mexican food section of your grocery store.  However, I don't think the hominy was all that prevalent in the soup.  You can leave it out and not miss it.  Well, unless you love hominy.

This is a VERY good tasting recipe, my husband and I really enjoyed.  I only made a few alterations. The changes I made – I added 2 cups of frozen roasted corn instead of 1 cup of corn and 1 cup of hominy. I did not use condensed broth, but used the broth you can buy in a box, and I added the whole thing, which is about 4 cups (I prefer the boxed and we like more broth in our soups). Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This recipe was tasty and had a lot of flavour although I did have a lot of trouble finding horminy and canned green chilli peppers so I left them out.  I did find hominy styled corn which was just bigger kernels of corn (didn't really like this style of corn) and I used jalepenos instead of chilli peppers.  I didn't find it as think as everyone else reviewed but perhaps this is due to the lack of horminy.  I will make it again once I find these other ingredients.  There is only so much time you can spend in a grocery store and the grocery clerk were all baffled too. =)

This recipe was delicious and very easy to make. I sauted the chicken breasts in the bottom of the soup pot then removed to cook the soup that way all the good fond was at the bottom and deglazed with the stock. I also used chicken stock instead of the broth and water and used about 2 cups extra. I added some chopped jalepenos for extra kick.I always add extra seasoning too, I added cumin and cayenne pepper to this one. Topped with a dollop of sour cream instead of the avacado. I will definitly make this again!!

OKAY, WENT AHEAD & MADE THIS WITHOUT THE HOMINY, THIS SOUP HAD A FANTASTIC TASTE AND ADDING THE TOPPINGS OF SOUR CREAM, THE CRUSHED TORTILLAS, SCALLIONS, AND AVOCADO MADE IT EVEN BETTER. I DIDN'T CHANGE ANYTHING ELSE EXCEPT MINUS THE HOMINY. YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS SOUP!!!!

This was such a flavorful soup!! I added more cilantro, used cumin instead of oregano and topped with quacamole. My whole family loved this! Thanks for this one!!

I give this recipe four stars It was good but not excellent, get second servings good. My husband loved it though. It was a tad bit too tomato-ey for my tastes. Perhaps it will be better on the second day.

This was fabulous.  Very easy and tasty.  My 2 and 4 years olds ate it up!  I also used only chicken broth (no water), only hominy (no corn), and my husband hates cilantro, so we used parsley.  We only had cheddar cheese, and it worked well.  This may become a regular at our house!

My only major change was to add a lot more cilantro because we love it!  Some of the best soup I have ever had, and my husband declares it his new favorite (in a tie with Cha Cha's Chicken & White Bean Chili!)

This makes fabulous soup, which is surprising to me, because I don't usually enjoy recipes that involve that many canned foods.  But it's good!  Thanks for a great recipe! Note: I have never tried it with the hominy.

Very good but it's a tad heavy on the cilantro.  Just a personal preference.  We also added a small dollop of sour cream.  I didn't have any tortilla chips, which didn't deter from the taste.  I served it with corn bread.

Superb! I, too, used chicken broth instead of water, and I also added a splash of fresh lime juice. I didn't have an avocoado, but it really didn't make any difference. Next time I make it, I'm going to double the recipe, and freeze individual portions. This will be wonderful in the coming Winter months. Thanks so much, Star!

I love this recipe.  I've made it several times. Each time I experiment with it a bit.  I've used cumin instead of chili powder and I've left out the peppers and the cilantro.  It always turns out delicious. I also don't drain and rinse the black beans.

This was superb. Super easy and very filling. I served it with a salad and corn bread and we were both stuffed. The only changes I made were, like most people, used 2 cans of broth in place of the water (next time I will use low sodium broth as it was pretty salty), cumin in place of oregano, dried cilantro since my grocer didn't have fresh, and some hot sauce and lime juice added.  Deelicious!  We put sour cream and chips on top.  The best compliment was when I told my boyfriend that it would probably be better the next night after the flavors blend together, and he said he didn't think it could get any better...it was perfect already!  Pretty high praise. Will definitely make again

Yum! Although I did make changes (who doesn't it seems). I wanted chicken noodle soup, but they all looked boring to me. So I started with this recipe and then instead of corn and beans I added cooked egg noodles. A keeper!

Very delicious recipe! I did make some slight changes: used 2 cups of chicken broth, 1 C of water, sauted green peppers w/the onion and garlic, and left out the hominy. I also took another users advise and only used 1/2 of the can of tomatoes. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great recipe.  Modified as follows: used all chix broth in place of water, used 1 can of Rotel and 1 fresh chopped tomato in place of canned crushed tomatoes, added cumin as others suggested and fresh rather than dried oregano cause I had some; added a little lime juice; left out hominy.  Also made my own tortilla strips from corn tortillas (brushed four with olive oil, sprinkled with salt and pepper, sliced into strips and baked in 400 oven for about 15 mins.)  Served with corn bread.  Would have given 5 stars, but original recipe needed some "heat."

Very good, but too tomatoe-y even thought I added slightly more chicken broth and water.  I cooked the soup for way longer but waited until the end to add the chicken and the beans.  I also added extra corn and other assorted veggies.

My family loved this. My husband liked his with all the toppings plus a dollop of sour cream. I liked extra freshly fried corn tortilla strips, green onions and avocado. Company worthy for sure.

This recipe is absolutely perfect. You do not need to add or change a thing. Everyone I've served it to raves about it; it's really that good.

Very hearty and tastes homemade vs. the typical taste of "canned". Needs very little accompany soup also--warm tortilla's best. Just used a little cheese to put into soup.

I make this as often as I can.  The only thing I change is I put the hominy in a processor to change the consistency.  Yummy!  Thank You Star Pooley

This was great. I followed some advice from others and added some different spices to add more flavor. Didn't put in the huminey. My husband loved it and I will make it again.

Awesome with my tweaking, otherwise a little bland. Chili pepper got away from me so no idea how much actually went in there (lots). Used petite diced tomatoes. Added dashes of salt, pepper, garlic powder, cumin and red pepper. Omitted the hominy. Used dried cilantro. Yea, we like it spicy. This was delicious and hit the spot on this rainy winter day. Yum!

I have been searching for the perfect tortilla soup recipe, and I finally found it! I left the hominy out; just fine that way. Adults and kids as young as 6 loved it and it was quick, easy and inexpensive to make. I served it with crushed tortilla chips and a side of corn bread; the perfect compliment. You won't be disappointed in this one... promise!

Absolutely delicious!! I marinated my chicken breasts in a southwestern marinade mix for about an hour then sauteed and shredded them before adding to the soup. The soup was filling and flavorful--my husband gave it 5 stars and asked me to fix it again soon. Try it, it's a keeper!

This is the BEST Tortilla soup I've ever tasted or made.  It's easy to prepare but tastes like you spent all day in the kitchen.  I added extra spice when I heated up my chicken with some red pepper flakes and a small amount of finely chopped jalepeno.  YUMMY!

Awesome. this is my family's favorite soup recipe this winter. I won a chili cookoff with this recipe. If you freeze fresh corn, it's great in this recipe. My 10 year old thinks this is great too. Healthy and hearty.

I would say the soup is average. It's better than canned soup, but there just isn't anything that makes it stand out. Cheese is almost necessary to make it flavorful. The hominy doesn't add much to the recipe and next time I would leave it out since low sodium hominy isn't widely available and the point of making my own soup is to avoid the sodium. I would add more corn and more black beans to replace the volume lost by omitting the hominy. However, I will only make this soup again if my boyfriend really wants it. The vegan black bean soup is a much better choice for a similarly spicy soup.

I followed this recipe to a T (as well as read almost all of the previous reviews.)  I was a little disappointed. I used all of the stated ingredients including the hominy.I felt that the soup was too tomatoey. I will continue on my quest for the perfect chicken tortilla soup.  My husband thought that the soup was very good, but not excellent. On the plus side, this was a very easy/quick recipe to make.

I made this recipe today for my family to eat for dinner tonight. My son's friend came by and wanted to stay for dinner after a small taste. He told his mother(our neighbor)and I ended up sending soup over to his mother. My parents stopped by this evening and wanted a taste. IT WAS A HIT ALL THE WAY AROUND. My mom wants me to make it and bring it over for the Saturday Night Dinner she will be hosting this weekend!

Excellent soup, very easy and fast to make.  I added a little Frank's Red Hot sauce to spice it up a bit more, and added an extra can of chicken broth to make it a little less tomato-y.

I have made this twice.  The first time I omitted the chiles.  The second time I really spiced it up as I was feeding as part of a Mexican-inspired dinner.  Ended up really spicy, but SOOO tasty!

Yum!  This was so easy and so good.  I skipped the hominy and added a can of Rotel (original) to give it a kick.  Our favorite toppings are crushed blue tortilla chips and chopped avocados.

I just realized I have never reviewed this...I have made it many times, and I can't say enough good things about this recipe.  My husband and children hate spice, so I leave out the chili powder and peppers, and I also don't use the hominy, only because I forgot to buy it the first time.  I was worried the cilantro would be a little too "exotic" for my basics-loving crowd, but this got RAVE reviews.  This soup with cornbread and a salad is one of our top 5 favorite dinners.  I have served this to a variety of people, and haven't run into one single person who hasn't loved it.  It satisfies grilled-cheese-on-white-bread lovers, as well as the pan-seared-tuna-with-mango-chutney crowd.  It makes for a quiet meal because everyone (including my toddlers) are so busy inhaling it that they forget to talk.  THANK YOU STAR!

Tasty, easy and very filling. Makes a great main course. I omitted the hominy, doubled the garlic and used more broth and less water. With a little hot sauce and crushed red pepper it turned out perfect.

Easy, Easy! The addition of the cream of chicken soup makes it perfect. I substituted one can of Rotel and one of diced tomatoes in place of the can of green-chilis and the can of crushed tomatoes. And as others I omited the hominy. Topped with shredded cheese and a spoon of Sour cream. We enjoyed it and I will make it a family regular.

Wonderful recipe! My whole family loved it. We ate leftovers for three days! I will definitely make this again. Don't forget cheese and tortills chips to top it off. Thanks for the recipe.

This was AWESOME!  I liked that the soup was loaded with ingredients so that it was more filling for my husband.  I used two cans of broth (not condensed) and one can of cream of chicken soup. I will use diced tomatoes next time instead of crushed, I don't know if it was the brand I used, but it was basically tomato sauce.  I also omitted the oregano and used cumin as a lot of others suggested here.  This will definitely be a regular in my home!

This is just delicious and so easy to make.  Sometimes I add a little cornstarch/water mix at the end to thicken it up but either way it's #1.

Oh, my goodness!  This taste better than in restaurants.  I did change a few things:  I used 2 cans of chicken broth, no water and 1 can of cream of chicken soup.  And I used cumin instead of oraganeo and lots of red cynenne pepper.  We like it spicey.   It was Great!! Definitely a keeper.

Not like the tortilla soup in restaurants, but wonderful none the less. I added poultry seasoning to the chicken when I cooked it, but other than that I followed the recipe to the letter. My husband calls this recipe, "A keeper!"

This was so good!  I followed the recipe word for word except for a few changes.  I didn't know what "hominy" was (small town girl) and I thought it needed salt in the mix.  I will make it again!  Thanks for sharing!

This is my all-time favorite soup recipe. The only change I make is to leave out the hominy (I'm a South Beach Dieter!) but I add in about a quarter cup of dry sherry at the end.  So happy to have found this recipe.  I let folks add crushed tortilla chips, grated cheese and sour cream to their individual bowls, that way everyone's happy!

This recipe is very delicious, and taste like it was from a restauraunt! Because I am a novice in the kitchen, I am usually intimidated of large amounts of ingredience, but I was suprised at how easy this soup was to make! Everyone loved it, and I would make it again!

For this dish, the only changes I made was using 1 tsp dried cumin instead of oregano (as another reviewer suggested) and using 2 cans of chicken broth instead of 1 can of condensed broth and 1 1/4 cups water.  This turned out ok after adding quite a bit of salt.  However, I think I should've stuck to the original recipe, because the cumin and chili powder just overpowered the entire dish.  I will give this recipe another try and used the oregano instead.

We loved this soup! I did make a few changes:  added two cans chicken broth, one cup water, no chile peppers, doubled the corn and took out the hominy. I also used cumin instead of oregano. I let it simmer for an hour. Instead of chips I cooked flour tortillas in veg. oil and then sliced them. YUM! Can't wait to have this again!

This soup was delicious and filling.  I added some fresh squeezed lime juice which made the soup very tangy and good.  I didn't have any hominy.  Everyone loved it!

I added cumin to the recipe and I added 4 cans of chicken broth and let it simmer for about 1 hour and you could taste everything in the chicken.  Everyone loved it, it taste just the restaurants.  It was soooo good.

A good base recipe that responds well to tweaking.  I boiled a chicken, shredded the meat, and made my own stock...a move I would recommend to all cooks for deepening the flavor of the soup.  I was tempted to omit the hominy, but found its texture and--surprise--it's flavor quite enjoyable.

Overall good recipe, I would make it again. I was disappointed that it was not as flavorful as I had hoped. I fried my own tortillas for the toppings rather than using chips. Next time I will add more spices to give it a kick.

I enjoyed this recipe very much, next time i will need to double or even tripple the batch. I did however make some modifications. Instead of hominy i doubled up ont he corn, instead of crushed tomatos i used diced, i omitted the green chilies, and used lots of louisiana hot sauce. I do recommend letting this soup simmer for at least an hour possibly 2. I also suggest that you use the sour cream and cheese, i think it makes the soup.

This soup was extremely flavourful!!  As was suggested by others, I replaced the oregano with cumin and added lime juice.  I recommend decreasing the crushed tomatoes and increasing the chicken broth to about 4 cups. I only used a 1/4 teaspoon of chili powder because my husband and I have a fairly low tolerance for spice!  This is one of the best soups I have ever made!

this soup is great!  like most people, i skipped the hominy and it didn't seem to matter.  One time I also replaced chicken w/ leftover beef fajita and it was great.  do try this one if you want lots of compliments.

After reading comments from the other reviewers, the only changes I made to the recipe were that I added in 1 tsp cumin, halfed the chili powder, omitted the hominy, sliced squash, and added in 1 can of condensed cream of chicken soup. I also added enough water to make it less chili like.. but I thought the chicken soup made the broth richer and taste more like the ones in resturants. EXCELLENT!!!

Combined ingredients in this recipe using the Chicken Enchilada Soup II recipe (by Letha) from this website as a basic starting point, and came up with a dynamite soup.  Hit the spot for us, tonight, with a margarita.  YUM!!!  Thanks Star & Letha!

Only the soup: nothing special. But when I tried the soup with sour cream and grated cheese: delicious! I think that combination does the trick.

This was a terriffic recipe.  Instead of the can of chopped green chilies, I chopped a few fresh serrano chilies which gave it spice.  And instead of the can of crushed tomatoes, I used some leftover pico de gallo.  I cut corn tortillas into strips and fried those instead of using corn chips.  Even my husband loved it, and he always has something critical to say about everything!

Not exactly what I was looking for, but not bad!  I had to add another 14oz can of chicken broth to the soup...it was way too thick and chunky with out it - almost more of a chili consistency.  Good flavor - but won't make again.

I loved this recipe!  As other readers suggested, I substituted cumin (2 t.) for the oregano and chicken broth for water.  I also added the juice of two limes.  How flavorful and simple!  Thanks.

I love this soup.  I prefer it with diced tomatoes instead of crushed, and cumin instead of oregeno.  These changes make it less saucy and more tex-mex flavor.  I don't use hominy either.  This recipe is a favorite at my house.

This is basically a great soup, although I made a few changes.  I added some cumin, some Trappey's Jalapeno hot sauce and a squirt of lime juice.  I also used more chicken broth instead of water and all corn instead of hominy.  It tasted great and the dab of sour cream was a wonderful touch.  My family loves it.

Made this exactly as stated and it was ok...not a whole lot of flavor.  It was also really thick, more like chicken chili, even after I added an extra cup of water.  Don't think I'll make this again, too much work for too little taste.

What can I say but AWESOME!  This soup was the best yet so far.  I had no left overs.  The children and adults loved it and several parents asked for the recipe.  I was worried if the children would eat it because of the chile's, but no worry, it isn't overly spicey for them.  I even had some of them asking me for more, when it was all gone :(  Next time I will make more and freeze it.  You have to try it at least once.  Now I know why it has five stars, it is GREAT!

This soup was yummy. I noticed several poeple saying that it was even better the next day. We didn't have any left over! It was too good. I didn't have any cilli peppers and don't like hot stuff anyway, so I left that out. I had a friend come over and could smell it on the stove and wanted the recipe just by the smell! Perfect for any time!

Adding the tortillas in the beginning makes it thicker than I'm used to, but overall it has a nice flavor.

Loved it!  Absolutely delicious, very easy, and fast enough to make on a weeknight.  Skipped the hominy (couldn't find it), and added a squirt of fresh lime juice when serving.

I made this soup for my anual New Year's Eve soup fest and it was a great success.  The only thing I did differently was to cut corn tortillas into thin strips and fry them in olive oil instead of using crushed tortilla chips.  I sized the recipe up to serve 20 people and it made a HUGE stock pot.  Even though it was the hit of all four soups I made, I still have a lot left over.  I'd make it again just for my husband and myself.  Try it you'll like it.

My husband loved this dish.  I was tired of making the same watery chicken soup for him so this was a nice change.  I didn't use the hominy or black beans because I didn't have them available so it gives me another reason to try the recipe again. :)  My husband will like that. :)

This delicious soup is very similar to Fresh Choice's Chicken Tortilla soup.  I cooked mine using my slow cooker.  I put diced raw chicken at the bottom and added the remaining ingredients, omitting the olive oil.  I cooked it for approx. 4 hours on high.  I also increased the amount of hominy to 3 cups.  The hominy makes this recipe special, in my opinion.

My husband said this was the best soup I have ever made. It WAS good. I doubled the recipe, used a whole chicken, added cumin and a package of taco seasoning. AWESOME! Thanks!

This soup was very yummy!  It was a little spicy but nothing unbearable.  My family loved it and I'll be definitely making it again!  Great flavor and very filling.

This was easy to make and really good and different tasting. I made it for my boyfriend's family. There were leftovers, but they didn't last long!

This is a fantastic soup!  Perfect for a cold winter day and suitable for a main course.  My only recommendation is to add 1 1/2 tsp of cumin to give it that extra bit of Mexican flavor.

It's good and filling -- just what you need for a cold autumn day.  I would even add more of the hominy than is called for as it gives it more texture.  I also used a bit more chicken broth as it tends to thicken after you freeze it.  I wouldn't skimp on the fresh cilantro the recipe calls for, eventhough it seems a tad much.  I would save just a pinch for garnish when it is served.  It freezes superbly.  You'll love it.  A bit much for the small kids, though.

I made it for my family and they all wanted more...it was good because the kids don't like spicy & the adults do so it was the best of both worlds.

I loved this soup!  It was very flavorful, easy, quick, and very delicious.  This was even better than the tortilla soup in my favorite resturant. Very, Very Good!!

Oh, this soup is way too good!  I left out the hominy, however, and added more corn instead.  I also spiced it up more, using more chili powder and cumin.

This was an easy flavorful soup that the entire family enjoyed.  Topping it with scallions, sour cream and shredded cheese made it extra tasty.
