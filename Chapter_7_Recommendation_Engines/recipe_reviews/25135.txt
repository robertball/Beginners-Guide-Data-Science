This is good.  I sauteed some onions, used black beans instead of kidney, added a 4 oz can of chopped chiles, a can of rotel tomatoes with chiles instead of the taco sauce and tomato sauce and 1 14 oz can of diced tomatoes.  Also topped with some crushed tortilla chips and shredded mexican blend cheese.  This will feed a bunch!

No offense, because I'm sure this will fly as "Mexican" fare in the northern states, but the best thing this Texan can say about it is that it was edible. I was reeled in by the "throw together" concept but should have run away when I read egg noodles was an ingredient. This dish was very bland and unexciting. Thanks anyway.

Quick, easy, economical.  I used Minute Rice (YES Minute Rice!)instead of the noodles since I was really pressed for time and I couldn't warm to the idea of mexican spices and egg noodles. Added green onions and topped with monteray jack and cheddar.  My son and husband loved it, I liked it and it made four meals for us.  Served it with a lettuce and tomato salad which was perfect balance with this casserole. I'm giving this recipe 5 stars even though I made changes.  It's a great idea and I love recipes that you can tweak and make your own.  Thanks Sara!

This recipe went over well at my house. I made a couple of good changes. I substitutes rotelle noodles for the egg noodles. This looked and tasted better than the egg. I also used ground turkey, which turned out well. If I were to make this recipe again I would substitute black beans for the kidney beans and add more corn or red/green peppers for more of a crunch.

I made this last night and it was a hit.  I was concerned about how to do the ground beef, though. The recipe didn't say to brown it first so I just mixed it up raw like the recipe indicated.  It cooked up just fine!  Delicious!
Thanks Sara!

This was a quick easy recipe that took little effort. I made some alterations based upon other reviewer's suggestions. I browned the meat with onions, added jalapenos, replaced the kidney beans with black beans and the mild sauces for hot sauces. I also added shredded cheese to the top.

I sort of ad-libbed on this, browning the meat in a large non-stick frying pan first and adding all the ingredients there before transfering to a baking dish and adding the noodles. This was great because I could check the flavoring as I went along. I found it a bit bland in flavor, so I added tabasco sauce to taste, before baking.

Now keep in mind I live in Southern California, so my idea of bland may be just fine for most people! I served with a spoon of sour cream on each serving and found it to be very enjoyable!

What a great idea and easy to make. I also sub black beans, and I use extra olives. Instead of tomato sauce, I used enchilada sauce. I've made it twice, once was a huge batch to bring camping and everyone loved it!

We all liked the recipe and it is quick and easy! I think it would also be good with chopped onion and topped with cheese and a little sour cream. I also cooked the ground beef as it wasn't clear to do so or not and it still was good.

I made a few changes like jalepenos instead of olives and I added a whole onion chopped to the browned beef.  Than I put crushed tortilla chops and cheese on top.

Very easy, very good. The nice thing with this recipe is that you can use what you have in the house- many variations. It turned out delicious with the substitutions I made with what I had to work with! Used ground turkey in place of ground beef, didn't have the olives so I skipped them (although I'm sure it would be great with them too!), used whole wheat spiral noodles in place of egg noodles, used enchilada seasoning packet instead of taco seasoning. Added a little cheese on top near the end of cooking time. I think using the enchilada mix was the best substitution I could have made- they did taste like enchiladas! Yum! Even yum after the healthy substitutions I made too! I think next time I will have to cut up some more vegies to mix in (aka hide in for the kiddies). Such as onion, carrot, peppers, etc. One tip for adding healthy vegies to any dish: even though my kids have out grown baby food- I still buy it to add to dishes so I don't have to puree it and they don't see it. Pureed carrots go great in chilis, Mexican dishes, Italian dishes, etc. And sweet potatoes go great in mac and cheese! :)

We really liked this. It was easy and yummy! If there's something you don't like, it's very easy to make adjustments. The only thing I changed was that I added about a cup of reduced-fat shredded cheddar on top. I will make this again and have already recommended it to friends!

Used ground beef, canned corn, medium salsa, black olives, egg noodles, pinto beans (didn't have kidney), homade taco seasoning 1 (from this site), 1 8oz can tomato sauce with basil and oregano and 1/2 cup water.  What a great recipe to make to your liking or to use what you have on hand.  I didn't bake it, just threw together on top of the stove.  This makes a lot of dinner.  I can't believe that 1/4th of this is 1 serving because 3 of us ate and we still have some leftovers.

Here goes====NO noodles. Use a layer of plain unflavored nachos on the bottom of our pan. Sprinkle with shredded cheddar for the last few minutes and top with sour cream to serve.  DELISH

Wow! I gave it 5 stars with the changes I made. I did not add the salsa or olives and I used diced tomato verses the sauce. I threw everything else in the skillet with the meat (and diced onion) while the noodles cooked in another pan. When the noodles were done, I topped each plate of noodles with the meat mixture and added cheddar cheese on top for those who wanted it. Popped into microwave to melt it. Sooooo good. Adding like this to the rotation.

I made a few changes to this recipe based on others' feedback and it came out great.  We decided to use it as a filling for whole wheat tortillas rather than a casserole.  It was so good.  Here are the changes I made.  I used black beans rather than kidney.  I used rice rather than noodles. (I just didn't think mexican food should be made with noodles.)  I used cooked white rice which I made ahead with 3 cups of water and 1 1/2 cups of rice. Instead of the taco sauce and tomato sauce. I used 1 can hot enchilada sauce, 1 can hot rotel and 1-4oz can of mild roasted green chilis.  This gave it a nice spicy kick.  If you are not a fan of spicy foods, I would use mild Rotel rather than hot.  We like things spicy!!  I baked this as stated.  We then put it into warmed tortilla shells with a Mexican cheese blend and sour cream. YUM!!  This recipe makes a lot so I froze some for another meal.  I hope it is as good after it as been frozen as it was last night.

I left out the taco and tomato sauce and substituted with 1 can Rotel and 1 can diced tomatotoes (not drained). Topped with pepper jack cheese and added some crushed up all natural blue tortilla chips. DELICIOUS!!

Oh My Goodness I've died and gone to a Fiesta in the sky! This dish is great and really easy to make.  It's as flavorful as you make it.  I didn't have any olives or taco sauce (which I'm still not 100% sure what that is).  Instead of those things I added fresh diced tomatos and 1/4 cup of Tabasco Chipolte which is a beautiful smokey kick.  Next time I will add some cheese and I'll also use this recipe for taco filling. Great recipe!

This is a GREAT base recipe. I did my own things to it as well including adding the diced tomatoes, added chiles & taco sauce mentioned above but I also added some cheddar flavored fried onions on top with cheese and changed the beans to pinto. I hate egg noodles so I use pasta shells or macaroni. I prepare this recipe and then put 50% of it away in the freezr before cooking it makes so much! Even then - it feeds us 2-3 times with only 1/2 of the recipe! 
PS: I tried chunky fresh garlic salsa (LARGE jar) once and it was wonderful! NO matter what I seem to add to or subtract  from this recipe it seems to come out of the oven perfect for hungry people!

My husband and I loved this recipe! I used diced red, yellow, and green bell peppers instead of the corn and it was really yummy. It isn't really an authentic mexican recipe, but tasty nonetheless.

Yum! Here's the changes I made primarily for purposes of using what I had: used 1 lb. ground turkey, omitted the olives & taco sauce, added an onion, used a 16 oz. bag of frozen corn, a packet and a half of taco seasoning, a 15 oz. can of tomato sauce and cooked all on the stove in a large frying pan. Once the egg noodles were cooked and drained and the turkey mixture was nicely cooked and mixed together, I combined both and placed all in a 13 x 9 baking dish, topped with a colby-monterey blend cheese and baked for 15 minutes on 325 degrees. When serving I topped with a dollop of sour cream and crushed tortilla chips. Perfect meal for a snow-bound day!

Why is it that if you add salsa and taco seasoning mix everybody thinks it's mexican?  Noodles in a mexican dish?  I think not!  Very bland.  Will not make this again.

I made this last night it was great.  I used Black Beans instead of Kidney.  Also, after I heated through I took the cover off and loaded it with Mexican cheese.  It was great.

Very yummy!! We love tacos, but with 4 children 4 years old and younger, tacos are just too messy.  This casserole has all the wonderful warmth and flavor of tacos with less work and mess involved.  We paired this with "Sweet Corn Muffins" also from this site and the two complimented each other very nicely.  Will definitely make again!  My only change was to add some cheddar cheese, and I think I'll even add more cheese next time.....very good!!

With a few changes, this came out GREAT!  I call it a mexican lasagna.  Browned the meat with chopped onion and garlic powder and then added HOT taco sauce and taco seasoning and medium salsa to the meat while it cooked.  Added remaining ingedients (except olives ... don't like them and black beans not kidney beans) to the meat and then spread over noodles.  Topped it off with mexican blend cheese and it came out of the oven crispy on top and gooey in the middle.  YUM!  And, like lasagna, it was just as good cold!  Boyfriend had two servings!

Great recipe.  I didn't have any taco sauce so I used extra tomato sauce stirred together with taco seasoning, and substituted black beans for the kidney beans.  It was really quick and good.  Thanks

I thought this was very good. The only thing I changed was I used hot salsa and taco sauce. After putting it in the oven for about 20 minutes I sprinkled shredded mexican cheese over it and put it back in the oven until the cheese melted. We have 4 kids and everyone loved it. We will be making this one again!! Thank you!!

My guests and I loved this recipe! I used medium salsa and hot taco sauce and it had the perfect kick (and I don't like my food overly spicy). I added tex mex cheese blend on top for the last bit of cooking and served with sour cream as suggested. Also substituted whole wheat egg noodles and black beans instead of kidney beans. Next time I will add red or green pepper as well.

I changed the recipe by looking at what others had to say and I added one key ingredient....1 block of low-fat cream cheese. I mixed the cream cheese with the taco seasoning and then mixed it with the cooked meat. I also used Rotel instead of the tomato sauce. My husband really liked it.

Affordable and tasty!  My fiance' told me, "I actually really liked it."  I guess he's been kind with this new cook in the past.  :)  We didn't have the olives or the taco sauce, so I just used more salsa.  I also topped the casserole with 6 pieces of cheese.  I only heated it for 23 mins and it was hot all the way through.  YUMMM

I did put a layer of corn chips and cheese on top, and that was good, but, next time I will put a layer on the bottom too.
The first day, our family thought it was a 3 star a bit too moist, some in the family wanted more corn, some wanted more chips, some wanted more beans, we were all not impressed, 
but the second day it was a 5 star, the moisture was gone, we put more chips with it, we didn't add more beans or corn, but it didn't matter it was so much better!

I didn't change a thing and this was excellent, not dry at all. My husband liked it so much he came home asking if there was any left. This was not real spicy so if you like food spicy you might want to consider using hot or medium chunky salsa. I do agree that it needs to be topped with cheese.

Very, very tasty recipe for the whole family. God love you for making this recipe. I did not have the Taco Sauce but added 1/4 cup of V/8 Juice and instead of Kidney Beans, I added "whole Pinto Beans". TI did add the Salsa and Taco Seasoning Packet and Tomato Sauce, didn't add the black olives. This recipe, to me, tasted like "Ranch Style Beans" only a little sweeter, but sooo good.

Very good. I was skeptical when I saw the egg noodles! I added one can of Rotel for a little kick and a can of diced green chiles because we like the flavor.  Sprinkled some mexican blend cheese over the top for the last 15 minutes of baking.  Very versatile.  Will make this again.

Great option for a quick meal! All in my family loved it. I added diced tomatoes, green onions and sprinkled cheese on top. I also substituted enchilada sauce for taco sauce and tomato sauce. I seasoned the meat with the taco seasoning rather than adding it to the other ingredients. In place of the kidney beans, I used leftover chili beans. Overall, this is great and I will be making it again.

This recipe was awesome! I added a handfull of sliced green onion and a couple tablespoons of fresh chopped cilantro and finely chopped jalepeno pepper. I also tweaked it slightly by adding spicy salsa (about a cup and a half) and it definatley has to have cheese on top. Yummy...my 4 yr old couldn't get enough! I am eager to share this recipe with others...

Nothing says comfort like a hearthy pasta casserole and this one is no exception. We added cheese on top when baking but it's also good (and healthier) without it. Make sure to save some for leftovers because it's even better the next day!

Wonderful, quick, and easy!  I substituted a 15-oz. can of diced tomatoes for the taco sauce and tomato sauce, as I didn't have those on hand.  Turned out great!  Be sure and cover with aluminum foil before baking, or it dries out.  Thanks for the recipe!

Absolutely delicious!  The only changes I made were to add a little more chunky salsa, a can of diced tomatoes, and to top it with shredded cheddar that last 10 minutes.  We all loved it with garlic bread on the side.  If we ever get an evening without the kids home, I will make it with jalapenos for DH and I.  Yummy!!!

I used a homemade salsa, homemade taco seasoning, black beans instead of kidney beans and added a little shredded monterey jack cheese both mixed in to the casserole ingredients and on the top before baking. Not a bad casserole--the little ones liked it. My husband thought that maybe the casserole would have been better had I used chopped up tortillas instead of pasta. Either way, it was a quick and economical meal that fed three very hungry boys very well.

The recipe lacked garlic so i added onion and garlic to the ground beef, substituted brown rice for the noodles and added homemade salsa only instead of taco sauce and tomato sauce. For my Mexican husband I added Valentine sauce although my salsa is spicy to begin with. It was awesome made this way. I also didn't add the olives because no one in my family eats olives.

My family and I actually thought this was quite good.  I used more egg noodles, made my own taco seasoning (from an Allrecipes recipe), used frozen corn instead of canned and I didn't have taco sauce, so I used chili sauce instead.  Also, this makes more than 4 servings, maybe 6.

Love~Love~Love it!  After seeing the recipe and looking over some of the other ratings I decided to give it a try.  I saw many people spicing it up by making the dish more theirs with favorite ingredients.  I decided to do the same.  I added in two cans of diced tomatoes (one with green chilies), added some Franks red hot to taste, and topped it off with some Kraft Mexican flavored yellow cheese. I did this all in the few moments my five year old would allow me.  (I had the burger already cooked.)

I used ground turkey for this instead of beef - browned it in the frying pan with olive oil and taco seasoning first.  I used 1 bag of egg noodles, which I put on the bottom of the casserole pan, then mixed the other ingredients together and layered them on top - I also substituted frozen corn for canned (1lb frozen corn), 1 jar of Mango salsa, left out the tomato sauce because my daughter hates it, added a little grated cheddar on top and once it was cooked I added a dollop of fat free sour cream on top.  It was delicious!  Everyone liked it, even my 1.5 year old.

This is a bland recipe that left me disappointed. This probably would have been better with rice instead of egg noodles as others suggested.

This was pretty good- I ended up having to add some Tony's- but a great base- next time I will add cheese and use more olives and black beans instead of red!

This was really good. We all loved it and it was also a great recipe for my toddler son. We love cheese, so I topped it with shredded colby/jack cheese.

This was very fast and easy to make. The ingredients were all things that I had around, which was nice. I was looking for something different to make and this hit the spot. My 10yr old and 3yr old boys even liked it. In addition I used a cup of tomato sauce, crumbled tortilla chips over top and shredded a bit of cheddar cheese on top. I topped off with sourcream and hot sauce, this gave it even more flavor.

Very easy, but not exactly "throw together" when you count having to brown the ground beef and cook the noodles, etc. I'm not complaining though...easy, tasty, just add cheese and you're good.

Thanks Sara, this one, was fun to make.  My 4 sons called me today and asked me what was for dinner.  They explained they were hungry and coming over to eat.  They are grown, well almost..  I looked and found your recipe, it called for, to just throw things together and make a casserole.  I had 3 half bags of pasta, wide noodles, shells and spagetti.  I cooked all 3 and added them to the beef mixture.  Everything I added to the casserole came from my kitchen.  I'm on a tight budget right now.  I didn't want to go and spend money at the store today.  Well, anyway, it was great and the boys almost ate all of it.  It was great for a last minute meal!!!!!

I agree with Peach822, I would add onions, rotel tomatoes and mexi-cheese on top at the end. But it was still a hit today at our “Cinco de Quarto” party!!!

I was out of kidney beans, olives, taco sauce & tomato sauce. Substituted with 2 cups of salsa & 1 can of black beans.  Also topped with mexican cheese for last 10 minutes of baking.  Will be making again.

I made this casserole over the weekend and froze individual portions for a quick week-night dinner.   It is a very good basic casserole the whole family loved!  I added more salsa to mine and 1 small can of green chile's.  Serve with a salad, and you're good to go!

I loved this recipe!!! I will use it again for sure! I used black beans instead of kidney beans. My daughter didn't care for it much until I add a sprinkle of cheese and put it into a tortilla and she ate it like a burrito. She then ate two burritos!

My family & friends raved over this recipe.  My grown son who is a professional cook even likes it.  I brown the ground beef with chopped onions & garlic powder (not very Mexican) before  adding to the other ingredients.  I use jalapeno flavored sliced black olives for an extra kick.

Yummy!! Made a few adjustments - used ground turkey, onion, frozen corn, 14 oz can of tomatoes instead of taco & tomato sauce, added more olives, and hot taco seasoning. Topped it with a Mexican blend shredded cheese. My husband and family can't get enough. Thank you!!

I made a few small changes by replacing the kidney beans with chili beans.  Didn't measure the ingredients and it came out fine.  I liked it better than my son & husband who thought it was just "good".

let's see.. I almost always change a recipe up, just because I use what I have on hand, which was 2 packages of Knorr Spanish Rice in a bag. Added great flavor and I still added the salsa. Family loved it with shredded cheddar on top.

I was stuck home today had a pound of ground beef that needed to be used so I decided to try this.  I tweaked it and used ingredients that I had on hand I used rotini and I sub the salsa with canned tomatoes ready for chili, and I used chili beans in a mild sauce instead of the kidney beans.  I omitted the taco sauce and used my own homemade taco seasoning and sub Tomatoe soup for the Tomatoe sauce.  I also put in 2oz of cream cheese. I then put it all together and I put half in the casserole topped it with 6 American singles put the remaining meat mixture on top sprinkled with a little cheddar and baked as directed.
I put it on a plate and topped it with lettuce ,tomato ,sour cream and crushed Frietos it was a hit in my house!!!!!

I made this recipe last night, and the only change I made was leave out the salsa and add in 1 cup of a homemade hot dog/hot pepper sauce that I canned. This was delicious~! My first instinct was to switch out the noodles for the rice, but I'm glad I didn't do that. My DH said this recipe was a 'keeper'~!

I gave it 3 stars because it wasn't a normal type of meal for me but I had everything it called for on hand and it was a very busy night...I fixed it with rice...used my own cumin blend in place of the taco seasoning...topped with plain Greek yogurt...cheese and guacamole...the family loved it...but will only fix again if the husband or kids ask...

Met with mixed reviews.  "Just so-so to it's wonderful."  I did sub rice for the egg noodles.  I think it should be baked on 350 instead of 325.  It didn't really heat up very well with a slower oven.

This was not very good. It had hardly any flavor, and was runny. It sounds like a good idea, but honestly, after making it, I was angry that i wasted the ground beef.

I'm giving this three stars because while it was terrible, it wasn't all that great. One daughter claimed to love it while the other two refused to eat it! Hubby said it was pretty good...but I do agree that noodles and Mexican flavoring is a bit of an odd pairing. Thanks for sharing !

My family loved this, it was far better than it looked.  It makes more than the four servings listed...maybe eight adult servings.  We added shredded cheddar, hot sauce, and sour cream as optional garnishes, and used corn chips to scoop it up like a dip.  It was a major hit with my young family.  We did leave out the taco sauce and replace it with additional tomato sauce to make it a little milder.

This Texan also agrees that it isn't so "Mexican" but with a few changes this can be a really excellent dish.  I guess a make more than a few changes...I don't usually use meat, I like it better with rice instead of noodles, black beans instead of kidney, make your own taco seasonings (allrecipes has some great ones that taste more authentic), throw in a can of tomatoes instead of the sauce, more salsa and some cheese.  I guess this turns it more into a great rice and beans recipe.  Still it was a good inspiration.

Great, easy meal!  My family doesn't like black olives, I was going to add them to my plate, then forgot.  It was still great!  I added a bit of cheddar cheese on top the last five minutes of baking.

This was a hit in my house.  I used frozen corn, medium salsa (didn't have mild), and I didn't have tom. sause or taco sause, so I added hot salsa instead.

This was pretty good.  I did change the recipe slightly to go with what I had and to suit my familys taste.  Browned the beef with onion.  Use a can of kidney beans and rice (what I had).  Chopped up 2 roma tomatoes and used frozen corn (a cans worth) simmered all this together with the salsa taco seasoning packet while the egg noodles finished cooking.  Mixed this together & then poured into the pan.  Covered with 1 cup of mexican cheese blend (what I had) and olives, and baked uncovered for about 15 minutes.  I didn't have any taco sauce, and I was glad because this was spicy enough to not give to my son...  This will go into the rotation, perhaps next time with summer squash to fit more veggies in...

As casseroles go, this was very good. My only complaint, if it can be called that, was that it was more work than "throw together" in that I had to brown the beef and cook the noodles. Still, I knew that going in. The comments around the dinner table were "wow, this looks just like hamburger helper." While we liked it, it sure felt like more work than hamburger helper so I would have liked people to like it more than the same.

I only made this dish for my son who insisted on tacos and noodles for his birthday. I thought it a weird request so I thought I would try this casserole. I cooked it covered because I was worried about it being too dry. In fact I added a whole cup of the tomato sauce. I am glad I topped it with cheese the last few minutes of cooking. I replaced left-over grilled chicken for the beef and black beans for the kidney. Definitely add the cheese. It was well received but I wasn't that impressed.

I modified the recipe a little.  I did not have salsa on hand, so I added diced tomatoes. I also covered the top with low fat cheddar cheese.  My husband raved about the dish, but my children were less than enamored.  I thought that it was great for a quick dish!

Good comfort food for a crowd. I quadrupled the recipe for a party of 20 college athletes and there was nothing left. I used low sodium taco seasoning, and topped the casserole with a mexican  cheese blend, tortilla chips, salsa and sour cream.

This was very good but still lacked sauce. I read reviews before making and used black beans instead of olives and added a can of Rotel drained then topped with 2 cups of shredded cheddar which was perfect. Next time I think I will add Enchilada sauce but overall it was tasty. When baking it all did not fit into the glass dish so I put remainder in a loaf pan which was perfect size and gave us left over for the next day.

OK casserole, but way too bland to make again.  Even if I worked with it to get it to be more flavorful, I don't think it would ever knock our socks off.  Just not what we'd consider "Mexican".  There are lots of other Mexican casseroles on this site that we've enjoyed a lot more than this one.  A real disapointment.

I used black beans, and added some shredded cheddar and then some mexican blend cheese on top.  I actually made it a little healthier by using the healthy harvest whole wheat noodles, reduced fat cheeses and 93% lean beef. It was good.

Pretty easy to make once beef and noodles are cooked.  I made as is, other than leaving out the olives.  It just seemed missing something.  The concept was pretty good but something seemed bland about it, though it pretty decent, and different.

I used ground turkey,and diced tomatoes (it's what I had on hand) skipped the noodles and the taco seasoning (again I was out) and we put it in tortillas.  It was very good, next time I'll get some taco seasoning it would be much better!

This was a very easy and good recipe, but I to felt it was lacking something. Maybe more taco sauce and less taco seasoning. It was a bit dry! However, even my picky eater ate the whole serving, so I will definetly make this again.

This is the perfect recipe for a throw it together meal. Most of the ingredients if not all you will already have on hand. It is beginner friendly, and you can personalize it to suit your tastes. I added refried beans and rotel, along with crumbled corn chips  lining the bottom of the dish, then I topped with shredded cheddar cheese and served with sour cream. I didn't understand the noodles in the recipe, but I made it with the noodles and guess what? It works, rather will. This recipe also makes plenty, would make a great pot luck dish, or great for the larger family and doesn't break the bank. I failed to mention, this recipe is not only tasty, it's filling.

So far, I have made this twice and its been a favorite in my family both times. Before doing it the first time, I read through the reviews and saw that many people subbed the noodles for something else like rice. I did this both times that I have fixed this recipe, and its worked well.  This second time, I tweaked the recipe to try something different. Instead of ground beef, I added shredded chicken. I took about 6 boneless breasts, placed them in a crock pot, cooking them on high for 3 hours to help give them a shredded consistency which worked out perfectly. Then I subbed them for the beef and followed the recipe the rest of the way, adding the rice that I cooked beforehand instead of the noodles. Both times, I added 3 cups of rice, which came out a little much. Next time, I not only will reduce it to 2 cups, but I may tweak it again and try it with carne asada or steak strips.

I tweaked it a little based on my better half not liking olives. I used Spicy Black Beans, Zest Chili Tomatoes, Taco Seasoning, fresh from the garden diced green peppers and red serranos. I made a crushed tortilla chip crust on the bottom and it was totally delicious!

Followed the recipe exactly except for the kidney beans and noodles. (I hate them). I do not feel it messes with the overall flavor anyway. It was pretty good but it was lacking something. It needed some zing. I was surprised too since it seemed to have enough elements to add a lot of flavor. I am guessing the baking melds some of the flavors and tones it down. I would make it again but would add some more spices and heat.

This dish was good, but needs a few tweaks. First, I felt like noodles didn't really go with this dish, next time I will be trying rice instead. I didn't add olives because we do not like them but I don't think it could have made this dish go from 4 stars to 5 if we did. The dish was rather bland, I think next time I will try some rotel tomates and chiles,  more taco seasoning, or something to boost the flavor. Probably will add in some chopped bell pepper and onion. It definitely needs tweaking but if you aren't picky and you are pressed on time, its a good meal :)

I liked the idea and went off a lot of what was said but instead of egg noodles I used organic wheat ones and chopped onions in the hamburger meat with can of crushed  tomatoes, med salsa,white and black beans. did add olives and corn.  The taco mix I used sparingly during the frying of the meat and when I  pepper and salt the dish I stir more at that point of taco mix! Less then a hour to make .I like to make a lot so when its done I freeze some for later.

My family loved this.   Easy to make and tasted great!   A keeper.
I used black beans rather than kidney.
I always use ground turkey rather than beef, and gluten free noodles.

Eh, this was not bad, but neither was it really tasty- I liked the fact that it was low fat. If I tried something like this again I'd tweak it by adding way more seasonings, and add a can of Rotel.

Good quick recipe.  Tastes just like a taco salad, I even thought about putting it in a tortilla (I used smaller noodles and not as many).  Really good with sour cream too.  Thanks!

This was pretty good, but a bit bland. I used spiral noodles (seemed more tempting than noodles), black beans rather than kidney (reviewers' suggestion), and ground chicken rather than beef (healthier). This was a tad dry when baked, it may be a good idea to cover it while baking.

This recipe was pretty good.  I made a few changes like using black beans instead of kidney beans and i used more taco sauce to give a little more spice.  I do suggest to only use a half of a can of beans in it though or all you can taste are the beans.  I also put cheese on the top and melted it.

A solid "eh".  I added some extra spice, tomato sauce and taco sauce. It's nice to find a casserole that's relatively healthy however.  I'll probably keep it in my week night rotation, but continue tweaking it as well.

Well, it wasn't fantastic, it wasn't horrible. Very easy to make. Kids don't like olives, so didn't put them in, forgot salsa (ooops, thats why rating a 4 instead of 3) and put a layer of sharp cheddar cheese on top before baking. Everyone ate it (except my mexican food hating daughter), my oldest son did have seconds, but nobody wants me to make it again.

I only gave this a three star because of the original recipe.  I found it a tad bit bland for my taste, I had to add more taco seasoning, kicked it up a notch with tabasco which gave it a four star rating.  I would suggest reading other reviews to see what you can do to make it your taste.  I also added green chile.

I love this casserole! It's also very good using ground turkey instead of beef (if you're watching your weight). If I use the ground turkey, I usually add some tabasco sauce while browning it to add some extra flavor to the meat, but watch out! It can get spicy!

Good recipe. My family absolutely loved it. I gave it a four, because it does not call for cheese on top. I would not have liked it without the fiesta blend cheese I added to the top. I also added a can of Rotel and a dash of hot sauce to the beef. I did use the kidney beans, and it was fine- but I think I will try black beans next time just to see if I like them better.

Great recipe for a potluck or when you are trying to feed a crowd.  I used ground turkey and topped the casserole with some reserved olive slices, a few slightly crushed taco chips, dobs of sour cream, shredded cheddar/monteray jack cheese and chopped green onions.  It looked like a loaded taco without the shell.  Made most of it ahead of time and just garnished it and popped it under the broiler to crisp up the chips and melt the cheese on top just before serving, it was a hit, thanks Sara for sharing.
