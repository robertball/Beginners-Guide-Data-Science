This dish was fabulous!!! My husband loved it and when he came in to the house he said it smelled like his favorite chinese restaurant. I did add some mushrooms, garlic and ginger to it and it was great. I would definitley use the kikkoman product because the gravy it made was perfect.

Next time I make it I think I will leave the meat in with the vegetables when cooking them, instead of removing it. I didn't think that the steak picked up as much of the pepper flavor as I would have liked. It was better the next day after it had sat together all night.

This was easy and I was certainly out of the kitchen in a flash, but that isn't always a positive in terms of the final outcome.  In this case, I got out of this what I put into it - it was an edible but boring and forgettable dish. Needs more than hoisin sauce to carry it. On the plus side, our bellies are full.

This was awesome!  I made only slight changes such as;  I used 1 green bell pepper and 1 red bell pepper, the onions I cut in half and then just sliced, I also added a can of baby corn.  I marinated the meat in a few tablespoons of the stir-fry sauce prior to putting it into the wok.  I served it over organic Jasmine rice.  This was a quick and easy recipe that the entire family loved!

I followed this recipe as is and really liked it.  We had never tried that sauce before and we really liked the taste.  It was very quick and easy!  A great middle of the week meal.  We had it on top of brown rice.

This was easy and good (used an organic Hoisin, not Kikkoman).  I've also made just using beef broth thickened with cornstarch and I think I prefer that; the Hoisin flavor was a little 'heavy'.

I guess Hoisin Sauce just isn't for me . . . way too sweet. First time I ever had a main course that was sweeter than the desert. Too bad, because it was very quick and easy.

easy recipe to make, takes no time at all, however it can use more sauce, and maybe add some more vegetables for diversity, depending on what you like.

Tastes great! However, it doesn't taste EXACTLY like the peppersteak from the Chinese Restaurant.

A great basic recipe for beginners in Asian foods– like me.
I also added some fresh mushrooms and served it over rice.

Very Easy and very good as well. I used a little more Hoisin sauce just because we like to have extra. I cooked the Veggies separate but at the same time and combined the meat after it was done as not to add any water cook off. This is a GREAT family recipe and well done!!!!!!

This was pretty good :) Ran out of onions so I added green onions instead. For some reason the meat was a little chewy, but all in all, I'd make this again :)

Double all ingredients.  I also add soy sauce for seasoning.  I took Kali advice and add onions and green peppers to the meat will cooking.  FYI,  before adding veggies,  I drained some of the fluids and set it aside.  Used as a reserve just in case. Taste Great.

I personally added Baby Bella Mushrooms, because I had some that needed to be used. Also, I added one more pepper than the recipe called for, Ginger because I was craving the flavor and garlic because, well, I put it in nearly everything! :)  My husband was resisting the urge to lick his bowl, that is how much he enjoyed it.

I LOVE IT!!! I never could have imagined that it tasted just like a restaurant. I added mushrooms and pineapples like someone else suggested and it was awesome. I would make a little more sauce / gravy next time. I had it over white rice. I will make this many more times. This one is a keeper!!!!

I'm very picky when it comes to my pepper steak, but this was very good. Just a tad bit salty for my taste though. Other than that it was great and I would definitely try it again.

Very good for such a quick meal. I used Sun Luck spicy stir fry sauce instead of the Kikkoman. It gave it a nice hot flavor. Also, I used only half of a bell pepper and half of an onion as this meal was only for myself. Would definitely make again.

I liked the ease of preparation of this dish. The taste was little on the sweet side for me, so I added two pinches of red pepper flakes to my portion. The red pepper balanced the sweetness nicely. I will make it again.

We liked this recipe.  Hoisin sauce was kind of expensive at the store, so I made my own using a recipe I found on line and it turned out great.  I cut up the veggies and steak and marinated it over night in the sauce.  My sauce kind of clumped up during the marinating process, but when it cooked it turned back to liquid. I made sure to make extra sauce and I served the steak over ramen noodles.  The kids even liked it.  I added mushrooms and baby corn to give it more of a stir-fry taste.

I had never tried Hoisin Sauce before, and I was sure missing out!  This was delicious! I already had stir fry steak strips so I used that, red, yellow, green, and orange peppers (and of course the onions) and added mushrooms.  So good!  Thanks for sharing about the Hoisin Sauce!

My friends and I love this recipe. I make it often usually substituting chicken for the steak.  I also add broccoli to the recipe.

I used this recipe at least twice a month. I love it so much.  The flavor is much more like you would find in the restaurant.  I sometimes even use pork instead of beef and it still tastes great!

Very easy recipe and delicious too!  My husband could not get enough.  Serves 4, but the two of us devoured it.  I used red and green peppers.  Excellent!

Liked it.  Fairly simple.  I would only caution about going overboard with the sauce.  I added some extra because I like the flavor, but it turns out that stuff goes further than you would think.  But still pretty good overall.

My family ranted and raved about how wonderful the meal was. My son sautés the pepper steak in Hosin sauce over night. This is the one thing I had never done before, also adding the green onions....

I had orange, yellow and red bells (it was a colorful meal)... and I had a leftover portion of habanero (which was too much, but good)... I added garlic because that's what I do...I loved this recipe and will definitely make it again. I used Jasmine rice with citrus pepper from Alaska...no complaints from husband or son...but unfortunately they're not picky ... hahaha.... Thank you for sharing

Delicious! I listened to other reviews and added a little soy sauce. My grocery store didn’t have plain Hoisin sauce but they did have a Garlic Hoisin sauce that I used and it was yummy! I’ll definitely make this again.

Very good.  I did add some red pepper to give it a little spice, lots of mushrooms because we love them as well as ginger.  The whole family enjoyed this dish.

Loved this! Sauteed the beef first on high for a few minutes then added the peppers, onions, garlic, snow peas, and button mushrooms. Added extra sauce. Cooked it on med/high covered for a few minutes to cook the veggies till soft. I then added chopped pineapple and cooked it for 5 minutes or so.  I served it over brown rice.  It was so good. Boys loved it!!

Just made it as the recipe instructed. the sauce is pretty basic. I'd dress it up with some ginger, minced garlic, siracha pepper paste, and some salt and pepper to taste.

Exceptipnal! My family thought I  ordered from our favorite take-out spot. I didn't have the  hoisen sauce on hand but I  knew how to make it. There were no  leftovers. 
I also  tripled the recipe, by using 6 strip steaks.  My 23 year old son volunteered to  do the dinner dishes That's  how great the meal was!  OMG!

I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe. It was a simple to make and practical meal. I had used 1/2 lb more meat and an extra pepper so I increased the oil and stir-fry sauce slightly. The only thing off the path that I did was add a pinch of salt and black pepper. This came out fantastic and I will make this in the future.

This is very good! I've made it twice both times were a hit! The second time however was very salty which I believe is due to the soy sauce but otherwise it is good.

This was a good basic recipe. Although, both my husband and I agreed that it needed more sauce than was called for to add some extra flavor. In addition to the peppers, I used a stir-fry frozen veggie package, and added pineapple chunks. The pineapples are a must! We will be making this again, though, thanks!

Really good.  Took very little time too.  Would definitely make again but add mushrooms.

Very yummy. The steak was very tender and the peppers added just the right amount of kick to enhance the taste of the meat.
