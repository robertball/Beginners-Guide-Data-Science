After reading the reviews and reading a few other onion recipes, I added a teaspoon of soy sauce and a few splashes of worchestershire sauce to the mix.  This soup turned out "souperb"!

This onion soup lacked flavor. It was every bland and to much bread mixed in the soup. This one I will not make again.

I love love love having dinner ready for me. My boyfriend said this was the best onion soup recipe I've made yet. I used Vidalia onions and cut the recipe in half. The only change I made was to use a really good beef broth instead of chicken. The soup was good as is, but of course I couldn't resist adding another slice of bread topped with cheese, baked on top. Excellent comfort food on what turned out to be a very difficult day for us both. Thanks for the submission.

Yum. I didn't put in the bread (we served it on the side). I also needed much more liquid! Next time I'll either use small onions, or chop the rings in half as it was a bit messy to eat.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  It made for a great dinner to come home to after a long cold day.  My husband really loved this soup!  The only change I made was to add beef broth instead of chicken.
This also freezes well. I froze the leftovers to use as lunch at work.  Perfect!

This recipe was very easy. I added a little sherry and mixed chicken and beef broth. I also toasted my bread with olive oil.

this was great! I made the soup in my slow cooker but did not put the bread or cheese in it until I was ready to serve it. I put the bread and cheese on the soup and tosted it in the oven... very yummy

I used beef instead of chicken as well.  I just didn't care too much for it, and I doubt I would have even if I had used chicken.  My parents thought it was pretty good, tho.  I'm glad I tried it regardless.  :)

This soup requires excellent onions to turn out as savory and flavorful as needed. If you're working with lower-quality or even run-of-the-mill onions, you will need to season it. I added white wine to pump up the flavor, as well as a bay leaf.

I used Beef Broth and it was excellent.  Will make again.  I've never seen this recipe use anything other than Beef Broth, however, some people can have a digestive problem with Beef products so I think the chicken broth would work for those who like that.  It's all a matter of preference and there's something to suit everyone. :-)

This is a good starter recipe.  Next time I make it I will use a bit less onion andquite a bit more broth.  The changes I already made were to use beef broth instead of chicken, and I didn't add the bread while it cooked.  I added the bread to the bowls and put provolone cheese on top.  Delicious!

This is a super easy soup to make.  The smell is incredible.  I'm going to try it with beef broth, but it's really good with the chicken, too.  The perfect cold weather soup!

I hated this recipe. Since I even took the advice of the other reviewers and used beef broth.  I tried it halfway through cooking, and it was very bland, so I added soy sauce and worsh. sauce and added less bread at the end.  The taste WAS alot better, but I still didn't like it. (It didn't go over well with my boyfriend either.) I wound up throwing the whole batch away. I will not be making this again.

First off. For anyone substituting beef broth, that is French Onion. This is Traditional Onion. There are plenty of French Onion recipes on this site, try one of those, not this. That being said, this is the BEST onion soup! I scaled the recipe down because it’s just me and my hubby. 3 lbs of onion is a lot for two. So, I used 2 Vidalia Onions and 2 - 32oz chicken stock. I added 2 cloves of garlic and 4 skinless boneless chicken thighs (cubed). I imagine the recipe, as is, could be a little bland. So, as suggested I added my favorite spices. I used a dash of garlic powder, oregano, basil, rubbed sage, smoked paprika and chipotle chili powder. I slow cooked on low for 8 hours. I added the bread last, after it was cooked and on top of the soup then topped with gruyere cheese. I broiled it till the cheese was nice and bubbly. I was too scared to cook the bread the whole time in the crockpot. This recipes will be a staple in my house from now on. Thank you for this recipe, it is a must try recipe.
