My boyfriend and I really thought that this dressing was bland. I made it with potato soup that had cheese and bacon in it expecting to have a cheese and bacon themed night, but this just tasted like mayonase.

I'm sorry, I did not like this dressing at all.  It made a huge amount and we just ended up throwing it all out. I won't be making this again.

This was okay as a salad dressing but awesome as a dip for buffalo wings! Be warned, though, that it makes LOTS of salad dressing. I will definitely cut the recipe in half when I make it again.

I cut the recipe in half.  I used shredded cheddar and colby jack cheese.  The "cheese sauce" turned into a big clump and I had to add more cream (half and half) to make it anywhere near sauce like.  Then when it cooled it was nearly solid.  I added the bacon, milk and mayonnaise and used my immersion blender to blend it together.  There are still lumps of cheese sauce visible.  I am not fond of this kind of salad dressing but my husband is so he'll be eating it.  We'll see what he thinks of it.
