This was very good! I had to use all russet potatoes as I did not have sweet potatoes on hand. Yummy! Will make again. Probably will add more seasoning to the potatoe mixture next time, red pepper, garlic etc.

This is one of those great cold night, easy to fix dinners. The sausage is nice and spicy and the roasted veggies is a great contrast. So easy to make and would be a great meal to delegate to those who don't have a lot of kitchen skills or do not like to cook.

Easy to make, but rather bland.
