My husband comes from a small village in Scotland and says these are just like the local baker made when he was a child. Excellent! The only change I made was to use puff pastry (for authenticity).

This is a 5 star with a few additions, imo. I used very thinly sliced beef steak instead of ground lamb (personal preference). Added an extra dash of worstcheshire. I made a roux with flour and water to add to the pan while cooking the onions to thicken the runny juices into more of a light gravy. We had a large baked potato left over from the previous nights dinner so I peeled and chopped that up into a small dice to throw in - not very traditional though. Last but not least, I used the 'Flaky Food Processor Pie Crust' from this site to wrap the filling in as I'm more of a from scratch kinda girl.

Very tasty. Will make these again. Make sure to follow the directions to let the cooked meat cool, before trying to put it inside the pastry to bake it!

My whole family loved it!  My kids ask me to make it again!  I used flattened refrigerator biscuits.    I used the egg white to seal and pressed a fork in to the edges. I made 3 dozen. Reheated nicely in a toaster oven.

I had had Bridies for the first time at a celtic festival I attended about 8 years ago.  I found and prepared this recipe and was very pleased with how easy it was, and that it tasted just like the Bridies I'd had at that festival!

I pretty well followed the recipe EXCEPT I put everything into one pie shell and baked it a little longer.  I just didn't have time to make the individual turnovers.  However, I will make this again and shape them according to the recipe.

I couldn't resist adding some diced potato, carrot and tomato to the pan, to put some veggies and color into the dish.  
It made an excellent meat pie. Well worth giving it a try.

These were good and easy to make. I used frozen pie crusts to cut down on the prep. time and added a bit more broth. I would make these again, although I'll probably play around with the seasonings.

Really good.  I will be making this again.  I did alter it slightly by adding one potato, cut into small cubes, and because I didn't have any beef broth I added a little water and extra worcestershire sauce.  Because I didn't want to take forever in the kitchen, I only divided my crust into two different rounds.  I even got the kids to eat it, which is no small feat.

I used ground beef and browned the onions with the beef.  We all thought these were very tasty.  They even heated up well the next day.

Very time consuming but the finished meal was worth it. I added some vegetables to the meat so it was not all meat.  I would definitely make this again!!

I grew up in Scotland and in my part of the country we had carrots and peas as part of the filling. Other than that these are perfect. Please use the lamb and not beef if you want the authentic product.

My Irish Mom (by way of London) used to feed us bridies all the time, from Winston's on 63rd St.  Love them so!  I think I'll try them puff pastry, as the pastry is so flaky, and use pork or beef, or a mix, for the filling.

My husband is from Scotland and after a Burn's supper we had some left over haggis, so rather than use the ground lamb I used Haggis and he loved them.  I will definitely be using this recipe again and again.

OUTSTANDING! Used two pie crusts and cut 8, 5" circles. Cut all portions in half, except beef broth, which I doubled. as others had suggested. Great lunch for four people, two bridies each along with side salad.

I used hamburger instead of lamb as it is hard to find in my area- and I rolled out Rhodes frozen roll dough because I needed to use it, I will definetly make these again, they are similar to Runzas, probably because of my substitutions. Thanks for the recipe!

As written, the lamb is a bit heavy and fatty to me.  Perhaps its more traditional, but I prefer this made with ground turkey or beef.  However, the great thing about this recipe is how versatile it is.  It's an odds and ends meal, and one I make at least once a month!

My mom and grandma and I would always go to our local Scottish festival when I was little. This is a wonderful recipe, and tastes just like the ones I remember. The only changes I made were using a puff pastry instead of pie crust, because bridies really do need that flakey crust, and when I drain the lamb, I will take a few teaspoons of the  fat and mix it in with the onions as I cook them. My grandma always asks me when I'm making them again as soon as we finish eating dinner.

Nice recipe, I liked it.  I made this 2 times.  Second time I added thyme and nutmeg to the meat mixture. Also refrigerated pie crust works better than the frozen one. Thanks for sharing.  I will make this again.

As a Scotsman these are decent, i prefer mine with puff pastry, other than that i made no other changes but i also like to change it up by using beef instead of lamb. Lamb in the midwest is harder to come by and is pretty expensive

I thought this was pretty good, although I did keep the worchestershire sauce with me while eating it, I felt it helped to have a bit more added flavor. I did use pie crust for this, so it was rich, but delicious. Using 6" rounds made it hard to get much filling into it, though; it felt like I was eating most pie dough, which is probably why I needed more worchestershire sauce. Next time I will make these more the size of pasties or even calzones and go quite a bit bigger. Anyway, I will probably make these again in the future, I enjoyed them!

Tried these a couple of times with beef & pork. I did take others suggestion & added some veggie & even tried puff pastry & crescent roll instead of pie crust. Nothing seemed to help & ws disappointed. I do have other recipes from this site that do a "pot pie" type of entree better. I think it just lacked the flavor I'm used to in our cooking, rather blah.

DI_ANE...these are my favorites on the whole website...thank you so much for sharing them!
I fell in love with bridies after going to a Celtic festival.  (They use puff pastry there...yum!)  I couldn't stand waiting for a whole year to have them again, so I tried your recipe.  So happy I did. Love them!

Honestly, no one in my family liked this very much. We all thought a whole onion (even a small one) was too much for this dish. But I'm willing to accept that that much onion may be an acquired taste, which is why I'm giving the recipe a 3 and not a 1.
