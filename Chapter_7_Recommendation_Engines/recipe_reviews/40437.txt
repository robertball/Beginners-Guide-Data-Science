We had an Isaly's Restaurant years ago that served this dressing. It was so popular, they also sold it by the quart.  I add additional onion to help balance the amount of sugar in this recipe.  Also, I added a little yellow coloring to make it reminiscent of the restaurant dressing.  It can be made with prepared mustard as well.  For those on sugar/carb restriction, it can also be made with that famous blue sugar substitute as well, though you will find you need to increase the amount of the sweetener.  Enjoy!

Texans: This is almost a match for Babe's Chicken House house dressing!  It's very sweet, with a nice vinegar tang, and the author is correct, it's surprisingly universally liked.  I do grate the onion instead of finely dice (which is a pain, but results in a nice smooth texture) but other than that, no changes. :-) __Update!__ Also, the flavors become SO much more complex if you let the dressing sit for several hours before serving.  It's phenomenal with spinach, bacon and fresh sliced strawberries.

Usually, I know whether I'm going to like a recipe before I even make it simply by the list of ingredients...but was totally unsure of how this was going to turn out.  I thought the amount of sugar was way to much.  I scaled it down to 4 since I didn't need very much and it was still way to sweet.  The other ingredients really didn't give it a lot of flavor but it did thicken up nicely as it was blending.  Unfortunately, that's about the only thing I enjoyed about this recipe.  Sorry, but this just wasn't my cup of tea.  Thanks anyway.

I have tried numerous sweet and sour recipes...this is DEFINITELY our favorite.  I make a double batch in my blender.  Why does anyone buy bottled dressing when they can easily make this one?

Excellent! I've also tried it with sweet red onion and it was also very good but came out an odd pink colour.

I loved this!  I used thinly sliced red onion and I didn't have any dry mustard so I used prepared Dijon.  Also I thought I'd soy sauce instead of the salt so it would add some color.  LOL!  Now I sound like one of those ridiculous reviews that gives a whole new recipe with the changes they've made!  Regardless...it's good over a salad of mixed greens and mandarin oranges.

If you are looking for the Babe's dressing recipe, this is it!! Made it tonight and it is identical. I only had a canola/olive oil blend but it still tastes the same. Thanks!

Very tasty!  I'd like it to be just a little thicker, though. I wonder if I could add a little mayonnaise to thicken it up without changing the taste.

This is an amazing dressing!  I have been looking for a long time for a parisian style sweet and sour dressing.  The celery seed is the magic ingredient, yum.  I use sugar alternatives so I used 1/3 C. erythritol and 1/3 C. palm sugar.  I did not have enough distilled vinegar so I used apple cider vinegar.  The magic bullet works awesome for this recipe. I just chopped up 1/2 vidalia onion and let the magic bullet do the rest. The dressing has a great, thick consistence that emulsified perfectly.  I also only used 1/2 teaspoon of canning salt, since a little of that goes a long way.  Thank you so much for such a great recipe!!!

I use splenda instead of sugar and serve on a spinach salad.  Combine spinach, bacon bits, asiago cheese, then drizzle the dressing and toss. It has been a hit everywhere I have taken it.

I omitted the onions and celery seed and it was still really awesome.  I served over mixed greens with dried cranberries, candied walnuts, red onion and parmesan cheese.  It was a huge hit at our Christmas dinner!

Thank you for this wonderful recipe. Without straying too far, I substituted 1 tsp onion powder for the onion, and drizzle the oil into the blender for a marvelously thick and delicious dressing that can be used as a slaw dressing or a vegetable dipping sauce.

For those thinking they can use prepared mustard, you don't know what you're missing because it won't properly emulsify.

I'm not a big poppyseed fan, I wanted a sweet and sour dressing to top romaine lettuce with strawberries and blueberries. This dressing was amazing. The only change I made was adding half a onion but only if you like onion flavor. I would make it again.

As a restaurant owner I have been searching high & low for the perfect honey mustard dressing.  Imagine my surprise when I made this delicious sweet & sour dressing and I found it wanting....more mustard! So I added a 1/2 cup stone-ground dijon mustard and a touch more vinegar and I now have THE best honey mustard dressing for KC's Downtown Grill in Windsor, Ca!!!

Very good dressing, a little goes a long way.  I used olive oil instead and it turned out great.  Much more yellow in color, than if you use vegetable oil.

OMG! It is delicious and soooooo easy to make. We like Wos-Wit  Sweet and Sour salad dressing but cannot find it at any of the stores in the Williamsport area. I don't need it now as I use this recipe. It's true I don't believe there's anyone out there that wouldn't love it!!

Really like this dressing. Substituted olive oil for a healthier fat. Like another reviewer said, that makes it quite yellow in color. More sweet than sour. Have to let it get closer to room temp to shake and mix before each use. I do think the serving size is off. I've gotten way more than 8 servings out of it and not gone by a long shot! I would love input on the servings if anyone has some.

A local steakhouse makes this homemade and we loved it.  (and paid for a pint to go!) Didn't know it was so easy, I'll be keeping this in the fridge for salads. We were ok with the amount of sugar, made it as written.  Thank you for a family favorite!

The ratio of ingredients in this recipe is extremely off. I had to add much more vinegar for the recipe to being to have any flavor. I think the ratio of oil should be lessened and the ratio of increased approximately half. I also added Dijon mustard to an added depth of flavor.

Much too sweet and not enough sour to balance it out. It was also fairly bland and very oily.

My family really likes this recipe! I used only 1/4 tsp. of salt and 1/2 tsp of garlic powder instead of onion. I also used raw sugar instead of white sugar and no celery seed. It was very good! Kathy
