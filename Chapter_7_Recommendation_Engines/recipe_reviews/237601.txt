I made this as instructed, no changes or substitutions. It lacked flavor and the biscuit dough didn't cook fully - it was partially raw on the underneath. Maybe this would work for people who can't cook, but I don't think I'll make it again.

Made it exactly as stated in the recipe; wish I had noticed the "Cook's Note" at the bottom of the recipe as the biscuits were a little more browned than I would have liked even after covering with foil after about 22 minutes. All in all, we liked this recipe. It's good for using up leftover rotisserie chicken.
