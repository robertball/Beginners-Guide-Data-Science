We had Coconut rice for the first time in San Francisco a couple of weeks ago.  I searched for a recipe and came across this one.  WOW!!!  This was a big hit and came very close to what we had in San Fran other than I do not recall tasting the texture of the actual Coconut.  That is one thing I would change next time around (I would chop the shredded Coconut very fine)...  I also used Cocnut Cream in place of the Coconut milk which gave even a stronger Coconut taste (YUM)...  We doubled the recipe and did serve with Cilantro...  PERFECT DISH!!!!  This one is going in the book. THANK YOU Karmabelle.

I am surprised others didn't like it as well as we did.  I have tried other recipes and this was by far our favorite! Very creamy and coconutty!  I did not have the coconut oil so just used butter, and added some chopped cilantro to the finished product.  Delicious with thai green curry!

This is good, but when using coconut milk and flake, adding chicken broth will not give the flavor of coconut.  So it is best without broth. Adding Cilantro will give a lovely aroma.  We used this as main dish with spicy chicken curry.

MMmmm so yummy! The coconut oil mixes with the butter to lightly brown rice/coconut before adding the liquids. Since I didn't have the coconut oil I looked in my pantry for another sweet oil; I had peanut and sesame so I went with sesame... This was very good and I can only imagine how good it would be with coconut oil... The lime and coconut made this rice one of the best rice sides I have tried! :)

This was absolutely delicious!  I usually practice a recipe at least once before serving it to guests, but I took a chance and prepared this for a group of friends today, and served it with satay; everyone agreed that it was wonderful.  I followed the recipe exactly (no substitutions), and it was perfect.  We will definitely make this again.  Thank you!

Tasty, yet it needed something, so I added minced fresh cilantro, which we love in Thai, Indian and other Asian dishes.

This rice was wonderful!  I just made it for dinner and everyone loved it.  I had to use long grain rice because we didn't have basmati.  Other than that, I followed the recipe.  (I did use a little extra coconut oil (virgin) for it's health benefits). I will definitely be making this again!!

I loved this!  I used brown basmati rice and it turned out great!  I loved the thickness and stickiness the coconut milk provided to the rice.

Wow - what yummy rice!! I made this exactly as written and it was delicious (did I mention that I LOVE lime and coconut - and rice?) I didn't have any mango, so I added some home made hot pepper jelly (jalapeno) and it was divine. It's a little work to zest the lime, but you HAVE to try this. Oh, I also sauteed the rice and coconut, then dumped it all in a rice cooker with all the coconut milk and half the water. I love this so much, I'm eating it right now for lunch with shrimp.

When I first wrote this recipe, I put that it should be 1/4 cup UNSWEETENED flaked coconut (I prefer Bob's Redmill) but they must've edited before approving the recipe.  Sorry for those that thought it was too sweet, it's not supposed to be.  I always use the coconut milk that is in the carton (like So Delicious), you can choose the fat content and it's more "watery" and helps with cooking the rice.  Thank you for all of your positive reviews!!!

Five stars. I made this recipe exactly as directed and was very pleased with it. It's not sweet, but a bit tangy and very savory. I love the combination of lime and coconut - one of my favorite pairings. The basmati was a perfect choice for this recipe.  I will say though, that when I scaled this recipe up to serve 4, it made way too much, even with a reasonable portion per person. I won't bother doing that next time.

I did not like the flavor of the coconut milk combined with the saltiness of the chicken stock. Not our taste. I probably would have preferred the sweetened version that can be found on this website - it adds a little bit of sugar and uses water instead of chicken stock.

I made this rice with a recipe for Chicken Tandoori. My family thought it was a great pairing. The rice was so creamy and went very well with all the spices used in the chicken marinade.

This was so good! I did not have basmati rice so used a medium grain that I had on hand. Also, did not have the coconut oil or flakes. Regardless, it was so tasty! I used Trader Joe's Lite Coconut Milk. I used low sodium chicken paste for the chicken broth and topped it all off with fresh cilantro. Next time I make this (which will be soon) I'm going to dice some jalapeno's for a little kick. I made this to go with the Curried Red Snapper on this site. I used cod which worked just as well. Thanks Karmabelle for a wonderful recipe.

Excellent flavor.   The zest will hold up better during cooking while the lime juice should be added at the end.  Don't make the same mistake I did when using brown rice instead of white rice. I forgot that brown rice takes 40 minutes to cook not 20 minutes so it ended up holding up dinner!

Though mentioned in Karmabelle's quote, the ingredients don't include the mango and cilantro. For me these must be included - they make the dish. Without them it is very good if the rice is to be mixed with another dish as the flavor lacks a bit (which you would want in that case), but with them it is excellent on its own. It has become my "go to" dish for pot lucks, it's great for that because it's even better at room temperature. YUM! Oh, and if you're not a fan of the consistency of flaked coconut like me, run it through a mini-blender or food processor (or chop really, really well). Makes all the difference!

I will use a half or small lime next time, the juice and zest together was too much. I had to sweeten the rice with some honey as the coconut wasn't balancing the flavor enough. Very good, will be making this again!

LOVED this!!  Hubby was not as fond, but that didn't really surprise me as these flavour combos are not his thing as much as mine...at least he appeased me by having some!!  I had to use a different oil as I didn't have coconut, opted for sesame in its place.  This had an awesome coconut flavour, with a nice lime undertone, nothing too overpowering.  We found this rice to be a bit on the sweeter side, but in a good way.  Excellent dish!

I really didn't care for this recipe. I thought that the lime flavor was overwhelming and I had to add about 2 tablespoons of sugar to make it even edible. I added in cilantro and some thai cinnamon basil which made it look better, but the taste just was not up to par. I really wanted to like this more than I did... Next time I think I will stick with the basic coconut rice recipe and leave out the lime.

This was SO delicious! I had it with Marrakesh Vegetable Curry from this site (really good, btw). I didn't add the coconut flakes, not wanting to open a large bag, but I'm sure they'd work well here. I also did not add the zest. My preference was for a sweeter rice, so I added 1-2 tsp of sugar. Leftovers could be good on their own or made into a rice pudding. Thanks for a very flavorful recipe, Karmabelle!

I served this rice with jerk chicken thighs.  It was very good but a little too sweet for me.  I added extra lime juice to balance the sweetness of the coconut, but next time I will add some cayenne. As is, it was just the right accompaniment for the chicken.

This is a pleasant combination of favors, but unnecessarily loaded with fat...which is why I'm only giving it three stars. I think the coconut milk is unnecessary, & better results would be obtained by adding water & coconut extract in place of the coconut milk.  The recipe as written leaves a coating of oil in your mouth & turns rock-hard in the fridge.  Rice is a food which lends itself well to lower-fat, healthier options, so why load it up unnecessarily with fat?  That having been said, the flavor combination in this rice is good, so it is worth trying without the coconut milk...

My husband and I couldn't decide if we liked this or not at first.  The flavor was very mild and the coconut over powered and hid the lime flavoring almost comletely. After two helpings, we finally decided that the taste was not for us, which is sad because with both love both lime and coconut, apparently just not like this.  :(

little too much lime for my taste - only zest 1/2 of the lime next time.

I went with the chef's suggestion of adding cilantro and mango and it turned out really well - may have been a bit bland otherwise.

I'm vegetarian so just substitued extra water and salt in place of the chicken broth, which I think worked fine. I did need to add additional water throughout because it began frying a bit on bottom. 
I imagine it would go great with a lot of things. Will definitely keep in my recipe box!

Oh my gosh, is this good!!! I've had other coconut rice, but was always disappointed that the coconut flavor was too subtle. THIS is perfect with refreshing lime. I used regular rice and sesame oil, because that's what I have. Served over ripe, in season mango. YUMMY!!! Can't wait to serve to company!

I really enjoyed this, but it was very sweet.  I used lite unsweetened coconut milk and sweetened dried coconut  (couldn't find unsweetened).

I served this with another recipe on this site (Thai Pork with Peanut Sauce).  They both use ckn broth and coconut milk so nothing went to waste. The combination was fantastic.  It would also be great with the Curried Honey Mustard Chicken recipe out here.  This will be my coconut rice recipe from here on out.  My 5 yr old didn't like the lime zest but if I mixed the rice with the peanut sauce, he loved it.  I loved the lime zest.

I loved this, served with Easy Chicken Satay from elsewhere on this sight, and green mango salad. My husband liked it. My son didn't care for the chewiness of the coconut, but liked the flavor. I did kick up the coconut and lime proportions vs the chicken broth, which I think was an improvement. Will make this again.

Very good, thank you! I did expect it to be sweeter and think it could make a big difference to use sweetened coconut flakes, whereas I used unsweetened. But I don't think it NEEDED to be sweeter and once I adjusted my expectation and just enjoyed the flavor it was delicious. I stirred in mango chunks, yum!

Nice change of pace from plain rice. I used a finely shredded, unsweetened coconut and water instead of chicken stock. I was serving this with coconut shrimp and didn't want any flavor of chicken coming through! Very quick and easy to put together.

Delicious!  I didn't have any coconut oil so used a little sesame oil and a little vegetable oil instead.  Other than that, followed the recipe, and it was so very good.  I didn't think my kids would like it but they ate it up.  In the rotation!

thought the rice was really good. I did use olive oil in place of the coconut oil (didn't have it) and kaffir lime leaves in place of the zest (didn't have limes). served with satay. very complimentary. will make again.

I really loved this rice!  Full of flavor.  I thought that I had Basmati rice but at the last minute found out I didn't so I used Jasmine rice and it turned out great!  The texture and flavor was not compromised due the the different rice.  I made this with Ahi tuna and jap. grean beans.  Great light heathly dinner.  Even my daughter who does not care for coconut liked this rice.  This will be the coconut rice recipe I make for now on!

My family really liked this. We ate it with grilled Mahi-mahi.  Mmm mmm. I didn't have fresh limes so I used the lime juice on hand and ommited the zest, it seemed fine. I did add cilantro as suggested by others. This was really good on it's own and didn't need sprucing up.

I did not like this one---I generally love coconut rice and was excited to try it, but I think there was too much coconut milk and the lime made a bit too sour for me.

I made this dish tonight...we loved it!  Unfortunately, I forgot to buy the coconut flakes.  I will definitely not forget them the next time.  My husband said he would give it a 10 out of five stars.

I don’t even know what to say except that this taste was not for me!  I love lime (I actually ate lemons, limes, and oranges as their own food group when I was pregnant... no, not WITH the ice cream... usually BEFORE the ice cream) and I love coconut (I had all those products on hand AND made this to go with coconut chicken) and I have Celiac Disease, so rice and I go together like... white... on rice... but all these flavors combined were surprisingly awkward in my mouth.  First bite said, “Something’s not right.”  I don’t know what it was, but... it was a sour, heavy sort of flavor... like it was trying to be some coconut lime Laffy Taffy and someone forgot to put the sugar in...?  So I put some sugar in... (another coconut rice recipe called for sugar) and that didn’t work.  I tried adding salt.  That didn’t work.  I tried adding some pepper.  That didn’t work.  All I can say is that the only person who liked it was my husband, and he’s willing to eat it for breakfast pre-workout.  Thank goodness.  It actually turns my stomach a little bit just to write this review.  (YES all my ingredients were fresh and bought TODAY!  I do have a big of a sinus infection.  Full disclosure!  I know I’m like the only negative review here.  Something must have gone wrong, be it my taste buds or my process?)

I REALLY liked this recipe, and my husband commented that it smelled sooo good when it was cooking.  I used jasmine rice, because it is what I prefer.  I also used coconut water instead of chicken broth, because I was looking for more of a coconut flavor.  The flaked coconut I used was sweetened baking coconut.  I did add about three tablespoons extra coconut water, because in the past I have noticed that coconut milk is not absorbed readily by the rice.  I also felt that there was too much lime juice, and will cut back on it next time.  The lime was a little overpowering.  But it was yummy!  Also, it started drying out after the second day, and definitely is best if used quickly.  YUM!

We loved this as is!  I did use extra virgin coconut oil. I paired it with garlic lime chicken receipe I found on allreceipes. 
It took longer than 20 minutes to cook. 
 I can't wait to make it again and experiment different flavors.

Yum! Made this with jasmine rice since it's what I had on hand. I did not have coconut flakes so I added a little sugar and extra coconut milk. Turned out great pretty good, but I think I'll halve the lime juice for round 2. I used an actual hand juicer so I got more out of it than if I'd just squeezed it in.

Didn't have Basmati rice , used jasmine rice instead. Followed directions, rinsing rice until water was clear. Put into a pan with Coconut oil & Earth Balance(soy free vegan butterey flavored spread) for 3-4 minutes. I Placed it in my rice cooker & added the rest of the ingredients. After my rice cooker's warming light came on , fluffed up the rice, and some lime zest sprinkled on it! I made an Indian curry to go with it. Absolutely delicious. I will definitely make it again.

I made this a few weeks ago when we were having company over last minute. Hubby grills and I typically do everything else. Well I had never made this before but judging by the recipe I thought the flavors might blend well together. Hubby was a little skeptical. It turned out amazing. So simple, the flavors together were amazing to the palate yet simple in form. We paired with grilled tuna steaks and salmon. I did add the cilantro for a little coloring and that extra hint of flavor. It was really a perfect dish. I am making it again today...obviously the hubby loved it too!

I have made this twice now using Jasmine rice, a little more lime zest and juice. It is excellent!  A permanent recipe in my collection.  My daughter begged me to make it again; she couldn't stop eating it!  Got ribs going in my pressure cooker with a spicy honey sauce.  Can't wait for dinner.

This was a last minute decision so I had to improvise a little, but it still came out amazing!  I didn't have coconut milk so I substituted almond milk, and I didn't have fresh lime so I used bottled lime juice and dried lemon peel.   I also didn't have butter so I used margarine.  It was so good, I can't wait to try it with the correct ingredients, and I think I'll transfer it to a sauce pot to finish cooking, because it got a little drier than I like cooking it in a skillet.  Tomorrow I think I'm going to add some crushed pineapple for a sweet treat.

I really enjoyed this rice dish alongside my slow cooker jerk chicken.  Followed the recipe as written, opting for unsweetened coconut because the recipe was unclear and also because I didn't want it too sweet.  I skipped out on the pepper at the end simply because I forgot to add it, but honestly don't think it's necessary anyhow.  I have found myself, on more than one occasion, daydreaming about when I'll be making it again...

I made this with a few additions for a potluck to accompany a tandoori chicken someone else had made. I substituted 4 c water and 1 cube of vegetable base in place of the chicken broth.  I added cilantro, red pepper and pineapple after it was all cooked. Everyone asked for the recipe. Huge hit!

Pretty good.  I felt like it was a little dry so I mixed up a little extra coconut milk and lime juice at the end.  It would be nice to put a little extra lime zest on it at the end for garnish and extra flavor.

I accidentally used 2/3 cup coconut, and it still turned out great.  This rice was a side dish for chicken satay with peanut sauce.  Next time I will use more lime, because I like a stronger lime flavor.

My husband and I both liked this recipe. The first time I made it I had problems with burning so the second time I used a burner that is even lower on the lowest setting. I used more coconut milk than chicken stock for a creamy result. I don't do low fat anything. This freezes well so  I did not cut the batch down. I use fine shredded macaroon coconut. I find it hard to stop eating this!

Best recipe I've discovered for making rice.  Very tasty and goes so well with Thai cuisine.  Only thing I didn't have on hand was Coconut Oil but it was awesome all the same.

Made this last night and it was great.   My changes:  
1.  Use a cast iron skillet
2.  Don't add coconut oil toast the rice - too oily at the end.
3.  Use a whole can of coconut milk, 4 oz water, one chicken bullion cube.
4.  Don't add extra salt - no need.

I would add the cilantro for sure. This is an excellent base layer for a spicy ginger chicken stir fry or something similar. The rich coconut flavor of the rice is a perfect balance for the spice of an Thai chicken stir fry. I will be definitely be making this recipe again...and again...and again....

The rice came out perfect. The only thing we didn't like was it had too much lime. I think next time I will halve the lime juhc and zest.

I must've done something wrong or, at the very least, had my expectations way too high. The other reviews make me want to try this again. I will replace the chicken broth with plain water next time.

One cup of rice for two sounded a little excessive; I quartered the recipe, and made it without the chicken broth... it was just PERFECT.

Excellent recipe, easy to make and full of flavor. I used coconut cream instead of coconut milk as that is what I had available. I also added a little minced cilantro at the end. Fabulous! Will definitely be making again.

I have a love/hate relationship with rice since I either burn it or it turns out great.  This recipe turned out wonderful.  I did not rinse the rice (colander holes too large) and just added the lime zest since I was using the juice in another recipe.  There was some starch creaminess and rice cooked perfectly in time given.  It is not a sweet coconut flavor and the lime zest really brightened it up.  Great different way to make rice.

mine came out sticky and mushy, I'm not sure if I should have put more liquid in for a sauce or less to make it drier.  Flavor was fantastic, will make again but use more liquid next time

This was a big hit at our Memorial Day BBQ. I omitted the coconut flakes but doubled the coconut oil and added 1/4 cup chopped cilantro after the rice was done cooking. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

I made this according to the recipe.   Hubby is not a rice eater but tolerates it for me.   We both lked it okay.  Next time I think I will add some crushed pineapple and juice to the rice to add just a bit of tanginess.

Excellent dish! I've made this twice now. The first time I followed the recipe with the exception of adding everything into my rice cooker. It was perfect! The second time I had to improvise since I only had Jasmine rice and no coconut milk. I used an additional cup of chicken broth and a little extra coconut oil instead of butter and extra (sweetened)coconut flakes. Then I just dumped everything into the rice cooker without cooking it in a pan. I also forgot to add salt and pepper but it came out just as good and didn't need it. 
I cant express how good this recipe is even with missing ingredients!

My fiancé and I loved this rice!! I made it with sesame turkey cutlets and it paired perfectly! I did everything basically as written except I substituted he butter for olive oil and at the end I added some sliced green onions with the cilantro. Incredible! Will definitely make this again!

I made this today for a big group as a last minute addition to my other potluck offerings for a family feast. I adjusted the rice for 12 people. Since I only had 3 cups of coconut milk I used a can of carnation evaporated and added coconut extract and a cup of reg milk with the extract. I had only 2 limes so I used some juice from concentrate as well  because for 12 people I needed 6 limes. I also didn't have coconut oil so I used olive. It turned out awesome !! I just ate a bowl and I could forgo all the other dishes and just eat this for dinner !  The cilantro was the perfect addition

We made this rice dish for catering the Survivor Fundraiser here a few days ago where we fed over 200 people. Everyone absolutely loved this recipe, even though we were so busy, we didn't get the cilantro stirred in, which really adds to it.  We got more compliments on this and the Shoyu chicken then anything else we made. It was a total hit.

Delicious.  My father does not like rice and loved it.  Definitely make again. Loved the flavour and the consistence of the rice was amazing.

I thought this was delightful. I stirred in chopped mangoes as suggested, and this made it an even bigger hit with my 7-year-old. Great with thai-sauced salmon. I was glad I had coconut oil on hand... I have made other coconut-lime rice recipes, and I think the oil really made the flavors come out. I left out the flaked coconut (all I had was sweetened) and didn't miss it.

I made this as written and served it with some baked salmon fillets.  I thought that all of the flavors together were delicious and would definitely recommend this recipe.  I like a lot of lime so next time I would probably add a bit more lime juice and zest, but that is personal preference. Overall great recipe!  Turned out better than expected.

Well, I kind of hoped for more from this, but I made a lot of changes so am still giving it four stars. The biggest change I made was omitting the flaked, sweetened coconut. I strongly suspect that this recipe is all about the flaked, sweetened coconut, but I didn't have any, and was trying to lighten the recipe up a bit. I tried to make up for it with 1/2 tsp of coconut extract, but I think the missing sweetness was the problem. The end result was totally good, but not worth the calories of the coconut oil and coconut milk. Sometime when I'm not thinking quite so much about calories, I'll try it again as written. Thanks!

This was very tasty - but sweet.  I took another reviewer's suggestion and used coconut cream in place of the coconut milk and butter in place of the oil.  I really loved the flavor, but it was more of a dessert than a side dish (as I had used it). I'll definitely make this recipe again, but I'll have it with fruit for dessert!

I made this almost exactly as it is written. I use extra virgin coconut oil (it's VERY good for you). I didn't have chicken broth so I used 1 1/2 cups coconut milk and 1/2 cup water. I didn't use the lime zest, only the juice. This was so delicious and I will definitely make it again!

This was fabulous!!! I did not have the coconut oil and it still turned our great. It was a compliment to the Mango salsa tilapia I made and will be making this recipe again!

I LOVED this.. even if I DID make it with Cream of Coconut before I realized my error.  I finally added enough water to make the rice soften, so it worked out OK.  Even my husband liked it!

I did not enjoy this rice, although I have to say this is my first time cooking basmati rice and using coconut oil in my food. It was too creamy for my taste. I rate it a three because I am not saying it is a bad dish, but unlike most people who enjoyed this dish, it is not my preferences.

I have a hubby with a very limited palate range. When we go out to eat it's always the same thing: grilled chicken sandwich, grilled chicken salad or occasionally a pulled pork sandwich. I've tried hundreds of recipes in an unsuccessful attempt to broaden our menu at home. He always says he likes rice but only plain white rice with butter, sauce or gravy. For 6 years I've been trying different rice recipes and until now, NONE of them have pleased my hubby. I was absolutely SHOCKED when he said, "wow!" "This is so good!" He commented that it was full of flavor and asked for seconds. His only concern was the fat/calorie content due to the coconut milk (He wants it to taste great with no calories...don't we all) so next time I will try either light milk or reduce the amount and add a little water or coconut water. I served this with a lemon/lime chicken recipe I found on this site and he loved that too! He gave 5 stars for both recipes....FINALLY, SUCCESS AT LAST! THANK YOU!

Slightly tart from the lime (perfect) and unique texture from the coconut...perfect rice! I love it with fish but it would be great with any number of things.

The best rice dish I've ever had! Shared it with many friends, and don't skip out on the diced mango and cilantro, it just makes it that much better!
