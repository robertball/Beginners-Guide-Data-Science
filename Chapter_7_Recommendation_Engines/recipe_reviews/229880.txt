I think I would have liked this better using cayenne rather than red pepper flakes because it would have covered the almonds more evenly.  Also, the almonds were maybe overcooked just a tad for me at the 15 minutes that I baked them.  But are there any left?  No!  This is a little snack food right up my alley!  Thanks!

These are excellent.  I sprinkled pyramid sea salt on top and served them warm.  Thanks for a great recipe!

A cup of olive oil sounded like a lot to me, too, but since it was my first time to try this, I went with the stated amounts of everything (except red pepper; left that out entirely). Next time I would halve the volume of oil but *double* the amount of garlic and rosemary. As it is, there are just hints of those flavors. But I was pleased at the texture after roasting--nice and crunchy.

I used less oil because it just seemed like it was too much. I was right - the amount of oil could be cut in half. Also agree with another reviewer that 15 minutes was too long for the roasting time - I took them out after 9 minutes, and they are perfectly roasted. 
Had to add a lot of salt to make them taste right.

It really wasn't anything special.
