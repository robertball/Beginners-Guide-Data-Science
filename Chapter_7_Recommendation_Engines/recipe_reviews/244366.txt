I really enjoyed this but I think the directions should state to mix everything in a mixing bowl and then add to the ice cream maker (unless mine is the only one that works like that?). I had a hard time with it because I mixed it in the mixer it got jammed before it stirred anything and then I ended up mixing it by hand & dumping it in a freezer container & throwing it in the freezer because I was frustrated with it. I am sure that if I mix it in a bowl first then add it it will be perfect! It tasted delicious! I would definitely make it again. My niece loved it too and I've already shared the recipe with a friend.
