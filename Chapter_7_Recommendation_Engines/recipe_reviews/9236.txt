This is an awesome flavorful stuffing and goes really well with "Ma Lipo's Apricot-Glazed Turkey with Roasted Onion and Shallot Gravy" (also submitted by Christine L.)!!
I make the Apricot-Glazed Turkey with this stuffing every year for Thanksgiving since I discovered Christine's recipe on allrecipes.com back in 2001~Thanks, Christine!

Took forever to prepare.  Turned out good, but not great.  I had to substitute a lot of ingredients though because I couldn't find them, so this is probably why it wasn't as good.

Really tasty, but somewhat expensive and time consuming. I have made this recipe a family tradition for the holidays. Homemade challah bread is the way to go; you will get more crumbs and it will be easier to cut the crust off with little waste if you do not braid the bread. If your kids like mushrooms, they will like this dressing.

Expensive, time-consuming, and not really worth the effort.

Very good.  My only sadness was it wasn't too good reheated as left-overs.
