These cookies were so easy to make and a BIG hit here...the only thing I did different was add some chopped pecans. I was so impressed with the fact these didn't spread out on the sheet, which is one of my pet peeves. I will definately be making these in the future, esp. around the holidays!

These are really good!  I quartered my banana slices and thought that it worked really well.  I was also surprised that my cookies did not spread.  They stayed in little balls.  The second batch I flattened with a fork and liked the appearance much better.  I will make these again!

FANTASTIC!! My kids and I love these cookies!! I substituted whole wheat flour, crisco (for margarine--one kid is allergic to milk) and used craisins and dried blueberries instead of raisins.  The crisco makes them more crispy and less cake like. This is definitely a keeper!!!!!!!!  Thank you so much!!!!!!!!!!

This recipe is fabulous!  The banana is so alive and refreshing, and the other ingredients compliment that flavor.  I used Splenda in place of the white sugar, and the texture was excellent.  I live at 6000' elevation and didn't have to make any other changes in order to achieve superb results!  This is definitely a keeper!

I read the reviews before attempting this and ended up adding just a shade more flour and baking them a little bit hotter and longer (partly because my oven is wonky). They turned out awesome: chewy, but not mushy or crumbly. I'm loving them and I don't even like banana - I was making them for my husband. He ate six in a row and the dog went ape begging for them. Way to trick them into eating healthy food!

Well...they ARE good and Lord KNOWS how sick I am of banana bread.  Gotta say...not "cookie" like...but for me they came out "cakey"...but GOOD!  Don't get me wrong...A GREAT change from banana bread and I would make again.  By the way I used REAL butter and golden raisins and 3 banana's in mine.   **Am bumping from 4 to 5 STARS!** AFTER letting them sit overnight I would give these 20 stars!  Gave some away to friends since this recipe makes so much and am still noshing on mine...these are even BETTER when they sit a day or two.  SO....5 STARS!  Like I said a GREAT change from banana bread and muffins!  Next time I will try some crushed pineapple and nuts in these....just for kicks and giggles.

I never thought I would ever say 'no' to a cookie, but this one just didn't do it for me.  I love oatmeal cookies when they are slightly crispy, but chewy at the same time.  These cookies had more of a banana bread texture, with overly chewy oats mixed in.  They almost became slightly soggy after spending a day in a storage bag.  I liked the flavor/ spice combinations used, but those did not outweigh the texture issue.  Sorry...

Awesome cookie! However, I used tweeked the recipe by using 1/2 cup unsalted butter and 1/2 cup shortening instead of the full amount of 1 1/4 cups margarine. I never use margarine in anything! Also I added 1 more banana. My bananas were kind of small. And I ommitted the raisins and added chocolate chips. I may have been overzealous with the nutmeg also. They turned out great and held their shape, no spreading. The family loves them :)

These taste really good, but they are quite crumbly.  I didn't have any margarine, so I used 1 1/4 c butter and 1/2 c crisco.  I cooked them for 11 minutes (my oven cooks a little hot)and they came out good, but falling apart.  I actually think this recipe would make great oatmeal cookies - just taking out the banana.  But a great alternative to use up bananas besides banana bread!

This is the best cookie. Used real butter and threw in a small handful of mini chocolate chips. They really are perfect.

This is the best cookie I have had in a long time.  Something different than chocolate chip or peanut butter.  I mixed it up the night before and put it in refrigerator and it was so easy just to spoon and bake.  I always throw over ripe bananas in the skin in the freezer so using them to slice for this recipe really made it easy.  The slight frozen made them a cinch to slice.  For the raisins I used 1/2 raisins and 1/2 craisins and added chopped walnuts and coconut too.  Very very good!

Very good taste.  Fell apart when taking them off the cookie sheet even after I let them sit and cool a bit.
My husband loved them.  Will make again.

Amazing cookie. I loved it as is. I also made some with craisins instead of raisins, loved those even more. Added roasted almonds to some as well, loved that. Also made a batch with chocolate chips instead of raisins, fantastic. Would be hard to choose which is my favorite. My kids on the other hand, didn't like any variation of it... they did not like the banana. Next time, I'll make a batch of "oatmeal chocolate coconut cookies". This recipe is a great base to make it with the flavors you and your family most enjoy. (I used 3/4 cup butter & 1/2 cup crisco, and quick cooking oats, perfect texture.)

loved loved loved the recipe!  I had three bananas so used all three - which then needed me to throw in just a extra tad of flour and oats.

I don't have cloves - so didn't use.

My husband loves them - me too! I froze up 2/3 of the cookies to be able to pull out with unexpected guests come.

Thank you!

What a great way to use up those over ripe bananas instead of the typical banana bread! Don't like too many raisins, so backed off the amount to only a 1/2 cup and increased the coconut to 1 1/2-2 cups to offset. Other than that, made as the recipe stated. May have been my oven, but had to decrease to 10 minutes to prevent from burning. Thanks for sharing!

The dough was amazing, but the banana flavor came out a lot when they were baked.  I liked how they were chewy and not cake like like most other banana cookies.  They were really good, just not quite as good as I thought.

Out of all the cookies I have made, these are the only ones my family and friends didn't like at all. My husband ended up taking most of them to work to leave in the lunchroom as he didn't want me to throw them away. I followed the recipe exactly. We did not care for the texture, which my husband said was a cross between a muffin and a cookie, or the flavor. The spices mixed with bananas and coconut just didn't go well together and margarine has a nasty artificial flavor. I would recommend saving the bananas for banana bread and making most any other 5 star oatmeal cookie recipe with 'real' butter. Sorry!

Good stuff!  Chewy/crunchy cookies, not too cake like.  I switched the coconut for butterscotch chips.  The problem then was there was a bit too much "chunky stuff" in the batter so the cookies did not hold together so well, but it tasted great.  1 cup raisins and 1 cup some sort of chips (instead of coconut) would work well.  Not too bananany...no one guessed banana, they guessed oats and raisins though.  May make again.

These cookies are great. I made my own variation of them. Instead of raisins I used Chocolate Chips and I left out the coconut. But they are great. I made them on my stoneware and they were so moist. I still have a few left from over a week ago and they taste and feel like I just took them out of the oven today! Perfect breakfast cookie!!!

These cookies had an excellent taste and texture.  I would not have guessed that the somewhat unusual combination of ingredients would meld together so beautifully.  The texture was very moist and a bit cake-like.  I used very ripe, black bananas, and worried about the appearance of the cookies, but it was not an issue.  I don't care for the taste of margarine, but used it per the instructions, and the cookies were still delicious.  One minor quibble:  they were a bit too sweet for my tastes, so I would probably cut back both sugars by about a tablespoon if I were to make them again.
And it's nice to know that compared to most other cookies, these pack a nutritious punch due to the oats, banana and raisins.

Great recipe! I used butter instead of margarine and omitted the nutmeg and cloves. Also, I split the dough before adding the raisins and then added 1/2 cup raisins to one half and 1/2 cup choc chips to the other. Delicious! My husband even took some to work to share. This recipe is a keeper :)

These cookies are AMAZING!!!  I ran out of brown sugar so only used 1/2 cup, didn't have margarine so used butter and used chocolate chips instead of raisins.  Mine took the full 13 minutes to cook through.  Thank you so much for this recipe!  It's a keeper for sure.

Wonderful recipe, great combination of bananas, raisins, oatmeal and coconut.  Didn't change a thing in the recipe.  I just mashed my bananas instead of cutting into pieces.  This is definitely a keeper.

Pretty good cookies. I wanted to use up some old bananas and this did the trick. Anything but banana bread...
I added chocolate chips because everything is better with chocolate! I also used cranberries instead of raisins.

These were yummy. We used butter, we added pecans, and left out the raisins, because I didn't want it to taste like an oatmeal cookie. Stayed soft for days. I would store in a container in layers, not in a bag to prevent breakage.

These are yummers!  I'm not a huge fan of banana flavored foods, but I was looking for an alternative to banana bread.  I'm very excited to have found this recipe!  I made a few changes:  I used stick butter because that's what I had on hand; I didn't beat the egg because I was lazy; I used Pampered Chef Cinnamon Plus instead of cinnamon/nutmeg/cloves; I didn't slice my bananas; I used half the suggested raisins and used butterscotch chips for the other half; I used a 7 oz. bag of coconut because that's what I had.  My ripe/black bananas had been frozen and they mixed in just fine once thawed.  I cooked them on my stone for 13 minutes and they were a nice golden brown.  Someone went as far as labeling these "healthy"... With the amount of butter and sugar, I wouldn't call them that!  I did, however, double the recipe as someone else suggested and I'm glad I did.  Thanks!

This was EXACTLY what I was looking for, thank you! Lovely cookies that are crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside! I did make a few modifications when I made mine though: Instead of raisins I used dried cranberries/strawberries and I only used 1/4 c butter and added 1/4 milled flax to add some fiber and grainy flavor. Additionally, I didn't use any cinnamon, cloves or nutmeg and it was still very flavorful, even a bit too sweet. I would only add half the white sugar it calls for next time. Might be because my bananas were so ripe and sweet. They also took a bit longer to cook for me, I'd say about 15 minutes so the center isn't gooey. I took a batch to work and kept one for myself. Everyone loved these! Thanks!

Try exchanging chocolate chips for the raisins. They are best right out of the oven or reheated in the toaster oven.

I mashed the bananas and used butter instead of margarine, but that is all I changed.  Will definitely make these again.

Very good! My husband loved these cookies. The chunks of banana added flavour. I was skeptical about leaving them in chunks as I thought the cookie wouldn't cook right but I followed the recipe exactly and it tasted & cooked great! I might reduce the sugar next time and use applesauce instead of all the margerine. These wont las long in my house!
Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

These cookies are awesome, but the name's wrong. I have a thing for fancy names, and these should be "Triply Incredible Cookies": Incredibly healthy for cookies, incredibly yummy for something healthy (actually, just "incredibly yummy" is enough), and incredibly easy to make. I made them for dessert, and even my teenaged brother loved them - if that's not a compliment I don't know what is. I did make some small changes, though: I soaked the raisins in oranje juice for a couple of hours (they were all dried out, and this way they didn't turn into little black holes), used 1/4 cup honey and 1/4 cup white sugar for the brown, as we didn't have any, skimped on the margarine, and halved the bananas lengthwise then cut pretty thick slices, more like chunks, because I was worried they'd get all mushy (I needn't have been). Our oven's pretty old, so I think the temperature was too low, but they still came out great - best texture I've ever had in cookies. Because of my changes, they came out too moist to store in a cookie tin for any length of time, as I'm afraid they'd get mouldy, but with that great taste, storage is not a problem.

These are fantastic.  They're so banana-y!  They stay moist and chewy for at least a week, even if they're not well-covered--another huge plus.

This is really good.  Who knew that banana chunks in cookies would be good?  I followed the recipe but used 1/2 cup butter in place of some margarine.  It was really good.  I added the bananas very last, stirring as little as possible to combine (so they wouldn't turn to mush).  These cookies were a hit with me, my husband, my 2 1/2 year old and my 11 month old.  Next time I might try substituting some of the fat with applesauce or mashed white beans to make them even more healthy.

My cookies came out cake like and tasted like banana coconut loaf.  I would prefer to just have banana coconut loaf.  The taste was great with the cookies but the texture was wrong, probably just my cooking that ruined the texture.  (that's why I gave it a one in the easiness catagory)

Pretty good cookies!  A great way to use leftover bananas.  Tasty, chewy, and moist.

These were ok, but not as great as I expected in reading about it.  Will make again likely, as better than banana bread.  Did fall apart a bit. I needed 12 mins with my oven.  Substitutions made due to ingredients on hand:  no raisins, butter instead of marg.  Otherwise made to instructions.  I liked the chewy aspect.  To me- batter tasted better than they did cooked ;-)  Could have eaten the batter all day!

So I made these tonight but changed it slightly. First no banana, 1 whole egg, less flour and added cashews and used cranberries instead of raisins. I also used bread flour to obtain a little more crew to the bite but overall the finished cookie was rather light. I would make these again in a heart beat and saved this for future.

I substituted the white sugar for 1/2 cup of honey, cut the butter back to 3/4 of a cup, added nuts and dried cherries. Absolutely amazing! Also decreased the oven heat by 25° and baked for 15 min.

I made these for the nursing staff at my work, and they loved them so much they asked me to bring in more the next day! About 5 people asked for the recipe and I forwarded it to them. The only change I made was that I substituted craisins  for the raisins.

Tasty soft cookies with many layers of flavors and a slightly crispy edge.  My family loved it.  I used unsalted butter instead of margerine.  I used 1 1/2 tsp of cinnamon since nutmeg is so expensive.  I left out the cloves since I did not have any in the house.  Completely cool the cookies before putting in an air tight container.  I separated the layers of the cookies in the container with wax paper since the cookies are very soft.

Seems easily adaptable... I used currants instead of raisins and added in about a 1/4 cup of left over chocolate chips.  Cookies keep their shape, very moist.

Delicious cookies.  I used white chocolate instead of dark.   I think I will stick with dark as it is not as noticeable.

This recipe was delicious, I made some adjustments to it and it worked out just as well. Instead of Margarine I used salted butter and just didn't add the salt. I also didn't add any white sugar, an replaced that amount with brown sugar so it was all brown sugar.  I also used whole wheat flour so I added 1.5x the amount of banana needed for some Xtra moisture. I also used dried goji berries instead of raisins! Same bake temp and time and I lined my tray with coconut oil :)

I used butter flavored Crisco (1 cup) then mashed a few bananas to make up the 1/4. 

They were very yummy and my kids begged for more. 

Will be making these again!

Very good. Made with 1/2 coconut oil 1/2 crisco (b/c we are dairy free). Used also whole wheat flour.  Perfected last batch by cooking at 400 for 10min using a cookie scoop, pam spayed pan, and adding a little extra flour.  great recipe thanks

I was wanting to do something with my very ripe bananas other than banana bread and this was the perfect fit! I used butter instead of margarine and they were perfect! I found they browned within the last minute of baking so I watched to make sure they didn't brown too much. I also used parchment paper instead of greasing the cookie sheets and they came right off the sheet with no issue! I also decreased the flour by about 1/8th of a cup as many said they do not spread and i wanted a thinner cookie and they spread out just right. Fantastic! I will use this recipe over and over again!

I think i found a new favorite!! These are delicious. I used crisco like another viewer. I also was low on coconut, so added walnuts and craisins. My first batch seemed to cook too fast, so i lowered my over to 350 and they came out beautiful!! Thanks

When I made it first, it was loved even by my diabetic friend.On this second try, I read ALL the reviews, and made it again with so many changes: I used half cup of peanut oil instead of butter and added applesauce for the other half cup. I used 1/3 cup of brown sugar and 1/3 cup of granulated Splenda. I still used 2 eggs but substituted vanilla with lemon extract. Most importantly, I made it gluten-free by using cornstarch instead of wheat. One reviewer commented that applesauce made it cakey so I used my muffin pans. I still used 1 and a half tsp. of baking powder plus a little more oats. I added cream of tartar this time too. Result: kinda crumbly so I will try adding more egg and oil to the mixture next time. We will see what they taste like tomorrow but it tastes great again right now even with these many changes.  Thanks for this recipe and for each review!

LOVE these! I do follow the recipe but use a Crisco baking stick and 1/2 stick of butter instead of margarine, add another banana(I like the big chunks of it in the cookie), use a half bag of coconut (instead of 1 cup) and add 1 bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips. Most of the time I only bake half the batch and refrigerator the rest to bake at a later time.  Delicious!

Love this recipe. The only thing I did differently, was take out the raisins and added walnuts. I made two batches and not a single one was left by the end of the party. Just make sure they are completely cooled before storing or they will be soggy.

I used real butter instead of margarine. The texture and taste was better than I expected from a banana cookie - not as 'cakey' as anticipated.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Not quite a cake cookie, not quite a hard type cookie.  A nice change and full of lots of good stuff! I mashed one of the bananas and sliced up the other.  Time is just about right. I went about 12 1/2 minutes.

These cookies are oh-so-yummy!  Soft, moist and delicious, and the recipe is perfect just as written.  They're a bit time-consuming, but well worth the effort.  I was impressed by the fact that I was able to let them bake for the full 13 minutes to get them adequately browned, and the bottoms didn't get overly-browned (or blackened) like some cookies do.  Plus, I actually came out with 60+ cookies--more than what the recipe says it makes.  My family is devouring them quickly!
