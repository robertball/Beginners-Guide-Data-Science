Wish I could give this no stars. Not sure what the folks at Campbell's were thinking on this one. I'm a great cook, and my husband and I are not one to throw anything out if it happens to not come out right...but we threw this out. One thing was there wasn't a whole lot of flavor involved in this recipe, other than the paprika on the chicken.  The paprika really has no place in this recipe. The veggies ended up coming out overcooked, they should definitely be put in after the noodles are.  And there is way too much stuff in one pan for the noodles to really cook properly.  But like I said, it tasted terrible, so I wouldn't even bother trying to adjust anything to salvage it.

This recipe was quick, easy, and delicious. Based on the last review which said that this recipe lacked flavor, I made some slight changes/additions. I added Emril's Chicken Rub and Park Hill Maple & Spice Pepper (from Savory Spice Shop) to the chicken before cooking. I also pounded with a meat tenderizer. In the skillet, you'll want to be sure to remove the excess spices that burn/brown. I used fresh vegetables instead of frozen and I added onion and zuchinni. The recipe could have used more than 2 cups of vegetables. I also used rice noodles instead of egg noodles and added dill to the spices at the end. This recipe was great!

I'll agree that this was a bit on the bland side, but I was going for the comfort food aspect of chicken & noodles, not a highly seasoned dish.  I did make it in a different manner as I started with chunks of cooked (rotisserie) chicken.  The only vegetable I used was carrot and I used dry parsley flakes for a garnish.  (My parsley plant is currently in use as a butterfly caterpillar host plant,)

This is my first review, I felt I had to comment on how much my family DISLIKED this recipe. Cooking broccoli with the noodles  allows the flavour to permeate the noodles too much, not a good taste. We did pick out the chicken
