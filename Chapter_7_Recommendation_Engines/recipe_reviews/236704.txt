After this was finished, I thought it tasted pretty good. I always have an issue with store-bought granola being way too sweet. As I don't have a large family, I changed the servings to 4 to try out the recipe. It yielded about 2 cups of granola. I lined a large baking sheet with foil and sprayed it with PAM spray. I actually had the cinnamon suggested I had bought from a spice store. It has a much stronger taste than traditional cinnamon. The cinnamon and vanilla really came through. Only issue I had was that the oatmeal mixture was not coming together. I ended up doubling the maple syrup and corn oil. I also added a sprinkle of sea salt. Both were good ideas. As I was only making 1/4 of the recipe I watched it closely in the oven. I took it out after about 25 minutes stirring every 7-8 minutes. It still got a light brown color and a crisp to it. I tried a little with cranberries first and found them too sweet for this. I opted for using golden raisins instead. Going to try tomorrow with a parfait.

I love all the ingredients of this recipe, and my house smelled wonderful while it was baking.  I was hoping for just a little more of a clumpy result in the final product.  My granddaughters liked this, and that's good enough for me!  Thanks, Mazola!

As other reviewers have mentioned, I would have liked a "clumpier" texture.  I did add some additional maple syrup thinking that might resolve the issue, but that didn't do the job.  I always have a good supply of dried fruits on hand, so I added pineapple, cranberries, apricots, and blueberries.  Also, watch your timing in the oven, this browned up pretty quickly for me.  I eat a lot of yogurt for breakfast and love the crunch that a granola topping adds, so I'm always looking for new granola recipes.  Although this did taste good, there are other recipes on this site that I prefer, and it's doubtful I'll make this again.

This was easy, versatile, and tasty. I had a bunch of dried berries and sliced almonds, so that's what I used and it turned out great. I used this to top some Greek yogurt with honey and it was a great snack! I'd make this again, and often.

I halved the recipe and with minor changes it was a winner with my family. We enjoyed it plain and with yogurt and fresh local blueberries. I used ground flax seed instead of wheat germ to make the granola gluten free. I also used real maple syrup from New York and not the "maple syrup" you typically buy at the store (Aunt Jemima, Log Cabin, etc.) I increased the maple syrup and used 1/2 cup for the half recipe. I baked on a foil lined cookie sheet sprayed with cooking spray and gently stirred only once midway through baking. The granola resulted in tons of clumps... the result I was hoping for. I used dried cranberries as the recipe stated but other dried fruit and nuts would be great in this granola recipe. As others have stated an added bonus to this recipe is how great this recipe makes your house smell.

Is my first time making granola , I really love the flavor not too sweet ,  and as an experiment I cook half recipe  adding the dry fruit at the beginning and the other just at the end .  Well now I now why you have to put the dry fruit last is because it will burn. The other half is delicious

This recipe made the house smell amazing!!  I was also hoping for more clumps in this granola, but it works well when adding to yogurt or making a parfait.  More clumps would have made an awesome cereal.  :)  Watch the time carefully as this bakes!!

Oh my healthy goodness! I received Mazola corn oil for free in exchange for my honest review. I couldn't wait to get started and decided this would be the perfect recipe to make on a rainy day. My house smells amazing and the granola is simple yet very tasty. Surprisingly I have yet to make granola and this was my first experience with it! I love vanilla and cinnamon so this is a new favorite recipe!

Super yummy! my family really liked this.  It seemed like a lot of cinnamon to add but the final result tasted perfect! I will be saving this recipe to make again.

Surprisingly good! Chock-FULL of nutrition! Used pure Canadian maple syrup, toasted slivered almonds and the really, really good (expensive) vanilla, and heart-healthy Mazola Corn Oil. This is a very good breakfast dish. I'd make it again!

Not bad.  Not a very sweet granola at all. I used pure maple syrup, so bonus points for no refined sugar.  I like that is lower in fat than some of the other recipes I have made.  But it is also not very complex in flavor.  Maybe the addition of some coconut next time and I do think it needs salt.  As others have noted, this is not a "clumping" sort of granola recipe if that is what you are looking for.

This was very good! I made this into a yogurt parfait as suggested by Mazola. I made the granola using peanuts instead of almonds and I used flaxseed instead of wheat germ. I added dried blueberries instead of raisins. I served this with peach yogurt and frozen cherries. A very fruity parfait with good granola crunch...I loved it! You can really customize this recipe to suit your taste!
