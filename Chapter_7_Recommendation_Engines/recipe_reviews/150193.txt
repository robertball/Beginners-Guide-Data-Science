I too don't like sweet spicy combo.  I left out the brown sugar and instead of bread crumbs I added 1 cup oatmeal.  When the meatloaf was just about done, I put about 1/4 cup ketchup on the top and smoothed it out and finished cooking.  This was great!

This was super tasty!! I needed a recipe that was quick and included the sparse items I had on hand. Very moist and flavorful; different than any other meatloaf I've ever made. The only thing I added was a sprinkle of crushed saltines and butter in the last 15 minutes (only b/c I have to have a crunch on top). This will definitely be a staple in our household dinners. Thank you!

I submitted this recipe and Im so sorry, even after reading the views, I never checked my typo, you all are right, I only put a little less than a cup of dry bread crumbs.

The flavor of this meatloaf was subtle but good.  I think I would like it better with some sort of sauce over top - maybe some of the salsa and brown sugar combined?  It definitely only needs about a cup of bread crumbs/oatmeal.  We'll be trying this again.

I wanted to like this meatloaf, but like another reviewer commented, there is way to much bread crumbs, which made the meatloaf mushy.  I think with a little tweaking this could be a good recipe.   Less bread crumbs, maybe half the amount.  Less brown sugar, maybe 2 or 3 tablespoons.  I might try this again with the changes I mentioned.

This was the first meatloaf I have ever made and my husband actually said, "Wow, this is way better than my mom's!"  How's that for a compliment! Very tasty recipe, no ketchup needed.  Thanks!

I tried this recipe out and I just didn't like the sweet spicy combo.  The 1/2 cup of brown sugar was way too much and it gave the meatloaf an unnatural flavor.  I think it has potential though.  I will be using less sugar next time and I will also try to figure a way so that it doesn't come out so dry.  I'm sorry for the low rating.

I've never been a fan of meatloaf, so I searched high and low for a savory recipe. This meatloaf is easy to make and always turns out deliciously everytime! When making it tonight, I added chopped green pepper to the recipe and instead of regular or Panko bread crumbs, I used Corn Flake crumbs (no trans fat & chock-full of vitamins/minerals) to up the healthiness of it. My family and I love it!  Serve with mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli or green beans! Perfect!

I thought this meatloaf was very easy and tasty!  I winged a little of it because I wanted to use turkey instead of ground chuck, and I didn't have 1.5 pounds but rather 1.25.  I also added 1/2 cup chopped green bell pepper and only used 1 c. bread crumbs (following others' leads that it might end up dry)... HOWEVER, next time I will use all the recommended 1.5 cups bread crumbs because it was a little too juicy/crumbly without it.  I used 3 Tsp of brown sugar and it was plenty sweet.  Great recipe and I will definitely make it again!

Loved it!  This was my third attempt at meatloaf, and the only one I really enjoyed.  I put tinfoil over it while it cooked, and the next time my husband would like to use a lesser amount of breadcrumbs.  But other than that this exact recipe will be followed!

This was very good - DH loved it and he will make tasty sandwiches from the leftovers.  I reduced the amount of bread crumbs by half, which was a little too much - should have only reduced it maybe 1/2 cup.  Also omitted the brown sugar.  With Josephines salsa, it was a hit!

Made this as is, except a couple times I've substituted ground turkey for the beef.  Incredibly simple to put together, and even better the next night.

This meatloaf fit the requirements for the ingredients I had on hand.  It is easy to put together because of the few ingredients.  I think I'm not good at judging how much bread crumbs it takes to hold something together because mine was pretty loose.  I think I'm more of a fan of using oatmeal rather than the Progresso-type crumbs.  This will make yummy sandwiches for us tonight!  Thanks, Ann!

I added a jalapeno jelly to the top as a glaze then topped with pineapple chunks before baking. YUM!!!! My husband said it was the "BEST MEATLOAF EVER!" :)
