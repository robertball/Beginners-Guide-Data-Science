This is a good start, but how can it be called Chicken Parmesan if it doesn't call for Parmesan cheese?  I would suggest adding a teaspoon of water to the egg and then beat.  The egg will come out fluffier.  I would also suggest adding Parmesan cheese to the Italian Seasoned bread crumbs.  Also, unless you flatten the breasts with a meat tenderizer, you are going to have to bake them longer than 20 minutes, especially if they're large breasts.  Another enhancement I would make would be to use an Olive Oil Fat Free Cooking Spray on the pan before arranging the chicken in it.  There is no reason to rush when adding a recipe on here.  We should all take the time to make it as detailed as possible.

I love this no fry version of chicken parmesan. If you're in a big hurry you can substitute frozen chicken patties. Occasionally when I feel like changing it up a bit I'll marinate my chicken in Italian dressing before dredging in plain bread crumbs.

This is one of the easiest meals I have ever made.  Turns out perfect every time.  I make more than the 4 servings so I always add 10 minutes to each cook time and I add more of each ingredient.  Absolutely delicious.

This was perfect as I don't like to pan fry much on a stove.  I marinated the chicken in Italian dressing and it came out very moist.  Great tasting recipe.

Tried this tonight, it was awesome! I topped it with parmesan, even though the recipe doesn't. I did cook pasta with it too. I have my lunch for work. SO GOOD!

I was only going to give this recipe 3 stars, but changed it to 4 because it was quick and easy.  I don't know if I'll make it again.  I like the traditional way better.

This was really good. I changed the amount of sauce and used reduced fat cheese.

Loved this recipe.  Easy and quick. My husband is a picking eater so when he was willing to try it I was willing to make it. This is his favorite chicken dish now. I have made it twice now and he loves it. Thank You!!

This was so simple and quick. Tasted great! I served this with a spagetti alfredo that took just a minute to put together. I will positively make this again.
