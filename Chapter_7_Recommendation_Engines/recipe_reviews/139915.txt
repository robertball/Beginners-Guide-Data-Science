I'm giving this four stars since (like other reviewers mentioned) the proportion of ingredients seems really off.  After reading the other reviews, I made some adjustments and then it was a 5 star dinner for us.  My husband loved it so much that he was already asking when we could have it again before he even finished the meal.  Even my 2 and 4 year olds loved it.  I used only 1/2 cup flour.  I used half of the amount called for of each of the spices.  I juiced two lemons for the "marinade" and grated the zest from one of the lemons for the spice mix and one for the juice mixture.  This was the perfect amount for five smallish trout fillets.  They fried up nicely and the flavor was excellent.  The only change I would make next time is to use slightly less salt, it wasn't necessary on top of the nice lemon flavor and other spices.  I did saute the leftover lemon juice with some butter to drizzle over rice, which was a nice touch.  All in all a great meal and we will definitely have it again soon!

It is an easy recipe. I find trout needs some zing, so halved the flour and used the indicated amount for all the other ingredients added to the flour- the result was very good. The recipe makes loads of the flour mixture -  lots to store and use another time.

5* with the following minor changes, after reading reviews & making this recipe twice:  Rinse & pat fish dry so coating will stick. Only need 1/2 tablespoon canola oil & 1/2 tablespoon butter, for frying (or it's too greasy). For 2Â½ lbs. of trout fillets, reduce flour to 1 cup but keep other spice quantities the same & add 1 pinch of garlic powder to flour mixture. Omit lemon zest & just soak in lemon juice longer (max. 1/2 hour in fridge). Still makes twice as much flour mixture so I put 1/2 in a shallow casserole dish for dredging & store the other 1/2 in a plastic bag, for future use. Served with buttery, parsley baby new potatoes.

Delicious.  I was looking for a recipe for some trout fillets and this was just the ticket.  Read the other reviews and decided to cut the flour from 4 cups down to 1 cup. I still had more than half of the flour mixture left over!  I wonder if it's not supposed to be 1/4 cup rather than 4 cups. (???) I did not have the lemon zest on hand, so I omitted it and soaked the trout for a bit longer in the lemon juice.  It tasted perfectly delicious, so don't be afraid to modify the flour mixture based on what you have on hand.  I will definitely be making this again - it got big thumbs up from the family. Thanks for the great recipe.

This recipe was tasty and easy enough for a weeknight.  I love it!   This was my first time cooking trout and my boyfriend has already asked me to make it again later this week!  It went really well with pine nut couscous too.

I have made this recipe several times now, and I would give it five stars except, like others, I think it turns out much better if the ingredients are adjusted. Like many, I use only 1/2 cup flour, and there is still plenty.  I left the rest of the spices the same.  I also think the pan should be heated to medium-high rather than medium, as it sears the flour and spices onto the fish much better and brings out the flavors more.

AWESOME RECIPE!!
I did change some of the ingredients, but it turned out to be delicious! 
I use italian bread crumbs with pepper, lemon zest, cayenne pepper, salt and onion powder. And sometimes use salmon fillets instead of trout.

I also marinate the fillets for 15-20 min in lemon juice (one lemon). And cook in about 2 tbs garlic-infused olive oil.

I do this recipe regularly now!

I heeded the advice of others and reduced that amount of flour to 1 cup, but I kept the spice amounts the same.  For the lemon marinade, I used bottled lemon jucie, but used the lemons from the zesting to squeeze over the fish prior to service.    Amazingly tasty.  I hate fish, but I loved this dish.  We served it with a wild rice mix & fresh spinach.

After reading reviews, I decided to halve the flour but leave the spices the same.  It was still more than enough flour.  Served with buttery parslied potatoes and green beans for a quick and tasty weeknight meal.

The only changes I made were to cut back on the amounts of flour and lemon zest, and I added a good pinch of garlic powder. Though I overcooked the fish by a few minutes, it turned out phenomenally - nicely blackened, and bursting with flavor. Delicious! Thanks so much!

I liked it.  After reading comments about it being bland, I cut the flour in half.  I think I over did it on the lemon zest though :)

I made this in the oven because I didn't feel like frying it.  I poured the lemon on the fish, and then added the spices and lemon zest and covered it in foil and baked for 30 minutes.  It was good, but I will try this recipe again as described, to see what it is like.
Thanks for sharing!

The people who actually catch/eat the fish in this house absolutely loved this recipe! I followed the one review that said to cut the dry ingredients in half and I had the perfect amount of flour mix.  I also used lemon flavored olive oil which seemed to add to the flavor.

I loved this recipe. I love lemon. My husband is not a fan, but he doesn't like lemon as much as I do. 
I agree with other reviewers that there was a large amount of flour left over. The only thing I will modify next time is to reduce the flour. I will do everything else the same. Yummy!!!

This was delicious!  I just used the lemon juice and lemon pepper and salt and pepper.  And flour!  I used lemon olive oil, too. Best trout recipe ever.  I will definitely do this one again.

My husband liked and rated it a 4.  I did the 1/2 cup of flour and all other spices as the recipe was written.  I also added 1t garlic powder and marinated the fillets  in lemon juice for 5 minutes because I had no lemon zest.

Got rave reviews!! Only use 1 cup flour instead of 4. I didn't have lemon pepper, so I added some pepper and let the fish soak in the lemon a bit longer.

It is rare that  I give a recipe a five with no reservations.  The only thing I changed was the flour amount.  I cooked one 8 oz rainbow trout fillet.  My husband and I shared it.  So I used 1/2 cup of flour and the spices the same.  I did make a butter sauce as another reviewer did.  I combined one tbs. lemon oil and 2 tbs butter,  added about one tbs left over lemon juice/zest.  I also poured in the dripping from the sauteed  trout plus a dash of Sherry.    Sam is very fussy about fish and he said this was the best he had ever eaten.  Thanks for the great recipe.

If I make this again I will use less lemon - just my personal preference - I found the lemon flavour to be over powering.

Excellent!  Agree with others reviews about too much flour.  Cut back by at least one cup.

Awesome just pure awesome. I love the recipe, the only change I made the second time was adding some more spices to the batter to kick it some more flavor. Thank you!

I work in a cafeteria style restaurant and tried this recipe.  After reading the reviews, I also used much less flour but kept the other ingredients the same.  I made it on a flat top grill and it was great.  The coating held perfectly and we sold all 40 pieces that I made.  It was very simple and quick to make and everyone who purchased it loved it!  Thanks for such a great recipe.  I will be making it again.  flash2

Really good!!!  I had 1 lb of rainbow trout; I'm cooking for myself and my husband.  I used 1/2 cup of flour and then simply halved the spices.  I did lay the trout in lemon juice for about 4 minutes and then discarded the juice.  I think i used about 3 tablespoons of oil to pan fry the trout.  My husband and I both loved this recipe and am so glad we tried this.  I will make it again!

I agree that the measurements of this recipe are off including the 2 tablespoons of lemon pepper. Way too much if you're also adding the zest and lemon juice. Cut this way down and will be much better. And the same for the amount of flour... max 1/2 cup or so. With that the taste is good -

Delicious!  My husband loved it and he doesn't normally eat anything breaded or fried.  I cut the flour down to just what was needed to coat the filets but kept the seasoning amounts the same.  I also sprinkled seasoning on the fish while it was marinating.  We squeezed a bit more fresh lemon on them at the table.

Totally agree with other comments.  I think it is supposed to be 1/4 cup flour.  WAY too much flour.
