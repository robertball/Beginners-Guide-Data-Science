Excellent and five stars with a few changes. This recipe had a good foundation, but also had some glitches, an unnecessarily large amount of sugar being one of them. I worked with this just a little and came up with a dessert that three people nearly devoured completely at one sitting and made a cheesecake lover out of one of them (that would be Hubs, who insists no cheese of any kind belongs in dessert). I reduced the butter to 5 T. in the crust and the sugar to 2 T.  - graham crackers, of course, are already sweet!  With the fairly standard rule of thumb for cheesecakes in mind of 1 pkg. cream cheese to 1 egg and 1/4 cup sugar, I added an extra package of cream cheese to the filling, along with a teaspoon and a half of vanilla.  The topping is just fine as written, I just subbed frozen, sliced strawberries for the blueberries in order to use what I had available. Real whipped cream was the finishing touch.  Absolutely delicious.

I read the reviews and "kicked this up a notch" so to speak. Anyways I used 2 cups of graham crackers, 7 tbs butter, doubled the cream cheese as everyone else suggested, added 1 tsp vanilla to the cream cheese mixture, as well as 1/2 cup sour cream. I kept the sugar amount in the blueberries. Then I cooked everything in a regular cheesecake pan. This was the hit of yesterday's picnic.

Great dessert recipe!  Take my advice and double the cheese mixture and bake for 30 min.  use a 9 by 12 in. pan, I don't think they make an 8 by 12 in.  Also you get many more servings for this than stated, I also used 1 C. butter in the crust, it helped to stay together better.  Also, tastes great without the cool whip.

I think this had potential, but as a virgin cheesecake baker I wish the recipe indicated I should cool the cheesecake layer before adding the blueberries.  Everything blended and I wound up with soup.  Lesson learned, but I probably won't make this again.

I made this with fresh picked wild blueberries and it was amazingly good, but a bit too sweet. I cut it in half, but is didn't seem sweet enough. Next time, 3/4 of a cup. I didn't double the cream cheese layer, but I thought it was still great -- it gave it a subtle cheesecake flavor, but the blueberries really stood out. I made it in a 8 x 12 glass casserole dish and it was very pretty. This was the hit of the picnic.

This was a hit! I did change a few things. I doubled the cheesecake portion, cut the sugar to 3/4 cup, and used a 1/2 cup of sour cream. In the blueberry topping I cut the corn starch in 1/2 as someone suggested, and cut the sugar. I wouldn't cut the sugar in the Blueberry topping again, it wasn't quite sweet enough. After these changes, it was VERY good!

Excellent!  I took the advice of others and double the cheesecake layer and I'm glad I did.  This was super easy and was gobbled up very quickly.  I'll definitly be making this again, and will experiment with other fruit.  I think cherries, rhubarb, or strawberries would work great.

This recipe was sooooo good! I omitted the whipped cream topping because I didn't have any and it was great without it. I also made the dish in a 9x13 pan.. so I doubled the crust and cheesecake portion.  I don't think I should make this again because I had no self control with it in my refrigerator.. I really could not stop eating it!

I only used the recipe for the cheesecake and didn't do the topping, but instead poured a can of cherry pie filling over the top. Was very delicious and thanks for a perfect recipe!!

Very good pie! I cheated and used a ready-made graham cracker crust but it still tasted great. I also added a few tablespoons of lemon juice to the cheesecake mixture and to the blueberry mixture and did not top with whipped topping. Super yummy!

I haven't eaten the "pie" yet, but I did listen to some of the other bakers and I think it is going to be absolutely fabulous!  First, I only had cinnamon graham crackers, not plain.    I have an abundance of fresh berries and used a full quart (4 cups) mixed with 3/4 cup water and the cornstarch, etc.  I didn't use all the sugar as per everyone's saying it was overly sweet.  Also, the picture was of a PIE....not an 8x11 glass dish.   I opted for the glass dish (8 1/2 x 11).  I also used 12 oz cream cheese and 1/2 cup sour cream and a dash of vanilla.   I think it will be wonderful....without the cool whip (yuk)..only whipped cream or ice cream for us!

Excellent.  Everyone loves.  I reduce all sugar ingredients by half and use fresh whipped cream to top individual pieces.  Not really a pie in an 8 x 12 pan and makes 16 servings.

I love love love this recipe, and so does my family. I did change it slightly, I lowered the sugar in the crust and doubled the cream cheese. oh yeah and i let everyone put on their own whip cream or cool whip individually, also I used frozen berries and added no liquid since they were frozen they had plenty after thawing, and use less cornstarch, it works great but that much makes a horrible flavor if you ask me.:) thankyou for such a wonderfull recipe. we shall enjoy it many more days to come :) its a five star if you try it my way and others who reviewed !!!!

This was very good, but I agree that it was a little too sweet.  I could cut the sugar in the crust and the cheese filling. Also, I used frozen blueberries and frozen raspberries.  The topping was wonderful!

I made only the topping as I have another cheesecake recipe that I like.  It turned out very yummy!  I did add some cinnamon to it.

The flavor was good but I had a terrible time with the crust baking hard as a rock on the bottom that I could barely get it up.  Also, the blueberry topping didn't set very well and kind of mixed into everything... not sure what happened here but it didn't turn out well for me

Yum, I only made slight modifications w/ great results. After reading other reviews I also added a bit more cream cheese. I used a regular pre baked pie crust & it worked fine. I did have to bake the cream cheese filling about 25 minutes- not 15! I also used both blueberries & blackberries & cooked the sugar/water/cornstarch until thick & then added the berries so they weren't obliterated. I'll definitely make this again!

I didn't read the reviews before I started and I should have. Adding a little vanilla would've been perfect. For some reason it to over and hour in the oven for my cheesecake to not look super runny. The topping was amazing though.

Very good! I think next time I will make a little extra of the crust so it can be thicker because it was delicious and a good texture with the cheesecake and blueberries. Also the topping tastes a little strange to me when it's super cold, so I would recommend pulling it out of the fridge a couple hours before serving.  The pie was delicious though.  We even made the topping again to put on pancakes!

It needs to cook for more than 15 minutes. I used ready made pie crust. I followed the suggestions and doubled the cream cheese and added 1/2 cup sour cream, but next time I will double the whole cream cheese mixture and add sour cream.  I used strawberries, very good topping, any fruit would work.

This is easy and very good. Even quicker if you use a premade graham cracker crust. Definitely double the cream cheese layer (I used neufchatel), reduce the sugar and use only one egg (two if you double the recipe). Also, 3 T of cornstarch was way too much for the blueberry layer--it was so thick and gummy! I used about half that amount the next time and it was much better. We also prefer this without whipped cream, though I might try it with real whipped cream sometime!

this cheesecake was good, but i thought that the cheesecake part was not rich enough.
I also had to double the recipe for a round pan, and it still could have used more batter.
 I would suggest adding some sour cream and more cream cheese to the batter.  the topping was
delicious though.

This is ab absolutely yummy!!!!
   Once I try this recipy, I cannot stop making it again and again but for me I add just one egg in the cream cheese. With one egg, your cream cheese will be more firm and also reduce the time for cooler your pie after bake too. We cannot wait that long.......yummmmmm

I wish I would've read the reviews first, as I didn't wait for the cheesecake to dry either and ended up with soup. I threw it in fridge right away, with the hopes it will will be edible tomorrow for dinner.  Will try this recipe again with minor adjustments.

I never made cheesecake that wasn't from a box until now! This came out so good and was easy to make. I just need to practice making it look pretty!

I had fresh blueberries to use and tried this recipe and was pleasantly suprised.  The cheesecake portion is excellent.  I do think though that if I try this again that I will use a different kind of fruit, maybe strawberries.

These were good, although I would eliminate the sugar in the crust and use whipped cream next time. I took the advice of others and doubled the cheesecake layer - definitely a must for this recipe. The blueberry topping is nice - I will give it a try in a blueberry pie.

When it turns out it is fantastic.  I had a hard time with cooking times.  It would either be raw and runny or overcooked!  The first time I made it, it turned out perfect.  I reccomend the raspberries over the blueberries, the tartness of the raspberries makes it oh so yummy.  I prefer this cheese cake recipe to all others.

As other reviewers have stated, this is a very simple and delicious cheesecake/pie recipe. Also, as others have suggested, I increased the cream cheese to two bricks versus one. However, due to the increase in cream cheese, the pie crust was filled to the top leaving very little room for the blueberry frosting. I also made it using Splenda sweetener vs sugar and nobody notice and everyone loved it.

Super easy to make and very tasty!  You would think the whipped cream would not add to the flavor but it really does.

I used 1 1/2 pints of blue berries.  I decreased the sugar in graham cracker crust to 3/4 cup and will do less next time.

Getting ready to make this the second time.  I did make some notes about it.  We don't like graham cracker crust, so I just used a baked pie shell.  My notes said to double both the blueberry portion and the cheesecake portion, so I'm planning to do that.   I make pies rarely, so always use a 10 inch pan as my husband just gobbles up pie when I finally get around to it.  We also found it extraordinarily sweet so I will cut the sugar and add some lemon juice.  It is a fabulous recipe, just what I had been looking for.  Tastes great, very rich, so small pieces only.

Easy to make and very tasty!  The cheesecake centre is a little thin (although my husband liked it that way),  so for those who want a thicker cheesecake centre, just double that part of the recipe as other reviewers have suggested.  Also, you could cut the sugar in half for the top fruity part.  I'm looking forward to making a raspberry version of this too!

Delicious!  Lighter than cheesecake and not as cheesy.  Doubled the egg and cream cheese and used my springform pan.  I initially forgot the cornstarch  in the blueberries and added after they were warm---don't do it!  Made a lot of clumps and took me a while to pick them out!  (Blonde moment!). I had fresh picked blueberries and it was great!!  Baked a bit more than 30 minutes until knife came out clean ...cooked and added cooled berry goo!  Left in fridge to get good and cold before eating. Yum!

Delicious! I doubled the cheesecake recipe but cut down on sugar and it was perfect. i also didn't use whipped cream. Another different thing I did was used original club crackers instead of adding graham crackers for the crust(something my family always does). I encourage you all to try it! its delicious. For those of you who actually will try it, crush the crackers before you mix them in or else you make have cracker chunks in the crust but, its delicious all the same. (A package, not a box, a package of club cracker originals makes about two cups and so 3/4 of a package is about 1 and a half cups.)Add the full amount of sugar for the crust to because since the crackers aren't sweet, adding the full amount of sugar won't make the crust too sweet.
    hope this was helpful, and definitely try my crust, you won't regret it!

The sauce was fantastic! I didnt care for the cheesecake, it was very "cream cheesey". But everyone else loved it so I give it 5 stars. I did double the filling, and omit the whipped cream.

This has the potential to be five stars. To make it perfect I suggest doubling the cream cheese filling, reducing the sugar in the bluberry sauce and using fresh whipped cream for the topping. With these alterations it takes an overly sweet, mediocre recipe to YUMMY have too have seconds kind of dessert!!!

This is a great dessert!  To make it simpler, I bought a ready-made graham cracker crust and halved the recipe to make one pie.  Will definately make this again before blueberries go out of season!
