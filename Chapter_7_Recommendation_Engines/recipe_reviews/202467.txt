My husband has been cooking corn on the grill this way for years. You don't have to use the seasoning if you don't like it. The bacon flavors the corn really well. Delicious.

I clean the "hairs" from the corn, wrap the bacon, and pull the husk up over.  Flavor is perfect every time.  I think I'll make some tonight!!!

DH wanted me to try this, but I wasn't sure how I would like this since I don't normally cook my corn anywhere near this long!  I ended up cooking it for 40 minutes total (my grill is charcoal and a little harder to "turn down" to low) and the bacon was nicely cooked and the corn was VERY soft.  I would highly recommend this for store bought corn of dubious age, but for FRESH farm-stand corn, I will stick with a quick turn on the grill so that the kernels are still crunchy and juicy.  All that said, this corn was good, with a slightly spicy, bacon-y flavor that DH and I both enjoyed.  We ate the bacon separately since it didn't stick to the corn.  Four stars out of five because the super long cook time would murder a really fresh ear of corn.

This is a great way to grill corn!  I've made this for years.  Sometimes I will rub garlic butter on the corn before wrapping the bacon.  Or instead, you can use a cheese sauce lightly then wrap the bacon.  You can mix it up a little based on your taste- play around with different things!  This corn is awesome!

Tried this and turned out great! I did burn the bottom of one ear, but other than that, WONDERFUL.  I used another suggestion and put garlic butter on the ears before the bacon.  

Like the saying goes: EVERYTHING is better with bacon!!!

The bacon did not add any flavor to the corn but my husband still enjoyed having a crispy piece of bacon to eat with his meal. We found that our corn burned wrapped in tinfoil and think it would have been better to grill them in their husks like we normally do. Overall we will probably not wrap our corn in bacon again but it was fun to try it once and disappointing that the corn didn't have more of a bacon taste to it.

Everybody liked this!  
Personally I don't like under cooked corn, and I have some family members who need to cut the corn off the cob to eat it, so I boiled the shucked corn ears before wrapping them in the bacon.  The corn still gets the grilled flavor when you roast it, but it's cooked more evenly.

This was AWESOME! I wrapped cleaned corn with 2 slices of bacon on each ear, sprinkled each with different seasoning and then enclosed it in foil.  I used a sharpie to write what flavor was inside.  Grilled them on a gas grill heated to 375-425 for about 55 minutes turning every 8-10 minutes(the temp would fluctuate when we opened the lid to turn). No need for butter or salt as the bacon left a smoky, salty flavor as well as the different seasoning.  I used chile powder on a few, garlic pepper on a few and seasoning salt on a few. Going to try other different flavors next time. What a hit!  My husband really loved this, but who wouldn't love something grilled with BACON.  Thank you for an awesome receipe!

Tasted great, but my bacon was not ready when the corn was.  Still it was a nice change for corn on the cob.

Very good! I only made enough for 3, so I mis-read about the bacon, and only had enough to wrap each ear w/ 1 piece, but that worked fine. I was concerned that the bacon wouldn't brown, but it totally did. I would make these again! Thanks for sharing. :)

My guys loved this!  I didn't have Cajun seasoning per say so I winged it with the spices.  I just wrapped the corn in foil and it worked perfectly.  Definitely a keeper!

Great recipe and like adding the garlic butter.  Usually boil my corn first & oven bake bacon a bit to speed up the time on the grill.  MAT

Our bacon didn't get done, either, but it added an incredible flavor to the corn!  We were happy.  Will finish up the bacon with some veggies tomorrow.

I tried this... but it didn't really work out so good. I too have charcoal & it took awhile... By the time the bacon was done the corn was overdone! I am willing to try it again because I think it would taste great... I love bacon!

I loved the idea of this but with the foil the bacon didn't get crispy enough and still had a lot of unrendered fat. Probably won't make again.

OK, I was sucked in by the gorgeous photo and the fact that my family loves bacon.  However, we were disappointed by this recipe.  The bacon takes so long to cook on the grill that the corn is then overdone. The bacon does not stay on the corn as you're eating it and just gets in the way, so I pulled mine off - which kind of defeats the whole purpose.  Finally, we just didn't care for the flavor combo.  We'll stick with bacon on our burgers and in our baked beans.

I only used one piece of bacon per ear and put the ears on the rack  suspended from the lid over the grill. Definitely turn the ears or they will burn.  We found the corn to be very moist.  Have used this method before and enjoy it as a change from boiled corn.

I read the reviews beforehand so I precooked bacon about halfway and then wrapped it around the corn. It finished cooking while the corn was cooking and turned out great! I did add garlic butter to corn before wrapping for even more taste. I will make this all the time now. I did take the bacon from the corn because it didn't stay on, and placed it on my burger. I still flavored the corn.

I really enjoyed this!  I left them on the grill too long and my bacon got a little too crispy (black in some parts) but the parts that weren't burned were so delicious!  Everyone at dinner really enjoyed, too.  I'll definitely be doing this again!

Amazing! I used cayenne pepper and brown sugar smoked bacon to produce a salty/spicy taste. While it took a long time, it was great! I burned the roof of my mouth eating it as I couldn't wait for it to cool.

Great recipe, but waaaay too long on the recommended cook time.  Their suggested time on the grill is 10 minutes on high, and then 40 minutes on low; next time I'll check the corn after 20 minutes on low.  

p.s. The bacon grease leaks from the foil and causes the grill flames to flare up, so be aware when you're cooking!

Like some suggested, in advance I half cooked the bacon using the microwave just to make sure it would be fully cooked. Rubbed the corn with butter, salt and pepper and wrapped with 1.5 pieces of bacon each. The corn was great and we had nice bacon pieces to go with each ear. I checked on ear at 45 minutes and there was no sign of burning so I gave them about 15 more minutes. Thanks for the recipe!

Flavor was ok- bacon is always a welcomed addition but timing was definitely too long!
Burnt to a crisp and not just the bacon-
Will try again but with adjustments

made this recipe.  I wrapped the corn in pink butcher paper instead of foil.  I rotated a quarter turn every 5 minutes  for the stated length of time.  corn was done perfectly and the bacon was a perfect crispness.   the pink paper absorb all the grease the corn was not all greasy.  great flavor

Why change something that has every food group on it. Butter, salt and bacon... The corn is a good way to hold it all together so it is not so sloppy and doesn't look like breakfast. 
Really, this is  good.

What a different and tasty way to grill corn.  I made this for the first time today and my family loved it. The bacon flavor is in  every bite   We bar-b-que a lot in the Spring and Summer so I will be making bacon wrapped corn all the time

This was pretty good.  I didn't have Cajun seasoning, so I just used salt and pepper.  My only complaint is that the corn started to burn on the ends way before the bacon was cooked all the way, so I ended up unwrapping them and finishing over direct heat.
