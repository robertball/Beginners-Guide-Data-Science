I did a little modifying to this recipe.  Took out the molasses and substituted 4oz. of unsweetened applesauce.  Added 1/4 tsp. ginger and 1/2 cup walnuts.  The flavor is wonderful!  I used a small scoop to drop the cookies onto the cookie sheet.  The cookies did not spread at all...they stayed dome-like.  Had to flatten the next batch before baking so they weren't so high and cake-like.  Easy to make and simple ingredients for a flavorful cookie.  Will bake them again.

Made these for my diabetic DH tonight. He gave them 5 stars for being no-sugar added and 4 stars overall. They were very easy to make. I did substitute 1/4 cup mini chocolate chips for 1/4 cup of the raisins.

Not bad.  I used Olive Oil Spread instead of butter and Agave Nectar instead of molasses both of which are "healthy" alternatives.  The flavour and texture were fine.  I only got a dozen cookies from these ingredients and was disappointed that they didn't spread to fill the 2" gap between 'em.  Yup, I'll cook 'em again.

These cookies taste quite sweet to me, although someone who is not accustomed to stevia may have to get used to the taste. I thought they were wonderful.  I made changes to this recipe only because I am gluten free and dairy free.  I used GF oats and  a GF baking mix in place of the flour.  Instead of butter I used 1/3 cup light olive oil.  I plumped the raisins before baking and I followed others' advice and flattened the cookies with a spoon before baking. Excellent!
