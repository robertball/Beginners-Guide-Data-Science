The family just didn't like it.  As a rule of thumb.....don't add your garlic at the same time as your onions....it over cooks, turns brown, and then makes your dish bitter.  The only thing I did different was to switch step 4 and step 5....melted my cheese first, then let my spinach wilt--otherwise the spinach will be overcooked and brown.  Still.  The family didn't like it and we won't make it again.

I made a 1/2 recipe and used a smaller onion and it was fine.  I also added some chopped mushrooms.  I only had a few mushrooms left - next time I'll add more.  I used kale/spinach mix and it was really good.  I also used shredded bellavitano cheese that I had and it added a really great flavor.  It was really quick and easy to make and I would definitely make again.

once you correctly modify the recipe then its really good. Use 1/2 of an onion and 2 garlic cloves and about 4 tbsp of flour. Warning the sauce turns green from all of the spinach.

WAY too much onion. I had to season this a lot more to get it to not taste like milk sauce. I handed this recipe and it is way more than 4 servings worth. Could have fed 8 off of it.

Made it exactly as the recipe,  we love onions, several times and each time it was wonderful.  Makes plenty that for sure.  I left a star out only because it has a lot of steps to it.
