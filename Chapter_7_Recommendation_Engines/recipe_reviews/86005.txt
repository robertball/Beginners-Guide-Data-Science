This recipe is OK, but when I was in Thailand I learned the Thai style of making curry in a cooking class. 

For a much more authentic taste, do this:

First step: Sautee the curry paste in vegetable oil, then add the meat. At this point, you're only cooking the paste and the chicken in oil. This "activates" the spices in the paste.

After the meat starts to cook (about halfway done) add the coconut milk. This method makes the curry much more flavorful. Trust me on this. I learned it from a Thai chef, and it works. 

Also, if you can get your hands on some Kaffir lime leaves (also called bergamot) use them--add a few leaves chopped finely into the curry just when it's done. This is an essential ingredient in Thai cooking.

Excellent, thank you for this great dish!  I've made Thai curries before, so I made a few minor alterations.  First, heat about 1 TBSP of vegetable oil in large skillet or wok over high heat.  Stir in the red curry paste and stir briskly, until it "foams".  Add the coconut milk, then add chicken.  Cook on high heat for about 4 minutes.  Add the veggies and cook another 3-4 minutes.  The recipe here calls for cooking the veggies too long: remember that in the traditional Thai and Chinese cuisine, they don't cook the veggies until they mush, there is still some crispness left.  This is a keeper!!!!  Oh, and I omitted the sugar; if I were to add sweetness, would just use the pineapple juice.

Update: Second time making this dish.I almost forgot how great this dish is. TIP*If you like a thicker sauce try making a paste/slurry by mixing 2 TBS.flour with 2TBS water and mix well.Then stir it into the sauce towards the end. It thickens up beautifuly! I remembered thinking it was way to soupy the last time i made it so this time i only used one can of coconut milk.The sauce was quit thin so being that i only used 1 can of coconut milk, i combined 1 TBS. flour with 1TBS water and stired it into the sauce towards the end . IT WAS SOOOOO good!! REVIEW FROM APRIL 17 2006: DELICIOUS!!Made this for dinner tonight. Thank heavens i read other reviews and didnt use 1/4 of concentrated curry, which is the one i ended up buying. I used about 1 TBS  and it was just about the perfect level of spiciness for me. I cant even begin to imagine what 1/4 cup would have done!! I think i would have to literally call the Fire DPT! I could only find green curry so thats what i bought. I believe thats what they use in alot of thai dishes anyway. I would definitely make this again!!

MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE RIGHT FISH SAUCE!!  The first time I made this, it was a disaster.  I used very concentrated fish sauce and it smelled awful!  The second time, was with A Taste of Thai fish sauce and it was amazing!!!  I added extra pineapples because I really like the sweet zing they add to the dish

On the curry paste, if you bought it at a specialty grocer you probably have ready to use or prepared curry paste, in which case a 1/4 cup will result in very mild and subtle flavor.  But if you bought it at the supermarket, you probably have "concentrated" curry paste, in which case, 1/4 cup is way TOO MUCH.  Check your label.  I thought the sauce was too thin and next time I will try some corn starch.

This recipe was awesome.  I made it for my inlaws last night and everyone raved about it.  I did make a couple of changes.  I used three chicken breasts instead of one, and I only used 2 tsp. of red curry paste.  Even with only 2 tsp. the dish was still plenty hot.  Next time I make this, I will substitute shrimp for the chicken for a change.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This recipe is incredible. I didn't have red curry paste so I just used yellow curry powder. I also added the pineapple in with the peppers so they would soak up more curry flavor. My husband doesn't really like pineapple in dishes but he loved this. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was spectacular. I halved the recipe (not using the tool here, but just winging it), so I don't know exacty how much of the curry paste I used, but it was deliciously spicy, and the tingle didn't leave my lips for a good long time. That's the sign of a good dish! I agree that it's not enough chicken, so I'd increase that a bit. I used skinless, boneless thighs rather than breasts; for this sort of dish I like the texture better. I also used lite coconut milk; doesn't make any difference to the flavor. Thanks for an excellent recipe that I'll make again and again!

So good! Although, recipe calls for way too much fish sauce. I cut it down to 1 tsp and had much better results. Also, I added peas,lychee, and tomatoes AFTER I removed it from the heat. It's very close to our local Thai restaurant's "house special". Garnish with fresh limes.

This recipie was amazing. It as my first time cooking a curry and this was incredible. I doubled the chicken and halved the curry paste and it seemed to turn out just right as per other reviews. This one is a winner!

I made this last night and it was a huge hit! 
I listed to the other reviews and omitted the sugar (it would be totally unecessary!) and used 3T of the red curry paste. I also didn't use fish sauce and think that 3T of it would be way too salty so I just added 1T of soy sauce and i think that the saltyness was just right. 
My family ate this with some kimchee and thought that that mix of tastes was pretty awesome. haha but then again we are korean and eat kimchee with everything.

I dare say that this is my all time favorite recipe from this site!  The complexity of the taste is absolutly amazing.  I dont do peppers so I ommited them and added mushrooms as a space filler and it fit just right.  Also, a lot of people are saying that the amount of curry paste amounted in a far to hot  result but I disagree.  I could actually go for a little more heat.  Needless to say, I'm in love!

This was awesome.  I made it pretty much exactly like the directions said, except I only used 1 Tbsp of curry paste, and I was really glad I did.  It was perfect - if I'd used any more curry it would have been too spicy for me.  My husband loved it, too, even though he normally doesn't like bell peppers. The only thing I'd change next time is that I'd use the whole 20oz. can of pineapple instead of just 1 Cup.  I will definitely be making this again.  Especially since I have half an onion and half of two bell peppers left!  :)

Yum.. this is wonderful, just like the restaurant-style thai food. I made a vegetarian version, so no chicken and no fish sauce. Still full of flavour and a great meal.

added kafir lime leaves and jullien carrots, and omtted fish sauce and bell peppers (allergy reasons) I tried the method of cooking where you put the paste in the oil, but prefer the way I was taught where you marinate the chicken in the paste before cooking so will try that next time. Otherwise a good wee recipe. Tho there was one flavour missing and not sure quite what it was. Think will try adding lemmon grass next time.

This is a very tasty dish. I read the reviews before cooking it, and I made the following changes: (1) I didn't know whether I had concentrated chili paste but I think I did - I used two tablespoons and it was a very spicy curry; (2) I used 1 1/2 cans of light coconut milk; (3) I only used one tablespoon of fish sauce - I think 3, given the fish sauce, I have, would be too much; (4) I used a full red bell pepper and a full green bell pepper; (5) I used pineapple from a can and instead of adding sugar, I just added the juice from the can; (6) I added an 8 ounce can of water chestnuts; (7) I followed what another reviewer said and heated a tablespoon of oil before adding the chili paste by itself and whisking it quickly until it frothed up.  I ignored the rice instructions and just made the jasmine rice the way I normally do - one cup of rice to 1 and 1/2 cups of water.  The sauce was perhaps a little thin; I doubtless could have thickened it with a slurry of water and cornstarch or flour, but I try to avoid doing that where possible.  But it was a delicious curry.  Next time I'll lower the chili paste to one tablespoon so as to take it easy on my mouth.  I love a hot curry, and it was just at the limit of what I can eat.

I should have paid closer attention to the other reviews re:concentrated curry paste.  We ended up with Defcon-5 level spicy curry!  I ended up draining the chicken and veggies with just a little bit of sauce and adding another plain can of Lite Coconut milk to bring the spiciness down to a level we could handle.  Other than my misstep with the curry paste, this was really excellent and I look forward to making it again.

LOVED this dish. i did as another reviewer suggested - sauteed the curry paste in vegetable oil then added one can of coconut milk and 1/2 cup of 1/2 and 1/2 and 1/2 t of cayenne pepper and 2 T chopped cilantro. i sauteed/browned the pineapple in a small skillet and added it to the dish at the end. my husband is allergic to fish so instead of fish oil i used 2 parts soy sauce to 1 part lime juice. i also used less than a 1/4 cup of sugar. so good!

Delicious!  I sautee'd the curry paste (about 6 tbsp - I didn't want it very spicy) with 1tbsp of olive oil and cooked the chicken in that and added 1 can of coconut milk about half way through as another reviewer suggested. I then added the vegetables and only 2tbsp of fish sauce. To thicken the sauce up I mixed together about 3 tbsp of pineapple juice from the can with 1tbsp of flour and added that to the finished sauce - perfect consistency and truly delicious! Tastes JUST the Thai place around the corner!

This was really easy to make and tasted good for a quick weeknight meal. I served this with green beans and carrots. The sauce had a lovely flavour and the pineapple stopped it from being too spicy.

This was delicious. I used light coconut milk, water chestnuts instead of bamboo shoots, went light on the peppers, used ~1 T of the curry paste and added some chopped up cabbage. I had this with an egg roll for dinner and really enjoyed it. It was very quick to make.

This was a tasty recipe, took some other users suggestions and added less fish sauce (2 tbsp) and coconut milk (1.5 can).  Also ended up using ~3 tbsp of the curry paste which did not make it over-spicey. It turned out quite good, though we were hoping the sauce would be thicker.  Also added fresh mushrooms and shrimp which worked with the dish.  Fresh pinapple was definitely a good idea too.  Served with "Asian coconut rice" also found on this website.  Will make again!

This is a great recipe.  After reading reviews, I only added two and half tablespoons of the red curry paste and two tablespoons of the fish sauce.  Believe the curry paste I had was concentrated because the dish was quite spicy -- but still very good.  I followed what other reviewers suggested and mixed the curry paste with grape seed oil and cooked for about 3-4 minutes, added a clove of garlic before adding the chicken to brown.  My chicken breast was frozen solid so I made this dish in the pressure cooker.  After browning the chicken (used whole chicken breasts -- cld not chop because it was frozen), I added the coconut milk, a dash of ground corriander, fresh cilantro, pineapple juice and the bamboo shoots (drained).  Cooked on high pressure for 15 minutes, then put the cooker on brown and took the lid off so the sauce wld reduce -- for 10 minutes.  Did not have fresh bell pepper, so used one pickled red bell pepper and one orange.  Added the pineapple at the end and served over jasmine rice with fresh cilantro to garnish.  I think a squeeze of fresh lime juice would take this dish over the top!  Great recipe, though!!

I made this following the tip from The Screaming Chef by heating the red curry paste in oil, then adding the chicken, followed by the coconut milk. I also only used 1 T. of red curry powder, and it was plenty hot for us.  This is an excellent tip. The dish was very flavorful and quick to make. However, the fish sauce I used had a very strong smell that was objectionable to me while eating. It was very off-putting. I'd smell the smell, then I'd take a bite thinking how good the dish is, but how bad it smelled. I made it again using a different brand of fish sauce which was a little better but still not good, yet I'm thinking the fish sauce lends to the good flavor of the dish so I didn't want to leave it out. If you have a good quality fish sauce, go for it!

This was amazingly good. I used the whole amount of curry and cooked it in oil for a minute, then added chicken. Cooked that for a couple of minutes then followed the rest of the recipe. Added finely chopped lime leaves at the end. Excellent

Thsi was very good, but my family hated it.  I LOVED it so my review stands!! I hate fish sauce so I left it out, and added fresh lime juice at the end.  A touch too much sugar, I think, could've used maybe 2 Tbsp. not 1/4 cup.  My daughter wouldn't eat it because it was too sweet.  All in all, a nice recipe!

I made this for dinner last night.  I took The Screaming Chef's advice on directions.  I used much less curry paste - maybe 2 tsp. (DH is a wuss when it comes to spicy food) and we both loved it.  I cut the recipe in half but kept the 2 chicken breasts halves because I thought 2 was not enough for 6 people - it was just right for 3.  We enjoyed this dish a lot and will be making it again.  If you have access to Kefir lime leaves, use them - it gives this dish a great taste.  Luckily, I have a tree on the patio.

This recipe is easy, tasty, and pretty close to my favorite Thai restaurant's mussaman curry, although a little too spicy for my husband's taste. The only change real change I made to the recipe was to reduce the sugar by half and next time I may leave it out entirely, because the pineapple sweetens the dish quite a bit. Next time I make it I'll cut back a bit on the curry paste and pineapple, but add some sweet potato chunks and pecan halves. This was a great week night dinner thanks to the ease of preparation; to make it a little healthier I served it over brown rice. I also recommend using a fresh pineapple cut in to nice-sized chunks, because the fresh pineapple flavor really improves the quality of the dish.

OMG!!! As good or better than any I have had at local restaurants. I used one can of reg and one can of light coconut milk, substituted water chestnuts for the bamboo. I used crushed pineapple and added some of the juice to the sauce. Garnished with cilantro. SO YUMMY!

Good!  My boyfriend said it was better than a local thai restaurant!  I probably only added 1-2 Tbs of fish sauce, and next time I would add some garlic.  But this is great - sweet and spicy!

excellent- even though I used regular, un-concentrated curry paste, I only used 4 T and I thought it was just the right amount of spiciness. still left my mouth burning. Chicken only took 6 mins to cook, next time I will put veggies in at the same time. Don't want to cook chicken to death. I cut the sugar to just 2 Tablespoons. Still it turned out fab. rave reviews from all 4 of us who ate it. Just like my fav. thai restaurant.

AMAZING!!! I love Thai food and I thought that you could not beat going to a propper Thai restaurant. How wrong can someone be? :) Try this, you wont regret it. Actually, I used a full jar of curry paste (220g non concentrate) compared with the recommended 40g for 4 servings. It's not overly spicy, just right in fact. Even my wife loved it and she's not really too keen on spicy food. A word of advice regarding the fish sauce, only use 10ml. The smell of that stuff is awful and if you use any more than 10ml then the smell will put you off your meal. As I was cooking the curry the smell of the fish sauce was upstairs! So be careful!

This recipe was awesome! very easy and doesn't require a lot of time besides prepping and chopping veggies and meat. In my opinion, the fish sauce was a bit too strong in here, so next time I will lessen by 1 or 2 tbsp. I saw another review that mentioned the same thing, and wonder if it depends on the brand you buy. And definitely add the pineapple JUST before plating, as the pineapple's juice makes the curry a lot thinner and breaks the "creamy" consistency if the pineapple is in the wok for too long with everything else. Also, I didn't have granulated sugar so I just added a bit of maple syrup, but I am thinking that it could even do without any sweetener. Overall, SUPER easy recipe for curry and this will definitely be a favorite for us to make!

Perfect.  I prepared it a little different in that I left it cooking on low for about an hour on the stove (like a slow cooker).  Added the second can of coconut milk after the hour.  Simple, flavorful, and delicious!  Served with basmati rice and fresh napa cabbage!

I substituted lite coconut milk for regular, and used instant jasmine rice instead of making my own, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Smelled and tasted delicious. I will be making this one again, although I may add a bit more curry to increase the spice level, and experiment adding different vegetables.

Finally!  I've been trying to match our favorite restaurant curries and this is the closest I've ever come!  It was really, really good!  We had some big eaters so I added a chicken breast and a cup more pineapple chunks.  I reduced the cooking time on the veggies; we don't like them to be too soft.  And I cut the sugar in half.  Next time, I'll use the Lite coco milk and omit the sugar.  The pineapple juice can be used as a sweetner if needed.  I also think I'll try sauteing (sp?) the curry paste as some suggested.  Very good!  Thanks!!!

Very good!  I used 2 tbsp of paste, some lemon zest and grated ginger, 2 chicken breasts, and only 1 can of coconut milk.  Will make this again for sure!  Made for fantastic leftovers as well.

Being cambodian (southeast asian) this dish did not taste authentic but rather something you would find at a 'chinese' take out.  I tried this recipe and smoked kaffir leaves (if you can find any) which is essential to asian cooking.  The combination of spices and veggie produced a very mild flavor.

If I could give this recipe a TEN, I would!!  It was quick, easy and 
D-E-E-E-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S!!! And it had just the right amount of heat to it.  My husband said it was BETTER than what we get in the Thai restaurant, in fact, he said that it was the BEST Thai dish he's ever had!!!  Even my kids loved it (and are they ever PICKY!!).  This recipe will become a staple in our house.  Thank you for this!!

Btw - I read some reviews that commented on the pineapple.  I DIDN'T add the pineapple, thinking it would make it too sweet and mushy.  I left it out but had it one hand for others to add to the dish as they were eating it.  It does add a nice complement to the spiciness, though!

We love, love, love this recipe!  I've followed some of the recommendations such as reducing the amount of coconut milk.  I've also substituted shrimp for the chicken.  My meat-and-potatoes husband always has seconds and my 9 year old can't wait for the next time this is served.  Thank you for sharing the recipe!

Fantastic recipe.  The curry and the pineapple complement each other well.  I use red curry paste that I buy at an Asian grocery store.  I like it spicy and so I add the whole amount of the curry paste.  However, when I cook for others, I only add two tablespoons and even then some people complain.

OMG This is THE BEST Thai Curry dish I've EVER eaten!!! Even my DH loved it, and he normally doesn't like curry or Asian food very much. The only think I did differently is the amount of spice. The red curry paste I have is pretty strong, and from past experiences I knew 1/4 cup would be way too much (I didn't even have that much anyway!) So I used 1 Tbs of curry paste. Since I wanted DH to eat it, I balanced the fish sause to 1 Tbs as well. I all of both peppers, so I will need to double the amount of chicken next time (there will be plenty of sauce for that.) I also added about 1 Tbs of corn starch to some 1/4 cup of chicken stock to thicken the sauce just a bit. I think it would also be good with baby corn!

Wow!!! This is one of the greatest recipes I've found on allrecipes, I love it! I tried adding some fresh gulf shrimp, deveined and deshelled, after the chicken but before the peppers. They were a nice addition. I was also more generous when it came to the onions, peppers, and pineapple, and next time I'm going to try adding sweet potatoes...

Wow.  This is awesome.  My husband was actually tilting back his plate to his mouth to drink the sauce.  Disgusting, but a sure sign that he loved it.  I only used 1 can of coconut milk, added a little reg. milk and some pineapple juice from the pineapples.  I also only used 1 tbs of chile paste, 1/8 c sugar, added carrots, and garlic.  This will definitely be made again in the very near future.

I just made this. BF loved it! However, I made some changes as suggested by other reviewers -- only used 2 tbsp of fish oil and only 1 can of coconut milk. While it was quite tasty, I feel that it's not as flavorful as I would have wanted it. I think next time, I am going to go all out and use 3 tbs of fish oil and 2 cans of coconut milk as suggested. Then I would let you all know how that went =)

This was really good. It is quite an experience for your tongue to have spicy, salty, and sweet. I used about 1.5 tsp of red curry paste because my husband I are kind of whimps when it comes to spiciness. I substituted pork for the chicken becuase that it what I had on hand. Turned out great! Don't think about cooking it without the pineapple b/c I think that added the most flavor.

I loved this recipe!  I did make a few changes - I used slightly less than 1/4 cup of curry paste and only 2tbs. fish sauce.  I also added bamboo shoots and water chestnuts as well as baby corn and an extra chicken breast.  Thank you so much for sharing this!

Excellent! I added carrots at the same time as the chicken. Only used 1 tbls. of curry--plenty! Added garlic salt to taste for a little more flavor.

Quite spicy if you follow the exact recipe. Definitely cut the curry paste in half. Other than that, everything is perfect! **If you're like me and cook for one or two, just change the serving size to three. I think it still ended up being 5 servings!

I thought this was really good.  I too added three chicken breasts instead of two and I used crushed pineapple instead of chunks. I could have standed for it to be a little more spicy though.  I will adjust that next time.

This recipe yields a lot of sauce which will most likely go to waste for me.

I did not add the veggies as I didn't have time to prepare them.  However, this dish turned out okay.  It was a bit bland until I added some soy sauce.  The soy sauce gave it a good depth of flavor.

After the soy sauce was added, it was quite yummy.

A++. My dear husband [DH] loves all things Thai, and this is no exception. I left out the bamboo shoots, but ADDED Julianne baby carrots and canned Asian style straw mushrooms. Also ADDED finely minced ginger root, FRESH diced pineapple, and topped with thinly sliced green onions and chopped fresh cilantro.  I used 3 chicken breasts instead of 2 [sauteed lightly before adding veggies], but used only 1 can of coconut milk. There was just enough fluid. I had red curry PASTE so ~1/4c was all I used, but it could have used more. Halved the rice recipe and added chicken broth instead of water to the rice to add flavor.  My modifications made 6+ hearty meals, plenty enough for seconds and four lunch leftovers for work this week. I definitely would make this again.

This is a great recipe that I use quite a bit.  I do recommend (as another user suggested) to whisk the curry and oil together before adding the chicken.  I also tend to use more curry then suggested.  For a quick dinner, I use canned "chinese vegetables", water chestnuts, baby carrots.  I don't add the sugar...I don't think it's needed due to the sweetness of the coconut milk and pineapple. I believe only ONE CAN of coconut milk is needed.  Two cans is way too much liquid.

Fantastic easy curry dish that tastes awesome!
I only used one can of coconut milk (you only need 1), no bamboo shoots (I didn't have any), and a whole red pepper, no green. I garnished with cilantro and basil. I also used hot curry paste which was pretty spicy. Great way to use overripe pineapple!

Loved it.  If you like your curries spicy, you might need some doctoring.  As for me, it was wonderful as is (well, except I took the advice of some other reviewers and cooked the curry paste in oil first, instead of just mixing it into the coconut milk).  This dish will be in regular rotation at our house.

Its a good recipe, but can be spiced up a little.  I cut the fish sauce in half and don't add the sugar.  The pineapple juice works just fine. I use two kaffir leaves (lime leaves) that I buy at the local farmer's market but you can also purchase at asian food stores. Add the leaves to the coconut sauce while the chicken is cooking.

this was very good. although not spicy at all, and i found it be greasy when i didn't add any oil.  maybe it was the curry paste i used.  i will definitely cook this again adding about 3 thai chili peppers should add the heat...then it will be perfect.

This is probably the best curry I've made and I have tried a lot of recipes.  I only used 1 can of coconut milk because I thought 2 was too much, but I wish I had used the 2 cans.  Will make again with 2 cans of coconut milk!

Awesome recipe.  Will definitely recommend it.  I substituted chicken for extra firm tofu.  We have vegetarians in the family.  2 cups of rice is WAY too much.  I'll try 1 cup next time.

Great recipe! For vegans: I used "Gardein chick'n scallops." I only used 1 can of coconut milk, doubled the amount of peppers and onions, also added 5 small potatoes, some peanut butter and tofutti, and cashew nuts.

Great recipe as is, but also with lots of room for modification, a lot of other vegetables work great with it as does simply taking some of them out.  Surprisingly kid friendly if you cut down on the curry paste just a little bit.  Another quick tip would be to save ~1/4-1/3 cup of the pineapple juice, stir in about a tbs of cornstarch and mix into the Curry right before adding the pineapple chunks to make it a little less runny.

I thought this dish was delicious but I think it was a bit too sweet. I made it on another occasion and omitted the sugar, added a couple cloves of garlic, some fresh squeezed lime and cilantro. I also increased red curry paste only b/c I like my Thai dishes to set me on fire!

This is a great and easy recipe!  Very quick to throw together.  I only used one can of low-fat coconut milk, but I still had to thicken it up a bit (2 Tbs corn starch/2 Tbs water).  I used Thai Kitchen's red curry paste and would definitely double the amount next time.

Delicious! I cooked the chicken first so it wouldn't take so long (I was starving and couldn't wait) and then added it to the milk mixture in the wok. And I only used one Tablespoon of curry paste and there was absolutely no heat/spicy hotness. Next time I'll use two tablespoons. SO good!

This was my first experience with Thai food and I have to say it was wonderful.  I didn't have the curry paste, so I used curry powder 2 t. and though it was probably very mild compared to the red curry paste.  It was soooo good.  I also used 4 chicken breast halves and the 2 cans of coconut milk.  I thickened the sauce with 2 T. of flour and 2 of water as suggested.  I'll definitely make this again and possibly add carrots and snow peas for variety.  I think it would be great with shrimp too!!

Delicious. We doubled the chicken, and used 1.5 times the amount of sauce -- there was plenty of sauce to go around. Instead of bell peppers, we put in some carrots and snow peas. The amount of food was just right for 5 hungry people.

This is really good and fairly easy. Maybe a little heavy on the pineapple..it should be a nice surprise and not needed in every bite. I used curry powder instead of paste, a couple tablespoons.

Excellent - didn't have any curry paste so used red curry powder and it still came out great!

I thought this recipe was great. A little hot for me, but my husband loved it. I used 2tsp of red curry paste instead of the 1/4cup. So I say start with a little and add more if needed. I also added some chopped cashews to this dish because I love the crunch they add. I will totally make this again.

Soooooo good!  Why go out for Thai when you can cook like this at home??  I changed it a little based on what I had in the pantry.  I used a tiny little red pepper and no green peppers.  I added a little can of water chestnuts with the bamboo shoots, threw in about a cup of peas and thickened the whole thing with a little cornstarch (used lite coconut milk so it was thinner than the regular).  YUM!!!  YUM!!!  YUM!!  Thanks for giving us an easy recipe to keep us home for good Thai!!

this recipe was delicious. However, it was not the least bit spicy. I used between 3 and 4 tbsp. of the thai kitchen red curry paste, which was completely insufficient. next time I may have to use the entire bottle.

I thought this recipe was great, and pretty easy too. I made a couple of changes: I used 3 chicken breast instead of 2. I used light coconut milk, and only used one can which I found to be plenty. I had concentrated curry paste on hand, and I only used 1 tbsp, but may add a little more next time depending how spicy I want it. Finally I had half a block of extra-firm tofu in the fridge, so I cut that up into small cubes and added it as well. You can probably just toss the chicken add veggies in at the same time to cook, so I'll do that next time.

This is really good but other than the coconut milk, sugar, fish sauce and the curry paste, I doubled everything. Looking over the recipe it just looked like there would be too much sauce. I also added some mushrooms. Turned out perfect. I love letting the sauce soak into the rice.

Very Tasty!  I used 3 TBSP of mild curry paste (concentrate) instead of 1/4 c, following the suggestions of others.  I used the entire red pepper and green pepper as well as a whole can of pineapple.  Next time, I will add more chicken as well.

Fabulous recipe!!!! Glad I read reviews though and cut curry paste down to 1 1/2 tablespoons.  Was still a little too warm for me but great for my boyfriend! I omitted the fish sauce, becasue i just didn't think it needed it. I used a little cornstartch and water to thicken at the end instead of cutting down the coconut milk, because I like a lot of sauce for over the rice.  Worked like a charm.  Was nice and thick and rich and flavorful!  Thank you so much for this great new favorite!!

Followed directions exactly but served with sticky rice.  Oh, and I used fresh pineapple - the recipe doesn't really specify either way.  This was SO good and tasted exactly like my favorite Thai restaurant dish.  Mine was super super spicy, and I used slightly less than the 1/4 cup of curry paste, which I ordered from a Thai import website.  Would probably use less next time but change nothing else.  Delicious!!

This was excellent.  I would have followed the directions perfectly, but I had a little trouble with one of my cans of coconut milk.  It was solid.  So, I added the equivalent in half & half.  I also got a bum can of bamboo shoots (go figure), so I used water chestnuts. I used 4 teaspoons of red curry paste, but it could have used one more.  Even with these unexpected changes, the dish was wonderful.  Definately a keeper!

I loved this recipe!  It reminds me of a recipe at the Cheesecake Factory.  Sometimes I make it with shrimp or peas instead of green peppers.  This was the best in a long time.

This recipe is so good, that this is my first time submitting a review of any of the dozens of recipes I've used on AllRecipes.

I added a third chicken breast, used lite coconut milk, and threw in 1/2 pound of shrimp during the last 10 minutes of cooking.

It was very spicy, but very good. It was my first time trying Thai food (I don't even like Thai food!), and it was a keeper.

Five stars for making my Thai food loving husband say "this one's a keeper"! This is only my second attempt at making Thai food at home, and I really enjoyed the sweet and spicy mix. I was a bit sheepish with the red curry paste this time thinking it might be to hot for me, but next time I will be more brave. Thanks for this great recipe!

This receipe is awesome!  I make it often now for my family who loves it.  I made a few changes to it like add 1 additional can of coconut milk to make more "juice".  I also use LITE coconut milk to cut the fat and calories and add a carrot and slices of onion for more veggies.  For a slight change from chicken you can use shrimp.  It's great no matter what!  Yum...

I'm from a rural area in Michigan and we only have one Thai restaurant.  This recipe is exactly like the great food we get there.  Thank you so much for sharing this...I'm sure this will be a regular in my home.

Used just a tablespoon of red paste curry and it tasted fantastic. I also used roasted red peppers you buy in a jar. This is now one of my favorites.

Tastes great if you cook the curry paste and chicken in oil before adding the coconut milk and other ingredients. I used a little less sugar.

Don't like super spicy food and didn't have paste so just used an oriental curry powder. Worked well and still tasted delicious despite the huge difference between pastes and powders.

This turned out amazing.  I did take some of the advice below: I used a bit of oil to sauté the curry paste. I eliminated the sugar by using the pineapple juice. And I also added mushrooms, celery and carrot slices because I had lots available. Thanks for all the suggestions and to 'nellydesign' , thanks for the great recipe.

Very tasty. I made some changes - some by accident, some by design. We are vegetarians so I substituted 4 pieces of soy chicken and 1 cube of vegetarian chicken stock for the chicken. I substituted soy sauce for the fish sauce. I used a whole red pepper and a whole yellow pepper instead of half and I added a handful of chopped peanuts and some garlic. I ran out of red curry paste so used half Pad Thai paste. It still tasted great. I also stir-fried all of the vegetables in advance before adding the rest of the ingredients. I let it simmer for about 1/2 hour then served on Basmati rice. I did find it a bit thin so next time I will add 1 T of corn starch to thicken it up.

As this recipe stands...my family rates it a Four Star.  With our personal adjustments, we give it a five star.  My kids loved it and want me to make it again.

I used just curry powder (about 2 tbsp), a tablespoon or so of asian chili garlic sauce, 1 can coconut milk, one can of chicken broth, chicken, fish sauce, 2 tbsp. sugar, 2 carrots-julienned, red and green bell pepper, onion and pineapple.

I sauteed the veggies, then set aside.  Then I cooked the chicken, combined all ingredients and simmered for 15-20 minutes.

My children requested that I put a cubed sweet potato in it next time and no pineapple.

I think this would be a good crockpot dish.  Just combine all of the above ingredients and cook 6-8 hours.  I imagine the flavors would come together nicely.

Very good! A favourite restaurant used to have a pineapple chicken curry pasta recipe but they stopped making it and I've been looking for something similar ever since. This is very close! Had to make a few changes though. Did what another reviewer suggested and sauteed the curry and then added the chicken. I did have to thicken it a bit in the end and I added some cilantro, I also made penne instead of rice. This will be a regular in my house!

Using a oriental Curry in this dish will be best way to go for most people... flavor is more broad and pleasant, heat  is less. Using Asian onions will also be a different flavor as well... and most people that don't like curry as much, could enjoy it.

Absolutely delicious - although I didnt add fish sauce, sugar (its sweet enough with the coconut milk and bell peppers) or the bamboo shoots or the pineapple! :) In saying all that, it was perfect. I think I probably only cooked the veg for 5 mins as the chicken was perfectly cooked at that stage and I do like crunchy veg .. I added juice of half a lime and some fresh coriander. Really could not have been better ... ooh added a carrot (in strips) also ... mmmmmmm.

This recipe was delicious! I fried my curry paste as recommend in the reviews and swapped the chicken out for shrimp and everyone in my house loved it. I used the full 1/4 cup of red curry too and I thought it was delightfully spicy!

Pretty good. I agree about not adding as much sugar as in this recipe. However the previous comment about more than one tablespoon of already made red curry paste from the store, depends on the brand name. You don't want to use more than a tablespoon of Mae Ploy brand for instance, but up to a third of cup of Maesri brand is just fine.

Followed the recipe as written except that I only used 2 Tablespoons of Thai Kitchen's red curry paste and mixed a couple of tablespoons of the sauce with 3 teaspoons of cornstarch and then add it back to the pan.  I've made it in the past without doing this, but prefer a thicker sauce.  Once it's all done, I take out the portion for my son who does not like spicy food (I made it before with the full 1/4 cup and he couldn't eat it). Then I add more curry paste to our personal preference.

Wow - so tasty!  Also followed the Screaming Chef's recommendation to a degree, except I did not have curry paste!  So I added curry powder to the oil, heating it prior to adding the chicken.  Ended up adding curry several times throughout the cooking process, but I have discovered that I really like the flavor of curry!  Used only about 1/2 to 2/3 can of light coconut milk, still needed to add cornstarch to thicken at the end.  Added more veggies as well - sliced carrots, peas, and diced red and green onions.  Added same veggies and garlic to the jasmine rice in addition to the red pepper.  Deleted the sugar; wished I had used pineapple tidbits vs chunks - next time for sure!  My wife and I really enjoyed this!

Thanks Nelly for the wonderful recipe. However, I made few variations to it by adding mushrooms, zucchini and spring onions instead of bamboo shoots.  It turned out very well and the family loved the coco nutty taste.

Very delicious! I stir fried the vegetables, curry and chicken for a 5 mins then added to the rest of the mixture, cooked it for another 1-2 minutes until it came to a boil. The long cooking time isn't necessary.

Yum-O!!! I have 5 kids (15 to 8yrs) and all but one loved!  I followed the recipe mostly...only changes were I used lite coconut milk & added a bag of fresh spinach along with the pineapple at the end.  De-Lish addition; will add more red curry paste next time, not spicy enough for us -  Served with brown rice made with sodium free chicken stock instead of jasmine rice & a big fresh salad consisting of iceburg lettuce, green onions, cucumbers, tomatoes, cilantro & toasted chopped peanuts tossed with homemade dressing of garlic, ginger, lime juice, peanut butter, EVOO & cider vinegar - will definately make again!!!

This is an awesome dish that even met my husband's lofty standards ;-). I substituted water chestnuts for the bamboo shoots and added a handful of peanuts. I also substituted oyster sauce for the fish sauce...this will become part of our repertoire for easy, delicious dinner dishes.

Really nice flavor combination, and it tasted even better the next day. I followed the previous reviewers' advice and added snow peas and tomatoes to the curry when it was almost done. Next time I will up the amount of curry (I used red curry paste).

I really liked it but my kids thought it was way too hot.  I used 2T red curry paste from an Asian market and it was really spicy.  Next time I make it I will only use 1-2 tsp of the red curry and then use curry powder for seasoning.  Also it was a little too sweet, next time I will cut the sugar in half.  I too used only 1 can of coconut milk, 2 cans of diced tomatoes, 1 little can of tomato paste, and 2 small cans of tomato sauce.  I thought the consistency was perfect.

Very good curry and easy to make! I'll definitely make it again, but I think I'll use less fish sauce as it kind of overpowered the dish a little.

Tastes just like at restaurants. I've tried several other thai chicken dishes and this is the best & simplest.  I only used 1 can of coconut milk and omitted the pineapple.  I used a bag of tri-colored frozen bell peppers from Trader Joe's and a can of bamboo shoots. It was excellent.

A nice and simple dish. I used yellow curry powder since that is what I had on hand. I agree with other reviewers that the vegetables do not need to be cooked for that long.

The recipe as is, is just ok and too sweet.  I made it for the second time tonight with these changes and it was almost perfect.  I meant to leave out the sugar but forgot, so I added 1 1/2 TBSP White Vinegar to help reduce the sweetness.  I reduced the fish sauce down to 1 1/2 -2 TBSP and added 3 TBSP Chili Paste and 4 -6 Bay Leaves.  Next time I would like to try adding a couple Lime Leaves.

This came out very nice.  I only had one can of coconut milk so I just went with it and added about 1/2 cup of angel flake coconut.  The flavors were perfect.  It seemed like it was plenty "wet" so I am curious to see what will happen with a whole nother can of coconut milk.  The picture is nothing like what I had show up on the plate.  The Red Curry Paste turned the milk a very nice dark cream color so the whole plate looked VERY indian curry colored, not the blah white of the pic...

This dish is wonderful!  As other readers have said, one can of coconut milk is plenty.  Also, this was a little salty for my taste, so next time, I'll probably use about half as much fish sauce.  I added some snap peas and water chestnuts for a nice contrasting texture...  I'll definitely make this again.

Made it last night and it was great  - today reheated - even though hotter, was even better.  Grapes are another great fruit for this dish.  Did it with Green curry paste (buy at the Asian Market and not the grocery store if you can - much cheaper).

Made this last night for guests and everyone loved it! It tastes autentically Thai and yet was simple to make. I had no bamboo shoots and so substituted Bean sprouts and they worked fine. I made extra rice as well to finish up all the yummy sauce. =)

A simple recipe - which is what I needed to introduce myself to Thai cooking. Halved it, and easily got 4 servings (but needed extra rice).

I was very impressed with this recipe! It was the closest thing I found to a pineapple curry I had at a restaurant :) I wouldn't change a thing!

Great recipe.  If you can't find red curry paste, buy the red thai curry sauce in the glass jar pre-made, and omit the coconut milk, fish sauce, and sugar.  It won't be the same but it will be darn close and cheaper.

I love this recipe. I used green curry instead of red, added water chestnuts, sesame chili oil(which maked it hotter), minced ginger, and hot mustard. I deleted the peppers and doubled the pineapple. THis is my husbands favorite!

This was awesome!  I added some crushed thai chili powder to heat it up.  I also took the advice of a Thai gal and added a can of tomato paste to give it a better color.  I found the paste also made the sauce a perfect consistency.  I cooked this on medium for about 45 minutes to have the chicken absorb more of the flavor.  5 Star recipe!

Excellent recipe, though pretty heavy on the coconut milk. Next time I'll try 1 can lite milk and 1 can regular to thin it down

Wow, this was great - I followed others' suggestions and it was perfect.  I only used 1 can of coconut milk, and once it was simmering in the pan, I added a slurry of 1 Tbsp. cornstarch and 1 Tbsp water to thicken the sauce.  Used 2 1/2 chicken breasts (3 would be fine), 2 Tbsp. fish sauce and only cooked the vegetables for 3 minutes and it was DELICIOUS.  Next time I might use 1/2 cup of pineapple instead.  Thanks for the recipe!

The flavors in this dish work really nicely together. The only problem I had with it was the bamboo shoots. I don't know if it's the batch I got, because I have never used them before, but yikes! They smelled rotten and it just sort of ruined the whole dish for me. Everything else about it is wonderful. I'll probably make it again in the future, only leaving out the bamboo shoots, just to be safe!

This was good, it just needs a little extra and I guess I'm not sure quite yet what that 'something' is. Sushi rice is also a good option if you don't have or can't find Jasmine. They have the same sticky texture. You could probably get by with one can of coconut milk if you want to reduce the caloric count of this meal. If it needs extra fluid add some wine, broth or water. I will make this again and add some sweet chili sauce to it! Thanks for the recipe!

This was amazing!  I managed to mess up my rice (hand me down rice maker with no instruction booklet...), but still enjoyed a bowl of just plain curry...I think that speaks volumes for how good this is!  Leftovers were great too.  I ignored proportions on chicken and veggies and just added as much as I wanted for my tastes.  I will definitely be making this again.

my husband and i have been wanting a pineapple curry recipe for awhile now, this came close to our favorite back in Pittsburgh, PA.  I used about 4 TBSP of red curry paste and only 1 TBSP of fish sauce, left out the sugar and added the pineapple juice and some cornstarch.  It needed some chili oil for the heat we like, but it was great.  Added more fresh veggies.  yum!

This recipe is very good. Red curry is one of my favorite things to get when I go out for Thai food, so now this is one of my favorite dishes to make at home. I used about 1.5 tablespoons of red curry paste, as the kind I had was very condensed. The only things I did differently were using only 1 red bell pepper. I like red better and it saved me money to use 1 whole pepper instead of half of two. I also did not add fish sauce because I have been unable to find any at my grocery store. Very delicious and creamy with the right amount of heat. My husband loves it as well.

This was excellent.  I used bean sprouts instead of bamboo shoots.  I gave the recipe to a co-worker who also thought this was "restaurant" quality.  She's been sharing with everyone.

This was very good.  For me, it was important that I used quality coconut milk, such as "A Taste of Thai" coconut milk.  Also, I used the curry from the Asian market, for authenticity.  I also garnished my dish with cilantro and lime juice.  That made the dish excellent!  Thank you for sharing the recipe.

This was a great way to get my boyfriend eating pinapple. We thought that this recipe was fantastic. I am a beginner cook and trying to get better. I don't get a lot of "that was a GREAT dinner, baby", but I followed the recipe to a tee and got complimented on this dish!

Not as spicy as I would have liked it to be but a good base recipe for me to experiment with. I didn't have any trouble with the sauce thickness by using only 1 can of coconut milk and really boiling it for the full time stated in the recipe.

i changed a few things... it was very very delicious!  first of all, i used sliced water chestnuts instead of bamboo shoots cos that is what i had on hand and i am not a huge fan of bamboo anyway.  secondly, only one can of coconut milk and i did thicken it the last 5 or 7 minutes.  i didn't want to use the pineapple chunks so i used about 3/4 cup of pineapple juice and about 2 tbsp of cornstarch to thicken the juice. added all to the curry mix and let it simmer the last 5 to 10 minutes.  mmmm.  i also left out the peppers since we are allergic to them.  as for the red curry paste, i have to agree...i got mine at the local grocery (i live in hawaii and the asian choices are many) so i only used about 1.5 tbsp of the red curry paste.  it was plenty.  i may add another 1/2 tbsp next time i make this dish just to add a little fire to the dish.  also, i served it with fried rice rather than white, because that is what my family wanted.  this was as good as the yellow chicken curry i had at a local thai place in kona.  and.... cheaper!  woo hoo!

I didn't exactly follow the recipe, but with the member reviews it was definitely a  5! I made(good for 2 healthy servings)it with 1 can coconut milk and 2 tsp. green curry paste,followed review about mixing curry with vegetable oil first. Used shrimp and ~6 oz. frozen vegetables, used member advice to thicken (2 tbs. flour with 2 tbs. water- mix in cup and then add to sauce at end if not thick enough for you)and added pineapple at very end! Plan on adding a little garlic, basil, and fish sauce next time- Then it just might be perfection!

I am shocked.  Based on all the glowing reviews PLUS the fact that I LOVE Thai food, I thought I would love this.  Nope. I found it okay at best.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I had no green pepper so I substituted carrot. I used the concentrated red curry paste so I used only 1-2 tsp.  Oh, and I served it over brown rice instead of jasmine.

I just don't understand what all the fuss was about. It seemed to be missing something.  Like a previous poster said, I think there was too much pineapple.  8 oz. would have been plenty (and I love pineapple too!).

I absolutely love this recipe. I was a bit hesitant to try a Thai recipe because I just knew it wouldnt turn out like it does at the restraunts- I was wrong! If I hadnt of made this myself I wouldnt be able to tell the homemade from what I order at my favorite Thai place.

Followed the recipe without modification.  It turned out beautifully. I'm Thai and my husband is grossed out by the idea of "fish sauce." I always tell him that I didn't use it. But it is SO IMPORTANT to include it. It doesn't work without it.

I was a little nervous to try this recipe, since I've only had Thai food a couple of times, and have never attempted to make it.  I am SO glad that I made the effort!  Thank goodness I read the reviews and knew to scale back on the curry (I used Thai Kitchen's red curry paste).  I used 2 tsp and it was just right.  I used 3 chicken breasts and replaced the bamboo shoots with carrots.  I replaced one can of regular coconut milk with "light" coconut milk, just to save a little fat... and the flavor didn't suffer at all.  My husband was totally impressed and I overheard him bragging to his friends about the "amazing" dinner.  It is a must try!  I'll definitely make it again.

This is an awesome recipe. I did make a few changes. I substituted Tandoori paste for red curry paste because that’s all I had on hand and due to some of the other reviews I decided to eliminated the fish sauce altogether. I don’t like bamboo shots so I replaced them with extra chicken and peppers and used 2 Tbsp of Cornstarch to thicken the sauce.  I served it over Penne noodles.  Yummy!

I am an absolutely horrible cook, so I was hesitant to even try out this recipe when my husband hinted to me that he's been craving a good Thai curry dish!  This recipe is outstanding!  I couldn't find red bell peppers at the supermarket, so I ended up just using a whole green bell pepper.  I would, however, recommend a medium-hot curry paste, since the 1/4 cup I used of mild never really had any zest to it.  I also used boneless, skinless, chicken THIGHS rather than breasts since they're more savory that way.  Otherwise, I (along with my very full but satisfied husband) am very pleased with the turnout!

Wow! This tastes like a Thai dish that I've ordered at a restaurant.  Very easy and delicious.  Though I did have to modify the amount of chili paste.

Easy to make. Good flavor. The company enjoyed it. But not the best curry I've ever had, so I can only give it four stars. Definitely heed the advice of other reviewers about what type of curry paste you're using.

This was great. I made only 2 changes when I made it. I used 3 skinless boneless chicken breasts (but mine may have been smaller. I did not have jasmine rice so I used basmati.

I turned out great. I'll try it with the Jasmine rice next time.

I, too, was looking to recreate my favorite dish from a local Thai restaurant - and this is very close to it!  Upon the advice of previous reviewers, I went with 1 tsp (not 1/4 cup) of Thai red curry paste, then added more to taste - it probably ended up being about 2.5 tsp total in the end.  You can always mix more paste in with your individual serving once it's done, so I think 1.5 tsp is a good place to start if you're hesitant.  Anyhow I substituted 1 green pepper for the 1/2 green 1/2 red (to save $), and omitted the onion as it seemed so small an amount that I thought it would not be necessary.  The pepper substitution was fine, but next time I'll definitely spring for the 1/4 onion to add flavor.  I used fresh pineapple which was SO wonderful and provided leftovers for a yummy dessert.  Also, when I was letting the curry cook in the wok, I had it covered at first, but soon decided to cook it open to cook off some water (I'm new at this whole cooking thing) to make it thicker, which was a good idea.  I basically let it cook until it was the consistency I wanted. :)  Thanks, will make again!

Like the submitter of this recipe, I had been trying to recreate a dish from my local Thai restaurant.  And this one is it!!  I used all red peppers instead of mixing with green.  If you want to make this dish even easier...substitute a can of chicken chunks and it still works great.

this is almost exactly like my favorite thai dish from the thai house in orlando called "crazy meat".  it can be made with chicken, pork, beef, shrimp, tofu or just plain veggies.  i reccomend scaling this recipie down to 3 servings, but then adding a full can of bamboo shoots, 8oz can of pineapple, and full bell peppers/onion.  i also added unsliced mushrooms and next time will add thin cut carrots.  i like this dish REALLY spicy, so i added some red curry powder to taste.  cut your meat into super thin strips.  i like to use the soupy remains to pour over rice like a rice soup...the soupier the better.  id say this made about 6 large servings after i scaled to 3.

I couldn't agree with everyone else more! I used concentrated curry paste, so I only needed about 2 tbps. I omitted the peppers, and added button mushrooms, potatoes and the bamboo shoots. The taste, texture and spiciness is perfect! I will likely add extra chicken next time, or even try tofu. YUMMMMY.

I just made this recipe tonight, it was an absolute hit with my husband and his friends.  I followed the recipe very closely, but used 3 tbs of curry, big can of bamboo shoots, mushrooms and crushed pinneapple since I forgot to get the chunk kind.  I had no trouble with too much spiciness or fishy smell.
Will definitely make it again, it was quick, easy and simple to follow.  
Thanks to whoever submited it.

I've never tried Thai before, and this came out amazingly well.  As previous posters have suggested, I used about 2 tbsp of curry paste.  I also cut down the coconut milk to about 19 oz (1.5 cans) -- not a fan of coconut soup.

I made it a week ago and my wife is already asking for it again.  Great recipe; easy to follow; and most ingredients are easy to come by (at least in CA.)

I am going to give this five stars because my boyfriend said it's the best thing I have ever made, and it's my fault it didn't turn out exactly how I expected.

I made a couple of minor changes. I used baby corn cobs, and asparagus, and red pepper only (all I had).  I also used the low calorie coconut milk, which is what caused the problem.  I didn't realize that low cal coconut milk is just a tiny bit of coconut milk and loads of water.  So the sauce didn't have the real rich taste that I was expecting.  I also followed others advice and reduced the amount of fish sauce.  I think next time I am going to make the recipe exactly as called for (except for maybe the fish sauce because that stuff is strong) and then play with it from there.

Otherwise it was really good, and I am going to make it again. This was my first experiment with thai food, and all things considering it went turned out better then I expected.

thanks for the recipe!

Both of us really liked this recipe.  It wasn't too spicy at all, if anything it wasn't spicy enough!
I made a few tiny changes:
I added a teaspoon of lime juice and a tablespoon of cornstarch just to thicken the sauce up a little.

I'll definately be making this one again!

This is a very simple recipe to make and it can be used for a group of people at a gathering.  It is attractive and has a nice, subtle taste.  I was disappointed that the curry taste did not come through in the quantity called for in the recipe but that is simple enough- just add more!  All in all, a good recipe.

Made this lots of times and always love it. I like chicken thighs for this recipe, also use fresh pineapple, kafir lime leaves. Don’t skip on the fish sauce, it makes this dish so tasty when balanced with some raw sugar and fresh lime.

Need to fry the curry paste in oil FIRST, only use 1/8C sugar instead of a 1/4C.

Used 1 package of chicken breasts (2), 1 can of bamboo, and probably 2 TB of curry paste- could increase this a bit.  Also used nearly a whole small container of fresh pineapple.  We LOVED this

I've tried multiple Thai curry dishes from this website and this is easiest and always turns out awesome for me. I only use 1TB of concentrated curry paste, heated in sesame oil with garlic (2 cloves minced) and onions. I then add the cubed chicken (seasoned with salt and pepper) and cook until halfway done before adding the milk. The one change I've made that I feel takes this dish to another level is that I empty the can of coconut milk into the pot, then I fill half of the can with heavy cream, then the rest with regular milk and add this to the pot. It makes the curry so much more rich! Sometimes I do all fish sauce and sometimes I replace the 3rd TB of fish sauce with soy sauce. I add whatever veggies I have on hand at the time, usually from a bag of frozen stir fry veggies that I cook separately. I just add the whole can of pineapples drained. This is my go-to curry recipe. I have made it countless times and will never use another!

You could prep all veggies and protein the night before. That would make this more family friendly from a time perspective. 
It didn't thicken up as much as I thought but I could have cooked the coconut milk longer in step 2 before I added veggies. Family loves it.

Quick and fantastically delicious.  Tasted as I went along, making some tweaks.  Added half the curry paste to some hot oil first, then whisked in milk.  Proceeded adding rest of paste until the heat was just right for me.  Slowly added sugar till it was right.  Had frozen pineapple so used that with great results-put in before 1st 15 minutes.  Switched chicken for pan-fried tofu which I added after the 1st 15 minutes.  Julienned the bamboo shoots.  Needed a bit more fish sauce for salt.  Don't like onions or green belles so just used red belles.  Will definitely be making this again!

I am very average when it comes to how much spice I like, so it's not like I generally like things extra spicy. But I made it as written (except I used all red pepper instead of half green), and it was SUPER bland. I actually went back to the jar of "red curry paste" to make sure that I hadn't bought the wrong thing (I hadn't)*. I ended up doubling the curry paste in order to give it a little spice. I think I might try again another time, using the "saute curry paste with oil" method other reviewers have mentioned, to see if that "wakes up" the curry flavor. As written, it lacked almost all spice.
*In the end, I ended up using the entire 4 oz. jar of "Thai Kitchen Red Curry Paste."

Loved it! Didn't have any peppers on hand so made it without them. But I loved this! Not too spicy at all. The coconut milk really tames it down.

Lacking a bit in flavor. I'm not sure what it needed more of but I expected a more complex flavor like at the restaurants.  I'll keep searching for a different recipe

Recipe is awesome and easy to make - the only thing I would say is DO NOT use 3 tbsp of fish sauce. I had to spend another 30 mins diluting it with more curry paste, spicy sauces, etc. It will make it smell awful and definitely less enjoyable. Next time I'll only use 1 tbsp fish sauce as some other reviews stated as well. 
Also putting in some salt or soy sauce may help offset the sweetness, we had to put some Maggi's hot sauce in to add some flavor.

Mmmmm, good! As others did, I sautéed the curry paste in oil before adding the coconut milk to bring out the favor. I cooked the peppers and onion first for a few minutes then added the chicken. Thinly sliced boneless  skinless chicken breast does not take long to cook. I added it and cooked a bit longer, about 10 minutes total cooking time. I was hesitant to add the pineapple to the dish so we added it afterwards, and hubby liked that better since the sauce is so tasty without it. Plenty of sauce, love that. Thanks for sharing!

This is my wife's favorite dish at a Thai restaurant.  The only thing I added was a touch of hot sauce to add a little zip, but the recipe is just like her fave.  A LOT cheaper than going out!!  Thanks.

My husband and I made this recipe for our friends last night. We followed the amounts of ingredients and cooking time perfectly, TO THE EXCEPTION of the fish sauce. We only used 2 Tablespoons rather than 3 Tablespoons. The amount of food was definitely enough for 4 people with leftovers!
This recipe has the perfect amount of spiciness to it. I found that I did have to add some soy sauce while eating it, which would explain why the recipe calls for 3 Tablespoons of fish sauce, but at the time, we felt like the recipe didn't need that much of it. Just go with your gut. :)
We served the curry in pineapple bowls which added to the fun of our double date. This recipe was a huge success and we'll definitely make it again. *Note: we did not have a wok. We used a deep skillet pan and it worked just fine.

We halved the recipe and it was good, but not great. It was not spicy at all (in spite of using red curry paste) and was on the fishy side. We'll try it again but alter a bit in the hope of getting something more spicy.

I omitted fish sauce due to preference and bamboo shoots due to lack of availability (used hearts of palm instead).  I sautéed curry paste first per reviews, otherwise followed recipe as written.  Turned out delicious!!

Great recipe for hiding (or using up) veggies (or go completely vegetarian) -- I cooked up red and yellow peppers, frozen green beans, substituted carrots for the bamboo shoots (because I didn't want to run to the store to pick some up).  BEST TRADE: Trade the jasmine rice for black wild rice. WOW. You'll be AMAZED at the stunning color on the plate and wonderful texture!

Very nice mild curry.  Added broccoli and used 2 T of sucanat rather than white sugar.  It was plenty sweet for us, next time I'll cut it to 1 T.

I've been using this recipe for awhile and as-written it's okay, but not wonderful so I've made some alterations that have improved the recipe to my liking:  I use one reader's suggestion and saute the curry paste in a little veg oil to enhance the curry flavors - it works.  Add the chicken and saute till about half done.  Then I add about a cup of chicken broth and if I'm in the mood for something really spicy I also add Thai chili pepper flakes.  I leave the coconut milk separated (don't shake the can before opening) and skim off the most of the solids to add to the simmering chicken mixture with the other ingredients. Whisk what's left in the can till smooth and add to the the recipe just before the pineapple goes in. This trick helps prevent the coconut milk "breaking" and makes the sauce much smoother.  Yummy!

I've had a version of this which was amazing and when I attempted it myself it was definitely lacking some flavour. Will have a go at this again.

Good basic recipe. I found the pineapple didn't really add much flavor or complexity. Next time, will add kaffir lime leaves for some zest and add cherry tomato halves instead of the pineapple. I also didn't find the recipe as is to be at all spicy but that's just personal taste.

I loved it.  Nice heat without being too much.  My family didn't care for it but they are wimps and don't like Thai food.  Good because I can take the leftovers for lunch.  I will use the sauce recipe (coconut milk/fish sauce/cury paste) to make with any number of meat/veggie combinations and I am confident that they will all be delicious.  For a nice presentation I would serve with garnishes of cilantro, chopped peanuts and lime wedges.

FIRST TIME: Reduce the sugar by 1/3 & add ground red pepper and a 1 1/2 tsp chicken bouillon. Omit pineapple as its too sweet.

SECOND TIME: Only added 1 tbsp sugar, 2 tsp chicken bouillon but added pineapple this time. Delicious!

WELL DONE. I have been trying to nail my favorite curry dish too, and you got it PERFECTLY! The dish I love has tomatoes instead of onions so that is what I use. It's phenomenal. The main things I missed on my previous tries were the fish sauce and the sugar. I was afraid to use fish sauce, but it is definitely one of the main factors. I am going to stock up on coconut milk and curry paste so that I can make this all the time.... It's mouth watering. Great job.

Absolutely delicious curry recipe!  It rivals any Thai food that I've had...and I've had a lot!  Sometimes I add a bit more curry paste to add some spice, or some extra pineapple for some extra sweetness, but other than that it's pretty perfect!

Delicious!  And really easy.  Followed recipe as written except I don't like bamboo shoots so I skipped those, and used an entire green and red pepper for some extra veggies.  Used a skillet instead of a wok and it worked just fine.  It was a little too spicy for me, so I put a splash of pineapple juice in the sauce and it balanced it out well.  Definitely a keeper!

This recipe tastes just like the curry we get at our local thai place. I have even replaced the chicken for some shrimp and that was just as tasty. I can't wait to go back for seconds, if there is any.

Maybe I did this wrong, but I didn't think the pineapple matches well with the curry paste at all. Both are sweet to an extent, but in different ways. I used a fresh pineapple. Maybe that played a part in it. I think if I were to try again, I would not use the sugar at all. This recipe without the pineapple, however, is really good.

Also, when I remade this recipe (sans pineapple), it was very good. However, I highly recommend people follow the advice given by the reviewer THE_SCREAMING_CHEF. I noticed a quite distinct improvement when sauteing the paste and chicken first.

With several tries and much modification I've been able to make this recipe delicious. I put in about 1/2 the sugar, and twice the curry paste. This recipe is a good starting point.

This was a great dish and easy to make. Just a few things I ran into to think about. 
If you don't typically cook thai food, or chinese, the upfront cost of some of the supplies makes the dish seem to be rather expensive, but the ingredients should last a while.
Also I'm not sure about the cook times on there. I accidentally put all the ingredients in at once, and the chicken was cooked perfectly after only 12min of boiling.

All in all It's a great way to get into cooking with curry!

This recipe was quite delicious.  I, however, like my thai dishes to be a bit spicier.  I would probably almost double the amount of red curry paste.  Also, I substituted green pepper with snow peas....Delice!!!

We didn't care for this, but I didn't have all the right ingredients either.  I couldn't find curry paste or bamboo shoots and my grocery store, so I made a paste from curry powder, garlic, cayenne, a squirt of lime juice, a pinch of brown sugar, onion powder, and coconut milk.  I subbed bean sprouts for the bamboo.  It was pretty bland tasting, but maybe if I had the right ingredients it would have been better.

Great recipe, with some tweaks.  As suggested, I only used 1 can of coconut milk and I added the two tbs flour/water combination at the end.  Instead of curry paste, I used about 3 tbs yellow curry powder.  I also added 1/3 cup of raisins when I added the veggies.  This was fantastic and one of my top five ultimate recipes!

I wasn't quite sure how this would taste, but it was sooo good. I didn't have fish sauce so I used a tbls of soy sauce. I was hoping it would be spicier, next time I will add red pepper flakes. Great recipe, thanks.

Wow. I loved this recipe. I have never made curry before. My husband said it was restaurant quality. I used only one tablespoon fish sauce based on other reviews which seemed fine. I used two tablespoons red curry. My husband and I love things really spicy so I will probably add another tablespoon next time. I also used half lowfat coconut milk. The jasmine rice was a real find. The rice is delicious!

This was my very 1st time making curry and it turned out awesome! I followed some of the recommended tips, though. I ended up adding about a tbs of baking powder/water mixture to help thicken the sauce. Also, for next time I would cut the fish sauce amount in half. I had a hard time getting past the smell when I put it in the dish and then could smell/taste it throughout the entire dinner. I think I might add julienned carrots and some broccoli next time, too. :o)

Very good! Loved this and so did my boyfriend!!!  My Safeway didn't sell red curry paste so substituted pineapple salsa instead but still worked out great. Didn't exactly love the bamboo shoots and added carrots the second time we had it. Great, easy recipe though. Definitely would recommend this to anyone.

I loved this! It tasted just like the restaurant. I halved the recipe for me and my husband. The only thing I did different was that I pounded the chicken breast thin and then cut it into strips, because that is what they did at the restaurant I saw this at.  I used Brown Basmati rice to make it somewhat-healthy. Thanks so much for this recipe!! I was craving this for DAYS.

I didn't follow the direction completely but it still turned out well. I only used 1 can of coconut milk (I never cooked with it before and my hubby wasn't too excited about it), about 3/5 of S&B Golden Curry package(couldn't find red curry paste), and 2.5 tablespoons of fish sauce. I thought it turned out a little too sweet, and would probably omit sugar next time. Pineapple would help to sweeten the curry anyway. I would definitely amp up the amount of curry too since I prefer it to be more spicy!

This is good. I added one can of chicken broth to increase amount of sauce and to make it more like a thick soup.  I baked the chicken first and substited brown sugar for the white sugar.

Ahhh, my tastebuds are rejoicing! This was amazing, and tasted just like the curry I get at our local Thai favorite. For those that like to freeze things, this freezes and reheats beautifully. I do it in individual portions and heat one up for lunch. I followed the ingredients exactly, but did it in a regular saucepan. I did not find the wok necessary. The 1/4 cup of red curry paste was just the right amount of heat, in my opinion, and I don't like things too spicy. I was nervous about that much fish sauce, but it also was perfect. Delicious! Thank you so much for the amazing recipe! For those that like to freeze things, this freezes and reheats beautifully. I do it in individual portions and heat one up for lunch.

We cooked it exactly as the recipe recommended, and it was a hit!  Everyone really enjoyed it, even the kids.  And as the other reviewers noted, use less curry if you aren't a fan of spicy food.

this was excellent!  my family loved it!  i used probably 1/3 cup of the red curry paste which made it just a little too spicy.  we like spicy but this was a little much.  i'll stick with 1/4 cup next time.

This dish was very good. The only extra ingredient I put in was about 2 tsp of chopped ginger. I started the curry with 2 T of the red curry paste. We eventually put in the whole 4 oz jar of paste. The flavors were very nice, they were just a little too mild for our taste. Next time I make this I plan on putting in a few tablespoons of red chili paste or Thai chili sauce. I will probably try that within the next week or two. Thanks for the recipe!

The curry was tasty. Make sure you have enough rice. I saw a few reviews said the sauce is too thin and the taste is blend. So I made a few changes. I marinate the chicken with oil, salt, soy sauce, and sugar for about 15 minutes. I first sautee the chicken and add in the veggies and curry paste. Then add the coconut milk. When it simmers, I added fish sauce, sugar, salt and pinapple chunks. I left out water so that the sauce is thicker and more rich. The trick to bring out the curry flavor is the fish sauce and sugar. I also add a little bit of salt because my fish sauce is not salty enough. Make sure you taste it and see if more fish sauce, sugar, or salt is needed. Will make this again. Thanks.

I, too, followed the advise of other reviewers and tweaked this a bit to my tastes.  I used 1 can of coconut milk, 1 Tbs of fish sauce and 2.5 Tbs of red curry paste (although will probably amp that up a bit next time).  I left out the sugar all together and added some ginger and think maybe will add some garlic to the recipe next time as well.  I also added baby carrots and baby corn and substituted the bamboo shoots with water chestnuts.  I cut down on the pineapple and it was a perfect little surprise in the dish.  I love love love curry and this recipe did not let me down.  Thanks for sharing!!

I was really underwhelmed by this dish, it turned out spicy without much of any other flavor, and especially not the deep, savory flavor that should be in a curry. As other reviews suggested, I only used 1 can of light coconut milk and 1 T flour + 1 T water to thicken it. Used Taste of Thai panang curry paste. I even added 1T of soy sauce to the sauce while it was cooking b/c I didn't have any fish sauce. Added a whole onion, red pepper and some frozen broccoli, carrots & cauliflower. I even used fresh (not canned) pineapple, thinking that would help. The sauce consistency was OK, I guess, but the flavor was so blah we ended up sprinkling curry powder and extra soy sauce on top just to make it palatable. I might as well have just boiled some chicken and served it over rice, it was about that flavorful.  The Curried Coconut Chicken recipe on this site is a thousand times better, and I think the techniques used in that recipe(sauteeing the curry spices to make them more flavorful, sauteeing (not boiling) the chicken, etc.) are what is missing from this one.  Even though I didn't follow the recipe exactly, I can't imagine this getting much better even if I did. Not going to try this one again.

I've made a number of curry recipes and this was fantastic. I was really surprised at the outcome based on the simple ingredients involved. I think that I was missing the fish sauce and sugar in the other recipes. I subbed potatoes for the chicken and everything turned out great. Just the right amount of heat, and the taste was to die for. The husband and I agreed that this was on par with curries we frequently order at Thai restaurants. Thank you!

If you like spicy curry you will need to add some chili oil or other heat. Tried dish with both regular and lite coconut milk but lite didn't have the right consistency. Half and half worked out fine though.

I have never cooked Thai before and this tasted just like something I would enjoy at my favorite Thai restaurant!  I omitted the pineapple from mine.  I loved the spiciness - for people who can't handle the heat, you may want to cut down on the curry.  Really enjoyed this one!

So good! Unfortunately, we didn't have any curry paste, so we just replaced it with some curry powder... probably doesn't have the same affect, but it tasted incredible just the same! We also decreased the fish sauce to 1 T and didn't use sugar, like other reviews suggested.

I used light coconut milk and it turned out well. Tweak the curry paste to your preference, add some fresh cracked pepper and it's just like being at your favorite Thai restaurant!

Wish I would have taken the time to read the other reviews first. I would have thickened the sauce as suggested, and I would have cut back on the curry paste (which I did anyway, but I would have done so even more). Otherwise, I think it is a good recipe and easy to make.

My sauce is always orange, but it's really good. And I've been adding two bags of stir-fry vege's at the end and simmer. That way you dont have to cut up all those vegetables. And extra pinapple. Yummy! And no greenpeppers.

Good but not out of this world good. Following the advice of other reviewers, I used 2 tsp of red curry paste and 2 tbsp of fish oil. To save on calories, I used one can of coconut milk instead of two. I don't think that lite coconut milk tastes as good as the real stuff, so that's why I didn't use lite coconut milk. I still had enough sauce in the end. I cooked the veggies for 5 min only in order to make them crunchier.

This is a tasty, very easy meal with authentic flavor.  I use prepared green curry and increase the amount to about 1/3 cup.  Also, we love veggies so I use 3 whole bell peppers.  For ease I use an entire can of pineapple chunks.  My husband and I love this meal and the leftovers are terrific!

Good recipe. I ended up using the entire jar of red curry - I believe it was 0.5 oz. It was still quite mild. I used soy instead of fish sauce and still had to add salt and pepper to taste. Instead of peppers I used baby carrots sliced and chunks of potato. It was very close to a version offered at a local thai place and would be nearly exact with a sprinkle of peanuts. All in all a relatively fast and very easy recipe.

I thought this was pretty good. Next time I will leave out the sugar.  The red paste worked out just fine, although mine did not say "concentrate" on the bottle anywhere.  I might try putting in some other vegis too next time.  My hubby and I both liked it!

Great dish.  I forgot the pineapple but did add the flour like someone mentioned.  Really good.  I like things hot so I actually used a little over a .25cup of concentrated paste.  Probably not for most people but don't be shy about the paste despite what others said.... again though I like stuff HOT.

I had to substitute water chestnuts for the bamboo shoots as my grocer didn't carry the bamboo.  Other than that I made the recipe as is.  This recipe was amazingly good!  Even my daughter (who is VERY fussy) came back for seconds.  I will definitely make this again.

An excellent dish. I'm not sure if I did something wrong, since my sauce was red but I assume it was because the curry paste was red and I only used one can of cononut milk, as several reviewers suggested. I also thickened the sauce with flour and water, since I enjoy a thicker sauce.

The flavors were wonderful and everyone loved it. It made plenty so we had leftovers but those leftovers barely made it through the night as everyone nibbled on plate after plate all through the evening. 

I did not have bamboo shoots or water chestnuts but I actually missed them since I know the crunch would have been a nice touch to the dish. 

I'm definitely going to make this again, as I have had multiple requests from my family since making it last week. I'm surprised that even my 21 month old liked it, since he is a really picky eater. Anything that gets him to eat is a keeper!

I liked this, this isn't for anyone who has a narrow palette though.  I added mushrooms, shredded carrot, sugar snap peas and water chestnuts to beef it up a little.  I will make it again.

Followed previous reviewers advice and only used 1 can of coconut milk, it tasted good but there wasn't enough sauce for all 2 cups of rice.  I used 3 tsp. of red curry powder but it wasn't spicy at all, needed a lot more.  I added carrots and water chestnuts.  Even with my mistakes this was an excellent recipe, very quick and easy to make.

This was great!  I made a few small adjustments based on ingredients on hand and opted to use only one can of light coconut milk since 2 seemed like way too much.  I only had green curry paste and used 2 tbsp instead of the 1/4 cup after reading other reviews.  I reduced both the fish sauce & sugar to 2 tbsp each and used green pepper, bean sprouts and snow peas as that's what I had on hand.  Served over brown basmati!

Overall this was a great recipe, I would rate it a 1 star for spiceness, unless you purchased the concentrated curry paste, I bought the regular so 1/4 cup made it mildy spicy. I would agree on eliminating the sugar, it makes it too sweet, the way I have had it prepared in Thai places it is never sweet. Also the carrots make it a little sweet, if you opt to add them. I added the baby corn too. Definitely add more chicken, it makes a lot.

Scrumptious!  Very similar to a dish I had in a Thai restuarant. VERY spicy. I used Thai Kitchen Red Curry paste. I would cut that in half and adjust from there to your taste. I also used splenda instead of sugar and lite coconut milk. Definite repeat. Absolutely delicious!!!!

Awesome! I doubled up on the chicken like suggested, and used only 1 tbsp of curry, although next time I would use 2. It makes WAY more than 6 servings, but having left overs of a delicious meal is never a bad thing! I will DEFINITELY make this again!

Very easy thai curry  and very delicious. Use 1 Tablespoon for a milder curry, more if you like it spicy.  I also added a little bit of grated ginger.

I really liked this and I'm usually not a big fan of curry. This was easy to make and I'll probably end up making it again. My husband thought it was a bit too sweet so I may reduce the sugar next time. I definitely can't make this all the time with the 2 cans of coconut milk this recipe calls for!

This came out very fishy tasting.  Some people like that but I am not one of those people.  Overall, the creaminess of the sauce bothered me for some reason and there seemed to be way too much of it.  I won't be making this again.

This is great.  I did not use the fish sauce, but as one of the reviewers suggested soy sauce and salt.  Great dish, easy to make.

This was very good, but very spicy.  I changed the Red curry to Yellow curry, not as spicy, and it worked out great.  Probably didn't add as much either.

This was so tasty!  I used "red curry paste" (tandori paste) and it came out pink, not brown like in the picture.  But other than the surprising colour, it was really great!  Will be making again but adding a hotter type of curry as was too mild for me!

This recipe was so easy!  As a basic recipe for thai red curry this sauce is incredible, and then you can doctor it to your liking, The only thing I changed was instead of chicken I used shrimp, which cooked much quicker.  The ingredients were easy to find in the basic grocery store, and that is often my excuse for not cooking asian food.   really a great recipe.

this is easy and yummy. I did change one thing: I used about 1/2 can of lite coconut milk and 1 C chicken broth for a more healthful variation. Adding cilantro at the end would be great!

While this was very good, the smell of that fish sauce was strong!!  I'd either have to leave this ingredient out in the future or at least cut it down to 1 tsp. Next time I would  use the whole red pepper, green pepper and onion instead of half. I also used 2 packages of boneless chicken breasts instead of 1 because it seemed like there would be so much extra sauce (there was plenty of sauce).  Now if I could only get rid of that fish sauce smell!
