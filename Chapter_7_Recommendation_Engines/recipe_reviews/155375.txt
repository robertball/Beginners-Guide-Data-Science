My favorite recipe ever!  Split the shells before you throw the crab legs in.  Once done remove the legs and pour the butter sauce into a dish for dipping....mmmmm good.

I only really wanted a sauce recipe, and this delivered.  Instead of crab legs, I was making pasta, so I doubled the recipes and added about 2 1/2 tablespoons of flour to thicken it.  It was delicious!

Although it was an easy and tasty way to cook crab legs, the mess was incredible!  Imagine trying to pull apart crab legs that are covered in butter!  Why didn't I think of that before serving this dish?  You will need a million napkins and a good sense of humor because your hands will be covered in herbed butter.

Recipe author here - just a note that you can use any crab for this recipe, not just snow crab.  It's also great with shrimp, scallops and even muscles (pre-steam muscles, and toss this sauce with them once cooked)!

I loved it!!!!! I made this for my husband on Valentine's Day. And he couldn't stop raving about how flavorful and moist the crab legs were. The only change i did was adding some old bay. This was my first time working with crab legs, so i was a little afraid. I was also afraid that there wasn't enough liquids for the crab legs to cook, but it was perfect. Don't add any additional water or broths. A very simple and elegant meal!!!

Best crab legs I have ever eaten Anywhere!! (And I made them Myself!) I followed this recipe exactly with the addition of extra garlic and diced onion in the butter mixture.  Also added herb seasoning and some old bay (garlic and onion powder, basil, parsley, and oregano were added as well). The base recipe is great and can be spiced up to suit any fancy.  Even my husband who doesn't like crab took a bite and said it was good.

I made this tonight with Dungeness crab, the first of the season here in California. It was wonderful! Cleaned and quartered a large crab and slit the shells on the legs (cracked the large claws), used fresh parsley because I had some on hand and basted the crab with the butter as it cooked so it got well coated. Messy but delicious. Will definitely make it again real soon.

Very delicious!  I was surprised that the butter sauce flavored the crab as well as it did considering that the crab legs don't lay flat in the skillet.  It worked though.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

This recipe is amazing!! Make sure you place the legs slit down to absorb the butter sauce. This was so easy and quick to make. Usually we boil them and have to wait forever for the water to heat up! We'll be using this recipe from now on :) restaurant quality crab legs!

This was quite good!  I needed a much larger amount (we are a family of 9) so I upped the servings and used my roaster pan placed over 2 burners.  Will make again!

So fast and easy.  My husband and son loved it and said it was so delicious they didn't even need clarified butter.  We will be making crab legs more often with this awesome recipe.

It was good but you couldn't really taste the butter sauce because it doesn't get in the cracks that you cut in the shells. If I make this again I think that I will use more butter so that it is level with the crab and it can really get the flavor inside the shells to the meat.

Wonderful, exquisite, delicious - as good as any my family has had in a restaurant. Easy, no exotic ingredients. Only took a few minutes to fix. Because we were HUNGRY for crab, I had almost two pounds, and had to cook half of it, then the other half. Just had salad and baked potato with it, and it was very satisfying.

I am not a fan of crab legs, but this exact same mixture with jumbo shrimp is amazing. I use it all the time now and just let it simmer in the butter and garlic mixture.

Absolutely stellar recipe!  I doubled all the ingredients, and then added an extra 1/2 cup of butter besides, just because we love having extra sauce for dipping, if possible!  :)  THIS is how I'm going to make snow crab legs from now on!  I might try using a bit of red pepper flakes next time, for a little more heat...but it was super as-is!

I could only find king crab, it was very hard to slit the shells  so needless to say the butter did not get onto the meat, but the butter is great for other things.

This was amazing! I live in Florida and I am obsessed with snow crab legs. Instead of going to the 'many' crab houses around and getting their garlic butter covered crabs. I decided to make my own. This recipe was great. I boiled my crab legs in old bay seasoning with a few other spices. Also added red potatoes to the pot. I made this on the side to dip the crabs and potatoes in. I didn't measure anything. I just did it by sight and to my taste. This will definitely be my go to whenever I make crab legs.

I'm giving this five stars because the flavor was wonderful.  I'll never make it again tho.  It was much too messy!!  Crab legs are messy enough without coating them in butter!  I will make the herbed butter again and use it to dip the crab meat in.  Thanks for a great recipe to enhance the taste of one of my favorite foods.  Hubby loved it, but also thought it was too messy.

i followed recipe except for i cracked the crab open and sauteed the meet with no shell as others had suggested.  this had so much flavor and turned out perfect.  I served over wheat noodles with alfredo sauce and home made red lobster rolls.  it was delicious.  the leftovers even came out well the next day.  thanx for sharing

Best crab I've ever eaten! Followed the recipe exactly except for I added five minutes at the beginning with the lid on the pan once I had added the crab (I was paranoid about it not cooking through).

Mmmm! This is my favorite way to prepare crab legs. The buttery, garlic flavor accents the flavor of the crab very well. It was also easy to make; using pre-cooked crab legs was pretty convenient. Great recipe!

I made this recipe tonight for dinner and it turned out wonderfully!  I also googled how to make the cheddar bay biscuits like Red Lobster makes and it complimented the meal well.  I absolutely *love* this recipe; thanks for the idea!!!!

Very good!  I used my roaster to fit the crab legs and I added old bay seasoning with about a quarter cup of water.

This recipe was delicious. I could not find snow crab, so I applied this same recipe to king crab, which worked just as well. The tip to cut the legs before cooking made the eating much easier. My wife loved them. This is the second time we have used tihs recipe. These are a bit messy, but worth it.

First time making crab legs - simple and tasty!  I was nervous there wasn't enough liquid, so I added a touch of water.  I'm not sure it was necessary.  Turned out great!

Great taste, easy to prepare. Medium was a little too high on my stove- the butter burned while the crab legs were cooking. Will keep this one in the rotation.

This is a delicious result for little time and effort to serve crab legs in the shell.  They were tender, juicy and tasty.  My husband raved about them.   No more grill for us.

Delicious base recipe to add whatever you like to the crab. A review I saw added Old Bay seasoning- which was perfect! This recipe gets messy with your hands covered in the garlic butter. I couldn't help but lick my fingers! Very flavorful recipe I will continue to make again and again.

My family loves this recipe, however, my husband does not trust that they will cook completely in the butter so we usually steam them for about 5 minutes before putting them in the butter sauce.  We've made them several times & everyone absolutely loves them.  This last time I added Old Bay & Cayenne based on some of the reviews & they were even better!

Excellent sauce for pretty much any seafood, especially crab and shrimp. You may be tempted to increase the sauce since it won't cover the crab completely, but as long as you crackers the legs prior to putting them in the sauce, you shouldn't have a problem! The sauce will lend a wonderful flavor without overpowering the crab. I made 1.5 lbs of crab and had a bit of the sauce left over for dipping. Great recipe!

I only had imitation crab meat, but wanted something yummy. I cooked it with this recipe and it was pretty good despite the 'fake' meat! It was a little salty, but that could be because it was imitation meat and not the real thing.

First time writing review on allrecipes.... IT WAS THAT GOOD!!! I enjoy trying crab legs wherever and whenever I travel. THIS TOPS THEM ALL!  Minor modifications: I added another 1/4 cup butter, red pepper flakes, diced up 2 green onions (chives), and a dash of 'soul food' seasoning. AMAZING!!!!!! No more crab leg eat out. I will definitely make this again. Thank you!

Messy But Worth It!  Followed recipe exactly and it was so good.  I read the reviews and since I had 2lbs of crab legs used a roaster over two burners and doubled the recipe.  Will be making these again and again and again! Thanks for posting

This was great! I came home from the market and needed a recipe. Four came up for crab legs, this one required 1 Lb. of Snow Crab clusters. What I came home with was 1 Lb. of Snow Crab clusters! I had everything except the clove of garlic, which I subbed with garlic powder.  We thought they came out great! It was an easy recipe that tasted wonderful. I did up the butter a bit, and threw in some lemon juice toward the end, but other than that I followed the instructions as close as I could.  Next time I cook crab legs I'm using this recipe!

Excellent! Added 1/2 teas old bay seasoning and for faster prep I broke legs at joints instead of cutting slits. Rave reviews from all!

Thanks for sharing this very easy way to make crab legs.  They have amazing flavor.  We have made them at least 6 times and everyone loves them.

It was alright, wasn't as garlicky as I would have liked. It was a little on the salty side after doubling the sauce recipe for 2 lbs of crab legs. I used dungeness crab, don't know if that made a difference. In my opinion, I think the snow crab legs would have been saltier. Thanks, anyways. I don't think I will make again.

Did three pounds for nephews birthday.  Cut the legs open first.  Tripled recipe and cooked in two batches.  Was perfect for the four and a half of us who were eating it.

Easy and delicious! I’ve never cooked crab legs in a skillet before. It totally worked. Added lemon pepper and a squeeze of fresh lemon. Also poured the extra garlic butter in the pan over white sticky rice with a little added olive oil and lemon pepper. We were devouring this whole meal!

The key was putting a slit in each crab legs before cooking in the the garlic butter. I added parsley as well and made individual cups of the garlic butter for dipping.

All you people that use Old Bay, you must not ’t be from the northeast. I suspect you’re from Delaware on down. That’s an actual sin in the northeast. You can always use the sauce for dipping, but steaming is best, and use the sauce as a dipping sauce. But from the northeast, butter is all you need. Anything else masks the taste of the king crab legs. Garlic is always great, but if you get anything from shrimp, scallops, KING crab legs, or the ultimate lobster, butter is all you need, unless you’re making a scampi! But the garlic butter is delicious!

I had just under a pound of Red King Crab that I wanted to do something different with and I'm so happy that i found this recipe.  After reading reviews I decided to cut channels on both sides of the claws and the meat popped right out.  A few minutes after adding the crab to the skillet I realized that the garlic was getting very brown,  I didn't want it to overcook and be bitter, so I turned off the heat to allow the residual heat to warm the crab. I made no changes other than omitting the salt, crab is fairly salty on it's own. I will definitely make this again. Thanks for the great recipe!

These always turn out great. We buy the frozen 2lb bag from sams and I drizzle butter from the pan over them while they cook. We always save the butter from the pan to dip the crab into.

Crab legs were part of a special meal prior to sending our twin daughters back to college after Thanksgiving. This recipe could not have been easier. (I went way heavy on the garlic) as I always do. The crab legs turned out great. I poured the extra butter into ramekins for dipping the crab meet and bread into. Very tasty!

I let my butter get dark and ensured the garlic bits got nice and toasty.  VGP said the flavor was 'complex' and asked for more.  This was a definite hit and we discussed taking to VGP's parents house for the next holiday.  Thanks for the quick, tasty recipe.

I never thought of making crab legs like this... This is sooo much better than boiling. So much more flavor!! Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Substituted 3 tbls Extra Virgin Olive Oil for the 1/4 C butter. Next time will leave out the salt. I found slitting the crab legs made them more difficult to open and eat, which was frustrating because they were so delicious!

I was told to steam my crablegs, but I didn't have a coliander-type pan.  This was sooo delicious and easier then steaming! My crablegs were frozen, so I just put a lid on my pan, and kept flipping them.  The garlic butter was terrific.  More tastier than putting them in water.  I knew you would come through for me!

Absolutely worth the mess!!! Crab is amazing by itself, but the sauce along with old bay, really takes it up a notch. We will be eating again and again!

Amazing! Made this for my family as a Valentine's treat! My wife (who grew up on New England King Crab) LOVED it! She was SO impressed! I tripled the recipe for our family of 4 knowing we'd throw down! And we did. Ate it all. Added a bit more than 3x butter since I accidentally let some of the butter cook off before adding crab. Added extra garlic too because we love it! Thanks to this recipe and All Recipes for making me look good!

Very tasty and very quick and easy.   The second time I made it, I used unsalted butter and left out the salt and added 1 t. dried dill weed and 1/2 t. Old Bay to the recipe.

I made crab for my first time tonight for our New Years Eve dinner. All I  can say is wow. My husband said it was perfect and the best he's ever had. I have never been a fan if crab legs until tonight. Don't change a thing in this one. Super easy!

This was so easy and so good!! My family LOVED it. Use all the excess butter after for the dipping sauce, if you even need it. It's already so good on it's own.

It was my first time making crab legs.  My brothers and I found this recipe to use for our mom for Mother's Day.  She absolutely loved it!  After reading other reviews, I cooked the shrimp we were also making (for the first time) in the butter mixture.  Everything was outstanding.
Two Pieces of Info:
1. Cutting the slip in the legs makes them harder to crack open when you're eating.
2. You will be COVERED in butter! Have a lot of extra napkins on hand.

I have never made crab legs before but my husband son and daughter love them when we go out.  We decided to do seafood for Christmas Eve dinner. They want this now as our annual Christmas Eve dinner. It was phenomenal with no changes. Guess I know what's cooking next year!  Thanks for the easy awesome recipe.

I baked the crab legs at 400*until warm.  I served this sauce on the side.  I did add Old Bay seasoning and Italian blend to it too. Very easy, very delicious. Will make it again.

delicious and deceivingly easy to make. I omitted the dried parsley and forgot to buy crab shell crackers so it was rather hard to eat but very very good. Boyfriend loved it for his birthday

I wasn't sure if my crab was fully defrosted...woops...so after I sauteed the crab I put it on a cookie sheet in the oven at 350, covered with foil jjust to keep it warm.   Got it hot enough and it wasn't dry.  Best crab I've made. Will use this recipe again!

First time cooking crab legs and this was very very good! The only thing I was a bit annoyed at (which isn't the recipe's fault) is that it was a bit hard to coat the crab legs with the seasoning and butter. Next time I might try a recipe that has a dipping sauce instead but I would still make this one too!

I love making crab legs this way. Don't need a cup of butter to dip the meat in, it's already cooked with it...delish!

It was very easy and quick. Flavor was wonderful, I would use less butter the next time.
