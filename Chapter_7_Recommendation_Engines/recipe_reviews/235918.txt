I added chopped green onion and red pepper sauteed in a little olive oil. Also substituted evaporated 2% milk for the half and half. Great, easy buffet or brunch dish

These were very good but I did change the recipe a bit. My family has wheat allergies so we used a homemade GF "bisquick mix". I halved the recipe as I only has a few eggs and about 10oz of sausage. I used whole milk. My kids loved them. I will definetly make these again. I got 6 muffin cups and I stuffed them with sausage to make them filling. I will make them again. Mine didn't look like the picture they looked like a muffin; they puffed up more but very delicious.

This recipe is delicious great way to make good breakfast ahead of time for a daily quick meal.?. I doubled the recipe used whole milk instead of half-and-half but only 3 cups used 1 pound of sausage and 1 pound of bacon.  I also have some large muffin bakers that I used to make mini quiches.

Not just for Christmas... these are delicious!  I followed the recipe and added some onion powder and garlic powder to taste.  Put them in the freezer and they've been great as a 'grab and go' breakfast.  Just pop in the microwave on defrost for about a minute and instant eggs and sausage for breakfast!  Awesome recipe!  That's for sharing!

I followed this recipe exactly with one exception. I used a box of frozen sausage links, because I had it for awhile. It was enough once in pieces, to cover the bottom of the 12 muffin cups, I think 1 lb of sausage has to be too much, considering I had some leftover batter mix, in other site I saw this recipe and noted it was for 24 muffins. It took close to 35 min to bake, they were huge but then deflated as normal in this type of egg recipes. The term muffin is a bit misleading as they are nothing like muffins, more like souffles. Bottom line, delicious! They were a hit at my office and I will make them again. Thank you!

These were *not* muffins. They were very eggy and after cooking didn't look very appetizing because they all deflated.
That being said, they tasted pretty good. I did make a fee changes and will continue to tweet this recipe until I really like it.
I used almond milk instead of half & half (the extra calories are not needed). I added some onion and garlic powder to the egg mixure. I also stirred in the cheese to the egg mixure rather than placing on top.
I might double the Bisquick next time & hope they come out as muffins.
I used a mini cupcake pan rather than regular one & it made about 40 little bites.
I will do this recipe again, just not exactly as written. Good base.
