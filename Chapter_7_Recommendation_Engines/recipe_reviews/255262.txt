Oh my gosh.  This dish was amazing but I did make some changes.  I followed the recipe but I used the zest and juice of two limes and I also added 1 heaping teaspoon of fresh minced garlic, 1 teaspoon of paprika and 1 teaspoon of salt.  In addition, I added 2 tbsp of fresh chopped cilantro and that made the dish.  I served it with rice and fresh green beans and it all turned out perfectly.  On the cooking time, I used my convection oven and baked them at 400 for 30 minutes.  Tented them with foil and let them sit for 10 minutes, they were super juicy.

I made this and marinaded for just a couple of hours and it was so so yummy! I followed the recipe as far as a lot of the spices but instead of chili powder I used Valentina Chili Lime powder. I used a 1/3c. of the oil, 3 chunks from a garlic clove (minced), 1 tsp. of paprika, 1 tsp. of salt, and I zested and squeezed (and got as much out of as I could, insides and all) 2 limes. When I put the chicken on a foiled pan, I scooped out all those good hunks and chunks of stuff from the bag and spooned on top! Thatâ€™s where all your flavor is! I used the same temperature, and cooked them until they almost looked like they were going to maybe burn and then broiled on high for 3 minutes so they looked roasted and crispy!! Made easy elotes for the side and it was Aaah-mazing!!!!

Made this last night. Added extra lemon juice, paprika, garlic salt, and chopped garlic. Did not have onion powder. Turned out great; however, would probably decrease cook time and end with broil to crisp up the skin on the drumsticks.

It might be just my taste buds, but this was a disappointment.  I will say that the seasoning definitely seasoned the chicken though.  My husband said he like it.

We liked this! I did add some salt to the marinade as a personal preference. We didn't get a strong lime flavor, so next time, I think I'll add some of the lime zest as well. This was tasty and I will be making it again! Thanks for sharing. :)

l made it  exactly like it's written. 
Everyone enjoyed it. A family concensus was it needed more heat and some salt. Next time a 1/2 to 1 tsp.cayene pepper  some salt and done on the grill should put it over the top!

I made this last night.  I cut the recipe back to 3 drumsticks because it's just the hubby and me. Added a bit more lime as others have suggested and swapped out the oregano and parsley for fresh cilantro. Super tasty,  even my hubby loved it and he usually Hates citrus with meat! Thank you for sharing!

Pretty delicious. Very moist chicken.
Followed recipe closely.  Added double garlic and extra hot chilli pepper. 
Marinated for two hours, and was good, I will marinate overnight next time and add a bit extra lime juice.

Giving a 4 star rating only because I made some minor changes but it was delicious and I will make it again.
Used lemon juice of 1 lemon instead of lime because that's what I had on hand but will increase it.
Used 1 tsp onion powder but will increase it.
Used 1/4 tsp pepper.
Used 1/4 tsp chili powder but will increase it.
Used 1 tsp salt but will increase it.

This was good but I added extra lime juice from a bottle and next time I won't add so much. Also I would add more salt. I only added 1 1/2 tsp, so maybe one more half tsp  for me. I like salt. I also used 12 pieces of chicken and didn't change the amounts. Update, I had a second bag of marinated chicken the same time I made the first one and I froze it.  Well I added cumin and garlic salt and it came out much better than the first one.

I didn't have onion powder so I substituted marjoram. I used this recipe on a whole chicken and it worked perfectly. The meat was super moist and delicious.

My family enjoyed this recipe. I did use minced garlic instead of powdered garlic, Will be making this again.
