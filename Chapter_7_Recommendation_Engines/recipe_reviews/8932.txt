HOLY MOLY. I gave this 4 stars the day before yesterday, thinking it was better than okay, but not outstanding. Well, yesterday, and especially today, the flavors have melded together, the curry flavor has mellowed, the fruity flavors have brightened, it tastes like a great amercian chicken salad for a picnic lunch, but about 20 times better. WOW. TRY THIS RECIPE! But, don't judge until it's had a chance to sit in the fridge for at least 1 day. ..... p.s. I used about 4 Tbs. Miracle Whip Light (25 cals/Tbs) and I don't think it could have tasted better with full fat mayo. To keep the cals to a minimum, remember that 1/2 cup of nuts packs a big calorie punch, so chop them small and reduce the amount to 1/4 or 1/3 cup. And use nuts that are especially healthy, such as walnuts (excellent source of Omega-3 fats), if you want those extra calories to really count for something, nutritionally.

Wow, this is my new chicken salad recipe.  I am a bit of a chicken salad 'snob' in that I have made so many different varieties and order it very often at restaurants. This version is perfect (as long as you like curry)!!  Boiling chicken to perfection is hard to do so here's my 5 cents worth:  Cut up your raw chicken in chunks and bring to a boil in chicken broth.  Boil for just a couple of minutes and then put a lid on, take off the stove and just let it sit for 15 minutes or so.  It cooks slowly like this and results in a perfect texture and flavor.

Excellent!  I modified this recipe by omitting the apple and grapes and using craisins in place of raisins and chunk chicken in a can to save time and it tasted great.  The tasted of curry in this really makes this salad and you definitely need to make sure to let the flavors "marinate" for a few hours before serving as the taste is much better then.  I have eaten this stuffed into a pita pocket and also rolled into a wheat tortilla wrap with a green salad on the side for lunch.

Wonderful!  I used a whole rottiserie chicken, increased the mayonnaise to 1 cup, increased the curry to 1 tsp., added craisins instead of raisins and it turned out great.  Definitely my favorite.  Thanks.

Easy and delicious - plus it's a great way to use up leftover grilled chicken! I didn't have pecans so I subbed toasted walnuts instead. I used a Granny Smith Apple and red seedless grapes vs. green. I also  used dried cranberries vs. raisins. I mixed the dressing in a separate bowl before folding it into the chicken and other ingredients. For the dressing I used 1/2 cup of Hellman's light mayo cut with 1/4 cup of reduced fat sour cream along with the curry and a bit of salt and pepper. It chilled for just a couple of hours and it came out really good. Overall, a great combination of flavors! Especially good on whole grain bread!

LOVE this recipe, my favorite of all recipes I have tried at this site.  It is healthy, relatively simple to make, can be made ahead of time (although Hubby keeps eating it up). I often substitute depending on what I have on hand without any problems: canned chicken, leftover rotisserie chicken, leftover turkey, fuji apples, walnuts, cranberries, yellow onions.  This is one of the few recipes my husband and my own mother has complimented me on more than once.

I am always looking for the perfect recipes--those that are keepers that I will make repeatedly.  This is one of those recipes.  I have made it for two bridal luncheons in the past month and both occasions lead to the remarks home chefs love to hear--"This is the best chicken salad I've ever eaten!"  If you make it the day before,I would suggest having a bit more of the curry mayo to freshen it up right before serving. Mine seemed to soak up the dressing.

Wonderful chicken salad recipe!!  I used boneless chicken breasts that I sprinkled with garlic pepper and seasoned salt and baked for about 45 minutes.  I made the recipe exactly as written, and people raved about how good it was.  I think this is the best chicken salad I've ever had.  This is a new favorite for me!

Simply said, this dish is exquisite!  I hosted a baby shower just this weekend and was asked many, many times for the recipe.  I was a little concerned about what the curry would taste like but after tasting it, I no longer had any concerns.  If you can, make the salad at least a few hours ahead; overnight is best.    I made a double-batch and it easily fed 20 people--I served the salad with tiny croissants bought in the Kroger deli section.  It is truly the best chicken salad I've ever had!!!

This recipe is full of flavor!  I added extra curry powder which did not make it more spicy.  I also added glazed pecans, that would normally go on top of a pecan pie.  It was delicious and eaten within two days!

I had a chicken salad similar to this in a tea room restaurant and loved it.  I have been looking for a recipe since, and this was the closest I could find.  I have made it twice and both times gotten great reviews.  I leave out the onions, (while I love onions, I don't believe raw onions mix well with the fruity taste trying to be acheived with this salad), celery, and raisins.  I add chopped bing cherries (adds a great flavor and color to the dish), pineapple chunks, and some pineapple juice to the mayonnaise "dressing".  I do believe this salad tastes twice as good the next day.  I like to serve it either atop a bed of romaine lettuce or on whole grain bread.  It makes a very refreshing summer meal!

Very good, it didn't taste like curry it was just a nice overall manheim taste.  Used fuji apple, red grapes. Followed everything else the same but did not use raisins and I forgot to add nuts. Like people said it tastes better after being in the fridge. *update*made this again following love2cook's ckn boiling advice. Boiled ckn with a buillon cube, used craisins and sliced almonds. Very flavorful!

This is really delicious!  The magic ingredient seems to be the curry powder, which I was unsure about at first. Making it a day ahead of time is a MUST since the flavors really need time to blend.   I made this yesterday and tasted it a few hours later.  It was okay but strong with the taste of curry.  Today, we ate it for lunch and the flavors had blended so well that it no longer had the strong curry flavor.  It tasted great!  What a difference a day makes!  The only thing I might do next time is add a bit more mayonnaise since today it seemed a little drier that I prefer.  Also, I may puree my chicken next time since a popular local restaurant does that and it is wonderful  . . . and theirs seem to stay on the croissiant roll better too.  Either way, if you like chicken salad, this is the recipe for you! Thanks for sharing, Karen.

This is the most delicious chicken salad! I've made it countless times. Sometimes I use canned cooked chicken, sometimes leftover rotisserie chicken, or I'll cook a couple of breasts and chop them up. All versions are excellent. I don't always use celery, I'll use whatever apples are on sale, I don't usually use pecans but I have and it's good, I've used all types of onions, red grapes, and I always use extra curry. Everyone who I've served this to loves it. It's good on bread, croissant, with crackers, and over lettuce. I can't rave enough about this recipe- one of my favorites on the site!

The BEST chicken salad recipe ever! I increased the curry powder to 1 1/2 tsp, used regular raisins, and used two celery stalks for added crunchiness. Also used canned chicken in a pinch (two large cans) and it came out perfect! It will be tough, but wait at least a day before eating and it will be well worth it!

A family favorite, especially on a hot day! I add a tsp. of ginger and sometimes I cook fresh cranberries, halved, and the zest of an orange with the chicken for a delish variation. Poppyseeds are also a good addition.

I am a vegetarian, so I used cooked, chilled, Quorn Chik'n Pieces in place of real chicken. I also used regular raisins, as I had no golden raisins on hand. It turned out fantastic and was even better the second day. The pecans and curry really added another dimension. It was great in croissants, and on toast.

I made this recipe for a ladies luncheon and it was a huge hit!!! I made it a day ahead of time to allow the flavors to come through and blend and it worked out so well! One thing I did was to shred the chicken breasts rather than dice them. I prefer this texture rather than having little cubes of meat. I also left out the golden raisins. I added a few more grapes instead. Next time I might try some dried cranberries instead. Thanks for sharing this!!!!

Made this for a get together & it was very good.  The only change I made was instead of raisins, I used craisins.  I think it gives  it alittle more flavor.  Put on croissants. I'm not a big chicken salad person but I liked it!  If I make it next time, I might want to "jazz" it up a bit with more curry, pepper and more grapes.

My family loves this recipe. My two daughters can't get enough. I substitute yogurt for half the mayo, since I'm not a big fan, and it adds a lovely tang to the already delightfully complex flavor.

Delicious!  This will be a standard whenever I have leftover turkey or chicken.  I used 4 C. leftover diced turkey.  I wanted it a bit moister, so I made 1/4 extra recipe of dressing.  I love curry, so added extra to taste.

Really delicious salad!  I usually make my own curry blends, but was in a hurry this time.  A dear friend from India taught me a great trick:  bloom the spices before using them by heating them in a small fry pan until they release their aroma (careful not to toast or burn them or they'll become bitter).  Let them cool on a saucer, then add them to the mayo.  You won't have to wait until the next day for full flavor.  I used grocery store rotisserie chicken because it's what I had...and served it on baby romaine.  Terrific.  We ate it for two days and loved it.  Thanks!

I reduced the mayonnaise to 1/2 c. and increased the curry (I like a kick!).  I also left out the apples since the salad was batch prepared for the whole week, and I didn't want any browning to occur.  This is a great recipe though, and a really good base for other chicken salad recipes.

whoa, people were right when they said this tastes awesome after spending 24 hours in the fridge!! I used purple raisins because I didn't have any golden ones. Also left out the celery and nuts because I didn't have them. I used finely diced vidalia onion instead of green onions and this was freakin delicious! All the flavors of the fruit, chicken, curry and onion go so well together.

This was awesome! I recommend using a Fuji apple, it's crunchier. I didn't use grapes, but I doubled the raisins and the nuts.

I LOVE this recipe.  I have to make it at least once a month.  I agree that it is better the next day.  I do leave out the onion because I don't care for them.  So glad I found this recipe.  Thank you for sharing.

I used half the curry, seedless red grapes, a Fuji apple, craisins and toasted walnuts. Delicious combination of flavors. Can hardly wait to try the leftovers tomorrow! Am thinking next time I will use more curry... YUM!

Just as an earlier reviewer stated, "Hubby ate it all, so I don't know how the flavor can improve with refrigerating overnight."  Excellent for those hot Bakersfield summer nights!  I used almonds instead of pecans, but that was just a choice because I have more of them.

Nice flavor.  I left out the rasins-not a fan.  I used canned chicken to save on time and it was still good.  Served for a mother's day luncheon.

Good basic recipe which I changed for our tastes and what I had on hand.  Used 4 small chix brst halves,  2 celery stalks diced, 1/2 lg diced honeycrisp apple, 2 tblsp diced sweet onion, fresh grd pepper, 3 t of homemade curry powder (2 t tumeric, 1 t cumin, 1 t coriander, 1/4 t grd clove, 1/4 t nutmeg, 1/2 t cayenne, 1/2 t grd ginger,1/2 t salt) oven toasted slivered almonds, raisins, splash of lime juice and no grapes--added lite mayo until blended nicely--about 1/2 cup?--it's all melding in the frig right now but preliminary taste tests are YummO!

This was awesome! I definitely agree with the tip to refrigerate for at least a day before serving to let the flavors develop. The curry adds a pleasantly unique flavor to this chicken salad. I used walnuts in place of pecans and craisins in place of raisins which both worked beautifully. I underestimated the prep time in terms of chopping everything, but it was definitely worth it. Will probably make again for guests, showers, potlucks, etc.

MY OH MY.  That's all I have to say about this recipe.  Being new to recipes I tried to stick to the ingredients, however I used red grapes, dark raisons and regular mayo since that's what I had on hand.  I had to refrain from adding more curry since I love it, but it doesn't need anymore. It is perfect as it is. The taste is amazing. In my early 20's I worked for a french deli that served curry chicken salad and it was my favorite dish. I now have a dish I'll be proud to bring to parties, WOW!!!

Excellent recipe. I had some cooked chicken breast and came to all recipes to look for a dinner idea. This was perfect. I went light on the curry but next time I'll put in the full amount. I only used about 1 1/2 cup cooked chicken and reduced mayo to 2 Tbsp mayo and 3 Tbsp milk kefir. The other ingredients were about the same.

This was a very tasty, easy and versitile recipe. Had left over lime/cajun chicken breast to use. Didn't have raisins, grapes or pecans. So just used the apple and toasted walnuts and it still turned out fabulous for a wrap. Will have to try the recipe as written. Thanks!

Soooo good!!  My whole family loved it (kids are 3, 5 and 7).  Only changes I made were no pecans and no raisins, then I added more celery and more grapes.  Mmmmm!

This is incredible.  I love curry, and I was searching the site for something yummy.  This definitely did the trick.  I added a little bit more curry and omitted onions (because I don't like them).  I brought it to work the next day and we couldn't get enough of it.  Sooo good!!!

I don't like chicken salad.  That being said, this was absolutely delicious!  I omitted the pine nuts and used Fat Free Miracle Whip in order to make it more of a diet recipe, and I don't think it sacrificed one bit of the flavor! Actually, I think I'd prefer the sweet/tangy flavor of Miracle Whip to regular mayonnaise.  I paired this with Special K Savory Herb crackers, which complemented the flavor very well, for a healthy, light snack.

I have made this recipe several times after finding it on Allrecipes.  I absolutely love it, and end up taking some to work for lunch the next day!  It is really good served on a whole grain flatbread, too.

Yum! I'm so glad I decided to try this recipe despite not being a fan of a few of the ingredients. The flavors have perfect harmony and I honestly don't believe the addition of another ingredient could make this any more appetizing. I omitted the nuts only because I can't bear to eat them. I cut the recipe in half, but ended up needing nearly all of the mayo. I actually used a whipped dressing instead of mayo because it's much healthier. Fantastic recipe. No changes necessary!

My absolute favorite chicken salad ever. My husband and I make this often in the hotter months.  Definitely let it sit overnight so that the flavors mix well.

Admittedly, I am not a curry fan. Something about where I grew up. But I do enjoy curried chicken salad. This is a great recipe! I love the sweet with the slightly spicy tang of the curry. I've enjoyed this for lunch the last couple of days.

This is the best chicken salad I have ever had.  Love that curry flavor mixed with sweet and a bit salty.  Very easy.. I eyeballed the ingredients and added the poached chicken breast.  I cut back on the pecans and broke into small pieces.  Along with the a bit of mayonaise, I added some honey greek yogurt and it was perfect!

My husband and I loved this recipe. I left out the celery since neither of us is fond of raw celery and added extra curry since we love that spice. However, none of our four kids liked this recipe at all, so I am only giving it 4 out of 5 stars. This is one I will save for when the kids are out of the house though!

Very easy recipe and delicious.  I cooked the chicken breasts in low sodium chicken broth, which I saved to use in another recipe thereafter.  The curry flavor is subtle, and next time I make it for our family, I will use a bit more curry powder.  I used craisins instead of golden raisins and toasted slivered almonds instead of pecans.  It was delicious.  Next time I will hold the almonds to add just prior to serving, for better crunch.   I agree that making it a day ahead improved the flavor!

AMAZING! Sadly, i got home from the store to realize that I didn't have curry at e like I though. So sadly i left that out and then i left out pecans also. The chicken I used was Kroger "Better then baked chicken" and shredded the 2 breast from that and then red instead of green grapes. I left it in the fridge over night before enjoying it. Next time I will have curry, but even without it the combination is wonderful!

Made it for a ladies luncheon.  Everyone loved it!  My only very slight changes was to put in about 1/2 the green onions and, as one reviewer suggested, add additional dressing before serving.  It is MUCH better the next day.  Also followed the suggestion to cut-up the chicken before cooking (in broth).  Used all the same ingredients except regular vs. light mayonnaise.  Will make again!

DE-licious!!  I used what I had on hand, so substituted  Craisins for raisins and used 1/2 an onion chopped for green onions.  Did not toast the pecans due to time....everything else the same.  I made it from all organic ingredients, so that was a bonus!!  I just made it, so it hasn't had a chance to sit over night, but I'm assuming it is going to be 10x as delicious tomorrow:)

I tweaked it a bit...I omitted the pecans and grapes because I paired it with a different chicken salad and it is definitely a go to, I will make this again and again.

i really like this! you can totally modify this and still get great results. for example, i add more apples and celery. i also add some sesame seeds. i add less mayonaise than in the recipe and it still turns out great. it's great because once prepared, you have something ready for a few days. as other people have said, it tastes better the next day. 
afiyet olsun!

I tried to replicate the curried chicken salad wrap from my fav coffee shop and this was pretty close & tasty.  I halved the recipe and left out onions, used Craisins, walnuts in place of pecans, and added two large spoonfuls of vanilla yogurt to sweeten it up.  We ate in two large wraps with lettuce.  It was a filling meal.  The only change I would make if I made again would be to use less mayo and more yogurt.

Excellent- added a sprinkle more of curry powder and pepper and I also squeezed about 1/4 a lime as recommended earlier. Will definitely make again. Served on mini croissants. Next time I will try a slice of cheese.

I made this salad for lunch today and I really enjoyed it!. I didn't have grapes but even without them was great.  I used low fat plain yogurt mixed with the mayo to make it lighter and turned out really great.

This is an incredible chicken salad, and it works just as well with a store-bought rotisserie chicken that shaves the cooking time, and red grapes also work just as well as green. It tastes great on croissants or by itself!

This chicken salad is really yummy, flavourful, and I love the crunch of the apple and celery. I didn't use any grapes--didn't have 'em and they're not missed b/c the apple and raisins add plenty of sweetness. I used roasted sliced almonds and next time I'll wait 'til serving to add them as they got a bit soft over night. Also, curry powders can vary as far as their spice make-up. I added a couple dashes of cinnamon to my salad to play up the curry and the apple.

I made this for my sister's baby shower.  The shower wasn't supposed to be at my house, but an emergency required that we change the location.  So I needed something fast, easy, and FANTASTIC that would feed 60 people.  This did the trick and then some.  On a croissant with a bit of lettuce, everyone thought I'd had the shower catered.  When it got out that I had made the sandwiches on the fly the night before, amidst a flurry of preparations for the shower, I got 15 requests for the recipe.  Thank you so much for saving my sister's shower.  I'm not joking, this recipe really saved the whole day.

I'm not a big curry fan, but this was excellent!  The apples and raisins give it just the right sweetness and the pecans give it a little extra crunch.  It's a nice change from regular chicken salads and worth the time and effort.

This is the best chicken salad I have ever eaten!  I used dark raisins and red grapes to add a little color.  I will definitely make this from now on when I need chicken salad.

Sorry to say, but I wasn't impressed.  It was pretty when I put it together, but lacked flavor.  Just like the recipe states, the flavor is better on the second day.  Unfortunately, by the time it gains all of its flavor, its appearance is very unappetizing as the curry turns it a yellowish color.  Definitely not something I would want to serve.

Very good! I ended up using red grapes (my preference) and a lot more total fruit than called for.  Needed more seasoning but I just added to taste!

Just made my first batch of chicken salad! I tasted a curry chicken salad from a deli some time ago and fell in love with it.  I happy to say that this recipe made my tastebuds fall back in love ! I'm allergic to nuts but it was delicious without.  didn't have golden delicious apple, but a red delicious worked just fine too :)

I have been using this recipe for a few years and it's always a big hit! Even when I just have canned chicken on hand, it still tastes amazing, especially after it's had time to sit for awhile so the flavors all meld together.  I never have grapes on hand, so I leave those out; and often I use red onion instead of green onion...still tastes wonderful. I do increase the pepper a bit and use a little more curry, but I like that flavor :)

It's my go to chicken salad receipe.  The curry powder give it a nice kick.  It's even better the next day.  Sometimes I'll leave out the celery until just before we use it so that the celery is nice and crispy.

Best chicken salad I've ever tasted! I cooked the chicken on the George Foreman grill and diced it up when hot so it was flaky. I didn't have raisins, so used a 1/3 cup sunflower seeds instead. Yummy!

Very good. Made this for a get-together and everyone enjoyed it. Even had people request the recipe. I did substitue a lot, though, so i can't really give a "true" review". I used red grapes, miracle whip light, no nuts, and a different type of apple. However, I like that this recipe can be tailored to each person's liking and still taste great! Will make this again.

I hardly ever leave a review for a recipe but this one definitely inspired me! This is a must try for those who like their curry chicken salads; especially on the complex side, although not complex to make. Modified a few little items for my taste preferences and it was spectacular, even on the first try! Can't wait for tomorrow's leftovers as other reviewers say it's even better with a little time. I used toasted walnuts instead of pecans, red grapes instead of green, 1/2C regular mayonnaise instead of 3/4C light, added close to 1/4 teaspoon salt and the juice of one hand-squeezed lemon. I bet this would be a stand-out at any pot luck!

We LOVED this! However, I did modify it to our taste. We left out the celery, onion, and pepper. We like it fruity! I used a Gala apple instead of Golden Delicious. My husband has requested that I make it at least once a week. We love the curry powder! (94)

Awesome flavor. Didn't have golden raisans, so used "regular" raisans and it turned out FAB.

Delicious!  This was very easy to make.  Everyone who rated it said it's even better the second day.  Well I had a serving only three hours after making it and it tasted great.  I served it over pita bread. So thank you so much for the recipe.  I love it.

Great recipe!  I normally don't like chicken salad but this was fantastic.  I followed advice from other reviews and made it the day before and added some extra mayo and curry to make it a bit creamier.  I always use light mayo and it was great in this recipe too.  Definitely a keeper.

I pretty much made it exactly as written and it was the best chicken salad I have made yet.  Used craisins instead of raisins.  Chopped everything very fine.  Decreased the amount of onion/celery.  Will def. make again.

Was amazed by the flavor and taste that came out of this dish. I was a bit skeptical using the curry powder but it really came out great. The only thing I will change next time is cutting down the onion by one. It was a bit overpowering.

Just whipped this up to have for lunch tomorrow (with a little extra curry powder).  I could not resist a sample and it was delish! I think pineapple would be a fantastic addition, so I will add a little next time.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This is by far the best chicken salad ever. Great for summer get togethers but I also serve this year round. I don't really change much in the recipe although I have made it with cherry flavored cranberries. This is always a hit!

My husband and I own a small cheesecake cafe, but have just started serving this recipe for our sandwiches.  In just three days, we have repeat customers for the chicken salad alone.  It has almost become more popular than the cheesecake, and I didn't think that was possible- We've created "Chicken Salad Junkies" :)

W-O-W. I love chicken salad and order it often when eating out.  I've been looking for a "restaurant-quality" recipe for some time, and this is certainly it.  In fact, I'd say it's better than any chicken salad I've had in a restaurant.  I did make a few changes: I left out the celery simply because I'm not a fan.  I also left out the raisins because I thought they were bit redundant with the grapes.  I used red seedless grapes instead and increased them to a heaping 1/2 c.  I used walnuts instead of pecans just because that's what I had on hand.  You can't go wrong with this.  It's best the day after you've made it... Day 1 is great but not at its best and by Day 2, it loses a tiny bit of its luster.  We had it with croissants.  YUMMY!!!

This salad was REALLY good - and has potential to be the best chicken salad ever! We omitted the grapes, but followed everything else exactly. I found it a bit on the dry side, but I wouldn't want to add more mayonnaise. So, next time I will add 1/2 cup plain low fat yoghurt, and mix it with the mayo.

I've been looking for a recipe that tastes similar to the curry chicken salad that Starbucks sells and this one was perfect! I don't usually like fruit and meat together, but in this salad I love it. I added couscous to the recipe...even better.

I absolutely LOVED this recipe!!!!  I served this to 20 woman at a baby shower and it was a huge hit.  I used red grapes, more curry than the recipe called for, and I made it the night before (these were all suggestions in reviews) and it was AWESOME!  I made wraps with it.  I have the last little nibble in a bowl in the fridge right now...waiting for the craving so that I can enjoy the last bite :-)

My husband and I thought this was excellent!  I followed the recipe exactly except that I used Miracle Whip Light instead of mayonaise. I made it the night before we had it so the flavors would meld - delicious.  Great way to use leftover chicken.  Thanks for the recipe.  I will definitely make this again.

I love love love this chicken salad! I grill the chicken breasts on my George Foreman grill...no seasoning, just plain on the grill for 5-7 minutes. I omitted the almonds b/c I don't like any nuts in my food, but I didn't miss any flavor. I added more curry than the recipe calls for, and used green grapes one time and red the next...red is better. Also used a granny smith apple.  Put the chicken salad on a croissant and it is my new favorite lunch (and sometimes dinner).

This reminds me of a chicken salad I used to love at my favorite deli!  I used nonfat mayo and canned chunk white chicken, left out the celery and onions and substituted red grapes and granny smith apples because that is what I had onhand.  I also used slivered almonds instead because I prefer almonds in my chicken salad.  It was great!  Its definitely much much better the next day... its hard to wait but you will be glad you did!

Fantastic dish!  I was hesitant at first making this recipe.  Curry and fruit in my chicken salad sounded weird.  I was so mistaken.  The curry really enhances the flavor.  I was too lazy to cook chicken, so I bought a rotisseire chicken from my grocery store.  I took the skin off and cut the meat up in cubes.  I also added red onions and used 2 stalks of celery.  Fast and easy!  Thanks for a great recipe.

Very nice flavor combo. I left out the nuts (I think they would taste great, but I wanted to cut some calories). I used canned chicken to save time and got some pretty tasty chicken salad. Thank you!

I loved this recipe.  I used Miracle Whip in place of the Mayo (personal preference).  It probably didn't help the calorie count, but it tasted wonderful.

I was looking for a recipe similar to one that I had lost.  This one worked out great.  I cut the mayo quite a bit (also have a strong belief in using only Dukes Light).  I also used  red onions, finely chopped, something I remembered from my lost recipe.  I love this chicken salad.

This is the first time I've made chicken salad, and it came out soooooooooooo good.  I thought the stuff at work was awsome.  My fiance loved it! I added 2 1/2 tsp. of curry powder, being Indian.  I've also made a few other things from allrecipes.com and this is my only review.  Try it!

Wonderful.  I have made it twice in the past 2 weeks to rave reviews.  Not being a big onion fan, I left those out, and used a combination of green grapes and purple seedless grapes, and a dash xtra curry.  Wonderful.

This is absolutely wonderful!  I've also tried making it with mandarin orange slices instead of the grapes; different taste but also great.  It's delicious served on a toasted Kaiser roll.

I have made this several times and always get compliments. While the wife doesn't care for curry, everyone loves it when I use the same amount of apple pie spice (don't turn up your nose, just do it). Also, before the daughter left for school she asked to take some with her, so off to the grocery store for rotisserie turkey, cubed it, nice change.

Loved this chicken salad! I was looking for a "diet" chicken salad with big taste. I made a few changes to accommodate my Weight Watchers plan and based on limited time. I used a rotisserie chicken from the deli, removed the skin and fat and rough chopped the meat. Very quick and easy. I used low fat mayo which was fine because the other strong flavors came through even better. I used at least a cup of grapes because I love them, and toasted almonds instead of walnuts. I've made this 3 times now and adapt it a little differently each time.

I make this often and am frequently asked to make it again.  We even had it for my brother's wedding reception. I sometimes use dried cranberries instead of the golden raisins.  I use whatever apples are around.  Same with the grapes.  I don't always put in the pecans.  It is always good.  Plain yogurt works in place of mayo if allergic to mayo.  Please, please, please make 1 or 2 days before eating.  It tastes marvelous and you don't even have to cook on the day of the event.

Thank you so much Karen - we've definitely found a new favorite recipe in our house!  Made this almost exactly as written except used a Honey Crisp apple and regular raisins because that's what we had on hand.  Served in pita pockets.  My husband raved about it and said, "let's put this in the regular rotation."  We have made it twice in the last 2 weeks!

While I really enjoyed the taste of this salad I would question it being in a low sodium category. 3/4 cup of Hellmans light mayonaisse contains 1620mg sodium. If you buy chicken uncooked and not injected with broth then you may be okay but many chicken breasts contain up to 500mg of sodium each. I used organic chicken and cooked it in low sodium chicken broth which I cooked for half an hour with garlic, ginger, leeks, carrots and celery to flavour it. Then I added the chicken.

SHUT THE FRONT DOOR!!  This is THE best chicken salad ever. You'll need to enjoy the taste of curry though, which I do.   My spouse could not stop eating it.  Only changes I made was to increase the curry a bit, eliminate the raisins (did not have them on hand) and used toasted walnuts rather than pecans.  Oh, and due to personal preference, used more grapes and a tad more celery than called for.  This will be the only chicken salad recipe I'll need.  It is so forgiving and adaptable.  Love it!

I have made this recipe for a baby shower and a bridal shower and have always had great compliments. 
I had a few guests that couldn't eat nuts so I excluded the pecans and left out the raisins. I added more apples and celery in place of the pecans and raisins. I LOVE the taste of curry so I added in an extra shake or two and a pinch of sea salt. This is my go to party tray!! I love this recipe!

Enjoy this delicious and diet-friendly chicken salad! I've been craving a good curry chicken salad and this fit the bill perfectly. I didn't have an apple or green onions on hand, so I added some dried cranberries, which was a fabulous addition. The proportions of light mayo, pepper, and curry are just right, though I think you could even go a little heavier on the curry if you're especially into that flavor profile. I'm following Weight Watchers, so I made the serving size on my plate just a little smaller (about 2/3 the original) and it was a very reasonable points plus value for lunch. I served it on top of toasted sourdough bread with romaine lettuce and sliced tomato. This will be a regular lunch for me and I'm already thinking about picnic opportunities this spring to share it with my friends!

Super yummy! Easy and quick to make and modify. As much as I can't stand reviewers who modify the recipe and then rate their own recipe and not the original, I have to admit that I omitted the mayo and substituted Greek yogurt, same amount, and used natural almonds instead of pecans. Flavor needs to marinade so I agree that this should be made hours ahead of time or days, it's good once made but so much better when it has time to come together! Will make this part of my recipe repertoire.

I have always made something almost exactly like this. The only difference is I season the chicken with SWEET curry powder before I grill and cut up, then I use both SWEET and HOT curry powder when mixing in the mayo. The final difference is I always use 1/2 jar of Major Greys chutney and mix it in. You won't believe the wonderful sweetness and tang that it adds. Nice work!

This recipe is awesome!  I used turkey instead of chicken, which was a nice variation.  I also used a mixture of walnuts and pecans because I ran of pecans.  Great recipe - can't wait for lunch tomorrow!

HOLY MOLY!!  DELICIOUS!!  Will never make another Chicken salad again.  I made as directed, except splitting the raisins with craisins, and didn't have any grapes on hand...but they would be divine in this.

OMG! deeeeelicious!!! first time I'd ever made or had chicken salad! I had some leftover sauteed chicken breast I used, substituted the grapes for cranberries I had in my pantry and the toasted pecans for toasted walnuts in my pantry and it was outstanding! definitely added to my recipe box! (FYI toasted nuts can be accomplished easily by microwaving them for about 1 minute)

I would even recommend this recipe for someone who doesn't like curry. The curry flavor is very subtle, but really makes all the difference in this dish. I love curry, so I added a little more as well as more mayonnaise because I thought it was a little dry. Also, I added dried cranberries instead of raisins. Definitely different and a HUGE hit in my house.

Yum, yum!  This is awesome!  I love the little difference that the curry powder makes with it. If you are unsure of your liking, just add alittle less at first.  I am sure you will be adding more.  The next day is even better!

I made this for my book club group and served it on croissants from the local bakery. Everyone seemed to enoy it and I got lots of compliments. I also provided a broccoli salad and a macaroni salad and served with a nice, crisp Reisling. A great meal for a hot summer evening.

I absolutely LOVE curry dishes and this one is by far one of my favorites.  All of the contrasting flavors mingle with one another to create a delicious experience that appeals to all the senses.  I did make a few minor changes, but rather than do a diservice to Karen's recipe by making suggestions on her review based on my own individual palate, I chose to adjust the recipe to suit my own personal tastes and add it to this one as a customized version of this recipe.  Great job Karen and THANK YOU!!!  It's delicious!!!

SERIOUSLY yummy; great texture, nice flavors with the combo of ingredients.  Didn't quite let it "marry" overnight but about 6 hours - was perfect.  Really tasty recipe! I put in pitas for some, and wrapped in butter lettuce for others.  Thanks!

Best chicken salad recipe I've ever made, and I've made quite a few since I love chicken salad. Followed recipe precisely with a mixture of walnuts and pecans and about twice as much celery as suggested. Really excellent!

Delicious and easy.  I'm not a huge fan of mayo, so I replaced half the mayo with olive oil and plain yogurt, it tasted great and was healthier.  I didn't have apples, raisins or grapes, so I used tangerines and dried cherries.  I sprinkled the pecans onto each sandwich so that they wouldn't get soggy and upped the curry powder a lot, it would have been pretty blah without some extra.  All in all a nice, quick meal with the right blend of protein and carbs to fuel a workout at the gym.

This is the best chicken salad I've ever had.  Made it for my sister's baby shower and everyone RAVED about it.  Almost everyone asked me for the recipe.  Here are a few things I did:  1. I used a 3 pound package of rotisserie chicken breast from Costco.   2. I chopped up the apple and soaked it in lemon juice so it wouldn't brown.  3. I used salt and pepper along with the curry powder.    4. I omitted the grapes (I was making the salad for sandwiches and didn't want huge pieces of grapes.    I cant wait to make more...  Use this recipe- you will NOT be disappointed.

I'm eating this right now for lunch and can tell you this is goooood!!!  I used leftover roasted chicken, dried cherries instead of raisins, onion powder, no celery and almonds instead of pecans.  All of these were made because of what I had on hand.  I can't wait to taste this after it has sat for awhile and also can't wait to try it as written.

Wow, I'm shocked.  I bought SmartOnes Mayo on sale, and I thought the purchase was irredeemable.  The consistency alone makes it practically inedible.  BUT... I used it to make this recipe, and the results were wonderful!  The tastes of the curry and fruit and the extra moisture that the fruit and onion produced after sitting for 18 hours totally redeemed the mayo.  Added benefit, was the significantly lower calorie end result (the mayo is only 10 calories per serving-better than low-cal regular mayo...and lower cholesterol).  I changed the contents a bit based on what I had on hand.  I eliminated the raisins, pecans, celery and green onions because I didn't have them.  I added a Bartlett pear and used red instead of green grapes.  Tripled the curry powder and added a large white onion, finely diced.  Previous reviews indicating that leaving the salad overnight allowed flavors to blend were totally accurate.  Depending on the freshness of your fruit and onion (mine were on their way out/not totally fresh)  the consistency of the salad next day is a little runny.  To fix this, I just added more chopped chicken, apple and onion.  The results were amazing, and there wasn't a drop left.  I served over organic romaine lettuce.  You know the recipe was a success if you made an overabundance, and the dish is still practically scraped dry!  Thanks Karen, the recipe is a keeper!

I loved this chicken salad! Soooo tasty with the curry and sweetness of the grapes, apples, and raisins. I used roasted chicken from the grocery store. This was perfect to take to work for lunch, scooped into a container on top of baby spinach. It was quick, healthy, and yummy.

SWEET PETER!!  My taste buds are in heaven!  This gets 6 stars.   By far, my favorite recipe I have gotten on this website.   And I haven't even let it sit over night.   I loved it right after it was made.  Only changes i made were more curry, more mayo and a little salt.   You MUST try this!  :) Thanks for the recipe!

Add me to list of people who served it and got multiple requests for the recipe!  I did dried cranberries instead of golden raisins since it was for a holiday party.  I then left out the apple just because the cranberries seemed to add enough fruitiness with the grapes.  I didn't really measure the mayonnaise, just added to taste.   Thanks for a yummy chicken salad!

I don't know how everything goes together so perfectly, but it's delicious!  It has 5 stars out of 5, that's impressive!  I would recommend it to anyone.

This salad is delicious and taste better if you prepare it a day before eating. I used cream and mayonnaise in equal parts.

I served this for a lunch and it was a big hit. The flavor of the curry was great! I didn't put any nuts in because my granddaughter has a nut allergy but it was great without. I agree with a former review to have extra mayo-curry to mix in before serving.

Delicious!  I didn't have grapes, so I just increased the other ingredients instead.  It was tasty the first day, so I can't wait until later when the flavors have had time to mingle.

This was the best chicken salad I've ever made or eaten. A big hit! I used a rotisserie chicken and cut the mayo in half with fat free plain yogurt. Also doubled the curry. Can't wait to take it to my next pot luck!

I love curry chicken salad. This one is nearly perfect--it was just the ratios that I thought were off. The ingredient list is superb. I added more fruit and vegetables than the recipe called for and cut the chicken into rather small pieces. I used half plain greek yogurt and half mayonaise and used quite a bit more than the recipe calls for. I also doubled the curry powder for more flavor, and did end up adding a couple dashes of salt.

This was a good recipe, but not quite a five-star.  I liked it the first day better, because the pecans were still crisp, and turned a little soggy by the next day. It could have used a little more flavor in the dressing--a little tang--maybe salt, more curry,  maybe using Miracle Whip rather than mayonaise would have given it that lift. It did have lots of nice ingredients and was interesting, but don't think I'd make it again.

For some reason, I thought all the glowing comments for this recipe must be exaggerations.  That was before I tried it myself.  They are not exaggerations.  This is truly excellent.

I've made this a couple of times now and each time it is fantastic! I always use dried cranberries instead of raisins and red or green grapes. Either works. A little more curry doesn't hurt either. It isn't overpowering at all. Much better the next day after the flavors have marinated together. Delicious!

After peeling the apple, I shredded, rather than diced it.  I made a couple of substitutions:  water chestnuts in place of the celery and a small Vidalia onion (shredded), instead of green onions.  I also added 1/4 cup honey to the mayo.  The completed salad was refrigerated over night and was absolutely fabulous!

I made this for dinner then took the leftovers to work for lunch. I used a Granny Smith apple and didn't measure anything except the curry powder. I probably used less mayo than specified this way. This will be making regular appearances in my lunch box this summer. Thank you.

This recipe was so good. I think I will add some more pecans, but that is because I like it a little nutty. My husband loved it and he was a bit skeptical because of the fruit. We had it on whole wheat pitas. I will be using the recipe for a baby shower luncheon. Perfect fancy party food, but it is so easy. Oh, and to keep the fiber - don't peel the apple :).

pretty good, but didn't blow me away like it did some other reviewers.  I put in more 50% more curry powder and I still didn't taste much curry, maybe I need to use a different type of powder.

Delicious! Used others' advice on waiting for a couple of days before eating.  Gone in one sitting!  Local grocery store didn't have spring onions so did without and it was fine. Used rotisserie chicken.  Added about 1/2 a teaspoon more curry powder as well as well as replaced pecaaaans :) with cashews.  NICE!  Will make again!

REALLY good recipe. I use regular mayo, and way more than what is called for to make it creamier.  I also use craisins instead of raisins, add more curry powder, and walnuts instead of pecans.  I think next time I'll try cashews, as I've had it that way at a local deli, and it was great.

I have made this recipes four times now and everyone loves it. I do make my own variation, but the idea came from this. I like to put a whole chicken in the crock pot in the morning and let it cook all day. Then I use the entire chicken for this recipe. I have different veggies and fruits, but it all comes out great. Thanks for the recipes!

Great recipe... doesn't take 45 mins to make though.  I also eyed most of the ingredients going into the salad (axact amounts not neccessary in a salad) and added diced cucmbers.

Wonderful. I love this...I used red seedless grapes instead of green (great color)...also used canned white chicken - worked great. Tastes like something you would buy in one of those pricey gourmet deli/cafes. Will definately make again and share with others.

Delicious!  I did use regular mayo, not low fat, since that's what I had in the house, so mine wasn't as healthy as it could have been, but it was very, very good.  I will definitely make this again.

This is out of this world,  I've served this on several occasions both for luncheons and a light dinner.   Each time someone has asked to go home with the recipe.   I serve it on Croisants.

tasty and excellent. easy to switch things around depending on what you have in the house. you can add different kinds of nuts, like pecans or walnuts, leave out the apple and raisins, etc. I also had some garam masala spice that I used instead of the curry powder (use less) and it tasted excellent.

I thought this recipe was excellent!  Next time I make it, I am going to add some seashell pasta and serve it as a cold pasts salad.  Would definitely make it again!

I made this for my daughters wedding tea.  I cut the crusts off the sandwiches once they were made and cut them into triangles. They were a big hit, and several people wanted the recipe. Make sure you refrigerate overnight for full flavor.

Not sure how to make it better...have made it before exactly as written but also made today substituting roasted salted cashews for pecans for a little salty intensity to offset  the sweetness.  Also I use scallions instead of onions and always make it a day in advance as it improves the flavor 100%

It was okay but was not very spicy so I added jalapeno bacon and it helped a little. If I make it again I would add some spices like chili powder or paprika. Also pickles would really help.

I upped the curry powder by about 2 tsp, and it was still not overpowering. I subbed dried cranberries for the raisins, which would have been fine also. I used a Granny Smith apple, and also added a little sour cream, and a bit of white wine and hot sauce. Tried a little now, and it was delicious! Will be better after flavors have a chance to meld, I'm sure!  UPDATE 7/22/18: Followed recipe exactly this time (still more curry powder, though), using golden raisins. Half recipe makes a lot.

This was a simple, easy and delicious meal. I added about a tablespoon of my favourite chutney to the mix which gave it that extra kick. Thanks for posting, I will definitely make this again.

Although I changed a few things, I just wanted to express my gratitude for this recipe.  I opted out of the curry because I just wasn't in the mood for it and used leftover turkey, but the combination of apples and grapes and nuts with the meat was so so so good! Thanks for giving me a recipe to tweek to my preferences.

Fabulous recipe. I make this chicken salad, with chopped Granny Smith apples,  and enough mayo to blend to the consistency I desire. Sometimes I will also add sweet relish. Everyone always raves over this. Great with crackers, as a sandwich, or on lettuce served with tomatoes. I never use curry. This chicken salad is better after it's cold, or the next day, when all the flavors have married.

Oh, Mama!  This is so close to Mom's that I will be using this recipe as a great substitute.  Unfortunately, it was one of those situations where you say "I really need to ask Mom to write down this recipe", and then it was too late.  She did add a bit more curry, but my DH doesn't care a lot for it, so this recipe provided a happy compromise.  And, yes, IF it lasts, it is better the second day.  My I Hate Curry! husband kept going to the fridge for "just a snack", "just a nibble", "just a little more" that the next time, I will have to make it and somehow hide it in the fridge.  Thank you, Karen!  DH says "This one's a keeper!"  And so do I.

From a chicken salad hater, I make this recipe all the time! I do a very few minor modifications. I roast the chicken breasts sprinkled with ground white pepper for 40 minutes. Never, ever, use canned. I then shred them, instead of chopping them into cubes. I also add more grapes than called for (1/4th a cup), but cut them into quarters instead of halves. I also let the recipe sit in the refrigerator for a couple of hours as previously recommended. I may add a little bit more curry.  I truly, truly, despise traditional chicken salad, but the curry and fresh ingredients make this recipe delightful. I serve them in whole wheat pita pockets with mixed greens serving as "lettuce" in the sandwich. I don't eat traditional chicken salad ever, but I eat this repetitively and make it for guests with a savory salad to balance the sweetness of the sandwich! Thanks to Ms. Baker for redefining chicken salad.

Yum! I was craving it as soon as we polished it off, and I look forward to making it again. I used regular (not golden) raisins, and red grapes. Skipped the nuts because of a nut allergy. So tasty!

For years I've purchased curry chicken salad from the PCC Market and thought it would be magical to be able to make my own. This recipe has just a little sweet and spice to introduce chicken salad tradionalists to something fresh. Destined to impress.

I made it this last night and had my coworkers try it- they loved it! I used 2 13 oz can of white chicken meat and add all the ingredients as is except I added 1 tsp of the curry and craisins to The mix. I let it sit over night and it was so wonderful and even with 1 tsp of curry you can barely taste it!  I have family from out of town visiting this weekend and I plan to make it again, this time with a rotisserie chicken!

Excellent recipe, and a good base upon which to branch out.   I resisted the temptation to add more curry.  1/2 tsp seemed scant, but it is perfect.  More than that and it can start to dominate.  With the curry spice a little more elusive, it really makes this recipe.   I've tried it with dried apricots in place of raisins, granny smith apples, walnuts, black grapes, canned chunk white chicken, and more.   I think the pecans work better than walnuts.   I also tried it with reduced fat mayo and yeah, it works that way, but it is not the same.   Whatever you do, be sure you let it sit overnight in the fridge before serving.  It completely changes the taste profile.

This was delish!  Grilled chicken on stovetop.  Used Fuji apple.  Made in the morning to serve at dinner.  Got rave reviews.  Just had a thought - cashews would be good in it, too.

I've never been a fan of chicken salad with fruit in it until now.  This is so good.  It's the perfect combination of flavors.  My husband said it might be the best thing I've ever made - haha! But he did eat it after a long hike and was so hungry!  Only changes I made was regular raisins, red grapes, and I smoked my chicken before throwing it into the salad! We ate it on croissants. This made enough for dinner and lunch the next day (so 4 large adult meals).

Pretty good. Refreshing taste. I didn't want to cook chicken, so I used canned chicken. I used lettuce as a wrap for the chicken salad.

Scrumptious!  I had to fight my husband to save about a half cup of salad for lunch today... I really would like to see if it's better the second day.  Don't see how that's possible.

Served it in the middle of beefsteak tomatoes cut into wedge flowers... 

Pretty, fast, and oh so yummy.  It's a keeper.
-------
So good I wanted to rate it again!  Delish with coconut sprinkled on top.  Next time we'll use the leftovers to stuff an avocado for lunch.

This is my fav chicken salad recipe, and it's very easy to modify to your taste/what you have on hand. I use this chicken salad as a lunch option for my kids at school, so they aren't always eating sodium-packed deli meat everyday.. For use at school, I omit the nuts and use sunflower seeds. If I happen to make it on a weekend for eating at home, I usually use walnuts (for the omega-3's/our own preference). I follow the recipe exact, but I use a little less mayo, and at the end I squeeze some fresh lemon juice on it, throw in a bit of fresh chopped parsley, and mix well. I make it the night before, so the flavours marry overnight. I usually stuff it into a pita, sometimes with some chopped romaine.. or make a wrap out of it with a whole wheat tortilla.

I made this today for lunch, it's fabulous! The only changes I made were using craisins instead of raisins, and I used a rotisserie chicken. The curry adds the perfect flavor! I can't wait to try it later on, after the flavors have "mingled". I highly recommend this recipe!

This came out really good! I did everything as stated. I saw some comments that said the curry was to strong...all I can say is that thoes people must not have liked curry at all, because it was so faint, but it added exactly what was needed...in fact, next time, I  think I might add a little more. I also did not peel my apples, and this came out good!!! Thank you for a great recipe!

I LOVE this salad! I make it using the leftover chicken from this recipe: http://allrecipes.com/recipe/simple-whole-roasted-chicken/ and it's SO full of flavor! Substitutions: I use Craisins instead of raisins, toasted almonds instead of pecans, skip the grapes, and use either Gala, Braeburn or Honey Crisp apples. It's a favorite summer meal for my family.

I have made this many times and it always turns out great, but sometimes better than others. As with so many recipes, this one would be better if it stated the weight of chicken and other ingredients rather than descriptive amounts like “4 chicken breast halves."  The size of a chicken breast varies significantly, and without knowing exactly how much chicken to use the results vary significantly too.  I think the recipe tastes better with double the stated amount of curry, and the flavors are, as so many reviewers have stressed, always better if you make it the day before you want to eat it. Also, for a healthier version of this recipe, substitute low fat small curd cottage cheese for all but 2 tablespoons of the mayo, and it still tastes great with less fat and calories.

I made this vegetarian.  You heard me right.  Just tasted it fresh made and rating it a five, can't wait to serve it tomorrow.  I used Naked Cutlets of vegetarian chicken substitute that I cut in small cubes and seared in the pan.  I at least doubled the curry powder because I love kick, and subbed cranberries because I hate raisins.  This is a perfect balance of color, texture, and flavors in harmonious contrast.

I absolutely loved this recipe! Although many reviewers said to wait a few hours for the flavors to settle, my husband and I couldn't wait for it! I thought it was amazing as soon as it was finished. I used McCormicks "Hot Madras Curry Powder" because I think it tastes more like yellow curry (which I prefer). The curry with the fruit was an amazing combination.

Crazy good!! Curry was just right! Had craisins on hand in stead of raisins, real mayo and didn't have grapes, but they would have only made this better! Baby, hubby and I gobbled it up! 3 year old loved making cracker sandwiches with it. Even better the next day!!

This recipe is absolutely FANTASTIC. I love the grocery store curry chicken salad and wanted to try my own. I also prefer a little more veggies in my chicken salad than most commercial recipes use. All I can say is... WOW. I, like many others, substituted Craisins and preferred a tad more veggies (8 green onions and 4 stalks of finely diced celery) and thought it needed a little more curry than the recipe calls for but could not believe how good this was! I poached boneless chicken breasts in lightly salted water, the salad component is such a nice complement of flavors you don't need to do much with the chicken - I bet it would be even better with a rotisserie chicken. Even without sitting in the fridge for a day I could have eaten up all of it! SO SO GOOD, try this if you like curry and you will not regret it, this is definitely a keeper! Thank you so much for posting!

I make this exactly as instructed and it is amazing!  I've had people say they don't like curry and love this salad.  And I had one person tell me that he could not have imagined this combination of ingredients and he loved it too.  Then my son wrinkled his nose at it and when I was looking, ate MY pita and asked for another!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I used rotisserie chicken, red grapes, dark raisins and regular mayo.  After it sits in the fridge for a few hours I always add a little more mayo.  I always add salt too, it seems to enhance all of the other flavors.  I can't stop eating this chicken salad!!

This was a wonderful dish.  I loved the flavor the second day. I made a few  changes to the ingredients:  Red grapes instead of green, raisin medley instead of golden raisins, red apples instead of golden delicious apples.  Those ingredients were changed because that is what I had on hand and it tasted fine, a total hit!  However, I remember wishing the curry flavor was a little stronger, I added a slightly rounded 1/2 teaspoon and I feel that it could have used even more.  Also I would have added a little more toasted pecans, raisins, celery, and grapes.  Too true that this is a tasty AND healthy dish. Thank you for sharing!

Tasted this immediately after it was made... my first thought was... aww, c'mon, there's no reason to wait to eat this until tomorrow. Gave the Fiancee a taste... and even though she's giong to lunch tomorrow with a friend, she was thinking "Chicken Salad is ok to eat for breakfast, right?"... Phenomenal. I did use Shredded Chicken in place of diced... no big difference there.

Incredibly flavorful!  Used walnuts because I didn't have pecans. Everything else just as the recipe called for. Turned out wonderfully!!!  Fixed it really early in the morning so it was refrigerated for @ least 4 hours before eating. I kept the nuts separate to sprinkle on top of the salad so they would stay crisp. Also my parents have trouble eating nuts (false teeth) that way they could skip the nuts for easier eating. Couldn't find a golden delicious apple so I used a pink lady. This salad was amazing and we will most definitely put it in regular rotation in our house hold. It yielded 8 sandwiches on hard rolls. Highly recommend this salad!

Perfect recipe for the summer! We had a potluck birthday lunch at the office and many women wanted this recipe! The few modifications I made were to increase the quantity of the grapes, raisins and apples and not use as much mayo.  It was VERY refreshing. Thanks for a great recipe!

I RARELY rate a recipe but this is the BOMB. Such a great combination of tastes and textures. I made it exactly as directed but had a rotissiere chicken which made it so quick and easy. I've made it with a good quality canned chicken (2 cans) and it was still delicious. Thanks for the delightful recipe.

This is a great recipe if you follow the recipe exactly.  Our family does change it a little for our taste...no nuts and a little bit more curry powder.  It makes a great summer dinner in a sandwich or on a bed of lettuce.

How is this SO good?  I made a small portion to test out before making it for a bridal shower.  All the ratings say make it the day before so the flavors can mix...but I can't stop eating it, so I don't know that I'll find out what it tastes like the day after. It's that good.  I never would have thought of putting curry in, but it is so yummy!  Thanks for the great recipe!

My three children and husband really enjoyed this salad inside pita bread with romaine lettuce. The only change I made was adding some shredded carrots and I used red seedless grapes rather than the green.
Truly a delicious twist on salad ;)

Great recipe! I didn't have any raisins, but it would have been even better with them.  Next time I will add the raisins and dried carnberries. I do not like nuts so I left those out.

Wow!  This is the best chicken salad I have ever had.  I love that I already had most of the ingredients on hand and that it was super easy to make.  I also used Craisins instead of the raisins to bump up the flavor and color of this amazing dish.   I served it a couple of hours after I made it on 12 grain bread and it was delicious. Thank you!

amazing! i didnt add the curry because i dont like spicy stuff. but i just eyeballed everything to my liking and it came out perfect. i definitely recommend refrigerating it first as that is when the real flavor comes together.

I made this last night, following the recipe to a T, but replacing the pecans for walnuts. It is AMAZING. I can't wait to serve it at my luncheon today!!! Not only that, but my very food savvy husband thought it was the best chicken salad he's ever tasted. Thanks for the great recipe!

For a more intense flavor add more curry powder. I also added pineapple tidbits and slivered almonds  (instead of the pecans). Yummy!

Delicious! I made barbeque chicken breasts in the crock pot. For fruit I used dried cranberries (1/3 cup chopped) and one red delicious apple (chopped). I used red onion instead of white and used about 1/3 cup of chopped pecans.

This is a great chicken salad recipe. We grilled the chicken breasts seasoned with salt, pepper, and a garlic onion seasoning blend. The only substitution we made was swapping out the raisins for craisins. Definitely recommend leaving it in the fridge for at least a day so the flavors meld and intensify. It was delicious.

Wow!  I absolutely love the taste of this salad.  Not only did my husband and daughter love it, but I brought it to my British neighbor, whom I've shared lots of meals with, and this was the one that she raved on and on about.  It's so delicious, I plan on making it for our faculty lunch.  One thing I did differently is that I used my Pampered Chef chopper to chop the onion, celery, apple and pecans very fine.  I also used white onions rather than green onions.  I will do it exactly the same next time- you've gotta try this!

After throwing the ingredients together and trying a bit off the mixing spoon, I exclaimed to myself.  Surprisingly delicious and easy.  Can't wait to dive into it after it sits in the fridge for awhile.  I also think it's important to get a good curry powder that you like.  There are some curries I've had that, I think, might ruin it.  I used a new kind from World Market and it's so perfect here.

This is really, very , very good!!  My husband and I were pleasantly surprised at how much we liked it.  It was so flavorful and light and just overall delightful.  I served it on top of salad leaves.  I also only added a handful of raisins and didn't even remember the celery.  Really good and refreshing!

My mother in law is carribbean and really enjoyed this curry chicken salad. She makes curry all the time so if she liked it, I could feel good about it. But it was absolutely delicious. I included everything that the recipe asked for and will definitely make again.

absolutely wonderful!  The only thing I did different was add a dash of salt to break up the sweetness, it was perfect and we ate it all in the same day! Served it in a pita pocket with a side of fresh fruit, hummus and pretzels! Thank you for sharing this will fast replace my other chicken salad recipes!! :)

This is my favorite recipe for chicken salad. I've made it several times now, and it's always a little bit forgiving based on what I have in the pantry/fridge. I have used fat-free mayonnaise with success. Try it!

This is so delicious. I used more than double the curry, because I love it so much. My kids weren't overpowered by it, so I think the amount listed in the original recipe is too little. I didn't measure anything else, and just added until it tasted fantastic. And it sure did!

I added 2 cups of cooked pasta shells and increased the dressing a bit, as well as doubled the curry powder. Everyone raved about this dish when I brought it to my brother's place. There was a bit left over, but they wouldn't let me take it home!

After reading the reviews, I think I was expecting something with a little more punch, but it was definitely the best curry chicken salad recipe I've made. I used only half of the mayo it called for and then used non-fat yogurt for the rest, which may be the reason for some of the lack of flavor. I doubled the curry in the recipe and that's a definite must! Also, the golden raisins and pecans really make it. I do love the fact that it's light and seems healthy!

3-1/2 stars. I made this recipe for a small get-together and those who tried it were very complimentary.  I ended up using way too much celery (misjudged "a stalk") which i think took away from the salad as a whole (I'm not a huge celery fan).  I honestly didn't find that the salad had a lot of flavour.  If I make this recipe again I will be using a bit more curry powder--and less celery!  On a whole though, a very good chicken salad (if you like chicken salad and curry).

My family really enjoyed this dish, even my VERY picky kids liked it.  I omitted the nuts since we're not really a "nutty" family.  I added an extra stalk of celery to make up for the loss of crunchiness.  Mmmm....this one is a keeper.

I made this recipe for a brunch recently and it was a huge success! Everyone raved about it. The only thing I changed was that I added a little more curry powder, but otherwise it was great.  I made it a day ahead of time as well and like the recipe says it helped the flavors meld.

Next time I will add some spice.  I expected the curry to give me more flavor than it did.  I even doubled the amount suggested.

Fantastic. The only thing I did different was to sub some of the light mayo for fat free sour cream and added a few drops of balsamic vinegar. YUM! Will definetly be making this again.

Very good!  I sauteed the onions lightly first, only because I don't like raw onions.  I substituted plain yogurt and a little lemon juice for the low fat mayo to make it a bit healthier.  Delicious!

Definately a keeper. I made this for a few friends at lunch and everyone wanted the recipe. After making several times I did make a few personal changes as it's a versatile recipe and lends itself to individual taste easily. I substituted the apples, raisins and celery with dried cranberries, chopped seedless  cucumber and papaya chunks. For the dressing I increased the curry, added  mango chutney, a little fresh lemon juice, cayenne pepper and yogurt (no mayo). Just prior to serving I added chopped toasted almonds. This was served on a bed of baby butter lettuce and pita toast strips. This recipe does NOT need any changes as it is delicious as written. The changes are personal preference.

This was very yummy. My picky fiance and picky toddler both enjoyed it. I used a little bit less mayo then called for because my two don't care for mayo very much. I also added some sliced almonds and dried cranberries. These are great alone or stuffed into whole wheat pitas.

one of my husband's favorites!  I've omitted & added different nuts, fruits, whatever I have on hand.  I always use more curry, maybe 3 or 4x's the amount in the recipe. I like mixing in dark meat and if I only have white meat, I poach it.  Took this. in mini pita pockets from Trader Joe's, to a picnic & they were gone in minutes!

Fantastic.  Wonderful NEW way to use chicken and I am so thankful that you shared it with all of us.  I am leaving it overnight.  I did it exactly as mentioned in your recipe.  No need to change anything except salt and pepper to taste.  Beverly Jane

Yum! I used what I had on hand (substituted rotisserie chicken, craisins, red onion). I love the sweetness of the fruit with the chicken and the pecans add a great crunch. And so quick to put together! Made again for a party with my less-than-adventurous family and was shocked to see it disappear.

A great palatte for you to create your own creation of a curry salad.  Very simple which is great for busy people like me and impressive twist for an ordinary salad.  I would increase the curry to 1 tsp for every 2 chicken breasts.  I like curry a lot and so does my family so i add the extra amount.  I also agree with another member to just eyeball the vegetables.  That way it's catered to how you want it to taste.

This was great, I used regular raisins plus some dried cranberries, and walnuts instead of pecans.  It was great on grilled rye with lettuce and thin slices of avocado.

Excellent recipe. We often eat this in pitas or add a little more of the mayo/ spice mixture and add spiral pasta for a pasta chicken salad. The great thing is that you can vary the ingredients to your liking and it still tastes great.

For once I made a recipe exactly as stated.  After chilling overnight as suggested, I served the chicken on croissants.  I found the recipe to be okay, but not spectacular.  The blend of flavors were unique, but not something we went wild over. I think it is better served over some lettuce versus as a sandwich.  The cost of this recipe adds up too.  Probably won't make again.

I love this recipe!  I made it for my (very picky) fiance and even HE loved it.  I added some roasted cashews and it was delicious.  Very good in wraps and pitas.  I want to make this again to take on a picnic.  Thanks for a keeper!

This turned out *really* well. I didn't have grapes or golden raisins, but I added chopped dates and dried apricots. Also added a little more curry powder and some red pepper flakes. Sent it to work for H with pita bread. Thanks!

Very good and so easy to make. After tasting what I made today, next time I think I will add a bit more mayo- no more than 1/4c.  I would also use 1/4 less on the celery and apple. When I made this recipe today I used a chicken that was roasted by the grocery store.  So that made it really easy.  Yum!

FANTASTIC!  I hate celery, so I didn't add it.  I happen to love whole wheat pasta shells and also had some chopped walnuts left over from another recipe, so I dumped some of those 2 things in there.  Will make again and again!

Really good twist on the chicken salad.  I made it a day ahead and took it to a shower.  Big hit.  Left out the celery and added more grapes and raisins.  Also, used almonds instead of pecans.

Hmmm... not quite sure what I missed on this one. I did make some adjustments based on what I had in the kitchen, but I don't know if that my problem. It turned out really bland, even after a day. I'm going to add some more curry to the remaining salad tonight and see if tomorrow's lunch has any more kick to it. The changes I made:  discovered I had a bag of chicken thighs and not breasts, so it was dark meat. No green onions, but a pack of fresh chives that needed to be used. I threw in some mango instead of grapes because a) that's what I had and b) I was shooting for the Starbuck's curry salad taste anyway. And lastly, I used my Thai red curry paste instead of mild powder, although I still used more than the recipe calls for. It ended up too mayonnaise-y and with no kick. I still have high hopes, so hopefully I can find the right tweak.

This Curry Chicken Salad is simply wonderful. It is officially on my list of FAVS and I will continue to make it over and over. I did change a few things to my taste.  I omitted the green onions and raisins altogether, used Miracle Whip Salad dressing in place of the Mayo, used diced unpeeled, but seeded Granny Smith apples and I changed the Curry powder to 1 tsp.  IT WAS GREAT! Thanks!

This was really yummy and quite easy to make. I did however change the recipe a tad. Like other users, I used candied pecans; I also used a granny smith apple and regular raisins. If you really like curry, I would add more curry powder. VERY good!

Very nice recipe. I brined the chicken breasts and then broiled them, which made the meat ncie and uicy. I used a Granny Smith apple and I'm glad a did because the tartness is a nice contrast. Regular raisins and walnuts worked fine for me. I think that in the future I will use yellow onions instead of green onions for a bit of a stronger flavor.

This is such a delicious and easy recipe.  I added more curry powder, which I think is a must because the amount they tell you just doesn't give it enough flavor in my opinion.

Very easy and tastefull. I added a bit more curry, and used craisins in stead of raisins. I suppose you could replace some of the mayonaise by using yoghurt, to make it a bit lighter. I added some baby greens, and had a nice entree.
Definately a keeper.

Searching for a unique chicken salad recipe, I tried this one...it was really good.  Certainly better the day after preparing it.  I think next time, I'll add a few more grapes to make it a bit fruiter.

This was delicious!  I made it with ready-cooked cubed chicken breast and added a bit of juice from the canned pineapple I served with it for creaminess.  It was the best chicken salad I think I have ever eaten and the whole family loved it! Will definitely make this again.

This is a recipe that I've made for years... but I prefer Miracle Whip to light mayo... and I triple the curry.   I agree with the person that said that the onions do not seem to add to the dish.  So I leave them out.   I really does need some time in the fridge for the flavors to do their magic.

Great dressing. Like most, I substituted what I had on hand - rotisserie chicken, red grapes, walnuts etc.  But the star is the curry mayo. Just try it.  OMG can’t wait to make it again.  Thanks for a wonderful and simple recipe.

Excellent, even with faux chicken called "soy curls."
I added curry powder, and substituted the pecans for sunflower seeds and served it on triscuits; yummy!

I cut-up leftover chicken I previously cooked with lemon pepper......  I soaked (in a little water) then drained some dried cranberries....  I cut-up a leftover apple and squeezed some fresh lemon juice over it and the cranberries.  Toasted the pecans in the oven for about 15 min after spraying with some veg oil. (300 deg). ....Added extra curry, black pepper and a splash of lemon juice to some Duke's mayo.  After the toasted pecans cooled, I cut them up and mixed everything together 
( chopped celery and dried minced onion since I didn't have green onion).  I'll let everything sit in the fridge til tomorrow and will taste for salt later.   This looks like a keeper !

This is awesome!  I had to make some substitutions the first time I made it because I didn’t have everything I needed. It was fabulous that way, and it’s fabulous this time as written. Although it’s very good the minute it’s made, it’s much better after sitting in the fridge at least overnight.

I took out most of the fruit because my husband doesn't like fruit in his salads. But I kept in the apple to add the sweetness. I chopped it pretty fine so he probably didn't even realize it was there. I used my favorite type of apple instead of Golden Delicious, Honeycrisp.
I used the breast from one of those rotisserie chickens you can buy precooked. I always end up with breasts uneaten from those since the white meat is dry compared to the dark meat. While the recipe calls for four breasts, I only used two, but they were very big when taken directly from the whole chicken.
I made my own mayonnaise with avocado oil... YUM I can eat that stuff plain.
I tripled the curry and it gave a really nice curry flavor, which my husband loves (it was for a Father's Day picnic), and a rich yellow color.
I also did not add the nuts as he doesn't like nuts in his salads.
He went crazy over it. This recipe made a lot, and as I had made several other things, we had a lot of left-overs. He was constantly munching on the left-overs until they were gone.

Very good, I subbed a Granny Smith for the Golden Delicious, walnuts for the pecans, regular mayo for light, and black raisins for golden, it's what I had on hand. I love curry, quadrupled the amount ( 2 teas).  I diced the meat off of a rotisserie chicken. Very easy and fast to put together.  It does improve the next day! Will definitely make again. Thank you for a delicious recipe!

WOW!!! I made this for my neighborhood 4th of July picnic. I had some of this salad and loved it! I we stayed there for a while and when I went to get the bowl to take it home, the salad was all gone! I made it without the green onions and it tasted amazing! I highly suggest this salad!!!!

Used 1 cup of mayo instead of 3/4 (since I like my chicken salad on the creamier side) and used walnuts (since that's what I had on hand) but other than that, followed the recipe exactly as called for and it was delicious. The taste is curry is very subtle. I made croissant sandwiches with green leaf lettuce. Amazing..

Absolutely delicious! I used craisins, a gala apple, chopped red grapes and omitted the bits b/c I didn’t have any. I think toasted pine nuts would be divine in this. So, so good!

This was wonderful. But I substituted red seedless grapes and regular raisins and a green apple as well as a lot more curry. I felt it needed some color. Everyone that has had this has raved about it. Thanks for introducing me to this.

I love this recipe and make it whenever I have a craving for curry. I usually use a bit more curry then called for and letting it sit overnight brings out the flavor.

Superb as it is--the 24 hr wait  is amazing in what it does.  The pecans do add another dimension (as well as being the healthiest nut out there),  For variety,  an avocado thrown in robes it in velvet. I agree with the comment by Sarah on 6/11:   "Creamy, chewy, crunchy, rich, salty, sweet....A million stars! :)"

Used as an app. On croissants that were halved horizontally then halved again into more bite sizing. As many advised this recipe greatly improves with time. 2 or 3rd day its wonderful.

Basically made it as written and it was delicious.  You can vary how much curry you use based on how potent it is.  I used McCormick powder from the can and found I needed to use more than the recipe suggested.  

The pecans and green onions add a lot to the flavor and balance out the sweetness from the fruit.

I really like this salad for a quick and easy meal, wrapped in flour tortillas along with baby greens.  I season the chicken breasts with salt, pepper and garlic powder and bake for better flavor.  I also sub toasted, slivered almonds for the pecans and red grapes for green.  I also mix together 1/2 the mayo with plain yogurt  to make it a little more healthy.  You definitely want to make this early in the day or the day before to allow flavors to meld.

This is an awesome recipe! I made it exactly as written so I could give a fair review on it. Next time I would add: a little more mayonnaise, some cream cheese, more grapes, more chopped nuts, another apple, and about 1 small can drained crushed pineapple. My husband loved it! We’ll see how my older boys love it, for we have lots of leftovers.

The only change I made to this recipe is in using red seedless grapes rather than green, to add colour interest. 

I have made this several times over the last few months, because this has become quite the family favourite!  Delish!

I would have given this four stars when I made it the first time because I could barely tell there was curry powder in it.  The next time I made it I increased the curry powder to 1.5 tablespoons (yes, a LOT more) and this one's a winner!

I have made this a few times now, it has been a big hit. However, I have used toasted sliced almonds and Granny Smith apple (skin on). Also, I have found that it takes a bit more mayo than the recipe calls for if you want it to stay within two slices of bread; but if you eat it as a salad, in a pita, or with some bread crisps, it is fine.

Delicious as is, but I liked it even more after substituting craisins (dried cranberries) for the raisins and drinking the amount of curry powder. It's true it gets even better the next day.

This was great!  I didn't have raisins and I didn't have enough mayo so added some plain greek yogurt but other than that followed the recipe.  It does taste better a day or two down the road.  Love the fruit and toasted nuts .  This is a keeper!

Very good. I modified it though. I used an entire roasted chicken (so good for tender chicken). Replaced grapes and raisins with craisins (definitely enough sweet with just craisins and apples). I also used regular mayo, regular onion and walnuts instead of pecans.  Everyone has raved about this when I make it. I have heard "best chicken salad I've ever had" from several people.

I will make again because I'm surprised it wasn't as raved about by family as expected. Even served it the next day. Would adjust by chopping some ingredients smaller and serving on croissants as mentioned.

I really enjoy this recipe. I make a batch on Sunday and pack it in small containers for my husband and I. Doing so allow us to have lunch for about 3 days. You should definitely give this a try.

Absolutely I'll make it again. I had Chipotle chicken breasts on hand, so I used those & left off the curry powder. I don't care for nuts, so I left those out. It was wonderful!

Holy cow this is good. I always like to try a recipe as it is written but in this case I couldn't .. I had regular raisins instead of the golden. I used a 'non-golden delicious apple' and didn't toast the pecans. And I cut back on the curry powder. HOWEVER-it was delicious! Great recipe. Thankyou!!

WOW! Yes, yes, yes! Nice, crunchy texture with a perfect blend of sweet and spicy. Even better when chilled over night. I did use Miracle Whip instead of mayo, plus a tbsp. each of whole milk and white vinegar, but I know that is a debate more controversial than politics. A touch more black pepper and curry if you like a little more spice and I lightly seasoned the chicken with a lemon pepper blend while cooking.

This is a great sandwich. I use red grapes instead of green. They look better and no raisins. Also add alfalfa sprouts.

This is delicious! I used a whole chicken I cooked in the crockpot over night. I didn't have raisins but used craisins instead. It definitely needs to sit overnight.

Fantastic as written.  The second time I made this, I subbed almonds for the pecans with equally good results and also upped the curry (but that is just my personal preference).  I'm not a big mayo fan, so I tossed in just enough for the salad to "hold".  The crunch of the celery and nuts added to  the  sweetness of the apple chunks, raisins and grapes, and the zip of the curry make for a perfect mix.  I served this in a whole wheat wrap.  It tastes even better the next day, after the flavors have had a chance to blend.   One of my favorite recipes on this site.

I had to do a little substituting and it turned out great!!!  Awesome chicken salad.  I used some smoked chicken I made the day before, craisins instead of raisins, toasted walnuts instead of pecans  and Miracle whip instead of Mayo.  Will definitely make again.

Made this many times. I tend to add extra curry because my family loves curry. Nice blend of tastes and texture. Crunchy with sweet and spice. I generally eat it the next day to allow the flavors to meld together.

I loved this recipe! I have food allergies, so my mayo is Veganaise, and I used cashews instead of pecans, a pink lady apple instead of golden delicious, and dried cranberries instead of raisins. Very impressed- I'll be making this again! Thank you so much for sharing!

I agree with other reviewers who said it's better after a day. Not a fan of curry, I substituted tarragon and kept everything else the same. I also soaked the raisins in hot water for 15 minutes to help them plump.  Excellent recipe - thank you!

I had some leftover rotisserie chicken from the Baked Buffalo chicken dip that I made to bring to a Christmas party and thought I'd give this recipe a try.  Left the ingredients as is except for the pecans since we have tree nut allergies.  My wife and I absolutely loved it!  I buy Curry Chicken salad from the local market from time to time and this  blew it away.  I'll be making this again for sure!

My husband, who is not a curry fan, loved it.  As stated by others, flavors do mellow when made ahead....I made it in the morning for supper that night.  I  doubled the curry, as I thought it was a skimpy amount.  I used walnuts and rotisserie chicken from the grocery store.  Will definitely make again...probably will become a ‘go to’ recipe.

Thank  you so much for this recipe. My husband loved it. I did not have any pecans on hand, so I used walnuts. I will be making again for sure. Next time I will use pecans.

I will be making this again.  I had to use walnuts instead of pecans and it still tastes fantastic.  

I also used dark and white chicken that was grilled last night with a light flavorful rub on it (boneless thighs and breasts).

Awesome!  Here's a cheat.  I used canned fruit cocktail, drained.  Perfectly acceptable.  I added some strawberries.  I also added a prepared chopped salad.  This one had cranberries, pumpkin seed and a fruit flavored salad dressing.  I reduced the mayo to 2 large tablespoons because of the added dressing.  Poppy seed or ginger dressing would be nice too.  Finally, I added blanched, slivered almonds with the pecans.  I use Rajah curry powder.  It comes in different formulas.

I added extra curry and substituted cashews for the pecans. Because of the other reviews, I made it the night before a picnic and then served it on brioche rolls. The flavors were definitely better after it sat overnight. It was a huge HIT! I even got a text the after the picnic from one of my friends saying that she was STILL thinking about those chicken salad sandwiches!

Easy and fun prep. The curry is such a clever addition. I was slow to accept fruit in my chicken salad but this was truly delicious and guilt free.

I left out onions and celery, subbed craisins for raisins and red grapes for green, and forgot to toast the pecans.  Served in a wheat tortilla.  Kids and husband were not fans (not chx salad fans in general), but I liked it.

My Hawaiian husband loves curry and he said " broke da mout, bra!" Didn't have nuts, so I used honey roasted sunflower seeds. It was amazing. Flavors expand even more the 3rd. day. It's on my serve often list. Wonderful.

Made a tone of it without knowing if it was good or not.  Lucky me, it was awesome.  I ate it all week for lunch and dinner.
I did change the recipe a little.  I left out the raisins, added extra red grapes, apples  and pecans.  I also use rotisserie  chicken (all of it, not just the breast, but left out the skin), already flavored no extra salt or pepper required.

This is great, love the addition of the curry, I added more than what was called for. Used dried cherries as that is what I had on hand. Great on a bed of lettuce or croissant. I will make again.

I've been making this for years, only difference is I use toasted slivered almonds instead of pecans and I serve it in a hollowed-out half cantaloupe.   Cantaloupe and curry were made for each other in my book.   Very refreshing when eaten together.  I often add a few drops Sriracha to the mayo for a little interest.  My hubby often wants this for dinner on a warm summer evening.    Good stuff!
P.S.  Cut a slice off the back of each cantaloupe half so it sits upright (like a bowl) and doesn't roll around on your plate.

This was SOOO good! I'm not a huge fan of mayonnaise, and this has the perfect amount. I would never have thought to put curry in chicken salad, but it's really good. Can't wait to taste it tomorrow after the flavors have blended.

The curry really adds a whole new taste.  I used what I had in the house, dried cranberries, apples, celery, and pecans.  It's very easy to substitute what works best for you.  I will definitely use this recipe again!  Thanks.

This is almost an exact copy of a recipe I use all the time, except that I use chopped pistachios in place of the pecans and I substitute nonfat Greek yogurt for the mayonnaise. If you have half a green pepper left over from another recipe, it makes a flavorful addition.

I have made this a dozen or more times. I usually omit the golden raisins and use walnuts and red onion instead of pecans and green onion. I also salt and pepper my chicken breasts  well before baking. I add more curry powder, not much, a pinch.  Today I added craisins and used pecans. Yummy!

THE best chicken salad I've ever had. I made it according to the recipe with the exception of leaving out the raisins and using regular mayo. And it definitely makes a difference to prepare it a day ahead. Very hard to put the fork down!

I love curry so I use much more than the stated 1/2 tsp and a little more mayo to keep it moist. I use dried cranberries rather than raisins too. This recipe tastes even better the day after making it if you have any left over! Great recipe.

We loved the blend of flavors.  The left over roast chicken I had included both white and dark meat.  Apple was a Gala.  I chose to lightly chop the very large golden raisins and the grapes into fourths.  As others noted, it gets better in the fridge.  Will definitely make again.

This is absolutely fantastic - thank you so much for sharing.  Our family loves this! My husband says it's the best chicken salad he's ever had and my 11 year old son said it's his favorite sandwich period.  I can't wait to share this with others - Wonderful!

The best chicken salad ever! the curry in the mayo nailed this for me.  I used walnuts instead and skipped the grapes.  But next time I will make this I will definitely add the green grapes. Love it!

This is my favorite chicken salad recipe. I have made this more than a few times since I found this recipe a few years ago.  The only variations I have ever done with this is using craisins instead of raisins. Prepare this at least a day in advance because the ingredients really do need to meld together.  My husband, children  and friends absolutely loves this!

Wow! This is been our go-to chicken salad recipe for months now. The flavor enhances after the salad sits in the fridge, so I have found that if I make it the night before without the grapes and then add grapes right before I serve it, the flavor is best.

Soooo good!  I've made it many times now. Family loves that tasty curry and they aren't all that into spice. I modify it with leftover Thanksgiving turkey and it's just as good.

I bought a roasted Chicken from PUBLIX (mojo style) hot, let it cool till room temp and then constructed this recipe. Warm to room temp on the chicken I find accepts the wet ingredients better.
I mixed the Mayo, Curry Powder, Black Pepper  in a seprate bowl first to adjust the seasoning. I also added a small amount of Cayanne Pepper for  an extra punch. Good Recipe

I added dried cranberries as usually add dried cherries in place of the raisins.  Did not use the apple this time. Awesome every time even without the curry. First time for touch of curry and everyone at my bridge luncheon loved it!

This chicken curry salad gets rave reviews from reluctant tasters. I roasted a whole chicken prior, doubled the curry and used cashews.This recipe made a lot of salad for finger sandwiches for a picnic, next year I can half the recipe! Definitely making this again!

Like other reviews said, this gets even better the 2nd day.  I made some minor changes, but they add significantly to flavor and texture:  since Delicious apples usually are anything BUT delicious, I used a Honeycrisp apple instead.  For color, and also because they are smaller, I used currants rather than golden raisins.  I prefer the flavor of finely minced red onion over green onions, so I used that instead.  Since I used my own spice mix curry powder, it has no added salt, so I added a little salt to the recipe.  The amount of curry powder called for in the recipe seemed like a very small amount, so I used significantly more--experiment with the amount of curry seasoning until it is just the right amount for your own taste.

Delicious for dinner on a hot evening - only changes I made were type of apple (and un-peeled) green & red grapes, added WAY more curry - maybe 1/2 a Tbsp -, and used low fat yogurt to replace 1/2 of the quantity of mayo. The recipe made enough for the 2 of us for 2 evening dinners, and a lunch-time sandwich each. Will be making it again this week, and will up the curry quantity even more this time  :)

This is a keeper!  Since I live in a hot climate I'm always looking for no-cook dinners.  I used the package of cooked chicken breast meat from Costco, and it was delicious.  Regarding the comments about too much curry, I'd say it's a matter of taste and how fresh your curry is, so adjust the amount of curry accordingly.  The curry flavor does come out after it sits for a day or so, but in my estimation that's a plus.  I served a scoop of this salad on a bed of lettuce with a tiny bit of poppy seed dressing on the lettuce.  The perfect summer dinner!

This was good but really needs to be adjusted for different sized chicken boobs or specifying the chicken by cups. I used only 4 large breasts and everything else didn't have enough. Next time I'll double everything but the chicken.

I made this with some slight changes, it was definitely 5 star, even on the first day. So the changes were, instead of golden raisins I substituted craisins, instead of using pecans I used walnuts and I added a bit of mustard and celery seeds, and a boiled egg for flavor. I have one critique the recipe calls for 4 chicken breast, but there are no instructions on how to cook the chicken.  I thought of boiling them and finally decided on baking them which included seasonings; salt pepper, garlic powder and Montreal Chicken Seasoning, this also altered the flavor of the salad.  However, in the end it was altogether good.  The surprise was that I actually enjoyed the grapes and apple bits which I was added with much trepidation

We really liked this recipe on a hot day. Good over lettuce too. It sermed a bit bland, probably due to my older supermarket curry.

Ok, the 2nd time I made it, I at least doubled or even tripled the supermarket curry. We loved it!

Loved this! I had frozen chopped chicken so it was a snap to put together.
I am not a huge fan of raisins so substituted a can of mandarin oranges. I  will definitely do that again. 
This recipe is a keeper and I can imagine making it many times.

Delicious, perfect to serve for lunch.   You can play around with the recipe a bit if you'd like, or make it exactly as written (which I did, pretty much).   And yes, definitely give it a little time before serving for optimal flavour.

Really one of the easiest chicken salad that I have made.  Even quicker done with a food processor to chop us the veggies and apple.  I'm not a big fan of curry flavor so I omit this from the recipe, also left out fresh grapes, still tastes delightful good.  Very good for parties bites when paired with croissants.

I left out the pecans & celery to make it more palatable to my grandkids.  It was good this way & I would make it again with or without these ingredients.  We ate it out of a bowl rather than as a sandwich.

I didn't have green onions, golden raisins, or green grapes. I just used what I had on hand which was Yellow onion, regular raisins, and red grapes. I also used 1 tsp. of curry because I like my food spicey. 5 stars! This salad hit the spot, and is a total keeper. Thanks for the recipe!??

I can't say enough good about this recipe!  I made it yesterday and had to have a tad to compare to today.  It was good yesterday and absolutely awesome today.  The curry was perfect for the recipe.  The whole thing was perfect!  I used walnuts because I always have them on hand and full fat Hellman's but didn't mess with anything else.  A word of advice when assembling.  The chicken can vary so much in size.  With any recipe of this sort that has a homemade dressing - I put all of the secondary ingredients in a bowl and add the dressing and then I gradually incorporate the main ingredient (in case the chicken) so that I make sure it is not to dry.  I just used the leftover chicken for something else.  Can't wait for lunch tomorrow and all the girls want the recipe!

I first made this recipe a few years ago and it's my very favorite use for leftover chicken. I always add more curry than called for, because I love it. It's also very good if you substitute plain yogurt for the mayo. Either way, definitely let it sit at least a few hours before serving, overnight is better. After the first few times, I have been making it from memory, and somewhere along the line I omitted the apples. Still good. Made it again yesterday and before I realized what I was doing, I had grabbed ginger instead of curry and added it in...so I added the curry on top of it and mixed it up. Fortunately, they worked together and this was still delicious! Thanks -

Used Kirkland canned chicken, almonds instead of pecans (don't like em), excluded the onions (don't like em).  Ate the whole bowl for lunch then dinner with a spoon!  Yummy thanks.

Give 1 star to help fix the average. I would give a 3 as you can eat and i see people liking it with lots of mayo. I have got here looking for curry taste along with the fruit taste. Had to go 2 tsp to star tasting the curry. I found it dry and asking for salt. I am not a mayo fan, and I found the mayo dominated the taste.

Absolutely fabulous!! I've made it a few times and love it every time.   I like the flexibility of this recipe.  I've used different kinds of onions (white, purple, green),  apples (Fuji, gala, honey crisp)  and grapes (green, red, black)  and regular raisins.  I never put in nuts -  simply because I don't like nuts in my salads   I use full fat mayo because that's what I have on hand.   It has been good every time!!  This has become my  "go to" chicken salad.

It's one of the best chicken salads I've made.  I don't think that the curry is too much, and might even add more next time.  Also, I didn't need all 3/4 c of the mayo.  I did about 1/2c and added a couple more tablespoons of plain yogurt.  Will make again.

Phenomenal!  I love it because the main ingredient isn't mayonnaise.  The fruit made this recipe.  Used Craisins instead of raisins because that's what I had in the fridge and I doubled the amount of grapes. I will make this again and again and again! !

Yummy! Always a good thing to have handy in the fridge. I unfortunately had to omit the grapes and apple (I was out) but I doubled up the celery, golden raisins, and added walnuts too. Solid recipe.

This is soooo good.  Only thing I did differently was;  I rubbed my chicken with olive oil, salt, and pepper and baked it at 350 degrees for 35-40 minutes then chopped it in the food processor.  It was perfect.

This was really tasty! I followed the recipe exactly as written and me and all 4 of my kids loved it. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because I felt like it was a tad bit dry. I may add a little more mayo the next time I make it.

I made a few changes out of necessity.  I didn't have toasted pecans, so I added walnuts. Added some plain yogurt and poppy seed dressing to the mayo because I had some already mixed. And lastly, I used a granny smith apple since I had one on hand.  It was wonderful, but I'm sure the original recipe would be delicious!

Curry powder makes it tasty.  No green onions so used red onion, no golden delicious used Fuji, and no nut, no green so used red grapes.  Still turned out okay right after but needed some salt and more mayo. Can't wait to see what it tastes like tomorrow.

Wow!  I expected to love this recipe based on the ingredient list, as well as all the positive reviews.  I was not disappointed at all.  Made wraps with whole wheat tortillas and piled some lettuce in with the chicken salad.  I'm sure this will become a lunch time staple in our house.  DO make it a day ahead, as the flavors definitely changed and improved overnight.  Consider adding chopped dates, or subbing them for the raisins.  I tried that, and I thought the flavor of the dates was an especially good pairing with the curry.  I think a little more heat might have been an improvement, but it may be because I used the "Mild Curry Powder" from this site.  Next time, I'll still use the mild curry powder, but I'm going to try adding some cayenne to the chicken salad.  I'll also consider the pecans optional.  They are good, but also high in $$ and calories, and the apples add plenty of crunch.

Mmmmmm....  wow.  I love this!  I added a can organic chicken breast, and a big spoonful of mayo was plenty.  I sometime top this over spinach and add a just a tiny bit of balsamic vinaigrette over the top.  It seems like this can go with any salad, or even in a wrap.  This is going straight to the classic box.  Thank you for sharing!

Exactly what I look for in a chicken salad. I made this with a rotisserie chicken and you would never know the difference.

This is a delicious recipe without changing a thing.  I have been known to use canned chicken to save time, dried cranberries instead of raisins, and/or to add chopped carrots for color.

Great chicken salad--very similar to another recipe on this site that I really like. I like to use dried cranberries instead of golden raisins; it offsets the color next to the green grapes. I like the green onions in this as well.

It is really good. I added some more spices including ginger, tarragon, turmeric and cumin and subbed plain nonfat greek yogurt for the mayo. It has a nice kick and I will enjoy making lettuce wraps for lunch. My 12 year old decided it was too spicy for her though. I also used curry paste instead of curry powder which probably made it a little spicier than usual, but I love red curry.

I accidentally used Cumin instead of Curry, and it was outstanding! I guess I just invented a new recipe. I did not use the raisins because I used dark red grapes. Very good, thanks!

Seriously SOOOOO GOOD! I didn't have any nuts or raisins and it was fine without. I used 1/2 cup miracle whip instead of mayo and 1/4 cup poppyseed dressing. I've been eating it in lettuce wraps and will definitely be making again.

This is fantastic, made it for a picnic lunch and it was VERY tasty!  Not being a pecan fan, I used walnuts instead, and I used a Honeycrisp Apple instead to give it that nice sweet/sour bite.  Delicious, will definitely keep using this recipe!

We definitely love this recipe! Seems like the most important ingredient is the curry. I use less chicken and 3 stalks of celery, 3 finely grated carrots, 1 apple, 3/4 cup Trader Joe's Golden Berry Blend (Golden Raisins, Cherries, Cranberries & Blueberries), 1/2 to 3/4 cup Black Seedless Grapes finely sliced, Glazed Pecans, and no onions. I have found that mixing this in my KitchenAid stand mixer on low helps make it juicier and breaks down the chicken to a more shredded consistency. Thank you for this awesome recipe Karen!

I used leftover baked chicken (honey-mustard-curry).  Didn't use the apple, but did use everything else (except curry powder, since it was already in the chicken).  It was awesome, as sandwich filling, and then as salad over chopped garden lettuce.

My Husband, Son and DIL all raved about this recipe.  I even got a "This is the best chicken salad I have ever had".  I agree it was great made just as it was written.  I cheated a little by using a store bought rot. chicken.  Oh well.  This was fast and easy.  I served it with big croissants from Sam's bakery.  Thank you for giving us this recipe.

Followed the recipe exactly except I decided to put a little kick on my chicken. I marinated sliced up breasts with olive oil, garam masala, tandoori masala, and some chili powder. Gave it a good Indian twist to enhance the curry powder. Grilled that stuff up and shredded it. Wonderful recipe.

this is the only chicken salad I will ever make!  I substituted ripe mango for the grapes (that's life in the Rio Grande Valley) with great success.  I think many different fruits would do well, so don't be afraid to experiment

DO NOT MISS OUT ON THIS ONE!  the only thing I did was add about a fourth of a large jicama cut into small cubes for a little extra crunch.  Otherwise I didn't change a thing.  I poached boneless, skinless chicken breasts in chicken broth and coconut milk.  Served with crisp, homemade pita chips.  An absolutely perfect chicken salad with a freshness to die for.

I have made this many times and it's so delicious that I end up eating half of it before anyone can get to it!  The curry powder and the crunch of the apples is unique and really makes the dish.  People think it's crazy when you tell them the ingredients by it all works!

This was delicious! I made it the day before and the curry mellowed to make the salad flavor sweet and not obnoxious. No one in the house is really fond of curry flavor, but found this to be quite delectable, using the exact amount specified in the recipe. I used a Fuji apple because that is what I had in the fruit bowl and walnuts instead of pecans.  I added the walnuts just before serving the salad so they didn't become soggy. The golden raisins and green grapes complemented each other nicely. It's simple to prepare and good to make in advance.  Served it on red leaf lettuce and it was the perfect meal for the heat wave we are having this week in Southern California.

I am not a fan of sweet and savory mixed together, I won't eat sweet and sour chicken or any other combination of that kind of flavoring. That being said, This is the GREATEST chicken salad I have ever had. It's phenomenal!!! I didn't have golden raisins so I used dried apricots and I didn't use celery. This is a keeper, and I might be a changed woman after trying it. Thanks Karen for posting it!!!!! Also, boiling the chicken breasts in broth and adding a bit of curry to it made the chicken moist and flavorful.

I made this chicken salad for a picnic today and nothing but full tummies and smiles on my friends faces! I made a couple of changes. Instead of just using the 1/2 teaspoon of curry powder, I seasoned the chicken breast with a coconut curry powder so if you like curry this will definitely give it that Carribean taste I was looking for. I also just used regular raisins, red and green grapes and miracle whip light. I will definitely make this again. Thanks!

I used shredded turkey breasts instead of chicken and unsulfered, unsweetend dried apricots (diced) instead of raisins.  Came out great. I'll stuff pita with the salad for lunches tomorrow.  Will definitely make again.

I really liked this recipe!  I had cooked a whole chicken on my upright indoor rotisseri, using a rub that I put together that included curry powder.  Afterwards I used the left-over chicken to make this recipe, and am I ever glad that I did.  I used all of the ingredience listed, with the exception of the apple.  I did not have any onhand.  However, I did not measure any of them.  I probably used a little extra Mayo.   This is the first time that I had ever used curry powder in chicken salad.  My husband Jim, and I loved it!  I did chop up the raisins, and I used small sweet onion instead of the chopped green onions.  This is an excellant recipe and I will be sharing it with my friends.

I was so excited when I came across this recipe! There is a place I used to go that had a curry ckn salad sandwich that I loved and this tastes just like it!  I used canned ckn and hoped that it would still be okay/tasty and it certainly was.  I also adjusted to 2 servings (since I only had one can of ckn) and let it sit for a couple of hours as suggested in other reviews.  Made a sandwich w/wheat pita bread and it was delicious! Looking forward to having the rest for lunch today.

I don't quite understand all the hype. Yes, this is a decent chicken salad. Is it the BEST chicken salad? No, probably not. I like curry, and I love grapes, so I was expecting a little better after seeing all the positive reviews. There is also a lot of prep involved, and I'm just not sure it's worth the effort.

Served this for a girls' luncheon and got rave reviews.  Put it all together the night before, candied the pecans and tossed them through just before serving.  Served it on croissants with a garden salad on the side.  Sent the leftovers home with the girls for their hubbys dinner and even got a request from one of the hubbys to serve at a family luncheon.  Definitely keeping this one and sharing with everyone.  Thanks so much!

I'm not a huge fan of chicken salad but this is very good.  I used reduced fat mayo.  My GF, who is a huge fan of chicken salad, really likes it, so that says a lot.

SO good!  I didn't think it had enough curry, so I added more.  I also used a green apple, skin on, craisins instead of raisins and about a cup and a half of grapes (1/3 of a cup of grapes??).  I'm going to try this next time with greek yogurt instead of mayo...

Use any fruit/veggie combo you happen to have lying around. Mid-summer I made it with sweet cherries and ripe mango, and it was fantastic. A brilliant recipe.

This is a wonderful and easy recipe. Feel free to make substitutions. Also, if you want a vegetarian option, or just less meat, use maftoul couscous (this is the larger couscous - about the size of small pearls)

I agree with other reviewers, best chicken salad I've eaten!  I followed the stock recipe pretty close but it would be easy to eyeball measurements for most ingredients and add a little this or a little less that to modify it.  but as is the ratios and ingredients are perfect too.

Absolutely fabulous! I had never tried light mayonnaise before, and was worried about that, but I went for it and LOVED the result! I'll be making this very often. I ate leftovers for days and didn't tire of it. :)

Absolutely gorgeous salad, went over with rave reviews from a lunch I served today...  I did change a couple of ingredients strictly for my own personal taste... I used red grapes instead of green, and pine nuts instead of walnuts... I boiled a whole chicken for the meat... other then that it was same as recipe and fantastic...  Have already been requested for a repeat performance in the future.

Our FAVORITE chicken salad recipe!  A lot of chicken salads I've had in my life are very basic: celery, chicken, mayo, onion types.  The fruit and nuts and curry in this make this off the charts as far as the world of chicken salads goes!

The curry and all of the fruits and nuts give this chicken salad a delicious twist. I didn't have golden raisins but it was yummy without them.  I will make this again for sure.

I've made this several times and it's delicious every time. I keep thinking it would probably be even more flavorful if refrigerated overnight, but it never lasts that long. Who would have thought of curry?? Serve it in a pita and it's fantastic!!

Wonderful lunch.  I plated the salad on lettuce.  Everyone asked for recipe - a good sign.  Forgot to include toasted pecans, but these weren't missed.  I did increase apples to 2.

WOW, The only changes I made was using craisins instead of the raisins, and I did not use light mayo.  This is the best chicken salad ever.

I've been working on more of a paleo diet and ridding my diet of processed food.  This recipe is pretty close to being paleo and it was delicious!  I used dates (didn't have the other fruits on hand), and regular onions (didn't have green).  I also grilled the chicken.  It was so delicious and I will be making more and keeping it in the fridge for my lunches!  Thanks for the quick and easy recipe.

This is so delicious and refreshing! The only part I hate is waiting for the flavors to mesh until the next day, but I eat it anyways and it still tastes great!

Very delicious, only a couple of changes.  I used dried cranberries instead of raisins, I used red grapes instead of green, and I used gala apples instead of Granny Smith.  I like my chicken salad sweet.  The curry powder was a great addition!

I love this chicken salad!  Absolutely delicious and got rave reviews.  The next time I make it I will add a bit more curry.  The curry flavor is very mild as is, and I'm a big curry fan.

I love this recipe, the only thing that I do different is, I substitute almonds for the pecans (allergies), peas for the raisins (family hates raisins), and I use a store bought yellow curry sauce from Trader Joe's instead of the mayo and curry powder (I keep it on hand anyway).  I wonder how this would taste with dried cranberries, my family loves those.

This got rave reviews when served recently- however, I did have to adjust ingredients. My breasts were meaty, thus I needed more mayo (about a cup more) plus more curry & I left out both the raisins & apples (raisins we don't like- and apples would have browned before prep for my purposes, though I know the flavor would have been good, presentation is necessary!)

My family just loved this chicken salad! A few changes I made was to grill the chicken breasts and cut them up after cooling. I also substituted reduced the amount of mayo used and it still had amazing flavor when you let it sit overnight.

yum yum yum. I didn't follow the proportions at all, and I used almonds instead of pecans and swapped some of the mayo for plain yogurt, but I'm still giving it five stars. my favorite thing to do with leftover chicken.

This is the first time I have ever made chicken salad and am very pleased with the results.  I used 2 cans of canned chicken.  I didn't have any golden raisins, so I used Craisins as others and it was delicious.  I will definitely make this again.

Delicious!  Did change it a little, but as one reviewer said, this recipe can be adjusted to what you like.  Added granny smith apple, omitted green onions and used onion powder instead, used a mixture of oriental curry powder and tandoori curry powder...best chicken salad ever!

After reading the great reviews, I made a double batch of this for a huge carry-in for women.  It was a hit!  I added a little more curry, but that is a personal preference.  The fruity, crunchy, chewy, salty, and sweet flavors really make a flavorful salad.  After seeing the final product, I will garnish with parsley next time.  Chicken salad is tasty, but not very pretty.  Thanks for sharing Karen!

Very yummy chicken salad.  I used nonfat greek yogurt though to save on calories and I just like the flavor.  And used water chestnuts just because I like those too :)

Excellent. To save myself the labor I used a food processor (I also prefer the finer texture). Everything in at once except for the apple and grapes, which chopped chopped/sliced by hand. I added a tablespoon of fresh parsley and a teaspoon of paprika. I didn't have pecans so I used almonds, which they did the job, and I also used some dark red grapes for their wonderful color to contrast with greens of celery, apples and parsley. Perfect in a croissant with romaine and sliced tomatoes. Tasty, easy, and very pretty.

Excellent recipe.  i improvised a bit and added walnuts instead of pecans.  i didn't add apples or gapes, but did add craisins.  i made this in the evening and let it sit overnight in the fridge to absorb all the flavors and it was delicious.  For the chicken, i cut the boneless breast into chunks and boiled it in chicken broth.  i recommend this recipe.  great with a side salad and couscous.

Great chicken salad recipe for those of us who are constantly trying to find a way to make chicken breasts less boring.  I did use regular raisins, red grapes, and a Honeycrisp apple.  I would make again.

I just made this, and it tastes amazing. Tomorrow it will taste even more flavorful.  I used almonds instead of pecans, yogurt for the mayo, and about doubled the curry powder. It's sweet, tart, and a little spicy all in one fantastic dish.

I made this for the first time for an HH/FB luncheon at my work.  EVERYONE loved it - ate every bit.  I only had mixed nuts, and I put some dried cranberries in too

Love this recipe! Chicken Salad fans who aren't afraid to mix things up a bit should try this! I like it with Miracle Whip instead of Mayo for some extra sweetness with less fat. Yum!

So tasty and healthy!  I used fat-free mayo, and didn't notice any difference because there's so much other good stuff in there.  It was very good the day it was made, but even better the next day.

So sorry, this recipe did not work for us . I added everything except the nuts, the curry was overwhelming, I guess we are sensitive to certain spices and my kids did not like the raisins or the apples in it. I will keep searching for that perfect chicken salad recipe. The reviews were great for this one. Maybe I will give it a second try and change it up a bit. Thanks

I used this for a baby shower and it received rave reviews. I decreased the amount of mayo due to reviews saying it was too wet. Bad move on my part as I ended up adding more the morning of the shower since it was very dry (at least to my taste). The salad was a hit - raved about actually.

We love this salad. We try changing little things every once in a while... Raisins... additional veggies... but it is always fantastic!

A great twist! My young son doesn't like nuts, so I omitted them.  I also used mild curry powder to ensure it wouldn't be too overpowering for him.  The whole family gobbled this up.

This was fabulous!  I added/subtracted ingredients to suit my taste (2 chicken breasts instead of 4, 2 stalks of celery instead of 1, 1 cup of grapes instead of 1/3 cup).  Because I used fewer chicken breasts, I decreased the mayonnaise to 3/8 cup and used 1/4 tsp. curry powder.  I served this on a bed of torn Bibb lettuce.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Yum -this was excellent. I didn't have green onion so I subbed dried chives. Really tasty!
