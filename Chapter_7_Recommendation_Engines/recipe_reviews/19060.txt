This was a good way to use up a lot of asparagus.  The only changes I made was to use "no salt added" swiss and I used 4 eggs since I didn't have any egg substitute.

Thought if was very doughy tasting. I like my quiche with a lighter, fluffy filling and flaky crust.

This recipe was amazing. I made it exactly as described, no modifications. I didn't bank on the clock; when the surface started to brown, I performed the knife test. I did make sure to use Emmentaler brand gourmet swiss cheese though (which can be found in the gourmet cheese section at most grocery stores) rather than a generic brand. Delicious and healthy!

I made this with ham, broccoli, and 
cheddar. I also used part egg whites
instead the full amount of egg substitute.  Was really good even the
the next day.  Thanks for a good basic
low fat recipe.

Turned out beautiful (that's why I'm submitting a picture for it).  The only thing I changed, was I partially cooked the asparagus first, and happy I did.  I didn't want to take a chance that the quiche would have "crunchy" veggies!  Turned out great!  Light and tasty!

We enjoyed this, even w/o the bacon.  I parboiled the aspargus cuts first to soften, should have done it to the onion also.  I used an Italian cheese mix and it came out wonderful.  Can definitely see it on a brunch table or w/ different veggies, like broccoli or ham.

Mmmmm very good!  I did have to put it back in since the middle was still pretty gooey at 35 minutes; that was my fault because I didn't check with a knife.  I followed the recipe exactly other than par-boiling the thicker pieces of asparagus for a few minutes until bright green and using cheddar blend cheese because I had it on hand.  I saved some of the asaragus and bacon for the top.  Thanks for this delicious recipe.

Make this right now! Its soooo good! We omitted the bacon (for health reasons) and cooked down the onion so it wouldn't be crunchy. The second time I made this I used Red Lobster Cheddar Bay biscuit mix and it was simply divine. We also used eggs instead of substitute. Thanks for a wonderful dish!

Definitely tasty, and very simple.  My picky eater even said it's a "repeater"

This is a nice, flavorful take on a traditional quiche. This dish was not heavy at all as one reviewer posted. I had really thin asparagus, but I could see how partially cooking the asparagus first might be necessary as another reviewer posted. Thanks for the recipe, Anna!

A bit "doughy" but I found I didn't miss the crust at all. This was wonderful!
I am amazed at how many avoid the bacon for "health" reasons...this amount of bacon for a whole pie is not bad at all for your health and none of my colleagues think this is on the "avoid" list as is written. Overall, a winner.

I thought this was delicious! I would double the onions next time and add a bit more cheese. VERY EASY!

Very tasty. Since there were only two of us, I halved the recipe and used a smaller oven safe dish. I did saut√© my onions in the bacon drippings before adding them to the quiche. I did not precook my asparagus. It cooked just fine as the quiche baked.
