This recipe was well liked by my hungry boys!  We will definitely put this on the 'to fix again' list.  I did change very little after reading a few of the reviews.  I cooked it on low only 5 hours, then put the ramen noodles in for the last hour-but, left it on low for that time.  I used the seasonings called for and it was not at all too salty.  I would not use garlic salt instead of garlic powder, that would probably make it too salty.

I used the "healthy" low-fat/low-sodium soups, omitted the butter, and used only 2 of the 3 noodle seasoning packets (dietary considerations); my family rated the recipe a "keeper" - high praise from the boys!

This recipe was great!  REALLY easy to make and a good first impression on a first date!  (I left out the garlic and onion powder for good reason!)

I believe that this could be construed as "Chicken a la King" in some areas of the world.

I used 3 nests of angel hair pasta substituted for the ramen noodles. 

It came out creamy, thick, and very rich.  Great with some crusty French bread and a bottle or two of cold white wine.

This was absolutely delicious.  The chicken was so-o-o-o tender.  I cut the recipe in half - except I did use 2 cans of the cream of chicken soup, 2 pkgs. ramen noodles & only 1 packet of the ramen seasoning.  I placed the chicken breasts (whole) on top & cut up in pieces before the last hour of cooking.  Will definitely make again!

I used 3 breasts, 1 can of cream of chicken soup, 1/2 c. water, 1 tsp. garlic powder, the frozen veggies, 2 pkg. Ramen noodles, and followed the directions for preparation.  It turned out very good.  Suprisingly my 18 mo. old who eats everything was ho-hum but my picky 3 yr old loved it-hubby, too.

Very good in concept, but next time I will use a package of egg noodles instead of the ramen noodles and use the other spices with some Tony Chachere's seasoning because it was too salty for us.  So...no ramen and no ramen seasoning will make this recipe a 5-star.

I thought this recipe was great however I did change a few things which made it not salty at all.  Well I put two can of mushroom soup and 1 can of chicken soup.  Salt free butter.  1 packet of seasoning. Fresh onion and roasted garlic from a jar.  1 can of water and 1 can of milk.  Made it not so thick at the end but then I added some cornflour to make it thicker.  Worked a treat.  Thanks Sue

Very good!  Great easy recipe for rushed days, simple and down home comfort food.  I used spaghetti noodles instead of Ramen (all I had) and seasoned with Johnny's Salt, garlic powder and ground pepper.  Also topped with crushed leftover Tim's Cascade Jalapeno Chips before putting in oven.  Will make this agian, thanks for the recipe Sue.

I used reduced fat/reduced sodium soups and halved the recipe.  It was slightly salty, but my family loved it!  There were no left overs!

This recipe was terrible!  I used 2 ramen seasoning packets as suggested by other reviewers and it still was way too salty and I just didn't like the flavor.  I was very disappointed.

I really liked this dish.  So did the kids.  Mother said it was too salty.  Husband said it was too bland.  Next time I will use the low sodium soup and maybe add a few extra spices for flavor.

Very good and easy recipe.

This had potential until I added the noodles.  It got pasty and gross!  I will try again next time cooking the noodles seperate and spoon chicken mix over top.

Perfect for a busy day meal. I used canned chicken and added about half a pound of frozen broccoli (tastes good and adds color). Used only two of the three noodle seasoning packets. Added a cup of milk because it was a bit too thick. Because I used the canned chicken, I only cooked it 3 - 4 hours on low. Added noodles during last half hour. My three grandkids ate it up, and so did my husband. A keeper for busy days!

This recipes was so so. It was very salty and the Ramen noodles didn't fit in correctly. I may make it again with my own twist. I would not use the Ramen noodles at all. Maybe without the noodles in the slow cooker, but pour the chicken mixture over plain noodles or rice. Just a thought.

In a word: salty!  I cut back to only 2 of the ramen noodle seasoning packs, but it was still way too salty.  You can't really cut down to just 1, because there are other seasonings in those packs other than the salt.  The answer must be to use lower sodium cans of soup.  Those soups are designed to be diluted with water or milk, and in this recipe, no additional liquid is required.  I ended up adding a bit of water at the end, which helped a little bit with the saltiness, and also helped with its way-too-thick consistency.  I used frozen chicken breasts right out of the freezer, and they were perfectly done in the 6 hours (put on high for first 30 minutes, then switched to low).  I took them out and cut them into cubes while my ramen noodles were cooking.  The noodles only took about 15-20 minutes, then I added the chicken back in.  Will attempt this again due the ease of it.

I made some changes due to what I had on hand.  I used frozen peas b/c I was out of mixed veggies. My chicken was precooked  so I added a can of broth and also a can of cheddar cheese soup to offset the cream of chicken flavor.  This addition did not make it a cheese sauce at all, just  masked the  canned flavor, oddly enough.   I did toss in some Old Bay, poultry seasoning and herbes de provence.  When it was done I added some water to thin it some and set it to warm while my french bread was in the oven.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

After reading the reviews I made this with only 1 of the ramen seasoning and added a little black pepper.  Fed two families and everyone loved it.  TIP: I used the leftover ramen seasoning (1/3 packet to 4 eggs)as my seasoning in scrambled eggs the next day and my husband said they were the best scrambled eggs ever!

Definitely a filling meal and the taste over all was good but very salty and thick. I think I could have done without the Ramen seasonings altogether.

This was very tasty. I did make some chaqnges though. Instead of breasts I used thighs because thats what I had(plus they are cheaper) and skinned and de-boned them, I used fresh small white onions, about 4, diced up and put in 4 packages of ramen crushed at the end, but only two packages of seasoning then cooked on low for 6 hours then put the Ramen in and cooked another 20min. everything was so tender and delicious. My boys ate it up. Deffinetly a keeper in my house thanks for the recipe :O)

This was an easy recipe to prepare and pretty good. It was a bit salty for my liking but it can be modified by adding 1 or 2 of the ramen spice packets instead of 3. Very kid friendly, my 1 1/2 yr old who eats like a bird was begging for more! Thanks so much Sue!!!!

Too salty, and not much flavor otherwise, even though I tried some of the tips of other reviewers.  Will not make again.

I took some advice from this recipe, but did change it quiet a bit.  I used 2 cans of cream of chicken and only 1 can of cream of mushroom.  I added 1/2 cup of sour cream.  I only did 1 tsp of onion salt and 1 tsp of garlic salt.  I did use the frozen veggies and 6 chicken breast halves, but I didn't use the Ramen noodles or it's seasoning.  I used egg noodles and I cooked those seperately and then added it to the crockpot mixture about 5 mins before it was finished, and then put it in a baking dish and topped it with butter ritz crackers and baked it for about 5mins.  It was a winner!  The chicken was very tender.

This recipes was totally awesome! My whole family loved it! I followed the preparation instructions, I tweaked it a little though. I used two cans of cream of chicken, a half can of water, 1 medium onion sliced, 2tsp of onion powder, 1-1/2 seasoning packet from the noodles, seasoned the chicken with 1/2 tsp cumin, 1/2 tsp poultry seasoning, 1/2 tsp onion powder. cooked on low for 3-1/2 hours. I added the noodles and cooked on high for 30 min...simply delicious!!!!!!

I have made this twice, and both time it turned out great!! I don't like cream of mushroom, so I used cream of celery instead, and I only used 2 of the seasoning packets, and it was not too salty at all. My husband refers to this as my "fancy top ramen". He loves it!

My husband, 2 of my 3 boys (which is a huge feat!) and my toddler daughter ALL loved this!  My SUPER picky eater son at it all which is saying something!  I didn't change anything in the recipe except I only had 1 can of mushroom soup so I substituted with celery soup, but I'm sure it's wonderful with 2 cans of mushroom too!

This was really good!!  Hubby is a picky eater and won't really eat Casserole's much.  But - with some of the suggested changes & adding some more spices... Hubby has actually asked for me to make this again!  Thank you.

I always have a bunch of chicken and ramen noodles around and this is great in the slow cooker to have waiting for you when you get home.  Can get a little salty.

This casserole looked terrible, but tasted wonderful.  I hesitated to serve it because of the appearance, but my entire family LOVED it.  However, I didn't like that the ramen noodles needed to be added at the end then there was an hour more cooking time.  To me, slow cooking is for coming in the house and eating immediately!  Also I needed to add milk for enough liquid to soften the noodles.  Strange recipe, but a keeper!

This was OK - easy, fairly cheap and tasted OK.  I don't know if it's something we'll crave but it's a nice recipe to have in my repetoire.  I truly don't think the butter is necessary at all - this was already very rich with the soups.  We used the Roasted Chicken Ramen noodles, don't know if the Creamy Chicken would have been better/worse.

Flavor of this wasn't bad, but the noodles and vegetables were mushy.  Too much of the same texture, and I cooked it exactly as directed

This is a great casserole.  I used minced garlic instead of garlic salt and low sodium soups.  The only thing I would do differently next time would be more veggies!

This recipe was easy, the only problem was while eating it we could taste the seasoning packet's from the ramen noodle's more than the other seasoning's.. All in All it was pretty good and will probably make it again just without the seasoning packet's

I liked this recipe because it was easy and filling. A good comfort food casserole. I did halve the recipe so it was done in 4 hours. Overall I would say pretty good and I didn't find it too salty but I did have too thin it out a little with some milk as it was getting too chunky. I did think it was missing something though, it was a little too bland for me because I prefer a little zip. next time I will probably add in some mushrooms and maybe green peppers or scallions. But I will make it again and just modify a little bit.

Super easy and very tasty! My husband liked it and said this was a keeper. I followed the recipe to the letter except I put only 2 of the seasoning packets.  This is perfect because it is made up of stuff that I usually have on hand anyway. YUMMY!!!

This was okay, I don't think I'd make it again.  I followed the recipe then added a little paprika and chili powder to spice it up but it was still bland and mushy.

I really like this dish and so did my kids.  I halved almost everything because it was only for my 2 kids and I.  I used only 1 can a piece of the soups, 2 packs of ramen noodles and 3 boneless chicken breast.  I also used a 12 oz bag of veggies and put them in frozen.  I added about a cup of milk when I put the noodles in so it wouldn't be too thick.  Turned out great and I know I will fix this again, its just too easy and good!!!!

I really liked this recipe.  I cut the recipe in 1/2 (there are only 3 of us) and changed it up a bit.  I read through all of the reviews and used the low sodium soups.  I added 1 cup milk & 1/2 cup water.  I had to shut it off after 4 hours.  It seemed to disipate. I turned it on later and added the veggies; instead of the mixed veggies, I used mushrooms, green & red peppers, & black olives.  Instead of adding the noodles, I prepared them separately and also made some mashed.  It was like a gravy and was really good with the mashed.  My husband had it over the ramens.  The chicken WAS really tender.  Instead of cutting it in pieces, I would put it in the Cuisinart instead and dont use a lot of butter.  It was really good, just a little different than I expected.

My family loved this dish!  However, after looking over the nutrition values, I decided to lighten it up a little.  I used the low salt soups and left out the ramen and ramen seasoning.  Instead, I served over mashed potatoes.  It really is a comforting, stick to your ribs, dish.

This recipe was horrible.  Very mushy and the flavors did not blend together well at all.  It's even worse as leftovers (and there were plenty!).  I do not recommend it at all.

This was really easy to make, and I followed some of the comments from other reviewers.  I cut the ingredients almost in half (there's only 2 of us), and added about a cup of water.  I still found it to be to be too salty.  I'm going to work on some changes & check for new reviewers coments because it was so easy.

The flavor of the recipe is very yummy BUT don't use the noodles from the soup. They get really mushy and don't make for good left overs. Better off cooking up some pasta or rice separately to serve over... Yummy! Definitely a family pleaser...

As reading the reviews I found many concerned about salt intake( which I believe derives from the ramen season packet more so than the condensed soups). A great substitute for the season packet could be Mrs. Dash original season blend ( it is salt free and brings great flavor to all dishes).

Everything tasted great until I added the ramen noodles which ruined the whole thing for me. In our family we have 2 semi-picky and 2 that will eat anything and everybody felt the same.  Next time I will serve the mixture over noodles and not add it in.

Probably not a fair review because I left out the ramen noodles and ramen seasoning altogether, but it was DELICIOUS!  Tasted like chicken a la king.  Served it over hot biscuits.  I didn't add any additional salt - and my salt-loving husband didn't use the shaker at the table.  We both loved it!  This is a keeper.

We really didn't like this. It mostly tasted like creamy ramen with too much salt/seasoning. I'm mostly sad that I wasted so much chicken to make this, as we probably won't eat the leftovers.

Wow!  I followed the recipe as it was written, except I broke my noodles into small pieces instead of fourths, and after adding the noodles to the crockpot, I did not turn it up to high, and the noodles were cooked in 30 minutes.  What a great recipe when you have minimal time to cook!  My family loved it!  This recipe is a keeper!

Loved this recipe! Made a few minor changes...held back on season packet #3 to cut back on salt and added a 14.5 oz can of chicken broth to thin the mix out. Will defintely make this again! Buttered cracker crumbs would be great on top!

I needed a recipe to use what I had on hand and this was it. Alot of reviews said it was to thick so I used 2 cans of soup and 2 cans of water. I also precooked my chicken since I did not have the time the recipe called for and I added flavored bread crumbs on top. It was a hit!

Not bad but way too salty for my family. (Next time I'll skip adding the ramen noodle seasoning packets - too much sodium) I also threw in 4 cloves of garlic, but next time I'll add grated onion and sage too.

My family loved this one..  After reading many of the other reviews, I decided to try something a little different.  When the casserole was done cooking I boiled the ramen noodles as you normally would prepare them.  I then drained it and added it to the rest of the meal.  It was not mushy like most complained about.  I only used half of the ramen seasoning as well. Very good.

This was very easy, tasty and made a lot of food.  My whole family enjoyed.  If you don't like salt (or think Ramen noodles are salty), you might want to try using fresh garlic and onion instead of the powders.

Too thick and mushy for me.  Since other reviews said too salty I only added 1 ramen seasoning packet.  Ended up being a little bland.

Unfortunately this recipe has a lot of problems. It is, like another reviewer commented, a souped up Ramen noodles recipe. Personally I love Ramen noodles and I love salt. But, as 99% of the other reviews mentioned it is too salty! I think inherently the problem lies in the noodles cooking in the soup. The noodles soak up the super rich flavor. I even only put in 2 packets of Ramen seasoning, but it was just too much. My husband wasn't home for dinner and it's a good thing. He would have taken 2 bites and been done. I also think the butter is completely unnessary in this recipe, even though I love my butter. It seperated from the soups, leaving puddles of oil on top. I've been trying to think about how to improve on this recipe so it's not so salty and rich, but I think it would completely change the recipe. Growing up as a kid my mom would make a similar type dish that also used condensed soups, but she would simmer the meat and soups together, cook skinny egg noodles seperately and mix it all together. It was a much better ratio of noodle to soup. She didn't add any additional spices because it really didn't need it (my dad always added lots of black pepper to his.) It was SO much better and not salty at all. IF I ever get a craving for a creamy Ramen noodles and decide to try again I'll cut out one can of soup and replace with 1 can of water, eliminate the seasoning packets (or just use 1 max.) And I'll do as some other reviewers have done and cook the noodles seperately.

This was pretty good. I would only add 1tsp of garlic powder and 1tsp of onion powder. It was a little too overpowering. Ok, a lot overpowering. But it was still decent.

Tasted pretty good, but was a bit salty for my taste even after leaving out one of the Ramen noodle packets. If I make it again, I will only use low sodium condensed soups and leave out the noodle flavoring.

Have made it several times, once with the leftover turkey after Christmas; Everyone who's tried it, loves it. I used two Ramen seasoning packets instead of 3, but that's a personal preference. Very Creamy. One of the few meals I've tried that was just as good the 2nd or 3rd time as a leftover meal. For the 3 of us, we get about 8-10 servings out of it. Thanks Sue, we're having it again today.

I thought it would be too salty when I first made it, but it turned out good.  I used all 3 seasoning packets, but used chopped onion and minced garlic instead of the powders.  Also added a can of mushroom pieces in the beginning, and 2 cups water right before I added the noodles.  Will make again.

Recipe was great. My 8 year old loved it and he's very picky. Hubby thought the chicken was dry but he doesn't like white meat so maybe next time I'll try boneless skinless thighs. But, I thought it was great. Thanks

I love this recipe and so does my husband....which is saying a lot!! It's very easy and very flavorful!! I've only made one minor change and that is to tone down on the spices...(i.e. 2 ramen season packets vs 3 because I use the creamy chicken instead of the regular chicken ramen noodles)

Needed more salt :-)!! (ha ha). What can I say...I HATE giving anything but a 5 star review, but I couldn't get past the look of this dish. It got really thick and when I tried to thin it down, I ended up with something that I could of wallpapered my walls with. I didn't use any of the seasoning packets but substituted sodium free chicken granuales and it still made me pucker. My kids LOVE ramen noodles and they wouldn't eat it and my hubby who has never once complained aout anything thing I have cooked told me not to bother making this again. I haven't heard this once in 8 years of marriage. This was one time I thanked God for Pizza Hut.

My family is not fond of overly salty foods and this didn't go over well.  I would suggest using low sodium soups and to only use one packet of the ramen flavoring if you want to keep the sodium content lower.

I made this at home in the crockpot and everyone loved it.  I told my mother about it and she made it for sunday dinner for the whole family (she had to triple the recipe).  But she made it in the oven and added some milk.  It turned out so much better in the oven.  All 15 loved it!

This was too salty and the frozen vegetables cooked too long, so they were overdone.  I would not make this again.

VERY salty dish, will definitely be trying again with a couple tweaks. I had changed the recipe to use 3 cream of chicken soups and one cream of mushroom. The noodles came out perfect for me with 6 hours on low and the 1 hour on high. I used only one 10oz package of frozen green beans I had on hand because it was what I had. At first when I tried it I really liked it but it was just sooo salty the more I ate it. It’s an okay dish, but definitely one that needs tweaking to taste. I went in with no expectations so I wasn’t overly excited or disappointed! Definitely going to go drink a bunch of water now, lol

This was one big salty mess. No flavor other than salt (and I *like* a lot of salt) and no texture. I don't think I've ever given anything a one-star rating. Sorry - this was not for me.

I made this with a few substitutions for what I had on hand and it still came out great. I used 2 cans of cream of chicken and 2 cans of cheddar cheese soup, a 12 oz bag of frozen broccoli, 1 roast beef ramen, 2 oriental flavor ramen, and fresh garlic. I really dislike recipes that are rigid and not adaptable and this one is definitely adaptable. It's a keeper.

Great meal.  I used cream of celery soup instead of  cream of mushroom soup since he doesn't like mushrooms.   Made it for a dinner party.   Everyone loved it.

Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Recipe sounded easy and good. I read some of the reviews about it being salty. In my day I could have handled salty flavor but since I've cut back on a lot of salt, my taste buds can't handle it, plus I wasn't the only one eating it. That being said I really wanted to try this recipe, so I got most of the ingredients without salt (unsalted butter, salt free frozen veggies, etc)
Since discovering Johnny's garlic seasoning, I don't buy onion or garlic powder anymore.

Substitutions that I used:
Unsalted butter instead of regular butter; 
1 to 1 1/2 tsp of Johnnys Parmesan Garlic seasoning instead of the onion and garlic powder;  
1/2 cup of salt free frozen petite peas and 1/2 box of C&W frozen artichoke hearts instead of the mixed vegetables;  
Low sodium "Cream of Chicken and Mushroom" soup  instead of "Cream of Chicken" and "Cream of Mushroom" soups.   
. 
I started off with half of the ramen seasoning listed in the recipe and before adding the noodles, I tasted to see if more was needed. 
Someone said they thought there was a low sodium ramen but I couldn't find it. I will continue to look for it. 
Turned out delish and we would have it again... and again.

No need for the butter. I skipped it and I couldn't tell you what its purpose was. I used 2 packets of ramen and it was noticeably salty. I also cut the amount of chicken and soups in half and used 2 instead of 3 tsp's of the spices called. This would have needed another can of soup if I had used all the chicken it called for. I used pre-cooked chicken that had been cooked in the crock pot so the time needed was much less.

I felt 3 seasoning packets were too much and too salty. I will make this again with revisions of cutting back on the amount of packets and I want to try this with ground beef, chicken and turkey instead of cubed meats or poultry.

The boyfriend approved!! I LOVE easy simple recipes like this that are delicious. And you can easily modify it. I only used two ramen packs and it was still delicious. I was concerned that this would be super high in sodium, but I used low sodium soups so it was a little better. I will definitely be making it again and adding my own flare to it!

This recipe is great! So easy to make and so good. I never knew how good garlic and onion powder tasted, together. I have made this several times. I cook for just me but this can feed a family of 4 or 6. Depending on how much one person eats. LOL

I made this today in the crockpot while at work. The taste is delicious! I did use can mixed vegetables because that's what I had on hand. The only problem was it stuck to the inside of the crockpot. I'm sure there is a solution for that I just need to figure it out.

Overall it was good. It needs no butter as others stated. Used 3 breasts 1can each of soup and 1 pkg of noodles and seasoning. Not salty at all added a few more veggies had left over. Started it later in day so cooked on high for about 3hrs then on low for another hr. The noodles get soft in about 20min. Then ready to serve. Added some other spices since some had thought it was bland. I'll do again it was so easy.

We thought this was really good.  I used chicken thighs because that was what was on sale, and used California blend veggies.  I also followed suggestions to use less of the seasonings.  I am personally not a fan of "cream of" soups, but I would make this again.

I followed the recipe and added a little salt free cajun seasoning. I would have liked it a little spicier but it was good! I used all 3 seasoning packets and it was not salty. I would make this again!

I made this for our weekly Sunday family dinner and all 15 family members loved my heat filled version of this recipe. To bring the heat I added a tablespoon of vinegar, 2 tablespoons of crushed red pepper, a minced jalapeño pepper and a teaspoon of fresh shaved ginger. I also used fresh veggies: carrots, broccoli, Bok Choy, peppers, onions,  and edemme and canned water chestnuts

This recipe has good flavor but was real mushy. Had the consistency been better, it would deserve more stars. I think cooking it in the oven until the chicken is done would come out better than in a slow cooker for so long. Since I liked the taste, I'm gonna try it in the oven next time and see if it improves the mushiness.

Turned out really good! The only thing I changed was I used canned veggies instead of frozen since that's what I had. Also, my noodles got a little soggy, but that was my fault. I put them in, and then my BF wound up coming home late from work, so they were in the cooker a little longer than they needed to be even though I turned it off. I was surprised though, because I was worried that using all 3 packets of the ramen seasoning would make it too salty, but it didn't. Thanks for the recipe! Definitely one I will make again.

only used 1 can of cream of mushroom and instead of garlic powder used one tablespoon of Paula Deans house recipe seasoning only used about half of the onion powder recipe called for and 2 (very large) chicken breast. Also used a can of no salt added vegall (liquid included) instead of frozen veggies and only 2 packs of ramen noodles. My family loved this! will be making again!

This was a quick slow cooker meal but it wasn't my favorite. The flavor was missing something. I added 1 medium sweet onion chopped to the in the final 2 hours of the cooking. I also cooked the meal on low for 3 hours and high for 2 (which is when I added the onions). I added about 1 teaspoon of poultry seasoning to the cubed chicken and mixed it up before I added the chicken to the slow cooker. I think next time I will use minced garlic for extra flavor! I did not find the chicken to be shredded (which is why i cooked it the way I did) or the noodles to be mushy (added in the final hour). Just needs a little work with the seasoning for optional flavor and this will be a home run!

My family thought this was okay.  I halved the recipe and followed the directions with 2 very minor changes.  I used 2 packs of noodles but only one packet of seasoning because I was worried about it being too salty.  I used fresh veggies (broccoli, cauliflower, carrots) because that's what I had.  They turned to total mush after 6 hours on low.  I think next time I will add the veggies when I get home from work and use egg noodles as another reviewer suggested. I would definitely suggest adding a can of water at the beginning, this dish was extremely thick and I needed to add water when I added the noodles. You don't need to turn crock pot to high when adding the Ramen noodles, they cooked very quickly on medium.

Tried this tonight for dinner, because I had class all day. I was not impressed. While the chicken was tender and very good, for my taste it was toooo salty, and the vegetables should have been added with the noodles, so they didn't turn to mush.

Yuck!  Even my kids didn't like this one.  Their favorite lunch is Top Ramen but this was really bland but salty.  I think it was the texture mostly that nobody liked.  I'll never make this one again.

This was delicious! My only complaint was that it was a little too salty for me so next time, I'll reduce the amount from the seasoning packets. Thanks!

This was basically raman noodles with "extras".  It you like raman noodles a lot, you'll enjoy this.  It didn't do alot for me personally though.

Honestly, this wasn't what I expected. Very thick consistancy! But I have to say...EVERYONE loved it! I think it was a little salty but I used garlic salt instead of powder cuz it was all I had. And I used chicken thigh meat instead, I think that retains more juices & doesn't taste dry. GREAT recipe~my family thanks you

Tasty, but like the others said, salty. This is very thick so I added a cup of milk to make it creamier. Good for one meal, but leftovers won't reheat well.

I didn't much care for this recipe.  The best I can come up with is "nothing special".  So sorry.  :o(  It was very salty (which isn't a bad thing for me but may be for others).  It just tasted like the cream of chicken soup.

I tried this to take to a potluck - it all went and I was asked for the recipe - good sign.  It serves 6 VERY GENEROUSLY.  I would recommend that the "less salt" soups be used and, instead of onion powder, I cut up one medium onion.

This dish was horrible!  The spices did not blend well at all.  My husband's first comment was that it smelled horrible and after a few bites, my entire family couldn't finish it.
