AMAZING! I needed the full 30 minutes, plus two more and they were soft inside and crispy on the outside.  They were like little flavor bombs.

I didn’t make any changes and they came out fine.
The only difference is that mine must have shrunk in the oven, because they were about half the size shown in the picture.
Tasted good though!

Loved these! I was worried as the smell of vinegar was SO strong... but baked until crunchy they had the perfect amount of flavour to them! I made a double batch...but next time I will triple it or more!
Thanks!

Tasted Amazing, I ate a whole cans worth of chickpeas in two sittings, way better than salt and vinegar chips!

I didn’t like these. I love salt and vinegar Pringle’s and thought this might help my cravings. I may try to make them again with a different type of vinegar.

Interesting recipe. Very good when freshly made. Once cooled not very good.

What a great idea.  Only change I'd make is use Malt Vinegar with salt, like you do with french fries.  Going to give this one a try this weekend.
