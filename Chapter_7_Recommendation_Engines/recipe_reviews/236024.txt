This was great. I used it for bananas and apples. I made it for a poker night and it was well received by everyone. There are a lot of possibilities for this and as the description states, you could use it for a pie but I would suggest whipping a block of cream cheese into it or just freezing the pie once it's in the pie crust because it is a little soft even after chilling. I'm going to whip some cream cheese into the leftovers tomorrow morning and use it to fill french toast!
