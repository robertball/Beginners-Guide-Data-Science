This is fabulous!  I did tweak the recipe a little, however.  I used Splenda instead of sugar and used the low fat cream cheese and light whipped topping.  Was so decadent.  I also spooned chocolate sauce over each serving and topped with toasted pecans, a dollop of whipped topping and topped with a marachino cherry.  Was a dessert for my Mom's birthday party (made two dishes), wonderful for a crowd instead of banana splits!  Everyone loved it :o)

This is the classic recipe, Champagne Salad.  It has been served for years across the country by that name.  Queengoddessnance, you should be aware of plagerism laws...it's quite unlikely you'd create a time honored masterpiece, right down to the exact measurement!(The salad has stood generations of proclaim....two thumbs up...the cool whip is to be gently folded in...)

Made this the other night, had some tonight, and it is delicious.  Made half of the recipe and used an 8 by 8-inch glass dish.  (If anyone wants to know, the drained weight of 1/2 of a 20-oz. can of Dole pineapple is 5-1/2 oz.)  I used fresh (slightly sweetened) strawberries. The pineapple and banana became kind of mushy, so next time I will try pineapple tidbits and only coarsely chunk the banana for a better texture.  Also, I would add the fruits directly to the creamed mixture, gently mix this, and then gently fold in the whipped topping (one less dirty bowl).  DO add some slivered almonds or chopped pecans over the top.  YUMMY.

This is very, very good. Next time I make this however, I will see how it fits into two 8"x8" so I can keep one in freezer. I wasn't certain if it was to go back into freezer again or not but family liked it better after it thawed completely and strawberries had more flavor than when frozen. Funniest thing was when I came into room and found my teenage daughter licking very last remains out of the dish. She was embarrassed but we almost rolled on the floor laughing.

Mmmm. Company loved this treat. Really, you should set it out for a while before serving. I thought that because there is a lot of whipped cream in it, it shouldn't freeze too hard (whipped cream doesn't freeze  solid), but it does. Probably because of all the fruit and the cream cheese it 'bonds' together and makes it very hard. So thaw a bit before serving. Very tasty!

REFRESHING! We really loved this dessert! Easy to make and has a wonderful, light & fluffy texture. The fact that it's frozen makes it a lot like ice cream (except better)! Followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing! I used 2 bread loaf pans and 2 large custard cups (didn't have enough for a 3rd loaf pan). Definitely a repeat! A nice Spring-Summer dessert for those warm evenings!

I brought this to a company function and everyone loved it.  Several people asked for the recipe.  I tweaked it a little by using strawberry Cool Whip since it was on hand when I bought it...delicious!

This was a wonderful recipe.  I froze it in a bread loaf pan, so it was really easy to cut and present the frozen squares.  I also 86ed the pineapple and added frozen raspberries.  Very good!

This was delicious when I made it.  I put it in 12 individual small bowels and froze it over night as recommended.  I got it out 1/2 hour before serving and it was like licking a popsickle.  I suggest taking it out of the freezer 1 hour before.  It was so good softened and a huge disappointment frozen.  Either serve it immediately or make sure you take it out in plenty of time to thaw.

This was very good, but it melted fast.  The good news is it re-freezes beautifully and is just as good the second day.

My husband is the biggest ice cream fanatic i know, and he loved this. I guess it's a good, somewhat healthier substitute. Personally, I didn't care for it too much.

I used frozen mixed berries instead of just strawberries and did have a little trouble getting the cream cheese to blend evenly with the fruit mixture. However, it still turned out great and everybody loved it. I will definitely make this many more times, especially when I have company over.

Great recipe!! I froze it in parfait glasses and served garnished with a strawberry & fresh mint. Next time I will try using light cream chees & cool whip. I might also try adding more banana and using fresh strawberries. Yummy!

Tasty.  I used real whipped cream.  Definitely divide into several small dishes before freezing, unless you will be serving a crowd.  That way you will not have to keep thawing and refreezing the whole thing each time you want some.

The flavors in this are very good, but even with letting it sit out for awhile to defrost a bit, it was strange biting into the frozen fruit chunks, especially in the middle, where it was still pretty frozen. I ended up re-purposing the left-overs by letting it thaw, then mixing a 3 oz. pkg of raspberry jello in 3/4 cup of hot water, stirring until dissolved, and then folding in the cream/fruit mixture. Poured it into a store bought graham cracker pie crust, and it was delicious! Firmed up nicely, and made for a light dessert pie. I don't like to waste food, and this was a great way to use up the left overs.

This is absolutely delicious! Very rich and goes a long way. I mixed the sugar and creamed cheese (used Greek) and then added Cool Whip and stirred until incorporated. Then added fruit. Works great in loaf pans. Let it sit about 20  minutes and then it slides right out and you can slice it. Yummy on a slice of angel food cake. (You can also freeze it in the loaf pans and when frozen slide it out and wrap in saran and put back in the freezer. )
