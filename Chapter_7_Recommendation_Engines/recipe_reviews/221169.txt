I agree with the recipe poster - this really does have a unique flavor. I can see this not appealing to everyone, but I thought it was quite good. Hubby thought it was just ok.  It has a nice tang from the vinegar and sour cream. The first time I make a recipe, I always make it exactly as written. I would suggest not trying to mash these by hand...it was next to impossible.  I even tried my hand mixer and the veggies were very hard to mash. Next time I will use my food processor. I cooked the frozen veggies for well over the 15 mins stated. I think next time I will also use fresh veggies instead. They tend to mash a lot easier and don't retain as much water as frozen veggies. When I first threw in the ingredients, everything was very watery. Once mixed though, it tends to thicken up. I enjoyed the flavor and found the amount of seasonings to be just right.  This is great for my low carb diet!

I was going for the Mac and Cheese flavor so I kept adding butter until it was creamy. :) I substituted plain yogurt for sour cream and kept adding it and extra apple cider vinegar until it had a tangy bite to it, like sharp cheddar cheese. I also added a little turmeric and mustard powder. My friends all asked for the recipe. Also used fresh instead of frozen; basically same prep instructions.

This recipe is delicious and so easy to make. I did it a little differently. I used fresh match stick carrots and cauliflower.  I boiled the carrots and steamed the cauliflower. Used less vinegar. It was such a crowd pleaser! Everyone loved it!

I like the concept of this recipe. I used half the amount of apple cider vinegar, which I recommend, especially if you are not a vinegar fan. This is a good base recipe that you can add other seasonings to. Parsley worked great for me.

I loved this creamy healthy side.  I only used 1 T vinger and 1/2 cup sour cream with water added to get desired consistancy.

I used fresh steamed vegetables, and added a little mustard for flavor instead of the vinegar.  Not the prettiest thing to serve, but it's fairly healthy and low carb.  I enjoyed it, and will make it again.

After making it following the original recipe,  I tried making it my own way with changes to make it healthier.    I now omit the sour cream, butter and apple cider vinegar.  I use greek yogurt now, only enough to moisten the veggies and keep them together.  Then I add salt and the garlic powder, and 3T-4T of grated parmesan & romano cheese.  Delicious - tastes like I'm eating something rich and bad for me, when 1/2 cup is only about 60 calories.

This is great-tasting, super-easy to make, and a fabulous way to disguise nutritious vegetables for picky eaters. I turned it into a bake and was very happy with a few modifications (as @friskyspatula originally recommended). 

For our vegetables, I used frozen cauliflower (16 oz), a broccoli/cauliflower/carrot medley (10 oz), and tri-color carrots (10 oz), which made it an unintentional, but interesting purple color overall.  I left the rest of the base alone except for substituting a tablespoon of red wine vinegar (instead of a 1/4 cup) and adding a tablespoon of cayenne pepper for a kick.

While mashing, I added a handful of shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese (I didn't blend because I thought it would make the purple blob I was creating more presentable).  After placing it in a square glass baking dish (8x8), I topped it with a layer of shredded part-skim mozzarella, some bacon, and Italian seasoning and baked it at 375 for 15 min.  Next time I might add chives to bake, but otherwise, I thought it was unexpectedly delicious.  I didn't take a picture because I hadn't planned on getting such great results!

I thought this was pretty tasty for something different. I used fresh instead of frozen veggies and only a splash of vinegar for our taste but otherwise followed the recipe.  My kids did not eat it (7 and 10) and my husband didn't really care for it either.  Not sure I will make it again if I am the only one that will eat it!

Awesome recipe!  I couldn't stop eating it, and while it was very healthy my husband said it had the good "fattening taste" but without same numbers of carbs and calories.  Great way to get him eating carrots too.  And very easy to make.

I made it as written and hubby didn't eat more than one taste.  The vinegar was way too much.  I might try again and leave it out all together

I'm puzzled by the apple cider vinegar.  I hesitated to use it but went ahead.  I wish I had trusted my gut.  the combination of the apple cider and sour cream tasted almost curdled.  I definitely will not use this recipe again.

I really enjoyed this recipe. My husband, however, wasn't a big fan.
