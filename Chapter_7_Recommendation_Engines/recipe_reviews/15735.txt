This is a variation of a standard popular recipe, and while still good, it can use some tweaking. To thin the mayonnaise, combine with a portion of sour cream or yogurt and maybe even a little lemon juice. Golden raisins and green grapes are a redundancy.  Use dark raisins or dried cranberries, or red grapes for color and contrast, and I would prefer red onion or scallions.
Remember to add salt to taste.  Enjoy!

This is almost the same recipe as the "Fruity Curry Chicken Salad" except this one uses real mayo instead of light mayo and onion instead of green onion. I prefer the light mayo because it is healthier and the green onion because it is more colorful.  Otherwise THEY TASTE THE SAME! ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! I've substituted with one or more of the following without any detriment to the taste: leftover turkey, leftover rotisserie chicken, canned chicken, red grapes, green onions, dried cranberries, and roasted chopped walnuts.

This recipe was fabulous! So easy to prepare and delicious. I made it a little healthier by substituting plain nonfat yogurt for the mayonnaise. I love curry, so I added an extra dash or two to the mixture, and I added curry to the chicken while it was cooking. I omitted the onion and celery because I don't always care for those two ingredients. I made this recipe on Sunday night and ate it for lunch during the week - it just got better every day as the curry was absorbed by the yogurt. Thank you Karen for sharing!

This is an excellent recipe..I do not use the onions, and I mix some sour cream with the mayo for a lighter dressing, and also add honey..We serve little side cups of shredded sweetened coconut .I also use more curry powder..The customers love it!!!(yes, I work in a restraunt.)
It is served on a lettuce leaf, or in a croissant, or even in mini Father Sams Pocket Bread.....this is a 10 plus , if you like curry.

Easy and delicious - plus it's a great way to use up leftover grilled chicken! I didn't have pecans so I subbed toasted walnuts instead. I used a Granny Smith Apple and red seedless grapes vs. green. I also used dried cranberries vs. raisins. I mixed the dressing in a separate bowl before folding it into the chicken and other ingredients. For the dressing I used 1/2 cup of Hellman's light mayo cut with 1/4 cup of reduced fat sour cream along with the curry and a bit of salt and pepper. It chilled for just a couple of hours and it came out really good. Overall, a great combination of flavors! Especially good on whole grain bread!

EXCELLENT!!!!  When my daughter, mother, and I tasted this our eyes rolled back into our heads.  It was light and refreshing.  I didn't have apples so I just left them out.  I substituted walnuts for the pecans and used red grapes instead of green.  What a treat to have found this recipe.  Thank you so much.

Too much onion!  In fact it could probably do without all together.  The recipe as is stinks and made me sick.  But, it's easy to do and that's good.

Delicious!  I cheated and used the food processor to do most of my slicing (even the grapes) making this salad a cinch to prepare.  I added about one tablespoon of honey which gave it a tasty sweetness.  I'll make this dish again!

352 people have already reviewed this so my suggestion may get lost and it may not pertain to everybody. still, although i think this is a fundamentally good dish, the quantity of the ingredients was off in my opinion. if you use 4 chicken breasts, you need to double everything else, except the curry. use half the mayonnaise and it's still going to taste great. it does need to wait a bit in the fridge first though. we also used green onions instead of dry ones.

Fantastic.  With a few changes was I added a full teaspoon (then more sprinkles!) I enjoyed the curry flavor, it was a little more punchy.  I also changed the mayo to 1/2 yogurt and 1/4 mayo.

HELPFUL TIPS: I only use one package (deli section) of Tyson's grilled chicken strips diced up, which equals a heaping 1 cup.  Then I use half an apple, same amount of grapes, and a mixture of craisins and raisins (which comes in a package next to craisins and raisin), and since no one likes celery ...omit that.  For the nuts, I used Almond Accents found in the salad section (toasted almonds with flavor).  They made this TO DIE FOR!!!  For mayo, I basically use the amount needed to cover all the ingredients which is always at least 1/4 cup LESS than the amount indicated! My husband HATES chicken salad sammies in any form, but loves this.  Reminds me a lot of Arby's wraps but better.  You definitely have to let this sit in the fridge for one full day to get the full effect of all the blended flavors.  I love this recipe because the ladies in my get-togethers think they're eating a healthy alternative and I look like a super cook for serving them in a tortilla (wrap like a burrito)!

This was really good. Raisins and grapes is a bit of overkill, as is 3/4 of a cup of mayo, hence the four stars instead of five. Otherwise, this recipe is outstanding and we will be using it for chicken salad in the future! Thanks!

Husband loved this recipe.  Used a granny smith apple, quartered the grapes so they were smaller, toasted the pecans for 30 seconds in the microwave, and omitted the curry powder cause I unfortunately didn't have any.  Next time will have to try with the curry powder.  Definitely recommend.

This was wonderful!  I didn't even have all the ingredients and it stilled turned out delicious.  I did use half of a whole chicken I cooked the night before for the meat.  I will definitely make this again and again.

This is one of the best chicken salads I have had, I LOVE chicken salad and this is a yummy one!  I used shredded white chicken breast, because that is what I had on hand and I think it came out just as good as a chunky chicken cut.  I had to add more mayo than this recipe said.  But I would suggest to add the amount of mayo that suits each one's taste.  Worth the time it took to prep it all!

Delicious and versatile recipe! I made it as written the first time (but with red grapes instead of green due to personal preference), which was fantastic! I liked it so much I made it again two days later with only half of the ingredients (no green onions, celery or apple) and it was still amazing. I ate it as a sandwich and on it's own and prefer the latter, although I bet it would taste great on a croissant...

Wonderful salad!!! - served it up on green salad. Be careful toasting the nuts, mine burned a little - still added them and they didn't mess up the dish at all.

Absolutely delicious! I generally make this as a scaled down treat for myself, as neither DH nor DD like curry. I look forward to roasting a chicken just for leftovers for this recipe!  My favorite version is real mayo to taste, finely diced onion, craisins, and candied pecans. I generally add a tad more curry since I love it. I'm usually in such a hurry to whip this up, that I rarely take the time to dice apples or grapes, and although I love them both,  I don't miss them in this chicken salad. I can never wait for this deliciousness to sit in the fridge so it gets eaten as soon as it's made! If you want to look fancy-schmancy for brunch or lunch guests, this is the recipe! Decadent and delicious, serve this on your favorite bread, bun, cracker,  etc., and enjoy!

The proportions of this recipe are just right.  Everything is evident but the curry stays in the background adding some depth.  I went with and would recommend red onion but, of course, answer to the dictates of your own tastes. We baked the chicken lightly seasoned in olive oil.  Easy and delicious.

I love the flavor this recipe gets from the curry. It might have been a bit better with half the onion, and some candied pecans - but its definitely tasty!

I really liked the flavor of this.  Surprisingly, my kids didn't eat that much of it, but I'll still make it and just bring it to my friends and neighbors. I think it's a very good recipe.

This is the second time I have made this excellent chicken salad.  This is a very easy and very tasty salad.  I grilled two 7 ounce chicken breasts (3 servings) with mesquite seasoning, smoked paprika, cayenne pepper and black pepper.  I doubled the RED, seedless grapes and used sweet onions.  I also used toasted almonds (in my cupboard) instead of pecans.  I do think pecans would be a little better.  I also used 1 tablespoon of mayo and 3 tablespoons of fat free ranch which worked very nicely.  Don’t forget a little salt as this does help bring out the flavors.  I will also try a little honey next time as some of the reviews suggested.  Thanks!  This is great!

I first tried something like this in a coffee shop, and they served it on a crispy croissant. I used half mayonnaise and half sour cream.

I made some changes based on what I had on hand, an allergy, and personal preferences. Scaled down to one serving, plain Greek yogurt instead of mayo, dehydrated onions instead of fresh, walnuts in place of pecans, and left out the celery and raisins. Definitely let this sit at least overnight before eating. Phenomenally delicious on a whole wheat pita.

I love this chicken salad, and my husband likes it too! All the flavors compliment each other so well.  It's my favorite one to make right now.  I sub craisins for the raisins and leave out the grapes when I don't have any.  I use onion powder or flakes instead of fresh onion and celery seed when I'm out of the real thing, and it still tastes great.  I like to use slivered almonds instead of pecans.  I thought it was going to be too much mayo, but with all the added fruit, I found the amount just right.  It tastes best after it sits for a little while, but sometimes I can't wait, and I eat it right away.

This is simply fabulous!  It is very very easy and oh so delicious. Everyone in my family loved it. As suggested in another review, I used low fat mayonnaise and I did add a little honey. The dressing is to die for and is a perfect combo of flavor with the fruit, nuts and chicken! I would definitely use real mayonnaise (low fat) and not a Miracle Whip style dressing for this recipe.

This was the best chicken salad I ever ate. The ingredients blend so well together. My husband finished almost all of it at dinner. Very tasty. I baked bread sticks to go with it. Thank you for a great recipe. Update: We own a cafe and have included this recipe in the menu. The chicken salad is always gone. People love it.

This was great... just like a good restaurant chicken salad... it made me want to eat it on a buttery croissant...but alas...  just on wheat bread.

Needs a little salt, and next time I might use onion power instead of raw onion to make it a little less shocking.

Thank you for the recipe.

I made this with a few changes. I consider what I made loosely based on this recipe, just out of necessity. I used: Trader Joe's canned chicken, NO celery (was out), dried cranberries instead of raisins, NO grapes, hazelnuts instead of pecans and a mix of mayo/greek yogurt. Very yummy! I wish I had been able to make it as published...I am sure it would be awesome too. Thanks for posting this!

This recipe has been around for some time and to make a change, especially for younger diners add a cup of mini marshmallows(white or coloured) just before serving. Also pineapple chunks, canned or fresh can add another taste treat.  Mix 2 tbs of pineapple juice with mayo and stir into salad.

I used this as a base but didn't have all on hand which is why the four stars.  So added pears, sunflower seeds, poppy seeds, lemon juice, celery, raisins, turmeric, and mayo.  Did NOT have apples, onions, grapes, pecans, or golden raisins.  So umm...  it's all interchangeable right?? Served this on popovers with spinach leaves. Was DELISH and would do it again.  I have a similar recipe that uses apple cider vinegar and dried cranberries so just a thought of how creative with this recipe you can get!  EnjoY!

This is absolutely wonderful, and very convenient for lunches. I used canned chicken the first time (which looked weird, but was tasty) and grilled diced chicken the second time, which was even better. I like leaving this to sit overnight before using it, so the flavours can really mix together. I added extra curry because I love the flavour.

Absolutely delicious! I omitted the apples and added almonds as the nut. I used 1/2 cup of fat free sour cream and only 2 tables of mayo and it came out great. I also used only half an onion as one whole one would be a bit too much.

My husband and I both agree that this was the BEST chicken salad we have ever tasted!  Absolutely delicious!  The only thing that I changed was that I bought a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store and used the meat from that instead of using four chicken breasts (it ended up being about the same amount of meat).  I think this will be my new staple to take to covered dish meals!

This was very good but I added miricle whip mixed with mayo about half and half and a little less onion and a little more apple. I also added a tablespoon of relish. Over all though it was good.

Very good! Turned 2 cups cooked chicken into tasty meal! I added 1/3 cup shredded carrot, 1/3 cup red onion, and regular raisins slightly chopped. Makes it just as good to look at as it does to eat! Curry flavor makes this sweet and savory delight!

This is the best chicken salad recipe I have ever eaten. I used a little less onion than it called for. And added just a tad bit more fruit. And no celery.

LOVE this recipe! One of the best I've tried. I'd recommend shredding the chicken first in a food processor or shred manually with a knife/fork. It gives it better texture with all the other chunky ingredients. Also, this needs more mayo than what's called for. Craisons are also a nice touch in place of golden raison. Overall, though, it's terrific!

This is the most amazing chicken salad recipe ever.  I've served it several times at get togethers and always get rave reviews and requests for the recipe.  The only thing I do differently is us canned chunk chicken to save time. Thank you for sharing this!

Not bad! Except, I used a red onion instead of a regular onion and I assume this is what gave the salad a WAY TOO STRONG onion taste. So dont use red onion. (oops!) I plan on making this again w/ regular onion, and cutting downt he onion just in case!

Never in a million years would I have thought I would love curry with fruit!  All I can say is WOW!  We can't get enough of this stuff!  We snacked on it after dinner like a desert and no one could wait until today to have it for lunch.  Definitely better the second day!  We used black grapes for color instead of green - but it would have been just as good with green.  I wouldn't change a thing!  Delish!

This chicken salad is delicious, and I'm not typically a big fan of curry. Because I didn't have any green grapes, I substituted red ones; they actually add nice color to the salad. Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing!

This is an excellent recipe!  The only things that I changed was increasing the raisins and grapes to 1/2 cup each, using 1/2 of a sweet onion and using regular raisins.  Definitely plan to keep this!

Sooo good!  Definitely add honey to the dressing before pouring over salad.  Leaving the peel on the apple is more nutritious & adds color & texture.  Serve atop a bed of mixed greens.  Even better next day.

Love this!  So yummy!  I used the meat on a leftover rostisserie chicken for this.  The curry amount is perfect, not overwhelming.  And these are ingredients I usually have on hand!  Thanks so much for this recipe!

Big hit at a baby shower.  I received several requests for the recipe.  I didn't change anything except for the amount of curry.  I blended the mayo, pepper and curry before adding to the other ingredients and tasted it.  I kept adding curry until I liked it (and it looked yellow). I used granny smith apples for tartness and red onion.  Worked great! I'll definitely make it again.

This salad is great! I didn't even use measurements...just added things to taste. I omitted the golden raisins and apples and added red grapes and substituted the pecans for walnuts. You can also make this healthier by subbing greek yogurt & sour cream for mayo. I also added some cumin which in my opinion really added to the overall flavor.

Wonderful recipe.  I made this for a wedding shower I was hosting, and it received so many wonderful compliments.  I doubled the curry, and used craisins instead of raisins.  I also added a bit more mayo, as it was a little dry.  Great recipe which I'll use often.  Thanks so much.

My husband was disappointed with Arby's chicken salad so I told him I would make some for him.  I found this recipe and decided to use this and he loved it.  I roasted a chicken last night for dinner so I took the extra chicken off the bones and used that in place of the chicken breasts since I was only making a half recipe.  I used red grapes and regular raisins.  I also added a pinch of salt. Great extra Father's Day gift. :)

Yum.  To make it healthier, I use 1/2 cup greek yogurt, 1/4 cup light mayo.  Also, I sub craisins for both the raisins and grapes.  Toasted walnuts work well, too.  Recently, I added a bunch of cooked quinoa and mixed it all together to create a one-dish meal. Endless possibilities!

Yum O! I made this and then put it on top of a little piece of spring lettuce and then in the Wonder Bread cups I made for another recipe. Served them cool. They lasted a few days (the few leftovers that there were!)

Wow!.. I can't believe I never tried chicken salad before this..  So good; we are big fans of fruits, nuts and curry so this salad was a giant hit with us.  Used almonds instead of pecans and craisins instead of raisins; I didn't have grapes so I omitted them.  I served it on lettuce but the lettuce was bland.  Maybe next time I'll figure out what I can put on it first.  Thanks, I am now hooked and I know I'll want to make this with my leftover chicken from now on! :)

I've been making this ever since living in England, because they have a very similar dish called coronation chicken. I do a few things different to make a great restaurant-quality sandwich:  I follow this recipe except I use standard raisins, and add 2 tablespoons of honey to the curry/mayo mixture. Top with shredded carrot and alfalfa sprouts on a nice think sliced whole wheat or other grain bread and viola! My husband always feels like he's ordered lunch from a cafe when he gets this in his bento.

By far one of the best chicken salad's I've tasted. I used dried cranberries instead of golden raisins and used 1 full teaspoon of the curry! This recipe went straight to my recipe box of favorites!!!

You really need to add A LOT more curry to taste it in this recipe.  I used 2-2.5 tsps to get it to taste curried.  To get more sweetness I added some jumbo red flame raisins, red grapes, a honeycrisp apple and a tablespoon of honey.  The bowl was nearly empty at the party I took it too!

Simple, delicious!  Easy to make.  My kids weren't into it, but it was great to have in the fridge for the weekend - easy to pull out for a salad or sandwich at any time, keeps well for a few days.

I hosted a baby shower and made this recipe.  Served it on small squares of  wheat pita with a little bit of crisp lettuce... it was a huge hit.  I thought I added too much curry but everyone else at the shower just raved over the taste.  I thought it was good too. They must have really loved it, there was some left over and people took some home.  I was very pleased and will make again!!

4.5  I made this for our Historical Society Tea and several people asked me for the recipe.  The curry flavor is very light.  I didn't make any changes to the posted recipe.

The reason I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is this: 1) Too much onion.  I LOVE onion and it was kind of a lot.  2) it tastes better the next day!  Everytime I make this all I want to do is eat all of it but it really is better the next day!!!!   I am making this for a bridal shower next month so I'll update and let you know how everyone liked it!

I have made this several times and it's a HUGE hit every time.  I increase the honey and add white wine (it gives it a bit of a punch) while decreasing the fat free mayo.  After shredding the chicken I throw in the ingredients and make the sauce to the consistency that I want.  I really don't measure anything, I just taste things along the way until its juuuuuuust right.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I'll add another 5 stars to this!  It happened to have ingredients I had on hand on a hot summer day, so I tried it, not expecting it to be as good as it was.  I had dark raisins and walnuts, so I used them instead of the goldens and toasted pecans.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly, and I LOVED it!  Next time I make it, I'll probably increase the celery and decrease the onion (personal preference), and I'll make a point of trying the toasted pecans.  Thanks for this recipe - it's going into my recipe box right now!

Mmmm... 

I had some left over chicken and I wanted a nice recipe to use it in; looks like I made the right choice! I  subtracted the onion and celery because I didn't have celery on hand, and I'm not too fond of raw onion. I added an equal amount of macadamia nut pieces, which added to a nice flavor to the whole mix.

I'd been looking for a good chicken salad recipe for a long time and this was awesome!  I didn't have apples or celery and I used dried cranberries instead of raisins, but it was still delicious!  The curry in this made it really original.

THIS IS A WONDERFUL RECIPE! GO EASY ON THE ONION SO ITS NOT SO OVERPOWERING. I USED LITE MIRACLE WHIP MAYO AND IT TURNED OUT AWESOME. ALSO, I ADDED 1/3 CUP CHOPPED PEAR (CANNED HALF PEARS IN LITE SYRUP). I USED WHOLE RED GRAPES INSTEAD OF GREEN (FOR COLOR AND SWEETNESS), A TBSP OF SUGAR, AND A PINCH MORE CURRY POWDER. BEST THE NEXT DAY ON A TOASTED PITA! YUM!

Oh, this is so delicious!!!  I followed the directions exact, and it was wonderful.  Very flavorful, especially if you like curry.  I do let it sit overnight, too.  It's more flavorful that way.

I can't believe how good this salad is. When I read the ingredients, I was a little skeptical. But all the positive reviews won me over and I made it for dinner today. It is fabulous! I'll make again and again and again. Delicious!

Was good, but had a strong Mayo taste, and not enough curry. Next time I'll use plain yogurt (used 2:1 mayo and yogurt combo). This looked great served atop a mound of baby spinach leaves.

This recipe is FAB!  I used a lot more curry in my version (do this to taste in a separate bowl as suggested elsewhere).  I also used dried cranberries in my version instead of raisins--I really recommend trying this!  Crisp apples work best and I prefer using a combination of yogurt and lowfat miracle whip instead of mayonnaise (it just seems to need more kick than the mayo can provide). If you think it needs it, squirt in a bit of honey (also as suggested here). Really, this is my favorite kind of recipe--one that has good "bones" and allows you to be creative!

Very, very, very good.  My husband loved it.  However, we like a stronger curry flavor so we used a tablespoon of curry.

The best chicken salad ever. I read the advice to add more curry and I had to for my tastes. I omitted the raisins because I don't like them. I used left over rotisserie chicken. This is my new summer potluck recipe.

We love this recipe so I make it often.  I don't peel my apples, just core and cut then I leave out the raisins and onions and substitute 1/4 of the Mayo with Miracle Whip, plus I use whatever nuts I have on hand, and walnuts are great in this.  As far as the amount of curry, I use more than is called for, but this is a matter of personal taste. Definitely better the next day...if you can leave it alone the first day.

Mine turned out a little bit dry, so I wound up adding about 1/4c of sour cream, but otherwise we loved this. Quick and delicious.

Easy and delicious. not a cook, but my cook fiance liked it.  Accidentally burnt the pecans, so left them out and it was still very tasty.  Served it as wraps and it did well as leftovers for lunch the next day.

Great recipe! To cut down on the fat, I substituted fat free mayo and also used more curry for taste. Used walnuts and cranberries and loaded into whole wheat pitas. No measuring really needed, just eyeball and mix.

I used one whole roasted, seasoned chicken breast, and walnuts instead of pecans because I had them; I also omitted the onion. Served on whole wheat flat bread. I Increased pepper to 1/2 tsp and curry powder to 1 tsp. I'm glad I followed the author's suggestion and prepared it the night before I served it - the flavors had developed really nicely.

This is very much like the chicken salad served at 'The Jewish Mother' in VA Beach when I was a kid--the only differences being that they left out the onion, added pecans and served it piled high in pita pockets. I like to use light mayo and whole wheat pitas to make it even healthier. Also, pita pockets make them very transportable, so I often make this for picnics in the summer.

Absolutely delicious!  I baked the chicken breasts using favorite seasonings (garlic, sage, chili powder and cayenne) and thought later I should probably have cooked the chicken without seasonings because those might adversely affect the taste of the completed chicken salad, but it turned out great.  Used red onion and increased the black pepper and grapes--more like 2/3 - 3/4 cup.  Didn't think the salad needed any salt added, but others may want a little.  Do toast the nuts.  I wanted to save time and skip that step, but the toasting really helps bring out the flavor in the nuts and makes them more crunchy.  Really, really good recipe.  Will make often and, for variety, will try pineapple in it sometime.

I've made this twice. Big hit both times. I quadrupled the curry and doubled up on the grapes, cutting them in half before adding.

It's so great and flexible; you can eat it as a side salad, put it in a sandwich, wrap it in a flour tortilla with lettuce, or even just lettuce wraps for those no-carb diets!  I skipped the onions, raisins and pecans and used dried cranberries, and almond slivers instead.  I also used a 1/4 cup yogurt with the mayo when I was making it for sandwiches for extra moisture.  Although I do love MAYOOOO! If you leave it overnight, the curry seeps in a bit more and makes all the great flavors mingle more. I made a bucket full for our picnic to the Hollywood Bowl show, and we ate ALL of it!!

This was a delicious chicken curry salad.  I tripled the amount of curry and added dried cranberries in place of the golden raisins, as I did not have any on hand, as well as Kraft's Olive Oil mayo. Delicious!  My whole family loved it, which surprised me, as I really made this for me.  Definitely a keeper.

I'm picky about my chicken salad, but this was amazing!  I was grazing on it all weekend long and practically ate the whole recipe myself!  It's sweeter (due to all the fruit), which I like, but the nuts add a nice crunch.  thanks for a great recipe!

I was disappointed with this, and was very surprised, since I usually love any type of chicken salad. The flavor was bland, even though I added more curry and black pepper. I did not use onions, since my husband hates them, so maybe they would have helped. I also used a food processor to chop the celery and apples, so maybe the pieces were too small? I'm not sure. I kept the salad in the fridge for a day like you're supposed to, but it didn't seem to bring out much flavor. I think next time I would leave the grapes out too. I didn't much care for them being in there. All in all, I would prefer a more flavorful salad.

This was pretty good but I made some changes that made it taste more like our local health food store's version--which I love! I increased the curry powder to 1 1/2 tsp., added about 1/8 tsp. of cumin powder, added 1/2 of a red bell pepper (chopped), added 1/2 tsp. of salt, and omitted the apples, raisins, and pecans.  It turned out really, really well.  I highly recommend letting this refrigerate overnight before eating so the flavors can blend.

This was awesome!  My husband said this was the best chicken salad he has ever had.  My husband, kids, and I kept eating this.  I thought I would have some left for lunch tomorrow, but we ate it all.  I did make a few changes.  I did not have curry, so I used half cumin and half coriander seed.  I sprinkled some cinnamon in with it.  I also took the advice of others and used 1/2 cup mayo mixed with 1/4 cup sour cream.  I added a few sprinkles of lemon juice to the sour cream.  I also used dark raisins and added salt to taste.  I left out the onion and celery and it was still delicious.

Incredible. I eat this for lunch quite regularly. I make up a batch for 4 days at a time. The longer it sits in the fridge, the more the flavors meld together. Sooo good! The only change I make is substituting plain low-fat yogurt for the mayonnaise (just a taste/health preference).

This was great!  Very customizable and easy to prepare - I used more apple, and grapes, almonds, celery, craisins, and fat free plain yogurt in place of mayo, and grilled the chicken with a curry rub.  I also added more curry powder and pepper for some more spice..served in pita bread...what a nice change from the regular 'bagel lunch' :)

I think I made this chicken salad 4 or 5 times already. I use light mayo and add more celery, curry, grapes & I used walnuts also. It has been my go-to lunch. Even my step-kids liked it.

I took this to a fireworks party and it was a big hit!  I made a few changes...started with a rotisserie chicken from Costco, omitted the apple, used almonds instead of pecans, used Greek yogurt in place of some of the mayo, red grapes instead of green, and amped up the curry powder.  Served it with mini pita breads.  YUMMY!  I'll certainly use this one again.

We made this tonight, but transformed it into a pasta salad by doubling the ingredients, and adding the whole mixture to one box of cooked medium pasta shells.  I baked the chicken breasts with just a sprinkle of seasoning salt & fresh ground pepper, and this added a nice flavor. If you are going to make a pasta salad instead, be sure to use plenty of chicken. Thanks for a great recipe!

This is identical to "Fruity" Curry Chicken salad on this site.  This one uses onions and the other uses "green onions".  Both are delicious and the curry isn't overpowering.

I love curry and this was a wonderful idea. I made this a lowfat version by adding only half of the mayonnaise and substituting the other half with nonfat yogurt.  Yogurt goes great with curry, so it's a win/win all around.  I had no grapes or apples, so dried apricots became my fruit of choice. Staying on the lowfat theme, I left out the nuts and added more celery. Can't wait to  have more leftover chicken!

A really healthy and filling chicken salad.  I used non-fat mayo and really couldn't taste the difference!

It needs more curry seasoning for better taste.  Instead of 1/2 a tsp, I used 1 1/2 tsp to obtain a tangy taste.

This is awesome! I wasn't sure since I don't like mayo and the thought of fruit with chicken and spices doesn't sound appealing...We loved it and I will definitely be making again. Thank you!

This is so good!  I'm making/eating so much of this that I will need to play around with a lighter version!  However, it's so good, I'm afraid to mess with it! :)

Oh my, oh my.  This was excellent!  I boiled diced chicken on my stove.  Then, I used my pampered chef food chopper and made quick work of the celery, nuts, and apple.  (I didn't add the raisins or onion.)  I threw it all together with the halved grapes and eyeballed just enough mayo to moisten the ingredients.  I was a little cautious about the curry powder, so I added it in little by little with the pepper.  Mmm.  Don't be intimidated by the long list of ingredients!  Use a little food chopper, and it goes really quick!

I emailed this recipe to a friend saying "doesn't this sound good" ... she retired from the company I still work for.  She said why don't you come over at lunchtime one day and I'll try the recipe.  I went there the other day on my birthday and it was really delicious.  She used red, rather than green, grapes and the apple was a Granny Smith rather than a sweeter apple.  I'm guessing this would have been a 5 star recipe without these changes.

Fabulous!  A few changes that worked for us... we grilled the chicken andreally chopped it up into small pieces.  Used red seedless grapes instead of green.  Used the packaged salad "candied" pecans (chopped)and they were amazing.  Doubled the curry, but we are curry freaks.  Used a large granny smith apple.  Unlike many of the reviewers, I added light mayo at the end and kept mixing and adding until I got the constantcy that we like...which I think was about a 1/2 cup of light mayo.  Crunchy, tasty and not soggy!

Excellent and tasty! I do not usually measure ingredients, but I know for sure I used more than the stated amount of mayo. I also substituted green onions for regular onions for a more subtle onion flavor. Great for lunches!

Have made this many times.  Had to add more mayo than called for, about 1 1/4 cups, and a little more curry to taste.  I blended the dressing prior to stirring it up.   I omitted the celery as I have found I cannot really taste it.  I halved the red onion, because you do need some for a little "bite" to the recipe.

To make the chicken easily, cook 4 frozen breasts in a crockpot with a little water for four hours on high.   They are moister this way and cut easily - the texture is perfect and better than chopping up chicken.

This is a wonderful chicken salad.  I never would have thought to add curry powder, but it works.  I made it tonight so that it could sit in the fridge overnight as other members suggested.  Of course I had to sample it, and now I can't wait to have it for dinner tomorrow!

LOved this recipe. I would definitely let it sit overnight as the flavors need to blend. I've made this twice for potluck and always get asked for the recipe. Definitely a winner!

My hubby gave this recipe four stars, but I am erring on the side of my better judgement.  Five stars!  I served it heaped on a bed of iceburg lettuce with tomatoe wegdes as garnish.  I received compliments on presentation from the crowd, and great taste too!

The fruit and curry combination in this creamy salad was perfect.  I omitted the pecans because I don't like nuts in my food and also omitted the apple because I didn't have any on hand.  I used low fat mayo and it came out perfect!  Thanks for the recipe.

Used leftover turkey instead of chicken and made it without the fruit for DH, but added the fruit for my half. Loved it both ways- still had that interesting, complex curry taste, but it didn't overpower everything else. Very, very nice.

Delicious!  The curry is not over-powering, but lends a light, almost sweet flavor.  I left out the nuts and just used celery, apples and grapes with the chicken.  My whole family loved this recipe!  Thanks!

This is a great spin on chicken salad.  I never had curry before so I was a little skeptical but it came out great.  It's perfect on a salad or in a pita.  My lunch buddies enjoyed it.

This was great.  I read all the recommendations and this is what I did:  I doubled the recipe, but didn't necessarily double the chicken and it was still enough chicken.  I used craisins instead of golden raisins, more than doubled the grapes craisins and apples, cooked the celery with the chicken with curry, used 3/4 c mayonaise and 3/4 c plain yogurt (remember I'm doubling), omitted the onions since I don't like them, served it on a bed of boston bib lettuce and it was wonderful.  Thanks!

This was really great.  I also added the honey to the recipe.  I did some  substitutions for some of the veggies - like adding red peppers.  I think that's what makes this recipe a good base for what you have in your frig.

I've been making this recipe for a while now and I love it!  To save time and add flavor, I use a "Honey BBQ" rotisserie chicken from my local grocery store and just use the breast meat.  I add a little more apples and grapes (don't like raisins) to make up for using less meat and it tastes fabulous.  I usually use almonds (sliced or slivered) instead of pecans because I tend to have them in my pantry more often than not.  And sometimes I add a few squirts of honey as suggested by another reviewer. Thanks for the recipe!

AMAZING!!!  I made it for a picnic on the beach.  Served it on toasted whole wheat bagguettes with sun chips.  My husband, who doesnt like curry, apples or celery raved about it.  I did omit the raisins because I feared I'd be pushing it with him if he saw raisins in the salad.  Next time I will add them though.  Thanks for the recipe!!!!

I absolutely loved this recipe! Very simple and easy to make and delicious! The real test, was my 17 yr. old son and my husband. My husband is a meat and potatoes man and VERY finicky with anything else. They both ate large servings and I secretly watched my husband as he went to put his plate away and he was getting seconds! He said that he really liked it and told me to make some the following evening for New Year's Eve for one of my other sons. He also ate it for Brunch the next day. My son loved it, too and even helped make more on New Year's. This is definately a keeper!

Delicious on a croissant, or whatever you have! I triple the amount of curry. It's also a very forgiving recipe.

Wonderful recipe!  I'll have to admit, I was a little skeptical at first with mixing fruit and onions together, but it tastes awesome!  One thing I did change though, was candied pecans instead of toasted pecans.  Next time, I'll make it with a tart granny smith   apple and I'm sure I'll be making it a lot.  THANKS!!!!!

This recipe is absolutely awesome!!  My daughter made it for 4H at our county fair (fruit category) and won 1st place and an honorable mention for the most unusual way to prepare fruit.  Everyone raved about it at the fair and I've been making it since.  I have a friend who I made it for b/c I owed her for a favor and she hugged me and thanked me over and over--that's how good this is!  I like mine fresh, not the next day.  I've put this on a crossiant and in a plain flour tortilla for a wrap.  It's always delicious!!
PS  I don't change a thing.

I made this for our break room at vacation bible school and brought bagels to spread it on.  Everyone loved it and my PICKY friend even asked for the recipe and said it's worth picking the raisins out.  I didn't have golden raisins so i used craisins and it was great. i also burned my pecans the first time so i threw in untoasted pecans (i was running late).  still great though!

Five stars up!  Added a little more curry, and didn't do the onion because I didn't have one on hand.  Served on honey wheat bread.  Yum Yum!

Not great.  Curry taste overpowered.  Skipped the celery and onion (due to taste preferences) and the salad was quite a letdown.  Especially for all the work involved.  I do like the combination of chicken with fruit, however.  And pecans always add a yummy crunch.  Worth trying...with modifications.

Wow, this was terrific-completely satisfied my craving for curry chicken salad. I would recommend using a very big bowl for mixing, and I added extra curry and omitted the onions. Fantastic! Thanks!

I used this as a guide.  I changed it a bit.   I used plain greek yogurt instead of mayo.   Was really good.  Brought it for a heart healthy pot-luck for work and got many compliments.

This was a great way to make a chicken salad.  I added some pineapple and dried cranberries.  Also, I halved the mayo and substituted with greek yogurt to cut calories.  Also, added a pinch of cayenne pepper to give it a little kick.  Very good.

So good, restaurant quality. I left out the apples, grapes &pecans second time making this. I used raisins & dried cranberries as my fruit and mixed mayo with sour cream to lighten it up, could also use greek yogurt. Quality of curry powder does make a difference. I used frontier from wholefoods. Company was impressed!

Love it!   For the chicken, I used the recipe Honey Baked Chicken II by Grechen Ramey (only I used chicken breasts and cooked them in a oven bag). I was making it for dinner and cooked twice the amount so I could make this salad too. This recipe has curry and honey in it and made the chicken super delicious.  I used dried currants instead of raisins, because I had them on hand. I would definitely do that again. They are smaller and go a little bit better with the curry flavor than raisins.  The colors are great and I think next time I might try red grapes instead and a green apple to mix it up.

Very good - although I used more miracle whip and some low fat sour cream too. Gave it a zing with some cayenne for the final touch, mmmmmm! Using candied walnuts is also a nice substitute for the pecans.

Unbelievable recipe.  It's extremely easy even for beginning cooks like myself.  I am a big curry fan so I double the amount of curry powder.  For the apple, I use pink ladies because I think the tart flavor of the apples compliments the curry. I have also experimented with different types of grapes and raisins, and the good flavor of this dish seems indestructable.  I have started doubling the quantity, throwing the ingredients in a food processor, which provides cheap, gourmet sadwhiches for a week's worth of lunches!

This was great.  I didn't use the apples or walnuts.  I replaced them w/mandarin oranges and sliced almonds and served it in pitas.  I think next time I'll add some crushed pineapple and coconut.

My family really likes this too but I didn't really taste the curry in it.  I loved the recipe and tastes great but personally I didn't really like the 'yellow' color of it from the curry as it didn't make it look as fresh as I like my chicken salad...but this recipe is definately worth making.

a very good new and different chicken salad.  i used half light sour cream and half light mayo, left out the celery (as i very much dislike celery), and added a few soy nuts for extra crunch.  even my meat & potatoes fiance liked it!

I also really enjoyed this recipe.  Perfect for a hot summer night or a nice lunch.  I changed a few things, like using craisins in place of raisins and I actually left out the grapes altogether.  I also didn't add the curry, but it still had loads of flavor.  The recipe doesn't mention it, but I think it's always important to salt and pepper to taste.  I served mine on Challah rolls with lettuce and they were great!

Absolutely delicious and so easy!  I just used what I had available in the house, which translated to: shredded chicken breasts, gala apple, red grapes, & red raisins, in addition to the other specified ingredients.  We served in on toast and it was great!

This is the best chicken salad I have ever eaten!  I used canned chicken and didn't measure the curry.  I love curry so I wasn't afraid of adding a little extra.  It came out so well.  Everyone loved it even my VERY picky husband.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is my absolute new favorite sandwhich filling. The recipe is so versatile. I always just use what's on hand. I usually double the curry powder, but I love curry. Delicious!!

Wonderful!  This got rave reviews from the husband and the teenager.  The 10yo was a bit skeptical but she ate it anyway.  Easy and quick to make with whatever's on hand...and much better than tuna salad.  I think you could use pretty much any fruit with it, though...not necessarily golden raisins and green grapes.  Craisins, regular raisins, any grapes, etc.

So amazing.  I've done two variations on the chicken - once I put the chicken breasts in the slow cooker over night so they were nice and pulled, the second time I got a honey flavored rotisserie from the supermarket.  I also used light mayo, toasted almonds instead of pecans, scallions instead of onions, red grapes for color, and some garlic powder for flavor. DELISH!!

Good recipe. I added more mayo and curry powder otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  Be aware that this recipe makes a fairly large amount. As I am the only one in my house that ate it, I ended up throwing some away. Next time I will halve the recipe.

I just made this for lunch. Everyone loved it. The curry was a perfect compliment to the salad. I used a large can of chicken and added 1 shredded carrot. Other than that I followed the directions and I will definately make this again. The flavors just melled together in perfection!

This is a tasty recipe! Next time I may add more curry and shred the chicken to make it meld together a little better, but the taste really is very lovely and satisfying! Thank you!

Fan-freaking-tastic.  Made it with leftovers from the Caribbean Roast Chicken elsewhere on the site. Also used walnuts instead of pecans.  Best chicken salad EVER.  I wish I had some right now!

Wow. What flavor and variety of textures. The only change I made was 1/2 mayo and 1/2 yogurt to reduce the calories. I use a cream style yogurt so it is pretty thick.  Definately a keeper.

I made this recipe for my sister's baby shower with the following changes... I used halved seedless red grapes, Craisens, and green apple. I added 2 teaspoons of white wine vinegar to really meld all the flavors. I also used fat free mayonnaise because the curry is a great spice blend for masking the unpleasantness of low fat or fat free mayo and make the dish virtually fat free. This was a great dish to make the day before. My only recommendation would be to cut the onion a bit to please a larger crowd. I personally thought it came out great and got many compliments but I could see it wasn't for everyone. I also had a lot left over. Curry isn't for everyone so if preparing it for a large crowd you may want to have an alternative dish for non-curry fans. Other than that I thought it was a great spin on chicken salad and if you are a curry fan, you'll love it.

This recipe was absolutely amazing!! My husband and I are on weight watchers and we fought over who got how much. That was the first time ever. I do know he added more currey and sauteed the onions since he doesn't like raw onions but I think that made it much better. Definately a keeper.

This is a good chicken salad. I substituted red onions and craisins and mixed light mayo with fat free sour cream and a lot more curry to dress it as others have suggested. I didn't think the pecans added enough to the flavor to make it worth the added calories. I will leave them out next time.

Very good!! The curry taste was very light. Not sure if its because of the brand of curry powder but i added well over what the recipe called for and still could hardly taste it. I was still not disappointed. With all the different texture in this salad it made a great sandwich. I substitued crasins for the rasins but otherwise followed the recipe. Will make again!

A great mix of flavors and textures!  I will make this again.  I was worried I might be disappointed because my expectations were so high from the other raving reviews, but I was not let down. It takes some time and a lot of chopping but makes a good sized batch.  Rather than cooking and chopping up chicken I used one large can of cooked chicken which took some of the prep hassle out of it.

I made this for a family dinner to have with pita bread. Most people enjoyed it but my husband who is just so picky didn't seem to like it much, just said it was ok. I put it together a few days early for the flavors to meld.

Let sit for atleast a few hours. I cut the mayo with some plain yogurt, and added chopped pineapple instead of grapes.  Next time a might add some shredded carrots.

A little too much onions so I cut it in half. I doubled the amount of curry. I'd cut the chicken into very smaller pieces. I reduced the mayo by 1/3 and replaced it with yogurt. I think it would be good in a pita for lunch.

WONDERFUL!!

I used Craisins instead of raisins (because I abhor raisins); I used untoasted pecans; I used much more curry than the recipe called for (maybe 3x the amount?  I didn't measure).

Otherwise, I followed the recipe to a tee and let it sit untouched for 24 hours to let the flavors mingle.  

My husband and I had it last night for dinner (kids won't eat curry) and WOW!  It was delicious!!  My husband went for seconds and thirds.  I was afraid none would be left for round two...

Thanks so much for the recipe.  It's a DEFINITE keeper.

I left out the raisins and apples, mostly because I didn't have them and left the pecans out of my husbands sandwiches but kept them in mine and put it on croissants. We both loved it! I'll try the apples in it next time just to try it out but it's not a required ingredient for a sandwich that really hits the spot.

One key thing about this recipe is you have to use Best Foods mayo not just any mayo found in nz and oz. The others are salad dressings and have a lot of sugar added to them so it makes it sweet and not nearly as nice.

I'm a huge curry fan so I'm a big fan of this recipe! I only made a few changes to adapt to what I had at home: skipped grapes & walnuts and used canned chicken breast instead. I added pinenuts, couple extra dashes of curry, a little brown sugar to sweeten it, and mixed it with some cooked & chilled bowtie pasta to make it a meal. I made sure to chill salad for about an hour to properly let the flavors combine. Perfect! Reminds me a lot of Publix's Bombay Chicken Pasta which I adore but find it a tad over-priced. It's great to have an alternative to make at home!

Great recipe! I used a container of extra firm tofu instead of chicken, and doubled the amount of curry (otherwise I found it too subtle). I also reduced the amount of mayo to about 1/4 c. light mayo and found that was plenty creamy. It helps to mix the pepper and curry powder into the mayo first, then mix it all into the salad. I usually don't like apples, but I did love them in this salad! Definitely a keeper, and very QUICK to prepare!

yummy salad. a bit chunky as opposed to creamy. grapes go bad fast so maybe use golden raisins instead? also don't burn the nuts!!

Wonderful.  I spice my pecans by putting them in a skillet with a bit of Worcestershire sauce, garlic, and a dash of cayenne pepper.  They're salty with a little surprise kick!

awesome awesome recipe....I didn't have any apple so I left it out and I'm not a fan of onion so I didn't use those either, but there was still a lot of texture and flavor in the salad.  I served it over a bed of spinach which worked great.  Oh yea, I also used dried cranberries instead of golden raisins since that's what I had on hand.  Try this recipe and don't be afraid to change it up some!

I have tried many, many recipes on here and I have only rated those I love.  This is really good!  After doing a search for chicken salad & seeing the 5- star rating on thise one, I thought I would give it a try.  I was not expecting it to be so good!  I even went to the extent of not adding the curry until the end -- added it in a little cup on the side and realized it was delicious with it!  I didn't have the raisins, so I left them out and I subbed the pecans with honey roasted almonds.  It was yummy!

My friend made this for a bridal shower we threw and it was absolutely DELICIOUS! Everyone raved over it, and I have a fairly picky palate and loved it. I highly recommend this recipe for all tastes...the curry is not too spicy and the flavors blend to make a delicious salad!  (We put it on crostini, but it would be great with honey croissants or pitas or by itself.)

The curry is what made this recipe very tasty. I increased the ingredients to make a larger amount but other than that I didn't change any of the ingredients. The crowd I served it to gave rave reviews also. Loved it and will make again. Very easy.

A delicious twist on a Waldorf salad! The curry really gives it a kick. I used Miracle Whip instead of mayo because it has more zip. I left out the onion, added extra celery, and left out the nuts so that people can add them if they choose (also didn't want the nuts to get soggy overnight). The flavors really mingle overnight and it tastes even better the next day. Thanks for the recipe!

Absolutely delightful!! I was skeptical at first so I scaled back to 2 servings. It was so delicious! I made it again the next day for my lunch and will definitely double it! I omitted the curry powder as I had none, used lemon pepper seasoning on chicken as I cooked it and added a bit of honey as was previously suggested. This is definitely going in my favorites. Thank you for posting this recipe!

This was excellent - even my kids even loved it.  I added 1 1/2 Tsp. of curry powder and 3/4 Tsp. of Lemon Pepper to add more flavor.  Excellent and easy.  I made this with "Sweet Dinner Rolls" from this site and it was a complete meal.

Really good.  I did do a couple of changes.  I used red grapes (because that's what I had).  I ran out of low fat mayonaise, so I only used about 1/2 cup.  Glad I did, becuase it was plenty and it was really yummy.  I also used a lot more curry than called for.  Started with doubling it, then just kept adding more dashes in.  I didn't measure the black pepper, but I'm sure I used more.  To cook the chicken, I baked it with just salt, pepper, and curry powder.  I could eat the whole bowl myself, but I better not.  Oh, also threw in a small dash of cayenne pepper for a little kick.  I enjoyed it, might even add a little more the next time I make it.

just terrific! I omitted apple and added a variety of dried fruits (fig and apricot) and did two kinds of raisins.  I changed the pecans to pine nuts and almond slivers and added jasmine rice to make it a full meal.  Warm, crusty bread and you are in bizniz!

This is so-o-o-o good.  Thanks Karen for the recipe.  I, like others used the canned chicken (12.5 oz. can), dried cranberries instead of raisins and added 1 T. lemon juice.  As I was taste testing this on crackers, I just couldn't stop eating it!  Needless to say I didn't have it as a sandwich until the next day cause it was so good on the crackers.  I have also made this adding a small can of drained crushed pineapple.  WoW!  Great that way also.

I boiled the chicken in beer, and used croissants as the sandwich bread. Excellent recipe. Made 12 sandwiches, and the little kids that never eat, (these were meant for the adults) were fighting over them.

Generally very tasty, but a little bland. Could probably use another flavor but I can't think what would be good.

This is my new favorite recipe from this site. So easy. I was afraid it would be too sweet, but it was perfect. I poached the chicken, and used regular raisins since I didn't have golden ones on hand. Served in pitas. Can't wait to make it again. I'll be sure to double it next time.

This was alright, but I actually didn't like the curry flavor in the chicken salad...I thought it stood out and was kind of strong...

I took this chicken salad to a baby shower last month and everybody loved it! My mom was worried about the combination of curry with fruit, but it was great.

The only changes I made were to use green onions to make the onion taste milder, and used a non-peeled Red Delicious apple to give it some color.

Definitely a keeper.

Absolutely delicious describes this recipe. I took a huge short cut and used Member's Mark canned chicken from Sam's Club and drained the liquid from the can.  I couldn't find golden raisins and had to use the regular kind and left out the pecans because I was making it for a bridal shower and didn't know who might have nut allergies.  I'm sure it is better with the addition of pecans.  This will now be my gold standard chicken salad recipe.  I'm sharing this recipe with the bride-to-be per her request.

really tasty...i left out the celery and onions, because i don't too much like them raw.  i also used pears instead of apples like another reviewer, i think.  the only thing is that it's very important to peel the pears (or, i imagine, the apples), because otherwise the skin turns brown and is unattractive.  guess that's why the recipe calls for peeled apples :)

loved it. . .i added extra grapes and celery and omitted the raisins.  would have loved more apple in it, but who knew apples were great for chicken salad??  :-)  the pecans definitely make the dish.  i made half without the curry and half with it, and both were wonderful!

Awesome flavor combo!!!  I forgot to add the onions, and it was still one of the best chicken salads I've ever had.  Great for a potluck, picnic, bridal/baby shower, or to make on Sunday for your lunches throughout the week.

this was a wonderful salad, especially the next day after the seasonings had settled in. i don't care for celery, so i left that out and instead of pecans, i added toasted walnuts. i also added a little sour cream for a smoother texture and it was a big hit!  will definitely make again. thanks for the post :)

A very tasty dish that both my husband and I enjoyed. Things I did different, I used 2 chicken breasts instead of 4 (only 2 of us to feed), and half the amount of onion (not to thrilled with raw onions). Overall a very good recipe that allows for changes according to invidual taste.

Well, I went to the store with out my shopping list and needless to say had to count on my memory for ingredients. I forgot the celery and bought walnuts instead of pecans. Turned out great even with my minor errors!! (I do like walnuts more then pecans, so if your the same- I would recommend that.)

Wow!  Love this recipe as written.  The second time I made it I did change it some to make it Weight Watcher friendly.   I omitted the pecans and increased the celery and the grapes, and I changed the mayo to light miracle whip.   I couldn't believe I could have 1/4 of the recipe modified this way for only 6 points!  Love it!!  Thanks!

i didn't have pecans or grapes but still turned out great. i soaked my raisins to make them plumper, though, and used 1/2 mayo,1/2 sour cream. As others suggested, let sit overnight as the flavor is 10 times better the next day. thank you for a great recipe!

I loved this!  Will be making this all the time from now on.  I also cheated by using canned chicken, but it was still good!  Next time perhaps I'll try using cooked chicken

Fantastic! It was great on a large bed of spinach. I added a little extra mayo. The curry flavor was very light, so it didn't scare away the kids.

Delicious!  Made a day ahead for a holiday get together and everyone loved it.  I used granny smith apples, craisins, dried apricots, and green grapes as well as vegan (egg-free) mayo.  Lovely light curry flavor.  Thanks!

I strayed from the recipe a lot but it still came out really good.  I had all the ingredients except the grapes, celery and raisens.  Yes thats a big stray haha i know but i wanted to try anyway.  So I mixed everything else together and it came out so-so, it needed the sweet element that no doubt the grapes/raisens would have given it... so i chopped up a good amount of the vlasic sweet bread and butter pickles and it did the trick.  the pickles gave it a very suddle sweetness that was definetly an improvement. Since I didn't follow the recipe I don't think it fair to give it anything less than 5 stars, as I suspect that my 4 star concoction would have been a 5 star had i had all the ingredients! :)  I will make it again using all the correct ingredients next time.

This recipe is fantastic.  It's a perfect blend of textures and flavors.  I used regular raisins and red grapes with no ill effects.  I would suggest adding the pecans right before you eat the salad so they don't get soggy.  They added a lot of flavor and crunchiness when I first put them in, but when they got soggy I couldn't taste them as much.  Wonderful on pumpernickel bread!

This is an excellent chicken salad.  I love the curry flavor.  Made it three times in two weeks because my parents loved it so much.  I added a little extra curry for some spice and extra apple.  It really is better the next day so make sure you let it set in the fridge so the flavors combine together.  Will be making again and again.  Thanks!!

This is very good.   I just finished making it, and I am eating it before its chilled and I know it is going to be even better when its cold. The chicken breasts I used were huge, so I ended up adding a lot more mayo and LOT more curry powder.  Didnt have any nuts, and I added two big spoonfuls of mango chutney to it, which was a mistake.

For an island-themed party, I wanted a Hawaiian Chicken Salad so I modified this by substituting pineapple chunks for the apples, and cashews for the walnuts. I also used a mixture of sour cream and mayonnaise rather than just mayo. Just before serving I sprinkled with toasted coconut. Delicious! Great recipe.

I didn't use the apple, raisins, or pecans.  Instead used extra celery and grapes.  I used red onion for the onion, and red seedless for the grapes.  Also added a little extra black pepper, and used chicken I had roasted the night before.  Absolutely fantastic and delicious!  Next time will use even more black pepper.

Made this for Father's Day picnic, among several other dishes, and this was the one he went crazy over. He's still eating it, now, in front of the T.V.
He doesn't like fruit or nuts in his salads so I left out the raisins, grapes and pecans. I kept in the apple (Honeycrisp) for sweetness and chopped them pretty small so it's hard to tell it's in there. I added about 6X the curry and about 1/4 t ground cloves.
I used the breasts of rotisserie chicken I bought pre-cooked.

I love this recipe for an easy meal prep item. I love it over lettuce or on bread but I do only use 2/3 of the mayo called for. Sooo yummy with bursts of sweet, salty, crunchy, and creamy curry deliciousness

I tried this for a company potluck, as I wanted something gluten free. I've made chicken or tuna curry salads often for myself, but I wanted something a little more dressed up and didn't want to use my usual canned chicken. This recipe looked good. I made the salad following the recipe exactly, except I reduced the amount of onion like many reviewers suggested, and for me it was too bland and the ratios of chicken to sauce and everything else was too high. Maybe my chicken breasts were too big? So, I added more of everything, tripled the amount of grapes and about 50% more of everything else. I doubled the mayo and probably quadrupled the curry. It was still too bland. I added sugar to sweeten the sauce and more salt. The apples were especially good. I hadn't thought to pair them with curry before and I like it a lot. More fruit and seasoning was much better. I plan to serve with mini pitas or just eat it by itself.

Ah! How do I edit my review? I wasn’t finished :( Anyway, I had some leftover shredded chicken that I needed to find something to do with, and I found this recipe and tried it, even though I didn’t have all the ingredients listed. I used shredded chicken, a large green apple, raisins, mayo (then ran out of mayo so added a bit of sour cream), pepper, and a bit of coriander and cumin since I didn’t have curry powder. Let me say, even just these ingredients made this chicken it amazing! I can’t wait to eat my delicious repurposed shredded chicken for lunch over the next two days (I’m getting hungry just thinking about it). Will definitely have to try again with all of the standard ingredients.

I will definitely make it again! Obviously you can do a few substitutions and  omissions if you feel like it. I didn’t use onion because my family isn’t fans, but I thought the curry flavor was perfect! Make it the night before if you can, better the next day!

I did 2 cans of chickpeas instead of chicken, subbed a bell pepper instead of celery (I don't like celery), and I didn't have pecans. It was pretty amazing fresh, I can't wait to eat it tomorrow when the flavors have mingled!

I replaced half the mayonnaise with yogurt to lessen the caloric impact, and the yogurt complemented the curry wonderfully.  I strongly suggest increasing the amount of curry powder, pecans, and celery to add a nice texture as well as making the dish more flavorful. I also used green onions instead of yellow, and salted the salad to taste, as the recipie does not call for any.
After I poached the chicken, I food-processed half of the chicken, and cut the remainder up into small cubes.  
I also recommend using red grapes or dried cherries or raisins, as the finished product  was one-note and not very colorful otherwise.

This is equally delicious served in a lettuce cup or as a sandwich filling. Both sweet curry or hot curry works in this salad. I have used prepared commercial diced chicken when I was pressed for time with good results.

I literally registered allrecipes account just to review this. Such a great recipe! I've made it a half a dozen times probably. I'm lazy and I just buy a rotisserie chicken from the store and shred it. I also use homemade mayo and have found that sesame oil based mayo lends a really awesome flavor!

I'm also not a huge fan of raw onion so I usually omit it or use onion powder if I have some handy.

I love this chicken salad. Easy to make. Simple ingredients. I like using red grapes for additional color and a tiny bit more curry than the recipe calls for.

Family liked it. Guests liked it. Only changes were use of onion powder, red seedless grapes, and cashews. This was due to several errors shopping at the store. I came as close as I could to the original recipe. Double recipe only lasted for 2 days before it was gone.
I strongly recommend a sweet onion, minced, in the quantity specified.  I discovered this in my second and third batches. A regular onion is too strong.

Great recipe! I used shallots instead of onions, red seedless grapes instead of green and switched half the mayo for fat free yogurt. Topped the salad on lettuce and served with ritz crackers. Delicious!

Made it twice both times using rotisserie chickens. If you use rotisserie chicken make sure the pieces are cut up small.  Used dark raisins instead of golden ones and it did not impact it much. Great flavors especially left in fridge overnight. I used half a cup of low fat mayo with olive oil and 1/2 cup of low fat Daisy sour cream.Added some fresh squeezed lemon juice (only about 1 TBSP). So incredible yummy!. Both times I made it everyone loved it I served the first version  on top of cut up fresh ciabatta half slices but it was hard to keep the salad on top of the bread...Second time I diced the chicken pieces smaller and served it inside croissants. Do not overtoast the pecans...Overall, wonderful mingled flavors!!! Thanks for sharing.

I omitted the celery, used the yogurt and the red onion. I've made this twice now, once with macadamia nuts and tonight with pine nuts.

Everyone LOVES this recipe. I double the curry because we love curry and add crushed red pepper for more heat.

This Chicken salad is just the best!! I love curry, so I usually add a bit more. In the summer we travel with our pets and are unable to keep them in the car while we go inside a restaurant. I  will make this chicken salad up the day before (keeps well in the cooler while traveling) and we find a nice shady park to have our lunch. I know I could buy already made chicken salad in the grocery store, but look at all those ingredients. I know what is in mine.

I found this recipe to be very good.  For variation I finely processed 1/3rd of the ingredients, roughly shredded another third, then cubed the remaining. I felt this released the flavors while preserving the texture. Excellent flavor composition.

I use red onion instead of green only because i prefer red. I also use walnuts instead of pecans. That just depends on what's in the pantry that day. I like to serve it on croissants.

Excellent dish just the way it's written, but it also can accept many modifications to fit your likes and dislikes.  Add more celery/onion/apple/etc or leave them out - whatever you prefer.  Same with the curry - if you love it, or have a mild curry in the house, add lots.  If your curry is on the strong side, tone it down.  Most of the time I cook fresh, but this is one of those dishes that does well with canned chicken.  So if it's summertime, no heating up the house and you still have a delicious meal.  Make it early in the day, or even the night before so that flavors can blend. Thank you Karen - I make this one regularly.

What a delightful mix of favors! You don't know what combo you will get with each bite! I roasted an organic whole chicken from another All Recipes recipe with an onion and fresh rosemary inside of it, cooled it and deboned it. Therefor I doubled the portions and added cranberries, apples, pecans & red onions as well as the rest of the ingredients mentioned and this is a hit!!! I will make this all the time. SO happy I tried it!

Subbed sour cream for mayo, and quarter cup minced scallions for onion, and 1/2 C. pomegranate raisins instead of grapes, topped with toasted coconut. Added dash garlic salt, 6 T. of curry powder, 1 t. coriander, 1 t. cayenne and half cup honey. I also added a good dose of salt and some cracked black pepper to taste.  Fabulous!!!! Made tea sandwiches with this for a large ladies luncheon and everyone asked for the recipe.

Ditched the sultanas, celery, and pecans (picky eaters in our household). Substituted the onion with scallions. Added garam masala and tumeric for a bit more kick and flavor. Good outline to let your impulses take you.

This was delicious!  Best chicken salad recipe I've tried (so far) from this site.  I shredded a rotiserrie chicken and also added about a quarter cup of vanilla greek yogurt and a little more cumin than recommended in the ingredients.  I cannot wait to make this again.

Loved it the first time I made it, but we could hardly taste the curry. The second time I made it, I added 3/4 tsp curry and it was just right! Next time I'm going to use red seedless grapes instead of white grapes. It looks lovely in the picture with the red grapes and they are yummy too!

I used left overs from a roasted chicken and it's absolutely delicious. The blend of flavors is perfect. I didn't have grapes and I didn't miss them but I'm sure it would be great with them too. I also left out the toasted pecans because I'm not a fan of nuts in my chicken salads.  I will make this many times in the future.

I loved this! made a few modifications based on what I had on hand but it was great no matter what. A healthy alternative would definately be to use nonfat plain yogurt instead of mayo.

This is the best chicken salad I have ever had!  I made it last night after stumbling upon this website and ate it for breakfast, lunch and dinner today!  I brought some to a friend for a lunch treat today and she said it was the best curry chicken salad she ever had too!  My husband and kids even loved it.  I am now planning a "girls" luncheon just so I can impress more friends with it!  I might change the green grapes to red grapes just for color but otherwise I would leave it as is.  I sauteed my chicken breasts in vegetable oil to cook them and doubled the recipe.  I think it would be great with any chicken, I may even try it with some shortcuts chicken if I'm in a hurry.

EXCELLENT! However after reading others suggestions, I added 1/2 c. of plain yogurt to make more moist (A MUST), doubled the curry for more flavor, and a dash of sugar. If boiling the chicken breast, add chicken buillion (if have)and pepper to the water for more flavor. Everyone loved it at my ladies gathering. I would say yogurt or sour cream is essential with the mayo, otherwise, too dry. TRY THIS even if you don't have the extras like raisins or pecans but must have the fruit.

My new favorite chicken recipe. No worries about the ingredient list - just use whatever you have on hand: mayo/sour cream, red apples/green apples, pecans/almonds, whatever! I followed others' suggestions and added a little lemon juice and honey. Fabulous!

I absolutely LOVE this recipe.  I think my favorite thing about it is the versatility. More curry or less, any color raisin, craisins, green grapes, red grapes, walnuts, slivered almonds, any kind of apple or leave it out altogether...mix and match however you want and it always turns out amazing. (the only thing i omit is the onions because i loathe them). Thank you so much for an amazing, and healthy (with low or no fat mayo) recipe!!

This was wonderful.  Very much a gourmet type chicken salad.  i left out the celery and raisins only because I didn't have any.  I also used red curry paste mixed into the mayo instead of curry powder because i didn't realize I was out.  But, I think I will make it that way again.  It had a nice tiny bit of heat in the background.  oh, i also used white and dark meat chicken.

What can I say, its all gone already. Such an easy dish. I did add more curry and kept out the raisins and apple for my husband and I used red grapes instead. Even my 3 toddlers LOVED it and that truly says it ALL.

Loved it. Only addition was a bit of cumin which I didn't even notice. Never really liked chicken salad because of the mayo but this was delicious. Made with Tofu Mayo from this site.

Mmmm... It's not the first time I have tasted these flavors together. Reminds me of a hot entree my mom used to do with turkey, rice, curry sauce, and all those similar toppings. Anyway, I had to substitute yellow bell peppers for grapes (sweet, crunchy, juicey??) since we accidently ate all the grapes before I made this. Woops! Was still good. Also added shredded coconut. I think this would be good as a pasta salad if you substitute shell macaroni for chicken. I'll have to try that some day...

Great flavor and not a lot of effort!  Like everyone else, I played around with how much fruit and vegetables I used (I liked it heavy on the grapes and a little lighter on the onions) but it turned out wonderfully.  Also great the next day, when the flavors have time to sit together.  Will definitely make it again!  Thanks!

I used dried cranberries instead of the raisins, and took another reviewers advice and just used the food processor. Easy and delicious for summer. Great with mini pitas.

I loved this! I ended up having to use a little bit more mayo than the recipe calls for to get the creamy texture I wanted (almost 1 cup total). I also omitted the onion, used dark raisins and red grapes, and substituted toasted almonds for the pecans. It tasted wonderful the first day and even better the second. Thanks!

We loved this recipe. I used the chicken breasts from 2 rotisserie chickens, and they worked great. Also omitted raisins just as a personal preference. It was easy to make and had a great flavor. We enjoyed it on its own, but even better on croissants. I wouldn't leave out the nuts; nuts really make this dish, but I might experiment with almonds or cashews. We'll definitely make again.

I was craving chicken curry salad, but wanted something different than my ordinary one and this lived up to its 5 stars!  I'm not a fan of raisins or celery, so I omitted them and used Greek Yogurt and 1 Tbsp mayo.  Served it on melba toast-like bread and am still eating it as I'm typing this!!

My husband loves curry and I barely tolerate it, but even I liked this recipe.  I used walnuts instead of pecans and less mayo than the recipe called for.

One bite and you'll be hooked. I added extra mayo to make it a little creamier- perfect!

This was good--a good base. I added cashews instead of pecans, and will probably try walnuts as well. I also added mandarin oranges. I used canned chicken which was ok, although next time will use cut up chicken. But for a fast lunch, this was good.

To me this recipe was just missing something....  Couldn't tell ya what tho.  :-/  Next time I plan to add more grapes and apple.  I had a friend suggest doing equal parts mayo and miracle whip and adding some hot sauce.

This was delicious!! I ate it on pita bread. I didn't have any grapes or raisins so I just left them out this time, but even without them it was fabulous. I could see how they would be good though, so I'll add them both in next time.

Delicious! A big hit in our house, served as both a wrap and on lettuce leaves.  I shredded rotisserie chicken, 1/2 med Braeburn apple, red seedless grapes, 1T Mexican crema, 5T mayo (1/3 c) mayo (3T reg and 2 T lite), 2 T fresh lemon juice (plus enough to squeeze on the diced apple), 2T fresh chopped parsley and 1/2t dried tarragon, and 1/4 t garlic salt.  I used white onion and found it too sharp -- yellow would be better. I will make this from now on!  Thanks!

I'm not a fan of curry powder nor raisins. So, I eliminated both of those and this was fantastic! I served it with a small salad of mixed greens, balsamic vinegar & olive oil, topped with some feta.

I made this just as written (maybe a little more curry powder because I love the extra spice!) and it was fantastic. I had my mother over for lunch and we put it on salads. I had it the following day on a wheat wrap, and it was great both ways!

I loved it and can't wait to dig into the leftovers tomorrow night.I worked with what I had so I used halved seedless green and black grapes, almond slices and walnuts instead of pecans, dark raisins and a lot less (about 3/4 to 1/2) mayo (don't like mayo that much). hint:wash onions in some vinegar and water if you don't like the harsh 'oniony' flavor for 30 seconds. wash a great dish, my boyfriend and I loved it. He didn't even notice the celery in it... which he hates!!! Delicioso. will be making again for sure.

We made this yesterday and it was wonderful! We did not have grapes on hand, nor the golden raisins, but regular raisins worked fine and the tastes melded terrifically. I have a "favorite" chicken salad recipe I usually use, but this a terrific way to mix up the normal routine.

Salad was okay, I advise if your not a curry fan either to put less of the amount poster or ommited. I like curry but obviously after making this recipe, i realized im not that crazy about it. To me it overpowered the salad, my husband didnt even realized there were fruits in the salad. Dont regret making it but wouldnt make it again.

This is a truly fabulous chicken salad! I make it several times a year and whenever I bring it for lunch, my coworkers rave about it. You can sub Miracle Whip for regular mayo (that's all I had in the fridge one day), using a little bit less MW than you would mayo.

This is so good, I could have eaten it all before putting it in the fridge to chill. I used both red and green grapes and added dried cranberries, but otherwise I made no changes. Wonderful recipe to serve up on a bed of lettuce.

Absolutely delicious. I made some changes - Used chicken chunks, included sweet pepper and parsley, used dark grapes, apple and raisins and added mustard when mixing it up. Placed this salad in roti skin and added golden apple chutney on top. Again, it was absolutely delicious.

It was amazing after the first day.  When I first tried it after making it I was not impressed.  It was a bit bland for my taste, but after it was in the fridge for at least a day the taste improved so much that both my husband loved it.  I should have added more apples and I forgot to add the raisins, so that is why I am giving it five stars (I'm sure it would have been better if I followed the directions).

missing something- tasty, but lacked kick.  i sub 1/2 cup of low fat yogurt, and then 1/4 cup of mayo. used 1 tsp honey, 3 tsps of curry, juice of 1/2 lemon... maybe 1/2 tsp of ground ginger, cooked the onions to mellow out... might try more spice next time

Very good!  Love making this when we are tired of lunchmeat sandwiches.  I serve it on a toasted pita.  I use low fat mayo, and and leave out the pecans ( just because I don't care for pecans ) and it's a low-fat healthy lunch!

Made this today and I was very pleased. Used 4 large breasts and cooked the onion and celery so I used a bit more.  The grapes were popular so next time I will put in more of them.
It had a very nice flavor. Do make it in advance.

Oh my, this was yummy!  I was a little worried because I'm not a big fan of curry, but the reviews were so good I had to try it.  Glad I did!!  My chicken breasts were really big, so I only used three.  I used red grapes for color and a little extra mayo.  Definitely let it sit in the fridge overnight--the flavors really come together.  A nice change from plain old chicken salad--a definite keeper!!

This was pretty good. All I had on hand was chicken, curry, mayo, green onion and grapes and it still came out great! Thanks for the idea! Will make again

LOVED IT!!!  I added some honey like I had read in other reviews, used almonds instead of pecans, regular raisins, and left out the apple and grapes.  I served this for a girls luncheon on a bed of lettuce and spooned ginger dressing on top.  (Just like the dressing served in Japenese restauratns). I also served it with mixed berries on the side. EVERYONE LOVED IT!!!!!  I will do this over and over. THANK YOU
