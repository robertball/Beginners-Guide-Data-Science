I'm glad I read lutzflcat's review before I started these cupcakes.  I trust her reviews and I knew I would have to do some tweaking, also.  I had a 20oz. can of pineapple rings that I was using with this recipe.  I drained the pineapple and saved the juice.  The juiced equaled 3/4 cup, so my first concern was one cake mix having 2 1/4 cups of liquid with the water, oil and juice.  I used it anyways, and the cupcakes baked up fine.  My muffin tins aren't huge, and I got 38 cupcakes from this recipe, a lot more than the 12 the recipe states!  Because I got so many cupcakes from this recipe, I had to make a batch and a half of the brown sugar/butter combination.  I made 24 with dark brown sugar and 14 with light brown sugar.  The recipe does not tell you when to flip the cupcakes out of the pan.  WAIT for 5 minutes before flipping.  This gives the butter mixture time to set up.  It will make a mess, so make sure you have a cookie sheet or newspapers under the cooling rack when you flip them.  The taste is wonderful, and we actually prefer the ones made with the dark brown sugar.

First, I don't have a clue where you'd find a 12.5 oz can of pineapple (it's 8 or 20 oz in my area).  I used a 20-oz can, and measured out 12.5 oz.  Second, there's almost too much of everything for 12 cupcakes.  I filled the muffin cups up to the top (trying to use all of the batter) which made them dome too much, and I still had enough batter left for another 2-3 cupcakes.  The topping overflowed/oozed out of the muffin cup spilling onto the bottom of the oven, baking on to the top of the muffin pan, and leaving a mess to clean up.  I left the cupcakes cool completely (recipe doesn't tell you what to do), put a large cutting board on top of the muffin pan, and then flipped it over.  If I were to make again, I think I'd try an 8-oz can of pineapple tidbits, 2/3 cup of brown sugar, and about 5 Tbsp of butter.  That way the muffin cup would be less full leaving room for more cake batter and,  hopefully, using up all of it.  I'm giving this 4 stars because in spite of these things, they were moist and full of flavor, but some tweaking is necessary to make this a 5 star recipe.

My husband says it's the best pineapple upside-down cake he's ever had.  It was very moist!  HOWEVER, this obviously makes more than 12 cupcakes!  I just made mine in a 9X13 pan (using a 20oz. can of tidbits)and it came out perfect! Because of the different pan, I cooked mine for about 30-35 min.  Very good and I will make this again!

This was easy and fast. I did measure out my brown sugar and used 1t per cupcake, also did the same with butter and used 1/2t...Only had pineapple rings so used one per cupcake, left out the cherries and added the 1 cup of juice from the can in place of water....Yummy

A whole box of cake mix was way too much for 12 cupcakes. I used the cupcake liners and they came out swimming in butter on the bottom even though I didn't use all the melted butter. I made a round upside down cake with the leftover cake mix repeating process for the cupcakes.

This dessert came out perfect.  I made them in muffin pans (not cupcake).  They look so pretty when they are removed from the pan.  Everyone loved them!

These cupcakes had an awesome taste.  They looked just like the picture.  My only problem was they crumbled apart (seemed too moist) so if I made it again I'd use a little less juice in the cake mix.

Next time I will add more butter and brown sugar at the bottom but the cakes were really good (even a few days later).

Love the recipe, tastes great, was a huge hit! Easy to make, but directions are missing the amount to put in the cupcake tin, (i.e. fill 2/3 full) and how it should look after they come out of the oven. Mine were puffy looking but then collapsed as they cooled, which apparently was how it was supposed to work. Also I added the butter to the cupcake liners first before the brown sugar and it worked fine, this way I was able to add the pineapple and cherry and see where they were so it didn't look odd.

This is quick and easy and I make it often.  I have found that it works best in a mini-bundt cake pan without liners.  Drizzling the brown sugar with butter is completely unnecessary and I omit the butter altogether.   This makes 24 mini-bundt cakes.

I've made similar cupcakes, but started using foil liners so they can be taken to pot lucks. Paper liners get soggy with all the butter, then lose their shape.  Thanks for your recipe! Shame on me, but I like to have redi whip in a can on them. Its fun for kids to add their own. Most cake mixes make about 24, so yeah, it makes more than 12 cupcakes!
