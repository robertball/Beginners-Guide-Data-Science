This was so quick to make and very tasty.  My husband loved it and I shared with co-workers.  They have the recipe now. One thing I changed was the amount of sugar, cut it down to 1/4 cup. And instead of ramen noodles I used La Chow crispy noodles for individual servings.

To save on fat, I toasted the almonds in the oven rather than cooking with oil and used a little less oil for the dressing, as well (with no sacrifice to flavor).  Added  sliced red bell pepper for color and some leftover shredded grilled chicken breast.  I didn’t have any ramen noodles, so I used chow mein noodles instead and would use them again.   Served with toasted baguette with a yummy compound butter that I’d mixed up early in the day.  The dressing had just the right amount of sweetness and is mellow in taste.  This was an absolutely delicious salad which will be made often in this house.  Thanks, Cookmaster, thoroughly enjoyed your recipe.

Loved this.  Made a small switch to chow mein noodles instead of ramen and am looking to try it with spinach instead of bok choy.

We got some Bok choy in our bountiful basket and this recipe was a great way to use it up. Who knew that raw Bok choy could be so tasty?  Made a few changes- added one sweet red pepper, decreased the sugar to 1/3 cup, the oil to 1/4 cup (and used grapeola oil for a light fresh taste).  Added about a tsp of toasted sesame oil for flavor.  Oh, and we didn't have balsamic vinaigrette- so we just used a really high quality aged balsamic vinegar.  Next time, I think I will add a can of oranges.

Delicious!! My husband does not usually eat anything green.  He used the left over salad for his lunch.   I replaced halved cashews for the sliced almonds.  This added to the asian flavor.  I reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup and added an additional tablespoon of soy to reduce the sweet taste. (I may try 1/4 cup sugar the next time.) I replaced the balsamic vinaigrette with straight balsamic vinegar and topped off with red pepper flakes.

I love the crunch in this salad! The possibilities are endless. I added chicken, carrots, jalapeños and omitted the sugar. The balsamic gives enough sweetness for me and I love throwing in any veggies I have on hand. Keeper!!

This was so good, I couldn't stop eating it! Per other reviews I reduced the sugar to 1/4 and added a sliced red pepper.  Otherwise I followed the directions exactly and we loved it.  Definitely a keeper!

Took to a pot luck dinner.  Excellent reviews and several wanted the recipe.  Husband really liked it..  Next time I may cut the sugar down a bit and add some bacon.

Very light & refreshing. I've never had bok choy before & will make this salad again as is or for a main meal with grilled chicken included for a hot summer day meal. I'm changing this from 4 stars to 5 now that hubby has made several times.  I absolutely love this salad.  We use chow mein noodles but will try with ramen one of these times.

Followed suggestions of others and used chow mein noodles.  Julienne sliced carrots added a splash of color for a nice presentation.
