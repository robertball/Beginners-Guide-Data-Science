This was excellent! I did use tablespoons instead of teaspoons for the vinegar to offset the sweet to suit our personal preference. This was still pretty thin at 15 minutes so I left it on for another 10 minutes to get the sauce the thickness I wanted. This was easy, unique, flavorful, and one I will most definitely make again. I think it would be even better over skillet fried potatoes instead of rice. Don't forget the Sriracha!
