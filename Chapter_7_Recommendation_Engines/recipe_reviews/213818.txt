I was so happy to find a recipe for macaroons that didn't use sweetened condensed milk. It was a little too sweet for my family, but it had a good texture and it was easy to make. I also had to lengthen the baking time to about 30 minutes.

Honestly, this was my first macaroon recipe I've ever tried.  I liked it! I doubled the recipe and followed exactly.  The cookies were light and fluffy, yet chewy at the same time.  We are big coconut lovers so this was great!

Very nice light cookie to have with tea. They turned out more of a meringue then a macaroon cookie. I would recommend using parchment paper to line the cookie sheet if your pan is not non stick. I had to cook the cookies 10 minutes longer due to high humidity. I will make them again.

I added more lime and some lime zest and skipped out on the cocoa powder (my husbands request.) We really liked the cookies although it took me 15 minutes to get the meringue right. Next time I'm doubling the recipe because my husband gobbled them all up so fast!

Mine came out nothing like the picture...needed more coconut? They were really sweet and flat.  Looked more like cocoa cookies than macaroons.  The taste was good, I just wish they looked like the picture.

I took it to a gathering where the theme was Thai food. Since mangoes were out of season, I made this. really good! Only thing is, DO NOT use sweetened coconut if you think it is too sweet. :)

very good but needs more lime and is more like a meringue  cookie as opposed to a macaroon.

Just awesome. It took me a couple tries to get it right--looking up a tutorial on how to make macaroons properly really helped. I also found that I had to shop the bulk aisle in my Whole Foods to find coconut that was not sweetened. Now these are part of my regular cookie arsenal, and really add some variety to it.

Mine didn't turn out very well! I followed the instructions and the meringue turned out well, but I think they needed twice the amount of coconut to really be macaroons. They weren't bad tasting, but the texture was off. Will probably not make again.
