Holy cow, was this dish delicious!  The sauce is outstanding!  The secret is knowing how much salt and pepper to use.  I was very conservative in following the "salt and pepper to taste" instructions, and the dish was okay.  I sprinkled more on my individual serving, and it was to die for!  I will proudly make this again and again.  The only thing I will change is to use much more rice in the stuffing.

Beautiful peppers but not spicy enough for my taste.  I would increase the amount of oregano and the allspice.  Very good sauce.

Really great! The sauce is outstanding. I'm not a big fan of green peppers, admittedly, as I think they are too watery. Being of Czech ancestry, I wanted to try this, despite my green pepper distaste. I added chopped garlic to the beef mixture, other than that I didn't change a thing.

This is a great recipe.  It would be improved on only by the addition of garlic.  Never pureed the sauce and was still good with roasted garlic mashed potatoes.

I've made this 4 times now and it is fantastic. I dont know how anyone can go wrong with this recipe. It has wonderful flavor and is easy to make. I basically followed the recipe and made sure I had fresh spices. I love this and I NEVER eat stuffed peppers...that is until now!

This is a fabulous recipe, with some changes.  First, I added a lot more spices to the meat mixture, including cumin, basil, oregano, garlic.  It was very flavorful. I used a jarred spaghetti sauce and added onions and sour cream to it.  I put a bit of asiago cheese and chedder cheese at the bottom of each pepper, which I cut into the boat style.  And added mozzerella on top.  I served it with a zuccini and summer squash in the side and a good bread.  Yummy.  Couldn't taste the all spice at all - should probably use more next time.

This is very good!  I used up some leftover shredded beef from the Italian beef recipe on this site instead of ground beef, though, and that was yummy.  Added extra whole allspice too!

The best stuffed green peppers I have ever tasted.  My partner doesn't usually like stuffed peppers but she really liked these ones.  The sauce was incredible, I think I may make it alone as a creamy tomato soup, it was that good. I made a few substitutions: I used veggie ground roung instead of beef, yogourt instead of sour cream, and I didn't have marjoram so I omitted it.  It would probably be even better with beef, but making it vegetarian cut down on the fat.

These peppers are wonderful.  I was out of rice so I used garlic and herb couscous instead.  I had to scale down the recipe--I made 2 peppers and halved the sauce.  By having only 2 peppers in the baking dish, I needed to remove the sauce ingredients after about an hour or they would have burned.  As others have said, the sauce really makes this dish.  Definitely something I'll make again.

I made a healthier version - used 2 pounds of turkey instead of ground meat (adding garlic to meat mixture) and used brown rice...did 6 peppers instead of 8...other than that followed the recipe.  IT was great!!!  Wonderful thank you so much for alllowing me to add this to my recipe box.

I made these for friends for dinner last night. I agree with the other reviewers that the stuffing wa a bit bland I would recommend adding tbsp (or more) of allspice and a healthy portion of fresh ground pepper and at a minimum a tbsp of salt to the meat mixture in addition to the spices added to the sauce.  All in all it after a liberal dose of salt and pepper to the peppers once cut in half it was Delicious and so close to my friends Walters mom's from Austria. Thank you for a pepper recipe I love!

I really didn't care for this much. Interesting idea, but didn't come together for me. We put ketchup on the stuffing and it was pretty good... kinda like meatloaf baked in the peppers.

This recipe was great. My husband wanted stuffed peppers and this one scored high. The sour cream made the sauce creamy and added great flavor. I used brown rice and cooked it before adding to the meat. It worked well.

My Peppers came out great.  I did not make the tomato sauce to pour over them, Instead I used salas  YUM YUM The only thing I changed was I add celery chopped fine and I just added everything raw and cooked in toaster Oven or 40 Min. I might next time add 2 eggs. It only called for 1/2 egg but I put 1 whole egg.  Meat did not bind together like it should.. But it was very Good. I'll make it again

Overall I thought this recipe was great. I used a bit more rice and substituted ground deer for the beef. Allspice is my favorite item that I keep in my pantry and would use it in everything if I could. I wanted a bit more of the spice factor so I threw in some nutmeg and cinnamon as well, sounds strange but it's great. The sauce put this over the edge, my boyfriend was drooling. This will be one of my "go to" recipes!

5 stars based on my changes/substitutions (wanted to make it a little healthier and address the bland problem previous reviewers mentioned):
Turkey Italian sausage (cases removed) instead of beef
1/2c Quinoa, 1/2c wild rice instead of white rice
Plain yogurt instead of sour cream
Egg white instead of whole egg

The sauce is absolutely wonderful... I'll be making this one again for sure! Served with a small side of pasta.

These are by far the best stuffed peppers I have ever had! The sauce reminded me of a paprikas sauce that you would find in chicken paprikas. I made a couple of adjustments. I used quinoa instead of rice (which I roasted in a pan with garlic before cooking and cooked in chicken broth) and added garlic and some worshshire as well. My husband, father in law and kids absolutely loved it! Great flavor! This recipe is a keeper for sure! Hats off to whoever came up with this! You rock!

Good recipe.  I Too enjoyed the sauce.  One thing  I do is to slit a few holes in the bottom of the pepper so fat doesn't lay in the bottom.  Other than that I pretty much followed the recipe.

Very easy to make. Wasn't sure if I should cook the rice completely as thought it would get mushy from overcooking. Why can't it go in raw? I liked the idea of not cooking the peppers first. They baked just fine in the oven. I think it could have used more rice. I used 2 eggs and 3 lbs. grd. beef as the peppers were large and it worked out well. I have tried other recipes for stuffed peppers from All Recipes. This one was good but I think I would try other recipes just to compare.

The pepper filling needs a tad more salt but the sauce makes this unusual and satisfying.

Prepared this tonight, DH and I both enjoyed it. I prefer the style of stuffed peppers where the meat is not cooked first. Typically I don't feel I have the right to review someone's recipe if I alter it, but since I thought the basic recipe was quite good, this time I will.  I sauteed some finely chopped red/green pepper and garlic with the onions and used about 2 cups of cooked rice to 1lb of ground beef. I also used fresh herbs in the meat mixture (oregano,parsley,basil)I used the same fresh herbs plus garlic in the sauce, I also added 2T sugar and splash of red wine to the sauce which I simmered for about 30 minutes before pouring over the peppers.  I also par-cooked my peppers by steaming for about 10 minutes before I stuffed them. I agree with others, this sauce is really good!

These were OK. Unfortunately I don't have anything useful to add either positive or negative. I was an easy way to use up the abundance of peppers I had in the garden.

I liked this recipe because it did not have cheese. The flavor was good even though I did not have any marjoram or the sour cream for the sauce (I also just used ground spices).

I’m a use what’s on hand kind of cook.  This was frozen chopped peppers and a can of rotel and half a can of whole plum tomatoes.  I also cooked it all on top of the stove in one pot except for the rice I added after boiling.  I didn’t have allspice berries.  My kid said it was good.

This recipe needs more reviews. I've been making it for several years. it's lovely and worth the extra spices. It's  as good on a weeknight as it is for a dinner party. The presentation is lovely, the flavors are bright and yet comforting and familiar.  I have no recommendations,  because the recipe is very difficult to screw up.  great even for beginner cooks.  lovely leftovers.

These were very good. I used red bell peppers. They were very tasty and the sauce turned out to be a really unexpected treat. The peppers were good in lunches the next day as well.

I cooked "1 cup" of dry rice; not one cup cooked.  It really needed tomato sauce as well.

BLAND, BLAND, BLAND.  I really had high hopes for this recipe and thought with the sauce it would be worth the effort, but I was sadly mistaken.  Slaved over a hot stove on a hot/humid 80 degree day with no AC to use up some peppers from the garden and after the first bite new it was not meant to be!!!  Will not make again.
