I'm not an expert on Irish Soda Bread, but I couldn't tell that it had artificial sweetner.  Tasted good.

As a baker, I'm aware of the need for gluten-free, vegan, and sugar-free products. I also feel that there's no substitute for sugar, butter, and eggs. That said: I think Splenda is a really good product—unlike other sweeteners, you can use it cup-for-cup in recipes. I’d like to experiment more with half Splenda, half sugar. Anyway: this Irish soda bread. I really liked it. Caraway seed is a standard variation in many soda bread recipes. This baked well and the flavor was good. If you’re baking for diabetics, you might have to watch the sugars in the currants, but for dieters, this is a great quick bread recipe.

I agree with the reviewer below.  This looked very appealing, but I was a bit dissappointed with the flavor. I think it was the caraway seeds.

The taste of caraway seeds was overpowering and really cancelled out anything else.

I thought the caraway seeds take away from the natural flavor of the soda bread and give it a very bitter taste and after-taste.
