Everyone loved this. The only change I made was to add some smoked paprika and some onion powder in "the mix" and some garlic salt on top... thank you! Super easy and delish!

Simple, straight forward, and crisped up like a champ! I thought these were going to end up over done but they turned out perfect as written. I do think they could have used a little more seasoning but that is an easy fix.

Um, I will NEVER bake chicken thighs any other way ever again! This was the most bangin’ good chicken thighs ever. They tasted fried and all their deliciousness came through! I used salt, pepper and Old Bay Seasoning, which is mainly comprised of paprika, so if you don’t have Old Bay (you should, it’s a cook’s staple!) paprika would be good. But literally whatever seasoning you want because the texture and balance of tender and crispy was delish!! I can’t even believe I’ve been walking the earth all these years baking chicken in a slimy pool in a Pyrex.

My take on this already good recipe was to lightly coat the chicken thighs in olive oil. I also amped up the spies by adding pepper flakes, chili powder, onion salt, garlic powder, and salt/black pepper. That flavor profile really gave the chicken some character. I also had to keep the chicken in an additional 15 minutes on the front end and 15 on the back end to achieve the browning that I got. Would recommend this for a quick and easy meal, but you’ll definitely need to add more seasoning based on your flavor profile.

These came out fantastic! I had boneless, skinless thighs on-hand, so that's what I used.  This cooking method produced a nice crispy outside, almost like the skin was there. Some reviewers (on other recipes) mention they'd take the skin off anyway. I wanted to add a little more flavor then what is listed, so I experimented. On the three thighs I had, I added (both sides): salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder. To one I added a little cayenne, another smoked paprika, and the third some chipotle with garlic seasoning. All came out great!  On the second roasting time at 400F, I checked the meat temp with a thermometer 5 min prior to the time indicated, and they were already done. Thanks for this great recipe!

I didn't have a rack so baked these on a foil lined sheet. They turned out perfectly! Crispy on the outside, and tender and juicy inside. Yum!

I thought these might end up being dry but was pleasantly surprised to find out how tasty these were! Easy too! I didn't have garlic powder so used garlic salt and they were still fine.  I may try adding something else to the seasonings just to experiment but think they are great the way the are too! When I told my husband that they started out at 475, he gasped. I would not have thought to do this and am glad I tried it. Reviews really help!

Okay, so the TECHNIQUE used in this recipe is great and totally works as the skin gets perfectly crispy just as in the photos or even better. 

However, even though I thought the amount of spices was lacking to begin with and added more, it was still super tasteless and boring.

It's a fantastic technique to get crispy skin, but the chicken has no flavour and may possibly be awesome if it was marinated or something (although that may possibly burn with this technique). Maybe a buttermilk marinade?

This chicken is easy to prepare and does not take a lot of time to bake. Served it with mashed potatoes and used the drippings from the chicken to make gravy. A ver delicious, satisfying meal.

All the other comments were spot on - this is a great way to bake chicken that is moist!  The only thing different I will do is start the fans in the kitchen because at such a high temperature and all the fat that comes out of the meat it did create a lot of smoke.  Other than that  add any spices you like it will work fine!

Made exactly as directed (except I removed the skin) and with the addition of a few pats of butter when roasting. Came out very moist and had a beautiful brown and crisp top. Easy and delicious, thanks!

Husband loved it! Made exactly as instructed, except took it out of the oven briefly to brush on some BBQ sauce when they were 10 minutes away from being done.

Tried this tonight ... Let's just say my son said it was the best chicken I've made in 2018. After reading other reviews, I decided to try my own way. Marinated them in Italian dressing over night , then used lemon pepper as my seasoning. Yum--just yum! Great method of cooking checking thighs!

I followed the method, exactly.  And, the chicken is perfect with crispy skin!  I used a multi-purpose seasoning from U.S. Wellness Meats with salt, pepper, garlic, and basil.  The chicken was absolutely wonderful! No mess when foil lines the pan.  I didn't have a rack.

Made this exactly the way it's listed. I too did not have a baking rack. Just used a pan covered in foil and chicken still came out crispy and delicious. No need to add any more spices. The garlic powder, salt and pepper give it just enough flavor. My house smelled amazing as well!

First time leaving a review, but this is sooo good, I had to comment. I made it exactly as instructed even though I had some doubts about the oven temperature. I had eight chicken thighs and left the skin on four of them. They ALL came out great, nice browning and crispness on the outside, tender on the inside. Thank you for this recipe!

I changed it up quite a bit and it was the best baked chicken we have ever had.  Insert a hunk of blue cheese in the thigh, salt/pepper/olive oil drizzle.  Then wrap it with a slice of bacon, sprinkle light brown sugar on top and make sure entire thigh is covered, lower temp to 350 and bake 45 min.  Simply amazing!!

Love it. It’s great as is or spice it up a bit. I lined the baking dish with quartered red potatoes (par boiled for about 5 min), covered with a few onion slices and places the chicken thighs on top. I also spiced both the top of the skin and under it so that the meat gets more flavor.

The first time I followed the spice directions and it was tasty. Every time after I changed things up a bit - drop the garlic, and use paprika; sun dried tomatoes, basil and onion; onion, garlic, paprika and dried bell peppers... there’s no bad combination of spices yet! Next time I’m going to try chili lime. Love how easy this is!

Since we like a little spice in our lives, I added some chipotle to the recipe.  Put the chicken on a rack to bake to let the juices flow away.  Easy, simple recipe that hits the spot.

This is such a simple yet awesome recipe...you have to try it! The only addition I made was to sprinkle paprika on the chicken to ensure it browned the way I wanted. It looks and smells so good I cannot wait until dinnertime...I am going to eat now!

Very nice starter recipe! This version I used Homemade Greek Seasoning, melted a butter stick in the flat pan then coated the thighs placed the chicken on a rack and sprinkled the seasoning! Absolutely Crispy Awesomeness!

Perfect cooking instructions! You can easily play around with the spices when baking. After cooking you could toss them in buffalo wings sauce, or serves a creamy Alfredo sauce over it.

Delicious. Just a couple of small tweaks. Sprayed each piece with Pam, then sprinkled with the spices. Sprinkled the top with Seasoned Salt. My hubby loved it. Will definitely be making this again!

As other reviewers state, the chicken turned out crispy, yet the meat stayed juicy.  Will definitely use this cooking method again when baking chicken thighs.

I make this at least three or four times a month for myself and my husband, and it hasn’t gotten old! The only thing I’ve done differently than the recipe as written is to add onion powder when I season the meat and the skin, and to add smoked paprika to the skin. This recipe makes thighs that are moist, tasty, and super easy - three of my favorite characteristics for a great recipe!

I used crushed garlic because we both love it and it came out tasting great.  I turned it over once to make sure the underside was cooked through.  We both like our chicken well done and this recipe worked beautifully.  It will definitely be on my rotation.

Best baked chicken ever!!!  Yes, go ahead and use whatever seasonings you want, open your windows to prevent the smoke alarm from going off but by all means, use this technique! Lift the skin, put up the temp on your oven, skip the added fat, and enjoy this flavorful, crispy goodness.

Turned out good. Definitely needs more spice. The high heat created a lot of splatter in the oven and made my kitchen really Smokey. Not sure I will make this again, but it was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.

Holy Cow!!  Brilliant technique to get perfectly crispy, yet juicy chicken thighs.  You can season with any type of herb or spice that you prefer, making sure you follow the direction to season under the skin too.  Just use your exhaust fan or even open a window for a few minutes if needed.  This recipe/technique is absolutely divine!

Easy to mix up the spices anyway you like it and have it come out nice and juicy. I use a broiler pan instead of a rack and it come out great every time.

I am trying to figured out why my chicken came out dry. Maybe being on a rack? Perhaps oven temp was too high or baking time too long. Spices were good.

Simply amazing. I use Old Bay Seasoning/garlic powder as the rub inside and out. This is the most simple, flavorful recipe that keeps the skin crisp and meat tender/ juicy. Perfect for Keto.

Let me just say that I'm not a cook.  My husband usually cooks in our house but once in a while I'll make something too lol. I made this and it's truly a crowd pleaser! Easy and delicious! Just as others stated in their reviews.  Open a window or two cuz you'll have some smokiness but it's well worth it! I vary the ingredients as well sometimes adding paprika or something,  but it is great following the recipe directions as well! Yummy! Thank you!

Delicious. A tad salty, but that can be fixed on future uses...and I will be making this again.  My oven is pretty true, and this was done about ten minutes before the recipe states, so check at ten minutes early.  Thanks.

This truly is as easy and as good as all have said.  It does produce a lot of smoke so keep your fan on high.  I have made it a number of times and then kept leftovers for the week.  Chicken is tender inside and crisp on the outside. I wouldn’t change a thing

This was amazing.  Can't believe how great it was with only those simple spices.  I used chicken breasts (bone-in, skin on) because I accidentally thawed the wrong type of chicken.  It was still great - and juicy which in my opinion, chicken rarely is. Also, to make it a little easier, I combined the seasonings into a bowl and applied like a rub rather than try to sprinkle it on.  I forgot to apply to the underside of the chicken and it was still great!

I made this following the recipe exactly the skin was wonderfully crispy.  Only change I will make in the future will be to add more seasoning.  Other than that it was great!!  Will definitely make again.

You can use any part of the chicken with this recipe. I have made it several times and each time was great! I used different spices like, kosher salt, Italian Season, garlic rub, ancho chili powder, lemon pepper season. It’s a hit!!

These were really good and so simple.  I added a little onion powder and seasoning salt, but I feel confident that it would have been fine just as written.  My husband and daughter really liked them.

A very delicious method.  Turn on the fan, you will have some smoke!  Next time I'll follow this recipe exactly but this time I needed to use up about 8 pounds of bone in skin on thighs and had some leftover rub I accidentally made too hot for a different cut of meat.  For these thighs it was perfect, almost like a jerk.  They smell like something offered at a state fair, fatty (in a good way) and spicy and tantalizing.

This is the best! I added smoked paprika to the salt and pepper. Garlic powder too. My oven runs a tad high so I baked at 425 for 15 min then turned it down to 350 for 40 min. Perfect.

I made this with boneless skinless thighs.  My family said it was the best chicken i ever made.  They are now obsessed.  Ive made it twice this week adding the chicken to quesadillas  for leftoveres.  The chicken stays so moist.

Turned out great. I used Pit Boss Chop House Steak Rub, instead of salt, pepper and garlic.

A staple in my house.  The best way to make chicken!  Easy and tasty.  I play around a little with the spices - sometimes rosemary, sometimes oregano or smoked paprika.

This was fast and easy, and it was very good. I did use skinless thighs and added  some onion powder. They came out with the outside  crispy and the thighs juicy.

These came out crispy and very good. I also added some smoked paprika. The only thing I didn't like was that with cooking at such a high temp it splattered all over my oven. Otherwise they were yummy.

Quick and easy way to make crispy fried chicken.  I used my own bbq rub which included salt, pepper and garlic powder along with a few other spices.  I also lined the sheet pan with foil for easy clean up.

This is a great go to chicken dish. Really simple and comes out nice and crispy. I like to add some extra spices for added flavor though. With some rosemary, thyme, sage, and paprika, it comes out even better.

This turned out really well. My small changes were that I lifted the skin, added salt and pepper and a pat of cold butter. Then I covered each thigh in FunniBonz Original rub. I followed the baking directions exactly. I thought I made too many and there are none left. The skin came out crispy and the chicken was super-juicy. Cooking it on the rack helped with the crispness and also prevented it from sitting in its own oil. This is definitely a keeper!

YUM!  I cooked as directed and they turned out great!  I only had 4 thighs and the recipe still applies.  It does get a bit smokey (I have an electric stove, I put the stove exhaust fan in an it helped, just letting you know in advance).  The thighs turned out crispy and tender!  I’ll cook thighs like this again!

WOW!  Not only was this recipe super easy, but it was SUPER good.  Lots of flavor and that crispiness of the skin was just perfect.  My husband loved it.  He said if I made chicken like this more often, he wouldn't find the need to eat fried chicken again.  So I guess you can say that this recipe is equivalent to fried chicken only healthier.

The only change that I made was to use boneless, skinless chicken thighs.  I adjusted cooking time (added a couple of minutes - our propane oven cooks fast) but otherwise followed recipe as written.  DEELISH!  Will definitely make this again - a low cost main dish for sure.

This is an easy meal when you have a hand full with kiddos. It only takes 5 minutes for the preparation and the rest let the oven do the work for you. My husband loved it.

I Love this way to prepare chicken thighs. They taste great! The thighs come out tender inside and the skin is crispy. I didn't change anything with this recipe. I used the leftovers to make chicken salad sandwiches and they were fantastic!

These were amazing. I didn't have  garlic so used fresh garlic instead. They were simply scrumptious!

The cooking method is the key!  Follow it exactly, and you won’t be disappointed.  Made this several times and it was delicious.  I’ve tried a couple of options.  On the grill on indirect heat for the same time made it less messy on the oven and imparted other flavors.  Also experimented on the seasonings and liked McCormick’s Montreal Chicken.  Just options to a great recipe!

Used skinless thighs.  Would never have thought so few seasonings would make it taste so good.

Easy and tasty. Did it 3 times now. I throw potatoes wrapped in foil in while oven heating up so all are ready at same time.

Followed recipe exactly, but didn’t have potato’s , or sadly lemons. Used ‘real lemon’ and still turned out great. Everyone whining about to much oil, obviously has not had authentic Greek cooking.

Very easy prep! Followed the recipe and added onion powder. As some of the other reviewers I was also afraid that they would overdone. Not at all. Will use this recipe again.

This was an amazingly flavourful chicken main!  I made it exactly as written and it was delicious, my 5 year old grandson took down two thighs and loved it!
