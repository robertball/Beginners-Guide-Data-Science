I don't typically review recipes that I've altered from the printed, but since this one has no reviews, I'll do it anyway :)

This turned out really good for vegan, gf gingerbread.  I changed the flour combo as I don't keep amaranth around.  So I used a combo of sorgum, buckwheat, brown rice, potato starch and coconut flour.  I subbed the agave syrup for honey straight across.  

Not sure why the baking soda was in such a high measurement and wonder if it would have been better to decrease this and add some baking powder, but it did rise a little (mostly around the outside edges).  

Very happy to have stumbled upon this recipe as I have wanted gingerbread for a couple years now :)  I will definitely make it again, but probably keep the buckwheat measurements the same in my next batch.  I am guessing it adds a bit to the overall product.  

It tastes best cooled completely in my opinion.

What a lovely cake. I had to make some flour substitutions: a homemade brown rice and sorghum blend instead of amaranth, then chestnut flour instead of coconut flour, each in equal parts. The consistency was perfect, dense and moist holding up to being handled. I even made gingerbread men cutouts and they stood up to all the work. I used flax seeds instead of eggs as written and couldn't tell any difference from a cake made with egg. The flavour is not to be beat. It has a zing to it that grabs you and says make a tea now. However, the overall taste is mellow and screams Autumn. I agree with the other reviewer that a glaze on top would be nice. All-in-all a keeper recipe for anyone, vegan or not, celiac or not. It's simply a wonderful cake, don't pass it up.

i substituted teff flour for the amaranth, & a mix of brown rice syrup & maple syrup for the sweeteners. so fluffy & delicious!! i made a lemon vanilla cashew cream to go on top, which added a nice texture with the cake.

for anyone in search of a great gluten free/vegan cake *base* recipe (to alter into other kind of cakes!)--this gingerbread recipe is the one. i recently converted/subbed a few ingredients to make a perfect chocolate cake...just as fluffy and delicious as the gingerbread here. 

such a great recipe, thank you!

I added a lot more ginger, and used eggs.  I also made a glaze to go over the top with candied ginger pieces.  It's dense and moist, and got compliments from the non-gluten-free people, too.  Most of the rising happens when you add the boiling water.  I struck it into a smaller pan so it would be deeper, and it still baked for the same time.

Couldn't find amaranth flour so used a GF mix.   I thought this was delicious and so did others.   Satisfied my gingerbread craving.   Topped it with dairy-free coconut whipped topping.   Delicious.

My husband and I are on a Candida diet and we needed something substantial to eat, so I made this and it turned out great!  I did change it somewhat.  I used Stevia instead of the agave and changed the 'flour' combination to a mixture of sorghum flour, almond flour and coconut flour along with the buckwheat flour, I also used eggs instead of the flax. The molasses has sugar in it, but it's still better than most desserts for less yeast growth.
