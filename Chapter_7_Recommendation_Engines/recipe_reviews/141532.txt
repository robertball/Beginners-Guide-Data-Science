I followed the recipe as close as I could with what I had on hand. Instead of wheat germ I used wheat bran, which is naturally 'sweet'. Since my Labrador needs no additional reason to be happy I also left out the honey. Out of the 2 dog biscuit recipes I have he prefers this one, it's more peanutty. (I know I tried a bite). It only made 14 biscuits with a medium-size round biscuit cutter, so next time I will at least double the recipe. As for the cook - don't be stingy with the flour when rolling it out. thank you!

I made this recipe on Sunday and to my surprise my dogs love them!  I did not follow recipe as what prompted me to make them is that I was out of the dogs regular "cookies" and didn't want to run to the store.  I used flaxseed meal (had on hand) instead of wheat germ assuming it has the same healthful benefits for dogs as it does for peops.  I took the suggestion from another reviewer and pressed the cookies with a fork rather than rolling and cutting them out.  I also doubled the recipe.  (Our dogs get rewarded alot!)  Dough a bit sticky and would have required additional flour for rolling/cutting.  Otherwise, fantastic recipe!  I love knowing what's really gowing in my dogs tummies!  I plan to wean my pups from the other .

These are 100% Patterdale Terrier approved! My dog went crazy for these treats. I did make a few minor alterations... upped the peanut butter to 1/2 a cup, added an extra 1/2 cup of flour. I substituted 1/2 cup of crushed Wheaties cereal for the wheat germ because that's all I had on hand, and used just a TINY bit of honey (because the Wheaties have sugar in them). I used 2 bananas and it was just perfect. Thank you!!!

I really didn't want to roll out the dough, so I just rolled into balls and flattened with a fork.  They baked just fine as directed.  At first, my dog wouldn't take the treats, so I was a bit worried.  I tried again, and he ate several.  Don't know what was wrong with him before.  Anyway, easy and quick.  I used 1 banana and it seemed like it was about 1/2 cup.

My beagle loves these treats and he's a picky little eater. I added a little bit of oatmeal to the recipe so it would be a little less sticky and good for him too! They take a bit longer to cook (about 3 minutes longer). I added extra peanut butter and 2 bananas. I did add some honey but on a teaspoon because my dog is spoiled enough! haha. Best dog treat recipe i've made. (: Thanks for the recipe!

If I had a dog I assume he/she would like them. They are a pretty healthy snack so I actually made them for myself! Clearly they're a bit dry but not too shabby when dunked in coffee or tea. I found it fun, in a gross way, to roll the dough into a narrow rod shape and stack them into little "piles".

My two dogs absolutely love these...I didn't have any wheat germ on hand, so as one reviewer had done, I used oatmeal instead. Took the time to roll out the dough and used cute little gingerman cookie cutters. I have decided I will be giving these out to all the dog lovers I know this Christmas!

The picture that accompanies this recipe is deceiving and it may be carob coating, which is OK, but NEVER EVER dip your dog cookies in chocolate.  Chocolate is very toxic to dogs.

Like most, I didn't have all the ingredients. This is how I altered with what I had: To replace honey, I used 1 T of sugar-free strawberry jam. To replace wheat germ, I used 1/2 c. of rolled oats. As another person said, I refrigerated the dough for about an hour and it made ALL the difference in handing. It was no longer a sticky mess! I used additional wholewheat flour to roll out to 1/4" thickness. I cut cookies approx 1" rounds and then poked a whole in the middle so they would bake evenly. Just keep gathering unused dough and reroll. It made 56 cookies (6rows of 9).  You can bake them close together but not touching because they actually shrink while baking.  I also baked them longer to be sure they were crunchy, about 1 hour total. I turned off oven and let them remain in hot oven until I remember them again, which was about 5 hrs later. My dogs LOVE these!!! I've tried other recipes and my dogs didn't really like them, but would eat them. This will be my one and only go-to recipe when I want to impress others ;) The egg whites made the difference between bland looking and yummy looking with the shiny tops. Mine end up about 23 calories each!

4 dogs I know can't wait for these to come out of the oven!  Okay, so I'm lazy and didn't bother to make them into doggie shapes, but the dogs didn't seem to mind!  Healthy for the animals...easy easy easy to stir up and bake.

My pups love love love these! I use oatmeal in place of the wheat germ and add either shredded carrots or apples, whichever is laying around the house. As a poor graduate student, I also figured out the price comparison for these and the cheapest dog biscuits at the stores, and these are even lower than that! Who wouldn't love homemade biscuits over processed ?!

Ok so a little weird I am making this right now. I gave my dogs a little piece of dough to see if they would like them and now they are in there watching the oven! So that's amazing in my book.

Super easy, and my dogs love them! I used oatmeal in place of the wheat germ, and chose to just roll pieces of dough into little balls instead of rolling and cutting. The recipe made about 200 tiny treats, and they are great for training! Refrigeration (1hr) really helped with dough handling.

Absolutely fantastic!  I followed the recipe exactly   (cracks me up when people need to change everything and post to the point where it is a new recipe). My dogs and the neighbor's dog loved them.  I plan on making them for Christmas gifts this year.  Thanks for a great recipe:)

Easy to make, good consistency.  I just use a pizza cutter and make small squares in order to keep portion sizes appropriate.    I made 2 double batches so I could freeze them.  For my second double batch I didn't have enough bananas so I used 1 banana, 1 shredded apple and replaced 1 cup of flour with 1 cup of oatmeal.  The taste was much better.   I'd like to experiment with less wheat germ.  That's the main flavor in the original recipe.

Westie approved! I wanted to beef things up even more, so I added 1/4 cup whey powder, added 2 more Tb peanut butter, and replaced half the wheat germ with rolled oats. Omitted the honey, as the whey powder was non-calorically sweetened. Rolled into 1" balls and flattened onto the sheet. It made exactly 35 this way. My dog went NUTS!! She sat her butt down next to the oven and wouldn't move until I gave her a couple, and I finally had to shoo her out of the way. It's great to know that all the ingredients are good for her, and they contain no preservatives, which means BTW that they'll have to be stored in the fridge so as not to get moldy. Thank you for the recipe, a sure-fire way to make your favorite canine very, very happy.

I make this recipe on a pretty regular basis since I found it here! I replace the wheat germ with oats since I almost always have oats on hand. Our Schnauzer LOVES them. I dog sat over the holidays for two other dogs and they begged for them, too. I cut them out in the shape of cats because I have a twisted sense of humor. If you use your stand mixer, these are pretty fast to make up. This is a hit!

I've made this several times now, with a few variations:  Because of the different types of peanut butter I've used, I have had to adjust the flour.  Just keep adding until you get to the rolling consistancy that you need.  I substituted canned pumpkin for the banana because I've heard it is excellent for dogs.  I didn't use the entire can, obviously, so I put the rest in baggies and froze for later recipes.  I've put in leftover rice and quinoa, I've used a dab of oatmeal, I've grated up carrots.. As you can tell, I've monkeyed around with it quite a bit and my dogs still love me anyway.

I've made these several times and have yet to meet a dog that does not love them.  They have all preferred the rolled and cut out version over the one batch I made "thumbprint" shape.

These are great and my dog loves them!  They are super easy to make as well.  I put the dough in the fridge for a little bit before I roll the dough and I also use flour to coat the rolling pin.  I also add an egg white wash as someone else recommended to give them a shiny coat.

My picky dog sat in front of the stove until they were done and when the timer went off he barked until I gave him one. Needless to say my dog loved absolutely loved these biscuits. I make them for him every Christmas and I give them to other dog owners as gifts from my canine companion.

Nice easy treats. I tripled the recipe. The second time I made these for Holiday gifts I found that rolling the dough into a long rope shape allowed an easy way to make and cut to size especially for small dogs. Cooking time is definitely longer.

so flexible! I used 3 bananas I had frozen and then thawed, so I just kept adding a little more flour and some flax meal (per other suggestions) to better the consistency. The dogs devoured them. My two year old son helped - this is a great recipe for kids, and I didn't need to panic when he swiped a baked one to try along with the dog.

my dog loved them.  I also gave them as gifts to a couple friends.  The only thing I substituted was oatmeal instead of wheat germ.  warning:  when they are baking they smell like people cookies. :)

These were a hit with our yellow lab -- and with my kids (almost 5 and 8). They've eaten almost as many as the dog's eaten!  As recommended by previous posters, I substituted oatmeal for the wheat germ (didn't have any) and rolled the dough into balls and flattened with a fork instead of rollling/cutting (easier for DD to help with). They came out looking like tiny peanut-butter cookies.

My dogs love this recipe. I added extra peanut butter and 1/4 cup rice flour. Since I have small dogs I used a small 1" cookie cutter. Yielded 125 cookies.  I left them in the oven overnight so they would dry completely. Cookies also freeze well.

I'm rating this right now on the simplicity of the recipe.  These were so easy to make and I made about 16 decent sized heart shape dog treats.  I don't have dogs but I have a god dog and a dog neice so I made these for them.  I made them last night (in no time, flat!) and both dogs will get to try them today!  My fiance looked in the fridge (I stored them there only because I don't have dogs I'm thinking they will keep better in there for the few times per week we will get to give these to them) and he was ready to eat one!  He thought they looked delicious!!  (I should have let him!)  I hope the dogs are as excited as I am!  Given that they like them (which I hope they do because they are really easy to make) I know what they will get for christmas this year!!!!  Thanks for the super simple recipe!

My dog Sorcha (Husky/German Shepherd mix) loves these. I made them with molasses instead of honey because that is what I had on hand and 1/2 cup rolled oats instead of the wheat germ (also what I had on hand). I also threw in 2 tbsp. milled flax seeds. Definitely a keeper and I will also share with friends that have dogs this Christmas.

I have made these twice now and both times I find they don't keep more than a week.  I have a little dog- at one point I saw fuzz growing on them before I gave it to her thankfully.  She likes the flavor, just be prepared to share the batch.  Also does not keep well as batter.

My dogs, too, loved these. However, one is a Lab--she would be content eating almost anything. The pickier of the two, my Dane, was more the deciding factor. He said, "Yep, those are pretty yummy!" The only reason I rated this 4 stars is because I'm not sure they ever really reached the "crunch factor" that I was hoping for. Favorwise, though, they were a hit!
***Revision! I really liked working with the dough after I had frozen then thawed it. Wasn't as sticky. I also just baked the second batch longer and got a better crunch out of them. The dogs told me change my rating to 5 stars!

My doggies liked these. I used oatmeal instead of wheat germ since I had that on hand. I just rolled into balls and flattened with a fork, no time to roll out and cut out. My mini schnauzer (aka vacuum) and my picky mutt gobble them right up.

These are awesome, I made them last night!(pictures to follow...if there are any biscuits left when I get home. My husband thought they were cookies for him :)) Extremely easy to prepare because I had all the ingredients in my pantry already. Also I used my food processor as another reviewer had suggested; keeping the mess to a minimum. Thank you Sandra for a quick and easy recipe!

These are so easy to make & my dog loved them.  They only had green bananas at the grocery store so I used 1 jar of baby food bananas as a substitute and they came out just fine.  I also used crunchy peanut butter.   I didn't roll and cut them, just rolled up little balls, then squished them with my thumb.

I make these using oats instead of wheat germ and agave nectar instead of honey.  I also crush up about 7 dog multivitamins as they are huge and my pug wont eat them any other way.  She stands by the oven and waits for them to come out.  She says they are "fantastic".

I just made these for our new 5 month old puppy, he LOVES them!  And I feel great giving him something healthy without all the  they put in the stuff in the stores... I followed the recipe exactly, thank you!  Will make these again and again...I used a circle cookie cutter, but these went over so well I think I'll have to invest in a cute little bone shape cutter =)

My lab/pointer and boston/jack russell realllly liked these!  I made the recipe as is, except I added less honey (seemed like it didn't need a whole TBSP) and I added an extra egg yolk because I like to use things up.  I think I rolled the cookies out too thin, because I made more than 60 cutouts with this recipe!  I even let the dogs eat a bit of the leftover dough.... I can't tell which the liked better, the dough or the cookies!  I'm going to use these cookies as a treat for my dog's birthday party.  Thanks so much for sharing!

Great recipe. This recipe is very healthy (compared to the ones sold in stores). I used almond butter instead of peanut butter, whole wheat pastry flour instead of reg. whole wheat, and 1/2 flax seed powder instead of wheat germ, all of these ingredients I had on hand. I took a reviewer's advice for just rolling them in balls and flattening them out with a fork, it made them look very rustic (which I love!). Next time I might add flax seeds and maybe some more almond butter.

My dogs LOVE peanut butter so decided to give this recipe a try.  I followed it as written - used one banana which is about a half cup & did not think the dough was too sticky to roll out.  Also, I just baked them for 30 minutes.  They are more like cookies that way than crunchy dog biscuits.  Dogs seemed to like them.  They do smell like people cookies while baking.

I like this recipe because while it is labelled "peanut butter banana dog treats" it has the ability for substitution. For example, I used oatmeal instead of wheat germ but followed the rest of the recipe the first time I made them. The second time I subbed bacon and sausage for the banana and applesauce for the honey. The dogs loved it even more the second time around!! They were a bit sticky so I made regular cookies and didn't bother rolling them out. I also left them in the turned off oven over night to harden.

You are not going to believe this but I made these treats MINUS the banana and I substituted the Germ for plain ROLLED OATS and my dog chose these over Gravy Train jerky strips and steak bones every time. I held one of these in 1 hand & a Gravy Train treat in the other & my basenji dog always chose these. I did NOT roll these out. Instead I made them like spoon cookies and dipped my finger in egg wash & pushed them down. You can make them as big or small as you like. Place them close together because they don't rise much or spread. Cook them until they start turning brown. The batter was too thick so I added water until it was like cookie dough. This changed the treat from being crunchy like a dog biscuit to a hard & chewy treat. Like others said, double the recipe!

Like others, I did not have any wheat germ on hand, so substituted oatmeal. I just rolled them out into little balls and used a fork to mash 'em down like others have done as well. My dogs love them (I'll need to make much bigger batches as they are BIG dogs), and they even taste pretty good to the hoomans!

A Keeper!!  My dog is really sensitive to foods, but absolutely loved these and they settled with him well.  Only problem is that he wanted those instead of his food (he only gets one per day).  Very easy to make and he loves them so I am happy.

My six month old Pom had 7 teeth removed and I wanted to make her cookies that she can chew.  These turned out just perfect and my lil Pom now will not take any other (training) treats!!  She has demanded that I make these a regular! ;)  Great recipe, I didn't add honey as I believe the batter is sweet enough and used whole wheat flour. Besides that, a very easy baking session for that four legged loved one.  Thanks for sharing!

My Dog loves these (though to be honest, she isn't too tough to please)! I simplified things by using only whole wheat flour (without wheat germ). I also doubled the recipe, so I have a good supply now.  I actually had some fun making little shapes and designs out of the dough, as well.  This would be a super easy, fun project for kids (or adults, apparently) to do!   :)

My dog loved these! I baked a whole bunch for christmas gifts to our four legged friends. The whole time I was baking my dog was underfoot. She has allergies and did not react to these at all!

My dog loves these, and I have to admit they don't taste bad either!  Very easy to make and with the exception of the wheat germ I always have everything on hand.  Since I don't stock wheat germ I followed others advice and use oatmeal they it come out fine.  I cut them with a very small cookie cutter and was able to get about 80 treats.  Nothing is mentioned about what the shelf life is so I keep them in the refrigerator.  2/12/12:  Made these again and used wheat germ.  I used a medium sized heart cookie cutter and got 24 treats.  My dog loves them!

Dog's love 'em!! Eat them right up!  If you want them crispier - try putting them in a dehydrator - it also increases the shelf life.  Only thing is that using a dehydrator makes them crispy enough for bigger dogs - but too crispy for small ones. Also - if you are using cookie cutters - the smaller the better.  The smallest one I had was still too big for little doggies.  Plan on making these again!

This recipe is an absolute winner! Easy to make and my dog absolutely loves them. I doubled the recipe in order to get enough for a decent supply (freezing half of them) and replaced wheatgerm with oatmeal as mentioned by others. My measurements of peanut butter, honey and banana are hit-and-miss but no matter what I do, they turn out great!

Our weim was given one of these that we made.  Her eyes bugged out of her head and she leaped six feet in the air to get the second one.  A more sensible solution was to break it up and put in in a Kong.  Pure bliss for over an hour.  Short version:  This recipe is truly five stars as rated by Mia the Weimaraner.

Very easy. I did not have wheat germ on hand so I substituted oats, dog loves them! We made these using a bone cookie cutter for Christmas gifts to our other dog lovers. They were a hit with all the dogs no matter what size or breed.

These were actually fairly easy to make. My dog, Cocker Spaniel named Munster, enjoyed these. These treats came out semi- crumbly though. I made 2 batches, one with wheat germ and the other with ground flax seed and crumbled up shredded wheat. It was hard to tell which one my dog really liked (he loved food period!) I also used 1/2 cup of peanut butter as other reviewers suggested. And I also cut these dog treats into bones.

I tried this recipe for my 3 dogs and they absolutely loved them. I added oatmeal to make it less sticky and rolled and cut them out on a piece of parchment paper, put them on a baking sheet and baked them in the oven. I turned them over so that they browned evenly on both side. Will definitely be a repeat recipe.

These came out great, the dogs love them. Really easy, too, I just mixed everything in the Kitchenaid and let it knead the dough. I did have to add a bit more flour (maybe 1/4 cup) before I could roll it out and cut it. I will be making these again.

Our two greyhounds have discovered that dog treat taste-testers is a fitting occupation after retiring from their racing careers. They just loved these treats. Mummy made them mostly as written, except she replaced the wheat germ with bran, because that's what she had. She doubled the recipe and they filled two cookie sheets. You can bake them close together because they don't spread. The dough is very easy to handle. Eight paws up!
**UPDATE - check the ingredients in your peanut butter. If it has xylitol, don't use it for dog treats! Xylitol is very toxic to dogs.

Recipe is definitely 5 stars. I made them per the recipe. Our dog and every one else's dog in the neighborhood loves them. I give them away with a copy of the recipe. As far as I know, none of these lazy dog owners have made them for their dog?? I checked with our vet before I made the first batch. He gave them a thumbs up. These have to be better than the commercial treats you buy. Our dog has had nothing but these for the last six months and still lovers them. I know these have to be better than anything made in CHINA. Refrigerate the dough for 30 minutes and then roll them out. Cut with a knife into small squares if you don't want to fuss. Thank you for for a wonderful recipe.

Finally me and the boys made some cookies.  The boys have a few allergies so we changed the recipe a bit.  Instead of wheat flour we used rice flour (no gluten). Instead of wheat germ we used ground flax seed. They loved!!!

Girls love these, I used oatmeal instead of flour and graham crumbs( time to clean out the cupboards).  As we use these for training treats rather than use a cookie cutter I roll the dough out on parchment paper and cut it into half inch squares using a pizza cutter, place on a cookie sheet and you are done, fast and easy

I have made this recipe numerous times. This is my Chihuahua's favorite cookie by far.  With my 2" bone shaped cookie cutter I get 70 cookies when rolled out to 1/4 in thick. I have also used whole oats in place of the wheat germ. Every dog I have given this cookie to they have asked for more. I also use local raw honey. If the dough is a little sticky when rolling out, just add a little more wheat flour until the stickiness is gone. To preserve the freshness, I refridgerate in an air tight container. This is a very healthy treat and 100% USA made.

Dog approved (and a rather picky one at that)!  Didn't have wheat germ, so used half ground flax/half ground oats.  Subbed 1/2C ground oats for some of the wheat flour.  Added enough extra flour while handling/rolling so that it wasn't really sticky anymore. Didn't bother with the egg white.  Baked for 30 minutes, then turned off the heat and let partially cool in the oven, which left 1.5" rounds the consistency of a very dry cookie, but not hard or crunchy.  This recipe almost filled a standard cookie sheet.  Smelled great, a little bland/dry for my taste buds (yes, I tried a bite), but could taste the p.butter and banana.

Wonderful Treats! I didn't have wheat germ so I substituted rolled oats. Also- didn't use the egg wash because I like my treats looking rustic. These are not a crunchy biscuit- slightly on the soft side with some crunch. I will make these again and they smell wonderful and the dogs love them!

My very picky little dog loved these!  I didn't have banana so I used a 4ounce jar of chicken&rice baby food, and I used oats instead of wheat germ and skipped the egg white wash. Also rolled into balls and pressed with fork.  Great!

my grrls will not eat any other dog treat now. Only home made.. and I have these little P.B banana gems to blame for it. I make a double batch and they last a week.. ( hey, they are big dogs.. lol)  when I double it, I use two whole medium bananas and a decent spoon of honey.. and nutri-blend flour instead of WW flour.. I roll them out quite thin because they like them crunchy. BIG hit in this house and I an eternally thankful that I found this recipe.. my girls have food sensitivities and these treats do not bother them. Thanks for sharing! :)

Doubled the recipe mainly because I had extra banana. Otherwise followed the recipe as given but I like other reviewers suggestions & I will likely try a few of these options. My dog loves them (and I get rid of over-ripe bananas as my family gets weary of banana bread.)

My Pups and I love this recipe. I double the recipe and still have to make it more than once a week. I just use a plastic lettuce knife and cut into cubes. I have 4 pups and they all love them.

Easy ingredients I had on hand (except wheat germ - substituted oatmeal). The dough rolled out perfectly and they cooked up nicely. Our dogs stole a few off the counter when cooling so it's fair to say they are a hit!

I just made these today.  My four month old Vizsla LOVES them!  Granted, he loves just about anything food related, but these brought on much tail wagging/butt wiggling, and instant sitting and focus on me.  I have a feeling training just got easier!


My 13 year old picky Chihuahua/Pom wanted nothing to do with them.

Like others, I also added mint.  Will take the advice of other reviewers and add some garlic and chicken bouillon next time.  This was my first time making my own treats - SUPER EASY!!
**UPGRADE** The old lady just needed smaller pieces!  She finally learned to "sit," using these!  FIVE STARS!!!

I just made these for my stubbornly untrainable chihuahua Guinness today, and he learned to roll over and shake paw all in one day!  I have his undivided attention with this cookie in hand and only feed him a very small morsel off of one cookie per command.  So easy to make...thanks!

Just got done making these, and my pug, Buster, LOVES them! (He also really liked licking the bowls during the mixing process) I loved this recipe, because I had (just about) everything on hand already. (The only thing I didn't have was Wheat Germ, so I swapped it out with oatmeal.) I cut them in little Noah's Ark shapes, so they kinda looked like cute little animal crackers. (Although, I'm sure he could have cared less about the shapes.) Thanks for sharing Sandra! :)

- Flour generously when you're rolling out the dough.
- I'll generally roll it out to about a 0.25" sheet and then take a pizza slicer to it and cut it into small pieces for training rewards or stick them in treat balls to keep the dogs entertained for awhile.

I have tried a lot of different recipes. My dogs love these cookies. I used rolled oats instead of wheat germ, but they love them. As soon as I start to make them they come running and sit by the oven until their done.

I made these today for my dog's 2nd Birthday treat and she absolutely loved them! Instead of rolling them out, I rolled them into balls and then flattened with a fork (traditional peanut butter cookie print)! So easy to make...thank you for sharing! :-)

I just wanted to thank you Sandra. My puppy loves just about any treat there is, but this is the first time I have ever seen her try to leap up onto the counter for them. She walked in circles around my kitchen island the entire time I was making them and sat in front of the oven during baking. Any time anyone goes near the kitchen she chases them and sits right in front of the fridge and cries til she gets ones. Thank you so much for a great recipe.

Easy to make and the dogs love it.  I used oatmeal instead of wheat germ as others have suggested.  It worked out great.  I also put the batter in the refrig and found it easier to handle.  I baked small shape cookies for 25 mins. which was a little soft and not crunchy.  I will try to bake it longer next time.  The egg white shine made the cookie look nicer.

I had an off-brand 12 oz. jar of PB  and 3 ripe bananas that no one here would eat,so I used all of that, 1 cup of oatmeal, a dash of honey, and the extra yolk.  I 'tested' on my dog, Mojo, and he had 2 right away; took one for each of my friend's dogs, and needless to say, what a hit.  And, healthy too!!!!  (Mojo smelled the PB so he finished up what was left on the spoon!!!!)

The boys give these 2 paws up!  They had a hard time waiting til they cooled so they could sample them.  Their patience paid off though, as they quickly devoured their samples.  I'm glad I doubled the recipe since they went over so well with my taste-testers.  Thanks for the recipe!

Quite an easy recipe, but not a brilliant succcess with my dog (which surprised me, he's a greedy beast most of the time). I gave him one and he ate it but kind of looked at me like "have you got something better?" Later that evening we had some tummy issues, so I don't think I'll give him any more of these. We were going to give these to our doggie friends for Christmas presents, but maybe I'll try an alternate recipe.

Ok look, HERE’s the way you do it... Double the recipe. Take a large baking pan from your restaurant supply store (sheet pan), throw a Silpat down on it, then dump the dough onto that. Use a rolling pin to smooth it out. My rolling pin and the sides of the pan work perfectly for keeping the dough uniform in depth. Cut the dough with a pizza cutter (roller), slather on the egg wash, and bake. This is SO much easier! :-)

I made these for a pet rescue fundraiser so I multiplied the recipe by 10! I wanted at least 100 cookies, but ended up with 73. 

After making all that dough, I dreaded the thought of rolling it out, even though I had bought a personalized cookie cutter. So, I used a cookie scoop to measure the dough, rolled it in a ball and then used my cookie cutter to press the image into the bal. They turned out great! They are a bit big, but I still think the 30 minute bake time was fine. They are chewy, not crunchy. The important thing was that our two Dobermans liked them. I was so glad they did after all that- lol! I can see myself making this on a much smaller basis in the future. The only substitute I made was to use oatmeal instead of wheat germ. And, I think the egg wash does help to make them prettier. I will now try to post a picture :-)

We have 3 dogs plus do rescue and foster, these barely had time to cool before I had pups at my heels with noses in the air.  A few of ours have GI issues so I skipped the wheat germ/wheat flour and used garbanzo bean flour and white rice flour and cooked at 350.  I like my dogs to have crunchy bits to clean their teeth better so left them in the over after turning the heat off...  Make sure they are completely dry before storing them as they can mold with any moisture left in them.

These are amazing and my dogs love them, I substituted wheat flour for coconut flour, completely left out the wheat germ, and used 1/4 of a cup of applesauce. Baked for 25 mins and they turn out perfect !

I must have made this recipe a dozen times by now.  I never have wheat germ on hand so I use oatmeal instead.  The dog hasn't complained.  I also don't bother to cut out cute shapes-- I just make a flattened ball of about a Tbs of dough.  Dog hasn't complained about that either.  I love knowing I'm feeding her good food!

I rarely write a review, though this time it's a MUST! I've never seen the dogs waiting with such baited breath while mixing up a recipe... it's as if they KNEW these cookies were for them!! One even robbed a few off the pan while on the counter, waiting to go in the oven. This has NEVER happened... even with "human" food!! ;) Needless to say, ummm.... they LOVED the cookies. I have a feeling we won't be able to keep up with demand on this one... ha!! Substituted rolled oats for wheat germ, since that was what was on hand, and added a few sprinkles of dried parsley (for the breath... hello. ;). Sprinkled with a good amount of all-purpose flour to make manageable for handling the sticky dough, dropped with a spoon and spatula onto the pan to keep it simple. We humans even had a taste when it was all said and done, and wellll
... not bad. LOL

I used oatmeal instead of the wheat germ because I had plenty on hand. Otherwise, I didn't change the ingredients. My daughter helped me, and the dog gives his stamp of approval.

I have just read all the wonderful remarks for this recipe and will be making them, just one remark concerns me by adding sugar free jam. There are sugar substitutes out there that are toxic to dogs, make sure your sugar substitute is not xylitol.

Coveted by my bloodhound/lab cross...2 paws way up! I doubled the recipe, using oatmeal in place of wheat germ, and adding a tbsp of melted coconut oil instead of a second tbsp of honey. I but out the biscuits with a pastry wheel and marked the tops with a fork.  The baking instructions were excellent...a definite make-again.

My dog Stella LOVES these treats!  I didn't have an egg or banana on hand, so I substituted with 1/4 cup of oil.  I did find that it needed extra flour though.  I didn't measure the extra, I just added until it looked more like dough.  I can't wait to try again when I do have all the right ingredients!

My dogs devoured these so fast I wasn't sure they even had time to taste them! I made a huge batch and gave some away to friends with fur babies...and all of them reported that these were very well received by their pups too! Definitely a keeper! The only thing I changed was the addition of a pinch of ground flax seed.

This dough was surprisingly easy to work with right out of the bowl! I sub'd the honey with one T of Sugar free Blackberry jam (Smuckers),& rolled oats for the wheat germ. I then refrigerated it overnight, & it didn't stick at all! I rolled it right on my silicone cutting board with a silicone roller. I cut some with mini cookie cutters & some I just shaped into rounds with my hands. Never stuck to anything! The finished product came out super! Crisp & pretty! I did have to cook them longer to get extra crisp, but well worth it. Doggies can't get enough!!

Made this recipe as written except for using soy nut butter (we have a granddaughter with a deadly peanut allergy). I found the dough very crumbly and dry to work with, so I just kept adding more soy nut butter and Banana until it was a good consistency to work with. Left them in the oven a bit longer for more crunch. They seem to be a big hit with our mixed terrier rescue, Sally. Easy to make, I used a small candy cane cookie cutter, but next time will make little balls and flatten with the bottom a glass.

I made these today and my dogs love them.  They all were in the kitchen the entire time I was cooking them.  I did not roll out the cookie mixture. I spooned out the mixture about half dollar size, covered it with the egg white and flattened them with a fork.  I did put fresh parsley in for their teeth.  They love them and great Easter treat or perfect Christmas gift for any of your friends that have dogs. I will make these again.
Here is a picture of Sam and Sadie.   They love to ride!

I made these for my very picky Bedlington terrier and he loved them.
They are super easy and quick to make.  I substituted the wheat germ for oats and didn't add honey or brush with egg whites. I rolled these into balls and flattend with a fork and they looked more like cookies. Cooked for 30 min and they were perfect. I did 3 taste tests with 3 other store brought dog treats and he chose these everytime. Whenever he sees these he jumps up and down. Next time I make these I am going to try blueberries or strawberries instead of banannas and add molassess. It is much cheaper and healthier to make your own dog treats than to buy those expensive, not sure what's in there dog treats.

Just made this recipe for my puggle. She won't leave the stove now, I think she is in love. She is on wheat free dog food due to an allergy, so I substituted the wheat flour and wheat germ with oatmeal.
 An easy recipe for your best friend!

I adapted the recipe by using oats instead of wheat germ. I used 2/3 cup oat flour and 1/3 cup whole wheat. Used 1-2 extra tablespoons of unsalted peanut butter. I then mixed it up with the kitchen aid, rolled it out on a silicone baking mat, cut it (carefully) with a pizza cutter and put the mat on a baking sheet. The entire process took about 15 minutes. The dog seems to like them.

How do dogs know when you are making these biscuits that they are " doggie cookies"!  I have made them twice and both times when I start putting the ingredients together my dog comes out to the kitchen and sits and watches me make them!!  As soon as they come out of the oven she watches and waits patiently until they are cool enough for her to have a sample.  Very weird.... Anyway she loves them and since they are so easy to make she will continue to have a supply on hand.

I followed the recipe as much as I could, instead of the wheat germ, I used oatmeal, used 1/2 bannana, since that was all I had, I had trouble with the mix, seem to dry and wanted to fall apart, I added 1/2 cup flour, and a little water, seem to stick together better, made around 75 small cookies,froze most of them, only put them in for 30 minutes as the recipe said, and they turned out good, gave one to my dogs and they really liked them, will make these again some time. Next time I will try and subitute the honey for unsweeten applesause, I also used the pizza cutter and that work very well.

I made these a few days ago. I substituted in regular flour and oats (in lieu of wheat germ) and my dog LOVED them. They are already gone. I actually taught her two new tricks with them - she was so eager to have them. And I swear, she knew I was making them for her. She followed the process. I'm going to make more now. The only challenge is that they are incredibly sticky in dough form - they are hard to make into shapes - and get off your fingers! But they are tasty - a little bland for humans, but it's great to know exactly what's in her treats - and this vegetarian loves that it's vegetarian!

I make this treat for my lil girls and their buddies twice a month they love it. They keep great in the fridge for 2 weeks in an airtight container. I use extra oatmeal instead of what germ and zap em in the microwave for 4 seconds to warm em before feeding. Super easy too!

I only had white flour. Also, no wheat germ so added organic bran flakes all crushed up....don't know if that even works as a sub, just took a guess...

Despite that, the dogs still LOVE it. Way more excited about these than their store-bought goodies.

I usually hate getting out the rolling pin, but I wanted to make bone shape dog cookies for a craft show.  This recipe is SO easy & actually fun to make, the dough is just right to work with too. The 1st batch is still in the oven & Quinn, my lab/retriever mix pup is waiting to be taste tester.  I know she'll give this 5 stars; then again she eats anything that fits into her mouth!

My dog loves them! Used 1/4 more PB and oatmeal instead of wheat germ. Flattened with fork & fingers instead of rolling/cutting. Such an easy and super fast treat! I feel so much better knowing exactly what  I'm feeding my pooch. Break them apart and stuff in his Kong with extra PB or cream cheese and he's busy for quite a while! Thanks for the recipe!

I would give this recipe 5 stars for taste b/c my dog went CRAZY over these treats, but he left his own personal 'cookies' in the living room from them. Very easy recipe, too bad my pup's system can't handle them.

I've never made dog biscuits before and these turned out great.  I did have to add extra flour as some of the comments suggested and they rolled out fine.  I will definitely make them again.

Easy to make, I also added some wheat flour but that's usual when making anything rolled. Problem was, I have 4 dogs, and now I have all these biscuits all over the floor since they wouldn't eat them. I don't know...smelled good to me. I tried pieces, whole things, warm, and cold and there they sit...Guess they don't like PB and banana. Where's Elvis' dogs when you need them?

Well how do you rate a dog biscuit, especially if you are not brave enough to taste it (smile) and you have a dog who would eat jsut about anything. Well, I will rate it on our ease on preparing it. It was easy to make, but the batter was a bit sticky and hard to work with- I had to add lots of extra flour when rolling it out. My dog liked it okay and we will definetely make again.

My dog, Boady, just loves these. They are very easy to make and I took another reviewer's suggestion and instead of wheat germ, I used oatmeal and they turned out great. I did also add a little extra banana since my dog is a banana lover. Thanks for the recipe!

Poodle approved!! I made these for christmas gifts for the doggies!! I did make a few changes..I used rye flour instead of wheat and rolled oats instead of wheat germ..our dogs do not eat wheat..I rolled them into little gingerbread boy shapes..the dough was very sticky but i just used lots of flour and they turned out great!! I used melted carob to decorate the little men and even put the doggies names on them!! They were a huge hit with humans and dogs alike!! Everyone wants the recipe and it was fun to make!! will be making again...Maybe hearts for valentines day!!

My dogs love these!! And it's a great way to use up those past due bananas.  I substituted bacon grease for the honey, rolled them 1/4" thick and baked them till they were very dry. They store well, if you have any TO store!

These were a huge hit with my fur babies, and they made my whole house smell heavenly while they baked! I made the recipe as written, and although I may experiment next time with different ingredients, this is a keeper as is!

I made these for my chihuahua so I wanted them to be small so I used my smallest cutters. She’s had two and is already begging for more. Since mine were small I ended up only having them in the oven for about 20 minutes

Great dog-approved recipe! I didn’t change anything in the recipe but I did double it because it didn’t seem like one batch would make enough. By doubling and using a bone-shaped cutter, I was able to fill 2 cookie sheets. ( you can place them close together since they don’t expand). The dough was easy to work with which is a big plus! Made them for my friend’s dogs who loved them and kept looking for more and more!

My pommerian loves these! I replaced wheatgerm with oats and it still worked. I also used Christmas  themed cookie cutters and they're fabulous! The recipe is so simple and healthy!  Thank you for sharing! Jane

Dogs love these.  I used oatmeal and chopped peanuts instead of wheat germ.  I also cooked approximately 10 minutes longer for more crunch.  Dogs love it.  I posted the photo of our corgi sitting patiently by oven waiting!

This recipe is Scotty dog approved. I also took it to Christmas with the family, and the puppy cousins also loved these cookies! I used oatmeal instead of wheat germ, and did not roll the dough out but did drop cookies and flattened them with my fingers. I will be making these quite often for my dog.

For Christmas, I received a dog biscuit mold, and used it to make biscuits today.  I rolled about a tablespoon into a little log and squished it into the mold...much easier than rolling and cutting.  See my attached picture.

I followed the recipe exactly, except I forgot the egg wash.  It still turned out great and my dogs loved them!!  It’s such an easy recipe with ingredients that I normally have on hand- there’s no reason to buy any dog biscuits when you can easily make your own!

My two #goldendoodles_cuties LOVED these treats.  I didn't have wheat germ so (after researching online for a good substitute ) I increased the whole wheat flour to 1 1/2 cup.  Everything else stayed the same except, after adding the flour, I added blueberries (these are their normal treats). I also applied doggie yogurt icing after they cooled.  Lola, my 8 year old is not a fan of Bananas but she couldn't stop smelling the sheet pan on the counter. Ziggy, 11 months wasn't sure at first because it was harder than his normal treats however, he soon realized these were the best combination of flavors!!

Made these for training my puppy. Used oat bran in place of whole wheat flour. Didn't want to throw out the yolk of one egg so threw that in the recipe. Too sticky to roll out so did tablespoon balls pressed down. Still chewy which my dog loved. Cooled them down fast, tore them up and then froze them flat. Great for training!! I ate one … tasted like peanut butter banana bread!

great recipe as is or with a bit of tweaking. I doubled the recipe and used oatmeal instead of the wheat germ. I also added flax seed for the nutritional boost. My dogs went nuts. 

I added flour or oatmeal as needed to firm up the dough and  dusted flour on cutters, they cut beautifully. Made extra for neighborhood dogs

These were instantly snapped up! I made them for a dog obedience training school open house. I  increased the peanut butter to 1/2 cup and subbed flax meal for the wheat germ. I also used ripe bananas that I had previously frozen, so was glad to find another use for them. The dough was a perfect consistency to roll out.

I used what I had on hand: regular unbleached flour and regular oatmeal (instead of the wheat germ).
I did not brush the tops with egg white (the dogs don't care if it's shiny!).
I used a whole banana rather than measuring a 1/2 cup.
I added extra flour before trying to roll it out because it was too sticky.  (probably from the extra banana).
I used a pizza cutter to cut diamond shapes (long cuts one way, long cuts the other way).
I didn't grease the baking sheet (it's an old non-stick sheet).

I'll definitely make these again. The dogs like them, it's a simple recipe, and I know what the ingredients are.

I used brown rice flour instead of whole wheat you need almost double the amount though. I haven’t yet had a taster to see if they pass the yummy test, they were easy to make and look adorable!

I ran out of Dog treats this weekend and didn't want to make a trip into town.  B-i-n-g-o!   I found this yummy recipe I could make from what I already had in my cabinets.  

I substituted rolled oats for the wheat germ and water for the honey - all the same amounts.  Twenty minutes in the oven, and B-i-n-g-o!  All Recipes saved the day and made my Bella one happy pup!  

I saved myself a little time by rolling into balls with my hands and using a fork to press the dough like miniature peanut butter cookies because essentially, this is what they are!  My Bella loved them!   I'm already making batch number two!  I would recommend doubling the recipe, especially if you have more than one dog!  

I took some photos, but this is my first time here.  If I can find a way to upload... I'll share!   Another day I'd like to try using some of my frozen blueberries in them.   You could also use a little applesauce!  Thank you!  These are GREAT!

My dog is a senior, so I used 1/2 c. gluten free and 1/2 c. shredded unsweetened coconut, 2T. ground flax, eliminated the honey and 1 egg. It was a little dry, so I added a small amount of water. After 30 min. of baking I turned the oven off and let them for an hour. They are crunchy and my dog love them!

I use this recipe regularly. My dogs wait by the oven door. In fact, now when they smell/hear me peeling a banana, they come running in anticipation.  They love these treats. Used a cute cookie cutter and made some bags of treats for Christmas gifts.

Really easy and quick to make.  I followed the recipe exactly and they came out perfect. The egg wash made a nice glossy shell on the outside, inside was soft and chewy. My three dogs gobbled them down and begged for more!

I LOVE these for my pomeranian.   These are our go to treats.   When I first started making these several years ago - and I follow the recipe as is, I actually used a collection of puppy cookie cutter shapes (Bone, fire hydrant, dog house etc).   My pom is only 4 pounds and found that we were still breaking them at least in half when giving to her.   Now we roll them out on the parchment paper lined cookie sheet and use the pizza cutter and make them into little squares.

My dogs love these, so did my roommate, opps!! The first time I made these it did take a lot longer than 30 mins with my oven set on 300 degrees, I may have cut them thicker than 1/4" but it was over an hour before they had a "crunchy" texture.  What seems to work for me  is baking at 350 degrees for 45 mins. Even if some are thicker than others they all come out perfect!

HE LIKES IT!!! :D I followed the recipe EXACTLY - I purposely went out and bought whole wheat flour and wheat germ for this recipe (and I can use them in other recipes so it wouldn't have been a big loss), and my Shih Poo, Hunter, LOVED it! I wasn't sure if the banana was supposed to be ripe, so I just used the ones I bought right away. I'm so glad that I can now make my own dog treats, that are all natural and easy to make, and most importantly, that my dog LOVES! Thanks for the recipe!

This is a winner at our house!!!  I had to use white all purpose flour,I don't keep wheat on hand,and rolled oats instead of wheat germ,I followed everything  else,I used to much flour when rolling out so had to much on the back side,my fault.I cooked them 25 minutes then turned them over and cooked another 15 minutes,cooled on wire cooling rack.I melted a little butter and brushed the flour side with it.
Our 2 spoiled Pomeranian gobbled them down.
My yield was 22 cookies ,these were very quick and easy to make make and cheap too!!!! I will be making them many more times,thank you for sharing your recipe!!

I unplugged had gluten free plain flour on hand and used 1/2 cup wheat germ and 1/4 cup rolled oats, then mixed flour in until it was a dough consistency. Needless to say that my dog ‘woofs’ these ones down! Definitely a keeper for the recipe book!

My dogs, as well as their friends, LOVED these! I have a senior dog whose teeth were all pulled prior to our adopting him, so I bake these for only 17 min. so they are soft enough for him to eat...and refrigerate them so they'll stay fresh. These stayed fresher longer than others I've made. Just made them 2 weeks ago, and the doggy friends are already asking for more!

My mini dachshund puppy loves them. She is very picky and will not eat dried dog food  but knowing she needed something hard to keep her teeth clean I took a chance on this recipe.  I made a second batch to put in the freezer!

I've made these twice now with the same result: the dough is too wet to roll. No problem; I formed little balls. My Navidad loves them! I used them to teach her to "speak", that's how enthusiastic she is about them! ;-)

My Dog has separation anxiety and I added about 350 milligrams of full spectrum CBD Hemp oil. CDB hemp Oil has no psychoactive effects (HIGH) and has amazing benefits when it come to anxiety. After a few days my pup was really progressing with the anxiety. I would suggest 1 to 2 1x1" squared treats. My pups issue is being placed in a create no matter if I'm right next to it or out of the house. This is a great recipe and she loves them.

I didn't have wheat germ, so I substituted it with flaxseed meal- it has a lot of health benefits for dogs. The treats smelled amazing while baking and my dog loved them! Success!

Baked this recipe and followed it totally for my dog but I added CBD canna oil for his hip pain.  Our furry son is 10 yrs old and starting to show his aches.  He BEGS for these cookies and we’ll continue making them.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I have made these dog cookies twice now. The first time I had to substitute oatmeal for the wheat germ as I didn't have any wheat germ. The next time I made these cookies I followed all the ingredients in the recipe. The dogs loved these cookies no matter which way I made them!

These are good for your dog, but it's a good idea to always use oats instead of flour.  Dogs have trouble digesting flour, even whole wheat flour.

My Aussies loved this! I took the advice of other reviewers and stored mine in the fridge and my dogs liked them cold. I like the fact that the recipe is simple and uses ingredients I usually have in the house. I only changed the wheat germ to flaxseed meal and they still gobbled them up. I didn't use the egg white wash tho; didn't want to "waste" a yolk and the dogs don't care what the biscuits look like :-)

I replaced the wheat germ for 1 cup of Flaxseed Meal. Also I doubled the recipe and ended up with about 36+ cookies. My dogs loved them and I must say they were very addictive, had to hold myself back from eating them all! Haha! :-P

We are making these doggie biscuits for the second time in two weeks.  However, this time we are doubling the recipe so we don't' run out so soon. Our fury kids love loved these treats. The first time we followed the recipe to a "T".  This time I replaced the wheat germ with flaxseed meal just for added health benefits.  We cut the biscuits in to the shape of little hearts.  We're giving little gift bags of these treats to our friends with furry kids for Valentine's day?

Made as directed except I substituted oatmeal for wheat germ. Didn't bother with the egg white and the dog doesn't seem to care LOL

My big dogs love these! I used oats instead of wheat germ and next time I will bake them longer to get them more crunchy (maybe the wheat germ helps with this? Idk). What an easy and quick recipe!

This is a FANTASTIC recipe for you and your furbaby. I made a few changes like, skipped out on the wheat germ (due to one or two of our 3 dogs is allergic to wheat), no substitutions for it. I also used a different flour, instead of the whole wheat, I used a self rising. This made the treat moist, almost like a bread. But next time I am going to cut back on the amount of bannana I use because it over powers the peanut butter. Either way, great recipe and should be used frequently. :)

This recipe got great reviews, but I just felt it needed one more thing to drive my dogs crazy! The secret ingreadiant is `TUNA`! Yeah Baby! I drained a can of tuna and mashed it up with the bananas. I had to add a little more flour because of this. So I doubled the recipe because it would save me time and money in the long run. I have two small dogs so I made  96  briskets in the shape of a 25 cent coins.  If  I was to make a single batch, I`d only add a half can of tuna.  Just keep them refrigerated or frozen.  What can I say...it`s like Doggy Crack!

My dog loved these biscuits! I made a few small revisions, I used a half a cup of oatmeal instead of the wheat germ  and  I used half a cup of butter instead of 1/3 cup. I have a small dog so I rolled  little tiny balls and then press them down with my fingers .I cooked them at 350° for 12 minutes and they were perfect.

I followed the recipe with whatever I had in stock and followed the instructions exactly right but something was wrong. I made it twice, I substituted wheat germ with oatmeal and substituted the whole wheat flour with normal flour, but it turned out like bread with no taste at all. How do I fix that? Is it because I need the whole wheat flour? My dog Lylah still went crazy for them anyway, and because the way I made them, they went stale within a few days and I had to throw them out.

Dogs loved them!  If you need to make yours dog treats wheat-free (like me), substitute garbanzo flour or coconut flour for the wheat flour and milled flax seeds for the wheat germ.

I'm making this for three dogs, two of whom are on the elderly side (one is running out of teeth!) so I didn't cook their batch as long, to leave them a little softer (15-25 minutes in a gas oven that typically cooks at a lower temp than what it claims). I did make them into shapes, and yes, it took quite a bit of extra flour, but I think they look adorable. I also forgot to brush with egg whites, but they turned out well regardless! They look a little more like dog treats this way, I think.

The oldest of the three, the pickiest dog I know (I tried to feed him a scrambled egg once recently... It went uneaten), just gave his stamp of approval and was eager for more! The youngest, a Great Pyrenees, took his from my hand without even really thinking twice. 

On to see what the beagle mix thinks. 

Also, some humans have approved, and one said it had a sort of molasses taste, as well as the PB & B. I didn't really like the wheat germ taste, though. Maybe next time I'll use oats! 

And in the fall, I think I'll do some pumpkin ones.

Doubled the recipe and used cornmeal instead of wheat germ (didn't have any on hand). My finicky and pampered pooch Pit Bull was reticent at first, then loved them.
I'll make them again and again. 
Thank you for sharing this recipe!

My dog loves these treats but I had to double the flour.  It was really sticky and impossible to work otherwise.  Also had to bake an additional 10 minutes.  Substituted rolled oats for the wheatgerm.

Excellent!  I doubled it, used up my over ripe bananas. Our GSP and Pom love them.  I added flour to roll, rolled to an eighth  inch thin, placed on Parchment  paper and used a pizza cutter to slice into small squares, then baked. Turned out great. Can put in my pocket for training no problem.

It is a great and easy recipe. Like others, I used Oatmeal. Not sure why one person feels the pictures is deceiving. Why, because it is brown and glossy? Pretty simple to figure out....Peanut butter + wheat flour makes it brown and the egg white makes it glossy.

I didn't have the wheat items, so I used regular flour and oats. I made a double batch since I have 3 dogs, and they all LOVE them - even my picky eater was dancing around for another one! They love cookies (what we call treats) and I definitely feel better giving them these than store-bought. Plus these are very cheap and easy to make! I'll have to get the wheat flour since that's what all the puppy treats seem to call for. Thanks!

I made these biscuits for two Yorkies and a German Shepard. They couldn't get enough of them! I tried one myself and they weren't half bad! I substituted oats for the wheat germ and doubled the peanut butter. All three went crazy. After the first biscuit, if they even smelled them they started doing tricks. This recipe is top knotch! Thank you

Made it and my dog loved them.  I replaced wheat germ with milled flax seed powder and used crunchy peanut  butter.  Planning to try to replace the banana with baby food meat or pureed chicken breast, I'll let you know how it turns out.

My dogs LOVE this! I followed the recipe exactly the first time, and my dogs went crazy for it. My favorite part of this recipe is how adaptable it is. I substitute the banana for other things, depending on what my dogs need at the time. For example, when my dogs have trouble going #2 (ew, sorry), I do 1/4 cup banana and 1/4 cup pumpkin purée. My husky girl is prone to UTIs, so I make a special batch for her with puréed cranberries instead of bananas. I also add a few scoops of flavorless fiber! I tripled the recipe and took it to the dog park. Those dogs tried to follow me home! Lol. Good luck!

This was easy to make and most of these ingredients are in my pantry as staples. I have a puppy and a senior dog (with a delicate tummy) and both loved the treats. My senior dog was able to enjoy them without any digestive complications. All natural and the dogs loved them. I used the recipe exactly as written without any changes or substitutions. I'll be making a batch to share with other dogs in the family!

Our Jack Russell mix has serious food allergies. I substitute ground oats for the flour. I double the batch and increase the ground oats by about 1/2 cup and add an extra banana. I have also combined crunchy peanut butter with smooth. The pups love these cookies! As they are baking in the oven I have Lucy, and her newly adopted brother sitting in front of the oven waiting. They keep better in a paper bag than Tupperware and they freeze very well. I am making several batches for Xmas presents. Amazing recipe and can be altered to what you have in your pantry.

Our dogs love these treats but my daughter-in-law thought they were a little bland. :D I followed the recipe but put the dough in a cookie press instead of rolling it out and cutting it. The dough is a bit gooey for the cookie press but the dogs really don't care if the cookies look like X-mas trees or not. I think I'll make these cookies again real soon.

Our dog really liked these. I didn't have any wheat germ so I added a half cup of shredded wheat, left out the honey. I also added an extra 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour as I wanted a stiffer dough. I baked them for 30 minutes, turned the oven off and left then in there until the oven had cooled. Our Annie always loves her cookies but she begs for these. Great recipe, thanks Sandra.

These treats are a hit! They are so easy to make, and my dogs love them. Thanks to all the other reviews, I easily used what I had here. Instead of using wheat germ I used rolled oats. They didn't turn out as crunchy as I was hoping, so next time I will try to bake them a little longer, and follow the recipe exactly.

LOOOVVEEE IT!!! my dog goes crazy for them.... I made them and put a peanut butter chicken glaze on top and, well they were gone within the day! I put sweet potato instead of bananas (we were out) and i added a little applesauce because they were slightly dry... I cooked for about ten minutes and they were perfect.... I will definitely make these again!

Great!! My huskie loves these! I handed some out to my friends and coworkers. I now have people asking to BUY these from me! I do substitute the wheat germ with oatmeal.
Also, I found it easiest to roll this out and cut it in squares with my pizza cutter.

I have three doggies and they absolutely love the cookies. I tasted it as well:) I changed the receipe a little bit and made the healthy version. Insteed of wheat flower and wheat germ I used Rice flour and Oat bran. I didn't use the honey at all. I did the double amount and end up with 160 cookies. Thank you so much for the great receipe.

Easy to make, and my Great Pyrenees puppy loves them. Dough is a bit sticky so just add some flour when you roll out and they come out perfectly.

My 2 Chihuahuas love thesse treats. I've been making them for about 3 months and they won't eat any other treats. We ran out a few days ago and tried to give them store bought treats and they left them in the floor.

Excellent Receipt.  This was extremely easy to prepare and my dogs love these healthy treats.  I suggest refrigerating the dough for an hour prior to rolling.

I made this recipe for all my four legged family and friends and they gave it a four paws up!! I used fire hydrant cutters for the bigger dogs and small heart shapes for the wee tiny ones (which yielded about 150 cookies). I also had some crazy friends try them on as human cookies because the ingredients sounded yummy to them as well. I think they will stick to oreos instead. Fabulous recipe that I have shared with a dozen friends already!! Thanks for the great tip!!

This recipe was devoured by 5 of our 6 doxies (the other has no teeth).  I loved that it had few ingredients and could easily be doubled.  I took another reviewers warning about the stickiness and substituted real maple syrup for the honey - was pawfect!!  I did cut-outs with da oxie cookie cutter, a bone cutter.  It was, however,  easiest/quickest to follow another reviewers suggestion to use the drop method and flatten well with a fork.  Great treats!  WOOFERS!

I didn't have wheat germ or oats so I just added another half cup of the whole wheat flour and they came out great! Easy to roll out and cooked perfectly. I also freeze my old bananas now and use them for these.

My dog *husky/malamute mix* LOVES these...BUT I have trouble getting them to get completely hard in the middles..I've baked them at 300 for half an hour, or sometimes longer, but the edges (I use cookie cutters) start to brown too much and if I let them go too long, they start to burn. Anyone have any suggestions??

Ran out of store bought treats for my dogs so I decided to bake some myself. I have 4 dogs: 2 labs a Siberian husky and a mini rat terrier. The husky is super picky and all 4 dogs love them. They aren't crunchy but I think my foods like them that way. I can't wait to make more for my friends dogs. I know my niece will love them for her dog too.

This recipe makes 18 dog bone biscuits. Very quick to prepare and simple ingredients! I added some ground apple peel and used 1/4cup ground flax seed instead of wheat germ. I also took out the honey. Tested on two dogs and they loved it. :)

My dogs loved these cookies.  Instead of wheat germ I used flax seed that I had on hand - it gave the dough a distinctive scent, but the pups didn't mind. I also used crunchy peanut butter and added the extra egg yolk (left over when I separated the egg white). I didn't have a fancy shape to cut them with, so I used a small round cookie cutter and then cut the rounds in half.  It seems to render the perfect size for my two 20 pound mutts.

I was searching for a recipe that didn't have milk and baking powder and was glad to find this one. I wanted a big batch so I tripled the recipe (I was using a small cutter so I knew I'd have a lot on hand). Unfortunately, I did not have any bananas and that is a key component to the recipe. I will be sure to have that on hand next time. I wound up having to use milk and the cookies came out good. I didn't do the egg wash sheen since I doubt my dogs will care. I did try it myself and the peanut butter comes through. While I didn't get feedback from my dogs they were circling my feet. Mission accomplished.

I made these dog biscuits, but I skipped the wheat germ and didn't brush them with egg whites.  I made a triple batch and used a small doggie bone cookie cutter.  It made over 100 biscuits.  My two labs LOVE them and I do too... I know what's in their treats!

My dogs love these cookies.  I've made them as written, but also made them gluten free using ground golden flax seeds, chickpea flour and almond meal and they turned out great.  I use a small ice cream scoop and place the balls on a cookie sheet and freeze the dough balls.  I cut each ball of dough in four pieces before baking as to make nice small cookies, good for training.

This is such a simple and easy recipe. My dogs (3) absolutely LOVE these and do just about anything for them! I came across this recipe about a month ago and have made it 3 times. I was so impressed with how much my dogs loved them that I began handing them out to my friends for their dogs. I have also tweaked the recipe a couple of times with other ingredients (pumpkin, oats, etc.) just to change it up. As a result of how easy this is, I have stopped buying treats. LOVE this!

My two Boston Terriers love these treats! I double the recipe, bake half and freeze the other half for later -dough freezes well. I also don't want to take the time to roll out the dough and cut so I roll the dough into pea sized balls with my fingers and flatten with a fork (my dogs don't seem to mind this shortcut)  I started making this recipe several years ago after hearing stories of dogs becoming ill from the ingredients in commercial treats. Again this week, I am hearing similar stories regarding tainted dog products, so I will keep making Baxter and Opal's favorite cookies.

My super picky dog went completely nuts over these. These are the very first homemade dog treats that he actually likes. He will do just about anything for the pb and banana treats. I will make these over and over. I like that the ingredient list is short and simple, no extra shopping trips required, and they are very quick and easy to make. The dough is extremely sticky though, I had to use a lot of all purpose flour to be able to roll it out.
They do smell a little funky when they come out of the oven I think, my husband didn't think it was bad. But it doesn't matter, I have a very happy dog here.

Easy to do and my dog liked them. I doubled the recipe because it said it made 10, but normal recipe size would be plenty. I did use more like 1 1/2 c of flour instead of just 1 because it was so sticky. I also used regular flour and oats instead of wheat flour and wheat germ because that's what I had.

I followed the recipe exactly the first time, and my 2 dogs loved the cookies.  The second time I made it, I omitted the honey since I figured that the cookies are probably sweet enough.  Easy to make.  Next time, I will use oatmeal like other reviewers suggested.

I made them w/ a small cutter about the size of a 50 cent piece.
Made over 6 dozen small treats.
Funny thing is our Akita Dru wouldn't touch them UNTIL they were fully cooled. 
Funny because he loves 'people' cookies right out of the oven.
He loves them now!
Suggest you roll them between two pieces of wax paper as the dough is VERY sticky.

These roll out and shape beautifully! The pups love 'em! I followed the recipe as is. Using a convection oven... It is easy to over-brown them while getting them dry enough not to spoil in the cookie jar. Though I was baking 3 trays at once and my biscuits were less than 1/4". Next time, I will rotate my pans as my oven won't go lower than 300. Very easy!  :~D

I made these for my dogs as well as all our family and close friends as Christmas gifts.  They all loved them! I made them as drop cookies rather then rolling them since I was making so many and it was easy and worked well.  I also didn't add the honey since it didn't seem neccessary.

I've made this recipe 5 times, each with a slightly different variation (on ingredients as well as the dogs eating them).  
So the first time, I didn't feel like using flour, so I threw oatmeal into my blender and ground it down to oat flour.  This made a very stiff dough that was very easy to roll out, and yielded cookies that cooked up very dry and crunchy, which is what you want when you make a big batch and want them to store a long time.  Moisture is the enemy.  Mixing this by hand was tough.  The next time, I added more banana, which meant more flour, and instead of mixing by hand, I threw it in my bread machine to mix.  I would highly recommend this for the lazy cook.  My other variations have been minor: adding flax seed, using maple syrup instead of sugar, etc.  The big one was changing from regular flour to my "oat flour".  I recently made this at my parents house, and they don't have a blender, so I used regular flour since I couldn't make my oat flour.  The recipe as above, with reg flour, was *much* easier to mix by hand than the oat flour variation.  However, the dough I ended up with was very stretchy, like pizza dough, and would spring back (shrink) while I was rolling it out, which was a little frustrating.  The biscuits also puffed up a little  bit using regular flour and they didn't using oat. 
Despite variations, this recipe gets two paws up from a pair of aging dachshunds, my beagle/boxer mix, a black lab, a great dane, a collie, and two mystery mixes.

Very easy and the dogs love them!  I didn't have any challenges rolling the dough out.  I then took a pizza cutter to cut the cookies into 1" squares -- very quick!  I like to give my dogs crunchier treats so next time I'll either roll them thinner or bake them a little longer.

I was decided on this recipe for making Christmas biscuits for all my dog friends. I also replaced the wheat germ with oatmeal and dipped them in carob and sprinkles. I ran a taste test with my two dogs against their favorite store bought treats. Both dogs chose to eat these biscuits first. They are easy, cheap, and quick and you know the ingredients are healthy for your dogs too. Lol, I even took a bit out of one to try it. It was very dry, but had great flavor (for a dog biscuit). I am sure your people friends would prefer other recipes on this site much more, but your dog will truly love them.

Love this recipe! I also used oats instead of wheat germ. And I dressed them up for Christmas. Used Christmas cookie cutters, I dipped the cookies in melted Carob Chocolate (good for dogs) and added some sprinkles to make it fun. It makes a good snack once and a while for my fury babies. I leave the cookies in the fridge, so the chocolate stays fresh.

Super easy and fun recipe to make with kids. We got a 3-size set of bone-shaped cookie cutters and made two batches of these treats for our pooch's 2nd birthday party at the bark park. Big hit. Definitely a keeper.

This recipe is very easy to make and my dogs loved it. I used ground flax seed and quick oats instead of wheat germ b/c that's what I had on hand. One note- definitely use lots of flour when rolling out the dough b/c of the sticky consistency.

I decided to make these as they did not call for sugar or bullion for flavor which can harm dogs. I wasn't impressed with my results. It took allot more flour than stated to be able to roll. I baked them for 40 minutes and they are still cookie like inside. And they are rolled thinner than 1/4 inch. Which is why they will only last a week. You have to bake dog treats until every last trace of moisture is baked out of them or they will likely mold quickly. I can't get them any drier, maybe due to the banana. I will give half the batch away so they can get used before they spoil but will not make again.

The dogs barely let me get them in the oven!  I bet they would have been just as happy with the batter!  I also didn't bother rolling and cutting them, I doubt the dogs care, and that cut down the prep time significantly.  They LOVE these treats- but if you have two big dogs like I do, at least tripple the recipe (for 30 two inch round cookies).    I also substituted oatmeal for the wheat germ.  I will NEVER buy another dog treat again.  I made a second batch, and put them in holiday tins for my neighbors dogs as a christmas gift and everyone wants the recipe.  Thanks a million.

On behalf of two of the most persnickety dogs in the Tennessee Zoo for the Insane, thank you, Sandra. Friends, if you have a dog, try these.  You will have to play with it a bit to get the texture you want, but no matter the texture, your  dog(s) are going to love 'em.  And a special "Thank, you." to Susan (27 APR  2009 review) for the tip on baby food bananas, they worked out fine and  probably helped with the texture.

This is a really easy recipe to put together and seems yummy enough.  I made some today for some pup friends of mine who recently moved into a new house with their human parents... I plan to take these to the housewarming party as part of the gift.  I didn't try one - but the dough smelled good, they smelled good as they cooked, and they smell good now!  Hopefully my pup friends will enjoy them!

I have two golden retrievers and they both loved it! Their favorite special treats that they get are peanut butter and also bananas. They are so excited to get one of these rather than a milkbone.

Great recipe! I just made these for my Yorkies and they LOVED them. I didn't have any wheat germ, so I used crushed Cheerios instead, and it still turned out fine. I found that 1.5 bananas is about 1/2 cup mashed.  Make sure to use plenty of flour when rolling out the dough, as it tends to get very sticky.

Made these for my "nephew's" one year doggy party...he loved them, along with the other doggie guests.  Doubled the batch and kept some for my dog also, she was hesitant at first but now can't wait, she actually sits by the oven and waits for them!
