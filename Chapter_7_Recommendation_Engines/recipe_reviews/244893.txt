I LOVED this recipe with my changes, would give it 10 stars: 

I added 2 large chicken breasts, poached & shredded & sprinkled with the chorizo. Without this addition it would never have fed 8. I added quite a bit of chipotle powder and smoked paprika to the sauce which took it from bland to phenomenal. I absolutely preferred this to a tomato-based lasagna. Next time I'll add some sautéed spinach or chard between the layers.

I thought I was crazy to attempt this recipe, but I’m glad I did. It’s a weird, but tasty, twist to tomato-based lasagna. I didn’t pre-cook the noodles and, after broiling, slicing, and serving, realized the noodles were too under-cooked. I added 1/3 cup of water (didn’t want it to dry out), resealed, and cooked another 15 minutes, then another 20 minutes. Scrumptious! I didn’t have cilantro; didn’t miss it. The spice of the chorizo was just right for our family. We don’t do much spice. I might try adding a little spinach next time like another review suggested and I will definitely pre-cook the noodles al dente to speed things up.

Good, but it made a lot of sauce. Made it exactly as written but needed longer to cook than 15 minutes as the noodles were still pretty chewy. I'd also recommend adding more than 1/2 lb of chorizo.

Absolutely delicious! We followed the recipe assuming not to pre-cook the noodles and it was a winner. We thought about adding chicken, but I'm glad we didn't do that as the dish is tasty as is. You can control the spice level with the type of chorizo you use. Yum.

I peeled and chopped the butternut squash and cooked the chorizo, cooled and refrigerated the day before to save time.  I followed this recipe exactly except I cooked the lasagna noodles according to the package directions before layering into the casserole. The recipe did not mention to cook the noodles?? Anyway, this was fabulous. I had company over and all 4  were raving! Thank you for a great recipe.
