I only used one pepper and it was still really spicy.

Quite delicious.  I made this as written, using the suggested 'more to taste' 2 chipotle peppers. It was a really nice change for tuna salad.  We packed it in our lunches, one day on a wrap with lettuce and tomato slices and the next day a top of a bed of lettuce as a salad.  We enjoyed it both ways.  The next time I'm going to add a stalk of celery as we like the crunch it adds to tuna.

I altered this quite a bit. Omitted the peas and added a couple stalks of chopped celery. I take Chipotles in Adobo sauce and chop them up in a little food processor. Take a portion of the mixture and wrap it in a 10 inch tortilla with some shredded cheddar cheese (and hot pepper rings if you want). Bake that in a toaster oven until the tortilla is just crispy. I would never have put the tuna and chipotles together without this recipe!

Great! Loved the spiciness. I would have never thought to put peas in my tuna

This is yummy! I used about 1 T diced yellow onion instead of dried. I will try this again.
