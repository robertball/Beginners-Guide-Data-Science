Great Recipe 5 stars! Will be making this one again! I used pecans instead of almonds.  I lightly sprinkled powder sugar while still warm on the top.  Make sure they are cool before cutting as per the recipe.    Also,  left out the coconut flakes!  Not a big fan of coconut.   Thank you for sharing:)

These turned out SO much better than I thought they would! Very lemony, but I made sure to increase the lemon zest to 3 tablespoons. I ended up using the zest from 6 lemons, and the juice from 4 lemons. 
I subbed in half a cup of veggie oil, because I was short on butter, and I added an extra tablespoon of both ground pecans (no almonds =/) and flour to the filling/topping, and gave the the topping an extra 5 minutes in the oven because of the "slimy" comment, and they turned out great.
Only caveat here was the crust, it was a tad dry and needed extra time in the oven to brown, but I suspect my pan was too small.

I made these as directed except I didn't add the coconut.  Everyone loved the crust and the filling has a great texture.  The only thing I didn't care for was the color.  Because of the brown sugar they don't have that bright lemon color.  A small shake of powdered sugar on the top before serving makes them a little more attractive.

Not your everyday lemon bars.  Good, but I like a stronger lemon flavor.  I also agree with other reviewers about the coconut.  I like coconut, so included it, but I think it reduced the lemon flaver.  I doubled the recipe and baked in a 9 x 13 pan.  Worked well.

Delicious.  Perfect blend of sweet and tart.  Easy to make.  Had no problems with the filling solidifying.  Followed the recipe exactly, except I did not toast the coconut.  I'll definitely make again, and again, and again.

Thanks Sierra!

This is a very delicious recipe! I love the addition of coconut - brilliant! I added a bit more lemon zest, but beyond that, I didn't change a thing and they were as beautiful as they were delicious!

good recipe, i found that the lemon taste was a bit strong but other than that it was great. i'd advise putting some powdered sugar on top once you've finished.

This recipe is delicious, but I added 3 tablespoons more lime juice because as it was I couldn't taste any lime flavour.

These are delicious! I didn't have almonds so used some pecans and cashews about 1/2 cup.. My husband is in heaven. I'm doubling this next time for a 9X13 baking dish. Thanks for posting!

This resume was terrible. Not nearly lemony enough, and the filling was brown colored and seemed way overcooked. Not at all creamy like you would expect. Will not make this recipe again.
