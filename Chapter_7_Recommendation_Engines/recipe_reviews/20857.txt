This was too thick for a dip - so it was served as a spread. It is too salty - if I was to make it again I'd omit the salt altogether.

Actually, I'd make this with less garlic & onions and/or no salt.  Add chopped mandarian oranges (drained).  Either roll into a ball and cover with pecans or spread in a pie plate a cover with pecans.  Makes a great dip!

Delicious and a big hit with everyone! (I leave out the onions just because I don't like them.)
