Excellent i was looking for something exciting and different for a xmas cookie swap and this is it! The flavor gets better and better it seems even as they sit.  The appearance is your typical drop cookie look, but the flavor can not be beat! This may well be my signature cookie - thanks!!

Because the dough was very wet already, I did not add the liqueur along with the soaked cherries, I just spooned them out of the liqueur into the cookie dough.  They do spread out quite a bit so leave plenty of room between cookies.

I tried these cookies and was blown away at how good they are.  I had to go to a cookie party, I'm not much of a cookie eating person, but these were FANTASTIC!!!

I omitted the white chocolate and nuts.  Still totally awesome.  Made them for the holidays and they were a huge hit, because they were so moist, they stayed fresh for a long time.

Gee...I followed the recipe, except for the parchment paper.  They were in the oven, looking beautiful...and the next thing I knew, I had pancakes!  They were SO flat - making them not very appealing-looking.  I'm disappointed - another cookie exchange idea shot. I feel like I wasted my macadamia nuts on this one. I put an extra 1/3 cup of flour in the remaining batter - then they resembled cookies! They tasted fine - but not at all what I expected.

I sent these to my husband who is deployed and he really liked them.  He shared them with his office and his boss said they were "awesome".  The only change I made was with the chocolate chips.  We don't like white chocolate so I just used a full cup of semi-sweet.
