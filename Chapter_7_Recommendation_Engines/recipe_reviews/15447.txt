Far too SWEET, and I had left out half a cup of sugar.  Definately would not make again.

I was nervous about this recipe, but I LOVE it!...Its very sweet but definately a "man-trap"!!!...its a southern recipe.  I actually substituted the half and half for eagle brand condensed milk and YES I did use this much sugar, however I noticed that it made about two pies.  After making the pie, taste the mix and add where you see necessary!  I also cooked it for longer than the 40 minutes...because I like that slightly burned look on top of my sweet potato pies.  This PIE was Off the HOOK!

I made some pretty serious modifications to this recipe and it turned out fantastic (see my custom version) but my rating is based on the recipe as written.  It has serious flaws and I urge you to use it for inspiration but heed the warnings of the reviewers.  If you've ever baked a pumpkin pie you would know that 3 cups of sugar is WAY too much for this pie.  Sweet potato is already sweeter than pumpkin to begin with so doesn't need much to sweeten it up.  I used 1 cup and it was plenty.  I used only 1/2 cup butter and can't imagine how greasy the end result would be if you actually used 2 sticks of butter in this.  I reduced the half and half to 3/4 cup to get the consistency I felt was right.  It will be a pretty runny consistency, similar to pumpkin pie, but will set up as it bakes.  I have to say I like the method of sprinkling the nutmeg on top.  It makes for a very pretty presentation.  I also mixed a bit of it into the batter.  It compliments the sweet potato really well and I didn't feel any other spice was needed.  Make sure you store this in the fridge and serve cold.

Ugghhh, I find it tough to make the sweet potato pie's sweet enough! I normally use sweetened condensed milk, brown sugar, and white sugar in my recipe. 
Now maybe, just maybe,  1 cup of butter is enough  to make two pies :)
Nevertheless, be encouraged, some folks like it sweet, while others prefer the store bought taste!

I also made some modifications to this pie.  I used 1 and 1/2 stick of butter and I used 1 can of sweetened condensed milk and 2 cups of white sugar.  I also had a little more than 3 cups of mashed sweet potatoes.  I would say about 3 and 1/2 cups almost 4.  I added nutmeg, cinnamon, ginger, and cloves as well.  Not a lot of each, just a pinch.  It really made the difference in the flavor.   This is a great pie for the Season and if you like pumpkin pie it's a great way to do something a little different.  Sweet potato pie taste much better in my opinion then pumpkin it has much more flavor.   This pie is great topped with some home made whip cream as well.  Use around a pint of heavy whipping cream and 1/3 cup of confectioners sugar and whip it up.  It's light and not so sweet as the pie is sweet enough.  Top the whip cream with a sprinkle of nutmeg and it's perfect!!
