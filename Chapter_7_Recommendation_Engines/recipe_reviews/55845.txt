Absolutely Wonderful!  I did make the recipe a little more user friendly.  I bought a costco rotisserie chicken and softened my veggies on the stovetop, while I shredded my chicken, I made 2 packages of the Mahatma brand yellow rice, then mixed everything together and baked for 20 min.  It was all gone.  I had my nieces over and my hubby and I did not even get seconds.

Quick and easy..A great recipe! The only thing is, I would have liked a little more "bite" to it. I think next time instead of the pimentos I will add a can of the diced tomatoes with green chili's to it. Also I used boneless and skinless chicken breasts, because that is what I had. Thanx!
---------
Just an update...I tried this recipe again this time replacing the pimentos with chopped tomatoes with green chilis and it was EXCELLENT!! Will definately keep in my recipe box and will keep making. It was a hit in my house..when my "men" are happy so am I..(smile)

This turned out great! I did do some shortcuts and added some curry powder and garlic. I boiled boneless skinless chicken breasts, then shredded into a bowl. I added garlic salt, curry powder, pepper and seasoned salt plus just enough water to moisten chicken enough for the spices to stick. I sauteed the onions and bell pepper with a little garlic salt and curry powder, then put the vegetables, chicken, cooked rice, pimientos and chestnuts to a baking dish and mixed. I topped with a little bit of fresh grated parmesan and baked for the 15 minutes. Will definitely make again.

I noticed as I was going through the reviews before I made it that almost no one followed the exact recipe. I figured there was no point in making it if I changed everything, so I followed the recipe completely. I am so glad I did!! It was delicious!! It made enough for 2+ nights of dinner, and we enjoyed every bite of it!!

I changed a few things based on previous reviews.  I boiled chicken tenders with Adobo seasoning then cooked the yellow rice in the broth while I shredded the chicken tenders.  I sauteed onion, celery and bell pepper then mixed it all together with a can of drained Rotel.  Put it all into a greased 13x9 and topped with shredded mexican blend cheese.  I really think the addition of Rotel makes this dish!

My family and I love this recipe.  I made a few changes to cut down on time but the end result was still a great meal.  Instead of using a whole chicken I diced boneless chicken breasts and used a green zucchini and a yellow squash instead of using a green pepper.

I honestly did not think this was that amazing. It could have been heated together on the stovetop, no need for the Dutch Oven or the casserole dish. If I could make it over again, I would use only breast meat, but that's just a personal preference. Overall, this was just kind of "there" to me -- not great but not bad either.

I didn't really stick to the original recipe, but followed other reviewers advice instead and we thought it was quite tasty. I left out the water chestnuts and pimentos and sauteed celery, onion, green pepper and garlic in oil.  I bought a roasted chicken from Walmart, shredded the meat and added it to the sauteed veggies along with some seasoned salt, pepper, and curry powder.  Then I mixed in a can of Rotel.  Mixed all that together with a pkg. of prepared Mathama yellow rice, topped it with cheese and baked it for 20 minutes. I'll definitely make this again.

Loved this!  Left out the water chestnuts and pimentos, added 1 can rotel and fried up boneless chicken breasts with the green peppers and onions.  Used 2 boxed zatarains yellow rice - easy and delish, just made on the stovetop!  Have made it twice in two weeks now!

This was very good. I don't have a dutch oven so I boiled the chicken with some left over vegetables I needed to use up. After the chicken cooked I let it cool and used the broth from the chicken to cook the yellow rice in. I put the chicken, rice, onions, and green pepper in a casserole dish and baked 15 minutes. ( My husband is picky and those are the only things he would let me put in). It turned out excellent.

We LOVE this recipe.  I used diced boneless/skinless chicken.  I also added a little apple cider vinegar to the cooking chicken and it gave it a little bite that we liked.  I sprinkle cheese over it at the end and my kids love it.

Very, Very Good! I added garlic to the veggies and then made a simple gravy that I added when it came out of the oven. By far, the best chicken and yellow rice ever!

Good recipe, but too much work.  I just boil my chicken, cool, skin, & cut up the meat.  I skim the broth and proceed with the recipe on the back of "Vigo" yellow rice, adding whatever veggie I want(usually some frozen peas) the last 5 minutes.  Vigo brand is out of Tampa, Fl.  It is the most authentic yellow rice, already seasoned. For the liquid called for in the recipe, I just use the skimmed broth from the chicken.

this was delicious!  i didn't care too much for the water chestnuts and it didn't add any flavor to it so i will omit that the next time and i also just seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper because i didn't have any seasoned salt, but it came out great!  if you have the time, i would strongly recommend buying a small chicken (about 4 lbs) and seasoning it yourself instead of the store made chicken like some reviews.

Made this last night and it was a keeper!  I don't care for green bell pepper, so instead I added about 10 ounces of frozen peas, (which, I believe is authentic Cuban) at the end, as the mixture goes back into the oven for 15 minutes.  I also cooked the yellow rice in 1/2 chicken stock and 1/2 water. The crunch of the water chestnuts was a nice touch!

This was excellent.  I didn't have pimentos or water chestnuts and added a can of Rotel as other reviewers suggested.  I also used half a rotisserie chicken.  It was excellent.  Thanks so much.I also added about a tsp of red peppers that gave it a little heat, but not so much that anyone who wasn't overly sensitive to spice would notice.

My family loved this!  I took the advise of another reviewer and used a chicken that was already roasted to make it easy.  My 16 yr old son absolutely loves this recipe.  I have already made it twice and had to double the recipe to make sure there were leftovers!

I made this over the weekend but added one clove of garlic (minced) to the vegetables and then tucked 5 italian sausages around the chicken in the dutch oven.  It was absolutely delicious and I will make it again but will leave out the olive oil because the chicken fat is more than enough as it cooks.

I have made this recipe twice now and love it each time I make it! I do add some shredded cheddar/jack cheese to the casserole. The water chestnuts add a nice crunch and the recipe is super easy! I even brought some to a friend who is pregnant and she loved it too!

I totally cheated on this one.  I used boneless chicken breasts, and cooked them with everything listed until done, then added to them to a Carribean rice mix.  Good quick dinner, but not made exactly as written.  Thanks for the idea though!

This is a very tasty recipe.  I did modify a couple things, however.  I used orange bell pepper instead of green, and I used chicken breasts rather than a whole chicken, it's a little healthier that way.  My entire family enjoyed this, even the picky kids.

This was extremely easy and as good as it was easy! My family is an old fashioned yellow rice & chicken bunch, so they all fussed when I served this one.  HOWEVER, by the time the biscuits came out of the oven, it was almost all gone!  We loved it and will certainly do it again!  Thanks, Di.

This was OK, but kind of on the bland side.  I didn't like the green peppers in it.  It overwhelmed the dish.  Needs more seasoning, but I'm not sure what.  Good place to start and make your own changes to.

Tried this recipe tonite. It was wonderful. This is a great base recipe for many different uses of seasonings and vegetables. To make it easier I did use a rotisserie chicken from Wal-mart. We like spice so I substituted hot rotel for the pimentos. I also added a little sharp shredded cheese on top. Instead of draining the liquid from the rotel I will use it next time.

This is a great dish!   Dh and I had it with hot sauce and the kids ate it as is.  It was a winner with my picky family.  I followed the recommendations of others and use a pre cooked chicken from the market.

Good dish but to labor intensive. I will use boneless, skinless chicken next time.

Loved this dish! Very flavorful and easy to make. Instead of a whole chicken I used 3 large chicken breasts. I substituted a can of tomatoes w/ green chilis for the pimentos per another member's suggestion. I also added a bit of crushed red pepper to the chicken seasoning, and a bit of cajun seasoning to the cooked rice! Not too spicy! :)

This was good.  I was tempted to give it four stars since it was so simple.  I used rotisserie chicken, omitted the green pepper and added Rotel, as many suggested.  I served it with sour cream on the side, which we felt it definitely needed for moisture and taste.  Will serve it next with warmed tortillas.

This was wonderful I made it excatly like the recipe called for except that I skinned the chicken to make it a healthier dish. I also used 1 can of Rotel tomatoes and chilies, drained...and the pimentos too!! It was fabulous. Thanks for the tips.

Even though I modified the recipe to suit my own taste, I still gave the recipe 5 stars because without this recipe and the advice of other reviewers I would not have came up with this idea. I omitted the onion, bell pepper, pimentos and chestnuts. I guess I started with a clean plate. I used two family sized bags of yellow rice. One large can of Rotel diced tomatoes with green chiles and one tablespoon of cayenne pepper. I combined all ingredients, including chicken in a large dutch oven with 8 cups of water(for the uncooked rice)and baked at 375 degrees for about 30-45 minutes. Once done I mixed in a can of sweet peas. Even though I changed the recipe quite a bit, thanks for a great recipe.

We really enjoyed this reciped. It was the 1st time, I cooked with waterchestnuts. I took the advice on the site; used a precooked whole chicken, sauted the veggies with some garlic and added diced tomatoes. Superb! Also after it was baked, mixed in some pickled jalepenos for some added zing. Will definitely make again. Note, think the type of yellow rice you use makes a huge difference. The one we used was Goya Spanish style. It added some great flavor.

This is delicious.  I made it exactly as the recipe stated.  The only thing I will probably change is to use chicken breasts since we prefer white meat.  However, using the whole chicken is cheaper on the budget.

Whatever you do don't leave out the pimentos, it would be pretty bland otherwise.  I think I'll try some of the other suggestions, such as adding the vegies later, they lost most of there flavor cooking with the chicken.  I didn't find it neccesary to heat everything up in the oven, I just added the chicken and vegies to the rice and made sure it was hot enough that way.

Very good with a few alterations. I've made it just as the recipe suggests, but it's pretty time consuming, so this time I did some shortcuts. I slow-grilled chicken breast (to keep chicken moist) in a pan, while 2 (10 oz) packages rice were cooking. Removed chicken from pan to cool then added olive oil, 1 med onion, one green pepper, water chesnuts (all rough chopped) to pan to saute till soft. Shredded chicken, then added pimentos and 1 can diced tomatoes to veggies, sauted for a few more mins. Tossed chicken, veggies and rice togther and voila! Yum! Next time will probably add another can of tomatoes since this recipe could be a little more moist. Also will try to add some curry powder and maybe some crushed chili flakes.

I made a few modifications as per some of the other reviews.  To cut down on the time, I cooked it in one pot on the stovetop.  I cooked the chicken and veggies first, adding a chili pepper and tomato, as well as extra spices to suit our taste.  We like our food spicy.  Once the chicken was cooked through, I added a bit of water to the pot to help cook the rice.  (I used basamti). After about 15 minutes the rice was cooked.

I used shortcuts for this recipe but all-in-all, I loved it.  Instead of the whole chicken, I used some pre-cooked shredded chicken that I had leftover from my crockpot.  Also, I added chopped garlic with the veggies.  For the rice, I used Mahatma Yellow Rice Mix.  Over the top on my portion, I poured some Lizano sauce that I bought in Costa Rico.  My husband liked his plain.  Great Recipe!  We're eating the leftovers tonight.

Just made this dish for dinner tonight.  Overall, it was a good recipe, just not excellent.  My husband and I didn't care for the water chestnuts and thought that it would have been more to our liking w/o them.  We also think that it could have used a little more flavor.  Although my husband laughed at me, I added some sour cream to my portion and liked it a lot.

This recipe was the only chicken-rice casserole I could find that did not have dairy products.  I got ideas from prior reviews and used what I had in the house.  My version had boneless chicken breast, white rice, chopped onion, packaged coleslaw mix, green tomato salsa, cumin, turmeric (to add yellow color), and black pepper.  While the chicken was cooking in the microwave, I cooked the rice with chicken bouillon.  I sauteed the onions, added coleslaw partway through, and then mixed in the salsa and spices.  I combined the chicken, rice, and veggies, and microwaved the casserole for about 4 minutes.  The slaw added a nice crunch (and got my family to eat some fiber).  The recipe will probably be different every time, but it is wonderfully flexible.

I was looking for a chicken and rice recipe that would appeal to my husband's South American family. This fit the bill. It tastes just like the arroz con pollo that my mother-in-law makes.

This was really good!  To keep it simple, I used frozen chopped onions and green peppers.  Although I am not a huge fan of water chestnuts, they added a pleasant texture to the meal.  I do not own a Dutch oven.  Instead, I used a large oval Corning Ware Casserole dish.  Like one of the other reviews suggested, I added a sprinkle of curry along with S & P and Mrs. Dash to season the chicken. I will definitely be making this again, my family loved it too!

I honestly have a difficult time making anything taste good. This recipe is a keeper for me. Like everyone else, I adjusted the recipe a bit. Instead of making the chicken I bought a rotisserie chicken. I cooked the vegetables on the stove top. I followed the directions of making yellow rice but instead of using water I used chicken broth. I did not season the chicken with salt and pepper to taste. I only used seasoning salt. My boyfriend loved the dish. I myself felt it was a bit too salty, but I always complain of that. Next time I will make the yellow rice with half water/half chicken broth.

I made this yesterday, and I was not impressed. I followed the recipe to a tee. However I did add rotel for some zip and I used a roasted chicken. If I make it again which I won't, I wouldn't put the Bell pepper in. It tasted bland except for the kick from the Rotel and strong taste of the bell pepper. It looked and sounded good...but I didn't like it. I used the Vigo rice and added chicken both to it....sorry, but it did nothing to me or my daughter

Very good. We really enjoyed this. I made it pretty much as described however I substituted a yellow pepper for a green and used 2/12 lbs of skinless thighs and breasts instead of a whole chicken.

We love this - we skip the pimentos and the water chestnuts.  We add a little extra chicken broth so its nice and moist.  Our vege is normally steamed broccoli mixed in after dish is prepared.  My kids love this.  Apple sauce and cottage cheese are staples at my house and my little ones love this dish with those accompanying sides.

This dish was so good!  I took the shortcut as another reviewer mentioned.  I bought the costco chicken and softened the vegetables.  Easy and yummy!  Thank you!

This was an easy readily made dinner that we liked.  I did 'cheat' and buy a prepared rotisserie chicken (!) but I liked it so I'll keep it!
