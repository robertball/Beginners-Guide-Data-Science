07.12.17 ~ I thoroughly enjoyed this version of a pancake, although I changed the flour.  I didn't have nor have ever used sorghum flour.  I replaced it with King Arthur'sÂ® AP flour.  The taste is delicious and I loved the burst of tartness from the cranberries.  I'm sure mine netted a heavier pancake because of my flour choice, but the overall taste was delicious.  Thanks Megan, for sharing your recipe.

I made it almost exactly as written and i have to say it was less than wonderful.  My only change was to have dried cranberries instead of frozen and i soaked them overnight.  I think when using sorghum or other non gluten flours, you have to whip the egg whites and add xanthan gum and apple cider vinegar to make it palitable!  Also should vary the sorghum with another gluten free flour such as rice or corn or millet.
