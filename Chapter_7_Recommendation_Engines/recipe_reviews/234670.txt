It's nice, light and fresh. Really easy and quick. I didn't make any changes to it, but I think I will take Heather's suggestions next time.

Liked it as written, but loved it after adding 2 extra avocados, A 7 ounce can of green chilies, salt, pepper, Cumin and a little chili powder. Kicked it up a notch and made it more guacamole like!! Brought it to work with fresh tortilla chips and it was devoured!!

Great!  Refreshing!  I used 1/2 can diced tomatoes and 1 mild hatch green chile from the can (gluten free).

I didn't put jalapeno peppers in it, and didn't have any limes or lime juice. I put  lemon juice in instead. It was great! Even my husband, who is picky when it comes to quinoa liked it a lot. I am saving this one as a favorite, and will make it again.

Loved it, make this all the time and the entire family loves it! Although of course as I always do I make my own variation. I add corn kernels and chickpeas browned in olive oil for extra vegetarian healthfulness ;) it's delicious

Made this for Pinterest Faceless Frenzy Nov'13. It was awesome! Even if you aren't an avocado lover and you wanted to leave it out this would still be good. I made it in the morning and let sit in the fridge all day minus the avocado which I added right before serving. I thought it needed an extra squirt of lime prior to serving because the lime flavour really mellowed through the day. I served this as a side to fish tacos but it is worthy of accompanying any main. Thank you Mom2Bell&Bubba. This is a keeper!
