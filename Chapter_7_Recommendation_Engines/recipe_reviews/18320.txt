I made these last night for dinner, and while you do have to think ahead a bit (perhaps an hour ahead isn't a lot for most people, but I'm much more of a "I'm hungry NOW, must eat" kind of chick), they were quite good.  I skipped on the cheese and instead topped them with sour cream just before eating.  will definitely make these again :)

These were great!  Of course I tweeked them.  I was in the mood for au grautin potatoes but, I didn't need the leftovers.  So, here's what I did.  Sliced the potatoes width wise, cut the onion in half and sliced thinly.  Place potato on foil, put a piece of onion between each slice, then a piece of cheese between each slice ( I used colby & sharp cheddar), then sprinkled with pepper and salt.  I then took cream of mushroom soup and spooned in down the length of the potato, poured 1/4 cup of milk over the potatoe and topped it with some slices of butter - Yes I know it is high caleries!! But it was wonderful comfort food and no leftovers. This made a nice cheese sauce to dip the potato slices in.  Very tasty.  If you are worried about sticking use pam on the foil first.

This is a great way to bake potatoes, however, I thought they needed more flavor.  Plus the cheese stuck to the foil.  When I make them again, I will add ranch dressing and salt, and maybe not use the cheese.

Method is fantastic; flavor needs work. I jazzed it up a little by using, instead of butter, herbed olive oil. Wow did this create an amazing smell and some delicious flavor. Next time, however, I'd also use broth instead of water, and reduce the amount of liquid to 2-3 tablespoons instead of 1/4 cup per package. Definitely a method worth playing with. Fingerling potatoes work just as well as potato slices.

Very good recipe for company.  I used parchment paper rather than foil so the cooking time was shorter.  Guests loved it! Nice presentation, too.  Bring the whole parchment packet to the table.

I love these. I season the potatoes and onions with salt and pepper and use grated cheese instead of cheese slices. They are sooo good. It seems that if you have enough moisture in the packet that there isn't a real problem with the cheese sticking to the foil.

I think this will be a great recipe for campouts with the Scouts.

This was very good.  I cooked it on the bbq and it came out real tender.  I think I had it too close to the heat though, the bottoms of some of them burned.  So next time I will put it on the top rack of the bbq and only on medium (my grill doesn't have a temp gauge).  Next time also I will use less onions on the kids packets since they thought it was too strong a flavor.

My parents use this same recipe, minus the cheese, on the grill.  The potatoes get nice and crispy that way. Yummy!

very good! the water softened up the potatoes perfectly. I did leave the cheese out until they were done but will make again and again!

These were a fun snack! I incorporated tips from previous reviews ~thank you~ and I am sure this enhanced the recipe. Also, I used release foil so I didn't have problems sticking. Thanks.

I generously sprinkled these with seasoned salt and pepper before wrapping them in foil for more flavor. I also added the cheese after they came out of the oven because they stuck to the foil before. There's plenty of heat to still melt the cheese that way.

I added chicken broth instead of water, used less onion, added garlic powder, parsley and fresh ground pepper.

I added minced garlic and bacon bits to it and everyone loved it!
