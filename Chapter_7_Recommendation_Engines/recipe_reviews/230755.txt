Absolutely delicious, fast and easy.  These are ingredients I have on hand at all times, which makes this a keeper in my book.

I loved the way these turned out!  They made a very appealing presentation..so cute! I layered some of the strawberries into the middle after reading the cooks helpful notes. Easy to make and tasted great too.

This was a very tasty dessert, but it was much more the taste and consistency of gooey marshmallow cream cheese frosting or really thick pudding.  I'll probably make it again, but not cheesy or cakey enough for me to call it cheesecake.

I used this recipe to serve 108 - let me  say this - it doesn't  calculate out well at all.  Not nearly enough of the cheesecake filling - I didn't skimp anywhere. I had to fill up the jars with whipping cream.  The Cheesecake filling is really very nice, but I would recommend doubling or tripling the fruit and/or double or triple the crumb quotient.  Keep the cheesecake part as is because it's very rich.

I was very dissatisfied with this.  The only reason it gets two stars is because it is very fast to make. The cheesecake to Graham cracker  is off.  I had a considerable amount of  Graham cracker left after.  The cheese cake itself was very dull and not very tasty. I will most likely not be making this again.

I think this should be prepared in 1 pint jars or quart jars, not 1/2 pint. The ratio of ingredients to taste is off. Too much cream cheese. Not really that flavorful. I tried it once, wont't try it again.

Yes I tried this recipe but I did not put sugar in graham crust and it taste just fine. I also cut the sugar in the cheesecake. It was yummy and easy to make. Thank you.
