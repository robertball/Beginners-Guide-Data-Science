So quick and delicious! I made my own dough and it fit the entire pan so I used the 12" pizza setting. I added a couple extra minutes because we like the cheese to be nice and golden brown. I was a little skeptical about putting the chicken on this raw, but it actually worked out really well and making it this way prevents the chicken from getting over cooked! I had a picture of it, but I think my toddler erased it when he was playing with my phone, haha! We will make this again trying different flavor combinations. Thanks for the recipe!

This turned out great! I'm vegetarian so I made it without the meat but I would definitely make this again. Editing to add that I've now made this pizza 3 times because we love it so much!
