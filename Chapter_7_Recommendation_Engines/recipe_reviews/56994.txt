This recipe is WONDERFUL! We tried it with boneless pork roast and cooked it to 160. Since it was boneless, it took even less time than the posted receipe! We shared 20 pounds of the cooked meat, served with garlic mashed potatoes, mixed vegetables and cresesnt rolls to 36 of our fellow VFW and American Legion members for a recent K.C. Chiefs' football game! Many responses were "the best pork roast they have ever had...." "Wonderful" nd "Succulent" is VERY understated! It was the talk of the weekend and past week! Many have requested the receipe from us. The cherries really add to the flavor and color of the roast! SO VERY EASY! YUMMY!

I used these same ingredients and cooked a frozen roast in a slow cooker all day on "low" (minus the roasting bag). It was a hit with the whole family! Thank you.

I utilized the basic idea of this recipe but instead of cherries..but used a large can of whole apricots with juice, mixed in brown sugar, honey, garlic pepper, minced garlic, and a few squirts of spicy mustard and mashed it all together for the glaze...turned out WONDERFUL and definately full of flavor!!!!! can add even more spice if desired...also, I stuffed it with minced garlic as it spreads the flavor better than the cloves....

This was a very good roast.  I tried it because i had a pork roast to use up.  I'm not normally a big pork fan but this one was definitely good.  If ever i have to make pork roast again, I know which recipe to use.  My husband loved it.

I just made this awhile ago. It is truly succulent as the name implies! The meat is so tender and juicy and the sauce from the cherries and meat is exquisite. It's not overly salty, which is good, and that's probably why a couple reviewers said it is bland. I disagree and find it delicious, and would fix it again. The better half said, "Good meal!" That's good enough for me!

This recipe was quite bland. I found the cherrys to be an interesting choice of ingedients, but was expecting a much more savory dish. The roast did come out very moist and tender, but did not have much taste.

Love this recipe!! I had a 2 1/2 pund roast so cut the roasting time down to 1 1/2 hours and it was just right. I didn't have any cherries on hand so used Mandarin oranges and orange marmalade in place of the cherries. I added 1 T + 1 tsp of marmalade to the can of Mandarin Oranges and it was wonderful. The pork was fork tender and so juicy! I have stocked my larder with cherries so that I can use the exact recipe the next time we have pork. Thank you for sharing this recipe which is now a family favorite in my house.

This was my first attempt at a bone-in pork roast.  It was so simple to prepare and my husband loved it.  I only had a half a jar of cherries so I added a little extra water and I didn't have a roasting bag so I cooked it in covered Pyrex.  I used the drippings to make gravy and it came out excellent.  Now I just have to learn how to carve one of these roasts!

My picky 6-year-old ate until her stomache hurt --- literally !!!  I didn't have any cherries so I used a can of mandarin oranges.  I also threw in some potatoes and carrots in the bag.  The veggies soaked up the juice and were very flavorful.  The whole family loved it.  I love how easy it is to make!  I'll definitely make it again, maybe experiment with other fruits like peaches or plums.

This was really good. I make the same think with pork roasts - either sauerkraut or pulled pork. So this was a nice change.  The whole family enjoyed it. I did substitute a can of pitted sweet dark cherries for the maraschino cherries (didn't have those on hand). The dark reds lent a very deep flavor to the roast. I did salt my roast lightly before hand.  Will make again.

The pork cooked great and was moist but it had no flavor at all. I followed the recipe and didn't add anything to it. Needs more taste.

Family thought this wasn't going to be good with cherries.  They were wrong and all loved it.  I will definitely make this again.  next time I might season it just a bit more.  I reserved the liquid and separated the fat off, made a great addition to the meat.

This recipes is awesome. Your pork will come out really tender, it almost fell apart. It tastes amazing, even if you don't like pork, you'll probably like this. And it presents very well. I didn't have a bag, so I cooked it with aluminum foil covering it. I did it with a boneless pork roast and cooked it in about 2 hours. Very good recipe. I definitely recommend it.

This recipe is definitely a keeper!  I have cooked this twice in the last two weeks and enjoyed it both times!  I made it over the weekend for about 20 guests for a Father's Day Lunch and everyone raved.    Very flavorful and juicy.  I am not even a fan of the maraschino cherries, but I love love love this recipe.

This was a great recipe, made it as directed.  A bit on the greasy side, but a crowd pleaser and nice diversion from the same old pork roast.

I found this to be very bland.  It sounded so interesting but we were very disappointed. I even marinated it over night yet found nothing tasty about it at all.

Here's a thought for "AHERDOFUS". Try inserting the garlic halfs into the roast. This recipe ROCKS! My family loved it, and they are very picky eaters.

This is the BEST PORK EVER. I have made it twice and can't rave enough about it. I served it to my parents and sister and they went on and on about how amazing it was. It is so moist and tender and flavourful. The only change I made was to add about 1/3 of a cup of concentrated hot wassail (which was sitting on the back of the stove) to the drippings to make the gravy and it was incredible. The sweetness of the apple cider with the saltiness of the pork and the cherry juice..... Mmmmmmmm.

The flavors just didn't work for our family of 4.  The kids tried to salvage it with BBQ sauce.  The cherries just tasted weird cooked so we picked them all off.

I've never been able to make a decent tasting/succulent pork roast.  OMG!  It came out so perfect, tender, very tasty and NOT DRY!  I didn't have the cherries...I figure any time you make this, you can season this however you like, but I used about 3 oz. of Merlot wine that I had sitting around from the night before.  Seriously, it was excellent and my hubby even commented on it!  I will be making this again!

This roast was dissappointing.  It was tender and moist which is why I gave it 3 stars...but it had no taste and I had to end up throwing BBQ sauce on the leftovers to get anyone to eat it.  Will not try again.
