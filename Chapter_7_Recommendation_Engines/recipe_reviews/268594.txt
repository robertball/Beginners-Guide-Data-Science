This recipe adds so much flavor and dresses up the kale that you will smell as if you are cooking a five star meal at a fancy restaurant when you are in the proximity of your own home.

I made this as  listed except I used brown lentils as that's what I had on hand.  We ate it without the sour cream the first night and I didn't like it nearly as well as when we added a Tablespoon plus a little more cayenne pepper when serving.  Also, it just gets more delicious the next day anyway.  I can see that this is a very versatile recipe.
