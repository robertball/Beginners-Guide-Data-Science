Simple enough. I did add 1/4 teaspoon of cream of tartar just to make it would be stable enough to sit out in the warm weather.

I made it just like the recipe but I did add just a pinch of tartar and it is amazing. So light and creamy. my favorite frosting by far. Thank you for sharing.

I am a fan. I made it exactly like the recipe and have no complaints. I'd been searching for a super easy light frosting for vanilla bean cupcakes that wasn't buttercream because I am NOT a fan. I have done a similar frosting using cream cheese but didn't need that much and I didn't want to wait for cream cheese to soften.  I do use a ninja blender to whip the heavy cream it takes about a minute to get the right stiff peak consistency.

Really good; lighter than buttercream, but tastes better than whipped icing. Also taste to make sure it is sweet enough while it's mixing.

Made exactly from recipe, was much too ‘cream-y’ and the cream just coats your mouth. “Frosting” term is loosely used.
