This was the first time I made yorkshire pudding.  I was always afraid to atempt it because my friend said that it was so hard and a pain to make.  This was wonderful and so easy.  I did make a change though, I wanted to use beef drippings and didnt have any.  So I first melted 4Tbsp  shortening and 1tsp of beef soup base (powder) in the microwave.  Then I put that mixture in the muffin tins instead of margerine.  It gave them the wonderful flavor of using traditional beef drippings!  Thanks for the reciepe.  My family loved them.

This recipe was definitely quick and easy. The only thing my boyfriend and I found wrong with the finished product was the very dominant taste of egg. Other than that, a great recipe.

This recipe is fantastic!! I do not like eggs and these puddings are not eggy at all (imo). They are light and fluffy and did not fall when taken out of the oven. I have tried dozens of recipes in the past 2 years and this one is by far the best.

This recipe is quick and easy, but has the wrong temp.  You have to have the oven HOT for the first 5 to 10 minutes to get the Yorkshire to pop, then lower it.  Will try again using a higher temp.

I'm so happy with this recipe. When I lived in England I could make perfect yourkshire puddings. Due to the altitude change in Canada I've had no success in 8 years, trying countless variations of yorkshire pud recipies, until I tried this one. Thank you for sharing this recipe, it makes perfect yorkshires.

Want nice golden brown and fluffy Yorkshire puddings? Did you find that this recipe left you with deflated puddings?   The fix is simple... DO NOT DROP THE TEMP FROM 375!!! Leave the temp at 375 and pull them out when they are nice and golden brown. 

Not only will they be puffier, they will have an exterior which holds it's shape.

Very good recipe. Something that should be considered is to let your eggs come to room temperature before making. When cooking the yorkshire will rise and puff higher.

Amazingly yummy!  My dad says they are just as good or better than his moms :)  Because of a dairy allergy I use rice milk in these and you can't tell at all. These have a place in my permanent cookbook, and I will be giving my own kids this recipe when they move out!

I tried this recipe with all my fingers crossed as I was serving them to 3 critical Brits, it turned out wonderfully, they all said they were fantastic! The only thing I changed at the suggestion of one of my guests was to increase the oven temp so I did them at 425 which was perfect! This is my go to for Yorkies now!

I was recently at a social where I met the chef from one of Canada's top restaurants. He suggested for the best Yorkshire pudding, fill each cup half way with a 50/50 mix of clarified butter (Ghee) and vegetable oil. The result was out of this world.

Did not change a thing on this recipe and they came out perfect.  The key is to get them out when they are still relatively standing tall, otherwise expect them to drop back into the tin.  This was quick and easy and everyone enjoyed them.

These turned out wonderfully for our Christmas dinner today. Thank you!  I have read some of the negative reviews and can only assume those people have not tried yorkshire pudding before - they are supposed to be golden and crispy on the outside and somewhat moist and eggy on the inside, with an empty space in the centre to pour in the gravy.   So yorkshire pudding newbies, consider yourself warned -- yorkshire puddings taste eggy!

I give it 4 star because it's has a great taste.  The temperature isn't entirely correct though.  I did this recipe 3 times.  First time I follow it exactly, 375 for 5 minutes and 350 for the rest.  It gives a pretty good Yorkshire pudding but it's not rising like I wanted it to.  I figure the initial temperature wasn't high enough for the egg to do its rising magic.  The second time I did it at 450 and was wayyy too hot and it's like a puck.  The 3rd, I did the initial 5 minutes at 400 and turn it down to 350 and it was a success!  Yummy, fluffy and with that hole on top for the gravy.  I'm loving it!

To make this taste like traditional English yorkshire pudding you need to add about 1/2 tsp of salt.  Other than that, this recipe is spot on.

My husband is English. I have never attempted Yorkshire puds out of sheer fear that they would not even come close to those made by my darling mother-in-law. Well, hello Yorkshires! So fluffy, so gorgeous, I thought my husband was going to cry when he saw them, and pass out when he ate one. He ate one straight from the tin, couldn't wait for me to make the gravy. One thing I did learn from her is that you don't ever open the oven until they're timed to be done, so perhaps that will help those having trouble. Anyway, this recipe should be bronzed for prosperity. Thank you!!

This was really good.  Not too eggy and the tip about cooking it at 450 for 10 min first was good.  They puffed up perfectly.  Absolutely the best

Not only the best yorkshire pudding I have ever made, but I made them for a friend from the UK who said they were the best he'd ever had.  Every time I make them for company they get rave reviews.  A definite winner!

The title says it all! Quick & Easy! So buttery and delicious. The only thing was it did take more then 25 minutes to cook. Maybe it was my oven but it took closer to 40-45 minutes. Kept a close eye on it since it was my first time making it. Thank you for sharing this recipe. Definitely a keeper!

Great, simple recipe. I put half in the oven following the directions, lowering the temp after 5 min. Then later with the other half of the batter I left the temp at 375 the whole time. Both batches were good, but they cooked up better left at the higher temp. I liked the little bit of brown crispness on the edges. Also the 2nd batch, I didn't add butter but sprayed with Pam. That worked fine, too, just be sure to spray generously. I sprinkled in a little salt.
Update 11/26/15 - made these again without salt, next time I will go back to adding a small amount of salt.

Turned out great.  Wish it would have come out of the muffin pans easier, though.

I made it exactly as directed and they turned out amazing. I had to cook them about four extra minutes to get them nicely browned.  So easy my kids are making them on Christmas! (13 & 15 years old)

The greatest I've ever tried and easy!!!!
Everyone loved them  at the Christmas table, they were nice and light with no fuss to make. I don't usually try new recipes on special occasions but I'm glad I did.

Very much like the "German Pancakes II" on this site, but smaller. They are very easy to make and come out light & fluffy. I made 1/2 recipe with 1 egg, 1/2 C milk and 1/2 C flour. My daughter makes this frequently and says you can make them sweet or savory. She uses beef drippings instead of butter and puts some finely chopped onion in the batter. I prefer the sweet ones and sprinkle them with a little lemon juice and then some powdered sugar. I guess there are a lot of possibilities with this recipe.

I substitute the flour with "all purpose Gluten free flour" and milk with "rice milk"! Loved the result although it didn't turn as fluffy as the original recipe :)

Just made this recipe last night & they were a thing of beauty!! I, 1 nd 1/2ed this recipe. I didn't have enough oven space for my roast potatoes and broccoli casserole so it ended up, my 6 muffin pan yorkshires were ready when it said, but the other 12 flopped as soon as they came out of the oven, as they weren't quite done yet. I thought to myself, oh well, let's see what will happen if I put them back in...and they rose again and cooked to a puffy perfection! AMAZING! Normally you can't open the oven or anything with yorkshires...LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe! Thank you for making my Mum's 77th Birthday dinner perfect! Everyone was raving! xoxo

Exactly what I was looking for. One note: I always dribble some drippings in the muffin cup and heat those to sizzling befor I ladle the batter in. They come out beautifully every time.

Hello... I am not exactly from the UK but I made these at home and I think these were amazing in every essence! They turned out very fluffy and didn't taste too eggy at all. My only issue with these was the fact that there was tidbits of black burnt food at the bottom of our oven and they started glowing halfway through the preheating process so I had to wait for quite some time to remove all the tidbits of burnt food (which was not easy). These were wonderful to make and eat and I have yet to see if my family agrees. It is simply something I can make anytime I feel like; they are extremely easy to make. I thank you for posting this recipe on this website.

loved it! I've heard of Yorkshire pudding before but never really knew quite what it was. This recipe is so easy and I can envision so many uses for it. Two (or so) of these in the bottom of a bowl of chili, or with any kind stew, etc. I've added a pinch of salt and a dollop of maple syrup to each muffin tin and they were delicious with breakfast! this is a good, easy and versatile recipe...thanks for sharing!!

I'd never had Yorkshire pudding before, and this was a very simple recipe for a first-time effort.  It surprised me how much it tasted like the pastry part of a cream puff.  I thought they were just fine, but my husband went crazy for them.  I would suggest spraying the muffin tins with non-stick spray before adding the butter.

Never having tasted yorkhire pudding, I have to say this tastes like egg. Maybe I will play around with it once more and add some beef broth instead of milk or substitute half milk, half broth to give it a better flavor. Thank you for sharing this.

Maybe it's because I have never had yorkshire pudding before and I did not know what to expect, but I did not care for it. I'm sure this recipe was perfect for what I was making, but I guess I just do not like yorkshire pudding. I only made it for my daughter's school project, but because it was so fluffy and beautiful in presentation I tried it. The teacher said they were wonderful, but I thought different. I read on here that they were not eggy at all. Ha - I thought they tasted just like fluffy egg with no seasoning. Very eggy to me and I love egg. I will make this again I'm sure when my other two daughters have to make it for school, but not as a dish for our eating.

SOO, I'm British. Very English, & me wonderful man asks politely " Please make Yorkshire Pudding  this year for Christmas with your amazing Prime Rib" .  I answered " Of course dear. With pleasure" . Little did he know I had NEVER made them before. Not every Brit goes about making Yorkshire Poo. But do I tell him this?  NEVER! I'm too bloody frightened, to think straight, but those muffin tins came out, & I got to work, shaking with dread.  IT WORKED! THIS RECIPE WORKED! watching them puff up , was one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen. I told me sweety bear , " Come here. Watch this! " we watched in amazement, & they came out Perfect! AHHS & Smacking of lips was involved, & it was simple! Use this recipe. Follow it. Call your mates over, to watch the splender of it all, & after I told Me Sweety bear that it was the very 1st time I had made them.  he was impressed.  Needless to say, he ate them, guests ate them. Guess who didn't get even a taste. ME!  Now I have to remake them.  No problem. Now as a proud Brit, I can say " Bloody "ELL YES. I MAKE ROASTS & YORKSHIRE POODINGS.  Cheers & Happy 2018, all you foodies.

I tried this recipe before but I over-heated the butter and it turned into an unattractive brown colour.  I used the butter just the same and my Yorkshire puddings were still tasty.  Making this again tonight and will pay more attention to the butter.  Also, I keep it at 375 degrees for the whole baking time.

Best, best, best, best, BEST!!!!  

I have failed too many times while trying to make Yorkshire Pudding for my English husband and stepson.  They are very gracious and tell me the Yorkshire pudding taste is good, or some such passable compliment.  BUT... this recipe works!!  

Next time I will add 1/2 tsp salt to the batter.  

THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!!!

My boyfriend has been saying for a month that he really wanted a roast beef dinner with yorkshire pudding.  Last night I surprised him with these and he was thrilled.  They were so easy to make and turned out great!!

Made these tonight with roast been and gravy. These were excellent. I think one of the better tasting yorkshire pudding I have eaten. Someone said these were heavy...we didn't find these heavy at all. In fact thought they were light and delightful. Will sure make these again next time I make roast. thanks for the recipe!!!

Delish & loved by all! :) I made one giant Yorkshire in a round baking pan to get that nice spongy bit in the middle surrounded by a crispy outer edge. I added 1.5tbsp oil to the pan, and put it into the oven for about 5 minutes. Then I took the pan out, poured the Yorkshire mix in, kept it at 375F and let it bake for about 35min. (I checked on it after 25 min, then let it continue to bake in the oven for another 10 until the outer edge was nice and golden.)

I followed the advice in some of the comments (which echoes other recipes I've seen) and had the oven as hot as possible for the first 10 minutes. I also added some salt. They turned out very well!

I thought the recipe was very easy and turned out the way I remember my mom making them! Good trick is to make sure everything is a room temp and leave on counter to rest for half hour or so to give everything a chance to rest... FANTASTIC RECIPE!

So good and so simple!  I think next time I'll add a touch of salt, if the accompanying gravy isn't laced with it.

These turned out wonderful!  I followed the exact recipe and didn't have any problems with rising or browning.  I didn't notice them tasting too egg-y either.  All of our guests loved the authentic touch added to our Christmas prime rib dinner.  Will make again next year!

I make yorkshire pudding every time I make a beef roast. I have tried many different recipies with varying results. This recipie was simple yet turned out to be the best one yet. Everyone at my Christmas dinner raved about them and there were no leftovers. I did use 4 Tablespoons of crisco mixed with 1 teaspoon of powdered brown gravy mix. Next time I think I will try saving some bacon fat just for another layer of flavor and I will up the gravy mix to 1 tablespoon.

This is the first time I have ever made this recipe and it turned out perfectly, (cooking time in my oven was shorter). If you wind up with leftovers, re-heat them the next day and add a little butter, a sprinkle cinnamon and drizzle with maple syrup, delicious!

I've never had yorkshire pudding before, and this was my first attempt at making them. I used one less egg than the recipe says and they turned out great! They puffed up great and I thought they tasted like fried scones so I dusted them with powedered sugar and ate them with honey butter. YUM :)

they were good but a little bland. even with gravy something was missing. so in one batch i made them with oil and a little bit of garlic in the muffin tin instead of butter and those were great.

Perfect just like my Scottish mother use to make, but she did do as a reviewer said instead of butter added the beef fat rendering to bottom of pan, oh yea she made it in a 9x13 pan also, not muffins, not as presentible but just as tasty, for 12 kids eating who cared..lol  Great recipe

This recipe is very easy and the results are fantastic.  I made this for my family and they were very impressed.  I made sure all my ingredients were room temperature before I started, and I had no problems.  The flavour was perfect as well.

Being a yorkshire girl I should have been making these since birth but this was actually my first attempt and although they weren't as good as my mum's they weren't far off. Extremely easy to make and olive oil also works as a substitue for butter when I realised I didn't have any!

I have made these quite a few times now and will stick with these with just a few changes.... I add a little salt and pepper and a tsp of tarragon for extra flavour. Make sure you set the batter aside for at least half an hour before using. They also take a little longer to cook in my oven. I use the freshest eggs from my own chickens - the pudding glows bright yellow but it is very tasty! This is a great yorkshire pudding mix for making toad in the hole - yummy!

This came out beautifully!  By far the best recipe for popovers that I have tried ("real" Yorkshire pudding would use the beef fat from the roast you were making just ahead of the Yorkshire pudding, not butter), but I am giving this 4 stars instead of five because you need to add some salt.  I generally use unsalted butter so I have the ability to control the level of salt in a recipe, so I would add at least 1/4 tsp. of salt to the batter next time and work my way up if that is not enough.  Also, I agree with another reviewer that it helps to have the eggs at room temperature.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is unbelievable! I have tried so many recipes for this which either didn’t work or I ended up with a burnt ‘block’ of inedible mixture. This rose perfectly, was golden brown and tasted scrumptious! I highly recommend this to anyone who wants a simple recipe which works.

The only change I made was to add a little sea/rock salt and used beef & mutton dripping instead of butter. If you want a decadent treat, serve them on their own with a drizzle of maple syrup!

A good base recipe but you really need a higher heat to get them to "pop". Use pan drippings when they are available. If using butter, definitely add salt to the batter. I use a 400 degrees F oven or hotter. Pull them out when they're brown, cook time will be shorter.

Loved this recipe.  I pre-heat the milk before mixing in the eggs and flour and it turns out even more puffy.  I have tried for years to make yorkshire pudding but now found a successful recipe -  thankyou

Have made these many times. Never have any left overs. If I run out if time I don't refrigerate the batter, but they still turn out beautiful. They are buttery, crunchy on the outside and soft inside. A wonderful add on to any meal.

Finally I can make yorkshire again. It's been many years...I think the eggs have gotten smaller so 3 is a must. I've used both a muffin tin and a popover pan, the popover pan helps them rise a bit more. I love the butter, gives them a nice flavour and I find that the lower temp works out just fine...my old recipe called for 450 so I thought this couldn't work...but it does. My oven, like most new ones has even bake, so to get around this I use a cookie sheet on the top rack to deflect the heat so the yorkshires don't cook too much on top before they can start their rise.
Update: Made them a while back...forgot to deflect...they turned out like muffins. Made them on Sunday, remembered to deflect...ah...they were a thing of beauty...tall and tender. This is a 10star recipe!

I needed to make 150 of these for a Christmas party. They all turned out perfect. Well, I thought they were perfect. I had never made, nor eaten a yorkshire pudding before this, so I'm not sure how they compare to anything else. But they were fluffy, crispy, and "custardy" all at the same time. Yum! I used the drippings from a roast instead of butter for half of them. The other half I mixed beef bouillon and vegetable oil (1/4 tsp. bouillon to every 2T oil)and used that instead. Both ways worked great. I will definitely make these again!

AMAZING!  however temp is wrong, it has to go in at 375 for 10 minutes not 5, and then lower to 350.  I also cooked for an additional 5 min (10 min on 375 and 30 min on 350) and it turned out PERFECT!

This is the first time I have made these myself, successfully - excellent recipe.  I was forced to make one adjustment however, I burnt the butter (my fault) - and having run out used Olive Oil instead, they still came out beautifully - but I imagine they would taste even better done in butter.

Since my wife has a gluten intolerance, I made a GF version, which unfortunately, didn't puff up like a normal Yorkshire would.

Never the less, my wife loved it, even if it was more like a muffin, so thank you for the recipe

I'm no Yorkshire Pudding connoisseur, but I didn't think too much of these and my kids didn't like them much either. Their complaint: too eggy. I may well be a good recipe and that we just don't happen to like Yorkshire Pudding.

This was delish! Just like my friend's mom (from England) makes! Got rave reviews from my family and even the picky 2 year old ate it all! I didn't have time for roast beef, so I used some leftover shredded chicken and made a chicken gravy (shredded chicken, salt, pepper, butter, flour, and chicken broth) to go with it. Everyone loved it!

I haven't made these before, so I converted the recipe to make 10. My oven melted the butter within 30 seconds and they rose pretty fast, like within 3 minutes, so I turned it down to 335 after a few minutes. They were delicious, buttery and fluffy.. loved it, thanks xx

Not bad. Not as fluffy as I like but very good. I added a small piece of panchetta to individual muffin cups with the oil to give them more flavorful.

Same as Lucy's recipe. Add a little bit of salt as they were a little eggy. Top with roast beef and a little horseradish. Epicurious recipe uses 2 eggs, everything else the same. Let batter sit for an hour. Put beef drippings, in put in 450 degree oven to heat. Pour in batter and cook for 10 minutes, turn down to 350 and cook another 15 to 20. This is for an 11x7 pan. Turn down times for muffin pan.

I questioned whether a recipe this easy could make the yorkshire pudding like I remember from my childhood. My fears were unfounded, these are AMAZING! They puffed right up, and taste awesome. I highly recommend these!

Easy and delicious, good recipe.  I find the trick to good Yorkshires is that the batter needs to be at room temperature. Since I don't plan far enough ahead, I nuke the milk for 30-40 seconds before adding it to the other ingredients. This takes the chill off and makes it rise much better.

always been afraid to make Yorkshire Pudding.  Not this way,  they were wonderful.  Family gobbled them up, super easy to make.   **have a friend in UK  she said to add 2 tsp. of stuffing mix to this recipe.  LOL her hubby a chef and argued that only 1 tsp was necessary. I went with Carol and it was a nice addition.  Try it out... quite nice addition

This recipe was flavourless (unless you count the egg flavour), and the bottom remained flat and mushy that cooled down and became solid. i ate around the mushy stuff and discarded the remaining puffs.

Definitely a winner.  I crave YP for breakfast sometimes, and don't have drippings available.  A little garlic and salt in the butter is just the thing.  I also put a pinch of salt in the batter itself.  This was not overly eggy, at all.  This recipe is light, crispy, custardy, everything a good pud should be.  I'm glad I misplaced my old recipe, and had to come here and find this one!  Serendipity!

These puffed up way over my muffin tins!  They were crisp and flaky on the outside, with a soft layer inside, and completely hollow in the middle!  Yummy with jam inside! Ours did turn out a bit "eggy" tasting- I will try these again with freshly bought eggs, and see if that affects the flavor.  It wasn't a bad flavor, but from the reviews, I got the impression that these aren't supposed to taste like egg??

I've always loved Yorkie Puds but been too warey of my mum's disasterous attempts at making them to give them a go myself.  This recipe worked first time for me.. tasted great and using butter instead of dripping makes it a vegetarians dream!  Thanks X

They turned out so well I made two batches and they are all gone! This was my first time making yorkshire pudding too and I was a bit nervous. This recipe was so easy I am going to make them more often. I used vegetable oil instead of butter and they still were awesome. (My mother-in-law told me she liked them better than her sister's).

I usually use my aunts recipe Which call for 6 eggs and 3/4 cups milk and they are much lighter.

These were excellent. Only, being a vegetarian, I did not know what to eat it with. Tastes great with jam. Mine rose 4" above the cup and did not deflate much. Thanks a lot.

Holy cow! Was this one easy! If you love popovers this is an excellent recipe. Really quick & easy. I cut the recipe in half and use a popover tin of 6. At first I didn't think they were going to rise, but a little bit of patience and "voila" . . . there they were!

I served these yorkshires with the Slow cooker roast beef recipe submitted by Tracey and it was all great.  

I altered this recipe only slightly.  Instead of just using butter in the muffin tins,  I used about half the amount of better that was called for and then top it up with some of the juices form the slow-ccoked roast beef.  They were really easy and super tasty.

These were very quick and easy.  They weren't quite the best I've had.  There was just a little something missing in the flavour, perhaps just the pan drippings.  They were certainly thick & fluffy.  Came out golden brown and soaked up lots of gravy.  Very good easy recipe.

Mine didn't rise at all. When I googled causes, I found suggestions that the oven temp needs to be about 100 degrees warmer. I live at an altitude of 6000 feet, does that matter? So disappointed. Any suggestions. I don't really want tasty hockey pucks.

I followed the recipe exactly. I might add salt next time.  Very easy and delish! My husband cooked a prime rib roast. There wasn't much drippings, so I put some butter in the muffin tins to make up the difference. I did have some room temp eggs, I beat the batter with the whisk attachment. I only let the batter sit for about 15 min. All but 2 rose well, the ones that stayed flat were crisp and still flavorful. We both are way too many! I honestly didn't know how to eat these. I put sour cream or some and butter on some. Very good!

Thanks for the recipe.

This turned out excellent.  I cooked at 400 degrees for 5 minutes then reduced to 375 for remainder of cooking (about 20 more minutes). I added some salt as others suggested and I'm glad I did.  Next time I'll spray the tins a little heavier with nonstick spray.

My husband rated these little puddings a 4.  To me they were a little heavy  I would give them a 3.  I made them in the plastic muffin tin liners and they rose .   I have never baked YP at this temperature, usuallly a little hotter.  Still delicious, and a necessary addition to a roast beef dinner.

My only changes were a hotter oven, 450F.
I also added a little oil to the tins instead of butter. A little salt and pepper to the mixture and baked for about 20 minutes until golden brown. They were delicious and this is now my go to recipe. Thank you

A good simple recipe.  I doubled the recipe to produce 24 puddings for a large family dinner.  They were devoured in under 15 minutes so I guess you could say they were appreciated.

Better to reduce the milk and leave the batter to stand for a few hrs. Just before pouring the batter into the tins add water to make up the milk removed. Beat well and pour into tins.
I always make Yorkshires when eating Roast Beef.

Super easy and I decided I wanted to add my toppings before it baked so they would be nice and hot. I knew I would get less rise, but liked the idea of the flavors baked in. They were wonderful. I had leftover bacon, some diced onion and about 1/5 of a bag of shredded cheese in my fridge. I mixed them together and diced them fine. Once I had the batter ladled in the cups I sprinkled the mixture in the middle of each.

Other times I have made this I used oil instead of butter, and they turned out fluffy and huge. 
I used this recipe because I was in a rush, no hate at all towards the person who wrote this.
The butter does not work for us, it made them flat and small. 
All the ingredients were right, we did it all in order. 
I would recommend using oil rather than butter. 
This may work for you but it didn’t work for us :) 
They still tasted AMAZINNNG. 
I will continue to use this recipe for my smaller batches, I will just use oil instead of butter. Thank you.

I can't believe so many people reviews these as being something to butter or pour gravy over. These aren't bread.
These are a super quick version of a cream puff / eclair dough.  Less eggs,and less time. these area dessert pastry.   I imagine there are a ton of disappointing people when they eat these with gravy!!!

Anyway, I love these. So quick and easy to make. Let them cool, and easy to get out of the pan. I like to use vanilla pudding or the real whipping cream that you beat yourself to fill these with. Actually, I don't fill them. We serve it on the side and pull a part off, and top it with the super cold pudding or whip cream  and enjoy a nice, fresh, light weight dessert.

One of our local stores use to sell cream puffs, but they stopped. This recipe allows me to still have them without spending hours and a ton of time beating all the eggs into the dough by hand. Maybe I'll start melting some chocolate to pour over the top too, like on the top of an eclair or cream puff.

Sounds good but you need to add about 1/2 a tsp of salt to them otherwise they will be bland.    You can also use pan drippings instead of butter if you have them.  Pan drippings will add a lot of flavor

Instead of butter in the pan, I used 1mm of vegetable oil and left it in for ~10 min before pouring the batter straight in. I would probably increase the temperature a little next time and add a pinch of salt to the batter to give it a more savory flavor because it came out a tad bland. Overall a good starting point for something that I plan on perfecting

First time, I forgot to decrease temp to 350 for the last 25 minutes, got Yorkshire Muffins (except for one that sort of puffed up in the corner of tin). Second time, followed recipe to the letter, and again, got muffins. No puffiness, no dip in the middle. Sorry, guess it's back to my search for my perfect Yorkshire Pudding recipe. Sadly, this isn't it.

First time I've made yorkshire pudding from scratch...who knew they'd be sooooo easy!?   Key is to have milk & eggs at room temp be for mixing.   The third egg (other recipes say two) made the difference in this recipe, I think, as they puffed up nicely and retained it's puffiness.  Will definitely be making in future

I made these exactly as the recipe suggests, and they were very good.  For a party of four, all six got eaten, so next time - I'll make a double batch.  We had these with a standing rib roast, and I may try to put some beef drippings in the bottom of a future batch, as well.

Working off this and another recipe, here are the changes I made to this one: I added I/2 tsp. salt, and kept oven temp at 375 start to finish. I also kept the batter in the fridge for about an hour before stirring it again and then pouring into hot pan. (So many other recipes said make sure batter rested, and others said it should be cold...so I had it rest in fridge(?) 

They rose beautifully but deflated after coming out- judging by pictures this is pretty normal? In any case, husband and kids loved them and it was a super easy new treat to try with our Christmas Day roast.  

 Tip: I used a large measuring cup with spout to pour batter, it is just  like pancake batter.

I made these to go with "Garlic Prime Rib", also from this site and they were wonderful. After the first bite I thought that I agreed with the comments about them being too eggy but after they cooled slightly they were perfect!! I've made Yorkshire Pudding in the past and they rarely turned out, this will be my go to recipe from now on. Thanks for sharing.

Followed the recipe and made no changes. Looked just like muffins though. Not horrible but it wasn't the light eggy texture I was expecting. Willing to try again though in case I did something wrong.

Excellent! Easy and you don't have to wait to use the meat fat after the roast is done. Also, they're just the right texture, light and fluffy, but not just a big pocket of air. And if you have leftovers, they're great the next morning with jam!!

This recipe was so simple and easy to follow. They turned out great and took no time at all. Made the batter ahead of time and when my roast was sitting I got the pan warmed and put the mix in the tins. I will defiantly make again! Thanks :)

Hey, I finally got a Yorkshire pudding to rise!  I'll give the recipe that but the taste was "eggier" than I liked. My man loved them.  But then again, he loves anything that has gravy on it.

This is this is pretty much a standard recipe like my Mum made in England. I usually mix equal parts by volume which is pretty much the same I.e one cup of eggs. If I've got some  I use beef dripping rather than butter. The problem with butter is that it burns at high-temperature and I cook mine at 425.

FANTASTIC! Mine looked just like the photo. Added a bit of salt as I saw that suggested in a few reviews.  My friend has tried to make Yorkshire Pudding for years with little success. I'm no cook. . .and she was blown away by how amazing these were.

I used the drippings from our Christmas brisket instead of butter, and followed a recommendation of cooking at 400F for the first 10 min, then dripped to 350 for the remaining 15min.  Came out looking and tasting amazing.  The only problem I had is that they stick to the pan and had to be dug out.

I have to thank you from the bottom of my heart! We lived in the UK for several years, and there, I could make a Yorkie like no other. But back in the states it's a complete no go. I've tried so many recipes, and still a no go... This recipe is the first and only recipe that has worked and I will continue to use it every Sunday!!! Thank you so very much!!! Great height, great flavor, and doesn't burn to a crisp, nicely golden brown and lovely!!!

First time doing Yorkshire Pudding in a muffin tin.  I grew up eating this as my mother is British.  Loved it in this form, the whole muffin puffed up and was crisp.  I did use a hotter oven as a reviewer said and the butter was sizzling.  I made them ahead of time as I only had a muffin tin which held six, and then finished on a baking sheet in the oven.

I read the other reviews and made 2 changes:  added 1/2 tsp. salt and melted the butter @ 400, then added the batter and cooked it for 5 mins @ 400 then lowered it to 350 for 25 mins.  Turned out beautifully.  They were big and fluffy and had a nice centre for the gravy!

They were over cooked on the least amount of time, but were still raw in the middle. They also did not rise. These are more like tasteless muffins than Yorkshire puddings.

Easy and AMAZING with Gravy. 
This was the first time I made this recipe, and it turned out well. I used a standard 12-muffin tin. The Yorkshire Puddings were a little skimpy in a few of the spots. The recipe seems to make about 8 good-sized puddings. Fill each cup about 2/3 with the batter. The ones that were filled to this level turned out best.

It was perfect! Tasted exactly like what my grandmother used to make. The only change I made is that I used vegetable oil instead of butter as that is what my family always used. The only other thing I will do different next time is make the oven hotter for those inital 5 minutes. They didn't pop as much as they should have :-)

I have made this recipe over and over... A couple tips though! Works best if ingredients are room temperature.  Also I use oil or beef drippings not butter.  Put a tsp in each cup and put in the oven until piping hot then quickly spoon in batter and bake as directed! Perfect every time! Roast beef dinner isn't the same without them!

Quick and easy and delish. If you've got drippings, substitute for the butter. If not, butter works great.

First time making this because, for all these years,  I assumed it was complicated. This recipe helped me know the truth! 
Didn't puff up and was not very airy. My fault for not having an initial high temperature (think it should be closer to 425) plus I opened the oven twice. Will try again, doing it properly, because the flavour was good and instructions very easy to follow.

Easy and simple, was a great addition to the meal.  Agreed,  the higher heat first, but combated it by putting it in early, just before the oven reached perfect temp, so the initial heat from the grill element made it pop up and crisp just right on top. A keeper for me!

Never had Yorkshire Pudding before but made this because I wanted something bread like and of the simplicity of this recipe.  It seemed to be missing something but as I was reading some comments, it goes well with  beef.   On its own its boring.  I had to eat it with cheese. Now I know what to expect , I think I will keep this recipe to pair with some kind of meat.

Made for Easter dinner with prime rib and they were great. Based on other reviews, I didn't bother to turn down the heat, and they were fine.  Puffy and tasty, just like Grandma used to make!

Amazing! I have struggled for years to make "proper" Yorkshire puds, after all they are the best part of a roast dinner! Just used this recipe and the outcome has been amazing! Soft, light but crispy too. I have one very happy husband this evening!

Wow first time I have ever made Yorkshire pudding and this was the first time making a prime rib and the sides for Christmas.  I did use EPSEPKE's tips about using the beef soup base and these were the most beautiful things when they came out of the oven!  I so proud of them but after a few minutes they feel somewhat but were still tasty!  Never will be afraid to make Yorkshire pudding again.  Thanks!

Following other recommendations, I started with the oven at 425F for five minutes and then dropped it to 350F for the remainder of the time.  Worked like a charm!

This is my popover recipe...except the initial temp is 425...and lowered to 350 10 minutes in for a good rise. These are a family favorite...we eat the entire batch in minutes it is so good.

This was very easy to make.  I used bacon grease instead of butter and I kept the temperature high (200C) the first 10 minutes and then reduced slightly but still kept it about 190C.  I used the convection oven too.  I will definitely make it again!  Served with homemade jam.

I had never had Yorkshire pudding before, my husband grew up having it with roast beef dinner and has been wanting it for years. I decided I needed to try and make it for him. This was the first time making something that I had never seen before let alone tasted. I followed this recipe completely. I even measured the 1/2 tsp of butter into each little muffin cup, then placed it in the oven and it only took 2 mins. Mixed up all the ingredients and carefully half filled each cup. Baked at 375 for 5 mins. Like it said and then finished at 350. You cannot go wrong with recipe do everything just like it says and watch the video, I did that also. My husband loved them, said they were great and when they came out of the oven he said " that is what they look like". I can see why one reviewer would say they are bland because that is the way they are. I used salted butter. This recipe is a keeper!

These worked out very well as a first attempt at this recipe. We couldn't find our usual recipe so I got this one and was a bit hesitant to try it (it was for my birthday dinner) but it worked wonderfully. We used oil instead of butter in the muffin tin to cook them in, as we always do, and they rose nicely before dipping creating a perfect well for the gravy. The texture was perfect, something all agreed upon, and it was nice and moist inside without being doughy. Excellent recipe and very simple.

Excellent recipe!  I usually make a double batch and I add about 1/2 tsp of salt per double batch.  I noticed that someone said they were "eggy" and yes they are...to me they should be as eggs are a big part of the recipe :)

Very taisty, couldn't find my Grandmothers so used your recipe and these ones stuck to my muffin tin.  It is a new tin.  Could be because a standard egg in recipies use medium sized eggs {I used what I had, small cripes!}    Hmmmm... try it again with beef drippings.  This recipe was much faster than what I'm used too and I did say taisty but didn't say they were very fluffy.  Very fluffy indeed ty.

My grandmother taught me how to make Yorkshire Pudding more than 50 years ago. She did it the old fashioned way. First, you need the over at 425 not 350. I use a level one cup of flour which is probably about 1 1/4 C. I add two eggs and mix with a fork until the all the flour is touched by some egg. Then you add milk, stirring only with a normal fork (my Mom's rule) until you get the consistency right. It should be runny and should not be too thick. It should sort of flow off the fork. Cover and let it sit on the counter for 30 minutes. Put a tsp of oil in the bottom of a muffin tin. One tsp for each. Put tin in overn until smoke comes off the muffic tin. Take out of oven and distribute pudding mix evenly. Place in over for 22 minutes of until top is slightly brown. These will not be the puffed up puddings that are so popular but the Olde English puddings. Make enough to serve some as dessert with white sugar. Awesome.

my wife also suggests that the milk and flour get mixed, and then put in the fridge an hour or so before the egg goes in. i do find it makes them fluffier as well. wonderful recipe. it truly is a simple thing to make that alot of people are afraid of. i know i was!

Made exactly as directed except I used 6 large muffin tins instead of 12 smaller ones. They came out terrible! Thick bottoms and way too tough to eat.  Maybe if I try this again I'll use the 12 muffin tin but I'm not going to try when I have company like I did yesterday. Very disappointing.

I tried this recipe after giving up trying with others, I did everything to the book except I kept mine on at 190c, as I was scared they wouldn't rise, they raised quite well, and were fluffy in the middle and crispy on the outside, a little darker on top than they probably should have been, so maybe I will turn the oven down a little after initial 190c and just keep them in a little longer, but as a whole they looked very similar to the photo! thanks. will keep this recipe for life now:)

For the first time ever making these, my husband and I thought they were tasty little morsels.  Prime rib was our main and I added a teaspoon of butter with a teaspoon of roast drippings in each muffin tin, before baking.  Heated the muffin pan for 5 minutes till sizzling and added the awesome batter. Turned out fluffy with a crispy, flaky crust on the outside. Will always make these with any roast dinner. Thanks!

I made this for the 1st time for Christmas dinner. I followed the recipe as it was my first time making them. They turned out amazing. My dad LOVED them,and so did everyone else. I got compliments all around on these. This recipe has been added to my recipe book for favorites and I will definitely be making these again. Easy,quick and delicious. Thank you very much for sharing your recipe. You do not need to alter this recipe, if you do it's only personal choice because it is great as is :)

This was my English husband's first Christmas in America.  I made these Yorkshire puddings for our family's Christmas dinner.  The puddings turned out great! He highly approved the taste and look! Thank you so much for posting the recipe!

Made for first time. I made test batch in a toaster oven.  They came out perfect!! Will try some of the suggestions to add a little more flavor. Was looking at few UK recipes they add salt and pepper.  
Definitely quick and easy.

Absolutely AMAZING, made these for my sisters class and they all loved them, they have a little eggy taste but still super light and fluffy, I suggest keeping the oven at 400 and using pam instead of butter

I MADE THESE AND THEY WERE VERY BLAND. I FEEL IT WAS BECAUSE THERE WAS NO SALT ADDED TO RECIPE. I COOK WITH UNSALTED BUTTER MAYBE THAT WAS WHY, BUT I FEEL  ADD MAYBE, 1/2 TEASPOON OF SALT.

I made this recipe with my world famous (okay, maybe that is an exaggeration, I should say family famous) prime rib, but instead of butter I used the dripping from the prime rib.  Delicious!

Not bad, but depends on size of eggs. Break eggs in cup, and have same amount of eggs as other ingredients. Let the mixture stand while cooking your meat, and yes, start at 400, for ten minutes, and then turn down to finish while your meat stands to firm up. This gives the best rise.

These are okay. I've had a better recipe but I couldn't find it today.  These raise quite high, but i doubled the recipe and used 12 giant muffin tins.  They are really eggy tho. You wouldn't want to use em as popovers (ie with butter and jam). Yorkshires are  easy to make, the only time consuming part is waiting for them to cook. i would  recommend using a recipe that uses less egg so you get the traditional texture.

A bit eggy, but still good. I'm not sure I kept them in the oven long enough. I think they could have used 5 more minutes baking. They did fall, but that's to be expected. Yorkshire pudding is supposed to have a sunken middle for gravy. This knowledge comes from an English husband, in-laws and friends, as well as lots of time spent in England.

I have never made pudding before, but have eaten and loved it.  This recipe IS very easy. However, I agree with other reviewers, a hotter oven (around 425) and then reduce to 375 worked better.  I have to try a different pan. Even though I used a high quality non-stick pan and butter, the puddings stuck horribly. I am going to try some other recipes an a professional silicone pan. I think the puddings tasted good, although not as good as my friend from Canada who makes the best yorkshire pudding I've ever had in my life. I think yorkshire pudding is VERY personal and everyone's taste is different!

Does anyone know what the difference is between Yorkshire Pudding and Pop Overs??  The recipes are quite similar.  When I make pop overs, I add kosher salt, crushed rosemary and thyme, and grated gruyere cheese.  It is almost a meal in itself.

I used 4 eggs instead of 3 (was taught to do equal parts milk, flour, and egg, and 1 cup ended up being 4 eggs). Otherwise, I followed this recipe exactly and they came out great. Served them with the Roast with Gravy (which has coffee as a "secret ingredient"). Was a huge success!

this is a recipe handed down through several generations.
i like the cupcake version we always used shortening and
spread it out and a few edges might get crispy but nothing
like home made gravy to top it!

I get RAVE reviews every time I make this recipe... I don't like bacon, so making Yorkshire with bacon fat or roast drippings is unpalatable. Pouring the batter on the melted butter gives the top of the Yorkshire a deeeelicious salty, buttery flavour (I always use salted butter).  My #1 recipe on here!  :)

Like others we used a hot 450 F oven for 4 minutes to melt the butter but not smoke out the house. We baked the loaves for approx. 20 minutes but never reduced the heat - simply because I forgot while prepping other items. Loaves turned out fabulous - crispy sides and bottom, fluffy light middle. For our first time doing it from scratch it was a great experience and everyone raved about them. Will be making it again and again.

I added 1/2 tsp salt to the batter, and used King Arthur Whole Wheat White Flour instead of all-purpose. For those who aren't sure of what that is, it's just like whole wheat flour, but comes from an 'albino' wheat plant. The flavour is milder than regular whole wheat, so people like my husband and brother-in-law who eat my bread usually don't know they're eating whole wheat! I'm a health ninja... anyway, the boys didn't notice, and they baked just fine. They puffed right up, but unfortunately due to my carelessness in roughly taking them from the pan (with a butter knife) I deflated them all! Oops! But the flavour was great! I've done popovers before, and these are nearly identical in taste, ingredients, and baking method. Oh, I also used margarine, and I whipped it with a half a beef bouillon cube that I crumbled, then divided that mixture up between the 12 muffin cups. (I wanted to go for the traditional 'beef dripping' flavour that yorkies are supposed to have, but I served them with steak that I fried in a pan, so I had no drippings to use.) I really like how the way I prepared them makes them savory... they would be good for sopping up gravy or whatever, but without the beef bouillon they'd be good served like popovers (with honey butter or jam or whatever tickles your fancy.) Thanks for the recipe!

These were great. This recipe however is missing salt, thus the 4 star rating.  I added about 3/4 tsp. of salt and used oil in place of the butter and they came out fantastic.  Mine didn't rise very high, but they were moist inside and full of flavor. We all enjoyed them.

Read some of the the reviews, and think a to add here is the English because of nessesity used Yorkshire Pudding as a way to utilize "drippens" (sic) fat and gravy. It was not really meant to be eaten on it's own. While Yorkshire pudding mix is available in stores, it is much more economical and rewarding to make from scratch. This recipe is as good and basic as it gets. Once mastered like anything else you can make your own veriations.

tasty, but not authentic. Way too cakey and not nearly light enough. Sorry, but Mum's were better!

made exactly as recipe stated, turned out gorgeous, very easy to make.    *side note: we have a well trained pup at the house, but she found a way to steal a pudding.  You can say this recipe is irresistable.

My first time making yorkshire puddings. This is such an easy recipe and they came out well! I substituted soy milk instead of milk because I'm allergic, and whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose to be healthier. We both enjoyed them very much. Must remember to make gravy next time - it'll only enhance the puddings. They were still good with just butter, though.

I loved these Yorkies.  I was very suprised by how well they turned out, with only three ingredients.  I thought they would need a leavener, but they did not.  These looked beautiful, and tasted awesome.  I smothered mine with homemade gravy and served with slow roasted roast beef.  Everyone loved them.  I did not change this recipe a bit.  I did use salted butter and found the flavour to be awesome.  We gobbled up the entire tray!  Loved it!  Thanks for a great recipe.  I will use this again and again.

Quite tasty!!  I've never made yorkshire pudding before and was looking for something new to make with eggs as I needed to use up what we had before they went bad.  Definitely going to be making this recipe again. :)

I found these looked great when they were first cooked but then kind of colapsed. Maybe thats just yorkshire pudding in general.

I am a California girl and never even considered the idea of eating or even MAKING Yorkshire pudding!  My British son-in-law requested Yorkshire pudding for his birthday and this was the recipe I chose.  It was awesome!  He said it was as good or better than any he had eaten.  My daughter also thought it was amazing!  Thank you for helping me make a great impression on my new son-in-law...we will definitely make this again - and I wouldn't change a thing!

I finally found a Yorkshire pudding/Popover recipe I love, tried many. I didn't add any salt to batter because I shouldn't be using it, the salt in the butter was enough, I am so sick of recipes with too much salt in them anyway.  It's supposed to be eggy and hollow inside so you can put the gravy in. This recipe is a keeper, quick and easy.

First Time for me making these by scratch. I normally just use the packages. They turned out really well. whole family loved them. just one variation I might add is the salt. However the gravy more then made up for it.

These tasted a little bit eggy, and collapsed quite badly once removed from the oven. It may be because the oven I was using is a bit aged, and doesn't perform that well - but aside from that, pretty everyone liked them. They didn't all go from the tray, but for non-beef eaters, this is definitely the best recipe I've ever been able to put into play - thanks for sharing!

Extremely easy and good Yorkshire pudding.   Some people may be turned off by the egg-y, almost custard-y taste, but that's what Yorkshire pudding is supposed to be!

I was looking for something different to serve with pot roast and this was great. Ive never had it before so i had nothing to compare the taste to(it does taste a little eggy) but i gave it five stars for simplicity and the fact that it turned out on my first try.  I put butter and a little juice from the slow cooker in the bottom.  Good stuff.

Yum!  Honestly I always buy the little dry packet, just add water kind(!) In the midst of preparing dinner I realized I didn't have any so once again Allrecipes saved the day! lol.  I glanced quicly at the recipe and then raced off to make it, forgetting how much butter to use.  Anyway I think I ended up putting more butter than called for in each muffin cup but the end result was YUMMY.  I would suggest using at least 1 tsp of butter if not more in each mufrfin cup. The butter gives them a nice crunchy texture on the outside and a rich, buttery flavour (I'm not really a fan of cooking them in the drippings, forget tradition)!  This is a keeper!

As some suggested, I put a pinch of salt into the batter.  Still needs a little something to it if eating it by itself.  But would definitely be better with drippings.  I gave this a 4 because it was quick and easy as name implies.

My husband was the true tester of these since he lived in England for sometime. He did approve of this recipe and nearly ate them all himself. If you need a bread for your dinner these are great to whip up in no time.

I lived in Middlesbrough (North East of England) and we used to bake them every Sunday for Sunday Dinner. The only thing I have replaced from this recipe is butter for vegetable oil as this was the way my British ex husband made them. All my friends love them and ask me to cook those "English thingies". I always bake them when I cook roast chicken or roast beef. Next time I will try with 1 less egg to taste the difference. Very good.

This is by far the best recipe I have tried!  I scaled it down to make only 4 servings and it still worked perfectly.  We had a jar of "spare" bacon fat in the fridge, for just such an occasion.  I suggest the first 5 minutes be at 400 degrees... Heat the fat or butter in the muffin pan until smoking, then add the batter.  They turned out light and fluffy with a perfect well in the middle for gravy! Absolutely devine.

My British boyfriend has been wanting to make the traditional Sunday roast dinners here and was looking for a good Yorkshire Pudding recipe.  We tried this one and they turned out delicious.  My boyfriend was really impressed at how gorgeous they baked and how light they tasted. We are definitely keeping this recipe.

These definitely live up to their name!!  I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out beautifully!  They did stick in the pan a bit though.  Served as a side with Marie's Easy Slow Cooker Pot Roast.

This yorkshire pudding was too heavy, and the egg taste too strong.
I won't be making this again.

I was cooking just for myself so I cut the recipe in half. I also used liquid egg white mix and powder soya milk and they still turned out fine. My suggestion would be to be careful how much oil you add to the muffin tins

Wow!  These were delicious!  They were, as the title says, quick and easy.  I was a bit worried at first, as I left the butter melt for 5 minutes.  When I took out the muffin tray, the butter was very brown and had a strange smell.  BUT they turned out terrific!  I will definitly make these again!  Thanks!

Wasn't too bad, liked the muffin tin shape but think the heat needed to be higher and some meat favoring would've made it perfect.

Very good; as good as my English Granny used to make!  I thought it might be eggy, as many other pud' recipes can be, but it wasn't.  My wife commented that these were the best pud's I'd made her.  I added about 1 tsp of a type of mixed Italian seasoning to the batter, which I think made them even better.

I gave this 4 stars because it is very qick, easy, and turned out just as the recipe stated however it was not what I was looking looking for. 
Very eggy tasting.

I must have done this wrong somehow. I used a mini muffin pan and pan drippings like many of the other recipes. They came out tiny little muffins. They didn't puff at all or go golden brown on top. They did kindof taste like flat yorkshire puddings which is the only reason why I didn't give it a 1. I will ask my mom for her old recipe for next time.
