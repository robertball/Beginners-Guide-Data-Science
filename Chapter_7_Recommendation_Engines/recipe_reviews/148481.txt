EXCELLENT!  Quick, easy, and oh so good!  Don't change a thing.  Quite addicintg too.  My daughter actually found this recipe and made it for a school project.  After she made it and I tried it, I logged onto my account on AllRecipes to save to my recipe box and rate it.  Since it only had 1 rating at the time of this writing, I would not have typically have made this.  So glad she did, and I will definitely be making this again!

These came out amazing!  Easy to make, there were crispy and flaky and crumbled and melted as they were bitten into.  I added in 3 tsp almond extract for the extra almond flavor.    Thank you for sharing Wishme!

Delicious!  My son is allergic to milk although we do use alternative ingredients for butter, this was easy and tasted great!  I even let the kids paint the cookies with food coloring.  Great recipe!

These were the best almond cookies I  have ever had.  Instead of the red food coloring dot I put an almond other then that I followed the recipe as it was and it's perfect.

Kung Hei Fat Choi everyone! I was looking for something more "Hawaii kine" for Chinese New Year potluck tomorrow. Added 1/2 tsp. more almond extract. They came out perfect.. I did cook a little longer because of  my oven temp is probably off. Very light, flaky. Used crisco.

excellent cookie!  i added a little more almond extract just because i like my cookies with a little more almond flavor.  oh, and i flatten with a fork to get a flatter cookie with a criss-cross design (instead of using the red food coloring). thanks for the recipe!

Awesome recipe! Super easy and delicious! I tripled the almond extract like one reviewer suggested because I love the almond flavor. I also used the butter flavored vegetable shortening. They turned  out great! One of the easiest recipes I've ever tried!  I also used red and green food coloring dots as I plan on using them in this years Christmas cookie exchange. Thanks again, great cookies!

Substituted butter and added 2 more teaspoons of almond extract and they were great.  Did not use red food coloring.  Good texture.  If you like a stronger almond flavor, I would suggest 1 tablespoon instead of 1 teaspoon.  I used a medium cookie scoop and pressed tops with a fork.  Made about 32 cookies.  I would make it again.

This is the best almond cookie recipe I have found yet. I followed the direction exactly except I didn't bother with the food coloring.  My family would have eaten the whole batch if I would have let them.  Looks like I will be making a double batch tonight.

Doubled the almond flavor. Used all butter. Used egg yolk and 6 good drops of yellow food coloring for the glaze before baking. Didn't use almond slice on top. Everyone wanted to know where the pink box was so they could put more on the plate  ( almond cookies are normally sold in the Chinese pink box tied with string !!)

I've never had these before but my son needed them for a cultural food day at school. They were delish! I made 2 batches, the first as written but the 2nd, I used half Crisco and half butter. The 2nd batch was even better.

Wow.   These came out so well! Only change I made was to add additional almond extract.   Light, crisp, so wonderful They seem bakery bought! 
I did use the bamboo chopstick in red coloring to color the tops red in celebration of the New Year.  Huge hit! Thank you for sharing this no fail recipe.

Great recipe! So easy to make. Only change I made was 1Tbsp Almond flavoring to have more almond taste. They are crispy and I had lots of compliments on these cookies. Definitely a favorite in my book.

Only changes I made were to double the almond extract and use 1 cup shortening + 3 TBS butter instead of the 1 cup shortening and 3 TBS shortening.

Great recipe!  I made it with vanilla and walnut pieces rather than almond, at the request of my sweetie.  They came out wonderful,  light and melty. I decorated them with sprinkles, cinnamon sugar, and the walnuts, rotating each dozen. They went over great at his family Christmas gathering.  I got 4 dozen.

these were easy to make, but one question - why isn't there almonds in the ingredients or in the instructions.  The picture looks like it has an almond, so I added almonds, but it was confusing
