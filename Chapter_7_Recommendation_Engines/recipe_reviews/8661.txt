Very simple, very tasty, a hit with everyone.  My husband said it tasted better then a well known deep fried chicken.  Which made me very happy. I used American mustard though, and regular chedder cheese and also tried using Canola oil the other night instead of butter, which worked well.

I substituted sesame seeds for the breadcrumbs and forgot to add the parmesan cheese.  It was still a hit at the birthday BBQ.

These wings are very good, but needed a little more flavor.  I added garlic powder to the butter & mustard, and that seemed to give it a little kick.

I am sure the flavor is wonderful, but the coating didn't stick. The pieces that did have the coating were good, but too bland for my taste. I will try again making a couple of changes.

Simple to make and the flavor was excellent. I however failed to get the expected crispiness desired. Baking just didn't make them crispy, if anyone knows how to correct this please let me know. I eally don't want to resort to frying.

I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I only used it as a guide. I put all my wings in a bowl, and spiced them up with salt, pepper, garlic powder and a few other things I found on the spice rack. I mixed the butter and mustard in a bowl and poured it on top of the wings and mixed them up. I put the bread crumbs in a plastic bag (along with some basil and pepper), added the wings, shook 'em up, then put them on a baking sheet in the oven. The batter didn't stick very well, making it a messy dish, but the flavour was really nice.

Followed almost to a tee! Used only about 3 tablespoons  Dijon, added a few drops of Tabasco to butter/mustard mix.  I also added Parm cheese to breadcrumbs for coating.  Family enjoyed

I tried this reciepe for football sunday and it turned out really well.  I did add honey mustard since I only had a little bit of dijon mustard and did add my own spices but it still turned out great.  Thanks for the reciepe even my kids loved it and the hubby loved them as well

Batter didn't stick. Melted off in the oven. Still a good flavor though. Ended up putting them in the fryer for a couple min to make the outside crispy.

I had high hopes for this recipe that were soon crushed by the anticlimactic taste that these wings had. Not only did the breading not stick because of the omission of egg wash, but the taste was very lack luster. Even after adding Tabasco and garlic powder, i could not honestly believe this recipe was anything but a college student's supper. Sorry to be so harsh, but with the time I had with these wings, I cannot stand another recipe for those with timid taste buds.

I tried this a couple of months ago with a friend of mine because we were bored and wanted something different to eat. It is amazing. I absolutely love it. In fact I'm making it right now so my mother can try it. Thanks for a great recipe =].

Follwed recipe for the most part. Added some heat with red pepper flakes and garlic. Instead of Djion I used homemade honey mustard. Creamy and full of flavor. Will use this recipe again.

Easy to make.  Tasted good but needs some zing.  I added a couple shakes of tabasco but next time will add more.

Quick easy recipe, I tweeked the seasoning adding some Spike seasoning and used Parmesan shaker cheese. Alot of people said the coating did not stick I whisked one egg with one tbsp water and dipped the chicken in it then after mixing all the ingredients together in a bag and simple shook the chicken in it, kinda like Shake n Bake. I also placed my chicken on a rack on the foil lined baking sheet, turned the chicken halfway through baking, Turned out crispy and moist and the coating stayed on. Everyone enjoyed them, will be making the again for sure.

Wow. That's all I can say. The only change I made was to add a little bit of garlic powder and Adobo (maybe 1/2 a tsp of each?) to the mustard/butter mix. The breading did not stay on the meat really well, but it wasn't really necessary that it stuck like glue. The meat was still amazingly tender, moist, and juicy and the flavor was delicious! It was a hit with my hubby and kids as well, which is a feat.. Yum. This will be added to the go-to list.

This is delicious! I added the garlic salt to the butter and mustard as a former reviewer did. I made regular chicken drums...my husband ate 7 of the 10. Will definitely do again. (Oh! These cook even better on an oven broiler pan)

Freaking delicious!!!!  I made it with wings the first time, but the next time I just used chicken breast cut into strips.  My grandma, granddad, mom, step-dad, husband and step-son all give two thumbs up!

I did it with honey mustard and it came out amazing. Even my kids kept asking for more. Next time I'll use less butter, since the honey adds its own richness. Great recipe, super easy.
