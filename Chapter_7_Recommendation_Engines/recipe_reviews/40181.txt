Big hit over here!  I cut the oil to 1 cup and subbed the eggs with bananas (mashed with baking powder = common sub) because my little guy is allergic to eggs.  Which by the way he has eaten 1 muffin everyday for the past 3 days.  Nice & moist and good for breakfast.  Great recipe Frost, thanks!

I changed this recipe a lot but it turned out really well. I only did a half batch and cut the oil to 1/2 cup and also cut down the sugar a bit. I substituted half of the flour for whole-wheat and used carrot instead of zucchini.  I forgot to cut the pineapple in half so added the entire can with the juice. I found the muffins to be a bit too sweet but everyone in my house loved them!

These muffins are delicious, and when the garden produces more zucchini than you can possible use, it's a great way to use it up. However, very high fat. Does anyone have a formula for cutting the oil? Use 1/2 cup applesauce to replace 1/4 cup oil?? Oil actually saturated some of the paper muffin liners. But delicious.

Not extraordinary, just uncommonly, dependably good.  I basically changed nothing; just had to work with scaling down this huge recipe to better suit my needs.  So I hope the following helps others who need to do the same:  scaling this down to 16 servings resulted in 12, perfectly shaped and sized muffins.  An 8-oz. can of crushed pineapple and one small to medium sized zucchini worked well.  Hubs keeps telling me he likes neither muffins nor quick breads yet he always seems to like what I bake, including these – he had two, AFTER supper.   Pleasantly sweet, not heavily spiced, with a tender, light, moist crumb that’s cake-like in texture. Just a nice, breakfast type muffin to accompany a cup of coffee or tea.  These would have been fine as is, but I did give them a sprinkle of cinnamon–sugar just cuz.  For those who really have to have their muffins sweeter, a simple glaze of powdered sugar and the drained pineapple juice would be awesome good!

Delicious! I used half whole wheat flour and half white flour. I also used applesauce instead of oil. The turned out great and my toddler loves them.

If you are going to try this one, I'd recommend that you try a partial batch first ... it's a huge yield and I wasted a lot of good ingredients on muffins nobody in my house will eat.  They turned out surprisingly bland and with a weak cupcake texture instead of the muffins I expected.  Even using the helpful tips from other reviews couldn't save this one - disappointing.

These were great muffins- very moist.  I think next time I will try using half oil, half applesauce as they were a little greasy on the paper liners.  Good taste combination though- will make these again.

These are great muffins!  I did use olive oil instead of vegetable oil because that was all that I had on hand.  I also used the pineapple juice because I got distracted by my kiddos and poured the whole thing in - worked fine.  I would also be interested in how to eliminate some of the fat.  I thought I had over greased my pans but maybe not...  These would be great for breakfast and they're not too sweet so they would be fine with dinner or just a quick snack as well.

Make the big batch.  They won't last!  I read lots of reviews and my favorite changes are replacing 1/2 of the flour with white whole wheat flour and replacing 1/2 of the oil with unsweetened applesauce.  And, be sure to drain the zucchini a bit.

These are wonderful.  My daughter loves them also and she had her nose turned up at the idea of the zucchini in them.  I did make a few changes to make them healthy.  Whole wheat flour, splenda, sub apple sauce for the oil and just used egg whites. Thanks for the great recipe!

These are positively awesome! They are so moist and delicious. They do have a lighter texture than many muffins, but I don't see this as a particular problem. I halved the recipe as I only had an 8 oz can of pineapple, but it worked out fine. I will definitely make these again!

These were DELICIOUS!! I did alter the recipe slightly in that I  added a tad more cinnamon and I added a tsp of ground nutmeg also.  I also left a little of the pineapple juice in the crushed pineapple (not a lot) and used 3/4 of the amount of oil called for in the recipe.  They came out so moist and perfect!  Be sure to put the shredded zucchini in a paper towel or cheesecloth and squeeze out all the liquid before you use it. That was a great tip from other reviewers.

These muffins are great!  I also halved the recipe as I have a small family.  I cut the oil to 1/2 cup and added a half cup of unsweetened applesauce.  I also reduced the sugar to 1/2 cupa nd added 3T of honey (for flavor and also to help act as a binding ingredent).  Then I added 3/4 cup of raisins.  If I had ww flour on hand I would have used that instead.  That being said this recipe is a great base for changes.  The muffins were moist and the pineapple and zucchini were a great combo!

Delicious!  First of all, I decided to half the recipe.  Instead of vegetable oil, I used Canola which I had on hand.  Since I prefer a generous sized muffin, I filled the muffin cups almost full, baked at 350 degrees for approximately 30 minutes.  They are wonderfully moist, full of flavor, and extremely light in texture.  A great way to use up excess zucchini.  Next time I'll try using carrots.

I did this recipe exactly as written but adding a pineapple cream cheese frosting...It was AWESOME! Then I tweaked it subbing the eggs for bananas as suggested by others, doing half zucchini half carrot, also adding ground cloves is amazing!

I like the addition of the pineapple and like other reviewers, it does taste even better the next day. I changed a few things: used 1 cup oil and 1 cup applesauce, used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar, & added 1t. pumpkin pie spice and 1 more t. cinnamon. I made muffins and loaves of bread. In my oven, the loaves were done at 40 min, 325 degrees.

I love these muffins.  I cut the recipe in half. I used whole wheat flour for half the flour. Also only half the sugar. I took out the oil and just dumped in the whole can of crushed pineapple. I also added in a couple cups of oats...Made 24 amazing muffins that my 6, 4 and 2 yr old can't get enough of. I froze the other half of the shredded zuke i had left over with a TBS of oil. All set for next time!

These are quickly a new favorite!  This is not a heavy dense muffin, but rather light, delicate and moist.  I used summer squash instead of zucchini and squeezed out most of the moisture.  The only other substitution I made was to use pumpkin pie spice because I was out of cinnamon.  My very picky 6 year old took one bite and said "YUM!"  What a nice way to get veggies in a kid who generally refuses to eat anything that might have actually touched a veggie!

These muffins are great. I needed a way to use up my zucchini growing in the garden faster than I can eat it. My whole family, friends, and neighbors loved them. I will be making this recipe again and again, summer after summer.

These are great and very moist.  I added a cup of chopped walnuts, zest of 1
orange and 2 tsp orange extract and they were even better.  Looked like 2 cups
of oil might be too much, but was just right.

I used only 1 cup of oil & added the pineapple juice instead. Also used only 1 1/2 cups of sugar & only 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon. Turned out really good & plenty sweet. Baked it in a 13x9 pan for 1 hour.

Because I had already made 2 zucchini breads that went flat when I took them out of the oven, I made a half portion of the muffins to see if it was a good recipe.  They were superb!.  They tasted delicious.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Really tasty recipe! I only put in just under 2 cups of sugar and it was still great. I will probably try to cut the oil down next time - they were pretty oily. Otherwise, they were great and I love that this recipe makes a big batch!

I made these for Easter breakfast and they were outstanding!  They didn't need butter or anything.  I halved the recipe, since I only needed to provide 2 dozen.

Made these today and they are light , fluffy and full of flavor. Very easy and quick. I made them with my 3 Grand kids here ages 5, 21/2 and 1 year- if I can make them with these 3 around I can make them anytime! I like that it makes a lot so I can freeze and have them on hand.The Grand kids  love them !

Truly awesome.  Everyone loved them.  Made a huge amount so I froze about 2 dozen in ziplock bags and they were gone in less than 2 weeks!

absolutely the best!  Tasted even better the next day and the next !  Thought I would never use 48 muffins, but after I finished sharing with the neighbors and family they went quite quickly.  Fortunately the zucchini is still coming so back to the kitchen to make more.

I received RAVE reviews for this one. I do not bake, and certainly never from scratch. So when a friend gave me zuchinni, I had to find something to do. These are delicous, just what I wanted! Easy to make for a novice and tasty.

I just didn't like this recipe. I don't know if I added too much pineapple or what but I didn't like the taste of it. It could be just my taste buds too. Thank you anyways Frost

I made the serving size for 24 mini muffins. I added a bit more vanilla and cinnamon. used whole wheat flour and halved the oil with coconut oil. I switched out the pineapple for apple cause my boy doesn't like pineapple. Beautiful!!!! My son loves them!! Will be making these often!!

I've made these for playgroups, and for our neighbor when she had a baby, and they all asked for the recipe.  A great way to sneak in some extra veggies for those non-veggie-lovers in your life! They turn out well with the zucchini and if you substitute carrots.

Yum! These were excellent. I halved the recipe made 12 muffins & a bread loaf. Used applesauce for 1/2 of the oil. Lots of my homemade vanilla & homemade pumpkin pie spice. Really a great breakfast!

These muffins were very good and moist. The only changes I did were use 1/2 cup of applesauce natural in place of so much oil. I did add some walnuts and zest of an orange and a little juice.  I will definately make these again.

Turns out EVERY time! Makes 3 dozen regular muffins plus a dozen mini muffins. I replace 1C oil with 1C applesauce or any pureed tinned fruit that I have handy. It's a lovely, moist recipe and a great way to use up zucchini from the garden.

I subbed 1-1/2 c. whole wheat flour to the all-purpose and cut the sugar to 2 cups, one of white and one of brown. I got two dozen regular size muffins and a half dozen jumbos. Also one cup of oil (WAYYY too much at 2 cups!!) and one of applesauce. The most work was shredding the zucchini. ;-) I might cut back the cinnamon next time, as one of my taste-testers thought it was too much. I won't decide until I try it again. Overwhelming positive response; next up, see what Papa Bear thinks.

Very very good.  I am glad I read all the reviews first.  I cut the recipe in half.  I used carrots instead of zucchini since I didn't have any in the house and didn't want to go out.  I used 1/2 white sugar, 1/2 brown sugar, I used 1/2 w flour and 1/2 ww flour, cut the oil in 1/2 and added applesauce for the rest of the oil, added the pineapple with the juice and added chopped walnuts.  I got 2 dozen of of this.  Just tried one and it is delicious.  I am taking a dozen to a a shut in friend in the morning.  Will definitely make these again.

I think this needs less oil and less sugar. I used fresh pineapple chopped up really fine andsqueezed out the zucchini.

This is a great base recipe but I re - did it. I used whole wheat flour, omited all that oil & used 1 1/2 c vanilla yogurt & 1/2 c sour cream. I also cut back the sugar leaving more of the natural juice from the pinapple, zucchini & added 2 carrots. I made mini muffins..like a 1 bite brownie. Very moist & great after taste....kids didn't even notice the veggies!! High 5 to Mom!

These were very nice and moist and froze well.  I subbed about 1/2 of the flour for wholewheat flour, added a bit more zucchini than was called for, only did 1.5 cups of sugar (instead of 2.5), subbed 1.5 of the 2 cups of oil for apple sauce.  I thought that all of my substitutions to make it a bit healthier would wreck it, but it came out very nicely.  I think I would add some of the pineapple juice next time because I found that I couldn't taste the pineapple as much as I would have liked.

Cut the oil in half and substituted, of all things, pureed cantaloupe (it is what I had on hand!)  left out a quarter cup of sugar and upped the spice a little by adding ground ginger - and as always I used WholeWheatWhite flour instead of reg. white

These muffins were very moist, but not very flavorful. If I try them again, I will use fresh pineapple instead of canned.

Okay I am not a muffin maker..but these were really good. First they helped me use up my zucchini and second they were really moist! I read the reviews really carefully and most said to use less oil, so I used only one cup. I used applesauce for the second cup as required in the recipe. I did have to bake them for about 8 more minutes to get them really brown and pretty! (I think I have a slow oven) I also made sure I poured out excess water from the shredded zucchini. I only had pineapple tidbits on hand, they worked fine! Would make this recipe again, thanks for posting!

This is a great muffin recipe.  I did a half batch and subbed 1/2 cup applesauce for the oil.  I did use a full can of pineapple, so the end result was not as much about the zucchini.  I will definately make these again.

I cut this recipe in half (24) and added 1/4 t. each of ground cloves and nutmeg. They were super! As another reviewer suggested though, next time I might cut the oil in half and replace it with applesauce as the paper liners were a bit greasy. They don't rise much but are very tasty!!! I will make them again as the pineapple/zucchini combo is superb!

The muffins didn't rise. Is that normal?

My first two pans are in the oven, and I will try one to see if I want more spices, but this recipe looks pretty good.  Lots of oil, but that's only a half cup per 12 muffin pan and  five eighths cup of sugar.  My banana muffins for twelve muffin s take  1/3 cup butter and 3/4 cups of sugar.  I don't recommend flouting the time with self-rising  flour.  I am kicking in more cinnamon and nutmeg and cloves.  I had no crushed pineapple so I put a 20 ounce can of rings through the food processor.  They took 28 minutes.

Second time making this and still wonderful! I only used 1 cup oil, coarsely chopped pineapple chunks and defrosted a 4-cup bag of shredded zucchini. I added 1tsp ginger and 1/4 tsp nutmeg. Very light and moist! I froze half of the first batch and we gobbled the last of them yesterday. Freeze well, portable and healthy snack/breakfast!

Did this recipe for a Hawaiian themed day and they were amazing.  I would definitely recommend cutting the oil with half applesauce.  I did so and they were still a tad oily.  I added walnuts too, just because...

I absolutely love this recipe!It was exactly what I needed. 48 seemed a lot so I scaled it down to 16 servings but ended up with 12 large muffins. I wanted to kick it up a notch so I used same quantity of dark soft brown sugar instead of white, ground nutmeg instead of cinnamon and I added a medium grated gala apple for flavour.Turned out amaaaaaaazing and because I have a sweet tooth,I put a light cream cheese icing on top. This is one of the best muffin recipes I have ever tried.Thanks for sharing!

pineapple-zucchini-fall-apart muffins:
these taste good - the kids like them.  I followed the recipe as written except I made a 1/2 batch and used ww pastry flour instead of white flour.  my muffins did not rise but spread out all over the muffin pan.  the texture is very light and they fall apart when taking them out of the pan.  (i used a metal pan sprayed with pam, not liner papers)  overall they DO taste good but boy, what a mess...

A neighbor gave us a zucchini from her garden and having never eaten zucchini before I started searching for what to make with it and I came across these. I made half the batch and wish I would of had an extra zucchini to make the whole 48! My husband, 3 kids and myself loved them and they were gone within a day and half! They are very moist and have great flavor! We will definetly make these again!

I halved the recipe, using 1 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup honey, 1 cup zucchini and 1/2 cup carrots, and 1/2 cup oil, 1/2 cup applesauce.  Overall, a good recipe, but the tastes sort of clashed.  There were a lot of subtle flavors that caused the muffins to be somewhat confusing.  Maybe just use zucchini and pineapple or carrot and pineapple rather than all three.  I'd make it again with more spices and probably tinker around with it a bit more.

The only thing I changed from the original is that I substituted unsweetened applesauce for half of the oil.  They turned out nice and moist, but still firm ( I drained the zucchini very well.. I've learned my lesson from past zucchini bread experiences!) They didn't turn out super flavorful but certainly weren't bland, and weren't too sweet either, which I like.  I would make them again.. Maybe with a bit more cinnamon and pineapple.

Great!  I used a cup of mashed bananas for one of the cups of oil...added a nice 'banana' flavor if you like that.  Cut the sugar to 2 cups and used whole wheat flour instead of white.  Extra spices--added ginger and nutmeg.  

All good...fam is lining up for more.

Not bad, but not great. This muffin was a little on the bland side. It did taste better cooled than eating warm. I prefer a little heaver muffin, this one was more like a boxed mix cupcake. A little nutmeg might have helped the flavor. I cut this reciped down to 12 muffins.

I absolutely loved this recipe.  However, I found that two cups of oil were too much.  I reduced the oil to 1/2 cup and added 1 1/2 cups of unsweetened applesauce. 

Also, I reduced the sugar to 2 cups.

The only reason it's not 5 stars is that the instructions for cook time are a bit off.  I've made it three times now, the second time I kept increasing the cook time until they were ACTUALLY done (so they didn't fall in the middle and remain mushy) - took about 35 minutes, not 25, and that was the key.

Other easy adjustments made the third time - subbed 1 cup of unsweetened applesauce for 1 cup of the oil, and added about 1/2 cup of shredded coconut.  

I've also put about 1/2 tsp of mini choc chips on the top of about half of the muffin batter before baking - tap them down a teensy bit with a fork and they cook in the batter without sinking to the bottom.

Love these muffins but of course made it healthier.  Used the 22 serving adjustment so it came out to exactly half a can of pineapple.  I used 3/4 coconut oil, no eggs at all,  2 ripe mashed bananas,  some wheat germ and a pinch of water and used a bit of the pineapple juice to sweeten.  Also, only used 3/4 cup of sugar and that was plenty.  Chopped a handful of pecans since I was out of walnuts.  Taking these along on a road trip for my kiddos.  Thank you for the great recipe!

Made these this weekend and they were AMAZING!  Super moist and flavorful.  I did substitute half of the oil with no sugar added applesauce and added some nutmeg, but otherwise, stuck completely to the recipe here.  My neighbors asked for extras and the batch made so many I've been able to share with friends.

omg amazing! and forgiving!  I didn't measure the zucchini-- looked closer to 1/2 cup more than i needed. Also, i didn't use  pineapple, as crazy as it sounds, i used cantaloupe that needed to get used up, along with maybe 1/4 cup of the last of some frozen tropical fruit.  I grated the zucchini but put the fruit in a blender.  I decreased the oil by 1/4 of the recipe ( I am being vague on the amount cuz I made 24 muffins, not 48), and these came out so darn moist and delicious!!!  for spices: i like a generous amount of cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger and even black pepper. I never measure vanilla, I just like a lot! closer to a TB of good quality vanilla, probably.  Last but not least: the ABSOLUTE SECRET OF ANY GREAT MUFFIN- BAKE AT 400* around 16-18 minutes. Oh, and don't forget to bring your eggs to a room temp state by soaking them in hot water for a few minutes after you take them out of the fridge!  Last but not least, I ALWAYS sprinkle a generous amount of white sugar on the muffins before baking them.  That gives a nice brown slightly crusty finish to your amazing muffins!

Made these according to the recipe, but with one small change. It's that time of year, and we were craving pumpkin spice, so we substituted the can of pineapple for 1 15 ounce can of pumpkin pie filling. Everything else we kept the same, including baking temp and times. Absolutely amazing!!!

Made the big batch but used 1 c. Coconut oil and 1 cup applesauce instead of all vegetable oil. Turned out nice and moist. May add a little more cinnamon next time.

Yum!!  Love this recipe because muffins were yummy AND the recipe is huge!  It made 24 muffins and 2 loaves in 5x9 (really about 4x8) foil loaf pans!  I substituted 1 cup applesauce for 1 cup of oil and used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil.  I also added 1 cup of oatmeal because I like chewy, hearty muffins.  The additions and substitutions worked well.  I also added chocolate chips to a few muffins-the chips really took away from the hearty muffin flavor-don't try it!  Great recipe, thanks for sharing!

I halved this recipe and wish I had made the whole thing. Delicious  moist muffins that were even better the next day. They freeze well. I want to try other reviewers suggestions on cutting the amount of oil and use applesauce in partial place of some of that oil. I think carrots and zucchini also sound like a great mix. But definitely I will make this again.

Very Good !!!!

Pineapple Zucchini Muffin Haiku: "My toddler liked these, rest of family not so much.  Little too greasy." This recipe is written to make a large yield so I'm glad that I reduced it to a 1 doz. batch b/c we were ultimately not too fond of them.

These are very good.  I did 1/2 the oil the recipe called for and replaced the other 1/2 with applesauce.  Otherwise, I made the recipe as written.  I'd prefer a little more sweetness, but that is a personal preference.  I added pecan pieces to 1/2 the batch to give some crunch, since the substitution of applesauce for 1/2 the oil gives it a gummier texture. I think this will make for a great healthier after-school snack.

I made a half batch.  Only change I made was to use 1/2 cup oil (instead of 1 cup) and add 1/2 cup applesauce.  We really liked them.  I got 17 pretty large muffins out of the half batch.

Would like to cut the oil back, the muffin tins were oily under the muffin cups when I took them out. The recipe says use 4 muffin tins, apparently the baker has 12 muffin tins. I have a small family, so I only have 1-12 muffin tin and a 6-muffin tin. The recipe makes 48 muffins! They are yummy and moist, that's for sure. Will play around with the oil or replace it with applesauce next time!

Do moist and yummy!! I reduced the oil and sugar like many other reviews...1/4 coconut oil, 1/2 cup of applesauce, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup agave and added 1/2 cup of dark choco chips and 1/2 cup shredded coconut. Did the whole batch and freezing half! Great after school snack.

Delicious! I made these muffins as per the recipe, only reducing the oil by half as recommended by other reviews, and using a whole can of pineapple, juice and all. I also added an extra 1/4 cup of flour because of the extra juice. They were perfect.  My fussy toddlers that don't eat vegetables ate many.  Will be using this recipe again for sure.  Might try with half wholemeal flour at some stage.

This recipe was the best. The only change I made was I used 1 cup of canola oil and 1 cup of applesauce. It made exactly 48 muffins. Use a big bowl to mix. I made a batch and took them to work.  They were a hit! Just making my second batch for freezing and family.  A definite "keeper"!

Wonderful muffins. I probably made them a bit huge though, as got 36 muffins and 4 tiny rectangle cakes from the mix. 1/3 were bagged on cooling and stashed in the freezer, the rest have been noshed in three days. The children have enjoyed saying to guests, "guess what's in these?!"

These are mouth watering... Delicious and healthy choice.  Large batch, but freeze well in a zip lock freezer bag.  : )  I pull them out in the morning and they are ready to eat for my break at work. : )  Also if frozen, great to have on hand to share with unexpected guests or someone who does a nice jesture.

I read many of the modifications in the reviews and I cut down the sugar to 2 cups, added nutmeg, as well as almonds, raisins and also used the liquid from the pineapple and used only half the oil. Perfect!

Good muffin base. I cut the oil and subbed with apple sauce. I also added some raisins, coconut, hemp nuts and walnuts because I wanted a heartier muffin for a grab-n-go breakfast.

I halved the recipe and followed as directed but they didn't really rise; too soggy and they taste like they are missing something. A little on the bland side, I will keep searching.

I scaled the recipe down to 16 servings and baked it in an 8x8 pan as a coffee cake.  I added chopped walnuts and dried cranberries as well as subbing sour cream for the oil.  An 8oz can of crushed pineapple seemed to fit the recipe so I used that as well.  This was so moist and yummy!  A wonderful breakfast!

Loves these. My grandma made them exactly how the recipe called for and they were so good. I however tweaked it to our liking and they are still delicious. I only made 1 dozen. Heres what I did 1cup whole wheat flour + 2tbsp whole wheat flour, 1/3cup organic cane sugar, 3/4tsp baking powder, 3/4tsp baking soda, 1tsp pumpkin pie spice, 1/4tsp salt, 1/3cup canola oil, 1 &1/2 egg whites, 3/4cup zucchini, 1/3cup pineapple, 1/4cup pineapple juice, 1/4cup honey & 1tsp vanilla. They are amazing and a bit healthier. They are sweet but not too sweet and super moist. I also made it using carrots.
