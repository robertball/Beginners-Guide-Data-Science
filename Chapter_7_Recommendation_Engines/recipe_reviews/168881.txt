This one was pretty good.  I did it slightly differently:  To the sauce I added an additional tablespoon of cornstarch, mirin and soy sauce.  I also sauteed the edamame and garlic in a bit of olive oil for a few minutes, instead of water.  Tasted good, thanks for a different way to eat edamame.

The flavour of this was really good, but the pod was a bit tough for me. I'll make again using shelled edamame.

This recipe was very good! I added extra garlic, teriyaki, and brown sugar to the mixture and it was yummy! I served the Edamame with Basmati White Rice and Pork Tenderloin marinated in Teriyaki and Brown Sugar. The rice was also very good when I drizzled the edamame sauce over it! Great Recipe, thanks!

I have never used edamame before so I was looking for something with ingredients I had on hand.  Also the frozen edamame I bought was already shelled.  This recipe was great.  My husband had a second serving and an additional  tiny serving.  I followed the recipe exactly and I will make it again. Thanks for sharing!

I love edamame and this recipe was a nice change for the same way I always make. Instead of terriyake sauce I used reduced sodium soy sauce and halved the amount to cut even more sodium. I also used Splenda instead of brown sugar and once it was ready I realized I was out of sesame seeds. This can be a healthy recipe if you are  careful with the amount of sodium. Also great source of protein.

I served this as an appetizer during a Japanese themed dinner party. They were a big hit!   However, I did make a couple of substitutions. Instead of Teriyaki sauce, I used 'Soy Vey' brand hoisin sauce (one of my favorite sauces of all time), and used balsamic vinegar instead of rice vinegar. Though I used a couple of unlikely ingredients, it turned out just fantastic!

This is an excellent recipe! I did not have the rice vinegar so I just used a dash of red wine vinegar instead and I also use the already shelled frozen edamame (not in the pod).

I made this recipe to eat as a snack (refrigerate and munch on later). I didn't use the whole beans in the pod as the one picture showed, but the unpodded beans. The sauce was a bit runny so we had to add cornstarch to thicken it up. The sauce was a bit overpowering for the beans, but overall it worked pretty well.

These were great!  I ate all of them on my plate before even touching the main dish.  There are some in the pan still after dinner and I keep grabbing them every time I walk by.  FYI...someone posted about the pod being tough, you aren't supposed to eat the pod, you pop them out of the shell by pulling it through your teeth.

This was so good! I will definitely fix again. I did have trouble with the 1/4 cup of water not being enough to heat up the edamame, so I added more water and then had to end up draining it somewhat before adding the sauce ingredients. I added the sauce ingredients, but while waiting for the sauce to reduce, I was afraid the edamame was overcooking, so using the tongs, I removed them to a plate, and finished reducing the sauce by itself and once it was thick, I poured the sauce over the edamame and sprinkled with toasted sesame seeds. I also used what little part of sauce was left after devouring the edamame, to dip my sushi roll in (along with dipping the roll in soy sauce, too) and I thought it tasted great! The next time I have Sushi, I plan on trying to use this sauce to drizzle on plate around the sushi roll for presentation effects, too.

I had bought frozen edamame and pulled it out to pair with some asian-style chicken. I had no clue how to cook it so I grabbed my laptop and searched Allrecipes. This was one of the top rated, most voted-on recipes so I figured I'd try it.  I ended up not having teriyaki and had to look up a recipe, which called for sherry, which I did not have so I used red wine vinegar. :)  The edamame was delicious. Even though I had to use substitutions and create ingredients from scratch, it was definitely worth it. Even my husband, who asked me why we can't just "eat American", really liked the flavors. Not knowing how to eat edamame, he had popped a few whole pods in his mouth and started chewing before I could tell him how to eat  it. He loved the flavor but was questioning the texture and wondering how it was going to feel on the way down.  I'm looking forward to tomorrow's lunch, hoping the edamame tastes as good after a night in the fridge. :)

For those trying to eat the pod/shell, you don't. You pop them open and eat the soy beans out of them. When I first went to a Tempanyaki restaurant I didn't know what these were or how to eat them. I had a feeling we didn't eat the whole pod so I asked my sister and she showed me how to eat them lol. Yes it's easier to buy the beans already shelled but what fun is that?

I'm a little confused as to how 1/4 c of water can cook a pound of edamame in the shell. I've always boiled edamame in a large amount of water, and the package itself suggests 6 cups of water! So anyway, I just boiled mine the usual way, then drained it and added the rest of the ingredients. It's okay, but I don't see that it's a huge improvement from regular edamame with salt and pepper. Thanks anyway, though.

I used Pinkypinky's suggestion and sauteed the garlic and edamame in a spray of olive oil. Next time I will use shelled edamame because the pods were too tough. The sauce was delicious served over jasmine rice.

Pretty good, but a little too sweet. I'll probably cut the brown sugar a bit next time, but other than that it was tasty!

The pods aren't meant to be eaten, so why use them?  Much better using shelled edamame.

I loved these, was looking for something to do with Edamames glad I found something. My two year liked them also, although I think next time I make them I will removed the beans from the pod after the water has been boiled to absorb some of the flavoring. The pods are to hard to eat so might as well take them out.

Very Tasty and a nice change from plain.  I have been searching for new things to do with the edamame.  This was a really nice choice.  I actually cooked the beans in water and garlic as instructed, but when it came time to toss in the sauce ingredients.  I doubled that and also tossed 3 julienned checken breasts at the same time.  It took a little longer to reduce down to a glaze, but gave us a meal when served over steamed rice.  My hubby must have meat to feel like he had dinner and this was a winner with him, my teen and myself.  Made great leftovers as fried rice the next day too.  Thanks for the super idea.

I thought this was very good and was close to the edamame served at one of my favorite Sushi restaurants.  I don't know that I will make changes the next time I fix it - and I WILL be making it again!!

We really liked this! I doubled the sauce, and used more garlic and used low sodium soy sauce instead of the teriyaki, and I didn't have any rice vinegar on hand so I used 1/2 the amount of red wine vinegar instead. Next time I'm going to shell the edamame first. YUM!

This is a great why to enjoy Edamame. I've been using it for a while and I'll sub just (low salt) soy sauce for the teriyaki sauce and add some cornstarch to thicken.

Edamame beans are supposed to be eaten from the pod.  Some people eat the pod, but personally they are too tough for me.  This is a nice twist on ordinary soya sauce and rock salt.

This was good, but very sticky and messy to eat.  Edamame is so good by itself that I doubt I will make this again.

Great spin on edamame!  How can you go wrong with teriyaki sauce, brown sugar, rice vinegar and sesame oil?  It was a bit messy to eat...but well worth it.

Very good. I made it again and omitted the brown sugar and added a dash of cayenne pepper which was more to my taste. My only criticism is that there was too much sauce which made the edamame seem gooey.

I found this because I was looking or for a garlic teriyaki sause that I had at a friends house to cook with shirmp ... I had edamame so I used this, added shrimp, calulated serving size to 8 so I'd have extra sause.  I also forgot the vinegar but in the end, I splashed lemon juice on it and a bit of salt and thickend with a bit of starch (melted in water).  It's almost a new recipe now but it was so good ... my hubby loved it!  I also put a little less teriyaki an added a  SZECHUAN  sause for a little bite!

I overdid the garlic --  my partner LOVED it and I only liked it a lot. Didn't have teriyaki sauce, so added little soy sauce instead. Great change of pace.

Super Yum! I didn't have the rice vinegar or the sesame oil, but did fine without it. Substituted regular vinegar and a little olive oil. Kids loved it! Thanks for the recipe.

To people who think they are suppose to eat the whole pod- NO. The whole pod is meant to be put in your mouth and you squeeze/scrape the beans out between your teeth and discard the shell. As you do this you can suck on the flavors of any sauces. Japanese restaurants sell as an appetizer with simply salt sprinkled on it. Eating method as mentioned.

I recently went for sushi and had their "garlic edamame."  I thought, I need to make this!  I made this with the frozen edamame in the pods.  I used the sesame oil and added minced garlic I had on hand.  For me the key was lots of garlic (about 2 TBL's.)  I only used soy sauce (low sodium) and also put water in the pan.  I did not measure it out.   I simply sauteed the garlic in oil, then added soy and water and put in the edamame which was frozen.  I also wanted the sauce thicker so I added some corn starch.  The key for me to the flavor was time.........  After 5 minutes, there was still not enough flavor.  After 20 minutes, the flavor was infused in the pods.  I also did add a couple of TBL's of brown sugar.  It went over very well.  Will make again, and thanks for the recipe!!

I had to make the following changes due to what I had on hand:  Used low sodium soy sauce instead of teriyaki, cider vinegar instead of rice, and olive oil instead of sesame. turned out good.  I will make this again, I would like to get the ingredients listed and see how it is as written. I think it would be pretty good.

Got some frozen edamame beans from a friend who was clearing her freezer. Had never made anything with edamame beans before so didnt know what to expect, but this turned out really nice. I used soya sauce and regular vinegar instead and worked well.

Delicious way to dress up edamame. For all of you thinking you’re supposed to eat the shell, you’re not supposed to eat it! You’re confusing edamame with snap peas! They look very similar.

I had no rice vinegar so I used a splash of balsamic. I also had no sesame seeds or oil. It was still delicious but I totally see how sesame seeds would've made it better. I gave it 5 stars anyway because it's unfair to ding a recipe that I chose despite not having all the ingredients on hand.

Made these and they were absolutely delicious. Used frozen edamame in the pod. Served them in a little bowl as an appetizer in the pods. They were easy to eat ... just scrape the peas out of the pod with your teeth. I included another little dish for people to discard the skins. Tasted just like the edamame appetizer I get in Japanese restaurants.

Absolutely delicious! My kids said it was better than the dish at our favorite sushi restaurant (ps - in response to the review that stated the pod was tough...I never eat the pod but simply bite it to get out the peas, I believe that is the way most people eat edamame).

Very easy and tasty.  I didn't have brown sugar so I used organic coconut palm sugar. We ate them hot as a side item with veggie stir fry over steamed rice and California sushi rolls.  YUM!
With the leftovers, I'm looking forward to snacking on the edamame cold!

Had to improvise a bit since I had only 10 ounces of edamame instead of 16, but turned out great!   :).  Stir-fried some tofu on the side, steamed brown rice, and yummo!    :D
