This recipe was so fun and cute! I used resberry lemonade flavor kool-aid and made regular cupcakes(baking time 18-20min) and they came out perfect.  I also mixed one package of kool-aid with a container of regular frosting and it came out a beautiful color and good flavor but a little too tart for frosting so I used store-bought strawberry frosting for the rest and it tasted perfect. :)

I made 1 change.  The first batch I made tasted to oily. So, on my second batch I did 1/4 cup of oil and that made it way less oily.  I will make it again

I tried it and they turned out adorable, but I think 4 packages is way too much they were extremely sour! I tried the mixed berry package and the cherry package. It was just too much for my taste.
