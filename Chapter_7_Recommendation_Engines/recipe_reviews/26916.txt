I like picked eggs but these are super sour (this is coming from a vinegar lover)!  I was trying to find a recipe that tastes like store-bought picked eggs, this isn't it.

The recipe has far to much vinegar.  When I was making the recipe I was surprised the eggs did not want to separate

I really liked this recipe and gave it to my brother who likes to deer hunt with his friends to take with them when hunting. I like the idea of keeping eggs when my yard chicken in the spring over abundance of eggs I used it in chicken salad, tuna salad, egg salad, and potato salad. I like the tart taste they give to the salads. Thanks

I'm wondering if the poster left out the water by accident...?  I would add about 1 3/4 - 2 cups of water to the recipe.  The mix of spices make for a nice flavour.

These are the absolute BEST pickled eggs I have ever had.  They are very strong, however - so you have to like them that way.  I did not have ginger but used the rest of the recipe as directed.  WOW.  I am going to make this my ONLY pickled egg recipe.

To me these tasted like the standard pickled eggs you get in the big jars on the counter tops of any Mom and Pop store in our area. They are good.

I've tried dozens of pickled eggs recipes (including most of the ones on allrecipes) and this one is perfect. If you haven't made or tried pickled eggs before, this is a great place to start. It's a very standard recipe and very flavorful. It's what I think of when I think of pickled eggs (could be bc my family is from Quebec!). I love the use of fresh ginger. The brine has a sort of pickling spice flavor, but better. This is not too vinegary at all. I ate an egg the next morning and it was already delicious.  If you want even more flavor, leave the ginger and other spices in the jar instead of using the cheesecloth.

my sister always gives me farm fresh eggs, several dozen at a time..this recipe has just replaced my old recipe that I swore by. I do not use cheese cloth.. I just put all ingredients into pan and boil then ladle over the eggs in wide mouth jars. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe with me..it's a keeper for sure!!

The ratio of vinegar/water is way off.  It should be @ 1/2 of each.  Too much vinegar!  I do love the addition of fresh ginger  slices.  I will make again with my own tweaks.
