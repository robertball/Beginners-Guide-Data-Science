This is without a doubt the best pumpkin pie I have ever made-and I have tried just about all of them after over thirty years of baking!! It is not the quickest to do-but is worth the extra half an hour or so in extra time-and is easily done in a few stages.  My family says it is 'authentic pumpkin pie taste without the heaviness.'  Absolutely try this-if you want certain success with everyone who tastes it.  Incredibly impressive and very different from the 'run-of-the-mill' off the-back-of-the-can pumpkin pie recipe!  YUM!

I made this for a dinner party and everyone cleaned their plates. 
It is really light - great if you like the taste of pumpkin but not the 
heavy custard texture of traditional pumpkin pie.

I really liked the light quality of the pie but found the final result a little too gooey and unformed.  It's possible that I didn't do one of the steps right, for instance beat the yolks long enough or cook long enough until thickened.  I think next time I will skip folding the egg whites into the pumpkin mixture in order to make the texture a little more solid and easy to cut.  I also used a graham cracker crust which went well with the other flavors.  Overall a great recipe.

This is pretty good, but it isn't really anything like a pumpkin pie.  It has the flavor of one, but the texture is completely different.  It's layered and really light and fluffy.  If you're looking for a traditional pumpkin pie recipe, this isn't it... but it is very good for what it is.

Thanks for the recipe, I really liked this pie!  The whipped cream mixture alone was to die for.    I doubled the recipe, using 2 9" Pet Ritz deep dish pie crusts, and I still have enough of the pumpkin mixture for at least 1, probably 2 more pies?!  (Bought 2 small cartons of whipping cream, only needed 1, so it works out!)    I really like that there was so much pumpkin in the pie.  So many recipes call for only small amounts of pumpkin.  It really held its own with the other flavors (e.g. nutmeg & allspice), although overall the whipped cream overwhelmed the pie a bit.  I don't know that less whipped cream would be enough to thoroughly cover the layers of pumpkin mixture, but if I make this again I might try it with less confectioners' sugar, and maybe a little more white sugar in the pumpkin mixture?  I would love suggestions!  I went into this expecting it to require a decent amount of effort and still feel compelled to strongly recommend you make this only if you have a slow day at home where you can plan to spend a good deal of it on the recipe, and the cleanup, and washing bowls/utensils between steps depending on how much equipment you have in your kitchen!  Several steps required a mixer so at the very least you will have to wash the beaters, etc. between steps.    Too bad you can't prep much of anything or keep it for long, but it was as reviewed, a "light" alternative to traditional pie and a great flavor, very nice to bring to a party if you can keep very cold!

Really good flavor and texture, but my family and I still prefer the original. This is a perfect recipe for people who don't want the same 'ol, same 'ol. I guess we're just old fashioned.

The only thing I did differently was I didn’t add the egg whites into my whipped cream because I didn’t want to risk salmonella. But the cinnamon whipped cream was amazing! The whole pie was delicious and my husband requested I make this pie instead of a traditional pumpkin pie.

I added to much nutmeg and ginger from the start and then the heating of the pumpkin mix..I heated for well over 5 mins and it thickened but maybe not enough because my pumpkin didn't set up. :(
