I made this for myself this morning, so only one serving. I used grapefruit in place of the strawberries and used vanilla yogurt. It complimented the Maple Bacon Muffins really well and gave me a reason to drink my fruits this morning.

I'd make this again.

Wow - is this ever good!  I love fresh grapefruit so I had to give this a try. I cut the recipe in half and froze my strawberries cutting back on the ice a bit. I also used vanilla yogurt vs. strawberry-banana.  This was very refreshing!

This smoothie was so refreshing!!  The fresh grapefruit juice was the key.  Instead of honey I used agave (about 2 tbls).  I used plain yogurt and frozen strawberries instead of the sugar laced strawberry banana yogurt.  And with every smoothie I added 1/2 scoop of soy protein powder and 1 tbls. of ground flaxseed.  The consistancy of this was not thick but still very good tasting!  I will put this into my "smoothie's" file for sure.

For some reason this picture didn't turn out very good, I apologize for that. However, this smoothie is amazing!!! The grapefruit gives a special touch, so if you are planning on making this you really will have to make sure you use fresh grapefruit juice otherwise would be unfair even to review this recipe.

I really didn't follow the recipe, but it hasn't been rated so here it goes. The proportions are good. I just subbed vanilla yogurt, a nectarine for a banana, and used a bunch of frozen strawberries. I know it is cheating, but it is especially good with a splash of vanilla creamer!

Awesome!  I sliced and juiced an entire grapefruit, added frozen strawberries and blueberries (didn't have a banana on hand), a generous dollop of plain nonfat yogurt, and a drizzle of agave nectar.  Left out the ice.  Turned out really juicy and refreshing.  Will use ice next time for a "smoothier" texture. Thanks!

Pretty good but with a name like "fresh grapefruit juice smoothie", I expected something that tasted a little more like grapefruit.  Really this is a strawberry bannan smoothie with a little grapefruit.  Worth making again with a little tweaking to taste.

This smoothie is delicious! I followed the recipe, save for using vanilla yogurt. One reviewer complained that the grapefruit flavor didn't come through enough using the strawberry banana yogurt, so vanilla must be what makes the difference, as I could taste it very well. One other small adjustment I made was to use all frozen fruit instead of ice. I find ice dilutes a smoothie. When I have overripe bananas, I peel them, put in a freezer bag and freeze. Convenient for smoothies, and an overripe banana usually makes additional sweetener unneccessary. Because of the grapefruit juice in this one though, I used the sweetener. Two large grapefruits produces the 1 1/3 cups of juice, but next time I'll just peel and section the fruit rather than juicing. I think fresh is the only way to go with this one. One other thing: this recipe makes 4 cups, which is not 2 servings IF you consider an 8 oz. glass one serving. Having said that, it was so good that I downed 2 cups! My kids liked it too (tastes like candy, Mom!) Thanks for sharing a great recipe.

Only used a cup of grapefruit juice and added two more bananas to cut down on the super tart flavor it had. Instead of using crushed ice I always use lowfat vanilla ice cream.

Great flavor! I love the addition of the honey, it really gives it that special something (I love honey!). I did have to substitute frozen strawberries for fresh, and pineapple yogurt for the strawberry banana. Wonderful, thanks!

I didn't use the yogurt, only because I tasted it first to see if I could skip it since I love fruit drinks so much and I thought it was fantastic!  Very refreshing, thank you for such a great recipe!

I just made this drink in my new Vitamix with a couple of changes as I didn't want the full amount. I used 1 large peeled red grapefruit, 4 lg strawberries, 1 med banana, and 1-4 oz cup of blueberry greek style yogurt, with 4 ice cubes. It made 3 cups and I have frozen 1/2 for later. I can't wait to see how it comes out frozen... I didn't miss the honey! Next time I think I will try the honey and leave out the banana.

This would be a great smoothie to serve at breakfast or brunch. We omitted the crushed ice as we used frozen fruit; that being said our strawberries were pre-sliced into thirds so I tossed in about a cup to a cup and a half (which seems like too much based on the colour of the photos here). After reading many reviews, I was confident that using vanilla yogurt instead of strawberry-banana would bring out the grapefruit flavour and lessen the sweetness of the beverage. I did use packaged grapefruit juice since I had it on hand (Tropicana Ruby Red, to be exact) but this would be much better with freshly squeezed. My hubby-to-be did not care for the flavour much, so he added Nutriwhip (a sort of sweetened, liquid cream that is sold in a carton that you whip yourself) to whatever was left in the blender which made it creamier, and less sour-tasting to him. I like it both ways.

Very good smoothie.  The fresh grapefruit juice is a perfect balance with the sweet banana and strawberries.  Only change I made was to use splenda in place of honey.

This was good. I did change it a tad. I used an actual grapefruit with the flesh, instead of just the juice. I was trying to avoid a runny smoothie. I also skipped  the ice because I feel like that waters it down, so I used frozen strawberries to take place of the ice. I tasted it before and after adding the yogurt, and I actually liked it better before the yogurt! Maybe it's just because I like the tartness of the grapefruit and the yogurt takes that away.

Pretty good. I liked it a lot but my family said it was a little bland. It came out better when we added some berry sherbet; about 2 scoops. I will make it again.

I used 4 strawberries and half a frozen bannana to not lose all the grapefruit flavor.  Great smoothie.

It was great, maybe a new name possibly "Strawbangra Smoothie" would reflect the flavors a bit better.

I really enjoyed this.  I froze both the bananas and the strawberries, so didn't need to add ice.  It tasted better after it sat for a few minutes.  It was light and refreshing, yet filling.

Delicious! I would recommend using fresh squeezed grapefruit juice. And since I didn't have strawberry banana yogurt, I used vanilla, and it was great! Thanks for the recipe.

This is great. I needed to use up some grapefruit and this is a great way to do it. We could hardly taste the grapefruit. It is not sour at all.

An excellent summertime smoothie! I like my smoothies on the thick side and not overly sweet, so here's how I tweaked the recipe for 1 serving: 2/3 cup fresh grapefruit juice, 4 large strawberries, 1 large frozen banana, 1/2 cup plain low-fat Greek yogurt, 1 packet Stevia in the Raw,  1 tsp chia seeds (for extra nutrition), and 1/2 cup ice (if my strawberries had been frozen, I don't think I would have needed the ice). Using plain Greek yogurt instead of flavored ensures that the grapefruit flavor stays front and center, while the little bit of stevia ensures it's not too tangy. A perfect blend of sweet and tart! :-)
