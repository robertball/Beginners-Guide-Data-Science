Made as per recipe, the kids loved getting involved with the banana mashing and creation! Turned out great, and the kids love them as on the go snacks! Will be made again!

Great choice for a no sugar snack!  Very easy.   I may make it with dates added next time just for variety.  I used less sunflower seeds than called for.  I put almonds in blender until coarsely chopped.  And added  a few whole cashews.   Everything else exactly per recipe.  Cashews tasted good but made bars difficult to cut.   Great snack to take to work for quick pick me up and healthy too!  Many Thanks for the recipe.

Very healthy, tasty bar.  Mine didn't stick together too well once cut but I may not have pressed them in the pan firmly enough.  I will definitely be making them again.

I made it according to directions. I was surprised at its lack of flavor. I think I might make it again adding some almond extract and honey.
