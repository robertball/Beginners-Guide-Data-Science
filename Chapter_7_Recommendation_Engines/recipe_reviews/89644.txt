These were GREAT!  I made some modifications to the recipe like adding green onions and a few spoonfuls of Miracle Whip and making substitutions (garlic salt, chili powder).  I also used about a third less cream cheese.  It is really easy to modify this recipe to suit anyone's tastes.

This was really good.  The only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is because I did make so many changes.  First of all, I didn't use the Italian Bread, I used english muffins.  I also added about half cup more of crab meat and about a tablespoon of mayo.  I also used cheddar cheese instead of the swiss.  But boy did they taste delicious.

This is a very easy and good recipe!  Although, I only "like" this recipe my husband and Mother-in-law absolutely LOVE this dish. My husband asked me to add this to my "top" recipe list, which I love because its easy to make so that makes 5 stars for me!  
(I leave out the hot sauce though)

While this was very good, the taste of the crab was lost.  Next time I will use less cream cheese (and sub light to make it less filling), increase the crab, and add some chopped bell pepper to the mix.  Even though it was too cream cheesy, it still was  delicious on H/M country white bread, with a hearty green salad on the side.

This is one of my favorite easy meals.  After making it according to directions the first time, I found it to be too rich for my tastes.  To lighten it up the second time, I used half the cream cheese and more crab and added mayo, a little lemon juice and a little worchchestershire sauce.  When assembling them, I added a nice thick slice of heirloom tomato before adding a slice of swiss cheese.  I also used english muffins.  Yum!

These were so very good! The kids argued over who got the last few melts, right down to splitting the last one in half. Some people said there was too much cream cheese for the amount of crab, so I just added more until I thought it was a good ratio (used fake crab). Also added green onions as others suggested. Didn't have Swiss, so used a pre-shredded pizza mix of cheeses and that was quite good.

We used to make this recipe when I was a kid. It was a family favorite and I still love it today. Only thing different is I use a mixture of shredded American/Swiss cheese. Either way is AOK with me.

Easy, and quite good. I imagine you could add whatever sounds good or whatever you have on hand, and use this as a base recipe. The hubby liked it and we both had seconds :D Plan on using a version of this to make a dip/topping for some Ritz crackers!

Thank you for sharing your recipe with AR, JAYDA, these were tasty.  I added some fine diced celery to the mix and used liberal amounts of Tabasco.  Next time I think I'll use 1/2 of the cream cheese called for so the taste is a little more "crabby" than "cheesey".  Served with Cindy's clam chowder, a nice easy meal.

These were OK.  We halved the cream cheese and added Miracle Whip, plus we used split English muffins instead of Italian bread.  We tried half with sliced tomato and they were good.  They were a little bland - definitely needed some minced green onion, both for color and taste.

LOVED this recipe!  First, this is a VERY good meal that is ready to eat in 20 min.  - I don't find a lot of those!

I followed the recipe on first try and it was great.  I like a bit of crunch, though, so added a bit of green onion and celery on second try.  I have also tried swiss, cheddar, and an italian mix on 3 different occasions and all were great!

I absolutely loved this recipe. I am not a fan of garlic so I omitted the garlic. Also   I was out of bread and only had tortillas. It came out great anyways.

Very good, but I think I would cut the bread up more into thick sliced pieces and serve this dish as an appetizer.  Too rich to make it a meal.

Definitely a keeper.  Left out the garlic and served on Texas Toast.  Also added a squeeze of horseradish sauce.   Mmmmm perfect

I didn't make any changes to the spread. We thought it was really good just the way it was. We've used several different breads and actually prefer it on garlic bread. The whole family enjoys the spread part on anything though. Thanks so much for sharing!

These were tasty but a little too cheesey for us.  I added a dash of Ol'Bay seasoning and used only 6 oz of cream cheese and about 3 tablespoons of low fat mayo.  I also used the fake Krab stuff and put it on my homemade bagette.

These were pretty good - I would recommend just reducing the cream cheese to about 3/4 of a package.  I also added a couple of green onions just for color and about 1/8 teaspoon of Old Bay to draw out the flavour of the crab.

Im not a big seafood kinda person but when its with cream cheese and cheese, Ill give it a try. We just so happened to have some Crab that needed to get boiled up and I am really glad that we did. They were very good and my husband loved them. I did add some garlic salt in addition, and did colby jack cheese instead of swiss, just cause i have never liked swiss. Thats just me :) I also did 6 thick slices of Italian bread because people had mentioned it was really rich. So this way my spread was a little thinner on my bread, and i thought it came out perfect. Also i used Franks Red Hot sauce!

Amazing AND easy! Huge hit with my wife; I became an overnight Facebook sensation with her review. The only changes I made were I did not use the hot sauce; but DID use Old Bay. (I'm from Baltimore; and if you're making ANYTHING with crab then it MUST include Old Bay.) Didn't measure so I can't say how much I used; and when it comes to Old Bay it's all a matter of taste. I don't like the Old Bay to overpower the taste of the crab so I just used a few pinches; maybe 1/4 Tbl spoon? If you're new to cooking - as I am - this is a great way to get started and impress people with your mad chef-like skills!

Wow, this is sooooooooo good! Yes, it was a little rich but I suffered through it!   I did reduce the cream cheese to 4 oz. and added about 2 T. miracle whip.  I used sliced swiss cheese because that's what I had but I will use the grated next time.  The sliced cheese was just too thick.

Delicious! I used two cloves of garlic instead of one and I didn't use the hot pepper sauce. Also, I used a loaf of french bread and just sliced it in half and it worked great! Very tasty!

Very rich.  This is similar to a dish we had in Savannah, GA.  We used both Italian bread and thin pita bread.  We liked it a lot more with the pita bread.  The recipe was good, it was just a little too rich for our taste.

This melt is ok, but has too much cream cheese and not enough flavor, even after adding a little garlic salt and onion salt. It was also too rich for a lunch or dinner; I would suggest serving on smaller pieces of toasted bread as an appetizer
