with a few modifications this was a great meal. I felt it was a little heavy on the thyme i think a 1/4 tsp would have been just right. I added 1/4 tsp of marjoram (dried) and did a puff pastery crust, 400' oven for about 20mins. Will definetly make this again. Little idea, make the mix and put in a ziplock container or baggy and freeze it. have puff pastery on hand and when your ready, defrost it and assemble. Happy cooking!

This was really good.  I did not have dijon mustard and used ground mustard instead and it was delish!  It is rather time consuming and involved for a pot pie recipe but I think it's worth it.

Great recipe! We're snowed in, so I had to make do with what was on hand, but it still turned out delish! I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned, fat free half & half instead of cream, stone ground mustard instead of Dijon, and a 16 oz bag of frozen peas & carrots. Used my bread machine to make bread dough and dotted that evenly over the top. A deluxe homemade pot pie without the labor intense pie crust!

Tastes great, easy to make, smells mouth watering when cooking.  BIG hit with family.  1 drawback - rolls on top as a crust tasted more like croutons.  Would recommend using a ready-made pie crust to place on top or making one.

My husband really enjoyed it. He loves Chicken Pot Pie. I have never had it before therefore I am still not sure if I like it or not.

This was very good and easy to make.  The only thing I didn't like was that the topping is so crusty, but my husband loved it this way.  I will definitely make this again.  Saved time and used a baked chicken from the grocery store.

I love this recipe for utilizing so much of my "leftovers"!! I did not have Mushrooms [so I omitted them, besides, the boy hates them!] nor did I feel like running to the store for the bread topping, so we whipped up a batch of Bisquik dough and rolled that over the pan. Otherwise, everything else was followed to a T. I even got to finally use my homemade chicken broth that I'd been dying to try! I was skeptical at first that the sauce was too runny but it turned out to be perfect later. This was downright DELICIOUS. So satisfying, yummy, homemade, and worth every effort [and it's still easy!] My boyfriend and I devoured half of the contents of the 9x13 pan in the first sitting. The rest made for awesome leftovers.

This was just what I was looking for.  I had most of the ingredients and was looking for the perfect recipe.  My whole family loved it!  My kids even reheated it for a snack later on.  The only change I made was I used fat free half and half instead of cream, which is what I had on hand and I did not add the optional green beans.

I followed the directions and this recipe did not turn out! And it tasted awful! I will never make this again.

OK, this was delicious! I, too, used ground mustard and added 1/2 tsp. of marjoram. I also went with the puffed pastry crust. This could work with any type of crust. The filling is SO rich and tasty! My boys wanted me to make it for their birthday dinners!

With all due respect to Sister Schubert's dinner rolls, I much prefer this with a puff pastry sheet as the crust.  It's really no harder to make a lot, than a little, so I make it in a double or triple batch, freeze the extra filling and assemble with the puff pastry when I pull it out for a relatively easy meal down the line.  I've used any number of different vegetables in the mix, and everything I've thrown in has worked well.  This has become a standard in our dinner rotation and one of my favorites.

I don't know why I chose this one out of the dozens offered but I'm glad I did. I decided to make this and invite a couple of friends over who looked sort of put off that I made chicken pot pie instead of burgers like I usually do. Well, the whole thing was gone within 30 minuets and everyone wanted the recipe. This totally rocked!!
The only tweaks I made was I added 1/2 cup of celery, 2/3 cup of sherry to broth and substituted poultry season for the others on list . Also unrolled a 8pc tube of crescent rolls across the top and buttered it.

Reading reviews always amazes me as to how people change the recipe and then rate it!  This is after-all "Sister-Schuberts" which is a brand of bread.  If you want a different topping, that is fine, but don't rate this one!  We really enjoyed it.  Next time I would buy a roasted chicken to use.  I boiled my chicken with garlic and onion and it was OK, but I think roasted would probably be better.  Some reviewers complained about too much bread.  I cut the rolls in half and it worked really well.  It just depends on if your preference is a thick bread on top or  not quite so much.

I made this recipe tonight for a big group, except that I used the filling for stuffed bread instead of a pot pie, and it was tremendous. My guests were very impressed and I think everyone ate second or third servings. Thank you so much for an excellent recipe - This one is going into the family recipe book!

This is soooo good!! I do add the veggies my family likes and take out the mushrooms. The base is delicious!! Much better than using a can of gravy for chicken pot pie.
