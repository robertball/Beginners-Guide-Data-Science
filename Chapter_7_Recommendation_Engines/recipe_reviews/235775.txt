Try using white chips instead of butterscotch, I think the butterscotch was stronger than the eggnog. Love the idea and the recipe.

Nice change from chocolate fudge. I used butterscotch chips. I do think white chips would have produced a more "eggnoggy" appearance. I added some chopped pecans as I like nuts in fudge and this was very sweet

My favorite recipe. I love making different one following the same steps. You can sub the eggnog for chocolate milk and instant coffee with milk chocolate chips.  So yummy

I'm not an eggnog fan so I cut the recipe in 1/2.  I did use the white chips and it's definitely very "eggnoggy".  The fudge isn't creamy, more crumbly but it worked for my hubs.
