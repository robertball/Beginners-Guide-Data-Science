I just want to say you are a life savor! I HATE liver with a passion. I was diagnosed with very low iron because of a surgery that I am to be having.  I went passed 6 wks no luck still low. I have 4 wks to get my hemoglobin to 12 its at 11.3.  I am now eatting liver twice a day. This recipe is the bomb!!!! The liver taste is gone. I eat it likes its hamburger.  I did add some hot peppers and mushrooms but other than that it was perfect. Do you know that even my 7 year old asked for seconds.  I may just like liver now...well with this recipe anyways.

This recipe was a big surprise. I like liver, but not a liver lover. Thought I would try this once. Cooked two lbs. of liver, my husband and I had two meals of it and nothing left. I even went back for seconds. We always eat the standard liver and onions but now this will certainly be right there too. Thanks.

I used chicken liver instead of beef liver and didn't flour the pieces before frying in oil. I added salt, pepper, onion, oregano, parsley and paprika to the pan while frying. I substituted about 10 ounces of tomato sauce and 2 spoons of tomato paste in place of the water and ketchup. I served it with plain white rice and it was fantastic.

Made this recipe for me and my hubby. We both liked it, however I didn't have to cook it in the sauce for the 20 minutes. As it was I had to add a small amount of water because it was evaporating. I usually have the standard liver and onions, but it was really good for a change.

Never had liver like that before and I was surprized how tender a cooked liver can be! I put it in a pita bread and ate it like a hamburger, it was delicious. Oh! and super easy to make! Thanks:)

I'm in love with this recipe. I can eat liver any day of the week and was looking for something different to do to some liver I had. My wife still won't eat it but I loved it. She did say it smelled good but she just can't get over the fact that I'm eating liver. Maybe one day I will sneak it into a dish.

I don't like liver but need to eat it for medical reasons. This recipe sounded like it disguised the taste of liver quite well based on the reviews. Let me tell you it does NOT hide the taste. If you don't like liver you still won't like this either.

this is wonderful!!! WE have been married for 60 years & I have never fixed liver this way. For those of you that are sticking up your nose--shame! Try this & be surprised how good this is. I will add a few chopped onion next time.
thanks for the recipe Aunt Mamie

This was pretty good. I doubled the sauce, but cut down on the sugar or else it will be too sweet.

I used tomato sauce instead of ketchup and water.  Everything else stayed the same.  This was quite good and I would make again.  Next time, I might add some onions and bell peppers.

This recipe deserves 10 stars!!
I made it last night for dinner and my husband and me really enjoyed. Now he doesn't want me to go back and cook beef liver the way I used to do. Can you guys imagine? Well, I guess that's o.k. Thanks a lot for sharing! Hugs... Monica

This is my go-to recipe when I need to eat more iron.  The sauce overpowers the 'liver flavor' nicely.

I soak the liver in milk the night before cooking and it makes the liver taste mild.  This is the only way we cook liver now.

Excellent recipe. I sauted onions first and set aside. Added them back before simmering in the bbq sauce. I also added some liquid smoke, paprika, cumin and used red wine vinegar in the sauce for an extra kick.

I can see why liver despisers would like this recipe. The barbecue sauce masks the taste of liver to the point that it feels like you are eating some sort of undefined, nutritious beef covered in a sweet barbecue sauce.  Me, on the other hand, I love liver and don't want to mask it's taste to such an extent. So although good, this recipe isn't for me (I should mention that my husband liked it). Also, you definitely do not need 20 minutes of simmering. 5 minutes should be plenty. If liver is over cooked it will become chewy and unappetizing.

I've never had such tender liver in my life! Truly amazing and easy. My family didn't like the sweetness of the sauce (with the ketchup and brown sugar), but I loved it! It's like chinese food (the sweet and savory concept), but better. I will make this again since the meat came out so tender but I probably won't add anything that'll make it sweet. I'll try the spicy route next time. Thanks for a great starting point on a better liver dish, AUNT MAMIE!

I really liked it.  My family isn't big on liver, but the oldest kids ate it (4. 5, 6).  It helped that strawberry shortcake was offered for dessert if all the dinner was eaten up.  I could have eaten the whole liver dinner myself...I don't remember liking liver as much as I have these past few years...I am glad I found a different recipe besides liver and onions.  I will make again.  Thank you.

I ,myself, am not to found of liver. I have made liver many ways over the years for my boyfriend and he said this was the best he has ever had. I actually ate a piece as well. The only different thing I did was to saute up a medium onion and add it to the simmering sauce. Forget the plain old liver and onions ,I chalk this one up as my number one liver recipe!

I always soak liver in milk for an hour before cooking but I thought I'd try this as is...well, hate to say it but it still needs this step.  Just soak it in enough milk to cover it for at least an hour and pat dry before cooking.  It makes a huge difference.  Also, twenty minutes was too long...it overcooked.  I only made a serving to try and so I then made it with these changes and the sauce as directed and it was great!  I think a commercial sauce would do almost as well for the ultimate quickie recipe.

Good sauce, but still can't stand the smell or texture of liver.

My husband likes just plain liver, so he LOVED this recipe! Easy to make, so will make for husband again.  I despise liver (my mother would make my brother and I eat it before we could go Trick-or-Treating)!  But, it's a healthy, lean source of protein, so I thought that maybe...NOPE.  Liver flavor is still there (it's such a distinctive flavor and i hate it so much, that even the slightest liver flavor is unacceptable to me). Sauce is yummy, though.  Maybe simmer chicken breasts in it for me? Good recipe--for people who can stand the taste of liver. Five stars--for my husband's pallet and for my ease preparing.

I don't like liver. . . but this was more than tolerable. I even ate it cold the next day. Nice little iron-rich bites.

This was really good.
  I added sauted onion, garlic and green peppers to the sauce.  Nice change from boring liver.

To start off, l love liver.  I was looking for another way to make instead of the traditional liver and onions.  Made with venison instead of beef.  Sauce is real tasty, and will make again.   If your looking to hide the "liver" taste, keep looking.

I increased the sauce by four times. I sautéed mushrooms and onions and added them to the liver and sauce, then cooked for the 20 minutes. I served it over macaroni noodles with a side of broccoli. My boys loved it!

I just can't, beef liver is so nasty. I did hear that you can soak the liver in milk to make it less livery tasting. I did not do this. This is to no fault of this recipe, the flavor without the liver was fine. However, it did not mask the liver flavor.

I have always made traditional Liver & Onions (mostly because my wife likes it about once a month). When I ran across this recipe I thought I would try it. When I went to make it I didn't have any flour so I substituted Italian bread crumbs. I sauted some onions, removed and set aside. I then browned the Liver in Butter,  added the sauce and then topped it with the onions. It was a big hit and from now on this will be the Liver recipe that I will use. The Liver melted in your mouth.

I currently have low iron and i remembered my doctor informed me about liver being a great source for iron. I wanted to try it and cook it in a different way. Well it was delicious, great flavor and just so tender!!!! Only thing is i have to be careful of eating too much being that the sodium is high with this entire recipe...Otherwise, I truly thought the flavor and tenderness of the liver was wonderful!!!I ate it with brown long grain rice and steam broccoli... -Cee

We all agreed the best liver recipe yet...beats liver and onions by quite a bit just because the liver stays so moist; normal pan fried liver tends to dry out and get tough too easy.

This turned out really good, although we didn't add the brown sugar, so the only sugar in it was what was in the ketchup.  We just love liver and onions the old fashioned way though, and this was a little too sweet for us.  Tasty though, and a different way to do liver!

Delicious. Pork, beef or chicken liver. My preference is to use raw apple cider vinegar for the vinegar and for our family of four I double the sauce recipe and serve atop brown rice.  I simmered only five minutes instead of twenty and it was great.  I suppose the additional simmering would thicken the sauce but over rice it wasn't necessary.
