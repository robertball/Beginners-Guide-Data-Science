Talk about simple. These were excellent! When it comes to baked potatoes, I am lazy and stick them in the microwave. If I have the time, I won't be doing that anymore. I know the most nutrition is in the peel but I've never been a fan. The peel turns out so crispy in this recipe that I gobbled it up. Thanks for sharing!
