This made me think of a tweaked shepherds pie. No changes made other than I chose to finish it in the oven to allow the tater tots to crisp up. It's too salty for my taste and I didn't even add the salt as instructed.

I had to make a few adjustments due to the wife not liking mushrooms and having whole potatoes on hand instead of tater tots. I subbed tomato soup (made it too sweet) since that's what I had and cut the potatoes very small but forgot to cook them separately first. It ultimately still turned out good but not photo worthy. We will try it again soon! I hope to convince the wife that the mushroom soup won't be too bad in the dish.:)
