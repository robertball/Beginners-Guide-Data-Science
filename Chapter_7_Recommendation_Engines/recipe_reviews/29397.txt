I've made this pie on my birthday for 2 years and it is always a hit. Once you try it you will never go back to any other rhubarb recipe, guaranteed....

This is the first year I have grown my own rhubarb and I wanted to try a different recipe.  I just love this pie...a cross between cheesecake and pie.  The only thing I did different was, I used a graham cracker crust.  Very easy and very yummy.  I will be making this again!!!!

Some of my family loved this, and some didn't. They weren't sure what to expect! :) It's almost like Rhubarb Cheesecake!

If I could give it 3 1/2 stars I would. It made a very pretty 3 layer pie when cut. Good for anyone looking for a rhubarb dessert that wasn't "too sweet." The sour cream topping and cheesecake layer made an interesting combination with the rhubarb, but I think whipped cream on top instead of the sour cream topping would have been better. Also, the suggested 30 minutes of baking after adding the cheesecake layer seems far too long. My oven bakes at a fairly accurate temperature, and the cheesecake layer was perfectly set at only 15 minutes. 

Over all, it was okay, but probably not the first rhubarb recipe I would reach for.

This sounded like a good idea at the time, but the rhubarb doesn't get cooked for long enough and the pie goes runny very quickly in the fridge.
