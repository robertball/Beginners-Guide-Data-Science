I used a pork butt roast that I slow cooked the day before.  Retain the drippings and separate the fat.  (about 2 cups of broth, may need to add a little water)  Instead of green enchilada sauce I used red (I've tried both but red is better) I added a can of rotell tomatoes and a chopped up green pepper.  This is the closest thing I have ever found to Bennie's green chili in Denver CO.  (I omit the cilantro and lime, but I'm sure it would be good)

This is delicious.  The only thing I changed was to add some stewed tomatoes, and the juice from a whole lime instead of a half.  Love this.

This had a good flavor but was not chili-ish at all. It was like enchilada sauce with a bit of meat in it. We enjoyed it with chips but it needed something else. Too saucy not enough substance.

I made this with 2lbs of pork tenderloin that I cooked in the slow cooker all day with 1 can of Dr. Pepper, 1 cup f BBQ sauce, and 1 cup of beef broth.  I cut the pork into cubes and used it in this recipe.  The only other changes I made:  I used a 10oz can of green enchilada sauce, and I used beef broth instead of water at the end.  I also used 1 tsp of all the spices instead of the varied amounts the recipe calls for (I tend to eyeball my spices, and I like everything HOT so it worked to use more of the peppery spices).  In the end I got a beautiful, chunky stew.  DELISH! :)

This had a very good flavor and was easy to make! I addes some potatoes but only because I like my soups chunky. I've done this one with chicken too and it turned out great as well.

We used this recipe to enter a chili cook off, and won people's choice!  Defiantly a different type of chili, try it if you are bored with the traditional chili recipe.

I used pork chops finely chopped and simmer soup for hours to tenderize pork.  I also added a can of diced tomatoes.  I topped soup before serving with a dollop of sour cream and fresh pico de gayo. Yum!  Great recipe. I also omitted the lime juice and cilantro

Once again another great green chili dish.  I decided to try this one because I had a huge can of green enchilada sauce in the pantry to use up.  I used about 2 cups cubed leftover pork loin instead of the fresh ground.  Also added a couple of diced New Mexico chilies from the freezer. The lime and cilantro at the end are a must!  Ate this with fresh flour tortillas to sop up that delicioso gravy!! Thank you Jason!!

I used left over pork roast.  I think that 2 peppers are overkill.  The salsa verde was extra hot and contain heat enough.  It was the best green chili we have ever had.

Pretty good, I'd call it more of a stew than a chili, unless I just did something wrong =).

Absolutely wonderful, although I did make a few small changes.  Instead of the ground pork, I used a pork loin that my husband cut up into 1/2 inch cubes.  We marinated the pork with some Mexican seasonings.  This is definitely one recipe that will be added to the family cookbook.  Thanks so much for sharing.

This recipe is so good!  I made it almost exactly as listed except I used chunks of pork roast instead of the ground pork.  The flavor is amazing and it's very simple to make.

A wonderful mix of flavors. I added a can of black beans (drained) which helped thicken it up a bit and served it in a bowl with a scoop of white rice in the middle. A side salad completes the meal. (For the salad dressing, try mixing some taco seasoning into ranch dressing, a nice compliment, in my opinion.)

This is the best green chili recipe that I've found. It's really easy and makes tons of leftovers. My husband asks me to make it almost every week. I substitute lean ground turkey for pork and add green peppers. I also use 505 Organic Green chili sauce because it's gluten-free and has no MSG (many of the green enchiliada sauces contain MSG so check the labels).

Yummy, but seemed like it was just missing something.  Very plain without the add in.  I added the potatoes like other suggested, I wish I would had added the can of stewed tomatoes.  I will next time for sure. It did have a really good flavor.

Another one for the whole family! We doubled the meat, since we are a meat-y family, and added diced avocado, a dollop of sour cream and some corn chips for garnish. But, you do not need anything else! This is a fabulous alternative to the standard Rotel dip as well!

Will absolutely make again, so delicious!  I did make some additions, but don't feel these changed this already-good recipe in fundamental ways.  Had part of a whole pork loin from my favorite warehouse store that needed cooking, so cubed (3/4") the meat after removing the fat cap.  Rendered the fat and used this instead of olive oil and butter.  Added a can each of fire-roasted diced tomatoes, corn and black beans.  Served with a squeeze of fresh lime, chopped cilantro and a spoonful of light sour cream.  Next time, will grind the pork and use 2 cans each of corn and beans, and perhaps serve over brown rice.  This is a wonderful recipe that can be adapted for serving larger groups, with the low cost extensions I've mentioned...thanks so much for getting me going down this green chili path!

Amazing, one of the best recipes I have made from this website.  It has just enough spice and I love how it turned out rather thick!  

In step 2, after the onions cook down for a couple minutes, I added diced bell peppers (1/2 of a green and 1/2 yellow)

Some people said it was a bit too saucy...I wasn't paying attention to the amounts and accidentally only added one 15oz sized can of Green Enchilada Sauce (rather than 28oz) and 16oz of Green Salsa (instead of 7oz)...and the consistency was perfect!  After adding the water & salsa, I also added diced potatoes (I used 3 small-medium white potatoes)...gave it a really nice extra something!

Garnish with a dollop of sour cream, tortilla strips and avocado slices...AMAZING

This recipe is a keeper!!!

Yummy, I used chicken broth instead of water and a whole lime.  I will make it again with more meat next time.  I am thinking of entering it again for a chili cookoff!

I love this and make it regularly. My only change is the type of pork. After I make my bbq pulled pork shoulder, I use a pound of the leftover meat for this recipe. Delicious and great texture.

I made this for a neighborhood chili cook-off, just for fun, and won 1st prize! But I added 3 kinds of white beans and a can of corn with peppers to it. I also added green chilis and more cumin.  These additions made it taste more like chili and less like enchilada sauce. Served with queso fresco cheese and sour cream. LOVED IT! I called it Grinch's Green Chili.

Thanks for posting this wonderful recipe.  This recipe sounds great as written.  However, I made a few changes based on what was available and what we needed for the menu.  I used pulled pork in lieu of ground pork. I turned this into more of a stew.  I used chicken broth in place of the water and red salsa and red enchilada sauce in place of green.  I doubled the amount of salsa and added corn and kidney beans.  I love the addition of flour; it added a nice body.  The spice combo in this recipe is terrific and adds a lot of dimension especially after I toasted them.   I can't wait to try this recipe exactly as written; I am sure it will be even more awesome than the version I conjured up!

Made this with the ground pork,  added the fire roasted tomatoes, with juice, 1 can rinsed and drained white kidney beans, and added more cumin and pepper. My jalapeno was a hot one, only added 1/2.  Reduced the liquid (chicken broth) to 2 cups.  Served it with brown rice.  We loved this! I would use pork cubes next time but the ground pork a less liquid made this ready in less than 30 minutes.

I absolutely love this recipe and have made it multiple times. I do use chicken broth instead of water, and I also top it with some tortilla chips and Monterey Jack  or pepper Jack cheese, when I plate it. .  It is very delicious. The last time I made it I made it with ground turkey. It was also just as delicious.   It is wonderful also to have some avocados and sour cream on the side that you can enjoy with the dish.  People don’t understand that because this dish is called chili, it is not traditional chili. Chili is the term used for Hispanic cooking when you are using peppers. The base of this is green chili peppers. This is not chili as you would think of traditional chili.

Outstanding recipe! Very easy but oh so tasty!! I had never made green chili before so had no idea what it was supposed to taste like. It was a request from my son and he said it was really good! Thank you!!

Tip: It's chile not chili. Chili is like the stew you get in Texas with meat and beans. Otherwise it's Green Chile or Red Chile.

Made this many times now using leftover pulled pork. All time family favorite. On serving, fresh squeezed lime a must. Super!

This was great! I used more lime juice and salt (personal preference), and I diced the jalapenos rather than leaving them whole like the recipe seems to imply. Served with cheese, sour cream, avocado, and warm flour tortillas. Yum!

This is my go-to green chili stew recipe; like so many others I've added my own twist, and from time to time change the meat type around.  I usually use chopped up pork short ribs or pork stew meat and once the recipe is finished on the stove, I'll put it into the crock pot on low for several hours until the meat is broken down.  What I do to add a bit more sustenance to the recipe is add about 6-8 roasted hatch chili's (mild for me) to the recipe and instead of the jalapeno's I use two roasted serrano peppers with seeds and veins removed.  I've entered this version in two cook-off's and this recipe won both times; was the only one scraped off the bottom of the crock pot.  It's a winner.  Make sure you roast your spices first, it enhances the flavor.

Delicious. Only change was that I used whole pork. Would have used roast but had some chops on hand so I put them in a slow cooker and used that. Mmmmm

I made this this evening for dinner.  I also made some alterations.  I used chicken stock plus 2 cups water in place of water.  I also only used half of the can of green salsa.  I didn't take the meat out and set aside, or use butter and olive oil, so I was light on the fat.  
I have two in my family that can't handle a lot of heat, so the jalapeño and cayenne were omitted.  At the end, I used the half lime juice, but had no cilantro on hand.  I like cilantro, so wished I did.  We garnished with shredded cheddar cheese and tortilla chips.  We will definitely have this again.  I will add a can of pinto beans next time to give it a little more substance.  This was quick and easy.  The flavors were great.  I might also try corn masa  in place of the flour or corn meal.  
Again, this was good.  I am always looking for a great soup recipe.  Thank you!

Delicious!  I didn't have green salsa so I substituted one can of El Pato jalapeño salsa, and omitted lime juice.  I also added one can seasoned black beans and 2 cups lime cilantro rice to make a thicker soup.

OMG, this was absolutely delicious, and so easy to make. I admit I made some changes though. (1) Used 1 can chicken broth instead of water. (2) Added 2 cans of pinto beans (rinsed and drained), (3) Purchased 1.5 lb pork roast and cut it into chunks, and (4)1 can diced tomatoes, along with 1/2T cumin and 1/2 T paprika. 
Yummy! Made amazing left overs too.

We use leftover pork roast and add a couple cans of white beans to make it much more like chili and really stretch the meal out.  I freeze half the batch. I know people hate it when you rate recipes highly if you change them, but I honestly never would have thought of making a broth out of enchilada sauce, so major kudos to the original poster for the recipe!

Made this tonite and my husband had 2 helpings!! I added 1 diced potato to give it more substance, a little more spices and crushed red pepper flakes for more of a kick. I also put chicken broth and 2 cups water, which gave it better flavor. It's a keeper!!
