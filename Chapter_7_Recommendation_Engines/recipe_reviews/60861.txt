Excellent stuff! I didn't use caraway seeds; because some of the reviews said the bread lacked flavor I added two teaspoons of sea salt to the dough and topped the egg wash with something different on each loaf. One each plain, sesame seeds, garlic powder, rosemary, thyme, celery seed, dried minced onion and Mrs. Dash tomato basil garlic mix. The bread was soft and yummy, we enjoyed it very much! Took a little over 30 minutes total in the oven. Update: Made this again, this time I topped with dried minced garlic (used only egg white for the wash). I convect baked at 325 for 18 minutes. Yum!

I made this last night to go with hummus.  It was fantastic.  I made it two different ways.  One I put in my bread machine on dough cycle.  The other I did by hand.  Both turned out the same.  However, I did mess up the first recipe by accidently adding the egg to the dough. Produced a denser bread but still good.  I suggest adding herbs and spices right to the dough mix.  I added onion and tarragon to one mix the other was spicy garlic.  FANTASTIC!  If you want thin loaves, use your pasta machine.  I made all of mine single serving cut dough into 10.  This is a staple in my recipe box. SUPER easy.  I am going to try wheat flour next.

Ok, I admit I got in a hurry after I came home from grocery shopping, didn't pay attention, and added the egg to the dough and almost all of the water upfront.  Nevertheless, these turned out great.  I patted (rarely use a rolling pin) them very thin and sprinkled with a mixture of toasted sesame seeds and a bit of kosher salt before baking (did use the egg wash).  I baked them on a stone, and they are nice and crispy outside witha bit of soft fluff inside.  They'll go perfectly with my veggie curry tonight!  Thank you for the recipe...adding to my recipe box now...oh, and I also used a half and half mixture of AP flour and white whole wheat.

WOW! This recipe is incredible and easy! I made it for a school project and everyone loved it and was asking for more. Of course, it is best right out of the oven, but still quite good days later. Might want to add just a little more salt if you like it. Overall, a wonderful recipe!

The caraway seeds really make this bread tasty.  My bread rose a lot more than it should have - making it look more like western-style buns.  I'm not sure how to keep the bread flat with all that yeast.  Tasty nonetheless.

This is easy to make and tastes really good. It makes pretty big breads so sometimes I make mine smaller but if you make them too small they can get hard.

I never made bread and it was very easy and delicious.  I substituted sesame seeds for caraway seeds.

Will not make again.  Quick and easy; however, the texture(crumb)is NOT like the Afghanistan bread I get from an Afghanistan restaurant.  This bread is more like regular white bread with a crunchy outside.

I served this bread for the first time with soup, expecting it to be not quite so flat as it is.  It is a nice bread, and still is  a nice compliment to soups, but I agree with the user who said that adding some spices would really give it some life.

kind of plain on it's own, but i think it's supposed to be like that - we ate it with curry, dipping it in the liquid. delicious!

this has got to be the easiest and best bread recipe i have used. a hint for all bread is to use the "better for bread" flour, by the way. my husband was deployed in afghanistan for a year and recalls many nights eating with the natives and says this bread tastes so similar. he says this one rises more and over there, they would just make one HUGE loaf.. but it was a big hit with him and his work buddies. i will use this one again!!!

This bread was good but, a little too bland for my taste.  I think next time I will give it more time to rise and maybe add some spices to the mix next time.  It need's something.

Great Recipe. I used Sesame seeds instead of caraway seeds, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. It came out great with a nice soft center and crisp crust.

If you have a KA it will take no effort at all to make this bread.  It is a plain, basic, white bread but it had good texture, appearance, and would be the perfect accompaniment to any dish that was spicy as it wouldn’t overpower or complete with the flavors.

The naan itself was yummy, but the texture was nothing like an Afghani naan.... Maybe cooking it on the stove would be a better alternative vs baking them? They turn out too crispy...

I made it with bread flour which usually makes better breads, but it came out with a weird texture.  It was also very bland. Next time I will try it with all purpose flour and add more salt.

This is the closest I think I could ever get to Afghani bread. The recipe is easy and fast to put together. I read the reviews before beginning and many people suggested adding a bit more salt. I thought I'd stick to the original recipe but now that it's done I wish i would have added more salt. I think I'll try again in the future and I will definitely add more salt.

Great and very easy recipe, just needed more salt, and very versatile to add different herbs and spices. I like to bake it so it's still soft so then I can reheat for subsequent meals without it getting too hard.
