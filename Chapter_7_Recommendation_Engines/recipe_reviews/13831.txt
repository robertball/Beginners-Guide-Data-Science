Excellant.  Doesn't look that attractive but tastes delicious.  I would recommend using any mixture of apples, other than granny smith.  When I used Granny Smith apples they were too tart for the dumpling cake topping and didn't soften up enough while baking.  I also used only 1/2 of the oil called for and substituted applesauce for the other half.  Tasted delcious and cut down on the fat.

This recipe was so easy to make!  I couldn't believe that I actually made it.  It's something that I would expect to get at a bakery.  The ingrediants are so simple.  I didn't have to go out to buy anything.  It was just too easy to make and it tasted great...but a little greasy.  I used 3/4 cup of oil instead of 1 cup and I also sprinkled a little cinnamon and brown sugar on the apples before I poured the mixture over it.

I read the previous reviews and made it according to the recipe instructions. If I had been able to find organic Mac's, I would have left the peels on - but unfortunately could not find organic apples and peeled the apples. The recipe went together quickly. I used 1/2 cup applesauce, 1/2 cup oil and cooked it uncovered for 45 minutes. This could not have turned out any better! It came out just right - not too moist - and not overdone! Thank you so much for helping make my Christmas brunch a little brighter!!!

L..ove this recipe. So easy, so simple to make. I used macintosh apples, because I like the sweet tart taste. [FILLED THE 9X13 DISH 3/4 FULL WITH THICK SLICES because of the settling of the apples cooking.] I did make a change to the liquid part of the recipe, because I do not use vegetable oil. I substituted 1/2 cup of melted Butter[1 stick] and added it to a 1/2 cup of Canola oil. It looked very oily, so I added 1/3 cup more of sifted flour, just enough so it was not sliding around the bowl, but still wet looking. I crumbled the wet dough on top of the apples and baked. The aroma was heavenly, and the topping was the most beautiful golden brown and flakey.[Forgot to pat down the batter]. We really enjoyed the taste and texture of this recipe. Thank you Amy S. for this "Recipe Box Keeper". PS. Apple Pie Spice added a nice touch to my apples for my second Apple Dumpling Cake.

This was delicious! I also modified this recipe by using 1/2 canola 1/2 applesauce instead of 1 cup vegetable oil. I also tossed the apples with cinnamon, brown sugar and a litte white sugar as well as about a tablespoon of butter shavings before covering with the batter. This made the apples very moist and tender. I used 1/2 empire and half golden delicious apples. Perfect!

Excellent cake! My husband loved it - said it's a cross between a pie and a cake. I used a combination of Mutsu and Macintosh apples. Also sprinkled a mixture of 2 Tbsp. sugar and 1 tsp. cinnamon over the top before baking. Very tasty - I'll be making this often.

This recipe is relatively easy to make. After preparing the apples, my 2 and a half year old helped me measure and mix the rest of the ingredients. She loved pressing the mix into the apples. The house smelled wonderful as it baked. Next time I will substitute some applesauce for half the oil because it seemed a bit greasy. It tastes similiar to apple crisp but not as sweet.

I made this using zucchini instead of apples. Make sure you peel and cut the seeds out. Then slice as you would apples. I have so many in the garden and these cobbler/ dumpling recipes are great for them. I also mixed the cinnamon with some brown sugar and a pinch of salt into the zucchini then spread in the pan. It is a great dessert so fast and easy. We loved the dumpling crust! Thanks Amy!

This was delicious, and so easy. I cut the recipe in half and in half again, since I was cooking for 2, and cooked it in a 1.5 qt casserole dish-- cooking time was about 30 minutes for me. I used 1 large apple, which I put in a baggie with sugar, brown sugar and cinnamon to coat, as suggested by previous reviewers. I substituted half the oil with applesauce. I did a layer of apples in the bottom of the dish, poured a little batter in, then did the rest. It came out terrific! Definitely will be making this again.

This does not pour at all. I added some cinnamon to the batter and subbed applesauce for half the oil after reading the reviews. The cake part of this is very thick and had to be flattened into the apples. It tasted like flour anyway. I was disappointed after reading some of the reviews of how good it was. Thanks anyway.

Cut recipe in half.  My boyfriend and I aren't big eaters.

Tossed apples with cinnamon and sugar as suggested by others.  Topped with a little more sugar and cinnamon. 

Sprinkled some brown sugar and butter slivers on top before baking. 

Very good!  Will make again.  Good warm!

This turned out really well. The topping has a nice crunch, it's very apple-y (I used Cortland apples), and I added a bit more cinnamon than called for.  I also did not peel the apples, just washed really well and cut the apples by hand into relatively thick slices. I cut the slices with apple skin into quarters, so there wouldn't be long strands of apple skin--and that worked very well. I do hate throwing out the skins of fruits/vegetables when it can be avoided--especially when there's quite a bit of nutrition to be had there.  It was moist, tasty, crunchy on top, very easy to make and did not require much cleanup.  Who could ask for more?

This is so delicious!  I made a small pan the first time. So, 2 days later I made it again and just doubled it. I just used a variety of apples to mix it up a bit, and sprinkled cinnamon sugar on the apples before I poured on the batter, and even topped the batter with more cinnamon sugar before putting it in the oven. This is so good, it is a keeper for sure!

This is indeed a wonderful recipe.  I made it according to the instructions mostly, except I used butter for most of the oil. I reduced the fat by 1/4 cup with no ill effects. I also sprinkled the apples with sugar and cinnamon as suggested by a previous reviewer. When I make this recipe again, I probably will NOT use extra sugar. I think I would enjoy the contrast between tart apples and the sweet topping.  I recommend this!

I made this recipe 3 times within a month over the holidays last year, and finally found this again on this site (I had forgotten what it was called!) This is an incredible dessert, and vanilla ice cream just makes it better. The pastry has so many textures within itself. A total delight.

Easy and delicious! I made it as I had everything on hand and needed a quick recipe. I used 1/2 cup of applesauce and reduced the oil by 1/2 cup. All the ladies loved it at the party!!

This was delicious!  I used Granny Smith apples so sprinkled brown sugar and cinnamon on them before I put the batter on top.  I took it to our church potluck....small church....and came home with 2 servings!  It was a hit!

Wow....I was surprised how wonderful this was! I used fresh apples off the tree, so I have no clue what variety they were, but they worked perfectly. Apples were soft and the topping was superb....would go great with ice cream. Thanks!

I made this twice in the same weekend because it got eaten up right away and both times it was quick to prepare and came out marvelously. It almost tastes like a sugar cookie mixed with apple and I like how there is no butter or Margarine. Thank you for posting this!

This is a very easy, yet delicious recipe.  I cut the recipe in half & baked it in a 9" baking dish.  The next time I make it, I won't cut it in half.  It's also very good served warm with milk.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it couldn't be easier.  I was nervous about a cup of oil but I guess it works.  I will try this again as we had so much food no one got around to eating it that day.  My husband ended up with it the rest of the week and said it was very good.

The recipe was easy to make.  The taste was not as I expected.  We did not think it tasted like apple dumplings and there was only 2 pieces missing from the cake pan,  had to throw the rest out.

Yum! Used half brown sugar half white sugar, 3/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup oil. I tossed the apples in sugar and cinnamon before placing in the pan. Next time I'll try try adding butter shavings to the apples to soften them up more. I used apples from our tree and they didn't get as soft as I'd like. Hubby said it was like a pie and cake put together!

Super easy and good.  I am always looking for ways to use up apples.  It seems like my boys constantly buy them at the grocery store and forget that we have them after a day or two. Then, it is up to me to find creative ways to use up 8 - 10 apples in a day.  This cake was easy to make and delicious to eat.  Perfect!

Very delicious! I used half whole wheat pastry flour and would probably use all whole wheat pastry flour next time. I substituted rapadura for the sugar and for the vegetable oil used half coconut oil and half applesauce. Mixed the apples with a little cinnamon and dotted with butter. I mixed  cinnamon and nutmeg right into the mix. Next time I make this, I would like to layer apples, mix, apples mix since it seemed the cake part on top was a little too thick. Will definitely be making this one again!

Great cake that is super moist and not overly sweet.  Made this a few times. Use any type of apples except the bitter ones.  No granny smith or such.  Fuji apples are my preference but any others will do. Easy and delicious. The top will look bumpy but I serve with a dollop of cinnamon whipped cream.

Mine turned out like an apple crisp but none-the-less it was delicious.  I did include other reviewer's suggestions (mixed the apple slices in cinnamon & brown sugar; cut in butter to the flour mixture). Thank you for the very tastey recipe. **** just made this again & this time I added a can of cherry pie filling over the fresh apple slices. It was a hit *again*

WONDERFUL!!!  I gave 4 stars because I did adapt it a bit due to reviews.  I mixed together a bit of sugar, a bit of flour, and a generous sprinkle of cinnamon then stirred up the apples in it, used a bit less sugar in the cake mix, and mixed a little sugar with the cinnamon for the topping.  It reminds me a bit of snickerdoodles on top of apples, hubby says it's sort of like an apple coffee cake.  I used apples I got at the farmers market, can't remember what type they are but they're definitely tart & firm.

This cake is simple and very tasty in an old-fashioned way.  I made it with my two girls, ages 2 and 4.  They were able to help with all of it after peeling and slicing the apples.  The only thing I changed the second time around was not sprinkling the cinnamon on top before baking.  It burned!  Instead, I mixed it into the apple slices.

I was looking for something quick,I had a bunch of apples in the house and needed to do something with them and i came across this recipe.I followed everything to the recipe,The only thing that i did different was toss the apples in brown sugar,vanilla and cinammon and let them sit for about ten minutes before adding it to my baking pan...It make a difference.This was a family favorite and the have beena sking me to make it all the time now.

The one negative about this recipe that i'm going to change when i make this again is the cup of oil was too much and it made the top a little too crunchy.

I used Empire, Mutsu, and Gala apples. For the flour I used 1 cup whole wheat pastry flour and 1 cup all-purpose flour. 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup vegetable oil. Also sprinkled a little nutmeg into the flour mixture. Quick, easy, & good.

This was a very good type of cake/cobbler... I didn't have cinnamon, but still wanted the top crust to have a little something extra! So, I topped it with Brown Sugar! It made a wonderful sweet crust to the top!  Tasted GREAT served with Vanilla Ice Cream!!!!! Perfect for fall!

Yummy.  Easy to make.  Very versatile.  This is excellent with breakfast too.  I only used 1 cup of sugar.  Still plenty sweet.  I also substituted apple sauce for the oil.  Still very tasty.

Delicious and easy to make! I made a few changes ... sprinkle cinnamon and sugar on the apples after placing them in the pan. Use 1/2 cup of butter and 1/2 cup apple sauce instead of the oil, and chop up some apple to add to the batter. This makes it very light and almost fluffy, with a lovely apple flavour...

This was really good.  I didn't know what to expect but was happy with it.  My husband doesn't like apple crisp, so I thought I would try it.  Well he loved it!!  It was really easy and I used 1/2 oil and 1/2 butter and added a little vanilla to the batter. I also put cinnamon and sugar on the apples.  I mistakenly also added cinnamon to the batter instead of on top.  It was still good though.  Next time I will use macintosh as the apples I had were kind of bland.

This was really good Amy.  Does not have an overly sweet taste.  I used motts apples. I would use Granny Smith or Red Delicious next time.  (we did not care for the motts apples too soft and we needed to use them up).  A good firm apple is best for this recipe.  Was very good and definitely a keeper.  Thanks Amy for the quick and easy recipe.                                                                                                  Oh MY I am keeping my previous post in here but I had to say that Amy I had cut too many apples and had to mix up a 2nd batch.  Everyone really loved the first one.  But my youngest devoured the second one.  He started picking at it bit by bit till nothing was left.  This was in a 9/13 pan and he had it gone in a day.

Definite keeper!  We didn't change a thing other than for using freshly ground whole wheat flour.  We may decrease the sugar next time and try using butter instead of the oil, but didn't find any sort of oily taste as others had mentioned.  My family felt it tasted like snickerdoodles over apples.  YUM!

My family loved this!! I added 1/2 cup butter (we don't like the oily taste at all) and a splash of milk. Sprinkled the apples with sugar and cinnamon before pouring the batter as others said. I was a BIT worried while baking this, some of the apples didn't remain at the bottom of the dish and had to bake it a lot longer. Then i thought it would turn out mushy.... well, it was worth all my suffering!!! it's very moist and tasty. I chose golden apples, but just try to use ripe fruit!!!!!

This is a great recipe.  I added apple pie spice to the apples and extra cinnamon to the batter.  Then sprinkled with cinnamon sugar before baking.  Everyone says it is a keeper.  I also used all unsweetened applesauce in place of the oil.  I may consider splenda in place of the sugar next time.

This recipe is a keeper, no question.  I modified the recipe a bit.  I placed on elayer of apple slices in the dish, topped with a mixture of brown and white sugar, then pats of butter.  Another layer of apples, more sugar, butter, and so on, then the dough.  TOO MUCH BUTTER!  That's my own fault though, and I factored that in when rating the recipe.  Next time I will make it to the letter, and mess with changes from then on.

One more thing. I used both washington and mcintosh apples.  The washington apples really took away from the recipe.  They are bland.  mcintosh are much better.  More fruity tasting.

Still, all 4 people that ate this recipe loved it, so it's a winner, and will go to my favorites box.

I made this recipe for a family dinner. They have not stopped raving about it. They keep asking when I'm making it again. I put some cinnamon and sugar on the apples and used half applesauce and water so it wouldn't be to greasy. It was great. My family would rather have the apple dumpling cake instead of applte pie.

I made this as one of our Thanksgiving desserts today.  It had a wonderful aroma while cooking and really lived up to its smell!  I served it warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream - yummy!
I did substitute one half cup of oil with applesauce and also sprinkled cinnamon and sugar over the apples before covering with batter.  Such a warm, delicious dessert!

I love apple dumplings and this recipe takes all the work out of making that but with the very same result.  I left the peels on the Fuji apples and sprinkles some cinnamon on the apples prior to topping.  It just added to the flavor.

This is a great recipe, extremely easy to prepare.  I did add some ground nutmeg and ground cloves to the apples prior to pressing the batter into the apples.  

Very good when served with a dollop of whipped cream on top served warm.

I mixed the apples with cinnamon and brown sugar and I added just a little bit of almond and vanilla extract.  I had a bag of honey crisp apples to use, and they were perfect.

It sure tastes good; I love the crispy topping.  I had only a cup and a half of applesauce and two pears, so I put it all in the pan, and added a good helping of cinnamon before putting on the topping.  Delicious right out of the oven.  I'll be making this again.

Kids had a delayed opening at school today, so i had 1.5hrs. I looked at my red delicious apples and  logged into allrecipes. Found this recipe,  made it, and drove to work (15 minutes away). Everyone loved it. Now I'm making one for dessert tonight. Thank you for an awesome treat!

This is a good (and quick) alternative to apple pie. I followed the suggestion of other reviewers and only added 1/2 cup of oil and it came out fine. I also took a 1/2 cup of the sugar and mixed it with the apples with some cinnamon and then added the remaining sugar to the flour as instructed  -  this created a nice balance of sweetness in both layers. Everyone loved it!

I loved it.  Added two tsp vanilla to batter.  Next time will grease pan.  Yes, it stuck a bit. A dollop of plain yogurt balanced the sweetness, too.  Enjoy.

This has an interesting topping but turned out so yummy! I used half sugar and half brown sugar as well and loved the results. Homey comfort food. I love cinnamon apples so I sprinkled a little cinnamon and brown sugar (like a tablespoon)

Loved it! After reading other reviews, I sprinkled the (granny smith)apples with apple pie spice (no brown sugar added and glad I didn't as it was sweet enough)and where it calls for 1 cup of oil I replaced 1/2 cup of oil with applesauce. I think the cake topping would be amazing with other fruits as well (cherries, peaches, yummm). It turned out perfect!

I thought this was very good and from all the different reviews, you can tell it is very forgiving.  I have a suggestion:  Maybe all the variances have to do with the type apple and how thickly they are sliced. My favorite apples are Pink Lady and Honey Crisp, but I used one called Tango which was just okay, thinly sliced and layered.  i did the thing with 1/2 apple sauce and 1/2 oil and mine was not the least bit greasy. In fact, I made a carmel sauce to squiggle across the top to make it sweeter and gooyer, but it would be good without it, in fact, it would be great for breakfast or brunch, so dont count it out if it doesnt fit your bill for a desert.  I will be making it again, Im sure.

Made this last night. The topping is amazing! It tastes like snickerdoodle cookies. I tossed the apple slices with brown sugar, cinnamon and vanilla extract before putting them in the dish. Next time I think I'll add a little lemon juice too. Great recipe! :)

This was really good however I really thought it was missing something.  Maybe brown sugar? Next time I will make Apple Crisp in the crock pot as I think I like it better.

I have made this several times, my family loves it.  I have found that sprinkling a little sugar and cinnamon on the apples improves their taste a lot.  I then cut about 1/4 c. sugar from the topping.

I must say this was so easy and very good! I made it just like it said to and it turned out great! I came across this recipe about 9:30pm and was rubbing my belly at 10:30pm! LOL! My guy loved it but said it was too rich and so he needed a scoop of ice cream and a glass of milk! Thanks for sharing!

My husband and I just loved this cake. Goes great with vanilla ice cream!  I made some tweaks. I only used 3/4 cup of canola oil. I poured a 1/4 tablespoon of melted butter and sprinkled brown sugar and cinnimon on the apples. I put a teaspoon of vanilla in the batter. Once the batter was on the apples I sprinkled brown sugar on top along with the cinnimon. It turned out great. I will be making it more often.

I was always afraid to bake with apples.  I don't know why.  This was very easy and very delicious!  Serve warm with vanilla ice cream.  I won't be afraid to bake with apples again, and will be making this for company.

This recipe is great!  I did follow the advice of some of the other reviews by using only 1/2 the cup of oil and applesauce for the other half cup and sprinkling sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon and bits of butter on top of the apples before pouring the batter over top.  I also decided to add a couple teaspoons of vanilla to the batter before pouring over the apples.  Everyone loved it.  Thanks for the awesome recipe!

I was skeptical to making this recipe because it was so simple, but once I did and tried it.. I LOVED IT. I did find that it was a bit too sweet, but that could be because of the apples I used. It's wonderful the next morning as well! DELICIOUS! Definatly a keeper! Thank you!

My husband, who hates apple desserts has just declared this the best apple dessert he's ever had. And that's saying something! Following some other reviewers, I used half butter, half oil, and half brown sugar, half white. I also chopped the apples and tossed them with a little sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg before putting them in the pan. Will definitely make this again.

I love the simplicity of this dessert; served warm with whipped cream, it was a hit.  I did decrease the oil to 1/2 cup and added 1/2 cup applesauce instead.  I used 4 large Braeburn apples and tossed the slices with flour, sugar and cinnamon.  Adding a little cinnamon to the dry ingredients helped too.

I made this quickly one night for our family meal at church - when my mother asked me for the recipe I knew it was "really" good.  I did add about 1/3 cup of sugar, 1 Tbs. of cornstarch and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to the apples before putting them in the pan.  Then I cut back on the cinnamon I put on the topping.  Yum.

Excellent recipe. I made two batches with 3 lbs of apples between them (just as good but I bet the full set of apples is even better). One I made with butter instead of oil and a tiny bit of apple sauce as well as 50% barley flour, it was rich and dense, quite nice. The second I made with almost all apple sauce and a tiny bit of butter with a light flour, it was fluffy and light and sweet. Both were excellent.

This was really good, granted I did make a few changes. I used half whole wheat flour/half white flour, 1/2 cup of raw sugar (instead of 1 1/2 cups), 1/2 cup margarine and 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce (in place of the oil), and spinkled about 1 tablespoon of raw sugar and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon over the apples before covering them with the batter, also. It's not very sweet (considering I used 1/3 of the sugar suggested), but that's just how we like it! I used organic Braeburn apples.

This was one of the nicest, moist and tasty cakes I've ever made. I did substitute the oil for butter and apple sauce but otherwise followed the recipe fully. The cake was so flavoursome and looked great. It's very easy to make and only takes 40 minutes to cook! Definitley worthy of 5 starts!!

Excellent ---had a good crunch topping.
I put a little apple pie spice with the apples.   We ate it in a hurry.   Good hot/warm and cold too.

This was delicious!  My brother who hates sweets loved this and even had a second helping!!  I did swith half the oil for unsweetened apple sauce as other reviewers suggested.  I may add a little more cinnamon next time on top of the apples, but other than that this dish was fantastic!

This was easy and tasty.  I added some vanilla to the dough, and sprinkled the top with cinnamon and raw sugar.  Next time I will add cinnamon to the apples, and put a little bit of dough in between the layers of apples.

This was ok, not very pretty. I did follow the advicce of other reviewers as I usually do try to cut unneeded fats. I used half oil, half applesauce. I probably wont make again, I like apple crisp better and they take about the same amount of work.

I was so excited to make this cake after all the great reviews, but it just didnt live up to my expectations. The cake part was good but the apples needed some cinammon and sugar on them. I think I'm a bigger fan of the traditional cake where you put the apples in the batter. I cut the oil to 3/4c. This recipe didnt taste bad, it just wasnt anything great.

This is a very easy and tasty apple recipe.  In order to make it low fat, I substituted egg whites for the whole eggs and 1 C apple sauce for the oil.  It is still very good.  I'll definitely be making this one again.  Thanks!

This is delicious!  Made this last night as dessert for "Build-Your-Own'Sub" night, 5 kids (2 were kids' friends); 2 adults.  I followed the previous reviewer MaMaDC and sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on the apple before the batter.  The house smelled heavenly; everyone kept asking what it was.  I used 3 lbs of Macintosh apples.  I think next time I'll use tablespoons to dollop the batter, as I made it first and it was thick.  Didn't affect the taste, still wonderful.  We didn't have ice cream or whipped topping, so we topped it with milk.  Can't wait to try it with french vanilla ice cream!   It's going into my recipe file for a regular in this house's menu rotation.

This was a really easy recipe. I had a strong desire to add something to the apples before I cooked it but I decided to follow the instructions and it turn out great.  Its not overly sweet and tastes great with whip cream. This is a dessert for a Pot Luck dinner.

Never tasting Apple Dumplings I was a bit nervous. Most of my friends are vegetarian, so I used Vanilla flavored yogurt instead of the eggs, (3 tbs to each egg). I served this at a couples Baby Shower in the Fall. I baked it for 45 minutes and covered it in aluminum foil and let it sit for 4 hours....it was warm and delicious! They all loved it!

This recipe is WONDERFUL!!!! It was a huge hit at three Thanksgiving dinners, and my neighbor's house. Very Easy. I cheated and used dried apples that I simply rehydrated. I'm doing this one again for Christmas, FOR SURE!!!!

It is greasy, not much flavor on the apples since the sugar is in  the crust and the cinnamon (not mixed with sugar) is on the crust.  I won't be making this anymore.

My husband and I loved this cake.  After browsing other ideas, I mixed 1/2 cup sugar and 1 tsp cinnamon together and then mixed in with the apples.  And I used 1/2 cup melted butter and 1/2 cup oil.  We will definitely make this again.

I made the error of using apples that i had on hand. If I decide to make this dish again in the future, I will definitely make a special trip to the store to ensure i get my fave apples.

It came out so perfect I couldn’t believe it! I used only 3/4 cup oil, added some warm milk and 3 tablespoons of coconut flour. I also sprinkled some brown sugar and cinnamon onto the apples.

This recipe is exceptional!!! My family loves it and I make it for every occasion!! Although instead of slicing the apples I recommend dicing them into 1 inch squares. And the recipe taste great if you dust it of with pumpkin pie spice.

I followed one of the reviewers and used 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup oil to make this more moist and healthier. We loved it!

I made this in a round cake pan because I only wanted enough for my hubby and me. I used Gala apples which were very sweet. I only used 1/2 cup sugar and half the  flour and oil. Delicious. I cannot imagine using 1 1/2 cups sugar in this dish. Came out beautifully and was very tasty.

I also substituted a stick of butter and a few tablespoons of coconut oil for the vegetable oil. At the last minute, I sprinkled a dusting of ground walnuts.  Really great taste!

This has to be excellent recipe for me. Very easy to make. I used a Teflon  pan and sprayed it with some Pam not sure that it wouldn't stick Used brown sugar instead of white. No oil used Applesauce. Used Apple Pie Spice tasted it the way i wanted it to be. If to much add extra sugar.  more . It puffed up like recipe said. Checking to see when i pulled it out from Oven Apples were done.Did not peel the apples either. I am not a baker but so proud it came out great. Next time i'll flip the pan over and it looks like Apple pie with the  apples on  top . Going to make this again.** By all means use the Apple Sauce**.

Very Good!
Followed the recipe, but the batter was too thick so I added one more egg,  and it turned out great.  You need to use tart apples for flavor.  I made a light brown sugar sauce to drizzle over it when served.
I microwaved the apples in the dish for 3 mins. on high before covering with batter to bake.  Only took 30 mins. & it was nicely browned.

This is delicious! I used half butter, half oil in the topping. I mixed some sugar, cinnamon, ground cloves, and nutmeg with the apples. Super easy especially for such a tasty end result.

To say this was delicious and a successful breakfast/desert is an understatement! Nothing was wrong at all with the dumpling cake, and it was one of the most favorited meals for Thanksgiving. You definitely need to try this if your thinking about it!

I have a very similar recipe.  It has been enjoyed in our family for many years.  We use applesauce, either homemade or from a jar.  Nutmeg is sprinkled on the top of the applesauce.  We also add milk and vanilla, which gives the spreading quality you want when pouring over the applesauce.

I made this for Sunday dessert. I was going to do apple pie, but wanted to try something different. PERFECT CHOICE!!!! My family and co-workers loved it. Being a seasoned cook, I don't measure, after the first try. I just season to taste. But I used white sugar, brown sugar,cinnamon, nutmeg,vanilla,and lemon juice on my apples and I used Johnathan Apples. AWSOME.... Even have a couple of orders for Thanksgiving...

I used a 3 lb bag of apples because I didn't think I would be able to estimate how many apples make 3 lbs....I had so so much apple, I didn't even use them all and ended up making applesauce with the rest.  As far as the recipe goes, my batter just stayed on top and when I tried to remove the cake from the pan, most of the apples stayed in the bottom.  Evidently, I still used too many

I'm not sure what I did wrong, but mine turned out like a crumble and the top layer was like a cookie. The batter also wasn't pourable, it was like a crumbly dough.  I followed the recipe as is.

This is yummy!  I used half brown & half white sugar, half melted butter and half oil, sprinkled sugar & cinnamon on apples before I put the dough on them, and then again on top of the dough.  It's very simple and very good.

This is a really yummy apple dessert! I made it pretty much as directed except used 1/2  c. unsweetened applesauce & 1/2 c. canola oil instead of using 1 c. of oil. Also, per some reviews, I really loaded up on the apples (thinly sliced) and glad I did, because they always cook down and there was plenty of the cake topping. Couldn't imagine serving this without a scoop of vanilla ice cream either! Everyone loved this dessert!! Will definitely make it again.

Delicious! Everyone loves when I bring this for dessert! I try using Granny Smith apples because it gives a nice tart flavor,  but only when organic.  (Today was the first time I couldn't find organic GS at Whole Foods so I used organic Fuji instead) I also substitute oil with applesauce, as it is healthier and adds to the flavor, and I use more apples than the recipe calls for, which adds body. Today's batch is for a large lunch crowd tomorrow, so it needs plenty of volume. Thanks for this great recipe!

Followed recipe except sprinkled cinnamon and sugar over the apples. Very good, tasted a lot like apple dumplings. We ate with milk for breakfast, but will have with French vanilla ice cream for dessert.

Very good and easy to make.  I did add brown sugar directly on the apples before adding topping.  I used Granny Smith and they were very tart.  It was a hit at my home.

I made a half recipe of this and put it into an 8"x8" pan.  Because I wanted a lot of fruit, I did use 7 medium sized apples.  I wanted to avoid the cake being greasy so I substituted 1/2 of the oil with apple butter.  We liked this quite a bit and plan to make it again.

Good fresh out of the oven but once cooled and settled, wasn't too good. I did use Granny Smith's and they were pretty sour. The good side of this recipe is that it is easy, but I probably won't make it again.

This was very tasty but I should have followed with other reviewers to put less oil. I thought I would choke on all that grease! I will put 1/2 cup butter next time without oil. Also apples were abit firm for my liking so I think next time I will bake the apples separately and then add the topping later. But very good in general

I love this cake!  It was so delicious and my whole family loved it!  The only thing I did differently was I added a bit of pumpkin pie spice to the cinnamon before putting it on the cake.  Otherwise, it's perfect as it is!

Made this yesterday, for a senior luncheon. Used a bag of Macintosh (not very ripe!) as that's what was on hand. I did follow some reviewer's suggestions and coated the apples with Cinn Sugar. Also, for health reasons, I used 1/2cp canola + 1/2cp cinn apple sauce. Appearance-wise, this is Not a pretty cake and the topping was like spreading road tar! Thank goodness, it did receive good reviews. We served warm with maple walnut ice cream on top. This is a simple recipe that I Will make again.

The cake was delicious. My only tweak was to rub the apples lightly in a mixture of cinnamon, sugar and nutmeg (which was also sprinkled on top of the cake before and after baking). Delicious! I would add a picture but it's pretty much gone!

This is an easy recipe, but I made some changes.  Use 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce and 2 different apples for an extra flavor.  I put butter pats on top with the cinnamon (Siagon). Wonderful!  Thank You Amy S.

Tried this because of the good reviews.  OK on the first day but a little boring - needs something, maybe powdered sugar on top or nuts.  I don't like to give anything but positive compliments and encouragement but felt I had to warn others. As I said, okay the first day but quickly deteriorates after that.

Loved this!  The only changes I made were to add some brown sugar on top of the apples and to top the batter with cinnamon sugar.  Very good!  Loved the apples, they were tender and sweet and the "dumpling" part was really tasty!  I will definitely make again.

No way. This was not good. I mean if you want some dry cake with apple on the bottom then this is it. I added brown sugar to the apples and nutmeg.It still was lacking. What a waste of my good apples!!!!!

I loved the look of this recipe.  My topping looked like tiny crumble pieces...not like the picture that is posted.  It actually looked like something you'd buy at a bakery...beautiful!  However, I only gave this 4 stars b/c I think something needs to be added to the apples.  I added brown and white sugar, flour, cinnamon and lemon juice and it still wasn't a very sweet apple pie/crumble...it was a little bland.  That said, my apples weren't naturally sweet, but even with sweet apples, I think some sugar and spices would enhance this recipe. All in all, I was pleased when I ate it with vanilla ice cream...and my guests liked it too!

Loved this in its original form, just added cinnamon and sugar to the raw apples. Tried the variation with the applesauce in the crust-while it was tasty-it just wasn't the same.

Not bad but not excellent.  I, like others, used half the oil and half applesauce.  Definitely more like cake topped apples than apple dumplings.

This is a very good recipe. I used 13 apples (the equivalent to a 3-lb bag) and I think I'd add even more next time. I used the whole cup of oil and I think it was just fine and not oily. I would prefer the dough not to get as crunchy (like actual "dumplings"), but it was very tasty and I will probably make it again.

This cake was good, but not anything spectacular.  I think the flour topping was definitely missing something.  Do not eat this dish without a dollop of vanilla ice cream!

I thought this was pretty good. I expected more of a doughy, dumpling-style consistency for the topping. I took out 1/4 cup of oil and didn't use any apple sauce so that probably had something to do with it. With all of the "oily" comments I was afraid to use a full cup. I made it really quick in a pinch for a dinner party so I wouldn't be surprised if I did something wrong. It was still very good though.

This recipe is great! I made it exactly as directed and it turned out fabulous! Then I made it a second time and swapped out the oil for applesauce and it didn't turn out NEARLY as well. It still tasted okay, so for a low fat dessert it's possibly 3 stars.  But the next time I make it, I'll follow the directions exactly.  The topping was far better that way, and not at all greasy. Thanks for the recipe! It's a new favorite!

This is really good!  I followed others advice and sprinkled the apples with cinnamon and a bit of sugar and I reduced the oil to 1/4 cup and used 3/4 cup of applesauce to round out the cup.  Very, very yummy with vanilla ice cream on top.  I also just ate a bowl with milk on top and it was great!

I was not too pleased with this.  I think the oil made it too heavy.

All of my guests were doubting they could eat any dessert after dinner, but each one ate a huge serving of this w/French Vanilla ice cream on top.  I will definetely be making this again.  As others suggested, I tossed the apples with sugar and cinnamon and used 3/4 C. Applesauce and just 1/4 C. Oil.  It seemed a little dense to me, but everyone loved it.  Ice cream is a must.

I did not try this, but judging by my fiance's lack of keeping his hands off the stuff, I'd say this recipe deserves 5 stars!!!!

I just don't think this recipe was all that great.
I used less oil and could still taste it.  This recipe reminded me of my mother's apple upside-down
cake which is why I tried it.  I used Bakers Joy on
the pan and then sprinkled the bottom of pan with
cinnamon-sugar then put apples in and sprinkled the
apples with it again.  They were good.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it!  It was so easy to make and even easier to eat.  Serve warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  I will definitely be making this again.

I made this this evening for my father-in-law's birthday. My family devoured the whole thing. It was excellent and easy. I used Jonagold apples. I will definately make this again.
