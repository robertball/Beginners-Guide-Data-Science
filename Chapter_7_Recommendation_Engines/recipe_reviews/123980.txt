Not very attractive, but it sure tasted good!  Even the cabbage-hating Hubs told me to make a point of mentioning that he liked it. Kind of flavorless as written, however, so I added minced garlic, chopped onion, mixed-color bell peppers, and a good amount of Penzey's Fox Point seasoning. Oh -and I used prepackaged cole slaw mix which also added color and interest with its carrots and red cabbage.  Still, it's homely looking - this is definitely comfort food, not "company" food.

Great.  I added onions, and dried shitake mushrooms.  Sauteed the onions, green peppers and cabbage first.  Then after simmering added the cream cheese and the prepared mushrooms.  Also, I used Morton's Seasoned Salt in place of salt.

This has wonderful taste - but as previous reviewer naples34102 stated it is not pretty to serve.  Looks aside - the taste is very good.  I had to use red pepper as that is all I had.  It is a very quick dish to put together and it would be very good even without the cream cheese added.  My husband doesn't care for cream cheese, but did not mind it in this recipe.  We love cooked cabbage and I will be fixing this one again.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

If you don't like cabbage this recipe will change your mind. Cabbage can be exciting. Very creamy and great taste. Didn't last long.

I fixed this today for New Years Day, 2012.  Outstanding!!!   Even my non eating cabbage husband ate it.  I fixed it in 2 Tbsp. butter, salt, pepper, small amount of sugar and just a few tablespoons of water.  Just don't over cook.  I left ours a little crispy.  And must admit, I forgot to add the cream cheese at the end of cooking, so therefore, very good without it, lol!!! I wil try it again, with the cream cheese.  Very good!!  Thanks for posting.

Good but I think I went overboard with the cream cheese!  Don't drench it!  I even had so extra lettuce I needed to use and it mixed well.

I used olive oil instead of butter and fat free cream cheese to make this a great low fat treat. Dukan diet people, it'll fit into your menu nicely.

the cream cheese made it feel a little heavier than cabbage should be.

I tried this today.. it was quite a "shock" to my taste as I don't think I've ever had cabbage with cream cheese. It tasted fine, if a bit bland. Those who don't particularly like cabbage should find this fine as it doesn't taste "cabbagy". It was VERY filling also.. the cream cheese and butter make it quite rich. Not my favorite cabbage recipe, but I could see myself making it again. Thanks.
