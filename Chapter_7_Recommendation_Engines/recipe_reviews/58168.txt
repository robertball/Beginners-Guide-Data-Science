I am the one who submitted this recipe and I guess I was in a hurry because the introduction sounds like it was written by my 4 year old.  It should read: This is "a" quick and delicious snack...Sorry for the screw-up.

This pudding was a hit thanks. Thickened up beautifully and I had no lumps...even without using a whisk. Just keep stirring like mad. Have also tried this recipe with peppermint essence instead of the almond and it was divine! Kids want me to make it again.

Finally, an easy, straightforward chocolate pudding recipe! Of course, I  modified a little... Combo of almond milk and soy milk; used Sucanat instead of sugar and reduced to 3 Tbs; stirred in handful of Ghiradelli chips at the end and topped with slivered almonds and dried unsweetened coconut. Yum!

Very easy and very tasty!  To the person who complained that it didn't thicken up...cornstarch will break down if whisked (or stirred) too much.  The trick is to stir until it comes to a boil, cook no more than 2 minutes.  Cooking longer and stirring too much will cause it to thin.

The almond flavoring dominated the chocolate, masking all other flavors. Could not get it to thicken at all.  Will not be making again.

This was a cinch to put together, that's for sure.  I prepared this as written save for doubling up on the vanilla and omitting the almond which just didn't appeal to me. I used a very good quality cocoa  so it was deeply chocolate.  It had great chocolate flavor but something was missing; a smoothness, a richness, a silkiness. This was just, well, flat tasting.  And then it occurred to me - the recipe did not call for a little butter to be stirred in at the end with the vanilla as it typically is with cooked custards like this.  And it was deeply missed.

I had no trouble with this recipe. It thickened to a beautiful consistency and was very yummy. I had it on the table in 10 minutes flat. Next time I will experiment with different flavours: mint, rum, raspberry...

Just made this recipe and it was excellent. So easy.  I even lightened it up by using skim milk and splenda and it was delicious!

Very easy to whip up and tasty, I didn't have any problems getting this pudding to thicken and I thought the almonds were fine.  I put some sliced banannas on the top of mine.

This was excellent, super easy and very satisfying.  I used almond milk and just a drop of almond extract.  I liked the almond flavor and was very surprised that my five year old did, too! I thought it would be too "grown up" for her, but I was wrong.

If only I could give this 50 stars!  It really is that good!  I am not a chocolate fan but occasionally I do crave it.  I do love anything almond.  This is wonderful!  I made as instructed and used skim milk.  About half the cocoa was the dark kind because I didn't have enough of the regular.   I also added about 1/2 cup of flaked coconut that was on the verge of being old.  Yummy!

Outstanding! I started out on med-high heat, whisking constantly to shorten the cooking time. After cooking, continued whisking with the pot partially submerged in a bowl of ice-water. 10 minutes and we were eating room-temp chocolate with sliced strawberries. Was delicious even using skim milk. Couldn't even notice the almond flavour. I might double both vanilla & almond next time and see how that works. Thanks so much Josie!

This was really easy to make.   I added way too much chocolate.  My fault not the recipe.  I will cut back next time and there will be a next time.  I liked it better cold than warm.  But I usually don't like warm pudding.

Very chocolatey and yummy!  I made no changes to this recipe and it turned out great with no problems.  Place plastic wrap directly on the pudding to keep a skin from forming.   This is good either warm or cold!  Thank you Josie for a great chocolate pudding recipe!

My husband and I aren't very big on almond extract, so I just simply left it out. He said that it tasted just like the one his Mom used to make, except that she would serve it over cooked white rice, since none of the people in his family liked the regular rice pudding recipes. Fantastic recipe! Thanks a bunch for sharing!!!!  I will definately be making this quite often!

I just finished making this. This was dead simple and the BEST pudding I have ever had. I didn't change the recipe and it turned out perfect! I can't figure out why others complained about the flavor/ consistency! This set up beautifully and was smoooth and creamy...perfect..and I don't even really like pudding as a rule. I say Bravo!

Only slightly more work than a box mix, but much tastier.  Just dump, whisk, boil.  It took me probably less than ten minutes.  While this isn't the pudding recipe to fulfill all of my chocolate fantasies and make me swoon with delight (I've made those, but they are a lot more work), it was quick, easy, and satisfying. I would definitely make this again for a quick chocolate fix or an easy dessert.  I enjoyed the addition of the almond extract.  It added a subtle twist.  Thanks for a good standby for my recipe box.

Fanastic!  Very easy to make.  The pudding came out thick and smooth. Great chocolate flavor with just a nice hint of almond.  Will try this again with rum flavor next.

Delicious, very chocolately.  Thickened up quickly and nicely.  Tasted best when it was served cold. It's nice to have a great homemade chocolate pudding recipe, rather than using a boxed mix containing artificial chemicals.

If you like dark chocolate you will love this recipe.  Add cinnamon for a mexican flair.  Next time I make this recipe I plan to remove the milk and subsitute 2 cans of evaporated milk (14 oz) to add a more creamy flavor.  (see Old Fasioned Butterscotch Pudding)

Great recipe. I made it exactly as written and it couldn't have been easier or better tasting. Thickened up beautifully. I have never heard [in over 4 decades of cooking] that cornstarch can be over worked, or stirred too much [as one reviewer stated] If you follow the recipe exactly as written it will thicken beautiful, even while whisking until the end.

On our second and third batches [yes, it is that good] we substituted peppermint for almond extract and tossed in some semi sweet chips after adding the extracts.  We also substituted orange extract [again for the almond] and added white chocolate chips with about 1/4 orange zest. The possibilities are endless. NOTE:   I used about a handful of chips which is almost[?] 1/2 cup.

Thank you for this FABULOUS recipe. Family favorite.

Review is based on following the directions exactly and no substitutions. It is a true review based on the ingredients and instructions as written.

Did I mention easy? giggle

PS - We like cold pudding so we covered each individual pudding in a martini glass in plastic wrap to keep the pudding from forming it's own skin. Topped with homemade whipped cream and sprinkles. YAY Happy pudding.

Absolutely delicious!  I have made several double batches which were devoured when I took it to work.  Husband likes this pudding tremendously and actually requests it.  I usually use all vanilla extract as it is personal preference.  All in all, a delicious, dead-easy dessert that is a keeper in my file! :-)

I'm not sure what to say about this recipe.  It tasted like dark chocolate.  I definetly taste the baking cocoa in it.  It might have been because I wasn't able to eat it until it got cold because of my timing for dinner.  I didn't try it with the whipped cream.  I might try this again to try it with the whipped cream.  It might taste better.

This was a very rich and chocolatey pudding! I really liked the flavor, but the texture was not quite as good as pudding made from a boxed mix. The only change I made was to use vanilla instead of almond extract, because some members of my picky family didn't think it would taste good. It was very tasty topped with whipped cream! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Love this pudding! Was looking for a dairy alternative and this is perfect.  Lovely, rich and creamy.  Great treat.

Turned out great! Quick cooking and tasted just like my Grandma used to make. I didn’t use the almond extract as I didn’t have any, but I didn’t miss it. Excellent recipe and I highly recommend!

1.25.18 This was OK, but I think the flavor depends largely on the cocoa you use.  I used Hershey’s cocoa which, quite honestly, has been sitting around here for awhile, and the chocolate flavor just wasn’t outstanding.  The texture was good, it set up nicely, and it was very simple to make, but the taste just didn’t wow us.

I love how fast this pudding sets up!  It is my go to pudding recipe.  Sometimes I stir in a little strong coffee in place of some milk or use vanilla instead of almond extract. I like to stir in a pat of butter at the end...sounds strange but worth it.

Made this exactly as written (although I used unsweetened almond milk).  Didn't have any issues with not thickening or with almond flavor being overpowering, as other reviews noted.  It was easy and had a nice flavor so I will likely make again.  However, I did have some lumps in the pudding--either from the cornstarch or cocoa powder--so will sift those before adding.

Easy!  And the best! According to my 4 boys-ages 7-17...

I used homemade almond milk and probably could have left out the almond extract... But it was yummy and hit the spot!

Very tasty and easy to make pudding.. The texture was a little off, but maybe this was due to me not whisking enough... We'll see if it was just me next time.

Bought vanilla almond milk by accident. Didn't want to drink it, so made this and omitted the vanilla.

This was better than I expected. Might try it with extra vanilla and no almond extract just to see if I like it better. Texture was very good.

Msybe I did not pay as much attention while cooking as I should,  yet the pudding was fine. It can be even better if I had stirred even more.

Thanks for this easy and quick recipe. I live in South America and there are no pudding box mixes so we are very happy to have this recipe.  I have used baking chocolate instead of cocoa powder, as sometimes the powder is harder to find, and it worked just as well.  I have also substituted powdered milk for regular as I don't always have that either and we were still quite happy.

Turned out great! I didn't think the almond extract overpowered it at all; added a great twist of flavor to the usual chocolate pudding.

I love chocolate and almonds together, but I was disappointed with this recipe.  I was not able to get it to thicken, even after putting it in the fridge overnight.  Also, it had WAY too much almond flavoring.
