This ended up being one of the easiest and best chicken recipes I've used recently  Instead of one tablespoon of lemon juice, I ended up using the juice of a whole lemon. I had forgotten to preheat the oven and wanted to really sear the breasts first, so I needed the extra lemon juice to ensure nothing burned. I also used bouquet garni instead of straight tarragon. The flavor ended up being quite good from the mix of herbs. My husband and kids were quite happy with it, and I couldn't believe how easy it was. I'm definitely going to experiment with this one! Thank you!

I was a little skeptical at first of this recipe but the reviews were good so I made it and IT IS THE BEST!! The chicken is very tender and very tasty.  I am always trying to find stuff my 3 year old will eat and she loved it as we did too!!!

Very good and tasty. I had to cook mine an extra 10 minutes though. After 15 they were still pink inside.

Fabulously easy and fast...for people who worry about the lack of flavor, I have found that fresh garlic adds wonders. I also used the McCormick Grill Mates (Montreal) spice blend. It was a fantastic way to moisten up the dish by pouring some of the leftover butter mixture directly onto the chicken. Yum yum!

This is a perfect "guideline" recipe.  You can add almost any sauce to the basic recipe and have good results.

I will make chicken this way from now on.  I used this recipe to make chicken to top a lettuce salad. The chicken was delicious and tender--not crusty or difficult to cut for the kids.

very good basic guideline recipe.  I did not have dried tarragon, but basically took the chicken breasts, placed in a glass dish, sprinkled with kosher salt, dash of garlic salt, dashes of onion powder, dash of Mrs Dash, splashed some lemon juice over them and smeared with softened butter.   I didn't have parchment paper, so I covered with aluminum foil and cooked for 30 minutes.  removed aluminum foil and baked for about another 5 minutes while I steamed broccoli in the bag.  very flavorful and moist!  usually my chicken is pretty dry...

I have 3 kids who hate chicken, but they LOVE this recipe! I pound the chicken breasts first which makes it harder to squeeze into the skillet, but I find it helps cook them more evenly and quickly. I also use more lemon juice than suggested to prevent the butter from burning and mix it up on the herbs depending on what I have. A great basic recipe...thanks!

I was looking for an easy recipe.  That it is!  I didn't have parchment paper so I covered it with foil.  The chicken was not done after directed cooking time, so I uncovered it.  Then I left it in too long.  It was simply dry then (not the submitter's fault.)  Overall, I just felt it had little flavor.  I won't make this again, no.

I just tried this tonight and it just had no real flavor and I was looking for a tender juicy recipe. The chicken came out semi dry.  I will not make this recipe again.

Not only was this easy, but it was very tasty, too!  I did add one clove of garlic that I pressed over the top of the 1.3 lbs chicken that I used, but otherwise I followed the recipe.  Because the chicken was thin, it did take only about 20 minutes to bake in my covered dish.  I think a little less butter would be just fine.  We thought this recipe, brought to room temperature, would be good in a chicken salad.  Thanks, Alison!

This is delicious. I used boneless chicken thighs and fresh tarragon, also a little more lemon juice. It's quick and easy too. The name of the dish is a little confusing though - Butter Chicken is a classic Indian dish, nothing like this one. I've changed the name in my recipe file to Easy Lemon-Butter Chicken.

This chicken came out so moist and yummy and was SO easy ... I added some garlic cloves (chopped) & some portabello shrooms (and a little EVOO) to the dutch oven.  So good!

used Olive oil and Lemon juice in a cast iron skillet... seared the chicken in that mix with some basil, cumin, turmeric, and a few other herbs... baked open in 400 degree oven for about 25 min...   I love simple recipes like this that allow a beginner like me to experiment.... btw it turned out great

I don't know what I did wrong, but my chicken came out dry and tough.  All the moisture in the chicken ended up as liquid in the pan.  It was quick and easy and had a good tarragon flavor. I expected it to be better based on the reviews.  The silver lining is I now have a lot of left over cooked chicken to use in a casserole!

What isn't great when you cook it in 1/2 a stick of butter.  I forgot the parchment paper and it turned out fine.  I also omitted the terragon and used Italian Seasoning instead because I was cooking the chicken to go on risotto.  Thanks for this, I may never make chicken breast any other way!

This was very good. I pounded the chicken first and then pan seared first before putting in oven. Also cooked it at 350 for 20 minutes. My kids LOVED it!

Not sure if my chicken was too thick or what , but it was still pretty tough after 25 minutes of cooking.  Maybe I should have used a meat cleaver and thinned it out.  I will have to try it again.

This chicken was good. It made enough dinners for the 2 of us for about 4 days. The flavor was good, but not spectacular. This is a great "everyday" recipe, but I probably wouldn't make it for a special dinner with company. Thank you!

I added my own spices and tumeric. I placed it on top of long-grain rice.  It was delicious and tender!

Great master recipe, adapts easily (I used white wine since I didn't have lemon) and I can't wait to play around with different ingredients. You can't get any easier, and it cooks up moist and flavorful. Thank you for this recipe, it is definitely going into my regular rotation.

Good recipe but definitely best to season the meat the night before. Didn't have any tarragon so I added some oregano, basil and rosemary. Basically whatever tickles your fancy.
