Very good...yummy!

I added 1/2 a box of lemon pie filling mix to the cake batter and baked according to directions. 

Then I added the other half of the pie filling to the condensed milk and lemon juice mixture.  Next split that mixture in half.  The first half is for the cake filling and the second half will be for the icing. Add 2 tblsp corn starch & 2 tblsp powdered sugar. Mix with electric beater and let firm in frig. When set, spread between cake layers (I only made two layers). It comes out like a lemon mousse filling!!!  Now, put that in the fridge to set some more.

Mix the second half of the milk/juice mixture with about 6 ounces of the whipped cream. This should set for a minute, too. Then spoon on top of cake and lightly smooth all over cake.  It will have a beautiful shiny glaze.

Out of all the cakes I make, this is everybody's favourite. It's got an addictive quality to it - the right amount of tang and not too sweet. I doctor the boxed lemon cake mix to make it taste more homemade and luscious. To the cake mix I add one cup of sour cream; 5.9 onz of lemon instant pudding mix, 1 cup of veg oil, 4 eggs and 1/2 cup of sprite or 7-up. For the rest, I've followed the icing directions and how it's prepared. It keeps well and tastes better the longer it stays in the fridge, however it doesn't last that long around our house.

This cake was really good.  I did, however, screw up and added the whipping cream to the entire lemon mixture.  I think next time I make it, I will do the same.  I also learned a neat trick to cut the cake layers in half using dental floss ..... worked great!

I needed to make this for a summer pot luck dinner.  So, I baked the cake in a jelly roll pan.  I also used a small size of the lemon jello pudding mix.  I put 1/2 of the pudding mix in the cake batter and used the other 1/2 in the filling.  I also used the zest of 2 lemons in the filling.   As the cake came out of the oven I poked wholes in the cake and then smoothed 1/2 the filling over the cake.  After the cake had cooled I put the filling with the whipped topping folded in on top.  I sprinkled the topping with a little yellow crystal-sugar.  Everyone loved it.  The smaller sizes of cake were perfect for a potluck dinner.

I thought this recipe was pretty good.  It's a cool and very lemony cake, great for the spring and summer.  The only thing I would change is that I would mix all the filling ingredients together and use them to seperate each layer of the cake as well as for the frosting.  That way, you can see the four layers of the cake better and it looks prettier when served to guests.

A fantastic cake. We used 9-in. pans -- cutting them apart with dental floss is very easy. We reserved 1 cup lemon/milk mixture for topping, but it was way too much. Should have used most of the mixture for the layers. BE SURE to add more lemon juice to the mixture that will be used in the middle. I will definitely be making this again, and soon!

Without a doubt, it is the lovely texture of the filling and icing that makes this cake hard to resist!  I used the regular filling inside and the whipped cream version on the outside...there was a ton of icing, so next time I will probably use more lemon filling before mixing in the remainder with the whipped cream. Such a lovely cake, I can't wait to serve it up to the in-laws!!!  Thanks!

The filling in this cake is very good. I used real whipped cream that I did not add sugar to and folded in only 1/2 cup of the filling. I did add lemoncillo to the filling but the filling is also good without it. The downfall is the cake. You can tell it is a mix. Next time I would make a scratch cake.

I mixed the whole lemon juice mixture with the whipped topping, as a few other reviewers had suggested.  I also mixed in some finely grated fresh lemon zest in both the cake and the frosting.  It turned  out well but the cake wasn't quite lemon-y enough to stand up to the frosting.

I loved this cake!!!!  I made this cake and a chocolate cake for a birthday and there was not a crumb left of this cake.  The only thing that I did different was I added a box of lemon jello to the cake mix to give it a tarter flavor.  Thanks!!!

This cake was well-received at a birthday party for my father and sister-in-law.  Neither of them like overly sweet desserts, so this fit the bill nicely.  In hindsight, I wish I had added a packet of lemon pudding mix as suggested by other reviewers.  A little more lemon flavor wouldn't have hurt.  Instead, I added 8 ounces of sour cream and subbed lemon juice for part of the water.  I ended up with a very light cake which reminded me a little of sponge cake in texture.  I frosted the cake with stabilized whipped cream icing with a teasppoon of lemon extract.  I filled the layers and topped the iced cake with lemon pie filling.  I refrigerated the cake overnight before serving.  This simple recipe is a keeper.

I followed the recipe on the lemon cake box for a pound cake which called for adding 1 small box of lemon pudding.  Also, made as a single layer cake using a rectangle pan.  This is very refreshing and will definitely make again.

This cake is so easy to make and absolutely delicious!  I am not a baker and this cake turned out great.  In the summer like to top it with fresh raspberries- a great compliment to the lemon!

Nice lemony flavor. Only used one can of the sweetened milk since I did not cut the cake into four layers. I also added half a package of lemon jello powder (disolved in a teensy bit of water) to the icing to make it yellow and add some extra lemon flavor. The icing was a very nice consistency. If you like lemon flavors this recipe is quite tasty.

I am not normally a cake person, but love this recipe.  I do add a box of lemon pudding to the cake mix and mix the cool whip into the whole lemon mixture.  I have taken this several places and everyone always loves it and raves about it.  The topping is fantastic and good enough to eat by itself with a spoon.

I used a white cake mix and substituted half the water for lemon juice.
I had half a can of Eagle Brand which I beat until fluffy with 1 tbsp of lemon juice.
I split my 9x13 cake into 2 layers, spread a layer of the lemon filling and topped it with sliced strawberries.
I whipped 2 cups of whipping cream with 2 envelopes of Whipit and 2 tsps of vanilla sugar, added in the remaining lemon filling and whipped until combined, spread over the top and sides of the cake and decorated the top with sliced strawberries.
Very nice taste, I couldn't imagine using 2 cans of Eagle Brand though, it would be too sweet and soupy.

We are not a cake family!! But this was super!! It was easy and looks like you worked really hard. We actually finished a whole cake. I added lemon instant pudding 1/2 to cake mix and the 1/2 to filling/frosting mixture. Had leftover frosting used it for sugar cookies at easter. Yummy!

This cake is DELICIOUS!!  I would make some modifications to the recipe though.  I added fresh lemon zest to the cake mix and to the sweetened condensed milk mixture, I really think this helped add extra lemon flavor.  The refrigeration over night definitely helped the flavors develop and the frosting tasted much more "lemony" when I served the cake.  I accidently only got an 8 oz container of whipped topping but the recipe still made way too much frosting as others have said.  Next time I'm going to use 3/4 of the sweetened condensed milk/lemon juice mixture between the layers and just mix 1/4 with a smaller amount of whipped topping - that way the icing isn't so sweet.  I did like how the mixture between the layers soaked in a little and added extra moistness to the cake.  I wouldn't have known this was a boxed mix if I didn't make it myself!  Overall it's VERY good and I will definitely make it again but I'm going to play around with the frosting.

I too added a box of lemon pudding to the cake mixture and added the Cool Whip in with the condensed milk and fresh squeezed lemon juice (took me about 6 lemons to get the 1/2 cup)I also grated a few of the lemon rinds and added that to the mixture. Instead of using the mixture to frost the cake, I used Duncan Hinds Whipped Vanilla Icing. The cake was a BIG hit, even the guest who does not like cake had a piece and wanted more! My family is already wanting me to make it again (and again!)

This cake was so light an yummie!  I mixed the frosting and applied it in every layer as suggested by some of the reviews.  As I tasted the frosting the evening before it was to be served I did not like it at all, but the next day after it was in the fridge, the flavor lightened up and it was delicious.

This cake was absolutely delightful.  So refreshing for a hot summer day.  I agree with one of the reviews about the frosting.  Mixing the frosting at the very beginning to include the cool whip would be a better idea.  This is a keeper!

I make this ALL the time BUT I now make it in cupcake form. I make lemon cupcakes as directed just like the cake. When they are cooled, I inject the lemon juice/eagle brand mixture into the cupcake.  I then ice the cupcakes as you would the actual cake.  FANTASTIC!!

I made this cake for my daughters baby shower it was a summer party and everyone wanted to know what bakery this wonderful cake came from, It was easy and fast no fuss cake it was so refreshing needless to say their were no left overs although everyone wanted more.
Ok so I made this cake several times now and I went with the other advise to add all the filling together, I think it is better to have the filling separate because you get that lemon curd feel from it. I also added the whipped topping part to all the cake but to bite it with the lemon curd is the best to to me!
I forgot to mention that i'm baking this cake right now for my other daughters B-Day.

I rated it 4 stars because 12 oz of whipped cream is way too much. I think it could have been made with 8 oz and been great.  Then again, I'm not  a big fan of icing in general, but it is necessary for this cake.   I made it exactly according to directions and everyone loved it.  I left it in the frig for two full days after making it and it was moist and lemony and hit the spot on a warm day in New Orleans.

I tend to shy away from layer cakes.  The whole layering process scares me.  The layers being uneven, sliding off of each other, etc.  But this cake went together smoothly and tasted delicious.

Best cake I've ever made.  Tastes best after a whole day or more in the fridge.  I'm going to use this as my summer potluck staple.

I tried baking this cake this morning. I am so disappointed.  It is not the cake's fault, but we live in high altitude in Colorado, and my cakes just fell in the worst way.  I had wanted to make a special dessert for tonight, and apparently, I needed to do something for the high altitude, and didn't.  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

The way I make this is the same except that I only use one can of sweetened condensed milk,  Half can (6 oz.) of frozen lemonaide concentrate, thawed, and 1 12 oz. container of whipped topping, thawed.  Mix the condensed milk and lemonaide concentrate together and then fold in the whipped topping.  It is enough for the filling and the frosting.  You must keep this in the fridge.

My family always asks for this cake during the spring and summer months. It is so lemony and good it just gets eaten right up. The cake layers are a bit of a challenge for me to separate but with practice I got better. Even when I was at my worst separating the cake layers it still turned out great. Delicious!

This was the very first non-chocolate cake I baked for my family and it was hit! It's quite addicting. A taste of summer on a winter evening! I topped it with toasted coconut and toffee which added texture to it. Will definitely make it again.

I made this for my small wedding party. Everyone loved it. I love it because I could make it a full day ahead and take it to our destination. I used a yellow box cake and added a half box of lemon pudding to the cake. The other half box I put into the frosting that used the whipped topping. It looked beautiful. It reminded me of an old fashioned cake a grandmother would make.

My husband loves lemon desserts, it doesn't matter what, but I'm constantly looking for a new lemon dessert to do for his birthday. This was AMAZING! He devoured half the cake by himself in two days! I only made one difference though: I drizzled lemonade concetrate on the cake layers before putting the milk-lemon mixture on, and it made a tangier, lemony flavor that went with the cool ship amazingly. Also, he loves blueberries, and so the next time I make this cake I'm going to put blueberry pie filling in the middle with the other filling. A lemon blueberry ice box cake sounds phenomenal. This is an excellent summer cake and was very tasty.

This was tasty and delish. The only thing I will change next time is  to spread just an ultra thin layer of the condensed milk/lemon juice mix between layers and top each layer with the frosting mixture.

I got rave reviews on this cake. For the icing I added 1/2 a packet of instant lemon pudding mix and in between the layers I added crushed raspberry (along with the icing), which really helped to mellow out the lemon flavor, otherwise I think there might have been too much lemon.

The filling/frosting for this cake is amazing, the cake itself is not really anything special, but this topping keeps it very moist. Now I make it for all my special occasions, and everyone loves how different it is from ordinary cake frosting.  When mixing, I usually add a higher ratio of whipped topping for the outside frosting and a little less for the inside filling.

I followed the recipe pretty close and used real cream.  I didn't use all of the filling because it was too much.  The leftover mixture was really good as a spread on toast, bagels and banana bread.  It stayed good in the fridge forever, like 2 weeks.  yum yum.

This is now the favorite cake in my family.  I have made it several times now.  The difference in mine is that I add a WHOLE lot more juice to make both the filling and the icing more tart - more like key lime tartness.  Since I add so much more juice, I end up having to add whipped topping to the filling so it's not too runny.  I always have more than enough filling and icing left.  
I think I will try some of the other ideas in reviews to make the cake better.

This is a wonderful cake. I didn't use the whipped cream mixture for the icing at all because I was scared after reading the other reviews that it wouldn't turn out right. I made a cream cheese icing and added some lemon juice instead. I also added pudding to the micture (lemon of course) which is something I do as a rule for any recipe that includes a cake mix. My husband took it to his ofice for a birthday party, and everyone raved about it. It was light and perfect - especially for summer.

This cake very easy to make.  I took it to my family's Easter dinner and everyone loved it!  I thought it was very good, but had an obvious "not from scratch" taste.  I only used about half of the frosting, which was more than enough.

I loved this. Maybe more lemon juice next time. The artificial taste comes from the whipped topping. Read the ingredients on the tub. Ick! I used stabilized whipped cream instead. Find a good method for making it here: https://www.geniuskitchen.com/recipe/wilton-stabilized-whipped-cream-79506#activity-feed

Also, someone posted that the cake failed at altitude. I've lived in Denver most of my life, so high altitude baking is normal for me. Find some tips here: https://www.google.com/search?source=hp&ei=n0OaXKjbEYvN0wK9x6rwCg&q=high+altitude+baking&oq=high+al&gs_l=psy-ab.1.0.0l10.3160.5209..10033...0.0..0.97.704.8....2..0....1..gws-wiz.0XHnIc7qKcQ

Not a true icebox cake (those are made with cookies and whipping cream and NO baking) but not a bad recipe when you have time one day to fuss a little and not the next. We like our cake a little less sweet than others so I served left over filling on the side.

This cake was delicious.  I used the whipped topping in the layers to give it more definition.  I also added 1/2 of lemon pudding mix to the cake.  A very easy recipe that company loved.

This was a good simple recipe to make. I would have perferred the batter to be homemade rather than a box. You could tell it was made from a box. I also put in the lemon pudding. 1/2 in the batter and 1/2 in the sweet milk. I also added extra lemon. It was good and quick but for better, make homemade batter : )

This cake is wonderful....full of lemon flavor!  I only used two layers because four layers made the cake very tall and it fell while cutting it.

Used this recipe because of its simplicity.  However, something was definitely lacking in the icing, it did not hold up at all!  If it was out of fridge for any time at all, icing would start to melt.  Very disappointing.  Some cream cheese would have helped.

Simple to make and tasty.  Be sure to save enough of the condensed milk/lemon juice mix to fold into the frosting.  Just a little less lemony than I would have liked.

Pretty good... definitely better the second day.  I did not follow the instructions to make it a day ahead, and I wish I had.  The leftovers were much better the day after I served it to guests!!!

Great Cake...I also added the whipped cream to the lemon pudding mixture and it turned out great...there is a lot of frosting, so do put plenty on each layer. Great compliments on the frosting. I also let it sit in the fridge overnight..

i have made this recipe a few times now and my guests just love it!  I only use one can of the canned milk because I flavor the cool whip with Lemon curd.  It seems to make the topping more dense.  Enjoy!

Absolutely loved this cake!  I added some lemon extract to it to give it a more lemony flavor.  Big hit!  Thanks
