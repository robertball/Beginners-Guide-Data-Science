There are many alternatives to the 1 C. Crisco (shortening) that are healthier.  My suggestions are: use half butter 1/2 oil...or you could use 1/2 Applesauce or whatever ratio you desire to make it healthier...a 3rd option would be to use White Bean Puree and your children wouldn't be able to taste the difference.

Very easy to make and wonderful to eat!  I have made it three times now and am going to make it again right now!  I have tried using 1/2 butter and 1/2 Crisco, but actually preferred the all Crisco version.  Woo Hoo, now that Crisco is available in a trans-fat version, life is grand!

This cake is very very delicious.  The yoghurt makes it moist, while the glaze gives it a perfect tart/sweet flavor.  I used 1 stick of butter and 1/2 cup crisco instead of 1 cup crisco.  I'll definitely be making this cake again!

Awesome! The store was sold out of lemon yogurt, so I made sugar free lemon pudding and used that instead. Otherwise I followed the recipe to a T, with fantastic results. I will make this again!

Has anyone tried to make it with a different flavour of yogurt.  Im thinking raspberry, still using grated lemon peel.  You could use the lemon glaze or make a raspberry coulis with it.  The recipe is great as it is though

Yum!  Subbed 1/2 c applesauce and 1/2 c olive oil for the shortening.  Added a couple T ground flax as well.  Instead of yogurt, I added a cup of plain kefir, then extra lemon zest and some fresh lemon juice.  I also decreased the sugar to 1 cup.  Moist and delicious!

An excellent dessert that is easy to make. Even better when served warm, and don't even think about skipping the glaze... it just wouldn't be the same!

We love lemon so accumulate a lot of lemon breads and cakes.  As written I have rated this a 4 but only because of the shortening taste.  Suggest using 1/2 butter and you will see a big difference in texture and taste.   Again, I only rate a cake as written because there is no point in rating something that has been totally changed. 
This is not fair to others.

I chose to use all butter, and then instead of lemon zest, I used 1 1/2 teaspoons of lemon extract.  This had a very tender crumb.  I plan on using this pound cake for a dessert that calls for lemon pound cake.

This was a very good cake and I will definitely make it again to see if it can be a real 5-star! I used the suggestion of half olive oil/ half butter in place of Crisco, and added in some poppy seeds. Also cut down the sugar a bit, which I won't do next time around. Definitely a keeper. It didn't take us to cloud 9, but maybe that was my fault not the recipe's. Still, I wouldn't hesitate to serve it for a tea or shower. (and LOVED the glaze!)

Tasty cake, but mine turned out very short & dense.  I guess I should have figured given it's a pound cake, but I was hoping for fluffy.  I subbed 1/2 C butter and 1/2 C applesauce for Crisco.  I added 1 tsp of lemon extract and used 12 oz yogurt, rather than 8.  I continued to coat the cake with glaze for hours to ensure it soaked in.  Tasty, but I'd probably look to try another recipe next time.

I have made this pound cake several times, and Its great!! It lacks a little bit of lemon flavor, so I have added a teaspoon or so of lemon extract to the cake batter and it turns out great. Otherwise I'll follow the recipe as is. The best thing about this cake is the lemon glaze, so make sure to use fresh lemons.

Ok... so I realize that this recipe was submitted by Crisco, so I feel a little abashed admitting that I used butter instead of shortening. I couldn't find any lemon yogurt, so I used the juice of one lemon and enough plain yogurt to make one cup. I made the glaze the consistency of elmer's glue and then waited until the cake was cool before drizzling it on  because I wanted it to be visible. SO GOOD. YUM. Perfect moistness and perfect, not-too-sweet taste. Made it for our Bible study group on my husband's birthday - everyone just loved it. Goes super well with herbal tea.

sooo good, its not too sweet which is what i love, you can also control the sweetness of the outside by adding as much glaze as you want. I didn't add much glaze only about a third of it. MAde it twice so far. cooked it for 54 minutes

This was very easy to put together and tastes great.  The lemon glaze adds the perfect finishing touch for the lemon flavor.  Very moist and the texture is perfect.

I used Greek yogurt + 1 T real lemon juice, as I've never seen a "lemon yogurt" at the store that doesn't have load of processing ingredients.  Also used all butter rather than shortening, cut down [raw] sugar to 1 cup.  Honey as a sub for the sugar would taste great in this recipe.  I knew we'd like it lemony-er than the recipe sets this cake up to be, so I doubled the zest.  Glad I did!

Best textured and flavoured cake I've ever made and I've made a lot of cakes. Our daughter, who went to university in America, jumped to her feet as I brought the cake into the dinning room demanding to know if it was pound cake.  I wasn't sure for a couple of seconds if I was doing the right thing or the wrong thing she was so straight faced.  It was the right thing and the entire cake was gone within 24 hours.  It is now our celebration cake.  Thank you so much for sharing. I'm trotting it out to an invitation day on Sunday so that Australians can become acquainted with a pound cake.

Very easy to make.  I didn't have lemon yogurt so substituted sour cream and fresh lemon juice.  I too, tasted the crisco but I think that may be because I knew it was in there, no one else seemed to mind.  I do think next time I will do butter/oil or applesauce, and maybe add an extra egg for a more pound cake texture.  I do like the idea of another reviewer with trying different flavor yogurts.

Made as written. Was very moist. The tangy glaze was the best part. I may try it again using butter to see if it turns out better. This was a lighter pound cake, I like mine to be more dense

This was a very moist and tastey pound cake.  I couldn't get lemon yogurt so I just blended lemon juice into the yogurt.

Based on all the reviews I was excited to taste this cake.  Sadly, it had very little lemon flavor.  All I could taste was Crisco.

This is easy to make and comes out perfect. It's also moist, unlike most pound cakes that I've found kind of dry.

I made this last night with whatever I had on hand. I made half the serving sizes here (6-8).  I used half wheat flour/half cocount flour. I didn't have lemon yogurt so I subbed half of the yogurt with Noosa brand raspberry yogurt (amazing) and the other half no sugar greek yogurt. I also used brown sugar as I had no regular sugar on  hand. I also didn't have any eggs so I used 4.5 tbsp of refrigerated egg whites and 1.5 tsp olive oil to sub. ALSO for the glaze since I didn't have any sugar I used as much Stevia as I had in the house (1/16 cup??) and added equal parts lemon juice. This was perfect actually, because any more glaze and it would have made this moist delicious cake TOO moist. I baked it for 50 minutes on 325 and it came out perfectly!! I must say I will make this next time I need to bring something to a party - not only was it super-easy, I was even able to make it with what I had on hand, which wasn't a lot as you can tell!! 

For the glaze, I added a little extra lemon zest to give it a little more zing. I juiced an extra half lemon into the batter because, personally, I knew it would help with the greek yogurt taste. I also added just a little extra vanilla extract for the same reason.

Love it, my mom went back for seconds ;) I used spelt flour, 1/2 cup butter, 1/2 cup coconut oil. Agave syrup instead of sugar, it was a big hit. Will keep this as one of my favorites ;)

This was pretty easy to make. I did make some substitutions. I used unsalted butter instead of Crisco, used 6 oz. of lemon cream pie yogurt since the store didn't have lemon yogurt, and added 1/4 cup of fresh lemon juice. The glaze is really sweet and it soaked into the cake pretty well. It tastes better when it sits for a while to let the glaze settle and hardens and gives it a stronger lemon flavor. Received lots of compliments on it.
