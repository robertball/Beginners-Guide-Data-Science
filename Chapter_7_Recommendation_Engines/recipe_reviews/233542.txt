I did this with cucumber slices/chips and the recipe tastes great! I used apple cider vinegar instead of white vinegar. I didn't have fresh dill so I used approx. 2 tbsp of dry dill weed and placed about 5 peppercorns in the jar. We have already eaten the pickle chips (which were crisp by the way) and placed new sliced cucumber chips in the brine solution.

Pretty amazing recipe-- easy to make and the pickles were delicious.  I even went so far as to reuse the brine once with another set of cukes and they were just as good.  Once they were gone, adding a bit of oil to the brine makes for an amazing oil and vinegar dressing for salads or even as an addition to potato salad.

These really are delicious (and easy, too).  Unless you're a gardener familiar with growing dill, you're probably like I am and don't know what a "head of dill" is.  I bought a pkg of mini gourmet cukes (unwaxed so I didn't have to peel them) which turned out to be the perfect size for my jar.  As far as the amount of the fresh dill to use, I just loaded up the jar with the the dill stems and cuke spears, and poured in the vinegar mixture.  White vinegar is milder in taste, so these pickles won't make you pucker, and as others mentioned, I'm not sure you even need the small amount of sugar.  They are crunchy and simply fresh tasting, and that works for me.   I can see this on the Christmas Gift List this year.

These are very easy and delicious! I don't care for sugar in pickles so I omitted it and I had picked more dill than the recipe calls for, so I put it in and that seemed to make it only tastier.  This is how I'll use up my extra cucumbers from now on. Thanks for the recipe!

Some advice for those who might be disappointed in these. Use UNWAXED pickling cucumbers, not the slicing cukes found at the store. You have to start with the right pickles. Make sure your brine is thoroughly cooled before pouring over the pickles. That ensures that these stay crisp.

I didn't know what a head of dill was, and I didn't know how to measure cucumber spears (obviously I don't spend much time in the kitchen), but these turned out crunchy and delicious.  I think I'm going to add another cucumber to the existing juice to save some money.  I don't grow cucumbers or dill so it was a bit pricey.  Next year I'll grow both as my family LOVES their dill pickles!

Very easy and yummy. I sliced my cucumbers for this recipe and they turned out great! I also added 2 tsp. salt not 1.  I used fresh dill from the garden and added in some leaves along with the heads.  I added more garlic too.  I put my seasonings(except cucumbers) in when the brine was hot and it seemed to work better.  I made a spicy version by adding jalapenos, black peppercorns and red pepper flakes and the spicy version was a big hit!  They really reach full flavor after 3 days in fridge.

I am sorry to say that these turned out badly and I don't know why.  They were very soft and had an unpleasant taste.  I have reviewed the amounts and directions carefully, and made sure the liquid was cooled as instructed.  I can't see where I made an error.  I make refrigerator pickles most years and have for a long time, so I do have some experience.  I would really like to try a refrigerator dill pickle recipe again.

I liked this recipe as is.  After making the brine recipe, I filled two quarts with spears of regular pickling cukes and lemon cukes.  Then needed more, so I cut a fairly small zuchinni into spears and finished filling a quart jar with them.  The zuke came out very tasty. I will make more with zuchinni; and maybe with some green beans.  This seems to be a very versatile recipe.

Delicious! And this is coming from someone who doesn't like Dill Pickles! These are light and crisp and bright. I did add about 1 tablespoon extra vinegar as I like "zing" and added about 3-5 dill seeds to each jar along with dill weed and part of a dill head from the garden. I cut spears from the center portion of the cukes and retained the ends. After all spears were in jars, I cut the ends into chips and made pint jars of chips. GREAT on burgers off the grill! My family loves dill pickles and we've got a lot of cukes this year so I think I'll be making quite a few batches of these. Thanks!

I made these about a week ago and just opened them tonight to serve at my hubby's birthday party. They were a hit! I grew my own pickling cucumbers and let me kids help with this recipe since it was so easy. We got lots of compliments. I did go easy on the salt and added a little more fresh dill. Wonderful recipe. Thanks for sharing!

Loved this, but particularly the batch I made where I doubled the salt and when cooking the marinade, I added a bunch of fresh dill to the mixture.  It infused the dill much quicker into the pickles.  From now on I will only make it this way.

Great recipe!  I experimented with both baby cucumbers and regular sized ones and would highly recommend the smaller ones as they stay crunchy.  The middle of larger ones (where the seeds are) get a bit mushy.

Very good.  I'd say try them on day 4 or 5.  They were ready on day 3 and were good, but the extra day or two made a big difference.  I also mixed it up with both spears and chips.  The chips were good, but the spears were amazing.  My fiancé and two friends tried them and all loved them.  It was a hit.

I'm making them again but with some peppercorn added.  Can't wait.

These are great! At first taste they pucker ur mouth, but after the second bite I couldn't stop eating them. I added a few extra garlic cloves and dill, but didn't change anything else. This was my first try at refridgerator pickles and I will continue to use this recipe. Thank you!

Excellent and simple recipe! I used 5 small picking cucumbers and they turned out perfect, even after only 1 day in the fridge. This is my new go-to pickle recipe! I didn't have a lot of dill left, so I used about half the amount and they were still tasty.  I might even omit the sugar next time. Thanks for the great recipe!

This my first attempt at making pickles and I'm thrilled with the outcome!  They are perfectly fresh and crunchy with a great balance of flavor.  I tend not to measure and probably used less sugar and salt than called for.  I used pink Himilayan salt which I think has a stronger taste so I didn't use as much.  I will make this again and again!

I added 1/2t red pepper flakes and 6 garlic cloves to the brine after I took it off the burner and replaced the cucumbers with blanched green beans. It was delicious, and I am repeating the recipe today with more beans.

I've never made pickles.  Really, I didn't even know I wanted to until I walked through the Farmers Market and saw the cutest little pickling cucumbers, which I purchased.  Then it was time to find a recipe.  I was looking for something not too complicated since this was my first attempt.  I wanted something that met my taste buds.  I wanted something that everyone else raved about.  THIS WAS THAT RECIPE!!!  I followed the directions with slight modifications.  I split the vinegar... 1 C White and 1/4 C Apple Cider.  I also added peppercorns and exchanged the sugar for Splenda.  Other than that, verbatim.  I will consider myself a pickle maker from now on!!  Thank you for sharing your recipe.

These were relatively easy to make and the flavour is nice. Would probably add more dill and garlic if I try these again. Was my first try at any type of pickling though so there's always room for improvement!

Followed the recipe exactly and my husband couldn't wait the three days to start noshing on them!  He said they were great the first day.  So, I'm guessing they will be fantastic by day three if they make it that far!

Followed the recipe exactly and after 3days in the fridge we tried them  They were excellent and everyone liked them very much. Will be making these again soon! Next time I am going to try without the sugar. Hope they are just as good.

I bought way too many cucumbers at a farmers market and after using them in salads and as raw snacks, I thought I would try homemade pickles. I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out far better than I thought they would. They were really delicious, not overly vinegary but with the perfect amount of dill and garlic and with a great crunch. With that said, I did add extra garlic cloves (about 4 per jar), and lots of fresh dill since my family loves garlic and dill. The taste actually reminds me of the homemade pickles my mom made every summer using dill and cucumbers from our garden. A sweet memory to be sure. I did make one jar spicy hot as suggested in another review by adding some peppercorns, a few slices of fresh jalapeño pepper and a pinch of red pepper flakes. They were equally delicious and had a great kick to them, especially in a Caesar cocktail! This recipe is definitely a keeper for my family. So glad I found it.

Super easy recipe that is customizable. I added apple cider vinegar for a bit of a sweeter taste. My whole family loves them. Also, these are very inexpensive to make.

Wow. Great recipe. Fast and easy. I had a gallion size plastic container and sliced six kirby cukes from the farm market in spears and slices. I threw in a couple tablespoons of pickling spices along with extra garlic and didn't have white vinegar so used cider vinegar. Also only used half of one good sized bunch of fresh dill. Tasted after leaving in the refrigerator overnight.OMG what great flavor! I doubt if they will last 3 days.  On my way to the farmers market to get more kirbys.  BTW, I also threw in a couple of jalapenos and other small hot peppers . Will see how they taste later.
Thanks for a great recipe.

The best crisp pickles I ever had.  I modified slightly to :  only one cup of vinegar and increased salt to 2 tablespoons.  Also followed some of the reviewers notes and tossed some garlic and dill into the water, just after it is taken off of the stove to cool.  I also add some peppercorns to the bottom of each jar.  Not a big deal if you don't add them....these are awesome and simple to make!!!   If you want spicy pickles for Bloody Mary's add two tsp of pepper flakes to the jar.

I have made pickles in the past. Disasters that were pushed to the back of the fridge and forgotten for untold amounts of time, poisoning the container they were in.  NOT THESE PICKLES. These are the simplest, easiest, most delicious pickles. I only made them a day ago and one of the jars is already gone. There are about 13 jars in the fridge at the moment, some variations to this recipe to suit the tastes of my spice loving sister. This is a brilliant recipe just as it is, or with additions of your choice. Highly recommend and will make again.

These came out crunchy and fresh! I made them according to the recipe, but cut the sugar because of other comments. I think I'll use the sugar amount listed next time, and there will be a next time! I also didn't know how much a head of dill was, so I just picked a bunch of it and threw it in. Delicious!

I'm an experienced pickle maker and this is an easy and delicious pickle recipe.  I tried it both with 2 packet of Splenda instead of sugar and 1 teaspoon of sugar instead of 1 tablespoon and both were excellent.  They are crispy and a wonderful condiment to a summer meal.

My husband LOVES pickles.  He got several cucumbers from a friend's garden and asked if I'd try to make pickles.  I tried this recipe because it was easy.  He absolutely loves them!  The only thing I did different was to use dried dill instead of fresh.  a huge hit in our house!

So easy and good.  I added dill pickle crisp to water (CaCl), in the amount the bottle told me to - needed a tsp. more.  I also peeled my cukes and cut them in chips.  Note:  Use cukes that are not overgrown!  (note to self:  I didn't like store-bought pickle seasoning)  My jars also sealed themselves (I poured liquid in hot) - wonder if I could just store them in pantry ....

I was making them from some cucumber I had leftover. I didn't have fresh dill so I used about a tablespoon of the dried stuff and I also did not have garlic cloves so I used about a teaspoon of the garlic powder. I didn't have much cucumber leftover so I used a little less water and vinegar. They are so... good, I can't wait to make them again !!

Love the pickles!..  Just like store bought,only fresher.So easy to make and whenever I have xtra cukes from the garden, I'll make a jar. I couldn't find the dill heads, so I used the fern fresh dill and discarded it after 3 days. Other than that, I followed  the recipe.

Even with that of little sugar they were way to sweet for me to call them dills, I had to add about 1 cup vinegar and and two tablespoons of "pickling salt" (just super fine ground salt, I used my mortar and pestle with sea salt) to get the sweetness out. Now they are pretty good but still nothing near what I call dill pickles.

We are big pickle fans. This was my first attempt at trying a homemade recipe. I didn't have pickling cucumbers so I used regular. They were a little too tart for my husband but my 9 year old ate the whole jar within a few days. I thought they were crisp and tasty alone or on burgers (I made a sliced jar too). I plan to try different variations (spices, pickling cucumbers, etc). because this recipe is too easy not to. Maybe we are not tough critics but I just can't see how you can go wrong!

These were good. I do can dill and bread and butter pickles each year and always have some leftover cucumbers. So this year I decided to use the leftover cucumbers to make this recipe. After they were in the fridge for a week or so I decided to double the garlic and dill for more flavor. In my opinion they needed the extra flavor. I'll use this recipe again. Thank you

My kids LOVED these pickles. They were so easy to make...the hardest part was waiting the 3 days to eat them. We are on our second round since the first 5 jars we made lasted for only 2 weeks. Thanks for the awesome recipe!

I've made these for two summers now and they are a hit every time.  We now only add 1 teaspoon of sugar and 5 or 6 whole peppercorns.  I have to make them and hide them in the frig or my family will eat them even before the 3 days are up!
Oh I forgot, we also add 1 small onion sliced into rings sometimes too.  Yum.

Absolutely love this recipe!  I made it exactly as written and it has the perfect blend of tart and sweet to my taste. I love that it doesn't use much sugar or salt as we have several diabetics in the family.  I will try a batch with the suggested tsp of sugar just to see if I can cut more without compromising the taste. I plan to make these often.

This is the second time I have made these pickles.  The first time I think I was a bit light on the dill so they seemed to be better after a week or so. This time I added more dill and garlic and they were wonderful!

I made these pickles before going on vacation with my family. They were a HUGE hit, with everyone from my 3 1/2 year old granddaughter to my pickle picky husband.  I followed the recipe (except that I had to used dried dill) and I used both Kirby cukes and regular cukes.  I even saved the juice after the whole batch got devoured and threw in some sliced peeled cukes I had left over and they were delicious as well.  Love them!

same ingredients listed on a jar at the chain grocery. $9.99 a quart. Making these myself a second time. Just drain first before biting in, as the vinegar can bite back if your not a fan. Adds to the fresh taste. This recipe made 2 quart jars for me. This batch will be donated the office Relay for Life fundraiser luncheon.

Wow, these had a simple yet good flavor. I have another recipe for refridgerator pickles that uses lemon juice instead and like this one much better. Plus, it is ingredients I typically have in the house. I accidentally jotted down the ingredients but not the directions. So, no boiling or putting in the fridge for 3 days. I mixed the ingredients, poured them over cucumber spears, and we ate the heck out of them. I used 2 English cucumbers, cut them into spears, and made 1/4 of the liquid so there wasn't too much waste. I also subbed dry for fresh dill using a good pinch or two. It worked fine, for me, thanks.

I have made this twice this season. I added more dill because I like it and I had a lot growing. More garlic, same reason, some pickling spices and 1/4 cup less water, plus 1:4 cup more vinegar and some sweet heat peppers which I love.

These turned out perfectly. I did replace one cup of white vinegar with unfiltered cider vinegar. They taste great and have a good snap too. I may add more dill and garlic next time for variety. They are disappearing fast!

Perfect....minimal salt, and tasty crunchy pickles that are a breeze to make.  I cut the recipe in half.

Substituted cider vinegar for white vinegar because that's what I had. Regrettably, will NOT do that again.  It was way too sweet for my quest of a truly dill pickle.  Might work well for bread and butter pickles but definitely not dill.  Otherwise, texture was crunchy as desired.  Will definitely make again!

I didn't measure out my cucumbers because I had a ton. I just cut what I had into spears & put them in quart mason jars with a nice clump of dill & 2 garlic cloves per jar. They turned out very good - nice & crisp & the garlic gives them a spicy flavor (not hot just flavorful).

 My husband who grew up with his grandma's homemade pickles & he absolutely loved these & wants me to make some more.

Delicious and they actually taste like DILL pickles! That said, I ran out of sugar and only had a sprinkling when I made them, so I will continue to do that with further jars as I do not like sweet pickles at all, and this was just right with only the sprinkle. 

I also didn't have fresh garlic and used garlic powder instead. Tasted great. In one jar, I threw in some black pepper and a few red pepper flakes and they were even better as I like things a little spicy, but the milder pickles were good, too.

This is  very good basic recipe. Thank you. When you just want a good tasting fresh pickle & are overwhelmed with cucumbers from the garden, this is a go to. More importantly, the jars of pickles are easier to get rid of (pass off onto friends, family & neighbors) than just a plain old cucumber. People enjoy these.

I had some cucumbers come in early. Not enough for a big batch. This year I also had far my green beans than I knew what to do with. So I made some more and have pickled the green breads. Need to give them a few more days to see how they turn out.

Growing dill in my garden, which all came at the same time so I had to do something.  I was able to fit a  ton of dill with 2 onions, 8 large pickle sized cucs and a butt load of garlic.  Used 3T of salt instead of 1of and boiled 1C vinegar with 1C water.  Cooled it with 4C of ice.

Made these probably about 2-3 weeks ago now. This was my first time making pickles at home and this was a really great recipe to start with. My mom and I added the recommended amount of everything but possibly more dill than listed though. They came out wonderful! I've eaten half the jar already! The only downside I have encountered is that some of the spears have a bitter taste to them, especially on the ends? I can't think of why though. I don't think a little added dill would do that but maybe. I didn't use "pickling cucumbers" per se, just small ones a local farm grows. Definitely going to make them again!

Really good recipe and easy to make. I didn't measure the pickle slices because i had a bunch of cukes from the garden  I ended up doubling the pickling brine and put them in a Cambro.

They turned out awesome. Dill flavor is great. I did have sea salt but you could use Kosher. 

Second batch I added a couple of sliced jalapeno's and some pepper flakes for a spicy dill. They were the bomb.

This is a great recipe as written. It's easy to make, the 3 day brine is perfect and they are crunchy and delicious. Recommend it definitely.

I made these pickles last week. I minced my garlic. They smelled just like the pickles you get with a sandwich at a Deli. Several people tried the pickles . Everyone enjoyed them. I did receive a few compliments. I will make them again. I will serve them at cookouts. This recipe will be great to have on hand when my cukes are ready to pick from the garden! A+++

I’ve made all sorts of canned pickles in the past  but this refrigerator dill pickle recipe is by far the best type of pickle I’ve made.  I made about eight or nine jars at the end of the summer with the pickles I had left in my garden and my whole family enjoyed them until the last jar was gone.  They lasted until about Thanksgiving.

I gave a neutral rating because this is the first time using this recipe. Currently I have the brine in the refrigerator to cool. I am going to use it for Poblano as well as Serrano peppers.

I hope this recipe will achieve something similar to the commercial pickled Jalapeños.
I went with the recipe as per but not sure of the exact amount of fresh dill so I just went with what it looked right.

I’ll besure to update in a few days.

Super simple with great results.  One tip is to leave it longer in the fridge before consuming - it will give a better taste the longer it is left to pickle.

These are the best pickles I’ve ever had - and extremely easy to make. I doubled the recipe, and had to use fresh baby dill as it was the only thing I had. Also added a little celery seed and some peppercorns to the brine ...By day 4 they were perfect!

Excellent!!  The garlic adds so much. We also add slices of sweet onion (Vidalia or Wala Wala).  The pickled onion is great on salads.  We have also used this same recipe when canning our dills.  Results were amazing!!

A very crunchy pickle.  I like it mine a bit more salty, garlicky and dill so I will just add more.

AWESOME!  Followed the recipe exactly and can't believe how nice and crunchy they are.  Can't stay away from them. The only change I might make is to slice the garlic.  I did both spears and slices.  Might try using the recipe on some of my green tomatoes. YUM

Very good crisp and fresh tasting refrigerator pickle.   I added in onions for my own personal taste.   I prefer a little more tart pickle, and when I make these the next time, I will increase the vinegar by a cup and reduce the water by a cup.

We liked these very much at our house. They are crisp and refreshing and are a good accompaniment to a sandwich or a burger. I put them out on a buffet of cheeses and charcuterie and our friends were asking for more! They went home with the recipe. I think that next time I will try garlic and onion and maybe a chile pepper in the recipe. Thanks for posting the recipe!

I made them and they are very good. I made the chips instead of the spears and they came out good. My neighbor even liked them and she is really not a dill pickle person. Thank you for the great recipe!

Perfection! My first time making pickles, it was so easy. They are so crisp and crunchy and taste perfect. Love them and will definitely make them again!  I didn't have any sea salt so I used regular salt, I'll try the sea salt next time but they are still delicious.

This is the 3rd year I have used this recipe. Quick, easy to make and so delicious. Hubby waits anxiously every year for the cucumbers to start showing up in the garden.  This is the first recipe I make when the cucumbers are ripe.

Made the first batch to directions and while they were good pickles - they seemed to lack a bit. Very crispy and decent but family all said they were not as tasty as they thought they should be. Making second batch today (over abundant cucumbers in garden this year!) and adding a 1/2 c kosher salt and some pepper corn to this batch - will have to see how they do with more salt and peppercorn.

So easy and delicious, I couldn't keep them going quick enough as my family ate them right up.  I did add extra dried dill from the previous years haul and extra garlic.  The brine was good enough to use agin, we just kept adding fresh pickles from the garden, filled up the quart jars at least three times before I dumped it out and started over.

I made these twice.  The first batch was great and had a lot of flavor.  The second batch was thrown away.  The difference was the cucumbers....   the first batch was from my garden.  Second from the grocery store.  Be sure to use good clues.  Makes a huge difference!

These were so easy and make me question why I would ever need to buy prepared pickles. You can adjust the dill, garlic and sugar to your taste. Also I used Splenda.

Excellent recipe! My kids thought they were a bit on the sweet side even though it only took a tablespoon of sugar. I altered the recipe by adding an extra 1/2 cup of vinegar and an extra 1/2 teaspoon of sea salt! They were a hit after I made the changes! We have been making them almost monthly since I found this recipe!

I made these during the summer with baby euro cucumbers and served them to my 5 year old grandson.  He and his Mom both love pickles and thought these were great.  My daughter now makes them for him all the time.

We will probably skip the sugar next time. I think the vinegar carries enough sweetness. We were pleasantly surprised with how yummy these turned out! We added peppercorns and onions!

This was really good! I added some sliced onions, just because. I also used regular salad cucumbers because that was what I had, but I peeled and seeded them first. They got eaten right up. I've thrown some more cucumbers and some carrot sticks into the brine, just because. I suspect this will work with any sort of vaguely pickleable vegetable I might have on hand in the future.

What a easy Pickle recipe.  First time I ever made homemade Dill Pickles. .  They are good .  Next time I make them I would do what one comment said she did use cider vinegar instead of the white  vinegar.   Or maybe half white and half cider vinegar.  Didn't use all the sugar.   The only problem I had is what is a ball of dill weed.  Think it's a great recipe for someone who never made homemade pickles.

I can't believe the positive response I've gotten from these. I used pickling Cukes right from the garden and Dill from our herb garden. I added the Coriander tops as well. Upped the vinegar a smidge, added some whole peppercorns and they were awesome!

Easy and great taste- Definite hit with the family. I do not use as much sugar or salt. I use about 1/2 the sugar and 3/4 salt. I add more garlic and pepper corns. For my daughter and son-in-law, I add jalapeño that’s just a small amount. I definitely recommend this recipe. For one thing, when you have a ton of cucumbers coming out of your garden, the last thing you need is to do a lot of prep. This is a very fast and easy recipe!

My daughter gave this recipe to her brother who made pickles from it last year.  He took a quart to school to give to a friend. The friend gave him the empty jar at the end of the day.  They were that good!

This is my first time making dill pickles, and I used my garden cucumbers. I tasted them after only two days in the fridge just now and they are delicious. I did add black peppercorns but that was my only change.

I made these with pickling cucumbers from my garden.  I did a double batch and added an extra tablespoon of salt. I used Himalayan sea salt.  I also added a slice of onion to each jar.  they came out super delicious, even when I couldn't resist and tried them on the second day they were very good.  I added some garden peppers and some red pepper flakes to a couple of the jars, and they had a great kick.  this is a great recipe and simple to make.  Will definitely use this one again.

Agree with less sugar and I used apple cider vinegar - all my ingredients came fresh out of my non-GMO heirloom organic garden. I also used fresh sliced serrano peppers to give a nice zesty zing. No one will let the pickles sit for 10 days in the jar. I make pickled okra using the same recipe.

Very easy and great recipe.  One thing I learned a long time ago is to make sure to cut the blossom end off the cucumber to prevent soft pickles.  Also, adding a grape leaf helps prevent this by counteracting the enzyme that causes soft pickles.  Making my second batch sometime today.  The first batch is done and they turned out great!

Just like others have said...they come out crispy & my jars actually sealed themselves so I don't have to eat them right away. I also tried Apple Cider Vinegar, like the one person did, and it tastes great. It has a different taste then the white vinegar but its all about taste preference.

I made these on Saturday and Monday we tried them.  they are amazing!!!!  I only wish I knew how long they will keep in the refrigerator.  We have a lot of cucumbers from the garden and processed pickles just don't have the amazing flavor that these refrigerator pickles have.  I suppose I will just have to share more than I keep.  :-)

We can't buy dill pickles where we live. I was really missing them. I tried this out as an experiment.  My students loved them. They said they had the perfect crunch. Made them again and I let a few people taste them. They ate them all. Now I am making another batch.

First  time I tried making pickles. The recipe was easy and quick. I added more dill and garlic. I got high praise from my picky grown  son. Said " This is one of the best pickles I have eaten."  Cant wait to make some more for my not so picky, pickle loving daughter.   yay for mom :)

I made this recipe last month and my boyfriend said to bring them to Thanksgiving...I thought 'Thanksgiving?'....Not really your traditional thing to bring. So I did and they were a hit! Apparently his family loves pickles. I bought jars and made another batch to give as gifts. It's my first time jarring, so I had to tweak the amount of liquid for jars vs. a tupperware container. I needed 3 times the amount for 5 jars and 10 pickles cut into spears vs. what the recipe called for in one large tupperware container. One thing I did do was add a little more sugar for the first few days to tweak/dilute the vinegar flavor. Just my preference.

This was my first time making pickles.  They turned out great! Shared them with friends and even the ones that usually don't care for pickles enjoyed them. Very crisp and fresh!

I used sliced jalapeño peppers instead of cucumbers.  It turned out great!  I'm going to try using zucchini next time, maybe with a few peppercorns added.

I made my pickles exactly as the recipe specified, and I loved them!  My garden has produced an abundance of cucumbers this year, so I had several to pickle.  I  made one large batch of spears and one batch of hamburger slices.  They both came out crispy and flavorful!  I will make these again!

Made exactly as prescribed except I used 16 ounces of pickles.   After 1 week it tastes very good, still think it might get better over time, so will let it sit for another week and see that happens.

Love these!  I used more garlic and dried dill, results was great, perfect with sandwiches.  Like the fresh crispness of the cucumber chips.

These were extremely easy to make. I did not change a thing. After four days they were delicious! Nice and crisp, not overly spicy. Just right for my family. You could add some more dill and spice if you wanted. I like them the way they are. No more store bought pickles for us!

This is a terrific recipe! I followed the recipe exactly except I added more fresh dill and an extra clove of garlic per jar. It made 3 quarts. I cut the cukes in to chunky chips instead of spears. These remind me of the Claussen pickles you find in the refrigerator section at the store. Really yummy. Will definitely make these again!! PS I waited the full 3 days to taste!

Don't use English cucumbers. They tend to make soft pickles. I recommend using Kirby or Persian cucumbers. They have a better snap! Make sure you trim the blossom from the end of the cucumber. The blossom contains enzymes that makes a cucumber soft.

This was my first time making pickles! This recipe was wonderful! My new favorite pickle! I actually fallowed the recipe to a t (except i sliced instead of speared...just personal pickle preference). In the end i had so much "juice" left over i was able to make two jars of pickles!

This was my first attempt at making my own pickles (with cucumbers out of my own garden) and they are delicious! I dislike sweet pickles, so I followed the advice of some of the other reviewers and cut the sugar in half, just to be on the safe side. With this recipe, don't think I'll buy store pickles ever again!

I made no changes to the recipe and it turned out perfect! Nice and crunchy. I had enough liquid to fill 2 large mason jars of cucumbers. Will be using this recipe for all my extra cucumbers!

This was my first time making pickles with cucumbers and fresh dill from my garden. I liked this recipe for its easiness. I made several jars and gave some to neighbors. They all sort of liked them. The overall comments were that they were not salty enough. So I switched to kosher salt and doubled the amount. This took them from good to great.

Cool, crisp, delicious and easy to make.  I did not use any sugar.  Used pink himalayan sea salt.

For me, a bit too much vinegar flavor. I will use less next time.  I soaked the cucumber slices in ice and water while the boiling ingredients cooled.  Perfect!  After 3 days the cucumbers were still crisp.

The only change I made was to double the garlic. I slice the garlic in half first. I keep a jar in my fridge. My grandchildren love to make their own jars.

These were so easy & so delicious. I did buy pickling salt & used that in place of sea salt. I also added a little more dill & a few whole peppercorns to each jar. My whole family, extended family included, loved these. My sister-in-law gave one to a woman at work & she asked if she could have a jar! I had an abundance of straight eight cucumbers from my garden & made the pickles from them. I read on many threads (gardening especially) not to use these kind because they will get soft. Well, I tried it because my point was not to make the pickles, my point was to find a use for all my cucumbers. They stayed crunchy for a week, for sure. The second week, maybe a little softer, not bad at all, though.  By the third week they were a little too soft for me. So, if you gave them out to friends & family & everyone ate them within the first week or two, you're fine to use straight eight cucumbers. This was a really great recipe & I enjoyed making them & getting the rave reviews from others.

This recipe was great. I multiplied it by 6 because I had an abundance of cucumbers from my garden and I canned them. I think I misread and added too much sugar. I also  didn't have enough pickling spice to do all 6 so I just used what I had (which was enough for 2 batches). Nice an crispy. I also used more garlic and dill then suggested.

These weren't very good.  I followed the recipe, and they were extremely bland, just tasted like vinegar after 1 week in the fridge.  At that point  I added some generic pickling spices to them, and waited another week, but still didn't improve it much.   My family didn't care for them either.

I do not know if I did something wrong or if this is simply not to my liking. I followed the directions to the letter but in the end, these just tasted like cucumber spears in vinegar. The dill did not infuse itself into the spears, nor did the garlic. To be honest, I much prefer the flavour of simply marinating cuke slices overnight in white vinegar. Chef John's B&B pickles saved the day for me and were a huge success.

Perhaps adding the dill to the vinegar as it boiled and the cucumber spears to the hot vinegar mixture might have helped but I do not think I will bother testing it out. Time to look for a different Dill Pickle recipe.

I do not eat pickles, so I personally so not know how these tasted, but my son loved them and compared them to the ones he eats at Isaac's Restaurant. I did not have fresh dill, so I substituted with two tbsps of dry dill.

Really a Great Recipe. Usually, we make my Mom's Sweet Pickle recipe (TREMENDOUS), but I decided to make something different. I had a lot of fresh dill in the garden plus COSTCO had a sale on baby cucumbers - What Can I say? GREAT Results with this recipe. Only thing I substituted was PENZEY's Minced Garlic (THE GOOD STUFF-There is a difference so be sure to ask for the GOOD STUFF) for garlic cloves. 
Wonderful Results and the longer the pickles soak, the better they get. I did these whole but I think next time I would halve the whole dills to get more flavor out of them. 
Thanks for a Great Alternative to Jarred/Store-Bought Pickles.

LOVED!  What a surprise!  I have never made pickles before.  But this year my husband's garden has an abundance of cucumbers.  These were super EASY and were perfect.  I left them in the refrigerator for a week.  Go for it.  Now I'm making more to give away.  Those cucumbers are going fast.  lol

Very easy, now to wait the three days to taste :) I will be back...the spears don't absorb flavors as well as the chips did. So I will make again but will only make chips. Also use fresh vinegar as mine was weaker than it should have been as it was from last year's canning season. It worked but it could have been stronger. Otherwise a good pickle on a sandwich and easy to make small quantity (no one but me eats pickles!). Thanks!

As much as I wanted to, we didn't like this recipe. Not enough flavor, and the vinegar taste was too strong. Followed the recipe to a T. I tossed the ones I made to use my jars for a different recipe.

Loved these pickles with a few modifications.  Lots more garlic, a few peppercorns and a dash of red pepper flakes. Reusing the brine pickling more cucumbers and green beans!  Anxious to try them tomorrow!

My family thought this recipe was very yummy. Flavor was a little weaker than I would have liked. Next time I am going to try cutting back on the amount of water and adding more salt and garlic.

First time making pickles, and I thought they came out great! I cut back on the sugar per some of the reviews, but after making them found I'd prefer them sweeter. Better than too sweet and not being able to fix it, I guess. I added more sugar now to the liquid, so I'll see what happens. Didn't have the head of dill so used dried; it was hard to judge how much to use, but next time I'll add it more sparingly. A nice, easy recipe with no canning involved. Great Fourth of July treat! Thanks for the recipe, Tammy!

This was my first time making pickles and we love them! Super easy (however, not really a 10 min prep time) I made a few modifications and they still turned out just how I hoped.

I made this and my whole family were crazy about it. I didn't think making pickles could be so easy.

I have made these pickles a number of times with Persian cucumbers-cut into chip, spear or halves today I will cut them into sandwich planks-endless possibilities with this recipe. Thank you for sharing!

We have made these twice now and something isn't right!! They are really crisp, but have no taste but vinegar. I thought I forgot something the first time, so we tried again and the same outcome. :/

I can't help wondering if I did something wrong considering the positive reviews everyone else had, but these pickles were not good, and I'm more pretty accepting of anything made with vinegar. I used sliced cucumbers and they stayed nice as far as crispness and color (very pretty) but the taste was bad - not like a pickle at all. I would not discourage others from making them, due to the other good reviews, but have to say it was not to my liking.

The texture on these was okay, but none of us thought they tasted good.

I just made these tonight and they were very simple.  I was unsure about the quantity of cucumber and how much it made. I used 6 cucumber and yielded 2 quarts.  Stay tuned for tasting!
