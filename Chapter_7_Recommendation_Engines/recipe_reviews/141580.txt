I have looked for this recipe in the past, but could not remember the name of it until now. Growing up, my best friend's mom made this often for us.
It is delicious and easy! She used all different flavors of gelatin. I remember that strawberry and orange were especially good. Yum !!...can't wait to make this !!!

This is a great recipe.  I cut the amount of sugar to 1/2 cup and didn't miss it at all.  In fact, next time I make this, I will only use 1/4 of a cup because it was still quite sweet.  I also added a bit of cinnamon and ginger to the crust for a little flavour.  So easy and definately a crowd pleaser.

Yum, delicious and easy.  Following the advice of the previous review, I also used half the sugar, and the sweetness was just right.  I opted to use fresh lime juice (the juice of one lime). I didn't know you could beat evaporated milk stiff, so it was a new experience for me. I'm going to make this recipe for my daughter's class when she shares the book "Pickle Chiffon Pie". Thanks, Patti!

This was okay. A little too tart and texture was on the foamy side... but it was definitely edible.

Well this was'nt my favorite but okay. I was in a little rush and I probably should have beat the evaporated milk  little better because it was a little too creamy. But the taste was okay anyway.

I wasn't blown away by this pie. I've been looking for a recipe similar to this, and haven't had any luck locating. I followed the directions exactly, and it was too much sugar. The texture of the filling was a bit foamy. Overall, it was good and light. I did receive compliments. However, this is not something I'll make again.

This has been my favorite pie for decades.  I'd never seen a recipe for it anywhere except my mom's old recipe box.

There are two significant differences with how Mom made it, though.  First, we only use 1/3 of a cup of sugar.  I can't imagine a whole cup.    Second, we always used a chocolate crust.    The Oreo crusts are what I use now.

I agree with others to reduce the sugar
