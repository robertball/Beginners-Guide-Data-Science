This is a very tasty dish.  I did make some changes.  i did not coat the tofu in cornstarch and deep fry it.  I used  just enough oil to brown the sides to cut down on the fat.  I also added some carrots and they were a nice touch.  The only other thing I will change next time is to add the tofu to the sauce sooner so that the sauce will soak into the tofu more.  I might also add baby corn because my husband and I like it.

A surprisingly hearty recipe that would be good for a cold winter night as it is so easy and satisfying! I added a little garlic and chili pepper for an extra kick, and omitted the cornstarch, letting the tofu simmer in the sauce.  The only other suggestion I have would be to put off adding the tomatoes until the last minute or they turn to mush.  This makes great leftovers too.  I'll be making this one again.

This was amazing! Yes the tomato cooked down, but the sauce tasted 10x better with tomato cooked in. Before, it tasted too much like white wine. At the end, I threw in some slices of tomato and put it over a low heat so the tomato could soften. I also added mushrooms, garlic and chili flakes. Delicious!

Absolutely delicious-I had to double the recipe though. My kids LOVE tofu! This was even better than most dishes you get in a restaurant. My teenage son is looking forward to cooking this himself very soon. Thanks so much for posting-this has become a family favorite. Soooo goood!!

This was pretty good.  I cooked the tofu in a little bit of oil instead of deep frying it.  And poured the dish over soba noodles instead of rice.

I skipped deep-frying the tofu and mixed it into the sauce (I used silken tofu for softness,) served it over black rice and it turned out great!  My family isn't used to eating tofu, so they weren't sure about it at first, but they cleaned their bowls!

I thought this was great.  The sauce has a really bright, tangy taste too it.  I would agree to wait to put the tomatoes in until last.  My husband would only give it a four, but he doesn't like stir-fry in general.  he said that for stir-fry, it was pretty good.

yum! Even my kids who "don't like tofu" liked this.  I didn't have any white wine on hand so I just subbed water for that, and it was still very tasty.  I will definitely make this again - served over brown rice (I omitted the rice and used splenda instead of sugar for a very tasty low carb dinner).  Thanks!

Delicious! This is a favorite of mine. It's so light yet filling and the flavor is amazing. I've even made this for my vegetarian friends by substituting in vegetable broth.

So easy and versatile!  The sauce is delicious.  I've always wondered how to cook up tofu like that - awesome!  (I freeze my tofu first, too - it makes it easier to get the liquid out and helps the texture.)  I substituted mushrooms and green peppers for the green beans, and canned fire roasted tomatoes (Muir Glen) for the fresh ones.  I also did my typical swapping out of the broth for a few tablespoons of nutritional yeast.  Makes it vegan and so good!

This was ok.  If I had ordered it at a restaurant I wouldn't have been upset with it, but I also wouldn't order it again.  Both my husband and I thought it was on the bland side, and we thought that the addition of a large amount of garlic would help.

I came across this recipe to use my Tofu w/ green beans. LOL... then I realized I only had snow pea pods.
I also substituted a shot of Vodka for the dry wine. Honestly, it was cold out and I didn't want to go to the store. With a couple shortcuts I made, this recipe still came out "Fantastic!"
I posted a picture of it also.

Loved this. Simple. Flexible - many different veggies can be used. Tasty. My vegetarian family loved this - even the baby! Thanks for sharing.

We did not care for this at all, and i even followed the directions. We ended up, unfortunately, eating out instead. My family and i eat Vietnamese food regularly and this was nothing i've ever tasted before.

Great flavor, not spicy. Could substitute asparagus and I think it might be a five star!

Very tasty recipe.  I prepared this dish for my mom and she is not a tofu eater at all and was looking at me rather crazy when I was cooking it.  However, she ended up eating a full plate (she still never admitted that she really liked it - but her plate was empty!)  I definitely will be making this again!

Pretty good recipe! I would have given 5 stars if the original recipe had more spice to it, so we fried the tofu in some curry to spice it up a bit. We also added carrots and tri-colored green beans. We used chardonnay in our sauce as well, and put the dish over rice. Give it a try!

turned out pretty good.  We used sake, instead of white wine (is that sacrilege when the recipe is Vietnamese?), definitely left the tomatoes out until the end, no cornstarch, and we julienned the onions for texture.  Didn't try it, but thought it would have gone really well with soba noodles

We LOVED this recipe - even my picky boyfriend liked it. I didn't have cornstarch or bamboo - so I substituted flour and mushrooms respectively. I would definitely recommend rice, since the sauce is so good. We dirtied a lot of pans, but it was worth it.

Taste was good and everybody liked it, especially the tofu.  Not sure if I will make it again though...
