After making this recipe as described, I thought it was good, but made a few adjustments to make it great. 1) Instead of the pea/corn mixture, I buy a frozen vegetable package called "latino blend." This package contains corn, black beans, tomatoes and green peppers, which add more body to the dish and makes it more Mexican. (If you can't find it in your freezer aisle, then I would use frozen corn and two cans of black beans instead. The peas just didn't blend well with the other ingredients.) 2)I have yet to find a decent packaged taco seasoning, so I just make my own: salt, pepper, garlic powder, chili powder, paprika, cumin, a touch of cinnamon (or allspice) and red pepper flakes if I want some heat (amounts depend on your own taste preferences). 3) For the potatoes, perhaps this goes without writing, but I pour the mashed potatoes on top and then spread evenly with a knife, otherwise, some sections will be thicker than others. 4) Finally, place the pan on a tray. The pie won't boil over or anything, but it is heavy and just makes it easier to place in and out of the oven. The dish does take time, but while the pie is cooking I make a simple side salad and the overall effect is a great winter, comfort meal far better than any meatloaf. Thanks for the recipe!

Very good. I did take the suggestion of another reviewer, however, and used black beans instead of the peas, and sour cream instead of the milk, for a more Mexican flair. Add just enough milk after mixing the mashed potatoes and sour cream to make it more spreadable, then top the beef mixture. In the last 5 min. of baking, I removed the casserole from the oven, and while it heated up to Broil, I brushed some melted butter over the top of the mashed potatoes and topped this with some shredded tex-mex cheese. Then, under the broiler until lightly browned. This gave it a slightly more crusty top, which appealed to my family. I made up a batch of the "Taco Seasoning I" recipe for use in this.

I liked this more than classic shepherd's pie - it was tastier and more interesting. I made a few changes. I halved the peas and corn, added a can of kidney beans, doubled the taco seasoning and left out the spicy salt and put grated cheddar cheese on top of the mashed potato (strongly recommended!).

I used black beans instead of peas and sprinkled cheese on top.  I used regular seasoned salt, which was fine, but it would have been better had the dish been more spicy...maybe crushed red pepper flakes would have been good.

I made this vegetarian by substituting  fake meat and a can of baked beans for the meat. Also my husband sprinkled the top of the mashed potatoes with corn chip pieces to give it some crunch. It was excellent!

I didn't have any potatoes, so I topped it with cornbread batter mixed with cheese and chopped fresh jalapenos and left out the peas. The gang loved it.

Added black beans, skipped the peas and added some enchilada sauce to the meat mixture.   Spiced up the mashed potatoes by mixing in a little salsa.  My family loved it!

I've tried this recipe as directed and switching the veggies to the "Mexicana blend" (corn, chopped onions, peppers and tomatoes, with black beans).  I've used mashed potatoes and rosemary garlic mashed potatoes.  A nice seasoning blend from the original!

This was good. I used can corn because I hate the taste of frozen. I also don't use packaged seasonings so I used 1 Tbsp of cumin and chili powder and a pinch of crushed red pepper flake. I also heated to milk and butter before added them to the potatoes.

I omitted the seasoning salt and doubled up on the taco seasoning.  Added a few sprinkles of cayenne.  Also used black beans instead of the peas and 1/2 the corn. I used sour cream in the potatoes instead of milk in keeping with the tex mex theme.  Also grated some cheese on top of the potatoes.

My family really liked this recipe. This was my first attempt at making Shepherd's pie and I liked flavoring the meat with taco seasoning. I might add more seasoning next time. I cut back on the amount of garlic cloves though.

Excellent. Like another reviewer, I used can corn and cumin and chili powder instead of taco seasoning. I also added cayenne pepper and used turkey instead of beef.

Was pretty good. Followed the suggestions of others on here to make it more authentic. I'd definitely recommend some hot sauce on it after it's done.

I love this recipe! It's so easy. I use my own taco seasoning mix and then open a bag of frozen mixed vegetables, works well and tastes great. Top it off with the garlic mashed potato recipe from America's test kitchen and it makes for a filling dinner that the hubby always has two helpings of. Thanks for a great recipe!

I just tried this recipe - Yummy!!  The only I changed was to add shredded cheddar cheese, which I added after I baked it for the recommended time.  It is a quick & easy meal that I will make again!  Thanks!!

This was a very tasty alternative to traditional shepherd's pie. I made it with frozen mixed veg as that is what was on hand & added a can of black beans as suggested by other reviews. This will be made again & I will be sharing this with others!
