I made this exactly as written and would definitely make changes if I were to try this again. First off, the cook time is way too long. I checked mine at 26 minutes and I had to quickly rush and pull it from the oven. The eggs were overcooked with a dark brown peeling layer on the bottom.  A lower oven temperature would also help.  I also found it was lacking in flavor. During cooking, the seasonings seemed to all float up to the surface and caused the top to have a dark speckled coloring.  This is definitely easy to make though, so 2 stars for that! Some additions that would help with flavor are garlic and/or onion powder and shredded cheese. I would leave the paprika out next time and use half the amount of pepper.
