This cookie has become a much anticipated addition to my Christmas cookie platter.  I follow the recipe exactly but I make them bite size and just bake them for 15 minutes.  Delicious~!

These were pretty good. I was concerned with the little amount of sugar at first, but when measuring I didn't completely level it, so it added a little extra to my recipe. I thought they were going to be more like a chocolate pecan sandie cookie. But, they tasted just like a "chocolate version of a snowball cookie." I used a 1 Tblsp. cookie scoop and put the cookies on parchment instead of a sprayed pan. I got 32 baked cookies from the recipe. When cool I did coat them with the powdered sugar, but it took about twice as much as instructed. Thanks again, MARBALET for another simple to follow and good recipe. As they remind me of snowballs, I may make these as a Christmas cookie this year.

I made these today and they turned out great!  This is a keeper,  I followed the recipe as written.  I thought the dough was a bit loose so I chilled for an hour before forming my balls.

AMAZING!!!!!
     Just amazing! I love this stuff and will definently make it again! 

  P.S.LET THEM COOL DOWN 100% THEN HAVE A DAMP CLOTH (SQUEEZE & DRAIN THE CLOTH AS MUCH AS YOU CAN) AND ROLL EACH SANDI ON IT ,THEN IN POWDERED SUGAR ...IT PICKS UP MORE POWDERED SUGAR THAT WAY ..

I will absolutley make these on every holiday !!!!!!

I followed this recipe to the letter. These were good, but almost too crumbly. They fall apart as soon as they're bitten, but at least they taste good as they crumble.

So I changed the recipe just a bit- I omitted pecans and substituted about a cup of mini chocolate chips. I also added a little more cocoa powder than called for; I like the rich flavor that cocoa powder offers. They baked for 25 minutes perfectly. I let them cool for 20-30 minutes before placing them in a gallon size Ziplock bag to coat them with powdered sugar.  All in all a really nice Christmas cookie that I will make again :)

Excellent little cookie, I love how the cocoa taste comes through!  I added sliced almonds instead of pecans cause that's what I had on hand, they came out very tasty! Also I have made these twice and did not bother with the powdered sugar, they still were great tasting without being overly sweet!

I've made these a few times and love it!  Very nutty and just enough chocolate goodness.  Sandies are typically a drier cookie than most, so if you are expecting a moist chewy cookie, this recipe is not for you.

I follow the ingredients exactly but make the portions smaller because they tend to crumble apart.  I find that chilling the mixture for a few minutes and squeezing them tight when forming into balls prevents crumbling.  Also, I don't bother with the powdered sugar.  It is good as is.

I made these on my day off following the ingredients exactly. However, I followed a couple of tips from some of the other reviews instead. I chilled the dough one hour in the refrigerator before forming the cookies. It seemed to better the consistency. I also only baked the cookies for 15-minutes which was plenty. Then I doubled the amount of confectioners sugar for rolling the cookies in. I think they turned out pretty near perfect. I'll be making these every Christmas from now on!

This is a great recipe!  I used peanuts instead of pecans because that's what I had and it turned out wonderful.  Thank you Holly!

These are what they are, chocolate pecan SANDIES! I guess I'm not that much of a sandy textured cookie, but they are easy to make and are exactly what they advertise. A chocolatey, pecan-filled, dryish cookie. Tasty, but not a favorite in my house. For those of you who like sandy cookies, a winner!

Fabulous recipe and it was well received at the cookie exchange I made it for. Whenever I make a recipe from here, I follow it exactly the first time. I read through all the reviews and was a bit concerned about whether to refrigerate it or not. Actually I had no problem with making the dough into balls. I doubled the recipe as I needed 8 dozen and it made a little more than that. And there is nothing I would change in this recipe.

Delectable and so very easy. This recipe is worth trying. After making these a few times to my family's delight, I played around with the flavor by decreasing the vanilla extract to one half teaspoon and adding one half teaspoon of almond extract. It was worth the experiment. If you want less clean up, you can mix well by hand instead of an electric mixer.  "Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food, with a daily dose of chocolate."

These were ok. I am a fan of these types of cookies and was very eager to make the chocolate version of a pecan balls, butterball, or the many names these delicious little cookies go by. I found these dry and by dry, I mean, choking dry. The flavor was not the chocolate I had expected. If I make them again, I will read more reviews and do my own experimenting.

First time making sandies. With that being said, these were easy to make and delicious! The first time I made these I followed the recipe as written, The chocolate was a bit strong and they were not very sweet. The second time I made these, I used walnuts because that's what I had, I reduced the amount of cocoa powder to 1/8 cup and put 2 tbsp of brown sugar and 3 tbsp of white sugar. I didn't chill the dough, just rolled into balls and baked them for 15min..that's important!!! That's why some reviewers are complaining of dryness. I let my cookies cool on the baking sheets. That's the key so they don't break apart. AGAIN, be patient, don't try and move them around while they are still hot. Lastly, I filled a container with powdered sugar and roll the cookies around:) these are my favorite cookies from now on!

I followed the directions exactly. There is no flavour to these cookies. Perhaps when I add the icing sugar it will add some sweetness. They are so very dry and crumble apart when you bite into them. I read the other reviews and adjusted my cook time to 20 mins. Still too long.
The next batch I baked for 15 mins and when rolled in icing sugar they were delicious.

This was my first experience making Sandies, and while the cookies came out with really nice aroma, it ended up being super-dry (I baked them for about 23 minutes, since my oven tends to under-cook baked goods when I follow recipes).  It dried out my entire mouth by essentially turning into flour consistency in my mouth.

I should have probably just stopped baking at around 15 minutes, but given my inexperience with baking this type of cookie, I had *no* idea when they were done!  (I wish there was some guideline for telling when the cookies were done.)  I recommend following others' recommendations and not baking nearly as long as the recipe says.
