After reading some previous reviews, I was a little skeptical about trying this recipe.  I decided to go ahead and try it and make some of my own modifications.  I was cooking for everyone at my house as well as my parents, so I used 7 boneless chops that I seasoned with Old Bay.  I cut up a small onion, 1/2 of a small can of mushrooms and 3 cloves of garlic.  I sauteed that mixture and the chops in a little olive oil until they were brown on both sides.  I used 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup and mixed that with 2/3 cup of milk, the sauteed garlic, onions and mushrooms and omitted the water completely. Baked it all uncovered at 350 for 45 minutes.  The gravy ended up being the best gravy I think I have ever tasted and it wasn't too thick or thin.  Served it with mashed potatoes and corn.  I will definitely be making this one often.  Thanks for sharing!

WOW.  Can I give it ten stars?  Reviewers said it needed a bit of perking up so I fiddled just a tad.  The sauted chops were topped with an onion slice.  I added a package of pork gravy mix and a cup of water to the soup, and some Old Bay and onion powder, then poured it over the chops to bake.  You could cut them with a fork, and we were licking the bones to get the last of the gravy.  Absolutely the best baked pork chops I've ever had, this is definitely going in our rotation.

I've been making a version of this recipe for years and will continue to do so because it is delicious.  I use cream of chicken soup (we don't like cream of mushroom soup) and just add a little water to make the gravy.  I also add a pinch of garlic and season all.  I ususally don't bake it, just simmer it slow in a skillet.  This is great comfort food when served with mashed potatoes.

The first time I made these, followed directions except after browning pork chops, I sauteed onion and fresh mushrooms in pan drippings.  It was tasty but a little dry and chewy.  I made these the second time using my basic pork chop philosophy, low and slow. I again sauteed onion and fresh mushrooms, added a little Kitchen Bouquet (for color and a little additional flavor) and cooked the chops at 275 degrees for 3 hours.  They were extremely tender and flavorful, no knife required, and JUST DELICIOUS.  This is definitely a keeper now.

Recipe is pretty good base to start from.  Even better with sauteed mushrooms, onions, and Tbs. of Worcestire sauce added into the sauce.  Just be sure to adjust your salt accordingly as the Worcestire is plenty salty in itself.  Additionally, 4 or 5 potatoes thinly sliced then sauteed in tbs. butter for a few mins. with Tbs. or so of fresh chopped parsley and tsp. or so minced garlic.... then layer these on the bottom of your greased casserole before adding the chops.  Increase the milk in this recipe to 1 and 1/4 cups to accomodate for the potato addition and pour over chops and potatoes. Cover, then bake for 30 mins.  Remove cover and continue baking until potatoes are done to fork tender (approx. additional 15-20 mins.)  You could also shake n' bake your pork chops prior to browning for an additional flare. Sprinkle dish with remaining bread crumbs or shake n' bake mixture for some crunchiness. Serves great with steamed fresh green beans or asparagus and a loaf of fresh bread or dinner rolls. This is an easy yet wonderfully tasty comfort meal.  And the recipe is flexible enough for adjusting to your own family's tastes and tradition.  Fast and troublefree enough to make during a busy weeknight that tastes like you've been slaving at the stove for hours. Definitely a keeper for the recipe box.  Would also work well with chicken breasts.

I've been baking this for years and yes, it is easy and delicious.  It also works well with Cream of Chicken soup if you have a non=muchroom eater in the family as I do. Any cream soup works and you can also change the seasonings to keeo it new.  Try it!!  My mom used to make this and that's where I got it.  I think she said it was an old girl scout recipe.   Good luck.  Yopu can't mess this one up, I promise.

I sauteed the chops in olive oil and garlic first then used 2 cans of (reduced fat) cream of mushroom (as we love thick gravy) and omitted the water and milk.  This is a keeper and a regular dish in our house now.  Thanks!

I was searching for a "different" way of preparing pork chops and walah! This recipe turned out one of the best dinners I've made for my hubby and it was just TOO easy to make!! The only changes I followed was adding garlic powder, omitting the water, and cooking for less time(since I only made 2 not as thick chops). Excellent served with brown rice and biscuits!

Can not go wrong with this recipe. I did added roasted garlic mushroom soup just because we love that flavor.  Thanks for the post.

I seasoned my meat with salt, pepper, and garlic powder, used Cream of Chicken instead of Cream of Mushroom Soup and chicken broth instead of water.  Other than I followed the recipe as written and it was absolutely delicious.  Since some of the reviews indicated that the meat was not as tender as they hoped, I covered my pan with foil and the chops came out very moist and tender.

this recipe is great !!!! i give it 5 stars ***** . but i always like to add my own flair to my food and it was also a little bland, so instead of using two cans of cream of mushroom i experimented and instead i added one can of golden mushroom and one can of cream of onion and they were the BEST porkchops i have ever had in my LIFE . the different soup gives it alot more flavor trust me if you have been cooking for as long as i have been ( 25 years ) you know what great flavor is and this is it . so try it and trust me you will LOVE it .

Guess no matter where you go in all recipe people modify the recipe and rate what they did.  I followed this exactly only thing used thick cut pork chops so had to fry a bit longer obviously.  turned out great seasoned well and my family enjoyed it thank you for the share...P. S.  If people are going to rate their own recipe add it on here as your own recipe

I liked these, but my husband really LOVED them. I seasoned the chops well with seasoned salt, black pepper, onion and garlic powders. After sauteeing them till a nice golden brown, I added the water to the skillet and stirred up all those browned on bits. Added that to the soup/milk mixture and baked for about 35 minutes. They were perfect. Served over buttered  egg noodles with freshly steamed broccoli. Will definitely add fresh mushrooms next time as well.

We really like this. I followed the directions exactly except I doubled the recipe and I did have to bake it for about 15 minutes longer than the time recommended. Be careful with adding salt. This had plenty by the time I seasoned the pork chops before sauteing and the cream of mushroom soup has its own salt.

My family loved this. I pretty much followed the recipe. The only thing I did different was instead of regular salt and pepper. I seasoned with Larry's Season Salt and McCormick's Season All Pepper. Also, after browning the chops I just added the gravy mixture directly into my skillet and let them simmer on the stove for approx. 30-40 min depending on thikness of chop. Served with Mashed Potato, and Green Beens! This was great! And so simple!

Thanks!  The family LOVED this recipe.  I did make a few changes suggested by other reviewers to suit our tastes.  I sauteed onions, garlic & mushrooms in the pan after I seared the chops.  Then added the mush soup, milk & water.  Added a little tarragon too.  Then baked it all together.  The sauce, once thickened with a little cornstarch, made a wonderful gravy.  Based on the rave reviews from hubby & the kids, I will be making this a lot more.  Thanks for a simple & delicious recipe.

I have been making this recipe for years.  I add half a package of Lipton onion soup mix to the mushroom soup mixture to kick it up a notch.  Very easy recipe for a beginner cook.

I've been cooking this for years, the gravy is absolutely delicious, however, I add a lot more than one can. I put in 2 cans of golden mushroom and 2 cans of cream of mushroom.  There just NEVER can be enough gravy in my opinion!!!

WOW!  Great recipe.  I often use COM soup, but for some reason, this just tastes better.  I left out the water completely, and I cooked it for about 3 hours at 275-300 degrees.  I also added half a sliced onion.  Man, oh man...the gravy was superb!

Incredible! I used garlic salt instead of regular salt and it kicked up the flavor a bit. If using thin chops, saute for 4 minutes each side and cook in oven for 30-35 minutes.

this recipe came out FANTASTIC!!!!! got rave reviews from everyone. only modifications:  i seasoned the chops with a bit of salt and pepper, and a few generous shakes of garlic powder and onion powder before sauteeing in butter. also, i left out the water, just added a bit of milk. next time, i will use 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup, as there was just enough gravy for the chops, but not the garlic mashed potatoes and peas i made with this recipe. this is just SO good, the chops literally melt in your mouth. thanks!

These pork chops were delicious and easy to make after a busy day at work.  Well, actually, I put my chops in a glass pan over night with onions and sliced garlic and salt and  pepper .  This saved me a sted the next day.  When I got home from work I browned the chops, sauted the onions anad garlic and then pour the soup over and baked about 30 minutes.  They were very tender but also very salty.  Next time I won't add any extra salt, and I'll continue to leave out the milk and water.  Perfect over rice!  Garlic added that little extra umph.

Great recipe.  Easy to make and I could not believe how tender the chops turned out.  I did not have "Cream of Mushroom" soup so I used "Cream of Celery" and it was still very good and made a wonderful gravy.

I make this all the time, but I use half white wine and half milk instead of what's called for here, and I add a little ground sage to the salt and pepper when I season the chops.  If I have mushrooms, I sautee them in the pan after the chops are finished.  I also us Golden Mushroom instead of Cream of Mushroom frequently - it's even better.  I heat the soup in the same pan and use a whisk to break up lumps, scrape up all the browned bits and make it smooth before I pour it over the chops.  Served over mashed potatoes or egg noodles, it's the ultimate comfort food.  It's so quick and easy and people think you did something special!

Excellent recipe, and easy too!  I also added sliced sauted onions on the pork chops before pouring on the soup mixture? I MUST recommend using Trader Joe's Condensed Cream of Portabella Mushroom soup.  Campbell's soup can't compare!  Thanks for the recipe!

I've been making this recipe for years. After browning the chops, (I use lard for flavor) set them aside, I pour off the grease and add the mushroom soup to the pan. Then I kinda fry the soup in the pan a little bit and then add some kitchen bouquet, about 1/4 tsp. or so, (cuz a little goes a long way) for color and appeal. Add the milk or water pour over the chops in a baking dish and bake until done, about 45-50 min.  Sometimes,I also add about 1 1/2 tsp. soy sauce to the soup for flavor. Very good. BTW, I'm 70 years old so I've got a lot of cooking years under my belt, over 50 at least.

I enjoyed this with my family of eight.  I added garlic powder and black pepper while I browned the chops.  I also doubled it and put it over instant rice that was already cooked and then baked together.  Very good.

I have not cooked this exact recipe but I can, without a doubt, say it is great.  When 1st married and my husband was going to college, I used to stretch the pork chop by cutting into cubes, browning and adding mushroom soup and cooking until pork chop was done, served over mashed potatoes or noodles.  This was one of our gourmet meals!

This was delicious! I only baked two pork chops - great meal for two. Didn't have any cream of mushroom soup, so I used cream of potato soup instead - turned out great, the potato chunks in the soup were delicious and soft. I would recommend adding half an onion too - I added 1/4 of an onion and it tasted great. You should saute the onions in butter before putting them in to bake though! Overall it's a quick and easy recipe and the pork becomes unbelievably tender.

Been making this recipe for years.  I brown pork chops in onion and garlic then put in crock pot. Pour a few cans of cream of mushroom soup over the top and cook away.  No need to add any milk or water.  Turns out great every time.

I usually only make recipes with no less than 5 stars. This had 4 which was in my opinion, over rated. The chops were on the dry side and had a "gamey" taste. Not worth eating. Could be because the chops I used were not as thick as were called for in this recipe, but I will not attempt this again. Finished dish ended up in the trash. Will stick with 5 star recipes. Live and learn.

Served with a side of Rice and a veggie. A real family pleaser!
I read some of the other reviews. Some outstanding variations there that I will be trying in the future Thanks to all.

Easy weeknight meal!  Pork chops came out very tender.  Thanks for the recipe!  I am on WW, so I altered the recipe just a smidge to lower the fat.  I used 1 tsp. of light olive oil to fry and ultra-trimmed the center cut pork chops of all visible fat, used 2% milk and 98% fat free cream of mushroom soup.  I also made these in a 10" stainless steel oven-proofskillet and put it directly into the oven.  One pot!  I also made a side of oven roasted potatoes and a steamed veggie.  We put the gravy on everything.

I've been making this for years, but a tad different. I Brown chops in olive oil. Add Cream of Celery soup. Put soup under and on top. 2 cans for more gravy. Don't add milk or water, it will delute the flavor. Simmer on the stove on low to med for about 45 min. I use Pork shoulder steaks, so tender and yummy. Serve with mashed potatoes and Corn. So easy and everyone always loves it. No heating up the oven.

Very tender and flavorful. The sauce was runny, but after it was done baking I removed the chops from the pan and simmered sauce over flame and added a bit of flour to thicken. This made a fabulous gravy!

Twenty six years ago, when I was a young bride, I would make this dish. I never fried my pork and would add 2 cans of soup. Now, I would fry it and add some garlic and your favorite seasonings to add some life to this. I also would add a cup of minute rice to the soup mix. It's a very nice addition. This is good down home cookin! Thanks Jennifer!

This sounded kind of plain - but it was very good.
I added a can of mushrooms to butter when browning and sprinkled paprika on chops.  I also added dried minced onion, garlic and onion powder, salt/pepper to soup mixture and deleted the water.   Very nice, served with wild rice and peas and pearl onions.

They were realllllly good. I seasoned them with black pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, & minced garlic and set them in the fridge from about 6 hours. Later, I cooked them on the stove top as directed with onions and then baked them for 45 minutes. I served them with rice and steamed broccoli. The next time, and there will be a next time, I plan to use 2 cans of soup.

My family really like this, I have made something similar with beef before, but the pork is a nice change-up. This is a nice recipe to make in the crock pot, thats what I did. I added muchrooms, and an onion, and served it over mashed potatos. I will definatly make this again. Thanks Jennipoo!

Easy, moist, but lacked alot of flavor.  Sauteed onions and garlic while doing chops as others suggested.  Did use cream of chicken soup as we don't like mushrooms, perhaps cr. of mush is more flavorful and that was our problem.

This is a super easy recipe and doesn't require any special ingredients.  I had two 2-inch thick chops and I made a couple of changes based on previous reviews.  I seasoned chops with salt, pepper, garlic and onion and we seared them on the grill.  My gravy was 1 can condensed cream of chicken soup, 2 fresh bay leaves, 1 tbsp worchestershire, 1 can milk, 2 tbsp dijon mustard and one crushed garlic clove. I baked at 300f for 1.5 hours covered and 30 minutes uncovered.  Fabulous! Thanks for the easy recipe!

I have always breaded and fried my pork chops, but decided to stray from the norm with this recipe and i'm glad i did!  It was a really great variation on chops.  The only change I made was I sauteed a small onion and some minced garlic in olive oil and used that instead of the water that the recipe calls for!  I just mixed the soup/milk mixture in my large skillet with the onion and garlic and added a little touch of flour to make the gravy and it was spectacular!  Really moist chops and a delicious, creamy gravy.  Served with whole grain rice and it was a perfect complete meal!!  Thanks for the recipe!!

I've made this twice now and both times my family has loved it.  I make the gravy as directed but I add garlic powder and paprika as well as a little extra salt and pepper.  Then I chop 1/2 an onion and put it in the gravy mixture as well.  While I'm cooking the meat in the pan I make some rice and then put the cooked rice at the bottom of the pan and top with meat and gravy!

I just made something very much like this.  I did not use milk, however, I dusted the pork chops with a bit of regular flour before I browned them, so that added thickening. I also added 1 large yellow onion, coarse chopped; 1/2 pound of fresh mushrooms, quartered;  and 8 golf ball sized red potatoes, cut in half. It was a great meal-in-a-pan!!!

Too much liquid and it was too thin - next time I would skip the milk and water or use less than a full can of soup.  Based on reviews that it's too bland, I also added thyme and minced onion to the soup mixture and more seasoning to the pork chops.

This recipe is simple to follow, and I made it with 6 thin cut pork chops and it turned out wonderful! I cooked this for my parents with green beans and red potatoes, and they rated it 5 stars --- and my dad is picky, so this says a lot! Very tasty.

The lowest rating I every gave any recipe.  I followed the tips and added the onions and garlic powder, used cream instead of milk, added the extra can of soup and it was terrible.  No one in the family liked.

This has been an old standby for years and I make it when we feel like "comfort food".  As suggested by other reviewers, cutting back on the milk and covering the dish makes a big difference. I always add fresh sauteed mushrooms and garlic, plus fresh rosemary (to taste).

Ok...so this was my 2nd time making this and I did some modifications and it was delicious!!!  I used 1can cream of celery and 1/2 can of cream of chicken.  I sauteed onion and minced garlic with the pork chops.  I mixed the canned soup with 1/2 cup of milk and 1/4 cup white cooking wine and poured over the pork before baking.  It turned out tender and amazing.  I served with the candied carrots from this site and some pork stuffing.  Excellent meal and base recipe.

This needs 10 stars! I seasoned chops with greek seasoning, sage and thyme, then sauted in a little oil. Put a sliced onion, 2 bay leaves & whole celery stalk in bottom of casserole dish and laid chops on top. Mixed Cream of Mushroom Robust Garlic soup, 1 packet pork gravy mix, and one can water..poured on top then baked. Remove bay leaves and celery before serving. Umm Umm GOOD! Made enough gravy for all meat plus mashed potatos.

Yea- an easy and tasty chop!  I used cream of chicken soup and chicken broth instead of water and cream of mushroom soup.  Then, when I scooped enough "gravy" out to pour on the chops- I dumped leftover rice into the rest and had a yummy side dish!

As odd as this sounds, I used cream of broccoli soup for this recipe (reason being..well my picky girl is on to me with the cream of mushroom soups).  My personal preference would be the mushroom, but well, It's all about the kids right?  I also just simmered them on the stovetop like someone else suggested.  The kids enjoyed as did I (hubby ate ribs).  Thanks Jennifer!

I didn't have Cream of Mushroom handy, so I tried it with a large can of Cream of Chicken and the same amount of liquid.  When I browned the chops (I used boneless), I added chopped onions.  It was pretty good, but I will try it again with the mushroom, and I'm sure it will be better.

I listened to other reviews and sauted onions and garlic, added extra seasoning to the chops, and added a can of the Golden Mushroom soup. I added a little bit of milk and water to the soups and poured it in the pan after the chops were taken out so I can get the bits and seasonings from the pan, poured it over the chops and put it in the oven for about 45 minutes.  The gravy was delicious but my chops were not as tender as I thought they would be.  Maybe I seared them too long?  Everyone else loved it, served with mashed potatoes and cream corn. Next time I'll probably cook them  at 325 for 50 minutes.

I also have been making a very close version (I add minced garlic) of this recipe for 50 years.  Its hard to imagine a month going by that this is not on my supper menu.  I also have done it with sirloin steak & its equally good.  Its great to see some young cooks on this website.  Its also nice to see them get excited over an old recipe that is new to them.  Thanks for sharing!

Have been making this for years, only call it pork chop stew. I thick slice russet potatoes and line the bottom of 13/9 pan. Add the really browed chops on top of potatoes , thick slice an onion place rings on top of potatoes, pour heated mushroom mixture with the  browned bits and a dash or Worcestershire over all, cover with tin foil, bake until done remove foil , sprinkle bread crumbs and a little Parmesan and and bake until golden brown. Excellent!

I made this one night to use up some porkchops that I'd nearly forgotten about. I didn't have any cream of anything soup, so I had to make a substitute. I also added some sliced onions and minced garlic. I ended up doubling the gravy to serve over mashed potatoes. It turned out AMAZING. My husband licked his plate clean and my toddler asked for seconds. This is now part of our dinner rotation, and I always make sure to have a few cans of cream-of-mushroom-soup on hand.

I tried this with very thin boneless pork loins and it was great!  The only change I made was that I cooked up 1/2 of red onion & a tablespoon of minced garlic in which to brown the pork because my family likes food with a bit of a bite. I also only baked them for 35 minutes as they were quite thin. I will most definitely make this again!

WOW! This was the best pork chop recipe I have ever made. Husband said pork chops flavor reminded him of KFC comfort food awesomeness. I seared 5 thick cut boneless chops in butter w/ sea salt & garlic powder. After reading other reviews I mixed 1 can cream of chicken soup and 1/2 can cream of mushroom soup. No water or milk. Baked in a glass casserole dish uncovered on 360 degrees for 45 minutes. Served with mashed potatos. The gravy is the best gravy I have ever made & I didn't have to add anything to it. I finally found the perfect pork chop recipe. Thanks!

So so so so good!!! Thank you so much for sharing they turned out awesome, juicy and very tasty. I followed the recipe as you have it, my only modifications where that I cooked 6 pork chops, added the butter dripping from the pan into the soup mix along with some chopped mushrooms. Everyone loved it! Thank you :)

I love the simplicity of this, and how juicy it makes the pork chops.  However, when I measured the internal temperature of the chops after the stated cooking time, it was 25 degrees LESS than it should be for safety. I will experiment to discover how to increase the internal temperature in the least amount of cooking time while preserving the juiciness.

I made this with cream of celery soup instead of mushroom soup only because The Husband won't eat mushrooms in anything he thinks there Gross, but I love them. But anywho he loved it. Took the leftovers for lunch the next day. Although I did cook for longer than 45min. Half way thru cooking I covered with foil and cooked for an extra 20 min. It came out very tender. Gravy was great on potatos. I will be making this again. Thanks for sharing.

I enjoyed this version it was a delicious recipe. I made a few changes the second time i tried this recipe. The first thing i did was sauted an onion and a bellpepper in margarine and set aside. I also substituted cream of mushroom soup for cream of chicken. I used margarine instead of butter. I placed the sauted vegetables over the porkchops then i added the soup mixture. I also added 1 tsp of minced garlic.

These are good. They are even better with Golden Mushroom soup and you can make them in the crock pot, they melt in your mouth!!!!

I have never reviewed a recipe before on this website but I thought this was worth reviewing. Great base recipe, very satisfying.  Here are a few changes I made to give it more depth and flavor.  Seasoned the chops with Mrs. Dash spicy seasoning and sauteed with butter, added a few cloves of minced garlic.  Once the chops were browned, I transferred them to the baking dish and added a little water to the frying pan to release all of the garlic bits & seasoning.  I added that to 2 cans cr. of mushroom and 1 can golden mushroom soup along with a 1/2 cup milk.  Baked for 50 minutes at 350.  AH-MAZING!!!!

I can't say enough about this delicious recipe! I made it with 5 thick boneless chops,used the mushroom soup recipe from this site and omitted the milk(already had it in the soup recipe) and lots of fresh chopped mushrooms. I used some leftover hash browns for the bottom potatoes & they sort of cooked into the gravy.The chops fell about with a fork! I had green peas for the side dish and white rice,which mixed great with the wonderful extra gravy!  It was perfect & so flavorful..made plenty for 2 meals. Good thing because my husband was crazy for it! We ate the rest next day with rice $ hot rolls and it was so good. I'm thinking now of trying it with turkey breasts for Thanksgiving,& chicken breasts before that! Thank you SO much for sharing this. Its so good!

I used six boneless chops, not as thick as the recipe specified.  Used one can cream of mushroom, one of cream of chicken (because that's what I had).  Added some garlic powder before I browned the chops.  Only used about 1/2 or 3/4 cup milk, no water.  I browned them in a little olive oil instead of butter.  Chops were flavorful and tender, and gravy was perfect for the mashed potatoes I made as a side dish.  This will probably be my go-to recipe for chops when I do not want to grill them.

I happened to have some incredibly delicous, lean porkchops and a can of cream of mushroom.  I happened upon this recipe when I searched 'How To Make Really Good Porkchops", so I tried this recipe and fell in love with it.  Def. one I'll have to do again in the future! Yum!

I like things spicy, so I added spices, a sauteed onion and a good bit of garlic to this recipe. It still came out incredibly bland, and the chops were dry. Very disappointing.

I made this for dinner last night and was happy with the flavor. I followed the recipe with the exception to using canned soup. I have a nasty allergy to MSG so I make my own condensed soup to use when I cook. Thanks for sharing this recipe..I know I will be making this again (:

Great recipe added some onion and garlic powder after tasting. I hate dirtying so many dishes so I seared these in an ovensafe skillet and added the soup then popped in the oven. I followed several reviewers advice and used Old Bay which I did not care for with this dish. I think Lawry's Seasoned Salt would be better. Also, I don't know about anyone else but these did not melt in my mouth. Never had a pork chop that did. Just my 2 cents.

This recipe is definitely a keeper!  So simple but oh so good!  I didn't have any cream of mushroom so I used cream of chicken soup instead.  I also added some sauteed onions.  IT WAS GRRRRREAAAAT!!!  My family loved it and I will be making this again and again!

These were fantastic!! I like others on here made a few changes. I sauteed onion and mushrooms in the pork chop drippings and added that to the soup mixture. I didn't use water, only milk, added a little kitchen bouquet and cooked using the low and slow method. So tender, didn't even need a knife.

I only had a can of cream of chicken with herbs on hand so I used that.  It was a 5, but I imagine plain old cream of mushroom would have been much more bland, hence the 4 stars.  Still good either way, shops were very tender after 1 hour at 375.

These were very very good.  I used very thick cut pork chops, and that was a mistake.  The thinner the better.  Also, the gravy was very very thin at the end.  So, I took it out of the pan and thickened it on the stove top with some corn starch.  It was very flavorful.  Thank you!

It's not often I run to my computer right after dinner to review a recipe, but felt I had to with this one.  It was absolutely delicious...good ol' downhome comfort food and there is no way it could have been easier.  I used 98% fat free cream of mushroom and seasoned 3 relatively thick boneless chops with garlic and onion powder, seasoned salt and pepper before browning.  Followed everything else as written and these turned out great - super tender and very flavorful.  Gravy thickened up nicely in last 10 minutes of cooking.  Served with fresh sweet corn on the cob and instant mashed potatoes (which I rarely use) but this gravy even made those stand out.  Definitely a keeper and can't wait to make again soon!

These were alright.  I added some more seasoning because I felt that the sauce was a little bland, and my pork chops were butterfly cut, so it was easier to cook them slowly on the stove than try to make them in the oven.  Not a bad base recipe though.

I absolutely loved this recipe.  Like most people though, I tweaked it quite a bit, but I never would have thought of it without seeing this recipe first.  The chops and "gravy" came out so tasty you'd think you were eating in a fine restaurant.  The chops were tender and could be cut with a fork!    I used center cut pork chops and browned them in my enamel cast iron dutch oven with a little peanut oil.  once they were almost done browning, I threw in a chopped up scallion and sauteed that for a minute.  Salted and peppered well at this point.  De-glazed the pan with sherry wine, threw on a can of condensed potato soup, and into the oven at 250 for 1 hr 45 min.  Took it out  of oven and removed the chops.  Added about 4oz chicken broth to the pan to make the gravy less thick.    Next time I'll add some sliced mushrooms.  I now also want to try this same technique with chicken, using marsala with cream of mushroom soup.  I think it will make an awesome and easy chicken marsala.

This recipe is much better suited for the crock pot.  I ruined some nice chops with this recipe.  I took the advice of others and spiced them up some more, then followed the directions as written.  I came out with tough chops sitting in soupy mess.  My advice would be to not add the water and definitely cook in a crockpot or very very slow in the oven.

I took the advice of other cooks and sauteed a small onion and generously coated the chops with garlic salt and freshly ground pepper.  While the onions were sauteeing, I threw in a couple tablespoons of Worchestershire sauce and let that saute a few minutes more.  I used a 8"x8" ceramic dish and layered the onions, then the browned chops and topped it with the mushroom soup/milk/water mix.  I used a lower temp. - 325 degrees for 1.5 hours since my husband was on the golf course and didn't come home exactly as planned. I'm sure that's never happened to anyone else!

I just covered the pan on the stove top and let it simmer.  It was just as good as putting it in the oven and one less step.

Our family has been eating this for years, with a few changes: We don't add water, and a little less milk. Slice 1/4 of an onion and saute it with the chops, along with just a touch of garlic, half a clove or a sprinkle of powder.  The thing that makes this really REALLY good is cast iron. Brown everything in a good seasoned cast iron pan, and stick the whole pan right into a low oven for an hour. It really makes all the difference!

Nice recipe.  I added garlic and onion while grilling the pork chops and seasoned it with Tony Chacheres. The chops were a little dry, and I'm not sure why.  But, they tasted really nice with the gravy.

A big hit with my family. I used some other reviewers suggestions and after browning the chops, I sauteed half a chopped onion, about 1/2 teaspoon minced garlic and a handful of mushrooms in the same pan, then added to the soup/milk mixture.  I actually forgot the water and the "gravy" was perfect. These were very lean and thick chops but not dry at all.   I served them with garlic mashed potatoes and green beans.  I will absolutely make these again.

This dish was great.  Not just in taste but in ease, with the few ingredients needed.  I don't like mushrooms (they taste like dirt to me), but the soup doesn't give it a mushroomy taste.  

I put salt, pepper, garlic powder, and Italian seasoning all over the chops (1" thick). Then I followed the recipe as is.

I cooked this for Valentine's Day along with mashed potatoes and garlic asparagus. We liked it. I cooked up a small chopped onion in the pan before I browned the chops.

After reading the reviews i choose to use 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup, fresh mushrooms, a splash of Kitchen Bouquet for color and flavor, and i baked it at 275 for 3 hours. (Thick Chops) The dish turned out flavorfull and the soup made a great gravy! This recipe is a great starter!! Thank You

I found it to be to bland even after following other users recommendations to spruce it up.I am however guilty of liking heavily spiced food, So if plain Jane is what your looking for you found it.

This makes a really filling and easy meal.  After browning the pork chops, I added a bit of extra buttter to the pan and sauteed some onions and mushrooms, then added the soup and milk.  I seasoned everything with salt, pepper, garlic, and sage.  45 minutes in the oven may have been a bit long as the chops weren't as moist as I expected, but overall everything was tasty!  The sage really complimented the onions, mushrooms and pork well.

This is fantastic! I did follow other reviews and cut back the liquid. I omitted the milk and after I browned the chops I sauteed a large sweet onion (sliced) in the pan and added some frozen green beans. I used seasoned salt on the chops and a little paprika and parsley on top for color. Baked at 400 for about 35-40 min in a covered casserole. I know I modified but it was really, really good!! No leftovers. Thanks!

SORRY TO SAY THIS WAS THE WORST RECIPE I'VE EVER TRIED FROM ALLRECIPES.  PORK CHOPS WERE TOO TOUGH TO EVEN EAT, WASTE OF MONEY AND GOOD MEAT.  I DID HOWEVER, ADD SOME SHERRY (REAL STUFF, NOT SHERRY COOKING WINE) AND THE GRAVY WASN'T BAD.

This was absolutely fantastic. A saver for sure. I made a few changes:
I used boneless porkchops, used 1 tsp of Mrs. Dash garlic & herb seasoning on each chop  (sprinkled on one side and then the other when I turned them over). Because I wanted a one dish dinner I made some minute rice and added it when I put it in the oven. Made an excellent gravy and the chops were very tender.

These were so easy to prepare and were very tender and delicious.  The only thing I would do differently is to leave out the water and only add milk and the soup.  The sauce was a bit too runny with the water added.

This is a great base recipe. I put some scallop cut potatos in the pan, add 8oz sour cream to the soup mix with a little garlic powder. Cover the potatos w/ half of soup mix. Cover and bake 30 minutes while I brown my pork chops. Remove potatos from the oven and lay pork chops on top, recover and bake an additional 30 minutes. My family loves it.

Great recipe!  My husband loved it, and I acted like it took all day to cook.  Ha Ha!  He doesn't like mushrooms so I substituted cream of chicken which made it very delicious.  Thanks for the recipe!

Quick and easy, but a little bland.  I spiced it up with black pepper and garlic.  Even though I added less liquid than called for, next time I would omit liquid completely for a thicker gravy.

My wife tried this recipe out last night and we both believe its a new Pork Chop Recipe worth keeping.  Even my four year old daughter who hates pork chops ate all of it.  We did alter it as suggested before by removing the water and adding an extra can of Cream of Mushroom Soup.  This meal will be a must in our family’s dinner plans for a long time.

UPDATE: I ended up adding Pork Gravy mix, replacing the milk with water. adding sliced onion and a can of mushrooms. In addition, I added garlic powder to the seasoning of the pork.. no longer bland. I just love how moist the pork chops are. 

I didn't have milk so I used 1/2 cup half and half and 1/2 cup water instead... It was still a little bland for me.. but I added garlic salt after it was cooked and that helped, so I might add garlic powder next time.

This was great. Followed directions but instead of adding water i added half a can of ready made gravy with half the can of mushroom soup.  The other halves I cooked stove top and used as gravy for a side of mash potatoes. I made this with 6 pork chops! Definitely will make this often.

Made this last night for the family, and they loved it!  This couldn't be easier - it's definitely staying in my Recipe Box. I taught myself to make pork chops in a similar way earlier in life, and I was surprised to see most of my techniques here.  Good job!

Meh.   Edible, but NOT special.  I followed the recommendations of others and added sautéed mushrooms and garlic to the sauce, and added a layer of sliced potatoes to the bottom of the dish.  The potatoes were VERY good, the pork chops were just ok.  We were satisfied with the meal, but tossed the left-overs.  Too many other delicious ways to prepare pork than to try this one again.

This recipes was delicious!  I used Cambell's Golden Mushroom Soup, omitted the water, used half & half instead of milk and added dried onion flakes.  I also omitted salt and added garlic powder as others had suggested.

Very quick and easy.  Tasty gravy.  Best of all the pork chops were not dry.  I will definitely make this again.

The family loved it even my pickiest eater who is ten. I pretty much followed the recipe with a few revisions from the other reviewers. First I sauteed the onions, garlic and shitake mushrooms in butter. Then I browned the pork chops. I used thick boneless pork chops. Then mix 2/3 cup of milk with the cream of soup you desire, I used cream of mushroom. Add a few dashes of worchestershire sauce. Cover with foil and bake at 350 degrees for 1 hour 45 minutes to 2 hours. Check for tenderness at 1 hour 45 minutes depending on the thickness of the chops. They might be done before the 2 hours. Otherwise the chops could be too dry. Must say the gravy was fantastic. Would easily have this for Thanksgiving. Such a satisfying meal. I served it with thin homemade egg noodles and green beans. But the gravy would be yummy with mashed potatoes or rice too. Enjoy!

My mother made this recipe 40 years ago and I still do, but to do it easy:
spray pan with cooking spray
trim fat and put pork chops in
slice onion on top and pepper
add can of cream of mushroom soup and cover and bake.
two hours on 300 make them fork tender.  yumm  
we like to put our gravy over white rice instead of potato's and serve with green beans

Been making this for many, many years.  I actually use lemon herb seasoning as well as pepper to season the cops before cooking the chops on the skillet.  Then of course add soup, milk, sauted onions & mushrooms and bake the pork chops.  Been a favorite of the entire family forever!

I have been making this recipe for over 40 years & it is always a hit. I always brown a chopped onion tho first. The biggest secret to this recipe is to use Cream of Celery soup. Mushroom soup is too strong but you will get a very tasty more delicate gravy  with the Cr. Of Celery. I alternate chops & then next time chicken. Both turn out beautifully. I serve over noodles.

This was delicious.  I did brown onions and fresh sliced mushrooms in butter prior to adding 2 chops (seasoned with celery salt, onion powder and seasoned salt) for browning.  I used only 1/2 cup milk with a whole can of soup.  The gravy was excellent with rice.  I've made this with cream of celery soup in the past, and it would make a good substitute soup for this recipe.

I have been making this dish for years and always add more spice/flavouring.  Add:  1 chopped onion; dash Worcestershire sauce, Black Pepper; and if you like more of a kick…. add a 1-2 shakes of red pepper flakes or Cayenne.    I do not use mik, and only add 1/4 cup of water because I like a thicker sauce.  Also do not add any salt, if using regular soup.   Last time I made this, I added 8 oz fresh mushrooms & 1/3 cup chopped Sun Dried tomatoes (dried).   The Sun Dried tomatoes added a warm color.  Delish!     PS - Be sure to remove most of the fat from the chops before cooking.   Leftovers are great, heated up.

My mom made the posted version for years. I found it to be dry from the baking she did. So, after years of messing with it this is what I have come up with. I peel potatoes and start them first thing, after I get a small sauce pan with a cup of water and a tbl of Au Jus base. simmer that on stove. Put the chops in a fry pan and seer them. Reduce to simmer, add just enough au jus to cream the soup, Cover and simmer. When the potatoes are done I turn the meat off, add the au jus and it's perfect. Nice juicy chops. The key is cooking time, if you seer them they don't take long to finish cooking. 
Another tip, we buy a pork loin from the grocery and cut our own boneless chops for this dish. sautéed garlic and onions work well too.

So easy to make and so good! Gravy is really tasty! I tend to turn the chops over every 10 minutes and lift it on the sides of each chop, so that it turns more brown and the skin more crisp. Great dinner!

Meh. I followed the recipe, but also added a bit of seasoning and a splash of worcestershire sauce after reading other reviews. The pork chops were not tender at all, and the sauce was thin- not very 'gravy' like.

I gave this recipe 3 stars because everybody ate it, but nobody asked for seconds.  It just came out a little gray and, even though I cooked it for over an hour, the pork wasn't very tender.   On the other hand, the gravy was very tasty over mashed potatos but that was about the only good thing about this recipe.  Probably won't be making it again.

Same recipies as the 'Minnesota Baked Pork Chops' besides the rice.  I like the rice, but I guess the mashed potatoes would be a good side also.  Just a little xtra work.  ;)

Was pleasantly surprised! I followed the recommendation of sautéing with a white onion.  I also added fresh garlic and onion powder with a dash of cayenne pepper.  My pork chops were nice and thick so I baked for over an hour and a half and they were super tender.  Great recipe!

Very easy to make, love this recipe during the week. I use cream of chicken instead of mushroom just due to different tastes. Love to serve with mashed potatoes so I can use the gravy.

Ive made these twice now and everyone likes them. First time they felt the gravy was too thin (and I agree) so second time I cut out the liquids and let the natural pork juice thin it out and that was perfect. But the second time it didnt have enough spice. It needs some "country gravy" seasonings. Next time I make it I will def put some spices in it.

I grew up with Paork Chops in Cream of Mushroom gravy.  We do them on the stove top.  Brown in the pan then add of just cream of mushroom soup and simmer for an hour or more, the longer the more tender they are.  If you are in a hurry you can cook the pork chops longer before you add the soup.

This is a wonderful recipe . It's almost a "no brainer" for my family when we were growing up,   kinda like having a recipe for making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich... duhhhh. You just knew how to do this.  I grew up with this recipe. My mother used this many times but not just for pork chops. It was used with quail, pheasant, cube steaks, chicken breasts etc. It is easily adapted to other cream style soups and adding additional flavors. It''s  a great basic  that can be easily adapted to specific tastes.

i like that this recipe only has a few ingredients but was a bit disappointed in the texture of the pork. i think the time in the oven was a bit too long so the pork wasn't as juicy or as tender as it could have been. i will try this recipe again though.

This was an incredibly easy way to prepare pork chops! Before making this recipe, I had never worked with pork chops before, and my boyfriend brought some fresh chops home from the farm he was working at. So after looking on allrecipes, I chose this one and I am sooo glad I did! Boyfriend hates anything mushroom (including cream of mushroom soup) and I didn't tell him that was the base of the gravy. He loved the dish!

The only change/addition I made was to slice some potatoes in the bottom of the casserole dish.  The pork chops were really good.  I do wish I would have paid more attention to other reviews on how to thicken the gravy up a bit.

I needed an easy recipe for pork chops and decided to give this one a try  mainly because I had all of the ingredients on hand. My family is very fussy and I was a bit nervous about what they would think. To my surprise, they loved this recipe! I made only some minor adjustments. I used cream of chicken soup because we don't like cream of mushroom. After the chops were in the pan ready to go into the oven, I sprinkled each chop with some onion powder and basil for flavor. The result was delicious. I will definately add this to my tried and true favorites!

We really liked these pork chops as a change from our usual fare.  I browned the chops in the butter with some garlic thrown in for more flavor.  I also sprinkled them with onion powder before adding the soup mixture.  Also added one can of mushrooms.  The whole family enjoyed!

These were so delicious and VERY easy!! My chops were boneless and 1 1/4" thick and I had to bake them at 350 for about an hour (15 more minutes that the recipes calls for). They stayed juicy and plump and the gravy was delicious!!  I had some sliced, raw cremini mushrooms leftover from a stirfry and threw them into the gravy mixture before it went into the oven. Those little things soaked up so much delicious flavor! This is now my go-to recipe for pork chops :-)

I'm sure this is wonderful.  I make a similar dish on the stove.  Brown chops on both sides, and pour off grease.  Then add Cream of Mushroom soup and quartered potatoes.  Cover and turn to low and cook for 45 min.  After removing Chops and potatoes, I make a gravy from remaining bits with water and flour.  Delicious.  My husband hated pork chops until I served this.

This was very good!  I sprinkled the chops with garlic powder and chefs blend and sauteed the chops with 2 cloves of crushed garlic.  I also used cream of chicken & herbs, a dash of worceshire sauce and left out the water.  Served over wild rice pilaf and it was just awesome on this cold, rainy night!  Thank you for posting, Jennipoo :)

I loved this recipe! I made it in the crock pot though. I added an extra can of cream of mushroom and a little extra milk and water. Threw in some potatoes, and added some onions. A little extra salt and pepper was required as well as some garlic powder :]. It turned out wonderful. I cooked it for about 6-7 hours.

Thumbs up!  This recipe was a hit with my husband, and he's not easy to please.  Only modification I made was I sauteed onions with fresh garlic and added to soup mix.  I also added one cup of sour cream.  Thank you for sharing.

Good quick recipe and loved by just about anyone. I too add; 'shrooms, onion, garlic, fresh cracked pepper, white wine or beer and... FRESH SAGE! My Mom actually did it from scratch but we don't have the time a 1960s mom did. Try searing off on a gas grill.

Loved it! I browned onion in butter, added the chops and browned them. Then I took them out and did the soup with just 1/3 cup of milk and a teaspoon of Worchestershire sauce. I browned mushrooms in the pan with the meat bits on the bottom and they were soooo good!

I've made this many times just as written and it is delicious. Tonight I decided to change it up a bit. I sauted a large chopped onion and added a small box of sliced mushrooms. I added 1/3 cup of sour cream with the soup and placed on top of chops. I topped the casserole with cornbread stuffing mix made from the box. It was great.

Just the quick but comforting recipe I was looking for. The entire family, even the yougest who doesn't like gravy, said this one is a keeper.  4 Stars because I tweaked it a little. Sauted onions while browning the chops, added 2 T worchestshire sauce to the soup mixture and used all milk.

This is my favorite way to make chops now! After reading the other reviews, I tweaked mine to perfection by sauteing some chopped onion and garlic,  added my seasoned chops dredged in flour before the onion&garlic are fully cooked... remove after browned on both sides, leaving some onion and garlic behind in the pan... then added my mushroom soup, water, & milk along with a dash of pepper, dry bay leaf flakes, onion powder and garlic powder...and followed the rest of the recipe as is!! THANK YOU for the recipe it's delicious!!

I used 4 thin boneless pork loins so the sauce was a lot.  I added a cup of minute rice and it made a great casserole!

It tasted really good. I did add a few spices because other reviews said the gravy was a little bland.

WOW!! The were the best pork chops and gravy I have ever ate! Even my husband and 7 yr. old loved them. Like the others I twinked it up a bit. I added a small thing of sour cream to my soup mixture, also I rubbed the chops with pepper and garlic seasoning before I browned them. Then I sauted half a chopped onion and a small can of sliced mushrooms in the skillet after I browned the chops. Added the onions and mushrooms to the soup mixture then poured it over the chops.  I baked it for about 1 hr. Then topped with some french fried onions. They were fall off the bone good!!!! Served with mashed potatoes, the gravy was wonderful on them by the way, and biscuits.  This is a keeper, you have to try to see!!!!Thanks for the wonderful post.

This is the first time I have ever reviewed a recipe. The reason...I think if your going to review a recipe you should base your review on the way the recipe is written and not what you did or would do to change it. I put alot of my own touches on recipes so I don't feel I have the right to rate it since I didn't actually follow the recipe. I hate reading through everybody's "do's" and "do nots" to try and figure out if the recipe is worth making. They should put a "suggestion box" section so that all of the different variations that people suggest are seprate from the reviews. Just my opinion. So since I did nothing to change this recipe, as I usually do...I will rate this one 5 stars!! It was wonderful. My son loved the gravy. Plus it was easy to make. Will definately make again!! Thank you Jennipoo!!

I usually don't like semi-homemade, but this dish is so easy and good. Simple steps, simple ingredients, simply good. It's a very easy go-to meal at the end of a  long day. And the smell of those pork chops frying up in butter is mmmouthwatering!

Good recipe, but needed more flavor.  I added sauteed mushrooms, but next time I would consider adding garlic or onion as well.

This was great! I'm a bit of a starter cook when it comes to foods outside breakfast, so I like stuff like this.  It really was amazingly simple to make and I love even more how it's a recipe that doesn't need to be referred to every time the dish is made.

Followed recipe as given and it was excellent!  Super easy as it only uses a few ingredients and makes a good gravy for the pork chops which come out nice and juicy!  To make it a little different than the "regular mushroom gravy flavor" I add half a package of Ranch dressing mix to the soup/milk mixture.  YUM!

I followed another reviewers suggestion and put thinly sliced potatoes on the bottom of the dish and the pork chops on top of them. The potatoes turned out good. I liked the pork chops, but didn't love them.

This was delicious - I didn't use any butter or water.  I also didn't bake it--I put the ingredients into a crock pot and let it go to work.  The pork was tender and falling apart and the gravy was perfect to serve with the pork chops and some mashed potatoes.

I dredged the chops in flour, salt & pepper before sauteing in butter, minced onions and garlic.  I added garlic powder, pepper, beef oxo, Worcestershire sauce and some gravy thickener.  They were incredibly moist and fell apart with a fork.  Kids loved them and, even though I'm not fussy on mushrooms, I enjoyed them too.

I made this with 2 fairly thick chops.
I haven't had much luck with scalloped potatoes, until tonite. My husband Was like, "UMMM scalloped potatoes". so they were a hit. I rubbed sage on the chops with the S&P. Used 1 onion and 3/4 soupcan of 1/2&1/2.

Great starter recipe!  Turned out great.  I made a few adjustments to suit our tastes.  I seasoned my chops with garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, lots of pepper (love it) and a little cumin.  Because hubby and I are not mushroom fans went with cream of chicken soup and instead of milk, I used a 2 or 3 healthy dollops of sour cream, along with the Kitchen Bouquet to make the gravy more appealing.   We served it over chedder/broccoli rice... hubby ate the leftovers with a vengance!  Thanks!

First, I love pork chops. Any way of making them is great with me.

I cut up a couple of potatoes and put them under the meat. I also added about 1/2 cut sour cream to the soup and milk. It is a little juicier than I like so next time I would leave out the milk. I added the onion and garlic as well. Great, easy recipe.

I make this recipe with one package of pork gravy according to directions for additional pork flavor, then add the mushroom soup/milk AND add 1 to 2 tsp Kitchen Bouquet Browning Sauce for a rich color. (You can double the pork for the increased gravy and have leftovers!)

i did tweak the recipe just a bit.
i put the pork chops in a pan and poured
cream of chicken and mushroom sauce over
them. without precooking the chops.
just a tudge of garic clove mixed in with
the sauce and spread all around the pan and chops. baked uncovered at 250 till
they fall apart in your mouth. (usually 1 1/2 hours or more, depending on chop thickness.)

This is an okay recipe.  I sauteed the chops in olive oil and garlic, as others suggested, and used less milk and water since I like a thicker gravy. I also seasoned the gravy a bit with onion powder and Season All. It was okay, nothing super special about it.  I might try it again, using a little more spices next time.

Yum! My boyfriend and I loved it! I cooked the pork chops in garlic and olive oil first(as recommended by another member- thanks!)I also added lipton onion soup mix (less than 1 half packet)for added flavor. Finally, I served the chops/gravy over brown rice.  I will definitely make this again (and again).

Tasted great! Recommend adding other ingredients to liven up the cream of mushroom. We added sauted mushrooms and garlic. Thick cut chops were juicy and did not dry out. Not sure if regular cut chops would be as good after the pan and oven.

Really good and easy. I added garlic and onion to the pan with the pork chops and then I added 2 cans of soup, 1 cream of mushroom and 1 roasted garlic/cream of mushroom and a splash of milk then put the whole pan right in the oven. Only 1 dish to clean!! Thanks for the post!!

I followed the advice of other reviewers and sauted onions and garlic in olive oil and added that to the (2) cans of cream of mush soup and omitted the milk and water. I also added a splash of worcestershire sauce and only baked for 40 minutes. Every plate was practically licked clean! I could make this once a week in our house.

This tastes wonderful! I doubled the recipe and the soup.  Then after I sauted the chops..I added a little of the soup mixture to the pan to deglaze and get all the flavor out of the pan. Left the water out..I did add 1 cup lowfat milk to the soups and some garlic powder. The chops come out so tender and moist. The gravy is to die for! Served with green beans and mashed potatoes and yeast rolls. Mmmmm.

I made this for my lodge, so I made 28 servings.  I followed the recipe, used the recipe multiplier function on allrecipes.com, and cooked in a 20qt. roaster.  I had to increase cooking time.  The guys loved it; I will definitely make it again.

After reading other reviews I changed a few things.  First I seasoned the chops with some lawrys seasoning and onion salt.  I then browned them in a little bit of oil with about 4 chopped cloves of garlic (we're garlic lovers  over here.  Then I put the chops, a can of mushroom soup already mixed with 1/3 cup of milk and the pan drippings into a casserol dish and baked for 45 minutes at 350.  It came out wonderful.  Even my picky toddler had seconds.  Thanks!

This was great and EASY, but I wish I would have marinated the pork chops for a little more flavor!  The gravy was AMAZING!!  (I also used the cream of chicken with garlic)

Delicious! I took the advice of some and decided to leave out the water. I also covered it with foil while baking. It was excellent. My husband said they were the best pork chops he had ever eaten. Two thumbs up!

After reading the reviews I followed the advice and made the following changes:  I used 1 can cream of mushroom and 1 can of golden mushroom with 2/3 cups milk and no water.  I also sauteed garlic and onions with the pork chops.  Turned out great.  Will make often.

These were very good with a few modifications.  I pan fried minced garlic cloves and some chopped onion in 1 tbsp olive oil for a bit before adding the chops to brown.  I added the garlic/onion to the soup mix when I poured it over the chops.  This made amazing gravy.  Thanks for this super easy recipe.

So I made a change to this recipe because of the bland reviews.  I added a packet of onion soup mix.  Used the same amount of liquid. Oh and I did a recipe for 8 so if you only did one for 4, you might want to only put in 1/2 the packet of onion soup mix.  Also I didn't cook the pork chops for 5 min on each side before cooking.  I did it enough to turn them white (the sides were still pink).  We could cut them with our forks!  So good :)

Great recipe!!  I used olive oil to brown the pork chops, then used that same pan to sautee some mushrooms I had left over from another dish.  Added the mushrooms to the soup, left out the water all together, and they were absolutely delicious!  Really easy, and very good comfort food - the gravy was great over mashed potatoes!!

I made this last week and my family thought it was so so.  It was a little bland for my taste but overall it isn't a bad recipe.  Comfort food for sure!  I will try making this again but next time I'm going to add a little pork seasoning to the meat first.

These were delicious!  I had a similar recipe at a friend's house, but when I called her for it she wasn't home.  So I came to my trusty "AllRecipes" and found this version.  So glad I did!  My friend had made them for 12 of us, so had a lot of gravy in the pan to cover the stacked chops.  I did the same, and there was enough gravy for the mashed potatoes.  Will definitely be incorporating this recipe into my regular menu plan!

This was great.  After reading reviews, I added a can of garlic mushroom soup, as well as the prescribed mushroom soup, and lots of salt and pepper.  If someone rated this bland, you need salt and pepper to perk it up.  I made it with mashed potatoes, and the extra can of soup made plenty of gravy along with fresh mushrooms I first sauteed in olive oil.  My boyfriend loved it!

Good and easy to prepare. I used the combo cream of chicken and mushroom soup for additional flavor (you really can't taste the chicken) and was liberal with onion powder and salt and pepper.  I also omitted the water and just added 3/4 cup milk. It made a nice gravy to go along with homemade mashed potatoes.  Serve with canned whole cranberry sauce and you have an easy meal for a cold day!

Meat was extremely tender and delicious.  Gravy was a bit runny and bland, but the recipe is for Pork Chops not gravy (so be creative and add some spice).  Excellent with mashed potatoes and biscuits - - just like from back on grandma's farm!

Our family really enjoyed this recipe.  I also made a few changes.  To feed our large family, I double the recipe and used a family size can of mushroom soup, doubled the milk and used alchohol free (Fre) white wine in place of the water.  I also seasoned the chops with Montreal steak seasoning ans seasoning salt before sauteing them.  It was delicious, fast and easy.  Thanks for the recipe.

My Husband loved this.  I thought it was a nice different way to make pork chops.  The meat came out tender and the gravy was great.  I usually do not like cream of mushroom soup as a gravy but it turned out good.  I will definately make again!

I made this tonight for my hubby.  He loved it!!!  It came out soooooooooo tender and did in fact melt in my mouth.  Only thing I did different was used roated garlic cream of mushroom soup, a little garlic salt, little onion powder and used some chopped sauteed onions that i used with the pork chops and added to gravey mixture.  But I sure did enjoy it and so did my hubby he said it was the best pork chops he had in a long time!!!!!

Made it for supper...while the pork chops were okay, the gravy was superb!!!  I didn't add the water, as was suggested earlier.  The week after I made just the gravy with some Johnny's Garlic Powder and put some boiled, cubed chicken in it and heated it up.  We ate it over rice for dinner, than the next day over mashed potatoes for lunch, was EXCELLENT!!!  Will DEFINITELY do the chicken variation again!

Very easy and tasty pork chops.  I did not use the water in the recipe and only baked 6 pork chops instead of 8.  They were great with mashed potatoes, good winter meal.

I made this with very thick pork loin boneless chops.  Even my picky child said it was delicious!  I made it with rice and my only disappointment was the gravy was way too thin.  I will make this again, but may eliminate water.

The pork chops turned out very tender.  Next time I will add some sauteed onions, but will definitely make this again.  When I warmed up the leftovers, the pork remained fork tender and the flavors had mingled nicely.  I think I liked it even better the next day!

This took way longer than 45 minutes to cook, was very late eating waiting on this.  Maybe cover with foil.  I sauteed garlic and mushrooms as well to throw in with the soup mixture.  I used no salt.  I also omitted the water and used 2 cans of soup with the milk.

I felt no need to pre- cook / fry the chops prior to baking. In a deep cast iron skillet I put a layer of thick sliced sweet onions adding red pepper chunks I had left over then sprinkled a teaspoon of dried thyme, the pork chops came next with some black pepper on top, about 10 oz of portobello mushroom were broken in large pieces and put on top of the chops. A can of heart healthy mushroom soup mixed with 8 oz of plain soy milk was poured over all. Because the chops were not fryed first you will need to add 10 or more minutes to the cooking time.

This is an excellent way to make fork tender "poke chops" .   I picked up on several reviewers suggestions to top each chop with a slice of onion before pouring on the gravy, covering the dish and baking at 275 degrees for three hours.  I used  four   slices of meat off of a pork loin roast.  I've never had more tender pork chops.  This could be a good method for Swiss Steak as well.  I've been cooking for forty years and I learned something from this recipe.  Thanks!

The only changed I made were to add the butter in with the mushroom soup and sauted the pork loin total of 5 minutes instead of 5 per side.
Absolutely awesome. The most tender loin I've ever eaten. I plan on adding this to my favorites.

Easy recipe..I made a small adjustment. I dipped the chops in egg and Italian breadcrumbs and then fried. I also added a can of brown gravy because we wanted more sauce to put over gravy. Very simple dish, my husband loved it.

Made this recipe as published. Cooked slow and low per a review suggestion and meat was super fork tender. Added some garlic and onion powder as it may have been bland otherwise. Gravy was great over mashed potatoes. It's a keeper - thanks for sharing!

We loved this. Great flavor and yes, you can cut these with a fork and the gravy was awesome. Served with rice and broccoli but this dish begs for mashed potatoes, and I'll make double next time for leftovers. It didn't need milk or salt but I did use a little water to thin it a bit. Saute onion, garlic, and mushrooms (a lot since we like them) to start and this is a can't miss.

This is truly delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly and the pork chops were tender and the gravy so yummy.  When I make again I will add onions and mushrooms just to kick it up a notch.  But it's wonderful and easy.  Thank you for this recipe.

This was fantastic. The only difference was I used homemade cream of mushroom soup (cream of mushroom soup I recipe in All Recipes) - 2 cups for three chops - ahead of time (was actually frozen). When sautéing the pork chops, seasoned with salt and pepper to taste. Stick it in the oven and let it go till done. The flavors of the cream of mushroom soup I from AllRecipe lent a lot to this recipe. Definitely use homemade cream of mushroom.

This recipe was DELICIOUS! I followed the recipe when browning the pork chops I grilled some onions at the same time and placed them on top of the pork chops when I place them in the pan. I then spread the mushroom soups/milk mixture on top. I had compliments from every single one of my family especially my husband. Thank you all for sharing this delicious recipe!!!

Delicious! I sautéed onions first, put them in the bottom of the casserole. Then put a bunch of season salt and garlic powder on the pork chops. Seared each side then placed them on top of the onions. I then added the 2 tablespoons of water to the pan to catch all that yummy goodness and poured it on the pork chops. I then put the cream of mushroom soup on top and baked. Served with peas and rice pilaf. It was soooo yummy and I can't wait to try it again!

I remember making this recipe a long time ago and decided to try it again just to see if it was as good as I remember. And it was. I just added a little sage and garlic powder for some added flavor.

The gravy was delicious.  The only change I made was to use white wine instead of water. It smelled and looked great -but for some reason, the pork chops tuned out too dry.  I won't be making again.

Having been using this recipe for years since my mother used to make these.  We add a couple of sliced potatoes on top of the pork chops and then pour Golden mushroom soup and milk combo over both.

This is a recipe I have made since I was a young bride. I got it from my mother, who had to feed 13 kids fast. We also seasoned the pork chops with garlic powder. And sliced potatoes on top of the chops before covering with the soup. We put salt, pepper and garlic powder on the potatoes too before adding the soup. Perfect everytime. Also, I didn't add any water or milk to the soup, but I will try this next time. Thanks

I've made a delicious version of this for years! I brown the chops in a dutch oven. In a separate bowl I combine the mushroom soup with a packet of onion soup mix and thin with milk. I cook it slowly for at least an hour on the stove. Chops are so tender and flavorful the longer they cook at low temp. I serve with rice. The pork chops are fork tender and the gravy is excellent over rice!

I've been making this for years and it's always delicious.  I do saute a sliced onion and garlic with the chops and pour it over the chops before I add the soup. I cover it with foil and back for an hour or so at 300. You can remove the foil for the last 20 minutes to let the gravy reduce, if you like.  You can also use boneless, skinless chicken thighs or breast with the same delicious result. I serve mine with herb rice and green beans.

we just had this for dinner, served with steamed white rice and brussel sprouts. it was to die for! we sauteed onion and garlic in the skillet before adding the pork chops and then seasoned with salt, pepper (we love pepper, so we used maybe three full tablespoons haha), chili powder and oregano while it browned. then we added the drippings into the baking pan along with the mushroom soup/milk mixture. we also used 1 full cup of milk and eliminated water for a thicker, creamier gravy. such an easy, fuss-free recipe, i will definitely be making this again.

Used 1 can cream of chicken and 1 can cream of mushroom. Also added the half package of onion soup mix, no water and a 1-/4 can of milk. Sautéed an onion as well. I cooked at 275 for 3 hours. They were amazing, my first time cooking pork without it being tough! 2 teens and hubby approved, next time I will use more milk and less onion soup mix

I baked this for my family the other night and the LOVED it. The only thing I changed was that I sauteed onions and placed them over the pork chops before pouring the sauce. The pork chops came out so tender and the mushroom sauce left over made a great gravy with the mashed potatoes I made.

I LOVE how easy and fast this recipe is. Took almost no prep work and the cleanup was easy. Will def be making this again soon. :)

Killer Good, proclaimed hubby. I was blown away myself. Juicy moist, cut with a fork. I had 6 two inch center cut boneless pork chops. I read reviews then made three chops with 1 mushroom, & 1 chix soups no milk or water. Awesome! Second recipe for 3 chops, instead of soup I used Bertolli Alfredo sauce. I added four sliced potatoes on bottom of chops. Both ways I added fresh mushrooms, onions, and garlic. To die for. They are keepers. Secret? As one lady said, "Pork=low and slow." Baked in roaster in garage (over 105 here today) 300 for 3 hours. All raves. Looking forward to side pork stuffing next time.

This recipe is exactly what I wanted: a simple, foolproof recipe to use up pork chops on a night when I wasn't in the mood to cook.  It may be straight out of the 70s, but there's a reason it's still around.  Thanks!

Thought this was just so-so. The gravy was very thin and the chops a little on the chewy side. Won't make this again.

I was amazed at how simple and delicious this recipe was!! I added another can of cream of mushroom and sauteed garlic, slivered onion, and mushrooms after browning the porkchops, and added that to my soup mixture before pouring it over the chops.  It turned out so great I'll make it the exact same way next time!

Loved it! I read the comments of some reviewers and decided to just add gravy mix for the soup mixture and skip the water as well. Served with ultra creamy mashed potatoes which I also got from here. Definitely a quick and easy way to bake pork chops!

Okay!  I found this recipe this morning -- after I adapted another recipe so that we could have this for dinner last night!  This was exactly what I ended up doing (except added only 1/2 cup of milk) and I thought I would go with 30 minutes baking after 40 overdid them slightly in my oven.  It is easy and oh so yummy!  Great recipe!  Thanks -- This is ours from now on, and ... Next time I won't have to wonder if I am doing it right!

Super simple and tasty! I also added a Tbsp of worchestershire to the sauce.  Gave it another level of flavor.

Delicious and super easy - my two requirements for a family meal - especially for a weeknight.  I followed recipe exactly and ended up with tender and tasty pork chops that didn't take long to make.  Definitely will be put in our menu rotation.

Love this. I decided to add a mix of onions and peppers to mine and only use the milk so the gravy is a little thicker. This is so easy and fast to make and the kids love it. Hard to find all 3 of those things in one recipe. Has totally become apart of my weekly meals.

This is a great recipe, and pretty quick to bring everything together. I marinated two 1/2-inch thick boneless pork chops in soy sauce and fresh-chopped garlic in a ziploc bag for a couple of hours before salt & peppering them and sauteeing in butter. I also sliced up some fresh mushrooms and sauteed them in butter as well, then placed them on top of the pork chops in the baking dish. I didn't have any cream of mushroom, so I used one can of golden mushroom soup with a dash of soy sauce combined with the milk and water. Served with mashed potatoes and fresh sweet corn on the cob. My husband really liked the gravy. I will definitely make this again, and often.

Very tasty, I made my own mushroom cream sauce because I can't get cream of mushroom soup so, I doubled the mushrooms and sauteed some onions and added to the cream sauce, plus sprinkled the chops with Old Bay Seasoning along with the s&p. Will make this again~

This is a great recipe I have been using it for many years. I like to take stuffing and put in between two pork chops to make stuffed pork chops. It's quick and easy. Great for those days you don't feel like being in the kitchen for very long.

This recipe is delicious! I made a few changes though. I browned the pork chops in some butter in my dutch oven. in a skillet i put a package of fresh baby portebello mushrooms already sliced (they are pretty cheap) and some scallions in and sauted them together with some worcestershire sauce and butter. i added cream of chicken soup (instead of mushroom) with the milk and water to the scallions and mushrooms and let it simmer for a few minutes. then i added the gravy to my pork chops in my dutch oven and let it simmer for about 20-30 mins. it was so good i will definitely be making this again!!!

very tender & that's about it...these kinda grossed me out a bit. They were so white & just plain. I doctored them up with more seasoning which made them palatable but I agree with another reviewer as it just tastes like a can of cream of mushroom soup over chops.

i read this recipe and reviews and of course made it my own, but i must say major thanks for the starter kit! for non-shroom fans, i used cream of chx and 3/4 dry pack mccormicks brown gravy mix. i noticed that ppl said gravy was too thin, i followed measurements and found it a bit thick, i add more water next time tho :) again thank you for recipe!

With so few ingredients I wasn't sure how this could be "that good" but it IS that good! I used cream of chicken because it's what I had on hand, but other than that everything the same! Mashed potatoes is great for the extra gravy.

There a number of reasons this recipe deserves 5 stars: requires very little effort to make, most of the ingredients are staple pantry items so it does not require an extra grocery store run, it is reminiscent of "country home cooking," and it is just downright tasty!  I did take the liberty of seasoning my pork chops differently; instead of using just basic salt and pepper, I used seasoned pepper and Mrs. Dash grilling blends for chicken (it can be used for pork as well).  It has been my experience that pork chops are a relatively bland meat, so I seasoned accordingly.

Absolutely delicious.  Sauteed some onions and garlic with the pork chops, then followed the recipe as it was.  8-yo son who does not like ANYTHING ate it up.  Making it tomorrow with my dad but going to try either cream of chicken or cream of broccoli and add mushrooms.  Definitely will be a staple in my house!

Found a recipe called Sour Cream Pork Chops on Allreecipes which is much better than this. I wouldn't make this again.....the gravy is watery and the meat was dry and I followed the recipe exactly.

Sauteed chopped onions and minced garlic in olive oil (instead of butter) then added pork chops to pan. Baked it all together with the sauce. Awesome.

This tasted great with mashed potatoes and corn. The only thing I didn't like was that although done, my pork chops almost seemed mushy. Next time I will use thinner chops so they become a little more done in the pan first and hope to get a better texture. I will keep this recipe though!

Made this for dinner tonight after running out of time for what I originally had planned. Used center cut boneless pork chops. Seasoned with salt, pepper, and garlic powder before browning in butter. I doubled the sauce ingredients thinking I would need it for mashed potatoes. Included some worchestshire sauce and two cans of sliced mushrooms in the sauce. It turned out to be too much sauce and I thought it was thin. Even with the garlic powder and worchestshire sauce the dish was a little bland. But it was easy and convenient after a day on the run! Will definitely make this again, but will have to use something more to flavor it and not so much liquid in the gravy. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Like most of the other cooks commented, I added sauteed onions and mushrooms and reduced the milk a tad.  I also doubled the gravy and added about 1/2 teaspoon of liquid smoke.  The gravy turned out nice and thick and smokey.  I'll make this again.

i tried this recipe and made a few modifications. it was delicious! i seasoned th epork chops with salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. after the pork chops were browned i added some chopped onion, bell pepper, and garlic. i also added a couple drops worchestire sauce to the pork chops, onions, bell peppers, and garlic. i used 1/2 cup milk instead of 3/4 cup. it was really good.

So easy and so good! I followed the recipe to the letter and thought the gravy turned out just a tad thin for my taste...but I used 2% milk, so I might try to use whole milk or no water next time (oh, yeah, there will be a next time).

Made this tonight and followed exact recipe except I used a can of cream of chicken instead of mushroom and I had thin porkchops on hand so after browning I cooked in the oven for 35 minutes instead of 45.  My kids loved it and ate every bite.  My only complaint was when my 2 year old decided to throw a fork at my head tonight!  But I dont think it had anything to do with the recipe! :)

There was nothing really special about this recipe. Very basic and a little bland..... I probably won't make this again.

A hit with the family! Both hubby and 15 yr old son loved. Took advice of previous reviewers and used a lot of seasoning while saute (Old Bay, garlic powder, salt pepper). Didn't have Cream of Mushroom on hand so used Cream of Potato instead and worked well with both milk and water. Used boneless pork chops, cut the oven to 300 and cooked about 50 minutes. Tender and moist! Served over brown rice with a side of Candied Carrots and this will become a family favorite!

This was really good but I changed a few things.  First I sliced a large onion and sautéed it in the pan with the pork, when the pork was ready to come out I left the onions in the pan and then deglazed the pan with some white wine then put the onions on top of the pork.  I changed the sauce too, instead of milk and water, I used 1/2 cup milk and 1/2 cup white wine, I think next time I will try a "Golden Mushroom Soup" but it was good with the regular cream of mushroom.  I made no-yolk noodles as a side, coated them with butter and bread crumbs, had plenty of gravy to put over the noodles.  Tasted fantastic!

New family favorite. I did make a few changes as the other reviewers suggested. I sauted garlic and onions in with the pork chops. I did use the amount of water suggested and it did not seem to runny.

I hate cooking pork because I always let it dry out, but this recipe keeps everything moist. I made it exactly to recipe the first time, and the gravy was a little bland. The second time around, I added a little parsley, onion powder, and garlic powder to the gravy. I also omitted the water and added only a splash of the milk, which it doesn't really need. It thins out in the oven. Much better!

Well, this was definitely easy!  I had 2 very thick chops, so I cut them in half so they would cook in the time alloted.  I did as some suggested and sprinkled the chops with Old Bay seasoning and garlic powder (in lieu of actual garlic).  After browning, I added a can of drained mushrooms to the pan and sauted.  I used cream of celery, since I had no cream of mushroom.  Added the mushrooms to it 1/2c each of milk & water.  The chops were tender and the gravy was nice.  Not a spectacular meal, but certainly good enough to make again.  Thanks Jennipoo for another way to make pork chops!

Like everyone else, I modified this recipe. My chops were boneless center loins about 1 1/4". I mixed a bowl of flour and Willinham's rub that I lightly dipped each chop into and browned on each side in a pan of olive oil.  I put Pam in my 9x13 Pampered Chef baking stone dish.  I laid each chop on its side so that I could fit a bunch in the dish. I then sliced 2 lbs of fresh mushrooms and sweet green onions fresh from the garden and minced 5 cloves of garlic. I put all these sliced veggies in the same pan that I sauted the pork chops in with about 1 TBSP of low fat butter, 2 TBSP of Worcestershire Sauce and about 1/4 can of chicken broth.  I then cooked the mixture until it was tender (the broth gets all the yummy scrapings from the bottom of the pan). I then added 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup and the rest of the can of chicken broth once the veggies were tender and mixed it all up in the pan and let it cook for about a minute.  I then put all this over the pork chops and evenly distributed it.  Put in the oven at 275 covered for about 2 hours (maybe less depending upon the thickness of the pork chops).  Everyone salivated over them and they were so tender you didn't need a knife.  Yum!

Pretty good. I thought it might need a little kick of flavor so I added crushed rosmary to the chops and the "gravy" which turned out good.

I'm giving these four stars because even though they were good, I think they would have been pretty plain as the recipe is published here. Like other reviewers, I seasoned the pork chops on both sides with a little salt, plenty of fresh ground black pepper, paprika, and garlic powder. I sliced onions and mushrooms and sauteed them first in the butter and added a tablespoon of olive oil. I placed the veges in the 9 x 13 dish and placed the chops on top. I mixed the cream of mushroom soup with about 8 ounces of milk and poured that over the dish. Baked at 350 for about 45 minutes, and served it over mashed potatoes. Yum!

These were very good. Classic cream of mushroom chops. I used PAM instead of butter to lighten it up, used 98% fat free cream of mushroom soup, and sauteed 1 onion and 1 t. of garlic and added that to the soup. I also added 1 T worchester to the soup, and only added 2/3 cup skim milk (no water). Adding a lot of fresh pepper to the chops before frying them added a lot of flavor. Baked covered for sure. Mine were only 1 in so they only needed 30 min in the oven. Great with mashed potatoes and oven roasted corn on the cob!

These pork chops come out so moist and the flavor is awesome. We bake 20 minutes covered then 20 minutes uncovered, and they come perfect. Thanks for the great recipe.

Good home cooking, Took the advice to saute onions and canned mushrooms and tossed on top of the sauce. Bakes up nice in the alotted time.

Easy to make and tastes oh so good! I seasoned the pork chops really well before putting them in the baking dish and pouring the gravy over them, and when they were done, I topped them with chopped green onions.

I had reviewd this recipe previously and gave it a bad review....and i just now noticed the bad review was for a different recipe (think it was baked pork chops 1)....not this one.  I've never tried this one....but plan to soon because it sounds good.  Sorry about the mix up.

This recipe was a great starting point. I made a few changes. First off, I didn't bother browning the chops. I mixed the can of soup with a finely chopped head of fresh garlic and 1/2 of a Walla Walla onion, diced.  Poured that over the chops and baked uncovered on 350 for about 30 minutes. Then I raised the temp to 375 and baked uncovered for another 20 minutes.  They were fork tender, the gravy was the perfect consistency. I served with mashed potatoes and baby peas and corn in a butter sauce. Definately a new addition to the usual rotation!

I basically followed the recipe. Omitted the water. 2 cans of soup for 4 chops. I sauteed the chops in the butter and added worchestershire, minced garlic and seasoned the chops. I also added chopped onion to the pan after pouring the soup over the chops. Baked at 350 for the 45 minutes. Chops were tender and moist. Hubby (who claims to hate cream of mushroom soup) raved!!! Will definately make again. I had made it once before but thought the taste was a bit bland. Adding the worchester , onion and seasoning hit the mark!

I've been making this for years.  However for a one dish meal, I put sliced onions on the pork chops and sliced potatoes on the onions then pour the soup mixture over all.  I cover with foil for most of the cooking time, then remove it the last 10 minutes.  It's scalloped potatoes, pork chops with gravy using only one dish.  My husbands favorite meal.

This dish was simple and delicious.  I used bone in pork chops-6 and baked for 45 minutes.  I added half tsp of rosemary, thyme and oregeno for more taste.  My family loved it but i will try using a less fatty meat next time, like a pork roast, or pork loins.

My husband and I loved it.  Even our picky 7 year old said it was "really good" - high praise indeed.  My chops were fairly thin so I shortened the baking time to 20 minutes.  I also added sour cream, and only a splash of milk.  I served it with veggies and steamed red potatoes.  The gravy on the potatoes was great.  I'll make this again soon.

These were phenomenal, with a few of the tweaks suggested by others. I seasoned the baking sauce additionally with onion powder, and added in one can of Campbell's Golden Mushroom condensed soup in addition to the Cream of Mushroom soup (for 6 chops). I cooked them low and slow -- after about three hours, the chops had that great color and outer carmelization from the pre-frying, but were falling off the bone tender. Definitely the best way to cook pork chops after grilling seasons ends! Tahnks for the recipe!

This recipe was great! Since I didn't want to go to the supermarket and buy cream of mushroom soup, I made a generic gravy using the recipe from the back of the cornstarch box. I also cubed a potato and placed them around the chops. It came out fantastic. Thank you!

very yummy!! The gravy tasted delicious and the pork chops were tender and tasty. I did add one pack of pork gravy and a cup of water to the soup mix and used cream on chicken soup, my family doesn't care for mushrooms.  I also seasoned with season all and pepper instead of salt and pepper.  I also added some onion sliced in rings on top of the pork chops before baking.  My girls gobbled them up:)  Will be keeping this recipe for sure!  Thanks

Yummy!  I added sliced potatoes, carrots and I would have added celery if I had any!  I was a little short on the gravy part because of the extra ingredients so I added a little bit of sour cream, milk, about a table spoon of mayo, a little bit of Swanson’s Garlic Chicken Broth, and some fresh parsley.  All of this, simply because that was what was in my fridge at the time.  I followed one of the reviewers suggestions and added some Old Bay seasoning to the pork chops.  It came out great.  You have to add a little more cooking time if you are going to add potatoes.  Maybe another 15 minutes or so but you will just have to test that out yourself.

Good, not wow, but a yummy, easy dish. Left out water and just used milk for creamier gravy.  Next time, will use a little less milk for thicker gravy.

It was a good recipe but I made some changes.   I dredged the chops in egg and then rolled it in a combination of seasoned bread crumbs and corn flake crumbs for breading.   I omitted the water totally so the gravy would be thicker.

I am disappointed because I followed the recipe exactly to the T, but the pork chops weren't done.  After baking for 45 minutes, they were still pink.  I guess I will need to bake them for at least an hour if I use the recipe again.

These were great. I used olive oil instead of butter and I sauted some minced garlic after I did the pork chops and added that in with the soup and milk.  And I also didn't use any water, just increased the milk to 1 cup.  The children even loved it and went back up for more.  I served it over egg noodles.  Definitely a keeper!

We really enjoyed this recipe. We just tweaked it a bit by adding fresh mushrooms and onions to it and used the left over sauce to pour over the mashed potatoes. It was a hit!

I added red onion and minced garlic when frying pork chops. The family loved this recipe. The gravy was a nice touch as the chops were already flavorful before adding cream of mushroom. I used stuffing, rice and corn as side items to complete.

Like previous reviewers, I thought it was a little bland. I followed the directions. Perhaps the chops should marinate in the cream of mushroom soup prior to baking.  (As long as the soup comes to a boil, you can still use it as a gravy.)

It was a very easy recipe, but it just tasted like porkchops baked in cream of mushroom soup.  The gravy was nicely seasoned thanks to the advice of other recipe fanatics, but I guess I expected more.

I made some changes as well. I added season salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder to the pork chops before I browned them. I left out the water and cooked the milk and soup in a sauce pan until blended. I also only baked it for 35 min.  My family enjoyed it and I will cook it again.

This is a very easy and excellent recipe! I've made a few minor changes: I use two cans of cream of mushroom w/ roasted garlic soup - my hubby likes to have some gravy left to pour over the rice
I skipped the water and only put in 2/3 cup skim milk
The roasted garlic flavor gave it a very nice addition. I followed the rest of the instructions/ingredients exactly. The pork chops came out tender and juicy.

Really Excellent and Easy Way to make some GREAT Pork Chops!  I added some onions and greenbeans as suggested from other reviewers and the chops could not have turned out more flavorful and tender!  Great one pot meal!!

This came out amazing after I used some of the recommended changes.  I used a 1/2 cup of low fat sour cream, skim milk and omitted the water, but used 2 cans of the 98% fat free soup.  I also sauteed onions and garlic in a little olive oil to throw in there also.  I love to alter recipes to make them low fat, and this was wonderful.

I didn't use mushroom soup because I don't like the gray color but this recipe is 5 star the way I made it. I used a can of cream of chicken soup, a can of cream of celery soup, about 3/4 cup milk. Other than these changes, I followed the recipe as it was. I served with rice, green peas, and biscuits. Great!!!

I followed the recipe exactly, but with 3 larger chops instead of 4, and with the addition of onions (which was definitely a good idea) while cooking the pork chops on the stove.  The gravy was delicious.  We had a hard time deciding what to serve the chops with though, and ended up having rice.  We will probably make this again. :)

My modifications are very tasty.

Like always, use tenderizor powder and a tendorizer fork for the chops.  

I add extra butter and some minced garlic to the pork chops when sauteing.  Leave some pink in the chops for tenderness.  They'll brown in the oven.  After the chops are done and placed into the 9x13" pan, dribble the remaining butter & garlic over the chops in the pan.

I also add two cans of sliced mushrooms and one can of sliced potatoes to the soup mixture.

When there are 10 minutes left to bake, top with cheddar cheese.

This was an excellent and easy recipe. I seasoned with Lawrys and garlic powder instead of the normal salt & pepper. I also added a dash of Soy Sauce with the soup, milk & water. We absolutely loved it!

This dish was, even with some browned onions added, very bland. The meat was tender and the preparation easy - this is what earned the stars. Other than that very forgetable. Unfortunately I have no ideas how to get more taste in it without changing the recipe completly.

Very good recipe, wish the gravy was thicker, used two cans of cream of potatoes instead.  Seasoned pork with garlic salt, pepper, and used olive oil instead of butter.  Will definately make again!

The pork was good and tender, but the gravy was a little runny and bland for me (and I cut out the water completely). I would make this again with some extra seasonings.

Simple dish to make, so that was a plus for me. The chops turned out a bit dry for me so next time I'll probably skip browning them first and just cook it all together. Added a little thyme for flavor but overall a delicious dish.

Still a little bland.  I subbed cream of celery for mushroom.  Added pepper, onion power, minced garlic, and oregano on chops before saute and in soup mixture.  Skipped water, still a little runny.  I liked it and will do again, but definitely suit to your taste with spices.

We found this to be very tasty. The chops were tender enough to cut with a fork. We also added some mushrooms to the recipe(for you mushroom lovers like us).

I have to say that I am not a big fan of mushrooms. But figured I would try something new to please my husband that loves mushrooms. I did enjoy this, I did add saute mushrooms at end and only put them on his plate. But this I will make again. Thanks again ...

This recipe is excellent. I used centercut pork loin because the store didn't have any pork chops and it turned out good. The wife and kids loved it. We had it with mashed potatoes and biscuits.

Delicious! I loved this, and so did my boyfriend and his picky 7-year-old daughter who hates mushrooms. I added chopped onion and inserted garlic chips in the center of the chops and it turned out perfect. Thanks!

I was very nervous to try this but it sounded so good.  My boyfriend does not like mushrooms, so I buried the can in the trash and tried it anyways and he loved it.  It is a ver good, quick, and easy meal to male; and is real good with rice and peas.

These pork chops and gravy are so flavorful!  I doubled the gravy so I would have enough for our mashed potatoes, but I found it made way more than we needed.  I did not use the water, and the gravy was still not very thick.  It did not matter though, the flavor is exactly right!  I added some minced onions, as well as garlic and paprika.  I will definitely make it again.

Just like Mom used to make! We sprinkled boneless chops with Garlic-Herb Seasoning as well as salt & pepper. Everyone went back for seconds! Miss Picky Toddler even ate it! This goes in my Family Favorites folder.

The meat was very tender, but lacked the flavour. Next time I will marinate it in some garlic ahead of time. Also i will add less milk/water as the sauce was way too runny.
I think adding some freshly sliced mushrooms would add to it too!

This is an excellent recipe.  I browned the chops using garlic and onion powder.  I also used all milk instead of water.  They turned out delicous and very tender.  My whole family loved them.  I served them over stuffing.  I will make this again.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Next time I will reduce cooking time since my chops were a little tough, and I will also skip adding water to mixture because the sauce was a little too runny for our tastes.

The pork chops were good, very tender, but I thought that the "gravy" was going to be thicker.  Mine was very runny and I made it exactly as the recipe states.  Any tips?

My husband was crazy about this dish. I did add some garlic to the soup mixture, and I will try adding differen't things to it as it is an easy dish to fix the way you like it. It was fast and
easy and the pork chops were tender. adding it to
my receipe box right now.

Very good and easy, added more seasonings to the pork chops while browning, garlic, salt and pepper.  Put sliced mushrooms on the top right before cooking, turned out great.  I also served with mashed potatoes and creamed peas.

This is always a favorite..with room for variation. I mixed crm of mushroom and golden mushroom to boot. I served the chops and gravy over chicken stock boiled potatoes, that were cooked twice with garlic and green onion. My husband is sure glad he married me!! Thanks!

Great, easy recipe.  I was tired of the same old pork chops, they were very moist.  I used the extra gravy & poured it over rice.  My husband loved it.  A little too salty but that's because I used Garlic Salt by mistake.  I meant to use Garlic Power...I'll remember next time!  I used Cream of Chicken instead of Cream of Mushroom Soup since I didn't have any Mushroom Soup.  It's in my recipe box.  Thanks!

These were absolutely delicious and SO easy to make. I followed the other reviewers' advice and omitted the water, adding instead an extra can of soup and just a smidge of milk. These were YUMMY and I will definitely make them again! Up with gravy!

I scaled up the recipe to do 6 pork chops, and mixed one can each of Cream of Mushroom soup, and Cream of Chicken soup together with about one half can of milk (no water); I used garlic powder, seasoned salt, and unseasoned meat tenderizer on the chops, then sauteed them according to the recipe.  They were very tender and juicy, and the gravy wasn't too thin.
Dinner was a huge success, with black-eyed peas and mashed potatoes to go with the pork chops.

I didn't add the water just the milk and the mushroom soup. The sauce was very good. I poured some on my rice on my plate. But I think i cooked this too long. My daughter had a hard time chewing the pork. But i think i will try again just not cook it as long.

This is a very basic recipe, but very good.  I added mushrooms and served it with mashed potatos.  A great "comfort" meal.

This wasn't bad.... it was really easy...  I'm a newly wed, trying to find something easy to cook for busy schedules with work.... and I'm a new cook.  So considering all this, and we both went back for seconds, it was good.  The gravy was a little thin, but everything was still good.  Kinda like what my mom use to make.

This is a great recipe - quick and easy and very TASTY!  I really hate cooking but love to eat =) and this was simple and tasted really great.  I have made this probably about 5 times in the last 2 months.  I now just follow the directions but throw it in the microwave instead of the oven.  I place about 3 boneless pork chops in a casserole dish and pour the soup and onions over the meat and cook on high for about 15-20 minutes.  It's great!

Followed some of the tips in the reviews and was a big hit!  Doubled the gravy and fresh mushrooms so there was plenty for the mashed potatoes.

I seasoned chops with garlic pwdr and pepper as I sauted them.  Then added 1 onion and fresh mushrooms.  
Mixed soup with milk only and baked covered with foil slow at 325 to 350 for 2 hours.  chops were very tender.  It makes gravy so nice to have potatoes or wild rice.
will make again.

This turned out great!!  I changed mine up though.  I added minced garlic, onion powder, garlic powder, parsley, and for a little kick, some cayenne pepper to the soup before I poured it onto the pork chops.  I also added sliced onion on top of the pork chops while I seared them in the pan. Once they were seated, then I poured the soup mixture on top and cooked them for 45 minutes.  Super tender and tasted great!!  Will make this again!!

So I followed MADISONLIBERTYS alterations. the only thing I did different was I got I package of baby bellas that I rough chopped. Sauteed the onions,mushrooms and garlic and pushed them to the edges of the pan. Seared off the chops in the middle and then deglazed with a bit of white wine.( I did the chops in small batches)  After deglazing I added the cream of mushroom mix to the pan to incorporate and poured over the chops. Definitely a keeper.

I made this recipe as is with double the sauce and they ALL loved it!  Yesterday we ate it with white rice and peas.  Even my anti-pork  daughter liked it.  My SIL asked particularly asked for the pork to be cooked in cream of mushroom soup, the way his mom did.  Gonna have to remember this!

My favorite way to eat pork chops. Strangely enough I hate mushrooms but you can’t even taste them (at least I can’t) in this. Don’t change a thing.

I have made this twice. First time I baked it in the oven. I seared the pork chops that I seasoned with a little Tony's seasoning. Then I baked them in the mushroom gravy mixture. I didn't use as much milk. The pork chops came out so tender and my family loved them. The 2nd time I cooked them on top of my stove because my oven is currently not working. I did the same way except I simmered on low for about 2 hours to make sure they came out tender again. Definitely a favorite in my household. So easy too!

I did follow the recipe, but since no one likes mushrooms except myself, I used Cream of Chicken soup. The sauce was awesome but the pork chops were on the tough side. I expected them to be much more tender. I did cover the dish with foil while baking. Next time I will either use thinner pork chops or bake on low for 2-3 hours.

I did not salt the pork chop as the cream of mushroom soup is already salty. I added mushrooms and onions just because we love them. I will definitely make it again.

I doubled the recipe for my family.  I did as another reviewer suggested and didn't add the water.  It turned out great and my kids loved it.  The only thing I realized was I needed to add more salt and the pork was a little on the dry side but then you have the gravy to help with that.

Family loved it. I made 2 changes. A brown gravy packet and about 3/4 a cup of extra water.  Makes just enough gravy for the potatoes too. In a pinch. You can use cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom and it taste just as food.

I used fresh portabella mushrooms in the gravy. Also my chops were thick cut so I let them sauce in the skillet for a bit longer.

I always try to make recipes as they are written but I only had cream of chicken soup so I used that instead and since I was crunched for time, I just dumped the milk and soup mixture into the pan instead of baking it.  It turned out excellent and I'm sure it would be just as delicious with the cream of mushroom soup and baked.

I loved this new type of recipe for pork chops (to me). The gravy is so good and very simple to make.  When I make it again, I will leave out the water especially because I make my own cream soup from a healthy recipe adaptation.  The milk is fine to add though and really does add to the tastiness of the gravy. The pork chops are very moist and don’t get so overdone with this recipe.

These are really good--though not as tasty as a similar recipe that entails breading the pork chops.  Still-- for such an easy recipe, this is a keeper.

This is a delicious recipe.  I suggest mixing the soup and milk in the pan you browned the chops in.  Adding all that extra flavor really makes for a fantastic gravy!!

Mmmm.  So simple, but the best pork chops I ever made.  Used cream of celery instead of cream of mushroom (personal preference) and baked for 1 hour rather than 45 minutes, as my chops were pretty thick.  Tender and very tasty.

I do not see how no one is saying that the pork chops are over cooked.  I should have went with my gut that the time was too long.  And I had bone in chops.  I cannot imagine how bad they would have been otherwise.

Followed the simple recipe and added sautéed onions and garlic as well. My wife said it tasted fine but I found it to be a on the bland side. It’s a good recipe if you’re feeling lazy, just pop it in the oven. But if you’re really looking for a meal with layers of flavor, do yourself a favor and skip this dull uninspired recipe.

I doubled the recipe but did not add water. I should have to get a more gravy-like consistency. I also added a dash of Worcestershire, but then was told it was a little salty.  It was still pretty good, though, because there was only one chop leftover. Served with mashed potatoes and fresh broccoli.

Thank you Jenni! The first time I made this, I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out fabulous! The chops were tender and moist and the gravy was very good. The 2nd time I made this, I added slices of onion that I sautéed with the chops. This is a huge hit with my family! Thank you for a great recipe!

Taste: pretty good.
Changes: cream of celery, my husband does not like mushrooms
Problems:  While the taste was fine, the chops came out though. Not sure why, I was surprised.
Do again:  I will try it again with thinner chops, less cooking time, and see if the chops come out tender.

This is a very simple recipe to make and tastes just great. The pork chops retain their moisture, while baking in the mushroom soup mixture.
I served this with 'Fried Cabbage with Bacon, Onion and Garlic'; a recipe also available on allrecipes.com.
I will definitely make this again.

I switched the 3/4 c milk for 3/4 c of evaporated milk (since I forgot to get milk at the store) and I cannot believe how good this is! It's probably the best pork recipe I've ever tried! Just waiting for confirmation from my son and husband if I should put this in the rotation...I can't see why not

This is my BF/s ''favorite'' way for me to make Pork Chops... Serve with Mashed Potatoes/ Baked Potato along with veggies & a salad... YUMMY.!!  It doesn't take much time to brown the pork chops, then into the oven for about an hour for our THICK CHOPS!!

Only thing I did other than recipe was continue to cook it in the pan I browned the chops in on the stove top and not the oven.... covered with a lid and they were so tender and awesome and only 1 pan to clean up!  :)

Great family favorite! I sautéed onions in butter and added them with a little extra seasoning to the soup mixture before pouring it over the chops-YUM!

Made these with a couple changes: added a packet of pork gravy mix to the soup, and mixed with 1 cup of water, also added a slice of onion to the top of the chops, both modifications per other reviews. Next time, I'll use thinner chops. I had to bake them longer than I wanted, and they were not as "melt in the mouth" as I wanted them to be. The gravy was awesome! Served with roasted potatoes and steamed asparagus. Thanks!

This recipe was delicious.  I have 2 teen boys who usually invite friends over for dinner so I doubled the chops. Added the Old Bay seasoning and sautéed some onions and garlic.  The only thing I shouldn't have done was add salt.  This made it too salty. But stirring in some cut up baked potatoes alleviated that.  I will definitely be making this recipe again.

We followed the directions exactly. The sauce was really watery and did not add much flavor to the pork. The pork was nice and tender. I will probably try it again with NO water. Also, the soup was low sodium, so it could use a little more salt.

Excellent recipe.  The only thing I changed was instead of butter I used vegetable oil and rubbed each chop and I did not use the milk instead I used a package of pork gravy and mixed with my soup and water.

After reading previous reviews I decided to brown some onions and garlic in the skillet first and coat my meat with Cajun seasoning. It was so delicious. One of my favorite recipes now.

I thought this sounded good and it was!  I browned the chops (only 2) then 1/2 onion and 4 oz mushrooms, deglazed with a splash of apple cider vinegar, 1/2 can of condensed cream of mushroom soup, the poured mixture over chops in a 9 X 9 pan.  45 minutes and done!  very good.

I mostly followed the recipe, except I omitted the water and finished cooking the chops in my crockpot on high for about 4 hours. I served it with buttered rice, and the gravy was perfect to pour over the rice. Will definitely make this one regularly!

Hey, this is a great of baking pork chops before !

Really you can't go with butter.

I wanted to make the chops more oriental. When the chops were about ready, I added some grated ginger to it. With the butter, it  tasted great.  In Chinese cooking, we like  to add ginger to steaming fish and it also worked great with this recipe.
Will definitely try it again.

This was so easy and absolutely delicious!  I used 7 thinner bone-in chops, seasoned with Old Bay, pepper, onion and garlic powder  and fried them about 3 minutes per side.  I doubled the soup and the milk and added 1/4 cup water.  I used 1 can of  Golden Cream of Mushroom  and 1 can of Roasted Garlic Cream of Mushroom.  It was done in the listed time and there was plenty of gravy for the mashed potatoes.  My husband, who is a very picky eater, couldn't stop raving about this dish.  Thanks so much for this great recipe.

I usually add sliced mushrooms  to this and thicken the gravy. I come back to this one again and again.

This is 2nd time made and it's really great.  Comes out perfect each time.  My almost 96 yr old mother loves it.  She has hard time swallowing meat but it is so tender she really does eat this.  Great recipe.  I was getting desperate to find any meat recipe she would eat.  Thank You!!

Made it as the recipe reads but the only thing I changed was I added a small amount of fresh mushrooms that I loosely tore apart into smaller pieces and added to the gravy mixture. Everyone loved it and my younger grandkids had second helpings which is amazing as they usually never finish the food their given.

I've made a version of this for years.  My version is more work intense and more fattening, so it might not appeal to those looking for tasty but quick, which the recipe posted here is.   I tried this version and it is delicious.  But  if you want a little change you might try this.  Slice white onion into onion rings.  Mix flour, ground ginger, salt, pepper and garlic granules together per your own taste.  Place 10 oz milk in bowl and dip onion rings in milk then flour.  Cook onion in butter in frying pan until slightly browned.  Do the same with the pork chops.  Place pork chops and half of onion rings in baking dish.  Sauté fresh sliced mushrooms lightly and add to onions and chops.  Add cream of mushroom soup, the milk reserved from coating onions/chops, fresh grated ginger and fresh garlic chopped.  Bake.  Add second half of onion rings on top of chops during last 15 minutes of baking.

Nothing new about this recipe, it's been around for years from Campbell's® soup. This is a very good recipe. I've done these in the oven and also in a frying pan, stove top. After browning stir in the rest of the ingredients and simmer covered for about 45 minutes to an hour, depending on the thickness of the chops. I serve it with whipped potatoes or sometimes rice, and a vegetable.

This was a great recipe, I used a pepper medley spice (Clubhouse brand) when browning them and I used butter as well.  When I put it all in the roasting pan, I added celery, onion, and carrots that I sliced in little thinner discs, I also used 2 cans of mushroom soup and added more pepper medley and one can milk so it wouldn't thin out too much.  It turned out great!  Loved the recipe!  I will make again for sure!

I would make this again, it was simple and delicious! However, we ended up with ALOT of gravy from the recipe, so next time, I may make it with rice. I also used cream of golden mushroom soup instead of cream of mushroom, and boneless pork loin. Mmmmmmm!

Enjoyed it. browned mushrooms, garlic, and sliced potatoes in a skillet and then placed that over the pork chops after being covered by the mixture. I then sealed it with aluminum foil to trap moisture in . Turned out great!

A very easy recipe.  I changed it up by using 2 cups milk, (I needed 8 servings ), instead of using water.  I added sage to the gravy as well as caramelized onions. Seasoned chops with s/p and garlic powder. Served with rice and broccoli. 
Family loved it, even my 5 and 8 year old grandsons!

Family loved it. I used cream of chicken like another reviewer suggested. Not a favorite of mine as I don't too much care for cream of chicken but the chops were cooked perfectly. I took them out of the oven 10 minutes early but I gave them a really good golden brown sear on the skillet top before I put them in the oven.

My husband and I really like this one. The only changes I make are to the gravy. I use two cans of Cream of Mushroom soup, one packet of onion soup mix, and 3/4 cup of milk (no water). I make this recipe regularly.

I substituted cream of celery soup in place of the cream of mushroom and i usually double the recipe. My husband usually finds something to complain about with every meal i make (hes a cook occupationally), but all he said about this was "mmm! II'm impressed, they are so tender the bone is falling apart, how did you do this?" Even the kids love it, including my picky 6 yr old son, and my 14 month old daughter is able to eat them even with her limited number of teeth! A real crowd pleaser!

I made these last night. It was easy to prepare. We thought they were  good, but a little bland for us.  Will definitely be making again, but I think I'll incorporate a few of the suggestions from other reviewers for additional flavoring.

I did make one modification to the recipe in that  I only used 1/2 of the milk in the soup mixture.  

Also, the listed cooking time  resulted in slightly over-cooked chops; next time I'll use my meat thermometer to check for internal temp of 140/145 degrees.

Also, next time I make them I'm increasing the soup from 1 can to 2, simply because the gravy is so good, particularly with mashed potatoes.

This is a great basic starter recipe that lets everyone get creative. I read many of the reviews and modified a bit. I had bought 4 super thick pork chops from the butcher and since its winter, couldn't really grill them.  I browned the chops in a bit of butter and garlic powder, then removed the chops and sauteed a medium yellow onion, about two cups of fresh sliced mushrooms and three fresh cloves of minced garlic.  (Wow the smell in my house!) I used two cans of cream of mushroom soup and mixed a can of chicken broth with it. Stirred it all together well then poured it over the chops in the 9x13 pan, and added the sauteed mixture. Since the chops were so thick, I covered with foil and baked for 35 minutes, the pulled the foil off and baked another 20 until the center of the chops were cooked through. The most delicious gravy ever! Served it over mashed potatoes, served with green beans, and my boys demanded this be a repeat performance. Thanks so much!

NOT dry!  Easy, moist and very tasty.  I added some sauteed mushroom slices to give the chops a little something extra.  My hubby really loved these chops.  I will certainly make pork chops again like this.

made some changes. I used Unsweetened  original Almond milk. Used two Butterfly Pork Chops and followed directions on cooking  them. Sliced up half an onion. removed the chops and placed the onions in skillet to caramelize and get the browning bits loose then poured the soup mix in and stirred the mixture and added the chops brought up to boil. Once it came up to boil placed all in baking dish and baked for 45 minutes.  This is my favorite.

I read the reviews and then decided to tweak it a bit. I had every intention of making it with cream of mushroom soup however, I was out. So I mixed 2 cans of cream of chicken soup, a little milk, Worcestershire sauce, a package of pork gravy mix and lots of pepper and salt to taste. I seared the pork chips in butter and olive oil inn nothing sides and seasoned with salt and pepper, then rough chopped a couple onions and garlic-sautéed and added that to the gravy. Put the chops in a 13x9 pan and poured gravy all over and baked on low heat for about 30 min. Served it with rice pilaf and sautéed broccoli. Was a big hit and probably could be modified a bit for the crockpot.

Made this for my bf using some modifications with reading the comments - only thing I changed was adding double the can of mushroom soup + no water. It turned out so great (considering I'm a novice at cooking) and my bf absolutely LOVED it. He ate all 3 pork chops + the mash potatoes - the sauce is so tasty :)

This was super easy to make and quite delicious! I seasoned the chops with garlic salt (instead of salt & pepper) and added sliced onions and bell pepper to the butter, while I sauteed in pan.  Then followed the recipe as stated, pouring the milk, water, & mushroom soup mixture over the chops in a baking dish. This was very good! The gravy is amazing, even used some   of it over steamed broccoli. Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe! I tweaked it just a bit. I used Black Pepper, Garlic Salt, and Season Salt to taste...about equal portions. I also wanted gravy for the mashed potatoes so I added another can of CoM soup and 1/2 cup of milk. Turned out very easy and delicious!

Made this tonight, but I added a little more seasoning to the pork chops before I sauteed them and I used cream of onion soup. This turned out to be a very tasty meal that I will make again

If I were to make it again, I would have to spice it up somehow. Add fresh mushrooms. Maybe sour cream. It just seemed like there was something missing.

I make this with pork steaks and cream of celery soup because I don't care for mushroom soup. I make it in my electric frying pan and let them simmer for about 30 minutes. Mashed taters and fresh green beans are a great finish.

I love this easy recipe. I put in a packet of onion gravy mix with the soup and milk mixture. So good. My hubby loved them too. This will be my go to pork chop recipe.

So simple that I expected it to suck, honestly.  But the entire picky family LOVED it!!  I only modified it slightly but I think it took it up a notch.  I melted half butter and half bacon fat.  To that, I added a bunch of diced onions.  Then once nicely caramelized, I added the onions to the soup mix.  I then added a little more fat to the pan and browned the pork in all of that yumminess.

I had pork ribs in slow cooker and was looking for simple gravy recipe for them. I mixed this one up and poured it in. By the time we ate the pork was shredding, I made mashed potatoes and we served meat and gravy over them. Excellent.

This is a family favorite. Only modification we use is to also add a can of chicken with rice soup and serve it all over white rice. It's a winter comfort food around here.

I used a variation of this recipe. I used brown gravy instead of the cream of mushroom. It was delicious! The meat wasn't dry and was a hit with the family!

Followed recipe as written with exception of doubling gravy.  Pork chops were ok but came out too tough for our liking.  Not a keeper for us.  Thanks though for posting.  Like trying different recipes.

Great recipe!  I don't like mushroom soup, so I used cream of celery instead. The pork chops were so tender and they had a wonderful flavor. I've made this several times now. It's always a hit with the family!

I absolutely loved the recipe. My family couldn't get enough of them and now this recipe is our FAVE! I made about 12 pork chops so I used two cans as suppose to the one. I also subsituted one of the cans for the Campbell's Cream Of Mushroom Garlic Condensed soup which added great flavor. When seasoning, i added a dash of garlic powder and onion powder, [along with the recipe seasonings] and pierced the chops with a fork all over so they will cook more tenderly. While baking I also topped fresh onion to give a little more flavor. They came out perfect! And if you want to make gravy from the sauce, just add a few spoonfuls of flour and you have the perfect smothered pork chops. Enjoy

It is an excellent dish...tasty, comforting and the gravy is the perfect consistency.  The only thing that I added...I added garlic to it as I enjoy garlic on pork chops.  I did double the amount of the soup so I was sure to have gravy for mashed potatoes too....it was delish.

I will try making this again, but I'll use pork steaks instead of pork chops. The chops got tender but dry. Perhaps my chops were too lean. Also, it needs seasonings. Lots of seasonings. I added chopped garlic and onions, and it helped, but the recipe still needs something.

Loved it.  Seasoned the pork chops well when browning.  Added some french fried onions on top of chops and gravy before baking for a little crunch. Delicious.

Great recipe.  A few changes. Sauteed pork chops with onion, mushroom and garlic.  Used 2 cans of soup and 2/3 cup milk.  Omitted water. Very tender and good tasting.

Good basic recipe, needs changes to be great: add 4 sprigs thyme leaves and 6 oz sliced mushrooms (add 1/4 cup white wine if you like) and sautee; and use low fat half and half instead when you stir in the soup mix.  Cooking times are WAY OFF. If YOU COOK A 1" PORKCHOP 5 MINUTES ON EACH SIDE, THEN 45 MINUTES IN OVEN, YOU GET SHOE LEATHER! 2 minutes on each side in the fry pan, then max of 20 minutes in oven, and they are done properly.

Recipe was a good starter. The simplicity of it lends a hand to adjusting your seasoning to taste without being precise at all. I added a bit more seasoning in addition to the salt and pepper it called for such as seasoning salt, garlic powder and a little cayenne for a subtle kick. I also added half a roughly chopped onion which made a major improvement!  Next time, I will add a roughly chopped red bell pepper.  The recipe is great for creating many variations of this dish.

We've been making this for many years and always add onion & garlic to the recipe. We also add a few pinches of dill weed it makes a perfect side dish with home made perogies..

Easy to prepare, no need for a knife when finished. My kids loved this and wanted more.  Will prepare again and will experiment with other seasonings for the pork chop.

Nice quick dinner recipe!  I cut up 2 medium red potatoes, sauteed in the pan with the pork chop seasoning remains.  Added butter, garlic and onion powder and paprika.  Saute for 5mins then cover and cook for 5mins.  Stir frequently.  :)

Because I use skim milk and fat free soup, I added a tsp of corn starch to my water before adding it to the gravy. The whole family enjoyed it, and that NEVER HAPPENS!

I have been making these chops for years with a variation.  I add dried vegetable flakes to the gravy while it cooks.  The veggies soften up and add a great flavor.  I then serve over rice!

I've been doing a similar recipe for years only mine is a stove top version. I season with black pepper & garlic, use the soup with no added liquid & simmer with a lid on the pan until the chops are tender. Yummm yummm

OMG!!! IT WAS SO DELICIOUS!!! But what I did was seasoned the chops with Zatarain's Creole seasonings and garlic powder, sauteed in butter as instructed, and put them in the oven! The chops were so good!!! Thanks for the recipe!!!

I am not rating this recipe as I have not tried it but I do the same thing except I brown the chops, pour the can of mushroom soup and 1/2 cup approx. of sour cream into the pan used to brown the chops. Scrape all the little pieces of the bottom, pour over chops and I only bake for 20 - 25 mins. Serve with garlic mashed potatoes. Great comfort food and very easy. Well I wasn't going to rate it but have to, to submit...LOL.

I have been making this type of recipe for a long time.  I add paprika and mushrooms,  in addition to the salt and pepper, to the butterfly  chops when I saute them.  I mix the cream of mushroom soup with 3/4 can of white wine directly into the frying pan to get all the juices from the pan.  I do not add milk of water.   I then pour the whole thing in my slow cooker and let it cook for approximately 4-6 hours.  It makes for a very different taste.  Remember to use a good quality wine, it will only enhance the taste.

I have also done my own version of this with gravy. I sometimes add onions or mushrooms or both. The chops are so tender and moist.

This was great! My husband loved it! Followed a few of the suggestions from others. Seasoned chops with pepper and garlic salt, garlic powder and onion powder.  Used 1 can cream of mushroom, 1 can golden mushroom, half package pork gravy seasoning, half a soup can of beef broth, no water, no milk, fried the pork chops in butter, removed from pan added some chopped garlic and sautéed some onion and fresh mushrooms, put soup mixture in the sautee pan with mush and onions, baked 30 minutes uncovered at 350, covered with foil and let it stay in the oven at 200 because chops were thin, tender incredibly flavorful, and EASY.  This one is a no brainer and it's great every time.  Many Thanks

I have a recipe similar to this, but it takes longer to cook, so I thought I'd give this one a try. I made it exactly the way it said, except adding some sliced onion to the dish.  The pork chops were not tender at all. They were hard to chew and the gravy was runny. Will use my tried and trued recipe in the future.

This is a great recipe, very easy to make, easy clean up, and very good. I misread the recipe and thought it called for 1/4 inch chops. Mine had to be at least 1-1/2 inch, so I made triple the gravy. When I realized what I did, it was too late. Read the recipe... believe me, you won't need triple the gravy (lol). Very good, and thanks for sharing. I'll be making this again.

Absolutely delicious! Used 4 bone in chops with old bay and onion powder, 1/2 medium onion diced with 3 cloves of garlic browned. Since I was out of milk, I used 2/3 cup of milk, splash of water with 2 cans from of mushroom. Also deglazed pan with white wine and added to gravy mixture. Husband and I really loved this! Thank you, Jennipoo

Very tasty! Easy! A hit basically. I've been looking for a good pork chop recipe and this is a keeper. I'm not a big pork chop fan so wanted a good recipe other than the standard grilled version (which I like). I browned the chops in olive oil and butter then following other reviewers' lead, sauteed a chopped onion and diced garlic (4 cloves) in pan drippings. Added soup and about 1/2 cup water rather than milk. The gravy was excellent. Will be making this again.

These were really good and my family enjoyed them. My only problem was that I followed the directions to a T and almost burned instead of sauteed my pork chops. Besides that, these were delicious and I will be baking them for my spouse when he returns home.

We love this dish. We make it a complete meal by changing it up just a bit. We put the chops in an oven safe dish and layer peeled and sliced potatoes over the chops and cover with mushroom sauce. We also use 2 cans of soup mix and a little more milk so we have a lot of gravy. Perfect comfort food!

This is an awesome meal that we all loved. My husband is not a great fan of pork but said it was great. My daughter cleaned her plate, which doesn't happen often.  The one thing I did differently was to use cream of mushroom with roasted garlic, which was awesome. I also only fried the chops for 2 to 3 minutes a side, which was plenty long enough. Great recipe, thank you!

The gravy was good (I used the low sodium cream of mushroom so it  wouldn't be too salty) but the pork chops were kind of dry...

so I didn't follow exact directions, but did take some advice from other reviews. Unfortunatley I still found this recipe to be bland. The pork came out a tad dry and the "gravy" pretty much was tasteless. I still gave it a 2 star because i'm sure with a few extra spices and cooked at a lower temp this dish would make this not a great dish but an ok dish. But as is personally my husband and I found this dish to be a waste of ingrediants.

Awesome flavor.  My husband and I both loved it.  Our pork chops were definitely not melt-in-your-mouth tender though.  Maybe because we got them on sale?  Will definitely try it again with different pork chops.  Might try it with chicken too.

What a wonderful way to have pork chops with frying them! I changed the recipe a bit. For liquid I used a can of cream of chicken soup and a powdered turkey gravy. I simmered the two of them together for the liquid. I put a layer of sauted onions on the bottom of the dish and then repeated the onions on top. I finished the dish off with cracked pepper and baked it for slow...275 degrees for 2 and half hours. You could cut them with a fork and the gravy on the mashed potates was wonderful. A keeper recipe!!!

I used extra thick chops and seasoned them with salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder.  After browning them in the skillet for a couple minutes each side I poured the soup, water, milk mix into the skillet and put the whole thing in the oven (350/45 min). At the end I checked the temp with a probe and the chops were way over 160 degrees, so next time I may lower the oven temp to keep them more moist.  The gravy was very good but ended up thin so I removed the chops from the skillet and reheated the gravy on the stovetop, adding a cornstarch/water slurry and stirred until thickened.  I served with stovetop stuffing and then spooned gravy over chop & stuffing. Green beans on the side.  Thanks for the recipe! Will make again.

I think this turned out really well.  The only reason I did not give 5 stars is because the pork needs additional seasoning before cooking.  I used salt, pepper, garlic powder, and thyme.

The gravy was excellent with mashed potato's. Next time I will season the pork chops a little more(they did not have much flavor). Overall a good meal!

I have made a version of this recipe for years. Although i add alot of garlic, and only quickly sear the chops on high heat in some olive oil before baking in the oven with the gravy, I have also made it with sausages and it has always been a fav... When friends come for dinner they often ask me to make it with sausages...I usually make it with rice pilafe

This is fabulous and easy.  The chops came out super moist even though I cut every fit of fat off first.  I followed the recipe exactly as specified.  I served it with rice which was really good with the extra gravy.

This was  very east and delicios dish. My family and I enjoyed it very much and there were no left-overs. the gravy was just the slightest bit bland and needed a little salt.

Perfect for the husband and picky-eater son!  I added one teaspoon of minced garlic to the gravy mixture.  Love this recipe..so quick and easy to make for busy families.   Mashed potatoes are a must for all of the extra gravy!

The best pork chops ever and so easy.  I followed the recipe, and only added Worchestershire sauce as some other reviewers did. Also, a splash of soy sauce.  I baked slow (300 for 2 hours) and they were so tender.  Definitely will make this again!

I loved this recipe. i just tried it but my changes were. i used boneless about an inch thick chops which cut the bake time down to 15 minutes. when i seasoned them i used salt pepper AND season salt. and before baking i topped them with french fried onions. me and my husband ate them up.

I have done a variation of this recipe in the past and I was interested to try it with the milk and water added to the soup. the Gravy was great but the pork chops were tough and boarderline dry after 45+ minutes in the oven. the chops were bonenless and about 1.5 cm or 1 inch thick.  I will try again but I will cook them longer and slower.

My husband loves pork chops. I can't say that I do, because i have never been able to make them tender. So after my husbend keep bugging be to make pork chops i decided to try this recipe. Wow I was shocked that pork can be so tender. I'm also not a big cream of mushroom soup person. It was the best pork chops that I have ever tasted. I also have a very picky family (gees i wonder where they get that from) the whole family loved this dinner. I served it with mash potato's and corn. This recipe is also a very fast meal. Thanks a bunch!

It was just okay.  Unfortunately, I think the potatos we paired it with overpowered the pork.

I made this with a few modifications. Being on a low sodium diet, I decided to  make home made cream of mushroom soup 1 from this site. I breaded the pork chops and browned them stovetop with onions and garlic. baked it all in the oven as directed and it came out great. Had enough soup left over for another night. Will make it again

Great chops, but I ended having to microwave the pork at the end to get it up to 170 degree internal temp.. but great flavor and very moist! I used the cream of chicken as someone suggested and it was great. I had flash fried the chops in sauteed onions and minced garlic, and used extra light olive oil instead of butter. Other than that, I followed the recipe. I served with small quartered potatoes and carrots, drizzled with olive oil, salted, peppered, with a couple bay leaves, some oregano and rosemary. Magnifico!

I have never really been a fan of pork chops. My wife likes them so I find myself cooking them every once in awhile. This recipe changed my mind! Very moist and flavorful. I added sauteed garlic, onions and mushrooms. I did not add water at all. I seasoned the chops with Prudhommes Pork & Veal magic before searing them in the pan w onions, garlic and mushrooms. Very tasty. My wife loved them. Served with baked potato & grean beans/mushrooms.

These were great and easy to make!  I'm giving 4 stars b/c I think it needed a LITTLE more seasoning.  I think next time I'll throw on some Lipton onion soup mix when I bake it.

This was just ok. I may have ruined it for myself because I used cream of chicken soup (non-mushroom people) and it just didn't taste right. I might try it with another cream of something next time.

One of my favorites from this site.  Made a few adjustments.  Used 2 cans of soup, added 1 cup fresh mushrooms and 1/2 cup chopped onion to pork chop dripping, and only baked for 35 mins.  Wonderful we absolutely love this recipe.  Thanks

THE BEST PORK CHOPS EVER! I made a 6 chops.  Used cream of mushroom soup & cream of chicken soup together and the sauce was amazing.  Served with mashed potatoes and used the sauce as gravy.  Baked, covered in foil, @ 275 for 3 hours. The meat melted in our mouths!

I wanted to add that along with being very good, this has a quick cleanup. I love anything that allows me to get my kitchen back in order while it's cooking.  The only things I'll have left to wash are the dishes we eat off of, the baking pan, and the pot with the other side.  Anything to make my Saturday's easier, that tastes good, is a favorite for me!!!

I've made these on top of the stove for years. I love it that way, this way is just as good. It made it a little easier for a work night though. I browned my chops [boneless country style ribs, this time] layed in my sprayed casserole dish, then sauted onions and soup and other recipe ingredients with a chicken boullion cube till desolved. Pour it over the chops. Covered in the fridge. When my son came home, he just took the plastic wrap off, put in a 325* oven. Let it cook for 2 hrs. YUM. Threw in a micro. steamed bag of brown rice, heated a can of beans, and some brown and serve rolls. Nice work day meal.

Quite delicious!!  I sauteed 1/4 onion with 1 t. minced garlic in butter.  Then I browned the chops in that.  I also changed the gravy to 1 can cream of mushroom soup, 1 can golden mushroom soup, & 3/4 cup milk.  I added the onion & garlic to the gravy.  It was great!!

I am a single Dad and my 5 year old loves this recipe. I did however add a little something too it as we all do at times. I add a package of French Onion Mix to the soup base and it is remarkable. Thanks for the recipe.

Easy, peasy dinner. Skipped the first part & just put them in the oven with the gravy over them. Had to cook mine a bit longer, but they were pretty thick.

This is a GREAT recipe......Everyone in the house just loved it!!!! I also made a few changes. Like the other reviewers I omitted the water for a thicker gravy mix. Doing so still allowed the chops to be moist. When I browned the chops in butter first before baking I added onion for a little extra flavor and while browning I made the gravy mix and like the other reviewers I added whorcheshire sauce. After putting them in the baking dish I poured the gravy in the butter/onion and then poured it over the chops to bake. I know.....its makes them much more fattening but honestly they were to die for. Not something the family needs to eat every week but but certainly a wonderful dish and worth trying. I made as side dishes red skinned potatoes and and used with the gravy also with green beans.

This was a delicious dish but I gave it 4 stars only because I made some changes. I used a lot of madisonliberty's advice and did a couple of small changes on my own.  I seasoned the chops with old bay, browned them in a hot skillet with olive oil, chopped onion, fresh mushrooms and garlic.  For the gravy, I used 1 can of cream of mushroom and 1 can of golden mushroom soup, and mixed 2/3 cup of milk in. Then I stirred the sauteed mixture of onions, mushrooms and garlic in with the soup. I poured the gravy mixture over the chops and baked it for an hour at 350. OMG, I would have to say the gravy was incredible. My husband wants that gravy recipe to be a staple in our house. To make it a total comfort food dinner, we poured the gravy over mashed potatoes and corn.  The chops were good, but I have to say it was the gravy that was the hit.  I love the golden mushroom soup because it gives the gravy a brownish color vs the plain old mushroom soup and it has a flavor that it out of this world.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was extremely easy to make and it was a big hit with my husband and my kids. It did not take long at all to get this in the oven, and when I had about 5 minutes to go in there, I took it out and topped it with french fried onions. That was a delightful flavor and texture for this dish!

My boyfriend said that these were the best pork chops he ever had! I agreed. Im not a huge fan of pork chops, but this is a great recipe. I recomend using a smaller baking dish to allow the sauce to completely smother the pork chops. This way they are totally tender. I didn't use water at all because I wanted the mixture to be thick. I added a little more milk than what it called for and added mushroom and bacon to the gravy. Soooo good. Serve with mashed potaotes so you can put the gravy on those too! Thanks for the recipe.

So delicious on a cold night.  The kids and man ate every bite.  It is so simple to make, but really homey and good.  just be sure to serve it with lighter healthier items like brown rice and plenty of veg.

I made the recipe as directed, but added some Worestershire Sauce, and some Mrs. Dash to the pork chops when sauteing in butter as some of the other reviewers suggested. It was very tasty. I would use two cans of soup for 4 pork chops. Also, baking longer than an hour should result in a more tender pork chop. I will definitely make this again!

A very good recipe! I used cream of chicken soup instead of the mushroom, added half a can of milk, and mixed it together with a pinch of salt and some powdered chicken bouillon, and it turned out delicious. I baked them at 300 degrees instead of 350, and they were very tender. Great with some sweet cornbread.

Yummy!! I seasoned the chops with Old Bay as suggested, salt & pepper then browned them in EVOO with minced garlic about 3 min on each side. Then threw them in the oven. Mixed the soup with 2/3rds cup milk and poured it over the chops and baked for 40 min. Made a great gravy to also put on mashed potatoes. Kids gobbled it up and actually asked for seconds. Thanks for the great recipe

I was pretty disappointed in this recipe.  Going off others' reviews, I added garlic to the butter before browning the chops, and I reduced the milk to 2/3 C and omitted the water.  The gravy tasted good, but was really runny.  The pork chops weren't tender.  I won't make this again.

This was yummy, but mine turned out a little bit dry.  I'll definitely make again, just not cook quite as long, or lower the oven temperature.  I sprinkled a little thyme, onion powder and garlic powder on the chops after browning, as another reviewer suggested.  I also didn't add the water to the soup, since so many said the gravy was runny. Great taste though, I'll try again next week! ;o)

I gave this four stars because it tastes great and is so easy!  Like many other users, I skipped the milk.  This makes it a more economical recipe and it still tastes great.  Here is how I prepare it: skip the milk per comments and reviews- this is a great recipe.  I heat up a  tiny bit of EVOO and minced garlic- about one clove.  Then I put the chops in, bone in.  I pepper the side that is not cooking.  I flip after five minutes and do not pepper the other side.  After a few minutes I add two handfuls of froxen green beans and let that sit a minute.  Then I add a can of cream of mushroom soup and about a 1/4 can of water, and cook for a few minutes.  Then I scrape it all off into a square glass baking dish and cover and cook as directed.

This was very easy to make.  I also added a slice of onion on top and then poured some of the mushroom gravy over the chops before baking. It definitely helped with the blandness.  My husband loved it!

used a family pack of smoked pork chops, and 3/4 of can of milk, from the empty soup can, instead of what was in the ingredients. omited the water. Cooked soup and milk in pan till mixed well together then poured onto the pork chops, cooked for 35min. I'm not a meat eater But the gravy was good and husband said it was a good dish, the gravy was still very thin even with omiting the water.

I've cooked a pork dish very similar to this one before but without the water and the milk...just the cream of mushroom soup!  I should have followed my original recipe as the recipe that includes the water and milk simply diluted the cream of mushroom soup. My original recipe calls for pork tenderloin cut in 1 - 2 inch cubes; browning them in a skillet for about 15 minutes before adding the cream of mushroom soup and a dash of black pepper.  No offense to the author of this dish but I will not make this dish again with water and milk.

It's definitely missing something, but I can't figure out what. There's just not enough flavor to it. But it is quick, easy, and relatively healthy and goes great with potatoes.

This recipe was very good.  I had to thicken up the gravy because it was watery.  Once thickened though, it was very nice to be so quick and easy.  I also sauteed some onion and mushrooms to put in the gravy mix. Thank you.

Very good recipe...I added onions and mushrooms to the gravy, and used garlic salt instead of table salt...a little strong, but that was of my own doing. Turned out delicious though, and the gravy was great on rice!!!

Wow, this was good and super simple.  I did modify a little since I only had Campbell's Golden Mushroom soup in the pantry.  I used 2 cans golden mushroom and added 1 cup milk, 8 oz sauteed cremini mushrooms and 1/2 large onion.  The gravy was a little watery, but delicious.  It was so simple to make and so good!  I usually do not like condensed soup recipes, but this was awesome.  Baked the same way.  I served with gravy over baked potatoes.

My husband "the critic" actually loved this dish! I added sauteed mushrooms and onions to the recipe and served it with royal blend rice and cauliflower au gratin and he said "This is a keeper.  This is a good combination.  You should make it again, but always make the same combination together with it."  It really was delicious - very easy and quick to make which is a godsend for a cook who works full-time too.  We loved it!

Great Flavor!
I followed other suggestions and left out the water and milk. Also sauted garlic, lots of onions and mushrooms like everyone suggested. I don't like mushrooms and my boyfriend doesn't like onions but we both thought it was great. I used 2 cans of cream of mushroom. YUMMY!!!

This is such an easy, quick recipe!  I've made them twice now, and both times they came out perfect.  Even the kids like them, and the gravy is great on mashed potatoes.  The only thing I changed was to use garlic salt and onion powder when I season the chops.

These were good. We baked them for the full time and they were dry, so next time we'll bake them about 10 minutes less. But I thought the taste was great and we will definitely make them again!

This was okay. I didn't bake the pork chops as long as stated and they were still a little dry to me. The taste is okay. It's just nothing that stands out and makes you want to have this again soon.

This recipe wasn't bad, but in all honesty it wasn't that good. I added sauteed garlic and onions and a 1/2 cup of sour cream to the cream of mushroom soup mix and in the end it was just bland. Maybe if I had added some worcestershire sauce it would have added something, but I don't think enough to make me want to make this again...

Great recipe. I used garlic salt instead of regular salt to season the pork chops, and only added 1/2 cup milk and no water. The soup was thin but not too thin. Served with garlic mashed potatoes---yum!

Don't add any milk or water to the recipe unless you want very runny gravy.  I added an extra can of soup thinking it would help thicken up the gravy but it was still too runny.
This recipe didn't turn out so well for me BUT I was using pork chops that had been frozen for quite a while and I've never cooked pork chops before.  My chops ended up being very tough and the flavor was only so-so.  I had added a bit of garlic powder but I guess it wasn't enough.
I'd try this again but with fresher meat and only using soup with seasoning. No milk or water.

I'm always afraid that pork chops will be dry when I bake them.  Not so in this recipe!  Ended up being pretty salty and did not enough flavor for me, but I'll use this as a base recipe in the future - thank you!

i've tried this with both the bone-in and the boneless porkchops (center cut), and it was ok...the gravy is a little watery for my taste. should probably cut down on the other liquids next time.

I was doubtful about the recipe as written but when I read the modifications by MADISONLIBERTY, I knew it would be a tastey dish. I used the whole can of mushrooms, PLENTY of Old Bay seasoning, but otherwise followed the ingredients as directed by MADISONLIBERTY. I needed to bake it longer (because of a delayed dinner) but it still was very tastey and not even close to becoming dry or overcooked. Family enjoyed it.

I followed the additions to the recipe that  MADISONLIBERTY review left(the latest).  That made the best recipe ever!  The gravy was just right, and I could see how it would not have enough taste if the onions and garlic had not been added.

I made these a day ahead and first cooked a little onion and garlic in butter and olive oil.  I added the pork chops to brown, removed the pork chops and added the soup with a little milk and apple juice and a can of mushrooms.  These were delicious.

Pretty good basic recipe, just a little bland for my taste. Next time I will use more spices. I substituted white wine for the water. I found the gravy to be just a little thin, but the flavor was great.

This was a fairly easy recipe.  Browning the chops took the most time.  Maybe would not have taken so long if I would have had a larger pot.  This is a great one.

I covered mine and baked. I had large chops and they came out very tough. I tried the montreal seasoning, but it was too much! Not very happy with the recipe :(

Quick, easy and delicious!  The chops stay moist and tender and the gravy is wonderful--good on mashed potatoes or rice.  Both of my "boys" (one is 35, and the other is 3) love this one.  Thanks for a great recipe!

These chops were tasty, although mine got alittle dry and tough. Maybe I need to cut down the baking time, but other than that, great flavor and easy.

I made this dish tonight and it was sooo good. My family is so picky, but they all raved as to how good this was. I did season the chops with seasoning salt & garlic powder, and I added the salt & pepper to the soup mixture. It was very tastey.

My husband really liked this recipe and even commented on it later in the night.  The gravy is very tasty, my daughter and I really enjoyed it over white rice.  I'm not a big fan of chops but will certainly make this again.  It's easy to make with few ingredients and still comes out tasty-great for weeknight cooking. Thanks Jennifer!

This recipe was easy and tasted great!  My husband and 2 young children loved it.  I seasoned the pork chops with garlic salt and paprika for extra flavor.  I also doubled the gravy and served with mashed potatoes.  It was an easy home cooked meal.

This was very good but i think alot of the success of this recipe depends on the quality of chops you use.  I didn't have the fantastic chops i usually use, but still the recipe was very good.  I will definately make this again with a thicker butterfly chop that i get cut from the butcher.  My husband thought they were great!

These chops really really did melt in your mouth. I used garlic and onion powders to season and for my sauce I mixed together one can of golden mushroom soup, a can of healthy cream of mushroom soup and about a half container of lite sour cream. So delicious Jennifer!

This had really good flavor but i overcooked my chops. Didnt make much gravy. If i do make this again i will double up on the gravy and try to cook less time. Maybe i browned them too long in the pan first. Other than them being dry and not enough gravy it was good. Thanks!!

This recipe was okay, the Pork Chops were bland even when I seasoned them more than I should have. The Gravy was the only thing that came out good. I don't think I'll make this again.

My family loved this one.  The chops were so tender.  I did add fresh garlic and onion to the skillet before frying the chops and used cream of mushroom chicken soup.  Excellent!  Will be a regular for us now.

YUMMY!!!! My whole family enjoyed this recipe. Was cooking and my niece told me "don't like pork chops" and she went for thirds!! LOL Thanks for sharing.
