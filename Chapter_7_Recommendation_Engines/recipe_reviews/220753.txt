I was so excited about this recipe, that I actually went to 4 different markets (Trader Joe's didn't have rutabaga, Whole Foods didn't have parking, Ralph's didn't have dill).  Love all the ingredients separately, but dear god, this is bland despite an entire head of garlic.  Easy to make, but completely tasteless.  Whatever it needs to make it palatable, it's not included on the ingredient list.

I am sick with bronchitis and wanted no more chicken noodle anything.  This was okay but relatively tasteless as I knew it might be so added some salt and pepper and doubled the garlic.  If one is ill, excellent way to add vegetables and as I was so sick, added a pack of coarse coleslaw which included purple cabbage and carrots and then I didn't have to cut up the cabbage.

completely lacks any flavor other than dill,it was so overwhelming! and i agree with the past review in that the garlic was not enough to save this recipe. while rutabaga was a good choice, i would suggest substituting it with something like celery root. celery root would soften a bit in the slow cooker and round off some of the flavor profile. I froze half of what i made, and when i unfreeze it, i added celery salt and parsley.
