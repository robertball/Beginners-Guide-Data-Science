This is a great basic quiche. Pretty darn close to the recipe that my mom has used for years. We have tweaked it with spinach, zucchini, mushrooms and different cheeses and spices. I stuck to the recipe, with the suggestion of added cheese (gruyere) and a couple of sweet onions that I had on hand. If you have never made a quiche before, this is a great place to start.

Very good. I used ham instead of bacon but would make this with bacon too. Thanks!

Totally loved it. I used a 10" quiche pan, and used a recipe for a two crust (oil, pat in) for the single crust, 1/2 baking it before filling it. It was absolutely perfect!

So good!  The  bacon flavor mixed so nicely with the rich custard of the quiche.   I couldn't find slab bacon, so I bought thick-sliced bacon and cut it into ~ 1/2 inch squares.  I really liked the biggish chunks of bacon.
