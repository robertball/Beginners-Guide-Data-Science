I subbed four egg yolks for the two eggs because I wanted to use the whites for a marshmallow frosting. I really enjoyed the subtle mocha, which wasn't strong enough to bother coffee-hating relatives. My marshmallow idea actually turned out great because the cake wasn't over-sweet. I do think I'd use two 8" pans next time or put foil over my 9 x13, because the edges cooked faster than the center. Part of that is my glass pan, which is pretty but not ideal for cakes, but it seemed like the wet batter exacerbated the problem. I will definitely make this again.
