I left out the tomatoes (allergic) and used the water. The feta and crusty bread were perfect  additions.

Really good tasting but I added paprika to the onions and then followed the recipe exactly. I followed the suggestion to have bread and cheese with the meal as the peas were the main course. The potato took much longer than 30 minutes. The sauce for the peas were fantastic along with the dill. Really tasty....

This was very good but missing something. I can't put my finger on it but needed some more spice.

This dish was quite tasty! I would give it 5 stars, but I used canned, no-salt-added sweet peas and dried dill. Still, it was something I would make again.  I halved the recipe,  and it was a filling serving.  Instead of a chunk of Feta, I sprinkled a couple tablespoons of crumbled Feta cheese on the side - fantastic addition.
