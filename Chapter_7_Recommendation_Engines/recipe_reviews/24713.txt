I'm originally from Buffalo NY and Texas hot dogs are a big favorite. You can get the Greek recipe that is used in Western NY form a site called Greekhotdog sauce. Its as good as it gets for the authentic sauce.

"TEXAS" hot dog sauce should not be confused with the original "GREEK" recipe, which contained no tomato products, sauce, puree, or whatever....and where in the heck did cinnamon come in ????

This may be a good substitute for the real thing....however....I will "El Paso" on this one.

texas wieners Altoona PA ?   this has been a secret recipe since the 1900s lol. here's what I know from an uncle that worked there he would not divulge the recipe but would say whether we where right on ingredients. The one thing he said was that NO left overs where wasted at the hotdog stand ! Which makes perfect sense during the time frame of the depression .  So what was on the menu is the major components of the sauce. The only meat products they sold were steer burgers and hotdogs. steer burgers where basically steamed hamburgers broiled in onions.  The sauce is definitely made form left over steer burgers and hotdogs ground fine ! The other major item they sold was black coffee !  this is the big secret they threw nothing away not even left over coffee ! There is no tomato products the sauce color comes from the seasonings . there is NO sausage , they did not sell sausage. there is no cinnamon ! the seasonings in the recipe above are very close but no cinnamon the coffee brings the red brown color and tones the peppers down adding that slight bitterness . 
steer burgers , hotdogs and black coffee are confirmed , No tomato products not even catsup is confirmed. Cinnamon is not an ingredient and is confirmed (we tried that before and found that Uncle Binky said we where correct) . Again look at the times and menu at the early Texas wiener stand and think the way they did during the depression !

This was really good. I used a whole can of tomato soup and less water so the sauce was thicker. I'll make it again. It would be a great recipe for camping.

I have made a sauce similar to this one but without the frankfurters. I had never heard of that but it's a good idea.  I just don't eat frankfurters.  I only eat sauce on buns.   I'm from West Virginia and  I also put a hint of cinnamon in my sauce as well as vinegar.  Some people are afraid of something different.  But this is a thumbs up for me. Thanks for sharing.

Europeans have no idea what hotdog sauce is. I cook the sauce without the dogs and freeze it in small containers. A few minutes in the microwave and homesickness goes bye-bye. Unquestionably better than anything store-bought and besides, I like knowing what's in my sauce.

Excellent recipe!  Serving tip:  fry the hotdogs.  Butter the inside of the hotdog buns and fry them, also.  Not the most heart healthy way to eat them, but boy are they yummy! Don't forget the onion...I hate raw onion, but even I couldn't believe how much flavor they add to the sauce!

My husband also added a little melted cheese to his...yummy!

It was probably the brands of hotdogs and soup I used, but this turned out rather salty. Despite this, we enjoyed it. I would probably not bother with the breadcrumbs next time though - they didn't add anything to it. Thanks, Diane!

I really wanted to like this recipe. It sounded so good. I let my family rate this recipe. My family was not a fan of this recipe. In order to please my family, I did tweak the recipe. I doubled the recipe. I used a whole can of tomato soup, 1/2 cup of ketchup, 1 tsp. garlic powder, and 1 tsp. of onion powder. Also, the cinnamon was not something my family likes in a topping for hot dogs. My family also didn't like the bread crumbs.  So, I would leave those two items out. To thicken it, I would make a roux with flour. After all the changes, my family rated this recipe as a 4.

Good recipe but as someone from Western NY I had to make some tweaks. First I updated recipe for 48 servings so it will be half lb. each of pork and beef, and omitted frankfurters. 1 can tomato soup, 2 cups of water, half cup italian bread crumbs, two tbsp chili powder, 2 tsp red wine vinegar, 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes, 3 tsp hot sauce. Next time I will be adjusting cinnamon from 3/4 tsp to 1/2 because it was just a wee little bit too cinnamon-ey. Also make sure to get the ground meat as fine as you can by crushing it with a spatula. My tweaks made for a spicier and thicker sauce. Thanks!

Harry, I'm also from just south of Buffalo and you are correct. The original recipe for the area was invented by a greek man in Buffalo. My Aunt worked for him and he gave her the recipe as long as she did not use it in the Buffalo area while he was living. The original recipe does not saute the ingredients but simmers it. that's why the texture is so fine in it. NO ground hot dogs or tomato soup. It was ground suet and tomato paste/sauce mixture. I hope this helps everyone out there that wants to perfect this sauce back to it's originality.
