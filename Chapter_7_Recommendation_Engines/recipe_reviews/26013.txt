This was exceptional!  The only thing I have to add is this: Make sure you let the coconut filling cool before attempting to use it.  I didn't let it cool and when I started frosting with the chocolate, I had the coconut oozing out all over and it made a real mess.  Fortunately, putting it in the fridge for an hour saved it.  Once it set a bit I kind of smooshed everything back it and refrosted over with more chocolate frosting.  It ended up looking great and tasting even better!  I used devil's food cake mix and milk chocolate frosting...next time I think I will try dark chocolate frosting. Thanks!

Delicious cake.  You could almost cut the filling recipe in 1/2.  Everyone love this cake.

Although my family isn't big fans of boxed cake mixes and containerized frostings, I followed this to the letter, and I'm so glad I did! For this quick and easy recipe, we were rewarded with outstanding flavor and texture. Thanks Vickeylee.

Lovely filling that you could use in virtually any cake. It was delicious! I made a cake from scratch but added the brewed coffee instead of water, and I used my own butter cream frosting. The filling is such a wonderful addition - thanks!

For my taste, the marshmallow/evaporated milk mixture was not sweet enough.  Maybe sweetened condensed milk instead would make it taste okay?

This cake was amazing! Made it for my father's birthday. The filling is almost the exact same as a  Mounds bar. Delicious. Next time I'm going to try to incorporate almonds into the filling or maybe just on top. Not sure yet. But I can't wait to try this cake again!

Sooooo good.  Shelby, there is another recipe elsewhere for the same filling, except it also contained 1 cup of sugar.  I think that too sweet, maybe 1/2 cup? Cook milk, butter & sugar 10 minutes, then stir in marshmallows.  Continue as directed, but do remember to cool filling before using it.
