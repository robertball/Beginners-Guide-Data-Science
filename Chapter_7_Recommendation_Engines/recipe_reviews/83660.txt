This recipe is amazing. My children ask for it all the time. I made 2 small changes, 1 I boiled a whole chicken in my favorite spices and used both white and dark meat, 2 I used low sodium chicken broth because it was to salty using the regular broth.

I made this and 4X'd the recipe.  It was a huge hit and I gave some to family.  Even my kids loved it! I am on my second time making this soup.

This was good.  I halved the recipe and it made about 5 large servings. I made regular white rice in my rice cooker and added it instead of instant (worked fine).  And I used some cajun seasoning on my chicken to add a little flavor.  Will make again.

It was just ok.  Not a whole lot of flavor.  I only used 3C of rice instead of 4C and that seemed to be a lot.  The cheddar cheese really didn't melt well- there were rubbery chunks here and there. It probably could use more velveeta(processed cheese food).  My 3 and 5 year olds did not like it- I was surprised because my 3yr old LOVES soup.  I probably will not make it again.

Exactly what I was looking for. I messed up and only put 46oz of broth in it, but I only ended up putting one cup of white rice in it and added 8 more ounces of processed cheese (I like my cheese). Thanks!

I used 3 cups of rice and it was plenty.  Turned more into a rice dish instead of soup.  Easy to make and tasty.

This was a great, fast soup!  I used instant brown rice instead, and it worked well.  I also kept some soup aside without the processed cheese and pureed it for baby food - both my toddler and my 9 month old loved it!

This turned out to be more of a side dish than a soup. The instant rice continued to absorb so much of the liquid that it became very thick. I had to add more liquid before serving. The overall flavor was good, but I would only recommend using half the recommended rice in this recipe.

My family loves this stuff. Its more like a casserole then a soup but thats ok with us.  I have made a few changes to the recipe over the years, i always use low sodium chicken broth, and I boil a small whole chicken with onion and celery, then i pull all the meat off bones and use it.  yes this way takes a bit longer but it taste so much better.

This was really good. I was short on time and threw this together with what I had on hand,  I did make a few changes. I used canned cheese. I had frozen broccoli that I pre cooked. And less rice, only used 2 cups brown rice that I had leftover from yesterday, So good my 4 year old loved it.  I will definitely make this again.

Good! Liked that it uses fresh broccoli instead of frozen.  Also only used 3 c of instant rice, glad I did not use 4! Might only try using 2 next time so it seems more like soup.

My WHOLE family loved this and they do not like broccoli.  I subbed a can of cheese soup instead of the Velveeta.  I loved this bc I'd been looking for a soup that could match one I'd had at a restaurant years ago.  This one did it!! I cut the chicken as small as possible and I followed the rest of the directions exactly.  It was perfect.

I liked the flavor of this soup, the cheeses melted perfectly; but it made way too much. After the second day of this I still had enough to feed a 5 person family. Tasty but watch out you don't make too much

This was excellent. Used one package frozen broccoli, cooked chicken thighs, two cans cheddar cheese soup, 1 3/4 cups minute rice, 2 cartons chicken broth, garlic, minced onion, pepper, Cajun spice.

I made this recipe for my family,  I followed the instructions but, I did make some adjustments. 1st I did not buy chicken broth,  I used Maggi bouillon cubes. I noticed that after I added the broccoli and cheese that for a soup the the consistency was thin. I added corn starch to thicken I also added butter. As for the rice I make it but I only made 2 cups and did not add it to the pot,  I also added a bouillon cube to give the rice flavor and color.  We were able to add rice to your bowl as you see fit. Overall,  the soup was great and my family loved it. I will be keeping this in rotation of food I cook.

Really good soup. I added 6 cut up slices of bacon to the onions (love that smell). I will definitely add this to my favorites.

Love this recipe, super easy to make I use a roasted chicken from the grocery store so I didn't have to prepare the chicken. An use only 2 cups of rice the second time around, first time it was too much rice.

This soup hit the spot! It was a winner with my 2 year old granddaughter and my husband!  I used long grain brown rice and cooked it with a chicken bullion cube in the water. My experience has been slow cooking rice doesn't absorb the soup as much as instant and I had the extra 20 minutes to make it.

Love this recipe for a quick and simple meal for a group.  I cook it and then put in crock pot to take places and it hardens to be a substance of casserole-worthy.  Very tasty!!

This isn't really a soup once you add the rice, and I even cut the amount in half.  It's more like a casserole once the rice cooks and absorbs the liquid.  I had to add two cups of water and one cup of milk to get it back to a soup consistency.

It's a great recipe.  I however had tweaked mine.  I used 1 stick of butter and I added a half a bag of egg noodles in place of the rice, since my son doesn't care for rice.  It was quite yummy!

This was really!  Followed the recipe except I followed advice from others and just did 3 cups of rice...even with that it was still really thick as the rice absorbed so much of the broth.  I did end up adding in some milk...maybe a cup or so, so help thin it out a bit.  Was very good and served with fresh warm bread.  Will make again!  Thanks!

Followed the recipe pretty right on but used bullion since I didn't have broth. The only down side is that the rice soaks up the broth, making it next time I might add more water...I like the rice so I'd keep that quantity but add more liquid. Excellent soup.

I will use half of the rice next time and double the chicken and velveeta. Also, its ohk to be generous with the salt and pepper. It kind of lacked taste, but I think by doubling the cheese that would be fixed. make sure to finely chop the broccoli and chicken. overall it was pretty good and I will be making it again.
