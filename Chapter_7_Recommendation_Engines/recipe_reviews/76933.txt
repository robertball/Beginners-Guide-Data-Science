As the name indicates, this is a savory recipe, not a sweet one.  Knowing that, and intending it to accompany red beans and rice, this recipe came out great for me.  I had only a small (approx 8 oz) can of creamed corn, so I added about 1/2 cup of water and 1/2 cup more of buttermilk to make up for it.  I was concerned about the consistency of the batter--it was about as thick as cooked cream of wheat--but the muffins rose up nicely and are not dense.  Given others' complaints about saltiness, since I was using salted butter I reduced the added salt to a dash, but it could actually use a little more.  Perhaps 1/2 tsp if using salted butter is the happy medium.  I put in half a 4.75 oz can of green chilis to give it zing, and topped each one with a bit of shredded cheddar cheese to get a crackly, flavorful top.  This made exactly four dozen mini muffins.  Though they came out of the metal mini-muffin tins crispier, even those baked in the silicone mini-muffin pan have a satisfying texture, chewy on the outside and velvety on the inside.

I have the cookbook that this recipe appears in (Perfect Recipes For Having People Over by Pam Anderson) and it calls for 1 stick of UNSALTED butter not regular butter as the recipe here states. If using regular salted butter just cut down on the salt as other reviews have suggested. Hope this helps....

DELICIOUS! I would definitely make these for company! As to whether they stay moist, I cannot say...none were left. I did use UNSALTED butter, ONLY 1 tsp. SALT, doubled the sugar to 2 Tbsp., and baked in my stoneware muffin pan, which was oiled/greased with a silicone pastry brush, for 17-18 minutes. (On second try, I tried greasing my stoneware with shortening BEFORE putting in oven, and it worked great.) Crunchy on the outside, and perfectly moist within. The secret is the preheated pan. Mmmm! Served with Ham and Bean Soup II (this site).

These were really good and are pure comfort food!  The directions say to boil the creamed corn and add cornmeal but I skipped this step and simply combined the dry ingredients in a bowl, combined the wet and added to the dry, mixed quickly and proceed to bake in a preheated oven for 15 min.  I used about a 1/3 cup for each muffin and they turned out perfect!

These muffins were definitely moist and stayed that way for a few days! I reduced the salt to 1 tsp which was plenty for me. I would recommend increasing the sugar slightly. These may also be good if jalapenos were added (something I will try next time.) A great compliment to a Mexican meal but they need some doctoring if you're thinking about them for breakfast!!

I would recommend adding more sugar if you are using this for breakfast.  I also made them with plain milk rather than buttermilk and they were still moist.

These tasted great but were a little heavy.  I had to add a considerable amount of extra buttermilk to get the batter to come together smoothly.  I ended up with 18 muffins instead of 12.  They tasted yummy and very buttery.

As is, this is a good recipe if you are looking for a moist corn muffin or bread to accompany dinner. As a breakfast muffin, it does not have enough sweetness. I had doubled the sugar and it still was not sweet enough for me. With that said, I think it is a good base to start, it just needs to be tweaked for personal taste. Some other posters mentioned they came out too salty. Personally, I like the saltiness of them, but I can see how some may not like it.

Very good!  I didn't think it was too salty at all, in fact I thought it could have used a tad more to really bring out the corn flavor.  (I did use unsalted butter.)  But they turned out exactly as described, both crispy and moist.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I'll definitely use this again, perhaps adding in more corn or some jalapenos next time.  ADD: I have tried adding 1/2 cup sugar, but it doesn't make a difference in taste.  If you want to sweeten it, perhaps try 1 cup of sugar.  Or eat it like my grandmother does - with butter and maple syrup on top.  Also, my oven won't go to 450 degrees without setting off the smoke detectors, so for me, 20 minutes at 400 degrees is just right.

An okay recipe - I have three stars because the muffins had WAY too much salt in them. Next time I would use less salt and maybe twice the sugar, or more. They had a nice crunch to them though! I also added chopped jalapenos to half of the batch - good!

This was really good, but I did use about 1/4 cup of sugar instead of the called for 1 tbsp. I like a sweeter batter. I also added jalapeno to half of them for those that like spicy. The only issue I had is the batter was very runny, but it still was pretty good.

Yes, a nice savory muffin.  We prefer using the silicone muffin cups.  Still a nice crust, less sticking, no need to oil the silicone (and yes, the muffins stuck significantly in the metal pans, at least, for us they did).  TIPS:  1) Warmed creamed corn in a large metal mixing bowl on the stove before adding the cornmeal (less bowls to clean), 2) added the butter before the milk and eggs so the heat from the creamed corn mixture could melt the butter, 3) yes, using salted butter would be too much salt (just a reminder for us when we use the recipe again), 4)  works very well with whole wheat flour instead of white flour.  5)  Wished we had a can of green peppers, but meant to add pickled jalapenos and forgot - cheddar might work too?  6)  or try with less salt and some parmesan, black pepper, oregano or other herb, etc.  7)  or try feta and dill???

I took all the other reviewers' advice and reduced the salt to 1/2 teaspoon.  I also like my cornbread on the sweeter side, so I increased the sugar to 3 Tablespoons.   I also used stone-ground cornmeal because I was not baking these for breakfast but for a pot luck dinner to go along with chicken chili I prepared.  I wanted a coarser texture - something that would not turn to mush when you put the chili on top of it.   They turned out pretty good!  Using stone-ground cornmeal means that your muffin will not rise as much as de-kernalized cornmeal, so they did not come out super big.  This recipe actually makes 18, not 12.  Also, I baked them exactly 13 minutes at 425 degrees, and they were just borderline ready to burn - when I opened the oven door, all my smoke alarms went off.  They turned out crispy and buttery tasting on the outside.  Yes, they are moist.  I would make them again.

I just made these 15 minutes ago and they are so tasty! I followed the recipe exactly.  They are so easy to make and I'm sure everyone will love them. This will be a hit for superbowl sunday. If you love corn like I do...make these. You won't be disappointed :)

I made this today and these turned out moist. I added 1 can of green chiles and 1 cup of cheddar cheese. I used unsweetened butter and 1/2 tsp salt. I thought it could have had more salt. I used 2 tbsp of sugar and it was not sweet enough. Next time I would try 1 tsp salt and 1/4 cup sugar. We ate these with honey to add some sweetness.

While my guests enjoyed the muffins my partner and I did not. They weren't savory they were salty. I didn't use the full amount of the salt but didn't increase the amount of sugar in hopes of having savory muffins and yet they were still far too salty. Perhaps it's the can of corn? If I use this recipe again I will be using my own home made cream corn and see how that works out.

The only substitution I made was using regular milk instead of buttermilk, added chopped jalapenos (yum!)  and less salt as everyone suggested. These muffins were good, but not great. We ate them all with chili, but I wouldn't try this recipe again.

I made these a little while ago to go with some chili my aunt was making. The store I went to only had blue corn meal for some reason (other than mixes), so I ended up using that. I followed the recipe otherwise. They looked a bit strange, but they were really good. We didn't have any leftovers.

Baked up moist & looked great!  BUT...I am sorry I didn't listen to other reviewers and reduce the salt even more!  I used 1 teaspoon & sadly,we couldn't eat them, just waaay too salty!  I will give this recipe another try, but next time I won't add any salt, and depend on the salt in the butter & cream corn I guess!  I could not believe how salty this recipe came out!

Good texture and fairly moist. They had a strange aftertaste though. I don't know if it was the can of corn I used or something else, but the flavor was off....almost medicinal?

These muffins were definitely moist and stayed that way for 3 days!  The salty flavor is a little strong but the sugar seemed to counter most of that.  Good add to a mexican meal, but not the best for breakfast.

This is just an update from my previous review. These muffins were just as moist and tasty the day after baking as they were when they were fresh. This is going to be my go-to recipe for corn muffins from now on!

Portions were a bit too much for 12 muffins with my muffin pan, but the taste was fine.  Very moist but not a whole lot of flavor going on.  It would be great with chili, but it does not stand alone as a snack.

Really, really good.  I used coconut oil instead of butter and also increased the sugar to 1/2 cup.  These were perfect with a cup of chili.

Tasty! Definitely savory, not sweet. I used 1 teaspoon salt, which tastes fine. This recipe makes a lot of batter. The direction to "divide evenly" among the muffin cups apparently means "fill to the top." I filled each cup about 3/4 full because I did not want the muffins to rise much over the rim. They didn't -- a full cup would have been OK. (I put the leftover batter into a 12-cup mini-muffin pan, so now I've got plenty of yummy corn muffins.)

These got rave reviews at my daughter's Kindegarten Thanksgiving Feast.  I wanted to bring muffins that were going to be moist and delicious even though they wouldn't be straight out of the oven.  These delivered!

"Different" is my first impression of the taste from this recipe. I didn't have creamed corn so I pureed a can of regular corn in its liquid. Instead of muffins, I cooked in a loaf pan. I doubled the sugar, but there wasn't even a hint of sweetness to the bread. It was very "cornmeal-y" tasting. Not bad, but just not a lot of flavor and a lot of texture from the cornmeal. If I made it again I would add a lot more sugar to at least get a more predominant flavor going, and not just texture. With a whole lot of butter, though, it was still good to eat.

An excellent muffin recipe!  I really prefer this to the drier, crumbly type of corn bread.  I like sweeter muffins, so I increased the sugar to 4 Tablespoons (1/4 cup).  Also, regarding the saltiness, I think the recipe may have intended for unsalted butter to be used.  I found that with salted butter, 1 tsp is all that is needed, but with unsalted butter, 1 1/2 tsp is better.  Finally, I think it would be good to add a note about how thin the batter is!  I was a bit worried, so I let the batter sit about 10 minutes before baking (like I do when using the Jiffy Corn Mix, as recommended on the box).  It thickened a bit, and the muffins had nice, peaked crowns.  Also, I use stoneware muffin pans (from Pampered Chef) instead of tins, so I didn't preheat the pans, but the muffins still turned out great.  I think preheating the tins would make the crust darker than I prefer... Try this recipe!  It's wonderful, and my children really liked it, too!

Made it with salted butter but added no extra salt. Then I added double the sugar. Followed directions otherwise. The muffins were fluffy and came out well, but they still weren't really THAT sweet and a tad on the "tasteless" side. I probably would add more sugar next time but otherwise a super simple recipe.

They smelled delicious, but they were WAY too salty!!  It was like taking in a teaspoon of salt with each bite.  I think if I would have switched the salt for sugar and just let the baking soda/powder be the salt in the muffins, it would have been better.

I really like my cornbread SAVORY (usually I just omit the sugar in regular recipes). These came out really nice. I made a couple of changes,mostly because I live in Europe and there is no creamed corn. Instead i just used a can of regular corn and heated it up with a bit of milk. I also added some more buttermilk at the end because the batter seemed a bit too dry and I came out with nearly twice the number of muffins planned. Yummy yummy!

Some of the reviewers thought these muffins were too salty.  I tried them out on my family and we all thought they tasted great.  I'm not a big fan of sweet cornbread therefore this hit the spot.  They also stayed very moist into the next day.

Really good.  For a true savory corn muffin, I would omit the sugar (I reduced the salt as recommended by others).  I also used canola oil rather than butter.  Very good.

These are now my go to corn muffins. My wife does not like a lot of sweetness to her muffins. The blue box (while tasty) are just too sweet for her. This is a perfect recipe as it allows you to add as little sugar as you want. I cut the sugar in half and these are absolutely delicious for us both. I also will make a double batch for my daughter and her family. Her picky husband even loves them (same reason as my wife) and the 5 grandkids devour them. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

I just made this to go with peas and cabbage for New Years day. We are accustomed to the sweet Jiffy style cornbread, but are trying to cut a lot of sugar, additives, and carbs out of our diet. I used masa for the corn meal, subbed cassava flour (gluten free root flour) for the AP flour, and omitted the sugar altogether. I was worried about the flour conversion ratio, but it worked for me. These muffins hit the spot! The creamed corn gives it the sweetness I like in cornbread without all the sugar. My picky kids asked for thirds! I will definitely be making this again.

This is a very good cornbread recipe and easy to put together.  I used my own cream corn that was left over from a meal the day before.  I pretty well followed the recipe except that I decreased the salt very slightly, increased the sugar very slightly and added a small can of diced chilies.  If I have cream corn on hand I would use this recipe again without hesitation.  They reheat very nicely.  Thank you to the poster.

I did think these had a great corn flavor, and were dense and moist (though not overly so), with crisp edges. They came out of the muffin pan effortlessly. I didn't realize I had no fine cornmeal on hand, but made with corn grits (polenta), which lent to a nice, chewy texture. Will make again, using unsalted butter or less salt added; as I agree with others that they were a little saltier than I prefer.

Made these tonight.  Followed the recipe to a T.  Used all brand new, brand name ingredients. 

Yuck.  I can't taste the corn, and they are leaving a bad aftertaste in my mouth.  Waste of good ingredients, and worse, I'm supposed to take to a friend's house for dinner.  She's going to think I can't cook.

Good recipe and tasted great. After reviewing the comments of others, I followed it as written, but I reduced the salt to 1/2 tsp and used salted butter. There was enough batter to fill each muffin cup to their brim, but each rose nicely and kept their form. 15 minutes was the right amount of time to ensure the centers baked completely. I would definitely make these again.

Heavy but moist corn muffins. However, they left my taste buds craving the sweetness of country cornbread. I will make then again and add 1/4 cup sugar as others have suggested. Hopefully that will satisfy my desire for a sweet corn muffin. This recipe yielded 12 regular size muffins but I had extra batter so I made 12 mini muffins.

This recipe didn't cut it for me. I prefer cornbread that is somewhat sweet.   I was able to put chili over it in a bowl and that worked. I wouldn't make it again

This is superb! You can taste the corn so well. But as i have read comments, the only thing i did is put 1cup sugar instead of 1tbsp. Turned out perfect, fine balance of flavor. It yields 24 regular size muffin.

Really easy, light and fluffy.  Used 1 cup of cake flour instead of all purpose.  Dumped 30 seconds melted butter (instead of wholly melted). Also, instead of slow mixing wet and dry, but dry in bowl first then dumped all wet in and still came out great!  Recommended.  Creamed corn kept the muffins very, very moist but not like cake... still muffiny.

My husband loved these muffins! I did tweak the recipe a bit. I used 1 tbsp of black strap molasses instead of sugar,  1/2 tsp of salt instead of 1 1/2 and almond milk to replace the buttermilk. The muffins came out moist and delicious. The molasses only made them a tad bit darker than the picture you posted. I will definitely make these again.

I just made these and have to agree with many of the reviews. They are very salty!  I also doubled the amount of sugar and it still wasn't enough to take the edge off, or give any sweetness at all (though, it probably wasn't intended to be sweet anyway).  However, they are a pretty muffin with a good texture, so there are good things about it.  I will make again, though add more sugar and probably very little salt, if any.  The salt really takes over these muffins.

Never having tried corn muffins these sounded like something that would be worth the effort. I used the salted butter instead of unsalted and I used all the salt (1 1/2 tsp) I served it with chili.  I noticed no overbearing saltiness in the muffins. I love the idea of the creamed corn in the muffin.  Our friend said they were good.  I might try them again adding the jalepenos and cheese next time.  I did over mix them I'm afraid but not sure if it changed anything. They fell apart as we ate them but maybe they all do that anyway.  I would only eat these and not bother with corn muffins without the creamed corn.  I like the bits of corn in the muffins. I don't want it to taste like a cupcake so I wouldn't add more sugar. I would think the idea is to add salt and sugar to enhance the corn flavor not make it salty nor sweet. Everything is too sweet these days. I like flavor more than sweet. If our friend wants them the next time he comes over - I'll make them. Maybe adding crumbled bacon to the batter might be nice.

I was looking for a corn muffin that used creamed corn and found this one.  After reading some of the reviews I reduced the salt and I must say the result was wonderful. My husband and I really enjoyed them.

Pam's recipes are always good and I was looking for a recipe to serve with barbecued pork. It is definately savory and delicious, but I was looking for a little sweeter so I added 2/3 c. sugar. No other change except putting the batter into mini muffin cups and baking for 10 min. Whipped up some honey butter to serve with, so delicious.

I guess i was expecting it to be sweeter, came out good, used 2 insulated layer cake pans and they were moist.  To make them a little sweeter, I warmed up some maple syrup and butter and then they were very good! p.s. in the recipe i added one extra pat of butter.

This was perfect- exactly what I was looking for. I added a little more buttermilk, and cooked it in a bread pan rather than cupcake pans.

This recipe was bland and flavorless. I'm sorry, I followed the directions exactly except for baking in a pan instead of in muffin tins, and it just didn't do it for my husband and I.

Made a double recipe of muffins, but mistakenly added only 3/4 cup of oil instead of doubling. Thought I goofed,however, the muffins came out beautifully.  Maybe the recipe should read 3/8C. oil.

These were not as sweet or as moist as I had hoped for.
