This is fabulous ~ I used this recipe to top on my shrimp burgers ~ which I get requests for all the time .....  I will definitely make this again.. I added extra lime juice, a 1/4 teaspoon of ground cumin, 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon.  I did not spray the pineapple just the grill itself.  Try this you will love it... did I mention that I don't even like pineapple?

Wow.  I doubled this recipe but halved the cinnamon (to 1/2 tsp because cinnamon is strong).  I served this salsa with a marinated pork tenderloin from this site tonight and will serve the rest with chicken tomorrow night.  It would be excellent with *any* other kind of fish you could think of like salmon, tuna, mahi-mahi, shark...  You could literally eat this salsa by itself, its that good.  Yum!

WOW!  I love, love, love this salsa.  I have not made it myself but tasted it at a potluck.  I immediately sought out the person who brought this to get the recipe.  She found it here & I have saved it.  Will be making my own soon.  I noticed that her salsa did not last long & almost no one got seconds it was so popular.

Wonderful!  In my opinion, perfect for fish!  I cut back a bit on the peppers.  What's better than grilled pineapple?  Some of the best salsa for summertime.

Really great on grilled chicken and fish. It was also good on tacos and salad. I ate it with chips, too. All around good with a nice kick from the jalapeno.

Great topping for our grilled chicken. I used an orange bell instead of the red, since that is what I had on hand. I think it would be really good if the bell pepper and onion were also grilled a bit, might try that next time.

I don't like to use cooking spray,instead I used olive oil. Substitute local honey for sugar . Left out jalapeno pepper. Prepared with Chinese Barbecue Char Siu pork, the taste of Hawaii and brown rice

Delicious and I had to modify since I had no cilantro.  I had lemon thyme growing outside so I used that and a little orange juice which was an idea from another recipe.  Also had to saute the pineapple since I had already cut the pineapple into chunks.  Great flavor!

This was a really good pineapple salsa! The salsa truly complimented our pork tacos tonight (used Chef John's Yucatan-Style Grilled Pork). The only change I would make next time is to reduce or omit the sugar, but that's dependent on the pineapple you have. Ours was more on the sweet side and therefore the addition of the sugar made the salsa seem a little too sweet for us, but still a super good blend of all components in this salsa. I can definitely see this salsa going well with chicken and fish. Looking forward to making this again! Thanks for the amazing recipe!

I didn't take the time to grill the pineapple, but this was great! I let it marinate for the hour and it was even better the next day. I used it to top my sweet potato rice bowl. Next day I put it on mexican pizza and used it with tortilla chips as well. Will make again. Great flavors!
