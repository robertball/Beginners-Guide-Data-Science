I was looking for a way too use up raspberry preserves & this is a bonus, using pickle juice I would've normally just dumped down the drain! This recipe was a little out of my comfort zone so I'm having a difficult time reviewing it:) It was good-you can definately taste the raspberry, but it's not over-powering. It was pretty spicy-not belly-burning spicy but lips burning kinda spicy. Might want to tone down the spice if kids will be eating it! Also, it makes a ton! I halved the recipe & made 6 huge country style ribs & ended up w/about 2 cups of sauce leftover! Probably won't make it again but it was fun to try!! Thank you!

Wonderful recipe!  I preserve this by canning in 1/2 pint jars.  A family favorite and great for gift giving!  We use it for BBQ sauce and/or dipping bbq'd or baked beef, ribs, pork, fish, or chicken.   Our grown kids wait for the next batch...I'm on my 3rd time around!
BTW, it's also good over cream cheese and eaten w/crackers,tortilla chips and/or sliced fruits like pears.  Beautiful color.  I kept true to the recipe flavors, but used 2 TB finely diced fresh onion instead of dried, and added 2 TB balsamic to the required vinegar for a darker appearance.  If you are canning, don't reduce the acid called for...pickle jc./vinegar, etc., as it's necessary for safe canning.
Love the stuff! Thank you A.K. for this amazing recipe!

This was amazing.  I've made it twice now Once with apple vinegar and caper juice and this last time with red wine vinegar and gherkin juice.  This time a winner!  Perfect blend of all flavors you look for in a bbq sauce.  Amazing on pork!

I've never made barbecue sauce before but from now on I think I'll make some to have on hand. I think I might try making it with different preserves too to see if I can get maybe a blueberry, blackberry, strawberry or even fig flavor. We'll see what works. After the sauce was done I turned the heat back up to medium-high. I threw in six chicken breasts with salt and pepper on them and boiled those for about 20 minutes or so then I pulled them out, shredded them and threw them back in. I turned the heat down to low and simmered them another 10 minutes. I served the chicken on a grilled bun. Topped it with Swiss cheese, a dill pickle, homemade onion rings and some lightly dressed (non-mayonnaise) apple-cabbage coleslaw. Best barbecue chicken sandwich I've ever had.

I used fresh garlic and added some cayenne pepper for an extra kick. Delish!

I hate to be a negative Nelly but I was terribly disappointed. The pickle juice is ridiculous. I have no idea what anyone would be trying to accomplish with this addition. I spent the whole time preparing it trying to figure out how to get rid of the pickle smell. It didn't taste like raspberry and the whole thingwas far too sweet.

Pretty boss recipe. Great way to get rid of some pickle juice, made it just tangy enough. Thought raspberry would make it to tart for my taste so I used plum instead
