All I can say is EXCELLENT! It doesn't get any better than this and I followed the recipe to the letter. I must agree with another reviewer to make sure you use true maple syrup-no Mrs. Butterworth's here:). I agree with the submitter to dredge in flour and sear in hot oil to keep in those juices as an important step, not to be omitted. This is great in the oven--don't know that doing this in the crock pot would have the same effect. A lot of reviewers modify the recipe from the original submitter and then rate it upon their modifications rather than using the original and review on that and then try it again with their suggestions and rate it and note that in their review so people can gauge what they have done and give a more accurate review on the original submission. This recipe was excellent, I will use it again for company and for family. I couldn't stop eating it. It was that good by the originator. The only comment I would make is that I may make a little less sauce due to the expense of the maple syrup and I feel halfing the original ingredients would provide a sufficient amount.

I just made this for 9 people up for the weekend. They all raved about it and ate it all. Here are my changes: I used 2 pork tenderloins (4 small), doubled the ingredients, used Sweet Baby Ray's bbq sauce instead of ketchup,6 cloves of garlic and didn't brown it first. I put it in a pan and covered it and baked it for 2 hours and the last 1/2 hr I took off the cover. It was melt in your mouth tender. It was wonderful with apple-stuffed acorn squashes and a salad.

I'm made this several times because my 5yr old calls it his favorite piggy meat, but I did not like the liquid that this version makes. I do mine in the crock pot and vary the time depending on how much/what form of pork I use. The key to making this really work is the sauce. I use a bit more garlic and when the pork is done I strain the sauce and cook on the stove top until thickened. I will try BBQ sauce in place of ketchup next time to see which is better! BTW, I like this with sweet potatoes.

I fixed this recipe this evening for company and it was a smash hit.  I will definitely be fixing this again.  Saw some other recipes that looked good but so many needed to marinate and I didn't have time for that.  I am a late planner, and usually don't prepare enough ahead of time to marinate anything.  My company asked for the recipe and all were eating seconds.  The sauce was delicious on the roasted potatoes I cooked on the side of the loin.

Made this for dinner last night.  It was quite good.  Tender and moist.  Followed the recipe exactly.  Took another reviewers suggestion and put the sauce in a pan to thicken before serving.  It really does make a lot of suace.  Could probably cut back on the sauce ingredients next time.

I cooked this is the oven on a baking sheet with the roast covered in foil for 1 1/2 hrs, I uncovered it and cooked it for another 30 minutes.  The whole house smelled like pancakes with maple syrup.  My husband loved it

This really did not turn out how I imagined... There was far too much ketchup in this reciepe, next time I think I would use 1/3 of a cup only. I also thought that the exterior of the loin would be a little more crisp & the interior was not as tender as I predicted after following the directions & taking some advice from some of the other reviews I think that I might try this down the road.... not right away- was not fabulous

This Recipe is great just the way it is. The first time I made it i substituted barbecue sauce it was good but not as good as the original recipe. The second time i made it was just per the recipe and it is soo much better. Guess the moral of the story is don't mess with a great recipe.

Janet P.  Girrrlll, this was, as described; a pork loin so moist and tender we really had to wait to cut it into slices to serve.  No one asked for a knife to cut the meat; it was that tender.  I followed the pan searing suggestion you gave and although I did not have garlic I subbed a dash of garlic powder and added a dash of Texas Pete (like Frank's Louisiana Hot Sauce).  No other changes were made.  My 3 GK's (15, 11 and 8) all asked for seconds and the 8 yo helped me clean up the kitchen and said, "Gma, let's share another piece of meat", which we proceeded to do with a little extra sauce poured over.  The sauce is  delightfully different, and only slightly sweet even though it contains the maple syrup, it simply is not overly sweet.  Super easy, super delicious and I look forward to doing this again!  Many thanks for a welcome addition to my weeknight or Sunday dinner menu!!

This is one of best roast pork loins I think I've ever had.  It has a nice, tangy flavor and you can't really distinguish the maple flavor, but make no mistake, it's very flavorful!  It's a quick, easy recipe and it makes for a very impressive meal.  The end result is a very juicy pork loin with a rich, tangy sauce.  This one will not disappoint.

I usually stay away from a pork roast or chops unless they're slow cooked and shredded.  Pork is usually a very dry meat to me.  Anyway, this recipe was easy and best of all, created a very moist, juicy and favorable meal.  My advice on making this dish.
1) When it says a large piece of foil, it should be HUGE.  My 4 lb roast could barely fit in a normal large sheet of aluminum foil, even if you tear a very long piece.  Opening it at the end, like the recipe suggested, all of the juices ran out so make sure you put it on a rimmed baking sheet.
2) I followed the recipe. It makes a lot of sauce and I didn't want to serve the raw garlic sauce with the finished product.  Make sure and capture those run off juices and pour over the meat once sliced.  Other reviewers suggest cooking the left over sauce.  That's probably a good idea if you want to use it, otherwise, I think the juices the roast cooks with is plenty.  You can always decide once the roast is done.
3) Make sure you let the meat rest for a bit before slicing to keep all the juices from running out.
Everyone liked this recipe and I'll make this again.

Extremely delicious!!  My only piece of advice would be to spray the aluminum foil with Pam before putting the meat and sauce on it.  Other than that-- yum!  You can get the same "taste" but not the "texture" if you put this in the crockpot.  I'm not a really big fan of ketchup, so next time I will back off to about 1/2 cup or possibly 1/3 cup.

This was delicious. It was sort of barbecuey flavored but very  mildly so. I seasoned this with low sodium Season all instead of salt and used fresh ground pepper. I didn't have real maple syrup so I made do with a standard pancake maple flavored syrup. I used a tenderloin of which there were 2 pieces and baked them both together in the foil packet. I didn't save any sauce back, I cooked them in the whole amount and just spooned it from the dish after baking. The meat was very tender and fell apart when I tried to slice it. Hubby raved and is looking forward to the leftovers. Thanks Janet for a hubby pleasing meal!

I used this on a pork shoulder. Fabulous. Did make an addition- added a dash of ginger to the salt/pepper/flour dredge as it goes so nicely with the maple/ketchup base. I added NO water to the sauce, used a bit less of the sauce since the meat loses a lot of it's own moisture anyway. At the end I made more gravy by adding the water with a bit of cornstarch. Very tasty, happy kids and husband. I'll definitely make this a LOT- easy to prep, easy to cook, can be prepped in the am and set on a timer so it's ready at the end of the work day, and really great for a bigger crowd. Thanks for sharing!

LOVED this recipe! I took someone elses suggestion and used a tenderloin and it came out so moist. Additionally, I used half ketchup and half Sweet Baby Rays (had some I needed to use up). It gave it that little extra kick. I didn't brown, I baked covered in the oven for an hour and then uncovered the last half hour. Fabulous!

This was SUPERB! I used pork chops instead of the roast and just cut out the bones prior to cooking. This cut back the cooking time, plus, the pork had soooo much flavour. YUMMY! I don't even like pork, and I loved this. It tasted very much like sweet and sour chicken.. There were no leftovers! Thanks for the recipe

Great recipe!  When reading the ingredients, I thought it might be too much flavor at once.  But I heeded your advice and didn't let them scare me away from trying it.  So glad I did!  Very tasty and tender!  I did divide everything in half since there is only three people in my family.  I used a 2 pound boneless pork ribeye roast and cooked it for about 80 minutes.  It turned out great!  The leftovers will make great pulled barbeque pork sandwiches also!

Wow- just made this for the first time and it was great!  My roast was only 3 pounds, and I let it cook for about an hour and a half.  It was cooked perfectly, and the sauce had great flavor (I cooked down the rest to more of a glaze.)  My husband said it's one of the best things I've ever made!

So easy!  Did a 2 lb. roast in an hour and it was tender and, with all that maple syrup, finger-licking sweet.  I reduced the cooking sauce to thicken it and added a little red wine.
Paired with a sweet potato and a green salad it made for a great, simple to fix meal.  Sandwiches tomorrow!

Fabulous and oh so easy! I did add some chipotle hot sauce and some chili oil which complimented the sweet nicely. I should think this will also do well with a little vinegar added. I only cook my beef/pork roasts/ribs/racks etc tightly fitted in a foil packet as this recipe suggests...it always turns out fabulous.

Wonderful, a great surprise - not the usually dry pork meat I was afraid of. Made it for the holidays and everyone loved it.

My boyfriend and I enjoyed the flavor very  much, however, the cooking time was far too long. Next time I plan on cooking the roast for closer to an hour and fifteen minutes or so. I also suggest staring with half the amount of sauce and making more if necessary. It's very easy to make more and seeing as maple syrup isn't the cheapest of ingredients it's something I plan on doing next time, and there definitely will be a next time. Sweet potatoes paired very nicely.

I have made this a few times for my family and every time it turns out excellent.  My kids LOVE LOVE LOVE this.  It really is nice to make something they want to eat!  They didn't just eat seconds, but thirds and fourths!  I had to cut them off!  I followed the recipe exactly except for the first time I forgot to dredge the pork before searing, and it still came out excellent. I used real maple syrup and a lot of garlic!  It's funny how these odd ingredients come together to make such an awesome sauce. This is one that is going in my permanent recipe file!  

By the way, I have no idea what this recipe tastes like as "left overs" since it was completely finished at the dinner table!

As other reviews stated, I will probably never go back to the way I used to cook pork roast. This turned out so tender and moist. I put half of the sauce in the pan I seared the roast in and cooked it down until it thickened. Delicious!

This was a great way to cook a Pork Roast.  I used a center cut roast and added a little more garlic than mentioned.  I also only used 1/2C Ketchup and 1/2C Maple Syrup with a 1/4C Water; only because I didn't have 3/4C of Ketchup.  It was delicious, and my family loved it!  The leftovers were even better because they soaked in it, and I will probably marinate overnight next time, not that I need to because this was a very flavorful dish.

I made this recipe last night for my family and the 85 year old woman I take care of and it was a huge hit. I found the preperation and cooking to be simple and not at all time consuming which for me, works out very well. I also, substituted sugar-free maple sryup for regular, as the woman I take care of is Diabetic. It tasted wonderful and I will be making this again real soon.

I've made several pork loin recipes in the past and this was, by far, the best!  I cooked it in my slow cooker, on low, for 11 hours.  My husband really liked it, too.  This will definitely be a "go to" recipe for us in the future!

Excellent! This made a moist, flavorful roast. Normally when I cook a lean roast, it turns out dry. Not with this recipe!   Thanks for sharing Janet!

This tasted like sweet and sour.  I thought my kids would like this better than they did.  It was an interesting combination for pork.  I may try grilling it next time and baste the sauce.

Awesome Recipe..Thank you.
Was Craving flavor of spices and was afraid that it might be too sweet 

Added approximately 1/2tsp to 1 tbsp 
Sweet basil,
Orange peel,
Paprika,
Red peppers crushed,
Rosemary,
Thyme, and  
flour mixed and seared as instructed with olive oil. 
For the sauce used ketchup and hungry jack syrup (it's what was on hand).   Added a bit more crushed red pepper, 2 tbsp of garlic and 1 tsp of prepared horseradish mix well!
I used a oven bag on this pork loin.  
It was incredibly  flavorful with no hint of hotness...However moist and tender but not falling apart..   

Baked at 350 until temp reached 140 turned off oven and let sit lost track of time placed in.   Next time will wrap in foil and bake as directed and set timer!   I loved it. 
Not too spicy and incredible flavor!   (Mamma would be proud.)

Very tasty and tender! The quantity of sauce can be reduced, but there is no taking away from the delicious flavor. I rated this based on the recipe without modifying it. Have recently added 1 tbs dried mustard... Ideas are endless with this recipe! Try strips of bacon on top of the pork for another added flavor.

Pork roasts have always seemed a bit dry, but not in this case. The best tasting and juiciest I have ever had and I didn't even broil it at the end. This may be the only way I cook a pork roast from now on. I am going to experiment with a well marbled beef roast using the same tenting system and various marinades.

I loved this recipe and I'm not crazy about pork until I tried this. I was looking for a change from beef and chicken and wanted to give pork another try. My lucky day when I found this recipe.

I wasn't sure my husband and guests would prefer my traditional pork roast or try a new recipe, so I prepared both recipes on separate roasts.  The maple baked roast was the big hit.  I didn't put all the sauce over the roast while it was baking because I was afraid it would be too sweet for my husband's taste, but now I know to use it all because everyone was scraping off the sauce!  Wonderful recipe!

Easy to make.  The pork was very tender and the whole family loved it.   We will make it again but maybe increase the garlic and double the sauce.  There is plenty of sauce to cover the pork but I think everyone would have liked to have some on the side to dip.

I used 4 single boneless pork chops.  They were absolutely delicious.  I too was a little put off by the ingredients but decided to try anyway and I am glad I did!  Pork was juicy & tender. Definetly a keeper!  Thx for sharing!!!

This was ok. We marinated it for 6 hours and the taste just didnt' seem to soak in. The meat wasn't fall apart tender. It certainly required a serrated knife. The taste of the extra sauce that we did put on it was ok. Nothing special. Not sure that I would make this again.

Awesome!!! I thought at first it was going to be too sweet but to my surprise it was delicously tangy!! This is the best recipe for pork loin I have found yet!!! I did not cover mine, instead I pulled the foil up on all sides, rolled the egdes down, and made a pan with the top open. I used enough of the glaze to cover the roast and cooked it only 1 hour and 15 minutes. It was perfect!!

i feel i wasted a good 15.00 pork loin. didnt taste good to me. my husband is pretty easy to please he brought it back and my kids wouldnt touch it. ive washed it off, poured bbq sauce on it and put it in the oven to hopefully mask the taste.if your on a budget i dont suggest you try this recipe. especially with a 4lb. pork loin.

I made this exact recipe to serve for Christmas dinner and it was wonderful.  Tonight I used the sauce recipe, halved, for two one inch thick pork chops.  I dredged them lightly in flour, browned both sides, formed the packet, poured the sauce over, and baked them for 55 minutes at 350, then peeled back the aluminum foil and broiled for five minutes.  They were incredibly tender and flavorful; a perfect meal for two.

Absolutely loved this recipe!  I prepared it exactly as written and wouldn't change a thing.  Pork loin roasts were on sale at my supermarket this week and I fed three adults and one ten year old for less than $10.00 plus everyone enjoyed seconds.  I also had a hard time to stop nippling as I was slicing the roast.  Delicious!  I'd give it more stars if I could

Great recipe, the meat was moist and tender.  The sauce is not too sweet- used real maple syrup and followed recipe except broiling. Next time will broil to get a nice crust.   A good recipe for company.

Couldn't be easier!  We really liked this. I made it exactly as written. Next time I will increase the maple slightly. I served it with honey glazed steamed carrots, homemade applesauce and mashed potatoes. Delish!

This recipe is delicious.  My family loved it and it will become a standard at our house.  My grandchildren (who do not like pork roast) asked for seconds.

Delicious!  I made it as directed, except that I didn't have any maple syrup.  So, after looking at the Apricot Pork Tenderloin recipe on this site, I substituted 3/4 cup (one 10 oz. jar) apricot preserves for the maple syrup, and added 2 teaspoons of thyme.  Wonderfully tender and flavorful, nicely caramelized on top.  Looking forward to trying it with the maple next time!

I made this for Christmas Day dinner. It was fabulous! Had all of the ingredients on hand, had to cut the 9# pork loin in half to fit in 2 gallon size ziplock freezer bags. But it was just fine. Easy clean up. Cooked for 2 hours at 350 degrees. About 145 interior temp. Will do again for sure.

This was fantastic!  With the weather getting colder, we didnt want to grill out our Pork Tenderloin.   Found this recipe and LOVE IT.   I threw in a few small sliced potatoes and they were awesome as well.   I might make this for 
Christmas, its THAT GOOD!!

The loin was extremely tender! I only had a 2lb loin, I thought I may have overcooked it. But it was awesome. I halved the sauce and felt there was still plenty. I thought the flavor was decent but needed something. A good base to work off of.

Not sure why the bad ratings, this is quite delicious and the meat was incredibly tender.   After reading the reviews, I made a couple of small changes as suggested by others.  I cut down on the ketchup to 1/3 cup and added 1/3 cup BBQ sauce.  My roast was almost 4 lbs, so cooked for 1.5 hours tented in foil, and 20 minutes uncovered, then a quick 5 under the broiler to crisp.  Temp was higher than it needed at end, 165, but still very moist and tender.  I did not reserve any sauce, simply boiled after to thicken.   Thank you for the recipe, everyone in the family had seconds, even my 6 year old and 2 year old!

My boys raved over this the whole night. and they rarely make comments. Hubby had to force himself to stop eating it so he could have leftovers to make  pulled pork sandwiches tomorrow. Made as written except after searing the meat, threw it in a crockpot for about 7 hours on low.

My better half couldn't stop saying how much he liked it. In fact he liked it so much he ate to much. Recipe was super easy too. I had never "dredged or seared" either. 
Thank you for making his evening.

Amazing! I did use cheaper syrup but after searing, I wrapped the loin with bacon. The bacon crisped up under the broiler, and I flipped the loins and broiled the bottom too. I cooked the extra sauce to thicken. I'll make this again for sure!

Made this recipe the other night, like everyone else suggested I made less sauce, but I think that the extra sauce would have been great, as you can put it over the meat after it is plated.  The one thing I would suggest though would be to lower the temp and cook it for a LOT longer so that the proteins would break down better and the meat be more tender.  I am rating this recipe with 5 stars because my family and I absolutely loved the flavor, even my picky teenage boys and 6 yr old son!  Will definitely make this again.

I made this exactly as it was written, which is rare for me.  I added a few seasonings to the flour before I browned the pork loin and reduced the sauce to use over the meat.  Other than that, I followed the directions to a 't'.  What a great meal! I served slices of meat over mashed butternut squash and drizzled the sauce over both--so easy and so tasty!

This was decent, but nothing not quite what I was expecting. For one, the cooking timeframe is completely off (at least it was for me...). My pork roast was just under 4 lbs., and admittedly it *should* not take two hours to cook thru, but even so, it was done in less than an hour! Having said this, I chose to cook my pork to an internal temperature of 160 degrees Fahrenheit (but that just means it would have tested done on the lesser end of the suggested timeframe). Well-done pork should be cooked to a temperature of 170 degrees, but my husband and I never do. In fact, according to the USDA, pork can now be cooked to an internal temperature of a mere 145 degrees (medium rare) and still be considered safe to eat. Medium rare pork is too pink for my liking but well-done pork is not the answer. My second issue with was with the sauce. It was just too tangy / tomato-ey. I could barely detect any maple flavor which was kinda misleading given the recipe title. I would definitely cut back on the ketchup next time, at least by a quarter cup if not by half. I'd also cut the garlic in half. The cooking method for this is GENIUS and the fact that this is SUPER easy to prepare and (in my case) takes minimal time to cook has me hooked. I will for sure make this again, but will make several adjustments before doing so. Mashed potatoes, coleslaw and Hawaiian rolls rounded out our simple meal. Thanks for sharing your idea, Janet! :-)

update- the second time around went with the recipe as written. still didn't fall apart like the reviews said, but my picky husband was even willing to eat the leftovers. Sounds weird, ketchup maple syrup, and garlic, but following the recipe to the letter was waaaaaaaaaay better than subbing bbq sauce. Doing this again tonight, going to try to cook it longer and see what happens....

This was wonderful!  I cooked on the Barbecue rather than in the oven. Followed other reviewers suggestions and cut down the amount of ketchup (may cut a little more next time). I left the roast in the foil packet, on the baking sheet on indirect heat at 350.  At the end, I took it out of the foil and put directly over the grill, a few minutes each side to crisp it up.  Boiled down the remaining sauce and spooned it over the sliced meat before serving. Mmmmmm

After reading this recipe, I was scared to try it because I am too cheap to buy real maple syrup.  I used Aunt Jamima's Butter-Lite and it worked out just fine.  I used one 2.5 pound pork loin, browned it, and made the sauce as written except I put a dash of Worcestershire and put a little A-1 in with it.  I put it in the crock pot for nine hours and served with mashed potatoes.  Delicious!

I used bbq sauce for this recipe instead of ketchup. The end result was delicious! My family loved it and it turned out nice and moist!

Loved it just as written.  The sauce did not over power the taste of the loin roast but rather complimented it, and added moisture.  Will definitely fix this again!

This was awesome ! The only thing I did, and actually quite on accident, was leave out the water. I found this worked wonderfully ! The flavor was great, and we had plenty of sauce left to enjoy. Otherwise this is perfect just the way it is ! A nice change from the savory flovor I usually make with my pork roasts.

This recipe was very good. I didn't think my husband would like the flavors together but, he asked me to make it again sometime. One change I made was to substitute the ketchup with Hickory flavored BBQ sauce. Outstanding flavor.

This dish was wonderful.  I was skeptical about mixing maple syrup and ketchup, but it gave the sauce a sweet and tangy flavor.  My whole family loved it, even my picky 10 yr. old daughter.  I followed the directions exactly.  I will make this again.

This is a great recipe. Made it for my New Year's Day Meal and my whole family loved it.  And, yes, it was fall-apart tender.  The best part was it was super easy & super fast to put together... I had lots of time for other things.

WOW! YUM!  This was so good. I used BBQ sauce instead of ketchup. I also used a much smaller roast (it's what we had), but I still made the sauce recipe in the quantity shown. I was glad I did. The flavor was incredible and I liked having extra sauce. I do wish i'd had a bigger roast so we could have had more of this delicious roast leftover! One other difference - I baked it in my dutch oven rather than a foil packet. More cleanup, but using my DO gives me more confidence when baking/roasting meats. Thanks for the recipe!

I love this! My kids who are 7 and under, as well as my husband ate it all!!! I did not have any canola oil to use, so I used olive oil instead, which took a couple more minutes to fry. I also did not have any minced or cloves of garlic so I used garlic powder, which takes away from the garlic taste, but it still came out great! The ingredients are an odd mixture, but they make a great flavor. This will absolutely be something I will make again for my family of 5. It is odd to find new reciepes that even the kids love, but this one did it! I think my 7 year old girl ate more then my husband did!

This came out perfect and looked the same as the picture....I made it with boiled Veggies. Potatoes, carrots, onions and cabbage. I had natural applesauce for dipping but you didn't need it. The maple falvor is delightful and melts in your mouth....Pork Loin roast and I added chopped garlic and onions to the glaze as well as garlic cloves throughout the meat. I used olive oil to fry it instead. This came out spectacular and your taste buds will thank you. :) Easy to prepare and I cooked on the bottom rack with foil paper under and over, I also tookthe foil paper off the last 30 mins of cooking. You must have real maple syrup!!

Surprised me!  Easy, tasty, attractive company dish.  I added about 3X the amount of garlic and browned and wrapped the pork in maple mixture about an hour before I put it in the oven.  Served with roast potato, buttered, fresh string beans and spring salad.  Be sure to wrap pork securely otherwise you'll have a baked on, hard to remove mess in your pan.

very yum! I used Sweet baby ray, with just a little ketchup. and I thought I had maple syrup, but I didn't, so used Ms.Butterworth! and it was still delicious! I was quite liberal with the pepper, so that was a little kick. The hubs loved it. will make again.

FABULOUS RECIPE!!  I used 1/2 bbq sauce and 1/2 ketchup, cooked it ahead and froze it.  I took it out  the day before we were going to eat it, defrosted it, reheated it for 30 min. at 350 degrees, then basted it with the sauce and placed it under the broiler for about 5 min.  Served it with the extra sauce for Sunday dinner, and everyone raved about what a moist, delicious pork loin it was.  Thanks for sharing this delicious recipe!!

Excellent recipe.  Next time I won't add any water though, and watch, it browns under the broiler really fast.  Mine never did glaze up, but I think it was just too watery.

I made this recipe with some heavy modifications based on some of the other reviews. Instead of just ketchup, I used 1/2 cup Bulls Eye original BBQ sauce (to give it a smokiness), 2 T of dijon mustard, and then used enough ketchup to bring the BBQ sauce/mustard/ketchup mix to 3/4 cup. I also used real maple syrup, not the fake stuff, and I used the rest of ingredients as suggested. I think browning the meat is necessary, but I don't think it needs the flour, it would do just fine without it. After browning the meat I put it in a crock pot and covered it with ALL of the sauce and cooked it until the internal temp was 170 (about 6 hours for a 2lbs chunk). I removed the meat from the pot and broiled it until nice and crispy on the top. I took the sauce from the crock pot, strained it into a saucepan, and reduced the sauce until my patience wore thin. I wound up adding cornstarch to thicken it (whisk 2 tsp of water with 1 tsp cornstarch, then whisk into the sauce). If you don't like a sweet sauce, this recipe is not for you! This version is like a very sweet BBQ sauce.

I had a 7lb. boneless pork loin roast and I was looking for a different recipe that would "WOW" my family. Boy did I certainly find it!!  This recipe is super easy to make and comes out absolutely wonderful. I read through many of the reviews and made the following changes: did not brown beforehand; since my pork lion was one piece, I cut it in half (each piece than measuring about 12"); I used Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce (as another reader suggested) instead of ketchup and during the last 15 minutes I put it under the broiler to glaze up and basted it the entire time.  My family raved about it over and over!!  Definitely a keeper!

This was good good good. And it fell apart just like the recipe said! It was juicy, and it was delicous. I loved it. My husband and my mom and dad loved it. THank you!. Our roast was super long, and the recipe stated it was best if it came in two pieces, so i sliced that baby in half, gave them each their own foil packet, and it turned out marvelous, definately a keeper!!

I loved the braising and wrapping it in foil.  It was quick and very easy -- also easy to clean up.  So many of the reviewers who hated the catsup scared me so instead of that I used dijon mustard (2 tbs.) and added an equal amt. of brown sugar to the maple syrup. It kind of tasted like a wonderful, tender honey baked ham.

I made this recipe and it turned out great.  I'm not a big fan of pork, but my fiance is so I made this and was surprised at how good it turned out.  I substituted half of the ketchup with a sweet bbq sauce.

This has become my kids favorite meat dish.    It was so moist and meat was as soft as butter. It did not last long.  I used regular maple syrup (not the real stuff) and was all still liked it.

So I’ve made this three times now.  No matter how much I make, there is never leftovers!  I always use my homemade maple syrup.  I use coconut oil instead of canola oil, and I don’t use flour, my kids are gluten free!  Each time I make this it gets better and better.  This time I saved the sauce left in the foil, strained it to get rid of the chunks, then thickened it with cornstarch to make gravy instead of saving some of the sauce initially.  Wow.

This turned out delicious! I used s Dutch oven to brown the meat, poured the sauce over, then put the whole thing in the oven. This a new family favorite!

Only things I did differently was, I used a 1.50 lb pork tenderloin (just me and hubby here),  halved the ingredients for the sauce (did not halve the garlic though)  and cut back on cooking time. I have to admit that I was skeptical with the ingredients (mostly the ketchup) but, HOLY COW!!! What a fantastic blend of flavors!  The pork loin was very moist and tender, and the flavor  was out of this world! Thank you for this recipe!  (I am typing this as my husband is denying me of leftovers to take to work for lunch tomorrow)

I am rating it 5 stars based on my own concoction and not the recipe as-is, for those who are nit-picky about that.  I took suggestions from other reviewers and used barbecue sauce instead of ketchup.  I thought it would miss some vinegar to cut the syrup so I also added a little mustard.  As an afterthought I threw in some cinnamon.  Wow!  I also didn't want to worry about basting and watching it so I threw it in the crockpot early in the day and cooked it on high for about 6 hours.  Not only did it taste fantastic but it was soft enough to shred!  I had never had a pork loin do that before (unlike shoulder or pork butt, which shred easily) and was pleasantly surprised.  I used the leftovers for burritos the next day.  I will definitely make this again.

I followed the recipe as written.  Not bad, but not wonderful either.  The meat was moist and tender.  The taste was not outstanding.  This is the first time in many years that the rating numbers disappointed me.  Overall rating from my family was "alright".

I used a few suggestions of other reviewers and cut down the amount of ketchup to 1/3 cup, also I used pork chops since that was what I had on hand.  My family loved it! It tastes a lot like sweet and sour pork, so we might try this with chicken next time! Super quick and easy too!

This was a big, big hit with my family. My daughter can be a picky eater and yet full of surprises. She, my boyfriend, and I loved this recipe. This was my first time making a pork loin and it was a success and will be a repeat recipe. I used a loin just a lil over two lbs for the 3 of us and we had plenty of leftovers. Made with garlic mashed potatoes and french cut green beans.

Excellent glaze.  I really liked the taste.  Just be aware there's quite a lot of maple syrup, use less if you don't like it so sweet.

Unsure if it was this recipe or the brand of pork roast we purchased, but I haven't had pork this delicious and juicy in a LONG time.  I omitted the water in the sauce and replaced 1/2 the ketchup with BBQ sauce.  I also only cooked the roast to 155 degrees, it went up to 168 as I let it rest which is way past Health Department standards for food safety.  4 stars because I had to modify the recipe rather than just use it as is.

Sauce is excellent! Cooked it down at end in saucepan. Cooked roast in PC Clay Baker, will try foil next time.  It was moist but didn't exactly fall apart like reviews said.

Great way to cook Pork, I really didn't care for the flavor the recipe, I think I would of much liked it with my own Barbecue sauce.  Very tender way to make pork and I'll be cooking it this way more often. Thanks.

My mother is kind of a picky eater, but I did up this recipe last night and she just loved it. The meat was so moist, had great sweet and tangy flavor to it. It is perfect for the family. Thanks for sharing it. I will definitely be making this again.

Made this tonight for my boyfriend and parents; what a great recipe!  I had to "make do" on a few ingredients (didn't have enough maple syrup- so I added honey & brown sugar).  I also added onion slices in the bag.  I am a novice cook- and this recipe was simple enough for me to do well- but challenging enough to keep me interested in trying something else again soon!  Very tender and flavorful!

I really wanted to like this...it had such great reviews.  It was very tender but just too sweet for us. My husband really thought it was just a hormel prepackaged pork loin!  Far too much trouble for that!

Fabulous!!!!  Made it just like it was written and used an off brand of maple syrup!  I served this with roasted rosemary pots, and a tossed salad that I sliced grapes in.  My husband loved it!  Thanks for a great recipe!!!

Great--I had real maple syrup and maybe that was a determining factor--but family loved it and it was easy to do.  As long as I can access real maple syrup (Canadian is the best) at an affordable price (it is a luxury item) I will continue to make this recipe.

This was great for adding flavor to a pork loin which tend to be a bit boring.  I only made a couple of changes.  I used the only maple flavored syrup I had in the house which was Aunt Jemima and substituted the ketchup with bbq sauce.  Since my pork loin was only 2 lbs, I reduced to 1/3 syrup, 1/3 bbq sauce and a splash of water.  In total it was a scant cup of liquid.  Cooked it in the foil package for 2 hrs. Yum. Will make again.

Tender and moist, and the sauce was surprisingly good.  I prefer the sauce a tad thicker and more potent, so I reduced it a tad while the roast rested.

This is one of my family's favorite Pork recipes! The prep time is minimal, so it's a big hit all the way around. I keep some of the sauce out and use it as a dipping sauce; I serve it over rice with green beans or some other green and every time I make it everyone just raves! This is always a huge hit and has become one of my go-to recipes.

This was not what I expected.  I was thinking it would have more a maple flavor then a sweet and sour flavor.

I used 2:1 bbq sauce : ketchup instead up straight ketchup. I had to cook the roast much longer than suggested but it came out wonderful! the bottom of the roast that sat in the juices was so tender - great for pulled pork sandwich leftovers :)

I made this for guests visiting for Christmas Eve.  I was a little nervous about the ingredients, but read the reviews and thought I'd give it a try.  I was so happy I did! EVERYONE loved it (even the kids ranging from age 4-13) and it was the most tender pork I ever made!  I used two smaller pork tenderloins and instead of browning beforehand, just "tented" the foil around them and let them go.  Absolutely awesome!  I made them with a sweet potatoes and pears recipe, also on this site, and my husband couldn't say enough...and he never compliments my cooking!  Make this and you won't be sorry!

This dish had a sweet and juicy taste to it. It was a nice new year’s dish. I think next time I’m going to add a bit more garlic. We loved it.

"WOW" This was the best thing I've made all week! My wife and two boys loved it. I loved the simple prep and the end result was wounderful. I only changed the amounts of the katsup and the maple. I reduced the katsup to 2/3 cup and the maple to 1 cup. This is one of those must try meals!

So yummy!  I also used 1/2 ketchup and 1/2 maple syrup.  My sauce never really thickened, but it was delicious anyway.

I must say the ketchup/Maple syrup sounded bad but we mixed a small amount and tasted it...I was surprised at the wonderful flavor. I followed the recipe exactly, with a couple minor changes. I substituted the foil for a cooking bag and at 150 degrees I peeled back the bag and low broiled it for about 1/2 hour or until 155 degrees. I removed it from the oven and covered it in foil and let it rest for about 1/2hr. It was fabulous, it literally melted in your mouth, very juicy and the sauce was excellent, sweet, slightly spicy, a bit tangy...a must try for all!

I often found the maple flavour lost in recipes calling for maple syrup, but this recipe was absolutely fantastic. The pork was tender and tasty, and the maple flavour was just perfect!

Super good taste and tenderness.  I think I will use less sauce when I make it again.  Also, be prepared for a mess when you broil it!

This was disgusting.  Think about it: ketchup and maple syrup together.  I should have known better from the start but I tried it anyway.  I almost shed a tear thinking of the money I wasted on a good pork loin.  Oh well, live and learn.

Let me start by saying I forgot to coat the roast in flour because I was in a hurry.But everything turned out great.When I make this again(which I will) I will not forget that step.My husband was really surprised what the sauce was made with but he said it was different but good.I`ll probably give it 5 stars next time I make this.

THIS IS A SIMPLE, QUICK, EASY CLEAN UP RECIPE. IT IS MELT IN YOUR MOUTH GOOD.  I SERVED IT TO A GROUP OF FRIENDS, WITH SOME CHILDREN WHO ARE PICKY EATERS, THEY ALL LOVED IT.  THE KIDS EVEN WENT FOR SECONDS!! I USED PORK LOIN AND A TURKEY BREAST, BOTH WERE WONDERFUL. CLEAN UP WAS FOLDING UP THE FOIL AND PUTTING IT IN THE TRASH. I DOUBLED THE RECIPE AND THERE WERE ONLY A FEW LEFTOVERS. YOU WILL BE A HIT AT YOUR DINNER WITH THIS GREAT RECIPE!

I do most of the cooking nowadays since I retired due to health, and the wife still works. So, back in 2017, I bought a large pork loin and decided to try this recipe. Well, the wife absolutely loved it but said to cut back just a hair on the Ketchup (or catsup). So I did the next time and it was just as good. When the youngest son traveled across the state and came home to help with a section of the house remodel,  the wife suggested that I fix this for dinner on the second night.  As soon as he bit into it, I knew that he was a big fan of the dish.  He went back for more, then during the evening when one of his friends popped up, the boy shared a piece with him. Now, every time he comes to visit, I've got two of these loins cooking because I know his friends arent' far behind.

Nice, easy recipe with a pleasant but not overpowering flavour. 2.2 lb pork loin roast (1kg). Took a little over an hour at 350 F to cook to 170 F. Tender but not fall apart tender. Moist. Sauce was a little thin. I am looking forward to leftovers. Served with white rice and stir fried veggies - red onion, carrot, red bell pepper, snow peas. I will make this again but will probably make some tweaks next time.

Seriously?  Ketchup, maple syrup, water and garlic?!?!  The author said, "don't be scared".  I was skeptical for sure, but let me tell you, this was fabulous!!!  My whole family loved it and I served it with roasted garlic/cauliflour mash and the gravy on the cauliflour mash was really great!

Made per instructions - It was good, but would use a different sauce next time. Maybe a teriyaki or a sesame ginger.  I didn't get much of a maple flavor out of this and I prize my pure maple syrup.  I cut mine in two, use care when sealing up the foil that these are in. One of mine split open and some of the sauce leaked out, burning onto my baking sheet. Not cool, would line baking sheet with foil or leave a vent hole in my foil next time.

I made the recipe as directed except for using Mrs Butterworths as I had no real maple syrup at the time. It was delicious. The whole family enjoyed it even my mother who is quite picky. The pork was very moist and flavorful !

Followed exactly (I got distracted and forgot to add the garlic), but it was great!!  My husband is a chef, and he loved it!   Made this with asparagus and the "Roasted New Red Potatoes" recipe on this site.  Fabulous meal.  Definitely will make again!

Roast turned out delicious and not dried out which often happens with pork.  I did not dredge the roast in flour to keep the recipe gluten free.  I browned the fat side the longest.

I learned that an exact cooking time is essential to have this roast turn out well. And a meat thermometer as well. We started with a 2.64 pound pork loin, and baked it for 65 minutes, at 350.  This turned out at least 10 minutes too long. The glaze, however was stellar!

Tried this recipe today and it was a success! VERY tender and moist. I've made pork roasts in the crock pot for years and didn't have time to throw it in this morning so I tried this recipe. It was so easy I may just do it this way from now on.The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I don't think I would like the ketchup in the sauce. I made mine with some mustard and honey in the maple syrup as well as a shake of thyme and rosemary. Delicious!

This was very tender and so easy. Only "complaint" is I could not really taste the maple. But totally will make this again.

Surprising!  Simple, tasty, tender and no mess.  I wrapped it tightly with foil so it literally simmered in the sauce.  Definitely cook down the drippings to make a "gravy".   Yum!

This is lucious.. Very tender & moist.. My husband really raved over it too!!  He's always my ''guinea pig'' for new recipes.. So far, he loves everything I make.. I made NO CHANGES to it, it's perfect as is...The combination of Maple Syrup & Ketchup sounds ''weird'' but once it's done, the flavor is FANTASTIC!!  There's virtually NO MESS either...love cooking it in a foil packet!!

I used 2 pork tenderloins (4 pieces) that totaled about 5.3 lbs.  I doubled the recipe and it turned out great.  No changes.  Next time I would use even larger pieces of aluminum foil so there'd be no leakage.  A great recipe that was requested by my guests.

Love the maple flavor. And putting it under the broiler for the last few minutes gave it a nice crust on the exterior. Leftovers turned into great sandwiches!

This was delicious and I served the pork loin with cooked carrots, and mashed potatoes. The sauce was splendid as is, but next time I will add cayenne pepper or Tobasco sauce to it. It benefits with that little zip.
The sauce complimented the carrots and potatoes and next time I will double the sauce ingredients for a two pound roast (after adjusting the servings qty to 4).

Excellent mix of sweetness makes the pork loin extremely tasty.     Basting often renders a nice caramel crust which I found myself just eating from the pan.    Yummmy

this was a tasty change of taste! Only thing I altered was using smoky bacon maple syrup, which is what i had on hand. Oh, and a bit of beer instead of water!
Very well received by all at the dinner table.
I will make this again. I think the foil packet  was a great idea.

The recipe is excellent, although I did listen to other reviews and decided I didn’t want it this sweet. I did decrease the maple syrup to 1/2 cup and the sugar about 1/3 less than the recipe called for. I will definitely use again and again.

Excellent taste!  Takes a blah roast and makes it savory and flavorful.  We all thought it was delicious, and I will definitely make it again.  Moist and so easy.  
I used a smaller roast (about 2 lbs) so just cut down the amount of sauce I made.  It doesn't need to be exact.  Only needed to cook about 50 minutes before broiling the sauce on top.

This was disappointing. The water was not necessary. There wasn't very much flavour for the amount of expensive maple syrup and ketchup used. I should have opened the packet much earlier to get a nicer crust on the outside and glazing it more. Meat wasn't very tender. Wouldn't make it again.

Very tasty.  I figured this would translate well to the BBQ, and it worked.  I set my Weber kettle for indirect grilling (coals on either side of the bbq).  Browned the meat over the coals, then wrapped the pork with the sauce in foil like the recipe suggested.  Put the wrapped meat in a disposable tin in the center and cooked covered for about 30 minutes.  The grill was about 400.  My store didn't have pork loin roast, so I bought two pieces of tenderloin totaling 3.5lbs.  Finally finished the meat over coals again to set the sauce.

This roast was spot on delicious!  I made exactly has indicated (and will real maple syrup as other reviewers suggested).  The only things I changed was to add a couple dashes of Worcestershire sauce to cut back little on the overly tomato taste one reviewer said.  I also cooked at 330 degrees for slightly longer because I've found that pork cooks best at lower temperature.  It literally fell apart and the flavors were delicious!
Thank you for sharing this - will definitely be making again.

Made exactly as written. So easy and so good! The second time I made it, I cut up sweet potatoes, butternut squash and carrots and cooked it all in the foil with it...awesome!!!

The pork was tender and the flavor was very good, but I gave it four stars because the glaze never thickened up.

We totally loved this recipe! I did follow a few of the suggestions other reviewers used.  Although, I wouldn’t recommend using juices for gravy.

This is a good, quick recipe that gives the pork a flavor that’s a little different and very tasty.  I added some shredded sage and also some Chinese hot sauce to the sauce which worked well.

Delicious!!!  I made a few minor changes:  cut down the ketchup to 1/2 cup, used a 1.5 lb piece of pork loin seasoned with Adobo, didn't add garlic or water to the sauce, and warmed the maple syrup & ketchup in the microwave before mixing.  I used heavy-duty aluminum foil to make the packet (clean up was a snap!), and used convection roast  @ 350° for 45 minutes (internal temp=170°); served with mashed potatoes & steamed green beans.  (Judging from the original recipe & photo, I believe tenderloin, NOT loin, was originally used.). 

 The meat was wonderfully tender, and the sauce was great over the potatoes.  My only regret is that I didn't make a larger piece of meat!  We'll definitely have this again - with a little less ketchup & maybe some ginger.

If you make this in a crockpot or pressure cooker, the sauce will be much thinner due to the cooking method. Reducing it before serving will improve the flavor and consistency.

I followed this recipe almost exactly.  I had a 3 lb roast, not a 4.  I  scaled down the sauce a bit since I had a smaller roast.  When I tried to sear the roast on all sides it just burned immediately.   I must have a powerful stove so I'll have to be more careful next time.  I don't know why the recipe says to cook the roast to 170, I'd be afraid of it drying out so I cooked it to 155 and even felt that was a bit high.  The sauce was very good but I like spicy foods so a bit of heat would make this good recipe great.  I will definitely make again!

Very good but I doubled the sauce as we like it. Don't overcook - stop cooking 2-3 C before the port reaches its final cook temperature - it will finish on it's own

This is really good. I wouldn't bother setting aside the 1/4 sauce. Just throw it all in the oven- I used a bread loaf pan. You can spoon out the sauce when it's all done.

We enjoyed the pork.  I cooked a 4 lb. pork loin. I cut it in half  as suggested and braised each as directed. Next time I will cook it less that 2 hrs.  Wasn't dry, but could have been more moist.  While cooking the smell of the ketchup did smell strong and I thought it might be too much.  The sauce it made was very good.  Putting the sauce over each slice on the plate and being able to dip each piece in the sauce when eating was very good.  Will make it again

I don't like pork loin, but they were on sale & my husband bought several. I have been trying to find a recipe that worked for me. This was try #5, and it was definitely more than edible. I can see why it would work as a pulled pork sandwich (there were no leftovers, so we didn't get to try it). The sauce would make a good sweet & sour chicken. Supremely tender - no knife necessary. Thanks so much for a pork recipe that I can get on board with.

I had a 5 lb loin and baked it for 2 hours. It was not fall off the bone meat. With that said it was really good.  My ultra picky 4 year old didn't like it but my 2 year old, 6 year old and husband all liked it.  I did change up the recipe by replacing 1/2 the ketchup with sweet baby ray's bbq sauce.  I will make this again it is a keeper. Thank you for sharing.

I should've checked the temp earlier, as I had a smaller roast. I also made 1/3 of the maple syrup mixture, as I was serving the pork with creamed cabbage. The mixture had a terrific taste, I will make a full recipe next time without the cabbage! (And check the roast earlier!)

VERY GOOD.  Giving it four stars only because I forgot to broil the glaze as the final step.  It was still very good and the family said to bring it back to the table.

I cooked my roast only 90 minutes because it was 3.8 lbs.  I checked the temp and it was 165.  Carry over would pull it up another 5 to 10 degrees, so I took it out.  (Again, forgot to broil it to caramelize sauce.)

This was by far the BEST pork loin roast I have ever had!  So moist, juicy,  & tender that u can cut it with a fork! I followed the recipe exactly but did bake for 1 hr 45 minutes & put additional  maple syrup on the roast & broiled for a few minutes until top was a  caramelized glaze. Excellent recipe!  I will definitely make this a "go to" recipe for pork loin roasts!

I followed Pam620's recommendations (thanks!) and used mostly BBQ sauce instead of ketchup. I did use about a 1/3 cup ketchup just to bring out a little of that meatloaf type flavor, which turned out well. I cooked an hour on 350, basted in the sauce, then an hour on 325, then took the lid off and another 30 minutes on 325 and it was perfect - cut with a fork but not fall apart.

I also added a nice touch by accident: I grabbed what I thought was the crushed garlic from the fridge but it turned out to be horseradish. I added the garlic when I discovered my mistake but was a little worked about the horseradish effect, especially for my kids who don't like things hot. In the end, it added a nice earthy touch without at all being overwhelming. (Used 2 teaspoons HR)

I followed the recipe as it was written and it was delicious.  The family loved it. The sauce cooked with the pork came out thick and yummy.  Next time, I will pour all the sauce over the pork to cook in the oven.  Thank you.

I made this exactly as told, in the oven. We didn't like it that much. It was not so tender as described; done and edible, but not falling apart like some slow-cooked pork I've made in that past. There was more sauce than needed, both for covering the pork and for table (since we didn't use it), and the taste was bland and just vaguely tomato-ey.

I made this for my boyfriend and we both loved it.  Even though I made enough to have leftovers we ate it all right up!  Instead of the full ketchup portion I used half that much ketchup and half barbecue sauce.  Also, the recipe as is makes way too much sauce.  If you want the right amount, cut it in half.  I ended up reusing the leftover sauce with baked chicken but wasn't as good as on the pork.

Used only 1/3 cup ketchup. No need for the flour, just brown your meat in a oven safe non-stick roasting pan
, pour sauce over the meat, cover with aluminum foil. Bast a few times, uncover meat for last 30 minutes. Place pan on burner, remove meat and thicken sauce with flour. Cut up and spoon thick sauce over the meat. Very very good.

I followed the recipe exactly the first time.  My family including both my daughter's families really thought this was a great recipe.  It seemed to be a real man pleaser!  One of my son-in-laws is from Vermont.  He is an adamant user of real maple syrup.  I used the real deal from Vermont.  The second time I made it, I did not reserve any juice.  You can just use the juice after it cooks.  I combined this meat with glazed carrots and mashed potatoes.  We love it just the way the recipe is written.

Made this for my husband's birthday as he requested roast pork. I had never cooked one before and the ingredients were kind of unique...then I read the reviews and took the risk. WOW!!  And I didn't have real maple syrup and it was still great. The real thing is on my shopping list for next time, which will be very, very soon!  One of the best recipes I have ever made.

Only change I made was used 8 bone-in center cut chops because that's what I had on hand.  Cooked chops in foil pack for about 75 minutes. Very tender, moist and quite good! My husband (a man of few words) said "These are really good!"  I will def make again....make sure you cook remaining  sauce on stove. It tightens right up! Poured the rest over the chops when done. Very good. Thanks for sharing.

All I can say is Wow!  This was the Best Pork Roast I have every tasted!  Okay, so everyone has Maple Syrup in their pantry, right?  Not, I had to improvise...I used 3 Tablespoons of Dark Karo Syrup and a 1/2 teaspoon of Maple Flavoring.  I am not sure if I re-invented the recipe or not but, it was Really Good!  This is going on the monthly rotation for sure.  Thank you for sharing it.

This had great flavor.  The maple syrup and ketchup make a nice combination.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I had just fried some bacon, so I seared the meat in bacon grease instead of Canola oil.  Many others said that their roasts did not come out dry, but mine was still on the dry side, but I do believe the is just the type of meat.  I agree with other reviewers and think the sauce could definitely be cut down.  There is a ton in the bottom of the tin foil when it is done cooking.  I plan to try this again with different cuts of pork.

This pork loin roast had a large fat cap on it which this recipe did not address. I wasn't sure if it would be better to leave that on or trim it?  Anyway I decided to leave it on.  The flavor was okay but this would've been a total bland disaster without the serving sauce  so don't skip that part. This was just Ok.  Will not make again but at least it wasn't a total loss!

Made this recipe today for 40 people. Everything was gone within a few minutes. Had to lessen ketchup to 1/2 cup and mixed the extra sauce with cornstarch and bring to a boil then poured over sliced pork. Yum!!!

Very tasty, a bit sweet, and very tender...best of all very easy clean up.  I did use the suggestion of using BBQ sauce...we liked it but due to the sweetness I may need to mess around with things to make a bit more on the savory side since that's more my preference for meat dishes.

I tried this recipe tonight. Wonderful! Moist, tender, and tangy. We will heat up leftovers and serve with mashed potatoes. I added about 1/2 cup chopped onions to the packet. Thanks for posting this delicious recipe.

The pork loin was extremely moist and tender, but I just didn't get a lot of flavor from the marinade/sauce.  I'll try it again and mix some stuff up and we'll see what we get.  :)

Delicious - used this recipe on a pork loin that was already peppered from store. It worked beautifully.  I added sauteed onions & mushrooms to the sauce and served over mashed potatoes.

Awesome.  I've never really been a fan of pork loin until I tried this recipe.  It even came out looking just like the photo.  How often does that ever happen?  I can't rave about this enough.  Next time I will be making extra sauce and using it to turn my next pork loin into pulled pork sandwiches because this really does just pull apart when you try to slice it.

This is a very good recipe that the whole family loves.  I use a pork tenderloin, even tough it is more expensive.

Made some minor changes to the recipe. Used half BBQ sauce, half ketchup since I was low on the latter. As for oils, I usually only stock extra-virgin olive oil and vegetable oil, so instead of the canola used the vegetable. I also added garlic powder, onion powder and ground black pepper to the sauce, as well as quite a bit more minced, fresh garlic. Prior to dredging the roast I chose to rub it down with Worcestershire sauce instead of salt and pepper. I feel this added a little more taste. The pork came out quite tender, which I was very pleased with. Only disappointment was that the flavour did not penetrate the meat, just the outer crisp layer. Perhaps this could be marinated in the sauce and some is reserved (prior to the meat going in) to pour on, and this would help give it a full-flavoured effect. I do realize this is meant to be a "no marinating recipe" but it was just a thought to improve on an already tasty creation. Served it with oven-roasted carrots, onions, potatoes and rutabaga.

Made this for Sunday supper with the family.  It was very good but I think I will halve the sauce next time as there was a lot of sauce.  Flouring & searing is an essential step, it adds a lot of flavour!  Thanks for this addition to me favorites

this was really good.  I liked that it was easy to prepare and made a nice simple, not too fancy galze for the pork loin.

This recipe is wonderful! I used a mix of barbeque sauce and ketchup, and real maple syrup, and it was so good.  I poured the marinade over the meat and served it family style. The meat was moist and delicious!

This turned out absolutely delicious!  I omitted the garlic because I didn't have any on hand, but don't think I'll bother in the future because it was so good.  The meat was tender and moist and the sauce was very tasty.  We loved it and I have put the recipe in my "favorite" cookbook.

I loved this recipe and so did my husband. I actually followed all the steps except I used a pork rump roast (cheaper) and cooked it in a crockpot on low for 8 hours. Meat was tender and the flavors were great.

Roasted pork is great when you slow cook it in the oven but DO NOT USE THIS COMBINATION OF INGREDIENTS FOR THE SAUCE.  This is a weird combination of ingredients and the water and maple syrup do not mix nor taste well with the ketchup.  Roast with BBQ instead.  No good.

I should have known to stop when I mixed the sauce together and it didn't smell appetizing at all.  It is such an odd pairing: ketchup and maple syrup.  I thought I'd try something different but this was not the recipe I should have tried.  I tried to get the sauce off and salvage my pork by taking the advice of another and drenching it in bbq sauce.
