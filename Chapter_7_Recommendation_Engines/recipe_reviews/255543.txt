I was excited to try this b/c it's different than our usual favorite, and we LOVED it! I really liked the use of the pepper jack instead of cheddar and the blue cheese just put this over the top. I did half the recipe, and that was the perfect amount for us. I will def be making this one again and again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

End up making this dish for a Christmas party with friends. It came out perfect. I did change the recipe a little though. Instead of using blue cheese dressing i used ranch dressing and just kept the blue cheese for the crumble for the top of the dish. Doing so made this dish Perfect! I also used franks hot sauce for buffalo wings, not just hot sauce. Would for sure make this dish again with my little changes to it! Everyone thought it was so good!  it was perfect it didn't have to much of a hot kick to it which was nice, just the right amount.

Delicious. But like others, felt the bleu cheese dressing would be too much. Used Ranch instead. Just right. The crumbled bleu cheese on top is enough. Very rich. Maybe some chopped green onions next time?  Tortilla chips or plain crackers were the favorites.
