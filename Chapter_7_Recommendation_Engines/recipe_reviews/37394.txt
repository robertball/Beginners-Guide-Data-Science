I made this pie for Thanksgiving 2003 for a family gathering.  It was wonderful!  I got so many compliments on it.  The texture and flavor were exceptional.  The traditional pumpkin pie did not have a chance beside this one.  We will definitely use this recipe again.

My family loved the combo of pecans and pumpkin.  Two pies in one.  I had to bake a little longer for it to firm up.

I made this yesterday for Thanksgiving, which, is a mistake.  The body of the pie is too soft for me as I like it firmer.  The flavor was ok.  I found the praline mixture couldn't get to be mixed well.
