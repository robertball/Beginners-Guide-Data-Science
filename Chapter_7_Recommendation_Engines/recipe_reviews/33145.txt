First of all, the Russian dish is called PASKHA (pas-kha), not "pashka". Secondly, it is not just a dessert eaten with bread. It is a special dish you make once a year, for Easter, and eat it with the Russian Easter cake.

I don't think this recipe is quite authentic enough to be called pashka, but is pretty tasty nonetheless. Traditional pashka is a molded cheese and uses farmer's cheese and boiled egg yolks. I like to use blueberries in place of currants (traditionally raisins), and I highly recommend opting for ricotta cheese over sour cream. Throw in some freshly-grated lemon rind and a dash of rosewater and chill in miniature bundt molds overnight. Garnish the finished cheese mold with a sprig of mint and a lemon curl and serve with a dense and crusty sweetbread. Your brunch guests will sing your praises.

Pashka is traditionally served within my extended family (Mennonite background) as a bread at Easter.  This recipe sounds like the pashka 'cheese' used as a spread for the sweet and thick crusted bread.

I have heard the cheese is best made with 'real' cottage cheese (from local farmers) rather than that found in a local grocery store.  The texture is much finer and it provides a richer taste.

Not exactly a Paskha, but quite good. If u want this to become authentic, just don't use cream cheese but try to find full-fat cottage cheese, like 18%. 
Oh, and it's a dessert served on Easter only

OMG this was so simple and so good. I also did not use currents. I soften rasins and used them. You can subsituted almost any fruit or just leave out.

Very good! I used chopped peaches instead of currants. We celebrate Ostara, and used this dish as part of our feast. I recommend this dish for anyone!

I mother made Pashka every Easter and used vanilla bean and yellow raisins.  She used a plastic flower pot with holes and lined it with cheese cloth so that the liquid could drain.  It was served as a dessert.  I cut down on the sugar because of the raisins I used.

Pashka is one of my favorite Easter time dishes. I LOVE this recipe! So easy to make and it tastes like cheesecake filling! I leave out any raisins or almonds as everyone in my family likes it smooth. This was the 1st time I added lemon extract to it and it was surprisingly good. Perfect pashka if you ask me!

This was great! I don't like currants and I didnt have almonds so I put a drop of almond flavoring in the mix. I would probably cut down the sugar if I was not going to use the tart currants but it was still really wonderful! Thanks for the recipe Jackie! I will make it often!!!!!

This recipe is nothing short of amazing.  For a little something extra, use sugar flavored with vanilla or roses.

Made this for the guys at my work Friday before Easter. They are all mostly Russian's and I wanted to give them something they are use to. 
This will not mold into a cheese block like images you see,the consistency is of cottage cheese. 
If you want the authentic kind you can mold it is a little more difficult of a recipe and takes a lot longer.
I used strawberries instead of currents,and I think it turned out great "taste wise",but it doesn't look great. Does taste like cheesecake though!

Couldn't find currants so used raisins.  This would make a great fruit dip as well as on bagels or toast.  Served it as dessert for a Russian dinner and it was a huge success.
