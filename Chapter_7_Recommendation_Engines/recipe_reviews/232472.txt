I'm a little uncertain how to rate this, since I made a single, but significant change, so I'll just rate it...excellent!  Use double the butter, softened, not melted (wanted it to make sure it piped well for cupcakes), and you will end up with something really rich, smooth, velvety and deeply,decadently chocolate that's like eating spoonable fudge.  Simply a drop dead gorgeous frosting.

Super Yummy and not too sweet! I only added 1/3 cup Dutch Cocoa powder because I wanted to tint the frosting Tiffany Blue. Came out pretty close too; but the minimal amount of Cocoa powder turned out to be an advantage. It was just right. Very mellow in fact for the very rich cupcake it sat upon!

LOVED IT!   This was an awesome frosting, I will definitely be using it again, Thanks!  I recommend adding the powdered sugar and milk a little at a time each, until it has the taste and consistency you want.

Great recipe, wonderful that it really IS a 10 minute recipe! I had no milk in the house so i used heavy whipping cream and a bit of water. Also did not melt the butter, but beat it until whipped, added sifted powdered sugar by the cup and whipped that, then added sifted cocoa and water/cream mixture and vanilla extract. Not a lump in sight.

Great base recipe! You can add almost any extract to this. So far I have used cherry, vanilla, almond, and raspberry. I have used this frosting for cakes, brownies, and cupcakes. It's great because you can make it as thin or as thick as you need it depending on your preference. I would suggest adding the confectioners sugar and milk as you need them to obtain your desired consistency. Great recipe! Thanks shellann13!

The frosting TASTED wonderful, however, the consistency was not frosting like.  I could POUR it.  Right now after adding more and more confectioners sugar and more butter its in the freezer.  Hoping it will thicken up so I can use it.  Did the recipe EXACTLY as was supposed to.  Must have done something wrong? cause I'm not much into making frosting but know my way around the kitchen very well.  Oh, and it was NOT clumpy at all.  Keeping fingers crossed that it comes out OK after a visit in the freezer!

I loved this frosting! No problems with lumps as many stated. I sifted my cocoa before I mixed it with the butter, maybe that was the key. I will use this again and again.

Great foolproof recipe--Also good if you substitute coffee for milk. Easy to adjust consistency -- if too thin, add more powdered sugar--if too thick, add more liquid. Can't go wrong! --franhop

This was the easiest chocolate frosting I have ever made. It turned out perfect. It was so smooth and creamy.  Great idea about mixing the cocoa with the melted butter. I think it made all the difference in the creaminess.  I added a couple of tablespoons of Kahlua to the mix and used Fat Free Half and Half instead of milk.  Added sugar and half and half gradually in stages.

I've been looking for a go-to chocolate recipe and this just might be it! I think the melted butter makes it come together much easier. Not too sweet and very chocolatey!

Excellent and so easy!  I did double the butter (softened not melted) and added the confectioners' sugar a little at a time and not all at once.  The frosting was fluffy and creamy!  Will definitely use again!

Far too runny! I have double the frosting that I need now as I keep adding confectioners sugar and a bit more cocoa to recipe in the hope that it will thicken up enough to apply to the cake. I've now resorted to placing the frosting in the fridge in the hope that it will thicken up a bit. This is definitely not a recipe for layered cakes. Otherwise, perhaps cut the amount of milk in half or less?

I made this icing 2 times in 2 days for my daughter's birthday cakes.  (It was for 2 separate birthday parties.)   It is delicious and so easy to make.  I used softened butter, not melted, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  It was so creamy & chocolately.  The perfect icing for a yellow birthday cake.  Everyone loved it!  I will definitely make this again!

This frosting is a five star plus!! I am 59 years young, and in my lifetime, I have never tasted frosting as delicious as this one is. My mom was a homemaker/baker all her life, and I hate to say, but this is better than hers. The only thing I did different than the directions was, I added just a pinch of espresso powder...just kicked the flavor up a notch.
Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Delicious!!! It really is the best chocolate icing EVER!  I didn't melt the butter but just used softened butter. Whip it all up with a mixer and viola!  I'm a fan of dark chocolate, so I just used half the amount of icing sugar. Super easy to make. You really can't go wrong with this one. LOVED it!!!  Would I recommend this...heck yah!

Really yummy. As is it's really sweet and a little thin. Second time I made it I cut the sugar to 2 cups and increased the cocoa to a full cup. It made it a darker chocolate just a bit thicker and really rich and yummy.

An exceptional frosting recipe - creamy, tasty and very chocolaty.  i'd suggest for folks who get the lumps that you not put all the ingredients in at one time but add 1/3 at a time, each with a bit of milk behind it and it will stay creamy creamy without a single lump.  And I didn't beat but just kept mixing.  Don't sift anything, it's not necessary, but be sure to mix the hot melted butter and cocoa first and then add the sugar and milk slowly.  I did make one wee mistake and it turned out for the better - missed putting in the vanilla since it was meant to add afterward - I did half with and half without, and both were wonderful.

Not the best tasting frosting I have ever made, but it WAS good.  Spreaded nicely and will use again when letting the kids decorate cupcakes.  I followed the recipe exactly.

I made this frosting to top the "one bowl chocolate cake III" recipe from allrecipes. I needed one that called for ingredients I had on hand. This one didn't call for shortening. I was worried, since one review mentioned it was "lumpy" but another reviewer suggested mixing the milk and powdered sugar a little at a time, so I did that, and mine wasn't lumpy. I used Hersheys dark chocolate cocoa and it turned out well. It spread very nicely and I will definitely use this recipe in the future.

great recipe, easy and quick, my kids loved it. Use an electric mixer and about 1/2t more of milk to make it fluffy and no lumps or grains. I also added a teaspoon of orange essence, making a wonderful chocolate orange frosting.

This is excellent frosting! I sifted the cocoa as well as the powered sugar and blended it alternately with the milk and no lumps at all! I added one square of unsweetened chocolate to the melted butter because I wanted it to be a little darker.

Very good recipe. I was looking for a buttercream that was not overly sweet. I changed it just a bit. I softened but did not completely melt the butter. As I saw others mention clumps, I put the sugar and cocoa into a sifter before adding it to the butter. After adding the vanilla, i put a tablespoon of Kahlua into a measuring cup before adding milk to equal 1/3 cup. The frosting has a light mocha flavor.

Very chocolatey and rich - sometimes cocoa frostings aren't chocolatey enough but I believe having a whole stick of butter in it takes it over the top!  I added hot coffee rather than milk and found I needed to add a little more sugar, maybe a 1/4 cup or so.  Topped the cake with toasted pecans and it was divine!  This is a full bodied frosting with a lot of flavor.

This frosting had the best taste.  I used it for a layer cake and it worked beautifully. The only issue I had was that it was a little clumpy.  Next time, I will add the powdered sugar and milk a little at a time to see if that helps. Super good!

Very chocolatey, easy to make. I made about 1.5 times the recipe because I had a 3 layer cake to frost and wanted to make sure I had enough to cover it. The consistency was good and spread easily. I would use this recipe again, but may try some modifications.

This frosting has a STRONG aftertaste of cocoa powder.  I used the exact amount, and even added more butter like a prior review suggested, and I ended up adding more milk to try and cut the aftertaste.  It helped, but I won't make it again.

I didnt love it, the consistency was perfect for icing a cake. It looked amazing but something about it, I just didn't love. Maybe not sweet enough, I honestly cant put my finger on it, maybe too much cocoa powder. However it did look amazing.

super easy and tasty....a little thick to spread, so I thinned it with Kahlua (after all, it's my son's 21st birthday and I'd already added it to the chocolate cinnamon cake)....that little addition made it delectable!  I would double the recipe for most cakes, this did the trick for a single sheet cake however

I used this recipe to frost cupcakes, piping it on in a rosette shape. It was delicious and came out beautifully. I think the melted butter is the key.

I made this frosting, for Thanksgiving, following the recipe exactly.  While waiting for the turkey to fry, my nephew helped himself to a slice of cake. His exact words were "that turkey is irrelevant when this cake tastes like all kinds of heaven in my mouth." Need I say more?

I heated the butter in the microwave which left it more softened than melted. It whipped together with the cocoa perfectly. Added the rest of the ingredients following the recipe and was really impressed with the results. This will be my go to chocolate frosting in the future.

I needed a quick and easy frosting for a last minute birthday cake. I’ve never made my own frosting before. I’ll never buy store bought frosting again! This was quick, super easy, and made up of pantry staples. It was really good! I had enough to frost a 9x13 single layer cake and there was about 1/3 leftover.

I made this frosting and followed all instructions except for melting the butter. I had my butter soft already, so I beat it in the bowl, added the sifted together cocoa and 10x, mixed a minute or 2 then slowly added half and half (didn't have milk) mixed w/ vanilla. Blah, killer sweet and not chocolate-y at all. I had some super dark 100% cocoa powder, so I added 1/3 cup of that, and that helped boost the chocolate flavor and cut the sweet. Next time I will use less sugar and a bit more vanilla

This was really easy, took all of about 8 minutes and no weird ingredients. Came out thick and chocolatey, spreads easy and tasted delicious. I'll never buy canned again.

This is THE BEST frosting yummy! I forgot to melt the butter and it was a bit grainy in texture but it was still outstanding. I also sifted my coco  like someone suggested and added almond extract and vanilla. Delish!

I make this very frosting but my method is a little different..
I add the milk last, whisking in 1 Tbsp at a time until it's the consistency I like.   Oh, I do whisk in about 1 Tbsp of light corn syrup first..then add enough of the milk to thin it to a thick but spreadable consistancy.  The corn syrup seems to smooth out the sugar and helps to make the frosting glossier in appearance.

I used whipping cream instead of milk only because that's all I had available.  The taste is amazing and it was super easy to make!!  This will be one of my go to recipes for sure!!

Followed the recipe exactly and it turned out wonderfully! The cocoa gave a big caffeine punch and my daughters and I had a hard time falling asleep later.  Might need to be an afternoon cake frosting. :-)

I made this as written, with the exception of using light cream in place  of milk, but wasn't impressed. There was just something about the flavor that seemed "unfinished" for lack if a better description. 

So I added extra vanilla (I'm guestimating I used 1 T. vanilla total) and about 1 t. light Karo syrup -- then beat the heck out of it on high speed for several minutes. In the end it turned out to be the best chocolate frosting I've ever made. Smooth, silky and milk chocolatey -- much like the flavor of chocolate marshmallow ice cream. Found myself wishing I had made a marshmallow sauce to swirl through it. Yum.

Really good chocolate-y frosting!  I used 1/4 cup of shortening and 1/4 cup of non-dairy butter instead of just butter (I like the consistency of frosting made with shortening), and as others suggested, added (soy) milk slowly rather than measuring and adding in all at once.  Came out perfectly - was really easy to beat out the lumps. Beautiful on the cupcakes and really good!  Did make a huge batch - should be more than enough for a full 2 layer cake or 24 cupcakes.

This is the same recipe I got off of a Cocoa box back in the day.  The name of it is Chocolate Lover's Frosting.  It doesn't matter who put this recipe out it's something that should be shared.  It's the best chocolate frosting ever!  Easy, creamy and delicious!  The only thing I do different is I use softened buttered.  I  don't melt it.

Rich flavour. I used Hershey's Cocoa 100% Cacao Natural Unsweetened. And followed the recipe exact, except I may have used 1 teaspoon extra of  milk. I love chocolate and this will be my go to receipe from now on.

This was so amazing! I did not melt my butter but i did let it sit to room temp and cream it together with the coca powder  BEFORE moving onto the rest of the rest of the recipe. I only added a little milk at a time until I got to were I needed.

Very good and not too filling or sweet. Perfect for a cake that already has a lot of flavour.

I made this according to the recipe without making any changes.  It came out perfect and every piece of my cake was eaten.   I received many compliments and even a "God bless  you".  :)

Fast and easy and 1 bowl and turned out amazing.  I read a review where she creamed the butter instead of melting it and I did that as well and then added the icing sugar 1 cup at a time and then added the rest and it turned out wonderful.  But it was even better because I used all Organic ingredients and used it on the One Bowl Chocolate Cake recipe.  So it will a Healthy Chocolate cake.  ;)

great consistency! I followed the directions on another comment. It whipped the butter first, then added powdered sugar. That worked well for me. I also added a bit more milk after the whole process and hand mixed it.

Me and my daughter made this icing for store bought cake. I am teaching her to cook, and choose easy receipts. This one is very easy and delicious. Instead of confectioners sugar we used icing sugar and instead of 3 cups we put 2 cups. It tastes so great, not so sweet.

No changes. I used it on my Grandmothers "very old Chocolate Fudge Cake" recipe. It was great. Her frosting was nothing  was measured, just add the sugar, vanilla, etc. I can't do that kind of baking, I don't bake or cook well enough for that.

I followed the suggestion by Naples34102 to double the butter and just soften it (not melt it) and it worked like a charm! I would recommend Ghiradelli unsweetened cocoa, the quality of the cocoa powder is essential to the taste of the frosting! Follow the recipe exactly except substitute softened butter for melted butter.  Thank you for this great recipe!

I doubled the butter as suggested by another reviewer and it was the best frosting I have ever made, and I've made a lot in my lifetime! I also halved the cocoa so it was more milk chocolatey than deep dark chocolatey. I may double the butter in all my frostings from now on.

This frosting is excellent. You only need a few ingredients making this the most attractive frosting recipe (no chocolate bars/chips). I use about half the sugar or a little more. And like some suggestions,  add a little sugar and milk at a time until it’s the color taste and consistency you like. It’s rich ‘n savory (not too sweet) the way I make it.

superb frosting.  Made it as listed and it came out very good.  It was not enough to cover my 2 layer 9-inch cake, so double the recipe if you want to frost the top and sides.

This was scrumptious! I will never make another chocolate frosting recipe for a layer cake again! The only changes I made was the butter. I used 1/2 cup of coconut oil spread,and used 1/2 teaspoon butter flavor extract,( I like Wiltons). I uses almond milk because of a milk allergy in the family. Thank you to the submitter of this recipe.

This recipe rocked.  Super easy, super tasty.  We've tried several others and this one wins.  FYI- We doubled it for a 9-inch layer cake and still had a bunch left over, even being very generous with the frosting.  Now we have to resist eating it with a spoon.

I it tastes good but a but on the runny side. I think nexT time I will use 2 sticks of burr and not melt it. It will blend easily enough just I being at room temperature.

I love that this is made with melted butter, because it means that I don't have to remember to leave out butter to soften. I did need about another 3/4 cup of sugar. It is a lovely, dark color and piped nicely.

This is a really good frosting! Although if you want a more piped high mountain type frosting, this is not for you it's more droopy and you will have to put it on with a knife

It came out tasty but a bit thick. I recommend adding a bit more milk. I used it as is and it started to tear the cake as I spread it on. However, if you like a richer chocolate flavor, this frosting is excellent. I loved the semi-dark chocolate flavor it has.

Delicious recipe- only changes I made were I didn't melt the butter all the way and I used less milk - maybe half or 2/3 of the amount listed otherwise it would have been too runny if I had used it all . But it was easy and delicious and I would make it again :)

Very good!  Added extra 1/4c cocoa. Used margarine instead of butter and didn't melt it.  Had to double the amount of milk - was way too thick. Definitely will be making it again.

Excellent frosting!  I followed the recipe as written with two exceptions - I sifted the cocoa into the melted butter as another reviewer suggested;  and I only needed about 1/2 of the milk to get the consistency I needed.  Alternating additions of icing sugar and milk and beating in between resulted in a lovely, creamy frosting.

Very easy and tastes great for such a quick recipe. I had originally bought a can of frosting but accidentally bought whipped frosting and it tasted terrible. I was in a pinch and didn't want to go back to the grocery store. I found this recipe, had all the ingredients so I took a chance. I didn't melt the butter, just softened it like some suggested. It turned out great, better than any other chocolate frosting I have bought or made. I will be using this recipe from now on! Use the good Dutch processed cocoa if you can. It really gave a deep chocolate flavor that you can't get with regular cocoa.

If you want to pipe your frosting do not melt your butter. Instead soften to room temperature. I used 1 cup butter instead of 1/2 cup. The chocolate flavor is very easily adaptable. If you like a lighter flavor use less cocoa, deeper use more. I actually didn't measure my cocoa and added until I got the deep chocolate color and flavor I was going for. My hubby thought this was too sweet but most confectioner sugar frostings tend to be on the super sweet side. I liked this!

I loved this recipe! I had to make a cake with what was on hand and this frosting complimented it very well! I mixed the powdered sugar and milk in very slowly, alternating the two, and it came out completely smooth and clump free! I didn't even use a mixer- just a fork. The frosting is thinner than store bought, but still works great- I just put mine in the fridge for a few minutes while the cake cooled. Good luck bakers!

I made it with Dutch Processed Cocao and a touch extra Mexican vanilla and it is fantastic. Next time I may increase the amounts by 1/3 because I like a cake with thick icing between the layers and this didn't make enough.

This looks nice and easy and I'll be trying it soon, with these changes:

*Instead of milk I will use unsweetened yogurt
*I will use 3 1/4 cup confectioner's sugar

Easy, delicious, but mine had tiny little (delicious) lumps in it too (followed recipe exactly). Maybe it makes a difference how hot your melted butter is? (Mine was maybe less hot.)

This is a dependable, easy-to-prepare icing recipe. Like a other reviewers, i found the consistency too thick, so added a few more tablespoons of milk. I too had some small chocolate 'pieces' in the final product, although it didn't negatively impact the overall flavour (and the guests just assumed it was intentional). I'll add the icing sugar more slowly next time. Thanks for the recipe.

A bit sweet for my taste.  Next time I would replace 1/3 c powdered sugar with cocoa powder (so 1 full cup cocoa and 2 2/3c powdered sugar).  Went together easily

Excellent! Simple and deelish. I used it to top a 'cake-in-a-mug' recipe using a smaller amount.  Eating it now. Yummmmm!

Would definitely use on a full cake.

Good flavor, but runny and lumpy. Yes, I sifted both the cocoa and the confectioner's sugar. I added more conf. sugar, a little at a time. It didn't help. I'm sorry, but this one just didn't work for me.

Kinda Bitter but also sweet, made it smooth with 1 mixing beater.
followed steps, melted 1/2 cup butter, poured into bowl.
added 1/2 the cocapowder, mixed it to smooth, added the reset, mixed to smooth... added 2x vanilla extract, milk, mixed it to smooth it out also thinned it out as well, leave out the milk, but add the 3 cups of sugar, mix it to smooth, add gradually of course it does get thicker!! add 1 more vanilla, splash more of milk, mixed to smooth. it came out fluffy, smooth and good!

This recipe is awesome!!  Use high quality cocoa and make sure you break up any large chunks of cocoa.  Also - use soft, not melted butter and cream it with the cocoa until smooth.  Add 1-cup sugar, and one-third of the 1/3-cup of milk, alternating.  This recipe is smooth, yummy and just the right consistency !!

The best chocolate frosting recipe I've found thus far!  I did as others suggested and alternated the milk with the confectioner's sugar.  It was incredible on the black forest cake I made!
