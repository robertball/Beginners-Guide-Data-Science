Made it exactly as the recipe called for, with the exception of the coconut milk which I didn't have on hand.  Substituted skim milk and it was fine.  Very moist, not very sweet, lovely bit of crunch from the pecans and nice texture from the coconut. 

My family loves these, they are like excellent little banana breads in their own muffin paper lol.  Next time I am going to try substituting coconut sugar 1:1. Definitely a favourite now.  We don't mind seeing  bananas get old now, and I keep a package of pecans and some coconut handy to whip up a batch any time.

Very moist. My toddler loves them. Made a quarter batch in mini doughnut pan for kids. Also, left out the nuts because my son won't eat them, otherwise they'd be in there. Used soy milk and honey as substitutes, only because that's what I have on hand.  Mini pans only took 10 minutes to bake golden.

This muffin is FANTASTIC!!! I added 1/2 cup of dried cranberries to the mix. It really boosted the flavor!  I will be making these again and again!

I do have Almond milk, so I am going to try that.  I also have discovered that mashing bananas with my hand held mixer with the dough hooks makes it much easier than between two pieces of wax paper. You can have it smoother or chunkier...to suit your taste.

Delicious, most muffins. I used Red Mill unsweetened coconut flakes. They did get stuck in the muffin papers though and fell apart. My tip is to spray them with cooking spray.

I was looking for a good banana bread recipe with greek yogurt when I saw this recipe and decided to give it a try.  I didn't have coconut milk so used my plain greek yogurt  (about 1/3 cup)  I don't think I've ever made a bread without eggs and so little fat and sugar but these were amazingly moist and delicious!

These were delicious!  I reduced the sugar a little and also added dried cranberries as another reviewer recommended.  However, I would recommend adding 3/4 or even a whole cup of the cranberries, as they were few and far between in the finished product.  Also, the batter is VERY thick and dry, so I added a little extra coconut milk, but next time I would at least double the amount.  If you want your muffins to have smooth, rounded tops, you definitely need more liquid in the recipe.  As it is, mine were rough and craggy on top.  It did give a nice texture, but the batter was harder to mix this way.  Just a head's up.  These are great muffins and that didn't spoil them for me.  Will definitely be making them again!

Just made these and ate two right out of the oven! So yummy!  Nice change of pace from banana bread.  Nice that the coconut gives a little texture and the pecans add a nice richness of flavor.

These muffins were great!  This recipe will now replace my banana bread loaf that I normally make. I did substitute skim milk for the coconut milk and added a little more coconut to the mix. I also added brown sugar and coconut for topping, absolutely divine!  Definitely a keeper

Good muffin. Moist and flavorful. I used cook and serve coconut cream pudding instead of sugar and doubled the milk...omitting the oil. Good recipe!  Thanks!

These are awesome!!  The first time I made these exactly by the recipe.  I'd like them to be slightly more healthy (I just can't help myself!).  Second attempt I used 2% milk and added a little extra, half the sugar, 6 bananas, and I used 1/3 whole wheat flour.  They were awesome yet again!!  Next attempt  I am going to try replacing the oil with applesauce. :)

Amazing!! I happened to have extra bananas, and they could've been riper but I NEEDED banana muffins, so my only tweaks are 6 just-ripe bananas as opposed to 4 overripe, and some cinnamon thrown in. DIVINE! :)

Delicious! I followed the recipe exactly. I used So Delicious coconut creamer since I needed creamer and didn't want to waste money on a big carton of coconut milk. The muffins came our moist and tasty.

These are delicious and not too sweet. I make these all the time and everyone loves them! I used vegetable oil or coconut oil instead of olive oil (I don't prefer the taste).  And I found that if the bananas are puréed, more banana flavor comes through. For a little crunch I sprinkle raw sugar and/or coconut on the top right before baking. Yum!!

I'm violating my cardinal rule of not rating something  based on the changes I made, but dang they were good! I always roast my bananas before baking them to bring out the sugars, and I only used 3. Roasting also allows you to add them without mashing and makes a world of difference in the flavor. I also added Craisins like another reviewer suggested which I highly recommend, added an egg, added a teaspoon of chia seeds for the health benefits and chopped the pecans into a powder for flavor but not consistency. And I used a mix of coconut oil and vegetable oil, and regular milk instead of coconut. 
These are moist and delicious and I will definitely make them again!

Used brown sugar instead of natural and a bit more coco milk and vanilla. Still not flavourful enough, but otherwise a good recipe. Next time I will try with a bit more sugar and vanilla. I might also do another banana and some more coconut.

These muffins were a huge hit with my kids!  Finally found a fantastic muffin recipe that's fairly healthy!  Thank you very much!
*update*
made some adjustments cause I thought "why not use Coconut oil?"  I also made a topping of shredded coconut & brown sugar (1 tbsp. each).mixed and sprinkled on the tops just before baking.  If you don't have coconut milk, regular milk works too.

I used frozen bananas slightly thawed and mashed.  I also used vegetable oil and added one slightly beaten egg.  I found them not sweet enough for our taste, so I added a glaze using coconut extract and coconut milk.  Perfect!  I might add a pecan half and a bit of coconut to the tops after glazing them next time.

So good! I made some changes to make them a bit healthier, using 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 white flour, for sugar subbing 1/2 honey and 1/2 brown sugar, coconut oil instead of olive oil, and I used the milk I had (unsweetened almond milk). Like another reviewer said, the dough seemed really dry, so I added another 1/4 cup milk. Also, I only had two largish bananas, so I used those, and didn't add other fruit. They baked for 25 minutes, then I kept them in the oven another two minutes, until they were golden brown all over. The result was a deliciously moist muffin, with the banana taste very strong, and of course, a dominance of coconut flavor. I ate two right out of the oven, with a sliver of melting butter. Excellent!

Yum, I love that they aren't overly sweet!  The only change I made was to use coconut extract instead of vanilla.  I left the banana chunkier as suggested.   I used my medium scoop (about 2 TBSP) and ended up with 19 nice sized muffins; will definitely make these again and again!

I love having a muffin with no eggs or dairy, but these weren't nearly sweet enough for my taste.

Awesome muffin! I increased the coconut milk to 1/3 cup.  They are super moist and delicious.

Super easy and really tasty. I had a few old banana's to throw out and found this first :) avoiding a trip to the supermarket I subbed some ingredients. Not to try and then improve on your recipe, as I hate when people do that, but you can use the following as sub's and it still tastes great. Standard milk instead of Coconut milk. Wholemeal flour instead of white. Rice oil instead of olive oil. And I only had 3 bananas so I added some craisens.  Will make again. Next time after a trip to the store :)

Unfortunately coconut milk is not a staple at our house so I had to use skim milk when I made these on spur of the moment. Added a few golden raisins. The muffins looked beautiful when I took them out of the oven and were quite good. I will definitely make again and make certain to use the coconut milk as called for.
