This recipe has potential.  Things I don't like:  1.)  This recipe assumes you are using a particular type of rice.  I won't work if you are using quick cook white rice or a longer cook brown or jasmine rice.  Maybe it would be more beneficial to list the amount of cooked rice needed rather than give the instructions for cooking the rice.  2.)  For a dish with so much butter, I think this dish was a little bland.  I think adding a couple of different herbs and a liberal amount of salt and pepper make it a great recipe.  3.)  Less butter.  The butter isn't necessary.  I usually skip it without consequence.  The things I do like:  1.)  Lots of veggies.  I also added sliced fresh mushrooms.  I am sure others can be added without taking away from the essence of the casserole.  2.)  Spinach and cheese!   The combination of ingredients is appealing to me, spinach being key. It is also flexible.  The corn, bell peppers, and onions can be substituted with whatever you have (given it is not too overwhelming).

This is a good recipe.  A great way to jazz up spinach!

This was delicious! I did need to change it up a little, though. I used cannelini beans in place of the corn, and I always use brown whole grain rice. Also, I didn't have Swiss cheese, so I used mozzerella and a little muenster I had.I topped it with some feta cheese.  Extremely flavorful!

I did think that this was lacking a little in the flavor department BUT my 3 year old daughter loved it and kept asking for more (she clearly didnt know the amount of veggies she was consuming.) I would make it again but I would add a lot more seasoning (garlic, etc etc.) Also I made my rice on the stove top but next time I would use my rice cooker. I also subbed the water for chicken broth.

EXCELLENT! JUST EXCELLENT! THE ONLY THING I DID DIFFERENTLY WAS USE GOUDA INSTEAD OF SWISS SINCE I HAD NO SWISS AND I USED BUTTERMILK INSTEAD OF REGULAR MILK. IT WAS CHEESY AND CREAMY.

Good recipe for a change of pace. It cut nicely and re-heated well for lunches. A bit heavy on the cheese... if I make it again I'll cut the cheese in half. 

This is not a quick recipe to whip up after work. I used 4 different pans in preparing it! (rice, cooking veggies, cooking butter/flour/milk/cheese, and casserole) Also, the "paste" never thickened, but it worked nonetheless.

This is a great base recipe.  I think it would be very bland as is.  I added extra garlic and salt and a couple tablespoons of fresh rosemary, chopped, into the onion mixture.
I also added cheddar cheese and cream cheese into the cheese mixture.
It was very very good!!

There was a little too much spinach, and the corn seemed out of place. It also was a little flavorless, and I even added extra cheese.  Edible, but not wonderful.

Great recipe! I didnt have all of the ingredients, but I did have most of them. Instead of just the onion and red pepper I used about half of one of those frozen stir fry pepper packages and seasoned it, which took care of the "blandness" everyone is commenting on. Freshly grated parmasean cheese compliments the dish as well. Easy and quick to make!

My family enjoyed this recipe very much! My 2 year old was shoveling it in her mouth. I used a big bunch of fresh spinach, although I could have used more. YUMMY! Thanks.

This is really delicious!  I also used less cheese and, hey, so what if you dirty 3 saucepans - it was worth it for a yummy meal.

We didn't think this was too great. Too many onions and not much flavor. We usually eat leftovers for days, but I had to throw these out because no one wanted them. We did use Cheddar Cheese instead of Swiss, so maybe that made the difference.

I cut this recipe in half in order to make this.  There is only my daughter and I and she is only 2.  I would have had leftovers for weeks if I made the full amount.  Cutting it in half may have affected the proportions to this recipe.
I found that there simply was not enough rice in this dish.  It was mostly veggies and cheese sauce.  Based on what I had in the house I had to use cheddar cheese instead of swiss.  I didn't find that there was too much cheese, I found instead that maybe there wasn't enough.  I used a full cup in the cheese sauce and then another 1/4 cup (I made a mistake and forgot to reserve some.) on top.  I didn't find that it was too cheesy.  I also used fresh spinach, not frozen.  I probably used more spinach then I would have if I had just opened a package of frozen and tossed it in.  I also didn't use the bell pepper because I didn't have any.  I didn't have any hot sauce but made up for that by using cayenne pepper instead.
All in all it is a good recipe.  Next time I'll simply increase the rice and cheese proportions and maybe try and get my hands on some swiss cheeese.  Its hard to find where I live.
BTW...for those that aren't true vegetarians adding chopped up chicken or turkey (leftover preferrably) would be good as well.

My family loved this, only I didn't have corn, but I did have a can of artichoke hearts that I drained and chopped before adding. Also I didn't have swiss cheese, so I used a package of shredded monterey jack. The results were fantastic.

This was a great vegetarian main dish. I substituted soy cheese and it came out just fine. I think next time I will prepare the sauteed veggies first, so that I can just concentrate on the flour and cheese mixture since you need to stir it constantly. Very tasty and filling.

This dish would be best served as a side-dish. My kids weren't too keen on this one, though. It actually tasted better the next day!

I loved this!  I made my own bread crumbs in the oven and I think that made the recipe all the better.  Definitely recommended for a satisfying vegetarian casserole.

I agree with the other reviews about the recipe being a bit bland, but adding soy sauce to the cheese sauce mixture was extremely tasty! I also substituted black beans for the corn and used brown rice. Overall, a very satisfying meal, and I plan to make it again!

Surprisingly good. I didn't have white corn, so I substituted sweet yellow corn instead. I also used a mix of bell pepper (red, green, orange, and yellow) that I had on hand. I didn't have Swiss on hand, so I used marble Jack and fresh Parmesan. To make it even quicker and easier, I made the roux in the microwave. Glad to finally find an easy to make quick meal that my husband likes now that he has begun eating vegetarian.

Turned out great.  Will be making again and again.  Plan on making during the weekends in the future, since it took a little bit longer than planned.

This was the first time I attempted making any kind of casserole whatsoever- and the results were very good! It does take a lot of things on the stove going at once (not a bad idea to prepare with someone else because of this), but everything turned out nicely following this recipe exactly. Next time I will add yellow peppers and tomatoes as well, and a tad bit of minced ginger sounds good too!

My husband and I made this recipe together this evening. I thought it turned out well and enjoyed it.  But, unfortunately he did not. He said it was much too bland, no taste at all.  We followed the recipe to a tee. 

Maybe I can make it again for us in a year with a little added something.

I used cheddar instead of swiss, and an orange pepper for a more subtle pepper flavor. Nice colorful presentation. I don't even like rice, and I had seconds of this dish!

I tried this recipe, although I altered it a lot.  But it still turned out great.  I used spiral pasta instead of rice and marble cheese, along with some other changes.  Would definetly make it again though.

This wasn't bad, but it was VERY labor intensive, both in preparation and clean up.  I also found it rather bland, even though I DOUBLED the garlic and the hot sauce.  My kids didn't really like it, so I'm not sure I'd make it again.

Whew. I liked it for a few bites, but it's a bit rich. It's true that it does heat up well, and that's a good thing because I found it to be quite a stomach-full.
