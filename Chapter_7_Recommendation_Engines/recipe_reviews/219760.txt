I prepared the recipe as written except I didn't have any wine and I used dried basil and I added black olives. After tasting this, it was somewhat bland so I added extra Italian seasoning and stirred in a little sour cream before serving (per another cacciatore recipe). All in all it turned out tasty with a few modification so this is a great base recipe I will probably make again.

One other note, I cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces before re-adding them to the pot to reduce cooking time and this whole recipe ended up taking about half an hour to prepare!

my husband liked this more than anything Ive ever made!  I added 1 jalepeno pepper, and used only fresh cherry tomatoes (nothing canned)  Also I used a LOT of pepper, and no salt. Next time Ill try a few green olives as well.

I used fresh tomatoes and peppers.  Other than that, I followed the recipe. My Mom and husband said it was really good.  I will definitely make again.

Made this with only the change of using fresh tomatoes. Excellent recipe! Just one comment: The photo used in this recipe ( probably a stock photo) isn't what yours will look like. Yours will be chunky and saucy and wonderful It is completely worth it to follow this recipe exactly.
