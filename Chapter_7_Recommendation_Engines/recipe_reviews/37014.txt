This really is a 5* recipe, but it needed a little help.  I used 1.6 qt juice, added some cloves along with the cinnamon, a few squirts of lemon juice, and the juice of 1 orange (about 1/2 cup).  Now it's five *****!

I thought this was way too sweet, but some other folks liked it a lot.  It had a real strong cherry flavor.
