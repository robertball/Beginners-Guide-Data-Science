Delicious! I opted to use Butterball Turkey breast vs. chicken with excellent results.  I added a little chopped celery for a bit more crunch.  I used Hellman's light mayo and an additional Tbsp. fat free greek yogurt to make it extra creamy plus a pinch of salt. I mixed the dressing ingredients separate and then folded it into the other ingredients. I let it chill for a couple of hours and it was perfect over a bed of lettuce for a light lunch!

I use chicken & turkey interchangably, so either works well in this recipe.  I love waldorf salad and combined its ingredients with this, which wasn't too different.  I followed another's recommendation, by combining the mayo, mustard & spices before adding to remaining ingredients.  Love it!  Thank you for sharing your recipe!

For my son, who loves mustard, this was his ticket to heaven.  Unfortunately the honey makes it sweeter than the average chicken salad and threw him off a bit.  Still, he ate the entire bowl!  Used white onion instead of red, as that is what was on hand.

I converted my husband to a chicken salad fan with this recipe! Added raisins and used some greek yogurt as another user recommended. Also used spicy honey mustard because it was all I had on hand, just added until it tasted right. Delicious and super quick to throw together for a week's worth of lunches!

I really liked the dressing a lot.  Too many grapes & apples.  When I make this again I will just cut back on both.

This is a good base for a sweet chicken salad. It tastes so good on croissant rolls with some sunflower seed sprouts! It's similar to the chicken salad sandwiches made in Chatter's (cafe in downtown Houston).

It turned out really well. I did two chicken breasts and shredded the chicken. I didn't use the grapes, I did add 3 stocks finely chopped celery. Used white onion and used two apples. Used a little more mayo to taste. My dad, mom, sister and boyfriend liked it. It tasted really good to me too.

This is so good and easy to make! I made this recipe exactly the way it stated, with the exception of the red onions.  I didn't have any, so I used about 1 tbsp. of round onions.  The only thing that would make this recipe better would be red onions!

To make it a bit more creamy I added another Tbsp of Mayo and a splash of milk. I really liked the flavor of honey mustard added to this. I also added about another half cup of chicken too.

I think it turned out wonderfully! I made homemade honey mustard to go with it, so I didn't need the extra mayonnaise. I definitely think it could use a little bit more chicken and maybe even some pecans. Like everyone else was saying, mixing the stuff with a sauce ahead of time really makes a difference. I ate it on a piece of lettuce and could definitely take this for lunch.

Awesome.  Ignore what you think about the garlic powder and pepper and just go with it.  Used Miracle Whip instead of Mayo just because I'm not a fan of mayo.

I ended up using a can of chicken breast since I was in a hurry to eat but it came out really well. I did not have all the ingredients. All I used was can chicken breast, celery, Apple, grapes, salt pepper and mayo.

This is a delicious and easy recipe.  I substituted a granny smith apple and dijon mustard, because that's what I had on hand.  I also added a few dashes of celery salt.  I used a rotisserie chicken, so this was all assembled in minutes.  This recipe is great for school lunches or a quick dinner. Thanks for the yummy recipe!

This is just what I was looking for! I had always shied away from chicken salad but I had an apple and some chicken that were just begging to be made into chicken salad! So glad I chose this recipe. It was great.  This is a keeper.

This lightly dressed is full of fruit with a surprising hint of mustard. I served it at a family gathering and everyone loved the unique flavor combinations. Use red grapes to add color. I added a bit of Poppy Seed Dressing for extra creaminess, additional poppy seeds and Sugar Coated Pecans. Curry Powder might also be good.

Excellent!  Don't change a thing and you'll be happy.  Or add some toasted pecans and Craisins, and maybe a little fat-free Greek yogurt to the dressing, and you'll be even happier.  Great recipe. Thanks!

My family liked this recipe. I used dijon mustard. I didn't have apples but I put some celery and red bell pepper with a dash of smoked paprika.
