For this recipe, I used Snapple Peach Tea and no-sugar-added frozen peaches. I did take a little under half of the peaches and a bit of the liquid and puree it, then added it back to the pan to make more syrup. I served this sauce over Rich Yogurt Waffles for a special Saturday breakfast--the kids flipped for it and I thought it was excellent. The flavor reminds me of peach pie filling my Grandma used to make.

As with all recipes I review, I followed this recipe faithfully.  If I make the recipe a 2nd time I might make a few adjustments that suite my preferences.  Excellent!  Four stars since it was a bit too sweet.  I enjoyed it with ice cream.  It was great served warm.  If you're a peach lover, this should be in your recipe box.

Followed exactly.  Had made a bunch of mini cheesecakes.  Used this as a topping, along with raspberry sauce, chocolate sauce and whipped cream.  Lots of variety.  This sauce is amazing, thanks.

Amazing and I love the zip that the tea gave it. I used an herbal peach tea and according to the box the first ingredient was orange peel - which I think gave it a wonderful tanginess. This recipe is a keeper exactly as it is, although I'm sure it could be tweaked lots of different ways and still turn out wonderful.

This recipe was so easy to make and it came out delicious!!! I'm actually making more now so I can freeze it in small batches to have on hand to put on everything imaginable.

Absolutely DELICIOUS!!!  I made it according to the instructions and it came out fantastic!!  The use of peach flavored tea was a brilliant idea in my book.   I used this as a sauce over homemade pancakes and got rave reviews from family and friends!!  This would be a wonderful topping over ice cream as well as a myriad of other foods!!  I will be making this again. . .and again . .and again!!

I didn't have peach tea so I used Bigelow orange spice tea.  I also used canned peaches with light syrup. I did not drain the syrup. I only had one can of peaches so I decreased the other ingredients accordingly. Even with less fruit it was enough for four people. This was so good on top of a Dutch baby that I made for breakfast.  The tea really gave it an awesome depth of flavor.  It would be  fun to experiment with other tea flavors like raspberry or lemon.

I was using ripe Colorado peaches so I cut the sugar to 1/3 cup each. Also added just a dash of salt to deepen the flavor palate. Excellent served over cheesecake made with ginger snap crust!

I didn't follow this recipe exactly, but mine turned out pretty well. The tea is a great base for this sauce. I just made a cup of peach green tea and let it cool. I substituted the corn starch for Xanthan gum. If you do this too start with much less - a little goes a long way- and whisk it in really well. I didn't have quite enough peaches so through in a mango . As others have said, the sugar is a lot so I only added about 3 tbsp. Will eat it over ice cream!

I substituted apricots because I had them, and used Gold Peak peach bottled tea.  After cooking the sauce, I spooned it on top of a wheel of Brie, then baked the whole thing and served it with crackers for an appetizer.  It was a huge hit!

It was OK, the sugar was a bit much and overpowered the peach taste.

Really simple and really tasty. Who could ask for anything more? Although I'll put a little brandy in it next time.

This was exactly what I was looking for!  I used this to top ice cream sundaes.  This was the right amount of sweetness and the nutmeg gave it just a bit more flavor to top it off.

So good and so easy. Made it to go with French toast (the Fluffy French Toast recipe on this site) and it was well-received by all. If you have any left over, it makes a great topping for vanilla ice cream, and also a great peach milkshake.

I served this over Angel Food Cake III from this site and it was delicious! I used Peach Snapple and fresh peaches and my gang loved it.

This turned out great. I used crystal light peach tea and frozen peaches I thawed out and chopped. I served it as a topping for peach bread but my husband wanted to eat it with ice cream or just plain out of the bowl. Definitely will make again.

I had some left over fruit in the fridge so used this recipe as a guide.  Halved the recipe.  Used two nectarines and one plum.  No spices or vanilla. And I used chai tea.  It was sooooo good.  We have used it for dipping potstickers, put it in oatmeal and on ice cream.  Shoot, I eat it right out of the jar!  Making another batch today.

Great sauce! I steeped the tea for 10 minutes. I also reduced the sugars  2 tablespoons each  because my fruit was VERY ripe.  I also used nectarines instead of peaches because they were on sale, but next time I'll use peaches.  I didn't measure 4cups fruit, just used the 6 nectarines I had on hand.

What a wonderful flavor.  I followed directions as they were written and was so pleased with the outcome.  I used the sauce over chicken and another time over ice cream.  The recipe made too much for my husband and me, so I froze some and I'll see how it is after thawing.  Delicious.

I used fresh market peaches and followed this recipe exactly (I even had the Celestial Peach Tea on hand) and it was SO GOOD. I served it over vanilla ice cream and the "GA Peach Pound Cake" from this site. I could see this sauce having so many uses. Very tasty.

I made it with frozen peaches that i had on hand. It was good but next time i'll reduce the vanilla. I think it was too much.

I halved the recipe as I only had 3 peaches, used peach mango white tea, halved the sugar and used cinnamon for the nutmeg. My son really enjoyed this served over Fluffy French Toast. Very tasty!

07-26-16 ~ Wonderful use of peaches! We brought home a box of peaches from Kentucky, so I needed to find some recipes to use them. I baked a pound cake to serve under these, rather than the submitter's suggested pancakes. Although, it would be great on pancakes or waffles. For us, the pound cake was perfect. I made a half batch using Crystal Light Peach Mango Green Tea as that is what I had on hand. Because my peaches were very sweet, I cut the sugar in half and will decrease it even more the next time. I know nutmeg can have a very strong taste depending on what it goes in. Knowing that, I just sprinkled a little bit in the peaches and it was plenty for us. This is a wonderful recipe and I can't wait to try the leftovers over vanilla ice cream. Even though I cut the sugar back and used less nutmeg I'm giving this recipe 5-stars and I look forward to sharing this recipe with my family and intend on making it again! Thanks gololly for sharing it!
