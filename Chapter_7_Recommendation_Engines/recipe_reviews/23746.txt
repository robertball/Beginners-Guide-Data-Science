Outstanding cookie.  A couple of hints I discovered.  Combine the granulated sugar and almond paste in a food processor first, until it looks like sand.  Place in a mixing bowl and mix in other dry ingredients and lastly add the egg whites.  Chill 20 - 30 minutes and use a small ice cream scoop to get uniform portions.  When rolling in almonds, flatten the cookies pressing into the almonds which helps them adhere to the cookie.  Forget oiling the pan and use parchment paper instead.  However, after removing from the oven, let the cookies cool at least 10 minutes before trying to remove.  The cookies harden and easily slide off the parchment.  If you have a shortage of pans, slide the entire parchment off the pan to let the cookies cool.

Update on original review (12/1/18)
I continue to make these cookies and always get rave reviews.  I have further added helpful hints, particularly for novice bakers.

1. I have purchased almond paste can be in 7 oz. tubes (Odense brand) and 8 oz. cans (Solo brand).  Donâ€™t worry about being perfect on the amount.  For half of the recipe (which I usually make) two tubes (14 oz.) or two cans (16 oz.) are both fine.  Difference in amount is negligible in taste and texture.
2.  When working with the dough after refrigeration, work with wet hands.  I re-wet them every 5-6 cookies which helps keeping the cookie dough from sticking to hands.
3.  I only make 1/2 recipe.  I use an ice cream scoop which measures 1 TBS.  The cookies, when placing on the

Without a doubt the BEST chewy almond cookie I've found!! My daughter and I thought we had tasted the best one in Europe on a recent trip but these are even better! Good tips .... begin by putting paste and white sugar in the food processor. Also beat egg whites to soft peaks before adding them and add them LAST. Also chilling the dough 30 min when assembled. Parchment paper solves any sticking problem and let them cool 10 min before remove to the wire rack.  They are DIVINE!!!!!

Excellent but dough is so sticky that it's better to mix in stand mixer and pipe out using a pastry bag into the sliced almonds.  Use a Silpat matt or teflon matt to bake on.  Cookies just slip off when done. I find the ones from the Italian bakery in Toronto seem to have a lot more flour so will add more next time.  Did add a bit of almond oil also.

Holy cow these were awesome.  I split the recipe in half and still got a about 36 cookies. Made them the day before and they were still great the next day.  I ran out of sliced almonds very quickly - halfway through (I was probably making the cookie s way too large) however, I just made the other half without them and they were just as good.  As a matter of fact I may do that again next time because I thoguht it made a good presentation to have both on a platter.  These are a little chewy but the contrast is nice - crispy on outside and chewy and soft on the inside.  As the recipe says, the dough is very sticky so just pop it in the fridge for a few minutes before working with it and that helps.

Excellent, Excellent, Excellent. Only thing I like to mention is when using egg white make sure they are @ room temperature and beaten soft peeks. Fold in with ingredients and when finally mixed together and if you still find chuck of paste, then my suggestion is with a rubber spatula press down the pieces until you don't see any chuck.

I've been making these for 6 years now and they are ALWAYS a hit! I use a Kitchen aid stand mixer and put the almond paste and egg whites in with the flat paddle and mix until smooth. I then add the white and powdered sugar and the flour and mix until blended. 
I put the sliced almonds in the blender or food processor to just "chop" them a little smaller (not powdery). I then, using two table spoons, drop spoonfuls of the dough into the chopped almonds, and roll them in the almonds until coated using the almonds to protect your fingers! I make them into crescent shapes. No sticky hands, no dirty pastry bags etc. I used to try to mix by hand but they were never mixed thoroughly. I've been using this mixer method for the last 3 years and they are always perfect. No chunks of almond paste and no mess!
I also ALWAYS use 1 cup of liquid egg substitute ( regular or whites) for the 8 egg whites...PERFECT,

These were so WONDERFUL!!! They remind me of the cookies available at a local Italian bakery (the Missouri Bakery in St. Louis).  I skipped the last step of rolling in almonds, and I also mixed the cookies with my electric mixer.  I was kind of nervous about doing so, but the cookies were fantastic!

These cookies are really special... they cook up crispy on the outside and so very chewy on the inside, and they keep that way for DAYS, if you can keep yourself from eating them.  My boyfriend's family is classic Italian and they grew up in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, where EVERYONE knows the "only" way to make something.  My cooking always seems to fall short, but when I brought these cookies over one day, the family raved that it was "better than the bakery" and they BEGGED me to make more.  His notoriously picky father called days later to request a batch.  Guys, no joke, these are a winner.  Make them to give as gift to anyone you're hoping to impress.  

Baking tips, chill the dough for 30 mins before rolling.  Use parchment paper.   If you buy sliced almonds, crush them up even smaller and you'll need more than the recipe says.  I like to flatten mine a little before baking.  If you don't, they come out a little boulder-shaped.  For a prettier cookie, flatten the dough balls before baking.  When they look a little underdone, they're done.  Good luck!!

These are excellent cookies. I followed the advice of David Spaulding and they came out perfectly. The processing, adding the eggs last, chilling 30 minutes, and using parchment paper were all great suggestions. These cookies tasted great and looked very appealing. I will make these again.

hello everyone. the flavor of this cookie is very mild and fragant, but not sweet and dense enough. can anyone tell me if i made these incorrectly? the batter is very very sticky and when i dropped the cookie into the sliced almonds, the batter basically "melted" into a blob and the almonds end up being part of the entire cookie, not just coating the outside. i followed one reviewers advice and put the batter in the fridge to chill for half and hour, but the batter didn't stiffen too much. i halfed the recipe to make 36 cookies, but ended up getting like 50-60 cookies using a teaspoon size like the recipe suggests. would appreciate the advice because i LOVE almond flavor and would like to try again.

Very yummy cookies...I used my Kitchen Aid mixer with the flat beater to mix dough...much easier.  I also chilled the dough and wet my hands with a bit of cool water before handling dough.  I think when I make them next Christmas, I will probably make my own almond paste!

The cookie was divine. I have tasted many a almond cookie over the years and these are about the best! Better than my Sicilian aunt's cookie. The taste definitely makes up for the extreme messiness in preparation.

Excellent Amaretti cookie recipe with half the effort.  Made my wonderful Italian Husband smile from ear to ear.  Great advice from David Spaulding - March 2006 as to blend paste with granulated sugar first then add rest with egg whites at the end.  Did not roll in sliced almonds as friends can not eat whole nuts.   Used 1 inch ice cream scoop & dipped in water before scooping dough & throughly shook scoop to remove excess water prior to scooping, made for easy removal of dough from scoop.  Only change to recipe -  might reduce the amount of sugar next time.   Would DEFINITELY make again

I had been looking forward to creating a batch of these due to the reviews it had been given, but I was very disappointed with the result. These cookies clung on like limpets to the baking trays. I cooked in very small batches after the first one came out glued to the cookie sheet - I baked in groups of four - and experimented with a more liberally greased baking sheet, baking parchement, more standing time on the cookie sheet after baking, less standing time on the sheet, a longer cooking time, a sorter cooking time..and finally I discovered that if I floured the sheet in addition to greasing it well, they came off a little easier, but still gave a lot of resistance and I ended up with plenty of 'casualties'. I think that if I were to make this again, I'd cook them on edible rice paper, so I could just cut the cookies off of the lining paper. The cookies themselves were quite nice warm, but once cold my family found them simply too sweet and quite flavourless. I also felt that they really did benifit from a coating in sliced almonds, as I made some coated, some uncoated and I felt the lightly toasted flavour really lifted the blandness of the cookie itself.

Just took a test batch of four cookies from the oven and have eaten two! They are yummy. However, I made my own almond paste - very simple to do and fresh, flavorful and frugal! Anyway, because the highly rated recipe called for egg whites as does this one, my dough is more like a batter, about the consistency of a cake batter. For my test batch I just dribbled some into the almonds and scooped the mess onto a greased parchment paper. They didn't stick however they are not a nice enough presentation to make it into my "Grown-up Christmas Cookie box". I am refrigerating the dough and will see if I can resurrect this one. The reason for three stars is because until you read about thirty of the reviewers you don't get all the tips and tricks to adjust the recipe and handling of the dough. One reviewer said to make almond paste with corn syrup instead of egg whites so you don't get a flat cookie! Well, who knew I should read back a decade to figure this out! There are a lot of other good tips in the reviews. So, I basically think someone should repost this recipe and incorporate the tips. Since homemade almond paste is so simple and a nice touch, the new recipe should be based on that as well. If I figure all this out maybe it will be me! If you are planning to make this recipe, do your self a big favor and spend about twenty minutes reading the reviews and taking some notes! By the way, I am not a novice baker so this critique is not pique!

Wow!  Wonderful flavour.  I find using a food processor to cut the almond paste to a fine consistent the easiest. Pour the almond paste into a large bowl and mix the rest of the ingredients in. I decided to keep the mixture in the fridge overnight and it helped retain the shapes of the cookies and keep the center very moist and chewy while the outside nice and crispy.  I used two spoons to shape the dough into a ball and drop each into a plate of sliced almonds.  I turned the dough around to coat all and slightly flatten each before putting them on a parchment lined baking sheet.  They were not sticky as mentioned in previous posts. This recipe has a big yield - at least 8 to 10 dozens very large sized cookies.

Oh my gosh, lethal!  I have never met a cookie I didn't like, but I LOVE these.  I made them for an Italian dinner party and served them with a fabulous jelato purchased from a local deli.  These were devoured in minutes and even my cookie-snob brother-in-law said he thought he was in Italy.

I did follow the suggestions from others, thank you.  I beat the egg whites to meringue consistency, added almond extract and baked on parchment paper.  These are so much easier than cut-out almond cookies and you can whip up a batch quickly with minimal kitchen mess.  Hide some back for morning coffee!  Thanks so much for this recipe.

Have made these several times and have tips to make it easier: 1) As David said, mix in the granulated sugar first. 2) Use parchment paper. 3) If you make your own almond paste, use the recipe that does NOT use egg whites but uses corn syrup instead. This will give the cookies the right texture. Too much egg white makes a runny cookie. 4) add a half teaspoon of almond flavoring to the egg whites before mixing. 5) After mixing everything, use one hand to dip the dough with a teaspoon; use the other to push into the bowl of sliced almonds. I find it easier to use just my pointer finger when rolling the dough in the nuts. Keep the spoon hand clean - you'll be much happier! These cookies are wasted on children - save them as a dessert cookie for guests. Guys love this cookie, too.

These cookies are my father's favorite cookie.  I make them in my Kitchen Aide Stand mixer and instead of using fresh eggs, I use Just Whites powder and the required water stated on the label, directly in the mixing bowl with all other ingredients (don't prepare in a separate bowl then add).  They come out perfect every time.  I also use a little ice cream/cookie scoop to drop the batter in the bowl of almonds slices.  By far this recipe has become the easiest cookies I make.

I used the suggestions made by David Spaulding and they turned out fantastic! Crisp outside and chewy inside - just how I like my cookies. I ran out of sliced almonds, so I may have excessively pressed them into the cookie dough but that's my mistake! Delicious! Will be making these again as I have a few friends that either are dairy-free or just don't like chocolate.

I come from a large Italian family and I have been wanting a recipe for Almond Paste cookies.  Well, this is it.  I use my Kitchen-Aid stand mixer and follow the directions exactly.  These cookies are phenomenal.  My family insists that they are better than the ones at the local Italian pastry shops.  This recipe takes a little bit of effort, but it is well worth it.

Great recipe.  Just to try it out, I used only one can of almond paste (8oz) and cut the remaining ingredients down by 3/4.  Turned out really well.  Will definitely be making more for Christmas!

WONDERFUL COOKIES!  I have looked high and low for this recipe and finally found it.  It was better than my local Italian Bakery!  I used a small melon scooper to get all the same size cookies, and eliminated me having to touch the batter.  Worked out beautifully!  This one is a keeper!  Thanks for the recipe!!!

This recipe tastes just like the almond cookies you find in an Italian bakery - which is exactly what I was looking for :)  Next time I make them, I'm going to roll only the "top" part of the dough in the sliced almonds, though.

Great recipe. I used a pastry blender and my fingers to blend the almond and granulated sugar before adding the remaining ingredients. I avoided the sticking problem by using butter on my fingers and scooper as well as the sheet pan. Nothing stuck at all. Under bake rather than over bake. They are simple and wonderful.

these are outstanding- my sis and I have been on the hunt for this cookie because we grew up on the east coast and had these from fine italian bakeries. for a really nice presentation- seperate portions of dough and dye them green and pink press a cherry in the middle and bake as directed. it looks beautiful to put out a plate of some plain- some with almond slivers and some with the halved cherry.

JEEZ, the almond paste is hugely expensive!  Cheapest I could find was $4.80 for an 8 oz jar!!!!!!!!  Just for that one ingredient, the cost was $18 - seems a little high to make 72 cookies!

A very fast easy recipe.  I made only half the recipe and had several dozen cookies.  Also, I ran out of slivered almonds so I used whole almonds coarsly ground in the food processor - not as pretty but more crunchy.

The recipe turned out to be a runny mess - no way to shape, drop or roll it at all.  I added more flour - didn't help.  I added oats.  Didn't help.  When I was finally able to thicken it with all the additional things I put in, it still baked to a flat mess.  I honestly have no idea how any of you could have followed this recipe and ended up with a cookie type batter that could be shaped or baked with a crunchy exterior and soft chewy interior.  Would just having whipped the eggs made all the difference?  I love almond cookies and was so disappointed.

This is an amazing cookie!  The one thing I changed was to use chopped (almost ground) almonds instead of sliced. I think they work better than sliced, because the almonds brown more evenly.  I chilled the dough, and then kind of dropped it into the chopped almonds and rolled the ball around, so I didn't have to deal with the stickiness.  I also did all the mixing in my food processor.   A friend made the recipe with sliced, and they just weren't as good.  It's a real winner!

I love to cook but am not a baker. Nonetheless, I made a batch of these cookies for the holidays and my mom and I spent HOURS shaping these sticky things. But, WOW, were they delicious with a pillowy soft center and a delicate flavor. I froze about half after baking (recipe made a ton) and defrosted them to great acclaim a week later. I bought the almond paste bulk from NutsOnline and weighed and measured it out, freezing the extra. Will be definitely making these yummy things again but count on taking a lot of time shaping them. Next year, I will put on my Charlie Brown Christmas CD and make a batch for presents! Thanks, great recipe!

hmmm, very good taste....BUT mine did NOT turn out even close to resembling the picture.  Mine were flat as a pancake, so I added a little more flour to see if that would help....nope....I am going to keep playing around with this...they are pretty darn tasty though!!

What a HIT!  My Italian friends loved these.  Expensive, but worth it.  I used a Mixmaster, starting with the dough hooks, then the beaters. I made 1 1/2 batches and used 5 c. sliced almonds, slightly chopped.  No problem with sticking using my baking stone.  Excellent flavor and texture.

I made these last year for Christmas and will definitely do so again!  My brother-in-law said that they were better than the ones from his favorite bakery.  ****UPDATE****  Having made these since 2002, I offer a few tips. 1) Break up the almond paste, and mix as thoroughly as you can into the dry ingredients first.  I break up into the flour first, then the sugars.  This makes hand mixing much easier in the end.  2)  Mixing with cold egg whites makes for very cold hands.  Let them sit out a bit.  3) Use a silicone baking mat.  They come off much easier.  4) Lastly, Mine this year took 29 minutes per batch in a 350 oven.  I have never achieved anything close to 15-20 minutes.  :)

My mom has talked about almond cookies ever since we had them on a recent trip to New York.  I'm so excited to give them to my mother tomorrow!!  What better way to say thanks for a great trip!! Thank you Cindy!  I dropped the dough directly from the spoon into the almond mixture then tossed the almonds on top.  I had no problem because I never touched the dough without the almonds on it.

we are lucky enough to have a very high quality greek bakery here in town. their almond cookies are simple and amazing, so i thought i would try my hand at fixing this recipe. 

i tried 2 different brands of almond paste, and frankly, i can tell no difference between batches. these came out wonderfully and so far, they have retained their freshness after almost a week in the fridge. 

people are recommending that the sugar and paste be blended together in a food processor. i did this, and i cant imagine trying to work the sugar in the paste by hand! what a bear that would be! the point being: yes, the processor was great suggestion! i also added the egg last.

I searched high and low for the best almond cookie recipe for a friend who loves all things almond flavored.  The taste of the cookie was excellent.  I found that 2 cups of slices almonds was not enough to "coat" as instructed.  For the second half of the batter/dough I had to just top them with almonds (more like the picture) but then they ended up sticking to my parchment paper which made for a few hollow cookies when the bottoms would get ripped out.  All this would be solved by having a ton more sliced almonds.  I will definitely make these again - they were a big hit!

These are terrific cookies. They remind me of Dutch Butter Letter. I too chilled the batter for 30 min or so, making it easier to work with. Rolling the cookies in the almonds give the a very pretty appearance. They look and tasted better than a bakery cookie!

This recipe is awesome!  It's easy and fast.  I have had to go home to Boston for the last 14 years to get almond macaroons this good!  They are a little pricy to make, but think of the money I am saving in airfare!!  Great cookies!  Thank you!!

This is such a great recipe, and it was alot easier than I thought it would be! I used parchment paper for each layer, which made it so easy to remove from the pan, then I used a candy making chocolate bar (Ghiardelli) and painted a thin layer on with a pastry brush.  They were perfect!! I will make these every year! Thanks

I thought these cookies were kind of candy-like, but who cares...they were AWESOME.  If you like a lot of almond flavor you will love these cookies.  The dough was EXTREMELY sticky and a bit difficult to work with, even after I greased my hands with butter.  I didn't mind because the cookies turned out great.  Oh yeah, I didn't have sliced almonds to coat them with but they turned out fine anyway.

Tasty but too chewy for me. Maybe because the almond paste I found was only 7 oz. not 8? I put a little more flour than what was called for to make up the difference. I even baked it a little longer on a baking stone to see if it crisped up more.

My foodie friend recommended this for a cookie exchange, and was quite happy with how they turned out, even for an amateur baker like me!  The recipe is simple, but the mixing is still a work in progress for me as I don't have a food processor to break up the almond paste, as the other reviews suggested.  My kitchen aid mixer gave up on me as the mix became too tough...so it did require some elbow grease.  The mixing was a labor of love, but boy IT WAS WORTH IT!  This is my new favorite cookie recipe!

So glad I read the reviews.  Thanks, everybody.  After making dough in food processor, I let it chill in refrigerator for one hour.   Sugar and almond paste in processor.  Eggs, 1.5 cups of egg whites from a carton, mine from Costco, in processor last.  I used a 1.5 inch meatball scoop and got 67 cookies.  Used Silpats on sheetpans.  Baked for 29 minutes. With the changes, five stars.  27 minutes might be fine. Will be making these again.

I've made these cookies at least three times now.  I followed David Spaulding's suggestions and they turned out great.  Everyone who has ever eaten these has raved about them.  I also drizzle melted dark chocolate over them like our Italian bakery does.
One thing that might account for the other reviews that said the dough was too soupy, the size of the eggs matters!  I used medium sized eggs the first two times, and jumbo the third.  Jumbo eggs made the batter too loose.  I actually put it in the freezer to stiffen it and this worked perfectly.  The batter keeps well frozen if you are making ahead.  I also freeze these cookies after baking, as soon as they cool,  if I'm making them ahead for an event.  Wrapped tightly and sealed they freeze really well.

This cookie is amazing, tastes just like the almond cookies I buy from our local Italian bakery! Working with the almond paste can be a bit frustrating if you've never worked with it before but if you follow some of the tips from the other raters you should be good to go. I'm stubborn so the first few times I didn't take the tips and tricks into account even though I had read them beforehand. *LOL* Really though running the almond paste through the food processor and then mixing all the ingredients with your electric mixer is the way to go. I refigerate the cookie dough overnight to thicken up then use my small cookie scoop to get the cookies onto the WELL GREASED cookie sheet and press the sliced almonds onto the tops before baking. I have started including these in my Christmas cookie tin assortment and it's become a fast favorite.

Excellent, flavorful, easy to make. I only had 4 oz of almond paste, so I used the calculator to adjust the amounts of remaining ingredients and it worked perfectly. I whipped the flour with the sugars, whipped the egg white separately and then added the almond paste and mixed it all by hand. It's a bit messy, but it's worth it. It made 10 cookies and we unfortunately ate them all as soon as they cooled off.

Has anyone made this with less sugar? Or is the  crucial for this cookie to come out right? I would really appreciate anyone's advice on this. Lots of great advice in the reviews so a BIG thank you to all who contributed. Really hope that someone or many people will help out with the sugar amount. I'm sure I'm not the only one wondering about this. Thanks in advance. Love all recipes.com!

I tried the recipe for Italian  almond paste but the cookie flattened into a gooey mess. I didn't have an actual batter. The recipe called for one cup of flour. I followed the instructions exactly. Why did this happen? I would like to try again. The cookie tasted great. Can I get some help please?

My husband LOVED these cookies....not to mention the rest of my family!!  I followed the others suggestions and refrigerated the dough and I liberally greased my cookie sheets with crisco and used a metal spatula to remove the cookies, because they do stick a little!!  Do not use wax paper as they DO stick even when greased!! (tested a few !!ugghhh!!! )  Well thanks for an awesome cookie recipe I will be making for years to come!!

A+ will definitely bake again. I made a half recipe and these are darn good. I beat the eggs to soft peaks as others have suggested, and used parchment paper. So good - they stick a little, but mine all came up fairly easily.

These cookies are a bit time consuming to make but they are fantastic. The only thing I did differently and i highly suggest is buy about twice the amount of sliced almonds to roll the dough in

Excellent, excellent cookie! These have become my go-to "wow them" cookies! I've found suggestions by others very helpful, especially about refrigerating the dough, using parchment paper, and letting the cookies cool for 10 mins. before trying to remove them. I also use about twice the amount of sliced almonds as called for, and toast them a bit first. Perfection!

Very easy to make, and I am not a baker. Just as described, chewy and textured,  and stay day one fresh for days. They are gorgeous when plated and make a nice homemade gift or great share at the office. You'll be a rockstar!

Exccellent - I cut down recipe to 15 cookies (I had 7 oz of almond paste) and baked for 15 min.  I also added 1/8 t almond extract.  Very chewy - with good almond flavor!

This cookies received 5 stars only because of corrections to the recipe. I have loved this cookie almost all my life, my first sample of one was on my first trip to Italy about 55 years ago, we used to go about once a year for two weeks in Rome, near our apartment was a bakery where I would every afternoon for our bag of 6 for about $3.00.  We are too old to travel much anymore but I still crave this cookie, last year I bought 6 cookies in North Boston for $15.00! So I had to learn to make them.  Thank you to David Spaulding for the hint about the Paste with sugar in the processor, that's a big help.  I have always known that about the only thing an unbeaten egg white is good for is going into an omelet, the white must be whipped first and added last!

I followed the advice of another reviewer and used the food processor to blend the almond paste and the sugar.  So much easier!  Other than that, I followed the recipe to the letter and I now have a new favorite cookie. They are so good!  I could eat the whole batch by myself,  but that would be selfish.  Give these a try, you'll be happy you did.

I've just finished making these and they have come out very nice.  I was however shocked at the cost of almond paste.  After buying two tubes (7 oz's) I went back on line to see if I could make my own.  I found several recipes that were very similar so I made up a batch of homemade almond past and used that.  I would also recommend wiping the egg whites to a soft peak.

Great ingredients, but the recipe seems flawed. I did mix in the egg whites last and chilled everything. The dough was never really dough but a goopy mess.  The cookies did not stand up but spread out very thin. I added another cup of flour.  This improved the texture, but took away from the flavor.  It would also be a plus if the recipe indicated the quantity.

DELICIOUS cookies! Very similar to pignoli cookies but with almonds, which are my fav.  Only suggestion is u for sure need more almonds to coat cookies about 3 cups. My husband loves coconut so i added coconut to a few of them, turned out great.

I don't get it. I made these twice and both times they came out flat. I thought it was because I didn't whip the egg whites the first time so I did that the second time until soft peaks and still they totally flattened like regular cookies.

I came across this recipe after looking for the same type of cookie I had bought at a bakery . I luv anything almond and soon after the bakery closed down so I came to this site in search of the same tasting one and found it. They have become expensive to make but I bake them every year for Christmas for family and friends and as requested I make half the batch w/out almond slivers. These are THE best!! Thank you!

My cookies looked nothing like the photo.  They were very crisp, tasty for sure, but not like the others said they would be.  I think another 1 cup of flour would have helped and it wasn't until the last few batches that I did add the flour, and it did hold together better, but still not soft inside or chewy.  It does make a huge amount though.

Just like my Italian Aunts made! Fantastic.
 I do want to point out covering the entire cookie with almonds is the key. No sticking. I did use parchment paper and they slipped right off. Thank you!

I made these cookies for the first time and they where a hit with all my friends.  All they could say when they took a bite was mmmm' sooo good, you must make these all the time.  I will be making these cookies all the time.
