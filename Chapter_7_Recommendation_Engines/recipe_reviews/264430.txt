Excellent, spicy and rich! Couple of changes: I did the yogurt marinade overnight to ensure the flavors were fully integrated into the chicken. Also, you MUST use oil (I used coconut) during the first sauté, something the recipe doesn't mention, and I very nearly ruined the dish as a result. Lastly, this produces more liquid than a typical tikka masala, so that second sauté really needs to go a solid 20 minutes to get the sauce to that gravy-like consistency that really makes for a good tikka masala.

My kids LOVED this—which is a huge surprise since they are normally reluctant to try new foods. I looked at a lot of tikka masala recipes, and most also had coriander, so I added 1/2 tsp coriander and I reduced the cayenne to 1/4 tsp. It came together quickly (although I thought it would take forever due to all the spices!) and was totally delish!!

I am lactose intolerant so I substituted the 1 cup heavy cream with one 13-oz can of coconut milk plus one T coconut oil. Also I used plain Greek yogurt instead of regular yogurt. ItI came out delicious, and my grown kids loved it too. I will definitely make it again.

I made this as written, and it was delicious! I think I will put this in my freezer meal set for quick dinners on weeknights. It should all bind together well to freeze, then cook in the InstantPot. Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious and easy. I used chicken thighs and substituted curry powder for the Garam Masala, and it was still fine. I served it over steamed cauliflower and jasmine rice.

This recipe is fantastic and the level of spice was perfect, although my teenage boys found it a bit spicy. It makes a lot of sauce so the amount of liquid could be reduced.

It is spicy but it is wonderful.  We had pita bread with this as well as a spicy cauliflower cracker.  I will make this in a rotation for sure.  It is a keeper.

I liked it a lot.  I agree with the person that said that it had the same taste that you get at a restaurant.  Found the amount of pepper added just right.  I would like to make it again but use fish instead of chicken.

I found this to be slightly spicier than I like - my tongue glowed but it wasn't so hot that I could not enjoy the rest of it..  I will make it again and adjust the spices.  Three others who had it really liked it as it was so maybe I am a wimp.

Will definitely make this again.  Slightly spicy, I thought it mellowed the second day.  Had the taste of a restaurant dish

I did not like this version of the recipe. The flavor was not what I expected from a tikka misala. I used half the cayenne pepper and it was the right spiciness. The recipe makes way to much sauce and it did not thicken with sauteeing.

Tip: let it cool down overnight and absorb flavor for maximum taste.


Straight out of the pot, it was fine but slightly bland.

After sitting overnight in the fridge, the flavor really kicked in. Absolutely delicious.

This was great!  It was a little spicy for my taste, so I may reduce the cayenne pepper next time.  Definitely will make this again.
