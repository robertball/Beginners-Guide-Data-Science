I'm not usually a fan of sweet salads but this one was pretty good.  Still, next time I think I halve the honey, replacing the missing half with an equal amount of soy sauce, to reduce the sweetness and increase the "Asianness" of the flavor.

Wow!  I've already made this 3 times, and just got the recipe less than 2 weeks ago!  Family wiped out whole bowl the first night, and asked I make again for the next night!  Very easy - once you have those ingredients on hand, it is so fast to make.  I took a whole jar of peanuts and chopped them (food processor) and put them back in the jar to keep handy!  I put a little Cilantro in too one time, and that was tasty too!  A great dish!

THis was good.  I cut back on the honey, added sesame seeds instead of peanuts like one reviewer suggested, and I added a bit of ginger.  I will be making this again.

Brought this to a party and it went over REALLY well. I added 2 tablespoons of a chili garlic sauce (from the Chinese food area of the grocery store) and instead of salt/pepper - added some Mrs. Dash - about a heaping teaspoon. This is a keeper recipe - and VERY easy as well.

This was a great tasting, easy to make salad. I ended up making it twice in one weekend - at the request of my sons. The only changes I made were to sprinkle toasted sesame seeds over the salad instead of using the peanuts (I'm not a big peanut fan), and the second time I made it I used a less lime juice.

I made this recipe exactly as written except that I substituted an equal amount of shredded green and red cabbage and shredded carrot for the coleslaw mix to save money.  The coleslaw was okay, not my favorite and I likely won't make it again but it was good enough to round out dinner.

Made this exactly according to the recipe, and I just didn't think it was that good. I love thai food and I made it as an accompaniment to a thai dinner. After taste testing it, I decided not to inflict it on my boyfriend. The fish sauce makes it taste vaguely funky, and the flavors don't sparkle and pop the way I think they should in a Thai salad.

This is a really good recipe and easy to customize to suit your taste. I made it many times in the past two years. My usual tweak: I do not buy fish sauce just for this recipe - substitute with soy sauce; no funky taste, and if you want the slaw taste more salty, just add a little more soy sauce. 
I do not use salt at all in this. If no honey, can use brown sugar; if no peanuts, I use sesame seeds. If no lime juice, I use lemon juice. Every time it comes out delicious!

Super easy. I replaced one of the tablespoons of honey with soy sauce. One of the tablespoons of sesame oil I replaced with sesame oil with chili to give it some kick. I added sesame seeds instead of peanuts and grated fresh ginger in it. I know you shouldn't rate unless you stick to the recipe, but it's a great base and is easy to tweak to your tastes. I made it to use on Korean BBQ tacos.

this had a pleasant flavor and was easy to make. However, if I make it again I would add other ingredients for sure -chopped ginger, serrano, mango etc. Will search for a more complex recipe. But glad I made it, simple and easy, nothing fancy.

I made dressing as prescribed with a small addition of 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes.  Cabbage and grated carrots were substituted for the vegetable mix.  Peanuts (salted) were left in their purchased state.  I added all dressing to salad mix, but after marinating for 15 minutes, drained dressing from salad thus leaving a small amount of dressing.   Just prior to serving (at a potluck) I added about 3 ounces of shrimp.  Attendees requested recipe!

Delicious and super easy!  I followed others' suggestions and added a tablespoon each of soy sauce and asian chili-garlic sauce, and I also added cilantro.  I disagree with some reviewers' comments that it was too sweet or fishy - I didn't find that to be the case at all.  This was easy and a nice healthy substitute for mayo-based slaw.

This coleslaw is quick and easy to make.  I had read the reviews and noticed comments about sweetness so I halved the honey.  I also added a teaspoon of chili paste as suggested.  I have made this twice and forgot the chili the second time.  It was better with the chili. We really liked it and I made if for company and they liked it too.  I will make this many times over summer because I don't have to worry about mayonnaise spoiling.

Pretty tasty, but there's way too much rice wine vinegar in my opinion. Start out with 2Tbsp and keep adding as needed.

I love thai food, but I did not like this recipe. The ingredients do not go well or pop. I made this twice to give it a fair try. The second time I incorporated some of the suggestions. I still did not like it. So glad, I had the ingredients on hand. It would have been more of a dissapointment if I purchased the ingredients just for the recipe.

Very tasty! I can see how some people may not like this because of the fish sauce taste (so if you don't like fish sauce, you should use another recipe). I did add some cilantro and chili sauce for more flavor. I will definitely use this recipe again.

We really liked this, I'm surprised at some of the bad reviews.  However, I made it at the last minute, and didn't have any fish sauce, so just skipped that part.  I'll definitely make this again!

This did not turn out as well as I expected. I place the blame for that squarely on the shoulders of the packaged coleslaw mix - as a rule really it shouldnt be used unless you have zero time to cook.

Just okay. Needs some onion or something. I added chili garlic sauce, but it still needed something. I also only used maybe 1/2 of the dressing. Definitely recommend adding a little at a time to your liking, or else it's drowning in dressing.

We didn't care for the sour, fishy taste of this cole slaw. Maybe it was the brand of fish sauce I used. Oh, well, there are plenty of other salads out there.

This was very bad.  Their was too much liquid for only bag of one coleslaw mix, and was very tart.  The flavors did not blend well at all.  Would not recommend this to anyone.  Boyfriend said "tastes like ".

I only followed the recipe in that I mosly used the ingredients in the dressing, somewhat to scale as the recipe is written.  I used brown sugar in place of honey and only enough to balance the acidity of the lime juice and vinegar.  My dressing was not sweet.  I didn't measure anything but attempted to maintain proportion.  I cut green cabbage and grated carrot plus cilantro and chopped carrots.  I put a teaspoon or so of peanut butter in the dressing as well to help it emulsify.   Probably used a bit more fish sauce (megachef brand- it is stinky, and allegedly "sweetened" but i find it adds great flavor, especially at its price point) and held back the lime a bit so that lime flavor wasn't too obvious.  Toasted sesame oil (i always assume this is what a dressing recipe is calling for when it lists "sesame oil" in this sort of proportion) is very flavorful so I added it to the dressing in drizzles until it tasted right.  I suspect i was under the recommended dosage but not by a huge margin.  

I recommend making this to taste instead of adhering strictly to the recipe.  The dressing ingredients make a nice slaw dressing.  hack up whatever veg suits you and go to town.  I did miss bean sprouts (the store was out) which i like in this type of salad.

THIS IS SO EASY AND GOOD!

I gave this 4 stars only because I added some stuff to mine. On top of the easy recipe I added 1 tablespoon of Garlic Chili Paste and some fresh cilantro to give it a little bite. Other than that you could keep it the same and it is still amazing. It tangy  with just the right amount of sweet and salty with a little heat and the crunch from the peanuts is a surprise when you chew. It is definitely
out of my comfort zone of flavors and I am so pleased.

The lime juice is overpowering. Enjoyed the texture of the slaw.

This was just ok. I couldn't taste anything but the rice wine vinegar.

This "Quick and Easy Thai Style Coleslaw" recipe was delicious. I used freshly-chopped summer cabbage and freshly-grated carrot (instead of coleslaw mix) to make mine. I am convinced that different cooks are using the term "rice wine vinegar" to mean different things. I assumed the term meant "mirin" (and not rice vinegar which is made from rice wine). Mirin is much milder than rice vinegar and slightly sweet. I cut the honey by half since we don't eat many sweet foods in our home and found that it was still more than sweet enough for our tastes. Thank you TOPROCKMAN for sharing your recipe.

This is exactly what I was looking for!  I didn't change a thing to the recipe, it was great as is.

Very good! Nice change from the traditional creamy cole slaw made with mayonaise and much healthier.
