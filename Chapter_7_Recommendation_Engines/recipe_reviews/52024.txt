I really like this but my peas wouldnt mush properly with the potato masher so I had to put them in the blender.  I really liked this because I had never had mushy peas before, but my mum said they usually taste different.

Nice recipe...great comfort food and really quick! I paired these with "Baked Lamb Chops" (by Leslie)...dinner in 30 minutes or less!
Try adding a splash of white or malt vinegar - awesome.

Very good!  A college bound friend of mine helped himself to three servings!  I served them as a side dish to the Bangers and Mash recipe on this site.  I didn't add mint, because of the short growing season here, but the peas stood for themselves.

I love peas but, I thought this recipe was not so great. Maybe I just don't like mushy peas? I don't think I will be making this again but, I encourage everyone to at least try it once before deciding.

This recipe was just ok for me. Not bad, but not really the authentic taste I was looking for. True mushy peas are meant to be made with marrowfat peas, so maybe that would have helped. For now I'll stick with the canned versions from the British grocery store.

This dish was lacking in flavor, but I'm not sure what it was missing. It wasn't bad, but I'm not sure I would make it again.

As in all "mashed" or "Mushy" peas, the main ingredient should be reconstituted split or dried peas. There is a really big taste difference. Fresh peas tend to be a lot sweeter than the dried variety and have a different constituency. However, for a quick version, or you don't have time to reconstitute the dried variety, this is not bad.

Loooved this recipe,making it for the 2nd time this week and added plain yoghurt for the creamy effect, a blender works far better than a potato masher,  just make the distinction between mushy peas and peas puree and easy on the onions, paired mine with pan fried chicken breast and black pepper sauce -meal in 30 min!

I agree with another reviewer, mushy peas should always be made with either pre-soaked Marrow Fat Peas which turn mushy with boiling or you could also use my preference which is split or dried split peas, never with  fresh or frozen peas which have a totally different taste. I like to use the green or yellow split peas, traditionally placed in a pudding bag (or a lint free square of cotton leaving room for the peas to expand....tie the top closed with some string) and add to boiling water, stock or even a soup pot, as long as there is lots of fluid to cover.   When peas are soft turn the peas into a bowl (the peas should plop out of the bag in a soft ball the consistency of dense mashed potatoes.  Mash with a generous helping of butter, salt and pepper.  Known in Maritime Canada as Peas Pudding (mostly yellow split peas) but cooked the same way the green split peas are served with fish and chips and called Mushy Peas.

These aren't mushy peas. Creamed, or mashed peas, but not mushy. The taste is completely different.
Mushy peas are made with a dried legume called Marrowfat Peas which after soaking with baking soda and boiled water overnight, they are rinsed and fresh water added. Then cooking makes them mush-nothing else is required. Maybe some salt, but that is it!
