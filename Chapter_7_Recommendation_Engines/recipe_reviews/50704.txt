I'm sorry to say this recipe was awful! Maybe it's an acquired taste but no one in my family could finish their servings.

I'm wavering between 2 and 3 stars with this. I'm giving it 3 because that's what my husband says. My son (14) refused to eat the noodles because part of one of them was 'crunchy'. There's not enough sauce with this.. or at least not when it's just poured over the top. Next time I'll dice the hotdogs and mix the noodles hot dogs and sauce. I also added more onion (chopped 1 onion) than called for. I might add a can of chopped tomatoes next time and perhaps a bit of hot sauce. Also the sauce was just "ok" in my book. The main draw for this dish is that it's quick and easy.

This was ok but not fabulous. This is noodles with hot dogs and BBQ sauce. Very tangy but for me not unpleasant. I do think it needs vegetable like some cooked broccoli and cream cheese stirred in to the sauce

This was all right - nothing special. I made it exactly as written using sea salt in the pasta water medium egg noodles and light brown sugar in the sauce. Looking at the ingredients I thought the recipe sounded slightly odd and it proved to be so. It tasted okay (and I'm glad I used good-quality beef franks) but I don't know if I'd make this again.
