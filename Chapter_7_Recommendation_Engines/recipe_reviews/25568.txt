This recipe is very nice, although it's a little bit plain. I recommend adding about a 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg. I use medjool dates which, as far as I know, are the moistest and sweetest, and I'd recommend putting 1 1/4 or 1 1/2 cups of dates instead of 1 cup (if you love dates). I put 1 cup whole wheat flour and 3/4 cup white flour, which I think makes it less pudding-like and more cake-like. I also make mine in an 8X8 inch pan, so I cut the bake time down to 35-40 minutes, and I even put the temp down to about 390 instead of 400. It comes out really nice. It's still sort of plain and not very sweet, but if you like that kind of thing, you'll like this.

This is one of the easiest recipies I have tried. No gadgets to get out, no whisking, no mess. Just mix and bake, and perfect results every time. Lovely luke warm, but even better straight from the fridge. I put the cake in the fridge to cool, then slice it with a really sharp knife, as it may crumble if not really cold. Then have a slice when you fancy. Fantastically firm and morish without being too hefty. I have deviated from the recipe at times and added more fruit, like raisins and  dried apricots. The apricot one was a winner. I think it is because of the soaking period, and I have soaked it for up to an hour at times, making it really moist. Doubling the amounts, I get three small bread loaf tins out of it, excellent for freezing. My favourite!

This cake/pudding is one of the best date loaves we have tried. It has the added bonus of no eggs  or cholesterol which is important being on a low cholesterol diet.  I often serve it for dessert, warm with maple syrup and either low cholesterol cream, custard, low fat icecream or yoghurt.

I was skeptical because it looked too easy, but I pushed on ahead as I had some self-raising flour to be used up.

I am so glad I did.  This recipe was THE BEST... next time I have people over I plan to serve this warm as a dessert with a dollop of thick cream on the side.  The house smells fantastic as it cooks, to boot!

Delicious and simple! The recipe tolerates lots of changes - mix'n'match the fruits to your taste. I found the centre of the loaf sunk slightly and looked a bit sticky and uncooked when it was in reality perfectly done. I tried replacing some of the flour with oat bran and psyllium husk to increase the fibre, with truly EXCELLENT results - it added a bit of nuttiness to both the flavour and the texture. As usual with sweet recipes on this site, I reduced the sugar content as a matter of course.

What a wonderful date loaf.  I've been makeing this almost every week since I've tried it.  Its so easy to make and very tasty.  I add chopped nuts along with the dates to give a little crunch.  Microwave this and add a little butter.  YUM!!

I loved this cake.  I was looking for something healthier and low in fat and this was really yummy.  And I'm not even particularly crazy about dates. It was super easy (I bought the dates already chopped) and I agree with the other reviewer--it made the house smell amazing.  I will make this again soon!

This recipe is truely fantastic, not only does always turn out moist and rich in flavour, but its not expensive or hard to make. I've made this for friends and family and you can have it sliced cool with butter or serve it hot with a toffee sauce and ice cream!

This recipe was fantastic! I modified it a little. I added an extra 1/2 cup flour, an extra 1/2 cup dates, 1/2 cup pecans and baked it for only 30 minutes.

My family and I loved this recipe!  It was very moist despite the low fat content, so I am going to push the envelope further and substitute applesauce for the butter next time.

The cake was very good and healthy. I made some substitutions and scaled to 1/2 instead of self raising flour used 1/2c all purpose flour and rest whole wheat flour, then white sugar as brown sugar was not there. It is really healthy as wheat flour was added and iron rich dates. Thumbs up!!!!

I truly don't see why everyone loves this-sludgy and pretty much tasteless except for the dates.   I tried it because I had a big tub of dates and self-rising flour left over from another recipe, but this one is NOT going in my file.

I found this dried out very quickly, perhaps because it's relatively low-fat and is baked at a high temperature?  Not bad, rather sweet, I think there are better recipes for date loaf however this would be good for those who don't eat eggs.

This was really good when I added nuts and chocolate chips! I could see how it would be boring without them! I’m trying to eat more dates since I am in my third trimester of pregnancy! The recipe couldn’t be any easier. Yum

I tried this recipe and simply loved it. I replaced 1 1/4 cup flour with 1 cup flour and 3/4 cup wholemeal flour. I also added a 3/4 cup of chopped pecans for added crunch. The result was simply mouthwatering date loaf. I was so thrilled with it I immediately made another date loaf :))

Sorry but this is not as flavourful as the old Good Housekeeping date loaf recipe.
