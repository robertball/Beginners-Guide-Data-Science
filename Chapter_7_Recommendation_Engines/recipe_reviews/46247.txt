I haven't made this particular recipe but I have been making one similiar to it. I read the reviews and a lot said it was too oniony and not enough pecan. I actually use more onion and spinach but instead of chopping the onion and only cooking til tender, I caramelize the sliced onions first with butter or olive oil and a pinch of sugar. Then add the spinach, omit the water, then add pecans. The sweetness of the caramelized onions works really well with the nutty flavor of pecan and the spinach absorbs both flavors. My 2 yr old and 4 yr old love to eat their spinach this way!

this tasted really good but made as is it would only serve 2 and is pretty onion-y. I would recommend doubling the amount of spinach and leaving the other measurements the same. This would make a wonderful "bed" for sauted chicken breast.

We loved this recipe!  I omitted the onions and substituted whole garlic cloves like Carraba's does (I think I spelled that right).  Look out Popeye!

This was very quick and easy. My husband was hoping it would have a stronger pecan flavor.

This turned out great, but I did make some changes.  I caramelized the onions and then removed them from the pan adding them back to the spinach after it was cooked.  Instead of water I cooked the spinach with a mixture of chicken broth, oyster sauce and sesame seed oil.  The pecans were delicious and added a nice crunch.  We will definitely make this again!

Really tasty! Definitely add more spinach. They wilt and come down to almost nothing. I used almost a whole bag, less water and more pecans.

Omit olive oil and used butter to caramelize the onions and also threw in a clove of fresh garlic added a slice of pre-cooked bacon(what's not good with bacon, right!) threw in spinach once wilted flavored with salt and pepper and added the pecans....yum! I usually make spinach with olive oil and garlic but this is full of different flavors and a keeper!

This is good. I decided to toast the pecans and top the dish with them as other reviews wished for more of a pecan taste. That worked for me. Used a tad less onion and decreased the water to a Tbs.

This recipe was good but it did not have as strong a pecan flavor as I would have liked.  My fiance, who does not like pecans, actaully enjoyed it.  So for pecan lovers, I would suggest adding some more pecans.

I agree that it needs more spinach, less onion, and more pecans! But the flavors are great. It makes a really good side dish.

Great new idea for serving spinach. I used more more spinach and pecans for the one onion, and carmelized the onion as others have recommended. I'll make this again.

I made this recipe as stated and it was tasteless and practically inedible. I had a chicken breast seasoned with onion salt and garlic powder and much more pecans then the recipe called for, and then it was just passable. I will not make this again and my opinion is it should be removed from your website. It is just spinach and onions people!  I tried to give it a zero rating, but the website wouldn't allow it.

Needs a little salt. But very good especially with my garden fresh spinach!

I found this recipe - if cooked exactly as described to be too watery.
