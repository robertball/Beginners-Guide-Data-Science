was skeptical due to "sparse" ingredients... but made it for 2. Used 1/2 butter & 1/2 olive oil for frying then used brandy/milk to deglaze the pan prior to pouring over chix. sprinkled Parm on top. Baked 45 mins @ 350. Tender moist chix wonderful taste & texture: whisked a little milk into the gravy to stretch over Egg Noodles. Definitely NOT for those who like hot spice/kick... but for those of us who like good old filling comfort food it's an absolute winner!!! But adding your favorite "heat" to kick it up would be E-Z! Might add a touch of dill weed next time... (and there WILL be a next time!!)

Really liked this idea because of the little bit of prep work and I thought I had all ingrediants on hand. I used MelCole's idea and did the butter/Olive oil instead and deglazed the pan w/the sauce as well. I was short about 1/2 cup of milk so I tossed in about 2-3 tablespoons of sour cream while deglazing the pan and it added such a nice flavor. Other thing that changed in mid-prep was I only had bonless chicken tenders not breasts they were still wonderful! But I reduced the cook time from 60mins to about 45 and it was perfect. Didn't have noodles but side of Mac&Cheese went awesome. Definately doing this one again and again and again!

A little bland but if you mix it with some good comfort food it could be a hit with your younger family members. Must cook chicken long enough in the oven to absorb some of the flavors and moisture....really really moist which is fantastic. Will try again but may add some seasoning to pop a little flavor out of it next time.

The chicken tasted just fine but my sauce curdled during the baking process.

I followed the recipe exactly and while the chicken was nice & moist the dish had absolutely no flavor. My 14-yr old asked if I forgot "the seasoning" and then doused it with tons of salt & pepper. Hubby said "well at least the chicken is moist". I was so disappointed - I really wanted to like this dish as it was easy & I could have used another go-to chicken dish:(

This is a mild chicken dish. I cut the chicken breasts into medallions and seasoned the breasts before flouring. The sauce had separated on me so I tried whisking the sauce vigorously but it still didn't come out the creamy smooth that I was hoping for. Next time I will pour the sauce in the blender. I cooked the medallions for half the time (30 minutes) and they came out perfect: moist and tender. Added note: my husband just informed me that he took the leftover chicken medallion and microwaved that and the sauce and put it on a hamburger bun. He said it was the best chicken sandwich.
