I think the way this recipe is written should receive 3 stars,  but I think with a few changes, it would be 5 stars (so I split the difference and gave it 4).  Here is what I did.  First, I cut the recipe in half as there were only 3 of us eating it (and one of them was a 2 year old).  I sauteed the onions in the butter and while they were cooking, I put the cubed squash in the microwave for 3 minutes to par-cook it.  Then I added the squash to the pan with the onion, added 1 Tbsp of brown sugar, salt, cayenne pepper and some craisins.  Cooked that for a few minutes covered then added the toasted pecans and served.  The end result was really, really good and we will make this again for sure.

We have been making this recipe for a while, and love it. The changes I always make are: 1)microwave the cubed squash for about 5 minutes before it goes into the pan...makes it cook much faster, and more evenly; 2)add craisins...makes it pretty and delicious; 3)sprinkle on a little cinnamon and a tiny bit of cayenne. We really love this dish. Try it!

I have never cooked a squash in my life and halfway through trying to chop through the darned thing without losing a finger I decided that this was one recipe that I'd never make again.  Its just not worth losing a limb over, you know?  But after the dust had settled and I had my first bite of this amazing concoction, I had to change my mind.  THIS IS DEFINITELY WORTH LOSING A FINGER. Maybe even two.  This was absolutely delicious! I highly recommend following the recipe and using toasted pecans, fresh parsley, and butter - you won't regret it.  
Thank you, Christine L.!!!!

This was a great recipe.  I have only tasted "sweet" squash recipes before, and didn't really like them.  I cut the butternut in half and put a little butter, olive oil, and s&p on and baked at 400 for about 30 minutes.  This made it very easy to peel and cube.  Then added to the onions etc. and just sauteed til totally tender.  Delicious.

I've served this dish every Thanksgiving since 2003 and it's always a hit. Make it as-written the first time and then adjust if you see fit.  It's delcious as-is. Here are some simple things you can do to make this dish a success with less work:
1) Buy the pre-cut butternut squash--your pieces will be the same size and will be more likely to cook evenly.
2) You can't always substitute dried parsley for fresh and you shouldn't in this dish.  It won't be as good, so don't blame the recipe and rate it lower if you do this and don't care for it. Use FRESH!
3) Microwaving the squash first to par cook it as another reviewer mentioned is an excellent idea. But, if you don't, no worries. Stir frequently and keep covered...lower your temperature if it starts to stick or cook too quickly. Lower and slower works well for me. It's ok if some of the pieces cook more than others, it gives it a creaminess that my guests enjoy.
4) If you use a nonstick skillet, you can reduce the amount of butter, it's a very buttery dish.

This recipe was very easy and amazing.  I added a little bit of ground ginger and ground coriander to the butter before cooking the onions.  Also, I recommend serving this with freshly grated cheese on top.  I used asiago and parmesan.

I made some health-conscious changes (margarine instead of butter, fewer nuts), added some dried cranberries for color and texture, coarsely chopped my onion, sprinkled on a light dusting of cinnamon, and used dried parsley (all I had).  The recipe turned out very good, and the presentation was very aesthetic.  The contrast of orange squash, deep red cranberries and a hint of green parsley is beautiful.

Excellently memorable. Hubs and I travel extensively which means we eat in many, many restaurants all over the country. I can say with experience that most restaurants don't take the extra steps as this recipe does with the "lowly" vegetable. Beautiful in its simplicity, this is fresh and flavorful, not loaded down with tons of spices, sugar or any of a myriad of other distracting additions.  The cooking method is different but easy - peeling the squash is no big deal with a simple vegetable peeler, no more difficult than peeling a potato. I added a bit of fresh sage and minced garlic but otherwise stuck to the recipe as written.  Beautiful with its brightly colored chunks of squash contrasted with the toasted nuts and flecks of green parsley. The "lowly" squash doesn't take a back seat with this recipe!

The combination was unexpected and fantastic.  I substituted walnuts because they were cheaper than pecans and added a teaspoon of vanilla.  The vanilla really complemented the squash

Usually I cannot follow a recipe, but I did for this one and it paid off!

Using an acorn squash instead, I baked it so that the flesh was soft, and therefore, the dish was more of a squash mash. I added dried cranberries on someone else's recommendation, and I think it was this touch that put it up to a 4 star rating for me. The nuts are awesome, especially with the cranberries and parsley. Excellent!

Ynmmy!  I found the topping to be too sweet for my taste, so next time I will cut the amount of sugar by 1/3 to 1/2.  I will definately make it again.

I usually just cut 'em in half, seed them and bake them but wanted to try something new.  Didn't have pecans, so I used pine nuts.  Delicious!

I really liked this recipe.  I especially liked the fact that I could prepare it early and then heat just before the meal was served.  Great flavor!

Very good. Thank you for the recipe.
 May I add something for those of us who do the cooking.---For the squash--stick a sharp knife into it several places thru the skin & put it in the microwave for a few min. It will get a bit soft THEN  slice into 1" or so rounds  THEN peal. It will save a lot of time!!!

Great comfort food!  I kept the same ingredients, but just fried everything.  I left out the parsley.  Delicious!

Great comfort food!  I kept the same ingredients, but just fried everything.  I left out the parsley.  Delicious!

So delicious! I nuked the squash in the microwave for 10 minutes or so to soften it so it wasn't so hard to peel and chop. I also let the onions caramelize a bit. A real hit! I never know what to do besides mash w/butter and salt (I hate squash/sweet potato recipes with sweet ingredients) and now I have something new! Thanks!

I was skeptical, but took a couple of reviewers' advice, added the ginger and coriander to the cooking onions, then a splash of apple cider vinegar to the batch when I added the squash. I also added a touch of cinnamon, and cooked it for 5 extra minutes with the pecans to blend the flavors a little more. I served it as a pasta dish with 1/2 c pasta to 1 c of this per serving. It was amazing!! I think next time, I will try it without the apple cider vinegar and cinnamon.

I followed the recipe, just added some olive oil with the butter, and I cooked it for a half an hour instead of 15 minutes because I like the squash real soft, it was fabulous, the onions got carmelized and I  got rave reviews from visiting family members, it like melts in your mouth.

Wonderful and easy with only a few ingredients! It's hard to believe this recipe is good for you...it tastes so decadent. The only hard part was cutting the squash....I think next time I might microwave it for a few minutes before trying to cut it up (to soften it a bit)

Outstanding way to prepare Butternut Squash.  If you are a Sam's Club or Costco shopper, they have 2lb trays of precubed squash this time of year. This makes preparation non-existent.  If you can, substitute a couple of good sized shallots for the onion.  Otherwise, don't change a thing. Great way to prepare squash.

Only change I made was based on what I had on hand: dried parsley, not fresh.  This was lovely!  my husband really doesn't care for nuts in his food but still enjoyed this one!  Will make again for sure!

Delicious, and a nice alternative way to fix squash. Could have had some protein with it to make it more filling for a bigger meal - maybe some chicken?

I've been looking for new veggie recipes, and this one is excellent!  I added craisins, cinnamon, and cayenne pepper as suggested.  This dish was colorful and full of flavor!  We'll be making this one again and again!

This recipe is very good.  I ended up slowly sauteeing it for a long time, and it was tender and tasty.  It was easy to adapt to my tastes; I like some salt and pepper.  Next time I make it, I think I'll add some ginger, too.  To peel the squash, I cut it in half the long way (stem to blossom) and after cleaning out the seeds, I laid it down, cut side down and cut it into 1 to 2 inch wide slices.  I then was able to slip a paring knife under the skin and remove it quickly.  It only took a few minutes to peel it that way.  I'll definitely make it again.

The in-laws had me find/print this recipe for them and the Thanksgiving crowd LOVED it! My father in law mentioned that he wouldn't want to cut the squash for a living, but the end result was a huge hit, even for the "picky" eaters!

This recipe received the highest reviews from my DH (who grew up hating squash) and 5-yr old son (who has never shown an interest.)  DH told me "Never change a thing!"  The crunch of the pecans, sweetness of the sauteed onions and slight contrast of parsely were perfect.  It was cooked *slightly* unevenly, which I take credit for not stirring very often, but no one even cared about the 1/8 slightly harder pieces.  Not only will I make this again, I won't change a thing and have been threatened if I *don't* make it again!

Excellent! The sauteed onions and roasted pecans really make this dish.  Next time, I might try it with olive oil instead of butter (just to save on the saturated fat).

I love this recipe. I make it every Thanksgiving and always get great reviews. I always use fresh parsley and sometimes sub with walnuts if I don't have pecans. Easy to make.

I just made this recipe using the squash I had originally bought for fall decorations! Wow, am I glad I didn't pitch these out for the woodland critters to eat up. This is delicious!! A wonderful, nutty flavor and just plain great! I followed the recipe exactly and loved it. I used a potato peeler to peel the skin,  cut it in half to remove the seeds, then cubed it for cooking, very easy and I still have all 10 fingers!

I added the cranberries and pecans. I would make this again but just add less onion.

UNBELIEVABLE! I hate onions, yet I stepped out of my boundaries and took a chance on this one. WOW! The toasted pecans balanced it perfectly. I had to use a wok because of the amount of squash, and also added some brown sugar to the onions (to caramelize and sweeten a bit). I used this recipe with the marinated turkey breast, the cranberry rice, and the cranberry with toasted pecans recipes and it was AMAZING! My only fault was pairing it with a Cabernet instead of a Riesling... but next time for sure :)

One of the best butternut squash recipes I have ever tasted!  The pecans, butter, and onions make this a dish that is without equal!  Congratulations to Christine L.  You hit the jackpot with this one!

I think this recipe is great. Make sure not to overcook the squash and cut the onions up pretty well.  Since I am paleo-dieting, I used olive oil in place of the butter.  For presentation, I like to cut the squash into circles or half moons, instead of just cubes, but it doesn't matter taste-wise. I put probably a half teaspoon each of salt and pepper in there. I used walnuts because I didn't have pecans. I also didn't weigh my squash, I just used one squash, however much that is.  But everything turned out great, and I don't even really like squash, I was just trying it because I am trying to save money on paleo food and squash isn't too expensive. But this was so good, I couldn't stop eating it!

I followed the other reviews that mentioned the ease of par-cooking the squash in the microwave before adding it to sauteed onions.  I tasted the recipe after seasoning as directed and it was good, but I decided to add cayenne and cinnamon as others suggested and it put it over the top!  I made this when my parents were over and it was well-liked around the table!  Will make again with the cinnamon and cayenne for sure!

Besides preparing the squash (which is no small feat for a beginner), this dish was very easy and DELICIOUS! I made it over a month ago and my boyfriend is still raving about it. We ate it as the main course with a side salad, but next time I'll definitely make it as a side dish. I highly recommend it.

Good for a seasonal and colorful addition to your table. Not so sure about the make it 4 hours ahead part though as I find that the longer it sits, the browner and mushier it gets. Best served right from the stove to the table.

Absolutely DIVINE. Thank you for this wonderful idea. Allowed squash to cook slightly more than recommended because we like it soft, so texture and look was half cubed, half mashed. Delicious all round.

Had never tried Butternut Squash and this was the perfect recipe for first time.  Thanks for posting Christine. We can not eat pecans so after cooked added a little cinnamon - turned out great.  Used other posting suggestion to peel with veggie peeler before cutting and seeding and worked out great

Good recipe.  I followed the advice of others and parcooked the squash for 3 min in microwave.  I also added a tbsp of brown sugar towards the end.  I didn't have pecans but I'm sure it would've been great with them.  I will use them next time.

This dish is really good and I would serve it for company.  The toasted pecans really make the dish.  Be sure not to skip the toasting step.  I'm not sure that I will put the parsley in next time.  It makes it pretty, but I don't think added to the taste.

I cooked this tonight as a side with chicken. I added an extra half onion, omitted the pecans (didn't have any on hand), and used Smart Choice at half the amount called for of butter. I did microwave my squash cubes twice for four minutes each time and with 1/4 cup water in the bottom of the bowl to soften them a bit before saute. Everyone complimented me on them except my five year old but he only eats PB&J so we won't count him  :)

This is a great concept, but I felt that the onions were overpowering. I will make this again, and for my taste try less onion, or a milder onion. Thanks for the recipe! Tip: I found the squash easier to peel cut in quarters and placed standing on a cutting board. I also used a paring knife which was much easier to navagate than a peeler, or a larger knife.

Good recipe if you LIKE squash.  I was surprised by some of the negative reviews of people who thought the dish would be sweeter.  I did as another reviewer suggested and added a little ground ginger and coriander to the onions as they were cooking.  My whole family thought this was a delicious recipe for butternut squash.

This recipe was very good as is.  I served it to a group of friends, and it was a hit.  I made one very slight adjustment.  For the sake of time, after a few minutes of cooking on the stove top, I transferred the squash and onion mixture to a cookie sheet and roasted it in a 400 degree oven.  I did this so that it would cook faster because I was running late.  I did everything else as stated in the recipe.  I think it turned out delicious!

Yum! I followed previous suggestions and also sprinkled a bit of cayenne pepper, a healthy sprinkle of cinnamon and a few table spoons of brown sugar. My family loves this recipe, with or without, the toasted pecans which I always seem to forget.

The end result was very good. I tried the dish a couple of times while cooking, and found it to be very bland at first. A little more salt and the pecans were the final touches that it needed!

I find it hard to measure ingredients by pounds, so I used 3 cups of mashed squash to 1/3 cup of onions. I toasted the pecans in the micro wave but almost burned them.It was quite wet looking, so I baked it in the oven. My family realy liked it. I will probably make it again.

My family loved this.  I used 2 different kinds of squash, a butternut and an acorn to equal the      2 1/2 pounds. Nutty sweet flavor.  Will make next year,  if not before.

My family LOVES this recipe. I add more pecans than necessary, you can never have too many. This is just so fabulous. Quite filling, and is great for left overs, too!

I think that this would've be better if it were roasted in the oven.  I did add cinnamin and vanilla towards to end of cooking.  Then sprinkled red pepper flakes over my own serving.  Next time, I will not add extras and will roast it.

This was my first attempt at making butternut squash and it was pretty tasty. I added some cubed zuchini, a Tbl of brown sugar, 1 tsp of vanilla, and craisins. Without the additions I think it would have been fairly bland.

This was very tasty.  I am not very familiar with squash so I was thrilled to find such a tasty recipe.  I cut in half, seeded, rubbed with olive oil, salt and pepper.  Baked 400 for 30-35 min.  cut skin off and cubed, then tossed with the sauteed onions and butter.  At the end, added the pecans (loved the chopped kind - lots of little bits of goodies) - but didn't toast them.  i almost didn't add the pecans because I didn't want to waste them on something I wasn't sure I would like but they really brought it all together.  Salt a bit more at the end and YUM!

This is sooo good!!    I did not add the parsley as I don't care for it, but  a dusting of ground nutmeg when finished complimented the subtle flavours very well.

Very good.  Went over like crazy at Christmas dinner.  You can also cook these same ingredients in a roasting pan in the oven if you want.  Sometimes I add bacon ....its a vice!  :)

This was excellent.It did take more than 15 minutes to cook the squash, but I was making it ahead of time anyway so it didn't matter. I used about 1/2 cup of chopped pecans and 2 tablespoons of chopped fresh parsley and the flavor was great.Nice to have a dish that can be made ahead of time! It tasted just as good (possibly a little bit better) the following day as a leftover.

This had a wonderful aroma, but for me, the sweet squash with the onions wasnt somethng I wanted to eat too much of. It was a nice flavor, but after a few bites, was just too much.

Sorry, but there was too much onion in this to make it enjoyable, and I love onions!  The butternut does not have a strong enough flavor to hold against an entire onion; perhaps, if less was used this would taste better but I'm not using another 40 minutes of my life to find out.  Thanks for the interesting side dish though, always worth a try once :)

This was marvelous. I'm a squash newbie and realized after the fact that I had buttercup rather than butternut squash. The only other thing I changed was that I roasted the pecans in the skillet first instead of using the oven. Great blend of sweet and savory.

Good easy recipe.  After I peeled my squash I baked it in the oven while I toasted the pecans.  Nice alternative from a sweeter squash dish.

Very good. Use a sturdy vegetable peeler then slice and cube. Is best w/ butter but I reduced by a TBSP. When cooking butternut squash, be generous w/ the salt and pepper. I added garlic and at others suggestions, coriander, ginger, & parmesan. Is beautiful served over rice & paired w/ a green veggie.

I made this for dinner last night and thought it was really good. I did microwave the squash for about 5 minutes in a shallow dish of water to make it easier to cute. The only thing I would adjust is the amount of onion - I felt it was a little overbearing so I think I'll only use half the amount next time.

LOVE this recipe! I made it as part of my family's Christmas dinner last year and it got gobbled up. I did not like chopping the squash but the taste was worth it. Thanks for the great recipe!

The squash cooked unevenly (yes, I stirred it), and the whole dish was rather disappointing. Maybe it was the particular squash, I don't know, but I think I'll go back to the usual baked squash.

I tried dried parsley instead of fresh and did not like the taste of it.  I may have just added too much.  My mother-in-law didn't mind the taste.  I will not make this again.

A nice change from those sweet squash dishes. A few years ago my husband had a squash dish like this at a restaurant and fell in love with it. The restaurant has since closed and I've been looking around for a recipe similar to that legendary dish. This was pretty close.

I prepared this recipe exactly as the  recipe was printed even making it ahead of time and reheating it.  It was easy to prepare and before I tasted it I thought it would be bland but I was pleasantly surprised.  I am trying to add more vegetables to my diet and this one will be a keeper.  I served it with Cedar Plank Salmon and Italian green beans.  It was a perfect combination.  Great recipe. Thanks

This was easy and fantastic.  I took the advice of others and purchased the squash pre-cut; made the prep time much easier.  I only made half the recipe since I was only servicing 4 people.  I am definitely making this for the upcoming Thanksgiving meal.

This was a yummy and easy dish to prepare.  I did take the advice of another reviewer.  I microwaved the squash for 3 minutes before adding it to the pan with onions.  I added craisins and 2-3 tablespoons of brown sugar, covered, and continued to simmer for approximately 10 minutes.  I rarely review a recipe I've altered, but want others to try this dish.  I will be making again for certain!

Preparing the butternut squash was not fun. I've never cooked one and didn't realize they were so hard! Setting that aside the recipe was pretty good. I just used a handful of toasted pecans and it wasn't over powering in flavor, added a touch of brown sugar for a little sweetness, and everyone seemed to like it, I'll make it again...if someone else cuts it up!

Butternut squash is very sweet. No need for any additional sugar. I pre-microwaved it like others suggested. Mine only got soft and mushy, and even stuck to the bottom of my non-stick pan. I also added the dried cranberries. Nobody here liked it.

This was a great base recipe- followed another's advice and added some cayenne pepper, craisins, and some fresh chopped rosemary and a tsp of coconut sugar. The toasted  pecans totally made it. FANTASTIC- served with pork tenderloin. So good! Thanks for sharing.

I think the taste of the squash would be better if this recipe was roasted in the oven. Did not care for taste of the pecan.

Made this for Christmas dinner, and it was a big hit! I used packaged butternut squash, and even though I guess I cooked it a little too long and it ended up being creamy as opposed to little squares, it didn't change the taste a bit. I did add a spoonful of brown sugar, and sprinkled it with cinnamon, but that is personal taste. Thanks for the great recipe!

It came out very well.  I did as recommended by others and added 1 Tbsp brown sugar and some craisin - it would have been good without these but it was wonderful with them.  I also halved the squash and cooked it about 5 minutes in the microwave to make it easier to cut up.

I made this with dinner last night and my husband loved it, I was shocked! The next time I make this I will definitely microwave the squash because it took much to long to get it tender. I only added half the parsley and pecans ( which were delicious). And I will definitely add cinnamon and maybe a touch of honey the next time!

My family enjoyed this dish.  I did not have pecans so I used walnuts and it was still great.  I put the squash cut in 4 pieces in the microwave, like others suggested, to soften it a bit.  Then I cubed it.  Cooked the entire dish in the iron skillet.

I prepared this as a side dish for a dinner event and everyone loved it.  They all wanted the recipe.  It was worth the effort to prepare a nutritious dish from scratch.

I love the fact that you can taste the squash without having to lose it's wonderful texture.  It's visually appealing too!  I got rave reviews for this potluck entry at a family gathering this thanksgiving.  One change I made to this recipe was to add a few tbsp maple syrup to the mixture before re-heating.  Next time around I plan to try tossing toasted pecans with maple syrup, or I may add maple syrup before toasting, not sure yet.

I took some advice from the reviewers and micro waved the squash for 6 minutes.  I added course chopped garlic a minute before adding the squash to the pan.  I also added some cran-raisons, brown sugar, cayenne pepper, allspice and a little salt for seasoning.

Just made this recipe, its pretty good. Although I think i would put more pecans toasted longer, and more parsley, next time. This dish is not dry at all. microwaving the squash a little does help cutting it up.

This was a hit with my guests and my family (Even the finicky 3 year old).  I will make it again certianly.  I couldn't use the nuts due to allergies so used dried cranberries (as suggested).  I too steamed in micro for 5 minutes using about 1/4 cup of chicken broth.  This allowed me to cut back on the butter a tiny bit.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was really good. I made modifications based on people's reviews. I microwaved the squash for about 7 minutes to make it easier to cut. I added dried cranberries and simmered everything in apple cider. I also added corriander, cinnamon, and all spice. I made it in the morning before i went to work, and put it in a casserole dish so my husband could throw it in the oven to heat it up. The only thing i didn't' like was the parsley, it tasted like soap but that's probably my own tastes.

I rate this 3 stars because it was okay. The onions and pecans in it were great. I added cranberry's, cayenne pepper, and used fresh parsley. Also I microwaved the squash before cooking it. It was good and I went back for seconds. Just for the amount of work and time it took to prepare this meal, I will not be making it again.

I left out the onions because we aren't huge onion fans, but that might have been a mistake bc I felt this dish was missing something.  I should've added garlic instead I think.  Still, I really like butternut squash and I'm not going to penalize a recipe for my mistake.  I think I prefer butternut squash baked--just my personal preference, so I'd do that next time.  Bf apparently just doesn't like butternut squash, which he hasn't really told me before.  So I guess I'll try it again just for me.  Thanks for the recipe!

I liked this recipe and will make it again. It had just enough natural sugar in the squash that it didn't need sugar added. My husband really liked it, too.

I liked this bkz it was a good sidedish without being overly sweet. (Most butternut squash recipes are sweetened with sugar or cream.)However, mixed reviews from the family, kids liked it, DH thought it was dry.

This recipe fails on several accounts.  It's all but tasteless.  It's hard to make (peeling squash!).  And its got too many calories (butter and pecans).

I believe I used to large of an onion and didn't chop it small enough ... but even without this mistake I don't understand why everyone loves this recipe. My boyfriend and I both felt it needed brown sugar and cinnamon, which would make it more like a sweet potatoe pie.

This recipe is unbelievably awesome!  Every person I've made it for agrees.  I make this all the time for all sorts of events... it went to last year's superbowl party, and due to popular demand, will be back this year! YUM!!!

For the type of recipie this is, it is excellent!  My whole family enjoyed it.  I used splenda brown sugar to make it a little more sweet without adding too much sugar as well.

Awesome recipe. I didn't have pecans so I used walnuts and pinenuts instead, they worked great. My whole family loved it including my very picky 4-year old son. Definitely a recipe to make over and over again.

I made this for my hubby and toddler because of the good reviews.  However, we were disappointed.  My toddler wouldn't even eat it, but my hubby and I made it through a helping each.  I told him I didn't think I would make it again based on the work involved and the end product..."thank you" was his response.

A lot of work for very little flavor. Not a hit, but just okay- won't make again.
