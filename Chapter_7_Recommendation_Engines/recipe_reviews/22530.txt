Good, but put the butter UNDER the top crust and when you mix the filling add a pinch of cinnamon.  Also, don't use the pearl tapioca.  It's too big.

This is my favorite recipe for Blackberry pie. I often use Marionberries which are very similar to a blackberry.  I double this recipe, put the butter under the crust not on top, use "Minute tapioca" and bake it in a 10 inch deep-dish glass Pyrex pieplate.  It's done in 1 hour 15 minutes. PERFECTION!!

This is the best recipe I have found so far. The tapioca really keeps the berries together!The only thing I needed the change was the baking time,to about 45-50 minutes.Thanks Michele!

This absolutely the best recipe for blackberry pie.  I have also used it to make a combination berry pie of berries that I had in the deep freeze, red currants, blackberries, blueberries and raspberries.  The tapioca held everything together.  I use the medium small sized tapioca as pearl is too big.  Excellent recipe.  Many people think I am a gourmet baker.

I used tapioca - not the fast cooking kind so I literally had hard little pearls in the pie. I baked it about 45 minutes and had lots of juice for the tapioca to absorb but no luck. Maybe use one of those instant tapiocas or quick coooking kind? Sometimes it's the small details that get me (I don't keep many instant foods in my pantry and it backfires on me sometimes :-p )  You know though, it's hard to go wrong with sweet blackberries and pastry. I'll exclude the tapioca next time and go more traditional. (or buy instant tapioca?)

This is the best and easiest recipe! To make the pie thicker, add extra tapioca, just estimate the amount.

I just loved this recipe. I pick my own blackberries from our ranch and always in need of good blackberry recipes. I made this for a dinner party and the whole crowd was pleased! I did make a change however, used 2 table spoons of flour since I didn't have tapioca handy. It turned out great!!!

This pie was so easy to make and was so delicious! It only took about 2 minutes to throw together. The pie took longer to bake than what the recipe stated. If your blackberries are tart, I would suggest adding a little more sugar. Overall it was very very good!

This is a good berry pie recipe.  I'm going to try it with raspberries next. I gave it four stars due to the changes I made.  Firstly, I added lemon juice and zest from one lemon to bring out more of the berries' flavor.  Secondly, I don't like double crust pies, so I made a single crust (see Laura's recipe: "No-roll Pie Crust II.") and scattered a crumble over the top.  Finally, as other reviewers have noted, it needs to be baked at least 45 minutes.  I have no idea how the other reviewers got by with 30 minutes!  The pie was EXCELLENT.

I made this pie twice, and both times it was very runny.  I tried another recipe on this site, and it was FABULOUS.  I'm not sure why this one doesn't work for me, but it definitely doesn't.

This was a great recipe but it too way longer to cook than it says, and I would add more sugar next time- I used rozen berries and it was very tart. Great texture though and really good with ice cream!

Wonderful!  Finally, a fruit pie filling that doesn't all run out of the crust after you cut the first slice!  My family, including in-laws, raved about this pie -- so you know I'll be making it again.  Thanks!

Good basic recipe but the berries still ran (using instant tapioca) when the pie was warm, which is the best time to eat it!  Once cooled it stayed together, though.

I'm not a big blackberry pie fan, but I made this for my dad because it is his favorite. I have never seen a dessert disappear on his plate so fast! He loved it, and now requests it all the time.

The tapioca is the key! I used double the berries in a 9 x 12" baking dish. Mixed in a dash of cinnamon and lemon juice.  Also used a whole cup of tapioca and 2 cups of finely granulated baking sugar. I put bits of butter under the top crust and brushed it on top, too. Runny when hot, but sets up fabulously when cooled. Delicious and my family loved it. I will make it again.

Followed the recipe and instructions to a 'T' - some reviews said to put the butter under the crust - no way, don't do that!  Soften or melt the butter then brush it over the top to make the crust delectable!

This was the best result I've ever had on a fruit pie. No runniness, and no chalky pastiness from flour/cornstarch either. I used "minute" preground tapioca. Worth every penny!

This is my recipe been making it for years-blackberry pie is my absolute favorite! Only difference is I do not use butter instead I brush top crust with milk and sprinkle with sugar to make a nicely browned top crust. It can also be made with frozen berries just do not defrost berries prior to cooking.

Love this easy recipe.  I use a graham cracker crust on the bottom and bake it "topless".  A hit with the entire family.

It was certainly easy.  I had to serve it while it was hot and it ran all over the plate.  So, I'm trying it again and waiting to see if it sets up.  It also needs more sugar!  And, I agree with one of the other reviewers, I put the butter INSIDE the crust..it looks awful on the outside.

This pie was great, but this was the first time I made it and it had small hard/crunchy seeds.  This may be the way it is suppose to be, I would love to know.  I was also cooking a Blueberry pie with it that turned out great, so maybe I just did it too long.
