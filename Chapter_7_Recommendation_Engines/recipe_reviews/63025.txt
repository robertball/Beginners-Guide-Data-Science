I rate this one highly although I did some things differently.  Instead of cooking the tenderloin in the oven I put it in a dutch oven, sprinkled with some chili powder and garlic powder, filled the dutch oven half way with water and brought to a boil.  Turned down the heat and simmered, covered for 2 1/2 to 3 hours.  The meat shreds very easily at this point.  I made the sauce mixture but thought it was a bit overpowering for the kids so I added about the same amount of bbq sauce to cut it.  I added some of this sauce mixture to the meat and served the rest on the side.  It was great!  I used 1 tsp. maple syrup instead of the maple extract aned omitted the equal all together.  The sweetness is the syrup was plenty.

This was easy.  Didn't change a thing.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it!
