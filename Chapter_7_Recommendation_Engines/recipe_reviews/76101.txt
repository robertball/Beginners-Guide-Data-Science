I used sun dried tomatoes instead of fresh and kalamata olives instead of black plus I added pesto sauce.  I layered the feta mixture, then pesto, feta again, sundried tomatoes and olives, feta, then topped with cucumber and green onion.  It was wonderful!  Dip should be kept cold though.  As it sat out it got a bit watery looking.

To avoid it getting watery, try one of two things: Substitute sour cream for the yogurt (which I do, because sour cream just holds up better) OR put the yogurt in a cheesecloth-lined mesh strainer overnight and turn it into yogurt cheese before using. There will be a lot less liquid that way.

I used Greek strained plain yogurt.  I found it in my grocery stores natural food section.  It has the consistency of sour cream and a better flavor than regular plain yogurt.  That took care of the watery issues.  I also used a crumbled feta that had Mediterranean herbs mixed in to add more flavor than garlic and pepper.

Just responding to the watery/soupy problem... first as another person said, keep veggies separate until right before you serve, I always have them pre-diced in a bowl and add as needed.  Also both layers should be kept cold as longas ossible. I find alot of the time I add a bit more feta and cream cheese so that the mix starts out very paste-like as well..  Next time I make this I tink i might try out some of the other suggestions for a change though.  My husband laughs because whenever I am home alone for a couple of days I make a big batch of this stuff and pretty much live off of it...

I made this for a get together with my girlfriends to rave reviews.  I used Fage nonfat Greek yogurt which is so thick it didn't need to be drained as do some other yogurts.  Since I already had it in my refgrierator, I did add in a layer of pesto sauce as another reviewer reccommended.  While this was a nice addition, I probably won't repeat next time.

Very good, but the best trick to avoid the 'yogurt soup' effect, is to drain your yogurt in cheese cloth for a few hours before preparing the dish.  That's the key.

I have used Rednekkchikk's recipe as is for a couple of years now & never change anything.  It's always awesome, everyone loves it!  I serve it with Garlic Herb crackers from All Bran - but could eat it by the spoonful by itself.  It's my fav dip recipe on this site.

This was an outstanding dip.  Took it to a neighborhood ladies night.  So pretty and fresh tasting, many loved it.  I used greek yogurt to up the protein and store bought pita chips.

This dip rocks!  My friend brought it over last year, and I've been addicted since...You really should drain the yogurt to make "yogurt cheese"; otherwise the dip will be runny.  I line a strainer with cheesecloth and place in a bowl. Pour the yogurt in and let drain for about an hour.  You can substitute sour cream for the yogurt, but you won't get as much of an authentic taste.  Also good with red onion (or any veggies for that matter!)  Thanks for the great recipe!

I think I should have strained the yogurt or something because it was really soupy pretty quickly and kind of ruined it.  I thought it tasted great, and I would like to try it again. I loved the combination of flavours and included a lot of my favorite things!

Very good! I initially spread the cheese mixture into a pie plate, which looked like about the right depth.  But spread the cheese mixture into an individual plate at serving time, for a light lunch, so that I wouldn't have veggies on the whole thing. And I made the cheese mixture a day ahead. Served with whole-wheat pita bread cut into eight triangles and Town House Pita Crackers. I would probably use more veggies, just for me, and maybe press them into the cheese in addition to sprinkling.  I didn't have any issues with wateriness, but I realize now that I used two 5.25 ounce cartons of plain Greek yogurt, instead of two 8 ounce cartons of regular plain yogurt...which may not be that far off if the regular yogurt was strained. I will definitely make this again!

This dip had really great flavor. I mistakenly left off the green onion but I know ut would've made it even better.  My husband and I ended up topping our baked potatoes with this as well.  I will defintely make this again..

The dip itself was delicious.  The tomatoes and black olives were a little too much for me.  If it was like half as much it would've been great.  I did substitute garlic powder and onion powder, and skipped the cucumbers.  Still good!  Oh and I couldn't find pita bread rounds for the life of me so I got garlic toasts.  Which was good.  :)

This was very good!  I too used sour cream to avoid the watery mess others had encountered.  I combined the bottom layer ingredients and let them sit overnight.  Didn't have to drain any excess water the next day.  I recommend finely chopping the vegetables and using larger pieces of pita.  My veggies were a bit too big for the wedges of pita I had cut, but it was very good nonetheless.  Great recipe and will definately make again!

LOVE!  I did not use black olives because I don't care for them, but I love everything else about this!  The flavors are so good together and the cucumbers and tomato add a light, cool, crispness to the cheeses.

Good Recipe! Although I should of listened to the recipe and not added the veggies until right before serving, because after sitting in the fridge for a couple hours the dip became quite runny. Will remember that for next time! I also used sour cream instead of plain yogurt only because I didnt have any plain yogurt on hand.

Oh my word--this is the bomb!  SO different than the other same old, same old spreads and dips we see frequently.  This is not made instantaneously but the time taken is worth the complex flavor provided.  **I absolutely drain the yogurt over cheesecloth and a bowl for almost 2 hours to thicken.  Because of this technique, I have NEVER had a drippy dish.  Texture remained good.  
Vegetable lovers should really appreciate this--you might have some picky veggie-eaters not dive in so eagerly.  I use bagel chips or rounds for needed crispy texture.  One time I did also provide softer pita bread cut in triangles along with the chips in case others preferred that.  I still think the texture of the chips was preferable.

Divine!!! I added black beans and brown rice to make it a main dish.  Also used greek yogurt and put the left overs on baked potatoes the next night.  Huge hit with the family.  Will definitely make again.

Excellent! Everyone loved this. I did so some changes because I was out of cream cheese so I used 1 cup mayo, 1 cup sour cream and 2 cups feta, everything else was the same. Served with Ritz crackers but pita or tortilla chips would also be good.
