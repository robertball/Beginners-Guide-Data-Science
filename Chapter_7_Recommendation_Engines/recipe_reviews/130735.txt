Parsnips make it wonderfully sweet.  I added cooked rice which went well.

I changed the chicken broth to veggie broth to make this dish vegetarian.  It was a very light soup with lots of flavor and super healthy.  Definitely a keeper.

Nice taste combo with the mushrooms and the parsnips! I used button mushrooms because that was all I had.   also omitted the onion. All the flavors went well with this soup. Will make again.

I'm a pretty good cook, but never have made a good mushroom soup- not anymore! This was yummy! I used portabella and oyster, because that's what I had on hand. Love the parsnips in this recipe! Will make again. Thank you!

I was out of celery and carrots, but had an abundance of mushrooms and parsnips, also bell peppers.  This is cooking right now, smells heavenly, it will surprise my daughter when she finally gets home from her day.  A great warm-up for this cold, rainy winter day and def a keeper!
