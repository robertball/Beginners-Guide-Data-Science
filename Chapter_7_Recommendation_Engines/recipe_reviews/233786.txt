This made a tasty and healthy salad but way too much dressing for us. I recommend making half.  This will be on the menu for leftover Thanksgiving turkey.

Such a little thing, but adding the Italian parsley to the greens, without chopping it up, gave a wonderful twist to the whole salad.  I was feeding a bunch of fussy eaters so I had to make a few adjustments.  I subbed bleu cheese for the feta, omitted the olives and dressed the salad with about 1/4 the dressing stated.  This will be served anytime I have leftover turkey.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I don't remember ever having mixed salad greens with pasta before and it was very good.  I used the turkey from a fully cooked breast ad it turned out quite nicely.  I had some leftover Greek dressing that I made from this site and used that as my vinaigrette (since it had the garlic, oregano, Evoo and red wine vinegar already in it). It came together quite nicely and I will definitely be making this one again.

I was a big fan of this.  Now, fair warning, the dressing was a touch heavy on the oil, but had a good flavor.  I loved the taste/texture of mixing the pasta and greens and it had an all round delicious flavor.  This is a perfect salad for a warm night!

I've never tried a salad like this with pasta before and was pleasantly surprised. Although I didn't make the dressing because I was making only one serving and didn't want it to go to waste, I loved my bottled Olive Garden dressing on this. Yummy.

For me, a dressing can make or break a great salad. In this case, the dressing just didn't do anything for me. I loved Butterball's Golden Oven Turkey Breast along with the other ingredients, especially the feta. And adding the pasta was a delightful taste twist. Next time I make this salad (a great light meal for left-over turkey at Thanksgiving), I will use a different dressing and enjoy it much better.

Great salad.  I did halve the dressing like suggested and it was more than enough for us.  I used fresh turkey cutlets pan seared with oregano. Used green onions instead of red.

This was so good.  I didn't have any feta, so I used cubed mozzarella.  I also added a half of a sliced orange bell pepper and used a bottled Greek dressing in place of the dressing given in the recipe.  Really enjoyed the greens with the pasta.  Good even the next day when the greens had wilted.

This salad was quite good - although a little too heavy on the olives for my personal taste. I also used a turkey breast roast which I had grilled earlier in the week and subbed rotini for the penne. It made for a nice, light lunch. I would definitely make it again with leftover turkey or grilled chicken, just with fewer olives.

Fabulous! My husband said it's a "do it again", and he doesn't say that very often. Last week, I had grilled a 3lb. Butterball boneless breast of turkey roast to use for their Grilled Turkey Cuban Sandwiches (also on this site). I only used half of it for the sandwiches, so I diced up the rest of the grilled breast and popped it in the freezer for another use. It worked PERFECT having that readily available for this recipe. I did scale this recipe down to 4 servings for my family, and just kind of eyeballed all of the ingredients, with the exception of the vinaigrette. For the vinaigrette, I used 1/8 cup red wine vinegar to 3/8 cups extra virgin olive oil, 2 cloves of crushed garlic & 1 tsp. oregano (as my hubby doesn't care for over-dressed pasta salads). I also added 4 leaves of fresh basil - just because! This one is going in the recipe box. Thanks Butterball!

Excellent recipe! Instead of mixing all the dressing into the salad before serving, I served it on the side. That way, guests could add as much or as little as they liked. And, if there were any leftovers, they wouldn't get soggy. Definately a keeper!

This is a good base recipe which I tweaked a bunch. I made it Gluten Free by using quinoa penne pasta. I used less than 1 cup olive oil with the same amount of red wine vinegar and still found I did not need to use it all in this salad, lest it be over-saturated in oil. I added more of the spices/garlic/onions than called for plus salt and pepper. I didn't use the entire amount of kalamatas or feta either and I chop my kalamatas fine so they are not as overpowering per bite. I omitted tomatoes for food allergy reasons but served them on the side for others. Fresh basil torn or chopped small is another great addition- gives that fresh pop! I also subbed chunks of chicken for the turkey. This is a great, light-feeling, cool summer salad, perfect for party side dishes or a main dish at home. Leftovers are just as good, which makes it an easy second day meal. This was fun to make and enjoyed by all. I will make this again.

I love this salad - it's become part of our regular  rotation in the warmer months. It's great as a meal and a side. I make it frequently without the turkey and think it's just as good. I absolutely love the taste of the dressing but agree that it makes way too much. I usually half it and still have some leftover. I would also advise watching the proportions of each ingredient. I've definitely made changes to fit our tastes and think if you are making it for the first time you should pay attention to that as well.

I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this, given I'm not a big fan of turkey (unless I'm bowling ;) ).  I chose to shred my meat, as opposed to cubing it, simply because I prefer that texture.  We don't care for olives, so I subbed some chopped pickled banana peppers.   I had less feta than I'd thought, so I added some shredded parm as well.  No fresh parsley, so I subbed dry.  While I wouldn't buy turkey to make this, I would make this if I had leftover turkey that needed using and/or recommend it to a friend w/leftover turkey.  THANKS for the recipe, Butterball!

I thought this had a descent flavor, just the vinegar taste was a tad strong. I would make a recipe like this on a weekend, it is more work than it appears chopping, preping, boiling, etc. all of the ingredients and dish clean-up. It's also not with ingredients I typically have in the house. To make the recipe even more lite or lower calories I decided to half the dressing and used whole grain pasta and half the amount of feta using a reduced fat version. I did find that half the dressing was really plenty for the amount of lettuce and pasta used in the recipe. As I was adding the other ingredients I started to reduce them also, to save some chopping time, and also my large bowl was near full to the top already anyhow. I did heat the turkey some up in a pan, for personal preference. Besides this recipe, though, I can see me making another salad or a soup and using the pre-cooked Butterball turkey when in need of convenience.
