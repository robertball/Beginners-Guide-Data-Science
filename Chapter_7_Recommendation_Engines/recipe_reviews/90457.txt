this is pretty good.  I did tweak it a little.  first it was difficult to find the 'pocket' so I just put the sausage in and closed them with a toothpick.  Brown both sides in a bit of olive oil and then put in the pan, layering with the onions and green peppers & Italian style diced tomates. Cover the pan with aluminum foil and bake 1 hour at 375*.  Timing will really all depend on how thick the thighs are and how much you 'browned' them, especially since they are stuffed with raw sausage, you want to make sure the temperature reaches 170*.  

my husband liked this and so did friends who tried it using these recommendations.

Served with jasmine rice and garlic bread.

I have to put myself in the same hero camp as "Bytesized." My husband thinks meat stuffed meat is the best invention since bacon-wrapped anything! We really enjoy the combination of chicken and Italian sausage. The things I changed were to use 3 hot and 3 sweet sausages (personal preference), I used a casserole dish with a lid, and I used a 14 oz. can of diced tomatoes so we had more stuff to spoon over the chicken. I think the covered dish ensured that the sausage cooked thoroughly and the onions got nice and soft. Thanks for the great recipe!

My boyfriend called me his hero because I made "meat wrapped in meat"!  Changes I made were using red, yellow, orange peppers instead of green, and chicken jalapeno sausage instead of the Italian because I don't eat red meat.  It turned out GREAT!

Such a great recipe! I did change it around a bit to suit my lifestyle.
I cooked 4 chicken thighs stuffed with sausages in my slow cooker on a bed of carrots, okra and onions. I cookd it for about 7 hours until the sausages were cooked through. I deboned the thighs myself (to make a pocket)and kept the skin on for more flavor. I removed the skin before serving the chicken. 

Very easy and very yummy!

Absolutely a keeper. I did brown them a little and sauted the onion. I wasn't sure if I should cover or not, so I sort of did both.
I also used Italian style diced tomatoes and omitted the Italian seasoning.
I can't wait to make it again.

I like the idea of filling the void where the bone was with sausage. The sausage-wrapped thighs need to be browned first - they were an unappetizing/anemic-looking white.  I cooked it for 1 hr. 15 minutes just to ensure that the sausage was cooked thoroughly.  Even with the extra cooking time, the onions remained crunchy. (Perhaps if you choose to saute the chicken in some oil to brown it, the onions could be added to soften them up a bit.) Decent flavor, nice idea, but not so great that I would make it again.

This was really good and very simple to make on a work night. I also tweaked the recipe a bit. I did not have diced tomatoes on hand so instead I used a jars of salsa, which added a little extra punch. I also browned the chicken and sauted the onions and peppers with some fresh garlic (a must have for me). My daughters do not like spicy food so it was very simple to divide into 2 pans.. one mild the other extra hot!
Thanks for the recipe!

I wasn't a huge fan.  I cooked it in my crockpot for 7 hours (low) like someone suggested.  It did come out nice and tender, but wasn't thrilled about the flavor of sausage with the chicken.  On the other hand, my husband loved it.  He suggested I try using something else to stuff it with next time.  I did love the sauce though.  I used the diced tomatoes (can with oregano, basil, etc.) and for more sauce used Goya tomato sauce (I like the flavor of this sauce).  My husband used the sauce on the leftover angel hair (I had as a side with it) and he loved it.  I'll try this again, minus the sausage.

I browned the chicken and onions on the stovetop, plus I put the extra bulk italien sausage right into the pan.  Then I added the other ingrediants, covered it, and cooked it for 1 hour.  Finally, I added 1/2 bag of egg noodles and chicken stock and cooked it again on the stove top until the noodles were done.  A great one pot meal.

Took much longer to cook. I needed toothpicks to keep the thighs wrapped since there was no pocket, more of a thigh "filet".

I had to add my touch to it of course. I fried the hot italian sausage links and seasoned it with all purpose seasoning lawrys,red pepper (grounded), Adobo (had to add latin flavor), and pepper. Then i season the chicken with lawry's all purpose seasoning, adobo, italian seasoning, oregano seasoning, pepper, red pepper, salt, maybe some others. then i brown the chicken a little just for flavor. i layout the chicken in the baking pan over the aluminum foil stick the italian sausage in the chicken i will recommend you not to forget the toothpicks, i did lol. so it was a little difficult. chopped up the green peppers and onions put it around the chicken. i added a little bit of chicken stock so the chicken can stay moist. then put 14oz of diced italian tomatoes over the chicken. set the oven to 350 and let it cook for 50min. every1 loved it. for the side dishes i just made rice and had the garlic bread on the side.

I have fixed this dish since I was a child when my mother would ask me to start a meal when she was busy ( we had a motel in a resort area where summers meant our livelihood).  I would use chicken thighs with skin and bone, I never removed the bone...I am American born, but learned early on that half the flavor in cooking any type of protein is lost with the removal of the bone.  I would lightly dust with flour the thigh pieces and brown both sides, remove, set aside. Remove casing from Italian Sweet sausage and cut in 1"  pieces and sauté till almost cooked (then remove).  I used 3 peppers...red...yellow and orange, NO green (too strong) and diced in 1 inch pieces.  Spray dish (10X13) with a popular type spray "oil".  Add your chicken to the casserole, the sliced sausage (none of this "stuffing" silliness, just sprinkle the sausage  over the chicken, sprinkle Italian seasoning over all (great invention) and red pepper flakes over all.... taste (be careful). Pour TWO cans of diced tomatoes.....bake at 350....2 hours...serve over homemade or dried pasta.
Serve with a crisp Italian type salad and a good crispy hot bread or roll.

I did not care for how this dish looked when it was finished.  Too messy.  I should have read the reviews prior to making as someone suggested browning the chicken first.  It would have made the chicken more appetizing.

Very good and easy to make. Followed some of the modifications that others have made. Used salsa instead of diced/canned tomato. Also added jalapenos and mushrooms in addition to the onion and green peppers. Sauted the veggies for a little bit with leftover sausage and garlic powder, cayenne pepper, and chilli pepper. Omitted the italian seasoning. Came out good and juicy! Boyfriend said he liked it a lot. =)

Great recipe, nice and spicey with great flavor from the tomatoes.  I used stewed, only because I didn't have diced, but it was still great.  I added just a few other spices (fennel seed, oregeno, and a little basil).  I did brown them first with the onions and peppers for about 5-6 minutes, then baked everything together for around 50-55 minutes to 170 degrees.  Will make again and recommend it highly!

Excellent dinner. I improvised a bit. I had fresh tomatoes I needed to use up (instead of canned). I had no green peppers so I sliced carrots instead. Because the tomatoes were fresh I was worried about the moisture content so I added a can of chicken broth to be safe. I cooked it uncovered for about an hour. The chicken was done but the carrots took a while to soften. If I did it again I would make the carrot slices thinner to ensure they cooked in the same time as the chicken. I also had some cilantro in the fridge so toward the end of the cooking time I chopped that up and threw it on top. I don't think it made much of a difference on the flavor. The kids (teenagesr) and my husband (Mr. Finicky) all loved it served over rice with a green salad and oven baked artichoke.

I cooked this dish tonight for my family and it came out GREAT.  The favor was different from anything I have yet to try.  I did adjust my recipe, I used canned tomatoes that had green chiles in it.  It was SPICY the way I like most things.  I will be cooking this again.

I tried this for supper tonight and found it just okay. The combination of spices didn't do it for me. Too bad because it sounded good. It just didn't live up to what I thought it was going to be.

I am always looking for new ways to change up the same old meat. This was great. I didn't have Italian sausage so I used Link Chorizo instead, also used  fresh cherry tomatoes. This will definitely be made again in this house.

This is a delicious recipe!  However, I didn't have any diced tomatoes, so I used roasted red peppers that I had left from a previous recipe.  I sprinkled olive oil all over and baked it.  It came out great!  Hubby loved it.  Thanks for sharing!

Everyone in the family loved this. I made half with spicy sausage, half with sweet for the kids. Easy swap and was able to cook together etc. Made everyone very happy!

My daughter-in-love and I made this for dinner tonight. We accomodate my son, who is on a low salt diet. Sweet Barbara makes homemade no-salt turkey sausage that worked perfectly in this recipe. We used bottled fire-roasted red peppers, added garlic and asparagus. We served it with herb roasted new potatoes and a lovely spinach salad with raisins and pinons in balsamic vinegar and my homemade Ciabatta bread. Oh yes, and red wine. This recipe is a definite keeper! Thank you!

I haven't actually tried this yet but I gave it 5 stars for the great ingredients. I would crumble the italian sausage and pan fry it with the onions & peppers and a little of the tomatoes then stuff the slightly cooled mixture into the boned thighs. Then pour the sauce over and bake. This way the thighs won't be overdone or the filling underdone.I'll let you know how they turn out.

I am horrible at deboning chicken, so I just ripped everything out and rolled the sausage into the thighs and closed it with a toothpick.  Still tasted great, but I would have liked it to be a little spicier.  Next time I will double the crushed red pepper, and maybe add some chilli powder.

I was looking for a change of pace from my usual chicken recipes and found it in this! I actually only had chicken breasts so I cut in the pockets. I also used salsa. I added mozzerella because my family eats cheese on EVERYTHING. I will be using this recipe again!

These were really good.  I deboned the thighs myself and used toothpicks to hold in the sausage.  I browned the thighs and then tried cooking them in the oven for about 45 minutes.  They still weren't cooked so I transferred them back to the saute pan and finished them on the stove in about 5 minutes.  I also seasoned the peppers and onions with ground red pepper.  I'll add lots more crushed red pepper next time.  Great!

I really liked this dish, but I made a lot of modifications.  I didn't have any sausage, so I omitted that.  Based on other reviews I browned the chicken first &  then sauteed the onions & peppers.  I also added some celery & garlic and deglazed the pan with a little white wine.  I used a 14oz can of diced tomatoes & topped with italian parsley.  It turned out great!

This was good and defiantely different.  I also had to use toothpicks to hold chicken together.  I think less sauasge may have been easier to deal with.  I am not a great fan of italian sausage but it was good prepared this way. Family was pleased.  I may try with regular ground sausage.  Also would serve with angel hair pasta.

Spicy and delicious. Used toothpicks to keep them closed while browning first for a little color. Took 15-20 minutes longer to cook than the 45 minutes directed. Cover with foil while baking.

This would have been so easy had I thawed out the BONELESS chicken...but even with the extra work of deboning the chicken thighs, I thoroughly enjoyed this meal!  The flavor is basically like a chicken/sausage cacciatore.  Because the spicy sausage has such a red tint to it, I was unsure whether it had actually cooked all the way through, so just to be on the safe side I nuked the chicken for about a minute to make sure it was done.  I actually halved the recipe, but used a 14-oz can of tomatoes because I wanted to be able to spoon some over some pasta.   Next time I'll try a lower fat turkey sausage to save a few calories, but as a simple treat this is perfect.

I made this for dinner tonight.  I chose to use thighs that have the bone still because I think they have more flavor.  I just cut around the bone a little to create a small pocket.  I chopped up yellow bell pepper and sweet onion and browned it along with the italian sausage.  I let my thighs marinate in garlic powder, italian seasoning, and crushed red pepper for about 30 minutes before stuffing.  I used 2 cans of tomatoes with diced bell pepper and onions and let that simmer on the stove top with half of my browned sausage mixture.  After it cooled a down I put the stuffed thighs in the pan and poured the tomatoes over it.  I sprinkled red pepper flakes over top of it, covered, and baked! I'm excited to try it.

Really tasty and super quick to make!  I made the mistake of getting thighs with the bone in and had to de-bone it, but even with the extra time spent doing that I was still done in record time.  I substituted the italian sausage with Chorizo and it was awsome..  I will be making this again for sure

This recipe needs alot of work!  It would have been much better with boneless shinless breast instead of thighs. I think it could be made better, but just isn't worth the effort!

I actually enjoyed this recipe. My family did not. It's a different flavor but as I said, one I enjoyed. I did use a red pepper instead of green because I like the sweetness of the red pepper. I also used fire roasted dice tomatoes. The fire does'nt mean hot, it means more of a grilling...blackened...I will not make this again only because it's too much for one person but I did enjoy the flavor.

Fabulous idea!  I used 4 chicken thighs but the ones locally are always deboned by not leaving a pocket.  I wrapped the thigh meat around an equal length of (venison) Italian sausage and tied securely with kitchen twine.  Then I sauteed in olive oil until well browned on all sides.  For the 4 thighs, I used a pint of homecanned spaghetti sauce, allowing me to delete the pepper, onion and seasoning.  I did add the crushed red pepper (great idea!), then covered and simmered on med. low for 30 minutes.  Served on top of angel hair pasta and hubby, who vowed it would be dry, was pleasantly surprised.  Remember to remove kitchen twine before serving.

Interesting idea, but it's a little pointless to stuff chicken with sausage. While eating it, it felt like I needed to choose one over the other. Both tasted good separate. I used a chicken sausage that had bell pepper and onion already mixed in with it (my favorite), but I don't think I'll do this again.

I don't think the flavor combination works very well here.  If we decide to make it again, we will probably vut the green peppers and put the spices inside the chicken for maximum flavor.

I used chicken breast instead of thigh, and just wrapped it around the sausage, and cooked it until the sausage was 160 degrees. It turned out great! Definitely a keeper! :)

This was delicous and easy to make on a weeknight.  I think next time I will use boneless skinless chicken breasts insted of thighs because none of us are dark meat fans, but it was definately a hit as is!

was a real nice change I agree browning the chicken would help I salt and peppered the chicken and added fresh grated cheese ... next time I plan to sear the chicken and  half way through cooking I'll add mushrooms and roasted garlic chunks

My husband loves this recipe. I did change it a little to make the dish easier to make. I used ground italian sausage. I divided it up into even portions, placed the portion of ground sausage on top of the thigh and held it together with a toothpick. (Almost like a taco). When your ready to serve just pull out the toothpick. Easy!

Have prepared this great tasting chicken recipe twice and both times it turned out great.  Baked covered for half the time and then uncovered for the final cooking.  Served over egg noodles the first time and over mashed potatoes the next-both were great. This is a real keeper!

This is a great tasting recipe.  Followed the recipe pretty closely and the taste was great and we'll definitely do this again.

Was a bit hit with everyone! I used large Skinless Boneless Breasts though, as I couldn't find skinless boneless thighs at the local Safeway. I think we all preferred the Breasts anyway!
