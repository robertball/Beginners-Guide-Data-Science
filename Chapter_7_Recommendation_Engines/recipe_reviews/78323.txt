Oh yum! This is my absolute favorite variation on the grilled cheese now. I made it exactly as written and it was fantastic!

Great for lunch!  I love feta cheese so I had to try this. I sprinkled a little oregano on the tomatoe along with a bit of salt and pepper. Good stuff!

We were absolutely amazed that something so simple could be so tasty! This is, without doubt, the tastiest grilled cheese I have ever had. This is the only way I'll be making them in future. Thanks! (I know there are MANY different feta cheeses out there, so this will probably significantly impact on this recipe. Personally, I like to get Bulgarian feta (from a Mediterranean store in Columbus.) It is quite salty and strong, but not overwhelmingly so).

Try it on a pita with cucumber, fewer onions, olives and tzatziki.  With all of those it is an easy 5 stars.

I didn't realize I haven't reviewed this recipe earlier! I have been making it for several months now and it is one of my most favorite recipes. This is very flavorful. I also slice a small piece of feta and grill them on the pan while my Greek Grilled Cheese is grilling. Feta become very salty and savory tasting as it heats, so I enjoy that and extra onion, and tomato on the side. I very highly recommend this recipe!

Wow!!  Wanted to make tomato soup and grilled cheese for lunch on this cold windy day for my family.  I made regular grilled cheese for my 3 year old and for hubby and myself I tried this!  It was so tasty!  Only changes were I used American cheese instead of cheddar and drizzled a little bit of Good Seasons Italian Dressing on top of the feta/onion/tomato before topping with more American cheese.  EXTREMELY tasty and quick to make!!  Thanks for the idea!!

What a fantastic Saturday afternoon lunch! Of course, we're completely nuts over anything with feta, so this was a big hit for us. I did add more feta than was called for, but I didn't use any cheddar, so it evened out ;). I used crusty bread that I was lucky enough to get freshly baked at my local grocery store half an hour earlier, and mixed a little roasted garlic into olive oil, which is what I used to grill the sandwiches with. Yum, yum!

Great idea!  I sprinled the inside of the sandwich with Turksih oregeno and paprika for a little more flavor.  The onions overpowered the flavor of the feta cheese.  Next time I will either satay them or leave it out completely.

OMG this was soooo good. One of the best recipes I've tried so far. What a wonderful sandwich. I can see this being served with small side of salad in a high end cafe'. Absolutely delightful!

I made these last night.  I used Naan bread (flatbread) instead of regular bread and cooked them in a panini pan.  They turned out delicious.  You could customize these sandwiches and use whatever variety of cheeses and veggies that you like.  Makes a very nice grown up grilled cheese.  I made homemade tomato soup using a recipe from another site.  It was a yummy dinner, and would be perfect for a weeknight dinner (quick, easy and tasty). Thanks for the great idea.

This was full of flavors inside. I liked the mellow flavor and the creamy texture the feta took in this. I don't like onion so I used onion powder and I left off the tomato and served this with tomato soup. Thanks for a great sandwich.

So. Freaking. Good. I swear. I might stir some Greek seasoning either in the butter or sprinkle it over the tomatoes before assembling. As is, it was heaven.

Very good! I used one slice of cheddar and one slice of swiss cheese. Also, I only had vidalia onion, so I subbed that for the red. This was soooo tasty and different. I really enjoyed it, and will be making it again for sure! Thanks for sharing. :)

My teenager and I loved this!  Very simple yet different.  It taste amazing on Rye bread!  You could probably add whatever vegetable you wanted - spinach, bell pepers thinnly sliced.

Love it! The only thing I changed was not adding onions. I had never put tomato on a grilled cheese sandwich and never even thought about adding feta. The feta just gives it a different dimension. I did make sure the tomato was well drained by letting a paper towel soak up the juice before putting it on the cheese. I also put the cheddar next to each slice of bread to make sure the sandwich stayed together. Thanks so much for the great recipe!

My feta wasn't especially tasty so that might have influenced my opinion.  My hubby liked the variation, but I think I might have preferred no tomato (I really like it dipped in ketchup instead).

This was SO delicious! I layered in this order: slice of extra sharp cheddar, feta crumbles, thin slice of tomato, two strips of red onion, one more slice of sharp cheddar. Having cheese on both sides kept the sandwich together while flipping. Also, after I buttered the bread I sprinkled the butter with parmesan cheese. I served the sandwiches with tomato soup, which I dipped my sandwich in. YUM! Thanks for this amazing recipe!

Used smoked Gouda instead of Cheddar and left out the red onion. This is a flavorful and hearty alternative to American-singles-on-bread grilled cheese!

I made this and it tasted bland. It wasn't bad but it wasn't that good. The recipe calls for more flavor like other reviewers suggested.

Modified this to a quesadilla instead.  Great flavors.  Thanks for the inspiration!  Needed fresh herbs (basil and oregano) to bring it up a notch.

It was ok, we did it without onions because we don't care for onions. We are feta fans and can always use more feta, but overall it was decent. I feel like it could have used some other seasoning or maybe spinach just to bring it further from the normal grilled cheese.

Wonderful sandwich!  I love it!  I wasn't sure if the feta would melt well but it melted just fine.  I grilled mine more like 7-8 minutes on low heat and everything melted perfectly.  Great flavor and mix of ingredients.

Five stars just as written.  I didn't think feta in a grilled cheese sandwich would be very good, but I was very happily surprised.  This makes for some great, rich comfort food.  Thanks for the recipe!

This sandwich was ok. I made this recipe exactly as written, but it was very blend to me. I will definetely try again adding more greek ingredients like oregano and maybe olives because I think it can be improved a lot.

Great idea. I grilled them on olive bread, and added a few baby spinach leaves, and some roasted red onions I had leftover.
Served it with Leek & Potato Soup!

Excellent! I never thought of putting feta in a grilled cheese, but now I don't think I can leave it out. The red onion was really good too. My husband just adored it. I like the idea of jazzing up a cheese sandwich, and I'll have to play around with different ingredients now. Thanks!

I'm going easy on this recipes because I've never liked grilled cheese.  But I found this to be an upscale version of blah, mushy and greasy.  Just like the other grilled cheeses I've had in my life.

I've never had grilled cheese any different than 2 slices of cheese, 2 slices of bread and butter. This variation was awesome. I'll never make grilled cheese the same old way again!

This was a nice twist on grilled cheese. I used olive oil based margarine instead of butter, only one slice of cheddar cheese, 1/2 a teaspoon of feta, white onion and tomatoes.

This was so creamy & yummy. I used reduced fat feta cheese & reduced fat swiss cheese. I omitted the onion per the previous comments, and at the last minute added 2 slices of turkey pepperoni, diced up. I added some oregano & garlic powder to the mixture, too. I made the mistake, though, of using my own homemade garlic butter to butter the bread with, which was still delicious, but the garlic flavor kind of overpowered the feta. Next time I'll use nonstick butter spray like I usually do. Thank you for sharing this!

This is an *awesome* version of grilled cheese...both my daughter and I loved them.  We didn't put onions on them, but will try that the next time.  Easy supper, but not boring, same-old.  Thanks for this recipe!

Possibly the best recipe I've tried from this site. All of the flavors individually were good, but put together--wow! Seriously, the tomato I got was ho-hum tasting, but with the rest of the ingredients, it tasted amazing. I was a little weirded out by that. In a good way.

I followed the recipe exactly. The feta cheese I used was a "Mediterranean Herbs" variety.

Wanted to make something quick and easy for supper and came across this sandwich. It was delicious! All I added was tzatziki. Next time I'm going to add roasted red pepper! Yum!!

We tried two different grilled cheese sandwiches for dinner and shared half of each.  This was our favorite, although the other one was very, very good.  We are huge feta cheese eaters, so I was sure we would like this one.  The flavor combination of this sandwich is delicious.  We also had grilled Romaine, 'Jalapeño Popper Grilled Cheese Sandwich' and 'Rob's Screaming Stuffed Jalapeño Poppers' from AR for dinner.

This was awesome!! I didn't have slices of cheddar so I added 1/4 cup shredded sharp cheddar, chopped up the tomato and onion, mixed it all together with a shake of Greek seasoning and spread it on...hubby loved it too!! Keeper!! Thanks for sharing ??

Loved it!  I added homemade pimento cheese since I had some leftover.  I also added fresh basil leaf and used a light baked sandwich roll that I bought a Sam's.  I baked these at 400 degrees for about 8 minutes.  I had to make for 75 guests for a ladies luncheon.  They turned out great! They loved them.

Delicious!  I just toasted bread in toaster, added a couple slices of crispy bacon, then melted the cheese in the microwave.  My family loved them!  What a nice, quick, delicious meal.

I had no idea what I was going to prepare for dinner tonight.  Hubby said soup and sandwich sounded good to him so I went to "Good Ole' Dependable
ALLRECIPES.com". Searched and found this recipe and, WOW! Hubby took one bite and said, "this is a 5 star if ever there was one".  I agree, and even ate 2 of them myself.  He ate his with corn chowder,  I didn't need anything more to go with mine.  ILOVERIVERS, thanks for posting this recipe.  I will be making these as my grilled cheese sandwiches from now on.  They are absolutely wonderful!
