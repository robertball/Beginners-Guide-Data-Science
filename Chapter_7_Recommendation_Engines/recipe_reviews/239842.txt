I have made it 2 times now. Great seafood chowder but I like mine thicker I tried more flower in the leftovers the first time and it was an improvement. The second time I added about 1 tablespoon of cornstarch when I added the scallops and shrimp. I'll add more cornstarch next time.

It's good, but bland. 1/4 of a teaspoon of garlic pepper for the entire crock pot just didn't cut it. I like the chowder, but I'm going to have to figure out how to add more flavor.
