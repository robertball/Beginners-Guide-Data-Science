I thought this was pretty good. It had a grown up taste to choc pb. It also didnt have that waxy after taste like the store bought stuff. I used dark choc chips and natural pb with honey. With the honey already in the pb, I cut it back to a 1/3 of the amount suggested. I used the change servings button to make 8 servings, or 1/4 of the recipe.
