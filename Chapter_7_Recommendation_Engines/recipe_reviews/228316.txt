This was much better than I expected. The key to this drink is the frozen sliced banana. It gives it that melted vanilla ice cream flavor. In my vitamix, I turned it to variable speed 10 and then about 45 seconds on high. I made a 1/2 a recipe and got one large serving. So, the actual recipe is 2 servings, and not 1, which explains the high calorie count. I have to agree with the other reviewer, that said this is filling. To me that is a good thing.

I'm not a huge fan of smoothies because they don't fill me up but this one was great.  The protein from the almond butter made me not miss eating a real meal.  I may increase the almond butter next time to balance out the banana flavor.

I halved the recipe for my breakfast this morning and found it to be refreshing and filling. I used an overly ripe banana I had in the freezer, so it was plenty sweet for me.

My daughter volunteers at the smoothie bar at church and is always looking for a good smoothie great enough for our church members.  I (mom) talked her into making this one - sounded good- we went and bought the almond butter special for this. We were totally disappointed in this smoothie.  You can hardly taste the almond butter, so could have probably used peanut butter and saved some money.  Members said they could not taste it either and that it tasted like peanut butter.  Just a normal smoothie to me.

The only good thing about this drink was the bananas.

I thought it tasted good and was a great afternoon snack to curb my hunger. This looks like it makes 2 servings, so I cut it in half for just me. I still put in a whole tablespoon of almond butter. This is not very sweet, even with a really ripe banana, but that was okay with me. Adding a little sugar or honey might help the flavor for some people. The only other thing I'll do differently next time is to cut back on the milk.

Flavour is really good. I added ground almonds instead of almond butter to get more flavour. I also subtituted lactose free milk for my intolerence and cut the amount of milk in half to match my diet. I also did find that I didn't really like the texture. The banana ended up being pretty mushy for the amount of liquid. Instead of adding vanilla extract, add vanilla whey protein powder for a better texture.

Great smoothie. I have tried it a few times, and adapted based on my needs/what I had available. I subbed in dairy-free milk (almond and cashew), and used peanut butter once. I even threw in some spinach to make it a green smoothie one time. All variations have been delicious. Next to try - bacon!

My rating for this recipe is for as it is written.  Please read on...This smoothie recipe is the 1st I've tried. Ever. Followed the recipe as written but was disappointed...my tastebuds were bored. Back onto the blender I added almond extract and addl almond butter.  Still boring.  Back onto the blender again.  This time I added some chocolate hazelnut spread. Yummy!!
