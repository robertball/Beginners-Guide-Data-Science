Doubled the recipe and omitted the browning of the meat. I did season and dredge in flour but added right to the crockpot in layers with the veggies. My only other change was to use white wine since I had no red. Otherwise this smells so good while cooking all day. Served with Seasoned Noodle Mix from this site and and Grandmothers Buttermilk Cornbread from this site. Kids loved it!

I've now made 2 Swiss steak recipes from this site and liked the other one better although this one is still good.  I served mine over white rice but it would go really good over some mashed potatoes too :)  Thanks!

This was really good, my 5 and 3 year old ate it up and they're picky. I didn't have bell pepper or the sloppy joe mix, so I used a couple cans of tomato sauce and extra worcestershire, oh yeah I didn't have red wine either. But still was excellent,can't wait when I make this again with all the ingredients.

I, too, skipped the browning part. I didn't have Sloppy Joe sauce, so I used a small can of tomato sauce and an equal amount of BBQ sauce. Added a squirt of Tabasco and some soy sauce. I used a frozen bag of carrot medallions, and both the steak and carrots were frozen when I started the Crockpot. Came home to a yummy dish we served over rice!

This was just alright.  It tasted kind of like a spicy roast.  Also, you can use any cheap cut of meat in this recipe, it cooks so long, its all going to fall apart anyway.

This is a keeper, the only change i made is to omit the carrots (i don't like cooked carrots, only raw). unfortunately i found out at last minute that i was out of rotel, and had to substitute a can of whole tomatoes, which made it a little bland this time, but next time i make it, i will be sure to have rotel on hand.

I made this almost exactly as written, and it was pretty good! I didn't have a green pepper, left it out. I didn't have any Rotel, but I used a can of diced tomatoes and a half can of diced green chilies, with juice. As per another reviewer, I added a can of tomato sauce, since I also didn't have red wine. I put in a splash of balsamic vinegar to the sauce before I added it to the crock pot. Was super tasty!  Next time, I think I'll add more carrots. Hubby said it tasted like an Italian pot roast he loves in a fancy restaurant! Thanks!

I really liked this recipe. I did take the time to flour the meat and brown it first and I think that might be why it was so good. It took me a while to find the right meat-there are so many types of round steak. Finally found the right one, not too thin.
Very tender and flavorful. Served on rice.

My family loved this.  I didn't brown the meat, just dredged it, put it in pan, placed sliced onions over meat, and poured mixture of Manwich (used whole can), tomatoes, and Worcestershire over it.  Cooked at 225 for about 4 hours in a pan covered with foil.  So tender and delicious.  This one will go into my recipe "rotation."

Did not use the slow cooker, was in a hurry and used ground beef. Next time I'll add soy sauce on the table...this was very good.

Great!!! Had a small roast on hand, sliced it into 3 thin steaks, followed directions for tenderizing & browning the meat. I didn't have paprika, so I used garlic powder.  From there, I just used what I had on hand... No rotel,so used oriental hot chili sauce (squirted less than 1/4 cup into the crock pot, it made it so HOT that I then sprinkled {?} maybe a tablespoon (or more?)of white sugar all over  ingredients. I usually use brown sugar to cut heat in a dish, but was out of that. If you have to do that, go carefully with the sugar because you can always add more, but too much will ruin a dish. The final result was a perfect blend of hot and... not sweet, but just right! added 2 coarsly chopd roma tomatoes, Didn't have onions or bell peppers, so added about 1 1/2 cups chopped celery to the pot.  Used the whole can of manwich cuz what am I gonna do with 1/2 can of leftover manwich? Didn't have red wine, splashed in some red wine vinegar and worsterchire sauce, didn't measure anything so these are all "guesstimates".  I did have some baby carrots that I used, they gave a nice texture to the dish.  I needed to use up some instant mashed potatoes  and this dish was perfect for that. Served this dish on top of the potatoes and since this dish was so spicy and flavorful, I didn't mind the potatoes being instant.  I admit, I am a potato snob! That is why this box of instant potatoes had been in the pantry forever, cuz I love fresh mashed potatoes! Will definately make again!Yum:)

This turned out really well for game night.   I’ll do it again. I cut the steak into strips since there was seven servings to be done.  I served it over a rice quinoa blend
