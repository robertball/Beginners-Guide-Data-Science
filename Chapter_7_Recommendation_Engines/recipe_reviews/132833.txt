My mother-in-law from Poland and I have watched and learned how to make it.  Only changes I do are - I use 60% ground beef to 40% ground pork.  Basically like what some would use for a meat loaf mixture.  Also I brown a chopped onion with about 4-6 slices of bacon and add to the meat/rice mixture.  When you boil the cabbage leaves, save the water that it is cooked in and use instead of chicken broth.  My mother in law insists on this step!  Great to make a day ahead of company and reheat, the flavors are even better :)

A great starter recipe. I used 1.5 pounds of ground beef and 1 pound of ground pork. Since I reduced the portion of meat, I also reduced the amount of rice to 1.5cups. To perk up the flavor I used 4 cloves of garlic. I also seasoned the meat well when cooking, with onion powder, garlic powder, a pinch  of celery seed, salt and pepper. To the meat/rice mixture I included a few splashes of V8 (until moistened). To the tomatoes I substituted the chicken broth for water in which the cabbage was cooked in.  I also added approximately a cup of V8 to the tomato sauce. I only made one pan and it cooked perfectly in 1.5 hours. Served with sour cream and it made a delightful meal with plenty of left overs.

I make (galupke') i am slovak. Very similar. I make mine on top of the stove. I layer the rolls in lrg. Pot, in between layers i put the small unusable leafs and chopped whole tomatoes. When you are done with layers add water till you see it in the pot, then cover partially bring to a boil then simmer for a couple hrs. I lay some keilbasa pieces on top toward t  e end. The vest part is the Kapusta, which is the loose cabbage that you have put in between the layers and the juice, like cabbage soup. I am 72yrs old and this is how my Bubbi made this and she was born in Slovakia and this is how the Bubbies (now me)make it in the church, we teach the young ones to keep the tradition going, also baked goods from the old country and well everything.

I will definitely be making this again!!! Because some of the other reviewers said it came out bland, I did add some spices to the meat mixture as well as the can of V8 others suggested. I put in Basil, Rosemary and a little extra dill weed.  I also omitted the extra 1 1/2 pounds ground beef and was able to squeeze it all in one pan. I didn’t have veal and didn’t want to completely overwhelm the pork flavor with too much beef. My husband loved the way it came out. I was looking for a Sarmale recipe because he is from Romania but this came pretty close. The cabbage just isn’t as salty as Sarmale but the meat was delicious. oh, one more thing! I would recommend serving with a dollop of sour cream. It really adds to the flavor.

It is spelled Gwumpkies in polish. Great recipe. As for the critical review this recipe is very traditional except for the sage pork sausage and comes from poor regions in the old country (Europe) and is bland because there was very little money for anything. I like to perk up the flavor myself. For a recipe this size here's how, first don't drain the meat dry in a colander leave some fat in, use at least 1-tsp salt in the meat, in the sauce add the following, 2-tsp salt, 1/3 cup brown sugar, and my secret ingredient is ketchup to taste about 3/4c. However you could also use 1/4 to 1/2c apple cider vinegar or a(small or large) can of sour kraut instead of ketchup. The ketchup, vinegar or kraut really step up the flavor and give that little twang to the taste buds. I feel the need here to remind people, start with less you can always add more.

This is the way cabbage rolls should be made My Grandma is from Poland  I do not use red pepper flakes or dill weed But I Do  use 1 teaspoon garlic powder or 2 cloves minced garlic 2 bay leaves and once in awhile a good pinch of thyme also a splash of apple cider vinegar or 1/2 of a squeezed lemon and maybe a teaspoon or 2 of white or brown sugar(I cheat and use Splenda) to make it a little zesty and  bring out flavors very subtly all in all this recipe is  and  with or without tomatoes but I like it with

A definite keeper!!! Very easy recipe and super tasty, my family has requested to add this on the weekly menu. I cooked mine in a crockpot. In a saucepan -- mixed the canned tomatoes, tomato sauce & chicken stock, cooked to a rolling boil. Meat mix was 3-lbs ground beef & 3-lbs italian sweet sausage, increaesd rice to 2.5C. Scooped sauce in the crockpot, layered the cabbage rolls and sauce. Cooked in crockpot for 2-hrs. Amazing! Thank you for the recipe!

Leave out the venison/beef and pork and increase rice abit. I could eat these 24/7 and never tire of them.  Top with sour cream and a sprinkling of chopped up salt pork and I am whisked back to memories of Baba's meals.  Add some borscht and we are all set.  I have never visited my familiy's homeland, the Ukraine, but imagine eating Holupchi over there when I prepare these!

keep in mind that this recipe yields 60 rolls!! When I'm making them for a small group, I usually half the recipe. The only thing I ever change in this recipe is the meat mix - I use ground pork and ground beef. I also serve mine with sour cream on the side. The kids love it!

Great basic cabbage roll recipe.  Reminds me of my Grandmothers. I've tried different grains in place of the rice, like barley, quinoa, or kasha.  This recipe is easy to adapt to any grain on hand and I like to experiment with the textures.

This was a winner, even the boyfriend who doesn't like veggies had a second helping of these. I tried to make this as close to the recipe as possible with what I had in the pantry, but dill weed is something I just don't have on hand. I added in a little of this area's "cajun" flair to it with a little cayenne pepper instead of the red pepper flakes. I also used some fresh green onion pork sausage from a local butcher shop down here that made these rolls amazing in my opinion, though it may be a little biased. I didn't have any venison either, but if I ever get lucky enough to get some, I'll definitely try this recipe again with it.

My husband is from Russia. I made this as a surprise and he LOVED it! He said it tasted just like back home.  I really liked it too. I followed other comments so I added a little more seasoning to the mix. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Very good start to the recipe.  I made it as the recipe states with the exception of using ground pork and ground chicken (instead of beef) and brown rice instead of white to make this a bit healthier.  The flavor is a little bland but that just needs a bit more sage and parsley so more of a chicken soup than a chicken broth.  I'd suggest bullion instead of broth.  The only other change is to double the tomatoes and sauce and add some to the meat mixture.  There wasn't enough sauce to sufficiently cover the rolls and the filling was a bit dry.  Like I said, good recipe and with a couple easy tweaks, a great recipe!

Delicious recipe!  I do not add the pork, just use ground chuck.  I do not add egg either to my meat mixture.  What I do add is 1-1/2 TBSP of tomato paste & 2 TBSP of tomato soup from the can in the meat mixture to hold it together.  I do not cook my minute rice, I just measure 3/4 cup of it to the meat mixture to abosorb excess liquid.  This will save you from draining the meat (our ground chuck from our meat store is pretty lean!)  I use 1 large onion chopped fine with Mrs. Dash, salt & pepper and that is it for seasonings. I cook them in tomato soup diluted with water in the oven at 350 for 1 hour in a covered roasting pan I serve with a side dish of mashed potatoes and use the juice they cooked in as a "gravy" on the mashed potatoes! Delish!

Very good. We used 80% 20% pork and it came out just fine; definitely need to bump-up the amount of herbs though.

This was a big dissapointment.  i didn't have any venison, but used sausage and beef.  everything else was the same.  it was the blandest, most flavorless thing i've ever had in my life.  it's like all the flavors canceled each other out.  never again!

I'm about to shop for ingredients for stuffed cabbage so was surfing just to see if there were variables to what I've normally done as I learned from my mom. This one looks good, along with another on this site, and has prompted me to get some ground pork. My mom used only ground beef. One thing I didn't see in the couple of comments that I read that my mom did was to first layer the bottom of the deep baking pan with sauerkraut. It adds extra volume when serving lots of people, along with extra flavor.  You have to make sure to rinse the sauerkraut first (like I forgot once) or you get (in my opinion) way too much "zing" from it (like I did). Rinsing it really neutralizes that effect. She also chopped up the extra parts of the cabbage and dispersed them around the layers of rolls. She used a big can of tomato juice as the broth. I do the same sometimes, although I've also used plain tomato sauce, tomato soup,  V8 or some combination, including a can of crushed tomatoes for extra measure, then using a liberal amount of pepper and salt to the top to season the whole thing as it cooks. OH MAN I WANT THIS NOW!

My family loved it, i went with spaghetti sauce instead of tomatoes for a sweeter taste and a dash more chili powder and it was delicious.
