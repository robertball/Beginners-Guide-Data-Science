I am in love with this recipe. I made some changes that I think compliment its simple style: First, I too used canned mandarin oranges, and added about 2 tbsp of that liquid to the dressing, which sort of cut through the vinegar nicely. I also added some chopped avocado, crumbled blue cheese, and smokehouse almonds to the salad - totally divine combinations! I also used spring mix, as did another reviewer. For the dressing, I substituted Raspberry vingegar with some Fig Vinegar I had in the house, and that worked perfectly. Thanks so much! I've already made this salad twice this week - and it's only Wednesday. :-)

Delicious and refreshing salad.  I tweaked it a little bit according to what I had on hand.  I used baby spinach instead of endive, green onion instead of red onion, and raspberry balsamic vinegar instead of raspberry vinegar.  I also added some sliced, grilled chicken breast to make it a main dish salad and sprinkled sliced almonds over the top.  It was a great light supper for a hot summer day.

I loved this recipe and passed it on to my sister who has now made it twice for dinner parties.  We changed two things.  We use raspberry BALSAMIC vinegar instead of plain raspberry vinegar and added a few sprinkles of feta cheese. It got rave reviews when both of us made it!  BRAVO!!!

This is my favorite salad ever,and I am super picky.
I took the advice and used mandarin oranges, and mixed the left over juice (instead of the the oj) with the raspberry vinagrette, sugar and olive oil.
I also added candied pecans, gorgonzola and cherry tomatoes. 
There is nothing better than this combo.

I was assigned to be the "Salad Guy" at a potluck BBQ that I co-hosted last night.  I went online to find a different kind of salad other than a bland green one and came across this one.  After serving it last night, it was an instant hit!  Everyone was asking me for the recipe so I gave them the website address instead.  The only thing I varied was that I used 1/4 of the red onion instead of a whole one and everyone still thought it was a main ingredient if not part of the salad's name.

We liked this-the flavors of the endive combined with sweet oranges balanced each other nicely!

Good salad.  I added some raspberry vinegarette to cut down on the tanginess.  Great with some feta cheese on top.

This excellent!  I served it too some leary folks and everyone loved it.  I also used only half the onion because of the strong taste of red onion.  I also added toasted walnuts for some extra protein.  Great summer salad!

This salad turned out just fabulous! The dressing has the perfect balance of sour and sweet. I used a White Balsamic Raspberry Vinegar and fresh orange juice. Also, the 2 cups of endive and 2 1/2 cups of asparagus did not seem enough for 6 people, so I added 2 cups of mixed spring greens. The same amount of dressing still worked great. I used fresh oranges - made the salad look really nice. Will definitely make it again - with roasted pecans added next time.
Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this for a dinner party and everybody loved it, I might cut back on the amount dressing next time, probably just reduce the vinegar.

Took this to a dinner party and everyone loved it!  Also easy enough to fix at home on a weeknight.  I add a touch of balsamic vinegar to the dressing, though.

This is really great.  I used a can of mandarin oranges to make it even easier.  I will definitely make this again and think I'll throw in a handful of toasted pecans.

Sorry.  I really was dissapointed with this one after all the great reviews.  Although I love all of the ingredients separately, I thought the taste of all of them combined was awful.

This salad was a huge hit at a recent dinner party and can be served in an elegant or casual setting. Definitly go easy on the onion as others have recommended.

Tried this one out for Easter dinner today.  It was a hit.  I, too, added toasted almonds and cut down on the onion a bit.  I also added a bit of spring mixed greens for more texture and color. The flavors blended beautifully together.  I highly recommend this one.

This was definitely different.  The flavor combination was good, however my family didn't like it enough to make it again.  Thanks anyway.

I'm sorry... I was underwhelmed with this recipe.  I found the flavours of the endive and onion too sharp and bitter for my taste.  The oranges and dressing were lovely, though, and the asparagus was a nice touch.  I might try it again with spinach, as some other reviewers have suggested.

Edible but not very tasty. Kids were forced to eat it, the husband complained about it, and I'm stuck with the leftovers.

Delicious, sweet, tangy, fresh.  A big hit.  The husband loved it, as did I.  I added some fresh diced cucumber.  Will be making again this summer.

SO good! My 10 yr old said it is his favorite salad ever, and that he could be a vegetarian if there were more salads that tasted this good :) I added a handful of fresh spinach & sliced strawberries and that really added to the overall salad. Will definitely be making this one every week.

Very good salad but the red onion is overwhelming. Next time I will only use 1/4 red onion and quarter the orange rounds or use clemantines.
