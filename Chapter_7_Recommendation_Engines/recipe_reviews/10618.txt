I love these!  I've made these a dozen times and here are a couple suggestions that I've found make them even better:  As another user suggested, use 1 Tbsp lemon juice instead of the 1 Tbsp water.  Also, I always add a few splashes of milk or evaporated milk of half and half (whatever I have on hand)to the cake mixture.  It makes the bars stick together much better and they don't come out too crumbly at all.

Oh, man, these are good!  I used lemon cake mix, and instead of adding water to the jam, I used lemon juice.  The lemon-raspberry combo is simply wonderful.  These came together so easily; they'll be a regular around here!

Wonderful snack!  Healthy too since I replaced apple sauce instead of butter!  I will make this again and again.

This is the easiest recipe with the best results.  I make them the night before and cover the sheet pan with foil, and cut in the a.m.
It can even be made up to 2 days ahead to be cut up on the third dat.  This is a big hit at our bake sale and my brother-in-law has me make them every year for his birthday.
This is not a cakey recipe.  It doesnt even taste like cake, people can believe it when i give them the recipe.
Try other fillings like fluff and chocolate chips,, peanut butter chips,, Anything goes with this!!!

I love this recipe! When the bars cool, I like to melt about 2 Tbsp. of white or cream cheese frosting in a bowl.  Then I drizzle lines over the top in a lattice pattern. Gives these bars a certain finishing touch.

This bar was very good but too sweet for my taste. I served them at a baby shower and everyone loved them. They're the easiet and fastest recipe to make. I think next time I would use 2 cups of jam to create a fruitier flavor. All I could really taste was the cake mix.

Wonderful and quick recipe.  I also only had lemon cake mix on hand, and they turned out wonderful.  I also substitued the water for lemon juice. 

A few tips:
- Do not overbake, or they will be very dry.  Mine took only 16 min. to bake completely.
- Make sure your butter is completely melted.  
- Cut the squares, when they are completely cooled or they will crumble on you!

Enjoy!

I enhanced the flavor a little with adding 1/2 tsp. Vanilla and almond extracts to the dough.  It really gave this recipe a boost.  Will make again, thank you.

I made these using butter instead of margarine, Pilsbury Golden Butter yellow cake mix and strawberry preserves.  The butter and butter-flavored cake mix became a little overwhelming after two or three bars.  Next time I'll use just a basic yellow mix.  Also, I used about 1 1/2 cups of preserves and would still like more fruit flavor next time.  Awesome quick and easy recipe to have on hand with endless possibilities.  Thanks!

Good bars but next time I would increase the jam to 1 1/2 cups...seemed to need more fruit filling.

As is, it's a great BASE recipe. I took another reviewer's advice and used a lemon cake mix. I also used fresh lemon juice in place of the water with the raspberry preserves. I didn't have any problem with sticky dough. It was a bit dry but it all worked out in the end. To take it over the top, I drizzled homemade lemon glaze with fresh lemon juice over the top. Ordinary dessert made extraordinary. NOTE: Try making it this way. Addictive little bars, lemme tell you.

If you want these to stick together and not be as crumbly, add 1 egg and 1 tablespoon of milk. Works like a charm every time. You'll need to increase the baking time a little with those 2 added ingredients. Don't undercook or they wont set, especially in the middle. 28 minutes always works perfectly for me. When the top is golden brown and the edges start to look brown, the bars are done. I always pop mine in the fridge for a few hours to make sure they set really well and I can easily cut them into pretty bars!

This recipe is a keeper! After reading the reviews and suggestions I decided to use Duncan Hines French Vanilla (white) cake mix. I've used the yellow cake mix in other recipes similar to this and didn't care for it at all. It's too sweet and has a flavor that reminds me of those store made  sugar cookies.
Anyhoo...I added 1 tsp. almond extract, used 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup vegetable oil instead of the margarine to cut down on the fat and calories, 1 1/2 Cups of Lingonberry Jam, 1 Tablespoon of lemon juice instead of the water as others suggested to cut down on the sweetness.
Everything else I did the same way and baked it for 25 minutes.
OMG! It's fabulous! Not too sweet, the crust stayed together nicely when I cut it and I had to arm wrestle my husband and son for the last piece.
I'm really looking forward to getting creative with the cake and jam. Next I'm going to try it with Pineapple Cake and Orange Marmalade Jam. I'm going to sprinkle toasted almonds on the top. Can't wait.

Excellent and easy. Everyone loves the recipe! I used marmalade and called them marmalade bars (that the only jam I had.)
They were a perfect bar with coffee at our morning coffee group. Note I didn't use the water. I just stirred jam with a fork. I have made this several times and now only grease sides of pan so jam won't stick. Plenty of grease in base so that part never sticks. Run a thin knife around edges after cooling 5-6 min. to eliminate sticking to sides....easier cutting.

These tasted like Strawberry Fig Newtons!  I would definitely make them again.  The topping tended to fall off, so I would probably press it down a little before baking next time.  Otherwise awesome!

Make it about once every 2 months, and everyone loves them!  Added a little bit of milk to the bottom half mixture so that it stays together better.

Raspberry Oatmeal Bars Haiku: "Seriously good. Can't be any easier. (Great for a bake sale.)" I've been making these for years, and can't believe I'm just getting around to unloading my 5-stars on this so-excellent-so-easy recipe! The only things that I do different is swapping water for lemon juice, and adding a splash of milk and 1/4 tsp. vanilla to the cake/oats. I've experimented w/ different cake flavors/fillers (such as chocolate cake w/ nutella in the middle, or lemon cake w/ strawberry jelly), but I've found that as written, this recipe always wows people who taste it, and even more fun is their being unaware at just how crazy simple it is to do.

Megan, I tried these for the first time a while back and everyone LOVED them!  I should have rated them back then and I apologize for not doing so. This recipe is so adaptable as others have said and so good! What I did was: I added a bag of frozen raspberries to the jam (didn't have raspberry so I used blackberry) and left out the water. I am telling you, my husband and daughter, who are food snobs, went crazy!!!!  The cake mix makes these easy and delicious~!! I don't know how anyone couldn't like these! Thank you for sharing!

This was my "new" cookie recipe for Christmas baking..I made them with white cake mix & raspberry seedless jam & with seedless strawberry, seedless blackberry & apricot...they are delicious...even my 87 yr old mom, says they are delicious. Thank you for such an easy recipe. I had my doubts, whenever I use a cake mix for something other than a cake, it never tastes that great, but this is the exception....

One taste of these and it's an immediate OMG moment! So good! Altho I used white cake mix, next time I'll take others advice and try the lemon. I'd also like to try chocolate and possibly add in some coconut. There are so many wonderful possibilities for this delicious, yet ridiculously fast and easy dessert. Thank you so much for sharing Megan!!!!

Wow.  Super easy and, as my husband put it, "Stupid Good."  I threw these together during a commercial break while watching television with my husband.  They are THAT easy.  I made them, as I do with every first attempt with a new recipe, exactly as the directions stated.  The end product was incredibly rich and very sweet...but to our taste, it was a wonderful and decadent dessert.  I didn't detect a "fake cake mix" flavor at all.  I think this will depend entirely on what cake mix you use.  Some will be better than others.  The only "complaint" or note I would add for others who want to make this is:  The texture of this was very cobbler-y.  Even the next day, it didn't set up into bars for me.  It was magnificently delicious...but it never set into bars.  I live in a very humid climate, so that might have something to do with it.  Just make them well ahead of time if you need these for an event, or you might end up like I did with a very soft pan of goodies that would never do for cutting into neat squares.  I will be making these and experimenting with new flavors a LOT in the future.  My next attempt will be to add cinnamon to the crust mixture and use apple pie filling.  Any fruit filling would work with this recipe, really.

These are surprisingly good.  In a panic i tried this recipe b/c i did not have enough flour to make bar cookies from scratch.  I used a butter cake mix, added 1 t. vanilla, a splash of milk (as previously recommended), and lemon juice instead of water to  apricot jam.  they turned out quite good.  if i make them again, i agree that they need more than one cup of jam.

Wasn't a big fan.  My roommates dad in college used to make a recipe like this, and I've been searching for it every since.  Falls apart too much, not wild about taste, almost commercial.  Made for bbq, I think only one was eaten.

Wow, these were really good.  Very sweet though.  I took them to my Korean families house for Thanksgiving and they loved them.  Asians don't typically like things too sweet so I was pleasantly surprised.  I will try the version of the recipe that uses flour and brown sugar next time for a more granola and hopefully less sweet flavor.  I took the recommendations of others and added lemon instead of water to the jam.  I also added a dash of milk to the bottom layer to make it less brittle for cutting.  The lemon was a great addition to the flavor of the jam and after letting them cool they cut perfectly.  I enjoyed these cold better than at room temp.

I made a few changes to this recipe as well... to suit what I was 'looking' for... I baked half the crust for 10 mins... added 1 brick of cream cheese, 1/2 c. sugar and 1 egg (thoroughly mixed) on top of that layer... then did the raspberry jam... added the rest of the crust/ topping and baked another 10 mins... turned out wonderfully!

Quick, easy and tasty. I sprayed my hands with cooking spray to spread the bottom crust. Also useful when make crispie treats.

I know, I know, I made some changes, so I'm not really reviewing THIS recipe.  However, it was still excellent so it gets 5 stars with my changes, which were:  French Vanilla cake mix instead of yellow and apple dessert filling instead of the raspberry jam.  I also only had regular rolled oats instead of quick oats, but they turned out fine.

Really good and super easy I used a white cake mix and boysenberry jam 1 1/2 cups and also added 1/8 tsp almond extract. It was a big hit and so quick to make. thanks

Its so easy not much to critique.  I used almost a whole jar 18 oz of seedless raspberry jam. (about 2 cups)  I also included the lemon juice as directed by other reviewers and that change seriously makes this dish great, because it really needs the acid to combat the butter.  I also drizzed cream cheese frosting (from this site) on the top.  Very good, very easy.

This had a great flavor especially considering I had very little raspberry filling to use. I didn't realize I was so low on raspberry jam so I used about a 1/3 cup fresh raspberries with it. It tasted great still and had a nice  texture. Thanks for the quick and easy recipe!

I could not believe that anything so easy could taste so decadent.  I am going to try it with pineapple jam and maybe blueberry jam with french vanilla cake mix...the possibilities are endless!  I did add a little bit more jam and dotted the top with margarine right near the end of the cooking time.

I have made these with both raspberry jam as well as apricot jam (my favorite), and they were both just awesome!  Using a cake mix makes these bars very easy and quick to prepare.  These bars are great to take to potlucks and BBQs in the summer.

These are super easy to make. I followed the recipe just added a full 18oz jar of raspberry preserves for a more fruiter middle. I will try using some lemon juice instead of water next time. Thanks for sharing.

Wowzers! Super yummy. Rich and buttery crust matches well with the sweet and tart raspberries. And it was so easy to make because of the use of the cake mix. I will be a rock star when I make this for friends and family.
I used lemon juice instead of water, as others suggested.

Easy and fantastic.  I added more oats cuz I'm an oaty person.  And I agree with adding more jam.  We did strawberry and the bars didn't last long at our house.  

Very versatile recipe and easy to make for potlucks, etc.

These bars are absolutely NOT too sweet! They're bar cookies; they're supposed to be sweet. What I recommend is making them once, following the recipe exactly. Then if you want to add ingredients or substitute, you'll have a better idea what you're doing. I made these exactly following the recipe and thought they were scrumptious...raves from my guests, and the entire panful disappeared. I did think the bottom was a bit crumbly, but not really a problem. I added 1T milk to the bottom layer, and it held together better but had a different texture. I could not detect the aftertaste one reviewer claimed to find. I have used sliced almonds on the top and chocolate chips in with the preserves. Excellent!

If you're looking for a delicious, easy dessert recipe, this will become your go-to recipe.

These bars came out great.  I used non-stick foil and had no problem with sticking.  I chose to add some chopped walnuts to the topping and really liked that addition.

An extra star for being so easy!  I used 2 cups of peach jam that did set up.  So, I didn't add any water.  I added about 1/3 cup of coconut to the crumbs on top.  These are extremely sweet, but I guess that depends on your jam.

This is a great easy recipe.  I will agree with others that it can be too sweet.  I use a white cake mix, but take out 1/2 cup of mix and replace that with 1/2 cup more of oats.  I also used blueberry preserves and it turned out great.

Very good and simple to make. Makes a lot, so I might halve the recipe next time, but keep the amount of jam the same, as I found it a little dry. Thanks for the recipe!

We love this recipe here..  it's great to do with the kids and they love having them as a treat in their lunches at school. My oldest decided to try it with a layer of cream cheese (mixed with a bit of milk) before the jam (we used strawberry last time)..  soooooooo yummy!  Thanks so much :)

I have used this many times as per your directions and have also made with many substitutions.  The flavor possibilities are endless-chocolate with cream cheese filling, lemon with strawberry filling, chocolate with caramel.   Use your imagination!

This was not easy.  The margerine was not really enough to wet all the cake mix and oatmeal.  I was concerned that it wouldnt cook right.  I was correct it baked up dry.  This tasted like underdone cake/cookie mix.  The reason I gave this four stars was because the jelly bottom layer with the jelly came out really well and tasted good.  I dont know if I will make this again though.

Excellent snack food. I'll make a few of my personal modifications for flavoring, but the initial taste was very good. I did not have as large of a baking pan (mine was 8x8, versus the recipe's 9x13) so I used a baking pan of the former size. If you do end up using a smaller pan, just tack on several more minutes to the cook time. Mine were done in about 25 - 27 minutes. Let cool for 15 minutes before cutting, as it lets the bars set a bit more.

LOVE THESE!  I always used "Delicious Raspberry Oatmeal Bars" before, but these are much sweeter and yummier!  I actually made both last weekend to do a taste test, and everyone loved these the best!  I did make some changes as suggested by other reviewers - I used butter, always do.  I also used lemon juice instead of water, and only used 2 cups of oats.  Also, very important, I sprinkled chocolate chips over the jam before putting on the rest of the topping.  YUMMMMMMMMM!  I also have yet to use raspberry jam with any of these recipes - strawberry, apricot, and peach are our favorites, so we use those!  Give these a try!  SO YUMMY and EASY!!

This recipe was super easy and very good!
The only adjustment I made was adding a little milk as previously suggested, I used pie/pastry filling (not as sweet as the jam) and I added some pecans to the dry mix.  Mine came out great and I didn't think they tasted "cakey" at all.  Hubby even really liked them and he is not a big sweet eater!  Thanks for the recipe!

PROS-Fast, easy, cheap.
CONS-VERY,Very sweet...overly so.
Definate cake mix flavor. 

This recipe is good in a pinch, but it needs some tweaking IMO. I would definately try the other suggestions of adding lemon juice to the jam, to cut the excess sweetness. Not a favorite of mine, but my husband thought they were great--but then, there is very little foodwise that he doesn't like!

I took these to work today and only got one complaint...that I didn't make enough! They are SO easy to make and SO GOOD!! Only had a white cake mix on hand, and used a little more jam and lemon juice instead of water. Will try chocolate chips next time and other flavors of jam too! Thanks for this easy recipe!!

I used regular oats as I didn't have quick-cooking on hand and they were a little chewy - next time I'd make the effort to get the quick-cooking ones, but these were still tasty.

These are really good - and so easy!
I used blackberry jam instead of raspberry. The filling possibilties are endless...
I did find, though, that I needed to bake the dish for longer than the recipe called for (it took about 40 minutes to get brown on top). This might be due to our higher altitude.

This is a great bar recipe!  It is very sweet but that's why it's so yummy.  Works well with any jam.  Friends especially like it with lemon curd and I have even used it with pie fillings.  Turns out great everytime.  Thanks Megan!

I make these all the time for parties and they always get rave reviews.  They are always the first thing gone.  I substitute light margarine to make them "low-cal" and make sure not to overcook so they are very moist.

This recipe was awesome.  I didn't have yellow cake mix, but I had chocolate!  I made it with Chocolate cake mix and Strawberry Preserves.  The taste was awesome!  Brought them to a Halloween party.  Everybody loved them.  They just melted in your mouth.  I tasted fudgie and the strawberries just complemented the chocolate.  Used a hand pastry blender to mix the dry ingredients...mixed it much easier than the spoon.  Will definitely make these again and again.

My 12 year old made this easy recipe for a contest. She got 2nd place! It is so simple, yet the results are so tasty!
It has possibilities for substitutions or alterations also:  Chocolate cake mix? Different flavors of preserves?

I changed up this recipe a bit but it turned out AMAZING!
Instead of raspberry jam I put in 2 cups frozen berries picked from my garden.
For topping I only saved 1/4 of mix and added in 2 cups shredded coconut.

Fantastic!!  I used 1 cup raspberry jam plus 1 cup fresh raspberries along with 3/4 cup nuts in crust.  As someone else suggested I also added an egg and 1 Tablespoon milk to the crust, baked 25 minutes.  This served with Kool Whip when warm is heavenly.  Thanks!!

I love the taste of this.  I made the recipe as written for the rating.  I've also made a variation of this which is adding 3/4 cup canola oil instead of the margarine and I added about 1/2 creamy peanut butter to the dry ingredient mix to give it a pb&j taste.

Made these using strawberry jam and added some sliced almonds for even more crunch. The flavor was fantastic! But it didn't hold together at all. It became more like a crumble which I didn't mind since it was just for the DH and me, but wouldn't be a dessert I'd make for company.

This is delicious and easy to make, but not amazing when compared to all the other great cookies in the world. I made it to the recipe and added some vanilla to the dry mix and lemon to the raspberry (yum). The bars are too sweet for me. Next time I will not use a cake mix so that I can add the amount of sugar necessary.

Everyone else LOVED this, but I thought it was too sweet.  I used a French Vanilla mix (adding a few tablespoons of milk to help it stick together more) and home-made berry cherry jam.  I also used butter instead of margarine.

This recipe is excellent!  I've made it just as the recipe states and have boxed them up in cute tins for my family for 2 years now.  They loved them so much the first year that they were requested again.  Will probably be a staple gift item for a long time to come!  It's easy to make them in bulk :-)

I've made these numerous times since I found the recipe and every time I do they get rave reviews from everyone. super duper easy and delicious to boot. I do substitute lemon juice in place of the water and sometimes I add a touch more jam. Otherwise the directions are straight forward and easy to follow.

I am giving this 4 stars because I feel that there is not enough fruit filling called for in this recipe. Like others have noted, I would increase the jam to 2 cups. I would use the tartest jam you can find to compliment the sweetness of the cake. Using lemon juice adds to the tartness as well. I did not use all the crumb mixture, probably had a cup leftover and it was perfect. Wait until these are totally cooled to cut.  I cut them in triangles for added effect. I will make these again with endless jam/cake mix combos...can't wait to try choco cake w/ raspberry jam!!

Not the best recipe for raspberry bars, I used two different pans, one glass, one metal, the bars in the glass pan were overdone. I think the recipe needed a clearer test for doneness than just checking for a brown topping.

These were ok - I think I prefer the ones I make without using the package cake mix.  I didn't care for the aftertaste that I thought was quite prevalant.  I used almost double the jam - can't imagine 1 cup being enough.  I will say that this was so easy and accetable when in a hurry for something sweet.  Thanks for the recipe.

I followed the recipe almost to the 'T'.  I did use strawberry preserves instead of raspberry and I added a couple tablespoons of milk as suggested by one of the other users.  The end product ended up tasting identical to a strawberry NutriGrain bar...which I love!!  I will definitely make this recipe again...especially since it's healthy and the kids loved it!

I made these using the lemon cake mix.  I thought they were amazing.  I did use more jam and they seemed to take longer to bake.  I had a little trouble with the outside edges burning.  I took them to a party and everyone raved over them!

Quick, easy and delicious. I used 1/4 cup margarine and 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce in place of the 3/4 cup margine called for. According to other suggestions, I also used lemon juice instead of water and added 1/2 teaspoon each of vanilla and almond extract. The amount of jam is perfect and more would be too much. I used a small piece of wax paper to help press the mixture into the bottom of the pan. After one hour at work, the pan was half gone and I had requests for the recipe. Try it!

I am only giving this 4 stars because I made some changes and I am not sure that I liked the taste of the box cake mix. I replaced the butter with applesauce and the water with lemon juice.  I used blackberry jam.  I served this warm with a scoop of premium vanilla ice cream and topped it with fresh blueberries that I heated in the microwave.  My guest raved over my fancy dessert.  No one said anything but I thought the bar had a box mix taste to it.   I will make again though because my guests thought it was great.

This recipe looked so yummy, I had to try it! I didn't have any raspberry jam/jelly, but I had some blackberry preserves I needed to use up, so I used that instead. I made it in two 8"x 8" x 2" pans when a friend came over, so I could send a pan home with her. It came out quite delicious-it disappeared quite quickly! The only change I made was substituting lemon juice for the water. Definitely a keeper!

I love this recipe.  These bars are easy, very versatile, and inexpensive.  The first time I made them though, they didn't hold together as well as I wanted.  The second time I made them, I used 2/3 of the crumb mixture for the base and 1/3 for the topping and they were incredible. A great variation is to subsitute a can of apple pie filling (chopped), 1/2 t cinnamon, and 1/8 t nutmeg for the raspberry jam.  It tastes like a dutch apple pie.  Yummy!

Super easy to make. I followed the suggestion of a few others and added more jam for a fuller fruit flavor.

These are great! Always a hit at work...have played around with flavors of jam and also added zest of an orange or lemon, depending upon jam flavor. Great go-to recipe if you're looking for something easy and inexpensive.

This recipe is so easy and delicious!  I made some of the suggested substitutions such as a lemon cake mix--along with some lemon zest and lemon juice instead of the water.  My bars took quite awhile to brown on the top. Easy to cut and made a nice presentation.  Even better the next day.

I love these bars. They were so quick and easy to prepare and they were a huge hit at my pot luck. I stuck to the recipe exactly and the results were great. Next time i will take the advice of others and try adding lemon juice instead of the water to the jam or maybe try adding a little alomondd extract for some Raspberry alomnd bars. This recipe will be among my favorites.

I love this recipie!  It is one of my "go to" things to make when I need something quick and easy for a party or get together.  I usually cut down the butter to 1/2 cup and add a little bit of milk instead to make the dry stuff stick together.

This was soooo easy! I used white cake mix, 2 cups of oats, mixed in a little vanilla to melted butter and a homemade Rasberry Jam - no water - about 2 cups,a layer of white chocolate.  I had to cook until center appeared to breath.
Once cooled and cut, I dusted with powder sugar and drizzled with Dark chocolate for an elegant and "specialty bakery" look.

Make this ALOT since discovering it!  Great recipe!  The first time I tried this I used white cake (was so good that way that's all I use) and added a handful of white chocolate chips on top of the raspberry, these are WONDERFUL!!!  I keep threatening to try a different variation, but this is so good as is that I just can't!  Thanks for a great recipe!!!

Okay- I truly screwed up this recipe, and it still turned out great, just different than the original seemed to be.  Rather than 3/4 C butter, I used 1/2 C applesauce and 1/4 canola oil, plus 1/2 C egg substitute.  Also, I then spread 3/4 of the mixture in the bottom of a jellyroll pan, topped with jam and lemon juice, then dropped the remaining cake mix mixture in heaping teaspoons.  It came out very cakey but great, and I drizzled a lemon icing that was simply made with lemon juice and powdered sugar as soon as they came out of the oven.  The result tastes a great deal like raspberry danish!

I was short on time and actually combined the base of the recipe because it was so fast and easy and the fudge from Chocolate Revel Bars. I then added the raspberry on top of the chocolate layer and crumbled the remaining crust mixture on top.  They turned out super yummy, a total crowd pleasure.

I made 3 batches of these for a Cancer Benefit Bake Sale. They were a hit! We sold every last one. I added a little vanilla to my cake batter and oatmeal. This is best served once it's been in teh fridge for a while and the flavors can marry. I also used 2 batches to make with boisenberry, which were excellent as well. Quick, easy and Yummy!

I loved this recipe. I didn't think the cake mix taste was too powerful. I added a little vanilla to the cake mix.  I didn't have raspberry jam, but I did have raspberry pie filling.

I absolutely love this recipe, and so does my entire family.  The great thing about it is that you can use any flavor of fruit preserves and it will still taste delicious.  Another thing you can add to give it a bit more flavor is cinnamon.  So far my favorite combination is cinnamon with peach preserves.  Try serving it warm with vanilla ice cream, there won’t be a crumb left!

These bars are so easy and delicious. I have made them twice, once with a butter cake mix and once with yellow, the butter turned out much better, I also, like some other reviewers, added a bit of milk to the mix after separating it into the bottom part and the top part. I didn't find it too sweet, perhaps this is because I used a reduced sugar raspberry jam from Trader Joe's and then sprinkled a few chocolate chips on top of the jam. I made it in a tart pan the first time and liked the result better than the suggested square pan. Cut into wedges and it is actually pretty elegant looking and certainly tastes homemade.

This is a really great recipe for using up a boxed cake mix. I didn't have my 9x13 pan, Instead I doubled the recipe and used a rimmed baking sheet (11x15 I think)worked great, also I couldn't stand to use 3 sticks of butter (to pricey) so I used 2 sticks of butter and 1/2 cup of oil. Very easy and Wonderful!

This was easy and good. Would add lemon juice to the rasberry cause it was very sweet. Also I did add milk but next time would seperate the halfs and only add the milk to the 1st half. You want to top half to crumble.

Crust part was a little dry.  Next time will use a bit more jam, to moisten it up a bit.

Very quick very easy. I too added a slash of milk to the cake mix and exchanged the water for lemon juice. Great flavor that way and the milk really helps it come together. Without it, it would be hard to get in mixed through.

I do think this is a good base recipe to play with - think lemon cake with coconut and nuts and maybe a pineapple jam filling instead?

One of my favorites as is!  But I have also used apple jam and cinnamon swirl cake mix (topped with vanilla ice cream once out of the oven).

I needed a recipe for raspberry bars for a wedding reception. My requirements were that it be elegant, super-easy, and inexpensive. I chose this recipe, but made the following modifications: I used 5 boxes of butter-flavored yellow cake mix, and increased the butter and oats by five. I then pulled out 4 cups of the mixture for the topping and added two cups of chopped pecans. I put the remaining mixture in two jelly roll pans, and used raspberry pie filling - 1 can in each pan. With the lighter layer it nut topping - it was fabulous and sooo easy!

I rated these 5 stars years ago as they are excellent. Just a side note,  I made them today with strawberry preserves and golden cake mix and they tasted like an amazing strawberry shortcake type dessert. Highly recommend!!!

made these to cheer up a friend who doesn't like cake on the one year anniversary of our friends' death.  Substituted a mixture of homemade Nantucket beach plum jelly and black raspberry jelly for raspberry, and added some lemon juice, as the whole thing is extremely sweet.  Just a suggestion:  you may want to add more fruit filling, as the top and bottom are the same mixture, and can overpower the jelly.  They were loved by the cake hater!

sooo easy and sooo tasty!  I mean, you COULD make these from scratch, but why bother?  The butter-flavor yellow cake mix comes out tasting like buttery shortbread cookies.  Everyone really like these, and I made them in about 30 minutes total.

SIMPLY DELIGHTFUL!!  I was looking for something quick and easy to make for a bake sale at my son's school.  So glad I found this recipe.  I have made by scratch raspberry squares in the past. With good results. This was simple, that I think its my new favorite.  The crust had a nice vanilla flavor with a great crunch from the oatmeal. Great with a scoop of vanilla ice cream!!!  YUMMY!

VERY YUMMY!  The first time I made this I used a tablespoon of flavored coffee creamer instead of water. Also, rasberry jam with mini-chocolate on top is the way to go!  This one is a keeper!

Well, I gave this five stars, because it deserves it for easy and tasty. I messed it up - I did not see to put HALF the batter in the pan, then the fruit layer! I tried to scoop it back off, but it didn't work! Ha! So, put HALF the cake mixture first, then fruit then the other half! I also used Blackberry Jam from Simply Fruit - it was great. (You can use the entire 10 oz jar if you want - I didn't, but felt the fruit layer was too thin.) My bars looked ugly, but still tasted good! I'll definitely try it again the right way. Meanwhile, you can't get much easier than this recipe!  Thanks!

These were okay. I used butter instead of margarine and you need a bit more than 3/4 cup to get all the cake mix coated. They didn't stay together very well, maybe because I used butter.

I have made this three times now. First I used sugar free raspberry seedless preserves the first two times and homemad blueberry preserves the third time.  Added a layer of mini chocolate chips every time over the fruit before adding the "crust".  Thanks!  Great and easy!

I love to have great recipes using a cake mix!  I will make these for years to come.  I also love Holly's Delicious Raspberry Bar recipe but these are super easy and I don't always have oatmeal.

Followed the suggestions of other reviewers and used a lemon cake mix and fresh lemon juice in place of the water. These bars turned out delicious...if you like lemon, which we do. I am going to try it with a white cake mix (I am not a fan of yellow as I always seem to find a yellow mix a bit overpowering). I would also like to try adding some chopped pecans to the mix. All in all a keeper recipe!

I thought they were just OK; you can really taste the cake mix. My sister and DH liked them, so I will give them a 4, but they both really like the taste of cake mix. I used homemade lemon-blueberry jam and used the water as directed, and that turned out fine. They were simple and quick, which is what I was going for and were a nice treat.

So simple and easy yet still delicious! I followed the recipe exactly exept (hahsm isn't that what everyone says)I used only 1 stick (1/2 cup)butter and almost 1/2 cup applesauce. I found this recipe while looking for a recipe I could use to replace some butter with applesauce to make a less fat recipe. It turned out incredibly delicious, I made it this afternoon and there is only about 1/4 left. My kids and hubby devoured it. Ok Ok I heloped. I think I have cut myself a 1 inch piece almost every time I walked into the kitchen this afternoon too. I just couldn't help myslef. Personnally I would give the taste 4 stars but being that it was so incredibly simple to make I gave it the full 5 stars. It doesnlt gt much easier. Next time, maybe tomorrow, I am going to try it with half butter half applesauce and will post teh results. Also I may add just a little more of the rasberry preserves. Probably about 1 1/4 cups. I felt it could use a little more. If you are short on time or are just looking for a super simple recipe that still tastes great this is it.

I like the overall concept and the simplicity of the recipe although I will not make it again as written because I didn't care for the yellow cake mix flavor. If I make it again I will use a lemon cake mix and perhaps add a bit more moisture or an egg to the crumbs for the base crust portion. I also think that less sugar in the fruit mixture would taste better as there is plenty of sweetness in the cake mix.

Made it twice, once with a blackberry jam on a sugar free yellow cake base, and once with raspberry on a lemon cake base. They were both delicious. I don't know if the cake base made a huge difference, but I did prefer the raspberry. I also substituted half the butter for apple sauce, and added a splash of milk. I added a splash too much on the second one and it was significantly harder to spread as it was too gooey. Probably would be fine without it at all. Both versions were a huge hit with our guests at a surprise birthday party. Thanks for the recipe!

Just made this for the 1st time for a family gathering and after tasting it I don't want to share it with anyone!  It is so yummy!  Because I wanted a lot of fruit filling I used 2 cups of frozen raspberries and 1/2 cup of raspberry jam to sweeten it.  Used lemon cake and lemon juice instead of water.  Also added 1/2 cup more oatmeal to the topping mixture and baked for 23 min.  Perfect!  Thanks for the great recipe.  Will use again soon.

I give this recipe 4 stars, but my co-workers rated it a 5. I thought there could have been more filling, but that might just be a matter of taste. One thing is for sure, it's extremely easy and quick to make, leaving very little clean-up and saves a person from going to a dinner party empty-handed if for some strange reason they forgot they volunteered to bring a dessert . : )

I read a few of the suggestions and added a Tbs of milk to the cake mix/oat mixture to make it less crumbly. I used strawberry preserves and added about 3/4 of fresh raspberries and then I melted white chocolate chips to drizzele over top once it was cooled. I think having the tart fresh berries cut the sweetness and gave it a great contrast. All I can say is Yummy and will be making this recipe again!

Excellent! Replaced water with lemon juice and added a splash of milk to the cake/oat mix. End result was very moist and perfectly tart. These were all gone by the end of the party I took them to! :)

If someone feels the bars are too sweet they can use low-sugar jam or even sugar free. This recipe begs for experimenting because it's so easy. Try a spice cake mix with apple filling and a little cinnamon...yum.

Will make again with the splash of milk, but I might only use a half tablespoon of lemonjuice - they were really lemony with a full tablespoon!

I make these often and they always disappear quickly. My own special touches: after spreading the jam, sprinkle about 1 cup of white chocolate chips. Then, I add 1/2 to 1 cup of chopped walnuts to the remaining cake mixture for the topping.

These were super yummy! I read that people suggested more jam, so in mine I added a pkg of raspberries, tossed some sugar on them and mixed and chopped them in with the jam. I did also add about a tsp of vanilla to the batter. Because of the added raspberries, it was more moist and needed to be baked a few minutes longer. Would make these again for sure!

just made these with a few changes, they are delicous even warm, just a tad too sweet.  I took out 1/2 cup of the white cake mix and replaced with oats, add a large handlful of chopped walnuts to the mix and took out about 2/3rd and added 1 egg, 1 TBS milk, 1 tsp vanilla to bottom mix.  Spread low sugear apricot butter and a handful of choc chips and put on remaining topping, baked for 28 minutes, they came out great!!

These are AMAZING!! The first time I made them exactly by the recipe and they were delicious. The second time, I made them with blueberry jam instead of raspberry, and I took some of the other reviewers' advice and added some milk. I only wanted the bottom layer dense, so I divided the oat mixture in half before adding milk, then added milk to the half I was going to use for the bottom. This made them really dense but still kept the crumbly topping.

I made these for an open house event, and I was disappointed with the taste. I was trying to save a little time, so I went with this recipe, instead of a "from scratch" one. I could definitely tell it had an artificial taste to it. No one commented on these bars, and there were many left over. If you are looking for super easy, this is it, but not super tasty.

The other Oatmeal Raspberry Bar on here is much better. This does not deserve such high ratings. Too much...too cakey, I love sweet but this is not to my liking.

These are wonderful.  I didn't have quite enough raspberry jam so I added some strawberry too.  I also substituted the lemon cake mix instead of the yellow.  Everyone loved them!  I will also add more jam next time as some of you suggested.  DELICIOUS!

These are wonderful!  Took to a PTA meeting and they disappeared.   Will make again and again.  A nice touch,  melt some vanilla candy coating and drizzle over the top.   Can easily use different types of jelly too!

Super easy and Super yummy!!!  Tried them once, on a whim.  Had many requests for additional batches.  The first time, I made just as the recipe called for.  GREAT!!1  Then I played around.  added some sliced almonds and brown sugar to the topping.  Substituted blueberry jam for the raspberry.  Used strawberry jam and added some diced walnuts to the cake mixture.  All variations turned out amazingly well and got rave reviews.

Yummy, my husband ate these up.  He liked the oats and raspberry combination.  When you need a quick and easy dessert or something to take to a pot-luck, try these.  Like Mallery said, I think the lemon cake mix would be very good too, I will try it as well.

My family and I didn't really care for these bars to much. They didn't have enough Rasberry flavor and tasted too much like dry cake mix. I think a different mix might have helped,I used a vanilla flavored and the aftertaste was too strong.

This is a very good recipe for a quick, tasty treat.  Subsituting the lemon juice in place of the water is a good idea and it enhanced the raspberry filling.  You do need to wait for it to coo completely, or else you will need a scoop to get it out of the pan.

I took the suggestions of others and substituted applesauce for the margarine and lemon juice for the water.  Everyone loved them and asked for the recipe.  They were too sweet for me!  It was hard spreading the cake mix and oatmeal mixture in the pan as it was VERY sticky.

Fantastic recipe!  Very easy to make and not bad for you.  I used applesauce instead of butter.

Very good, held together better than I expected. Had to use lemon cake mix as that is all that is offered in the country I live in, but the raspberry/lemon was a nice mix. Added slivered almonds to top it, looked nice.

Too Sweet! I used to make these using this recipe and I loved them. I lost the recipe and started making a from scratch version in the mean time. I was excited to again find this recipe as I remember liking them. Problem is the scratch recipe is so much better and not horribly sweet like this one.

Such a tasty treat.  I follow the recipe step by step.  I used low sugar raspberry jam with a splash of lime juice.  I've been dieting so every calorie counts.  A small piece takes care of the sweet tooth.  Enjoy!

Made this with the recommended lemon juice instead of water - an absolute delight.  Whole household loved them.  I found that refrigerating them before cutting helps them hold together - even if they sit overnight the jam was so soft that the bars would fall apart.

Our family really loves this recipe, but I did make some modifications based on what I had on hand and on the reviews.  Subbed 2 cups old fashioned rolled oats for the quick cooking oats.  Added 1 T. almond extract, 1 T. milk, and 1/4 c. applesauce and reduced the margarine to 1/2 cup in the cake/oat mixture.  Used 2 cups raspberry jam and subbed 1 1/2 T. lemon juice for the water.  Very easy to prepare, wasn't too hard to spread in the pan for the bottom layer, but sprinkling the crumbs over the top layer was much more difficult due to the stickiness of the dough - (due in large part to the changes I made)- The bars did crumble some, especially the first two out of the pan, but otherwise held up pretty well. To be honest I tried all the modifications, but I think either going with either 1.) just the applesauce substitution or 2.) just the milk addition because the dough is pretty sticky if you do both at once.  Will definitely make again, with only one of the above changes for adding moisture to cut down on the stickiness.

These turned out great...but were annoying to make.  I added unsweetened applesauce instead of half the butter and they it was so terribly sticky it took forever to get them to stay in the pan and not all over my hands.  Was almost not worth making a little more healthy because it took so long.

This was delicious!  I took it to a Bible study group and everyone loved it!  I added 1 tsp vanilla and 1 Tbsp milk to the cake and oat mixture, and it turned out perfect!  It was not crumbly at all.  I also used 1 1/4 cup raspberry preserves.  I will definitely make this a lot...it was so easy!  I can't wait to make it with different kinds of jam!

really good and really simple.  I made it with lemon cake mix and did 1/4 c. Earth Balance 1/2 c. applesauce (healthier).  The batter was really sticky so I had to use wax paper to spread it.....really yummy though!  Great Sunday brunch treat!

Well, I won't make these again because they taste like cake mix (which I like, don't get me wrong) and I was hoping the cake mix flavor would be less obvious. These taste exactly like cake mix with raspberry jam.  If you don't mind that, then give the recipe a shot. My little boy loved them and keeps asking me to make them again, but I'll keep looking for a more "homemade" tasting recipe.  Thanks anyway!

These are great!  I added 1 Tbsp. lemon juice instead of water to the jam.  Then I sprinkled some white chocolate chips on the jam before adding the rest of the oat mixture.  When they first come out the oven they are crumbly and don't hold together, but wait until they are cool, then they keep their shape.  Next time I think I will make them in a smaller pan so they are thicker.

Very Simple recipe that I just had to jazz up!  I only used 2 cups quick oats and added 1/2 cup chopped pecans.  Also I added 1 cup white chocolate chips on top of the jam.  Both were great additions.  I can't wait to try this recipe again using a lemon cake mix as other viewers have suggested.  And I would also like to try it with unsweetened applesauce in place of the butter.

I am a huge fan of yellow cake mix, so I thought I would love these bars - but I didn't.  I took them to a work party and came home with more than half a pan left!They are okay, but I will not make them again.

I'm so glad I waited until today to review these.  Out of the oven we considered them to be....eh...not that great.  They seemed to have a chemical or artificial quality to them.  I figured I'd be throwing some out.  But I had one this morning for breakfast and quite enjoyed it.  These are really good at room temp and the texture is just right.  Just a little bitty square is plenty, I got 18 servings in a 9x13 and the serving size was perfect.

Not quite the "bars" that I was expecting.  After sitting for a bit, they were a little gooey on the bottom and crumbly on the top so eating them neatly was definitely an issue.  I would've given them 3 stars but I did give them 4 because all of the kids loved them (oatmeal and all!)  Didn't find them overly sweet as some others had mentioned but they are filled with jam (i.e., chock full of sugar) so they are more of a snack than an oatmeal breakfast.  The only change that I made was using strawberry preserves.

I pretty much like anything sweet but the bars tasted like dry cake mix there wasn't enough jam either and I added more than what was recommended. The cake mix makes it much too sweet and I've never complained about anything being too sweet in my life.

This was good and extremely easy!  I used the ingredients but changed the procedure a bit.  The jam & water I heated in the microwave for about 10-15 seconds, to make it more easy to spread.  And instead of a 9x13 pan, because I thought that was too big and it would be too thin a bar, I used an 8x11 pan..which made it the perfect thickness for me.  And I baked it for about 30 mins.
Definitely let it cool to set before cutting.

I made these with lemon cake mix. I didnt care for HOW lemony it was that way. next time I'll use yellow cake mix and just add some zest, and a little lemon juice to the Jam. I think that way they would have been a 5.

These were really yummy. They were a little stiffer than I thought they would be, but the flavor was great. I even substituted some currant jelly (leftover from making cranberry sauce for Thanksgiving) and mixed it with raspberry jam, and it tasted great. I'll definitely make it again.

I used lemon cake mix and lemon juice, few splashes of milk and they held together nicely.  The key is to let them cool.  I didn't really care for them past the first one, too MANY flavors going on.  I think with the regular cake mix it would've been SWEET, but not overpowering.  This would probably be awesome with a chocolate cake mix and raspberry jam..hmmm, i'll have to try that! :)

Excellent!  Every body loved it.  I used fresh strawberries smashed instead of the jam.  It really taste so great.

SO GOOD!  Husband and I LOVED it!  I added 1 tbsp half and half to blackberry simply fruit preserves (and water) and a splash of half and half to cake mix. I also used reduced fat yellow cake mix. served warm with a big scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Will be great for breakfast too!

I used a lemon cake mix, cause I like the lemon and raspberry flavors together.  However I think 2 1/2 cups of oats is to much.  I will scale back on them the next time.

Very tasty but VERY sweet.  I used strawberry instead of raspberry which may be why they're so sweet.  But it is a very quick and easy recipe.

EASY! I made the bars just as the instructions said except I used a slightly larger pan, and chilled the bars for 4 hours before cutting into squares.  I brought them to a dinner at church and got rave reviews.  The kids and adults loved them.  Quick and easy, finger dessert.

Easy and fun to make.  This would be a great kid friendly recipe.  I made it alone but could see how this would be something my 4 young children could even make.  I used strawberry preserves since that's all that I had on hand and used the lemon juice in place of water, also I didn't have the quick oats so I used the long cooking ones and just soaked them in a little water for a few minutes and then pressed the water out of them before adding to the cake mix and butter mixture.  This worked perfectly.  My family enjoyed them. Thank you!

Very, very delicious.  My boyfriend loved them.  The only thing I would do differently is add the splash of milk that others suggested, and double the filling.  I can't wait to make again!

Very good, and very easy to make. I followed the above recomendatons and added splashes of milk and they turned out excellent.

I disagree though, that you cannot taste the yellow cake - I thought the yellow cake flavor in these was very strong. So as long as you like cake, you'll love these

I made the chocolate cake mix/strawberry jam version of this recipe and used butter instead of margarine.  It tasted pretty good...in fact, better the next day.  My only complaint is that it turned out kind of crumbly.

This was very easy/quick/cheap to make, but  it was WAY too sweet and rich.  I used just one stick of margerine instead of 1 1/2 and other than that followed to a T.  It didn't taste terrible, just overkill. It was like eating cake mix from the box....eh.  You really can kill a dish with too much sugar. Won't make these again.

This was pretty good actually. I made it lastnight for dessert and served it with vanilla ice cream. I warmed up the squares first in the microwave for a few seconds because I had made them earlier in the day. I actually had to add MORE lemon juice and I added a bit of milk too. But I had to add more than what this recipe said. I added bit by bit, and water too, until I thought it looked the way this recipe says its suppose to look. They weren't too bad. :) My guest liked them! I'll definitly be making these again.

I used real butter and a splash of 2%and my oat mixture came out in a big ball which worried me.  However, it made it easy to split in in half.   I used wax paper to press the first half into the pan.  I also used fresh lemon juice rather than water in the jam.
I think it makes a nice contrast to the sweet crust.  YUM.

This was very good.  This is the second time i am amking this, and decided to add more oats because the last time, it was very gummy.  This time, it was much better and stuck together well, and made half with strawberry preserves, and the other half with raspberry preserves.....in the same pan.  came out great, and gave the family a little variety.

This was great and so easy!  I used plum jam as it is tart and many other reviews spoke of the recipe being too sweet.  Turned out wonderfully!  Also, I used about 1 1/2 cups of jam - I like  things fruity.

Too sweet for my family's taste.  I didn't care for the overpowering margarine taste either.  Sorry.

I did not have yellow cake mix, but white and spice. I measured out exactly 18.25 oz of cake mix. I sprinkled mini chocolate chips in between and on top. I will use 1/2-1 cup more of raspberry jam and add a tablespoon of milk next time.

I used a lemon cake mix instead of the yellow and lemon juice instead of water.  Added a drizzle of chocolate over the raspberry.
I won't bother with the chocolate next time and will double the amount of raspberry Jam.

Needed a little something for a big church gathering and took a chance on this recipe.  I made it as written.....sort of!  I’m a butter girl, so I substituted that for the margarine AND I accidentally bought strawberry jam! So strawberry bars not raspberry.  Definitely would make this again....easy cheesy.

These were really good and easy to tailor to your tastes or what you have on hand. I had a spiced cake mix that was going out of date & needed to be used.  I was running low on butter so used 1/2 c butter and 1/4 c canola oil and also added 1 cup chopped, toasted walnuts and 1/2 tsp almond extract. The dough was so good that I was nibbling on it raw.

one tip is to heat you jam in the microwave for maybe 20 seconds and stir it up good so that it is easier to spread.  Since jam is pretty sweet and it only made a thin later, I decided to add a single layer of frozen mixed berries. I had to bake them an extra 8-10 minutes but they turned out perfect! The berries really helped give them a more natural fruit flavor even with using a box mix and jar or jam.

 I would make these again in a heartbeat and vary the flavor.  My coworkers love Nutella & I’d love to try that as a filling in these to bring to the office

My family loved these!  They were so easy to make.  My cake mix was a few ounces short of the stated one so I threw in 1/2 cup extra of oats and it came out well.  Will definitely be making these yummy bars again!

I've made this several times, and it is fantastic as is.   The last few times I only had white cake mix on hand, and I really liked it a lot better.  I've also experimented using cherry pie filling instead, which was also good.  And I've added almonds and coconut to the topping, which I will continue to do because it really made it spectacular!

These were very good and easy to make. I followed other’s suggestions by using the lemon cake mix and the lemon juice mixed in the raspberry preserves......great call!! However, I followed another suggestion to substitute applesauce for the butter to make these healthier. While they tasted fine, the cake mixture was very sticky and difficult to work with, especially when trying to crumble it on top. Just be warned. Made these several times and always a success!

9.2.17  Needed a quick and easy dessert for this evening, and it doesn’t get much easier than this recipe. Had open jars of blueberry and apricot preserves in the fridge (together just enough for 1 cup), so I did substitute that for the raspberry, as well as using butter instead of margarine.  Good texture, moist, sweet but not too sweet, and  yes, they do taste decadent.

A standard box of cake mix has shrunken from 18.25 to 15.25 oz (thanks a lot grocery shrink ray).  This means you need 2 cups+1 heaped tbs of oats, 10 tbs butter (1 stick plus 2 tbs), though you can keep the 1 cup of jam and 1 tbs water (still gooey and tasty).

Super easy tasty treat that I made the day before I served them.   Followed a number of reviewer suggestions:  used Duncan Hines French Vanilla (white) cake mix, added 1/2 t Vanilla, 1/2 t Almond Extract, 1 and 1/2 T Milk and substituted fresh lemon juice for the 2T water.    Used Rasberry Preserves instead of jam.  Used the entire jar which was a little less than 1 and 3/4 cups.  Started checking doneness @ 20 minutes.....took out of oven around 26 minutes.  Everyone raved and went back for seconds (and thirds!).  Definitely a keeper.

I was looking for a recipe that didn't require a trip to the grocery store.  I don't have great memories of jam-type bars from my childhood, but I thought I'd give it a try anyway.

While this was easy, I didn't enjoy it very much.  I took it to a friend's house and they seemed to enjoy it.  I gave them the leftovers because I didn't want to eat it again.

I wanted more fruity filling & for it to be less crumbly.  If I made it again, I'd need to make some major changes.  I double or triple the filling & add some canned or frozen fruit if I had it on hand.  I'd also use a bit more butter so that the top crumb layer wasn't dry and powdery.

You can use any kind of jam or preserves with this recipe.  I've made this several times.  It's good with the yellow cake mix; it's really good with chocolate cake mix!  Next time I'm going to make it with cherry preserves and chocolate cake mix---Black Forest Oatmeal Bars!

although the recipe is easy to follow i made a few changes, first off you need a full cup of butter in order to have no dry ingredients left and i use 2 full cups of raspberry preserves so you get a thicker layer in the middle

This turned out great and was really simple. I added a dash of cream to the bottom layer to keep it from being crumbly. ( I was out of milk). I omitted the water but I think lemon would have been a nice addition.

I made it with melted butter and whole berries instead. The cake-part remained a bit crumbly. Making it again, I'd mush up the berries and either use margarine (simply didn't have any on hand at the time) or use butter with some corn oil. Tasty with ice cream.

These are absolutely delicious!  You can use different bases such as others have suggested.  I am going to try a chocolate and cherry mix next.  Easy and simple to make a hit with picky kids.  Last batch I used spread peach preserves on one half and cherry on the other.  Yummy!

So delicious and so easy! Love these! You can use almost any jam/filling. My favorite is Cherry Jam.

I'm giving the original recipe 3 stars because I changed it so much.  The way I made it, definitely 5 stars.  I used a lemon cake mix (16.5 ounces), 2 1/2 c old fashioned oatmeal (b/c that's what I had) and 1 cup of butter.  It was sticky, but I let it sit, stirring it every few minutes, and after about 20 minutes/half an hour the butter had soaked into the dry ingredients and the dough was crumbly.  At the time, I was making homemade raspberry jam and had about a cup and a half of mashed raspberry left.  I put it into a pot with a third of a cup of sugar and simmered it down until it was thickened; I then added about half a cup of finished jam and the consistency was perfect.  I then followed the recipe, pressing the dough into the pan, spreading the raspberry mixture on top of that, and crumbling the rest of the mixture on top; pressed it down slightly to adhere.  Took about 23 minutes to cook.  Then as it was cooling, made a liquidy vanilla glaze with milk, powdered sugar, butter and vanilla and drizzled it from a baggie with a hole cut in the corner.  Waited until it was barely warm to cut into squares - it cut beautifully.  I served it on July 4 with homemade vanilla ice cream and my family said it was amazing and tore it up.  Not something to have all the time, but definitely a special treat - and the extra raspberry flavor made it even better.  I'm glad I increased the amount of filling and used fresh berries and not all jam for the filling.

So easy and so good! I've made these in so many different combinations and they have all been good. One of the favorites and requested over and over is cinnamon in with the oats and cake mix, also put a little cinnamon in the apple pie filling. Any fruit pie filling would work. I want to try the lemon cake mix now :) I also put a whole can of pie filling or at least double the jam.

Made exactly as written with the addition of the cream cheese frosting drizzle mentioned by schoolcook.  So easy, so good!  Next time I'm increasing the amount of jam, maybe, but these are great as is.

Excellent snack item! Made this two days ago & it vanished very quickly.  I followed other reviewers' advice & made it with the lemon juice alternate & a splash of milk into the oatmeal mix. This second time around, I increased the oatmeal to 3 cups & I used butter (1 cup) instead of margarine, & my mixture was not crumbly at all.  Thank you Megan, for your delicious contribution!

Changed the recipe a bit since I didn't have a white or yellow cake mix. I used a german chocolate mix, 1 can of raspberry pie filling, 1 tbls milk, 1.5 cups quick oats with flax and 1 cup old fashioned oats, 3/4 cup unsalted sweet cream butter. Gave it 4 stars because it was too rich for my tastes but chocolate loving hubby thought it was swell! Chocolate and rasberry went very well together. This is such a super simple recipe and can be deviated from quite easily.

YUM!  I did change two things though.  1) Substitute the water for Lemon Juice 2) After you put the Raspberry Jam mixture onto the crust sprinkle it with either milk or dark chocolate chips, then sprinkle the rest of the crust on.  It is SO good!

I love these, but they are so sweet I can only have a little piece at a time which I suppose is good for the waistline.  I've also done these with French Vanilla cake mix, nice little kick of vanilla to it.

Thinking I would love it, I took the advice of others and increased the jam to 1 1/2C which proved to be too much - thus the extreme sweetness and difficulty keeping them together. Also,next time I will put just over 1/2 the dough on the botton to add stability. They were "almost" cool when I cut them so chilling them helped remedy the problem that caused me! Great suggestion to use the lemon cake and lemon juice!

I thought that these were alright. They are a little too sweet for my tastes but maybe I'll have to try it again. I used butter instead of margarine, lemon juice instead of water and blueberry jam instead of raspberry.  I also added a splash of milk as another reviewer had suggested. I'm not crazy wild about these but I'll give 4 stars because they are super easy to make and people at work seemed to really like them. :-)

Everyone loved these bars & they were so easy to make.  I needed something quick & this recipe definitely fit the bill!  I made only minor changes to the recipe; I used an extra 1/2 cup of jam & instead of water, I added 1.5 tablespoons of non-dairy creamer to the jam.  I microwaved the jam for 30 seconds (as another poster suggested) & mixed in the non-dairy creamer after that.  I did have to bake them for 27 minutes & they came out perfect.  I usually use my convection oven but I was baking something else in it at the time so I used my regular oven for the bars.  Next time, I will use my convection oven & adjust the time to around five minutes less.

I followed the advice of other reviewers and substituted lemon juice for the water and added a splash of milk to the mixture.  I also used a lemon cake mix.

I have now made this recipe several times and it has received rave reviews!  I'm always asked for the recipe (and slightly embarrassed at how easy it was!).  

To the other reviewers who have commented on it being overly sweet, I have to wonder what they were expecting when they picked a recipe made of basically nothing but a box of cake mix and a jar of jam?

I made this exactly as stated in recipe. It was very very quick and easy to make. Easy to cut and did turn out well. I would NOT make again though. Tastes very much like cake mix right out of the box,most anyone tasting it would figure out it was made out of cake mix.

Loved this recipe.  It was quick and easy and I had all of the ingredients on hand.  It's not to sweet and great with a cup of tea.

Not too much work, smells and tastes delicious!  I added some finely chopped very-ripe strawberries to the jam mixture.  They did turn out pretty gooey and messy- but once COMPLETELY cooled (I put mine in the refridgerator) they were easier to handle.  Also would be yummy hot out of the oven with vanilla ice cream!

These were so easy you would think they take more work.  They have been a big hit at work and at bake sales.  I never have any to bring home.
