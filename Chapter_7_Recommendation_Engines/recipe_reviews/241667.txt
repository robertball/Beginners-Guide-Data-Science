Super easy to make. Since I already had a box of brownie mix sitting around, I used that & just drizzled them w caramel ice cream topping. I made them regular size since I don't have a mini muffin tray & they came out perfectly. Just give them a few extra minutes of cooking time.

These were very tasty. Unfortunately, they were really hard to get out of the little papers, they didn't taste like s'mores, and I ran out of caramel halfway through. It was a little labor-intensive for just me but I'm sure little fingers would love to help.
