OMG! This is great!!! I used Hellmans Light mayo and cut down on the oil.  I don't measure things out just eyeball and taste.  Did not have any parsley but added some poppy seeds.  I might not add the sugar the next time as I think the honey is sweet enough. I did use apple cider vinegar and balsamic vinegar as I did not have any white vinegar. Also used a little French's mustard and some ground double superfine mustard as I really did not know which one to use. Turned out wonderful!!!!! I am impressed.

I had been searching for a good honey mustard dressing recipe, and when I saw one reviewer say it tastes like the one from Red Lobster, I had to make it.  Well, in my opinion, I would say it tasted anything like Red Lobster.  It was to runny, to vinergary, not enough mustard.  I had to add more mustard about 1Tbl worth. and a bit more honey to cut down the vinegar flavor.  Nothing I did thickened it, as it was just a pool of dressing on my plate.  However, all that aside, it was a decent dressing, and much better than the ones I have tried in the grocery stores, but not exactly restaurant quality.

I would give this 10 stars if I could.  It's absolutely delishious!!!  Fine restaurant quality, but you can't use regular mustard (gross)...you MUST use a good Dijon for this one.  A DEFINITE keeper.

Rave reviews from the dinner party I tested this recipe on tonight! I subbed onion powder for the onions, skipped the parsley, and halved the oil; it was a bit runny, but absolutely delicious. Thank you for making my salad the hit of the party!

I was looking for a good honey mustard salad dressing and was going to try one of the other recipes that had more reviews but decided to take a chance. I am so glad I did. This dressing was amazing! My husband doesn't like onions and so that was the only thing I omitted but I did everything else the recipe called for. It was absolutely delicious. It is a favorite at my home and will definitely a regularily used recipe! Thanks for submitting it.

Excellent dressing...for those that say it's too tangy, cut back on the vinegar by half.  I used Dijon Mustard after reading others say it was far superior than using regular (and very true, what an awesome flavour), I replaced the mayo with fat-free sour cream and used EVOO in place of vegetable oil.. I am now in heaven with this dressing! I even used it as a glaze on a baked piece of salmon last night! OH so YUMMY! Thanks for the recipe, my new FAV!

This was great drizzled on my salad of chopped iceberg lettuce, mandarin orange segments, dried cranberries and garlic croutons.  I left out the extra sugar - was sweet enough for me with just honey.  Use a good dijon mustard for extra flavor punch!

This dressing is a champ!  My hubby happens to be a fussy salad eater and generally will skip most dressings so they don't ruin his salads.  Made a spinach salad and this yummy dressing went with it perfectly and I didn't change a thing. Oh, may I add that the forementioned picky husband loved it?  Thanks you for putting this out for others like me to copy and enjoy.

This is very good and easy to make. Why buy salad dressing  when its this easy to make!  I  omitted the chopped onion and I  used less oil.  I used   more mustard- maybe 1 T.-- sort of eye balled amounts and  I made it in my blender  and  it came out  smooth.

Good, but do not put so much vinegar. Next time I'll mix all ingredients first then slowly add vinegar to taste. Also the I would have thought the dressing would be yellow in color but that is not the case. Still pretty good

Love this dressing!! I used Dijon mustard instead of regular and didn't use as much vinegar. Also, it is a little runny but our family doesn't use that much dressing so the texture was fine for our preference. This recipe is definitely a keeper, thank you so much!

This dressing is perfect as is. I followed it exactly. I didn't have dry mustard, and wasn't really sure what they were calling for, but I used just plain mustard out of the fridge and it turned out great. I didn't find it too overpowered by the vinegar or the mayonnaise as some reviewers have written. It is not a creamy dressing if that's what you're looking for, but it drizzles nicely over salad and sticks well, not running off. You don't need much to add a nice flavor! The only suggestion I have would be to cut the recipe in half. It makes a lot! We didn't even use half of it on a large family sized dish of grilled chicken salad. But I wouldn't change anything!

This is so good.  I used stone ground mustard, doubled the amount.  Added more mayo, cut the oil in half (using EVOO), cut the vinegar in half(using apple cider vin.) and used onion powder, and dried parsley.  If I imagined the perfect honey mustard salad dressing, this would be it.  I love it and will definitley make again!!

This was great!  I was having company and realized that I did not have any salad dressing on hand.  This was perfect as it was easy to make and I had all the ingredients on hand in my kitchen.  I added more sugar and next time would not use so much vinegar.  Also I used Miracle Whip in instead of mayo.

Really good! Didn't have the parsley or onion, threw in some garlic powder instead and didn't use the full 1/4 c oil cause it was a little thinner than I like, but really tasty over chicken salad!

Very good dressing!  I didn't have all the ingredients so I had to substitute just a couple of things.  It was still very good.

I normally don't like to review recipes if I am not able to do it EXACTLY as written but this created something so delicious I had to say something and thank you! I didn't have onion and I used dried parsley. I followed all measurements perfectly but used a mixture of balsamic and apple cider vinegar. The only oil I use on my salads is EVOO so that was used in place of veg. oil. The only mustard I had was spicy brown. haha So its the right ingredients just different types of what you use! I LOVE it!! I read that others found it too thin but thats how I like dressings to be. I don't like thick, fatty, overly saturated salads. This is perfect to pour over a large salad and just toss and serve. Mmmm It all fit perfectly into my 16 oz salad dressing bottle I had with just enough left over to make a salad right away ;) Thank you.. great recipe!

It was quite tasty, although i thought it might come out a little thicker. I did half regular vinegar and half apple cider and it was wonderful. I recommend for spinach salad. It coats wonderful!

My husband took a bite out of his salad and all I heard was "mmmmm". He loved the dressing, as did I. The dressing was quick and easy to make. I made a salad, only to look in the fridge and see we had no dressing. I pulled up all recipes and I had everything that was required for this. We put it in the freezer for about ten minutes, took it out &  ate it as is. Typically I would have refrigerated it for awhile but didn't have the time and it was still good. Thanks for the recipe.

This dressing is pretty good....It needs A LOT more mustard. Otherwise, it just tastes like mayo! I suggest about 1-2 T or more of mustard....I too used a mix of dijon and yellow french's mustard ( it gives it a bright yellow color). I also added more honey/sugar like other viewers suggested. It is very runny, so you dont need to use that much on a salad. I also squeezed in a hint of lemon juice. I might make this again, it needs more tweeksing but still a good dressing overall!

Needed a quick dressing w/ ingredients I already had; this was great!  It is delicious!  It's pretty sweet, and I didn't use the sugar, just the honey.  I also used only 1/4 cup vinegar.  I loved the amount of mustard flavor combined w/ honey!

Delicious!!!  I served this over spinach with cranberries, pecans, cheese, egg and avocado.  My hubby was super pleased and so was I.  I chose to double the mustard and use yogurt for half of the mayo.  Yum.

Not the best dressing I've made.  The flavor balance was off.  It was very tangy, and didn't have a strong mustard flavor, despite the name.

This is a great recipe.  I have been looking for quite some time for a great honey mustard dressing that is creamy more than a vinaigrette based honey mustard.  This one will stay in the front of the recipe book.  I added about 3 times as much mustard as called for because I like my dressings with a little zing.  Great recipe.. highly recommended.

The ingredients themselves are good (besides the onion - use onion powder instead), but the mayo takes over this recipe as written.  Use half of the mayo called for, add twice as much mustard, and make sure to use apple cider vinegar - it turns out much better!

So yummy. Super easy and I think most people would have the majority of ingredients on hand. I also used low fat miracle whip and less oil.  It is not a low fat dressing for sure, but don't make a mayo based dressing if you are worried about it (obviously)

Very easy and good - I added some dry mustard (Colman's) in addition to dijon mustard to make it a little spicier.

This is quite delicious! I didn't have any mayo, so I used Greek Yogurt for the base, added half the vinegar needed, several tablespoons of stone ground mustard and only about a tablespoon of the oil. Can't wait to try it on salad! :D

I really like the flavor of this recipe. I took into consideration previous reviews and modified the recipe as follows: 1/4c apple cider vinegar, 1/2c mayo, no sugar, 1/2t of onion powder and 1/4c EVOO. I kept everything else the same. I liked how it turned out and it was not too thin.

This was just what I was looking for to change it up from our usual vinaigrettes.  It was creamy, but not too heavy and rather refreshing with the tangy vinegar  and fresh parsely.  I used apple cider vinegar, Dijon mustard, spring onion, and canola oil.

This has a good flavor, but the "texture" is very thin and runny.  It was almost like pouring milk on my salad.  I halved the recipe. Probably won't make again unless someone has a good way of making it emulsify.

Due to the economy, and my shortened work hours, my kitchen cabinets are relatively empty...something I've never experienced before.   So I had to bring some salad home from my job's cafeteria (along with an apple, and a yogurt) so I could have something to eat for dinner.   I opened my fridge only to realize I had no dressing. Jumped onto this site and found this recipe. All I can say is it came in REAL handy and did the job just fine.   I used Sherry vinegar because that's all I had. I used only sugar because I'm out of honey and didn't have money to buy more. I used onion powder and dried cilantro flakes, once again it was all I had. It tasted just fine and I actually prefer it over the bottled stuff.   A MILLION THANKS!

Really good, super easy to make with things you already have. I used spicy brown mustard, and went a little less on the vinager. I always use fat free mayo, and extra virgin oilive oil, and it is great. Can't wait to have it tonight!

I made this exactly as described.  It was too thin, too vinegary and did not have enough of a mustard flavor for my taste.  I ended up doubling the mayo, and also approx 1/8 cup of regular and 1/4 cup of dijon mustard, and doubled the honey.  Next time I will leave out the sugar, as I prefer honey as a sweetener.

The dressing was a little bit too sweet and not much mustard flavor to it. I left out the onion, used less oil, and added more mustard. It was very easy to make and I didn't have to go out and buy any special ingredients for it which was nice.

I used white vinegar and cut back on the sugar to 3/4 tsp.  Has a really nice tangy flavor that will be excellent on a spinach salad as suggested.  If you like a thick dressing this is not it.

I love this dressing. So versatile, I can pour over cob salad to Jamaican coleslaw or use as a dip and can turn any drab salad to a fab salad. One thing I love to add to this recipe is grated lemon rind (use organic!). The flavor will burst in your mouth!

I made this recipe as written and absolutely loved it.  I had left-over jerk chicken in the fridge and wanted to add it to my spinach salad, but the only honey mustard we had on hand was the dip my husband had made to go with dinner last night.  This dressing was the perfect fit for my salad.  Since it wasn't thick it didn't saturate the spinach leaves and overpower the other flavors and I didn't need as much dressing for the salad, which is great since its full of fat.  LOVED IT!

so yummy!! I'm sure this recipe is fantastic as is, but unfortunately I was out of onion and parsley.  so I made it without it and it seemed a bit thin. I had some prepared honey mustard in the fridge and added it in for thickness, which gave it a great flavor and texture.  thanks for the great recipe!

Good and interesting blend of flavors.  Definitely add the sweetener - I used splenda instead of sugar.  I tasted it before adding the splenda and it was too vinegary.  After adding the splenda, it brought out the honey flavor nicely.  I also used a stone ground mustard and red wine vinegar.  Kind of wish I used balsamic but I forgot I had it.

My husband loved this.  I found that I needed to add 3 tbsps of dijon mustard, less oil, so its not too runny.  I put it in the blender, I also added dash of cayenne, a few tbsps of fresh parsley and cilantro.  I liked it, I give it a 4, but my husband gives it a 5.

This was a very loose dressing.  I think it needs less vinegar.  The taste was good but it was too thin to be called dressing...maybe drizzle?  cause otherwise it is gonna be all over the place.

Quite a lovely dressing --- easy and with a tang.  Like some other reviewers, I skipped the sugar, added a bit more mustard.  A good "staple!"

This salad dressing has a very good taste to it, but it is very runny.  You can't put your salad on a plate with any other food, unless you want everything to be honey mustard!  I've made it twice, but I'm going to try other recipes to find one less runny.

This is a good dressing, but I think the vinegar and sugar could be cut out. I also added a lot more mustard, 1 TBS plus a tsp of whole grain mustard.

I ran out of salad dressing one night and  didn't want to run to the store, so thought I would give this one a shot and I love it!  Taste better than the kind  I buy at the store and it took about 5 min to make.

I used half the vinegar and half the oil since the reviews were talking about how thin the dressing was, I didn't have any onions or parsley so I used onion powder and omitted the parsley. I used regular prepared mustard. Next time I'll omit the sugar...I don't think it's necessary. The dressing was wonderful!

SO GREAT!!! I nixed the oil, used balsamic vinegar, onion powder, and fresh ground black pepper... Seriously, this is so much better than restaurant quality.  Would be good on ANYTHING!!! Easy to make it your own, too, thanks so much!!!

This was good- I just altered a little- added lemon juice & more dijon must b/c I thought it needed it- I also added in cashews from memory of an awesome honey cashew dressing from a restaurant I worked in several years ago, I also felt it needed some thickening- so I added in about 2 tbsp of flour- made enough for 2 people over dinner salads & about 1 cup leftover in fridge- will make again.

Quite good!  I found it a bit runny, but then again I only made enough for one serving so maybe I had the measurements slightly off.  Regardless, the taste was just what I was looking for :)

Outstanding recipe!  This makes 1 1/2 carafe (the size of sold with pkg. of Italian dressing at store), so could easily be split in half if you want a smaller portion.  The recipe portion is perfect to serve salad to a family of 4 or 5 a few times for a week.

If you don't have all the ingredients don't worry. I didn't add onion or parsley and then did my own little seasoning though. A very good dressing!

Yummy! My husband loved this too. Trying to make this lower fat, I added about a third cup of oil instead of a half cup. I also used low fat Best Foods mayo. I omitted the salt, pepper, and sugar. I also used Honeybaked ham company's mustard. It is a honey mustard.

This is now my go to Honey Mustard recipe. It is breeze to whip up and keeps beautifully. Using FF mayo doesn't appear to alter the taste much and adds a nice body. I use rice wine vinegar and shallot in place of the onion.

I wanted something different with my chicken salad and thought honey mustard sounded good. I found this one and saw I had all the ingredients. I whipped it up and it was superb with the salad. I would make a batch next time and eat it with chicken tenders. I would just add less vinegar and more honey for the thickness.

Made this recipe for the first time yesterday .... only one word "delicious".  Even my husband enjoyed and he can be fussy over new taste.  It delivers just the right amount of tang, thanks to the mustard.

Really great dressing! I made it with Miracle Whip and stone ground mustard + red wine vinegar. Absolutely yummy! Also have used it instead of egg dip for fried chicken or fish. Works well and tastes fantastic.

This is incredible!!! I quickly made it for lunch over a bed of lettuce with sliced veggies, cashews and hard boiled egg. Wonderful!!! I used a blender stick and it emulsified nicely. I did use less oil as suggested by other reviewers. Highly recommended!!

OMG!! is right.  This is the best honey mustard dressing I've had to date.  I didn't even include the oil because I was afraid I would mess up the taste.  My family loved it over mixed salad and pork chops!! Simply delicious.

Awesome! Delightful...I found it a bit thin for my taste when made to diretions (though still tasty!!) and added 1/2 cup mayo to mine for a thicker, smoother dressing.  To DIE for!

This was great! I followed it exactly and yes, it is a little runny, but it was delicious - sweet and tangy. I used it on a broccoli salad, which I think suited the consistency well.

I just made this tonight on the spur of the moment when I made salads and realised we didn't have any dressing.  I have to say it was very good.  It was a little on the thin side, but beleive me that did not affect taste at all.  It was sweet but not too sweet and tangy.  I did not find it to be too vinegary.  My family loved it to, my husband made me save the rest even though we are out of salad, said we can buy more salad for the rest.  I also thought it tasted much better than any store bought dressing.

This is a very sweet honey mustard dressing.  If you want it to be more spicy and mustardy, keep looking.  It's also a little on the thin side, so don't add as much liquid if you like your dressing thick.

The recipe is very good. My husband doesn't like ranch and so I was searching for a creamy dressing. This was a hit with him. He uses it on lots of other things too.
He also mixes this with BBQ sauce to make a sauce like RedRobin's campfire sauce to go with fries.

I scaled this recipe down to serve four. It turned out fantastic!!! Not too sweet and not too tart. I used dried parsley because I didn't have the fresh stuff on hand and it STILL turned out great!!!

Very yummy and easy.  Had all the ingredients on hand.  I read the directions wrong and added a tad more mustard than what was called for, but other than that this was great. Thanks.

Absolutely loved it!!!  Thank you so much for sharing.  This dressing is so much better than anything you can find at the store.  I've been using it as our everyday dressing but I can't wait to make a great spinach salad and use it.
