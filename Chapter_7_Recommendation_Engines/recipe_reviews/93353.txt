This was AWESOME!!!!  I cooked this at 325 Degrees and did NOT precook the tater tots.  I put the tater tots in the baking pan slightly thawed and they came out perfectly.

This was a great base recipe.  I like my food a little spicy, so I used seasoned french fries on the bottom.  I also sauteed finely diced onion and green pepper with the sausage, as well as added some cumin seeds to the mix.

I thought this was really good.  BUT, it doesn't say what degree to put the oven on.  I believe I put it around 400 degrees and the cheese on top was burned.  Also, I agree that the tator tots were sticking to the pan.  I would spray cooking spray on the pan. The idea was good though!  I'll make it again but i'd probly add milk with the eggs and cook it at 350 and keep a close eye on it!

This isn't my kind of thing at all, but I think Husband would eat Tater Tots for just about every meal if he could. The bottom did get a little dry, but he had it with some salsa. Thanks!
