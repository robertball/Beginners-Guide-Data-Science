This recipe didn't work so well for us. The covered-bowl-on-steamer-rack method in the pressure cooker didn't work at all, so we ended up having to finish the rice in a saucepan. Also: three tablespoons of garlic is insane. I love saffron risotto, and I love porcini risottoâ€”but somehow, these two lovely flavorful ingredients cancelled each other out. And then shrimp adds a whole other competing flavor.
