This recipe was good although I didn't enjoy the rice inside the burger patty. If you enjoy rice inside your patty, you may enjoy this recipe. It's worth a try!

My family loved these! Something different, and the sauce was yummy. I will be making these again soon.

My family and I really liked these! The only change to the recipe I made was that I only used a pound of hamburger (because that is all I had).  They were moist and had great flavor : ) Update: I put this recipe on my rotation and I love it even more now. I serve the burger with rice and a green vegetable. My husband uses the sauce on his rice too.  Great reheated or make ahead and freeze, cooking later.

These were surprisingly wonderful. I have never had a burger with rice in it and it was a great change. THe burgers were moist, and the sauce was pretty dog gone good too. Thanks.

I give it five stars because I didn't try the sauce. So I want to be fair. I like the flavor and it was great but more a four star recipe. The burgers are very moist. 
My changes were 1/4 cup bread crumbs because I didn't have rice. And no green peppers. They were very good.

These burgers were a hit with my family. The sauce tasted a little bit like cocktail sauce more than BBQ. However it accents the burger perfectly.
