This was very good over grilled steaks, but did need seasoning/salt. I omitted the green pepper. I would you red bell pepper next time to give it a pop of color.

i donâ€™t think you should add the cream and cheese until the end. I would add the cream, warm through, then turn the burner off and add the cheese- this might help with the clumpy texture some got. I added basil with a little lemon juice at the end. Good, but needs some tweaking.

Amazing!  After reading through the reviews I made minimal changes because we like seasoning in our food.  I added a healthy dose of white pepper and some thyme and went heavy handed on the mushrooms and onions.  No peppers because they aren't one of my favs.  SO good!!  We put it over steak.

I made this to serve over schnitzel. I omitted the green pepper and cheeses. Used vegetable stock for the chicken and reduced cream to 1/8 cup. I did not use the cornstarch slurry to thicken but whisked instant dissolving flour right into the pan untl it was my desired consistency. I also added seasonings of black pepper, Mrs Dash garlic& herb, salt free Emeril's Essence, garlic powder and onion powder. I added the wine first to cook off then added the cream, then thickened. It was very tasty!

Horrible! The proportions are way off. The cook times are way off. It ended up being a sloppy mess. A waste of food and time. Uneatable.

This sauce has very good flavor.  However, the cheese kept clumping up. Perhaps using shredded parmesan instead of grated would help?   Not having any shredded parm on hand, I ended up removing the clumps of cheese and putting the same amount of cream cheese in its place.  The sauce was delicious over chicken and pasta.

Omitted the peppers and added a pinch of oregano because we felt like it needed an herb.  Served over chicken cutlets with mashed potatoes and asparagus. Tasty!

I have made this recipe multiple times.  Mostly I omit the peppers.  I make this when I grill chicken.  My wife loves the mushroom/wine combo and it has a great flavor.  I pour on chicken and Mashed potatoes.  Delich!

I think the recipe has potential.  I followed it quite closely but we found it bland.  Maybe thyme or another herb would help.  I used a dry Reisling for the wine.  If I tried it again I would cut out the cornstarch and the cheese and reduce it for its thickness.

Very tasty.  I used red and orange mini sweet peppers instead of the green one.    This sauce is great with meatballs and a salad.
