These are amazing!  I took a chance and made them for Thanksgiving with no trial run, and I wasn't disappointed!  They're so light and have such a great texture, it's hard to believe how easy they were.  And this recipe let me worry about other things on Thanksgiving morning, and just pop these in the oven at the last minute.  I even had them at 350 instead of 400 degrees, because I was reheating some other dishes, and they still came out great.  Thanks for the recipe, I'll be making it every year!

This recipe is good, but I can't believe it doesn't say to ice them! To make it out of this world... here's what you do: frost them with a simple, thick powdered sugar/milk icing. Then if you like, roll the dough into 5 or 6 circles and cut them into more than 8 slices. This makes the crescents smaller and thus increases the icing to roll ratio. That's they way my Grandma makes them...mmmmmm! It's always been a family favorite! Enjoy!

When I made these, I thought they weren't going to work because the dough was so soft, but after overnight refrigeration, it was great to work with.  My family loves these!  The recipe makes so much, I sprinkled half with cinnamon sugar and we had them as breakfast rolls.  Great!

I wanted to make these rolls for Christmas dinner so tried them a few days before just to be sure.  They passed muster with the daughter-in-law and husband so they were a go.  They are so easy to stir up and I just got up on christmas morning and made them.  They were a big hit.  Wonderful flaky texture in fact the reason I am on here now is to send the recipe    to my daughter.  A 5 star keeper recipe.

I was attracted to this recipe because the description said "no kneading required" - and I was very pleased with the light, buttery rolls that this low maintenance recipe produced. This is perfect for people who want homemade yeast bread without the sweat. I ended up letting mine rise for almost 6 hours and I think they were even better and lighter because of it.

These are the best and easiest rolls ever. I've been making them for several years now. I like to use 2 1/2 cups of wheat flour and 2 cups of white. I've also used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup crisco...to cut down on the trans fat. It can't be any easier than stirring it all in a bowl and sticking it in the fridge. The dough can be left in the fridge for up to a week so you can have fresh warm rolls for dinner every night.

EXtemely easy to make. This was my first attempted to make rolls on my own. Very good flavor and nice texture. These went extremely well with the American Lasagna by Rosemary. Try it. It's definatly worth it.

made these with butter instead of shortening, didn't roll them out, just formed balls.  turned out good, kind of had the texture of a tea-biscuit, but people really liked them, and the no-kneading is a total bonus

When I want to make this rolls I was thinking why not I made this into a pizza base and I did! Half of the dough I make into rolls and the other half I make into 2 8" pizza base with topping consist of cheese, baked bean, sliced meat loaf and mayonise and it was yummy.

These are great!  I mixed them in my breadmaker and immedietly threw the dough into a bowl and put it into the fridge.  Rolled them out the next day for Christmas and baked them off later on.  WOW!  These do taste like the ones you can get at the store.  Even though they do take some time, your able to just make the dough, do what you need to do, roll them out, and again do what ever else you need to do.  I did however add an eggwash of beaten egg and cream to the top.  I also reduced the temp to 350, this way the risk of burning is not a big issue

This is good.  It has the taste and texture of store-bought crescent rolls.  My family likes it sprinkled with cinnamon sugar on top of the butter just before rolling.  The only thing I didn't like is that it takes 3-4 hours to rise so keep that in mind when you make this one.

Good, but not as good as my mom's in flavor. Baked for 15 minutes, and just barely starting to look golden. Most were still pale, but cooked. Started at 10am, had in fridge to rise by 10:30. Took out at 3:45 to roll out. Let rise from 4 to 5:45. Took to a function tonight and gone in no time flat. Split dough in thirds, so had 28 rolls. Tip I learned on a blog: to avoid waiting so long for milk to cool, heat 3/4c milk with shortening. Then, add 1/4c milk when removed from heat.

Very good! Tender, flaky and buttery. Need to watch carefully as bottoms will burn quickly, but with a little practice, these will be my standards!

This is a very good basic refrigerator dough. The instructions for assembling the rolls are incomplete--roll the dough into 12" circles, brush on butter (melted and cooled butter works better than softened butter), cut into 8 wedges (a pizza cutter works well here), and then roll into crescents. I also like to brush the tops of the rolls with butter. The rolls take a bit longer to bake than the recipe calls for--14 minutes in my oven and, yes, the temperature in my oven is accurate.

The recipe makes 32 rolls, which is a bit more than most families need at once, but as another reviewer said, the dough keeps in the refrigerator for a week or so. I cut the dough into quarters and form each blob of dough into a rough circle, then wrap it in plastic wrap to store in the refrigerator for later.

The dough also makes great cinnamon rolls. Take a quarter of the dough, roll it about 3/8" thick in a rough rectangle shape, brush with melted butter, sprinkle with cinnamon sugar, and roll up. Cut the roll into 9 equal sections, then arrange the rolls in an 8" x 8" greased pan. Brush with melted butter, cover loosely with plastic wrap, and let rise for 3 or 4 hours. Bake at 350 for about 25 minutes--keep a close eye on the rolls in the oven, because the sugar scorches quickly.

I also like to brush the tops of the rolls with butter. The rolls take a bit longer to bake than the recipe calls for--14 minutes in my oven and, yes, the temperature in my oven is accurate.

The recipe makes 32 rolls, which is a bit more than most families need at once, but as another reviewer said, the dough keeps in the refrigerator for a week or so. I cut the dough into quarters and form each blob of dough into a rough circle, then wrap it in plastic wrap to store in the refrigerator for later.

The dough also makes great cinnamon rolls. Take a quarter of the dough, roll it about 3/8" thick in a rough rectangle shape, brush with melted butter, sprinkle with cinnamon sugar, and roll up. Cut the roll into 9 equal sections, then arrange the rolls in an 8" x 8" greased pan. Brush with melted butter, cover loosely with plastic wrap, and let rise for 3 or 4 hours. Bake at 350 for about 25 minutes--keep a close eye on the rolls in the oven, because the sugar scorches quickly.

Easy dough to work with. Even my mother in law has started using this recipe for her holiday homemade rolls.

Way too much shortening!  I followed the recipe exactly and these were a flop - I had to add a lot more flour to get the dough to even form in order to make cresents.

I started these last night and had to resist the temptation to add more flour than the recipe calls for. Let them sit in the fridge over night and rolled them out using a 8 in pan lid to make even circles. Next time I'll try for 10 or 12 as 8 as a bit small but made 40 rolls. I used half the butter called for and they were buttery enough for me. Let them rise about 5 or 6 hours while I was at the movies and baked for 9 minutes when I got home. They turned out great with a little too much flour on the outside, next time I'll try rolling w/out flour.

Not bad, but mine didn't quite rise enough and came out a bit flat.  I did follow the recipe exactly, but I'm wondering if my fridge was too cold or something.  I'm encouraged by how easy they were, though.  So either I'll give this one more shot or I'll look for another substitute for the refrigerated crescent rolls.

These took a bit more time effort than I usually spend on roll, but they were worth it - buttery and light with a great flavor.  They got raves at Thanksgiving.  I followed the recipe exactly, other than using Butter Flavor Crisco instead of plain shortening.

No changes needed.  Crowd pleaser!  Note: to cut down on salt I use salt free butter for shortening.  Also makes them taste more buttery. Has become the requested "dish" that I bring to holiday gatherings.

Yummy!
I made a couple changes...very small ones! I have two small children and could hardly find the time to roll it out, spread butter, cut into triangles, and roll up. So I just rolled the dough in my hands into mini bun shapes and placed on pan. Then I only baked at 375 for about 6-7 mins. Baked just wonderful that way too. Nice, light and airy!
Thank you for a great recipe!

I am a high school foods teacher.  I have my students bring in a cookie sheet and each student takes a half recipe home to bake for their families.  This is a huge hit with the students.

I made these for Thanksgiving, and they were very good. But not sure if they were worth the trouble to make when I had lots of other Thanksgiving cooking/baking to do. Probably should have made Pillsbury Crescent Rolls instead. I will make these again, just not with a large holiday meal, unless someone is helping me. (My daughter did help roll them up and put them on the pan)

These were fantastic! They were so tender and just melted in your mouth. Didn't even need extra butter. I would definitely make these again. I've never made rolls or bread from scratch (other than with a bread machine), but these were simple and turned out great.

Not too bad.  Definitely something you want to eat fresh out of the oven, not too good the next day.  I used butter flavored shortening and the taste and texture were good.

These were good rolls - a crescent roll, really.  I found that they didn't stay well after standing around.  They tasted good.  However, right out of the oven - they were DELICIOUS!

They are so easy and sooooo good.  I have made them before and loved them. This year I was going to make them for Thanksgiving but one of my guests came really early and distracted me so I forgot to take them out of the fridge to let them raise so they didn't get made.  Yesterday (Saturday), which was 3 days after I put them on the fridge, I finally got around to making them and they still raised fine and were delicious.  So that is good to know for the future - you can make them way ahead.  Also, I actually let them raise in a warm oven (I heated it to 200 and then turned it off and put the rolls in) and they were good to go in 2 hours.

Love this easy recipe! These can also be made with half the flour replaced with whole wheat flour. I use 2 packets of quick rise yeast. They are a great recipe as a base for so much. Sweet filling or savoury. My son loves when I roll a triangle around a wiener and then bake it. My husband loves when I add garlic powder and Parmesan to the butter. They can even work with cinnamon and sugar added to the butter and then iced. Or try rosemary and Parmesan in the butter or shredded cheddar.

These didn't rise, but came out cute and tasted all right. Easy to make. They didn't taste like rolls, but more like cookie/cake thing, they were heavy and dense. I would not  recommend refrigerating them overnight, yeast doesn't work in the cold temperature! so I don't understand this step, just let the dough rise, and make them the same day. Or let them rise, and then refrigerate. 3 stars for taste. Will not make the same recipe.

Perfect for Sundays. They can rise while we're at church and be ready for the oven when we get home!! Very light and fluffy and just the right size.

I messed up on time and didn't allow for enough rise time. Even so, the rolls were light, fluffy and flavorful! I was a bit concerned the night before when I put the dough in the fridge, it was very sticky and not at all like dough. Although after just a little kneading they rolled out great. Thanks for the great recipe!

These turned out wonderful!  Had them for Thanksgiving and rolled them out and let them rise while the turkey was baking.  The timing was perfect!  They were light and flaky.  The only change I made was using butter flavor Crisco instead of regular shortening but that is just a personal preference.  Thanks for the delicious recipe!!

Hi all,

This is an excellent formula. I use Celtic sea salt it gives it a cleaner taste, and I boule the dough instead of rolling horns. Then fill the boules with sea salted butter from a pastry bag. I also have found hot proofing the rolls makes them much lighter. These are truly, literally killer. I call them a " Heart attack on a bun!" ;) Lolz, But they sure taste great and my customers sure love them!

Very good rolls! The only problem I had was the oven temp. It was a little high, and my rolls almost burned on the bottom while the top wasnt yet golden. Other than that, they were very easy to make, and devour!

SO GOOD!  I've made these twice now and, both times, everybody has commented on how amazing they are.

The first time was for Thanksgiving.  They replaced our regular roll recipe and the whole family loved them!

The second time was once when I needed something around to snack on for a few days, so I made them in my dorm room.  My roommates tried them and then basically ate most of them, haha!

There are SO MANY roll recipes and I continue to look for one that really gives me the flavor I am after. These rolls have a good taste (the cool rise lets the yeast develop more slowly = more flavor). However, the texture is odd, to me. I think it's the baking powder. There is something "biscuity" about them. The dough is also really difficult to work with because it's so soft. There are better recipes out there :(

This recipe is "ok."  The dough never rised for me (my yeast was fine, nothing wrong with it).  The flavor was very yeasty-tasting, and the texture was more denser than I prefer.  I very much appreciate you sharing the recipe, but it didn't do much for me.  I wouldn't make it again.

These were so easy to make and got rave reviews from my husband. I have never made homemade bread or rolls at all and so I was a bit nervous about making these for Thanksgiving. I am very glad I did though and will make them again!

Outstanding. I was very nervous with these because I had never made bread from scratch (without my bread maker). The recipe was fool proof and the results were outstanding. I ended up making my rolls a little too large, so I just cut some of them in half, and it worked out fine.

I made these exactly as written except I made them with butter instead of shortening and made them first thing in the morning and they were only in the refrigerator about 6 hours.  They rose nicely, rolled out well and were a huge hit at dinner.  Very rich and buttery tasting.  We will definitely have these again.

I am a high school Foods teacher and we made these in class. They were awesome! The kids loved them and found the recipe easy to follow. We loved that it was a batter method and no kneading was required! I will be making these for Thanksgiving this year since most of the work can be done the day before!

I tried to make these and they were a flop!  I will not pass judgement to the submitter, could have been my error.  They would not rise, and yes the yeast was fresh, brnad new.  Could be that they are great but not for me~

These were quite easy, and tasty. They are a doughy sort of roll, not a light fluffy one. They do not have a crunchy or crispy top, but are softer all the way through.  Still a good recipe.

These were very good, but they reminded me of the Sweet Rolls recipe from this site. I actually like the sweet roll recipe better, but I'll make these again though. Thanx!

Made these for Thanksgiving dinner. Good texture, decent flavor.  Nothing to write home about though.  They were all eaten though.

These were excellent rolls!  They were simple and I loved that you can overnight the dough!  How easy for Christmas morning.  I will be making these again, for sure!

Very rich rolls - no complaints here.  Easy to make.
