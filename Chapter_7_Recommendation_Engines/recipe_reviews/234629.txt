I make this sauce all the time for parties. I use frozen meatballs and cook it in the crock pot for simplicity.

These meatballs were delicious and so easy! The only change I would make is to crush up the StoveTop stuffing before adding it to the meat. I think it would make the meatballs less chunky. Will definitely make again.

This a very tasty meatball. The packaged stuffing mix added great flavor. I made this actually as written. I have made it many times now. I also have froze the meatballs and added sauce on serving day.Then served in a slow cooker for a brunch.

Great Idea!! We loved the sauce. I noticed that most people used premade frozen meat balls. I used 1.5 lbs of ground beef and 1 lbs of Italian hot ground pork sausage. I added about seasoning of about or more of the the following; onion powder, garlic powder, celery salt, mixed pepper seasonings, oregano, and parsley flakes with the Stove top chicken stuffing mix 2 eggs and I used a 1/4 cup of red wine and 3/4 cup of water. The sauce I did not change with the 12 oz of grape jelly and chilli sauce. (used sriacha)Awesome meatballs,, I never thought it would of been so good!!

Yep  I use Pepperidge Farm Seasoned Stuffing mix  It has herbs and not heavy on sodium.  I find cooking them on the stove, in the particular sauce, keeps them much more flavorful and never crunchy or browned like a commercial burger.  Simmer a large batch with a top and later lower heat to low.  It usually takes about 75 minutes at best!!

I put the sauce in the crockpot on high while I made the meatballs and at first I was nervous the sauce would be too sweet but once the savory meatball mixed with it... Heaven!  Thanks for the recipe!

Yummy! Took these to a church reception in a slow cooker.  Used four pounds of precooked frozen meatballs and doubled the sauce. I felt it needed more grape jelly than called for; otherwise would have given 5 stars. Will make again!

Great meatball recipe.  I've made meatballs for years and never thought of stuffing mix.  I processed the mix before blending it in.  Add meatballs and oil to a hot saute skillet  and shake them around until browned on all sides.  Place the partially cooked meatballs in a slow cooker, cover with sauce, and cook on low for about 3 hours.

I had extra boxes of stove top from Thanksgiving that I needed to get rid of so I was excited to find this recipe. Unfortunately I did not have the ingredients to make the sauce so I put the meatballs in a tomato based sauce and served them over rotini. I can't vouch for the sauce but the meatballs were way better than I expected them to be!  I do recommend running the stove top mix through a chopper/blender as several pieces were too big and noticeable. I'll make these again.

Best easy recipe. I use 1/2 ground beef and 1/2 ground pork. Delicious with spaghetti and meatballs (omit the Chile sauce and grape jelly of course)

I picked this recipe because I was looking for a meatball recipe with grape jelly (since a co-worker makes meatballs based on a recipe with grape jelly and just uses jalapeno jelly instead).  I'm not a spice person but hers are so good I will suffer for them.
I was making them for a party with a lot of attendees who don't really do pork so I made them with half ground beef, half ground turkey. 
I used part of the stuffing recommended in the recipe and part of an herbed stuffing as recommended in one of the other reviews.  The meatballs were independently tasty.
For the sauce I used half jalapeno jelly and half grape jelly - they had some kick but not so much.  I ran out at the party so I'd say they went over well.

I made the recipe exactly as written except that I also used some ground pork in with the beef.  This recipe made more meatballs which was great! This is a good basic meatball recipe that made a tender meatball -- and so easy! You definitely need a great sauce or gravy for interest. These meatballs would also be good in spaghetti if you need something quick. I had enough left over to make a two-serving meatloaf. It was also great. This recipe is a keeper!

Very good, tender meatball. I made it with 1 lb ground beef and 1 lb ground pork for a family dinner with sauces for dipping on the side and they were gobbled up. Definitely a keeper.

This is always a winner. I generally add a healthy scoop of minced garlic to the sauce as it's cooking. Everyone always wants more! I serve these with homemade fries and steamed broccoli to round it out as a meal - the sauce is great with the fries!

So easy! We got so many compliments on these and they save you at least half of what you pay for frozen meatballs. Plus, they taste way better. Depending on the stuffing mix brand, you may need to add a dash of salt to the mix, but the recipe is great as written.

Easy and great.  I use Stove Top Cornbread stuffing mix (1 jar Heinz HomeStyle beef gravy and 1/2c Sour cream for gravy). To make half use 1C dressing mix (can use Pepperidge Farm CornBread stuffing with Seasonings) then save second cup for another time. Make sure and mix the stuffing mix up well so the seasonings are spread into both batches if only making half.
