Made as written except that I left at the vegetarian beef crumbles. Mainly because I am not a vegetarian but also because I used this as a side dish instead of the main. GREAT flavor to what is normally boring beans! The only change I would make next time is to use pepperjack cheese instead to add more heat. Other than that, perfect as written.
