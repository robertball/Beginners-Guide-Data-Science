Oh my, this is good. I made it to 12 servings because that is what size the meat came in, and I used a cheese blend instead of just Parmesan, but kept everything else as is. I was a little skeptical when I could smell the cinnamon when the meat was simmering, but the taste was fabulous. This will definitely be added to my lasagna rotation (yes, I cook enough of the to have their own rotation, haha).

This recipe is very similar to one I got from an Italian friend that was handed down from her family. I much prefer this type of lasagna to the heavy cheese and sauce laded versions you usually find. I use a mixture of Parmigiano Reggiano and either Percorino or Asiago. I also like to use the no-boil lasagna noodles which makes it lighter and is more like using fresh pasta sheets.

My father was a top chef and this recipe was as good as anything he’s ever made. Time intensive, but worth every minute. I made it for a dinner party and everyone raved about it. Thanks for sharing!  I’ll definitely make again.

I reset it to 12 servings and did noodles then bolognese then noodles then milk sauce twice with Parmesan on top. It came out fabulous.
