Awesome Broccoli Casserole was totally awesome.  I only wished I had read some of the previous comments prior to cooking this dish because then it would have been even better.  I agree with others: the broccoli needs to be precooked first, cut down on the amount of onion (I say this even though I'm an onion lover), and put more of the cheese in the casserole instead of on top.  I also agree that this dish needs to be cooked a little longer - about 10 more minutes. Even though there was a little room for improvement, this dish was AWESOME!

This is a very good casserole, although I made several changes that improved the flavor.  I added lots more cheese.  I got a pound of American cheese and shredded it, adding it into the broccoli mixture rather than putting it on top.  I also used 1/2 cup of Italian breadcrumbs and 1/2 cup of crushed Ritz crackers mixed with 6 tbls of melted butter for a yummy topping.  Rather than 16 ounces of sour cream, I used 8 ounces to cut back on the fat a little.  Lastly, I added extra broccoli, which I cooked a bit before putting the mixture together.  It is DEFINITELY a keeper of a recipe! I can't believe there are reviewers who do not like this recipe! It's one of the best Broccoli casseroles I've ever had!!:-)  Thanks Cobra!

Thank you Cobra! I made this for guests tonight, one of whom doesn't have "broccoli" in his vocabulary and I was shocked to see him take seconds and say "this stuff is awesome" (why...that's part of its name!).  I didn't cook the broccoli as others have stated...the recipe states to drain and thaw the broccoli, which did the trick for me.  I also reduced the onion (alot) and added extra cheese...none on top.  I also cooked covered and then the last 10 minutes cooked uncovered, which prevented any burning! Great sidesish and would definately make again!

Ok, this was one of the MOST delicious things I have ever made! I made a few alterations, after reading some of the other posts and it came out awesome! Do not use all of the 16oz container of sour cream. I used 2/3 of the container and it was just perfect. Also, I did not use the whole large white onioin, I used about 3/4 of a large white oninon. I used Pepperidge Farm herb stuffing mix that comes in an 8oz bag (not box) but only used 6 oz. It was the crumbliest brand I could find and worked really well. I was in a hurry so I baked it at 400 for about 25 mins covered, so as not to burn the bread crumbs. Then uncovered it, I added the cheese on top and turned down the heat, baking for another 10 minutes. This was totally delicious, I brought it for a work Thanksgiving luncheon, and everyone loved it!!

This casserole is AWESOME! I made it for a potluck with a few changes. I used 2 16 oz bags of broccoli, 16 oz. low fat sour cream, 1/4 cup regular sour cream, 3 cups of cheese(I used a 4 cheese mexican blend because thats what I had on hand)The majority of this was mixed in with a small amount sprinkled on top. I had a large bag of Pepperidge farm stuffing that I used 8-9 oz of and threw in a little extra butter.I am not a huge fan of onion so I followed other reviewers advice and only used 1/2 an onion and chopped it real fine with my electrical chopper and it was the perfect amount. I also cooked the onion, corn and broccoli for 5 min.in the microwave before combining. I put it in a 9x13 pan, covered with aluminum foil and baked for 30 min. I then took off the foil and baked an additional 10-15 min. to make the top crispy. I bet this would be good as a meal with some chopped chicken or turkey mixed in.

I've made this dish six times now. Why so many? My sorority sisters now believe I know how to cook, and ask for it at every dinner party. ;-) Thank-you, Cobra!

Some advice:

I use about half the sour cream and less onion (diced very small). The last four times I made this, I precooked the veggies and had much better results. Definitely add more cheese to the mix if you're a cheese lover like me! I put very little cheese on top, as it tends to burn, and skimp on the stuffing topping as well. Also, consider cooking the dish 10-15 minutes more than listed.

This is a great recipe if you follow the other reviewer's advice:  halve the onion and sour cream, put all the cheese into the broccoli mixture, make sure the broccoli is fully defrosted, and bake covered for at least one hour until the whole casserole is bubbly, removing cover for last ten minutes.  Depending on what I have in my pantry, I improvise the topping.  I like half Ritz crackers and  half bread crumbs.  I also agree with other reviewer's recommendation to bake this a day ahead.  I give it four stars because of the tweaking required.

I think this could be a good recipe, but needs a lot of "tweaking".  The onions definitely need to be sauteed before adding to this dish - they overpowered it.  Also, for a recipe like this, I would like optional instructions for fresh broccoli instead of frozen.  And I also felt that the dressing/stuffing would've been better had it been mixed in the casserole instead of browned on top - it was dry. The recipe tells you to put cheese on top of the stuffing but so many reviews said not to - so I just did it on one side.  That side was still dry with rubbery cheese on top.

I have made this recepie several times, and have altered it a bit. Pre-cook the broccoli, and add the cheese to the rest of the ingredients. Cover the casserole, then remove it the last 5 minutes or so. This way it will not dry out on top. This is an excellent casserole!! This one is a keeper!!

Excellent!! We love this casserole. I've made it several time and the whole family loves this. I have made a few changes though....I use a package of frozen white corn instead of a can...and I also saute' fresh mushrooms and add them to the mix. It's the best. I will be making this as a part of my Thanksgiving menu this year for the whole family to try! Thanks Cobra!

I have been making this for quite awhile, but have never reviewed it.  Am quite surprised not everyone LOVES this.  It is a huge hit whenever I make it.  I have used frozen and canned corn, have used green beans instead of broccoli, as well as have used cream of mushroom soup when I don't have cream of broccoli.  In any combination this is a very quick, tasty casserole when you want something more than plain veggies.

This is a super easy and super wonderful recipe!  A few changes though:  used a 28 oz bag of broccoli, whole 8 oz box of cornbread stuffing mix by StoveTop, extra cheese, and about 14 oz of sour cream.  Also, I mixed EVERYTHING together so there was no actual crust but it was a totally wonderful and hearty dish!

Made this for Easter and I wasn't thrilled with it that day, thought it was ok, not quite flavorful enough for me.  Heated the leftovers the next day and what a difference!!  It tasted great and the guests I sent leftovers home with said the same thing.  Think the flavors needed time to meld.  My suggestion...make this one the day before (definitely cutting down on the onion) and reheat when ready to serve.

Great recipe. It could be served as a main dish, if you add chunks of ham to it.

This tastes fabulous!  I love the stove top stuffing topping and it makes great leftovers.  My five year old liked it and my husband couldn't get enough.

I completely agree with MitchB2's review.  
My husband I love Broccoli Casserole and were looking forward to tasting this version.  I thought the corn would be a great addition.  Well, like Mitch says this turned out to be a sour cream dish.  I also agree that there is way too much stuffing and in my opionion way too "herby", it may have been better to use Pepperidge Farm stuffing then the Stove Top.  I agree about not enough cheese inside the dish and way too much on top.  This dish did not thrill either my hubby or myself.

Made this for Christmas dinner and my family really liked it, so did I! I used frozen California Mix vegetables and frozen corn and did not precook, just defrosted thoroughly. I stirred in all of the cheese and the stuffing mix. Good idea. My first batch was a little sticky and dry, so I added a little milk to the second and it was great.

This was every bit as good as the previous reviews indicated. I used 1/2 the onion and only about 8 oz of light sour cream. I put more cheese into the actual casserole rather than on top. I think next time I am not going to add the additional cheese on top of the bread crumbs. I will be using about 1 cup of the cheese. but we are not huge melted cheese eaters. this is excellent and will be a regular side dish for me for dinners.

This was really good!  I did forget to add onion, but at the last minute added onion powder and it was still good.  I do think the onion would have made it better though.
The ONLY thing I changed (well besides forgetting the onion) was, I did do what others suggested and put all of the cheese IN the casserole and none on top.  And one little side note... If you couldn't actually see that the corn was in there you would never know it was.  It really added nothing to the dish whatsoever.  I'm wondering if Mexicorn would have been more flavorful?  One more thing I may change next time, although not a deal breaker... is I will get the frozen broccoli flourets insted of chopped cuts.  I like my borccoli a bit more tender.  My sister, however loved the firmness of the cuts... So it's really a personal preference thing!!
All that said.... This is definitely a keeper and will be making it again!!

Although I hate to be the one to say how a "recipe is great and here is how I modified it to make it so..." I loved this recipe because I think the sauce is what makes it so wonderful.  I used fresh broccoli and cauliflower florets slightly cooked, mixed with the noted sour cream, cheese, and soup.  I then mixed this with the croutons (only moistened with broth - it doesn't need butter - it so creamy otherwise!) I then put it all in a shallow baking pan and baked it as usual.  The veggies were perfectly cooked - I don't like them soggy which I think you would get with frozen.  Overall, it is the sauce that really makes this dish - it made things so cheesy and yummy!  Thanks!

Because of some bad reviews, I was hesitant to try this recipe. But it was awesome! I modified it according to what I already had in the pantry. I used cream of mushroom soup, and omitted the onions and corn.  I would make sure the broccoli you use is fully defrosted. I also added more cheese to the mixture and would reccomend not adding more to the top once its cooked b/c it does form a barrier and all comes off at once when you serve.  This was a very very good recipe and I was able to use all lowfat ingredients. Hey- if thats how I can get my husband to eat vegetables, then thats what I'll do. 5 stars!

Even with the changes recommended by other posters, my family didn't like this recipe.  The sour cream seemed to overwhelm the other flavors.  It also took quite a bit longer than 35 minutes to heat all the way through.

This recipe is OK.  It wasn't an award winner, but it had an interesting taste.  I don't think I will make it again, but it was good for a one-time thing.

I'm a huge fan of this recipe and always bring it to family gatherings because everyone loves it so much!  I also make a few adaptions to this recipe and cook the entire time in a crockpot/slow cooker.  I use 2 (16 oz) bags frozen broccoli, 1 bag frozen corn, and replace the onion for a can of cream of onion soup (cooking in the slowcooker can dry out the recipe so the extra soup is definitely not too much). I combine all ingredients, including extra cheese, and stir in slow cooker.  Cook for 4-5 hours on low, or 2-3 on high.  Always a crowd pleaser!

So was I supposed to add the dry stuffing to the top of the casserole or was I supposed to make the stuffing as it's box directed me to and then add that to the top of the casserole?!   I had a thick layer of hard crouton like stuff on the top of mine when it was finished cooking.  I'm not that bright, you need to spell everything out for me...it was still a tasty dish despite!

I thought that this was very good. I DID tweak it a little. I used fat free yogurt instead of sour cream, added some chicken, and a little ham. I omitted the corn, and added spinach instead. I sauteed the onion with some fresh mushrooms in garlic and olive oil. Made the topping with crushed Ritz crackers mixed with some onion & garlic powder then mixed in some chicken broth. I also used reduced fat soup and cheese. It was delicious! Thanks for the post, Cobra!!

This came out ok.  I've made it more than once and seasoned with salt and pepper for flavor...but still ended up with more than half for leftovers.  It's just ok on the blah side.

Good! I made a few substitutions for a healthier version. I used a chipolte corn soup and greek yogurt instead of sour cream and a whole wheat stuffing mix and shredded cheddar cheese.  I have also added cauliflower and kale.

I read the other reviews and made a couple changes myself.  I put ALL the cheese into the casserole, and left all the other ingredient amounts as they were.My suggestion is to not serve this dish piping hot, I (and my family) liked it much better when it had cooled a little, it made it "set up".  I put a thin layer of the stuffing coated in butter on top.

For anyone wondering about fresh broccoli, I used a little over 2 cups (it was 2 stems of broc. from the store with just the florets cut off, no stems) and it turned out fine.

This recipe is excellent!!! I changed the recipe a little bit to personalize it for my family but It was good the way it was. I steamed fresh broccoli instead of the frozen and I used quite a bit more than the recipe called for. I used all of the sour cream and it was great, a strong flavor but great! I did not use the corn and I only used half of the onion. I mixed about 6 ounces of Pepperidge Farm herb stuffing mix and 2 cups of sharp shredded cheese into the mixture. Before baking, I sprinkled the top with about 1 cup of the cheddar cheese and just enough stuffing (mixed with butter) to barely cover the top. This recipe came out so good, thank you so much for sharing it. I will make it over and over.

This could quite possibly be one of the WORST casseroles I've ever made.  I lost a recipe for a broccoli casserole I make every holiday, and checked this site for an alternative.  Made it for Christmas, and had to throw almost the entire thing out.  No one I fed it to found this to be "awesome".

My Dad has never like veggies and Broccoli is the one that the just flat out refuses to eat. But my sister made this dish a few years ago, and not only did he eat it, he had seconds!!!!!!! I make this for holidays even though someone always brings the classic green bean casserole, I just have to have this one! I agree to use less onion (even as an onion lover!) and to pre-cook the broccoli. I put all of the cheese inside and none on top. I also extended the bake time just a little bit, but I bake at a slightly lower temp, so as not to burn the stuffing mix on top. But this is a FANTASTIC recipe!!!!

This is a great starter recipe-you can add green beans, whatever.  I would half cook the vegies, put half the stuffing in the mix, and most of the cheese as well-I only used 1 cup of cheese total and it turned out great!

Excellent recipe once a few minor changes are made per the recommendations of previous reviewers. I omitted the corn, used half the amount of sour cream and cheese, and mixed the cheese in with the casserole rather than putting any on top. I also sauteed the onions with garlic prior to adding them to the mix. I also baked it for 30 min., then stirred it, and baked for another 15 min. to ensure the top was a little crunchy and it wasn't soggy anywhere throughout the casserole. I've made this a couple times, and with these modifications it always comes out well!

After reading most of the other reviews I tried this dish but followed the recommendations to use only half of the sour cream and mix more of the cheese with the broccoli and keep only 1 cup for the top.
This casserole turned out very good, and any precooking of the broccoli wasn't necessary (but my broccoli was already half thawed). The only critic is the presentation - the chopped broccoli just doesn't look very appealing in this casserole. I will try it with whole broccoli flowers next time - in this case I probably will precook the broccoli, though.

I liked this recipe but in the future I will probably add chicken to it to make it more of a main dish instead of a side dish.  Seemed like the main ingredient was lacking.  But it was tasty.

I have 9 kids, ages 2-16, and they ALL loved this.  I did 1/2 the amount of onion and used cream of mushroom soup. I put all the cheese in the mixture and non on top.  I also cooked the broccoli, onion, and corn(I used frozen) in the microwave so they wouldn't be crunchy then baked about 1 hour.

I modified this recipe just a little. I didn't have suffing on hand, and put parmeson on top and covered with foil so it would not burn to quickly. It was awesome. My husband demanded I make it again the next night.

I'm sorry, this recipe was awful.  We had guests over, and nobody at the table enjoyed this recipe.

There is way too much stuffing for the volume of the casserole, the tiny amount of cheese in the mixture adds nothing, and the large amount of cheese on top forms an impenetrable barrier as soon as it cools.

The dish tastes like nothing more than frozen broccoli with sour cream on top.

I made this for Christmas and it didn't get heated through in the time the recipe stated. Everything else was done and eaten by the time this was ready. For the few people who ate some,  they loved it. I covered the top with aluminum foil to prevent the stuffing and cheese from drying out. I uncovered it the last few minutes. I will definately make this again but I will allow more cooking time. It really is very good

Delicious!  I only used 1/2 an onion, about 3/4 of the sour cream and didn't use all the cheese in the recipe.  I served this a side dish for Christmas dinner.

So, I thought this was Delicious, but made several changes and my husband thinks it would be great with Sausage added to it.  He loves sausage.

I added green and red peppers and carrots. I made some other tweaks to it and we liked it.  All the veggies we used were fresh from the farmers market.

Only gave this four stars because I messed up.  I mixed most of the stuffing with casserole before I realized it should go on top.  I added a bit of liquid and put remaining stuffing where it belonged.  I think it turned out well considering.  Next time I'll follow directions and am sure I'll give it five stars!

Didn't have cream of broccoli soup, so used broccoli cheese soup instead and then omitted the shredded cheddar cheese. Also didn't put in a whole package of stuffing mix. Instead I added a cup of stuffing cubes. Cooked the frozen broccoli first. It was a very good vegetable casserole. I know I am rating it on the changes I made, but since I didn't fix it as written, I have to rate it on how good it was. I will keep the recipe for sure and maybe try it as written the next time

I have to say, while the taste is...Good... the whole thing makes me feel like I'm going to have a heart attack during the middle of the night... I added Hashed potatoes into the mix to just get something else in there. There HAS to be some way to cut down on all the sour cream! like half sour cream and something else. I'll be surprised if I'm still warm tomorrow morning... its good though, just please dont make this an everyday meal.

This was very good and very easy.  I did omit the cheese from the top at the end as I just didnt feel it needed it.  I used 2lbs frozen broccoli florets since many commented on cutting down on the sour cream.  It was perfectly moist with that amount of sour cream and soup.  I used a whole medium vidalia sweet onion.  I couldnt hardly taste the onion at all.  It was perfect.  I served this Christmas day and everyone wanted the recipe.  I used NO additional seasoning.

This was pretty good. I used 2 cans of cheddar cheese soup and cut the sour cream in half. Also used shredded cheddar instead of American cheese, and crushed ritz crackers because I didnt have any stuffing.

Our whole family loved this recipe! The only change I made was I used cream of mushroom soup as opposed to cream of broccoli soup because it was what I had on hand and omitted the onion since my picky child does not like it. I am thinking of adding some kind of meat to the leftovers for the creation of yet another meal.  Thanks for the post.

There are many slightly different versions of this that I have been making for years.  This one is really good but easy to make more healthy.  You can use fresh broccoli, you just need to cook it before.  I used hot water for the dressing instead of butter, yogurt cheese instead of sour cream, healthy soup and less sharp cheese.  Very good.

We like to have this dish as a vegetarian entree, and have added it to our "regular" rotation of meals.  I make it with fresh broccoli, lightly steamed, and I do cut the sour cream back a bit.  We have found that 1 to 1-1/2 cups gives it a great flavor, without being overpowering.  My husband would give this recipe a 5-star rating if he was writing this review, and he is always eager to "clean up" any leftovers.

I was intrigued by the combination of corn and broccoli, but this recipe just was too rich and too bland for us.  WAY too much sour cream -- that's all you could taste.  I'd agree with the earlier reviewers who suggested cutting the sour cream in half, using using more of the cheese in the sauce, and finding an alternative to the stuffing as a topping, as there was too much of it and it just sat there.  It also needed a LOT longer than cooking than is specified.

Very good, whole family enjoyed it.  use a little less sour cream.  To change it up use shredded hashbrowns on the top instead of stuffing mix.  Great recipe!

I liked the recipe but I used 98% FF soup and low fat sour cream and I think it took away from some of the favor that other reviews really like.  Next time I think I will add more shredded cheese to the vegetable casserole rather then put it on the top.

Absolutely the best pie I ever made.  I did not do the lattice top, just the basic pie crust.  And I did mix most of the sugar mixture with the apples themselves.  Kept some of the sugar mixture and poured it on the top of the crust.

Not a bad dish, but I would definitely follow the other posters' advice and pre-cook the broccoli.  I didn't care for it being crunchy.  Next time I will probably also mix more of the stuffing in the actual broccoli mix and put less of it on top.  It was just too crumby that way.  Oh, and definitely more cheese in the broccoli mixture.  But worth a second try for sure.

This was great! Next time I would either cook longer, precook the broccoli, or both. My broccoli was crunchy. Also, if you love cheese, add more to the casserole itself instead of melting on top.

Very easy and tasty! I omitted the corn for the particular crowd I was serving. I also substituted 1 cup of "4 cheese mixture" for 1/2 of the cheddar cheese; worked just as well. When shopping, I didn't realize that 1 (6oz) package of stuffing mix is just one pouch of the mix I usually buy.

This was a great side dish!  My relatives all voted it a "keeper!"  I used two 16 oz bags of broccoli cuts and only had an 11 oz can of Green Giants niblets (extra crisp) corn and as others suggested, mixed 2 C shredded cheese to the veggies.  I topped with 2 C crushed Ritz crackers mixed with 1-1/2 to 2 cups finely shredded cheddar cheese, and drizzled on a whold stick of melted butter.  Baked for an hour.  Very simple and delicious!

I am not a fan of frozen broccoli, so I used fresh broccoli steamed until tender crisp.  I substituted frozen sweet corn (from Costco - it really tastes like fresh corn) for the canned corn. I use cream of mushroom instead of cream of broccoli soup. We prefer cheddar to Velveeta.  I am now asked to bring this to every potluck.  There are never leftovers!  It's one of the best vegetable casseroles I've tried.

I would probably make this recipe again but I would omit the corn and I would saute the onions first.  I would also throw all the cheese in the mixture instead of putting it on top.

This is a great easy recipe. my husband and I loved it. Next time I make it, I am only going to use a small onion, instead of a large onion. I love onions, but it tasted "too oniony". Thanks!

This recipe is very simple to make and has such a good flavor to it. When I made it I didn't even like broccoli (or cauliflower) but I added cauliflower to it as well and now I love both! It might be a good way to get young ones to eat veggies with out them even realizing they are eating them!

I took this to a Thanksgiving dinner with over 20 people and to several pot lucks at my office.  They all loved it!  it's difficult to get kids to eat veggies anyway-but the kids who did like broccoli loved the casserole.  I did use half the called for onions in mine.

Thanks for the ideas Cobra.  This was a great recipe.  I modified it a little to fit my tastes.  Added red bell peppers, and carmelized the onion, as well as adding chopped mushrooms.  Mixed in a little ground turkey and you have a one pot meal.  Loved it.

The recipe was great.  I made a few changes, left out the onions and I added 2 chicken breasts diced small and made a main course.  It is a 'keeper' in our house.

Never tried this before,but my son and husband thought it was a hit!!!! I only used half the recommended amounts on the sour cream and the amount of onion. The only things I would change is add more cheddar cheese to the mixture and break the stuffing mix up more.

I really must say that my children usually don't eat stuffing. But, this dish is an absolute favorite in my house! Also, I volunteer for our funeral ministry at our church and this is what EVERYONE asks for when they call me.... Thank you so much for sharing this recipie with the world. God bless you!

I've made this recipe twice now and the 2nd time I made it my husband really loved it. I made some changes to it - used only 1 bag of broccoli, 1/2 of the suggested sour cream and only 1/2 of an onion (whole one is waaaay too much). I also diced and browned up some chicken and mixed it in.

This was great, but I will have to make one change. I did not like the stuffing topping with the cheese.  Next time I will make the stuffing according to the package directions and either put that on top or mix it in with the broccoli mixture.  This is deffinately a keeper!  Thanks for the receipe.

I made this for a large group of people and somewhat modified it to dietary needs/preferences. I used Cream of Celery instead of Mushroom and instead of putting stuffing on top, I put a ton of cheese and onion rings to bake on top. It was all the rave!!!!!

The added fat and calories from the butter, cheese, sour cream, and condensed soup (whew!) did nothing but mask broccoli's subtle flavor.  I also agree with a few other reviewers that the addition of the stuffing overpowered.  If you're looking for a broccoli recipe with all the "extras," I'd keep looking.

Very good recipe--I was trying to make a dish I had at my sister-in-laws and this was the closest recipe I could find.  I nuked 1 bag of frozen broc & 1 bag of frozen corn to make sure it was completely thawed.  I used cream of celery soup and instead of the stuffing mix, I mixed in crushed up Chicken-in-a-Biscut crackers (some on top too) Yummmy!!

This recipe was great.  I read the comments and adjusted accordingly.  I doubled the recipe for a large party and used one can cream of broccoli soup and one can cream of mushroom soup and only 1/2 the sour cream.  I mixed all of the cheese in with the broccoli/soup mixture prior to baking. It was excellent.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a wonderful recipe.  I altered the ingredients with Low-fat versions and it was just great.  Also added chuncks of chicken under the top stuffing and made it the main course. Went great with salad, will definatly make many more times.

I made this recipe for a family gathering and converted it to serve twelve. NONE of it came home with me! I liked it, but I was surprised by how much everyone else LOVED it. MY children asked for seconds, just like everyone else. All the women asked for the recipe. The only things I did differently: precooked the vegetables a bit, and put the majority of the cheese into the casserole itself, as opposed to on top of it as the recipe instructs. I also felt that the amount of sour cream would have made it a bit gloppy so I cut back on that. It was a big hit!

I don't like onions, so you think that I would have learned to leave the onions out. I didn't so I tried to pick them out later. My husband really liked the casserole! I bet I would have too, without the onions.

I made this and my husband devoured it!  He keeps inviting friends over for me to make it for them.  The last time I made it he ate it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  I was surprised that my 1 year old ate it!  Thanks, I'm sure this will remain a favorite in my family.

Super easy and very tasty. I added 1# of very lean ground beef and served this as a main entree. Will definately make this again, with a few changes. I would cut the onion in half and add green onions to make up the rest. I also, believe it would be better to mix in most of the cheese instead of on top. I'll work with this one. Thanks for the great idea!!! Susan B. Kingwood, TX

Delicious!!! This reminded me of a recipe MY grandmother made with mixed vegetables. My whole family loved it. It is definately a keeper. I made it along with another recipe here: "Fancy Sammich", a pork tenderloin. Very good combination, very good recipe.

i used fresh veggies, cauliflower and broccoli.  i decreased the onion and used 1.5c cheese in the dish and .5c cheese on top.  overall it had wonderful flavor... took it to potluck and brought home an empty dish.  will make again and again.

Tasty, easy, and gobbled up by the whole family. Next time I will cut back a little on the amount of onion, it was a bit overbearing.

I was surprised at how much I enjoyed eating this casserole (with a salad) for dinner.  
It was so easy to prepare and tasted delicious...very comforting food.
A few variations were made:  fresh broccoli cut up in small pieces and partially cooked in microwave,
low fat sour cream, no corn, after bread cubes are placed on top of broccoli mixture, press them down slightly.

This was an easy recipe to make but next time I would leave the cheese off since it ended up getting rubbery 1/2 way through the meal.  Also I thought it had to much of a stuffing taste for Thanksgiving but I would make it again some other time..........My Husband Loved it

I admit that this was my first casserole ever and I got nothing but great comments about it.  Our staff here at work brought side dishes for our Thanksgiving Luncheon and I was clueless as to what I should bring so I opted to surf the 'net for a recipe and I came across this one.  I was told by a few co-workers that this was the BEST broccoli casserole they had ever eaten and they asked me for "my recipe".  I admited to them that I found this on the 'net though.  Anyway, I just wanted to thank the person that submitted this recipe.  You saved my day and you pleased alot of nurses and doctors!

I made this recipe for just my husband and I and baked in a 9x13 dish. I used 1 box frozen broc, about 3/4 8oz. of sour cream, 1 can broccoli cheese soup, only 1/5 onion, 1 can corn, a little salt, pepper, & garlic salt and mixed mild cheddar into the mixture as well as a tiny bit of regular bread crumb mix. It turned out perfect-I thought it was gonig to be too watery-but after sitting a few minutes it thickened up. I will def be making this again!! We almost ate the entire dish it was so good.

After reading reviews (thanks!) this turned out awesome...Cooked onion in a little olive oil first, then added thawed broccoli & corn and cooked for another 5 or so minutes...turned heat off and added 3/4 amount of sour cream, 1.5 cups of sharp cheddar, no bread stuffing. Added garlic powder, pinch of salt and pepper to my taste. Baked with lid for 45 minutes, and baked without lid for another 15 minutes or until my other menu items were ready to plate. This was awesome! Everyone ate seconds including my 5 year old son :-) New Side dish in rotation. Plated with baked chicken and baked baby red potatoes.

i wound up having very few of the ingredients.  but this recipe makes it easy to substitute whatever you have.  i used a frozen california mix plus diced fresh zucchini, no corn, didn't have enough sour cream, so i added a little mayo & a dash or two of cooking wine; no stuffing mix or crackers, so i sprinkled bread crumbs on top the last 10 minutes of cooking.  it DID need cooking longer, but no biggie.  oh and i also added garlic powder & italian herb mix & mixed the cheese into the casserole.  YUM-O!!!

This recipe is as it says awesome, i didnt realise until too late that i forgot the corn as it was sitting on the counter when i was cleaning up and the casserole was in the oven and i used cream of mushroom soup by accident too, i was having an off day i guess, also added 1/2 cup cheeze whiz to the soup and sour cream turned out awesome! I made this with a pork roast and garlic carrots, the casserole was the only thing not leftover, will be making this for thanksgiving everybody loves extra stuffing!

This was a wonderful recipe.  I used about half the sour cream and added all the cheese to the broccoli mixture.  For the soup I used "Cream Soup Recipe" from this website.   I think this would be great for a potluck--maybe add chicken to keep meat eaters happy!

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving - it is very good.  I added about 1/3 cup of whipped cream cheese to the mix (goes well with broccoli) and would have preferred less onions. Would recommend half.  But - very tasty!  The corn was a nice change from rice.

I absolutely love this recipe!! just make sure you use chopped broccoli like the recipe says, or it will still be crunchy.  I had to use cream of celery soup and it was still just as delicious.

We had this alongside dinner last night, and it was super yummy! I did omit the corn because my husband is not a fan. Other than that, I made no changes. Thanx for this keeper!

I now make this every Thanksgiving as an alternative to green bean casserole.  I skip the topping, but otherwise follow the recipe as written.  It is a favorite!

Not a huge fan of this recipe...kind of bland.  If I decide to make it again, I'd probably switch out the cream of broccoli soup with something more flavorful, like cream of onion.  It seemed to be missing something, but it wasn't horrible.

add a layer of breadcrumbs in between two layers when baking, it makes it less runny and taste a whole lot better.

I needed a covered dish for a picnic were I hardly knew anyone.  I wanted to make a good impression so...   I found this recipe on Allrecipes. After reading the reviews,  I also reduced the sour cream and added extra stuffing on top.   I was a hit at the picnic. Men, Women and children loved it !!!!   Try it, you'll like it.

This is going to be one those annoying reviews that rates five stars and then changes the whole thing. I was actually looking for a base to use up leftovers before a vacation and so added the cream of broccoli and cheese but then put in leftover potato wedges and leftover chicken. Didn't have  broccoli or corn and so added frozen peas and shallots instead of onion. Did everything by sight. Had about a teaspoon of sour cream and chicken stuffing. Mixed it all together and threw it all into the oven  for about 15 minutes. Turned out much better than expected and my kids went back for seconds. Next time will try it the right way but in the meantime it turned out great!

This was pretty good. My husband says 5 stars it was awesome. I am giving it only 4 because you have to tweak it a bit. Definalty cook the broccoli first, and add most of the cheese to the mix and sprinkle a little on top. But overall it was very easy. I will definatly make again.

this broccoli casserole is pretty good but i wasn't awed by it. The only changes i made was to halve the amount of sour cream & stir the cheese into the broccoli mix before baking. thanks cobra!

Hint:I put two cups of cheese on the casserole and one on top.

Great recipe!  I changed it a little however.  I used broccoli cheese soup.  I also chopped the onions in my food processor so they wouldn't be overwhelming. Prior to mixing everything, I put the broccoli and onion in the microwave on high for a few minutes.  Overall a great tasting dish!

This was a very easy and very good casserole.  The only thing I only used half a large onion and it was almost to much.  I will make again, but reduce the amount of onion.

This turned out great.  I followed alot of what the other reviews had said (less sour cream, cook broccoli and corn first, and used Velveeta chesse) and this was YUMMY!!!  I have always had broccoli casserole that had the rice in it.  This was a great change!!

This was good...I didn't use corn since my girlfriend doesn't like baked corn, but it came out tasty anyway...I might try a little less sour cream next time...Maybe instead of 16oz, i would use 12oz...

I used 2/3 the bread crumbs and double the butter, and forgot the onions.  I think the recipe is good, but the frozen broccoli kind of tastes sour - the cauliflower is good.  Might go with frozen cauliflower and fresh broccoli (either sauteed or par-boiled) next time.  I will take WILSONSGURL's suggestion and add velvetta next time.

This was my first attempt at making any kind of broccoli casserole. I am making it for my family for Thanksgiving.I took the advice of not adding a whole lot of onion and I added velveeta cheese into the casserole. I just took it out of the oven and tasted it and it is so delicious. I love this recipe and I am taking the recipe and sharing it with my family. Thank you so much for sharing it.
