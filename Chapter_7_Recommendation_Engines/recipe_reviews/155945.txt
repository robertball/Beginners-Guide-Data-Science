Nothing is better than butter except when you add garlic and lemon! Not a fan of the cilantro so I subbed with parsley. So good and thank you!

This is easy to make and it's delicious.  Garlic lovers will like this. The only change  I made was to use parsley as I don't care for cilantro.  Pairs perfectly with lobster to enhance the flavor.

I added very little pepper, and did add a pinch of sea salt. I also replaced the cilantro with finely chopped parsley. Very nice and I will make again. Delicious with the shrimp we has also.

This is amazing.  I omitted the cilantro and it was still delicious!  I used meyer lemon so it had a sweeter flavor.  So simple to make.  I will make it and toss over some shrimp with pasta next time.

Delicious! Made 1/4 of the recipe for two lobster tails -- one 7-oz and one 14-oz -- and there was extra. Can't wait to try this on crab legs!

We donâ€™t like cilantro so we replaced it with fresh chopped parley.  I use this recipe for making shrimp with spaghetti too and we all love it ??

this is the best sauce ever.  I prepare this on christmas eve and since there's so many of us, I chunk lobster tails and raw shrimp, saute in water until done, put in a bowl and add this sauce on top right before serving.  the only change i make is no cilantro and about 2 tbs of capers.
