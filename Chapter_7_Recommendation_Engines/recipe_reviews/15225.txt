This was definitely a wonderful dish.  I made a few changes with great results:  I made 10 instead of 8, otherwise the spinach mixture would have been too much in each. I also added sauteed mushrooms (1/2 pkg) and 2 finely chopped chicken breasts.  I poured roasted red pepper pasta sauce on the bottom of the pan and a little over each one before ladling on the alfredo.  This way, it was a little lighter, the sauces complemented each other... and it all looked nice too.  Try it, you'll like it!

This was excellent!  I took some of the other reviewers' suggestions by adding chopped chicken that I had cooked with garlic and Italian seasoning and some mozzarella to the filling.  And I stuffed mine in manacotti shells.  I also added some shredded carrot to the filling for added color and nutrition.  It was very good.  Also great to prepare ahead of time and keep in the fridge or freezer until ready to bake.

I made this last weekend for supper for my husband and I.  Weboth thought it was great!  Not something that we would want each week, but it was SO GOOD for a change.  Would be great for company.  The only thing I learned was to use a paper towel to dry all the moisture off the noodles before trying to roll up as it makes it much easier.  I also added chopped chicken, but the next time I will boil my chicken breast and shred it very fine and it will be much easier to not only roll up, but to eat!

Absolutely wonderful! Made for a pot luck and got great reviews. Used a plain homemade alfredo sauce for the base, then topped with a store bought Sun-Dried tomato alfredo sauce. Make sure you dry out the noodles before rolling, and use a spatula to spread the cheese mixture.

I got this recipe years ago from a family friend. I just cook the frozen spinach according to package directions, then mix with the ricotta-parm mixture and spread on the noodles. I use a jar of spaghetti sauce as the base, put the noodle rolls down, then cover with more spaghetti sauce. I make a thick mornay sauce to pour over the top, simmering butter, flour, milk, eggs, and (parmesan) cheese until it reaches the desired consistency. this cheese sauce is really the star of the recipe. I would imagine this is still good with bottled Alfredo, but I really like it with the two sauces, and nothing compares to that rich, creamy sauce on top!

A great twist on traditional Lasagna. My husband who is very heartburn prone loved it because it contained no tomatoes.

This recipe looked just like it like it does in a restaurant. My guests were impressed.  However, it needed a little more flavor.  Next time I will add a lot of garlic and maybe some italian spices.

Tastes great and looks great too.  Don't forget to thaw the spinach first.

This was a fantastic recipe!! I followed the recipe pretty closely, but had to make a few changes: I used 2 jars Bertolli Alfredo sauce, next time I will add a 3rd, (personal preference), I added chopped broccoli and spinach, baked 4 chicken breasts in the oven then shredded and placed in vegetable mixture, added mozz. cheese into roll ups and on top, also added shredded parmesean cheese on top of dish also, outstanding!!! I got rave reviews from my family!! (I have a picky 2 year old, so I rolled chicken and both cheeses up, and put them into the dish with others, she ate the whole roll up!!!:)Thanks for a great recipe!!!

I was not wowed by these. I followed the directions to a T, except for adding fresh garlic and chopped sundried tomatoes to the spinach filling after reading some reviews about how it was bland, and still found the whole dish somehow salty AND bland at the same time. The filling was good after my changes, but the finished dish once I poured the sauce on was not what I was expecting for such a well-reviewed recipe. I used Newman's Own All Natural Alfredo Sauce, so perhaps it was the brand? Either way, the only way I'd make this again would be if I used marinara instead of alfredo. Thanks anyhow!

This recipe handled very well. I loved how the roll-ups looked in the pan. I cooked some red bell pepper to throw in the sauce and this gave it another flavor boost. However, it would be good just as written. Next time I too will add some chicken chunks browned in butter. Nice company dish.

This recipe all comes down to the sauce you use. Make sure it's very flavorful or else it will fall flat, like mine did.

I loved this recipe...with a few changes. I added diced chicken that was sauteed in olive oil and garlic. I used marinara sauce for the base and alfredo sauce for the top. My husband and I loved the mixture of the two and think just having alfredo would have been too rich. I also added mozzarella cheese and italian seasoning to the mixture before rolling up. Delicious!

Really good!  I had half a box of jumbo shells that I needed to use so I used those instead of lasagna noodles.  I didn't change a thing beyond that.

My family loved this! I did use a red sauce instead though and added 3 cloves of garlic and 2/3 lb of ground mild italian sausage. The only fault i found was that it wasn't hot enough, i would cook it longer than the 30 minutes.

Served with a salad, warm sourdough bread and a good red zinfandel. Perfect!

Outstanding! I used broccoli instead of spinach, and I added a couple cloves of garlic to the veggies before mixing in the cheeses.  Makes a nice dish for company.

Not bad, but not spectacular for me. I used quite a bit less spinach than called for, and I found it still to be a little much. I think adding other veggies (mushroom would be great) to the mix would improve it. To make life a little easier, I used fresh pasta sheets and cut them how I wanted them, instead of boiling noodles. I used Classico Roasted Garlic Alfredo sauce, which is pretty good for jarred sauce, but very garlicky, so others might not like it!

I loaded these up with all kinds of veggies--broccoli, red peppers, onion, mushrooms, and even some chopped carrots.  I also made the alfredo from a scratch.  Delicious.

I love this recipe however, I like to use fresh wilted spinach instead because I belive it taste much better. Just add it to the green onion when it is almost done and chop it prior to mixing with ricotta. I also like ot add a little marsala to the alfredo sauce. Excellent dish

I made these for supper club.  I baked a large boneless skinless chicken breast and added it to the spinach filling.  You really couldn't taste the chicken so it was probably not necessary.  Everyone loved these!

This is a pretty good & fast version of meatless, alfredo lasagna. This filling and hearty dish will serve as a basic start to ideas for adjustments to suit my family's preferences. It was worth trying just as the recipe directs to make decisions about changes for next time. I plan to try some of the chicken suggestions and possibly the use of both alfredo and some sort of red sauce.

Wonderful!  I sauted some chopped mushrooms and garlic with the onions, and followed another reviewer's suggestion to combine tomato pasta sauce with the alfredo for the bottom layer.  I was able to get 10-and-a-half delicious lasagna rolls!

These are delicious! The first time I made these was for a dinner party, and one guest said they were the best thing he'd ever eaten. I've found it's easier to make these in pasta shells than in lasagna noodles (and easier to eat them, too); I also saute chicken in garlic and olive oil, shred it, and add it to the cheese & spinach mixture before stuffing the shells. Otherwise I follow the recipe just as it is and it's wonderful!

Wow, everyone kept eating and eating with noises of approval between bites.  One taste tester asked for the recipe for her a birthday dinner the following week!  Leftovers reheated well in the oven.  I did freeze some so I'll let you know how they are from the freezer:)

These turned out very well- I made some changes-
 First-- 30 minutes at 375 is barely enough time to make the dish warm! I cooked it 45 Min and it still wasn't enough, I had 3 extra rolls in the dish which might have made a small difference but not that much. I will cook them a minimum of 50 minutes next time.
 I Used quality tomato based pasta sauce, it turned out great and was a little healthier.
 I added some Italian sausage to the mix and decreased the amount of Ricotta cheese by about a half cup.
 Next time I will add some fresh chopped mushrooms and chopped olives for even more flavor...
  It's a great dish that can be altered to your liking for sure..

AWESOME! I didn't bother cooking the onions and spinach, just mixed everything up in a bowl also adding in some cooked, crumbled sausage that I had to use up, which was a great addition. I also made my own alfredo using 'Jalapeno Rosemary Alfredo' from this site with yummy results! These are quite rich, but delicious! I would make these again! thanks for sharing. :)

Its good. I thought it was easy too. The only thing I did different was to add garlic salt to the spinach onion mix.

I made this last night for dinner and both me and my husband loved it. Absolutely delicious. I followed the recipe as is only adding 2 cloves of garlic into my spinach. Next time I will try adding some chicken as others have suggested. As for this version, light, good, nice meat free dish as also easy and quick.

This was such a great recipe.  Like some others I did alter it to my owm taste.  I added some mushrooms and some shredded chicken.  I even had some leftover so i put that away for the next day and made bread o the kids could dip it for an afternoon snack.  Next tie i will make more filling so I can save some for the day after.  I quick way to get your lasagna noodles in better shape is dont cook them put them in hot water with some salt and let them sit for awhile while you are preparing that way you dont get them to over cook and they are much easier to work with and you wont have the fear of mushy noodles.  Thanks Great!

These are the best!  I made them for a baby shower and people just loved them.  They're so easy and look so fancy that it looks as if they're hard to make.  I made the recipe exactly how it said to and wouldn't change a thing.

Since I didn't have any Alfredo Sauce in the house at the time and just wanted to try the roll ups I used a tomato sauce.  Came out very good.  Easy to make, easy to serve. The roll ups were a nice change to the basic lasagna.

This was so good I will make this again and again! I used a mix of cottage cheese and ricotta and I used brocolli instead of spinach and sauted it with garlic before adding to cheeses.

Beautiful presentation, as well as delicious.  This is the type of recipe you can be confident to serve to guests, but it's not so difficult that it can't become a family favorite.  These make perfect serving sizes.  I added chopped, grilled chicken to my roll-ups, and it was a meal in itself.  I also decided to add mozarella cheese inside.  They were beautiful to look at and tasted fantastic.  Kudos!

Delicious! My friends ate until they were too stuffed to move. I had to leave out the green onion as one friend hates them and I also followed the suggestions and shredded up a chicken breast (for 6 roll ups). I also chose to use spinach instead of the broccoli (which was an option in the directions but not listed in the ingredients). Otherwise I followed the directions as listed. I will definately be making this again.

When I made Lasagne last time, I knew I wanted to try this recipe, so I cooked the extra lasagne noodles and froze them to see if this part could be done ahead.  They froze/defrosted perfectly.  I made the recipe exactly as written.  I, too, would like to use my own sauce next time "just because".  However, this was just wonderful, super simple but looks very elegant and like you slaved over making them.  I'll add a little parsley in the top sauce for color next time.  Great keeper!  Thank you.

All I can say is WOW!!! I tweeked this recipe, AND FOR THE BETTER!  I wanted to incorporate chix into it so I made a basil pesto sauce and mixed it with shredded chix.  Then after I put the cheese mixture (egg, parm, & ricotta) on the noodles, I put a layer of the chix mixture on top.  Then rolled up.  I wanted to try it both with marinara and alfredo.  So I did a few roll-ups of each.  The Alfredo ones were AMAZING!!!!  I got compliments from the Hubby.  :-D

I took this dish to a work food day and man did I get compliments! It was a great ice breaker b/c this was a new job so people got to know me by asking who made the lasagna roll-ups. I've made it several times since then and always mix half sun dried tomato alfredo sauce in with regular marinara instead of straight alfredo sauce. Layer it for a gorgeous presentation (and the flavor is much richer if you use the marinara as well).

I wish I would have listened to others and added chicken.  I think that is the only thing missing that would make this a 5 star recipe.  I will absolutely make this again and again.  I loved the way it looked.  Made me feel like a gourmet chef.  Ha, Ha.

I liked the looks of this dish but if I ever make it again I will use a read sauce.
The Alfrado sauce was to reach for me.
I would also use less spinch.

WAY too much spinach!!! I made a delicious Alfredo sauce recipe from here that tasted just like the Olive Gardens alfredo sauce and I was looking forward to trying it with this recipe. All I could taste was the spinach! I would definitely cut that in half at the least!!! I may try this again and tweek that a bit. My 5 year old who I've been having a hard time getting to eat anything I make did, however, eat a whole piece! I was shocked!!!

I used fresh spinach (bad childhood memories of the frozen stuff) and added 3 cloves of garlic.  Couldn't find an organic Alfredo so I went with emril's roasted garlic Alfredo in a pinch.  After one bite my husband said I can definitely make it again.  I rarely hear that from him so it was a hit!  Cooked at 375 for about 40 mins - recipe didn't specify which really threw off an inexperienced cook like me.

Love this!!!  So much easier than regular lasagna, with a lovely presentation.  I think it might be charming with the rolls standing on end as well (would require a toothpick or two).  Prefer it with fresh spinach sauteed quickly with garlic.  Great as is or with a tomato sauce on the bottom, Alfredo on top.  This, my friends, is a keeper!

This is amazing!!  Really, really good.  I used other reviewers suggestions and added diced chicken, diced mushrooms and 12 oz of Prego in the bottom of the dish.  We could not taste the chicken and mushrooms.  My 16 yo son suggested italian sausage.  I will try that for the boys but leave mine as per the recipe.   BTW, I doubled the recipe.  The mixture was just enough for 4 oz per noodle.  I also used 2 C mozzarella.

This was a surprisingly good recipe!  I made it for a dinner party and everyone loved it - so different from regular lasagna.  Suggest doubling this - trust me you will want leftovers!

Yum! I had some leftover cooked lasagna noodles sitting in the fridge and this was the perfect recipe to use them up. As suggested by another reviewer, I used a combination of marinara and alfredo sauce (I used a mushroom alfredo). It was a delicious mix and probably cut out some calories. I forgot to buy spinach so I sauteed a combination of broccoli and kale. I love kale so this was a suitable substitution. I also forgot to buy mozzarella so I topped it with parmesan and it still turned out great. Oh and I used a sweet yellow onion instead of green. Thanks for the recipe!

I have been wanting to make these for the longest time and I finally did last night. WONDERFUL! Followed the recipe to the letter except for one thing: took another reviewer's advice and poured a small jar of marinara sauce in the bottom of the baking dish. It combines with the Alfredo sauce to make a slightly creamy tomato sauce. Wow! Thank you for such a great dish! We used 2 jars of Alfredo sauce on the top, regular and one with roasted garlic also.

This was a great base recipe.  I added chicken, like it seems most of the other reviewers did, and I also added some sun dried tomatos to it.  I seasoned the chicken with italian seasoning and garlic.  It turned out wonderful.  My boyfriend who always has suggestions on changes to make to meals couldn't say a thing other than to add mushrooms (which I don't like and that is why they weren't in there).  I would highly suggest this recipe, but add your own touches to it to make it that much better.

Tasty, at least with chopped broccoli!  There was definitely enough filling for 9 rolls, maybe 10.  I'll cook an extra couple of noodles next time.  I used a 15oz jar of alfredo sauce, which seemed like it wouldn't be enough, but turned out fine.

This recipe was very tasty.  A little time consuming, but still very good.  The only changes I had were to suite what I had on hand, so they were as follows: pureed cooked broccoli to replace the spinach, some dried chives and onion powder to replace green onions, fresh mozzarella, and added about 1/4c of grated asiago cheese to the mix, as well as some garlic powder, and fresh cracked pepper.  I used a dried packet of Alfredo sauce mix so that I could control the fat and make it using skim milk, which meant I also didn't have as much sauce as the recipe called for.  Therefore I only sprayed the bottom of the dish with olive oil cooking spray and poured the sauce on top only.  I'm sure this was just as good w/o my changes, I just always like to add my own touch to things. Everyone loved this one! :)

Yum! These were great. I boiled the spinach for 3 minutes, drained well, then added about 1/4 cup finely diced yellow onion and oil and cooked until tender. Then added about a clove of garlic and cooked a bit longer. Added a can of chunk chicken that I shredded to the spinach/cheese mixture. I used 12 lasagna noodles but I still had some filling left over, so I would suggest using 14 (I used whole wheat noodles). Also, I highly recommend drying the noodles on paper towels before filling. This worked really well. I used slightly more sauce just to use it up, but it definately didn't need that much. Tasted delicious!

Very good. I made a few changes...I used lowfat cottage cheese instead of ricotta because that was all I had on hand, used a shredded three cheese parmesan cheese, added some oregano, basil, nutmeg and parsley to the mix and also added some ground pork italian sausage. We did not have any alfredo on hand and my husband does not care for that sauce, so I used a marinara and it still turned out fantastic! My kids ate these all up! I would like to try it next time with the alfredo.

This went over fabulously at my dinner party of all boys. I used 10 lasagna noodles instead of 8 and I went to my favorite Italian restaurant and bought a pint of alfredo but that was not quite enough so it was a good thing I had canned alfredo on hand, witch by the was is disgusting. No matter how hard I look I cannot find a decent canned alfredo in the grocery store. I added 3 cloves of garlic to the spinach mix before adding the  ricotta and I used more ricotta than it called for the spinach to ricotta ratio was not suitable for the boys I added more to cut down on the spinach.

This is a good base recipe, but I think it would be pretty bland if not modified.  Here's what I did:  I doubled the recipe, used regular onion which I sauted, adding the salt to the onion while cooking.  Next I added the spinach, minced garlic, and finely diced mortadella ham—maybe 1.5 cups (3/4 cup for single recipe).  I mixed the cheeses and eggs in a large bowl, adding mozz. cheese, Italian seasoning, garlic powder, black pepper, then added spinach mixture.  Used 25 Manicotti, split into 3 dishes and froze 2.  3 jars of sauce were plenty, and the sauces were regular, garlic flavored, and one had mushrooms.  The mushrooms were a great texture.  I accidentally put the mozz. cheese over the sauce, but don’t think it mattered much.  After 35min, I removed the foil and broiled the top until slightly brown.  A classy restaurant here makes creamy spinach cannelloni with mortadella ham, which is where the idea came from.  YUM!

I used 1/2 pound of finely diced chicken & added 3 cloves of garlic to the cheese mixture. This was a good meal that everyone enjoyed, just not enough flavor to make it 5 star. I thought it was a fun & different meal, so I will try it again adding additional ingredients for more flavor. ALSO, I used one jar of Alfredo sauce (a smaller amount than listed in the recipe)and it was plenty.

I love this recipe. The only thing I add is shredded garlic butter chicken. And I do use a paper towel to dry all the moisture off the noodles so it’s easier to roll them up. My family loves it so much that this was their request for Christmas dinner.

This was wonderful!  I added a little more onion and mixed some cooked chicken in to the mixture before spooning on to the pasta.  Also, I used the multi grain pasta, which are much more narrow.  It didn't jelly roll well, so I just dropped a spoon full right in the center and wrapped both sides up.  This recipe is def. a keeper!  Will be a good dish for guests too...sure to impress!

I am giving this 5 stars bc my husband couldn't get enough of it.  I thought it was pretty good but i thought it was a little salty.  Next time I will leave out the salt and just use the parm cheese bc it is salty enough on its own.

I fixed a variation of this dish for Mother's Day. It was a huge hit. I used both broccoli and spinach and left out the onions. I added about 1/3 of a jar of Sundried Tomato Alfredo sauce to the vegetable mixture and a touch of mozzarella cheese to the top of the mixture before rolling. I made my own Alfredo sauce from dry packages since I don't like the jars of Alfredo. I added shredded Parmesan cheese on top along with the mozzarella. I made this dish the day before. I cooked it about 15 minutes, cooled, refrigerated overnight, and baked before serving. I grilled chicken breasts and sliced them thinly for the non-vegetarians to place on top of the lasagna. Everyone raved over the dish and had seconds! I will definitely fix this again.

Loved this, wil make again. My husband loved it also.This would make a great party dish since it can be made ahead. I added two chopped garlic cloves and the whole green onion chopped to ricotta mixture after reading some thoght it could use more flavor. That did the trick. YUM !

Made this and found it very plain.  When we reheated it, I added spaghetti sauce and more mozzerella cheese, which improved the tasted.  This is a good base recipe, but if I cook it again I will add meat (ground veal or chicken would be nice),mushrooms and use spaghetti sauce over the Alfredo (or instead of).

10 stars deserved here! I used 2 jars of sun-dried tomato alfredo sauce (found in spaghetti sauce aisle) to make my life easier. I highly recommend this sauce!  Also, I was sure to add some shredded mozzarella to the INSIDE of the roll-ups in addition to the ricotta/parm mix. I think this prevented the dryness that a few reviewers experienced.  I also added 2 cloves of fresh minced garlic to the cheese/egg mixture; a must in any italian dish!  I have had 3 seperate individuals tell me that this was the best thing they've ever tasted and no one mentioned that no meat was included. Don't hesitate to try this recipe.

I loved this recipe and so did my Husband! Next time, I will add fresh tomatoes on top for garnish and perhaps more 'gooey' cheese for the inside.(My first batch was a bit dry) Thank you!

We loved these.  Ate them three days in a row.  The only change I made was to add mushrooms and serve with red sauce overtop.  

I really preferred this to lasagna and we love lasagna. It was so easy to serve.

I used alfredo sauce flavored with sun dried tomatoes, which gave it some color! I've made this several times and always get raves! I added a bit of garlic powder last time I made it just to see, but it really didn't do much - the recipe is perfect as it is!

I made this recipe for my Bunco group.  Everyone wanted to know where on earth I had gotten the recipe.  It received nothing but wonderful remarks, and nothing was left in the pan at the end of the night.  It would be my preference to add pepperoni slices on top of the cheese mixture, as well as adding some of the mozzarella cheese inside too, just before rolling up each noodle, and using a red sauce instead of an alfredo sauce as a 2nd version of this recipe.  I mentioned this to my Bunco group, but they all thought it was perfect just the way it was prepared.  Anyhow, for an addition of a type of meat...that's what I would suggest.  Either way, it was a HUGE hit and most delicious.  Thanks for sharing this one!:)

Oh, yes.  Absolutely delicious, and will definitely be made again.  Followed the recipe exactly, and it made a very impressive presentation.  Served with a lightly dressed salad, it's a real keeper.

I have made this recipe several times, and didn't realize I hadn't rated it.  It is fantastic, and easy to do ahead and have ready for dinner, which leaves you time to visit with your guests!  The minimal modifications I have incorporated make this much more appealing to me, but the original recipe is still 5 stars.  I sauté some fresh mushrooms, some finely diced red pepper, and sprinkle it over the completed dish with some fresh chopped parsley, right before serving.  It really add some flavor, and makes this much prettier!  And, lightly browning the cheese on the top adds much flavor, too.

I make this about once every 3 months or so. I fill it with different veggies to switch it up. Chicken, spinach, onions, mushrooms, fresh basil, etc...It is always delicious. This last time I forgot to dry my noodles off and they were nearly impossible to roll. Sometimes I make my own Alfredo.

Didn't change a thing and everyone loved it.  I imagine the alfredo sauce you use might make a difference.  I split mine into two dishes.  One with alfredo mushroom and one with alfredo light.  It was enjoyed regardless.

Made this for Sunday dinner and it was wonderful. Did what others suggested: used some marinara sauce (lined bottom of pan), added some cooked chicken that I grilled with garlic and Italian seasoning, used fresh spinach that I wilted first instead of frozen. Really this was not hard to put together.

I changed this recipe a bit though, I used a marinara sauce and added some sausage - just crumbled into the sauce with onions and garlic...and used that rather than the Alfredo, It was a big hit!!

I made this for my vegetarian son and his wife.  It was good....but not great.  I added some sauteed mushrooms, garlic and ground pepper, but was still lacking something.  Personally, I think it would be great with italian sausage.  Easy to prepare and made a nice presentation.  Served with salad and ciabatta.

I tried this recipe earlier tonight for myself and my roommate - and we love it!  I will definitely make this again!    I used regular onions, mushrooms, minced garlic, and whole fat ricotta cheese, and I didn't measure Parmesan cheese, though I'm certain I used more than 1/4 of a cup.  The filling was just enough for 8 rolls, and in no way dry.  I didn't make my own Alfredo sauce; I bought two sixteen ounce jars of Ragu for that, mainly because I have a personal preference for extra sauce on just about anything that sauce goes with.  I also lowered the heat to 350º and baked for 40 minutes; my dinner came out perfect at that temperature.  Other than the onions and mushrooms, I wouldn't change a thing for this recipe!

Great recipe!  I didnt have green onion and do not think it was missed when I made this dish.  I also put mozzarella cheese in the mixture of ricotta and parm cheese.  Added italian seasoning and pepper.  Yummy!

Great way to get kids to eat spinach, but it was so dry!  I made my own noodles, added shredded chicken, did half of the pan with alfredo and the other half spaghetti sauce.  I didn't like the alfredo (I am sure it was the specific kind).  I will try to make again using a red sauce and increasing the moisture.

This is another AR favorite for me. I prepare this dish as written, but I add sautéed mushrooms to my mix and make my own alfredo sauce (I have something against store bought). Very delicious and worth the somewhat long prep time.

I did use others suggestion & added cooked chicken, garlic & mushrooms. With these added, I'd give it a 5, but without, it wouldn't have much flavor so gave a 3. I won't make as a roll up next time also because it took way to much time & effort. They kept losing the filling so won't even attempt again. Making like a "regular" lasanga in layers is how I'll make this next time.

I really liked this recipe, but I just can't get over how filling it was. I know this is more personal preference, but it sank to the bottom of my stomach. I will probably make this again because the combination was great, but I cannot handle the leftovers...

This was good and easy to make.  I added 2 chicken breast cooked and diced to the cheese mixture.  You will definately need extra sauce as these soak up what you do use.  I also got 9 rolls out of this with them being filled very generously.  I got a thumbs up from everyone so will be making again.

This recipe is restaurant worthy. I made it exactly as written except I realized my Alfredo jar was only 15 oz..So, I added an 8 oz. can of regular tomato sauce which gave me a blush sauce. I also used fresh mozzarella only because it is my preference. I use my boyfriend as my guinea pig and he has to rate my cooking using the 5 star rule. This one got 5+ and we both said if we had ordered this meal out, we would have been satisfied to have paid for it. Also, it says you need 8 lasagna noodles and for once, that's exactly how many you need. I cooked 2 extra in case I needed them or if any broke while cooking. This recipe is fun. You can change the sauce and just use a plain tomato, homemade or jar (my fav. jar is Newman's Own), regular Alredo which comes in so many flavors (I used mushroom) or you can add the tomato sauce and make a blush (pink) sauce. This one is absolutely a keeper!

So good! I found it much easier and faster to make it like a lasagna and I added extra mozzarella to the top for added flavor.

These were great.  I tried both spinach and broccoli.  It basically depends which vegetable you like better.  I thought the spinach tasted exactly like lasagna.  I followed a tip and used red sauce as well as the alfredo.  I also added mushrooms and scallops.  You can play around with the recipe.  It was very yummy.

Great recipe:)  My husband and I loved it!  I did make some changes based off of reviews.  When I made mix for the inside of the lasagna I made it with shrimp and shredded carrots, along with the other stuff.  I also put garlic in when I was cooking the spinach and also with the mixture.  I used the package mix of Alfredo that you can buy in the store.  I did use two packages of the package mix.  We like it with a lot of sauce.  I plan on sharing this recipe with everyone that I know:)  Thank you for posting it and sharing it will everyone:)

I have made this before with a few changes.  I cooked and shredded chicken to add to the filling.  Also chopped baby bella mushrooms and sauteed with the other veggies.  Used a gorgonzola cheese sauce I made using a basic white sauce with gorgonzola added. Served with salad and bread.  Yummy!

These were so filling and delicious.  I used 'Alfredo Sauce' recipe submitted by Rebecca Swift which I thought was the way to go since I am not a fan of jar sauce.  I boiled about 2 chicken breasts in seasoned water (adobe, little sauce) for about 20 minutes and shredded them.  I added pepper and garlic powder to the shredded chicken then sauteed it with the spinach.  With my saute, I also added abt 2 more garlic cloves, mushrooms, olive oill, and pepper.  I boiled 12 noodles and this mixture fit in all twelve.  Delicious dish, just definetly play around with and up the spices.  Thanks Marbalet!

These are aweome and are going into a regular rotation at my house.  I prepared them in the A.M. and cooked them for supper.  After I was done assembling them.  I put them in the pan with the alfredo sauce and covered with Saran Wrap.  When ready  to bake.  I took off the Saran Wrap and replaced it with tinfoil.  They turned out perfect!  I made these as directed but did not use jarred alfredo sauce.  I made the Quick and Easy Alfredo Sauce from AR.  My whole family loved these.  I plan to serve this with grilled chicken and  a Caesar Salad next time.  YUM!  Thanks for sharing.

I have made these twice now and they are well worth the effort.  The second time I made them I put a layer of spaghetti sauce on the bottom.  I thought it was tasty and a good compliment to the alfredo on top.

I liked these very much and they were way easier to make than a layered lasagna.  I used a homemade alfredo sauce from this site - I would reccomend doing that over using the gross jarred stuff.  The only thing I didn't like about this recipe was that I found it didn't reheat well the next day and I ended up throwing away the leftovers.

These are soooo good!!  I have made this recipe several times and plan on making it again and again!!  I use a red sauce on the bottom and alfredo on the top and add onion and garlic to the stuffing mixture.  Other than that, I follow the recipe as is.  Try it, you'll be happy you did!!

Sooooooo yummy!!! I really liked this but the rest of my family didn't. I thought it was almost addicting. I followed recipe exactly but added some minced garlic in with the spinach and green onion, next time I might use an onion. This was pretty quick to make I did do 10 noodles instead of only 8. My daughter stirred the cheeses and egg together while I rinsed the noodles in cold water and got them ready to put the filling in. I served with easy garlic chicken on the side but I think next time I will put chicken in it. I've always wanted to make this and am so glad i finally did!! Thanks so much.

This is such a pretty recipe and tastes great.  I used 7 noodles b/c that's all I had and it was plenty.  I put roasted red pepper sauce on bottom (recipe from this site) and quick and easy afredo sauce (recipe also from this site) on top. Next time I think I will cut back on the spinach and add other veggies to filling.

Made this recipe last night for dinner and it was well received.  I definitely seasoned the ricotta cheese/ spinach mixture with some garlic powder and salt, a bit of white pepper and a pinch of onion powder. I didn't have green onion, so I used onion flakes instead which worked just as well. Used a home made alfredo sauce that we love and it worked perfectly. I may incorporate some grilled chicken or shrimp the next time I make this as I'm sure it would add to the already outstanding flavor.

These were very good.  I added mozzarella cheese into the spinach and ricotta cheese mixture, I also added some extra herbs like basil and oregano for more flavor.  It came out wonderful. My BF doesn't like spinach but gobbled these up.  :)

These were a nice meatless change from our normal supper. I took the suggestion of others and put spaghetti sauce on the bottom, then the rolls, cheese and Alfredo sauce. I used an Alfredo recipe of this site that was delicious and made all the difference...can't stand store bought. My kids didn't really like this, but all the adults did. Thanks for the keeper!

Simply fantastic!  I did replace the alfredo sauce with a homemade red meat sauce, but otherwise followed the recipe.  It was delicious & the presentation is very nice.  Will have to try it sometime with a homemade alfredo sauce, I'm certain it will be delish!

These lasagna roll-ups were hearty and so healthful! I made these with ready-made Alfredo sauce, but I will be making my own sauce next time. I had to add some salt to the finished product to really bring out the flavor, but the spinach/ricotta center of the lasagna & the sauce really made a delicious meal. My husband is so happy that I made this dish!

These were very good!  I substituted cottage cheese for the ricotta cheese and sauted mushrooms with the spinach and added some minced garlic in there too.  I used a combination of alfredo and tomato sauces and put a little mozzarella cheese in the lasagna roll ups.  Yum!

Family and guest favorite. I made some changes though since no one in my family eats spinach but me. I added mushrooms and shreded chicken. I also use 2 cups of cheese. My family loves cheese. This is made at least weekly in my household. My hubby loves it.

Fabulous!  I usually hate making lasagna, but this was a breeze.  The second time around I used a vodka sauce and added sweet italian sausage.  It made 10 roll ups this way and it was equally as tasty!

I added some chopped cooked chicken breast (about 3 large pieces) to my filling and also used one 16 oz bottle of alfredo on the bottom and another 16 oz bottle for the top... so creamy... I also was able to spread this out into 10 rolls since I added the chicken... will difinitely make again!

My family loves this recipe.  I love alfredo sauce & this recipe definitely helps me conquer my craving for it.  Its comfort food, but I love the healthy dose of spinach!  At least there's a vegetable in there!

I can't quite put my finger on it, but I didn't care for this too much. I would give it 3 stars. However, my husband and daughter loved it, so I went middle-of-the-road and gave it 4 stars. They've already asked me to make it again, but I'm in no great rush. Sorry!

Great recipe.  I bought precooked lasagna sheets which was fantastic - less steps and easier to work with.  I will need to make the filling 1/2 as much more so the roll ups are really stuffed.  Also if you keep it covere there is less chance of it drying out.

This was an easy and delicious twist on lasagna.  I made this awhile back and enjoyed it.  I made it again last night and made some changes.  I made my own alfredo sauce and added prosciutto to the filling and added both mozzarella and fresh grated parmesan near the end. Thanks for a great recipe.

This was a very simple recipe with a great flavor! I cut the lasagna noodle in half to make the roll ups smaller to serve with some sliced breaded chicken breast over the top. I added more Alfredo sauce on the top of all of it and it really came out tasty.

I got this recipe a couple of years ago and it is IDENTICAL to this one.  Been making it every so often.  These are delicious.  I've used all the white Ragu sauce variations.  Very good no matter which you use.  Hint: Do all the rolling on a cookie sheet to minimize the mess.

These are good but I do add shredded chicken and sometimes add spaghetti sauce (with the alfredo) to make it even richer and change it up.

Delicious recipe! I followed other people's suggestions and added some boiled, shredded chicken breasts (2), sprinkled some mozzarella cheese inside, and used the sun dried tomato alfredo sauce. It came out perfect! Thanks for the recipe!

This was good but not especially flavorful.  I probably won't make it again.  The spinach mixture needed more spice.  I make a similar recipe that has leftover beef roast in it and that makes it more substantial.

This was really good.  We used broccoli and added chicken and it was great.  I think we didn't use enough alfredo sauce and will make sure that we do next time.  Would recommend at least giving it a shot!

These were awesome!  I am still trying to find the best jarred alfredo sauce though... but I could eat these every day.  One rollup is a perfect serving size.

I made these for a baby shower and they were a BIG hit! I pretty much followed the recipe, and it was easy to scale it to 32 servings (but it was a lot of work!) I would make this again in a second.

This was very good! I only used enough Alfredo sauce to cover the bottom of the pan b/c I read the reviews first. I suggest preparing the pan first so that when you roll the lasagna you can place it in the pan without taking up so much counter space, glad I thought to do that. This recipe may be bland to some, but I can appreciate spinach and alfredo sauce so me and my family loved it!

This recipe was a great starting point for me.  Rather than boil lasagna noodles, I purchased fresh pasta.  The package contained 8 sheets of pasta for lasagna.  Cut each one in half length wise and just soak for a minute to make it more flexible.  I added ground turkey, sauteed mushrooms and used red sauce.  It was not bad, but I will keep tinkering with the filling a bit until I get the right flavour.  Rolled lasagana is a Great idea!  Looks like a lot of work, but it's so easy!  Thanks Holly

We loved this!  I made a couple of changes based on reviews-I didn't put the egg in the filling and added a small handful of mozzarella instead.  I also used fresh sauces from the refrigerated section-a small tub of alfredo and a large roasted garlic tomato.  I spread half the alfredo on the bottom, the other half on top and spooned the tomato over the top.  YUM!  It looked very pretty and held together very well.  I will make this again!

Rather than lasagna, I used the mixture in stuffed shells. I took the advice of another user and used Sun-Dried Tomato Alfredo Sauce. Very good! Next time I will thin it out some though - too thick. I also used fresh spinach rather than frozen and added some mozz. cheese to the mixture. I omitted the green onion and added parsley. Overall so, so good!

Oh my Goodness Easy!!  Oh my Goodness Delicious!!  A must try and a I will most definatly be making this again.
2/22/2004 - I made it again.  Just as wonderful as last time, I added a little garlic powder to the riccotta cheese, next time I think I am going to try this with broccoli instead!
5/6/2004 - I added peas and spinach to the riccotta mix.  Quite delicious!!

Excellent combination of ingredients.  
My husband raved about dinner all night!
I added 3/4 of a pound of ground beef 
and fresh garlic to the mixture only
because my husband loves meat. I recommend 
this recipe to all creamy sauce,
cheese lovers...

I didnt use broccoli or spinach,  I used chicken and onions,  and mushrooms, I used a whole pint of ricotta which was too much for my batch. I also added alfredo sauce and so it was a little runny, but I mixed shredded cheese with the mix and rolled them in half rolls (to double up rolls), much easier. They look good, they just came out of the oven.

I made this three or four times now.  This recipe is outstanding!!  Will make it again and again!  The last time I made this I added one shredded  boneless skinless chicken breast (left over from a previous recipe) to the spinach mixture.  I'm not sure if it was better but it was excellent just like before!!  This one is a keeper!!

This was my first use of jarred Alfredo sauce and it was blander than I expected.  there are better comfort food recipes, ie mac n cheese, chicken parm .  Also home made Alfredo is pretty easy and much tastier.

Great recipe; everybody loved it. (spinach version)
2nd time around sauteed garlic with 1 cup chopped baby bella mushrooms. Half Alfredo Sauce and half mushroom cream sauce. This was even better!
Thanks for the recipe! One of my new 'Go To' recipes.

This was very tasty. It is  was easy, but messy, to make, and worth the effort. It is rich. One and a half rolls is a generous serving. I toned down the sauce with a little low fat cream cheese and added some basil, thyme, and parsley plus a tsp of lime zest from my garden.Keys people tend to put a little lime in almost every dish.

I used chopped up fresh broccoli and asparagus and just a little fresh spinach.  I also made my own Alfredo sauce.  Just took a few extra minutes. This was so delicious!! The only thing I would do differently is double the recipe!!

Made this last. Hubby and daughter both had two helpings and for lunch today. Made a couple of changes after reading the reviews. Used Marinara sauce under the Alfredo. Added about 1/4 cup sour cream. Bit of garlic powder, fennel seed and Italian spice. Didn’t have green onions, so substituted with yellow onion. Also used 10 noodles and it was just enough for the sauce. I use Allrecipes a lot but have never left reviews. That’s how good this turned out :)

These were good and pretty easy to make.  I made them a little ahead of time so that was convenient.  A little bit 'heavy' to be something I will do very often, but once in awhile its great.

This is actually an old family recipe my mom made for years.  When she made it, she used leftover shredded pot roast made in a crock pot and added it to the spinach.  My husband, who doesn't like white sauce, loves this recipe.  My mom would make it every time we visited.

This dish is really yummy! I made it for my Sister and husband while visiting them. I added mushrooms, and some red chili flakes. The rest of the recipe I followed as written.

I made this.  I added finely chopped chicken,minced dried onions &minced garlic.  Also,used more cottage cheese & less risotto cheese.  I liked this recipe. Found it was better in taste the next day.  Will make again but will let it set one day before eating.  I think a creamed tomato sauce would be good on this.

It is good as is, just a bit bland.  I used fresh sauteed spinach with onion and fresh garlic.  This made all the difference.

This may have been good with homemade Alfredo sauce, I haven't used prepared sauce from a jar before so that may be why I didn't like it so much.

Delicious! I received many compliments on this dish. I made it with a few changes suggested by other reviewers - 1.Let the lasagna noodles soak in hot water while you're preparing the filling 2. add Italian seasoning to the filling 3. Use less spinach (I used 1/2 pack).

This was a disaster!! The first time I made this I used homemade alfredo sauce that curdled.  Ugh! But I made it the other night again using bottled alfredo and hubby couldn't eat it.  He took one taste and threw the rest in the trash.  So I gave it two stars because although he found it inedible, I was able to eat enough to fill me up. Not the greatest recipe though because aside from the alfredo sauce, the stuffed noodle combo is mostly tasteless.  Won't be repeating.

This dish was terrific. I used the spinach and 10 lasagna noodles . With just the two of us , we polished the entire dish off in 2 days. Took the advice and made rhe Alfredo recipe of Dawn Carter as am not a big advocate of jarred sauce . My darling absolutely loved this and it is a keeper. Thank you and a Happy New Year !

This was super yummy! I used the Four Cheese Alfredo sauce from Aldi, and it was really good. It was only 15 oz, and it was the perfect amount. I sauteed five cloves of garlic with some red pepper flakes and added it to the spinach. I didn't have any green onions, so I just added some onion powder to the ricotta cheese. Great recipe!

Just wanted to add that these roll ups freeze beautifully.  I do not add the sauce to what I am freezing but rather just freeze the rolls then defrost, add the sauce and bake.

This recipe was great. I made a few changes. I added shredded white meat chicken, garlic, and mozzarella cheese to the inside of each noodle roll. Other then that followed the recipe exactly. Yummy. My entire family loved it.

I was very surprised at how well this turned out! I followed the recipe as written. So simply and delicious! The whole family loved it! I will definitely be making again! I'm sure it would be good if you added chicken or hamburger but you do not need to at all! I used kroger brand alfredo sauce.

I loved it.  I made it for a pool party and substituted the lasagna noodles for shells because I needed smaller portions.  A lot of the people complimented the dish and at the end of the night, nothing was left.

Giving this 5 stars but I did stray from the author's version and used one of the tips from other reviewers to make it even better! I used red sauce on the bottom and an alfredo sauce on top...everyone loved it! But that being said the filling is delicious as written and has a lot of flexibility with what vegetables I can add next time I make this. One thing I have to add..the majority of my family does not like spicy or highly seasoned dishes...this one fit their palates perfectly.

I followed the directions to the letter. Maybe it was the cheapo store brand alfredo sauce, but this seemed to be lacking something - a little bite or spice perhaps. I would definitely try this again, but it my two young kids rated it "thumbs-sideways" (as opposed to up or down).

Very good - we used the "Quick & Easy Alfredo Sauce" recipe from this site - added onion & garlic w/ the spinach & subbed cottage cheese for the ricotta. Still very rich & messy!

I love when a recipe comes together the first time! A nice easy ingrediant list and easy directions made for a great Meatless Monday dinner. My husband even finished his plate! The only thing we added was some garlic that I sauteed with the spinach. One note, though, when dealing with frozen spinach, make sure to rinse and drain completely, otherwise you get a funky taste.

This was delicious!  It was an easy restaurant quality dish.  The stuffing exactly fit in 8 lasagna noodles.  Usually these kinds of recipes produce excess stuffing.  Next time I would double the spinach mixture and use the full box of noodles.  A 9 X 13 pan could of easily fit 16.  I used PC blue menu alfredo sauce and low fat ricotta and mozzarella cheese, so calorie wise this one isn't too bad.  I'll DEFINITELY make this one again.

Excellent!  I added artichokes.  It made it even better.  I also tried it with whole wheat lasagna....I won't do that again.  :-)

I used lasagna sheets-instead of noodles and they were super quick to roll! I sliced them in half after baking them as directed. These were delicious and pretty easy! I did 8oz spinach and 2 ounces chopped broccoli. My husband still suggested using less spinach and that we add ground sausage meat next time. Might give it a try!

This was very good!  I had some Buitoni alfredo sauce in the fridge that I wanted to use up and found this recipe thinking it'd be perfect to try with it...and it was!  I halved the recipe and made 5 rolls out of it.  2 rolls are plenty per person, as they are really filling, especially with side dishes too.  I omitted the onion, so I just put a little oil in the pan, heated the spinach through, sprinkled with some onion powder, and then continued on with the recipe as written, including using only 1/2 an egg.  Very good!

Very good, but not so great re-heated.  Re-heating tends to dry things out and the roll-ups do not stay moist and saucy.  To the spinach, green onion mix I added a couple cloves of garlic and Italian seasonings.  I did not drain the spinach, just cooked it in the saute to have the water evaporate.  I laid 10 lasagna noodles on kitchen towels and then blotted tops with additional towels to absorb all liquid.  I added mozzarella cheese to spread instead of topping with it.  I spread mix on noodles and rolled up to make a total of 10 roll-ups.  I made homemade Quick and Easy Alfredo Sauce (AR) that I used on the bottom of the dish and also to cover the roll-ups.  Each roll-up I then dolloped with a bottled vodka tomato sauce.  Refrigerated until 30 minutes prior to cooking.  Covered with aluminum foil and baked at 375 for about 40 minutes.  Presentation w / restaurant quality!  I wish I'd have taken a photo!  Family thought dish was excellent, but my 18 month old wouldn't touch it!

Very good. I boiled chicken breasts to add some meat to the spinach mixture. I agree with another reviewer that there is a tad too much spinach in 8 rolls. I might try this with cream cheese instead of ricotta next time, just to see!

This was great. I used vodka sauce instead of Alfredo-I know I changed the recipe and people don't like reviewers who change things. But I am rating the recipe regardless because the filling was delish!

I really enjoyed this recipe and so did my family. I added sliced bacon and chicken breast cooked with some of the bacon grease to add a richer flavor. Also chopped mushrooms. It really did look pretty on the plate and I will definately be making this again!

I made this for the first time this evening, it was a hit, even with the kids.  I can't imagine making lasagna with spinach any other way now.  Definately will be passing on this recipe to my loved ones.  This recipe has found it's way into my beloved, favorite cookbook.  THANKS!  Now I must end this review as my presence is requested in the kitchen to serve seconds to my 6 year old.  Thanks again!

I substitued regular pasta sauce for the alfredo and added mushrooms, but otherwise, followed the recipe.  I served it at a pitch in, and almost everyone found the spinach to be too overwhelming.  If I do make it again, I'll cut the spinach in half and add even more mushrooms.

Excellent dish!!!!  I made it my own by adding cooked chicken, and substituting broccoli for the spinach.  Easier prep was to put the chicken and broccoli in my food processor, pulse a few times, and then add the cheese mixture.  Put this in the freezer, (pre baking step), then muy husband took it with him to deer camp, and just heated it through!!!  Will make many times!!!!

This was a very nice dinner - I halved the recipe and used frozen spinach (thawed and squeezed the liquid out), and followed the recipe exactly. I did use a packaged Garlic Alfredo mix and don't think it was that great, I think a good alfredo mix would REALLY make this fantastic and next time will be more picky about what I use - but I would definitely make this again. They are easy and fast to prep and look just beautiful on the plate! I baked for 30 minutes covered and then gave it another 5 with the foil off to brown the cheese up a little. The only other small change I made was regular onion instead of green since that's what I had.

I added one chopped boneless skinless breast of chicken and four chopped large mushrooms into the sauce mixture, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Also, I used the "Alfredo Sauce" recipe from this site (doubled) which was perfect. Family loved it.

Very tasty, my boyfriend and I really liked it! I did change a little... I used no egg (I'm not sure why it's in the recipe at all) and I added a lot of garlic and used a garlic and herb red sauce instead of alfredo. This was my first time making anything with spinach and I was really happy at how well it turned out!

I made a few changes b/c it seemed a little boring. I used manicotti instead of the lasagna noobdles. I added a little minced garlic to the spinich and green onion and added a little more of the onion to balance out the spinichy taste. I added chopped up boiled chicken. I also put some of the cheese inside the mix. I topped it with some green onion. It was delish.

I used 15 lasagna noodles, and added a large can of chicken to the mixture.  My 15 noodles were filled nicely so I would imagine eight noodles would be hugely full.  I followed other reviewers and added a jar of marinara to the bottom and poured alfredo over the top.  Yum, and really easy to make! I also added minced garlic to the spinach mixture and omitted the green onions because I didn't have any on hand.

Use fresh spinach if you can (saute in a little oil or butter until dry/squeeze out water). This recipe makes a lot of food. It was pretty good but seemed to be missing something.  Maybe some roasted red pepper alfredo sauce?

I have made this 3 times now in the past 2 months...it's a definite keeper.  My entire family absolutely loves this recipe...and rolls make the perfect serving size for lasagna and they serve up so neatly.  Would highly recommend this recipe to anyone who likes alfredo or lasagna.

This is probably the fanciest thing I have ever made!  So simple and impressive.  It is the same stuff you get at Italian resturants.  Very good!  I will make this a lot, and make it to impress people =).

Great recipe, however I did add about 2 tsp of chopped garlic with the spinach and green onions. I think this recipe would be great for stuffed shells. I also think that this would taste great if you use a red sauce instead of the alfredo.

This was really good. The only thing I changed was adding plenty of garlic that I sauteed when I cooked the spinach. I didn't have any problems with mess with rolling them up like some other reviewers mentioned. Next time I think I am going to try them with a tomato based sauce.

These are great and easy to make, they will become a staple in my meal planning.  I used half broccoli, half spinach and added sauteed mushrooms to the filling.  I used store bought alfredo which next time I'll use homemade off this site to make the taste even better.

Good. Used spaghetti sauce for bottom layer, whole wheat pasta, and homemade parmasean cheese sauce instead of the mozzarella and alfredo sauce on top. Fun, new way to eat lasagna.

I cheated a bit and used large shells instead of the lasagna because of the "messy" comments made by others.  I also added mushrooms.  Very tasty!

They were okay...but not worth making again if you don't add more to them.  They're on the bland side.  I suggest adding some sausage next time. I do love the individual servings!!

Not bad. I got mixed reviews from the family. My parents loved it but my husband and daughter did not. I used broccoli instead of spinach which wasn't bad but I think it might be better with spinach. Extremely easy to make. I put everything together yesterday so all I had to do when I got home from work was throw it in the oven. I would definately make this again but maybe try a marinara sauce.

Followed the recipe exactly and thought this was very good.  I used a roasted garlic alfredo sauce (from a jar) and it gave it a little extra flavor.  Will definately make again.

I have to imagine these are very bland as the recipe is written.  I purchased a rotissiere chicken and sliced it up and added a layer to the rolls.  I also added a layer of mozzarella cheese as other reviewers suggested.  I added additional mozzarella to the top and I used the "Quick and Easy Alfredo Sauce" recipe from this site instead of a jarred sauce.  I did not like them, but family loved them.  Mayber it's just me.  Also, the dish itself is anemic looking as it has no color.  Definitely needs a color garnish of some type if it is to be served to guests in my opinion.

The trick for me was tasting the mixture before rolling into the pasta. It was a little bland, so I added chopped chicken cooked in garlic & Italian seasoning, 1 tablespoon of red pepper flakes, salt & pepper, garlic powder, and oregano to spice things up. I used whole wheat lasagna noodles and put alfredo sauce on the bottom and roasted red pepper sauce on the top. It tasted absolutely amazing and my husband went back for seconds and couldn't stop talking about how great this recipe is! I served it with garlic bread and steamed broccoli.

As other users suggested I also used both the red tomato and white alfredo sauce mixture, which is really mixes well with one another. I also added mushrooms, red and greed peppers, garlic and some italian seasoning. It was a really good dish, will make again.

These were really good!  I could only eat one b/c they were so filling, but I"m looking forward to having another for lunch tomorrow.  I used garlic instead of green onions, and I put about a cup of marinara sauce on the bottom of the pan and topped with homemade alfredo (used the crab alfredo recipe off this website and omitted the crab).  I bet this would also be good with mushrooms or meat added, but was delish!

This is fabulous! I used a regular onion, marinara sauce instead of alredo, and I added fresh mushrooms with the onion and spinach...my daughter said I must make lasagna this way every time. It's a great no meat meal that I will make over and over!

Great starting point - I made w/ wh.wheat pasta & added into mixture exta cheese, sauteed (finely chopped) zucchini, fresh garlic, spinach (two handfuls),grilled chicken and mushrooms - very good! Sauce type is individual, but I mix an all recipe alfredo sauce w/ jarred red sauce. Thanks! By the way - freezes well if there are leftovers but you can also freeze individually before putting sauce on.

I made this for my boyfriend as a surprise while he was at work, and he LOVED it! It was much easier to serve than regular lasagna, and we both adore alfredo sauce so it was a big hit! I'll definitely try making this for my family next time, but I'll probably try it with tomato sauce since neither of my siblings like alfredo sauce. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was very good, but SOOOO rich that even with a salad I didn't feel healthy after eating one roll. It needed meat as others suggested, and I think I would have preferred a marinara sauce.

Wow...these turned out really great!  I listened to a few other reviewers and made some minor changes.  Ommited Spinach (hubby eats NOTHING green).Cut up some chicken breasts really small....added in a bit of onion and seasoned with various basic seasonings...sauteed in olive oil.  I mixed my chicken in with the cheese mixture right before I spread it on the noodles.  When my noodles were cooked, I layed them out on a cookie sheet, on paper towels so they would dry.  It was awesome....

This recipe was soooo good, and very popular with my company. The only thing that I did different was make a rose sauce.

My family loved this recipe.  I changed the recipe a bit by adding chicken and using part creamy alfredo and part five cheese alfredo.  The taste is wonderful and I love that it was so easy and the rolls are easier to serve than regular lasagna.  Great recipe, we will definitely be adding this to our rotation.

A really versatile recipe,  you really could make any type of filling for the lasagna rolls.  I had hot Italian sausage, spinach, ricotta and mozzarella.  Very easy to  make on a weekday night for dinner. Thanks!

Added shredded chicken and mushrooms, used white onion.  Put red sauce on the bottom, made it like a lasagna and poured alfredo on top, added cheese.
  Good, but needed jazzing up.  Black pepper perhaps? More red sauce?

This was a great change from regular lasagna.  I did make a huge change though from the recipe and I used spaghetti sauce instead of alfredo.  The store didn't have any reduced fat alfredo when I went grocery shopping so I decided to be even healthier and just use regular tomato sauce.  It was so good and I definitely recommend making it this way if you prefer tomato sauce.

This was very delicious. Every one loves cheese in my family, so this was perfect! I am going to try it with marinara sauce next time instead of Alfredo sauce.

This recipe was great, but I'm not a fan of jar alfredo sauce.  Instead try a simple alfredo sauce from this site and it will taste much better!

My whole family enjoyed this; it makes a nice presentation as well. The only downside is commercially prepared Alfredo sauce tends to be a bit salty. I used the refrigerated kind- I think it is better than the ones in shelf-stable jars  (but more expensive). I definately will make this again.

This recipe was great, but I had to make some alterations.  In a skillet, I browned Italian sausage mixed with the onions and a tablespoon of garlic.  I then added this to the spinach/ricotta mixture.  Without the meat, the dish was way to creamy/heavy. I also cut the Alfredo sauce in half (I used 10 oz only and did not pour any over the roll-ups).  Otherwise, this recipe was terrific and not very difficult at all.  Update: I made my own alfredo using the "Quick and Easy Alfredo Sauce" recipe from this site!! so good and easy!

Very good.  I added a few things which is why it didn't get 5 stars.  I finely chopped 1 chic. breast and threw it in with the spinach, onion, and olive oil.  I also added some minced garlic, oregano, and red pepper flakes.  I mixed the ricotta, parm., and egg in seperate bowl.  Once it was well mixed, I put it in with the spinach, chic. mixture.  I used 1 jar of regular alfredo and 1 jar of roasted red pepper alfredo.  The ones with roasted red pepper alfredo were excellent.  Overall, a great recipe.

Really good!  I added some garlic to the spinach & green onions sauteing in the pan, and that is the only change I made this time.  Next time I make it, I will only use half of the called for alfredo sauce.  It really calls for too much.  Just one jar will do nicely.  I will add some shredded chicken as well!

Pretty good recipe and not as difficult as I thought it'd be.  I cooked the frozen spinach in the microwave and added a can of mushrooms & 1/2 lb. cooked ground beef that I had.  I used a 9x13 pan and made 8 large rolls.  The filling was not quite salty enough for me.  Otherwise it was good!

I made a couple of changes, and it was absolutely delicious!  I used marinara sauce for the bottom (16 oz. jar), and added ground turkey (1 lb.) and sauteed garlic to the ricotta mixture.  With the addition of the ground turkey, I made 10 lasagna roll-ups and used a 9 x 13 baking dish.

A great recipe but needed to change it to suit our tastes.  1) I halved the recipe since I didn't buy enough alfredo sauce - used one 15oz Bertoli.  2) I boiled and shredded two chicken breasts and added to cheese filling.  3) I eliminated the spinach and onion since I didn't have any.  4) Kept the ricotta and parm cheeses the same amount for the full recipe.  5) I also added 1 cup mozzarella to the filling.  6) Ended up using 10 lasagna noodles (don't know why I halved it in the first place!) and kept the filling thin inside each rollup. 7) Used 2/3 of the sauce on bottom and 1/3 spread on top of the rolls, I really wish there was about 1/3 cup more sauce to go on top though.  8) Topped with another 1/2 cup of mozzarella cheese.  Was not too dry or too heavy but not enough sauce to dip bread in but at least the plates were cleaned!

I've made this recipe a few times now and the first few times I followed the recipe pretty closely except I used a marinara sauce instead of an alfredo (not a huge fan of alfredo sauce from a jar).  I think the original recipe is quite delicious as long as you are careful about the amount of spinach placed in each rollup.  It's definitely easier than regular lasagna.  I recently modified the recipe to only include ground beef, sour cream instead of the ricotta cheese, and mozzarella cheese with marinara sauce.  I personally like the texture and flavor of the sour cream over the ricotta.  I think this is a very modifiable recipe so that each person can incorporate the ingredients they want as long as you don't try to stuff too much into the rollups.

LOVE THIS!!  It was so easy and the presentation is great for family dinner or a dinner party.  So much easier than traditional lasagna.  I didn't add the mozzarella on top and it still turned out great!

I made this for 15 ladies at a shower yesterday. It brought rave reviews! It was so eay to prepare, and not that expensive because it is meatless. It was so neat and pretty on the serving tray. I wish I had taken a picture! Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe.

Delicious! I had left over turkey from the night before, I shredded it and used it with broccoli. I also added some shredded Mozzerella to the inside mixture and then topped the rolls with sliced mozzerella and sprinkled with shredded parm cheese. These were so easy to make and tasted absolutley wonderful.

I thought this recipe was really, really yummy.  I could only find a 16oz jar of alfredo sauce, so I added 5oz of regular pasta sauce to equal the 21oz.  I want to try this recipe with chicken and broccoli next time.  Thanks for sharing!

I did not really care for this recipe.  My husband actually hated it unfortunately.  It seemed like a great flavor combination, but just did not taste right. However, thanks for the idea.

These were pretty good. I think that they were a little bland on the inside with the spinach and cheese. I think if I make them again I would add some italian sausage to it. The only reason I dont give it 5 stars is because the spinach didnt sit well with me the next day if you know what i mean. Other than that, it was alright. Good recipe.

My whole family loved this dinner! Even my very picky stepdad. He will never try anything new but he said he really liked the looks of this one so he tried it. Now he wants me to make it again. 

I added mushrooms, tomatoes, and garlic salt as well as roasted garlic alfredo sauce. It is a little time consuming to put together but it is well worth every minuet. Thanks so much for this recipe!

This recipe was pretty bland, it needs something else to give it more flavor.  Also I would use less alfredo sauce, much of it was wasted in the bottom of the pan.

This is a nice twist on lasagna. My family really liked them. Halfway through preparation I realized the jar of alfredo sauce was only 16 ounces, so they were a little dry. With the extra sauce they will be really good. Thanks for sharing.

It wasn't bad, but it was very bland. I ended up coating mine with cajun spice. Probably will not make again.

Wow, this was great! The presentation wasn't too appealing but it tasted wonderful - so rich and creamy. I forgot about the egg, used regular onions instead of green, and also a bottled Alfredo sauce that was flavored with garlic. It needed a little freshly ground pepper too. Thanks so much, Holly! (and Mr di Lello!)

These turned out good although the alfredo sauce was alittle overpowering - next time I'll use less. The filling was similar to a manicotti recipe I use sometimes but still good ~ the green onions were a nice addition for taste.

This recipe is delicious!!  I have made it several times and each time it has been a hit.  Sometimes I add cooked, shredded chicken and crumbled bacon to the cheese mixture (My husband is somewhat of a carnivore).  It is great either way.  I also cut down on the spinach sometimes if serving it to non-spinach lovers.  Even people who don't like spinach have raved about this with with the alterations.

Absolutely fabulous, and easy to make, too.  I doctored it up by putting a layer of prosciuto on each lasagne noodle before spreading the spinach mixture.  Also I added chunky blue cheese dressing to the ready-made alfredo sauce, and sprinkled a little nutmeg over the top of the dish.  Highly recommended !!  Five stars !!

We added chicken to this and thought it was ok. Too much of a spinach flavor for us (we don't really like spinach, we just know it's good for us so we try to eat it) and the insides of the rollups just seemed dry. I think next time I'll add some mozzerella to the inside to add some stringy cheesiness. But, making the roll-ups was VERY easy... the noodles get "tacky" after drying a little, and I found that when I rolled them up, they wanted to stick, so I just moved them right to the pan.

Not my family's taste I guess. Thought it would have been better in a red sauce rather than white. Added garlic and there still wasn't that much flavor. I did like how it looked though.

Great recipe and easy to make! Made it with meat sauce and it tasted great. Maybe next time I would add a little more sauce, but that's just because I like it saucy!

We really liked this dish, I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because after reading the reviews I did not follow the recipe exactly.  I substituted 1 clove of garlic for the onions because we don't like onions.  I also added 1 small jar of sliced mushrooms that I sauteed with the spinach and 1/2 cup of chopped cooked chicken (you could probably add an entire cup).  I also added 1/2 cup of mozzarella to the mixture & used 12 lasagna noodles and there was plenty for all of them.  I am not sure how much Alfredo sauce I used because I used a mix & a jar because that was all I had on hand.  I would like to find a good Alfredo recipe to use with this.  I am eager to make it again & use broccoli.  Overall I used some of the suggestions listed in the reviews and a few of my own - I think my version is a 5!  It is simple to prepare, tastes delicious & looks great - perfect for when you have guests.

these were yummy.  i made a few changes though.  i didn't fry the onions and spinach but added them to the cheese mixture uncooked.  i also added mushrooms and used 12 noodles instead of 8.  i had more than enough of the cheese mixture so i froze the remaining for the next time i make this.  it turned out great.  even my very pickey 6 year old ate it!  thanks for sharing...

I love this recipe!!  It is SO easy using a prepared alfredo sauce.  I added chopped cooked chicken breast to the spinach-ricotta mixture and everyone loved it.

I made this for my husband to take on a hunting trip.  He is not a big traditional lasagna fan, but I thought maybe he would like this.  Turns out he didn't, but the other guys loved it!  I used diced chicken instead of the spinach, just to add some protein.  I'll make it again (for myself when the husband is away hunting)!

This recipe is fabulous! The only change I made was to saute garlic also and my friends loved it. Thank you so much.

This recipe was great for the first few bites, definately not a second helping meal.  It was "blah" - if I try it again I will certainly have to add to it and possibly use a marinara sauce instead of the alfredo.  It looked delicious and smelled great.

My family loved this recipe!  I didn't change any ingredients, however I read with interest some other reviewers who added mushrooms, chicken, nutmeg among other things.  We may try some additions in the future for variety, but thought it was great as is!  Thanks Holly!

This was sooooo good. I did make it with brocolli instead of spinach and used cubed chicken in the mixture as well.  This is so rich and flavourful, my whole family loved it.

A bit too much sauce.  I added mushrooms & doubled the cheese.  It was so-so.

This is a keeper! I did add mushrooms and garlic when I was sauteing the spinach. I also used 10 noodles, and I increased the sauce. My family gobbled this up!

The taste of this was very good - we gave the taste a 5. The only changes I made was to add fresh sauted mushrooms to the filling, increase the noodles from 8 to 10 and used a 15 oz jar of alfredo sauce instead of 21 oz (it was all I could find at the store). But the presentation got a 1 - the whole family thought it looked terrible.  IF I make this again, I would try it with a red sauce.

Needs more seasoning!  Way too blah, I will try it again with more seasoning, more sauce, and more cheese.  Maybe after some changes I would give it a higher rating.

This is a terrific recipe!  My husband absolutely loved it and it looks lovely when served.  This would be a great dish for a luncheon and especially when having guests for a dinner party.  I love it!!!!  We're having leftovers tomorrow.  P.S.  I also used the sauce from the recipe -To Die for Fettucine Alfredo also on this recipe site instead of purchased sauce.

I can't wait to make this one for work and church. I was most impressed with how little effort and time it took to create. And it taste great too. Even my 13 yr. old loved it!
