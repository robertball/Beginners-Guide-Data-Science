this recipe was pretty good i made alot of adjustments to it, instead of water i used chicken broth and cream of mushroom soup, mixed in italian seasonings and garlic also. used heavy pepper, and made sure to slice the potatoes into smaller pieces  so it got done in 75 minutes. I also mixed some tapatio hot sauce to the casserole water/soup mixture and. I Also cooked Sweet cornbread to serve with it, and also added cheese in the last 5 minutes... enjoy everyone

Well I like it!  It took exactly 75 minutes to cook.  I did add spices since everyone who had already reviewed said it need more punch.  I just added italian seasoning to the wet mixture and then the last 5 minutes it was in the over I switched to broil and put some cheese on the top in irder to make it more kid friendly.  Anyway everyone loved it!

I thought this was very easy to make and tasted delicious.  I think I might have put too much water in it though because it was a little runny.  But overall very tasty.  Thanks.

Very good. I had to cook mine another 20 minutes or so to get the potatoes cooked through. I suggest that folks just make sure to cut the potato into 1/2" chunks to bake it in the suggested time.

This was exactly the type of recipe I was looking for, put minced garlic, parsley and onion on top of the chicken but that was the only thing I changed as the previous reviewers said it lacked something.  Unfortunately it still lacked a lot although my elderly mother LOVED it so am upgrading it, won't make it again unless my mother wants it, maybe good food for the elderly as it was soft and nonspicey.

after taking other reviewers' advice, this turned out quite tasty. as mention by another, i too used chicken stock and cream of mushroom, fresh herbs (basil was what i had) heavy pepper and hot sauce. a spinkle of cheese when done dosent hurt any! and i also tried the sweet cornbread and it was indeed a great compliment to this dish. oh, and cutting the potato's into small dice is a must for them to cook through in time.

I had no cream of chicken soup on hand, so I used cream of mushroom instead.  I also added some Italian seasoning to the chicken for more flavour.  Like the previous reviewer, I found that this had to be cooked much longer than indicated - it took more than 90 minutes for the potatoes to soften enough to be eaten.  The end result was pretty tasty, but I don't think I'll be making this one again unless I happen to have some leftover chicken and nothing else to do with it.

This was delicious! I made it for my sister and myself and we both loved it! The only changes I made to this recipe were adding 1 teaspoon of rosemary and 1/2 teaspoon each of oregano, parsley, and basil. I also put two cans of cream of chicken soup and only 1/4 cup of water. I cut up the chicken into cubes and cooked it with olive oil spray, pepper, parsley, and lemon juice. It took about 75 minutes to bake and I stirred it several times and took off the foil for the last 30 minutes. The only thing I would do differently next time is add some green beans and maybe eliminate the chicken because it doesn't even need it! The vegetables by themselves are delicious and filling!

This is great, easy.  I've taken it to pot lucks, and served it to fanilies when on vacation from California to Tennessee.  It was a hit every time.

Okay, I've found the missing ingredients!  This recipe is a nice base, but it needs some doctoring. I am a vegetarian, so I used quorn naked cutlets in place of chicken breast. I added a vegetable bouillon cube to the water, added some fresh thyme and sage (since it's pretty much like chicken pot pie insides), onions and garlic, and  about a half cup of greek yogurt (a healthy substitute for sour cream). Then I topped it off with cubed bread drizzled with butter and olive oil for the last 20 minutes to create a crouton topping. I'm pleased with the results!

Very bland. I added chopped onion and used chicken broth instead of water as suggested above. Very soupy. My husband then added bread crumbs and cheese to thicken. Still bland. Will not make this again.

This was not good at all. It needed to be cooked much longer than the recipe called for and overall it was very very bland. I definitely won't be making it again.

I used left over rotisserie chicken.  Boiled the diced potatoes and added diced carrots - before they got too soft, I added half a bag of frozen peas.  I sauteed half an onion and mixed with chicken and cream of CELERY in a casserole pan.  I mixed in the veggies when they were soft and topped with mozzarella cheese.  I baked in over for 10 min and then broiled so cheese was browned.  It was a big hit for all and a little faster since i boiled the veggies.

Like other reviewers, I altered this recipe. I used a can of cream of mushroom, a can of cream of chicken, and 1/3 c of water. I also added a fresh herb kit created for poultry. The rosemary was a great addition. I did a layer of a parmesan/mozzarella mix on top. It came out really well. I would definitely make this again, especially on a cold, rainy day!

Very good.  Would suggest using raw chicken.  I adjusted the veggies to our taste, less celery, more carrots, and added mushrooms.  I used whole baby red potatoes instead of slicing them.  Will make this again.

This one was just OK.  I really did not like the taste of the celery with it.  I don't know... it gave it a weird vibe.  I did add onion for some extra taste, but I agree with the others that it is pretty bland.  In the future, I would probably replace the celery with green beans.

This is quick and easy!  I use a food processor to slice my carrots, potatoes and onion.  Also insted of only using cream of chicken soup I also add cream of cheddar soup and some garlic.  The kids love it!

delicious! the sweet potatoes give it a very unusual and surprising flavor. I added cheese (like cheezwhiz or velveeta) and skipped the carrots...spice it up, change it up to suit your tastes. great leftover!

This was terrific! Made it for my family and everyone loved it.  Instead of water I used milk.  I cutup chicken breast to bite size pieces and cooked on top of stove with 2 tbls butter then I cut the potatoes in small bite size pieces used pre cut carrots slices and it was ready in exactly 75 minutes.  I will make this again.

I added 1/4 tsp of chicken seasoning and a dash of nutmeg to compliment the main ingredients to give it more flavor.
