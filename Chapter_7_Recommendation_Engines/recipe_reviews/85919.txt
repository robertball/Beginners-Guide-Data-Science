This chicken had terrific flavor. I added a little fresh grated ginger (maybe 1/4 tsp?), blk pepper and about 1 tsp garlic powder (didn't have fresh). I don't measure seasonings very well, just sorta eyeball it. I marinaded this for about four hours, using boneless, skinless breasts. I put this in a glass dish with about 1/2 the marinade sauce and baked at 400 deg F for about 30 min (int temp 180 deg). This came out SUPER tender and juicy. I will definitely make this again, and probably try it with pork chops or tenderloin. The ginger really added a nice flavor. Thanks for the suggestions!

This marinade is amazing! I've made a few times with both chicken and pork tenderloin. Two hours just isn't enough time to marinate the meat for, overnight is best but from breakfast will do. I've even served this to guests with rave reviews. Thanks for the great recipe.

Very tasty, though changed it. I used 1/2 cup un-diluted frozen orange juice concentrate, and 1 can of beef stock. I then added my mined garlic, and a little crushed ginger. I marinated chicken in it all day, and then baked it in the oven, in the marinade. Served it over rice. Great and so easy! :)

This is a great basic recipe, however I thinnk you need to jazz it up a little.  I added chopped ginger and a few tablesppons of honey to make it more glazey, otherwise its a little runny.  I think I would also marinade overnight (I only did 5 hours and could not taste the flavor all the way through.)  I also would grate some orange peel in next time.  Would be great on wings/drumsticks.  We just grilled on bbq.

This was a really delicious marinade.  I made a few changes by adding some ground ginger (1/2 tsp) as well as a couple tablespoons of vegetable oil.  I marinated the chicken overnight and then broiled it for 20 minutes, flipping it at 10 minutes and brushing some of the marinade on it. I dumped the remaining marinade into a pot and boiled it for a little while until it reduced and then spooned a little over the chicken. I served the chicken with brown rice and garnished with some chopped green onions.  Very good! I'll definitely be adding this to the rotation.

I am seldom moved to review a recipe, but this one was not good at all. The soy sauce completely overwhelmed all taste of orange. My family wouldn't finish it, and they aren't terribly picky.

Awesome flavor.  I did marinate overnight, and added honey as suggested in another review.  Also tried with pork chops and turned out very tasty! Thanks for the recipe!

A good marinade.  Very easy to make, my family liked it although I thought it was a little mild.  Next time maybe I'll kick it up a little.

Super easy and good.  The chicken was very tender and flavorful.  I used a whole chicken, plus some extra breasts - all skinless, and it worked out fine.  There isn't a clear orange flavor.  It just tasted similar to a teriyaki marinade.

I took Stay Home Cook's advice and added some grated fresh ginger.  I also substituted the soy sauce for bragg sauce to keep the sodium level down.  Sereved with brown wild rice and fresh steamed brococli, it was amazing.

Easy to make but the chicken really did not pick up much flavor.  Maybe if I would have marinated it overnight.

Added some orange peel for more pronounced orange flavor, but will try the undiluted orange juice concentrate next time. Added black pepper and grated ginger (needed more!). My oven decided to stop working on the day I did this but my broiler still worked so I broiled these...so juicy! I might never use the actual oven when making this in the future!

Very good! I used breast tenderloins instead of whole breasts( i read the package wrong!) and added honey and a splash of lemon juice too. I grilled the tenderloins on our counter top foreman grill, and they were sooo moist and tender!

This was absolutely fantastic!!!!  I used one large orange & juiced it along with a little zest.   Cut large pieces of boneless skinless breast & then marinated for Kabobs, my husband raved about it & begged me to "keep' that recipe!

I have made this recipe exactly like the instructions but I only had time to marinate the chicken for 3 hours.
While cooking, the sauce dried up too much so I had to add a 1/2 of water when reheating. The taste is unusual and delicious. And this recipe fits the Paleo diet! A win situation!

I’ve been making this for years and is one of my favorite quick chicken recipes to make with fried rice. The only thing I add is red pepper flakes to give it a little kick.

Spice it up with powdered mustard, hot red peppers, or ginger and it goes well with Chinese dishes. Delicious. When I see a one star rating along with mostly 4 and 5 star ratings, I suspect the cook made a measuring error.

This was a very nice and easy recipe. I marinated breasts and thighs for about 6 hours and then put in the oven. I added ginger and honey as others suggested. Will most likely make again.
