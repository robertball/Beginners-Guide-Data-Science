These were nothing like the ones I used to get at the bakery. These were VERY heavy,dry and tasteless. Fortunately this is my only negative review. Sorry this just wasn't for me....might tweek this a little and try again.

I grew up in sweden, and my mom used to make cookies like these, but she would add almond extract.

This were terribly bland - maybe some almond or vanilla flavoring would have helped. I tried dipping them in some coffee, tea, chocolate and nothing gave them flavor.  They had a good consistency.
