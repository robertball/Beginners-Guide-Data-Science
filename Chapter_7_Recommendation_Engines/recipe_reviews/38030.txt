Good, I leave out the caraway seeds, no one in my family will touch them. I also used bacon grease instead of butter and left the bacon pieces in. I also don't boil the cabbage, I just let it cook in the vinegar/sugar mixture until crisp tender.

I took this to a Legion pot luck dinner.  A German couple who attended gave this a 5 star rating.  I thought it had just the right blend of all of the ingredients.

I cooked it in  slow cooker until desired doneness of cabbage. I also used spiced apple cider and some water. Adjust sugar and vinegar to taste. I served it with a pot roast and my family thought it was the best ever and wanted the recipe.

Very good and easy; I threw all the ingredients in a crockpot and cooked for 4 hours with a couple of changes:  I used Apple Cider Vinegar and left out the caraway seeds.  Next time I would replace the water with at least 1/2 apple juice and increase the vinegar as I like my red cabbage tangy.

Quick, easy and tasty. Goes great with a roast and mashed potatoes. I used green cabbage instead of red and it was just fine.

Very simple and tasty. I omitted the caraway seeds because we don't care for them, and I used cidar vinegar.  I'll make it again for sure!

Great recipe! I used apple cider vinegar and a little less brown sugar(personal preference). I threw everything  in the slow cooker and cooked on low 3 hours. I really enjoyed the caraway in this. I served this as a side for Herb Dumpling Pork Chops also from this site.

The instructions were a little unclear on what to do with the extra water. Although I used a medium-large head of cabbage, I had approximately 1/3-1/2 cup of liquid before adding the sugar and vinegar so my sweet and sour cabbage was a little juicy (still good to eat though)

 Also, if you like this recipe a little more tart, skip the butter. 

Koodos to adding the caraway seeds. I have never had this dish with them but I love it.

My family loved this but I changed a few things...used apple cider vinegar instead of plain vinegar..threw in a 1/4 cup of bacon bits...left out the water and caraway seeds.  Chilled it for 30 min....made a great salad.

Loved the recipe. decided I wanted something sweet and tangy to go with my hot wings and started looking for a simple sweet and sour cabbage recipe. I used green cabbage since it is what I had. and I melted the butter and brown sugar in the pan then added my cabbage and then poured in the vinegar. I didnt like the idea of boiling it. It turned out fabulous I could just sit with a fork and eat just cabbage!

I merged this recipe with the Danish red cabbage recipe that popped up using currant jelly instead of sugar and I also used Apple Cider Vinegar, more in keeping with the pork roast and applesauce I made.

Love the taste of the cabbage cooked in the brown sugar water and with caraway seeds. Delicious. I would use less vinegar next time. I thickened the sauce with corn starch and poured that over the cabbage.  YUM!

I liked the flavor that the carraway seeds gave to the cabbage.  I used chicken broth instead of water and cider vinegar.  Next time I'm going to add a chopped apple if I have it on hand.

This recipe was so delicious. I made this dish to accompany mashed potatoes and chicken. I did not have caraway seeds and used fresh nutmeg.  My brother who is not a vegetable eater, loved it and returned for several helpings. I will definitely make this recipe again.

I loved this. I used green cabbage, that’s all I had. I followed the rest of the recipe to the letter. It was excellent. Don’t be put off by the amount of caraway, once this is cooked, it’s quite subtle.

I love sweet and sour foods and red cabbage is very high on my list, I did add Onions and Apple slices.  It is so good I eat it as a snack without other foods.

Really good! I used less butter, and also added in some spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and ginger with the brown sugar. Soooo yummy!

I use coconut oil to help in cooking the cabbage. I then add 1/4 cup water . I  omit the caraway seeds and put in my cabbage and add 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup white vinegar  and cook it all together.  This way , thae cabbage absorbs the flavor.  I also add sliced onion to the mix.

Yummy side! The butter got chunky after a day in the fridge, but otherwise this recipe is A+!
