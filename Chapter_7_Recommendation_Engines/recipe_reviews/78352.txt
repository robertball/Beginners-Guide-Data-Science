I thought this recipe sounded interesting but was a bit disappointed in the end with both the flavor, which was not very distinctive (maybe needed more cranberries?), and the appearance, which was kind of pinkish-gray in color.  I think I would prefer whole cranberries in my stuffing so that you could tell and taste what they were.

Made this in the crockpot and stuffed the bird with it for Thanksgiving this year.  There wasn't a single drop left over.  Note: I used fresh cranberries halved and all of the nuts that were called for as well as the full can of broth in the crock pot.

I've made this two years in a row and everyone goes absolutely crazy about it! People preferred to catered stuffing last year and over my mom's amazing age old traditional stuffing this year. Even my dad who doesn't like nuts or cranberries absolutely loved this stuffing. I made both years with a fresh loaf of multigrain bread - it's the move.

First off we really liked the nuts in this stuffing, the cranberries, not so much. This recipe is not false advertisement as he states that it is tangy in his description. That being said, if you love the tartness of cranberries you will probably enjoy this stuffing. I used fresh cranberries and cut them in half.  I would also add extra rubbed sage and other stuffing spices you enjoy and use the whole can of chicken broth.
