Being the first reviewer I would have liked to have given a more favorable rating but I made it exactly as written and felt I needed to be honest in hopes that it helps others wanting to make it. The recipe did not specify to remove the seeds from the jalapenos or the chipotle's and I think at least one of the peppers need that if not both. I like spicy but it was far too much for me and completely overpowered and ruined the dish. If you like your chili spoon stand up in the bowl thick you will either need to cut back on the broth or use quite a bit of masa harina as the submitter noted. What I will say is that if I could have gotten past the heat, this would have had excellent flavor. The Shiner Bock, tequila, and steak sauce came together nicely and made the beef super tender. So much in fact that I do plan on making this recipe again but you can bet I will be seeding the peppers.

We liked this!  It was very spicy.  If you're at all sensitive to spicy heat, I would recommend dialing back the chipotle peppers and the jalapenos.  With the smoked paprika, you could even omit the chipotle peppers in adobo and still get the smoky flavor.  This recipe had great flavor and the tri tip was great in this.

This recipe is a great place to start your own creation.  I started with the beef.  Rather than cube it, I sliced it into tiny thin pieces that would cook thoroughly and become tender and delicious.  I used the bacon drippings to brown my beef and added a little olive oil to saute onions and garlic.  I made the chili somewhat spicier by adding additional chili powder and cayenne pepper.  As I said, I used this recipe as a pallet and added to it to suit the taste I knew my family would like.  I have made it straight by the recipe and it is excellent, but go ahead, add you on touches and make it yours.

Revisions: I didn't have 6 T. Of chili powder, so I just used what I had, about 1-2 T. I didn't have the chipotle peppers in Adobe sauce, so I just left that out. The corn I had on hand was just regular canned corn, not Mexican style. Also, the tri tip o used was already cooked, left over from a previous meal, and the inspiration for trying this recipe! Everything else I did as-written.

The recipe turned out great! The entire family enjoyed it.  It is a bit spicy, but we like spice. I served it with grated cheese and sour cream for garnish, and corn bread on the side.

We will definitely make this again! The only thing I think I might change is to cut back on the steak sauce just a bit. The flavor dominated somewhat; I think slightly less might provide better balance.

Really nice flavor with the beer and tequila. We dialed it down quite a bit on the spice just from past experiences. Went to 1 1/2 tablespoons of chili powder, 1 chipotle pepper and 1/2 jalape√±o(seeded). This is a good option for those who like spice but also want to taste the chili. Also, I added tri-tip that I had previously smoked the day before so it did not need cooking. Really nice but I am sure it is equally delicious the way the recipe states to cook it. Will definitely make again.

I really liked the sound of this recipe and knew I would have to modify it because I didn't have everything on hand, but I was not disappointed!! I omitted the corn, green pepper, jalapenos, and tequila. I substituted 3 cans of Rotel and 1/2 cup worcestershire sauce for the  steak sauce. I added 2 15 oz cans of black beans drained and 1/2 cup sugar to balance the heat. ( I always put sugar in my chili). It was delish! We also served over a mound of rice as a little filler and for more texture.
