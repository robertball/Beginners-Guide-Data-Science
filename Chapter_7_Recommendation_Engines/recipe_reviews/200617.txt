I was a little skeptical at first but really wanted a refreshing drink on a 97 degree day so I gave it a try and WOW it was fabulous! I followed the directions exactly (used vodka) poured it over ice, garnished with lime and could not believe how great this drink was! Before I knew it the whole pitcher was gone! (I made it for 3 people) This one you must try this summer!

I made this as an alternative to Hurricanes for a Mardi Gras celebration. 5 gallons made, not much left was all the review I needed.

LOVE this drink, but it definitely has the hidden kick that some others mentioned! It's cold weather out but I made spicy food and this goes splendidly with it. I substituted lemon/lime crystal light (but made it concentrated) and it's perfect! Poured it over crushed ice, divine.

Made this tonight for friends. Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe. No reason to change a thing. Really refreshing. It is kind of like the hard lemonades out there but less sweet. Great for entertaining or something to sip at the pool.

Absolutely wonderful!  I made this for Bunco night- without even tasting- and everyone loved it.  It was the first drink to go, among wine and other cocktails.  This would be very fun and refreshing for summer.  I doubled the recipe and used 3 BudLight Lime & 3 Corona.

We make this as a Strip and Go Naked also, but with whiskey, beer and lemonade concentrate, in a blender with lots of ice, sort of an "adult slushie"

I had forgotten all about this drink. Back in the day it was called Strip and Go Naked! Drink with caution. From what I remember it was very good.

This truly is awesome, easy, and delicious! My wife and I drank about 3 pitchers in 5 days. I might top it with a sprig of mint. 

I would try using rum instead of vodka and add a little mint and call it a "Mexican Mojito"

Made this as a signature drink at a couples shower a couple months ago and everyone raved over it.  Everyone kept asking me what was in it and despite having a liquor bar and beer, this ran out first and everyone wished there was more.  It became the request at bachelorette parties and events the rest of the summer.  I used Tecate and it turned out great!

I don't normally like Corona however, after seeing this recipe I thought I would try it out.  Holy Cow!  AWESOME Drink!!!  This also goes well with the Watermelon Fire and Ice Salsa.

Awesome! My new favorite drink! I wouldn't change a thing. I like Margaritas, but can't drink them because of the heavy drink mix and the tequila gives me a headache. This tastes much better than a margarita and is not heavy on the stomach.

Excellent and refreshing drink for hanging out at the pool! We changed it up tho: 1 can BL Lime, 1 can BL Orange, 1 can Corona Premium and used 1/3 can each of Limeade, Lemonade, and OJ. A little too orangy, but still delicious!

Made a pitcher of this for our family cookout and it was the perfect choice ... light and refreshing.  I followed the recipe exactly (using Dos Equis beer and including the optional vodka).  We all really enjoyed it; I wouldn't change a thing.

This has been the go to drink at our cabin for more than 20 years. We do use a whole can of vodka. We have always called it A Slip and go Naked. If you drink more than one that is a definite possibility!

I've been making a version of this for over 20 years with a few slight changes, I eliminate the water from the pink lemonade and only use the concentrate, use a mickey or 13 oz of vodka and 6 beer I use bud light lime to skip the garnish step and still get the lime taste, find it easier to do the shopping and I only have to make it once, we called the mixture "porch crawler", perfect for a hot day!!!

my personal recipe calls for a full handle of cheap vodka (congress, crystal palace, burnetts, etc), a 30 rack of beer (natty works for this but you can use pretty much anything), and 5 of the frozen juice concentrates you can buy at walmart (any flavour works, they all kinda mesh together). stir it up in a huge bin and you're golden

Yum-tastes like a margarita! I've made it several times for friends and everyone has liked it too. Great that you can make a pitcher and just pour as you want, not single drink after single drink. Great to take to a party, or have for a party. Followed recipe exactly.
