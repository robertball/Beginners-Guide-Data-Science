This was delicious!  We doubled it for a dinner party and it was met with lovely reviews from the "I don't even really like seafood" folks.  We did have to make some changes based on being in land-locked Tennessee, though.  All I had was chicken stock, unfortunately, so I had to use that and the crab legs at the store were a bit dismal so I left those out.  The great thing about this is its versatility, though, because it came out great (I plan on making my own stock, hopefully, next time.)  This was my first time working with any kind of clam/mussel/etc, so I was a bit nervous but everything cooked up wonderfully. Also, I'm not one for spice, but the red pepper flakes gave it a lovely depth that's needed with this dish.  Served it with some crusty bread to soak up the yumminess!!  Thanks for a great recipe!

The picture provided with the recipe seems to show celery and potatoes, but there are none called for in the recipe?  What gives - is it the wrong photo, or is the recipe missing ingredients?

this recipe was great.  i did end up adding about 3/4 of a small can of tomato paste to increase the tomatoe flavor which is a great contrast to the seafood.  next time i might try it with red wine.  i also used more clam juice than stock.

This was very good but maybe a little milder than I prefer. I didn't have fish stock so I used chicken stock and added 2 tablespoons of fish sauce which was perfect.The next time I make this I will add a little more of the green herbs and some fennel. my family loved it as is.
