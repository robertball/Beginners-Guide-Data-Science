I was going out tonight but needed to fix dinner for my husband. This recipe was so easy to throw together, required no attention to cooking, and husband said it was good. I used boneless thighs I already had in the freezer. Perfect!

We really enyoyed this meal!  I actually used frozen corn (not cobs) and it turned out great.  I also used garlic salt for more flavor.  It was so easy, I will def make this again!

I was searching for a better way to BBQ drumsticks for dinner when I came across this recipe. I didn't have pinto beans so I used black beans. I also smashed one clove of garlic for each wrapping. It was a hit in my house, and I have picky eaters.

Easy and tasty recipe as is.  Easily adaptable to your personal tastes.  I simply mix up my favorte baked beans, add about a half cup of frozen corn, place in a big baking dish and throw some seasoned drumsticks in with it.  Bake for an hour at 375 and Voila!  A quick and tasty one-dish meal.  Thanks for a great recipe, Trina!

We took the kids camping and put half ear of corn and 1 drumstick with baked beans (all I had) in foil, double wrapped and put in the campfire. Kids thought it was the best and with the baked beans, didn't really need the BBQ sauce. It was EXCELLENT! Thank you

I had my 9-year-old help me get this ready for dinner.  I made it as written, using Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce.  We didn't measure the BBQ sauce . . . just squirted some on from the bottle.  I think that next time I will add a little extra seasoning (maybe garlic powder, or a little Kickin'chicken).  I'm going to look for a larger can of beans, too, because my daughter seemed to enjoy those the most.  

It wasn't a fancy meal, but it was easy enough for my little beginner to help out, and everyone seemed to enjoy it.  I don't normally fix drumsticks, and I think next time I might try thighs or breasts, for meatier portions.  

Thanks for the recipe!

Thank you for the reviews. It is versatile recipe for what you have on hand! I do like the black bean suggestion. I have very picky eaters, which is why there are not alot of spices although glad you all enjoyed!

I followed directions exactly.  After 40 minutes chicken was not done.  Had to cook an additional 15 min.  Also, chicken was rather bland.

I don't know what I love most about this recipe - the SIMPLE preparation, the GREAT tastes, or the EASY clean-up!  Trying this for the first time, I was worried that the drumsticks might be dry and the corn over-cooked - I was thrilled to find it was the juiciest, best tasting BBQ chicken I've had in a long time, and the corn was absolutely perfect!  The beans are an added treat.  This is fast and easy to make, and there is nothing to clean up afterwards - what could be better?  I will definitely make this again and again.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

The bbq sauce flavor kind of steamed away.. if that's how you explain it. I liked this, but wouldn't make it again unless I was camping.

This  was really great.    The only changes i made was also seasoning chicken with garlic powder and using Bush's beans instead of plain beans.  I baked for 45 minutes and legs were cooked through so i then opened foil to expose chicken and turned on broiler to low for an additional 8 minutes to get a nice charbroiled finish  which gave it a true barbecue taste.

This recipe was so easy and delicious! I used drumettes instead of drumsticks and used less bbq sauce to cut down on sodium. I had so much food in each packet (I had two small corn cobs in each packet), my chicken didn't cook thoroughly at the 40 minute mark. I cooked everything thing for 60 minutes and that worked out well. Will make again!

We prepared packets at home and then popped them in the campfire when we went camping the next day. They turned out great! Really delicious, easy to prepare, and it felt like an authentic "Cowboy Meal." Will definitely keep this on the list of camping meals, and will probably fix at home, too. Thanks, Trina!

How can anyone not love this!!! I used chicken breast with the bone in just cut in half with the center bone removed which gave it the best true taste like never before. The center bone is only cart ledge anyway but the skin and fat gave it the perfect balance ( remove the fat for a low fat dish )

This was easy and good. The pintos didn't have much flavor. Next time might just do the chicken and the corn or try black beans cause my BF isn't the biggest fan of pintos. All and all though good recipe and super easy to cook and clean up.

Chicken was really tender and yummy. I used chicken breasts instead of drumsticks and cooked, using the foil tent, for 55 minutes. I also used frozen corn instead of the corn on the cob. Thank so much for the recipe.

Delicious and so easy! I used can corn, white beans, sliced some onions and garlic and put it on top of the chicken. I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce. At the end I dumped it all out in the pan and put it under the broiler for a couple of minutes. So good!!
