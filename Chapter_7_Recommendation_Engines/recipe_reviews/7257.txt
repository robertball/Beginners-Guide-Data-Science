This cake is the best apple cake I have ever had. If it came out dry and crumbly I think you might want to try again, you may have made a mistake somewhere. I added a Tsp of Vanilla, 2 Tsp's of cinnamon, and a 1/4 Tsp of nutmeg. After the cake came out of the oven I poked holes in it using a toothpick and then poured a mixture of brown sugar and butter over it. I didn't do the topping in the recipe but I imagine it would be equally as good.

when I look for recipes I usually go for the ones that have the highest ratings. I wanted to give this a try and was glad I did. I tasted it before the sauce & it tasted great. Even better with the sauce.

This cake is absolutely wonderful. I made this cake a few days ago and unfortunately I dropped it on the floor as I was taking it out of the oven, so I was not able to make the topping or even taste the cake(even though my kids ate the parts that was still in the pan and raved over it.) But I made it again tonight following some of the additions from previous reviews. I followed the review that suggested using heavy cream and vanilla in the topping, which was fantastic. However I also mixed my apple pieces with 1/2 cup of brown sugar and a teaspoon of cinnamon then let them sit while I prepared the cake mix. I only added 1/2 cup of coconut because I was concerned that the cake would come out dry and crumbly as stated by another review...oh and I substituted pecans for the walnuts and added a teaspoon of vanilla extract to my batter. At any rate I was more than thoroughly pleased with the results. The cake is very rich and moist, and because I love warm cake I poured the topping  on while it was warm and tasted a piece..FANTABULOUS! The only thing I would say otherwise is that maybe my apples were too big,the recipe calls for two apples and I felt that maybe I could have used one, but my fiancee' who loves apples disagrees.

This cake is absolutely delish! So moist, it's unbelievable. I didn't have any vegetable oil so I used olive oil instead, I know it sounds wierd, but I think the olive oil added to the moistness of the cake and made it that much better.  I'll have to try it next time with veg. oil.  Everyone loved it, I'll definitely make this one again!

Awesome, moist cake.  I used heavy cream instead of milk and a little vanilla in the sauce. Very rich and yummy.

So good! I found this recipe through an ingredient search (apples, coconut) since I was trapped at home by a snowstorm. The cake was dense, moist and flavourful, in fact, my favourite apple cake recipe now.  I cut to 1 1/2 cups sugar and it was plenty sweet with the topping on it. Also, in place of self-rising flour, I used 2 tsp of baking powder and 1/2 tsp salt. Recommended recipe.

This was a hit at a family gathering! And I don't cook! It made me look like I was hiding my secret cooking skills from my husband! That was the only bad thing about this recipe!! And I kinda curddled the sauce so my quick fix was to sprinkle brown sugar on top! They didn't even know the difference! Thanks for submitting!!

Maybe I did something wrong but the cake was not moist at all and we did not care for the taste either.

I grated to apples too. I didnâ€™t have enough oil so I substituted a couple of bananas to make up the difference.  Also added cinnamon and vanilla to the cake and to the glaze.  The family loved it!

I tend to make cakes with the most reviews, but I was looking for an apple cake using self rising flour. This was delicious. I added vanilla extract and cinnamon. It was so good.

This is my favorite apple cake. When I make it, it's gone by the next day. We make a trip for fresh apples just for this cake. Love it!!

I made it and it was very good and moist. Since we are coconut lovers we added a little coconut flavor.

This would be a great breakfast cake with coffee. I would add extra apples to get more of the apple flavor. It's a very dense cake.

A lot of reviewers have complained that this is dry and crumbly - here are some suggestions.  First, you might want to omit the coconut which can gave a dry "finish" to a cake.  Also, please check that your self-raising flour is very fresh and lastly do not overbake. These are the steps that I followed and it worked.
