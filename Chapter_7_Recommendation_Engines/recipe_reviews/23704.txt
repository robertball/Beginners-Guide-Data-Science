This is one of my new favorite bread recipes! I adapted it for my bread machine by cutting the recipe in half. I noticed that there was no salt in the recipe so I added 3/4 of a teaspoon just to be safe and the loaf came out perfect. I used 1 and 1/4 teaspoon of bread machine yeast, 1 egg and substituted coconut extract for the vanilla extract. I baked it on the regular crust sweet bread setting. It was so sweet and soft - almost more like cake than bread. It also made great toast. Delicious!

I wanted a Hawaiian-style bread like the pull-apart you find in the store.  I wanted to make the dough in my bread machine.  I took the suggestions of Jennifer 72--cut the recipe in half, added the salt, changed the vanilla extract to coconut extract.  I addedd 2TBSP water to adjust for the 1/2 egg I didn't use. 

I had to keep adding flour to the recipe to make a dough that I could handle because this is more of a batter bread.  When the dough was right and the cycle was finished, I patted the dough out flat.  I cut the dough into 18 or 20 small pieces.  I rolled those pieces into small balls and placed them in a greased angel food pan.  I let that rise till doubled in size, about 1 1/2 hours. I baked it at 350degrees for about 35 minutes--till brown on top. I forgot to add some egg wash on top, could do that next time.  Also, I might cover the bread or turn it down.  The sweetness of the dough caused the brown top to get crispy instead of chewy.

After baking, I let it sit in the pan on a cooling rack for five minutes.  Then I turned the bread upside down to remove it.

The guests at my Hawaiian-themed dinner party loved it, it made a great pull-apart bread.

If anyone tries it this way, I hope you measure how much extra flour you add.  It might have been as much as 3/4cup+.  I just kept adding flour.  Also, I would omit the substitution for the 1/2 egg, just forget about adding extra water.

Really glad that it came out so well.  Enjoy, and hope my comments help.

This recipe turned out awesome! I cut the recipe in half and added honey to the warm water/yeast mixture to help activate the yeast. I also turned them into dinner rolls and gave them a light egg wash prior to baking. Made these on Thanksgiving and everyone loved them. I'll definitely be making these again, a perfect bread to make hum bows!

We decided to make rolls because we were wanting a bread for Thanksgiving dinner.  This was so close to the store bought we could almost eat them all in one day!  Added 1 teaspoon salt to ingredients, about a teaspoon or two of honey to yeast to help activate it and added an egg wash to tops.  Recipe made about 15 huge rolls that look just like the picture!

This turned out differently than expected.  The dough was runny, sticky, and hard to work with.  It also didn't rise as much as I would like, and wasn't sweet enough, even with all the sugar.  It was good hot out of the oven with butter, but I probably won't make this again.

Yum, this was very good. We ate it fresh from the oven! I cant wait to try it toasted for breakfast. I did make it in my bread machine I have a 2lb breadmaker and thought I could get away with 2/3 of the recipe. It rose too high and didnt quite bake all the way on top, so I put it in the oven a few minutes more and it was fine. Will make again! But only half recipe.

Of all the Hawaiian clone recipes, this is the best. It absolutely reproduces the classic bread.  But it does so much more. You will get 4 pounds of dough and for me, I divide it into 4-1 pound dough balls.  Each to be used for different breads-pecan rolls, dinner rolls, loaf bread, crescent rolls and so on.  I think this dough is the most versatile I have ever come across in 50 years of baking.

Only downfall...NEEDS SALT.  Bread was wonderful.  I made a french loaf out of it to eat with Grilled Pineapple Chicken sandwiches and it was great.  This one goes into my cookbook but with SALT added.

Not sure if this has already been stated. 

The only thing i did different was proof the yeast with about a tbs of sugar so that it was super creamy and foamy. That made a HUGE difference the second time. I also did NOT bake them in cake pans, as they are more condensed and seemed to have to cook longer and were a bit dry. I layed them out on a cookie sheet. Not only were they sweet and delicious but even FLUFFIER this way. So. Friggin. Good.!!

This bread is a huge hit.  I made it for a Hawaiian themed party and now everyone asks me to make this for any occasion.  It is simple to make and tastes great.

Great tasting bread!  Relatively easy to make, although kids can be impatient with waiting for the bread to proof.

I made this as I would a yeast bread, not a batter bread - so I added enough flour to make a knead-able dough and let it knead in the mixer for several minutes.  I skipped the ginger because it just sounded a little off to me, and we didn't miss it at all.  I made these into buns and they rose HUGE and made almost mini round loaves rather than buns!  These had very subtle pineapple flavor and were wonderful with our chicken teriyaki and grilled pineapple sandwiches!  Will make again!

Made exactly by the recipe the first time except used 5 tsp of bulk Red Star active dry yeast instead of the envelopes of yeast.  I keep the bulk yeast in a sealed jar in the freezer and it seems to last nearly indefinitely. It is much cheaper than the envelopes and I get a more consistent and predictable rise.  The bread was pretty good but with no salt it was a bit bland.  The other complaint was the round loaves didn't lend themselves to slicing for the toaster for breakfast.

I made the recipe again adding 1 TBS of salt and cooking in 2 standard loaf pans.  Increased the cooking time to 45 to 50 minutes to allow for the larger loaf size.  This was incredible.  The added salt made for a much fuller flavor and 2 standard loaves were much more manageable than the 3 round loaves.  I make this often primarily for breakfast.

Easy to make, for a yeast bread. Most of the time is waiting for it to rise. I did find after the first rise the dough was sticky and I had to add more flour and knead a bit to get it to form into desired shapes. I made one loaf in a round pan and the other two in smaller bread pans. I think the flavor is fantastic, don't see the need to add salt to the the dough as other reviews recommended. I will definately make this recipe again.

Excellent!  This is the flavor and the texture I've been looking for in a home made bread. It is very similiar to the Kings Hawaiian bread I've bought at the grocery. I didn't have any vanilla flavoring but it didn't matter. I followed the recipe as written.  This is my new favorite!

This bread was very tasty!  I cut the recipe in half, so I used one egg and one egg white.  I also used applesauce for half of the butter.  Maybe it was due to my substitutions, but the bread was not able to be formed into loaves after proofing the first time.  I had to pour it out of the bowl because it was more batter-like than doughy.  Regardless, the bread rose nicely the second time and baked up wonderfully.  I also did not have any ginger so I left it out - I think it would be good either way.  I served this with Jamaican Jerk Pork Chops from this site and it made a wonderful tropical meal!

The consistency of this bread was wonderful. I made it for a buffet breakfast for 50 people and it was gone it minutes! I recommend substituting coconut extract and to make the loaves the size of 2 fists...they bake much quicker this way

I saw one other review that commented about the "batter" appearance of the mix and that's what I got.  The "batter" didn't rise, then when I POURED it onto a well floured work area it just spread.  It didn't rise the second time and remained the same during cooking.  The final product was like a weapon!  Heavy and dense dough.  It sounds like a wonderful recipe - wondering what went wrong?

This bread was great! I was hoping for a copycat of King's Hawaiian bread, and this was pretty close. I made it in my bread machine on the sweet bread setting, 2 lb, light crust. Next time I'll do rolls. I HALVED the recipe to fit in the machine (I also omitted the first water because I put the yeast in last, and I used 2 eggs to make up for the less liquid). After it was done mixing, I thought the dough looked very wet and small, but I left it alone. When it was done, the loaf had risen to the top! I will definately be making it again. We love the King's bread, but I don't love buying 12 tiny rolls for $5. Now I don't have to!

I have made this recipe several times and it's a big hit every time.  The first time I didn't change a thing, then I tried some of the variations other mentioned.  I also used coconut milk instead of water for the 2nd 1/2 cup water and added a 1/2 tsp of coconut extract along with the vanilla.  I did find (as another reviewer mentioned) that 6 cups flour was not nearly enough.  I end up making 4 loaves which I form into a ball and put each into prepared round cake pans.  My neighbors are always happy to help with any extra loaves.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good. Sweet with great flavor. I used about 7 1/2 c. of flour and it was still very sticky. The first rise was very quick and went over the top of the bowl I had it in.

This bread fills the house with an amazing sweet aroma, here are the changes I made. I sifted the flour after I measured it I used 1/4 cup of water and an additional 1/4 cup of pineapple juice then used the 1/2 cup of warm water like the recipe called for. I also used a pinch of kosher salt in when I was adding in the flour and I used half whole wheat flour and half AP flour. The dough was like a stickier bread dough but not at all batter-like. I baked them on parchment lined baking sheets for 25 minutes at 350. Really Beautiful bread was my result, yum! I made this to have with a honey ham I am going to make tomorrow :)

Excellent - I'm new at baking bread - this came out very well. Light, tasty.  Expect it will make wonderful french toast.  Should freeze well also. Recipe is for 3 loaves.

A smashing hit at the super bowl party. I paired it with the tomato spinach spread from this site. They paired well together (although i did doctor the dip a bit, it was on the bland side, a little ramano cheese gave it flavor).  People couldn't believe it was homemade!

I made this recipe this morning, followed the directions exactly, The only change I made was to add 1 Tbsp of sugar to the yeast and added 1 tsp of salt. It turned out amazing, The only extra flour I added was to the bread board when I turned it out after the first rise, I only added enough to allow me to pick it up and put it into the bread pans, It made two wonderful light fluffy loaves, They rose high and are beautiful and taste fantastic!! I think if I were going to make rolls I would have to add more flour to shape them but it is a batter bread so the batter is sticky but it is suppose to be. YUM! will absolutely be making this again.

i hate when i try something and i can't get it to the level that everyone else finds it.

as far as appereance and texture go, this turned out pefectly....but in the land of taste buds....BLEH!

I cannot figure out what i'm doing wrong, but i have made this 3 times.  the dough rises well.  i have tried it with both active yeast and rapid yeast.  but all 3 times i've made this it has a fermented flavor which is just not right tasting. all the ingredients are fresh, so i know it's not rotten juice, b/c i even drank a glass to make sure it was ok.  it's almost like the yeast is fermenting the pinapple juice.

i'm a pretty experienced baker so i've tried, adding the salt, increasing the sugar, adding flour, etc, etc to get it to an edible flavor.

i've read a lot of reviews that say it tastes as good as store bought, and i can't get past the fermented flavor to agree.

if anyone has suggestions i'm totally for it, i desperatly want this recipe to work. but after 3 attempts, i have to give it a 1 star.

I had good results with this recipe following it as is with the exception of adding 1/2 teaspon of coconut extract.  I also considered s similar recipe that included that coconut extract, so I thought why not.    I was concerned that this dough did not rise as much as I expected it to.  I had to set it out much longer than specified and it still didn't rise as much as I would have liked.  Since so many reviewers suggested salt, I will definitely try adding some next time I make this.  The flavor of my bread was very yummy but  I wish my loaves were a little more rounded.  Mine were definitely not flat but not as pretty as the ones pictured in many of the photos on the site.

This was easy to make, and yes the dough was a bit battery--the recipe even calls it a stiff batter.  It came out great and baked well.  It wasn't as sweet as I hoped, but my husband likes his sweets and really enjoyed this bread.  

I formed the dough into rolls rather than three loaves and baked as directed, and it came out great.

Made the recipe as shown except when it comes to baking. Gave it an egg white wash with a spinkle of sea salt on top. Very nice.  Next time I make. Will cut the ginger to less then half. Like the taste but a bit too pronounced.  Made roles and bread.  Both turn out excellent.

I have made this bread several times.  I usually make a scaled down version so that it fits into my ABM.  I wanted a taste that would be similar to a sweet bread recipe I have from Finland.  I make the following changes, I add 1/2tsp salt and instead of ginger I use 1/4 to 1/2 tsp of cardamom. That change in spice while still using vanilla makes such a difference. I still use the pineapple juice.  Though my original Finnish bread does not.  I just let the machine do the work using the sweet dough setting, then I remove the dough, punch it down and divide it into three parts, I roll each part into a long rope and then braid them together.  I then place the braided bread into a longer loaf pan, let rise again, brush with egg white/water mixture and bake for 25 min.  My family loves this bread.  For an extra sweetness you can brush it again after baking with a water/sugar mixture.

I like to make a recipe exactly as it is written the first time, but I didn't have any pineapple juice this morning, and I didn't want to waste gas running to the store for one item. So, I used the juice I had on hand--Trader Joe's spicy pear cider. My eggs also looked a little small, so I used three whole eggs plus an additional yolk (I chose the yolk over the white because other Hawaiian bread recipes were heavy on yolk). 

When I divided the bread into three sections, I put two into round cake pans, as directed. Then, I took the third section and divided it into a dozen rolls. 

I baked the rolls for 15 minutes and baked the bread for 25. They both came out amazing! The dough was very sticky when I let it rise the first time, but I just went with it instead of adding any flour because that has worked for me in other recipes. The final texture in the rolls and the bread was light and airy and soooooo delicious.

This was at least as good as the Hawaiian bread I can find in the grocery aisle simple because it's so fresh and delicious and so cheap to make!

Love this recipe.  I also cut the recipe in half and made it with two cups of wheat flour and one cup of all-purpose flour.  This bread is so yummy and tastes so much better homemade than store bought (no surprise)!

This bread is FABULOUS ! ! I made it for an anniversary dinner Saturday April 16, 2011. One of the guests has dairy allergies, so I substituted butter flavored Crisco for butter and it took off from there. My guest was a little put out because everyone wanted the Hawaiian bread that was just for her( there were other rolls). So thank you, thank you, thank you Saundra for a delicious dairy free bread.  A grateful  Lucretia Jones

The only reason i rated it 4 stars was because ,the cake batter was hard to handle due to it being more like cake batter, instead of putting on a floured surface ,which i couldn't do I deflated in the bowl and when it came to pouring i used a big spoon and divided it into equal pans,the result as you can see in my picturewas wonderful,I loved it!!

Five star deliciousness!! I made this recipe with a few changes as suggested by other reviewers.  I substituted the second amount of water with pineapple juice for added flavor and added 3/4 tsp of salt.  Tastes just like the Hawaiian Sweet Rolls you buy at the store.  I proved my dough for about 2 1/2 hours the first time then knocked it down and shaped it into balls for rolls.  YES, THE DOUGH IS STICKY!  Resist the urge to dump a ton of extra flour in by simply putting 1/4cup of flour on a plate and lightly coating your hands before handling each roll.    I measured my rolls to be about 2.5 - 2.75 ounces each but I think I would change this and measure them out to be about 2 ounces each.  This way, the recipe would generate about two dozen rolls.  I placed the balls in a greased disposable lasagna pan--resist the urge to cram them in!  Yes, the dough does spread but it also puffs up nicely.  I proved them a second time for about 1.5 hours, until they were nicely puffed.  I did a quick egg wash and then baked them for about 25 minutes--watching them closely after 20 minutes.    Quick, easy and everyone loved these.

I eliminated the ginger.  I brushed the loaves with butter and cooked all three in a large oven-safe skillet for 30 min.  I would like a little stronger taste of pineapple.  Next time I'll substitute  the second 1/2 water for pineapple juice.

The better was wet as everyone said but it baked well and tastes great. Nice and sweet. My son loves hawaiin bread but said this taste “sour” to him. I don’t know what that means.  Next time I’ll try it with water instead of the pineapple juice add honey to the yeast to get it to fluff better. Nice recipe.

I don't know what King's Hawaiian rolls everyone else leaving comments is eating, but these don't taste a thing like King's Hawaiian rolls. 

They don't taste bad, but they aren't close to the original.

I know this recipe said a stiff batter, but even after letting it rise it was still very sticky and not firm at all. My measurements were correct; I used well over 6 cups of flour yet it’s still sticky and unmanageable. The batter resembles quick biscuits made out of pancake batter. All I have to do is bake them now.

Never do reviews but this bread is awesome.  Made two loaves and added more flour so I could knead it like regular yeast bread and added 1 teaspoon of salt to the ingredients.  I will definitely be making this again maybe making rolls next time!

I made this recipe for a Hawaiian Luau party. The bread came out of the oven just as the first guest arrived. Not only did the house smell great, but the first loaf was gone in no time flat. Very delicious.  

The dough was still sticky after 6 cups of flour, so I added a 7th and it came out great. The loaves took 25 minutes to bake and were a golden brown. Yum.

Can't seem to get this one right. I follow it all to a T, including making sure the water temp is correct for the yeast but I always get stuck with a really sticky dough that doesn't rise and sad bread. Sorry to say I can't bring myself to try it again bc it's such a waste every time.

We love this recipe. In fact we made it for my sons baby Luau. This is totally reminds me of the bread from the Kona Historical Society. They made bread a couple times a week for purchase and it was amazing.

This bread turned out fantastic!  I made just a couple of alterations...added just a pinch of salt for one.  Second I only used 1/4cup of water for the second part and a 1/4 cup of lemon juice.  Oh and because I ran out of ginger, I didn't add that. The house smells wonderful every time I make this.

Love it, love it, love it. This has become my go to bread for everyday use, however, I have found something odd.  I have had to add 3 cups of flour to the recipe to get a dough.  If I use the 6 cups called for I get a batter so I added flour in 1/4 cup increments and it took 3 more cups to get the dough to the point where it came clean off the bowl, my indicator of a good dough.  I ended up with three good sized, beautiful, tasty loaves with a perfect crumb.  I have made it as a plain sandwich bread substituting milk for the pineapple juice and leaving out the ginger and vanilla, and I have made it substituting apple juice and adding cinnamon and raisins soaked in rum - OUTSTANDING!!!.

I made this according to the recipe.  The dough was wonderful to work with.  I got 32 rolls and an 8x4 pan of bread.  They raised beautifully.  I'll be making these again next week to take ham/cheese sandwiches to a party.  They will all be so impressed.

Firstly, any bread maker knows you add the liquid to the flour. Everyone scoops flour differently (some spoon and others pack. Flour in bread is never an exact science). With that in mind I followed the recipe except I turned on the Kitchenaid with the flour and slowly added the liquid.  Even then I had to add an extra half cup of flour and still had a good half cup or more of the liquid leftover. Adding even an extra couple of tablespoons of liquid can lead to an extra cup of flour. Those who said the recipe was very sticky (or if it doesn't rise, but spreads) try starting with the flour and slowly adding liquid. It's okay not to use all of it!  :)

It was the best homemade Hawaiian bread recipe I've ever made. I'm pregnant and finicky, though, and I was craving Kings. This is no substitute!  My husband and son ate an entire loaf within minutes of it being out of the oven so iI'm sure we'll make it again.

Okay, I wanted to make something like Kings Hawaiian rolls. I made in the dough in my bread machine and made into rolls. They rose beautifully and a lot more in the oven, so you really don't have to wait til they double. These were gorgeous and the perfect texture for what I was looking for but still not as sweet as Kings. I'm going to make another batch tonight with 50% more sugar. I'll let ya know how these come out.... Oh, BTW, my rolls were cooked perfectly, 12 in a 9x13 pan after 25 minutes.

The original recipe was problematic--as I added ingredients, I could see that the recipe called for way too much liquid.  I also wanted to make a non-dairy version that kosher cooks could use with a meat meal. So, I made the following substitutions and changes:

Eggs--only add 2.
Butter--substitute 1/2 cup corn oil
Flour--use 5 cups unbleached white flour and 1 cup unbleached white whole wheat flour.  You will need to add between 1/2 cup to 1 cup more flour to make the dough manageable.
Salt--add a pinch or two.
Proofing-- let the dough rise for a longer time. After the first hour, punch the dough down and let double again--at least one more hour.

To make the dough look like a challah, break off pieces of the dough and form into little balls approximately 1.5 inches in diameter.  Fill two lightly greased 8"-9" cooking pans with the dough, leaving a bit of room between each ball so that the dough can rise for another hour.

Then continue with the recipe as written.

With the variations I made, I got rave reviews.

This came out good.  I made this for freinds because they requested it.  I have to tell you that I didn't have pineapple juice so I used pear and I think it worked just as well.  Hawaiian bread is really not one of my favorites so I don't know if three stars is fair.  My husband liked it too.

Loaves turned out really well.

I was so excited to try this, I Love Kings Hawaiian Bread, I'm giving it a 4, sorry it doesnt come close to Kings brand, However, it tastes great for a bread recipe, I made rolls, rd.cake pan and a small loaf.
 I did however add more flour, 6 cups was way to sticky. I baked the rolls for 15 mins and the loaf and cake pan 25 mins. Like I said great taste, but not what I was hoping for..
 I may look at different Hawaiian bread recipes and try those.

My kids loved this bread. It's the second bread I have ever made & was very simple. Will defiantly make again.
