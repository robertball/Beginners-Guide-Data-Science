This recipe worked great for our dinner party.  Only point is you might have to mix in water and then heat in a pot to produce the amount needed (as this depends on how ch squash you started with).  But very tasty and will make again soon.

Great flavor but beware - itâ€™s really spicy hot, so you may want to cut out at least 1/2 a tsp of the chipotle chili powder & maybe use real milk instead of almond to cut through the heat.
