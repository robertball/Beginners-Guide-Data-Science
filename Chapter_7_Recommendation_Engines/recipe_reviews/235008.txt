This needed major doctoring in order to be drinkable for my taste. I did use lime juice rather than lemon juice as the submitter said it was an okay substitution in the recipe and I had fresh squeezed lime juice readily available. I found it way to "boozey" and even bitter tasting. To doctor it up I added some frozen peaches and some sugar. Blended it in my Vitamix and then served it with a bit of 7-up. Made it drinkable but not something I'd make again. Sorry!
