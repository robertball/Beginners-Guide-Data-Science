Thoroughly, totally, 100% enjoyed this soup.  I used my immersion blender to puree the cooked veggies and broth and used chicken  stock instead of water.  I steamed the cauliflower that was set aside for 1 minute 15 seconds in the microwave, then stirred it in, and loved the texture that it qdded to the creamy soup.  The fresh dill brought  a subtle flavor and, unfortunately, I forgot the cumin seeds (which were optional anyway).  Kac, thumbs up on your soup recipe, it's a winner!

Tried this based on the one review and they were right!  Awesome soup. Thickened without cream or flour, very tasty!!  Did not add quite as much cheese as called for but still great.  Used 2% milk.  Used my immersion blender and just mixed it all up; did not save the separate pieces of cauliflower to add after. Oh, and I used vegetable broth in place of the water.  MUCH tastier!

Very mild tasting soup. Good for getting cauliflower into the diet. I didn't have dill so used a pinch each of dried sage, basil, and oregano. Otherwise stuck to the recipe. Next time I would try vegetable broth in place of the water as the soup was very mild tasting and I did have to increase the salt. As a twist I think one could also substitute the cheddar for parmesan. Very rich.

Next time I make it I will cut the garlic in half. It tended to overwhelm the taste.

Very good! I used chicken stock instead of water and next time I will make the cauliflower florets a bit smaller. I did microwave the florets versus steaming them as another reader did. It's a keeper!

I substituted a can of cheddar cheese soup  instead of two cups of sharp cheddar, which I reduced to about 3/4 cup.  I will use sharp cheddar instead of soup next time. I tried to cut back on the salt, but it needs it.  Other than that, it was tasty, would serve with bisquick muffins

It sounded like a good recipe but it seems a little too complicated so I completely revised it. I decided to mash it all together instead of puree it, then add the milk&dill. Then instead of cumin seeds I just used ground cumin. Then brought it back to medium low heat for 6 minutes. It was perfect.
