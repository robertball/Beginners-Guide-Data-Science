This is awesome soup! The 2 keys to this soup are 1)Avoid the salt 2) Don't serve this soup on the day you make it. If this soup got a bad review, it was because it was served too soon. The gravy leaves a strange aftertaste on the day made but if you wait a day the crab overcomes the strange taste and makes this a great soup! We did add extra crab meat and a little more old bay.

The soup was excellent but as I made it, I made a few adjustments. The wine seemed too strong for my liking so I added only half a cup, when I sampled it before I added the salt I thought it was salty enough therefore I didn't add any at all, and instead of the gravy mix I added one can of cream of celery with one quarter cup of heavy whipping cream. Everyone who tried it thought it was definately restaurant quality.

This was very good and easy. I also had a problem finding white gravy mix so I used McCormicks white sauce blend. My husband loved it. I thought it was a little salty so I will cut down on that next time. I will make it again.

Indeed, this is the perfect crab soup recipe, Yvette!  It's rich--exotic even--the kind of soup you would find in a top notch expensive restaurant.  I've had this soup before, but can't place where or when.  All I recall is that I loved it when I had it the first time--and loved it even more today since I was the one who prepared it!  I doubled the recipe and I'm glad I did.  The wine is a must.  It's the wine that provides the warm, exotic base from which the soup is built.  I used 3/4 of the wine that was recommended, but I wouldn't be afraid to use the full amount next time.  I was wary of using all the wine that was called for after reading the reviews, but if you have a sophisticated palate and are used to having wine in recipes, it won't bother you.  You will embrace it.  I added about 1/2 of the hot sauce called for and didn't detect a change in the flavor.  Honestly, I was afaid to keep going with the hot sauce.  The soup was already so good that I didn't want to fiddle with it and chance that it wouldn't be as good post hot sauce.  The batch I prepared did need salt and I added it one pinch at a time until it was perfect.  If you use salted butter, you may not need any extra salt.  Wow, this one gets a blue ribbon.

This was pretty good, although it wasn't as great as I was expecting.  My only complaint was that the recipe came out way too spicy.  Next time, I'll omit the hot sauce and cut the pepper back to 1/4 tsp.  I decreased the butter to 1/4 cup, and used fat-free half-and-half, and it was just fine.  Also, if the crabmeat you're using is pre-salted, there is most likely no need to add the 1/2 tsp.  You can always add it later if it needs it.  Thanks for the recipe!

Just outstanding, restaurant quality and soooo company worthy!  I did make a couple of changes to this recipe to accomodate 1 lb. of crab meat.  I used the published amounts of butter and flour, then doubled the Old bay and Wocestershire, used double the chicken broth, and 1 1/2 cups white wine & half and half.  In place of the gravy mix (could not find) I used a 12oz prepared white wine veluete sauce.  Simply scrumptious.  A winner for sure.  Making this for Christmas Eve celebrations.  Thanks for a very versitile and delicious recipe, Yvette.

I served this bisque-like soup as part of a New Year's Eve dinner and got rave reviews. However, I used a package of McCormicks "Chicken Country Sauce" instead of country gravy. All 8 guests asked for refills. It was so easy and elegant.

This was far from awesome.  Sounded like it would be awesome, but was actually pretty horrible.  Tasted like you were eating thick salty, gravy.

I can only rate this as Fair. The gravy simply overwhelmed the crab and other flavors.

I should have heeded the warning one reviewer provided regarding the salt. The recipe is way too salty for my liking. It would have been a delicious and easy recipe.  I will make it again minus the salt.

This soup was incredible! My husband raved and raved about it. We have a take out seafood place near us that has a soup very similar to this and I've always wanted to know how to make it. Now I do. I wouldn't change a thing except for your preference for salt & pepper. I think there's enough salt in the butter and pepper in the country style gravy mix. I will definitely be making this again and again. Thanks!!

This recipe was just like the name -- it was awesome! I took the advice of other reviewers and omitted the gravy. It was still fantastic! I love the wine flavor behind it -- i only used 3/4 cup of wine, but was left wishing i used the entire cup. I also didnt add any additional salt, and didnt use the hot sauce -- I am not a big fan of spicy, and I think the spice from the black pepper was plenty. This is a definite keeper and I am looking forward to the leftovers today!

What a great soup! My husband and teenage son couldn't get enough of it! I doubled the recipe. Be careful not to double the spices (use 1-1/2 the amount instead as recommended by AllRecipes.com). Very creamy, which I like, but in the end had to thin it down a tad with a little chicken broth. Will make this again and again!

This is a delicious, satisfying soup. I only had about 1/2 cup of wine, so I added a little extra chicken broth and half-and-half. My crabmeat was claw meat, so I kept back some of the intact claw pieces to use as a garnish. I served this with crusty French bread for a wonderful lunch.

This was delicious. I used the country style cravy first time, but second time around I used regular gravy.  I also added a little bit garlic.  Thanks for sharing.

Sorry, but this soup was really, really bad.  I shoul have headed the advice of some of the other reviewers.  The wine completely overpowers any hint of a crab taste.   To make matters worse, I doubled this recipe.  What an expensive waste of money.  Unable to come up with a way to make it taste better, I poured it down the garbage disposal and had to order carryout  for dinner.  I will never try this again.

Personally I don't think gravy belongs in crab soup and neither does chicken broth.  I was not impressed with this recipe.

This is truly an awesome recipe. I have made this soup on serveral occasions and even added shrimp to the recipe and it was simply delicious. I have tried several crab soup recipes and this recipe by far is the best. I would recommend this recipe to everyone.

Yum! I used an extra cup of the chicken broth instead of white wine, fat free half and half, and two cans of crabmeat. Otherwise, I followed as-is. I froze it to see how it would freeze - two weeks later, it's still great! I plan to make this for a soup swap party.

My husband thinks this is the best soup ever. 8 oz of crab is usually two cans; however on one occasion, I didn't have two cans, so I made the soup with just one. 4 oz is more than enough, I've used that much ever since.

This is the best recipe I have found for Creamy Crab Soup.  I skipped the Dry White Wine and Hot Sauce and is still an awesome soup to eat! So glad I finally found something that you can't only get at the BEACH!

We really loved this soup. I used twice the amount of broth because I could not find white gravey mix in my local store. It was our Christmas eve soup with enough left over for a lunch a few days later. Try it, you will like it.

Good soup but I didn't have half & half cream, I substituted 2 heaping tablespoons butter & a little less than 1 cup milk. Omitted hot sauce & salt. Used 1.25 OZ country gravy mix because it seemed like it tasted too much like gravy at first but after it cooled down, I barely tasted hints of chicken broth & wine, still tasted the gravy strongly. Next time, I will add more milk & butter or buy half & half cream, and I want to try less gravy and regular chicken gravy, definitely add some chopped onion & garlic because after tasting my almost originally published end result, I craved more flavors so I added a dash of onion & garlic powder & what a difference!

A WONDERFUL soup, but I was expecting it to be thicker. I sauted minced onions into the butter and cooked until opaque over medium heat, BEFORE adding the flour, broth, etc. I thought the wine was overpowering intially, but it grew on me after it simmered awhile. I bit salty...I might substitute cream of celery soup for the country gravy next time.

This was really a disappointing recipe. The gravy mix was overpowering and I agree with others, doesn't belong in soup (at least this one).  I love making soup from scratch, and if it were not for the wine (which helped some), I would have thought it was made entirely from a dry mix.

This is a real winner.  The previous reveiwers were right that the wine can be a bit overpowering, but that was just fine with this household.  We cannot comment on the suggestion that it get better on day 2 when the crab flavor permeates the sauce better.  It did not come close to lasting that long.  I omitted the hot sauce.  This has pleanty of flavor without it.

I loved this recipe! The only change I made was I used a lb. of fresh crabmeat and 1/2 lb. of raw shrimp each cut in thirds. It was soooo delicious! I can't wait to eat the leftovers. I would make this again!

Very good soup although it was a bit salty for our taste.  Next time I'll add low sodium broth.  I also only added 1/2 cup of wine (it was all that I had) and it still turned out excellent.  Thanks!

This was a wonderful meal!  My husband loved it.  My only question about it was that I couldn't find country gravy mix in 1 oz. packages, they were 2.64 oz., so I just used part of it.  Other than that, a big success!

I just made some small changes but thought the soup was excellent! When the butter melted I added some diced pepper and onion, I used evaporated milk because that is all I had, and I had wondra gravy flour so I used that instead of a gravy packet. I also didn't add any salt as I used salted butter and added some extra Old Bay at the end. I think I will try it over rice when I have it tonight!

Loved this soup.  I made a few adjustments though.  I used 1 tablespoon of Old Bay seasoning.  I did not add any salt or pepper.  I also used 1 packet of Swanson Seafood Flavor boost. I added that in with the Worcestershire and Old Bay.  I also used 1 Lb. of crabmeat from some King crab legs.  My fiancé is very picky but he loved this.

Excellent.  I am an amateur cook and love trying these recipes.  This recipe is very easy but once they started eating this soup it was hard to stop.  I didn't add salt like a lot of the reviews suggested and it was just right.

This was so simple to make - I scaled the recipe to serve 25 and it still only took about a half hour start to finish.  It's very good but incredibly rich.  It went over really well at my company's Thanksgiving covered dish.
