This recipe need some adjustments. I followed it as written and it came out too buttery and soft to be proper cookie dough so I had to add 1 Tablespoon of flour  but then it tasted too bland so I added  1 Tablespoon of brown sugar. The baking soda isn't really necessary and you can opt to leave it out since the cookie dough isn't being baked. I did make this recipe following the recipe as written but felt it needed adjustments or you can choose to cut the butter in half and the texture should work out fine. I rolled the dough in wax paper and placed in the freezer so I can slice it for ice cream!

The recipe was really good, but it needed one tablespoon more of flour. Other than that, it was good.

I loved this cookie dough! It was so good, and I made a double batch for a friend and I to split. I always want to eat cookie dough, but I don't want to eat a ton if it has raw eggs in it. This is a great alternative that (on the off-chance) won't get you sick! I highly recommend and I added it to my favorites.

I made the cookies this morning.  It made about 12 cookies.   I add peanut butter instead of chips and my husband and son said they tasted good.

I love it, but think my tweaked version might have been more light and less grainy.

it was pretty good,  but it was super liquidy. i would suggest adding some more brown sugar. nestle chocolate chips go best with this recipe.

Awesome.    I usually like to leave store bought cookie dough out to get room temperature so it's soft, but this recipe was absolutely PERFECT from the moment I made it!!!!    Also, I mixed some in my ice cream mix, and it froze awesome too!!!!
