I've made these several times since purchasing my electric pressure cooker, and finally have the liquid-bean ratio just where i like it .  I brown the onion first, then combine 2 cups veg broth, 3 cups water and one bag of dried black beans, and 1 Tbsp olive oil. Cook for 40 minutes and the beans are tender. Salt to taste after they are cooked.

Loved this recipe and it cooked great in my electric pressure cooker.  I ended up adding some fresh lime juice to it.  When I make it again I will skip the balsamic and add lime juice, some cumin and seasoned salt at the end.

These black beans were great!  I couldn't stop eating them.  I will definitely make them again.

A bit salty for my taste. Cilantro was quite strong. I added cumin after which was a nice touch. If I made it again I would use half the water, salt & cilanto and add cumin.

I used this recipe to break in my stovetop pressure cooker. It provided a good introduction to the process, and made a very tasty pot of beans. Not being able to see what's going on in the pot or test the flavor along the way is going to take some getting used to, but the speed and resulting flavors seem to make up for it! The next time, I will probably try a little less water and some different spices, but it was very good as written.

Absolutely delicious.  I like to put in a couple diced chipotles in adobo before cooking the beans for a bit of smoky heat.

Very tasty. I cut the recipe in half and cooked for 40 mins in an electric pressure cooker. Beans were perfectly cooked. Next time I may use a bit less water.

Made half the quantity and turned out wonderful.  Did not add vinegar, otherwise followed recipe exactly.  Huge plus to not have to soak beans.

I have gotten into using my pressure cooker lately.. I love these beans better than presoaked or sprouted beans in the pressure cooker... They just taste better?  Who would have thought that...

It came out good.  It took 20 minutes longer with my stove top pressure cooker.  I did add garlic, cumin and coriander.  I will be sure to use fresh cilantro next time.

I used 4 cups of water and 1 cup of chicken broth.  I think 7 cups of liquid would have been too much for my taste.

I've made this ............. But first I started with the right beans.. I purchased them on line from "Rancho Gordo" .......... Google them.. You'll never buy beans from the supermarket again.. Their black beans are called "Midnight Strollers".

These turned out pretty well.  They are good and not too salty. The only thing is I think it calls for way too much water. I cut it down to 6 cups, and there was still a lot to drain off. I looked up a few other recipes from other sites, and they only used 3-4 cups water.

This recipe worked pretty well. The beans weren’t split or ruptured. The flavor was really good - the cilantro is an excellent addition- but I didn’t really care for the balsamic vinegar. I’ll leave that out the next time. Thank you for the recipe.

Delicious creamy black beans with no soaking.  I ate these exactly as they came out with no adjustments to the recipe and they’re amazing.  Go to black bean recipe from now on!

These beans turned out velvety and delicious! I will be eating these with brown rice and maybe some seasoned ground turkey,  but they're flavorful enough to stand on their own.
