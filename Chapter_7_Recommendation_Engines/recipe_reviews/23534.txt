I have made this recipe four times now (some for gifts, some not) as I have taken into consideration other reviewers suggestions - some good, some not so good :).  The good - yes indeed the suggested amount of whiskey makes it very strong!!  I use 7oz of whiskey and it is almost perfect.  Another good - reduce the almond flavouring by half - perfect!  Not so good - my next batch will be made with 1 cup of heavy cream as I will never again substitute half and half or even half heavy cream with half milk.  This recipe truly needs the total amount of heavy cream (whipping cream for us Canadians).  The cream is a splurge but go for it!  Lastly, I have also made a batch substituting the almond for coconut extract and this is also yum!  A bit more like Baileys.  My next batch I will boost the coffee by just a bit - not much, just a bit!  You can always add, but never take away :).  Although I have been doctoring this recipe, it is excellent and far superior to a lot of other Baileys recipes!  It is all about personal preference.  Regardless, this is a winner!  Don't hesitate to try it!

I always hate when people say they like a recipe--and then tell you how they totally changed it.  But I guess it's possible to be a good cook _and_ a total hypocrite.  So...I loved it!  And instead of 1 cup of cream, I used 1/2 cup of cream and 1/2 cup of milk; I found it a little too thick with straight cream.  I left out the almond extract (simply because I'm not a big fan) and increased the vanilla a little bit.  I also reduced the whiskey by a third, so you should spike to taste.  There's no need to use a blender; I just stirred it with a long-handled whisk and it stayed mixed just fine.  I have never had to take home any of this drink after a party.

absolutely amazing.  i made many batches and handed them out as christmas gifts. EVERYONE really got excited about this and demanded the recipe.  i heated 1/4 cup skim milk over medium heat and dissolved the coffee, then added about 25 milk chocolate chips (in place of the syrup) and melted them until the mixture was smooth.  i then removed it from the heat and combined the other ingredients in a large bowl (i cut the cream and whiskey down to 3/4 cup and the almond down to 1/2 tsp.)  then i gradually whisked in the chocolate mixture.  i tried this recipe with several kinds of whiskey, and i discovered that canadian whiskeys produce a more desirable flavor.  this is a very quick and easy recipe; a must try!

I've made this three times: the first time, I followed the recipe to the letter. It was good, but I thought it was too much whiskey and too much almond flavoring. The second time I cut the whiskey to 1 cup, and the almond flavoring to just under 1/4 tsp. That was much better. The third time, I didn't have any heavy cream, so I just added 1 cup of skim milk, and I think it was the best batch yet. The heavy cream makes it really thick, almost like a milkshake. Skim milk of course thins it, but you get the same amount of creaminess (I think) and less calories. This stuff is best after it's been in the refrigerator overnight--the flavors are fully blended. Great stuff!

I've been making this Irish Cream for 2 years now and give them out as gifts in mass quantities. (48-60 bottles per Christmas). It has gotten tremendous raves from all.  While I am not a big tweaker of recipes, I have a few tiny changes that seem to have been a hit.  First of all, I use only Jameson Irish Whiskey.. the most important ingredient.  I use a cup and a half.  As for the extracts, I only us the real stuff, not imitation. A full teaspoon of vanilla and no more than 3/4th of the almond.   For the sweetened condensed milk, only carnation will give the best results.  The mix is very thick, and I usually also add an ounce of two or half and half, but the full cup of heavy cream is absolutely necessary.  Lastly, I am generous with the chocolate syrup. 2 generous tablespoons.  For the coffee, folgers decaf. (I know, theres plenty of caffeine already in this drink, but the folgers decaff gives a nicer overall flavor)  These ingredients make this an expensive drink, but you will find that most of the people who taste it will tell you its the absolute best irish cream they ever had!!  (Note, other recipes call for eggs in the mix.. which is totally not necessary)   Good luck, I promise you will find this the best recipe you can find for genuine irish cream.

Nobody has mentioned the fact that when cream & whiskey are mixed, the cream separates. I lost  about 1/3 of my recipe having to strain it off. Does anyone have any ideas how to overcome this?

This recipe is SO good and SOO incredibly easy!!  The only thing I changed was to use half and half.  Next time though I think I'll only use 1 half of a teaspoon of almond extract- the almond flavor is pretty stong.

Very enjoyable and was fun to make for gift-giving! I did find it way too strong for my taste(and my SO, too), so I ended up doubling the recipe to reduce the whiskey. Next time, I would also follow some other suggestions and use half and half instead of heavy cream. It gets really thick after refrigerating. Otherwise, I'm having some right now with my coffee...Yum!

This is the BEST! The only changes I made were I used half and half instead of the heavy cream, and omitted the almond extract. Definately a keeper!

I have a glass of Bailey's in one hand and a glass of this recipe in the other.  Here's what I think....
I'd cut the coffee and almond extract to 1/2 tsp each next time.  Take whiskey to 2 cups.  Possibly use milk instead of creme or use 1/2 can of the sw cond milk and 1/2 can of reg evap milk.  Bailey's isn't as thick as this recipe and has slightly less almond/coffee overtones.  Also has a slight more alcohol kick.  
The recipe is good.  I'm just trying to match perfection.

Very rich and good. If you want to make this for a group of people, increase the servings to 32. Then it will require a full, standard (750ml) bottle of whiskey and a full pint of cream. Then you will have no leftovers...just the sweet flavor of heaven!

To avoid having a curdle problem with the cream: the whiskey MUST be added slowly and whisked vigorously to prevent curdling, thus the blender method or food processor can largely prevent this, but slowly is the key even with these two items.

We loved this! I Used 1/4 c. whipping cream and 3/4 c. half and half. I heated the whipping cream, added the coffee granules, chocolate syrup, vanilla and almond extracts and mixed it well and cooled. I used 2 tsp. vanilla and 1/8 tsp. almond extract, and only 1 1/4 c. of whiskey. Fabulous!

This recipe is a great starting point. I have made this 4 0r 5 times now and I think I have it down.  I would use 1 cup of Jameson,(too strong otherwise) 1/4 teaspoon of Almond extract, 1/2 cup heavy cream and 1/2 cup milk (I think it is way too thick with a cup of heavy cream).  I will definately make again!!

This has got to be the easiest and tastiest Irish Cream recipe I have ever made.  The changes I've made are that I don't add the coffee granules (because I do not like the taste of coffee) and I use less Irish whiskey or Irish Liqueur so we can enjoy more of it without the "after effects"!!!  I upped the chocolate syrup because I am a chocoholic.  I have also made it with Amaretto (with or without the Irish whiskey).  It is soooooo easy to adapt to your own taste....mmmmmmmmmmmm

This recipe is deserving of five start. It is quick, easy and truly excellent. I find it particularly nice since it doesn't call for raw eggs. I quadrupled the recipe in my first batch i just made, and now have three big bottles in my refrigerator. We really enjoyed this and plan to make it again and give away as gifts at Christmas time.

What a fantastic Christmas Idea. As with many of the reviewers, we reduced the almond and PLEASE BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN BLENDING,it will seperate if blended to much.  Other than that it is good to see a Irish Cream recipe with no egg. Thanks

This was a hit! I took some advice from other reviews and only used a cup of Whiskey. Irish Whiskey was a bit expensive, so I used Kesslers and it was very good. I bottled the Irish Creme and gave away as Christmas gifts. This will be a new Christmas tradition. One person even admited that it tasted better than Baileys!

Another idea for you dieters, I used Skim Milk instead of heavy cream. It was a lot thinner but still tasted as good. In my second batch, I could not find heavy cream at the grocery store, so I used half n half and that worked just as well.

I looked at other reviews before I made it and it helped.  I used only 1 cup of whiskey(Bushmill's, straight from Ireland) and that could probably use a tablespoon less.  I used 1/2 cup of milk and 1/2 cup of regular whipping cream instead of heavy and that made it a nice consistency.  Excellent!  I would make it again!

Outstanding-this recipe is fabulous especially after sitting in the fridge a week. Do not use cheap whiskey though-well whiskey is fine you don't need Jameson's or anything but not the cheapest you can get either. Murphy's worked great. I gave this as a gift at christmas and have served it after several dinner parties-lots of compliments!

Good stuff, will use as Christmas gifts this year.  Pier I has nice red bottles to put it in.  I reduced the whiskey to 1 cup but may increase it a bit and did not put any almond.  I think it tastes better after sitting for a day.

All I can say is WOW!  I found this recipe and thought that it would make great Christmas gifts.  I had people over a couple of times this weekend and we couldn't help but drink it.  I made another batch with brandy instead of whiskey and it turned out to be soooo smooth.

This was a great homemade treat!  Looking to impress by going a little extra...this is the recipe to make for a pretty glass pitcher and after dinner drinks!  Yummy!  We also made shooters layered with white chocolate liquor and cherry juice!

This was so good. I made it for Thanksgiving weekend and it was a hit with everyone...even the guests that don't drink the "commercial" one. I did use only 1 1/2 cups of irish whiskey and half&half rather than whipping cream and it was excellent. Am going to mix some up for hostess gifts during the holiday season.

Very easy to make.  I cut back on the chocolate syrup to only 1 tbsp, and upped the coffee grandules to two tsps.  I also cut down on the whiskey to 1 cup.  

All in all a wonderful recipe, and wonderful for christmas gifts!

Very good, but Waaaaay tooo much Whiskey.  Cut the recipe down to 1 cup, or you wont be able to drink it.

YUMMMM!  Nice to find an Irish cream recipe that does not require raw egg.  I followed the modifications of another reviewer with my own shortcuts - e.g. 1/2 tsp. almond, 1-1/4 C Whiskey, used instant coffee & about 25 melted choc. chips in milk in the microwave then added to other ingredients in blender.  Perfect!  **using melted choc. chips is a more "real" chocolate flavor than the syrup and chips are usually on hand**  Thanks Mom and modgepodge for the recipe and suggested tweaks.

reply to KWATERS: 
those bottles are called "swingtop bottles". 
(specialtybottles.com) Please...I'm not spamming!
It's the only place I found them. Buy by the case of 12
and shipping costs are drastically cut.
AS FOR THIS RECIPE!!!! YUMMMMMMY!
This Irish Cream is an excellent recipe to suit to your individual taste! I made the recipe exactly to a "T" the first time. However, I've adapted it to better suit my tastes! The heavy cream left a "greasy" coating on my palate, so I use fat free half & half. 
2 Tb. less of condensed milk, 1 and 1/4 cups of whiskey, melted semi sweet choc. pieces instead of choc. syrup, and NO almond extract.
My amended recipe is smooth and creamy in texture, and I don't have the problem of the heavy cream clogging up the neck of my swingtop bottles! lol  For those of you having a "curdling" problem; Make sure your cream is FRESH! Also, blending it too long, will make "whipped cream" which will separate! I stir everything in a bowl with a whisk. THEN add the half & half LAST, stirring just until incorporated. 
I funnel it into the swingtop bottles.(label and date them). I've been making this Irish Cream for over 6 years now with RAVE reviews.
Countless times, I've given the original recipe  by, "Mom" (THANK YOU!) along with my improvised recipe, so that people may try both of them! One more thing, sipping this Irish Cream, right after making it, is NOT the way it will taste after 5-7 days in the refrigerator! The flavors MUST have time to meld. ENJOY!

Easy, yummy, great gift...I am not giving the full 5 stars simply because I did change it a little.  I reduced the whiskey for my taste and used half and half, which I also increased in the end as well.  Over all a great starting point that you can very easily tweak to your own taste.

Use Jameson's or Bushmill Irish Whiskey and cut it down to just over a cup. It's awesome! We make this every year and give it away to our friends for Christmas.

absolutely delicious, just like the way my mother made it!  It was a huge hit at my St Patrick's dinner party.  I used Crown Royal whiskey, which is a bit expensive (about $13 per batch) but it is extemely smooth and accents the flavor beautifully.

I've made this several times, as written, using skim milk and fat free condensed milk & using fat free half & half.  Every time it turned out great!!  I also reduced the whiskey to 1 cup.  Will make this over and over again!

This recipe is quite delicious. It's even better if you have time to let it sit in the fridge for a couple of weeks before serving it. I made it using Bushmill's and only added a cup. It still seemed a bit strong, but since I use my irish cream for mixing, I actually ended up adding about 1/3 cp more to the cup I had already put in the recipe. As a side note, please be careful not to blend the mix too long or you will end up with some very thick cream...take my word for it! VERY EASY to make!Thanx

This is the real thing! I served it to our guests after dinner on St. Paddy's day with
Irish Potato Candy. They were very impressed that I made it myself!
It's also delicious added to a cup of coffee.

Yum! I made this as a take-home gift for my holiday party. Ohhhh so good. I did split the almond extract into half and used coconut extract as the other half. I also split the heavy cream with 2% milk and used fat-free condensed milk. We loved it, I will definately make it again.

This mix is awesome!  I just served it at a holiday gathering.  They went through two batches in 1/2 hour!  Everyone wanted the recipe, and everyone thought it was far better than ... you know ... Bailey's.  Thanks, Mom!  I'm buying decanters to fill up and give out as gifts!

So good...and so easy!  It is best to let it sit for a few days before serving - the flavors blend together much better.  But inexpensive to make and tastes better than store bought.  Perfect for an addition to the holiday gift baskets!!

I made two batches using one cup of whiskey instead of almost two, and leaving out the almond extract altogether.  It was a huge hit among my friends during a ski weekend!  In the future, I'd use milk instead of cream, as it was very thick--almost like a mudlslide.  A definite winner!

This recipe turned out great. It was a bit strong at first but let it sit in the refrigerator for a week before giving it away or using. It allows for the flavors to blend better. It's not as strong when mixed into coffee. It tastes heavenly.

I made several batches of this for our Christmas 2007 party. I couldn't make enough of this.  Huge hit, will be a holiday tradition. Everyone said this was much better then Bailey's.  I did change the recipe to suit my tastes. I used 3/4 cup scotish wiskey, 1 cup of half and half, 3 tsp. of Kaluha in place of the coffee. 1-2 tsp. of Amaretto in place of the almond extract

Just the Christmas gift I was looking for! I guess we're just a little wimpier than some though - I cut the whiskey back to 1 1/4 cups, and served it over ice with a little milk added. This has replaced our traditional Bailey's!

I've made this recipe several times for Christmas gifts and it's always a HUGE hit!  For myself, because I don't like coffee, I leave out the instant coffee and double the chocolate syrup.  It makes a fabulous after dinner drink and a great addition to hot chocolate!

This is much better than Baileys and a whole lot cheaper.  Add this to a cup of coffee for a real treat!   As usual Mom knows best.  Thanks Mom!

Oh my!  I'm sitting here sipping this sinful thing trying hard not to chug it. I'm giving it 5 stars even tho I had to change it. I used half heavy cream and the rest was half and half. Only had 1-1/4 cups of Irish whiskey and used amarreto instead of almond extract. Also used a dark chocolate syrup and a decaf instant coffee. I added the instant coffee to the vanilla, amaretto and chocolate syrup and microwaved it for about 15 seconds to dissolve the coffee. Cooled it a bit then added to the blender with everything else. I might up the whiskey the next time. I know I will never buy the original again. I'm having another glass now.

Really good!!  I followed some other reviewer's advice and used 1/2 and 1/2 and I don't care for almond extract, so I omitted that.  My 11 year old daughter makes this all the time for our family.....(she wants to be a chef!) so I supervise and she does a great job!!  No need to judge.....LOL!  Great recipe, very tasty and so cheap to make!  Thanks for a fantastic post!

Very good but not the best I've had and we made it almost to the letter. The extracts sort of take away from the real cream flavor.... and we cut the almond extract in half but it was too much.  And there is too much Whiskey for our liking, so we did use less.  It is possible letting it sit for a while could help mellow the flavors?  

We decided to make another recipe the second time and found one using real melted milk chocolate and no extracts, and I have to say that was by far superior to this recipe.  Irish Cream Liqueur II is our favorite between the two from this site.  I also think using real melted milk chocolate helped because using the chocolate syrup just made it taste a bit off.  However, using the heavy cream is wonderful!  I think you must try it before you knock it.  That is what you're making after all... Irish CREAM... not Irish Milk.  So splurge and use the cream before you decide to change that ingredient.  You'll be happy you did.

Loved this.  Used vanilla 1/2 and 1/2.  Didn't have a blender since we were at a hotel and it stayed mixed just fine.  You do want to chill it well before drinking.  If you just poor warm over ice it gets too watered down.

WOW! Made this for the 1st time and was great. I made this drink as a hostest gift and she loved it. To all those looking at trying this, do not hesitate but be sure to look at alot of the suggestions as I did. Good suggestions were: Cut down whisky to 7oz, use 1 tbsp chocolate syrup and use 1/2 whipping cream 1/2 milk (found it still alittle thick), I also totally omitted the almond extract as a suggestion of someone else and thought it was great, you can always add it later if you want. This was so good I made a batch for myself to indulge in. I will definatly make this again.

Awsome drink!  My husband loves this; he says it is better than Bailey's.  I even made it low-fat with fat free half & half.  I did use slightly less whiskey too.

I used Jameson, reduced the whisky to 1 cup plus a splash, used 2/3 heavy cream and 1/3 whole milk, a shy tsp Starbucks instant coffee, and omitted the almond extract.  I did a side by side taste test with some Bailey's, and this recipe has the same flavor but but yet is altogether better because of the  real dairy and good whisky.  I am now ruined for Bailey's because this is so good.

This. Is. Awesome. Most of what I used in this recipe I bought at a discount grocery store on the cheap. I didn't have almond extract, so I used two tsp. of vanilla extract. I whipped everything together in my KitchenAid mixer, using my whipping tool. Very good. Very smooth. And has quite a kick. I won't ever buy pre-made irish cream ever again. Or I won't have to wait until Christmas to get homemade irish cream from my MIL's boyfriend. ;)

I made Rum Cream, instead of Irish Cream by replacing the wiskey with Bacardi Coco Rum.  It is excellent!  Next time I may omit the almond extract, everyone who has tasted it has commented on how "almondy" is tastes.  I will also try half and half instead of the heavy cream...it was really rich!  Overall, a keeper!  Who knew making expensive, famcy liqueurs was this simple?

This is an excellent recipe--being a baker and knowing the strength of almond extract I took the recommendation to use 1/2 tsp.  And also used half and half in place of cream.  Came out perfect.

I just tried this recipe last night and the only thing I did differently was use Canadian Whiskey as that was what I happen to have on hand. That being said, the end result tasted nothing like any Irish Cream that I've ever had. Side by side this recipe tasted totally disgusting actually.   I absolutely love Irish Cream so needless to say I was very disappointed.   What a waste of money!!! So unless it was all due to the type of whiskey I used, if you have your hopes up that it will taste as good as the real thing I wouldn't waste my money if I were you.

I did as the past reviewers said and made 2 changes: decreased the whiskey to 1 cup and (& I'm a hearty drinker) and used half and half instead of cream.  The heavy cream made it too thick! More like an egg nog.  I had 5 people try both w/ half and half and heavy cream... all liked the half and half better.(still thick enough)... the extra day in the fridge really melded the flavors!

I like this recipe very much, but like others, I find the original too strong, so I use about 3/4 to 1 cup of whiskey. I also find it a bit too sweet for my taste, so I cut the amount of sweetened condensed milk in half. To make up for the lack of volume, I use 1 and 1/4 cup of cream or half and half (I actually prefer half and half) and instead of instant coffee granules, I use 1/2 cup of strong brewed coffee. I also use only 1/8 tsp of almond extract along with 1/4 to 1/2 tsp of coconut extract. I realize this is a lot of 'amending' but with any recipe you tend to adapt it to your own tastes. I do really like that this recipe doesn't use raw eggs or that awful powdered coffee "creamer". I like to buy top shelf ingredients and I can do that with this recipe. Cheers!

Recipe, the way I know is to let sit in refrigerator for at least 2 weeks or up to a month before drinking it. The longer it sits the better it is, it mellows out.  The recipe I'm familiar with doesn't call for almond extract (which I think I would like, will have to try)and like others said you can sustitute the heavy cream for half and half or whole milk. Try making ahead and you will notice a BIG difference!

Honestly, if I could give this 10 stars I would..wouldn't ever buy from the store again. I saved two bottles from the Baileys and I just keep refilling them. One bottle of whiskey gets me three bottles of Irish Cream. I make as it says except I if I don't want a strong taste of whiskey I use 1 1/4 cup whiskey..if I want it a little stronger..I use 1/ 1/2 cups..personal I think 1 2/3 cup is way too much..other then that great recipe:)

Absolutely perfect.  We love this mixed with a little milk and vanilla ice-cream in a blender - our own "Bailey's" shakes.  Mmmmmm.

I made this for holiday gifts and bottled them in the Grolsh bottles w/ the ceramic lids.  I  decreased the almond extract to 1/2 tsp, used only 1c whiskey, and half & half in place of the  heavy cream.

We only had Bourbon Whiskey in the house.  I took the suggestion from others to decrease the amount of almond extract to 1/2 tsp, and that may still have been too much.  Wonderful recipe.  Put it in our Christmas baskets.  I had trouble finding inexpensive bottles to put it in, so I used canning jars.

Very good.  I also used regular cream and milk instead of the heavy cream.  Only complaint is that the coffee floats to the top.

I purchased a good and pricey Irish whiskey (Jamieson's) and went strictly by the recipe .  Tastes NOTHING like real Bailey's Irish Cream - find a different recipe...

I love this recipe!  And I have also done some doctoring; I add fresh brewed organic (Kicking Horse) coffee instead of the granules and real cocoa in place of the chocolate syrup.  Only because I would never have these items in the kitchen.

Delish!! I followed the recipe exactly. I think there may be a bit too much chocolate syrup to be exactly like Bailey's. I will cut back some next time...and there will be a next time! So thick and rich and delicious....YUM!

this stuff was really good. my family loves Bailey's (we're irish afterall), and this stuff was a hit. i went easy on the almond extract, as the reviews suggested...however, i went heavy on the jameson, cause that's how my family rolls. i might try it again with less chocolate and use half & half instead of heavy cream... it was VERY thick. not sure if i would let it sit overnight, my dad said it was better freshly blended. great recipe, will make it again for holiday gifts :)

This is the best! I never dreamed you could make this homemade. I used Nestle's table cream. I did not use the almond extract. A little extra vanilla. Thanks so much for the recipe!

Fabulous with changes:

Use half and half instead of cream and cheap whiskey and brandy blend instead of Irish whiskey.  Also reduced booze to 3/4 C (too strong at 1 2/3 C). 

Have made it for Xmas gifts last three years.  Huge raves.

Super yummy!  I also used 1/2 & 1/2, my husband said, "Yea-now we don't have to spend all that money.  We could pour this in the other bottle and nobody would know the difference."  I'm not so sure it tastes exactly the same, but its close enough for us.  We'll definitely make this again.

I followed the suggestions and used half and half, cut the whiskey to 1 cup and used 1/2 tsp. of almond. It was beyond good!! We had a lot of whiskey in the house and never drank it, I am sure that will change.

Wow. I will not be buying $25 bottles of brand name Irish cream ever again. This was so easy. I eliminated the almond extract altogether. And I decreased the whiskey to 1 cup. I also used fat free half and half instead of heavy cream. Yum!

Fantastic!  I took the advice of many other reviewers, and reduced the whisky to 1 cup, changed the instant coffee to kaluha, and used half and half instead  of heavy cream.  This was very, very good, especially when well chilled.  Has anyone used Amaretto in place of the almond extract?  That's the only other suggestion I have to potentially improve a great recipe.  Thanks for sharing, Mom!

I made this on Christmas Eve.  It's sooooo good!  After reading the reviews I made the following changes: 1/2 c. heavy cream and 1/2 c. milk instead of 1 c. heavy cream, 1/2 tsp almond extract instead of 1 tsp, & 1 1/3 c. Tullamore Dew Irish Whiskey instead of 1 2/3 c. Awesome recipe!

I actually printed out this recipe last Christmas and never made it.  I did get a chance to make it for this Christmas because my husband loves Bailey's Irish Cream.  He couldn't wait to taste it.  He said it was very good, but thought the almond extract was a little overbearing.  I'm going to make another batch without the almond and mix it with the previous batch. Hopefully, this will be a good mix.  Thanks for the recipe.

My husband LOVES Baileys so I thought I would give this a try and he really likes it.  So easy to make and so much cheaper than the real thing!  I used low fat sweetened condensed milk, and did not add any almond flavouring.  Other than that I did not change anything else.  So good, I will make this again!

I have been making this for the Christmas holidays for many years. I don't use 1 cup of heavy cream. I use 1/2 up heavy cream and 1 to 1 1/2 cups fat free half and half. I also cut almond extract to 1/2 teaspoon. Using fat free half and half helps keep calories down a little, especially during a season of rich foods and drinks. I have not used skim milk as I like a creamier version. I usually use 1 1/2 cups of Black Velvet. Works great.

The first time I made this I made it exact by the recipe (only using 1/2 & 1/2 instead of heavy cream) and just FYI, used Jameson Irish Whiskey. It was very good, and there were no complaints. But I thought the almond flavoring threw it off a bit. The second time I left out the almond flavoring altogether and doubled the vanilla. It was an EXACT replica of Baliley's. Maybe even better!

I have been making this for years and years and always get rave reviews. I do not add the coffee (personal preference)and heavy cream is not always available where I live so I have always used evaporated milk. The one thing I do not do is put the whiskey in the blender with the other ingredients. There is an old saying "do not bruise the booze". I add it at the end and stir by hand. You cannot go wrong with this recipe.

I'm going to sum it up by saying, just like with anything you make in your kitchen (or in this case bar), you should tailor it to suit your preferences. To make this recipe PERFECT TO YOU, start with 3/4 can of condensed milk, 1 cup of whisk(e)y, half the chocolate, half the coffee and half the almond extract.  Taste and add more to suit to your liking.  Remember, YOU CAN ALWAYS ADD MORE BUT CAN'T TAKE AWAY.  Personally, I used all the condensed milk, 1 cup whiskey, more coffee granules than called for (taste can vary by brand, too), half the chocolate syrup, and all of the almond extract, plus a little splash of 2% milk.  I didn't bother with the blender, just used my large whisk and stirred it up right in the pitcher.  Let's just say the recipe submitter would make a VERY popular bartender with the full 1 2/3 cups of whiskey! But hey, maybe I'm a lightweight ;)  Thanks for the GREAT suit-to-one's-liking recipe!  And for those who mentioned that it doesn't taste like Bailey's: like I said this recipe is perfect to alter HOWEVER YOU LIKE!  Or just go buy the darn bottle of Bailey's already.

When I first made this, I couldn't find almond extract so I didn't use it.  I also used light cream instead of heavy cream and a small amount of brewed coffee instead of instant.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious! It tasted very much like Baileys except the real cream was far more indulgent (the real Baileys does not have cream otherwise it wouldn't be sitting out on an unrefrigerated liquor store shelf with no expiration date).

The cost though is calories.  The real problem is the sweetened condensed milk (that little can has 1,300 calories).  Even 1 cup of the heavy cream only adds 800 calories.  Bottom line, you are looking at about 500 calories per each 5 oz serving in this recipe.

Based on all the reviews I came up with: 1 cup half and half, 1 can of sweetened condensed milk, 1 cup of Irish Whiskey, 1 teaspoon instant coffee, 2 tablespoons chocolate syrup and 2 teaspoon vanilla. Perfect. So glad I swapped out the heavy cream for 1/2 and 1/2. The heavy cream would have been to thick for my liking. And I don't like almond extract so I just doubled the vanilla.

I started off with 1/2 the Irish Whiskey and half the Almond Extract.  It was good, but still too much Almond.  I would make it again with no Almond Extract.  Make it without first and add 1/8 tsp. at a time if you really want to include it.  Bailey's Irish cream has no Almond flavor.

While definitely stronger and with less a hint of butterscotch than Bailey's (tasted side by side), this is an excellent recipe for fun & easy gift-giving. The whiskey really comes to the front when mixed with coffee, but best when sipped over ice. Multiple Christmas gatherings were brightened by repeated samplings.

I have had homemade Irish cream before and it was wonderful.  I made the recipe exactly as written.  It was undrinkable and nothing like Baileys. I should have read the reviews, I would have realized that just about everyone who gave it 5 stars changed the recipe.

I have made this for several years.  I use light cream instead of heavy and it is perfect.  I prefer a little lighter/thinner cocktail! Cheers

I followed the substitutions posted here, used half and half instead of heavy cream, decreased to 1/2 teaspoon almond extract and decreased the whiskey to 7 oz.  It was perfect!

I have been making this recipe for several years now. It has become expected that I will make it for all holiday gatherings. It makes a great gift. Every year I make larger and larger batches to satisfy the demand. I have learned to use only half the almond extract and I increase the vanilla. I prefer the taste. Also, I increase by half the instant coffee and I like using dark chocolate syrup instead of the regular. One nice twist on this recipe is to add peppermint schnapps to taste. The mocha/mint flavor is fantastic! No matter what little tweaks you make to this recipe, it is a BIG WINNER... Try it!

I've made this several times now with great success. Everyone is amazed that you can make something this good at home. My only adaptations are that I cut the almond extract by half and I subbed fat-free half & half for the whipping cream. The texture was just too thick with the cream. Another thing to note: I used cheap $5/pint Canadian whiskey and it still tasted fabulous. Don't bother splurging on the expensive stuff for this. It will be just fine without it.

SOOO yummy!  I tweaked it a bit and think it tastes as good (or better) than the real thing.  I used 2% milk instead of the heavy cream and this makes it less thick but just as smooth.  I also substituted 1/2 tsp of malibu coconut rum and 1/2 tsp of disaronno for the 1 tsp of almond extract given in the recipe.  It doesn't get much better!!

Delicious and SO easy!  I did not use the blender for this and followed the recommendations of others and used 1/4 tsp of Almond Extract.  Used Light Cream and Canadian Whiskey.  Melted chocolate chips mixed with a little Kahlua replaced the instant coffee and choco syrup.  Who on earth uses instant coffee anyway?  I will definitly make this again!

Super easy to make and very good. I did not realize I was out of Jamesons so I used Gentleman Jack, still whiskey, right? I omitted the almond extract since there was so many comments stating that the almond flavor was overpowering. Next time I will try it using Jamesons.

The other raters are correct - as is, it is too strong.  I made it twice.  The 2nd time I used 1.5 cup of heavy cream and 1/2 cup half and half (same amt of Jameson Irish whiskey).  I also only used a scant 1/8 teas of almond extract.  Still plenty strong enough, and over ice... yummmm!

Wow!! So easy and so delicious!!  I did find it a little heavy on the almond flavour.  Next time I will likely only use half a teaspoon.

LOVE this!  Thanks so much for this recipe.  Just made this for Christmas gifts! And in this season celebrating love and plenty, I used 2 pints whipping cream/heavy cream, one 750 ml bottle of "good" Irish Whiskey (Jamesons), 6 cans sweetened condensed milk and the called for amounts of coffee, chocolate syrup and real vanilla (not artificial). I omitted the almond extract which I have a personal dislike for - If a recipe calls for almond flavoring, I use the real thing somehow.  

Made this in my blender in batches, doubling it each time.   The above amounts of liquid will fill 11 and a half Ball/Kerr pint canning jars.  I printed out a pretty label "Homemade for you from ____" and put a sticky bow on the lid.  Refrigerating the jars in the box they came in until I deliver them individually.  I'm keeping the half jar for myself!

5 stars aren't NEARLY enough!  I loved the fact that:"will keep 2 months in the refrigerator".  HA!!  If you don't want to splurge on real Irish whiskey, just use any bourbon or blended whiskey you have on hand.  Divine stuff!

This was quite good and I liked better than my mom's recipe with raw eggs. I did follow a couple earlier recommendations of half and half instead of cream and reduced whiskey to 1 cup as recommended. You can still really taste the whiskey, and I am a whiskey drinker. You can always add more, but you can't take it out if there if it is too much for your taste. Enjoy!

Wow...This is so good!!  I did use half N half in place of the heavy cream, and cut the almond flavoring to 1/4 tsp, otherwise everything else to the T.  Just made a double batch again today.  I like this with a little coffee and lots of ice.  Thanks for sharing your recipe Mom!!

Very yummy! Instead of 1 c. heavy cream, I used 3/4 c. heavy cream and 1/4 c. 1% milk. Used The Irishman Irish Whiskey and reduced amt. used to 1 c. Also reduced the almond extract to 1/2 tsp. Mixed it with the emulsion blender and slowly poured the whiskey in to prevent curdling. Let develop overnight. So good!!

Perfect!  This is my favorite Irish Cream recipe!!  But I do usually add extra whiskey and chocolate syrup.  I don't typically have instant coffee in the house, so I just pour in some leftover coffee from the morning.

I make this recipe every St. Pats but I make it Fat Free. To make the FF version just change the heavy cream to FF half and half, and use FF condensed milk. It's not low sugar, but it's fat free, and you'll never know the difference!

Fantastic!!!!  Absolutely delicious.  I make a ton of this to bring to friends and families houses for holiday parties.  Everyone loves it!  I cut down a little on the almond extract, otherwise the almond flavor is a bit too strong for my taste.  Also, the full amount of whiskey will make it VERY strong.  Adjust according to your taste...I usually use 1 cup.  Add a tiny bit of peppermint extract for mint Irish Cream.  Yummmm!

An OMG IS THIS GOOD Recipe.  I did cut the whiskey down to 1 cup and used coconut extract instead of almond as suggested by another reviewer.  I made this for a bunch of people that are not whiskey drinkers and they went ga ga for it.  For something less cloying, we also mixed it in a 1 to 1 ratio with strong hot coffee for something totally out of this world on a cold day.

Following the advice of some of the reviewers, I reduced the almond extract to 1/2 teaspoon in my first batch and still the almond flavor overpowered the entire drink.  I made another batch today and I eliminated the almond extract and now it tastes fantastic!  Per our personal tastes, I also increased the chocolate syrup to 3 tablespoons and the vanilla to 1.5 teaspoons as well as mixed in a little skim milk as we prefer it to be less thick.

Awesome! I gave small bottles of this away at Christmas and everyone loved it. I used light cream and low fat sweetened condensed milk and it still tasted great. Next time I'll dissolve the coffee granules in a tiny bit of warm water. They didn't like trying to dissolve in the cold.

Baileys is no longer welcome in our house. This is the best tasting Irish cream I have ever had. Its sweet and it does have a kick. A really great holiday drink. We enjoyed it, thanx.

I made this for Christmas gifts last year and also for our use.  What a great recipe and so easy!  I have no idea how long it will last in the refrigerator because it doesn't last long around our house.

This is a very good base recipe, but for those who have trouble with the sweetness (like my family), cut the chocolate syrup in 1/2 and use about 1/4 less condensed milk.  you can increase the cream (we used half and half) to compensate for the less condensed milk. We also found it way too strong, so we reduced the wiskey to 1/2 or 1/3 cup.  I also recommend using the blender to ensure all ingredients are mixed well.

Very good, I'm not really a fan of Bailey's but I had to try it before I give it out as gifts.  I used half & half and 1 cup of canadian whiskey but everything else I left the same.  I think this has more of a chocolate taste and less "bite" which is probably why I like it better

I took others advice and used half and half rather than the heavy cream and I'm so glad I did. It was still a bit rich but good. I reduced the whisky to 3/4 cup and wish I would have cut it a bit more as it was quite strong. Definitely warms you up.

I gave bottle of this out as presents this year, and I received many compliments.  I've had several people ask me for the recipe.  I only used 1 and a third cups of whiskey in most of the batches, and in others I substituted some of the whiskey for creme de cacao.  All turned out delicious.  I think I've found a new home-made gift to give a lot of family and friends.

Sorry - I usually don't give one star - but this was a fail in my opinion.  Far to liquid - none of the "thickness" that you feel when you drink Baileys.  Also - far too much whiskey - Baileys is in no way this overpowering. I will save it and see if I can use it in other recipes - like a pound cake or ice cream recipe.  If you want Baileys - just buy it.

So here's what I did  I substituted the whiskey for Spiced Rum and used 1-1/3 c.  I used 30% cream. The rest I did per the recipe.  It's actually very tasty.  My only problem is that the cream kind of lumped together at the top rather than blending in.  When I poured it in, it was smooth.  When blended, I had floating little clumps of the cream.  Anyway, as I said, very tasty.  Just doesn't look like it should.

I've been using this recipe for many years. It's very easy and extremely delicious. So many variations, adjust ingredients to suit you.  You can use any type of alcohol, more or less chocolate or coffee. I always use can milk instead of heavy cream. Enjoy! It won't last long, too good to leave sitting around.       Katie G-S

overall it was fine.
the cons:
- whisky was too much, it turned out too strong
- I am not new in cooking but followed the instruction to beat all in high speed - ended up with cream which turned to almost butter / separated mass
- ended up straining - heating that mass a bit to make smooth and back to save all invested products
- so every time before serving I had to shake the bottle for some minutes
- this was impossible to add to coffee as the cream was bitten to butter and ended up being a fat in coffee 

cons
still the taste was good
will make again half portion, but will use less whiskey and will mix the only cream after all the ingredients are incorporated

This recipe after some adjustment is real close to Applebee's white russian. Just add a scoop of vanilla ice cream and some whip cream on top and "ENJOY".

I used 1/2 cup heavy cream and 1/2 cup half & half. Only a drop of almond extract and cut the choclate down in half. Use only Jameson Irish whiskey and cut that down 1/3 cup. This is my third batch and I think I nailed it.The recipe calls for way too much almond.

This is a great recipe.  I gave this as gifts for Christmas.  Buy a decorative bottle to make a nice gift basket or use a small mason jar that fits nicely into a mug, put a bow on top and you're done.  I also made a batch of Caramel Cream by substituting the whiskey with Caramel Vodka and the chocolate syrup with caramel syrup and omit the almond extract.  It was awesome!

This is an excellent recipe.  For the person who has problems with the separation, all you have to do is shake the container when you serve it.  That way you won't lose any of this wonderful concoction.

I just made this and it is fabulous! I cut back on the Jameson and almond extract,( 1 cup wiskey,1/2 tsp. of almond) Plenty strong with these changes Next time I'll us a less expencive Irish wiskey but I'll keep everything else the same.I can't wait for it to rest overnight in the fridge and try it in my coffee.

I think this is great! It's a little to sweet for my taste so I think the next time I make it I will use only half the sweetened condensed milk. :)

Way too much Almond flavor! I would cut it back to 1/2 tsp almond extract and maybe take down the vanilla a bit too. It was overwhelming. Also, the chocolate syrup was a little too heavy, try 1 tbs first and then add the 2nd if you like it.

Eased up a little on the Irish whiskey based on others' reviews and used instant espresso instead of coffee.  Everyone who tried it loved it.  Great recipe!

What a great, easy, treat! I made it for Christmas gifts and my friends really enjoyed it. I took the suggestions of other reviewers and took the whiskey down to 1 cup (Canandian Mist, blasphemy but much easier on the wallet). I also cut the heavy cream with milk, 1/2 cup of each.

Do not change the recipe!  Best as is!  Make it a few days ahead of time.   Even better after it sits a while in the fridge!  Just made it (again) this evening, will be perfect in time for Christmas! AND, I highly recommend Tullamore Dew... the best!

I substituted 1/2 cup heavy cream plus 1/2 cup light cream for a slightly lighter consistency. Used only 2/3 cup whiskey, and 4-5 drops of almond extract. No matter what it's yummy, just a matter of personal taste. Mix whiskey and sw. condensed milk FIRST, and then add the cream, or it will curdle.

Exceptional!  Definitely a gift giver... 2 for me, 1 for you!  It's a little strong if you drink it straight, in coffee it's perfect. The other reviewers who change the quantities must drink it straight.  With coffee or milk 5 stars!!!!

This recipe was fantastic! We took the suggestion of withholding the almond extract. Not having any instant coffee we just made a strong pot of coffee and used 3/4 cup and it worked great! we will be looking foward to making this treat every holiday season :)

I have made this with heavy cream and half and half. I like the half and half better, cream seems to curdle. I have made it with Irish whisky and Canadian and Canadian is just as good for half the price. I only use 2/3 cup of whisky, 1 cup is just waaaay too overwhelming

used Canadian whisky...Used blender to mix. At the end there was a cheese-like curd at the top. Thought the Carnation or cream had 'turned' but the "best before" on both was fine??? Had to pull it out leaving the drink lacking in creaminess. Also, following the recipe - it's extremely strong?
Tried it a 2nd time - without using a high speed blender - that was the cause of the cream 'curd'. Used less whiskey - much better and closer to Bailey's - without the 'curd'.

I decreased the whiskey to 1 cup and replaced the almond extract with chocolate extract. YUM! I also added 1/4 tsp. of peppermint extract to this as I love the mint chocolate baileys. This is an excellent recipe and I encourage others to try it and do your own thing to match your tastes.

The first time I made this recipe I didn't have any almond extract.  I added 1/2 tsp more vanilla and 1/4 tsp coconut extract as someone else had suggested.  It came out beautiful-everyone who tried it LOVED it--5 stars.  After picking up some almond extract I decided to make another batch strictly using the recipe.  WAAAYY too much almond!  It's all I could taste.  Even when I added just a little bit of this cream to my coffee the almond flavor was overpowering.  Cut back the almond to 1/4 tsp at most or substitute something else if you plan on making this.

Re-rate:  What a difference a day makes!  The day I made this drink, the taste was wonderful!  The flavors of the chocolate and creams were the perfect compliment to the vodka.  The formula seemed just right.  After one week, the vodka had overpowered the drink making it too strong (it burned my insides!) and unappealing.  I revisited the blender and added more of the non-alcohol ingredients, and the smoothness and "Original Irish Creme" flavor returned.  I can't imagine this could be stored for 2 months... we'll see...

Excellent stuff. I used my best friend Jack, and whipping cream; followed the measurements exactly. The only change I made was to use Nesquick powder, since we don't keep 'chocolate syrup' in the house. Mmm. I barely had enough to share with guests!

This is really awesome, but I'd like to say that the next time I make this I will use 1/2 & 1/2 instead of heavy cream and only 1/2 tsp almond extract.
I did just that this weekend and it is absolutely perfect.  The heavy cream was just a little too much for me and even though I love the taste of almond extract (why don't almonds tast like that?) cutting that back to 1/2 teaspoon was perfect.
Thanks for this great (and much more affordable) recipe!

Delicious. Very thick! I think real coffee made this taste even better. I used 1/2 cup of strong coffee (espresso). I cut down on the whiskey to 1 cup. Also on the almond extract- to 1/2 t. It definitely would have been too strong.

I made this using Crown Royal which is a high end Canadian whiskey so obviously, it was very good.  I took two batches to Thanksgiving and it was gone within the hour.  My husband didn't quite appreciate that I used the good whiskey  so I will try next time with a different brand.

This is a great recipe, I thought the flavors were balanced and all of these ingredients are pretty easy to keep on hand.  I made mine with a cheap Canadian whiskey and it turned out great.  I chose to use 1/2 and 1/2 instead of heavy cream.  Even better after it aged in the fridge for a week.  It was hard to find cute small bottles to give as gifts, so I put some in mason jars.  I also found some cute small glass cruets at Walmart for smaller gift portions.  A fun recipe to give as a gift.....and we also enjoyed our own cocktails over shaved ice with a splash of extra milk.  YUM!

Delicious! Strong whiskey flavour, so if you want it less potent, cut back on the whiskey a little. We love it the way it is though!

Yummy! I'm giving four stars because of the amount of whiskey called for (I used a premium irish whiskey...Michael Collins Blend) . I cut it down to 1 cup & after taste-testing thought it was still a bit strong so I added about 1/2 cup or so more cream. It mellowed quite a bit overnight though & on the second batch (I gave away all of the first) I didn't add additional cream. I used half cream & half 2% organic milk but on the second batch, I did a 3 to 1 ratio of cream vs milk. I also decreased the almond extract by half per reviews. Thansk for a wonderful recipe!

I've made this recipes many times since we all love a splash of Bailey's in our coffee. Tastes just like the real thing with a bit more of a kick.

This is an absolute yummy recipe for irish cream. I made this recipe for family and friends last christmas holiday, the taste is so rich, creamy, and so easy to make. The author of this recipe says it can keep for 2 months in the frige, but when I make it, it is gone way before that!

Be careful when blending this recipe...heavy cream will become lumpy if blended too long. I prefer to whisk it by hand to avoid any chance of lumps. I also find it very strong, so I generally reduce the alcohol by about 1/4. Over all an excellent recipe. I make it every year at Christmas.

Really, really good recipe.  I will never buy Bailey's again.  This recipe is adaptable.  The called for amount of whiskey is fairly strong tasting but some people like that.  The comment I received over and over was that my friends liked the fact that it wasn't as sweet as Bailey's.  I am also planning on making a batch with 1 cup of Jameson and 1/2 cup of hazlenut liquer.  I can't wait!  Update: I have made many times over with 1 cup whiskey and 2/3 cup hazlenut.  It is amazingly good!

EVERYONE raved about the recipe. We were unsure of the amount of whiskey, because 1 2/3 Cups tasted seemed strong.  My computer recipe programs at home ask for an amount, so I translated it as One 2/3 Cup Irish whiskey, my husband thought 1 2/3 Cup. In the end the diluted was better. Can't say how much we settled on though.

If you blend it all together the cream will separate. Instead, blend everything but the cream first and stir the cream in after.

I had been hoping that it would be something akin to Bailey's and I was disappointed. Now, having said that, it's not too bad for a cream-liquor drink and I will probably make it again (with some modifications).

I followed the recipe exactly except that I doubled everything in order to fill one of my 1/2 gallon growlers. Doubling everything makes a little more than a 1/2 gallon. Also, I used an entire 750ml (25 oz) bottle of Jameson Irish Whiskey so 1 2/3 C of whiskey was off just a small amount (.0975oz).

As written, this recipe is 3-stars (OK). When I make it again, I will be cutting the amount of chocolate syrup in half. I'm not a huge chocolate milk fan and this recipe was too much like chocolate milk for my liking. Other than that, I will keep everything else the same. Unlike many, I didn't find the almond extract overpowering nor the amount of whiskey too strong; but to each his/her own. I would suggest trying it as written first... then decide on what adjustments need to be implemented. Don't assume that because someone else says that "... its too strong..." that you will find it to be true for you.

OMG, this is the most delicious thing I ever drank! It's so additive I had to stop making it so often, I put on a couple pounds after discovering this fabulous recipe.  I have made it numerous times, as posted, and tweaked various ways.  As posted is hands down the best, with the only exception being that it was too strong for me.  I didn't want a "shooter" I wanted something to sip.  I did cut back on the amount of whiskey, but it's too good to sip.  I usually slurp it down.  Thank you mom!

This recipe is very similar to the one in the Eagle Condensed Milk cookbook. Except that one includes eggs. Without the eggs, it's a little thin (pasteurized eggs eliminates the threat of salmonella). As written, beware- it is very strong!

Yum-- but very strong.  I used half the whiskey (Jamiesons) and it was still potent, but ridiculously yummy.  I made a large amount and gave it away as Christmas presents.

As is this is quite good, with a good kick. On my second batch I increased the coffee to 1 tbsp, and decreased the chocolate to 1.5 tbsp, which was certainly more to my taste. Easy and delicious.

I mixed triple recipe and used some of it to fill 3 16oz bottles that were shaped like Christmas trees, put a $20 bill in a ribbon tied around the neck of each bottle and gave them as gifts to three adult grandchildren - with warning to never drink and drive - to use the $20 to call a taxi if necessary.  The remaining cream was put in a "mason jar" (sort of an upscale moonshine?)and taken to a family/friends party and, after dinner it was served in small liqueur glasses.  Everyone loved it!

Yum! This is delicious! And my friends have devoured it! Per some reviewers suggestions, I did 1/2 heavy cream & 1/2 half 'n half, cut the almond extract to 1/2 tsp and added 1/2 tsp coconut extract. You can really adjust the whiskey (I used Bushmill's) to suit your tastes. For us, we decided about 1 1/2 cups was perfect. Thanks for the recipe - I'm off to make more now!

This was great and easy.  I've made Irish Cream for coworkers (20-40 so I make many batches!) for several years as a holiday gift, first year using this recipe. I did modify by using 1.5 c whiskey and a little less than a teaspoon of almond based on other reviews.  

I also made a batch with brandy instead of whiskey because I have two gluten-free coworkers - apparently some whiskeys are not gluten free.  I prefer whiskey but the brandy is really good, too.  (I received an email reply from E&J that their brandy is for sure gluten-free.)

My tips if you make larger quantities:
~ You can make two batches at a time in a Ninja blender (love that thing).
~ Measure out the first recipe and add a piece of tape to the outside for the cream height, add the whiskey and another piece of tape - after that you don't have to measure those separately in a measuring cup as long as you always add them first.  The Ninja jar is accurate but only without the mixing piece in it and I didn't want to keep taking it in and out.  
~ Bottle in mason jars - you can buy great bottles with a cap at IKEA but they're $4/each and pretty big - I'm too lazy to make that many batches!  If you have the enthusiasm and the cost isn't prohibitive, this would be nice - they can reuse the bottle.
~ When I made for less people I used the big mason jars but the pint are fine - this is pretty strong so it's not like people need a huge jar!  :)

I did a little tweaking of this recipe.  Cut down on the chocolate syrup, almond flavoring and whiskey.  It's wonderful! Can't wait to serve it to friends and family for the holidays.

I have been making this for over 30 years. (Have never used almond flavoring). Have used half & half & works fine.   KEEP REFRIGERATED. I always use good Irish whiskey.  Have kept for over a year in fridge.  Good in coffee too.

This recipe kicks balls.  No need to reduce anything.  I doesn't taste like commercial stuff-it's better and "real".  I make it every year to go along with a home brewed stout for carbombs.

I do a lot of baking and home-made gifts. Last year I was looking into the perfect Irish Cream to make and came across this recipe. I love it, very easy to follow. The taste is wonderful and my friends and family that I gave this to were also very happy with it. Thank you!!

If I had used the recommended amount of whiskey, I doubt this would even have been drinkable.  I used 3/4 cup of whiskey and still need to add an extra amount of the other ingredients (half the original amount).  The result was good, but more like a mudslide than baileys.

Excellent! The condensed milk overpowered the other flavors at first but after a night in the fridge everything blended. Tastes just like it's supposed to! The texture is far creamier than the original so when we make it again we will use half and half. I used homemade vanilla extract, homemade chocolate syrup and homemade sweetened condensed milk in this with excellent results. Very frugal when compared to Bailey's!

Yep.  It's pretty great.  Everyone loves it.  I've made it three times now.  First time followed the recipe to a tee, and it was yummy.  Found Irish Whiskey to be too expensive (and I'm doing this to save money), so next time I used St. Remy's brandy.  That was even better!  This last time all I had was cheap vodka, so I used it and even that is delicious in this recipe.  All in all a total win.  My suggestion though is try it with brandy, you'll be glad you did.

I have made this recipe several times. The first time, I listened to other reviewers and altered the recipe, it was good. the next time ( and every time since) I followed it exactly and was very happy and impressed. If you like Bailey's, then you will like this recipe as-is. I'm enjoying a glass right now!

I made with heavy cream once then half and half instead the second time. Preferred the half and half. Will reduce almond extract a little nexttime, but it's pretty perfect! Now I use 1/4 teas almond extract, 1 &1/3 cup Irish whiskey, and half and half instead I'd cream. It's delicious!

This was Awesome... I used coconut extract, not the almond, and I didn't have whipping cream, I used 2% milk. I think next time I'll use half and half. I also used too much choclate syrup, so my first batch was pretty dark. It tastes just like baileys irish cream. So good!

This is amazingly yummy. I used half the coffee, 1 cup whiskey and a half tsp of coconut extract instead of almond. I also used half and half  instead of whipping cream. It was plenty creamy.

I liked it, but had to double up the recipe(that's why I gave it a 3 star only). The amount of whiskey was too much for my taste.
The rating should be on the recipe the way it is written not on what you made out of it...

This was FANTASTIC!!!! I took some other reviewers' advice and only used 1 cup of whiskey (which was perfect), and also, I replaced the almond extract with coconut extract. Mmmmm, just like Bailey's! We usually have whiskey on hand (as well as all the other ingredients), so this, to me, is way better than having to go buy yet another bottle of liquor, and the best part is that I made it myself! Thanks for sharing. :)

I had misplaced my recipe for Irish Cream and thought that I would try this one. It is good but I have tasted better. I would omit the almond next time and that may be enough to give it 5 stars. I like this recipe as it does not have eggs in it like many others do.

I too made with fat free half and half and fat free sweetened condensed milk, plus only 1 cup whiskey.  My husband, who before I made it said that he would buy the name brand anyway, ended up asking me to make multiple batches and he never bought the "real" thing.  Made for a merry Christmas indeed.

To help with fat content a little I use half n half instead of heavy cream. It still tastes thick and rich. Excellent recipe!

Wow...great Irish Cream.  I've tried homemade Irish Cream twice before but both recipes had raw eggs in them...it kind of always grossed me out, so I was really excited to see this recipe.  I put only 1 cup of Canadian Whiskey as well as halved the almond extract.  So far, it tastes great...and it hasn't even had time to refrigerate!  Thanks for the great recipe.

This has to be the best yet.  I took the advice of some of the people...little less whiskey and less almond extract, as well as not skimping on the heavy cream.  I have gotten rave reviews.  Look forward to having this at our upcoming 4th of July party!

Wow- first batch lasted 4 days- made without the almond extract.  The whiskey needs to mellow for a day or two before first use.  Very glad I tried this recipe- easy to make and will save me some money.  I used Jamesons whiskey.

I followed this recipe - but changed a few things to cut back on fat and cals.  I changed the heavy cream for skim milk, used 1 cup of Canadian Mist instead of Irish Whiskey, and 1/4 tspn. of almond extract as other members have suggested.  Needless to say - it was sssooo good - we re making it again tomorrow.

This tastes like an iced mocha with whisky.  It doesn't taste like Bailey's Irish Cream.  It might taste like traditional irish cream, but since I usually drink Baileys, that's what my taste buds were looking for.
I am going to try this recipe with no coffee, no chocolate, and way less almond and vanilla.  The coffee and chocolate probably give it a nice color, but I'd rather have white Irish Cream than an alcoholic mocha.

I made this recipe with true Irish Whiskey, because many years ago, I made a recipe similar to this using regular Canadian Whiskey and my husband never felt it match Baily's...now he gave this recipe a 10.  The reviews some said 10% cream(half and half) was to light, yet full 35% whip cream was to thick.  I did 3/4 cup of 10% (half and half) and 1/4 cup of heavy cream, plus 25 dark chocolate chipetts, melted.  And for my taste 7 oz of Irish Whiskey. We have already made 2 batches for over the holidays.  Enjoy...

This is the one!  As others before me have done, make this as written and alter to your tastes if necessary.  Don't leave anything out, if possible.  I really like that there are no eggs in this recipe and I can always keep the ingredients handy for the next batch.    In a side by side comparison test, you can taste the difference between this version and the "Real" version but it stands alone beautifully and goes down easily, just like the real thing. Mmmmm.

This is AWESOME. I'm a big fan of Bailey's and thought it'd be great to bottle an original blend for Christmas gifts. I found glass bottles with a stopper you can reuse over and over (not a cork) at The Container Store for $5 and then made up batches for friends.  When made with all heavy cream, it's good but it's so thick I found myself adding milk to my glass when I poured some to drink.  So I altered the cream in the recipe to using part heavy cream and part milk. Also, I think instant coffee is a crime against nature and couldn't see buying a whole container for such a small amount needed here so instead I used 2 Tbsps Kahlua. Since that's liqeur, I dropped the whiskey down to 1 cup and it tastes great, not to mention still being pretty strong. Definitely worth making and tweaking to your own tastes!

Wow! Easy recipe to make ahead and to keep pouring.... everyone raved about it at a neighborhood party.  I used only about 1 cup of whiskey and thought it was strong enough for the first batch ;)

Great stuff!  I made a batch on Saturday and my 2 sisters-in-law drank it all on Saturday night!  I am going to make more for the holidays.  Didn't have any almond extract and I don't think we missed it.

I made this recipe for a gift exchange and for the holidays and everyone loved it.  Personally I thought the drink was a little strong but I was the only one.  I also served this at a St. Patrick's Day party in shot glasses made of chocolate and it was a big hit I should have made more.

Tasted almost like St. Brendan's and cost WAY less.  The only problem my husband and I has was it didn't need the almond.  It threw the taste off a bit, but wasn't bad.  I just would leave it out next time.

I made this to give as host/hostess gifts last holiday season and all who received it raved!  So this will definitely become a part of the goodie bags/boxes we give for the holidays.  Sometimes we make this with just a touch of coconut extract, too.

This was so easy to make and SO much cheaper than buying a bottle of Bailey's.  I used a Canadian Whiskey and only put in 1-1/2 cups.  It's really strong, so next time I'll reduce the whiskey some more.  I used fat free half and half and it tastes delicious - - you won't miss the fat from the heavy cream.  (For company, though, I'll probably use heavy cream!)  Wonderful recipe!

Definately better than the store bought. You control amount of whiskey you use and the quality. The better the brand of whiskey the better the flavor of the irish cream. I prefer a Canadian whiskey to the Irish whiskey. I think it gives it a smoother taste. Whatever you use you will not want the store bought version any longer.

One word:  YUM.  We substituted fat free Land O'lakes half and half for the heavy cream to make it a bit healthier.  You won't miss the heavy stuff at all.

I tried this irish cream recipe because it doesn't require eggs. I did lesson the whiskey ratio so it would be less strong. I used 1 cup of whisky instead, and found the taste to be just perfect and not extremely strong. The recipe is easy to adjust to your liking. Sometimes I add a little more coffee or a little more choc syrup. Tastes great in coffee! I did, however, notice a slight separation of the mixture in the fridge. Maybe I don't mix it well enough? Still tastes great though

I made 3 batches of this today and followed a few of the other suggestions:
used half and half
omitted the alomond extract (forgot to buy it)
HOWEVER I wish I had used part heavy cream and part half and half as I find it to be a little to watery.  I used the full amount of whiskey (Bushmills and I dont care for it, shouldve gone cheap.  Also in the first batch I warmed the swt. cond. milk and dissolved the coffee..it was ok.  In the two other batches I did not do this and oddly these two batches stayed together better.  Also my measurments for the choc. coffe and vanilla were quite generous.

Used alot of the changes suggested~half cream and half milk(though all cream may not be that bad), 1 cup Irish whiskey, 1 Tbsp. choc. syrup, 1/4 tsp. almond extract, 1/2 tsp. coconut(this I believe is a must).  May up the coffee a bit, and tiny bit more chocolate sryup...it seemed a tad bit lighter colored than Baileys.  It is wonderful just out of the blender, but will keep some in the fridge for awhile to sit. I Don't drink  Bailey's that much(I'm too cheap!) but this is just wonderful compared to the other brands I have tried.  Thanks!!!!!!!!

Just made some and followed the instructions from a lot of people here to lessen the almond extract and whiskey. You guys are right because any more whiskey it would be too strong and any more almond extract the almond flavor would overwhelm the other flavors. Thanks for the recipe and thanks everyone for the advice. Loved it.

Edit: Someone mentioned that it'll taste even better after leaving it in the fridge for 24 hours and it is true. Try tasting the difference when you just made it fresh and taste it again after leaving it overnight or longer.

WOW! Great Recipe! I liked it  (for the most part) just as it is.  I would recommend reducing the Whiskey a tad bit. Maybe just 1 Cup or 1-1/4 Cup. And I did reduce the ALMOND extract to 1/2 Teaspoon. It is great the way it is. But the initial "bite" from the (Jameson) Whiskey will wake you up.

Responding to Dave.  I have been making a recipe similar to this for about 30 years.  I was taught that you use a blender for everything but the cream.  Once everything is blended, stir ( with a wooden spoon, mind you) in the cream.  Never had it separate.

I wanted to use up a 1/2 can of sweetened condensed milk I had in the refrigerator, so went in search of a recipe.  OMG!  Happy New Year to us!!  Although I halved everything (due to the 1/2 can of sweetened condensed milk), I only used 1/2 cup of Makers Mark Whisky (the brand we had on hand).  My husband is on his way to the store so we can make a bigger batch :-).

I have made this over a dozen times now. Sometimes I will substitute half the heavy cream with milk, sometimes I don’t. I have used a variety of instant coffees as well as a tbsp of cold brew.  It has always come out great and will be in my permanent  go to recipe book.

Super easy and incredibly delicious! I used folgers decaf instant, carnation sweetened condensed milk, and Jameson Irish whiskey. I warmed up a small amount of the heavy cream to dissolve the coffee and only used 1/2 teaspoon of the almond extract.

I made this as gifts for co-workers.  The 1st batch I made exactly as the recipe and the whiskey is a bit much.  On the 2nd batch I did scale the whiskey back to almost 1.5 cups.  I did use change the 1 c heavy cream to 1/2 c 1/2 & 1/2 and 1/2 c of heavy cream.    I also scaled the almond extract back to 1/2 tsp.  The blending part was fine.  I read a review that said to blend all the ingredients except the cream and then add the cream and blend quickly.  This was supposed to prevent the separating.  I think it worked.  This was my 1st time making this and did not realize that after blending it was a bit runny.  Well they thickened right up after being in the refrigerator for about an hour.  Perfect.  I realized that I used Special Dark chocolate syrup in my 3rd batch.  I thought it was good.  I did make 1 more batch with just the regular chocolate syrup and I think I personally liked it better.  I've already been asked if I will make it again next year!

Closest we've found to our off the shelf favourite!!
Nothing like a hot cup of something you love that you were able to add a little home made touch too. Love the recipes, and information in general that is shared. 
We have built this recipe many times altering it slightly to our taste. We're partial to Caroline's Irish Cream. We found switching the cream for a almond milk, dropping the almond extract. We also use a ten rather then fourteen ounce can of condensed milk and slightly reducing the chocolate syrup. It's the bomb!!
Oh and we like our Canadian J.P.Wisers deluxe as the medium.
P.s. The almond milk, and less condensed milk drops the calorie total. It also will not separate  like cream would and has a longer shelf life.
Cheers:)

It’s very good. I make it every year.  The only thing I found is that the heavy cream curdles when you add it to the blender so I started doing half heavy cream and half half and half!  For the first time this year I made it with the Kirkland’s Irish whisky.  It was still outstanding. My nephew asks for this every year and returns the bottles to me for refill!

So glad to have found this, as I had lost my note card of an Irish Cream recipe I had for years, that took eggs. I love this one! Made it exactly to the recipe; I was leery of the amount of almond, so added half of it, then ended up using the whole teaspoon. Love it in coffee, milk, hot chocolate, or just straight!

Like it a lot.   Based on previous reviews I omitted the almond flavoring.  I did change the instant coffee to instant espresso and I stand by the use of Jameson for the Irish whiskey (won't find much better).  In the future I think I will reduce the chocolate syrup by a 1/4-1/2 tsp so all of the favors meld together better and it doesn't taste so much like chocolate Irish cream.   Overall, a solid recipe and definitely something worth sharing.

Love this. We use light cream or  1/2  & 1/2, and hazelnut extract instead of almond (didn't have almond and h-nut was amazing). WARNING: If you blend it hard with the whiskey in it, you can "bruuse" it and cause separating - blend everything else together first and add the whiskey on low for 10 secs at the end. Keeps for months in the fridge. Shake well, serve cold. Yum!!!

Third times the charm.
Substituted Half & Half 
and just used (little less) than 1/4 teaspoon of almond extract.
-
My friends and I did a blind taste test of all the irish creams we could find (Ok in just a couple of stores)
The winner hands down was Carolans.

I cant wait to throw this into the mix ... I think (with the slight alteration) this will be the winner.
Thanks for the great recipe, easy & fun to make ...
woo hoo!

delicious & easy to make. I like it thinner so I use half & half (called coffee cream in Nova Scotia) instead of the heavy cream. Cut the whiskey down to 1 1/2 C and a few times skipped the almond flavouring when I ran out. It's more authentic with 1/2 tsp almond but still delicious. I never have instant coffee so I use the bottom of the pot ( 1/4 C) or a brewed pod of espresso. You can play with the recipe and it stays good. I always add the cream to the whiskey, not other way around and it never curdles. And I always use Jamiesons whiskey. No playing with that part of it.

I made it a few times. The first time was exactly as printed but found it a bit too thick for my liking. The next time I used "light" cream instead of heavy but it turned out a bit too thin. Using 1/2 cup heavy cream and 1/2 cup light cream made it just right. All three ways were absolutely delicious, however I'm just huge consistency fan.

I have made this many times.  It's almost exactly the same as my grandmothers recipe.  I usually add less rye as its a little strong on what's called for here.  And u can use milk if u want to lighten the fat content a bit.

Don't be SILLY and try to make this less fattening or cheap, and then give it a low rating, LOL!  

If you are going to cheat on the liquor, use YOUR FAVORITE whiskey.  And if you prefer a little different flavor, maybe wait to add the vanilla and almond extract, and take a shot of the unfinished mixture, and try adding things to that shot that YOU might like the taste of, and see what you like best in one little shot, before making a batch of it, and then coming here to complain.

In my case, I happen to like Canadian Whiskey, ie Seagrams Crown Royal, so I used that for the whiskey...  And then, instead of adding vanilla and almond extract, I put in DiSardonno Ameretto until I really liked the flavor instead!  

OH MY, was that ever delish!!!  Trust me, it will go down SOOO smooth when its YOUR favorite flavors :)  Try 3 spoonful's in your coffee! 

And put it into CLEAN bottles, keep it in the fridge, and remember to shake it up before pouring.

This is delicious!  I compared this to the generic Irish Cream I buy and realized how many flavors there are in this recipe; the generic stuff just tastes like creamy, cheap liquor!  After reading the reviews, I chose to use 1/2 & 1/2, which I think the consistency is perfect.  I also melted down a mixture of choc & mint choc chips to sub for choc syrup; the mint subtly comes through & I really like the added flavor.  I left the whiskey measurement as I LOVE whiskey, and after sitting for a week the whiskey flavor blends nicely into the rest.  Definitely a winner recipe!!!!  Thank-You so much.  (Also, a doubled recipe makes short of a 1.75 bottle)

I can't tell you how disappointed I am by this recipe! I have tried it twice now; once, with coffee cream to try and save calories (ha! you need to realize there is nothing at all good for you about Irish Cream, so you may as well embrace the fat content), and the second with full fat whipping cream (or heavy cream as you call it in the US). 

The lighter version tasted like melted cheap chocolate ice cream - not terrible but watery and nothing like Bailey's. The full cream version just left the fat floating to the top like lumpy chocolate whip cream and as a result what was left was even thinner than the first after I had skimmed it. The only change I made was to skip the almond flavor which I dislike and use a tablespoon of expresso instead of instant coffee. I used a blender as recommended.

Yum...yum...yum! So easy and so good! I "tweaked" mine a bit according to other's suggestions...I used 1¼ cups of Jameson, 1¾ cups of half-n-half, fat-free sweet/condensed milk and 1½ tsp. of pure vanilla extract and left the almond flavoring out. I used the same amount of chocolate and instant coffee as what the original recipe called for. Very good recipe...I will be making this every year for gifts to hand out as well as for myself to enjoy. Thank you for submitting this, Mom.

I love Irish cream but I don't like the calories that come with it, so I decided I would try to make my own slightly healthier version.  I used fat-free half & half and fat-free sweetened condensed milk.  I thought I had instant coffee but turned out not to so I used instant espresso instead - it was fine but I think next time I'll add a little less.  I've been sipping on this for a few days now and gave it to some company tonight, they said they prefer it to Bailey's (which they find too sweet)

I didn't use the almond, simply because I don't have that on hand in my pantry.  The rest of the recipe I use exactly and it turns out great every time.  It is much cheaper than buying Bailey's.

Loved the recipe WITH the changes noted by other reviewers. Cut the whiskey down to 7/8 cup. OR, double all ingredients except the whiskey. Also, I make mine several days ahead and let the flavors blend. I leave it in the blender container in the frig and give it a quick blend just before serving. Soooo much better than Baileys. Everyone asks for the recipe!

I tried this with my own homemade chocolate syrup and Jim Beam Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey.  The only thing I would change is lowering the amount of alcohol from 1.66 cups to about 1.25 cups.  It is meant to be creamy, so I would not change the heavy cream in it at all!

I have tried many this is the best. I had to use canned milk, out of cream,and put the blender on high for 45 seconds . It turned out great.

This recipe was ok but I'd make some changes or just buy Irish Cream from the liquor store pre-made. I have granules spotting the drink which makes it look creepy. It also has a very strong coffee and almond flavor which over-powers the Irish whiskey flavor which is the BASIC flavor. I would reduce the amount of coffee and almond used.

I followed the recipe exactly.  I didn't feel the whiskey amount was too strong at all, but the heavy cream and almond extract ruined it for me.  The heavy cream gave it a consistency I couldn't swallow and the almond extract was overpowering.

Making this for the second time, amazing recipe! I must say though I don't think it tastes much like baileys - because its much much better. Given the fact that making this costs three times as much (where I live), if your looking for baileys taste, I say go buy a bottle of baileys.This is a much fresher, less artificial tasting recipe.

I made this recipe last weekend because I was craving Irish Cream but didn't have any.  I read the reviews and the the only thing I changed was the amount of almond flavoring because it can be strong.  I used about a scant 1/2 tsp.  It was perfect, served it on the rocks for dessert...yummee. I actually preferred the flavor to store bought. Next time I think I will try using 1/2 & 1/2 only because I need to watch my fat intake.  I'm sure it will also be delicious. :-)

I read through all the suggestions/reviews before making and came up with the following balance - I only changed the amount of alcohol, since I didn't have irish whiskey, I used Chivas and only used 7 oz...I did try 10oz before, but find that 7 is the perfect balance.  I also did not add the almond extract as we have allergies in our family and didn't want to take any chances.  Other than these minor changes I followed the recipe exactly and it is perfect!!  I plan on giving some bottled Irish cream as hostess gifts this x-mas!!

I cut the almond extract in half and STILL it tastes like almond cream liqueur. Also, I cut the sweetness a bit by using half sweetened condensed milk and half evaporated milk (aka unsweetened condensed milk).

Amazingly good in a cup of ice cold Diet Coke! I know... sounds weird huh?  Well as much as I love to add this to a yummy cup of coffee ...  I encourage you to try it in your favorite soda on a hot summer day!

I have made this recipe more than once. Love it!! The flavor mellows after storing in the fridge for a few days. Keep this in mind if you are serving it same day, it may taste a little strong!

Very good! I've been making this for about a year now, but make a few changes. Increase the choc syrup and instant coffee for mocha Irish Cream and reduce the almond extract by half. Finally, do not over blend. The cream will curdle. Sometimes I use fat-free sweetened condensed milk and/or fat-free half and half. Hubby and I do like the mouth feel and taste of the heavy cream much better, though. People ask me for the recipe all the time. I always point them back to this page!

I was in a rush and did not read the reviews - it was super strong! Yowza! But, everyone loved it, it was a hit regardless...or maybe their taste buds were numbed from the alcohol? Still rating it high because I loved the touch of coffee and almond extract, and I'll be making it again, but with less whiskey...

Great recipe. I wanted to make it again and double it but I only had enough whiskey for one batch. Still came out good, nobody noticed accept for me (I didn't tell anyone) it was just a little thicker.

Really, it just doesn't get much better!  I usually don't add the entire amount of whiskey, skip the instant coffee and add it to fresh brewed coffee to taste.  Simply delicious!

I love Baileys Irish Cream and I love this recipe.  I used half and half instead of heavy cream and still find it to be somewhat thick - just a have to shake a little.  I used cheap canadian whiskey instead of irish - still very good!

I made this for Christmas presents (kept some for us!) and everyone loved it! I did substitute fat free half & half for most, but not all of the cream, and only used 1-1/3 cups of whiskey (Canadian on sale, not Irish). Also, I doubled the vanilla and left out the almond (personal preference, I hate almond flavoring).  It's great!

Awesome! One thing, it is pretty thick. If I was drinking it on the rocks, I'd want to thin it down. Maybe I'll try a batch with half and half or even milk next time. Also, I used a shot of espresso instead of instant coffee, I'd recommend that.

This taste great. I've also made a low fat version using fat free cream and fat free sweetend condensed milk. Not as tasty as the original but still enjoyable without the guilt.

I find it mellows a little if you make it a couple of days ahead of time allowing the flavors to blend. Absolutely delicious! Save yourself some time and just make a double batch, you'll be making more of thione!

OH MY GOODNESS!!!!  This is absolutely delicious.  Why buy it when you can make it?  This is also wonderful in a good hot cup of coffee.  Curl up with this, a blanket, a book, and some Irish Soda Bread on a rainy day.  What could be more perfect???

My hubby liked this better than any brand of Irish cream that he has had. I took others advice and used half and half. I also was too cheap to buy choc. syrup so I melted half an ounce of semi sweet chocolate in a little of the cream.

OMG!!!! Outrageous!!!!

I didn't have chocolate syrup, I used a 1 tsp of cocoa and 1 tsp Chocolate extract and followed the rest of the recipe. I will never buy Irish Cream AGAIN!!  This is 10 x's better.  THANKS!!!!!

I tried this on a whim though I was extremely skeptical. I had no heavy cream or almond extract (I've never been crazy about almond extract anyway, and several people said it was alright without.), so I added a tad more condensed milk and added some 3% milk, and am absolutely in love. I'm really excited to try it with heavy cream, and even more excited to show this off.  Thank you!

Vary easy to make and the taste was great.I had to use 1/2 cup strong coffee and think it worked out well.This recipe is easy to change to taste.

 I add differant ingredients like Butterscotch caramel sauce and ground Nutmeg to differant batches and all came out great.Have fun with this one

This is soooo incredibly good and so easy!  I used Seagram's VO and the fat free half and half.  I can't wait to give these out for gifts.  I'm so glad I can have Bailey's anytime without the cost!

Tasty! Like so many other reviewers, I made certain changes and used the following: 1 cup fat-free half-and-half instead of cream, 14 ounces sweetened condensed milk, around 1-1/4 cups good Canadian whiskey (I used Canadian Club), a heaping tsp of instant coffee granules, 2 TBS Hershey's syrup, 1-1/4 tsp vanilla, and ½ tsp almond extract. I whisked it all together in a large bowl and poured it into a lidded four-cup container (it fit with room to spare). Fabulous! 1-1/4 cups of whiskey made it strong but not overwhelmingly so. Thanks for sharing, Mom, this is awesome!

Instead of putting in 1tsp of almong extract, i put a 1/2 tsp of mint extract, and used the fat free condenced milk.....yummm ohhh as Rachel Ray would say!

I've had homemade irish cream before that was much better than this.  This stuff came out too thick and sugary for me - next time I would use more cream or less condensed milk and chocolate syrup.  I made it for St Patty's day and most of it is still sitting in my fridge a month later.  The two times I tried to drink it I got a stomachache and a headache.

Everyone LOVED this, many asked for the recipe or how it was made. My only regret is that I didn't double the recipe! 
I took some of the advice of other reviewers, used melted chocolate chips in place of the syrup and totally omitted the almond extract. I did not adjust the amount of whiskey and noone seemed to think it was too strong. :)
I will be replacing my regular Irish Cream recipe, which calls for eggs, with this one!

What can I say?  My wife and I love this stuff.  It has become a Saturday ritual to make and drink a batch,or two, each week.  If you want to fiddle with the receipt to make it taste the way you want it to... so much the better.

This makes a great gift.  i scrounge dark glass bottles from yard sales and friends, sterilize, then use.  i do prefer it made with either light cream, or half and half, and 1/2 t. of almond extract.

This is a great recipe! I followed the suggestions of using only 7oz of Whiskey and used coconut extract instead of almond extract. Next time I'm going to try 6oz of Whiskey being as it was still pretty strong. Guess I'm a light weight! Very tasty.

Maybe I shouldn't rate a recipe 5 stars when I've
made so many changes:  Used l/2 & l/2 instead of
cream, lowfat condensed milk, only 7 oz. of Jamesons, and l/4 tsp. almond extract.  It is
awesome! (P.S. The flavor gets much stronger with age)

It has a little chalky after taste. Any idea as to what is causing that?

DELICIOUS!

The ONLY changes I made was decrease the whiskey to 1/2 cup (I absolutely KNEW 1 2/3 cup would be too much whiskey flavor for me) and subbed 1/2 tsp espresso powder for the instant coffee granules (it's what I had).

Even with the two changes I made, I think the overall flavor was preserved compared to store-bought (I can still taste the whiskey, but it's not over-powering), so 5 stars it is!

Loves this. Took the advice of other reviewers and cut back on the amount of almond extract. Also added a little more Jameson because...well, hi. Jameson. Added a tiiiiny dash of coconut and a splash of milk as well... I also may or may not have inadvertently doubled the coffee... I was looking at a different recipe I had been considering earlier and wasn't paying attention. *Facepalm* 

So as I was going along, I tasted it at all steps. Very good as written, just tweaked it a little to my own prefs.

Tastes much like the original Bailey's Irish Cream. I did lower the alcohol to 7 oz (as recommended) and next time will cut back almond extract to ½ tsp. This may be personal preference/taste but definitely good for a give-away to friends at the holidays.

I made it exactly as is for a party and it was a hit!! If I made it for myself I might make it a little less rich but that isn't negative. I added nearly 2 cups of Jameson and that made it worth the calories.

I made one change. I used a 1/2 c of the half and half in addition to 1/2 c of the Heavy Whipping Cream. However, in my opinion I could have also used less liquor. Like 1 cup rather than 1 and 2/3rds. Cup.  I gave a bottle away as a gift and the other one I'll keep for myself. I like it over ice. I also plan to try it in my coffee. I'm loving this home made I rish cream.
Thank you!

It’s a good recipe. I think the heavy cream is great if you are only planning on serving it in coffee ... if you plan on drinking it straight (as a dessert drink) half and half is a better option. I hate Almond Extract and omit it but coconut extract is very nice.

Good basis for personalized adjustment.  One process variation I recommend is to mix everything in the blender at high setting except the heavy cream, otherwise you can get butter (not a good texture for this drink).  Once done you can blend in the cream at a lower setting until mixed (5-10 seconds).  I recommend adjusting quantity of Irish Whisky depending on brand.  I used Killbeggan, which has more character than Jameson, so adjusted it down to 1 1/4 C (good flavor, less alcohol bite).   Also, the almond extract may overwhelm the balance if using some of the stronger extracts (Nielsen-Massey) so I moved it down to 1/2-3/4 t (difference in opinion between wife and I)

This is really tasty. The only change I made was no almond extract because I am not a fan and I don't think it  makes it taste like real  Baileys. I instead substituted coconut extract and that made it taste so much better. Easy to make but if you mix it too long then it will separate. I blended for maybe 20 to 25 seconds.

I've made 3 batches of this recipe and they all came out great! I did change up the recipe to suit my own tastes. Each time I made the recipe it always came out way toostrong; however, I must admit that I am using Wild Turkey 101 (50.5 %) Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey and not Irish Whisky; I would have used Irish Whisky but I didn't want to upset the Irish Catholics or Irish Protestants within my family. Eventhough the recipe is a bit strong, it does mellow out in the refrigerator. Just to save a couple of shots for myself, I use 1 cup of Whiskey instead of 1 and 2/3rds of a cup. Keep in mind that this recipe will make about 36 ounces of "Irish" Cream. This is by far the best Irish Cream recipe I've come across.

I changed from Jamison to Jack Daniels. Big differences in whiskey. I also used one receipe with half and half. Taste is great, consistency of mixture is thinner.
Everyone loved this as a Christmas gift. Thanks.

This is a solid recipe BUT it needs adjustment to suit your tastes.  It's a little boozey and the Sweetened condensed milk is prominent.

recommend: use espresso granules instead of instant coffee.

Perfect recipe but you must chill the whiskey first, this is a very important step. If you don't,  then when mixed with the cream it will separate. Also, bottle and refrigerate promptly and don't over blend. The heat fom the blender blades will make the cream curdle.  Things I learned the hard way.

I love this recipe. I followed the advice of other reviewers and used only 1 cup of Jameson Irish Whiskey, and flavored it with a mix of 1/8 tsp almond extract and 1/8 coconut extract instead of just the almond. I make this every Christmas and it's a big hit! Thanks for sharing your recipe.

I made slight alterations to the recipe.    I used 7 oz of Whiskey, 1/2 tsp of almond extract and equal parts heavy cream and half and half.

For diabetics out there, I use a can of 12 oz., evap milk with 1 cup sugar substitute.  I  used 1.5 cups Seagrams because that is what I have on hand. If you like a stiff shot of whiskey in your coffee use the 1 & 2/3 cups.

I followed the recipe as it is, just cut half the almond extract and still was lots, I suggest probably start with 1/4 and go from there  I must say it has A LOT of alcohol (and trust me, we can drink!), I suggest to start with just one cup and see how it goes.

Delicious,  but a little too much Irish whiskey for my liking. I'll use a little less next time. I also used chocolate sweetened condensed milk  instead of the chocolate syrup.  The end result was a little darker in color, but still delicious.

This was outstanding!  I recommend the recipe wholeheartedly -with the suggestion that people read some of the other reviews and tweaks to the recipe. They are very helpful. Accordingly, I used 1 1/4 cups Canadian whiskey;  1/4 cup whole milk, heated to dissolve  the coffee and melt 15 chocolate chips and 3/4 cup heavy cream.  I blended everything except the whiskey and then slowly added the whiskey while blending. (This prevents curdling)  The only major correction I'd make is the recipe says it will last in the refrigerator for two months.  Mine was gone after a week. LOL

I made this with dairy free modifications. Instead of the condensed milk I used a can of light coconut milk (reg. coconut milk is too thick) and for the cream I used cashew milk. I, like others, melted chocolate chips (using a tablespoon of cashew milk) but I melted them in the microwave with  instant espresso and raw sugar  because I don’t have instant coffee on hand.
YOU NEED TO ADD SWEETENER! I used a mix of raw sugar, maple syrup and stevia to taste. I don’t like it too sweet but without the sweetened condensed milk, it does need something.
The coconut milk taste is barely noticeable to me and my husband didn’t notice it at all.
I, as many others have, cut waaay down on the almonds abstract (few drops for me), upped the vanilla (real not artificial), and dropped the whiskey to 1.5 cups.
I’ve made this 4 times now and I much much prefer it to almond milk baileys (their dairy-free version). Not to mention the cost is less than a quarter of the real thing (in Canada and buying the smaller dairy free kind).

Not a fan of almond extract so I only used a few drops. I used half and half cream and 1.5 cups of Irish whiskey. My only complaint is that you have to shake the  out of it after it’s been sitting.

I did not have chocolate syrup so I used cocoa powder instead.  Also did not have heavy cream so I subbed half and half.  I poured the half and half in last with the blender running.  Didn't have any trouble with whiskey and half and half separating.

So easy and delish!  And no raw eggs makes it better.   I make it with fat free half and half and milk and 1/2 the sweetened condensed milk for calories counting.   Everyone loves it!

This is a fantastic base recipe - thank you for sharing! I made a few small changes based on others' reviews and I'm so glad I did! Cut the whiskey down to just over a cup, added 3/4 tsp. more of vanilla (1 3/4 tsp. total), and another Tbl of chocolate syrup. Amazingly delicious! It's dangerous! :)

Found the original recipe too strong. I reduced the whiskey and substituted 1/4 cup of the heavy cream for half and half. I also liked it best without the almond extract for a more traditional flavour.

Thank you so much for this recipe! My hubby was busy doing a "to-do" list for me ... when he suddenly says, "I'd sure like a coffee with Baileys!" No Bailey's, no worries! I looked this up, made it in minutes, only had one cup of some old Canadian whiskey... no almond  extract... still PERFECT!!!

I made a batch using other reviewers suggestions and: used half&half cream, 1/2tsp almond extract and reduced the whiskey to 11/3 cups, and melted the chipits in some cream, then made 12 bottles and the only change from the recipe was to use half&half cream instead of heavy cream because I prefer it. Use ALL the whiskey and ALL the almond extract as well as chocolate syrup. I did warm a bit of the cream to dissolve the coffee. When I made it with the chipits instead of the syrup, it just didn't blend as well. This is sooooo good!!! I drank some the day after I made it and now I'm looking forward to letting my next batch sit and mellow a bit. I'll be making at least another dozen bottles for gifts, this is so much better than Baileys and a really nice gift.

I made this for the first time and i love it :) added more coffee than was said. But i liked it better that way. Mist definitely one has to use good quality ingredients, because otherwise it won’t taste that good. Will make some more for the holidays:)

I am on my second batch with modifications and the second batch is working out nicely.  I cut the Almond Extract down to 1/4 tsp and increased the Vanilla to 1 1/2 tsp. 
The first batch I kept the 1 2/3 whiskey but most did not like it because the whiskey overpowered the other flavors.  The second batch I moved it to 1 1/3 and it is much better.  I used an immersion blender and I kept that running as I slowly poured in the whiskey a little at a time.  This did create some foaming but everything stayed together without curdling.

This is a great recipe! I followed it exactly the first time and everything was really tasty. The only problem I had was it had WAY too much Jameson in it. I never thought I'd say that, but other people in the reviews were right. The second time I backed off the booze a bit (I used a cup) and I tried coconut extract instead of almond. This was perfect, it has a Baileys flavor but it's much creamier. I will definitely do this again!

Next time, I will use more Irish whisky and a lot less chocolate syrup--it was WAY too sweet and chocolaty for my tastes! Still an excellent recipe as long as those minor adjustments are made, but that's entirely a matter of opinion--if you love decadent sweets and death by chocolate, you probably won't want to change a thing lol. I also didn't let my first batch go to waste despite it being over the top in sweetness for me--my friend who has a sweet tooth LOVED it as is, and it also works great as a coffee creamer or part of a milkshake with a little extra kick. ;)

This is perfect - and if you're Irish, the amount of whiskey is not overkill :) I might drop the almond a "teeny" bit, but rave reviews by all my drinking friends and relatives.
And Jamesons is the preferred whiskey.

VERY good! I liked SAMMARTI's tips and followed those. I used only 1 cup of the whiskey and 1/4 tsp almond extract. They mentioned it was on the thick side with the heavy cream, which I would not care for as well. I used my own homemade version of low carb milk, which combines heavy cream and water. The texture was perfect. Glad I found this recipe, and I know I'll make it again! Thanks!

Great recipe. I found it to be thick like a mudslide. Will cut back on the condensed milk next time for a smoother pour. Cheers!

I took this to a Christmas party and it was a huge hit! I made it exactly as the recipe called. I will probably play around with some of the flavorings next time for fun (coconut versus almond) but the heavy cream is definitely a must.

I made this for Christmas for my daughters. They're nuts about it. This recipe as written makes about a liter. Had to make two as i could find nothing smaller.

Oh my goodness. It curdled and was far too rich. I was so disappointed and my stomach is still upset from taking a few sips. Cleaning up was awful too, it made my dishes and sink so greasy. The almond extract was overpowering and it was very strong. And I like my whiskey.. I am stunned this has great reviews.

Super easy to make and is a classy gift in a glass bottle with sparkly bow.   This was rich creamy boozy decadence!   I am on a budget,  however, so switched out for a less expensive whiskey.

I've made this a couple of times and really like it.  I use half an half instead of cream and only 3/4 cup of whiskey.  It's thick enough and strong enough for us.

Super Special, Thank you for sharing !!  The ONLY reason this is not a 5 star recipe for our family was the amount of Irish Whiskey.  I read another review that said to use 3/4 cup and it was almost too much, it blended in really nice after sitting in the fridge overnight.

I liked this recipe, I just used 1/2 c heavy cream ( whipping cream) and 1/2c half and half as I found it to creamy, and only used 1/2tsp of almond extract as it was to much. Other than that It was a good recipe!  I Will make it again.

Very good -- an excellent take on Bailey's. Use fresh cream and it won't curdle. No need to use a blender either, just mix it in a large bowl. Next time I'll cut back on the almond extract -- just a little too much comes forward. Up the servings to 31 for a full 750 ml bottle and have enough for gifts.

This got raves from all concerned. Better than store-bought Baileys, was the consensus.
I did use a little less whiskey, as some suggested, but then I substituted a splash of amaretto  for the almond extract.

This is amazing and BETTER than what you can buy in the liquor store! Someone made this for me last Christmas, and so I was inspired to do it myself to give as gifts this year. It is super easy and very tasty. In response to some of the other comments and changes, I used half and half instead of full cream. I also halved the almond extract in my first batch, but I went ahead and used the full teaspoon the next time. I think it tastes more like the real thing with the full teaspoon.

I really like this! I did follow other reviews and cut the almond in half. Next time I may try milk chocolate chips (melted) in place of the chocolate syrup, but the syrup sure is easy and convenient. The instant coffee that I found was Starbucks Cafe Mocha. (I gently warmed the cream to dissolve the coffee in, then poured it into the blender with the other ingredients.) And I used Gentleman Jack because that's what I had on hand. The jack packs a bit of a punch! It definitely warms your tummy and is a delicious treat.

Dave,

Mix all the other ingredients first then blend the cream in last. It will not separate.

This Irish Cream is fantastic! I made this recipe using Canadian Club Whiskey. Came out stronger than the Jamison's Irish Whiskey. I used vanilla extract, almond extract and coconut extract. All 3 extracts gave it an authentic taste.
Word of caution!!! DO NOT use a VitaMix blender to mix this. It almost turned into whip cream. Heated the mixture up and separated the cream & whiskey from each other.
I had to strain the first batch which was messy and wasteful.
I repeated the same mixture but  simply used my balloon whisk by hand. Came out great!! Brought to a Christmas party and it was THE HIT of beverages. Excellent in coffee!
I will make this again and again (using my balloon whisk).
My husband and I made it together experimenting with the extracts until we got it right. It was a lot of fun doing this together. We will do this every Christmas together and give as gifts PLUS enjoy ourselves.

Awesome recipe.  I make homemade Irish Cream every year but have always used a recipe with eggs.  This was just as good and doesn't make me nervous.  I added skim milk though - just a little too thick for me.

This is very good!  After reading a couple of the reviews, I cut the almond extract down to 1/4 t. and substituted the heavy cream for half-n-half.  Next time, I will use 1/2 C. heavy cream and 1/2 C. half-n-half.  It wasn't a creamy as I had hoped with the half-n-half.  I'll also reduce the chocolate by half.    Will definitely make again!!!

This is delicious, fast and easy to make.  The only change I made was to use 1 1/2 cups of Jameson whiskey instead of 1 2/3 cups and it was perfect.  Don't think I would have wanted it any stronger.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  I am taking it to a friend tomorrow as a hostess gift.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe.  Great for the holidays or anytime!

I love this stuff!, I change - in a bowl I only use 1 cup each of the cream, condensed milk and the whiskey. I use coconut extract 1/4 teaspoon, chocolate syrup and 3 eggs (whip eggs and condensed milk in blender).
In large bowl add whiskey, coconut extract, chocolate syrup and whipping cream, stir gently, add egg & milk mixture and and stir gently. I stir slowly so as not to create any froth when it is bottled.  Then I bottle it, normally get a bit over a 26 oz. bottle, make some nice labels & refrigerate. This is for Baileys Irish Cream but I will try this one, sounds good.  I normally keep any fancy liquor bottles through the year, remember to sterilize bottles first.
Normally get over 3 full 26 oz bottles out of 1 bottle of Irish Whiskey.
I have never had the cream separate.

Outstanding. The almond gives a dimension none of the other recipes have. Double the amount for a punch bowl. Use a fifth of whiskey (750 ml). 

Some twists. Amaretto instead of almond extract. Try cooled espresso instead of instant coffee. Omit the coffee and add raspberry syrup. Increase the chocolate and add mint extract instead of almond

I made it using the bourbon that I had on hand instead of whiskey, and liked it. I should of cut down on the amount of alcohol asked for. I read the reviews after making it and saw that many had cut down on the booze. It's  very good with the bourbon. How can you go wrong with heavy cream and sweetened condensed milk, coffee and chocolate! ( I left out the almond extract, I didnt have it on hand).

I love irish cream and this recipe is as close to Carolines as it comes.  The only change I made was to only use 1 cup of Tullamore D.E.W. 

Also, add it as your last ingredient before whisking or bending.  That way nothing curdles.  Also, refrigerate, refrigerate, refrigerate.

Generous tablespoons of chocolate. Cut the Irish whiskey down to a 11/4 cup and add only 1/4 TSP of almond extract. It is has too strong of an almond flavor.
I also used an instant Italian espresso called Medaglia D'Oro.
After playing with it 6 times, My family and friends finally said I nailed the flavor of Bailey's down.

Great recipe. I think to those stating use less Irish Whiskey, I think the recipe is actually  1---  2/3 of a cup , not 1 & 2/3 cups. So you use only 2/3 of a cup, I used 1 cup which was great ;)

My milk curdled, and I was totally put-off; however, after skimming the slight cream on top, I decided to whip it with 1/4 cup of whipping cream for topping. The Irish cream below was delicious, albeit not exactly like Bailey's (I assume they have some proprietary ingredient) it was creamy, multi-faceted and, yes, strong! (I only used 1 1/3 cup whiskey.) It was too strong for some of us, so we tried cutting it with 1/2 cup of cold coffee or half and half and either worked great over ice. 

I used Dilettante  Ephimere chocolate sauce - excellent match!
Thank you for sharing the recipe.

The amount of whiskey in this recipe is too much. I will use 1 cup in the future. Also will use half and half instead of cream. The cream is too thick.

Everyone we served it to loved it! I followed the advice of others and halved the amount of almond extract and I only put in 1 cup of whiskey and it still had some kick. Perfect for Christmas morning coffee!

This is fantastic!  The only adjustment I made was to cut the almond extract in half.  This is creamier and richer than Bailey's, without that unpleasant "bite" that Bailey's has.

Very close to original recipe I've used for 50 years!  Very, very good, almost better than original store kind.  I did add 3 eggs, and cut 1/2 c. Of cream.

Love this recipe ~ and love how truly flexible it is! It is delicous made exactly as written, but it is also delicous when used as inspiration for creating a new version!
Look at that group of ingredients!  How can you go wrong? I have made it with any amber spirit you can think of.  Bourbon, rum or brandy.  More or less of any of the flavorings, half and half instead of heavy cream, make it yours!  
Friends and family alike are always pleased when I bring a bottle. We always bring some camping! Perfect in coffee or hot chocolate, yum!

I made this today and was really shocked as to how good this is. The only change I made was, I used Canadian whiskey and not Irish whiskey. It is very good. I will absolutely make this again. Thanks for the recipe.

Substituted Christian Brothers Brandy for whiskey.  Everyone  raved about this recipe, that it was better than Bailey's, and we didn't have any guilt for adulterating any Jameson's Irish Whiskey.  Liqueur connoisseurs from 24 to 70 said it did not have the chemical aftertaste Baileys can have.  I think the instant coffee granules are a key component.

I made a couple of changes to suit my taste.  I made a 'Canadian' version by using maple whiskey insead of irish, I also added 1/4 cup of Frangelico insead of the vanilla and almond extracts. Whiskey cut back to 1 cup as per some reviewers suggestions and also doubled the instant coffee.  I am rating based on the original, my version I'd give 5+ to!

Excellent recipe. I didn't have syrup so I used 2 tsp cocoa powder, 2 tsp water, and 1 tsp sugar. I did start off light on the whiskey and added more to our taste. I only had half and half but it was relish.

Per another reviewer, I doubled all of the ingredients except for the whiskey and used half the amount of almond extract. USE cream, but remember that if you blend it for too long it will want to turn into butter. That may be the reason some reviewers reported it 'separating'. This is a delicious recipe, and I can't wait to take it to the family for Christmas! (I may have sampled it...) Thank you for the recipe.

This is a great basic recipe but, you can get creative and use a flavored vodka (360 double chocolate vodka) or flavored whiskey (Black Velvet Toasted caramel) and/or different flavored coffee creamers.  I like Italian Sweet Cream or Coconut creamer.  Have fun and mix it up.

Its truly the best recipe. Don't tinker around with it.  It needs heavy cream not half and half. If you think its too strong, well that's what Irish Cream Liqueur is. If your using it in coffee use less. If you don't want it straight as a shooter, have it over ice. Last year I came across Carnation Caramel condensed milk.  OMG did that make it good.  Different but still good.  Just love this, easy to make and a pleasure to give as gifts.

I've been making this for years with the same changes as other reviewers (cutting down the amount of whiskey and almond extract). Last time I made it, I used almond milk (only 30 calories per cup) instead of cream or half and half, and it was still very good - not as rich, obviously, but think of all the fat and calories saved!

Perfect!!! I did cut the whiskey to 1c and yes it became too thick so I also added 2/3c of milk. You do have to remember that when you omit a portion of the thin liquid(whiskey) from the recipe you will need to make up for that thinning liquid by other means or it will most definitely be way too thick. This recipe couldn't get any easier and is super delicious!

This was excellent!  We had to make another batch because it was sooo good.  We use it in our coffee this weekend.  We did use real cream and it was not too thick like some of the other reviews said. We did reduce the whiskey to 1 cup and it was just right!! In doing that, you can make 3 batches from one 750ml bottle. -about 1/3 the cost of one bottle of Baileys.

Needs more chocolate and salt - then it's delicious!  I doubled the chocolate, added a pinch of Himalayan pink salt, and !  Delicious!

This was really tasty. Not as strong as some other members suggested, and honestly it doesn't taste exactly like Bailey's - it's more chocolatey. The only thing I didn't add was the instant coffee because my hubby is not a coffee lover. My husband and I downed the entire pitcher in one night - I know - I have calorie remorse, lol.

I gave this 4 stars out of 5 b/c the comments in reviews were spot on (reduce whiskey and almond extract, and use combo of cream and half-n-half).  This is amazing in coffee!!!

One cup of Irish Whiskey. Added it very slowly. In fact, I DRIBBLED IT IN! But it STILL curdled. Why? Oh well. Strained the solids out and it still tasted really good. Next time, I might just buy a bottle of Bailey's.

This looks ALMOST exactly like my recipe that I've had for a long time. Only your version doesn't have the raw eggs.
And calls for whiskey, bourbon, rum etc. - your choice - I shared the recipe with someone once who read that part and put in ALL of the different choices for booze.  It was ruined, but we had a pretty good laugh.
ALSO - since I use the raw eggs, I put the bottles in the freezer or in the subzero weather if available.  It doesn't freeze solid because of the alcohol.
This is a huge favorite. Tie a bow to it with a candy cane and it's a terrific gift.

I've made this many times and it's a winner! Everyone loves it, me included, and yes, I've also used it for gift-giving in special bottles I searched for.  I highly recommend it!

This recipe is wonderful. I did put only 8 oz of Bailey's but, other than that, followed the recipe to the letter. Will definitely make again!!

Made this to give as Christmas gifts one year and everyone loved it. The only change I made was to half the whiskey- and it was plenty! I would taste it before adding the full amount. MUCH cheaper than the store bought.

This turned out surprisingly well, but holy cow, is it ever strong if you make according to the recipe!  I started with 1 1/2 cups Jameson whiskey, and that was WAAYYYY too strong for me.  I doubled the recipe keeping the 1 1/2 cups whiskey, and it's perfect.  I also used some half n half in place of some of the cream as suggested by other reviewers, and I used a mocha syrup (homemade) and omitted the coffee granules.  I also used only a tiny drop of almond for the whole 2x recipe, and I kept the mocha syrup at 2 TBS, also.  I now have 3 jars in the fridge...one for me, and 2 for gifts.  Judging from the taste now, this is definitely a keeper.  It's very good.

This was delicious, though in the future I'll probably use milk instead of cream because of the thickness.  Otherwise, this is super easy and considerably cheaper than Baileys.

This is a GREAT recipe, NEVER buy the bottled junk again!!!  amazing on its own over ice or in coffee....The reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is that it's just a little too strong with 1 2/3 cups whiskey.  I used Jameson's.  This time, I did 1 1/3 cups and it still needed to be cut with more milk or half & half.  Next time, I'll just use 1 cup.  I would recommend starting out with about 1 cup of whiskey and add more to taste!  (fyi - I'm a drinker, trust me, and it was just too strong!)  I saw other recipes using eggs, and why bother?  this recipe is perfect.  lasts about 2 weeks in the fridge, but never lasts that long.  (Check the date on your heavy cream to be sure how long yours will last though.)  Great to give in a nice bottle as a gift too.

Easy and delicious! Tastes just like the brand name Irish cream without the high price. When I saw my full blender I thought I might have made too much, then I tried it and I don't know if it will last long at all!

This was really good but I'm not sure if it tasted just like Irish Cream.  Mine wasn't too thick.  I used half the almond extract like the other reviews suggested.  I will definitely make it again.

I made this drink recently for the first time and it was lovely, but i thought it a bit too thick. I added 25% white wine and now i think it's a lot closer to the original.

I've been making a recipe similar to this for years.  The only difference was instead of the cup of heavy cream, my recipe calls for 1 cup of light cream.  Everything else was identical, down to the amounts.  I don't buy the bottled stuff any more, this is so much better.

This has been a favorite recipe of mine for years! I especially love to bring it as a gift to give to the hostess at holiday parties!  As others have suggested, I too like to reduce the amount of almond extract to about 1/4 tsp. and then add a 1/4 tsp. of coconut extract as well. PLEASE...DO NOT USE HALF AND HALF, OR MILK!  Especially not skim milk! Irish Cream is meant to be a rich, creamy, decadant drink, and in my opinion, doing that really takes away from that.  But to each his own! Also, I do usually reduce the amount of whiskey to about a cup or just a tad over that. Using the full amount listed here is fine if you like it strong!

I used Jamesons with this recipe. Maybe next time I'll use Bushmills. This recipe is very good. But on my second batch I only used one tablespoon of chocalate...used a hair less than a teaspoon of almond extract...it was a little overbearing...and a hair more than a teaspoon of coffee crystals. It was much closer to the Original Baileys. Otherwise its awesome.

YUM!  I used 2 cups of whole milk, 1 can sweetened condensed milk, cut the almond extract in half, a touch more whiskey, doubled the chocolate, vanilla and coffee, and it came out great!  Easy to tweak if you prefer a little more of less of any of the flavors. I'll never buy Bailey's in the bottle again!

Version 2:  only changes to original recipe were used 2% milk and subbed coconut extract for the almond.  Like it this way, too!

Whew...this is really good but STRONG!!!and i cut back the whiskey to 1 1/2c. The flavor is great as is. I definitely would NOT susbstitute milk or 1/2/1/2 either as you need the richness to make this work. I took it to a church irish dinner and boy was it a hit.

MMmmmmmm!  I did cut the whiskey amount to only 1 1/2 cups but it still turned out great.  We kept in a canning jar and shook up before using.  Was delicious on the rocks and in coffee.

This was a great substitute for an expensive bottle or Irish Cream. It was gone before nightfall. It is strong but perfect for coffee or bottom bouncers.

The flavor in this is truly amazing.  I cut the whiskey in half, as others have suggested.  This makes it -very- thick, but I left it that way until serving.  For coffee we cut it with milk and when serving on the rocks, we added whiskey / milk to the persons taste.  Some like it stronger than others :-)

Oh my, I just sampled my double batch.  I think less whiskey.  I used Bushmill's and it's pretty dang strong.  I guess after a 2nd service, it'll be just right.  I'm seeing mixed reviews on quantity of whiskey.... I think I'll need to cut this with more of the non-alcoholic ingredients.

Next time I'll try this exactly as written, with the heavy cream. It was too thin with half and half, and not as creamy as I would have liked. I also used cheap alcohol, and I think this make a difference, too. I really like the other recipe on here what uses non-dairy creamer and raw eggs. That gets 5 stars from me!

OUTSTANDING!! i used about 2 1/2 cups of Jameson and left out the instant coffee and it was a giant success! It's become a Christmas morning tradition - even grandma loves it in her coffee!

made this exactly according to the recipe except i used only one cup of a cheap canadien whiskey. next time i think i'll cut the chocolate syrup by half. made a double batch, yielding about 64 oz. cost was roughly $14.00 vs. $30.00+ for baileys. i used a rinsed out 64 oz. juice jug for a container. maybe a tequila rose next time ?

Was a huge hit at my St Patrick's Day party last year.  Instead of using condensed milk and vanilla extract, I just used vanilla milk and got no complaints.  Having another gathering again this year and that's all my guests are requesting.

Bushmill's & Bailey's is a holiday tradition in my family anyway, so I was really excited to come across this recipe.  I don't have almond extract in the cupboard, but even without it this was oh so yummy!

Excellent..I followed others advice and reduced the almond extract.. The second time I also reduced the condensed Milk by 1/3 because I found it too sweet...
This is a GREAT recipe..just adjust to your taste!

This is excellent. I added a bit too much chocolate syrup which made a big difference. Stick with the two tablespoons and you'll be happy. This one is a keeper.

As listed, there is way WAY too much whiskey in this.  We made a two batch using "Maker's Mark" whiskey and Crown Royal.  The first batch we cut it back to just one cup of MM whiskey and it was WAY too strong.  The second batch we used just 1/3 cup of CR whiskey and mixed it with the MM batch.  Total, as listed, we would have used 3 1/3 C whiskey.  We only used 1 1/3 for a double batch.  I also added some milk since it was so thick, probably because it's missing 2 C of the alcohol it originally called for.   The flavor is pretty good though, so three stars from me.

Following up to my previous review - after chilling in the refrigerator for several hours, the Irish Cream got thicker.  I think half & half worked out terrific!

I made this last year for Christmas presents and it was a HUGE hit, so I am making it again. I use no fat, low fat, and  this year I went with a less expensive whiskey, as recommended.  It is really hard to go wrong with this.

This is so delicious.  I whipped up a batch, following the directions exactly, to make hubby some Irish Car Bombs.  It tastes so much fresher than the bottled stuff.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Think I'll use less chocolate syrup next time. It was good but the chocolate syrup made it taste of cinnamon? Something wasn't quite right but it was still good with coffee or a B52. I'll make it again.
