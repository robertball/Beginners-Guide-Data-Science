The directions say to not grease the pan. I followed directions and the entire mix stuck to the bottom of my glass pan. After unsuccessfully trying to scrape the mass off my pan, I ended up throwing away a perfectly good pan! This recipe is a waste of both time and ingredients. Better try another bar cookie recipe.

Good recipe.  I refrigerated over night after baking(cooled first) then they were easy to cut and did not fall apart.
