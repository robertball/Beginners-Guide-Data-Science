I'm giving this recipe 4 stars when it's made as written.  It's good and very nutritious, but it's a little bland.  However, the second time I made it I used two 15 ounce cans of diced tomatoes with basil, garlic, and oregano, and that gave the dish the flavor kick that it needed.  With that change, I might give this recipe 5 stars.

Very tasty! Easy to prepare. Next time I will add mushrooms, onions and red pepper flakes. It was a hit in my house!

I'd make this for company.  I combined this recipe with the instructions for "Suki's spinach and feta pasta" which is almost the same recipe.  I used a 6 oz. bag of baby spinach that I washed & chopped & also used whole wheat penne.  I sauteed the garlic for just a little while 1st.  I added salt & pepper & also added 1/2 a pound of defrosted shrimp, just to warm it up, before adding the pasta & feta cheese (I happened to have plain feta in the frig).  If you keep stirring the mixture at the end, the feta melts & the sauce gets an orangy, creamy texture.  I also put red pepper flakes on the table, if someone wanted even more zip.  I'll try 3/4 of a cup of feta next time as my husband thought the feta had a strong taste, although I loved it & we finished the whole dish.

Excellent!  I took the previous suggestion and used whole wheat penne and reduced fat feta.  Turned out fabulous.  Will make again!

I tried this recipe this week.  It was amazing. Made a few changes.  Added a few more cloves of garlic, some balsamic vinegar and thyme to the tomatoe/spinach mixture. Grilled up some chicken breast and cut it up in there.  It was amazing and I will definitely make it again.

This meal was boring and tasteless. Had I known sooner, I would have been prepared with some basil pesto and plenty of Parmesan cheese to liven it up with. Also, the addition of 1 Tbls. garlic salt would be an improvement.

This was great!  I used 1 package of frozen spinach, 1 can of whole tomatoes (I diced them), 5 cloves garlic, 1 cup of feta, and 1 cup dried Parmesan cheese.  Tasty!  Definetely a keeper.  Thanks!

My family loved the blend of flavors in this recipe.  I added some pine nuts as suggested by another reviewer, and we enjoyed the new texture it added to the other ingredients.  We will make this again and again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great dish, but I changed some of the amounts.  I used twice as much pasta, one 14.5 oz. can of chopped tomatoes with onions, and only about 3 oz. of feta.  I really liked the taste.  I'm not sure I would use the entire 8 oz. of feta even if I had it, because mine was salty enough.  Next time I won't drain my tomatoes, as the dish was a bit dry (but I did double the pasta, so I don't know what I expected!).  I love pasta but I was getting tired of the same old tomato sauce- this will definitely become a staple in my house.

Wow.  I used two large garlic cloves instead of 1, then I added 1 whole can of "La San Marzano" tomatoes (once you have had these you will never buy anything else) and I used only 4 oz of Macedonia Feta (extra creamy Feta) and added 1/4 cup of homemade pesto. 6 strips of crumbled crisp bacon.  I don't really like Penn I find it too big & rubbery so I replaced it with a medium Fricelli pasta, it's small rolled ovals.  Some of them open up when cooked.  I added the cooked pasta and spinach and cooed it until the spinach was just wilted.  Believe me there was nothing boring about this meal, it was amazing.

I've been making a version of this for years.  I add some red chili pepper flakes to the oil and garlic for a touch of heat.  In addition, I add shredded chicken, which I generally keep in my refrigerator.  Top this with some parmesan cheese and you have a yummy, yummy meal!

I've been making this recipe for years and it really is delicious both hot or cold.  We usually have it as a cold salad in the summer when the tomatoes are at their peak.  You can easily substitute thawed frozen spinach for fresh -- it still tastes fine although it isn't quite as pretty.  Plain feta cheese also works well in place of the tomato basil feta.  I usually add another clove of garlic and 1/3 to 1/2 cup of toasted walnuts or pine nuts for a little more texture and flavor.

I cooked garlic first with some shrimp, then added italian herb tomatoes and spinach.  Added some crushed red pepper for heat and some Mrs. Dash.  I also used garlic and herb feta.  Loved it!

I made this for supper last night and got rave reviews from both my husband and son.  It was so fast and easy to make and the taste and texture were excellent. The only change I made was to the feta - I couldn't find tomato basil feta so bought garlic feta.  We will definitely be having this recipe again and again!

I love this pasta. I use a can of italian style chopped tomatoes and this gives it a wonderful taste. I use the spiral pasta as it seems to hold onto some of the ingrediets better.

Can I give this a six star rating?   This recipe was of high-end restaurant quality (perfect to impress a date with), not to mention easy, easy, easy!  I added more garlic - triple to be exact - have to scare off the vampires don't you know - and an onion, as one review indicated it was a bit bland.   I used shell noodles, and it worked wonderfully.  It was simply gorgeous! I can't wait to make it again.

I love this recipe, I make it whenever I want a quick dinner.  I've substituted basil leaves for spinach, and added zucchini which always works well.  Using fresh pasta makes it even faster.  It did take a couple of tries to know how long to cook the tomatoes for the best sauce consistency, but shorter (3-5 min) is definitely best!

What a delicious and colorful recipe. Since fresh tomatoes aren't at their best this time of year, I substituted a large can of diced tomatoes. Also, following the suggestion of another reviewer and added 6 slices of cooked and crumbled bacon.

I just made this recipe - I didn't have pine nuts which I think would be a great addition, but I used about 7 cloves of fresh minced garlic and I used canned diced tomatoes with the juice because I was in a hurry. With the addition of the tomato-basil feta cheese I did not even have to add much salt. It is absolutely incredible, great flavor and another recipe I will make over and over again!

As is, I can imagine that the pasta would taste dry. I added some light cream and allowed the feta to melt to create more of a sauce and it was a tasty pasta dish!

Delicious, easy to make. Sometimes I can't find tomato basil feta so I buy regular feta and season it with garlic and its also just as good. I could eat this once a week.

This is a good base recipe, but not spectacular on it's own.  Needs more spices.  I took the suggestion if using canned diced tomatoes with basil.  I think next time I'll add more fresh basil, an onion and probably some asparagus.  I also felt a need to add some sun dried tomatoes.

I'm assuming that if I liked spinach I would like the recipe as written so that's why I give 5 stars. This was my base recipe and from there it grew into something so amazing that if I told you how to make it I'd have to kill you.

Yummy! I also added sun dried tomatoes that gave it a nice kick and really complemented the feta. I also added some left over zucchini I had in the fridge. Next time I will add some grilled chicken to make it more of a meal than a side dish. Quick, easy, and healthy... just the way we like it in my house!

I'm giving this 4 stars mostly because the prep is so darn easy. I followed other reviewer's suggestions and added 1 can of organic diced tomatoes along with 2 fresh romas. I also was concerned that this dish would be bland based on other's reviews so I did add a few shakes of Italian seasoning and balsamic vinegar. I also used garlic salt instead of minced garlic. Next time I think I'll omit the balsamic, add some sliced black olives and use bigger pasta (I used piccolini because it was what I had on hand). Very healthy and a good way to eat your spinach.

This is so easy, so healthy and delicious.  I used fat free feta as recommended by others, increased the garlic to 3 cloves ( one can never have too much fresh garlic) and found it unnecessary to chop the spinach (just dump it in and save scores of time).  I was very pleased and to quote my husband who has a discriminating palate, " ....this is definately a home run!"
I can see throwing in some grilled chicken or shrimp to make a hearty crowd pleasing meal.

The best pasta I have ever made!  Thanks for such a delicious recipe.  I used whole wheat pasta and added some olives and red pepper flakes to spice it up a little.

Excellent.  Along with other viewers I also only used 4 oz. of feta and increased my cooking time to cook out some of the water.  I also increased the garlic to 2 cloves.  Delicious!  Thanks.

Sorry to disagree - and we hate to seem picky - but wow was this just NOT a keeper.  This is the ONLY recipe I've ever gotten from here that I'd call out and out *bad* - the only one who seemed to like it was the 2 year old - and the ingredients separately are all things we adore.   Way too many good things to do with tomato basil feta cheese.  Sorry!

What a wonderfully, delicious recipe!  It was incredibly simple and ready in under a half hour. I will be making this repeatedly, for sure! Thanks so much Cathy :)

I made slight changes :I doubled the pasta to 16 ounces (dry) and I used Garlic & Herb Feta instead.

I love how easy it was to make this! The only real work I had to do was chopping the tomatoes - everything else just got thrown in a pot. I had meant to halve the entire recipe, but I only remembered to do it with the pasta and feta. Actually it worked out really great and now I get extra veggies. :)

Silly me.  I stopped and bought some spinach and mushrooms, thinking I had everything else already.  I used a can of diced tomatoes, garlic powder, some onion flakes, but the big change was the Feta.  My big box of Feta had mold, so I had to improvise.  I added a cup or so of shredded chedder and about a half cup of turkey sausage.  Awesome.  That Pinot Gris that was recommended was great, too.  Nice combo.

Delicious, easy meal!  I used feta with garlic and herbs by mistake one time when I made it and I actually think it is even better.  This recipe has been put in regular rotation in my house.

This is great.  I find it's much better to use canned diced tomatoes in sauce rather than fresh tomatoes.  It's too bland otherwise.  I also increase the garlic.

I omitted the olive oil and added 8 oz mushrooms sauteed in about 4 tbsp of vegetable broth until tender.  I used a little bit more garlic too.  I tried this with 8 oz Feta cheese as the recipe states, but another time tried it with a 4 oz package of light Boursin cheese, about a third of a cup shredded fontina cheese, and maybe a tablespoon of grated fresh romano.  I think I liked the second way a little better.  Hot, the recipe tastes a little bland no matter how I make it.  Cold, it's an excellent pasta salad.

Made this recipe for my mom and we both loved it!  I used whole wheat rotini noodles and added kalamata olives which both worked really well.  The olives really added a lot to the meal.  Quick, healthful, and easy.  We'll be making this again!

Very tasty. I used 2 cans of diced Mexican tomatoes     in place of fresh  tomatoes. Also added shrimp meat, but chicken or some other meat would have been good. This was a nice all in one meal.

This is a delish one-pot dish.  I have made this several times now.  We love it.  I've gotten rave reviews every time I make it.  The only change I make is to add one can of diced tomatoes with garlic and oregano along with 2 diced fresh tomatoes.  Love the fact that this is so easy and I can make it using only one pot.  I added cooked sliced hot sausage one time just to take it up a notch.  It also accompanied grilled chicken breast nicely another time.  Thank you for another wonderfully easy recipe.

This was delicious! 

After I chopped up the tomatoes, I coated them with some olive oil and italian seasonsing.

I also added some grilled chicken as well.

Loved this!!  Definitely, a keeper.  I don't care for Feta cheese so I substitued shredded Parmesan.  I used canned diced tomatoes/sweet onion and added a small can of sliced black olives -- soooo good! My daughter was here and she loved it, as well. She can't wait to make it for her family.

Delicious! I used 2 cups pico de gallo I had left over added to the 1 cup diced tomatoes and added 6 oz of southwestern style corn and used only 3/4 of the feta but did add 1/4 mozzarella. Think we're definitely going to fight over the leftovers. I'll definitely make this again~

Dinner for 5, for $8:-)

Subbed canned diced toms with basil, garlic & oregano, used frozen spinach, 2 cloves garlic and plain feta. Husband thumbed his nose at it for no shrimp or chicken, but once it was made, LOVED IT;-) Easily worth five stars the way I made it, and know it would be even better with fresh produce as stated in the recipe.

One of my absolute favorites especially in the summer when the tomatoes are ripe!  So easy!  Try it with a pinch of red pepper flakes for a bit of a kick!

Great recipe, didn't want to give it a "5" since I tweaked a couple things. I used 4-5 cloves of garlic to really pump up the flavor. I also added chiken broth when I was sauteeing the tomatos and garlic, I didn't want the "sauce" to be too dry. It was great because the pasta was cooked al dente and absorbed all the yummy sauce when I combined it. I served it with some shredded romano on top. This will be going into my regular rotation.

Yum!! This was excellent!

I peeled my tomatoes first, as I don't like when my tomatoes cook and the peel seperates. I also added a handful of whole, pitted olives, a dash of red pepper flakes, and 1 tablespoon of balsamic vinegar. All the ingredients go together so well and nothing is overpowering. VERY good. Round this meal off with a salad and breadsticks and you can't go wrong.

Thanks for the recipe!!

This is soooo good.  We added 6 strips of  crumbled bacon and sliced, sauteed mushrooms to all of the other ingredients at the end. It would also be wonderful without the bacon.  The seasoned feta cheese really makes this recipe.  Since hubby and I are big spinach lovers I will add more fresh spinach next time. Thanks for the recipe.  Of course the kids were "scared" of it.

My family loves this recipe and my mom requests this on her birthday!  Be sure to use plenty of spinach and tomatoes as it cooks down.  I use way more than 1 clove of garlic and also add parmesan cheese at the end.  Delicious and looks very pretty!

I absolutely LOVE this recipe as is!  I've made it a few times.  It is perfect for a working couple: Easy to make and we don't have TONS of leftovers.  

Tonight I think I'm going to make it again but with a little canned chicken this time.  We'll see how it turns out.

Pretty tasty starter recipe! I tripled the amount of garlic but I am some what of a garlic fiend. I also threw in some mushrooms which added a tasty extra. I think next time I will wait and add the feta after everything else has cooled a bit so it doesn't get too melted. Will definitely make again!

Love this recipe.  I used regular feta cheese, sundried tomatoes and 2 cloves of garlic and lots of fresh basil.  Also marinated chicken breast in italian dressing, grilled, sliced and added it to the dish.  Awesome......I'll be making this one again.  Mary Rose

This recipe is one of the best I've ever tasted.  You can easily make it healthier by reducing the cheese just a little, adding a diced red pepper, increasing the tomatoes and putting in about 1/3 more spinach.  I would highly recommend using grape tomatoes along with regular tomatoes as they add a nice acidity to the dish.

Oh, on top of adding veggies I included about 1/2 cup of chopped pecans, and a teaspoon of red pepper flakes.  Little heat makes this dish 5 stars!

So easy & good!  After reading the reviews, I used canned tomatoes with Italian herbs, added more garlic, sautéing some in the pot, and garnished with red pepper flakes.  Oh, and my grocery store was out of tomato basil feta so I used the garlic & herb feta.  I also added chicken.  DEFINITELY will make again!

We loved this! I had about a cup of leftover mushrooms which I sauteed first with the garlic before adding the rest as per recipe. We cannot get basil feta locally, so I also added a bunch of fresh, chopped basil. Just delicious!  Will be making it again and again! Added bonus that it is so quick and easy.  Thanks for this one!

This was good meatless meal. I did use tomatoes with oregano, basil and garlic which did give it more flavor. Fresh cracked pepper to taste will spice it up more. Overall, an excellent dish.

I added sundried tomatoes, a can of tomatoed w/basil, garlic and oregano, and about a 1/4tsp crushed red pepper. Then I added about 1/2c dry white wine. I also added carrots and snap peas. This just gave it more flavor. The family loved it. I have a hard time fallowing a reciepe. I have to give it my own twist.

This is a little bland as written. I used canned diced tomatoes as fresh tomatoes are out of season. It definitely tasted better after it sat for several minutes and the pasta soaked up some of the flavors. I would also suggest adding in some balsamic vinegar to liven it up.

Great and flavorful with a few changes.:-)  I added more garlic, basil, oregano, and red pepper flakes as suggested by some.  Very simple and easy for a weekday meal and is a nice fresh change from spagetti sauce.  Even my 2 1/2 yr old enjoyed it- thanks!

I made this with whole wheat pasta, canned italian tomatoes, fat free feta, mushrooms and fresh spinach. Instead of using the oil, I wilted the spinach in the hot pasta and then stirred in everything else. Can't believe I forgot the garlic.  Very tasty and versatile.

So Yummy & So Easy!  Only changes I made were to add a couple cloves of garlic & a pinch of red pepper flakes as recommended by other reviews.  It was a big hit @ my house & even though the recipe says serves 6, the 3 of us had no problem finishing the whole pot!

My husband is very picky and he loved it. Had 2 servings and for him that's rare. I added basil garlic and oregano seasoned tomatoes as suggested to the recipe otherwise I would have given it 5 stars. You bet I will be making this again.

Delightful! I found this through the 'ingredients' option because I had an odd collection of stuff and needed a quick supper. I down-sized a bit, added a center cut pork chop cut into thin bite sized slices and some fresh oregano from the garden and it made a complete supper for two. Definite keeper!

I tried this recipe last night and it was a hit. I made a few changes though, I started with 3 cloves of garlic and a chopped onion and simmered that with a can of chopped plum tomatoes (with very little of the liquid). I used a little bit of red pepper flakes for flavour and about 5 minutes before serving I added chopped basil. I served it with grilled chicken, regular feta and toasted pine nuts. It was very tasty, and I loved the freshness and the colour of the dish, I'll certainly make it again.

I made this the other night with ingredients I had on hand:  2 cans of petit chopped tomatoes, drained (instead of fresh) and ziti instead of mostaccioli. I also increased the garlic to 3 cloves. This dish turned out wonderful! It was very flavorful, and pretty, too. I served it as a side to a concoction of cooked Italian sausage with red peppers, onions and minced garlic (stir fried in EVOO).  My husband actually topped his pasta with the sausage mixture and enjoyed his "one dish" meal. This recipe is definitely a keeper! Thanks for submitting.

Great base recipe.. I used what I had on hand: fresh spinach, grape tomatoes, whole wheat penne and 4 oz of chevre. I feel like 8 oz would've been way too much.  I also added a bit of salt and pepper to the sauteed veggies, and cooked the garlic by itself for a bit before adding in the tomatoes, then the spinach. Also, I didnt cook the penne all the way- about a minute short, then saute with the spinach mix, i think it adds a bit more flavor to the pasta.

I served this hot as a side dish with an Italian meal...two thumbs up!!  My company liked it...even the 7 year old cleaned his plate.  I only used 4 oz. feta, and thought it was plenty.  I used the fresh tomato and sauteed the veggies a little longer than called for.  It's a keeper!

I love spinach and cheese and this dish definitely satisfied my tastes!  I was a little worried at first when I put everything together and it was very watery from the tomatoes so I let it simmer about twice the recommended time and then let it sit for about 7-10 minutes with the pot covered and the sauce thickened up nicely.  Next time I'll double the spinach.  Also I used garlic and cumin flavored feta because I couldn't find tomato and basil but with the tomatoes already in the dish, it might have been overkill anyways.  I say that using regular feta or another type of flavor is a better bet.  I give this my highest ratings of 4-stars!

I made this recipe for my dad's birthday and my family loved it! Very simple but the spinach and feta really add something. I love the way the feta sort of melts into the sauce a little- it wasn't as overpowering as I expected. This has become one of my family's staples.

Very good, relatively healthy recipe.  I used fresh spinach since it's so good for you and really enhances this recipe.  I also added crumbled bacon and Tony Chacheres cajun seasoning.  Good stuff.

This was wonderful!  I didn't have fresh tomatoes so I used two cans chopped tomatoes, drained.  Used a little more garlic and olive oil, and added a splash of chicken broth, and some crushed red pepper.  Hubby loved it too, and claimed it a keeper!

This was great!  My husband who claims not to like spinach really liked it and so did my three-year old.  I added chicked for some added protein.  Thanks Cathy.

I loved this as a light main meal, but my husband wasn't too thrilled with it. We had left overs the next day and had it as a salad and he liked it a lot better that way. Served it at room temperature, not icy cold as the salad and it worked very well

This pasta dish was great!  I too love all the ingredients, but had never put them all together before (especially the feta and spinach).  It was super easy and sooo very tasty for the entire family, even the kids.  The only change I made was to add extra garlic just because we are garlic lovers to the extreme.  Excellent!

I couldn't find the tomato-basil feta, so just coated regular feta in basil. Also used 2 cans diced tomatoes with the juice. Very fresh taste. May try with shrimp next time. Used 5 cloves garlic, but could still use a little more ooomph!

Delicious!  I added pinenuts w/ the garlic and basil and olives at the very end (as was suggested by other reviews) and my boyfriend had cleaned his plate before I even sat down!  Also exceptionally easy to make - great for a quick, tasty dinner.

This recipe was rather on the bland side.  It was good but there just wasn't a zest to it.  I think next time I will add some fresh basil and parsley and maybe a little more feta cheese.  However it is a nice fast and easy meal.

My husband is a huge meat lover but he did not care that the meat was missing once he tasted this dish.  We found it to be flavourful and filling.  Great with ceasar salad and french stick.  I would make this easy and tasty meal time and time again.

One of the most flavorful pasta dishes I've had- and very easy once you deal with the preparation of chopping up all the spinach! Keeps well, if you have any leftovers. Add some chicken, too!

I made this for dinner and it was very good.  Of course I can't ever leave a recipe alone so I used more garlic and I added some oregano, crushed red peppers and balsamic vinegar in with the tomato/spinach mixture.  I also had some mozzarella  on hand I needed to use up so I cubed it and stirred it in at the end.  This recipe was very good and you could use any vegetable mixture and also add grilled chicken breast if you like.

This recipe is absolutely delicious. I did not find tomato basil feta cheese so I used Apetina Danish Feta with Herbs & Spices, and I did not use as much tomato as requested, but it was still great. I served it with Meat Balls a la Tim. My husband was thrilled!

This was good. A little bland. I left out the tomatoes and added mozzarella cheese and prego sauce because my boyfriend said it was too dry.

Yummy! I did add 2 cans tomatoes with basil instead of the chopped tomatoes, 3 garlic cloves and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese with a sprinkling of red pepper flakes as suggested by others.  Oh and I did not chopped my spinach.

Very good!!
We added onion and black olives to an, already, excellent recipe.
We used frozen spinach, rinsed in hot water and drained well (tight budget), and it was still great!
Served with breadsticks, still a low Weight Watchers Points meal!!

My entire family loved this!  I made the following ingredient modifications: an entire package of whole wheat penne, 2 - 14.5 oz. cans of diced tomatos with garlic, basil & oregano.  I cooked 3 cloves of garlic in oil for a few, then added the spinach, then added the canned tomatos after the spinach was wilted.  I cooked it altogether till the tomatos were nice and hot.  After that, I tossed it in with the pasta and a couple ounces of feta.  I let that cook for about a minute until the feta had metled, then sprinkled a couple more ounces of feta on top, stirred and served.

It was really good, but I made a fair amount changes as well, after reading reviews that it needed more flavor. I added more garlic (about four cloves) and red pepper flakes, as well as used the whole wheat penne.

I also added meat, by seasoning chicken with garlic powder, fresh basil leaves, red pepper flakes, seasoning salt and pepper, and smothered in 1/2 jar seasoned spaghetti sauce, baking for 13 minutes. It added great flavor to the dish.

Now one of my all time favorite pasta dishes! I was very liberal with the spinach and tomatoes, and also added a bit of extra garlic. I didn't even want to add salt and pepper which is rare for me. Very healthy, simple, and inexpensive!

This recipe is delicious. The person that commented that it would be good with chicken added is absolutely right but with the simple ingredients that have been posted it works. The only thing that I actually added to it was 1/4 onion because it seemed right. I would most definitely make this recipe again and can't wait to make it for company.

Easy to make and tasty with some minor adjustments as some reviewers suggested.  2-15 oz cans of diced tomatoes with basil, oregano and garlic. I used all 8 ounces of  feta and about 10 oz of penne.  I added 1 Tbsp of Italian seasoning and 1/2 cup of dry parmesean  cheese and added chipotle seasoning (contained red pepper flakes), as well as the pine nuts.  Very tasty! Next time I'll try it with shrimp and mushrooms.

Wow was this tasty.  I did add a lot more garlic because I'm a garlic fan.  Also added onions and orange sweet peppers and used whole wheat penne to make it more nutritional.  When the noodles were cooked, I stirred in a heaping tablespoon of pesto.  I will make this again, many times I'm sure.

I have been making this for years, it is awesome. I brown the fresh garlic in olive oil, add red pepper flakes, a can of petite diced tomatoes, and either fresh chopped spinach or frozen chopped. Don't over cook or the spinach loses it's bright green color. Cook and drain the pasta toss with the tomato mixture and top with feta cheese. I do not add salt feta has enough of it's own. Enjoy this easy meal in a hurry!

I enjoyed this recipe, however I decided to make it my own way. I used whole wheat pasta, regular feta cheese, and I also added some onion, garlic and mushrooms along with the spinach and tomatos.  I would definitely make this again and am excited that I have leftovers to eat tomorrow!

I thought that this recipe was pretty good. I added 14 oz of pasta but kept the sauce proportions mostly the same- maybe that is why I couldn't give this recipe 4 stars. Maybe it would've been better with more sauce. 

I was making this for my own family and a neighbor who had just had a baby so I kept wanting to add something at the end because it didn't seem quite right to me. In the end, I added a 1/4 c. of Colby Jack Cheese and 5 strips worth of chopped (cooked) turkey bacon. The last addition gave it some crunch and a little more flavor. I think I will make this again when I have more fresh spinach to use up.

The five stars is for the modifications taken from previous reviews.

I used 12 oz pasta, 2 cans Italian chopped tomatoes, 5 oz. spinach and 4 oz package basil, pine nuts, 1 tsp. garlic salt, 1.5 tsp. red chili flakes.

Delicious!

Fantastic! I used too little spinach (did 5 oz. by volume, not weight - whoops!), halved the oil but used full-fat feta (due to refrigerator constraints), and a smidge extra garlic. Yummy.

I used canned fire-roasted diced tomatoes and left out the garlic, since the tomatoes were already seasonsed.  Whole wheat penne pasta, 1/2 reduced fat feta and 1/2 basil tomato feta. It was DELICIOUS.  Great side dish, or might add some cannellini beans for a wonderful main dish for my vegetarian daughter.

I enjoyed this recipe and I think others did as well, but even following many of the suggestions to add flavor, it still needed more.  The women seemed to enjoy it much more than our meat-craving men.  My husband finished the dish but asked not to have it again.  One thing worth noting is that this recipe feeds 5 people.  We didn't trust it and doubled it to feed our 6 but it makes much more than we expected.  :)

This was very good, I also threw in some mushrooms and cut asparagus. And I used fresh basil and regular feta cheese. Will definitely make again and so easy!

Didn't use feta.  Added hot pepper oil and sun dried tomatoes, asparagus.  Really good and quick.

This recipe turned out great, although I have to admit that I made a couple of changes, not because the recipe needed them at all!  I had some mushrooms that needed to be used up and had taken out some shrimp not knowing what I was going to do with them.  So, I incorporated both into this recipe.  I sauteed the mushrooms and garlic first and then continued with the recipe.  Used a 28oz can of diced tomatoes and probably only 6oz of spinach since I had added mushrooms.  I also only had regular (light) feta, so went with that, adding some when called for and then a bit more at the end when serving.  I also added my shrimps during the last 5 minutes or so (they were cooked already).  Hubby  and I both really enjoyed!

Delicious, this one is definitely going in my recipe box!  I did make a few changes, based on what I had at home.  I used one 28 oz can of diced tomatoes, draining some of the liquid, and 10 oz of frozen chopped spinach, which I microwaved before adding.  I also used a 6 oz container of regular crumbled Feta and added a couple shakes of crushed red pepper flakes.  Very yummy!

Quick & Easy, Flavorful, Healthy. What's not to like?

This is a great way to use feta, though I didn't have the specific type of feta specified by the original recipe (neither do most people I suspect). I wonder how that affects flavor. 

Very delicious, easy to add ingredients to if you like, this is a wonderful recipe.

I was really impressed by how easy this was to make, the very little time it took from stove to table (20 min including boiling water while I read to my son) and it tasted great.   I did make changes according to what I had at hand.  I had less than a 5oz bag of spinach, I used whole wheat penne, 3 cloves of garlic, 2 fresh tomatoes and one can of diced tomatoes and I only had a 6oz tub of plain feta.

This was delicious and is so quick and easy to make.  My husband went back for seconds and kept telling me how good it was in between bites. lol  
I used only 4 ounces of feta and thought that was plenty.  I can't wait to try this cold.

I made this for an Italian-themed dinner with several friends and it was a hit. I doubled the recipe, but used the same amount of spinach and olive oil, and I used bow-tie pasta because that's what I had on hand. I will definitely make this again.

I modified this recipe slighlty so it would be similar to a dish I recently had at an Italian restaurant.  I used chopped sundried tomatoes in place of the fresh tomatoes.  I used fresh baby spinach that I added at the very end and cooked until the leaves wilted slightly.  I also added pine nuts.  I used regular feta instead of the flavored feta and I increased the amount of garlic.  It was very easy and delicious!

I added artickoke hearts and red peppers to the mix - it was very good.  The tomatoes seemed to get a little too done, so I would add the tomatoes seperately from the rest of the mix until the spinach is about done wilting.  I might use canned diced flavored tomatoes next time.

This is a nice quick recipe. My husband wanted to give it 3 stars but I enjoyed it more than he did so it gets 4 from me. He would have rather had a chicken broth base. We added a lot of garlic salt to kick it up a little. I will most likely make this again some time.

The spinach gives this a bitter twang.  My husband and I loved it, but I doubt many of our picky-eating friends would.  I'll make this again.  I especially loved how fresh everything was.

This was a super dorm room dinner! We only needed one pot and it was wonderful, fresh-tasting, and relatively inexpensive.

Tastes good and is very easy.  Even our 2 yr old son enjoyed it.  We substituted Elbow Macaroni for the Penne, and while it was good, would look more visually appealing with the Penne!

i second the suggestion to add pinenuts in when sauteeing the garlic & i used more garlic than called for but i'm a big garlic fan. also found that the recipe needed more tomatoes, but the tomatoes i used may have been on the small side.

This recipe was just OK.  We subsituted ravioli for the mostaccioli and it still wasn't that flavorful.  If you're looking for a good tomato and pasta recipe I recommend "Cheese Ravioli with Fresh Tomato and Artichoke Sauce"

I was psyched about trying this recipe after reading the rave reviews. I have never tried feta cheese before , so this was going to be an experience. I must say that at first bite, I was not impressed. But, as it sat on my plate for a minute ot two, the flavors really began to meld into something I was very pleased with. I prepared this for dinner tonight and will prbably make again. I may actually become a fan a feta --who knows :).

Tastes great, and so simple to make!  I added onions and mushrooms, and used canned whole tomatoes instead of fresh.  I thought the feta was a bit strong by itself, next time I will reduce the amount of feta and add some cream cheese.

Loved it!  I ate a similar dish at a restaurant, and was looking for a similar recipe.  This tasted just as good as the one in the restaurant!  I used bow-tie pasta instead of the penne, and used reduced fat feta instead of the full fat.  The reduced fat is, obviously, less fattening, and is also less salty in case you have any picky eaters.  Great dish, will make again!

We used whole wheat penne and loved it.  Was even better warmed up as leftovers.  My 14 year old daughter loved it.  This is a keeper.
