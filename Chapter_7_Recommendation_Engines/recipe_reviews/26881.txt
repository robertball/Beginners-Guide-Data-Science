This became an instant favorite at our home. I use chicken breast strips, rather than wings, to lower the fat content. It's just hot and spicy enough to satisfy that urge for Mexican food. I shake it up in a zip lock bag, and then immediately freeze the rest of the mixture until next time.

This buffalo chicken wings were so easy to make and so wonderful tasting. The whole family enjoyed; they make great appetizers and also a meal served over salad greens with your favorite ranch dressing!

I served this with a dip made of sour cream hot salsa and a tablespoon of the taco mix. This appetizer was very easy to prepare and evey one
loved it. I would make it again.  Noreen

I made this recipe for my Cinco de Mayo party and it was a hit, expecially with the guys. It went in a flash and its so easy to make. You just shake and bake.
