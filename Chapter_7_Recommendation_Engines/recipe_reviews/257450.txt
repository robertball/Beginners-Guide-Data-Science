This was very easy to put together. Some of the other reviews noted the breading came off in the oil. My solution was to double dredge, and it worked perfectly.

I've been looking for a good recipe for scallops and I now think I have my go-to! Unfortunately I did not have any buttermilk so needed to use milk and lemon juice.  I added just a bit of corn starch to the flour.  It had the right amount of seasoning. Frying time was right on the mark. Excellent recipe!!! Thank you MBeau!!!

These were good but I did have trouble with the breading staying on. I fried them in a skillet but I think they would have worked better in a deep fryer. The entire scallop submerged in hot oil would have helped seize up the breading faster which would also prevent overcooking. Just my opinion.  I do all of my deep frying outside to keep the smell out of the house but it was pouring down rain so I was forced to skillet fry. I made half of these as written but for the other half I added some Old Bay to the seasoned flour. The addition of Old Bay bumps these from a 4 star to a 5. Overall good and simple recipe and one I will definitely make again.

These were actually delicious. The only problem the breading did fall off while being deep fried. But the taste was outstanding, my husband loved them, and I will make again.
