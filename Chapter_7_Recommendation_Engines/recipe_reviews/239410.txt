I made these simple and tasty egg rolls for the first time in August, 2013 and I cannot count the times I have made them since that date. Microwaving the coleslaw mix prior to combining with the other ingredients creates a more compact filling and a full egg roll. Sometimes, I use about 1/2 cup of cooked sausage or ham instead of the shrimp. I always make a mixture of about 1 Tablespoon of flour mixed with 1 Tablespoon of water to seal the top corner of the Nasoya wrappers. I place four or five of the egg rolls in my deep fryer at 375 degrees for about 3 minutes. They fry to a nice golden color - so crispy and delicious! Thank you, WFDM for sharing your 5 star recipe and I am glad it has received Allrecipes kitchen approval.

I've made these egg rolls a few times now, didn't realize the recipe had been published. I've made them with just veggies, chicken and shrimp. I don't have a deep fryer, so fried them in a pan and usually bake them. I bake them on my stone pan at 375° for 25-30 minutes, until the start to turn golden brown. I do brush them with vegetable oil first.

ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!  I made this for the recipe group and was so happy it got chosen.  This was so easy to make and took little time.  I fried all the egg rolls and intend to freeze what is left over from lunch.  This way, I can pop them in the microwave for an evening snack without messing with oil.  Thank you WFDM for sharing your recipe!   You have a winner!

Recipe Group: Simple and Tasty is right! I had some cabbage to use up, so I chopped it fine and subbed for the coleslaw mix. I added an onion and a green pepper to the cabbage before nuking. Once out of the microwave, I added a small handful of finely chopped mushrooms and some minced ginger, and left out the shrimp. I used only half the black pepper called for and still found it to be too much for my taste (and DS could not finish his). I convect baked at 425 for 10 minutes, flipped and went another 10 minutes, and they were perfectly done (not as good as deep frying, to be sure, but I wasn't in the mood to haul out the fryer). Thanks WFDM for sharing your recipe!

These egg rolls are so simple to make and SOOOOO DELICIOUS! I have to admit that I have made these a few times (or more) before, and they are a HUGE hit with the family. I've even made and froze these w/ great results. These are a family favorite~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

These are great egg rolls. I haven't eaten egg rolls in over 6 years due to allergies. I made these with rice wrappers instead of wheat flour wrappers to keep it gluten free. I also had to make them without shrimp so I used some left over chicken breast that I had shredded. I actually made them a couple of times because the first batch I left out the salt. I figured that the soy had enough sodium (actually I used tamari-gluten free soy sauce). I was wrong, don't forget the salt!! The cabbage and carrot became sweet during the cooking process and the lack of salt made them too sweet. The second time I made them I added salt and this seemed to balance it out properly. Definitely these will become our go to egg rolls being easy and quick to make and scrumptious. They work in a 220°C oven instead of frying, so there's a plus. Thanks What's For Dinner, Mom for this recipe. It has helped me get my Chinese food back!

Very good. Needed to use some napa cabbage, so shredded that (7 ounces). Added shredded carrots for extra nutrition, and finely diced cooked chicken, as I ate these as a main dish and I need to watch my protein levels. Made eight egg rolls. Baked according to directions on the wrappers.

Recipe Group Selection:  14, February 2015 ~ Another wonderful recipe, from Jan!  I used chicken rather than shrimp and made them mini egg rolls rather than full size, using one wrapper per egg roll with 1/4 cup filling.  The mixture made 24 minis.  We fried six for dinner and I flash froze 18 of them, uncooked.  This was so easy to make and microwaving the slaw mixture is pretty cleaver.  We dipped them in a Sweet & Spicy Thai Sauce to give them the heat we like.  Paired them with 'Quick Pork Fried Rice' from AR and we enjoyed a delicious dinner!  Thanks Jan, for sharing another great recipe!

These were great! I made them exactly as written, except using TVP instead of shrimp because one of us is a vegetarian. Better than some we've gotten from restaurants, and a lot less expensive. Next time I will make them with only a single wrapper each, though, because they were so huge with two.

I love this recipe!  The only thing I changed was I used half a chub of pork sausage that I cooked chopped small instead of shrimp. I also quick fried the cole slaw to wilt it. I did not double wrap and there was just enough filling for all the wraps.  Thank you so much for this recipe, I am sure I will try the shrimp and maybe chicken in them as well. My family said they are every bit as good, if not better than the ones we get at the local Chinese restaurant.

These were a hit at our house! I had some leftover cooked chicken to use, so I subbed it for the shrimp. I also cut the salt and pepper in half.  I  can easily see adding green onion and other veggies with great results,  too.  Thanks for sharing your recipe what's for dinner,  mom!

this looks easy to make, I love eggs but don't eat that everyday. Maybe 3 eggs per day and off for 2 days?

I grew up in an Asian community as did my husband.  We loved these egg rolls!  They’re a bit peppery and definitely not Small but they were quick, easy and yummy.  Definitely a must try for egg roll lovers.

Entirely too much black pepper for this recipe. That’s all we could taste while eating it. I suggest reducing to 1/2 or 1 tsp, instead of two.

I made this with leftover chicken breast instead of shrimp because that's what I had in the house. I also had a case of fumble-fingers and kept messing up the rolls, so I did them as fried wonton instead. Still excellent. Also, used about 1/4 of the salt and 1/2 of the soy sauce.  Yummy stuff!

Wonderful! I made them vegetarian using TVP rehydrated with veggie stock instead of shrimp, and added some chopped scallions and a portobello mushroom that needed to be used up. Also cut the salt a little and fried in peanut oil. My son said they were better than those from our "go to" Chinese takeout.

It's a winner. I used grape seed oil for frying, which worked well. And they turned out the perfect brown with only 2-3 minutes of frying. Additionally, one wonton per egg roll is sufficient. Just seal with water along the folds as well. My friends say they're the best egg rolls they've ever had!

Not only too much pepper, but also too much salt and garlic as well.  Frying time can be reduced to 3 1/2 to 4 minutes at the recommended temperature.
