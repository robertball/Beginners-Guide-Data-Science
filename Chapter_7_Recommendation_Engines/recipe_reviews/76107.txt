I thought the molasses flavor was too strong.  Next time will add some brown sugar as suggested. I also thought it needed a little something else like maybe some onions and green bell pepper while browning the sausage.

Quick, easy and my husband loved it.  I cut back on the molasses per previous reviews.

We thought the sauce had too strong of a molasses flavor so we sweetened with a tablespoon of brown sugar.  This helped with the flavor but over all my family just didn't like this one; especially my kids.

Instead of a pound of kielbasa, I used a 13-oz pkg of Hillshire Farm® Chicken Hardwood Smoked Sausage (lowering fat and calories), and I must admit I made other changes, as well.  After reading the reviews, it was apparent that the amount of molasses was going to overwhelm everything, so I added only 2 Tbsp.  I used an 8-oz can of Spanish tomato sauce which has quite a kick to it and provided the perfect balance to the sweet molasses.  Also sautéed some sliced onions and bell pepper with the sausage, making it more of a main dish,  added the optional BBQ sauce, and served over chicken herb rice.  I think this is just one of those recipes where you have to adjust the ingredients to your own personal taste.  As written, I know I wouldn’t have enjoyed it nearly as much as I did tweaking.  Not sure why this is titled BBQ Hotdogs since it calls for kielbasa, definitely a misnomer.  Nothing fancy-schmancy here, but with the modifications I made, it was quite a satisfying comfort food meal.

This was not good as is. The ratio from meat to sauce was extremely way off. I followed to a T and there was 4 to 5 times the amount of sauce to 1 pound of meat before I had to salvage what I made. I don't know if it was to sauce up the rice that much because the rice and sausage would be swimming. But I had tons of sauce left over that get got wasted. The molasses was way to strong and way to sweet for this. I had to try and salvage this, so that my kids would eat the BBQ w/ sausage, I added the optional BBQ sauce and it even over powered it. I totally had to add the 6 ounces of remaining tomato sauce(because we can't get 10oz sized cans where I live) so it was entire 16 ounces of tomato sauce and ended up using a full 1/2 cup of BBQ because 1/4 cup just didn't cut out the sweetness of the molasses either. Sorry...won't make again.

This really turned out tasty.  I would use more rice next time as we had a lot of sauce, but then I used a 16oz tomato sauce, not 10oz.  I think the hickory & brown sugar bbq sauce we used added a nice touch.

This was given mixed reviews at our dinner table.  I enjoyed the flavors and so did one of our kids, but 3 didn't, so will probably change it up a bit next time. I did an an onion and used honey bbq sauce. The sauce wasn't thick enough for me, so I mixed a little cornstarch and that worked well.

There's nothing mind-blowing about this recipe, but it's quick, easy, and great for when you're running low on groceries. I omitted the molasses, and added a little brown sugar. Not bad at all. Thanks!

Considering the limited ingredients, I was not expecting gourmet fare.  As per other reviews, I added a TBSP. of brown sugar, and then after tasting it I still felt that it needed SOMETHING.  So, I added some diced green pepper and a bit of crushed pineapple.  Unfortunately, it still turned out like something that I won't ever make again.

WONDERFUL!  I LOVE kielbasa!  And this was just great!  I was a litle nervous about so much molasses, but just keep cooking it and makes the meat taste so good!

This was OK, I carmalized the sausage in 1 cup apple juice first then left out the vinegar and bottled sauce. This way was very good.

Very easy & tasty meal.  We didn't have BBQ sauce in the house so instead we used teriaki marinade and it tasted delicious.  I would double this recipe next time though.
