Indeed the fresh ginger is the key ingredient in this burger.  Teriyaki Burgers are my husbands absolute favorite.  We both though the egg and the bread crumbs made it seem more like meat loaf than hamburgers though.  I have no idea what 'Asian Seasoning blend' is so I just left it out.  Next time I think I will skip the bread crumbs and egg add a bit less teriyaki sauce.  I did these on the grill and that added a nice dimension to the taste of the burgers.

I will rate the recipe, but did make some changes.  Because of the reviews stating the burgers tasted like meatloaf, I left out the breadcrumbs and most of the egg.  I didn't have any water chestnuts, so I omitted them.  Also didn't have Asian seasoning blend, so I used a mixture of black pepper, ground ginger, red pepper flakes, onion powder and garlic powder.  The minced ginger and the ground ginger really make the flavor in these burgers. I chose to make my own buns using Chef John's "Homemade Hamburger Buns" on this site.  Very good!

These burgers had good flavor but the texture of the burgers were more like meatloaf than a hamburger.  My family did enjoy them although I will probably make them next time without the breadcrumbs and egg as another reviewer suggested.  I believe it was probably a mind thing with my family and I....as in when you're planning on eating a burger, you expect burger texture....if I had served this as meat loaf...they would have liked it just fine...again the flavor is great, just the texture is off for a "hamburger"....must serve with the grilled pineapple!  Great flavor combination.

I really like this recipe.  I am not a big fan of ginger so I leave that out and have substituted ground turkey for the ground beef and added a slice of cheddar cheese.  A big favorite of my family (which are very picky eaters)

Outstanding burger!  I used Japanese 5 Spice for the Asian seasoning and it added a nice touch of spicy heat.  With grilled pineapple these burgers were an absolute hit with the whole family!

Broiler was not working so cooked the pineapple slices on the grill on low for about 90 seconds each side and they tasted perfect.  Then I did the burgers on high on the grill and they went about twice as fast as a normal hamburger but were absolutely delicious.  I doubled the recipe all the way down and it was fantastic.

This is so easy to make and very tasty.  The ginger added a little zing that put it in a class by itself.  Four out of the five members of my family loved it.  My son-in-law did not  like the pineapple or the ginger.    He has stomach issues.  My recommendation is to make  sure  those who you are cooking  for don't have a similar problem.

The bread crumbs and the egg threw the texture off for a burger. I would adapt the ingredients if I made this recipe again.

We grilled the burgers outside on our sailboat bar-b-que, 8 minutes on each side for medium rare. Used no hormone, no antibiotic ,grain fed lean ground beef. Substituted black pepper for lemon pepper and omitted Onion Salt, as I am allergic to onions..    The grilled pineapple added a lovely sweet contrast to the teriyaki base sauce.  Would try to locate Asian Seasoning next time. Served them with spinach strawberry salad.
Would definitely make again.

One of my favorite meals in a very long time! Loved this. Hubby loved it too. I doubled the meat and kept the sauce, eggs and bread crumbs as is -made 5 burgers. It was a huge hit. Served it with an asian salad with cashews - so relish!!!

Really great, tried it scaled up with ground turkey. Tasted awesome, but thinner is better in my opinion with Turkey, it ends up being a little soft if the burgers are really thick.

These burgers were pretty good and my husband loved his.  I thought they were a little dry and "meatloafy" but the flavor was good. I used 1.25 lbs of ground beef because that's what I had.  I didn't have water chestnuts so I substituted bamboo shoots.  Also didn't have fresh ginger so I used fresh pickled ginger.  I broiled the pineapple slices for at least 5 min. on each side. We also slathered them with catsup because...well, just because.

A great hamburger recipe that I will certainly make again & again. I had to leave out water chestnuts & bread crumbs as I didn't have any but did use Corn Flake crumbs in lieu of the bread crumbs.
