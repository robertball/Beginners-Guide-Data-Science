This was very easy to make, I let the chicken broth reduce a little more than the recipe called for. I think next time I might try serving over noodles.

This is very simple and company worthy.  I didn't make any changes. Early in the day I pounded and seasoned the meat. Dinner was ready in under 30 minutes.  I cheated and prepared boxed Pasta Roni (I chose one with garlic & oil) and frozen creamed spinach.  While they were microwaving I tended to preparing the pork, which was a snap. I had also measured out in advance the lemon juice, broth, garlic and olives so I just had to add them. I had made a salad and served some french bread (and white wine). I would never just serve a 1 lb. tenderloin for 4 people - but with the sides it was perfect and left some room to spare for dessert. Thanks submitter.

The sauce was a little too lemon-y (for us) to be 5 stars.  But, boy, the pork was delicious!  I served with spaghetti tossed with garlic, s+p and chicken broth, and steamed asparagus.

This recipe was excellent.  A lot of flavors for the palette to discern.  Would be excellent with sauted spinach or garlic roasted potatoes and sweet italian bread.

Wonderful recipe! Used a combination of sliced black and green olives. Added shallots, capers and a little white wine.  Served with sour cream mashed potatoes. My daughter even liked this minus the olives. I used two pork tendloins and didn't bother flattening, just cooked a little longer.
