This cake was so great it deserves 6 stars!  Judging from what other reviewers said, I drained well and pureed the (unsweetened) strawberries.  I added 1/2 cup of the puree to the cake batter and ONLY 2 TBSP of the puree to the icing, which comes out to a PERFECT spreading consistency.  I made this in a 9x13 baking dish and the icing was the perfect amount to cover the top nicely.  This is an absolutely great recipe, with the above modifications!

I didn't think I would be a fan of a fruit-flavored cake, but I was wrong!  This cake is truly wonderful.  I've made it twice now--once for an informal wedding shower and once for family, and everyone raved about it both times.  Based on others suggestions, I modified the recipe.  I pureed the package of strawberries, and for the cake I made for my family, I put the puree through a mesh strainer to remove the seeds for my picky husband.  After tasting the cake with and without seeds, without is really better and worth the effort.  I baked the cake in a 13x9 pan for 35 minutes and it came out perfect. I determined that due to the "runny" nature of the icing, a 3-layer cake might be tricky.  The icing was a little sweet for my taste, so I put in 8oz. of cream cheese, and 1 tsp. mexican vanilla to tone down the sweet and enhance the flavor.  However, to thicken it up a bit, I did end up adding another cup of powdered sugar.  Also, I only used 1/3c. of the strawberry puree in the icing, and put the other 2/3c. in the cake batter.  Because of the fruit, cream cheese, and butter in this cake, I store it in the refrigerator.  It stays nice and moist for as many days as you can keep it around--which isn't long at my house.  This recipe is a keeper!

I've made this recipe twice and both times used fresh strawberries.  The first time I made it, I used the icing recipe listed.  It was horrible and required a lot of modifications (should have listened to the other reviewers).  This time I used the cream cheese icing from this site and it worked perfectly.  I made three 9" layers; pureed the strawberries and strained it to remove the seeds and added it to the batter.  I added a bit of the puree to a small portion of the cream cheese icing to test, but decided I preferred the icing without it.  I added sliced strawberries with the icing in between the layers and I garnished with chocolate covered whole strawberries.  Stunning presentation and amazing taste to boot.  This recipe is a keeper!

My grandmother and I do a lot of baking...cakes, cookies, pies..etc.  We've noticed that most layer cakes can be made in a 9x13 inch pan without compromising the taste. Of course layered cakes are much more elegant looking than others, but with this particular recipe, I prefer it in a rectangular pan.  We've prepared this cake several times, and have always used frozen strawberries.  And everyone who tries this really enjoyes it.  I'm a die-hard chocolate lover but actually prefer this cake!!  Thanks Judalee.

Fun to make and to try but this doesn't rate in the "Recipe Hall of Fame."  The cake itself is moist and flavorful, but I couldn't quite get past the artificial taste and color. Also, given the reviews about the frosting being a "sloppy mess," I took other reviewers' suggestions and used "Cool Whipped Frosting," substituting strawberry extract for the vanilla and adding 1/3 cup of strawberry puree. I made this in two layers, and put a layer of fresh, sliced strawberries over the filling in between the layers. I decorated it with just a few fresh strawberries with the stems. I could see this "pretty in pink" cake as a real crowd pleaser for a little girl's birthday party, and wish I had come across this when my daughter was younger. All around, not much payoff or reward for the effort. To me, it just screams "fake."

This is an awesome cake!!!  I was nervous about the frosting but after discussing it with my mom she gave me a few hints.  I made the frosting like the reviewer Diana suggested "My frosting is 1 stick of butter with 4 cups of powdered sugar with a little vanilla."  My mom's hints to help cut the sweetness is to add a tad bit of salt or lemon juice.  I ended up using about a tablespoon of concentrated lemon juice to the frosting and it turned out GREAT!  Since I used fresh strawberries the cake was perfect and the icing was sweetened to my taste.  The frosting made too much since I used a 9x13 pan but would be plenty for a multi-layer cake.  Perfection!

This cake is to die for!!! It gets 10 stars!  I made this for my boss for her birthday and was so good I have to make another one this weekend.  I did make a couple adjustments.  I used fresh strawberries and chopped them in a food processor before adding to the batter.  I made a 2 layer 9x13 cake instead of round.  For filling I used the filling from the Strawberry and Cream Cake on this page (1 1/2 cups heavy cream, 2 T sugar, 1/2 tsp vanilla, and 1 1/2 cup sliced strawberries) and used homemade cream cheese frosting to frost the top.   It was absolutely amazing.  People at work are still raving!

I have been making this cake for years.  My frosting is 1 stick of butter with 4 cups of powdered sugar with a little vanilla.  I let the cake cool only for 5 or 10 minutes, then pour the frosting on.  Makes for a very moist cake!!!

I used this cake recipe to make an Elmo cake for my daughter's birthday and it was a total hit!  I took the other reviewer's advice and pureed the strawberries before putting them in.  I used about 3/4 of the strawberries that were called for and the cake turned out perfectly!

this was the best cake ever!! i brought it to my fathers birthday party. I didnt bother using the frosting recipe, and frosted it with cool whip, using slices of strawberry in the middle of the layers with the cool whip.I decorated the top with fresh whole strawberries. it was absolutely delicious and everone loved it.(tip:so the layers stay level, with a serrated knife trim the tops of the cakes so they build up to be straight, not crooked)  :)

Goodbye, strawberry cake mix!  I followed the recipe very closely, but I added 1/4 cup flour instead of 3 tablespoons.  I used 3 cake pans as directed, and all three were filled to the top after baking.  So, three pans is a must.  I don't thinK I'd try to get away with using two pans.  For the frosting, I used a half cup of shortening, one stick of softened butter, 1/2 cup of pureed strawberries, a 2-pound bag of powdered sugar,  1 or 2 teaspoons of vanilla (to taste) and a teaspoon of butter flavoring.  I creamed the butter, shortenng, flavorings, andberries in my stand mixer, slowly added the sugar, and left it on high speed for about 10 minutes.  The result was a light strawberry buttercream frosting that was easy to spread, but not to thin.  I'll keep this recipe in mind for the next time someone requests a strawbrry cake.

I LOVE strawberry cake and reading a lot of the good reviews this one received, I thought would be the one make. This was easy to make. But, unfortunately my wife and I were very disappointed. The previous reviewer was correct when she said it tasted FAKE! There was no fooling my taste buds, as much as I tried to like it, it wasn't happening. I followed the directions to the T. Cake was more dense than we prefer, which I can look past, but the taste, not so much. If you're reading this...keep looking for another strawberry cake.

YUMMY!! This cake taste really good - i think adding fresh strawberries instead of frozen type, makes a discerning difference!! I baked at 325F for 35 mins using a 13" x 9" baking tray...cut into 2 and layered it with Whipped Cream Cheese Frosting ( also from allrecipes ). The layers were abit too thick - next time, will bake in 2x 9" round cake tins or in a jelly roll pan for thinner layers. I added 2/3s of the pureed and strained strawberries into the cake batter and the remaining 1/3 into the Whipped Cream cheese frosting. Both cake and frosting tasted really delicious n finger licking good!My dd couldnt have enough of the Strawberry Cream cheese frosting!

OMG - THIS IS AMAZING.  The best strawberry cake out there. I won't bother with any other from now on.  The secret is to add strawberry puree to both the cake batter and the icing.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception that I took 14 oz of frozen whole strawberries (unsweetened!) and thawed them partially and then pureed them in a food processor.  I set aside 2/3 of it for the icing and the rest I put in the cake.  I heavily sprayed 2 round cake pans with baking Pam and the cake was just perfect.  So moist and flavorful with that real strawberry taste - not artificial tasting at all.  Then for the icing, I made a cream cheese strawberry icing that is to die for. I took 12 oz cream cheese (which is one full block plus another half) and 2 sticks of unsalted butter and used a beater on medium speed to cream that together until smooth.  Then I added the 2/3 cups strawberry puree, 1 tsp vanilla, 4 cups of powered sugar and pinch of salt.  Mix together with spoon and then beat again until smooth.  It is just amazing.  The consistency is not very thick, but will ice the cake just fine. Just use toothpicks if you made the cake in two 9 inch pans. The flavor is out of this world.  I made this for my uncle's birthday and everyone raved about it!  This will be a permanent addition to my recipe book and I won't bother making a different one ever!!

I just love this cake.  I have been looking for an outstanding strawberry cake recipe to make for my daughter's 3rd birthday party and I will be making this one.  A few suggestions though:
I used an entire 14 oz bag of thawed (frozen)strawberries and just mashed them with a fork.  I then eyeballed them and threw half of the strawberries into the cake mix and half into the "icing".  It came out perfect.  Another thing...based on the reviews, I think that people are upset about the icing because they are expecting an "icing" consitency.  This is actually a combination glaze/icing and has a texture all it's own.  It's not meant to be think, but more like satin. I put about a stick of real butter, half the mashed strawberries, a splash of good vanilla, a splash of lemon juice (this cuts some of the sweetness)and added powder sugar while mixing until thickened to my taste.  It turned out soooooo delicious!!  The cake is absolutely gorgeous, a perfect color of pink.  If you want a great, rich strawberry cake, you've got to give this one a try!

This was wonderful! I actually blended the strawberries in the blender with water, then mixed everything together. I also made cupcakes instead. Recipe made about 36 cupcakes. Bake at 325 for about 18 minutes.

I LOVE this cake but like the others, the frosting just has the runs. I even altered by adding more powdered sugar but that only helped a little. I love the taste of the frosting but it doesn't tranport well. I hate that I may have to use something thicker like a cream cheese based frosting. While the latter is good, it's just different. Also, I don't feel comfortable leaving the cake out of the fridge for long as I use fresh stawbs. Maybe this isn't a good bake-sale selection. Still, I will be devouring it during strawberry season.

I've made this cake (but never the frosting) at least four times in the last year, sometimes with fresh berries, sometimes with home frozen, once with commercial frozen.  The best results came from a mixture of home frozen/commercial frozen.  All commercial frozen made the cake a little too sweet, and all fresh berries came out a little dry and not nearly enough strawberry flavor.  If you do use fresh, try letting them macerate in a little sugar for a couple hours to release some of the natural juice.  Also, you don't have to have exactly the 10 oz of berries, but don't go too far over or the cake falls apart.  The same goes with putting too many berries between the layers.  I strongly recommend using the Whipped Whip Cream Cream Cheese Frosting - a cake this flavorful deserves a rich and creamy home made frosting.

This cake got rave reviews from my family.  They love anything with strawberries in it.  The only change I made to the recipe was that I added cream cheese to the frosting and added powder sugar to get the consistency I wanted. Thanks for the great recipe!

I actually made the cake the way the recipe says to make it and it turned out marvellous! Unlike the complaints from other reviewers, my frosting did not come out runny or sloppy at all.  If you like strawberry ice cream, you will love this cake!

nom nom nom. This is such an easy yummy recipe. I brought this to work and everyone couldn't believe this started from a white cake mix. I used fresh strawberries since they are in season, about 8 ounces. Since strawberries can sometimes have a slight tart taste to them, I cut them into slices, threw them in a bowl, tossed about 1-2 tsp sugar over them, gave it a quick stir and toss them into the fridge for about an hour or so. I then pureed the strawberries and added it to the cake mixture. I didn't want chunky strawberry pieces. Instead of a cake I made cupcakes instead. 350 degrees F at about 22 mins. This recipe made exactly 24 perfect cupcakes. I didn't use the frosting though. I used the cool whip frosting on this website because I wanted an overall light fluffy cupcake. This is a perfect combination for spring/summer fun.

This turned out very sweet and too dense the first time I made it without changing up anything.  It was still pretty good.  The next time, I just made it very simple.  I simply used a Philsbury yellow package cake mix (followed instructions per the box) with 1/2 cup strawberries pureed in the cake mix and 2 tbsp in the icing (suggested by Ramajohn) and that's it!  I just topped the cake with fresh strawberries. I omitted everything else and it turned out excellent!  I guess I created a new recipe, but hey everyone loved it at a birthday party!!  Thanks!

This cake is the BOMB.  My family loved it. I make this cake in a bunt pan and only use 1/2 the icing.I ice it while it is still warm so the icing runs down the sides.

I think one cup of oil is too much- I always just use the amount the cake mix calls for (typically 1/3 to 1/2 cup). I make this in either 2 8-inch round cake pans or in Bundt cake pan. I usually use fresh strawberries instead of frozen and I always put a layer of fresh strawberries in the middle of the frosted cake (if i use the Bundt pan I cut the cake in half after it has cooled). Also I always frost it with Whipped Cream Frosting (also from AR). The only bad about using that frosting is you have to keep the cake in the fridge. :)

WOW this is good!  I used frozen strawberries and only made half a batch of the cake this evening as a "test run" before I make a double layer birthday cake with it on Monday for a friend.  I used a muddle to mush down the frozen strawberries (unsweetened, whole and thawed.)  No straining involved to remove seeds, and I didn't notice seeds at all in the results.  I baked cupcakes (1/2 batch = 12 cupcakes) for about 20 minutes. I used Betty Crocker Whipped Cream Cheese Frosting and WOW was this an amazing combination!  This cake was decicious and it's my new favorite.

I love this cake!!  I made it several times for my family and for potlucks at work.  Everyone really likes it and they request it on all occasions.  I didn't make any changes to the actual cake recipe, but I do cheat on the icing.  I use store bought whipped cream cheese icing and mix it well with a few strawberries.  It makes a really fluffy, creamy stawberry flavored icing and the cake is wonderfully moist.

I made these into cupcakes, I used a cup butter instead of oil, and Fresh Strawberries put in the food processor to make it taste more homemade and less "out of a box". I also didn't use the icing, instead I used cream cheese frosting and for a little something extra I used McCormick Strawberry Extract instead of Vanilla Flavor. I sliced thin pieces of the left over stawberries and place them in the middle they were gorgeous and delicious.

I made this cake for the first time and followed the recipe...I should have read the reviews first (live and learn).  I used frozen strawberries as the recipe called for.  The cake still turned out excellant, but fresh strawberries would have probably been much better.  It is the moistest cake I have ever eaten!  The icing (if you want to call it that!) was another story.  What a mess!  Before even attempting to put it on the cake (and I made the 3 layer one) I added 3/4 of a tub of Cool Whip I had to try to thicken it up and get a better consistency.  Trying to frost it was a disaster.  The layers kept sliding around because the icing was so runny.  And trying to frost the sides was horrible...the frosting just kept pooling onto the bottom of the plate.  I finally gave up and put the whole mess in the frig. I thought maybe it would be a little easier to work with if it was cold.  
It was, but I hadn't quite straightened the layers out them when I put the cake in the frig, so the cake looked like the leaning tower of pisa!  I managed to get the rest of the cake frosted.  When I presented it at my family party, I apologized for the look of the cake, but hoped it tasted better than it looked.  I WAS RIGHT!  It was absolutely delicious!  Everyone loved it...even the icing.  Although next time I will probably just use Cool Whip. All in all, it was a delicious cake, albeit not a very pretty one with that slippery icing.

I served this wonderful cake today at work for someone who is about to get married.  I doubled the recipe and added a 16 oz pkg of frozen strawberries and used less oil.  Needless to say, this cake was a great hit.  It is a dense, moist cake, and I would definitely bake this again and again.  I also frosted with fresh whipped cream and decorated with strawberries; a beautiful presentation.  So all you strawberry lovers--go for it!!!

Absolutely delicious!  I didn't use the icing included in the recipe -- I decorated it with buttercream icing instead.  I also baked the cake in a Bundt pan for about 45 minutes at 350.  I can't wait to make this cake for my boyfriend's birthday next week!

I took a previous reviewers suggestion and baked this in a 9x13" pan. The results were fabulous. This is a delicious and moist cake. I did add an extra cup of powdered sugar to the frosting to thicken it a bit. It still came out more like a glaze but seemed perfect for the cake. I just poured the frosting over the cake and let it drip down the sides. I think if I were to make this as a layer cake I'd use pureed strawberries in a buttercream frosting for the layers and then top with the frosting recipe given with the cake....but remember to add extra sugar!

I made this as written, except I made a bundt cake and I pureed my strawberries and strained the seeds as a personal preference. On the icing, I used aabout a 1/3 cup of pureed and strained strawberries and also made the icing with 1/2 the butter and 4 oz cream cheese. I ended up using 2 cups of sugar to get the consitency I wanted, still a bit runny like a glaze for the bundt. It turned out wonderful. Oh yes! 1 more change, I used applesauce in place of the oil to cut out SOME fat as this is not a low-cal cake! LOL But it's worth the extra calories. Just make thinner slices, more cake to go around. LOL

This is the most amazing cake I've ever tried.  I used the Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site instead of the one that came with the recipe.  I didn't remove the seeds for the batter, and nobody could tell there were seeds in the cake.  I also took somebody's advice and added sliced strawberries between each layer.  FANFREAKINTASTIC!

This is a really good cake. I used fresh strawberries for both cake and frosting, and added a tsp of vanilla to the frosting. I also made cupcakes, they turned out very nice as well. I would not hesitate to bring this to a potluck or get-together, it is fairly light and full of flavor without any cloying sweetness. And who doesn't like strawberry :-)

Caveat: The word "frosting" is a bit of a misnomer here. This makes more of a glaze. If you are expecting something fluffy and thick, you should ice the cake with a different frosting recipe.

Enjoy!

Excellent recipe!  I cut the oil down to 1/2 cup and used only 2- 9" pans and it worked out just fine.  I used strawberry Cool Whip rather than frosting.

I used this recipe for the top and bottom layers of a 3-layer birthday cake.  I added a package of cream cheese to another box of white cake mix and used half of the batter for the middle layer; used Cool Whip in between the layers and strawberry frosting for the outside.  I garnished the top with a strawberry and curled pink and white ribbon.  It was beautiful AND yummy!  
*10/24/2004:  5 months later and I'm STILL hearing about this cake at least twice a week and getting requests for it!!!

I've made this cake twice now, and received rave reviews both times. Everyone says it has the most strawberry flavor they've ever tasted, and it comes out so moist!

The second time I made it, I halved the icing recipe, put it between two layers, and frosted with a buttercream frosting. It was gone in minutes! I'll never try another strawberry cake again. Thanks for sharing!

I've never rated another recipe twice before but felt compelled to with this one.  I just made it for my best friend's baby shower & it was a smashing success.  Yes, the icing is not a thick "frosting" type but rather a wet glaze  which covers all 3 layers, the sides, and spreads around the sides and bottom of the cake beautifully on a platter (just make sure you sift the powdered sugar and beat it well with electric beaters in a bowl to prevent lumps and uneven coloring). Everyone loved the appearance and ESPECIALLY the taste...if you are looking for the ultimate in a sublime moist strawberry cake, try this recipe and don't change a thing!!! **UPDATE**  I made this into cupcakes using the Cool Whipped Frosting from this site instead of the strawberry icing (substituting chocolate pudding for the vanilla), it went over like gangbusters and was the first dessert to go at the my potluck!  This recipe just totally rocks!!!

I received a lot of compliments on this cake. Delicious!  I didn't use their icing recipe.  I used 1- 8 ounce cream cheese (room temp), 1/2 c confectionary sugar, 1/2 bag strawberries; beat until well blended then folded in a (small) tub of cool whip.

We enjoyed the taste of strawberry but we felt it was an ugly color :) I am not sure if it was my fault or not but it was not a bright pink.  It seemed a bit dull kinda like dirty strawberry color.  I think next time I will add food coloring to it and also I added 1 tsp of strawberry extract to my batter before I baked the cake.  We will definitely make it again with these few alterations.

This cake is so light and good -even better left over.  If using fresh or frozen strawberries make sure that they are completely dried after washing .  I made the mistake the second time and it was too loose, but still delicious!

I should have read the reviews first. The cake is great but the icing needs work. This will be a keeper with the right icing.

Excellent cake. I reduced the cooking time to 25 minutes or it's to dry and then made butter cream frosting for the side which holds up better then the cream cheese frosting. Inside I mixed the Whipped cream with the cream cheese and powder sugar and vanilla, it makes a light and fluffy cheesecake filling-don't over whip it or it will go flat.

This cake was a huge hit at my daughter's birthday party.  Based on what another reviewer recommended, I too blended the strawberries into a puree and strained the seeds from the puree with a mesh strainer.  I also opted to go with a 9x13 sheet cake.  Beyond that, the recipe is completely perfect as-is.  Thank you for sharing!

I made this for my hubby's b-day and everyone loved it!  Next time I would just thicken the frosting.  I added a little lemon juice to the frosting to give it a little zing.

Came out deliciously soft with full of strawberry flavor.  I tried it with the whipped cream cheese frosting recipe from this site as others have suggested.  It was ok.  Next time I'll try regular cream cheese frosting.  I think if I used the strawberry frosting in this receipe, it'd be super sweet and a strawberry overkill but that's just me =).  I made these into cupcakes and baked 20 min.

EXCELLENT CAKE. I made a few adjustments, used strawberry cake mix for example. Very good. I had to use smart balance spread because I ran out of butter and it was still great.

I made this exactly as stated except that I pureed the strawberries first. I think next time I will add more strawberries than the recipe calls for... I didn't think there were enough. Otherwise, the cake part of this recipe was excellent and quite tasty. I did not make the icing after reading the other reviewers, opting instead for Cool Whipped Frosting from this site. It was the perfect choice.

This cake is moist and flavorful but it is also very sweet.  I recommend frosting it with Cool Whip with about a half a cup of pureed strawberries folded in.  I think frosting made with powdered sugar is way too sweet for this cake.

Ive made this for 2 occasions in the last week and everyone raves about it. It tastes so fresh. I used frozen strawberries, mashed well , and some slices between the layers. This really gives it the fresh strawberry flavor. I used the Whipped cream cream cheese frosting from this site and it was perfect!! My husband has asked for it AGAIN!!

I made this in two nine inch rounds and used the cool whip frosting from this site.  Everyone loved it.  I thought it was pretty good.  It was very moist - almost too moist - for me.  It seemed like it was on the verge of being underdone.  But everyone else loved it, so what do I know?

I loved this cake!!!  It was so beautiful it tempted my parents away from their diet, and my mom doesn't even like cake!  She did love this recipe though.  I used fresh strawberries, and when I made the frosting, I added the strawberries one at a time so the consistancy was pretty good.  I found that the frosting did hold up better when I had the cake in the fridge, so I'd recommend doing that until it's about time to serve the cake.  I also sliced fresh strawberries very thinly and placed them in between the layers.  Thank you very much for the recipe!!

Overall, a very yummy cake.  The first time I made it, I had trouble with the icing like others have noted.  I couldn't add cream cheese because of an allergy.  The second time I made it, I made the butter cream icing first, and then added the strawberries one teaspoon at a time.  This time I got a good, creamy icing - but I only used 5 teaspoons of strawberry puree, a lot less than the recipe calls for!

We made this cake for our niece's third birthday party.  It was a hit - so moist and flavorful!  As some of the previous reviewers noted, the frosting was runny, but we made the cake in a 9x13 glass pan and kept it in the pan to frost and serve (topped with fresh strawberries).  We'll definitely make this cake again!

This cake was delicious! I baked mine in a 9x13 inch pan for about 35-40 min. and I used a cream cheese frosting and added about a cup of fresh strawberries. My husband is a strawberry lover and especially loved it. It was such a hit that this is what I am using for my daughter's 1st birthday cake! Pink frosting and pink cake, perfect for a little girl!

This cake is very good and moist.  I have made it twice already and everyone loves it.  The only thing I don't like about it is the glaze that it suppose to cover the 3 layers and the 3 layers.  I had never made a layer cake before so doing 3 layers was a little challenging for me.  As far as the glaze goes I found a wedding cake frosting recipe and mixed it with the glaze and it was much easier to work with and everyone loved it.

This cake was a bit too sweet for me, but still quite tasty.  I used the Cherry Chip white cake mix for extra pieces of color.  I also pureed and strained the strawberries and it worked well. Next time I make it I will try adding a little less of the jello powder (keeping the same amount of water) so it won't be so sweet.  I also made a whipped cream frosting, added red food coloring to turn it pink, and didn't add more than a 1/4 cup of powdered sugar which cut the sweetness of the cake and complimented the strawberry flavor. 
You can add a product called Whip-it to the cream before you whip it and it will stay at room temp for up to 4 hours.  Also put your bowl and beaters in the freezer for 20 or so minutes before you beat it and it will fluff up faster.

If I make this again, I will definitely use a regular frosting recipe and add strawberries. I tried adding a little salt, but after using over twice as much sugar and only half of the strawberries, the icing was still pourable. 

The cake was ok, but I couldn't have distinguished it from a strawberry cake from a box.

Oh my gosh!  I love to bake and enjoy finding new recipes.  This is a favorite of mine as well as everyone else.  It is a beautiful cake as well.  The frosting is runny (as some noted in their reviews) and sweet, so I added cool whip to it instead of extra sugar.  I always decorated it with chocolate covered strawberries.  Beautiful!

This was a hit at my 5 year-old niece's birthday.  Everybody loved it!  The cake was good, although it took longer to bake in a 13x9 pan,(I don't normally have 3 9" rounds in my kitchen!) and the frosting was a bit too sweet.  I might try adding some pureed strawberries to some commercial vanilla frosting next time.  I would recommend pureeing the strawberries in a blender or food processor prior to adding them to the batter and frosting.  Otherwise, the berries get caught in the beaters and you wind up having to scrape them off and mix some more.  Otherwise, terrific flavor for the cake itself!

This cake does taste wonderful!!  The ideal way to get the proper consistency for the icing is to drain the frozen berries well.  The more liquid present, the more powdered sugar you need.  Make the adjustment and you will have the ULTIMATE strawberry cake and icing.

The cake was delicious and beautiful.  The reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because the icing recipe was off in my opinion.  It did not make enough to ice a 2-layer (much less a 3-layer) cake as stated.  Many reviewers made this in a 9x13 pan so I'm guessing there was plenty of icing for that size.  Also, I'm SO very glad that I read the reviews about pureeing the strawberries first and cutting back on the strawberries in the icing to prevent it from being too loose. I used about half of the pureed strawberries in the cake and added them by the spoonful in the icing until it was the consistency I wanted.  I ended up using about 3 tablespoons in the original icing recipe but had to make another half of a batch to completely frost the cake well.

I've been looking for a good strawberry cake recipe for years and this one is by far the best. And it's very easy to make. I've made this cake about half a dozen times for birthdays, Valentine's Day and just "because" and it always turns out great and it rarely sits for longer than 3 or 4 days before it's eaten. A few of the changes I've made is to use fresh strawberries when in season; but frozen works fine in a pinch. I also chop the strawberries by hand rather than purée them. Another change is that I don't mess around with the frosting and instead use Cool Whip cheese cake whip cream frosting. One thing to note as well is that this cake takes a bit  longer than the recipe calls for so you should keep an eye on it/

The women in my family have been making this strawberry cake for 4 generations! It is a family favorite; my daughter has even asked for it to be made into her wedding cake! I struggle, though, with the frosting. It is so runny! I warm the butter, dissolve another small box of strawberry gelatin in it, and add a pinch of salt. The gelatin sets up and creates a whole new texture. Mine has never been fluffy like the photo.

I should've realized that the amount of strawberries for the frosting was too much for the low amount of powdered sugar.  Unfortunately, I used the rest of what I had and didn't have more to fix it.  Fortunately, I had a block of cream cheese and it saved the icing and is so good!  I will forever add cream cheese to this frosting.

This is a great recipe!  This cake turned out moist, fluffy, and very flavorful!  I made this for my daughter's 2nd birthday and we all loved it!  For the cake I followed the recipe with 2 minor exceptions:  (1) I used funfetti white cake because that's what I had on hand and (2) I baked 12 cupcakes and the remaining batter I baked in an 8x8 pan instead of 3 9-inch pans.  I loved the strawberry taste!  I used frozen strawberries as the recipe stated - I just thawed them at room temperature first and then pureed them in the blender before adding to the cake batter (next time I'll also strain the puree through some cheesecloth to get rid of the seeds - not horrible in the cake at all, I just noticed a few and thought I'd take them out next time I make this).  I did not use the frosting recipe, I have a favorite vanilla frosting recipe that I used instead.  I am making this cake again for my daughter's party in a couple of weeks... this recipe is a definite keeper, thanks!

Great taste, but it was more like brownie consistency than cake - very dense.  I don't know if it was from my alterations or if it was the cake in general.  I didn't want a whole cup of oil in the cake, so I used 1/2 cup applesauce, and I used 5 oz fresh pureed strawberries instead of frozen.  Those were my only changes to the cake, and my result was awesome flavor but very dense.  I didn't use the frosting - instead I put a layer of lemon pie filling and a layer of cool whip on top.

I used a French Vanilla cake mix for the base (what I had) and 1# fresh strawberries, pureed, holding a few back for decoration.  I put all of the puree into the cake batter.  I put it in a bundt pan and baked for 1 hour.  I made the Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this site to drizzle over.  The cake was extremely moist and dense; think poundcake.  It didn't rise as high as a "usual" bundt cake.  We don't like things too sweet and it wasn't.  5 stars as it was so moist. I was hesitant to make it because a pink cake doesn't do anything for me visually.  I've always had this aversion to them but if someone asked me to make a Strawberry Cake, this would definitely be it.  The not-too-sweet glaze went very well with it.

I've never baked this cake however I've used the strawberry frosting recipe plenty of times, which is awesome!  I followed Ramajohn's review and only used 2 tbsp of strawberry puree for the frositng.

Followed the directions exactly.  The  cake was cooked through, but sunk immediately after taking them out of the oven.  The texture was funky, maybe because of the jello?  Would very much not recommend this recipe.

Good, but not as great as I expected from all the reviews. I followed the directions exactly--although used a different frosting (seven minute frosting).  I wonder if the cake really needs 4 eggs and 1 cup of oil as well--seemed a bit excessive.  Still, it came out of the pan easily for decorating.  Not sure I'd make it again though.

Absolutely wonderful. I found it nice and light with a rich, but not too rich strawberry flavor. I can not wait till next strawberry season to make this again. However next time I will definitely add more strawberries into the batter.

This cake actually deserves 5 stars, but I gave it 3 because the frosting was way too runny, the butter didn't even completely mix into the frosting (I mixed and mixed for at least 20 minutes). I even added the whole (1lb) box of confectioner's sugar and a little cream cheese to try to get a frosting type consistencty, but it did not work.  I will definately make the cake again, but will skip the frosting next time and maybe use a regular cream cheese frosting instead...

Just made this for my dad's birthday and it brought down the house!  So good.  I've made a similar version before, and here are the tweaks I made:  First, use an all-natural jello from whole foods or somewhere to avoid the shocking pink color (and improve taste).  Instead of water I use 6 oz. Greek Yogurt or buttermilk - makes cakes moist (and just add a bit of sugar to counteract the sourness).  I used a bit less oil (3/4c) because esp. with the yogurt it really doesn't need a full cup (and I'm not one to skimp).  I add 1/2 each of chopped pecans and unsweetened coconut - a nice texture/taste addition.  Finally, for the frosting, I needed another cup of confectioner sugar to stiffen it up, and it was extremely sweet, so I folded in 1.5 cups of whipping cream (whipped to stiff peaks)- so yummy!!!

I made this cake for Easter.  Instead of making three round cakes, I made it in 9 x 13 pan.  Once it cooled, I turned it out onto a platter.  Instead of the butter cream frosting I used the recipe on this site for Easy Whipped Cream.  I doubled the recipe, but cut the sour cream by half and increased the heavy cream.  The tang was just right with the richness of the strawberry cake.  It was wonderful!

This cake is really good and easy to whip together which is especially helpful when you are cooking with kids. I am not a huge fan of boxed cake mixes, but I would still give it very high marks!  I used fresh strawberries . . . cooked them down a little and mashed them.  My icing coagulated, but that didn't stop anyone from enjoying it!  I know I will make this cake again!

This cake was so, so good. The only reason that I am giving it four stars is the amount of oil. I did not modify this recipe, but if I make it again I am going to use an alternative. One cup is WAAAY too much. We used this for cake balls (recipe from this site) and it was so oily that it kept leaking from outside the chocolate, which looked gross.

This was pretty good. I only had a freezer bag of strawberries so I wasn't sure how much it was. I only added about 3 tbsp of olive oil and baked the cake in a 9x13 inch pan for about 50 minutes. It was nice and moist and had a good flavour. Oh and I used strawberry-kiwi jello. I left it un-iced and served it with cool whip.

Okay, so I had left over cream cheese frosting and also some cream filling for some cupcakes I made for my son's football team, so I decided what was the best thing to use this in, strawberry cupcakes.  This recipe was delicious! I made 24 cupcakes and filled and frosted them with my left over ingredients, yummy!!! Everyone ate like at least 2 a piece!

Beautiful Cake!  Cake makes three nice big layers!!  For the icing I used a stick of real butter and around 4 cups of powdered sugar!  Took to work and gone in less than an hour!  Worth the work to do a layer cake rather than a sheet cake- presentation is really nice!!  3-6-11 I have made this again and followed the recipe exactly. I am unsure why cake will rise nice, but then you let it cool and it shrinks a bunch!!!!  I was so disappointed, but I know it will still be a hit tomorrow at work....just wondering why or what happened to it.

I made this cake last night at my house and it's gone today!  I have 2 requests for the recipe already!  The only thing I did differently was make a strawberry cream cheese icing with 2 3oz. pkg of cream cheese, a stick of butter, teaspoon of vanilla, and measured out powdered sugar to around 5 cups.  Everyone loved it!

This was a good recipe. A little too sweet for me but everyone else loved it. I had trouble getting the frosting to work out so I used cream cheese frosting and everyone loved it.

My husband's favorite -- he asks for it every year on his birthday.  You can also be lazy & just 9x13 it all & forget the three layers.  Tastes exactly the same & way less work!

Pretty color, and moist. But in making this I think I discovered that I'm just not a huge stawberry cake fan, but that's no reflection on the recipe.

Great cake!!  As previous reviews suggested, I pureed the strawberries in the blender then strained them to remove those annoying seeds.  I used about 3/4 of this puree in the cake batter.  I experiemented with the icing suggested but found it was too...well, syrupy for me.  So I used the Whipped Cream Cheese Frosting (found on this site) and added the remaining 1/4 of the berries in at the last.  Everyone couldn't stop eating it!! :)  Next time I think I might try adding sliced or slivered almonds between the cake layers for a little crunch.

I was looking for a different yet tasty recipe noone in my family ever made for Thanksgiving, and this is the one!!!  The cake was eaten up the very next day!  So I made another one a couple days later.  I used the advice of others and substituted the icing with Cool Whip!  I just mixed some of the thawed out strawberries with the cool whip and it gave it a pinkish texture!  After I iced the cake, I topped it with fresh strawberries!!  You can find some of the best freshest stawberries at Publix Grocery this time of year! Thanks Judalee!!!

Wonderful and easy to make. I pureed and drained the strawberry ( just like the other reviewers advised)-2/3 went to the batter and the rest to the icing. I usually put a couple of Tablespoon of Lemon Juice in the frosting to cut the sweetness, this time I forgot cause I just can't stop lickin'it. And also add eggs one at a time and but do not over mix. I set mine at 350 for 1 hr and 5 mins. But check for done-ness after the 55 minutes interval. Next time I'll use Cool Whipped Frosting (found in this website) instead.  Yummy cake, Thanks Judalee!

This cake is delicious and looks beautiful!  I used fresh strawberries instead of frozen and garnished with the extras.  Had to adjust quite a bit on the frosting - but came out wonderful.  Definately a keeper.

This is a delicious strawberry cake.  I used fresh strawberries and it was absolutely wonderful.  I baked it in a 9x13 pan and punched holes in it with the end of a spoon and let the icing run into the cake.  It was moist and it went fast!

I followed the recipe to the letter, used a fresh cake mix, as were all other ingredients. The cake taste ok but had a less than desirable rise and did not maintain that after removal from the oven. I didn't care for the icing.

Easy & nice change of pace.  Used sugar free Jello & made these into muffins.  Diced the strawberries instead of pureeing them, which added nice texture.  Also added a dollop of strawberry preserves as a "surprise" in the center (filled muffin cup halfway, added preserves to center with a spoon then added more batter to cover preserves and fill to top).  This was a nice surprise that the kids enjoyed and my daughter had fun making these with me. Thx Judalee!

The flavor was good, but the texture was definitely off.  It was very dense and not at all light and fluffy.  It definitely didn't make 3- 9 inch layers either,I got 2- 8inch rounds out of it and they only baked for about 30 minutes.  I will continue my search for a home made strawberry cake.

Made cupcakes for a potluck, and they were a huge success! They're light, fluffy, and perfectly moist. The jello does mean they have a distinctly artificial taste to them, so if you want real strawberry taste, this is not the recipe for you. I don't mind it, but it was much stronger than I'd hoped. I also did not make the frosting, and instead opted for a honey vanilla bean frosting found elsewhere.

I have been making this cake for years - here are changes my recipe calls for mix 4 eggs with 3/4 cup oil then add white cake mix and gelatin which has been softened with 1/2 cup water.  My recipe also calls for frozen strawberries but because of all the problems the other viewers had I used fresh strawberries in the cake & in the icing.  I did not mix the icing very long because it will get runny.  I used 2 9" pans with cake strips (they make ur cake rise flat so u
don't have to cut the tops).  It came out great - I would recommend either wax paper on the bottom or parchment paper.

Incredibly good!  I followed Ramajohn's suggestions and used just over 1/2 cup of puree in the cake and about 3 TBSP in the frosting.  Perfect in a 9 x 13 pan.

Although I read many recipes and reviews, I don't normally leave one. Honestly, I wasn't sure about making a cake from a mix and with an imitation flavor such as jello… even with the real frozen strawberries (I started with whole frozen berries). I will have to admit that I thoroughly enjoyed the rave reviews from the family which were certainly quite REAL. There were many desserts and this was the only one that was completely wiped out. The only changes I made were 1) used grape seed oil instead of vegetable since it’s healthier. 2)I used my own butter/cream cheese frosting with a tiny bit of the pureed strawberries in it which wasn’t too sweet. 3) I used a 9x13 pan and put the frosting on before the cake was completely cool. I added some strawberry chunks on top.

perfect. I did puree the berries simply per preference. I also used a different frosting "whipped cream cheese frosting" from this site which turned out so good. It tasted just like strawberry ice cream. :)

I always have yellow cake mix so I decided to make it with it. I don't see how a white mix would have been better because my cake came out very well. I did use 3/4 c oil and 3/4 c of water because that's how my lemon jello is made. It worked and I used a powered sugar glaze that had milk, a little butter and vanilla. I just drizzled it on it was fine. I have also made this cake with a cream cheese frosting too. The glaze seems to be my favorite since it is lighter.

I have made this several times and everyone loves it!  Make sure you are using unsweetened frozen strawberries.  I have a feeling the way too sweet reviewers are using sweetened ones.  I do not use the frosting with this recipe either.  I use a cream cheese frosting from the BC cookbook.

I put the whole bag of strawberries in the blender and then put the whole mixture into the cake. I used the cool whipped frosting on the site.

I made this cake for my child's first birthday party.  There was enough for 2 nine inch round cake pans and 1 square cake pan.  I made the round cake, adding fresh strawberry slices in between layers, and used the rest to make a square cake that I cut in the shape of the number one.  Wonderful!!!  Iced with the cream cheese icing (with melted white chocolate chips) from this site and couldn't stop eating it.

This is unbelievable!  I made this recipe into cupcakes, and used the cream cheese icing recipe from this site for the topping.  I took the remaining strawberries, which I pureed, and mixed it in the cream cheese icing.  I used a regular sized cupcake pan and the regular sized cupcake baking cups.  This is absolutely delicious, and tastes VERY similar to the most popular cupcake sold at a local cupcake store in my town.  Will make this again and again.  Thank you!!!

This was a moist cake, but the flavor did not taste very berry-like.  It had an almost chemical-like flavor.  Maybe that was the jello.  Anyhow, my coworkers liked it, but I couldn't get past something about the flavor.

I wasn't sure about this cake as I wanted to make one from scratch and it called for adding a cake mix--I shouldn't have worried! Took it to an adult birthday party where cake isn't expected to be a hit...everone loved it! I didn't have frozen strawberries, used one can and some fresh...had about 5 people ask me for the recipe and 2 requestes to bring it for their birthdays!  Thanks for the recipe!

This is so delicious!!! It is so moist! I used whole frozen (but thawed) unsweetened strawberries. Everyone loved this cake! I used the "Cool Whipped Frosting" using fat free whipped cream and it was still awesome! I put the frosting directly on the cake (not adding strawberries to it) I chopped white chocolate chips and topped the frosting with them, and then with sliced strawberries. These flavors were amazing together! I am bringing the leftovers to the office tomorrow!

This cake tastes very good, but it's not very pretty. I used a 9x13 pan instead of making 3 layers. I don't recommend trying to use this icing on a 3 layer cake, but it works well for a 9x13 cake. As others have said, it's more of a glaze than an icing. I used fresh strawberries. Next time I think I'll puree the strawberries that are in the cake and some of the strawberries in the glaze. I liked the look of strawberry slices in the glaze though, so I'll leave some of those whole.

Didn't really care too much for this cake.  It was way too heavy, but the flavor was good.  My husband loved it though.  I figure if I'm gonna cheat and use a packaged cake mix I will just follow the directions on the box and just add the jello powder and strawberries next time.

The taste of this cake was excellent. The only problem I had was with the icing. Trying to ice the sides of the cake was so hard because the icing was too running and dripped down to the bottom of the plate. However, the cake is great and I would definitely make this again.

AWESOME! So good....made them into cupcakes and skipped the frosting and just used regular white from a can to save time.  Used fresh strawberries.  Everyone loved them and they were quick to go.  Some people even had 3! Would definitely make again.  A winner.

Made this for my dad's birthday. Went over VERY well, though I found it a bit dense at first. Great flavor, but I think I'll use the 9x13 pan next time.

This was really good, I just baked it in a 9x13 & it turned out a bit small doing it that way, but the flavor was really good. This is perfect if you like a really moist cake. I also used a White Chocolate Frosting on it & the flavors together were wonderful.

I just used the recipie for the cake as I have my own icing recipie.  
The cake was very moist but the strawberry flavor is not as prominant as I'd like.  I believe I can adjust this recipie and do better.

I made this for my husband's birthday and he loved it.  He's not normally a cake eater, but this cake he could not get enough of.  I did make a few changes.  I used 2 cake pans and baked it for 40 minutes and only used 1/2 cup of oil.  I also didn't use any strawberries in the batter, instead I drained the liquid from the frozen strawberries and used the pieces as filling between layers.  Also opted for Cool Whip Frosting (from this site).  The combination was amazing!

I made this cake for a co-workers birthday and it turned out perfect! The only changes I made were using a 9" x 13" pan and pureeing the strawberries before adding them to the batter and icing. It made my entire kitchen smell wonderful! THe icing wasn't runny at all, although I think I will add some Cool Whip next time to reduce the sweetness. Great Recipe, will make it again!

My husband wanted a strawberry cake this year, for his birthday, and after reading all of the positive reviews for this one, I decided to try it. I used 2 9-inch round baking pans,  instead of 3 - and in my opinion, the batter is the perfect amount for 2 pans.. using 3 basically just gives you the option of having an extra layer for presentation. I followed the cake recipe, "as is", and thought it came out great... not too sweet, nor bland.. and it came out a nice bright pink color. However, I decided to use, "Caroline's Chocolate Fudge Frosting", also from this website, not only because of all the negative reviews for the frosting suggested for this cake, but my husband also wanted a chocolate frosting and the combination was delicious. I added sliced strawberries to the frosting in between the layers, as suggested by other reviewers.. Again, my husband and I thought this cake was great and I will be making it again in the future.

Suberb cake! This was a very dense cake with lots of wonderful strawberry flavor. I baked it in a 9x13 pan and used Cool Whip with added strawberries as the "icing." This will part of my favorite cake collection.

This cake was a hit. I made it with cream cheese frosting from this site and added th strawberries to that frosting. It was a HUGE it and will make it again. I used it for a baby shower and was asked to make it for a birthday 3 days later. Big hit. Thank you

My husband said "This is the birthday cake I'd like every year!"  Need advise though - my frosting was more of a glaze.  Everyone loved it, but I'm not sure what I did wrong!!  BTW, the 9x13 pan worked out perfectly, but it did cook a little longer.

This cake was good, but I was a little disappointed.  I found it a bit dry.  If I were to make it again, I wouldn't add the 3 tablespoons of flour--I'd just leave it as is.

This cake is delicious. However, next time I will use less oil to make it even lighter. Also, it stuck to the pan (which I greased and floured), which no one else mentioned. I followed the suggestion of another reviewer to make a Cool Whip frosting, which was perfect for the cake. I stirred in half the frozen strawberries with the frosting, and then covered the top with sliced fresh strawberries. Pretty and delicious!

I agree witht he other reviewer - the cake itself is great, but the icing portion needs adjusted.  It is too runny and not enough for a three layer cake. I used it more as a glaze between each layer and on top.  My husband and his family love these type of fruit cakes, but I thought it was a little too sweet.  Vanilla ice cream served with it really helps cut the sweetness.  Overall, very good cake to take to a pitch-in or church dinner, etc.

I've made this cake twice and there is never a piece left.  I usually refrigerator the cake when I'm through.  I use french vanilla icing and mix it with the strawberries.  This is most definitely a favorite with everyone.

This cake is fabulous!  The cake is not too sweet, so the sweetness of the icing complements it perfectly!!!  The icing never got to a "spreading" consistancy, even with 1+ cups additional sugar.  I used fresh berries and cut them up before mixing.  I decided to make it a glaze rather than an icing!  Too good!!!

The cake was gone in ONE day! It was fluffy and the icing was great. You may want to double the icing recipe if you like a decent amount of icing. I made this in a 9 x 13 glass pan and it was marverlous. Making it again and again.

It was okay, but it wasn't at all what I expected. The frosting was a mess, it never turned out right no matter what I did and the cake wasn't the best I have had.  I may use it again, but I will probably search around for other recipes first.

This cake had a great stawberry taste.  I used a regular cake pan, which turned out good since the frosting was runny (I frosted while it was warm), and I added fresh sliced strawberries on top of the frosting, which made a wonderful presentation.  Rave reviews from the whole family.

Very good...I also used the basic white cake and changed it from a strawberry cake to a banana cake using fresh mashed bananas, banana pie & pudding filling rather than strawberry jello.  I created a frosting with cream cheese, powdered sugar and a little mashed banana.  This was a wonderfully delicious alternative.  I'm thinking of trying it with orange (somehow).

This is a really great cake. I t was easy, but taste professional. It's very moist and delicious. I must have gained a couple pounds since I made it because I can't stop eating it. It's just great. I made a cream cheese icing in addition to the strawberry one, but I discovered that the stawberry icing is the perfect match. The only problem I had was the fact that the cake is so heavy so my top layer split in half. Next time I'll make cupcakes. You should try this cake!

Great tasting cake!  What to try a different icing do this:  Make your own cream cheese icing or buy 2 cans of cream cheese frosting and add 1-8 oz. pkg. of cream cheese and mix well.  Garnish with fresh strawberries!  Delicious!

A delicious, very moist cake.  When I and 2 other people made it ,
the cake fell each time, I think because the moistness and weight of it.
It was also difficult to get the frosting to be the proper consistency 
for spreading.  It is a great cake though if you are going to serve it soon
after assembling it.  Very sweet and yummy!  Note:
Mix the completed frosting with canned or homemade frosting,
then it's spreadable.

I couldn't get the icing to thicken without getting too sweet, so I just poured it over the cake right after I took it out of the oven and it made a nice glaze.  My husband loved it!

Favorite birthday cake.  Use most of the strawberry juice in the CAKE so icing doesn't all slide down the sides.  VERY MOIST.

I haven’t tasted it because of my diet, but the way my kids and husband raves about it is what my rating is based on. I used 3/4 cup oil and it was still super moist and sufficient oily to the touch,  I think anymore would’ve been way too much. Other wise followed as written. I did not make the glaze as I opted for strawberry cream cheese buttercream that I threw together.  Per my husband these cakes I’ve made are “better than any cake we’ve paid hundreads for at the bakery.” I’ve also tried the too much chocolate cake & the almond wedding cake from this site!

We made this in a 9x13 cake pan and used a basic cream cheese frosting from this site.  We added 2 TBS of strawberry puree to the frosting.  I found this cake to be quite sweet but my  son loved it!  It was quite moist.  If we make it again I will definitely add more strawberries to the batter for a bigger strawberry flavor.

Have made this recipe for years now and we keep coming back to it! my favorite way to ice it is to take Cool Whip, mix in the extra strawberry bits so it turns a slight shade of pink, and spread over the cake. It is a great balance to the tasty, dense homemade cake texture. I did try buttercream the first time I made it, and the icing was too thick to spread without destroying the cake. The Cool Whip works and tastes delish!!

I’ve been looking for a strawberry cake recipe in all the usual places.  I settled on this cake due to high ratings and similar recipes on other sites. This still isn’t the cake I’m wanting. However, I’ve baked 2 using this recipe this week. According to the recipients, they enjoyed the cake.  My 4-star rating is because I’ve had what I think is a better strawberry cake...but can’t find the recipe. My search continues for a cake that doesn’t contain jello. After reading other reviews, I thawed frozen unsweetened strawberries in the refrigerator over night. I drained the juice which collected.  I puréed the remaining thawed strawberries with my immersion blender. Next, I simmered the purée to thicken slightly. I cooled the purée before adding 1/2 cup to the cake mixture.  For the icing, I used a cream cheese recipe and added about 1/4 c of the purée.  I believe this took care of extra liquid which some found to be a problem.

My mother had bought a cookbook from The Grand Ole Oprey, and this recipe for strawberry cake was in it! My aunt used to make this cake whenever we visited but she never would give us her recipe. Now,that both my mother and aunt are passed on,and the recipe and cookbook were lost,I'm so glad I found it again to make. I love LOVE this cake!!!

Worst cake I have ever made altho it looked nice with the strawberries.  I took it to a family gathering and I am the only one who ate it.  I ate enough to know it was terrible....like eating sugar with a spoon !  This recipe is out of my collection forever. It had a sugary and artificial taste as well. I even tried it by removing the icing but that was not enough to make it good.

This is my 2nd time making this delicious fruity cake! Once I made it for my daughter's b'day  & then, my niece asked me to make for her special 50th b'day! The only thing I changed was I used the juice from the frozen strawberries instead of just plain water to mix w/the jell-o....Oh, I also used 2 cake pans instead of 3. For the inside layer,  i used a very thin layer of icing on the top of the bottom layer & then I covered it w/lots of sliced strawberries, about 10.  I then placed the 2nd layer on top of that & covered the top & sides w/the lucious strawberry icing.  Next time I will try adding 4oz of cream cheese to the icing.  My husband likes that type of icing.  If u like strawberries...u should really enjoy this moist cake!  Yum!!!

This cake is so moist and tasty! The reason I'm only giving four stars is because I do feel you need to purée the strawberries in order to make sure the strawberry flavor is spread evenly in the actual cake mix (and use 3/4 of the amount the recipe calls for, not 1/2). However, I feel if you purée the strawberries for the frosting then it does in fact make the frosting very runny and impossible to spread onto the cake without adding a lot more confectioners sugar to thicken it... and that's even following the other reviewer suggestions to use only 1/4 of the strawberries in the frosting, instead of the half the recipe calls for. I'll definitely be making this again but in order to make the perfect cake, the proportions do need to be changed as well as how the strawberries should be added to both the cake mix (puréed) and the frosting (not puréed.)

I was nervous when I made this cake. It's my first time and strawberry isn't really my favorite. I did it for my son's 2nd bday. The kids and adults loved it! My tips would be: 1. Let the eggs out overnight before adding them in the cake mix. It would work wonders on the fluffiness of your cake. 2. I used apple sauce to replace the oil. 3. I only used 2/3 cups of UNSWEETENED thawed strawberries. This helped lessen the sweetness of the entire recipe. 4. I just used a buttercream frosting from Betty Crocker. The one I made from the recipe was runny. 5. I just used one 9 x 11 pan. Overall, my cake turned not so sweet and perfect for everybody's taste. Next time, I would use cream cheese frosting and see how it goes.

I made it with raspberries for Valentines Day. To top it I used a chocolate cookie cake I made previously in the same heart shape pan, white chocolate ganache in beweeen and on top to drizzle with fresh raspberries. Simply delicious, this is a keeper!

Made this cake for my daughter's 16th birthday. Baking is not my thing; despite my lack of culinary aptitude, this cake turned out moist and delicious. On the frosting, be prepared to add in extra confectioners sugar to give it body, as the recipe suggests.

I first tried making a made from scratch version I found and it turned out terrible so I tried this…..this is a very moist, full of flavor cake and a hit for my son's birthday.  I followed the the directions given.

I pureed the strawberries and used 1/2 cup in the cake like RAMAJOHN said and made this for a co-worker who ordered a birthday cake for his wife.  On Monday he stepped into my cubicle and just looked at me.  I was scared at first, but he said it was amazing and had more orders for me.

Puree strawberries first!
Judging from what other reviewers said, I drained well and pureed the (unsweetened) strawberries. I added 1/2 cup of the puree to the cake batter and ONLY 2 TBSP of the puree to the icing, which comes out to a PERFECT spreading consistency. I made this in a 9x13 baking dish and the icing was the perfect amount to cover the top nicely.

This review is for the cake only. This was a really tasty strawberry cake. We used a vanilla buttercream for the frosting and used a cream cheese filling in between the layers. I only had enough batter for 2 9" layers and ended up making an additional batch for the 3rd layer. Delicious!

Im not a huge fan of strawberry cake, but my husband is so I decided to give this a try. I made the batter as instructed. For the frosting though, I did one stick of butter, 2 cups confectionary sugar, and a little evaporated milk. And I put in a tiny bit of strawberries to add color.  This frosting turned out awesome. I also added mini chocolate chips to the side :) looked awesome! Tasted great too!

This cake turned out very well, but I made a significant last-minute change: it calls for ONE WHOLE CUP of oil, when the cake mix only called for 1/3 cup.  So I added only 1/2 cup oil (I always use light-tasting olive oil) and it came out great -- plenty moist. I don't have a food processor, so I chopped the fresh strawberries small and then used a potato masher. I was concerned about the artificial flavor in the jello, but the real berries made it taste right.  Also, I prefer a traditional frosting, so I used "Best Buttercream Frosting" from this site and just whipped in about 5 ounces mashed strawberries.  The berries caused the frosting to separate, but I just spread it and then chilled the whole cake.  The frosting had a sort of textured appearance, but it looked nice and all tasted great.  Thanks!

Moist and delicious! Very easy to make. I always use fresh strawberries, not frozen. I have Leo substituted other fruits. I just made a black cherry version. Black cherry jello and fresh cherries for the substitutions. It came out even tastier than the strawberry version!

Substituted yellow cake mix used frozen fresh strawberries from our garden last summer. The intensity of the strawberry flavor was incredible. For frosting I used 1 stick butter 4 c.powdered sugar, 1/2 t vanilla with the rest of the defrosted strawberries.

Made this for my 5 year old's Max & Ruby birthday cake...LOVED it!  Great flavor, easy to make.  I followed the previous reviewer, Ramajohn's, advice and only did 2 TBSP puree for the icing.  Used fresh strawberries, I didnt strain the seeds, wasnt noticable when eating.  Highly recommend if you have kid that wants a tasty pink birthday cake!

I only made the cake from this recipe and used a strawberry cream cheese recipe from another site. But the cake itself was fantastic. What a delicious flavor. I didn't find it overly sweet and my husband loved it! It was very moist even though I only used 1/2 cup canola oil. I also used 1 whole cup of water instead of 1/2. I will definitely use this strawberry cake recipe from now on.

This cake was very good and extra moist it was hard to stop eating it. I made the cake for my grandma. Strawberry cake is her favorite. She loved it. This is the first strawberry cake I have made and this will be the only one I will ever make when I do make a cake.

Although I wouldn't put this cake in the "to die for" category, it was really quite good.  I, too, made it in two 9" round cake pans and used the Cool Whip Frosting recipe from this site.  My guests seemed to really like it and I will make it again.

This was an excellent cake taste-wise! The thing that didn't work too well for me was the frosting. It wouldn't thicken enough and it kept sliding off of the cake. I love the frosting taste though. I might try making it differently next time or try a different icing completely. Overall, it was a pretty good strawberry cake.

The cake portion was light and tasty.  It really had a nice flavour to it.  The frosting had a nice flavour too, but a bit sweet and I had to double the frosting recipe to cover the cake fully. I will probably make the cake again, but I will try the frosting recipe others have been recommending.

I loved this recipe.  Have been looking for a strawberry cake recipe that is similar to what my mother-in-law used to make.  It was perfect.  Tasted just the same.  I used frozen/sweetened strawberries from last season.  All I had to do is squeeze out the excess juice.  Thanks for the recipe.

I followed the direction of the other reviews and strained the strawberries prior to putting them in the cake batter.  I alternated the strawberry layers with white chocolate layers, made the filling from the Whipped Cream Frosting on this site, and put strawberries layered in the filling and fanned out on top.  A HIT at my friend's Baby Shower.

2 cups of confectioner's sugar for the icing???  Yeah, right.  I used almost an entire bag of sugar, and still could have used more!  This was such a frustrating cake for such a simple taste.  I don't think I'll make this one again, unless I use a different icing.  Way too much trouble for what it's worth.

Okay, this frosting just doesn't work!  I just couldn't get it to thicken up to any semblance of a normal frosting.  I put it on the cake anyway, and it just looked awful.  But, the cake has potential.  Use a different frosting and keep the cake recipe.  If you attempt the frosting, be prepared to use 2 boxes of confectioner's sugar.

wow! this cake was amazing! i read the reviews prior to making the cake and found that a few people thought the frosting was too sweet. i added 3/4 of the frozen strawberries to the cake batter and only 1/3 to the frosting, after mixing i found that the frosting was a little too sweet for me, so i added 2 cups of strawberry flavored cool whip and it was so good! i couldnt believe how good of a dessert this was thank you so much!

WOW!  This cake was incredible!  My husband dared to say it was the best cake I ever made (and I have made several!)  I decided on cream cheese icing and added the strawberries to it.  It was not as stiff as desired, but the taste was great!  I also used "whipped" cream layers in between with sliced fresh strawberries.  I will DEFINATELY be making this again soon!  Maybe for Valentine's Day!

I would have given this recipe 5 stars, except that the icing was a runny mess.  I suggest following other reviewers advise and use fewer strawberries and more sugar and/or cream cheese.  Other than that, it was a tasty cake though.

Actually a 4.5 score.  This cake was very good......very moist and looked very pretty. I added some sliced fresh strawberries on top for presentation. BUT, the frosting took a lot of "adjusting" and was still kind of runny (2 cups of powdered sugar and 8 oz. of cream cheese).  I kept the cake chilled in the refrigerator which worked out great.  Eating it cool added to it's "Summer mystique".  Makes a great dessert for a Summer picnic when strawberries are in season.  Definately a keeper despite the trouble with the frosting.

This cake was a BIG hit!! My father-in-law loved it!! I had cherry Jello and didn't effect the taste. I also had extra fresh Louisiana strawberries so I mixed them with Cool Whip and used that as my frosting. It was light and just right for these hot days

This was GREAT! I only used 2 9in pans. I placed fresh sliced strawberries between the layers.Also placed chocolate dipped strawberries on top. The frosting did take more than 2 cups of sugar though. Everyone went crazy over this!

I made this recipe for easter dinner. I was afraid that it would be too sweet. Wow, was I wrong. The cake was moist and the flavour was perfect. I did take the advice of some previous reviews about the icing - I put the margarine and icing sugar together and then I added strawberries until I reached the right consistency. I did require much more icing than the recipe called for to cover the entire cake. Next time I might try it with fresh strawberries and whipped cream! Thanks so much. this recipe couldn't have been easier!

I tried this recipe because of all the rave reviews. It was very simple and easy to mix up. It took way longer to bake than I expected. It was too moist, and the tooth pick came out gooey after the listed baking time. I put it back in for additional baking time. I think I dried it out by doing that. The flavor was good, mine was just a tad dry. I will adjust the bake time next time. I took another reviewers tip and made the cream cheese icing. It was superb!!!! With a little adjustment of cook time, this is a keeper!

I feel silly contradicting so many people, but this cake really wasn't what I'd expected. It was very moist, but even with the fresh strawberries the flavor was just kind of weird, and my frosting didn't work either. I hope others have more luck!
