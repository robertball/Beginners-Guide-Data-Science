These rolls are so easy and are even good the next day (if there are any left). I am going to get rid of my other roll recipes because this is the best.

Very good, very moist rolls. I made the dough in the bread machine, then put the rolls in a pan to rise. bake in oven and they turn out wonderful every time.

These rolls are the best!  It was easy to follow the recipe also.  I found that I had to add more flour than the recipe called for though.  Probably about a cup of flour extra.  Maybe it was because here in Michigan it is so humid?  Anyway everyone loved the rolls!

I give these 5 stars for the texture of the rolls and the versatility.  I added crushed dried rosemary, greased the pan with olive oil, and brushed more olive oil on top for the final rising and baking.  I could easily see using the basic recipe as the basis for cinnamon rolls, too, because the rolls were so tender.

I bake a lot of bread/rolls, and this is a recipe I'll use regularly.

These rolls are great, light and fluffy. I thought I messed up on the kneading but the rolls still came out great. Next time I think I'll try an egg wash rather than with butter as the butter turned a whitish color when baked. Thanks for the recipe, it reminds me of my moms buns. Oh and I also only got 12 buns from this recipe, although they were quite large...the way I like them.

I found this recipe very easy to do, but it did not turn out at all.  The rolls were very heavy, almost cake like.  At first I thought that maybe it was the yeast that I used since sometimes if yeast is not working properly, the bread will come out cakey, but when I redid the recipe with new yeast, it still did not turn out.  I was very disappointed as I was really wanting pan rolls like the soft and fluffy ones that you can get in the store.  But other than being very cakey, they did however have a good taste, hence the three stars.

Wonderful, wonderful rolls.  They look just like the picture and are light as air.  I am a bread junkie, always searching for the perfect recipe.  The search is over!

We had a cook out tonight and I used this recipe to make hamburger rolls. Everyone loved them, and said I'm not to buy rolls anymore! Their soft with a very nice flavor. They were easy to make too. I've tried a couple other roll recipes from here that were very bland, but these rolls, I can say have a very nice taste.

I used a 13x9 and muffin baking pan to bake the rolls.  Turned out really nice and was easy to make.  The taste was good too.

Very easy, great texture.  Follow the recipe exactly.  Also divided it evenly and made about 32 rolls.  Took to a potluck dinner with a stick of butter and they went fast!  Great recipe.

Excellent! I let them raise for 2 hours, made them into dough balls and then let them raise again for another 45 mins. Didn't take long in the oven to bake. I used Splenda instead of sugar. Tasted just like the famous 'steak house' yeast rolls! Try this recipe, you won't regret it!!!!

These rolls are great.  Makes a large quantity -- I got 32 rolls.  I used my bread machine to make the dough and it was so easy.  Have made them three times and will make them many more!

These were easy to make and had a pretty good flavor.  They weren't as light and fluffy as I wanted them, otherwise I would give them a 5 star.

Made these for Thanksgiving and they were wonderful!  I just put the ingredients in my bread maker to make the dough and followed the rest of the recipe.  These are the best rolls I've ever made!  They taste almost like Challah rolls mmmmm!  The only thing is they need to be served warm, once they cool down they are nothing special.  Warm each one for 10 seconds in the microwave before serving -- tastes great with butter and raspberry jam!  I don't know about serving these in a bread basket because they need to be served very warm.

This is the best homemade dinner rolls.  The only thing I have changed is I use 1 TBLS of yeast.  They are best the first day, they tend to dry out after that.

This is the best recipe I've come across in a long time for basic dinner rolls!  Everyone I've made them for is impressed and can't stop eating them.  They are easy to make and make great sweet rolls, too!

I customized this recipe to make 2 dozen rolls and didn't really measure the ingredients, just kind of estimated. The recipe is flexible. They turned out great! The aroma was lovely and, yes they looked store bought but they tasted good.

These rolls seem to be fool-proof and had a nice texture which just melted in the mouth.  However, I found them to lack flavor.  The rolls were good, but not anything special.

Very flavorful, light and fluffy.  I cut back on the butter by about 3 tablespoons.  Could use a little more salt.

These were wonderfully moist and DELICIOUS!  My husband and children loved them.  I halved the recipe and it still turned out great.  The leftovers make great ham & cheese sandwiches.

I made two pull-apart loaves. Mine came out a little on the sweet side. There seemed to be a little extra water. I added more flour than the recipe calls for. Overall, people loved them. It was hard to get them to share. They're good warm or cold with butter.

My sister made these for the holiday after I found the recipe for her.  They were very fluffy and light...a little sweeter than we like them, but hey, next time we can compensate for that!  Overall, pretty good.

I mixed these up in my bread machine using the dough cycle. I did not have time to let them rise again after they were shaped; so they were kind of heavy but...they were wonderful anyway!!! The flavor is incredible. Exactly what I was looking for. My family LOVES bread-they didn't even ask for butter or honey with these. Although...:)

Great rolls!  I made these for a family bar-b-que and everyone loved them.  Dough is very easy to work with.  I used salted butter. Aunt Pete, who is 83, said it was better than her recipe.  I have requests to bring them to all holiday meals.

It's hard to impress a bread junkie, but this recipe did just that!  I have been making this recipe now for over two years and it always gets rave reviews.  I have a large extended family, so for holidays I have to make 6-7 dozen to accommodate second...and third... helpings.  

I make the recipe as written and they never fail.  By the way, these freeze very well and taste fresh after reheating in the oven or microwave.
