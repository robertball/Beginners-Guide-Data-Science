I have been looking for a great fruit dip recipe for some time and this was awesome! I did half the recipe though, because It was just for two people. As read in other reviews, it is super important to let the ingredients soften. After cutting the ingredients in half, I ended up only using two tablespoons Kahlua and one tablespoon milk. This dip is a lot thicker than other dips I have tried, but you can change the consistency by adding more milk or cool whip. I am going to keep looking for the perfect fruit dip, but this one is definetly a keeper.
As for the ingredients I used fat free cool whip, reduced fat sour cream and full fat cream cheese.

Sneaky me, I added more Kaluha than called for.  This was a pretty good desert - very easy at least!

This was excellent!  I used low fat cream cheese, sour cream, and cool whip.  I also used Splenda/ brown sugar blend.  Almost guilt free too with my changes!!!

This dip is AMAZING. It makes a huge batch, which is good since it is so tasty!! I have substituted actual coffee for the coffee liquor and it tastes just fine. Maybe even a little better than the liquor since the coffee flavor is a little stronger.

I made this for my Bunco group and they loved it.  I served it with pineapple, grapes, strawberries, and graham cracker sticks.  The graham cracker sticks were everyone's favorite with the dip.  My sister-in-law ate the dip alone with a spoon.

Superb! I can’t not rave enough about this recipe. I brought it to work for my own birthday potluck and EVERYONE loved it! I served the dip with cut up apples, strawberries, kiwis, grapes and pretzels. It was such a hit... I’ve been instructed not to return to work without sharing the recipe! Thanks, Wendy, for a great recipe!

Stop the presses!  This dip was oh so YUMMY!  Everyone loved it.  Made it just as written.  Do make sure you soften the cream cheese 1st, or it is a bit of a pain to get rid of the lumps.  Definitely a new favorite for us!

I followed the recipe as instructed. It was wonderful! I served it with strawberries, cherries, pineapple, tart apples and red grapes. I didn't soften the cream cheese enough, so it was initally lumpy, but I was able to eventually work the lumps out in the mixer. I'm going to keep making this!

Love the recipe and so did the party I brought this to!!! We served it with fresh fruit ~ grapes, strawberries, apples, pineapple and blueberries ~ LOVED IT!! I would suggest making it the night before and letting it sit overnight in the fridge, it taste better that way... Thanks for the great recipe!!!

My kids love this. To make it guilt-free I use fat-free or low-fat cream cheese, fat free sour cream, Cool-Whip Free, Splenda brown sugar blend and vanilla extract instead of the liquer. Nobody can tell it's not loaded with fat and sugar and it's delicious!

Totally awesome and easy!  I made this for a party and received tons of requests for the recipe.  I used Starbucks coffee liqueur which is so strong and flavorful.

I like the idea of this creamy, coffee flavored dip for fruit. Seemed like a good idea for pepping up your standard fruit platter. Another plus: it was very easy to make. On the other hand, it was a bit sweet for my taste. Also, none of my guests (husband's 40th birthday party) went for it. I mean, no one tried it at all! Even though I put a cute little hand-made label by it so people would know what it was. They devoured the fruit platter, but ignored the dip. (Oh well. And I bought a bottle of Kahlua specially for this!) It might go over better at a different type of event. (I think another reviewer mentioned bridal showers?)

I made this dip for a bridal shower and served it with cantalope, pineapple, strawberries, and grapes. However, no one ate it! I thought it was okay, but probably will never make again. I was disappointed.

I took this to my friend's son's going away party.  He's leaving for the Air Force and I wanted to bring something unusual.  Everyone raved about the flavor.  It's really good with pineapple and strawberries.  My hand mixer won't disperse the cream cheese well, so I had to smoosch it together by hand.  It was well worth the effort.  Thanks for the great recipe, Wendy!

Very very good. Light coffe flavor and creamy texture.  I served with grapes and pineapple-strawberry picks.  It looked great too.  I didn't have Kahlua and after reading up on it, learned that Kahlua is a mixture of vodka, coffee and sugar.  So I mixed maybe 2 oz of very sweet coffee (cooled) with the same amount of vodka.  Terrific!  There's such a small amount of it in the recipe, I can't imagine the real thing will substantially change this.  Delicious!

Fantastic! I loved this. I made half the recipe exactly as written. I am usually adamant about not cooking with alcohol, but this sounded so tasty that I decided to try it anyways and I'm glad I did.

I made this almost exactly like the recipe said.  I'm pregnant so instead of the liqeur, I added 1/3 cup of half caff maxwell house coffee and it was amazing!  I took it to our weekly friday night small group.  The first reactions to hearing it was a coffee fruit dip, were that of interested.  Once they tried it, they reacted with gusto!  This dip was a huge hit.  One friend wanted to eat it out of the bowl with a spoon!  I have great plans for using this dip in the future!
