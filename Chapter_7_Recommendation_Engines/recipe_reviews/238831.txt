I used this for chicken thighs and took the suggestion of AuntE and added minced peaches and extra hot sauce. Stuck to chicken as it basted on and had a wonderful taste.

I loved this bbq sauce!  I had a half jar of fig pepper jelly that I wanted to use up and it was delicious in this sauce. I had to use white wine vinegar as I was out of the other. I made vegan ribs and the sauce was amazing. Thank you.

I made this using Aunte suggestion of peach but used nectarine and I used  peach jalape√±o jam and 2tbsp of my red pepper jelly also, the taste was good but it didn't stick to my chicken wings with that gooey look I was expecting from a BBQ sauce,, don't know what I did wrong just looked like baked chicken wings

A very good sweet, spicy sauce. I made quite a bit of habanero pepper jelly, and have tried using it in various sauces and glazes. This one is a keeper.
I wanted it a little thinner to use as a sauce over a smoked pork butt, so I thinned it down with 2 tablespoons of bourbon. Turned out wonderfully.

Thank you. TY TY TY! Finally, some way to use this rediculous pepper jelly someone gave my husband because they didn't know what to do with it.... And, fabulous sauce as well. Thank you for the quick and productive dinner idea
