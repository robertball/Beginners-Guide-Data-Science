I am the submitter of this recipe.  My original submission did not say 'frozen' strawberry daiquiri mixer.  We use the non-frozen version that comes in a plastic jug/bottle.  It is available in regular mix or lite mix.

I tripled the recipe for a party I was hosting. It was a bit to sweet for my taste and I found it to be a bit to thick.

Made 2 batches of this for the whole family on Christmas. One with booze and one virgin. This drink was loved by all! I added 1 and 1/4 c vodka to the spiked version because 1 c amongst all the juices and sprite didn’t seem like enough. You still couldn’t taste the vodka at all, I’m glad I made the adjustment.

Instead of Sprite I used mt dew,  and substituted regular orange juice for fresh squeezed pineapple orange juice and used citrone vodka, garnished with cherries!! Soo good and so much more like fruity pebbles!
