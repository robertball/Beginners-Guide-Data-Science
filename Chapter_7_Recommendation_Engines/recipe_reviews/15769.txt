Not bad. But here is another twist on this recipe. It's called a Seattle Manhattan. Use Jim Beam in place of the rum and add Starbucks Coffee Liqeuer. It adds a nice coffee flavor, but becareful too much and it will be way to strong!

This is a great manhattan, but as a purist, it's not a manhattan without the Rye.  A great Rum Drink nonetheless.

Maybe you'd have better luck if you didn't put Manhattan in the name.  To me that only means one thing----a very good bourbon whiskey (I know rye is the one that is supposed to be used).  This was pretty good.  It is a good rum drink.
