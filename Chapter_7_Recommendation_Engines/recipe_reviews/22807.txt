The cookies are very tasty.  The only problem is in the instructions, it says to add salt but does not tell you how much.  I guess and just added a pinch (1/4 of a teaspoon) and they came out great.  I also added chocolate chips to the second batch which was yummy.

I made a few adjustments. I used whole wheat flour instead of white and increased the baking powder to nearly 2 teaspoons instead of 1 1/2 teaspoons to compensate for the heavier flour. I also used 2 teaspoons of almond extract instead of 1 teaspoon and used 1 1/2 cups of coconut instead of 1/2 cup. I then used a small scoop to form the balls instead of rolling them with my hands. The cookies really spread out in the oven and came out larger than I expected. While they were still warm I rolled them up to look like Lady's Fingers. They look great and taste really good! I would definately make this recipe again and also use my alterations!

These are amazingly good cookies; my search for the definitive "almond" cookie is over!  I used 2 teaspoons of almond extract and added one cup each of coconut and toasted, finely chopped almonds.  My additions required a little more baking time, 12 minutes at 350.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe, loved it!!

I tweaked the recipe quite a bit.  Used applesauce instead of butter, used only a ½ cup sugar, used 2 tsp. vanilla extract, used almond flour and ¾ cup sweetened coconut flakes.  I tried different toppings, too.  Some with choco. chips, chopped walnuts, ¼ tsp. peanut butter in the middle, cinnamon and pumpkin pie spice.  I baked them for about 16 minutes, but checked on them every 2 min. after 10 minutes.  I wanted the bottoms that perfect golden brown, and they were!!  Can't wait to surprise hubby with yummy cookies!!   Good recipe, but no one needs that much sugar or butter, at all lol!!

I can't stop eating these cookies!  So delicious!  I gave 4 stars because I will make small changes to the next batch.  A little less butter and sugar and another egg instead of the water?  Also, they cook better at 375 degrees.  I like the idea of dipping half the cookie in chocolate then dipping that in chopped almonds.  YUM!

Will make this recipe again as it was very good. I followed the recipe except added 1/3 cup of coarsely grounded almonds as suggested by previous review. Yummy!

These were SO good.  I dipped one half in chocolate and sprinkled some of the leftover crushed almonds onto the warm chocolate so they set as the cooled.  Brought them to work that night and everyone raved.

great recipe but i tweaked just a bit...sorry..added  3/4 cup butter and a little bit less sugar....1 cup butter is just too overpowering...also added finely chopped almonds...and increased coconut to 1 cup..this resulted in 4 minutes more cooking time but they were awesome!!

Absolutely amazing almond cookies!  I added a little more almond extract because we really like the almond flavor, but made no other changes to the recipe.  They were crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside.  Everyone in the family loved them!  Thanks for sharing Laurie.

I rated these a five because two of my favorite flavors are combined here...coconut and almond.  The flavors are full but not overpowering and I have to agree with a couple of reviews...GREAT with coffee and I did add extra teaspoon of almond extract and another full cup of coconut.  I have also played around with the sizes.  I made a full tablespoon size which is in the oven right now.

Good cookies, although I made a few changes and will make more if/when I decide to try these again. Instead of 1c of butter, I did 1/2c butter and 1/2c apple sauce...I didn't want super greasy cookies. Instead of the 2tbsp of water, I did 2tbsp of milk, because...well, I just thought it was odd to add water to cookies. I added an extra teaspoon of almond extract, since I was really wanting the almond flavor to come out in these cookies...since the recipe didn't specify how much salt to add, I just put in 1/4tsp, but I think would up it to a 1/2tsp instead to make the almond flavoring more pronounced. In the future, I'd also reduce the amount of baking powder to 1/2tsp, since I prefer a chewier cookie. So...quite a few little changes here and there, but overall a good cookie that I would try again.

These cookies taste pretty good. I followed the recipe just like it was written but added a little coconut extract too. They took forever to bake, and ended up chewy.

The amount of salt needed isn't in the ingredients list but 1/4 tsp was perfect.  I also added 1/2 cup of sliced almonds and 1 tbsp of honey and baked for 8 1/2 minutes and the cookies were amazing.

These cookies were super easy to make and all the right flavors are there but I still like the recipe is missing something.  I upped the coconut to 3/4c. and used 1/4 tsp. salt.  Overall, an okay cookie.  I just can't quite put my finger on what it would take to jazz it up a bit.

Great Recipe!  I tweaked it just a bit as I like flavor and lots of it!  I double all my cookie recipes, so with that taken into consideration, I added 1 Tablespoon of the almond extract, 1 cup of crushed up pecans.  In addition I used a ice cream scooper to ball the dough and then rolled it in even more coconut!  This made the cookies slightly larger so they baked for about 10-15 minutes and the coconut on the outside was nicely toasted!  A new family favorite!

I was a little disappointed in this recipe.  I added less flour than required about 1/4 c and the cookies still were puffy and didn't spread as per picture.  I used vanilla as I didn't have any almond flavouring.  Added 1/2 c slivered almonds.  The cookies tasted great just dry and not chewy enough.

Yummy cookies and my hubby loves them! I used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup coconut oil (in its solid form). Used a little over 1 tsp almond extract and added chocolate chips to half of the batch. These are pretty sweet, sweeter than I normally make cookies, but they are still great. I used sweetened coconut flakes so that may be why. Also, I added a pinch of salt.

These cookies are great! I didn't know until I was well into the recipe that my almond extract was out of date so I replaced it with vanilla, added a handful of chopped pecans and they turned out perfect at 12 minutes.

These were very good, I baked a couple of minutes longer than recipe called for, they turned out crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside. I put in a little more coconut than called for and added 1/3 cup of pecan pieces. A tasty cookie.

I used 2 cups AP flour and 1/2 cups corn starch. Decreased sugar to 3/4 cup. Increased the almond flavor to 1 T. Will not brush with egg wash next time, as they still did not brown on top when I did.

I was not a big fan. Made these for my husband ; he said they were OK.  I only used 1/2 cup of sugar which was plenty considering the sweetened coconut and chocolate chips. My dough was sticky and more like biscuit dough. Cookies turned out puffy. I was curious about a lack of brown sugar which is what gives cookies their cookie texture.

These are super delicious! I added sliced almonds,less butter, replaced white sugar with brown sugar, and did some other little changes. I was disappointed that I couldn't taste the coconut, but maybe that was because I had a bad brand of flaked coconut. I might add coconut and almond milk next time.

I took these to work and everyone raved. I did double the coconut. So good with a cup of coffee.

Good, But - not enough almond flavor for my tastes. Just not very flavorful in general.

My batter turned out sticky. Couldn't roll them out into balls so I just got the teaspoon out and dropped them on the cookie sheet. Turned out well. I did increase the flaked coconut by a lot (I looove coconut) and I added more of the almond extract (I just love the smell). I scaled the recipe down just for a trial run. It would probably be better if I followed the recipe for the 36 servings. Will definitely try this again.

These were wonderful tasting cookies and incredibly quick and easy to make.  They turned out perfect and were gobbled up quickly by everyone.  The only thing I noticed was that the recipe doesnt tell you how much salt to add.  I added about 1/2 tsp or less, and they tasted great.  They might be even better with some toasted almonds or sliced almonds added as well.

These were very yummy.  My hubby gave himself a tummy ache eating a bunch of these cookies instead of his dinner.
