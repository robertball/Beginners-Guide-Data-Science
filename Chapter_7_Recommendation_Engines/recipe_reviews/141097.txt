We loved this!  Since bad weather made indoors.  Cooked at 425F for 20 minutes.  Delicious!  Many Thanks for this keeper!

This turned out really well.  It was too cold outside for the bbq so I roasted it in the oven at 450.  It took about 25 - 30 minutes to get an internal temperature of 150.

This was so good. I used teriyaki because I was out of soy and also added some crushed pepper to the mix. No additional salt was needed. I seared it on the stove top in a grill pan then moved it to the oven to finish cooking over a bed of some sliced onions. I would certainly make this again. The P.B was a nice addition.

Absolutely perfect!  My husband cannot get over how good this is - "this may be the best thing we have ever made..."  All of the flavors combine beautifully so that none of the ingredients are overwhelming or obvious.

Great flavor.  This turned out so moist.  I did some research, because I don't have an outdoor grill.  I ended up roasting the tenderloins at 375.  They took probably about 20 minutes, but I wasn't counting minutes.  I read as long as it hits 137 degrees it is safe, so I took it out at 140 and tented it for 10 minutes.  Not a dry bit on the pork!

this made a great tasting tenderloin - very tender and juicy.  but, like the other reviewer, i could not taste the peanut butter, curry, or ginger.  i marinated it overnight, and baked it in the oven rather than grilling.

This is a wonderful recipe!  We served it for Sunday lunch for church friends and they asked for seconds and even thirds!  Didn't change a thing, except for method of cooking.  I roasted it at 400 for about 38 minutes until the meat thermometer reached 150.  So moist, tender and flavorful!  Will make again and again!  Thanks, Diana!

Delicious!! I left all the marinade on, then browned/seared it first and then finished it in a 375 oven.  Was crispy outside,  tender, juicy inside and had such a great flavor.  Is now in my favorites folder!

Really good. I added cummin as well as the curry power but did not add the salt. Marinated 3 very thick pork chops for 5 hours then baked in the over. My Mom said the house smelled amazing and the chops tasted great. We'll use this one again.

This recipe was great!  Cooked in oven cause it was too cold outside.  Left the pork overnight like recipe said and WOW what a great flavor and the meat really had flavor and tender from the marinade.

I made this for New Year's Day for dinner with a bunch of friends.  This is a GREAT recipe!!    I used Teriyaki instead of straight Soy sauce, so my sauce was quite thick and really coated the pork well.  We left the sauce on the pork when we grilled it.  The sauce coating does get a little burnt because of the high sugar content, but for us that wasn't a bad thing-  everyone was fighting over the crispy crumbs.

Grilled up perfectly; tender and juicy.  Marinade smelled divine.  But family did not care for the flavor of the finished product.

I totally forgot the curry powder by accident but the marinate still gave it great flavor. I marinated a short but very thick pork loin overnight. Then I tried to grill it as directed. It burned immediately but started going better after I turned the heat to low. After 15 minutes it was still very raw inside so I sliced it "steaks" and grilled them like chicken breast. I was worried they wouldn't have enough flavor but they still turned out delicious, even with all the charring from the grill.   I think a lot of the problem was the size of my pork loin, but I would not recommend grilling any meat on high.

This is a great marinade!  We will definitely be making this again.  I didn't add the salt and I'm glad I didn't...it was salty enough with just the soy sauce.

My family and company loved this recipe.  I marinated it for seven hours,rather than over night,  but the flavor was still great.  I sliced the tenderloin into one inch pieces and browned them in a pan.  I also added a little white wine and mushrooms.

My husband sliced the pork into long 1/4" narrow slices while the pork was partially frozen.  We marinated a few hours, skewered and quickly grilled.  Too yummy for words.  Thanks for the marinade recipe!

This was pretty good, but not strong flavor.  I marinated it overnight too.  It was still good but I would make sure that the internal temp reaches 145 degrees.

This was easy and delicious. Everyone wants it again. I marinated over night and it came out great. Leftover cold slices made yummy sandwiches.

This was pretty good, but as other reviewers have stated, it doesn't have much of a peanut butter taste, I had hoped for a little more.  I did substitute ground ginger for fresh, as that's what I had on hand, and it seemed to work fine.  The flavors worked well, I may try adding more peanut butter next time.  I also did not pat off the extra marinade as I like the flavor to carmelize onto the pork.  Also, Icaution, do not cook on high on the grill, I grill my pork tenderlions on medium.

it was just ok.  I felt the  peanut butter was a little too overwhelming.  The only thing I can think of is that I didn't really wipe the marinade off before I cooked it so maybe that is why.  Although I don't think I would try it again

It was too cold to use my grill when I made this dish, so I roasted the marinated pork in my oven at 425 for 30 minutes.  It was so delicious and tender.  I also doubled the marinade and let the tenderloins sit overnight which made these really juicy and flavorful.

My DH and DD both loved this.  I thought it had a rather strong ginger taste, but it was still good.  I used pork chops instead of the tenderlion, and omitted the curry (for personal reasons).  When I make this again, I think I will increase the peanut butter a little, but won't mess with the rest of the ingredients due to the rave reviews.  Thanks for sharing!

This is incredibly easy with ingredients I always have on hand.  The meat is very tender and juicy.  I marinated mine from about 9 am to 6 pm and it was great.

I have made this twice for company and it is absolutely DELISH!  I marinated two tenderloins for 24 hours and roasted them in the oven at 425 for about 30 minutes.  Amazing flavor and extremely tender.  A real hit!

Wow- this was so easy and turned out so good!  I marinated over night and my husband requested this be a regular meal.  Even my SUPER picky kids liked it.  I did not have fresh ginger so I used 1 tsp. ground ginger and it worked great.  Next time I might double the marinade and keep half out to boil down for a rice sauce.  This is definitely a keeper recipe!

I have made this recipe a dozen times. When I say it's "Pork Tenderloin" for dinner, my 4 young kids get very excited. (Almost as excited as if we are having beef tenderloin steaks!) 
I have made this recipe for guests, as a meal to take to others... everybody loves it. No changes. Perfect with mashed potatoes or rice pilaf, and some veggies on the side.
Caution: when you buy your pork, make sure you are getting plain, unseasoned pork. You don't want that MSG loaded pre-seasoned stuff!

I did this a little differently. My pork was already cut into thin pork loin chops. I accidentally dumped a T. of curry in the marinade, but that was okay, because we like curry. My Husband also came home hungry and wanted to eat, so they only marinated for a couple hours. I broiled them on a broiler pan, flipping every 3 minutes, for 12 minutes. I didn't add extra time for the oven to reheat. It turned out great, my Husband is a fan. Super moist, slightly crispy at edges. I'm going to put the leftovers in an Asian salad! Thanks!

Excellent marinade! Excellent tenderloin.  Really easy to put together the night before and throw on the grill minutes before dinner is ready.  Adding to regular rotation. We eat a lot of tenderloin so appreciate this new tasty addition to my collection.

Delicious! After tasting marinade I increased the ginger and curry (personal preference only); I marinaded 8 hours before grilling first on indirect heat about 15 minutes before finishing on direct heat. Served with packaged Asian chopped salad and coconut curry quinoa from another site. I plan to use the leftover pork in a stirfry. Yumm!

I've used this marinade so many times and it's always delicious. I usually use it for pork chops instead of tenderloin and once I even coated the marinated chops in panko bread crumbs and pan fried them. Very good marinade recipe!

This dish was fantastic! I altered it just a tad. I cranked the Weber to high and added apple wood to the smoke box. (just a small handfull, I didn't want too much). Once the chips were smoking, I turned everything down to medium and put the meat on. I cooked it for about 20 minutes, internal temp to 140. For my sides, I made jasmine rice with cherries and slivered almonds. (a little soy sauce on the side added a nice salt/sweet combo). As well, I aserved a freshly cooked artichoke with browned butter for dipping. The next time, I will double up on the curry marinade and see how it works as a sauce to pour over the meat before serving.

I would suggest that the salt be left off of this receipe!!!!  My pork was grilled perfectly, but it tasted like a salt bomb exploded on it!  Other than that, the rest of the ingredients were fine.

I bought a huge hunk of tenderloin at Walmart for under $5.00 and used it for this recipe, which was amazing (paired with Herbed Dumplings from this website and Bavarian Sauerkraut and an Asian gravy recipe). I grilled it, using a temperature that was too hot and charred the meat quickly. Next time, I'll use a lower temperature when it is necessary to grill meat for so long (I should have known, I'm not a beginner). After twenty minutes, it was still not done inside, so I sliced it and finished the individual portions off in the microwave. Despite my errors, the marinade was fantastic and I will use this recipe again. Next time, I may put it in the oven after initial browning on the grill.

Completely yummy!  I followed the recipe exactly, except plans changed unexpectedly, and the meat ended up marinating for 3 days before we had a chance to cook it.  Needless to say, it was "melt in your mouth" tender!  Great ginger flavor (I used fresh ginger).  Next time tenderloins go on sale, I'm making a couple and throwing them in the freezer!

Like others, I didn't taste any of the peanut butter in this and I had even doubled the amount and used 2 tbsps of pb.  Bland dish, really needs more spices to make this anything more than a just "eh" meal.  Won't bother making this again as the "Thai Pork Satay" dish on this site is much more flavorful and better in incorporating peanut butter and pork.

This was okay.  It was too salty for my taste & I didn't even add the extra salt.  Next time I will use low sodium soy sauce.  Also, I was hoping this would be more peanuty than it was.  It was very juicy & my kids loved it, but the recipe is missing something.

Wow. This marinade is insanely good. I used chunky PB and 1/8 tsp ground ginger in lieu of the creamy PB and fresh ginger asked for in the recipe, but only because it's what I had on hand. Oven roasted the pork at 425 for about half an hour. Yum!

Its so easy to give this recipe 5 stars. You just cant go wrong with pork tenderloin. Although the meat was very tender, all i could taste is the soy sauce. Dont get me wrong..it was good but i didnt taste the ginger or the peanut butter so for that reason i will give it 4 stars.

My family loved this one so much there were no leftovers.  I left out the salt (with all the soy it isn't necessary.)  I also added a touch of cilantro to one of the loins.  Both were great.

loved the flavor, next time I may thin it out a bit w/stock or vinegar to make it easier to coat.
