I just made this as an appetizer to dinner and my husband and I just loved it.  We had just had a similar appetizer at a party and the hostess gave me the recipe but this one was more flavorful.  A tip I received was toast one side of the baguette slice and then spread the topping on the reverse side and broil.  A delightful appetizer.  My husband insisted I send my thanks!

I loved this recepe and so did eveyone at the party. Everyone asked for the recipe. I added a bunch parmesean and mozarrella cheese to the mix to make a little more gooey. It was great! Just don't walk away from the oven, they toast up pretty fast.

A great recipe.  I prepared the topping 24 hours before company arrived and all I had to do is pop them in the oven.  Everyone raved about this tangy appetitizer.  The recipe went home with three of our guests.

Huge Hit at the party!  I made them just before people started to arrive and the smell was incredible
and the taste was better.  I used an Asiago/Parmesan mix which was great and you can mix
the mayo and seasoning and garlic a day or two before you serve too!

This is a great recipe! I made it yesterday for a going away barbeque for my aunt, everyone loved it! I used a small loaf of fresh Italian bread and cut the slices into finger food sized pieces after cooking them. I also lightly pre-toasted the slices, which I think is a must. Next time I might try serving this with a marinara dipping sauce! Thanks Alison!

WOW!  These packed a lot of flavor per square bite.  We loved them with a full-flavored red wine.

I must have done something wrong.  These came out not as great as I had expected.  The mayo completely overpowered the bread and I didn't taste any of the asiago cheese.  I am not a big mayo fan, but my husband agreed with me...too much mayo.  I will try this again to see if this was my blunder or if this just didn't suit our tastes...all the same.  Thanks for posting.

Every now and then, usually on a Sunday evening, we have what our kids call a "fun dinner". A fun dinner consists of various appetizers. Last evening we had one of those dinners and this recipe was part of the the menu. I'm pleased to say that these little puffs were a huge hit! Thanks!

it was ABSOLUTELY delicious. I had bought some Asiago as a replacement for Parmesan in a Caesar Salad I had just made (only because it was cheaper than the Parmesan) and needed to use up the rest of it for something. I halved the herbs because i was scared of getting too strong of a flavor, and it was still great. Also put a little more of the garlic in, and a bit more mayo to make it more spreadable. They were addictive!!!

These were quite good.  It's chilly here in VA and I wanted something warm to go with the Asain Salad I made (also found on this site).  My poor hubby had to run to 3 different stores before he could find a baguette. (Everytime it starts to snow...milk, bread and water are the first to go at the grocery store). I didnt' add the additional salt since the Asiago is salty already and next time I might reduce the amount of oregano to 1/2 tsp. since it stood out the most.  Even though I don't drink alcohol, I'm sure these would be good with red wine or beer.  Thanks for the recipe...and Happy Super Bowl Sunday everyone!!

I thought these were fabulous!  I had made the cheese mixture up ahead of time and then didn't get to use it till the next day.  I think the day of sitting in the fridge really let all the flavors come together.  Three minutes under the broiler is definitely all the time that it takes to get these nice and toasty.

I can see how this COULD be great, but as is the thyme is overpowering.  I will try this again using maybe a third of the thyme.

I’m sorry to say that this was just “ok” for us, which surprised me, because we like all the ingredients.  I made just a small amount of this for two slices of ciabatta bread.  I toasted my bread on both sides first, then spread them with the asiago mixture.  If you toast your bread first as I did, make sure to spread the mixture all the way to the edges.  This will help keep the edges from burning when you put it back under the broiler.

Just made these last night. We served it with my husbands famous chicken wings and everyone loved it. Especially the guys. They kept saying it was the best bread they have ever had. So easy to make. Followed the recipe except used Parmesan cheese as it was what I had on hand. Great recipe for entertaining.

These were a huge with with my family at Easter!  I followed the recipe with a few changes.  I used Italian bread sliced in half.  I also broiled the bread first to toast it, then I spread the cheese mixture on and broiled until they were brown and bubbly.  Def will make again!!

Didn't really care for this, it just tasted like mayonnaise. If I make it again I will use butter instead of mayonnaise.

I LOVE Asiago, so I was looking forward to this.  Did not disappoint, but I agree with everyone else that you have to double the recipe.

Well I thought this recipe tasted fantastic!  I made the spread the night before to save some time.  I also cut the loaf of bread the night before, and wrapped that well.  When it was time for appetizers, I spread the mixture on the bread, broiled, and YUM!  All the guests raved!

Made the recipe to the T except served on slices of Bavarian Rye bread.  Yummy melty appetizer before a pasta dinner.  The Asiago was not too strong but beware the mayo taste comes out when they cool down, so eat them Hot!  Will make again, thanks!
--2nd time around with cream cheese..mmmmmm..

Most people will find the cheese way too strong. If you use half asiago and half mozz or white cheddar it will be much better.

Great side to our soup! I used less thyme (1/4 tsp) and half the parsley. Also, I didn't have a full cup of asiago cheese (1/2c)so I used some parmesan to make 3/4 cup total cheese...which was perfect. Thanks Alison - these were devoured!

These are tasty little guys!  I whipped these up last night and enjoyed them with a glass of wine.  Can I tell you a secret?  I didn't have the baguette bread in the house, so I used hot dog buns!  It worked out fine (although I'm sure they're much more delicious on the specified bread).  Next time I'll add more than 1/3 c. mayo and cut back on the thyme as I found the teaspoon to be a bit overpowering.  Otherwise, a terrific and quick appetizer.

yummy! so good! and easy too! i used shredded asiago & i left the salt out as asiago has a salty flavor to it already, and it was still mouthwatering. perfect for an evening of wine & bread & cheese.

Excellent without any changes to the recipe though I did have to double the recipe for that long baguette! So quick and easy to throw together. Everyone raved about them!

Absolutely fabulous, and so easy to put together in a pinch for a last minute get together.  But WATCH that broiler!  It takes good timing to get them perfectly browned and bubbly!

I'm going to try the cheese spread since I'm not a mayo lover. Does anyone think it would be good with just butter and the other ingredients? Love to try these but mayo had it's place and for me, it wouldn't be here.

These were delicious and a hit with my company.  I toasted one side of the bread, flipped it, added the topping, and broiled until bubbly.  Will definitely make again

We love Asiago cheese. These were great with our Lobster salad entree! I cut the herbs in half and left out the salt. As another reviewer suggested, I toasted one side of the baguette, then spread the other side with the filling. YUMMY!

These are amazing!  I had purchased some asiago cheese for another purpose and had a lot left over so I found this recipe on this site and wow were they good.  Everyone wanted to know How they were made and wanted the recipe.  Thanks for a totally different and tasty recipe.

These are the best!  I made these for Christmas Eve. Got lots of compliments and requests for the recipe.  Then made for two other holiday parties and the same thing happened.  If you cut the bread a little thinner you can get more appetizers out of a baguette. The cheese puffs up nicely.  Try half Asiago and half Parmesan.  Once I used just garlic powder instead of the pressed and was just as good. Use 2-3 teas. Italian Seasoning instead of oregano, etc.   Use a little more mayo to make the cheese spread go farther. I used "light" mayo and they came out fine. Also nice and neat to take to a party.  Just cut the bread in advance and put cheese on when before broiling.  That way you don't have the cut bread sliding all over the place. Really watch them in the oven as they broil up fast.  Delicious!  Thanks for the recipe.  Will make many times again.

Really, really good. I like this recipe as an alternative to my tried and true garlic bread. In terms of volume, I ended up with exactly enough spread. If you wish to spread more bread with the mixture, you will definitely need to increase the mixture, because you will probably not have any extra. The herbs are strong, which we love, but if you like your herbs to be a little more subtle, obviously scale back appropriately. We used freshly grated Asiago, which is definitely worth the time and effort.

This bread is AMAZING!!! My husband couldn't believe it was made with Mayo. I tried with mozzerella because I didn't have asiago and it tasted great. Cant wait to try with the asiago though!

One huge problem is this recipe does not serve 12.  It flew off the serving plate and we were five adults.  I am lucky to have even tasted it.  I prepared the mix and refrigerated until ready to use. Worked out perfectly.

Easy to make and great tasting.  You can use this spread on any bread.  There was a lot of mix left so I just refridgerated it and will use it again for lunch.  Keep an eye on them because they cook fast!

These were pretty good.  I took the advice of some other reviewers and toasted the underside of the bread before putting the spread on the opposite side, and halved the herbs.  The oregano stood out a little bit more than I would've liked even though I didn't add all of it.  But it was still good.  I've had something similar to this before only instead of asiago it had parmesan cheese and it was spread on a pizza crust with some grilled onions and cut into small pieces for an appetizer.  All in all, it was quick, tasty and easy.

This was fantastic.  It was a huge hit, even with a skeptical picky eater.  I had to add a touch more mayo because it wasn't holding together, and I also threw in a tiny bit of cream cheese that I had left over from another recipe.  The asiago flavor was amazing, and the herbs were a great compliment.  These will be coming out for Thanksgiving appetizers.

This was a hit at a wine tasting party.  I agree with some of the reviews that this recipe does not make 12 servings.  I tripled the recipe and had some cheese spread left over for a large french baguette.

I also toasted one side, flipped, added the topping, and then toasted the other.  I served these with a simple tomato bruschetta topping.

Great bread appetizer!  Very tasty!  The ingredients including garlic, oregano, thyme and parsley, really add a lovely taste to the bread.  This is a great way to kick-start a meal witnessed by the fact that it is my third time making this tasty appetizer.

These were just okay for me... I overcooked the first batch, so I figured the second batch would be great... They were good, but not worth 5 stars.

This is exactly what I was looking for.  Greystone Culinary Institute of America catered my cousin's wedding & had served these.  I've been looking for the recipe ever since.  All they said was Asiago Cheese, garlic & mayo.  I knew there was more to it than that.  Lo & Behold I found this.  Since I didn't have the dried spices separately, I substituted with Italian Seasoning & 1/2 tsp, fresh parsley (minced).  I doubled the recipe and still didn't have enough for 7, myself & 6 children.  Hubby never had a chance...LOL.

Very, very good.  I didn't have baguette bread so I used a normal size loaf of Asiago.  The taste was great but the bread pieces were too big and too rich.  It ended up a little oily/soggy with all of the mayonaise.  I would also recommend spreading a thin layer on as this is all you need.  One more thing, Don't add salt..the salt within the cheese is just enough.

These were good, but they turned out a bit salty.  I'd skip the salt next time, and maybe add some chopped spinach to the mixture!

easy...made ahead and put it together at a party.
The mixture raw tasted too salty and too mayo based, final product perfect. I generally dislike coming up with an appetizer will definitely to it again. No one asked for the recipe :(

I finally made these tasty little things!!  LOVE LOVE LOVE.  Hate myself for waiting so long!!  Straight off the grill they were a bit salty.  (To be honest they were the first thing I ate that day which may have altered my tastes.)  But a bite of one of these paired with a bite of steak was heaven.  Loved these so much.  Only change was to just throw on a bit of leftover Parmesan.

Awesome! Made two modifications with what I had on hand. Used Parmesan cheese instead of asiogo and cream cheese in place of the mayonnaise. I also added some mozzarella to the mix. Toasted the bread with some butter and then flipped and put the cheese and herb mix on top. I warmed up the cheese mixture just a few seconds to make it easier to spread. These turned out awesome!

Made this as an appetizer for dinner last night. It was excellent. I have made a similar recipe with Manchego cheese. This app was so good, hubby ate so much he couldn't finish his dinner. Our guests loved them too. I made the topping early in the day. Toasted the baguettes before guests arrived and popped under broiler as they arrived. definitely a keeper.

SO Good and so easy! My friend also recommended substituting some of the mayo for ranch (just maybe a fifth) which tasted good. If you don't feel like spending a lot of money, you can use parmesan or mozzarella. Made as is, it's still really good though. Thanks! (I wonder what it would taste like with a few bread crumbs...)

These were so good. I was sad when I realized I forgot the Asiago cheese at the store, and was not loading the kids back in the car to get it. So, I used kraft grated parm, a little bit of mozz, and added some red pepper flakes to the mix. I toasted one side of the bread first as others suggested then spread the mix on the other side and broiled them. Thanks for the recipe!!

I served this at a Memorial Day picnic and they were gone in a flash.  I too toasted the undersides of the bread.  Everyone raved about this and  it's so easy.

These did not turn out at all how I had hoped. It may be the fault of my baguette was so hard I couldn't even slice it without the bread breaking all over. I don't know if that is how all baguettes are, but it didn't work for this recipe! For the couple of slices that didn't break I didn't find the flavor to be all that good. Maybe I'll try it again with different bread.

Delicious! My only deviation from the recipe was to use full-size slices of a Parmesan-Oregano bread, and then cut the broiled slices into triangels. Everyone loved it. Thanks!

This was very tasty and a big hit with my card group.  I will make this again.  An added bonus is that this is very easy to make.  It has a strong, dominating taste so be sure to use fruit/dip or something sweet served with it.
