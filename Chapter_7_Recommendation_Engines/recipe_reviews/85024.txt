This recipe was really good. Only complaint would be that there isn't a lot of sauce if you want to serve with pasta. I doubled the marsala and still seemed a bit short on sauce- it really cooks down. The sauce is very rich though so not much is needed in the end. A very tasty chicken marsala recipe though.

My husband said wow, and I also really liked this recipe, but didn't LOVE it as I have some other recipes on this site.  I will make again and I think it is worth trying.  I used homemade chicken stock and I think that really added to the dish.  Thanks for sharing.

Very easy to prepare.  I used fresh basil, replace Marsala for rice wine and I used rye flour.  Even all this changes it works well :)

I doubled the amount specified for the sauce based on other reviewers' remarks and thought it was too much.  The dish was OK, but seemed to be missing something.  Maybe next time I'll add some minced garlic to the olive oil before sauteeing the chicken.

This was good.  I probably won't rush to make it again, but the whole family enjoyed it.  I added 3/4 C of Marsala wine and 3/4 C of chicken broth to add to the sauce and I'm glad I did.  I served it over noodles with a salad.

not bad but nothing special.  felt it needed cornstarch to thicken up the sauce a bit.

Good Stuff!! I was craving something with chicken, wine, mushrooms and garlic, and this was exactly what I was looking for! I added some minced garlic to the mushrooms, and I used a Riesling since I didn't have any Marsala. My husband AND my 4 year old declared this recipe wonderful! Thank you!

My husband is a chicken marsala nut and he loved this! I doubled the sauce b/c we like to eat it over pasta, but it was super easy to make. To speed up the process I cut the chicken up and it was in bite size chunks instead of entire breasts being sauteed, but it was very very yummy!

Great marsala recipe!  I doubled the sauce because I like to serve it over noodles, and I added minced onion and garlic about 2 minutes before the mushrooms.  I thought it could have been a little thicker, so next time I will stream in a cornstarch and water mixture at the end until it's the perfect consistency.

I just used white wine (did not know what Marsala wine was) and it turned out great.  We really enjoyed it.  My family is just so happy that I found this site.
Thank you, Thank you, Thank you
