Very nice...great hit at office party.  Added a little extra peppermint extract first time...added too much the second.  Suggest 1/4 teaspoon.  Also, going to freeze cherries in lemon-lime soda next time.  They sit on the bottom and no one knows they are there.

I made this recipe for a baby shower and children's birthday party.  It was well received at both.  Try to make sure that each guest gets at least one cherry in his/her cup.  This is a special, unexpected treat for everyone!

I've made this for our annual Christmas Party the last few years and for our community party.  I'm often asked If I would share   the recipe. I always have extra copies of the recipe ready for those that ask.
