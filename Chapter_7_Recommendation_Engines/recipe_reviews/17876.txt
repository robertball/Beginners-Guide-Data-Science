I make this same soup but don't cover the potatoes and add a sliced onion, cook them 30 min or so without a cover (most of the water will evaporate) Mash the mixture up slightly with a potato masher. Then I scald 1 qt. skim milk in the microwave and add that.  Add just a shake of Tabasco sauce, salt & pepper, and you have a low-fat, soul warming soup.  For leftover next day, I sometimes add 1 can baby clams and heat.  My husband loves this. (He adds a pat of butter to his bowl.) It's the first soup I make every fall.

I was looking to see if they had this recipe  as it is basically the way I have been making it for years. This is a great basic recipe and you cannot beat real boiled potatos for soup.(The flakes don't hold a candle). I add onions and bacon sauteed in butter but if you want to avoid the heart attack :-) you can skip it and just use different seasonings to spice it up. Thanks for posting!! Sometimes simple is better!

This soup is so tasty. I made the following changes: I used chicken broth to cover potatoes instead of water, I added a chopped sweet onion, and I only used one can of evaporated milk. I also topped the soup with crumbled bacon. Yum.

This soup is surprisingly delicious for so few ingredients. It thickens up considerably, so don't be tempted to add more potato. I used my immersion blender to make it really smooth. Served with bowls of grated cheese, crumbled bacon, and chopped green onion so we could fancy up our own to our taste. Thanks for the great recipe!

All 5 of us gave this a thumbs up, including a very picky 7 yr old! I used fat free evap milk, and it was fine. For fun, I added a "toppings buffet" that included low sodium crumbled bacon, low fat shredded cheddar, & chopped green onions. I used my immersion blender as suggested, and it worked like a charm! My husband suggested next time keeping some chunks of potatoes in the soup, but I thought it was PERFECT!!! Thanks for a quick and easy meal :)

Great versatile recipe.  I left out the butter to cut calories and added some veggie bouillon and I'm happy to say it was potato-y and delicious. Also a very good recipe to use up other leftovers--broccoli, corn, etc.

This was great. It made me think of my Mother's oyster stew recipe. Next time I think I will add oysters with the potatoes. My whole family loved it.

I was so happy to find this basic recipe. I added about 1/3 cup of cornstarch (whisked with a fork in water before pouring in) to thicken it up. Spiced it up with a few spices, subbed the milk with soymilk, but this was a great place to start. Thanks!

This is the same recipe my mother made for me as a little boy when I was sick. My favorite soup. So easy to make, it just takes time. When I was a boy I thought it took hours before she said it was ready. A word of advice from an old man who misses his mothers good home style cooking. Sit down with your mother while you still can and write down her recipes that she has stored in her brain from years of cooking them. You will enjoy it and she will enjoy remembering the good times and later you will be glad you did.

Awesome recipe! Simple and easy! I did do as some of the other reviews suggested and cook the potatoes in chicken broth instead of water. I also added a tablespoon of chopped garlic. My husband loved it.

Fantastic! I cooked the potatoes in water, then added the Evaporated Milk. I also added some dried onions and some vegetable broth in powder (Loose, from the Co-Op). That's it.  I made it again next day and I added some Whip milk from carton and I added some D Milk. My family had two servings.

Very nice basic recipe!  Loved it.  I added just a little bit of dried parsley to give it a little color.

This is the same recipe my parents used to make potato soup.  I grew up eating it this way and I think it is the best.  Makes me miss my parents when I have potato soup this way.

I made this for my boyfriend when he was really sick and couldn't get down much food. He was excited to have something real (not canned broth), and ate it for four days. The simple flavor was good for him, and I look forward to spicing it up sometime now that he's better. :-)

I make this often for my family and they love it Problem is a few things. 1. I have to add double the potatoes and 1 1/2 evaporated milk instead to even have enough for 4 people. 2 The amount  of cheese and bacon I have to put in to even begin to have flavor come out is unreal. Its as the title says plain

This is the comfort soup I make when I'm really sick only I use chicken broth for the milk. If I can stomach it, I add a sliced onion. It's the soup my nana made for me when I was small. Thank you for sharing.

Just made this for my ill husband who cannot handle too many flavors at the moment.  After the potatoes were soft enough I transferred the mixture to my blender and it turned out very creamy.  I then moved it back to the  pot and substituted plain almond milk (we don't drink dairy milk as much) for the evaporated milk and just eyeballed it when adding.  Used a bit of garlic powder too.  Good basic recipe and exactly what we needed.

I'm giving this five stars because if you're ill; this type of soup really helps because it's so neutral. I didn't add any butter to just keep it gentle for the stomach. I'm sure instant potatoes could be used in a pinch.

My family and I love this potato soup. Very basic. Nothing gourmet about it, but we love making it this way then doctoring to our individual likes. We add anywhere from garlic salt, bacon bits, shredded cheddar cheese, green onions, etc....Cracker barrell also has a potato soap seasoning that we like sprinkling on it.

Very good and easy to make. I added some crushed chicken boullion cubes and a splash of white wine. Next time I'll probably use chicken stock to subsitute for the water like another user suggested. Thanks for the recipe!

Will make again...  added 1 large  sweet onion!   Tasted just like my grandmothers when I was a kid.   I have been looking for a potato soup that would compare to hers and this is it!!   This soup is not super thick which is what I wanted!!  Loved it!

Best potato soup ever!  We do like chunks of potato's in ours so I mash a little and left chunks of potato's too.  I only had 1 can of evaporated milk so I also used 2% milk.  Also added a few dried chives.  Even better the 2nd day.

I doubled the potatoes (one 5 lb bag). For my family I added onion flakes and garlic powder. I used vegetable stock to boil the potatoes on a Lenten Friday, otherwise I would use chicken stock. I also added salt and white pepper.  Excellent base recipe to make the way you want!

This really should be called "simple" instead of "plain." I used 4 cups homemade vegetable broth instead of water, two potatoes, and only one can of evaporated milk. Will still get two meals from it. It goes together fast, with convenient "keep on hand" ingredients. Infinitely useful and easy to modify... we added some garlic powder, and served with grated cheese, chives, and cornbread on the side. Cozy.

This is just as the title indicates, PLAIN potato soup.  There are so many other basic potato soups that have so much more flavor.

i loved this recipe very easy to follow very tasty. I added some cooked shrimp and some corn. it went very well with this simple flavor. this recipe is a excellent reminder that some times the less seasonings you add the better!
