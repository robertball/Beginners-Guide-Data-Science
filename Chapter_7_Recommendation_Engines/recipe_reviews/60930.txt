I originally made these for a chocoholic friend of mine and they were quite a hit.  I couldn't get the dark chocolate kisses, so the traditional milk chocolate kisses worked very well.  My hints would be to be sure to chill the dough enough so that when you roll out the balls, the dough doesn't stick to your hands much.  I usually let it go overnight. Don't substitute for the vegetable oil - I noticed a difference.  Leave your eggs out to come to room temperature or place in a hot bowl of water a few minutes before using to take the chill off.  Do not overbake.  Take out when pressing the back of a spoon on the cookie leaves a slight indent (yes, I know the recipe says differently).  And finally, put the kisses on immediately out of the oven and then don't touch - the kisses melt and can easily be crushed.  Refrigerate before transport.  I have stored this dough up to 5 days in the fridge before baking.  Enjoy!

very pretty looking cookies that taste great too! I had to add more flour to the dough, it was still super sticky so i put in the freezer for about an hour. I used a scoop to cut down on handling the dough and that worked great! They taste like chewy brownies. Everyone loved them. A double recipe made about 80 cookies for me and I only baked them 9-10 minutes. They do not look done but will firm up after a few minutes. Will make again!! Oh and I used reg choc not dark, personal preference. Thanks Hersheys!

These cookies get 5 stars just on appearance alone!  My kids loved them.  I didn't have the dark choc kisses or the dutch cocoa powder (neither item avail. in my town) so I subbed milk choc kisses and regular cocoa powder and they turned out good.  Being the dark chocolate lover that I am - I'm sure they would be REALLY GOOD w/ those ingredients!

I made a reduced fat version of this recipe by reducing the oil to 1/3 cup, using one whole egg and 2 egg whites and decreasing the flour to 1-2/3 cup.  I followed the recipe as written and they were great!

I don't know, they weren't as good as I expected. They tasted like store-bought brownie mix & were a little too sweet. Not the rich chocolate flavor I was expecting. Maybe I didn't chill long enough and had to roll in too much powdered sugar? They weren't bad, my husband & kids loved them. Just not what I was expecting.

I was too impatient to let them chill in the fridge, so I stuck them in the freezer for a little less than an hour, and they were very easy to work with (still sticky though).  I only baked them for about 8 minutes and they have a nice fudgey center.    They remind me of brownies and I love the way they look.

This was a great recipe to do with my son who is 4.  He loved putting the kisses on.  We made our batch exactly as the recipe indicates, (luckily it was a holiday season and we had no trouble finding the dark choc kisses.)  Do not overbake - I shaved off 2 minutes from the time and they were perfect.

These are great, I also have rolled them in regular granulated sugar and they remind me of old-fashioned cookies me grandmother used to make. They also don't have milk which is great for my kids who are allergic.

These are easy and delicious!  I didn't want to wait 6 hours for the dough to chill, so I put it in in the freezer for 1 1/2 hours (stirring half way through).  They turned out great.  I baked the first set for 10 minutes - cookies were perfectly done.  I liked them better baked only 8 minutes - they were chewy in the middle.  Also, remove cookies from cookie sheet immediately to prevent bottoms becoming too hard.  Kids loved these too, especially putting the kisses on top.

This is an amazing cookie recipe! It took top honors over our family's perrenial favorite (which is usually choc chip cookies). This cookie is so EASY to make, as well as attractive. I made them without the choc kiss, and my family still raved about them!

I don't know where I went wrong. I went over the recipe a couple of times but my cookies came out flat. The dough was sticky as promised but not impossible to work with. I'll definately try this one again but take the advice of another review and add a little more flour.
