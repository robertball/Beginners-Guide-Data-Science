I used fat free half-n-half and I increased the garlic powder to a full teaspoon. These mashed potatoes were fluffy and delicious--they remind me of the potatoes Grandma used to make.

Used this recipe for Christmas dinner... absolutely awesome. Light and fluffy, and really good when reheated too. You may want to add more salt/pepper/other spices if you like more flavor, but these were great as is!

Love this recipe!  My guests for St. Patrick's Day loved this as well!  I only made one change to the original recipe- I substituted minced garlic for the garlic powder.  This potatoes were easy and so creamy!  I've tried other mashed potato recipes in the past that guests liked, but this takes the cake!  This recipe will be the only one I use from now on!

Add parsley for the green and don't be afraid to add more butter or salt if needed depending on the potato you use. They are fantastic when seasoned right.
