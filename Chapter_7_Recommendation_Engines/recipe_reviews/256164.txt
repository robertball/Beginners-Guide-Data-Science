I realize how difficult it is to rate this recipe when I made changes to it.  I used fresh spinach 1lb fresh is equal to 10oz frozen.  My husband who is a restaurant palak paneer lover said it was good and did go back for seconds.  I would make it again but try the recipe exactly as written.  It was very easy to make.  I also didn't fry the paneer.  I just threw it in with the palak.

I have always LOVED palak paneer, but never took the time to make it at home. This recipe is SO easy!! I sautéed baby Bella’s and red onions first, then added the spices and garlic/ginger. Then I added chopped Roma tomatoes and the thawed spinach. Once simmered, threw it in the food processor, blended it up and threw it back in the wok with cubed queso blanco. It tasted EXACTLY like Indian cottage cheese. Much easier to find at the grocery store too! Just don’t buy a flaky queso blanco. 5 stars of deliciousness!!

My family LOVED this dish, thank you, Melanie! We used cubed tofu rather than cheese and served it along with Jasmine rice. The 9 yo and 12 yo cleaned their plates ("this is spinach?") and asked for more. Next time I'll double the batch and add some feta cheese for the two that eat dairy.

Surprisingly this tasted just like a dish from an Indian restaurant. We LOVED it.  I couldn't believe it came from my kitchen! My only change was we didn't have the paneer cheese so I used feta cheese and added it at the very end. Tasted great getting the salty bites of feta with the spices. Next time we will try the paneer (if we can find it). I live on an island so it's hard to find everything at once.

Was very tasty.  I omitted the red pepper flakes and added a few drops of lemon juice. I didn't have curry powder either.

This recipe is delicious, tastes just like the dish I was used to at my favorite Indian restaurant on the west coast, which I can no longer enjoy since I now live in the Midwest in a town with no Indian restaurants!  

The recipe is simple to follow, uses ingredients I almost always have on-hand, and it's so convenient using frozen spinach.  

I did have to substitute canned tomatoes for fresh, as I didn't have any when I wanted to make this.  I used the exact same measurement, just used the diced canned.

Like others, I had to switch out the cheese.  I used queso fresco cut into cubes.  It does melt some in the pan, but not much, and it will harden again when not on direct heat.  The taste is very similar to real paneer.  I highly recommend this substitution if you need it.  

I served with basmati rice, naan bread, and I make my own version of tzatziki sauce, which is "once-around-the-kitchen" as I call it.  Typically plain Greek yogurt, cucumber, mint, onion, garlic, salt, pepper, and stevia sweetener.  Sometimes other herbs like dill or thyme,  or a vinegar (Asian rice wine, red wine, apple cider) depending on my mood and what I have.  I just keep tasting until it has the right balance of tang, savory, sweet.

This was very good. I added about 1/2 cup of cream while blending it so it would not be as spicy. My Indian food loving family devoured it.

Made this last night and the color and consistency is beautiful. I found the ginger flavor to be overwhelming however. I grated fresh ginger root and used two tablespoons as instructed (I followed the recipe exactly). I also used a 1 lb package of paneer. In the future I will halve the amount of ginger used and see if that helps.

An easy crowd pleaser.
I've made this numerous times, and it is always a success.   Double all seasonings (besides salt).  This recipe scales up for larger crowds well, and can be prepared in advance and reheated without problems.   We even freeze it!

Easy recipe but we found the dish to be rather blah. Doubled the spices and it was good but not great.

I cut everything in half because I only had one package of spinach.  I didn't have paneer so I tried using queso fresco but it apparently has a lower melting point than true paneer, so my "cubes" ended up looking like blobs (no problem other than aesthetics).  I also added a can of chickpeas because I wasn't sure if the imitation paneer was going to make the cut as the protein contributor.  I used a red onion because I love red onions.  I used half a can of diced tomatoes because I didn't have fresh ones.
My main surprise was how spicy it was considering the only heat added was the pepper flakes.  Normally I throw in a diced jalapeno or some chili powder for my Indian dishes but tried going moderately close to the recipe for the first time with this one.  I like hot/spicy but it was unexpectedly hot for something I planned to bring to a potluck.
Overall I like it and will try again.

Just WOW! I have only ever eaten Palak Paneer from Indian restaurants over the the years, but it is one of my favorite dishes and we have been talking about making it at home for years. My girlfriend and I decided to make it  a whole Indian dinner complete with some samosas we got in the frozen section of our local indian market. I made Tandoori chicken and she made the Palak Paneer following this recipe pretty close. We didn't add the fresh tomatoes just the canned tomatoes and juice from the can as part of the water and we also used 3 bags of fresh spinach and everything got blended in the blender before adding the Paneer cheese. This was better than I remember from various Indian restaurants. I will say it was very spicy , so back off on the red pepper flakes if your not a fan of heat. This recipe is a keeper.

Tastes great less than an hour after I made it, it’s only going to get better.  I only cut the red flakes way down to half teaspoon, still has a touch of heat, and won’t bother my kids.  I also used tofu to make it vegan as suggested.

Used Ginger paste instead of grated ginger.
