Very yummy deviled eggs.  I added mustard and pickles, then sprinkled with paprika because I just cannot do deviled eggs without those ingredients, but I am sure they would be lovely without.  Hubs requested deviled eggs and gobbled them down.  thanks for the recipe!

Made this recipe to take to covered dish dinner and got rave reviews. I have been asked to bring this the dish again.  The only tweak I made was used grape tomatoes sliced thin on top and fresh parsley as little sprigs on top, to give it a more festive look.

I doubled this recipe to take to an Easter party, and they were all gone in 10 minutes! Everybody commented on how great these were. My personal opinion is this is the best deviled egg recipe I have ever made!

Not bad deviled eggs.  If I made them again, I wouldn't add any salt because that is part of what the bacon adds.

I made only one change to recipe.  I added 1/4 teaspoon of mustard. It was a hit in my house and I will definitely make again.

Fantastic base recipe. The yolk mixture was a bit too yolky and bland so I upped the mayo some and then added some honey mustard. After that it was perfect! Everyone raved at the superbowl party!

Made this for my wife's family on Easter and it was a huge hit!  Will definitely be revisiting this one.
