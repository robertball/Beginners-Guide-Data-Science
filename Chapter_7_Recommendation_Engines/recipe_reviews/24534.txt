I will make this again, HOWEVER, for my family there was waaaaaaay too much BBQ sauce, so I will only put in half a bottle next time. I drained the beans too and it was fine(I cant stand thought of bean juice, lol). We will also add more meat, either sausage or hamburger. It seemed pretty skimpy on the meat. Otherwise the flavor was great! I cook for every evening meal for my hubby and three kids and this meal is a good one with a little help!

I halved he amount of barbecue sauce and thought it was too much. Will quarter next time. Will also cut brown sugar in half and add saut√©ed onions.

The yellow wax beans were the only thing I didn't have and wasn't going to make a trip to the store for them so I left them out. It still turned out good and I didn't miss them. I did drain some of the juice even though the recipe said not to but only to reduce the sodium. Overall good recipe and one I would make again and I'd probably still leave the wax beans out. They just seem out of place to me.

I liked this though I did change it quite a bit, omitting the yellow wax bean and brown sugar, and using a veg. based chipotle sausage instead of pork, and vegetarian baked beans. Still very good I think. And tasty over basmati rice.

This was ok. Kinda boring really. Husband ate it but wasn't overly impressed. Thanks anyway.
