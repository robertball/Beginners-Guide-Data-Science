I just made this twice in the past week!  Definitely a great recipe.  I did change it up the last time but not because it needed help, it is great the way it is.  I had a container of sweetened frozen strawberries that I wanted to use, so I thawed them out, drained the juice into a container and used the strawberry liquid instead of the water.  It really added a punch of flavor!   I also used a basic cream cheese frosting (because we all love cream cheese so much) and added about a cup of the frozen strawberries to the frosting and mixed it well.  Delish!  The end product tasted a lot like strawberry shortcake.  This recipe is a keeper!

I used strawberry cake and a white cake for contrast (swirled) and I poked with a straw.

My little girl wanted a strawberry birthday cake, so I made this one as written and it turned out great. I’m not usually much of a cake person, but I am a sweetened condensed milk person and this was a good combo.

I have made this several times.  I did change it by using a chocolate cake mix, and it is now my daughter’s and granddaughter’s favorite birthday cake.

I made this for my daughter’s birthday. I didn’t change anything and everyone really liked it. I was afraid with the sweetened condensed milk and the sweetened strawberries it would be “heavy “ but surprisingly it wasn’t. Very light and disappeared in one evening.
