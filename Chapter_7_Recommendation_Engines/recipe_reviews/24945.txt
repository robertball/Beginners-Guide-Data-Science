Great stuff!  I used this to fill dark chocolate cup cakes!  Mix in chocolate chips and it's great to swirl into brownies for cheesecake brownies.  You can even add it to muffins!  The possibilities are endless....

Very tasty.  I put it in devils food cake cupcakes.  I wasn't sure if I had to add it to the middle of the cake batter or just drop it on top, so I did both.  The stuff on top sunk to the middle & it worked great.  Very easy!

I had lost my grandmother's recipe for a similar filling from what I remember this seems very close to her's. I am using it to make kolacky for Easter. By the way kolacky is spelled the way I wrote it. I still have my family recipe for that from Poland.

EXCELLENT!  I used this recipe to spread on the dough of "Sweet Dinner Rolls".  They were the best ever!  UPDATE--This is the filling I used for the Pull-Apart Easter Blossom Bread.  So Yummy!!

OH the possibilities with this recipe!  Super easy and super yummy!  This recipe makes  a lot.  I filled 3 bread braids and I FILLED them..probably could have filled 5 loaves.   But I got rave reviews!  
Used the egg white with a little water to coat bread.  Came out beautiful!  
I have been thinking of more ways I want to use this really great recipe!

Awesome recipe.Love it in pastries. I would be careful though, using it as a spread uncooked. Because of the egg yolk in it, it sets up the potential for salmonella.

I used this to make a cream cheese povitica for a friend that LOVES the Strawberry Hill version, (but doesn't love paying $20 for one small loaf!) and I haven't been able to find a recipe for it. She loves it, I love it, and so does anyone else that's tried it. If you're planning on spreading this though, you don't need to put it in the fridge, it spreads quite nicely straight out of the mixer. So if anyone dares make povitica, TRY THIS AS A FILLER!

Great recipe! Added it to my cupcakes and it turned out wonderful. If you are looking for a Low Calorie alternative it turns out well, of course not as good ;), with low fat cream cheese & splenda,rather then regular cream cheese and sugar. Thanks for the recipe!

Mmmmmmmmmm delicious!  I love making berry crepes (I use the Dessert Crepes recipe) for my family from time to time.  This is excellent with no necessary alterations... although if you want to change the flavor a little I have used almond flavoring instead of vanilla from time to time (depending on the berry I use).  Excellent!

I added just a touch more of vanilla and used it with crescent rolls for cheese danish. Definately good for its purpose.  Will keep making, thanks for the post.

Super delicious! For some reason I haven't been adding the egg and it's been perfect without it. Use as a filling for the Extreme Chocolate Cake recipe on this website for some heavenly cupcakes! Half the original recipe is enough to fill about 24 cupcakes.

Excellent. Cheesecake-esque filling perfect for cupcakes. Just be sure to use a dense batter so you don't end up with cheese on the bottom & cupcake on top, like I did (oops!).

I used this to fill chocolate muffins. FABULOUS! The egg gives it a light fluffy texture, not too dense. Will definately use again.

This recipe gave me a base for filling  vol-au-vents and it  met the goal. My changes were minor. I wanted a stronger filling, able to stand up to also using it for danish pastries, so I added a couple of large pinches of self-raising flour. I also felt it needed a touch of citrus to balance the sweet so I included a small amount of lemon zest before baking. Used ready-made puff pastry & cut out the centre, leaving a thin, deep bottom. Filled the void with the cream cheese filling, painting the edges with egg wash. Didn't sugar the edges but it could be done; I like  pastries such as these without the added sweetness. Baked in a hot (200 C) oven (I'm in the UK) for approx. 15 minutes, watching frequently to ensure they neither burned nor remained dough-y. The edges raised beautifully and the filling was perfect for what I anticipated. These can be eaten warm or cold...the filling holds up. Would be good with a spoon of softened raspberry jam on top and a  dollop of cream for a fancy treat. Enjoyed it a lot.

The filling was good on its own, but I dolloped it onto some danishes and it overpowered them.

I thought the filling was good tasting enough, but I think I will add a touch extra moisture next time with maybe more yolk or something. Was just a bit dry. I imagine it depends what you're baking really.

Very easy and really good! I sliced 2 cans of rolled pillsbury crescent dough in to 1/4 inch slices, then flattened centers and filled them with this filling. Baked at 350 for about 14 minutes. Then mixed 3/4 c powder sugar with 1 tbsp milk and 2 tbsp melted butter and glazed the danish.

This filling is perfect. It's light and flavorful with a semi-fluffy (not slimey like some) texture. I used it to fill kolachskis for Christmas--by itself and with poppyseed filling mixed in. The "plain" ones disappeared quickly. Then they devoured the ones with the poppyseeds -- something my crew wouldn't even try before. Don't ever tell my family how easy this is to make. They think I've revealed a dormant talent in my old age. 

I'll have to wait for the New Year's calorie counting to  meet its inevitable demise before I experiment with more uses for this wonderful stuff, but it's going to happen. This is way too good of a recipe to restrict to holidays.

Delicious and very basic. Instead of regular granulated sugar, I used powdered sugar so it mixes better. I used this filling for crepes, and it was very good.

This was beyond  yummy! So simple  with minimum  ingredients  and little  effort, can't  beat something  that's  not  only  delicious  but fast  as well. It  has just the right amount  of sweetness so the cream cheese  shines because  it's  not  hidden  under a ton of sugar . Used it to make blueberry  cheese  danishes with the Gluten  Free  Danish  recipe  on this site. So good. Would  definitely  recommend .

This is the perfect go to base for a creamy cream cheese filling!!
I have used it swirled in brownies, as filling for devils food cupcakes. It also makes a fancy but easy dessert that even my 8 yr old granddaughter can throw together. Cut a square of puff pastry, add a small dollop of the filling, a few slices of scalloped apples, sprinkle with chopped walnuts before pulling up into a little purse and twisting the peak together. Bake until the pastry is puffy and golden. Absolutely perfect with a scoop of ice cream.
