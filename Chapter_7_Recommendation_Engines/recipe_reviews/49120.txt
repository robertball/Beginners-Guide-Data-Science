My family loved this potato salad. At first I was worried that it would be too spicy, but it ended up not being hot at all -- just full of flavor.

I omitted the bacon and used 1/4 teaspoon ground cumin instead of the seeds. Also used 2 large peppers. It had a nice zip to it, but not overly spicy. My only complaint is that I found it a tad bit dry. Perhaps I'll add some chicken broth next time to give it a little moisture.

Tremendous salad! Looks beautiful and gourmet. Tastes gourmet. You are going to have to like cilantro, cumin and coriander in order to like this recipe. Instead of grilling the red onion, I just put the thick slices in a skillet and let them char and carmelize. That was the first thing that my husband noticed and loved -- and he doesn't like onions. Can't wait to make this again for company.

Thils potato salad is spicy, tasty, and would be a delicious side for summer barbecue or with smoked meats.

If your idea of potato salad ranges in variety from mustard to mayo, stand by!  This tasty dish brings the flavor of the Southwest to a pot luck classic.  I've made this for functions ranging from backyard barbecues to company Christmas parties and get requests for the recipe every time. As an added bonus, since there are no egg products in the recipe it's perfect for picnics.  
Well worth the effort. Every so often, Houston rocks!

This recipe was outstanding.  I couldn't find the cumin seeds, so used 1/4 tsp ground instead (probably could have used a little more).  I also only used one jalapeno (worried a little about the heat), but 2 might have been even better.   I'll definitely make it again!

I gave it a 5, but hubby just wanted the "missing mayo".  Followed the recipe for the most part, except I used 1/4 tsp ground cumin, omitted coriander, used  jalapeno slices from a jar (chopped), and added cilantro and jalapeno according to my family tastes (tho I think it was pretty on target for the recipe).  My only suggestions are cut your onions into 1/2 - 1 inch pieces for better distribution and add the oil/vinegar right before serving.  I think that was part of why hubby wanted the mayo, I let it sit for an hour and the potatoes absorbed the vin/oil, but  it was wonderful when I first added it.  Also, I think next time I'll add more bacon and onions.

This was a great alternative to creamy potato salad.  Due to what I had on hand, I used ground cumin and coriander, and used parsley instead of cilantro.  It was delicious - got lots of compliments!

This was pretty good, but needed something (salt?). I omitted the bacon because I am a vegetarian, so maybe that's what it was missing.

I really enjoyed this different take on potato salad!  My hubby doesn't enjoy mayo or creamy salads and this was PERFECT for him.  It was all eaten at our bbq so I daresay that speaks for itself.  Thank you for sharing.

I took this to a potluck and I tried it beforehand and loved it. However, many of the guests said it was waaay to hot for their liking. I would suggest making sure you use 2 small to avg sized jalapenos just to be safe. Also, I didn't have any coriander or cumin seeds so I just used a Tablespoon of Cumin and it the taste was delicious. I'll make it again, but I'll be sure to use less jalepeno or at least smaller ones.

I fixed this as one of the side dishes for my daughter's wedding.  250 people attended; I changed the servings to 100 people, it worked great and was a winner!

this is original and makes a great change of pace from "creamy" potato salad. of course, i live in houston, and have never had much intertest in cafe annie since they're rumored to have been on the decline recently. but i got lots of compliments from family at yesterday's bar-b-q. 4 stars because you really have to serve this fresh and warm; i had mine in the fridge for 8 hours or so and it really lacked the kick it had when i first made it.
