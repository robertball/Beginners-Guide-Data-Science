I use this recipe and make it quite often, Iâ€™m fairly lazy so instead of doing the pan dumpling part I cook this recipe as waffles in a waffle iron. I serve it with baked chicken thighs, a sallad and some plain greek yoghurt.

I made the recipe/video as shown.  I just didn't have any bacon.  Sorry.  THEY ARE AWESOME even without the bacon!  I love that I can make them the night before and then add the egg just before pan frying.  Super easy.  Fast enough to make.  Definitely agree mashing when sweet potato is hot is better.  Leftovers make for a nice add on with breakfast the next day.  I eat them cold with breakfast.  So yummy!

Sorry to spoil the 5 star rating on this one, but we just did not care for it all that much.  It seemed to me that it needed more flavor.  The one reason I chose this recipe is that there's no sugar added, but honestly I think a little brown sugar is probably what this needed for us to enjoy it.

I made this with baked russet potatoes and cream cheese. It did not need much of the flour mixture as it was quite dry already and when I do it again I will remove the bacon prior to frying the patties as the bacon was pretty much "bacon bits" when I was done. Next time I will pull them when they are done and add them back in the sauce at the end. All in all however it was a great first try and I will be trying again very soon but this time with sweet potatoes and goat cheese.

Basically potato pancakes with sweet potatoes. The addition of the cheese is a nice one although I couldn't taste that it was goat cheese so I will probably just use cream cheese in the future. While I did sprinkle chopped bacon on at the end, I did not do the 'bacon butter' because it sounded....greasy?

I'm sure this is a good recipe as is but I just mixed the cooked sweet potato with the goat cheese and that alone was very good.
