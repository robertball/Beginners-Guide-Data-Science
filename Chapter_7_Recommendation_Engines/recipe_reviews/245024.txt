The pumpkin sauce tastes exactly like pumpkin pie. It doesnt taste bad, just strange for a sauce. No one in my family liked this except for my picky kid who hates everything (go figure)!

I followed the recipe exactly and it does have a good taste but I found the sauce a little bit too watery. Let time I'll reduce the chicken broth.

I made this last night.  Everybody loved it.  I loved it because it was quick, tasted like fall and it was elegant.  No big changes:  I cut the white sugar but kept the brown.  I added garlic powder and a little more nutmeg and some white pepper.  I also used skim milk.  It was wonderful.  Thank you for sharing.
