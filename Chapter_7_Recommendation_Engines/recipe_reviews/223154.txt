I reviewed this about 6 months ago. Tried it again tonight with the following changes. Marinated the salmon for 2 hours in a bourbon glaze. Next I did not boil and blanch the asparagus, just placed it next to the salmon and it turned out great. Omitted the potatoes and had a healthy one pot meal. Served the glaze on the side. (Note: using a tablet, can't figure out how to edit my earlier review.)

I've made this recipe several times for family & friends and everyone loves it.   It's so healthy and easy to do!  I always follow a new recipe exactly the first time or two, but the last few times I've made this, I've changed the vegetables: green beans, mushrooms, zucchini, onions or whatever I have.  I haven't pre-cooked these vegetables and they cook just fine in the packages.  I also added capers for an added zing.

Living in Alaska, I've made salmon in 30 different ways, so i was looking for something exciting, new and easy after woking an 11 hour day.  I have to say, Chef John nails it!  Steaming a fillet for 15 minutes in parchment works like a charm.  I coated with avocado oil, used coarse sea salt, a heavy amount of pepper, some old bay, and slices of lemon on some sockeye and threw it in.  Then i prepared a homemade caesar salad.  The timing couldn't have been better.  A gourmet meal in under 30 minutes from start to finish.  Add a glass or two of vino, and viola...the perfect meal after a long monday.  Thanks Chef John!

It was so much fun seeing the parchment paper puff up!  I discovered the second round that you REALLY need to crease the edges to make it air-tight.  Also, you need to overlap each edge almost so that you are re-folding each edge.  Use a spoon to crease the edges.  My salmon pieces were much larger than Chef John’s so I needed to cook them for 30 minutes.  The tiny potatoes and the asparagus were just fine with the extra time.  Husband loved it!

Too many potatoes to fit in parchment! Doubled the asparagus & sprinkled salmon with dill, sea salt, & lemon pepper.  Will add cut up grape tomatoes next time.  Turned out perfect.  I'm cooking my salmon in parchment from now on! This was a complete meal. Loved it!

I don't like red-meat fish. this looked easy and the wife loves salmon, so I made this. I did add some diced zukes and halved some cherry tomatos. added fresh dill to fish, oregano to maters, and rosemary to taters. sprinkled more evoo and salt / pepper. I ate all of mine...a huge plate. this is a keeper!

I am kicking myself for not taking a photo, but when I made this I was really hungry and just wanted to eat :) The video helps a lot and it loops so you can prep with out having to pause it. This technique is my new and only was for cooking salmon now. I have got to be one of the worst people when it comes to cooking fish other then an easy white fish. My husband was actually astonished at how easy and delicious this meal was. I had mine with fresh broccoli and green beans and dropped them in boiling water for 2 min then pulled them out and immediately put them into icy water. Then followed the recipe as told to. I added a little Goya adobo (a Hispanics must in the kitchen), and a little blackened old bay. I then topped it with a little basil, dill and finally a few thinly sliced lemon rounds and a squeeze of juice. I didn't have the stuff to make mustard aioli, so I made my own using 1/2 cup Greek yogurt, 1 Tblspn tzatziki spice mix, 2 large cloves garlic, 1/2 tblspn lemon zest and juice, and then just processed it together. I let it chill in the fridge for a little while and gently dripped some on top after cutting open the parchment packs. Delicious meal! I think next I will try it with a stuffed salmon. :) Thank you Chef John, you have restored my husbands faith in my seafood cooking abilities!

Simple and delicious!  It was my first time using parchment paper with salmon, so I watched the video before I got started.  It was extremely helpful, and I was able to get everything prepped for the oven in no time.  I followed the cooking instructions to a "t", and everything turned out perfectly!  I needed to reheat leftovers, and found that the salmon was just a touch over-done (to our liking)--so I will shorten original cooking time by just a couple of minutes next time if there's a possibility of having to reheat the salmon at any point.  But serving the dish as is right away was just right.  The vegetables were fantastic!  We squeezed fresh lemon over the plate, which added just enough final flavor for us.  Loved it!  I will be cooking salmon this way from now on.

Hard to trust it would cook properly without opening the parchment to check, but it turned out perfectly done and tasty.

Salmon came out pretty good. Need to cook for 20 min vs 15 to make the salmon firmer~ came out a little mushy for our family. Be generous with the salt & pepper as it really ads to the overall flavor. It was a very nice recipe ~ thanks!

This was a tad bland but a very delicious way to cook salmon! I had to watch the video in order to understand how to fold the parchment but it worked wonderfully and the salmon was cooked perfectly. I will probably season it to my own tastes next time though in order to get a little more flavor out of it...

WoWwwwwwww...best salmon I have ever had, and it is my favorite food, so I eat a lot  of it! No need to blanch the asparagus if you have thinner stalks. I topped the salmon with fresh cilantro, garlic, and a zesty pepper blend made by Kroger. The salmon is so buttery and melting that you almost need a spoon to eat it! I opened the bag (which didn't inflate much for me) and ate the whole meal over the stove. I could NOT help it! Chef John, thank you! You are a GENIUS!

Oh my gosh. So delish. I used red, yellow, and orange peppers as well as onion for the veggies. No precooking them. Paired it with oven brown rice with carrots and mushrooms as well as caprese salad with balsamic reduction (both from this site) for a tasty and healthy dinner on date night. Definitely a keeper.

The entire family ate every morsel!  My parchment wrappers didn’t balloon as much as the Chef’s & I baked them 7 mins longer because my fillets were larger.  The salmon was moist.  The dressing was great.

So delicious and easy to make. My boys(husband included) practically licked their plate. They all request it now, aioli included! I like to serve this with a homemade garlic and herb rice. Thanks Chef John! You rock! ;)

This was an easy dish to make, but it is very impressive. I think it would be nice for a romantic date-night! I made a few substitutions. I didn't have salmon, so I replaced it with tilapia. It is such a basic recipe that almost any fish or poultry would do. I didn't have parchment paper, but foil worked fine. This recipe is easy to prepare, but it does take some time. The results are beautiful and while tasty, they were a little bland. I would definitely suggest seasoning this to your taste. Next time, I'll do a citrus pepper blend. This is a great recipe for the beginning of a fantastic meal, though!

This recipe is amazing! Although the procedures are so simple, the result is magnificent. It tastes better than most cooked salmon I had in restaurants. The fish is so moist and it absorbs all the flavors of the vegetables and herbs. It’s light and the sauce is incredibly yummy with salmon too!

I have 2 boys, 14 and 11.  my kids helped cut  and oil the paper which made it a nice family activity.  We each ate one packet each and were SO VERY FULL. Yes, 2 big ol boys, FULL off one packet, PERFECT middle of the week meal. We each have one more packet to reheat tonight for dinner. I am looking forward to finding out how they hold up to reheating.

This a great technique that will ensure your fish isn't dried out (provided you don't overcook it). I've also used this method to cook whole fish (cleaned, gutted, stuffed with lemons, herbs, and some white wine in the cavity).

I pulled the fish out of the freezer believing it to be salmon, and  when I unwrapped the thawed fish it was swordfish.  No matter, I cooked it just as the recipe requested and it was delicious.

My family was really impressed with the presentation.  My mother is not a big fan of salmon and she enjoyed the dish.  Loved the minimal clean-up.  I did not blanch the asparagus first but they were plenty done.  Will definitely experiment with other fish and use the technique again.

Since I tripled the recipe I had to make a change in cooking method since my oven could not accommodate 6 packets. So I cooked this in a casserole dish for about 25 minutes. Came out perfect. The salmon was very moist and veggies were just slightly crunchy. Will definitely make again.

This was really tasty! I cooked the potatoes for about 7 minutes in water in the microwave first, and did not pre-cook the asparagus. Salt, pepper, 3 cloves of minced garlic, chopped parsley over all, then added a about 1 tbls of butter, cut into cubes over each packet. Placed lemon slices on top of the salmon, and gave a good squeeze of lemon juice over all as well. 18 minutes was perfect for ours. This came together quickly, and clean up was a breeze. Hubs and I both enjoyed this very much!

This turned out fantastic and pretty! I didn't add salt and pepper, but used a Hot Texas Salt mix from a local company, and added a couple sprigs of fresh oregano before baking. Topped with a mustard aioli.

Easy to make.  My son loves the Chicago Cub joke re: deflated pouch and Cub fans hopes of post-season aspirations.  Since then, they have won a World Series, Go Cubs! 

To cook salmon this way is great. Most of the time, my pouch does not inflate, but the fish comes out great anyway!  We've added red potatoes and broccoli as well as yellow squash on occasion. And it's always been a hit. Thanks Chef John!

We eat a lot of salmon and this was another very nice version.  I have used parchment packets to cook other fish dishes as well.  To season the fish, I added Kosher salt, lemon pepper, and Paul Prudhomme's "Seafood Magic" .  I did not pre-cook the asparagus--it was done at the same time as the fish without doing this step.  I would recommend thinner spears, though, and not the thick ones.  400 degrees for 15 minutes was perfect. Received well by family.

This salmon is delicious, moist and flaky. The sauce is absolutely fantastic with the fish and so simple to make.  I added a pinch of dill to my sauce. Loved it. I've made several of Chef Johns recipes and this is the best by far.  So simple but so good.

This was fun, easy and very moist and delicious. I used Old Bay spices and lemon juice.

Also substituted the potatoes with chunks of red pepper (my family likes Low Cholesterol).

We halved the recipe because it was late at night and my husband wanted a small portion of the salmon he had just brought home from work. So I came upon Chef John's recipe, it was quick, easy to divide and I have made his recipes before.

I am not a salmon fan, but my husband loves it and I would not mind making this recipe more often.

The salmon turned out perfect. Make sure to have very large parchment sheets. Mine was self-cut and it was hard to make a good seal. I would cook the asparagus way. Maybe not boiling it at all or at most 2 minutes instead of 5.

I marinated the salmon in Italian dressing for about 2 hours. I put the asparagus and the potatoes in raw and added a few minutes on the cooking time. The salmon and asparagus were perfect but the potatoes could have used more cooking time. Next time I would par-boil the potatoes to give them a head start. My husband likes salmon and I usually do not. I was able to enjoy this however after I topped it with a cilantro lime sauce. I will make it again.

I topped the salmon with the garlic aoli and it turned out great, although just a little too well done!    As the article indicated, it is difficult not to overcook the fish because of the inability to check it during cooking, and it keeps cooking even after removing from the oven until you open the parchment.  As well,  the thickness of the fillet is another variable to play with so I'm not sold on the method.

Delicious! My husband and I both loved this! This process has become our go-to for preparing just about any fish! I make mashed potatoes instead of cooking the potatoes in the parchment, but I do add the asparagus. We sometimes add Cajun seasoning to kick it up a notch, or put a lemon slice on top! Wonderful recipe

I only cooked salmon in the parchment.  I had planned to use foil.  When I realized I didn't have enough foil, I turned to the roll of parchment paper that has been in my cupboard forever. I followed the directions  and my salmon was delicious. The next time I will try the recipe as written.

Delicious and pretty easy.  Followed Chef John's directions exactly.  15" was perfect, salmon was moist, used salt and an herb blend that complimented the fish (didn't have fresh herbs).  My packet didn't proud much but worked.   Oiling both sides of paper was messy, not sure why outside needed to be oiled but did it anyway.

I'm having so much fun with this website. However this particular recipe didn't hit the home run I have had with others.  Salmon was a little dry which can be a problem with frozen salmon.

I first learned to do this in cooking school - Parchment Sheets are much easier than the rolls.  You can also cook this with a compound butter on top instead of oil.  I add lemon to this and S&P to taste.   The good thing about this is you can add whatever you like to the pouches.  Easy peasy.   

You can also do chicken  this way!

Awesome recipe. Easy to overcook though, so be careful and mindful of times.

I used frozen fillets, it looked like the skin was still on one side.... And I only used potatoes.... I didn't have parchment, so I used foil. Everything turned out dry, the potatoes had no flavor.

I made the salmon exactly as stated but roasted some heirloom carrots along side. I used course sea salt and ground pepper as well as olive oil on the salmon and carrots. I started the carrots first and roasted for 15 minutes and then added the salmon in parchment for an additional 15 minutes. It was excellent!  I'll try to figure out how to share a pic!

Best baked salmon ever!  Made exactly as described, but without the veggies.  It was delicious and perfectly cooked.  Thank you, Chef John!

This was perfect!  We just used dill and sea salt to season.  We put zucchini sticks in and they were awesome.  Our salmon was not as thick so we did  a few minutes less and opened right away to keep it from over-cooking.  Next time I might try lowering temp a little for the last few minutes.

Perfection! I was a little nervous about not being able to see if it was cooked until cutting open the paper, but I followed the exact cooking instructions and it worked perfectly!  My husband said it was as good as any restaurant salmon he has ever had. The only complaint came from my 11 yo son; he was frustrated that it just fell apart so easily, haha! Based on other reviews, I did not pre cook my veggies and they turned out just fine. I also like how each pouch can be customized to each person's preferences of seasoning and veggies.

Chef John, we can't thank you enough for this recipe.  It is now a favorite and staple in our house. We change it up occasionally with the vegetables that we include, depending on what's on hand.  I also sometimes season the salmon with Old Bay and paprika, but the cooking method, time and original recipe is spot on.  Look forward to your continuing posts!

The salmon is amazing in this recipe.  I put some fresh herbs, a garlic clove, and a bay leaf in with the salmon.  I also put a little pat of butter instead of more olive oil. Perfectly cooked and so moist.  Also, would recommend not cooking the asparagus at all before cooking in the parchment.  It gets a little over-cooked.

I just made this tonight and it was great!  I was looking for healthy baked or grilled salmon recipes when I came across this.  I watched the video and then followed the recipe exactly and it was so easy.  I made mine this time with asparagus but I will make this again with other veggies and I'm sure it will be just as good.

This recipe was easy and fantastic!  This is only the second time I've ever cooked salmon and I was nervous because the first time I grilled it and it was horrible.  I did not add the asparagus or potatoes so I cannot speak to the veggies but I followed all the directions for cooking the fish in the parchment with the exception of adding dill to the salt and pepper just because I really like dill.  The fish was cooked perfectly and tasted amazing cooked this way.  I never thought I'd eat salmon and enjoy it!  Know I know I have what it takes!  Thanks, Chef John!

Fantastic. We loved it. Cooked exactly as written, minus the miso, as I didn't have any. This will definitely be a go to for salmon.

I now love this way of cooking salmon!  I followed other people's suggestions and didn't cook the asparagus prior to putting them in the parchment with the other foods and it cooked just perfectly.

Absolutely delicious! I had never used parchment paper before, and was a little concerned when my packets didn't puff up like they did in Chef John's video. No worries, though! It was so perfectly moist and flavorful. I decided it do salt, pepper, and Herbes De Provence seasoning. I am sure this is one recipe I will try again and again! Thanks so much Chef John :)
