This was really really good. I cooked mine in the crockpot on high for 5 hours, last hour of cooking I added thinly sliced red onions. I also was out of chili powder so I used 1 whole packet of taco seasoning (Lawry's Hot Taco),  and used fresh minced garlic.  I shredded the meat and left it in the crockpot for about 20 minutes.  Will be using the leftovers to make enchiladas.

This recipe is FABULOUS!  It's tastes like what they serve at Moe's Southwest Grill. I made it in the crockpot (I don't like to cook things in aluminum foil).  I cooked it all night on low.  In the morning I shredded it and vacuumed bagged it for freezing.  When I want to make tacos, enchiladas, etc. I'll have my meat ready.  Thanks so much!

Try adding a Modelo beer and a 1/4 cup of cider vinegar for the  liquid. Also replace 1 of the cans of chiles with a small can of chipotle peppers in adobo. Adds a ton of depth to the flavor!

My husband lived in Veracruz, Mexico before we were married and he was totally "WOWED". I have made this with every cut of pork and it is so good! I also make in the crockpot and have never been disappointed. I have also made it in the crockpot with a beef chuck roast and it is delicious. You won't be disappointed!

Definitely worth making!!!  Used Hot Mexican Chili Powder as it has such a unique flavor and subbed cumin for the oregano as I was out of it!  Wonderful flavor, though I didn't find it to be as spicy as many reviewers have noted.  Next time I'll add additional cumin, garlic and jalapenos for a bit more flavor.  Wonderful - give it a try!

I wish there was a 10 star option!  The most delicious recipe we have ever tried off this site.  This was the hit of our Super Bowl party.  Topped the tacos with Southwestern Slaw and made pinto beans.  I followed recipe to a tee.  The only thing that I had to adjust was cooking time.  My 4 pound roast (bone in) took almost 7 hours to be fork tender and fall off the bone.  It was worth the wait though!  We just ate towards the end of the game instead of half time.  The kids and adults couldn't stop raving about how good this was.  This is a keeper and one that I will make next time we have a crowd over.  THANKS!

Excellent!  I didn't drain the green chiles, and btw they get added to the dried spices to make a paste.  I used a pork loin and ended up cooking it in my cast iron dutch oven.  After shredding the meat I put it back in the sauce.  Very good for tacos.  Will make again for sure!

I doubled all the spices for this recipe and I used homemade taco seasoning and a California ground chili powder which has half the amount of heat that normal chili powder has but still packs the same punch, flavor-wise. After I rubbed the spice mixture onto the pork shoulder, I seared my pork shoulder, then I laid it on the aluminum foil. I then poured the green chilies over the top, wrapped it with the foil and laid it on my roasting rack in my roasting pan. This roast pork was moist, flavorful and off the charts delicious. I might play with the seasonings again when I make this again but as is, we ate our fill.

This was a really great recipe, very flavorful. I will be making this again, but couldn't quite give this five starts. The cooking time was far too little for me, as some others have noted. Because we were on a schedule I ended up just carving the roast like normal after five hours, and cut into strips and chunks for bowls, tacos, etc. I also did not find this to be as spicy as it was described. The meat is wonderfully seasoned, but some cayenne pepper or maybe even some more authentic mexican chilis/powdered spices would be needed for this to be spicy. Once again this was a great meal - thanks for sharing!

Wonderfully flavorful!  This recipe made fabulous taco filling.  Because I was going to be out all day, I made it in the crock-pot, and it came out tender and moist.  The only substituion I made was to use cumin instead of oregano.  I will definitely make this again.

I made this in a foil bag in the oven because I forgot to throw it in the crockpot in time.  I added 1/4 cup water so it would stay moist and it did.  It was sooo good. I spread butter on one side of the corn tortillas and warmed them till crispy. then set out the meat, lettuce, cheese and sour cream. It didn't even need pico de gallo!  I will be making this often!  Today we used the leftovers in some cuban black beans and rice for lunch.  yum!

I generally snap photos of the things I make but this time I was so excited to sit down and eat this I completely forgot!  The aroma as this was cooking was so inviting that by the time dinner time came around getting the camera out was the furthest thing from my mind.  Hubs can’t take a lot of heat, so I used the chili powder recipe as defined by Penzey’s Spices, which consists of the mild ancho chili powder, cumin and oregano.  I rubbed the pasty, spicy “goo” all over the roast and then just let it do its thing in the Crock Pot for about eight hours.  Pulling it apart with two forks was no effort at all – this roast was fall apart tender.  I set out all the fixins for tacos – warm tortillas of course, homemade pico de gallo,  a shredded Mexican cheese blend, queso fresco, cotija cheese,  shredded iceberg lettuce and sour cream.  Hubs and I each made our own (mine was better) and we just enjoyed the heck out of them.  Flavorful, but neither too hot nor too spicy.  I never thought I’d enjoy this as much as I did – just delicious.

FANTASTIC "base" recipe. Actually made "as is" and was very good! HOWEVER - we like a bit more spicy, AND Crock Pot suits my busy life more so: I double recipe (all components) AND add 1 can Rotel (or equiv) and prob another 1/4 cup chili powder - enough for a thick paste to coat roast with.  Place this bad boy in an oil sprayed crock pot , in mid, on high for a good 7ish hours. This tender/juicy/SHREDDED meat WILL make your tongue slap your face silly! (or something like that! LOL!)

This was AWESOME! We buy organic, pastured pork from Big Bear Ranch in Horsefly, BC in bulk, so I'm always looking for interesting ways to cook legs of pork and this recipe takes the cake for sure! The first night we ate it in tacos, but it was so good my hubby was eating it by itself on rice for lunch the rest of the week.  I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars for a few reasons. I knew from reading the recipe it would need a couple of tweaks: Most importantly because there was no way I was putting crumby commercial taco seasoning onto my beautiful organic pork! Yuck and totally not necessary (not to mention that  is expensive).  Instead I subbed in one heaping tablespoon each of cumin, paprika and dried oregano. I also used way more garlic and homegrown jalapeno peppers instead of canned. Wacked everything into a blender and smoothed it on.  Instead of wrapping it in foil, I used a small dutch oven and poured a liter of homemade chicken stock in to make sure everything stayed moist. Cooked it for about 4 hours at 300. It could easily have cooked for another hour, but hubby came home hungry! The roast was juicy and crazy flavourful. We used the gravy in the bottom as a base for some killer chili afterwards.   Yum yum!!

Very fork-tender and flavorful.  I shredded the pork and wrapped it in soft flour tortillas with fresh pico, avocado slices, and sour cream.  Delicious!

This is one of those recipes that if you combine the delicousness + the easiness it should be given more than 5 stars. I suggest two methods of cooking it. If you're home, wrap it in aluminum foil and cook in the oven. If you're wanting to cook it while at work, again, wrap it in aluminum foil and then cook it in a crockpot. The key is keeping it wrapped tightly in the aluminum foil so keep all the juices locked in. 

The ONLY thing I would add to this recipe is slice up fresh jalapenos and lay them on top of the roast while cooking! DELSIH! This will be in my regular meal plans!

5 stars for taste AND ease! I did this in my crockpot with a pork loin for 5 hours on high (I also added 1/2 cup of water just to help keep things juicy.) Thanks for a keeper! Edit: On my third or fourth - I forget - making of this recipe, I switched the kind of green chilies I was using to ones that had a seasoning already in them. Be CAREFUL with these. It made the entire dish too salty!!

I was really apprehensive about this for tacos but my family loved it! I used 1 can Rotel, 1 tsp each chili powder, oregano and taco seasoning, 1 tbsp minced garlic, at 3 hours the liquid had evaporated so I added 1/2 cup vegetable stock and turned off the oven until we needed it. Will make again.

This is probably even better cooked as directed, but I like using my crockpot whenever I can and that is how I cooked this pork. Turned out great...we really liked the flavor and it did make terrific tacos!

Did not care for this very much. The spices gave it a one-note taste. Removed as much of the interior meat as possible to make barbecue.

This was absolutely, out-of-this-world delicious!  I made the rub as listed, but added a tablespoon of cumin (love the stuff), some minced onion, and chipotle powders to the mix.  I slathered my little piggie and wrappped overnight, then slow cooked wrapped in the foil for about 9 1/2 hours.  This was tender and flavorful, and the broth is absolutely delicious.  A do-over and a definite keeper.  Thanks for a great recipe, RMARMOLEJO.

I used pork loin with the layer of fat trimmed off.  I added about a cup of chicken broth, some cumin and a quartered onion and left in the crockpot until tender.  Then I shredded, added a bit more chicken stock and let sit in the juices until dinnertime.  Fabulous!  Served with Mexican rice and quacomole on soft shells....yummy!!!!!

So easy, so tasty and so tender!  While cleaning out the freezer I discovered all sorts of pork - bone-in pork chops, boneless chops,a 3lb boneless tenderloin... Whatever possessed me to buy so much pork I don't know.  I never have good luck getting pork tender or flavorful, so I rarely cook it - one look in the freezer and you'll agree.  Anyway, I grabbed a pack of the boneless chops and the pork tenderloin, threw it all in a glass baking dish, doubled the rub mixture, covered with foil and went shopping (hubby was home). I baked at 350 for about 3 hours.  Didn't need to cook any longer as the meat was shredding itself.  Obviously, the cooking time will vary based on the type of meat used. Anyway, I finally got flavorful, tender pork!  The kids even ate it! Will definitely make this again to use up the rest of the pork in the freezer.

I do use the crockpot method and this turnes out great every time! I have been very creative with the meat... use in carnitas, enchilatas, and other casseroles. Yummy!

AWESOME!!!! I have been looking for a recipe for "carne al pastor" which I have been unable to find but this comes pretty close. It has a great flavor. I tweaked it a bit and added a little more chili powder, threw in some cumin and used rotel with green chilies added in. We ate it in corn tortilla and topped it with cilanto, onions and a squeeze or two of lime!!! My 3 and 5 year olds actually loved it!!!! Thanks!!!

The first time I made this, I made a mistake and added 2 -  7 ounce cans of green chilies and it was amazing!!!!  Once I figured out my mistake, I made it as written, and it was still good, but not as good as my oops.  Even the kids rave for this one!

I made this recipe in the crockpot and cooked it for 5 hours on high. I followed the recipe exactly except I added a half a beer. The meat was very tender and flavorful. Everyone like it....even my mexican mother in law! The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it was pretty greesy. Super good though! Thanks for the recipe.

This was delicious!  My son made this for dinner tonight, only he used the crock pot instead of the oven.  He used a Taco seasoning recipe from AR, fresh oregano from our garden as well as our own hot peppers.  He added 1/2 cup of water and skipped the foil wrapping all together. It was so tender and moist.  We will be enjoying the leftovers on rolls with pepper jack cheese, slices of tomato and green pepper for lunch tomorrow.  Will be making again!

I've been making this exact recipe for 3 years now for my family.  It is our "go to" recipe for Carnita Night.  My family gets testy if I don't make it every couple of weeks.  If you put it in the slow cooker instead of the oven, the results are just as divine.

We followed the directions exactly and after reading all the wonderful reviews were very excited, but extremely disappointed. The meat did NOT pull apart, and the only flavor we could taste was chili powder. We difinitely WON'T be using this recipe again.

I did not care for this recipe.  It seems to be missing something.  I feel the taco seasoning did not mix well with the meat.  I've had fantastic pork tacos at Rosa Mexicano in Miami and I have to say I was hoping that these would come close...They were way off...

This was totally and COMPLETELY amazing. I also used the crock-pot because my hubby doesn't like aluminum foil on his food. It turned out GREAT.  I never would have imagined pork tacos to be so yummy.. and easy! We eat this nearly every week... we should probably quit before we wear ourselves out of it. 
Try this and you won't regret it!

I wrapped this in foil and put in the crockpot while we went boating-after a few misshaps, we returned 12 hrs. later and had incredible tacos-the extra time in the pot made it even better!

A+++ recipe.  This one is going on the meal rotation.  Husband said it's good enough to serve to company.  As read in other reviews, I wrapped in foil and cooked in crock pot on low for 8 hours.

REALLY good!  I omitted the chilies and added 1/2 the chili powder because I was worried about it being too spicy for my kids.  Used a dutch oven instead of wrapping in foil and added 1/2 c. water and a sliced onion.  Came out so moist and shredded easily.  The kids and adults loved it!  So easy and delicious.

Made a huge crock-pot full for my birthday party. Turned out great, however, when using a pork butt, you'll need to pick out the really fatty parts. Once that was done - it was ALL GOOD!

This was just fabulous.  My son and grandson just kept eating and eating.  I used a jar of El Pinto green chilies.  And I made Buffy's beans to go with.  And pico de gallo and guacamole.  Excellent recipe.  Made in Crock pot.  Very easy.

Pretty good.... I still prefer Diyeana's pork chile rojo better, but it was nice to try something different this time. Both Diyeana and Dee's recipes are similar. It's the cooking method (oven vs. slow cooker) that's the main difference - and I'm a sucker for a good 'ol crockpot. :) My hubby picked up a 4.5 lb. shoulder roast (the smallest cut available), but I did not increase any of the spice rub ingredients. I found that it took closer to 4 hours for my roast to cook thru (at the 3.5 hour mark it was a bit too tough to shred). NOTE: Instead of wrapping in aluminum foil, I placed my roast in my Le Crueuset Dutch oven. It cooked up beautifully! Served with soft corn tortillas, shredded red cabbage, pico de gallo, my hubs' homemade guac and Spanish rice on the side, this was a decent, no fuss meal. Thanks for sharing, RMARMOLEJO! :-)

THIS recipe is in our weekly rotation now! We all love it, even the kids. I use whatever pork roast is cheaper that week and do the coating exactly how the recipe says. I freeze the leftovers, and reheat with a little taco sauce in a pan to add any juices that mightve gotten dried up in the freezer. its AMAZING!

Love, Love, Love this recipe!  The only recipe I use now for carnitas!  After making this several times, I do add a little more taco seasoning, more fresh garlic, and throw in fresh cilantro from our garden.

This was so yummy! I doubled the rub/sauce per other recommendations and I ran out of chili powder so I did 1/4 c. chili powder and 1/4 c. of cumin. I put it in the crock pot for 8 hours and it was so moist! I will definitely be making this again!

This is probably the best recipe I've found on this website!! I LOVE LOVE LOVE it!!! I actually cooked it in the crockpot for half the day and it was so flavorful and tender! It really helped with the Mexican food cravings I was having! I made it with flour tortillas, sour cream, cheese and homemade salsa! Soooo good!

so insanely good. tasted just like carnitas from chipotle. cooked this in the crockpot until the meat started falling apart (about an hour on high and 5 hours on low). I used old el paso green taco sauce instead of diced green chilis (all I had on hand), which made the "paste" easy to apply and stick to the meat.

I had never had pork tacos but had a roast that I didn't know what to do with it so I thought I'd give this recipe a try.  We loved this and it will make it onto our regular menu - however, I will be trying a few things to see about intensifying the flavor (ie. letting the pork sit with the rub in the fridge for several hours, cutting the roast into sections so the flavors distribute more evenly, and/or adding more seasoning).  I omitted the oregano (didn't seem like it would fit with Mexican seasonings) and subbed cumin.  I also used granulated garlic in place of fresh garlic.  I cooked it in the crock pot all day on high and it was juicy and tender (for some reason my crock pots don't cook well on low).  We shredded it and mixed the cooking juices in with the shredded meat (which did not make it saucy but helped to add flavor) and used it for burrito filling with lettuce, cheese, sour cream, and taco/green chili sauce.  It is a very versatile filling.  I look forward to freezing the leftovers for a quick-grab dinner when the baby comes!

This is very good! I put everything in the crockpot, cook on low for 6 hours, shred pork, then back in the crock for another 2 hours. I do not drain the chilies and use a whole package of spicy taco mix. I also add a can of tomatos w/chilies. I will be using the leftovers for enchiladas. Thanks so much for the great recipe that my DH gives a rave review!

This is AMAZING! It has quickly become a family fave. I leave out the salt, and use about 1/2 an envelope of taco seasoning. then throw all the ingredients in the slow cooker. When I get home from work I shred the pork and put it back in the juices for another hour or so. To DIE for! Thanks for the recipe!

Very nice recipe - I made a couple changes, partly based on what I had on hand.  I used 1 can green chiles and 1 can diced jalapenos, which added just a touch more heat, and added 1/2 tsp liquid smoke.  I cooked it for about 8 hours on low in the slow cooker, and it turned out great!  (And smelled so good the last few hours!)

This was delicious.  I made it in the crockpot so I could leave it throughout the day and just added some chicken broth.

This recipe made awesome pork tacos, and the next day we used the leftovers for enchiladas!  I put mine in the crockpot for 5 hours on high, then shredded it at the end and let it sit in the pot for about 20 minutes - I think this made it soak up the juices, which were very spicy because I used a package of "spicy" taco seasoning. Yum

5 stars for EASY, TASTE, VALUE, and VERSATILITY.  I put this in the crock pot, following the recipe exactly (other than the cooking method).  It tasted WONDERFUL.  I used a Boston Butt that I got on sale at Bloom for $.88/pound (yes, $.88!) We had it as taco meat, as enchiladas, as taco salad, and just by itself with some cilatro and diced tomato on top.  Spring for the fresh cilantro. . .it really bring out the flavor of this recipe.  Passing this on to everyone I know!  Thanks!

This was tremendous!  My whole family loved it.  I set the pork roast on foil, applied all the ingredients, wrapped tightly in foil, and cooked in the crock pot for 5 hours on high.  I think the trick is to make a ring of crumpled up foil to raise the roast off the bottom of the crock pot so that the heat surrounds the meat.  I added approx 1/8 to 1/4 cup of water to the bottom of the crock pot - not touching the wrapped roast - to supply moist heat.  My daughter commented when she came in from school - what's cooking, it smells like tacos.  The meat was so tender.  Used leftovers the next day for BBQ pork sandwiches.  Delicious!!

This perfumed the entire house and my family kept saying how wonderful it smelled.  It wasn't as highly flavored as I expected - I cooked it in foil in the slow cooker.  Next time I think I'll try it OUT of the foil in the cooker.  It tasted lovely, but a bit bland.  I'm going to roll it in corn tortillas and bake with enchilada sauce.

Yummy. I used only 1 can of chiles and half the chile powder as I didn't want it to be spicy for the kids. I noticed no where in the directions does it say what to do with the chiles so I just mixed it in with all the other ingredients. When it was cooked I shredded it and added the pan juices. I used it to fill flour tortillas with taco toppings. My husband used corn tortillas and topped with cilantro & onions. Tasty & so easy.

A family staple....I put the pork in the crock pot and let is cook on low for 6 hours and it pulls apart easily.  We add a little cayenne pepper to make it a little spicer.

We made this in the crockpot (so super easy) and it was DELICIOUS!  I doubled ALL the ingredients, except for the chili powder--we put 1.5 times the amount called for and then added 1.5 T of cumin.  Very flavorful without being unbearably spicy (I do like some spice!).  Shredded and then wrapped in a warm flour tortilla with all the toppings. . . so good--you have to try it!

This is absolutely the best pork shoulder recipe that I have ever tried.  I took my 5 pound pork shoulder, followed the directions for the dry rub, and then placed it in my slowcooker for for about 5 1/2 hours on high.  I checked my temp and then let it rest on the keep warm setting and it was the most tender, well seasoned pulled pork that i have made.  I did not use any braising liquid or anything, just let the heat and the park do its magic.

We used our pork of tacos for five hungry people, have had left over the next night for two and we still have a lot of meat left. 

I highly recommend trying this recipe.

This is an outstanding recipe....so delicious with mouth-watering flavor.  I followed the recipe exactly only adding 1/2 tsp of Penzeys Arizona Dreaming to the spices for the rub.  I also followed a couple of other reviewers' tips by placing slices of fresh jalapeno pepper on top of the roast.  I wrapped the roast in foil, placed in my slow cooker and cooked it all night.  DELICIOUS!  The roast fell apart and was very moist and tasty.  I served with toppings of chopped tomatoes, chopped red onion, jarred verde salsa and chopped cilantro but it was delicious all by itself.  Thanks for sharing - definitely a keeper!

Made this in the crock pot on low and it was so tender and delicious.  The only deviation I made was more garlic, because I'm a garlic fiend.

It's Delicious! I made it with Pork Sirloin Roast in the CrockPot and turned out wonderful! Added to my recipe book. We don't like the Chilli Powder flavour so instead I used paprika and Cayenne Pepper. The rest I kept the same.

So, so very good I can't even tell you how wonderful these were. I had to forward on this recipe to other people at the party. I did add a can of chipotle peppers in adobo sauce to the mix before slathering on the pork. Gave it more dimension.

Can't wait to try this with a full roast - was cooking just for hubby tonight and had a huge boneless porkchop I had to use up.  So I thought I'd give your recipe a try - it was simply smashing!  Wrapped in foil and baked as directed, stopping at 2 1/2 hrs.  Removed meat from foil, sliced and put meat & juice in small saute pan to await his arrival.  He devoured - thanks so much for recipe.

Whole family loved this. I made it in the crock pot with about 1/2 cup water and a splash of vinegar. After several hours cooking, I shredded the meat in the crock pot and let it absorb the liquid. Great flavor!! Will make again I'm sure

Nix the salt and replace it with a packet of onion soup mix. I found that this has better flavor with cumin instead of oregano. One of the other reviewers suggested replacing one can of chilis with a can of chipotle peppers in adobo sauce - do it! The chili pepper may seem like a lot, but it works out just fine. I think I also added some garlic for more flavor. I took the advice of another reviewer by adding 1/4 cup of apple cider vinegar and a chicken bouillon cube (this was combined with water in my slow cooker). Throwing everything into a slow cooker makes this a simple dish to put together. This made some REALLY incredible pork. This was excellent in a corn tortilla with fresh cilantro (lettuce does not belong on tacos!).

Great recipe! I made this in the crock pot and tweaked it a little. I added about half a beer, 1/4 C apple cider vinegar, about 2 or 3 TBLs honey, and after a few hours of cooking, added more Chili powder and Cumin to taste. Added a little more salt too and some lime. Cooked 7 hours and was perfect!! So happy I tried this!

Excellent! I followed ther recipe, and it fed 2 families, plus leftovers, which have been devoured. We ate it with flour tortillas, lettuce, tomatoes, sour cream, and my homemade salsa. I  ate the pork on a tortillas with the leftover beans, and Mexican rice. My kids ate the leftovers  as is with Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce. This will put in my recipe box at home.

Made it in the crock pot.  Turned out really good but next time I will definitely double the sauce as others have suggested.  Made a great salad with fat free sour cream, salsa and cilantro.

The first time I made this I didn't have any green chilies on hand so I thought I'd use the juice of 1 orange instead.  The result was so delicious that we were really looking forward to the actual recipe.  I just finished cooking it and it's rather disappointing compared.  I'll keep making it with the orange juice instead!  Also, I have to roast it about 1 hour longer and I add the juices from the pan to the shredded pork for added flavour.

This was excellent. After mixing up the rub, I was terrified it was going to be too spicy for my kids but it turned out great. I will be using this recipe often. Thanks!!

I used less chili powder so it wouldn't be too spicy for my kids, increased the taco seasoning to one packet, didn't drain the chilies - too hard to do!, and skipped the salt because I think there is plenty in the taco seasoning. I also used my crock pot - after 5 hours on low I shredded the pork, removed the fat and returned the meat to the crock to simmer more. We had friends drop by unexpectedly and I offered them some pork tacos and they loved it too! Definitely a keeper!

It was pretty good.  I should find a good pico de gallo to go with it.  I put it on warmed corn tortillas with fresh tomatoes, cheese and guacamole.  My hubby liked his with sour cream.  I used roasted Hatch chilies (I'm from NM) instead of canned and found it pretty spicy.  Not sure what it's like with canned green chilies.

This is so delicious! I have made it a few times now and am about to make it again for my daughter's 9th birthday dinner request! I have made this in a foil bag (super easy clean up) and I made it once in the crock pot and it turned out great too! Fantastic recipe as is; no need to change a thing!

I use a can of Rotel instead of the green chilies.  I also like to cook this in the crock pot.  It makes the house smell so great!  I shred the pork and serve it with rice, black beans, lettuce, cheese, salsa, etc.  It's a favorite for sure!

I didn't want to go to the store, so I didn't have the green chilies or the taco envelope. Also, I rarely measure when I cook (but when I bake I do). I used lots of chili powder, tiny bit of garlic powder and onion powder, about 1 1/2 teaspoons cumin and about 1/4 teaspoon of white pepper. This was such a great idea; I don't like processed foods much, so I used this on a taco. Thank you-and if you have more seasoning ideas, post them!

This was delicious! I actually used pork tenderloin thinly sliced, marinated, then broiled because I didn't have a roast on hand. I'm sure either way it would have been delicious!

This was really good, and I will make it again with a couple changes.  I followed the recipe exactly (except cooked for 6 hours), but probably didn't seal the foil well enough.  A lot of the sauce/juice came out onto the sheet pan, and I think the meat lost some flavor because of it.  It was still completely tender and very tasty.  Served on warmed corn tortillas with onions, cilantro and salsa.  Next time I might try the crock pot, or really seal the foil for roasting in the oven.  Hubby and I loved it; my daughter made a sandwich out of it with mayo and A1 on sliced sourdough bread and said it was great!

One word, LEGIT. This is exactly what I was looking for in a pulled pork recipe. I wanted to try it in the oven, but I threw it in the crockpot before work instead and it was perfect by the time I got home. Next time I'll cook it in the oven, and I'll try it with a beef roast. I have a feeling you can't go wrong with this one. AWESOME

I was surprised I hadn't reviewed this yet.  I have used this recipe over and over again.  I have made it exactly and have since made my own changes.  Less chili powder, whole package taco seasoning, palmful of cumin/peppercorn blend (not ground).    I have used this for (flour and corn tortilla) tacos, pork chili, chimichangas, taco salad and my son uses it for sandwiches.    I do use my crock pot, but after shredding the meat I put it in a large pot with all juices and simmer until juices are more concentrated.  Get RAVES from family/friends!!  Ironically, my name begins with letter D!!  Thank you, Dee!!
Edit:  i've started making my own taco seasoning, so i no longer use the seasoning packets.  i like that i can control the spices and spiciness.  we like our food spicy!!  this enables me to do without the chili powder, oregano and garlic (as my seasoning has those ingredients already in it).  Still spectacular!!

I made this recipe yesterday and it was delicious! I did make it in the slow cooker and I added some cumin to the seasonings. Since I was going to be at school all day and was worried about it drying out, I did add just about 1/2c of water to the pot. When I came home, it was perfect! Just shredded right in the pot and then soaked up all that juice. YUM!

This was delicious.  Made it in the crockpot and varied it only slightly.  The Pork Roast was 5lbs after trimming fat, so added a little extra of most of the spices.  E.g., doubled the taco seasoning and garlic (but halved the chili powder - not so fond of that flavor).  Was concerned it needed liquid, so added 1/4C water and to address the need for more spice, added 1/3C Pace Picante Sauce.  The meat was very flavorful, as was the sauce.  This would be an excellent way to make a delicious meal out of a cheap cut of meat.  But be sure to trim all visible fat or you will have to skim it later.  This is definitely a keeper!

Divine.  I add the entire packet of taco seasoning and roast for 7 hours.  I serve it with warmed tortillas and pico de gallo. My entire family loves it.  My mother made this in her crock pot and my kids didn't like it near as well as oven roasted.

This is a delicious recipe. I used a pork loin. I used 1/2 tsp cumin and 1/2 tsp coriander instead of taco seasoning, and "hot" diced green chiles since we like spicy food, and only 1 tsp salt. I rubbed it all over the loin, placed it in a crock pot on low for about 7 hrs, shredded it and put it back in the juice for a few minutes.  Excellent for tacos  or in buns.  Great flavor.

My sister and I made this for our family dinner while we were camping on the coast last weekend.  Put a pork shoulder roast in the crockpot, cooked for 7 hrs, was falling off the bone and super easy to shred.  The seasonings were great (will add a little more next time), served w/corn tortillas, lime, cabbage, salsa and sour cream.  Yum, will definitely make this again!  Super easy dinner to make when traveling in the RV.

Waaay too much chili powder. That taste overpowered everything. Not sure why this has gotten such sensational reviews. I followed the recipe exactly, but my husband wouldn't even eat leftovers.

This tasted great and was very easy!  I am all about easy.  I had to cook mine in the oven for 6 hours, but I was expecting that based on other comments.  Will make this again.  Thank you for sharing.

stead of green chilies i used 1 4 oz can of """hot" salsa verde""" & a cup or so of extra water, and instead of taco seasoning, i used stuff from my cabinet: cumin, cayenne, chili powder, salt & pepper.   cooked it for 8 hours in crockpot on low - made fantastic shredded tacos.   i eat low-carb & i just had mine w/ sliced avacado and a little cheese & it was awesome.

Made this in a covered roasting pan  with onions, peppers, and cilantro (towards the end).  My kids asked me to make it again. This is convenient and hearty.  Thanks.

This was great!  I made a few changes and I only had a 2 lb roast.  I didn't have taco seasoning, but I used about a tbsp of chili powder, and half a tbsp of cumin and cayenne pepper and garlic salt.  I used fresh garlic, fresh Hatch green chilis, and topped the meat off with about 3 oz of Tapatio sauce.  I made it in the crock pot, high for an hour and low for another 3 hours.  "Dee's" (these) Tacos are yummy! :)

Oh my!  This is so good.  I used a bone in shoulder but roast that was almost 8lbs.  I kind of eyeballed the ingredients for the rub but didn't really add more than the original recipe. I put the rub on and then let the roast sit in the fridge for about 12 hours.  Put it in the crock pot on high and cooked for another 12.  Perfectly moist and shredded easily.   We will be adding this to the family cookbook.

Wow this was tasty! Such a nice change from chicken tacos. I used a pork loin roast cuz that's what I had, and I reduced the recipe because there are only three of us. The only changes I made were based on other reviews, so I added a little stock, some cumin and some tomato paste. So good! I wrapped my roast in foil, then placed it in a covered clay pot to bake. Perfection on a corn tortilla. Yummmmmmmmmyyyyy!

I would have to agree it fantastic!! I made it with a whole packet of taco seasoning, added cumin (gotta have cumin in Mexican food to me) and put a large can of diced green chiles undrained in there. I also added a half a can of beef broth as per a previous recommendation.  Next time though, I will use the whole can as it was slightly dry. I also used a chuck roast, as I'm a beef taco lover, and slow cooked it all day while I was at work.  It was fantastic!! Spicy and yummy!!!  I used the leftovers next morning for breakfast tacos...mmmm!!  Will for sure make again.

To avoid using foil I wrapped the shoulder in banana leaves purchased at most Asian or Hispanic markets.  It maintained moisture extremely well.

I also threw this in the slow cooker (since its a perfect way to make succulent meats).I didn't add any liquid and there was just the right amount of juice to add back into to the pork once I shredded it. I used a 3 lb. roast so only used 1 can of green chilies. I only had a couple of tbsp of chili powder and no taco seasoning so I improvised by throwing in a bunch of stuff I had on hand: the chili powder, cumin,paprika,seasoning salt,chipotle powder,oregano and even a pinch of cloves and of course plenty of minced garlic. Sorry, I don't know the exact amounts, I rarely measure anything - just add what I think is right, but it was a lot of spice if that's any help.(probably equivilent to a package & a half of taco seasoning though.) I also added a minced onion. Since I got late starting it I cooked it on high for about 5 hrs. I combined this recipe with another on this site (Mexican Style Shredded Pork) and served it on top of rice and black beans (with lime juice and cilantro stirred in after it was cooked). It turned out GREAT...just the right amount of spiciness with a lot of flavor.  Will definitely be making this many, many times! It was so easy AND inexpensive. Thanks for sharing.

OK, but a little bland for me. Don't know what I did wrong but I also had a little prolem shredding the meat. It was not as tender as I thought it would be. Will try again in the crock pot with more seasoning.

This wasn't bad but didn't find that it was Great!!  Sorry to say that I've had better.  I made this into burittos and found that the pork flavor alone was nothing to write home about (needed some umph).  What did make my burittos better was the addition of sour cream, guacamole, refried beans, etc.  Without these additions it would be bland. Only with more spice/modification would I make this Roast again.

This was great!!!  My husband & very picky daughter both loved this recipe.  I didn't have a roast on hand so I used pork shoulder blade steaks.  I wouldn't change one thing on this recipe.  Yum Yum!!!

I put the green chilies, the spices, some lime juice, and garlic cloves in my Ninja Blender to make a paste.  I put it on the roast and wrapped it in foil.  I agree with others that the cooking time is off. My roast was "cooked" but it would not shred.  If I were to make this again, I would either cook it for another 1-2 hours or put it in the crockpot.

Absolutely loved this recipe but based on others' comments, I modified it a bit. I doubled all the spices and canned chilies except for the chili powder. I suggest draining the excess liquid prior to pulling apart with a fork to make it less greasy. Was a great success in a slow cooker. Served on top of hot tortillas with avocado slices, chopped tomatoes, and whole leaves of romaine lettuce.

The chili powder overpowers all the other ingredients making it a pretty boring, single flavor meat. As a taco filling it is just ok once you add all the other toppings, but it is definitely not anything special. Straight up taco spices (without all the extra chili powder) would probably be better. I won't be making it again.

OK, 5 stars for giving me a good idea for leftovers! I already had over 2 lbs of juicy lightly seasoned slow-cooker shredded pork leftover in the fridge when I can came across this recipe using green chilis and oregano. Bingo...Mexican night! I warmed the shredded pork in the crockpot with 8oz green chilis, some chicken broth to moisten and 2tsp cumin and 1tsp oregano (set on low 6 hrs). Added fresh cilantro before serving with warm tortillas and pico de gallo. Melt in your mouth delicious! I can't wait to try the original recipe as-is next time we do pork shoulder.

I have finally found the perfect pork recipe for tacos. I did make this in a slow cooker and added some chicken broth to keep the meat moist. The spices are spot on. Burritos, tacos or anything else this is the perfect recipe.

Fantastic pork recipe. Easy week day meal. I use this in the slow cooker for taco meat.  My kids (both under 5) love it.  Use mild green chilis and about half of the chili powder or it would be too hot for the kids.  Still tasted great!

Love this recipe! I cook my meat in the crockpot on low for several hours until done and falls apart, the spices in this recipe are so amazing! Tastes like what you pay several bucks for at chipotle or qdoba.

I have this cooking in my crock pot as I write this. I make this at least once a month. I follow the recipe as is and it is the best recipe on here. Let it cook all night and its ready to be kept on the warm setting by the morning. Thank you so much for a recipe I use so often.

This took forever to cook and still was not as tender as it should've been...I'm guessing a bad cut of meat.  We ended up going out to a taco shop since cooked for 6 hours and still not able to shred the meat.  The flavor was ok as I put it in the crockpot the next day it did finally tender up.

Yummy. Made in a crockpot on low for about 7 hours. Doubled the recipe for the seasoning, then added half a beer, a minced up jalapeno, and some lime.

my husband made this on the crockpot... he cooked it on low for several hours and then turned down to keep warm for the rest of the day.  We had it on soft taco shells with lettuce, avocado and pico de gallo, I took the rest for lunch the next day and put it on a salad... It was OUTFREAKINSTANDING!!

The roast smelled heavenly while cooking, but lacked the right seasoning.  Perhaps a touch of sugar.  The meat swam in grease.  If I make bulk pork roast for tacos, I will season the meat with  garlic salt, pepper, and bay leaves.

This recipe is a favorite in our house. It can get a bit salty, so when I remember I omit at least 1/2 teaspoon of the salt. Otherwise, LOVE this! I love to turn the leftovers into enchiladas.

Oh. My. God.  I've been looking for a recipe for pork roast for tacos, a la Carnitas, and this one worked great.  I went with a nearly five pound pork shoulder roast that was on sale.  Of course, I fiddled with the recipe like everybody else... I started by browning the roast in a Dutch oven, then I added 8-9 cloves of garlic, and covered the whole thing with a pile of chili powder, oregano, sage, chili flakes, pepper, salt, cumin, and a can salsa fresca and jalapenos.  Stuck it in the oven for four hours, then shredded it a little and added a pile of chopped onion and more garlic cloves, along with some assorted hot sauce and a good splash of cider vinegar.  Back into the oven for another hour or two. A couple of limes squeezed into it at the end and - Perfection.

Very good!  I found it took 5 hours in oven at 300 and an additional 2 hours on high in crockpot...next time I will probably just do in crockpot for 8-9 hours on low. A real hit!  My hubby requested tacos for his birthday dinner and he LOVED it!  Thank you!

I didn't have any tortillas but can't wait to try this on a warm corn tortilla, thanks for sharing!!

We always have ground beef tacos at home, then we go out and if we happen to hit a Mexican restaurant, we usually order pork tacos because they're fantastic. So we decided to try something different at home and make some shredded Mexican pork.  Lucky for us we found a 7lb pork butt on sale at the store.  The meat was fantastic and there was plenty for leftovers. Vacuum sealed and froze em, can't wait to have it again!!

I've never slow roasted pork before, always did 1h at a higher temp. Tried this recipe and there was a HUGE difference in the texture of the meat. It was literally melt-in-your-mouth! Will be making this again!

Maybe I just got a bad piece of pork shoulder roast, but the meat was REALLY oily and the tacos dripped with some neon orange grease...not to appetizing. The meat was also not very flavorful. I am surprised because so many people gave this recipe high ratings. Maybe I did something wrong?

Wasn't quite spicy enough for us. I cooked in the slow cooker, left the juices from the can of chili's and added a cup of jalapeno juice. The chili powder was really overpowering so next time I will use less of it and more taco seasoning and maybe cumin. It was so tender and juicy!! I cooked it on low for 8 hours then shredded the pork, put it back in the juices and then sliced a green bell pepper and onion and put it over the top on warm until my hubby got home. We had them with fresh tortillas and I am sure tomorrow after the leftovers soak in the juice they will be even better! Thanks for the recipe!

This an amazingly simple recipe and it is fantastic! I make home made taco seasoning and I did add more than the recipe called for, but the pork is soooo tender and falls apart with a fork. I am going to try this with a beef roast.

This was really good! I used pork shoulder that was a little more than 4 pounds and cooked it on 300 degrees for about 6 hours.     After reading through comments I decided to save the juice from the green chili cans. I saved half of the juice and mixed it with a little bit of water and placed it in the foil with the pork. I mixed the rest of the leftover juice with the pork after it was done roasting and shredded too.     I also used more taco seasoning than the recipe asked for before it went into the oven. (Almost the whole packet) I added some more taco seasoning to the shredded pork along with some salt, pepper, and beef bouillon. The real trick is to mix the shredded pork with the juices that it cooked in to make it flavorful and keep it moist.    I served it in tacos and we ate it for days on tostadas and salads. I will definitely make it again.

I placed this in the slow cooker for 6 hours pulled it out and shredded it.  I then added 1/2 cup water and sliced a red onion on top and cooked on high for an additional hour.  We then topped it with fresh quacamole and cheese and some lettuce  This turned out excellent.  My 5 year old and 6 year old loved it, it is the only way they have eaten lettuce without throwing up a fit.  I couldn't say anything more.  Superb

Made this in the crockpot. Didn't have any taco seasoning, so used the Taco Seasoning recipe from this site. So good! I thought it would be too spicy for the kids, but even my 9 month old gobbled it up when I put it in a tortilla with some cheese.

This was really good!  I used a pork loin roast instead and it worked great.  I found it a little salty.  I would leave out the salt, I think that the taco seasoning was enough.

Yum! I used the crock pot and pork chops. I cooked it 7-8 hours on high befor it was falling apart. I also added a diced onion. The peppers and onion disolved after the long cooking time and the flavors were still there. It was sooooo good! This is the best recipe I have gotten off of this site.

I finally got the "Make this again" stamp of approval from my boyfriend on this recipe!  We loved it.  It was so good.  I followed the recipe to a T, except that I added about 1/2 a minced onion to the paste and did not drain the chilies, as another user suggested.  I served with a homemade Pico de Gallo and store bought fresh corn tortillas, warmed in a pan.  I will definetly be making this again, and it was so easy!

This had an excellent flavor but the meat did not fall apart. I think it's because I used a pork sirloin roast which is a leaner cut. I cooked it for the full 4 hours. So I just cut it into pieces with a knife and fork. Next time I'll have to use a fattier roast. But the seasonings are awesome and could be used with chicken as well.

This might be a review you need to skip, because I used a leftover pork roast (Pineapple Pork Roast from this site), added a can of rotel with lime juice, cumin, mexican oregano, garlic and paprika and baked for about an hour and a half.  It was moist and delicious.  I still had the juices and the pineapple from the previous recipe in with it.  YUM!

Like other reviewers, I used my CrockPot. Dumped everything in in the morning, and we were ready to roll when I got home from work! We served ours on Cinco de Mayo with mango salsa, guacamole, and a little sour cream. I got rave reviews! Definitely a regular in our rotation.

I live in a mexican household and i make this all the time! everyone loves it. We use the pork for tacos, tostadas, sopes, basically anything u can put pork in. I did have to increase cooking time by quite a bit. Id say it takes about 7hrs to fall appart easily. as far as ingredients i dont change anything.

Made this in my crock pot. It was wonderful.  I grew up in Arizona and we had real Mexican food there, this is the closest I have found.  All we use for tacos is onions and fresh cilantro. It even worked great as a taco salad.

This is so incredibly good, even my son loved it and he is decidedly not a fan of mexican food. I didn't have as big a roast as the recipe called for and I didn't have as much time to cook it so I halved the recipe for a 2 pound roast and roasted it in my convection oven on 325 for an hour and a half. I did wrap it in the foil like the recipe suggested. The roast was easy to pull apart with forks and VERY moist.

I made this in the crockpot, and it turned out great! For some reason, mine didn't get to the point that I could shred it, so I just sliced it up and let it simmer in the sauce. It was excellent, and made so much that I can froze half for another meal! I served it with homemade, warm tortillas, pinto beans and salad.

This is unbelievably good! My husband - who doesn't like leftovers - REQUESTED that we keep eating this!! The only change I made was that after 2 1/2 hours of slow roasting in the over it still wasn't falling off the bone tender, so I just poured the juice that collected in the foil into a Dutch oven, added a can of beef broth and braised it over a slow heat for another hour. It was PERFECT!! Thank you for this great recipe.

Excellent! I used a packet of taco seasoning and omitted the extra salt. I did add the oregano and chili powder, but reduced the chili powder to about 2 tsps. Our guests didn't eat spicy. I rubbed/marinated all night, added the 2/3cup of water as the packet suggested and cooked on low for 9 1/2 hours. The pork was delicious!

Definitely delicious!  I was hurting for time, so I put my roast in the oven for a couple of hours (I made only 1lb of pork).  The rub worked wonders, but the pork wasn't as tender as I'd have liked it.  I recommend a slow cooker next time!

Great flavor but I cooked it for a little longer than recommended and it never did become fork-tender as promised. Next time I'll try it in the crock pot as many of the other reviewers had.

This was great!  I too used my crockpot for about 5+ hours.  The next day leftovers are almost better!  I will definately make this again, only next time I will add more taco seasoning and not quite so much chili powder.

I did this in the crock pot (high for 3 hours and low for 2).  Used the green chilies and about 1/2 cup of water to help it cook.  Shredded it up afterwards.  I didn't use a taco seasoning packet but made my own taco seasoning instead (TONS of freshly ground cumin, a little chili powder and a lot of garlic powder.  It was great!  We served it in corn tortillas with a little sour cream, avocado, cilantro and salsa!  Great healthy meal.

OMG!!! This was so delicious!! I cooked it in my crockpot while I was at work. I used a whole package of Taco Seasoning and I just sprinkled chili powder, garlic and the 2 cans green chilies. I cooked it on high for about an hour or so then turned it to low. My husband was home to do that part for me. :) The meat fell apart nicely and we ate them on corn taco shells heated in a pan with lettuce and cheese. It had great a spicy flavor!!

This had an off flavor to me, but that could have been from following other reviewers advice. I normally read a bunch of reviews before making a recipe to adjust to our tastes. I did it in the crockpot and it was extremely tender but the spices didn't seem to work together. If I were to try again I would not use any chili powder (I cut back per some advice), and use more taco seasoning and more oregano and I think add lime during cooking.

Super WOW.  I used an entire envelope of taco seasoning, 2 T of oil and minced fresh garlic instead of garlic powder. I left the meat in a crockpot for about 8 hours.  Very tender, but did not get mushy.

Seriously the best tacos.  I got a big roast and doubled the spices and used the leftover meat to make enchiladas the next night that were Off the HOOK! Even my 5 year old daughter ate it.  This is a must have recipe!!

This is so good and so easy.  I cooked this in the slow cooker and added a little water and it just shedded nicely.  I used flour tortillas and topped with a little cheese, and an onion cilantro mix.  Sour cream is also good on this.  I have made this twice now and it rocks!  Thank you Dee!

Excellent flavor.  I made it in the slow cooker and added about 1/2 cup beef stock to ensure tenderness.  Couldn't ask for more tender, more flavorful pork.

I prepared this in the crockpot for about 5 hours on high. The meat was tender and paired with pan roasted corn; it was awesome. I thought there was far too much chili powder flavor for the pork.

I would have given this a 2 but my husband liked it so I'll compromise and give it a 3.  It tasted good when I covered it up with other things so I couldn't taste it. Sorry, but I'm not going to save this in my recipe box.

Tried this recipe with a little "tweaking" and my Husband and I really enjoyed it.  I used a pork blade roast, bone-in and roasted it in my cast iron Dutch oven at 300 degrees for about 4 hours.
Along with the 2 cans of diced green chilies, which I did not drain, I added a can of diced jalepenos (we like SPICY) and also increased the minced garlic to about 2 TBL.  Served on flour tortillos with pepper jack cheese, salsa and fresh sliced jalepenos.  Terrific!

Super, I halved this and it was wonderful!  I did not have taco seasoning ---so I added extra garlic cloves, used whole peppers and pureed the mixture in the food processor.     I then rubbed it on my roast.

Fabulous. I put my pork in a crock pot on low for 8 hrs or so then shredded it up. So yummy.

I am amending my review.  When you read the recipe on here, it does say to include the green chilies.  However, when I changed the recipe to 4 servings and printed it out, somehow the green chilies got omitted even though they are listed in "ingredients."  This recipe works great in crock pot.

I made this dish for my husband's birthday party for about 20 people.  They loved it! I do not eat pork, but tasted the broth...and I added more cayenne since he likes it spicy.  I used pressure cooker, so cooking time was only 20-30 min!

I made this last week..excellent recipe. I did stick it in the crock as noted in other recipes. WHen i stuck it in the crock, I added chicken stock so the meat would be tender. Came out delicious! Served with rice pilaf. The next day I mixed the rice and meat  and reheated...TASTY!

If you like really spicy mexican, you will have to add some hotter peppers.  I cooked it in the crockpot, removed the meat, shredded it, and put it back in its broth.  It was delicious.

This was nice.  I cooked it in the slow cooker as others recommended, but I would recommend about 1/2 c of liquid.  Mine turned out pretty dry and not strong enough.  My husband and I love mexican food and the flavors in this needed to be enhanced more.  However, our friend loved it and said that the pork was the best part of the meal.  We served it with pico de gallo and slow home made refried beans.

So tasty.  I have used an Italian(rosemary,garlic,sage, evoo etc.) form of this recipe for years.  Last nite, I tried it in the crockpot and it was FANTASTIC!  I didn't have taco seasoning so I used 1/4c Southwest spice rub (nearly the same blend but I think tastier) and omitted the chili powder(it's in the rub).  I didn't drain the chiles and added a little oil to make a paste.  I rubbed on 3lb pork butt and put it in the crockpot.  No liquid needed - plenty of liquid by the end of cooking time.  I was a spaz with the cooking times.  I cooked on high for 2hrs and then wanted to sleep so I put it on low for 6hrs.  This cut of pork is idiot proof. I didn't trim visible fat from the pork and next time I think I will. Happy eating!

This was really good. Although, I might as well have been chewing on a old boot for how bad of quality my pork was. But, that's my own fault.  In other words, a well seasoned old boot. I sprinkled mine liberally with the seasonings and then wrapped it tight and let in sit overnight in the fridge. Then popped it in the oven the next morning and we ate it for lunch. If I were going to put this in the crock to cook I think I might add a half cup or so of salsa to give it a boost of flavor.

Oh my oh my!  This was GOOD!  I used a 2.67# loin roast and decreased the chilis to 1 can, but kept all of the other spice measurements the same.  Delicious.  It roasted for about 6 hours and was the most tender delicious meat I've eaten for a long time.  After shredding it, I mixed it well with the juices, and kept it in the oven on 300 until the rest of dinner was ready.  My daughter must have eaten 1/2 pound of it herself.  Served it in corn and/or flour tortillas with the usual taco fixings...but truly it tasted wonderful just plain on a corn tortilla.  The taste with the corn reminds me of tamales.  So, so good and so, so easy.  This would taste good with beef also, I think.  I too, like Charley's Mexican Beef from this site...but this might become my new favorite taco meat!

Tastes as good as from a favorite restaurant from home. I cook mine in a french oven (cast iron & enamel) I pre-heat to 450. Put roast in for 15 minutes at that temp and then reduce to 300 for balance of cooking time

This was good, but I'm hoping someone will post specific instructions for using a crockpot.  Do you have to add some liquid?  I decided to add a cup of chicken broth because I've never cooked anything dry in the crockpot.  It turned out good, but not great.  I'd be interested to try this again if I did it incorrectly in the crockpot.  I gave it five stars so as not to unfairly decrease the rating since I think I might have messed it up...as I made it, probably only 3.5 stars.  Thanks for the recipe.

My husband declared this as a repeater!  Like another reviewer, I put this in the crock pot on low for about 8 hours.  The meat just fell off the bone!  It was so yummy.  By the way, I just poured the green chilies on top of the roast.  I would recommend mixing it with the other parts.  Also, definitely use the juices if possible when serving.  So much of the flavor is in there.

I can't say thank you enough.  My husband has been ill and hasn't touched anything in weeks.  He couldn't not make sevenths - yes sevenths - fast enough.  He said we've ruined Taco Bell for him forever now.  He insists that we put this in a WEEKLY rotation.  Thanks so much for the great recipe!

Awesome!!  My mom hates pork. She came in starving after a 12 hour shift in ICU, went right over to the pan and tasted it. Her response: what is this, it tastes great! When I told her, she could believe it, and she ate 3 tacos!

WOW!! What a wonderful taco filling!!  I wasn’t really sure at first, but when I made up the tacos, man were they ever tasty!  My family raved all through dinner!  I diced a large tomato, ½ red onion and a little cilantro, and along with some cheddar cheese all a top a warm flour tortilla, well these tacos were just awesome!!  My hubby even added hot sauce to his, but I think their great as is!  All I can say is WOW!! Looking forward to our next Fiesta night!! Thanks for sharing!!

This had incredible flavor, and was so easy to make!  I am a wimp when it comes to spicyness, so I reduced the chili powder to 1/8 cup, and used only 1 can of chiles.  By the time I trimmed all the fat off the roast, I had only about 2 lbs. left(!), so I used only 1 tsp. salt, and included it in the rub (would do that again!).  Other than those changes, I left the other seasonings the same.  The 2nd time I made this, I realized I didn't have a packet of taco seasoning on hand, so I used "Taco Seasoning I" from this site (omitting the red pepper flakes), and used a pork tenderloin instead of pork shoulder (cooked it 3 1/2 hours).  It was great!  I served the pork with a rice and bean casserole, grilled vegetables, and corn tortillas.  What a great dinner!  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Boy, is this good!  The flavors really infused the meat!  I didn't need to "tweak" it at all after it roasted.  The only change I made was adding Tabasco to the rub.  I know I will make this again and again!

This is a great recipe for beef or pork. I also use liners in the crock pot to help with clean up.  I use all the Ingredients listed but I also put In 2-3 tsp of chicken bouillon.( +/- to your taste ) and cook it on high for 4-5 hours than on low for a couple more. It doesn’t over cook it but especially with the beef , it just falls apart . I have made this dish a lot. My wife’s family says it taste very similar to Birria.

I used a leftover pound of pork roast that I had and adjusted the ingredients accordingly and added a 1/2 cup water and let it simmer for about ten minutes. I made my own taco seasoning from the recipe on here, as it's very good as well, plus it's lower sodium than store bought.

Exceptional taste! I cooked it in a dutch oven for 5 hours and it was falling off the bone. I let it cool a bit, put on my rubber gloves and shredded with my fingers. I then put it back int he juices to soak up. I took the suggestions of a couple of the other reviews and added 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar and chopped onion. This will become one of my go-to recipes.

Great Pork! Added Smoked Spanish Paprika, and almost doubled the spice mix. Roasted in oven for 4 1/2 hours on F325. Added a smidge of Apple Cider Vinegar to give a nice tang. Fantastic in Flour & Corn Tortillas. Cilantro & minced Red Onion with fresh made pickled Habanero sauce. Satanically delicious!! I had a 6 LB pork shoulder. Great leftovers. Fantastic Summer recipe. Fall off the bone, melt in your mouth GOOD!

Mmm, so good!  I only had one can of chiles, so I used it along with some diced Serrano peppers.  Love the spice! This had really good flavor. I cooked it in the slow cooker, shredded the meat and put it back into the sauce to coat the meat with the juices. So good, thanks  for sharing!

First time making this recipe was for my daughters graduation party.   18# done in the oven, the other 14# done in the crock pot. The pork was used (with other meat options) for a taco/nacho bar.  I was asked for the recipe from a number of people so I would say it was an overall hit.  I only added cumin to the spices listed.

This was not as flavorful as I thought it would.  Will make it again and adjust the seasonings.  I did use the pork with the eastern barbecue sauce.

Made it with substitution of 1 can peppers in adobo sauce for one of the cans of green chiles and it was the rave of my taco party!  It was spicy Trying is slow cooker without modification (except adding a little beer) today.

Did the slower cooker like so many others.  Used it for pork tacos.  It was okay.  Had way too much left over though so ended up tossing it.  Not sure I'd repeat this one.

I followed the recipe, with the following changes. For the seasoning, I used less chili powder (just more than ? cup), added 1 tsp cumin, used 3 fresh garlic cloves minced, added about ½ can Rotel (drained), and added ½ orange bell pepper (diced real small). I oiled my cast iron pot, out the seasoned roast in, and added about ½ cup chicken stock around roast. Then I foiled the top of the pot real good, and 4 hours later I had a tender falling apart roast with lots of juices.

This recipe is so on the mark. I love it!  I’m making it again today. The only thing I do differently is bake it in a cast iron Dutch oven with the lid on instead of wrapping it in foil. Today I made another change bc I was following the wrong recipe ??????? I seared the meat before placing in the oven. Have this goes well ??

Very juicy and flavorful. We cooked ours on high for about 3 hours. The whole family loved it. They do not like spicy things. This had a lot of flavor without being very spicy. We used a 3.5 lb. pork tenderloin. I would recommend it on small soft taco shells.

This was really good, though I should have thawed the pork and trimmed it of fat before I cooked it. I cooked it in my slow cooker for about 10 hours. I first tried it at 8 hours and it wasn't tender enough so I broke it into pieces and kept going. 10 hours was a good amount of time, though I actually think it could have gone 11-12 for the larger hunks. Taste was great and it was moist.

I had higher hopes for this one. I think the chili powder just sort of takes over everything. I can taste the taco seasoning but overall this was one was just...not doing it for me. I left my pork roast in the oven for over 3.5 hours but it didn't fall apart. I didn't have time to leave it for 4 hours but I'm not sure an extra 20 minutes would have done much.

This tasted OK once it was finished but I had to cook it for two hours longer than the recipe said.   My roast was under 4 pounds and I had it in the oven at 300° as indicated.  I even used convection the last couple of hours and it still took that long.  In fact, my son brought two friends home for dinner and we had to punt and go Pick up some hamburger for our tacos because the pork was so far from being finished. Flavor was OK, but  we did not think it was as outstanding as other reviews have indicated.

I loved this!  It wasn't spicy, which was perfect for my young son.  We used as filling for tacos and then the next day my husband ate it as a filling for a sandwich.  I found myself just eating it plain because it was so good, but if your looking for something with heat, this isn't it.  My three year old absolutely loved these!

After trying many pork taco recipes - this is the winner for our family.    Wonderful infused flavor, ingredients I have on hand and simple - love it!   We make a big pork shoulder and freeze the extra for easy meals during a busy week.   I do not add the cinnamon, I add garlic cloves instead of powder and I double my spices.    A winner!

Incredible. I didn't have time to watch a roast, so I cooked a boneless pork loin all day in slow cooker with nothing but water. Removed, shredded, & put meat in pot, added some of the water I cooked it in for moisture, then added other ingredients as listed. Changed nothing. Best tacos I've ever made. Served on large crunchy corn tacos with pico, salsa, & sour cream. Had made a 4# loin, so leftovers went into an enchilada casserole...rolled up in soft tortillas with cheese, pico, & enchilada sauce on top. Baked at 350. A+ recipe--thank you!

I used thick cut pork chops and added a bit of cumin, shredded when done.  Made corn tortillas and a sauce (mayo, sour cream, hot sauce, lime juice, chile powder, salt), topped with shredded cheese and hot sauce.  These were the best pork tacos I've had!

This was a hit with the whole family.  I even shared with a coworker and she loved it just as much.  I subbed chili powder for full packet of taco seasoning.

I have made this recipe more than dozen times and my family still keeps requesting it. I used a pork shoulder roast or whatever else I could find on sale. Just be careful not to pick a lean roast. It needs the fat for extra flavor & moisture. I do use Bill Echol's taco seasoning from this site & I like it with 12-16 oz of green chilies. I try to cook it in the crock pot at least 7 hrs-before I leave for work in the morning.

This is my go to pulled pork recipe. I make a bottle of "Taco Seasoning I" here on AllRecipes to keep on hand for this. Mix together all the ingredients, pot it in the slow cooker, set it on high and forget it. I often prepare this before bedtime and let it cook to perfection over night. Shred it in the morning. Package it up for several days worth of meals (tacos, burritos, enchiladas, add a little BBQ sauce for sandwiches, etc). 
Simple, easy, tender and delicious every time.

This was really good.  Due to my schedule, I wanted to make this during the weekday so I put it in the crock pot.  I'm sure I missed some lovely texture from cooking this in the oven, but the crock pot worked great.  I also have a small family and don't need tons of leftovers, so I made a half batch of this by buying a full size pork roast and cutting in half.  Since I was cooking in the crock pot, I didn't drain the chilies, but I may next time because it was plenty wet just from the juice of the pork.  My dish needed a little more salt than called for but that is probably due to the cooking method and easily fixed by salting to taste before serving.  The flavor was really great and my husband and kids all loved it, but I prefer a little more spice.  If you like spicy food, maybe add a little kick to it after shredding to your taste.  If you do the crock pot method and you have a little time after cooking, I would suggest throwing the shredded pork in a hot cast iron skillet to give it some crispy bits.  This is my new favorite pork taco meat recipe!

Amazing.  I had a smaller (about 1.5 lb) shoulder roast.  Coated it with the recipe's spices (I did not reduce the seasonings despite the amount of meat I had), and put in the slow cooker overnight for 10 hours.  The meat was absolutely delicious.  Made carnitas with homemade corn tortillas, a spicy Mexican cabbage slaw, a bit of cheddar-jack cheese and a drissle of salsa.  Served my own Mexican inspired rice dish on the side that I just winged.  Holy cow, these were the best pork tacos I've ever had.

I am making this for the 3rd time and I can honestly say its the best recipe I've ever gotten off this site. I think about it all the time! There isn't a thing I would change about it. I make it in the crockpot because its so much easier. Feeding a few people tonight with it. I'm sure they will love it as well.

Made this several times and it's always great. We use it in tacos and sandwiches.  Whatever you do, don't under-cook because you will not be able to shred the meat. Vacuum-packed 2- to 3-pound boneless pork shoulder roasts are perfect for this.  Remove the netting, apply the chilie rub, and then double-wrap the meat in heavy duty foil.  We let the meat sit for a half hour before unwrapping, and the meat literally falls apart.

Made this in the crock pot and it turned out great.  Reminded me of the shredded pork you get in burritos at mexican burritos restaurants.  Froze some and used it later in enchiladas which were great too.

I really love this dish! If you want a little extra kick spice wise try using a can of chipotle peppers. Mmmm mucho calinte!! I used these peppers instead of the jalapeno and it was super spicy, just the way we love it!! Thanks for the great recipe Dee!

This was a great recipe! We recently bought a hog and I had no idea what to do with a pork shoulder roast so I searched it on your site and found this. Delicious! It took a little longer to cook till tender(probably 4 hours) but worth the wait. All of my kids loved it and they are pretty picky! I didn't have enough chili powder so I added a little extra taco seasoning and it was great. I will definitely make this again.

I liked it alot...i added a red onion & red pepper flake to the bottom of the crock pot along with ingredients. It took about four hours on high but i didnt want it to cook too much that i couldnt slice it. I got my cast iron skillet and fried up the chunks i cut off about 1/2 inch or so. I used just vegetable oil and a skillet!

Delicious!  Tastes like a restaurant taco!  So easy and good!  I also wrapped mine tightly in foil as others mentioned after putting rub all over meat and left it in my fridge overnight to marinade.  I stuck it in the crock pot on low for about 7 hours with the foil still on and took it out and let it rest before shredding the meat.  Be careful as the juice will come out of the foil before you take it out of the crock pot, I held mine with tongs and let the juice come out into the crock pot so I could just add the meat back in after shredding with the juice.  Made guacamole and also caramelized some onions and red bell peppers in a pan to serve in the corn tortilla.  Thanks for an easy and delicious recipe!

This is a great dish for a crowd or to eat off of for several nights.  The pork is not spicy, however--just flavorful.  I have cooked it in foil in a roaster and it turned out beautifully, but I like the ease of preparing it in the crockpot (omit foil--cook on high for 5-6 hours).  I cook it exactly as directed--delicious and crowd pleasing!

This recipe was right up my alley because I love green chiles.  I used a pork tenderloin, and it came out moist, tender, and full of so much flavor.
Plus, this recipe is so easy with very little work required.  We ate these in soft tortillas, and it was a delicious dinner.

My fiancee says these were the best pork tacos he's ever had. Although, I either use a slow cooker for smaller batches or a dutch oven on low for 6-8 hrs. I use bone in roast (who doesn't love a little more flavor) and leave the shredded meat in, turn up the heat to thicken the sauce. Delicious!

I didn't follow the recipe because I had some pork that had already been cooked in the slow cooker for pulled pork sandwiches. I put all the ingredients for this recipe in a skillet and heated the meat through. This made some great tacos!!! I uesd soft flour tortillas for my tacos.

Delicious.  I think my family would like a bit more spice, but made delicious tacos.  We topped with sour cream, pico de gallo, lettuce & cheese.  My husband added mango peach salsa to his.  Next time I might add a bit of cayenne to kick up the heat.  My 16 year old son actually put this together & we cooked it in the crockpot on low for about 6 hours.

Excellent and so easy to make.  Don't drain the green chillis.  If you don't have any taco seasoning mix (prepared ones have MSG), add another 1/2 tsp. of salt.  Wrap in foil carefully and put on something (cookie sheet with raised sides, etc.) to catch spills.

I like this recipe a lot. I made it in the crockpot as one of the other reviewers suggested and it wasn't "falling apart" moist like the original recipe said. I also thought that the flavor wasn't as strong as I hoped it would be. In the future I will probably try putting it in the oven and using cumin in the seasoning to give it an extra kick. Otherwise it is a great recipe. I used it for taco salad the next day with tortilla chips, lettuce, tomato, onion, cheese, sour cream, salsa, and western dressing....yum!!!

This is an awesome roast.  We loved it!  Not only did I make tacos with it, I also made burritos with it and added some mexican rice to the burritos, delicious that way.  I also ate it as a main dish with rice on the side.

This is very good and easy to make.  Out of 23 grandchildren and 8 kids and spouses, they couldn't get enough.  Don't be afraid it will be too hot.  I thought it would be, but it was perfect!  Trying it in a crock pot on our next camp out.

This was a huge hit at my son's first birthday party!  I followed the roasting directions exactly, although I used half commercial chile powder and half ancho chile powder.  I retained the cooking juices for moisture.

I made this with leftover crown pork roast and kept all the named ingredients with the addition of a diced onion that I sauteed with the cubed meat and some chicken broth and liquid smoke. I then added the other ingredients and simmered until the meat was cooked down and had absorbed the liquid and flavors. It was served on warmed whole wheat tortillas with sour cream and quesadilla cheese.

This was just okay. I followed the recipe but found the results to be less flavorful than I expected.   I ended up adding more cumin, chili powder, oregano, a pinch of salt and some salsa after shredding the pork.

These were the BEST taco's I have ever had and I eat Mexican every chance I can!!!!I cooked the roast in the oven as the instructions stated, and did not have 2 cans of chili's but the flavor was still amazing!!! Besides only using 1 can of chili's, the other change I made was once the meat was shredded, I did toss some taco seasoning in with the meat and and them simmered the meat a little with some water (would have used a good Mexican bear but was out) and the flavor was outstanding. Am making this again today for my family only 2 roasts this time so we have some leftovers!! YUMMMM!!

This pork was fantastic.  I used a little under 3lbs of pork tenderloin so just cut down the chili powder a bit.  Cooked at 300 in oven for 4 hours.  Absolutely delicious!  Best pulled pork I have made.

5 stars & 2 thumbs up!  This was awsome.  I took the advice of others and made it in the crock pot on high for 6 1/2 hrs.  I had both corn and flour tortillas.  Flour was the best for blending the flavors.  The corn was good but almost over powered the flavors of the other ingredients.  The only changes I made was added more taco seasoning and added garlic powder.  I will definately make this again.

WOW!  This is great stuff.  I used a crockpot so that I could put it in before work and have it done after.  I added 2 c water to my crock with 2 chicken bouillon cubes as well as a couple T of apple cider vinegar.  I added cumin as one reviewer did.  It was the best pork taco I ever had!  Thanks so much for the recipe.

Husband thought this was the most tender meat ever!  I did cook it in my crock pot on high for 5 hours as I got a late start.  Took the advice of a previous reviewer and added 1/2 cup cider vinegar and 1/2 cup of beer.  I used a 3 lb. pork sirloin as it was smaller than the 6 lb shoulder roast the market had.

Yeah.. I got a smaller size Roast since its just me and my kids and didnt cut the chili pepper down. Im not a big chili pepper fan at all. Of course it was too much for the taste buds for me and my kids..Boy did I improvise...I let the roast set over night. I then sprayed the seasoning off with water. Broke it up in a skillet, added 1/4 cup of water, ketchup and thick and spicy barbeque sauce to taste. Some garlic salt and rotel... I created a new dish.. almost like a slow cooked pulled pork... BIG HIT.. Great Flavor... Next time ill just put it all in a slow cooker and drop the chili powder down based on personal taste... Try it... you will be shocked...

This turned out alright. I used a 3 lb boneless pork sirloin roast and cooked in the crockpot on low for 8 hours. It was easy to shred, but was a little dry. I added some lime juice at the end, but it didn't help much. Next time I will add a little water or lime juice a the beginning and maybe only cook for 6-7 hours. I just used a little sprinkling of salt, it doesn't need much. This makes a huge batch!

Very good.  I made it exactly as the recipe calls and baked it in the oven.  Sounds like many reviewers put it in the crockpot but I like it slow roasted in the oven.  Next time I may use a dash less chili powder and maybe an extra can of green chilis.

These ROCKED! The only thing I did different was rub down a whole pork tenderloin with the rub. I did not change a thing. Next, I wrapped it in foil and baked at 300 in the over for a few hours. Afterwards, serve on warm tortillias with pico, quacamole, and some squeezed lime.

I love to cook so when I read this recipe I was very excited. I did everything the same as far as cooking the meat, but I used pork tenderloin and didn't use the prepackaged taco seasoning. I added cajun spices instead. The meat came out very tender after 4 hours in the oven. I will definitely make this again, but will make more adjustments.

Would make this again! I added a little more salt. I would probably omit the taco seasonings as well...didnt seem to add much flavor anyway. 1 tsp for 4 lbs of meat doesnt seem to do much. I also used cumin instead of the oregano. I served it with the pico de galo recipe on this site. Very easy dish to make.

I made this is the crockpot (5 hours on low) and it was fantastic.  A little hot for my family, so I'll probably cut the green chilis in half the next time I make it, but great in every other way.  I froze half - can't wait to see how it reheats!  I'm so happy to have an alternative to slowcooker chicken tacos.

Yummy!  I made this in the oven as directed except I halved the chili powder.  It was wonderful.  My entire family loved it.  I will try in the crock pot next time since I accidently bought a pork sirloin roast instead of a shoulder roast.  I am hoping the crock pot will make it more moist.

the only change i made to this was in blending green jalepeno peppers, instead of green chilies, with the rest of the ingredients, and then rubbing the pork. i cooked it in the oven at 300° for 4 hours. delish

This is very tasty!  Very tender meat; great for tacos.  I also made this with some pre-soaked dry beans on top; just a 1/2 cup to add more flavor to the tacos when done.  Awesome recipe!

This recipe is amazing!  I used less chili powder, and didn't drain the chilies.  After pulling the pork, I removed the bones from the pan, put the pulled pork in the juices and re-baked for 30 minutes.  My family said it was the best tacos they've ever had!

This is great, I use the crockpot method and for the seasoning, you just have to measure it out according to your taste. If you follow the recipe it might be a bit bland.  I served this with Mexican Seven Layer Dip and homemade Salsa Verdes.

This is a great recipe!  Something different to do with pork!  I made it exactly like the recipe instructed and the meat just fell apart. We put them on corn shells with all the fixings (tabasco would be good on them).  Thanks!

Incredible.  I have struggled to find a recipe that we loved for pork roast.  I bought a 2lb boneless and used this recipe by 1/2.  My whole family loved it.  I did cook it in the crock pot over night (about 8 hrs). I will use this again and again.......I'll say it again, "loved it!!!!!"

This was good in some corn tortillas with avocado and tomato slices and sour cream.  Not as spicy/flavorful as I expected from the description, but still good.

My family loved this and my kids do not usually ever eat pork.  Excellent combination of flavors--I made it in a slow cooker because of time constraints and it came out just terrific.  Flavorful, tender, juicy, and it is great for tacos or any other Mexican wraps.  One of our new favorites--thanks for sharing it!

This was awesome & super easy!  I didn't take the time to drain the chilies & I used fresh garlic.  I put together before work (took about 10 min with clean up) and put it in the slow cooker on low for 10 hrs, then warm till I got home & everyone was ready to eat.  Next time I might add cayan to give a little extra kick, but even still, it was a favorite with everyone!  Thanks a ton!

Very tasty and easy to put together! I made a 2lb. pork shoulder roast in my crockpot for 5 1/2 hours. I doubled the garlic and taco seasoning, halved the other ingredients.  Meat shredded easily!

I loved this recipe.  I didn't have a pork roast so I had to use a london broil.  It was AMAZING!  I added a little adobo seasoning at the end but YUMMY.  I will make this again and again.  A little cilantro, tomato and onion...perfecto!!

Very good...I followed instructions exactly, and it had great flavor! The only thing was that mine didn't shred very easily, so we kind of chopped it up instead. But it was very juicy and I would highly recommend this recipe. I plan on using what is left to make enchiladas tomorrow!

I made this in the pressure cooker. Followed the ingredients exactly and added half a bottle of beer for liquid. 40 minutes in the pressure cooker…and dinner is made. So good!  The cook enjoyed the other half of the beer while dinner was cooking.

I thought this was ok, but it needed something different. when I cooked it, it took alot longer to cook and didn't fall apart well. I ended up cooking it again the next night in its own juices and trying it again. It turned out better.

Made following recipe exactly with one exception. Did not drain green chile. Paste was easier to apply. Baked approx. 6 hrs. Drained juice and used as base for flavoring from scratch dried pinto beans. Outstanding flavor. Am sending to all my friends.

This was tasty!  I put a bit of olive oil in the paste so it would spread easier.  I didn't think the chili powder was over powering personally.  I cooked mine for approx 6 hours and it still wasn't easy to shred with forks.  Overall I was pleased though.  Thanks!

I thought this was VERY good.  Served on soft corn torillas with diced white onion, chopped cilantro, fresh lime juice and Mild Pico Pica sauce.  I would definitly make again!

I used country style boneless pork ribs in place of the shoulder roast.  Didn't drain the green chilies, and instead of the prepared taco seasoning (which usually contains MSG) I substituted a dash of garlic salt and 1/2 tsp. of cumin.  Cooked in the crockpot on low for about 10 hours, and the result was delicious!  Top with diced onion, cilantro, and a squeeze of lime juice for an authentic Mexican-style carnitas taco.

Great recipe - would make again. Reading all the reviews on how long this took to cook I put all the ingredients in a crock pot and cooked on slow for 8 hours.  It was delicious.  Would add more chilli powder and taco seasoning next time.

Yum! This was my second time using this recipe and we really loved it. The first time I made it according to the directions and found the meat to be a little dry. This time I rubbed the (frozen) pork roast down with the chilies and herbs and threw it in the slow cooker. Added a can of beer and let it cook on low for 8 hours. Shredded, served in taco shells with plain yogurt, lettuce, and tomato. My husband *raved*. Thanks so much for this easy, delicious recipe. Thanks :)

This was really, really good.  It did take much longer (5 hours) for the pork to cook in the oven and my roast was only 2 1/2 pounds.  I added extra cayenne pepper and some cumin.  After shredding the pork I fried in white corn tortilla shells, was awesome!

I really liked this recipe but I did adjust a few things to suit what I had on hand. I used cumin and fresh garlic instead of taco seasoning and I did not use as much chili powder as called for. I only had canned jalapenos so that is what I used. I made the taco with homemade refried beans. I used corn tortills and a onion cilantro mixture which goes a long way for making tacos taste authentic. Topped with avacodo, tomato and chihuahua cheese with a splash of fresh lime this was a delightful way to slow cook a pork roast. I will never use ground beef again.

I make this over and over. Whenever pork roast is on sale, I buy it and use this recipe then freeze for later use. Be sure to shred while the pork is hot and make sure your roast isn't too fatty. Follow this recipe exactly, no substitutions! It's perfect.

My family loved this recipe. I had some pork left over from a previous meal so i used the last 6 ingredients to a sauce pan to make a sauce adding about 1/4 -1/3 cup of water to thin it out a bit . I then simmered the leftover shredded pork in the sauce until heated. I served the meat with corn tortillas, cheese, avacado, tomatoes, and salsa. It was delicious.

This is a wonderful recipe for feeding a crowd.  Leftovers taste even better, so its okay to cook in advance and reheat.  I cooked mine on low heat in an electric skillet for 4 hours.  Then I shredded it and added some Goya Mojo Chipotle marinade and continued to stew for a couple hours until dinnertime.  Many thanks to Dee, wherever you are!

This was very good. I added a little bit of cumin and some red/black pepper. I did that to add a bit of heat and a smokiness to the flavor. We will definitely make this again! Thank you!

This recipe couldn't have been easier.  Like alot of the other reviewers I cooked the pork in a crockpot for about 7 or 8 hours.  The only change I made was to add about 1/4 cup of water to make sure it didn't burn.  Served on tortillas with all the toppings.  Delicious!

Maybe this is better in the crockpot, but after cooking nearly 4 hours at 300 degrees, it came out dry & salty. Not exactly a tasy combination...I might try this again using the crockpot, especially to catch all the juices, but I wasn't impressed with this one.

ETA: So I wouldn't be wasting so much meat, I decided to use them in enchilada's the next night, using the Red Enchilada Sauce from the site. Excellent!

Delicious!  My friends all loved it.  I used a 4# pork butt roast, added a diced onion the recipe and cooked it in a dutch oven for 3 1/2 hours on 300.  It was so delicious and moist.  I'd recommend trimming the roast if there is a lot of fat to prevent having to separate it later.  I also made a tomatillo salsa to go with this.  I make my own corn tortillas and we also topped these with queso fresco, shredded cabbage and a squeeze of lime.  Sublime!

Like other post, I threw all the ingredients in the crock pot and cooked it on high for about 5 hours. It is super easy that way and it came out nice and moist, but I was surprised how bland the meat was.  Too try and flavor it up, I sprinkled on more taco seasoning as I was shredding the meat.   I think next time I will only use the taco seasong and add the whole packet.

Delicious. I put it in the crock pot with a little bit of water (1/2 cup?) and left it over night. I shredded it for sandwiches, tacos, and tostadas. I didn't have taco seasoning so I added a little cumin. So flavorful and easy!

Great pork. We put it in the slow cooker for 8 hours on LOW and it turned out great. We did not have any issues with drying out, in fact, we had plenty of liquid left over (we added none). I would recommend this to anyone.

I halved the recipe and still found it took longer than 2hours to cook it. About half way through I raised the temp to 400. I only added 3 tsp of chilli powder and still found it hot. Instead of making it into taco's... I served it with salsa on top of rice and sourcream on top of the pork..it was great!!

I was hoping this would taste more like traditional carnitas but I found it to be less flavorful. I also thought it was slightly too greasy...my hair smelled like pork for the rest of the evening! My kids liked it and ate it in soft tortillas with black beans, shredded cheese, pico de gallo and a bit of sour cream.

These were good -- not crazy good, but all right. Like one reviewer said earlier, it was definitely servicable when you added sour cream, guac, salsa, etc. But by itself . . . mmm, needs a bit of depth.

Wonderful! I've made this several time, both wrapped in foil and in the slow cooker. I like to freeze it in smaller portions for sandwiches.  My whole family loves this recipe. Thanks so much!!  Makes great enchilada, using the sauce from this recipe:  http://allrecipes.com/recipe/enchilada-style-burritos/detail.aspx

We butchered 3 pigs this year. Previously having almost no experience cooking pork, I had no idea what to do with all those shoulder roasts.  This recipe was PERFECT!  I've made it several times now exactly as it is written.  The whole family loves it.  I turn the leftovers into enchiladas.

I used an oven bag instead of the foil. I also added cumin per some of the reviews and it overpowered it for me- I will still add some next time, but just a dash- was very easy! I love make ahead meals for my busy family!

Super easy recipe and so good.  I didn't have the chilies so I made it without.  Can't wait to try it again with them. Thanks!

This was unbelievable!  I followed the ingredients to the letter.  I did cook at a lower heat for about an hour extra since I was leaving hubby with the kids to run errands.  It couldn't have been easier!  I came home to an unbelievable aroma and a delicious meal.  My only complaint was that I couldn't stop picking at the meat and was too full to eat it with tortillas.  The entire family loved it, including two picky toddlers!

This was EXCELLENT!!!  I would give this 10 stars if I could.  I served this for a group of friends and they all LOVED it!  We served the pork on warm corn tortillas with a little home made quacamole and shredded colby jack cheese.  Thank you RMarmolejo!!!!!

Very good.  I followed LoriBell2's lead and slow cooked a 2.5lb pork loin roast.  We made soft tacos (corn and flour tortillas, and we prefered flour because you could really taste the pork) with monterey jack cheese, sour cream and various salsas.  Make sure to spoon a little of the sauce over your meat because it holds a lot of the flavor.  Good, but not spicy.  Next time, I'll add something to give this more of a kick.
