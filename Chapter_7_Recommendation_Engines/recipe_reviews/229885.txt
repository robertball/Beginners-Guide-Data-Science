Fabulous! Doubled everything except the chorizo. Cooked onion with the chorizo. Used 3/4 cup of salsa in the mixture instead of taco sauce, and used one cup of cheese instead of the 1/2 cup when doubled. Added a few dashes of hot sauce. Topped with taco sauce and a sprinkle of cheese.Used 2 pabplano, 2 Anaheim and 2 poquio peppers. Very good!!

This recipe is really, really good. I made it exactly as written, then also a modified version for the kids, using ground beef instead of chorizo and sweet peppers instead of the poblano. A big hit for dinner!

Loved this recipe, I found the ingredients sufficient to fill 4 poblanos.  I used more taco sauce for the top and sprinkled cheddar on the peppers during the baking process and took the foil off for the last 15 minutes.  Sour cream on top at the end is really good as well.

Disappointed I didn't come up with this!  I sauteed one jalapeno and added to the mix, for 8 peppers and a couple of the parts I cut off to make the boats.  I also added fresh garlic once the peppers were soft.  I used pace also, and did not add any to the top when baking.  My family likes spicy food, and this was a hit.  On the favorites list now!

I used my home grown Poblanos which were smaller than found in stores.  So I made this recipe into a casserole.  I lined the bottom of the casserole with the uncooked, halved peppers, then topped with the chorizo mixture,  but at least doubled the rice, salsa and cheese.  I topped the casserole with more cheese and garnished with fresh cilantro after baking.  Spicy and delicious!

This is great the way it is or as a base recipe. It is easily  manipulated to any variation of the ingredients you can imagine. I used regular sausage, Spanish rice, chili beans in chili sauce ( I didn't have any taco sauce on hand), cilantro, onions, and red and yellow bell peppers. It was wonderful and no leftovers!! Thanks for the recipe we will be making this again!

Great and easy recipe. I would just be cautious of the amount of water you put at the bottom of the casserole dish. Add too much, and your peppers will swim in it.

Notes: you can also add just a light drizzle of Mexican crema to add a nice touch.

I halved the recipe and used poblano peppers that I got at my city's summer farmer's market. For the taco sauce, I made  'Homemade Taco Sauce' from this site.  I used a Mexican blend cheese, also topping the peppers with more during the last 15 min of baking. This is a spicy dish, so I can see why some reviewers substituted hamburg for the chorizo and bell peppers for the poblano for those not liking spicy, like kids. Of course, it's a different recipe, but as long as you like it. I'm freezing a couple, because 1 1/2 peppers was very filling.

Very good recipe but we added a can of dice tomatoes with green chilies and not as much taco sauce.   We also only cooked it for 45 minutes so the poblanos were more firm.

This was very tasty, especially with our peppers from the garden!  I used 9 ounces of Chorizo and about six peppers cut in half to bake in an 8x8 inch glass pan.  They were perfectly done in an hour.  Too spicy for the kids, but great for the adults.  I used medium salsa instead of taco sauce and spanish rice.  Yummy!

I prepped this the morning of and left the baking instructions for the guys to have for lunch.  I used hot Italian turkey sausage and added minced garlic the last minute of browning the meat.  I returned home to "OUTSTANDING" written on the bottom of the recipe. They were very pleased and wanted it again the next day.

It was simple to make and very delicious! Also very budget friendly! All this cost me around 12 dollars (granted I had cumin and taco sauce at home). I left a handful of poblano seeds in mine and it was a tad spicy. Definitely will make again in the future!

This. Was. Fantastic!!  I did not change a thing except I grated a little more cheddar cheese on top before baking just because I love cheese.  Have you ever made a recipe and the entire time you are eating you are thinking about making it again?  Well, this is one of those recipes!  I had just the right amount of filling for two polano peppers and they took 55 minutes of baking time  to be done enough yet not be super soft, mushy peppers.  Will I make these again?  Absolutely!!

Love this recipe. Have made it with pork or chicken chorizo and it’s great both ways. If you triple the recipe the extra can be used as a great side for another meal.

I used this recipe  as a base for my stuffed poblanos.  I did quite a few modifications, including  making a Mexican tomato sauce to add and bake the peppers in.  Thank you for sharing your recipe and the inspiration.

Fantastic!!!!!  I made the chorizo myself, and I was a little worried it would be too strong because it uses so many spices, but it was amazing!!!

Made this for dinner. I used sweet Italian sausage instead of the chorizo. I doubled the cheese in the recipe. I also put some shredded cheese on top about 5-10 minutes before they came out of the oven. Will definitely make these again.

This recipe was easy to make and my husband loved it. I made it exactly as instructed and used up my pile of organic poblano peppers from my garden. I had difficulty getting the stuffed peppers to sit upright in the baking dish, so I used bamboo skewers to keep them from rolling over. This recipe is going to be on my weekly dinner rotation.

The Chorizo sausage I used had too much fat for me.  Other than that, I liked the recipe but I probably won't use it again.

These are delicious and have the perfect amount of kick to them.  We used Tapatio for the taco sauce and substituted cooked quinoa for the rice.  We will definitely add these to the regular rotation while poblano peppers are available.

Delicious and hubby really liked his. I pretty much followed the recipe and served it with a dollop of sour cream on top and Pico de gallo over an avocado half and tortilla chips on the side
Pretty quick and easy but I did cook it in the microwave for about 10-15 minutes since I didn't have the hour to cook it in the oven.

Great recipe. I only needed to cook my peppers for about 45 minutes, not an hour. If your peppers are on the smaller size, you may want to check on them early.

Excellent.  I will put this in my recipe rotation.  Even my husband, who "doesn't like stuffed peppers" ate ALL of my leftovers.

Made this recipe with my roommate :) Cooked the onions first, with some garlic, and then added the (soyrizo). Put cheese in the bottom of our poblanos cause ours were pretty spicy. Then topped with avocado and cream. Super good!

I doubled everything and used  zesty Bob Evans sausage instead of chorizo—was great but had a ton of meat mix left over... will go well in an omelette

This is fantastic!  The only substitution I made was to use cauliflower rice instead of white rice.  It turned out perfectly.  I wish I had doubled the recipe.

Excellent though be sure poblano are fully cooked/soft or they could add more heat than you want. I skipped the olive oil - Chorizo is fatty enough.

I substituted tofu chorizo - tasted great!  Poblano peppers are much spicier than I thought they'd be!  Very, very tasty, and easy to make.  I'm going to make it again.

This is a fantastic recipe. I didn't want to bake for an hour so I fired up my grill, wrapped the peppers in two layers of foil, dropped the foil into my veggie rack and put the whole thing on the grill for about 15 minutes on low heat. The peppers came out fantastic. Check your peppers frequently so they don't burn.

I have made these about 4-5 times.  These have been a nice change from the typical classic stuffed green bell peppers, which my family does not prefer.  I used a combination of hot and regular  ground bulk sausage instead of the chorizo, since I don't like chorizo that much.  I also used salsa instead of taco sauce.  These were not critical substitutions, however.  I also have found that the peppers do not take a full hour to bake--mine have consistently been tender after about 30-40 minutes.

Delicious. A big hit with 2 adults and 6 kids ranging from 2yrs to 18yrs. Used poblano and green peppers. Followed recipe as written except I sautéd onions with chorizo before adding rice and spices.

I made this close to the recipe.  My differences consisted of using Jimmy Dean regular sausage and diced tomatoes, (with a little Cajun seasoning added for the taco sauce).  I melted a little shredded cheddar on top.   They were spectacular!  I may try making them with a little wild rice, or maybe some mushrooms, next time.  I have some made up to bake using sweet banana peppers (from the garden), but haven't baked them yet.  I'll let you know. Great recipe!!

I put these together the evening before, and then popped them in the oven to cook an hour before dinner time. I had pulled pork on hand, so used that instead, and used cotija cheese and tomatillo salsa for the filling with a bit of cayenne to add the heat for the meat.  I still put a bit of cheddar on top for color and flavor with a few drops of Cholula sauce on top.  You can really play around with the stuffing for these, and the bake time is perfect.

These are sooooo good!  I make them as stated in the recipe.  Good quality, lean chorizo is a must!  I tried one of the cheap tubes and it was extremely greasy. Luckily, our grocery store started making their own which is lean.

These were ok to me.  I couldn't find Poblano peppers at our grocery store, so I used multi-colored sweet peppers.  I had 3 of them, so I doubled all of the ingredients to make sure I had enough filling for the peppers and it worked out perfectly.  I also made this during the week and didn't want to wait an 1+ hours to eat, so I steamed the peppers first in the microwave and then just threw it all in the oven to melt the cheese.  To me they were a little spicy, but very one note.  I found a taco pepper recipe on this website that I absolutely love and I think I will go back to that one.

This was really good. I did make adjustments but only because we didn't have a bottled taco sauce. Instead, I used a 1/4 tsp each of cayenne and chili powder. Because chorizo doesn't routinely come in 3/4 pound packages, I used two 9 oz. packages so there was more filling to accommodate, which meant I needed more poblanos and cheese. But it worked out well and was great warmed over the next day. We'll do this again, keeping the moderations I made.

Yum! I had poblano and chorizo that needed to get used up, so I was glad to find a recipe! I'm sure this didn't need changes to taste amazing, it is very flexible--I added fresh corn, black beans, and diced zucchini to the mixture and used spices from my cupboard (cumin, smoked paprika, and a cuban/lime blend. I also substituted quinoa for rice. It turned out delicious (though I had to remove chorizo and substitute a turkey burger for my son).  Make extra, I'm sure it will be even more delicious today!

Huge hit! I used Jimmy Dean's sausage since I had it  and not chorizo, which we have found to be super greasy. Added no oil. Added the onion with sausage in the skillet for the last 5 minutes or so. Used 1/2 Taco Bell Fire and 1/2  Verde sauce to the meat/rice mix, and topped with the Verde Sauce before baking. The men in my family would have eaten 1 1/2 peppers if I'd made enough.  Everyone loved this! 
Next time, I'll use brown rice instead of white for nutrition, and  I think corn (especially leftover roasted) would be a great addition. But excellent  and EASY recipe!

This is a great recipe!  Used hot red taco sauce and mixed it right into the meat mixture. Otherwise, followed recipe exactly.  Be sure to pat the chiorzo with a paper towel to blot out the grease.

I made these with the recipe and it was fabulous. I have also played with the recipe a little. I added Spanish rice, potato and cilantro. It was just as good. Will definitely be making this again!

Really easy and good. We grilled the poblano peppers first for just a minute or so to give them a great smoky flavor, then we stuffed them. We then added mozzarella and jack cheese to the top before putting them in the oven. Very tasty easy to make treats.

This is excellent. The only change I made was using  sausage and not chorizo. Very easy and loved by everyone. Will be making this again.

This was really delicious. I make my own mock chorizo that I think is better than store bought and I used that. This was really good and the whole family loved it. I'm thinking that next time I'll top them with fried eggs. I used salsa instead of taco sauce (my chorizo has more than enough flavor that taco sauce would definitely over do it) and it really was good. Definitely a keeper recipe.

These were fantastic!!!!  I used Haggens fresh store mad chorizo which was very well seasoned and very low in fat.  Since I was serving Mexican rice as a side dish, I used half a can of pinto beans (rinsed and drained) to substitute for the rice.  DH wants this dish on the favorites rotation. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!!!!

But instead of chorizo, I used chorizo flavored beef. Great and easy.
