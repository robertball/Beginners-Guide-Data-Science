This tastes good - can't taste the spinach at all.  Just apples and cinnamon.  I was expecting a smoother consistency, but it ended up being a mix between chunky and liquidy.  I think this is because there is no banana, yogurt, or peanut butter to make it smooth.  So, 5 stars for taste.  Of course smoothies are versatile, so you can always add protein powder for extra benefits.

I rate this a 5 because of the health factor and it is very tasty. When deciding different variety of healthier snacks, this is a great smoothie to make, especially for those who are trying to lose weight. This is also a good alternative for a low calorie breakfast. Thank you very much!!

This was very good.  My smoothie was smooth, but I also have an expensive blender to chop everything up.  Just as the other review says, you can not taste the spinach at all.

Pretty good, I tried a different variation, I switched out the apple juice and used vanilla almond or soy milk instead and added a small ripe frozen banana, a handful of frozen blue berries and 8 ice cubes.

If you have a ninja it will blend pretty fast ( even the ice) 

This makes it feel like a shake. It's a nice breakfast and it takes a long time to get hungry. This will work with kale too if you're tired of spinach.

When you first look at it, you might think, Ew! But my advice to anyone who hasn't tried it yet is to give it a chance. It's actually really yummy. You can't taste the spinach or any of the other "yucky" veggies at all. Kids love it. I love it. Also, it's pretty healthy, too, so your kids can enjoy a yummy serving of the veggies that you can't get them to eat otherwise. Try it!

Really enjoyed it but also as an alternative I have also added a cup of orange juice instead of apple juice to give a new flavor.. I used the juice with pulp. I found that helps to mask the spinach flavor as well. My kids really enjoyed it.

I haven't tried many of these kind of smoothies yet, but I found it hard to take down. My kids didn't like it at all. I think it would have been better maybe with more ice. Or if the apple juice had been frozen. Wasn't cold enough for me.

This is good. It didn't look like the picture, but the pear and cinnamon go great together. Easy to make with the ninja. Thanks for the contribution of the recipe.

This was very good!  Didn't taste green at all.  I did change one thing tho, instead of apple juice I put in homemade cider which is kinda tart so that gives it a whole nother dimension!

I would give it 3 stars because it's healthy, but I don't like to chew my smoothies. It was too grainy/pulpy. I have a very good blender (Ninja) but it still had too much apple peel pulp. I used an unpeeled green apple - I think I will try and peel it next time (but I like the fiber and health of the peel). My kids liked the flavor, but, to get past the pulp, I had to convince them that it was just like eating an apple.

Glad I checked this recipe further because I make smoothies in my Vitamix every morning and this one was just as good as those I have tested. I was worried about the cinnamon taste because I am not crazy about it but in this recipe, the teaspoon was just fine to give it a little something-something.

I really liked this. But despite the sweetness, I still couldnâ€™t get my kids to drink it. Consistency was fine for us but I do have a Vitamix.

My Vitamix had no trouble at all blending this up. I used pear juice and canned pears since I didn't have fresh. I also halved the cinnamon. I liked this smoothie; it just wasn't as cold as I prefer my smoothies, so I served it over crushed ice.

If you go to the extra length of peeling your apples and pears, this one is super good. I personally make this one with frozen pears and apples (frozen myself), chilled apple juice, and chilled spinach with some cinnamon to taste and that alone is really great, taste similar to an apple pie to me. I don't use the ice called for in this recipe personally since I freeze my fruit.
