These were really good. I used wonton wrappers instead of pre-made shells and they wer a huge hit at a recent baby shower.

If you bake these at 375 in the bottom third of your oven for 25 to 30 minutes till just set you don't need to pre cook the shells thanks for the recipe

Very delicious and simple to prepare!  I served these at an open house and they were a big hit!  They disappear quickly right out of the oven, but are also tasty when served cold.

I will definitely make these again. It seems that 24 individual quiches came out a little skimpy on the filling. Next time will fill the number of shells egg mixture fills.

PERFECT QUICHE RECIPE!  Made this twice - once exactly as directed and once with sautéed yellow onion instead of green onion in a full size pie shell   Exactly the right amount of filling for one 9” quiche.  The proportions are perfect - none of the watery curdled eggs that you get with some recipes.  It turns out a beautiful appetizing colour, something other recipes also miss.   I prefer to put all my cheese in the filling instead of using on top because I find it reheats better (the cheese on top can make a tough crust on reheating.  Love this recipe!

Followed the recipe but ran out of milk so used 1/4 cup soy and it tasted great. I used different types of cheese and a little tyme just to give it a little interest. Delicous and easy!

This recipe turned out great. I wasn’t sure about partially baking the shells before adding the filling but they turned out perfect.

It seemed hard to keep the eggs from expanding in the muffin tins, so most of my quiches got stuck in the tins. Still tasted great though!

Not sure if I was heavy handed with the portions, but I had to add 2 mores eggs with milk, mustard, etc... in order to fill all 24 shells. Still a great recipe for our work brunch. Everyone loved them!
