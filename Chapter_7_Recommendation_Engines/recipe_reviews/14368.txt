I liked this recipe, but as almost everyone who tried it mentioned, there is too much celery....and it takes away from the salsa.

I have tried so many different salsa recipes and have been disappointed. When I found this one, I was skeptical, but it is a WONDERFUL recipe. My husband likes HOT HOT HOT salsa, but I prefer it just a little spicy. After evrything is together, I finely chop 3-4 hobinero (spelling?) peppers for him. It burns my nose just smelling them, but he loves it! Personally, I think he is little crazy!! Thanks for the great recipe! Nikkole

If you love celery you with love it.  If you hate celery you will hate it.  Ground pepper and celery over power

It took a lot of time, too much celery and what's with the oregano.  It turned the salsa totally brown and looked as if meat was in it.  My family thought it was chili on the stove.  Don't bother with this one... move on.

Other than cutting down the celery by half, and reducing some of the spices to make this a "mild" salsa - the result was good (according to my boyfriend and daughter). I'm only so-so on this salsa recipe but I also shared a jar with my extended family and they claimed to have liked it alot too. However, it is MY opinion that it is too time consuming for the taste it produces. But if you like chunky salsa's and are willing to spend some time I'd say give it a whirl. Its not that I found this recipe "bad" - its just not my favorite. But then again - my opinion seems to be the minority (BUT THEY DIDN'T COOK IT EITHER - that's easy for them to say!:)) Thanks!

Great recipe.  Loved the chunkiness and the spicy flavor.  Too much celery.  Cook the vegatables with the tomatoes for better flavor and more nutritous.  Did not make 12 pints.

This was good, but it takes a lot of time, and the seasonings were a little off to my taste.  I adjusted, and it had a very fresh taste, but it was quite time consuming.

First off, one can easily make this using fresh tomatoes (about 4), 2 cloves garlic, cilantro, 2 hot peppers & put it all in a blender...add whatever ingrediants you like except celery and make it as hot or mild as you please.  My mistake was making this...went back to my recipe.

Yummy but I cut back on the celery to half the amount asked for.  The green chilis gave it a great flavor.  I thought it would be too hot so I cut back on the jalapeno, I should have used everything.  My recipe was very flavorful but very mild.

The only thing I did different was reduce the celery by half.   I measured the tomatoes AFTER peeling and seeding. (Well I measured 1 lb and then guessed what 5 lbs would be) Made 12 pints.

I read all the reviews before making this recipe and decided to leave out the celery altogether. (I'm not crazy about celery!!)  I also added 1/2 cup of lime juice (freshly squeezed).  I used Beefeater and Early Girl tomatoes instead of Roma's.  I like very spicy salsa so I put up 3 pints using the recipe and then added 2 jalapenos (with seeds) and 2 Haberneros (with seeds) and additional 1/4 c. of lime juice.  Very spicy!!!! Yum

I USED REGULAR TOMATOES AS I HAD AN ABUNDANCE IN MY GARDEN.  I PICKED THE ONES THAT WERE BARELY RIPE SO THEY WOULD NOT COOK UP.  I ONLY USED 2 STALKS CELERY.  I DID NOT PRECOOK VEGGIES.
I LET THE TOMATOES DRAIN IN COLANDER WHILE CHOPPING VEGETABLES AND THEN MIXED EVERYTHING IN LARGE POT AND BROUGHT TO BOIL.  I POURED OFF MOST OF THE JUICE - LEFT JUST ENOUGH TO KEEP MIXTURE MOIST.  THEN PUT THE MIXTURE IN HEATED JARS , SEALED TOPS, TURNED UPSIDE DOWN FOR 7 MINUTES.  I THEN TURNED THEM OVER AND YOU WILL HEAR THE TOPS BEGIN TO POP WITHIN A FEW MINUTES (MEANING THEY WERE SEALED).  NO NEED TO PRESSURE CAN.

Not impressed at all.  I only used to celery stalks and it was still to much.  Not much flavor at all.

This is decent salsa.  My main recommendation is that after you cook it, take it and run it through a food processor.  Then it has a much better consistency and tastes significantly better.

I made a few changes - 8-9 cups chopped tomatoes that are peeled or blanched to remove skin - 2 stalks celery chopped - juice from 1/2 lime - Everything else I left the same.  I cooked all of ingredients together, bringing it to a full boil and pouring it into hot jars, filling one at a time to within 1/4 of top of jar - add hot lids that have been setting in hot water for a few minutes - add rings and tighten.  They will seal in a few minutes.  No need to turn upside down or pressure can. Makes 4-5 pints.  I added red food coloring to brighten the color.  My family loves it!!!

We left out the celery and added some lime juice (3 limes for this recipe), left out the oregano and added some cumin... so maybe it's not the same recipe at all. Basically we were looking for ratios and this one came closest to what we had on hand. It was good, but not hot enough for our liking. Great veggie/tomato taste, but the next batch we're going to increase the amount of peppers.

I would say it is good, not great!Used fresh tomatoes,peppers,cilantro,garlic and onions from the garden and was really excited about a great Salsa after all of the work that I put into preparation. Husband and children said it was good...but lacking something to give it the great salsa taste that we really love. I am still going to try and see if I can salvage this batch and bring it to the point where they will enjoy it and I will feel good about sharing with others.

Very good flavor, I made a few changes.  I have a hand grinder called a quick chef by tupperware and this is what I used to chop everything.  I leave the skins on the tomatoes and it goes very fast.  I put all the ingredients together and simmer.  I deleted the green chiles, added 1/2 cup vinegar and 4 TBSP lime juice.

This was my first time making Salsa. I have to say this recipe is easy to follow. My only problem was that I was not able to get regular celery. I am in Jordan and the celery is hot so it made this kinda spicy. Great for chili.. thanks.

This was great. I added a little lime juice and reduced the number of jalapeno peppers to 1 and it was very mild. I will use this again!

interesting texture and taste, but the recipe is incomplete. It calls for ingrediants that arent even in the recipe. Are we supposed to take a stab at where they go?
