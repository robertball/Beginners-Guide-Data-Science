I tried just half recipe so I would know what they were like before making these for Father's Day tomorrow. It is the first for my son. I know he will love these as I did when I tried them out. I did omit the onions but only because I didn't have any. I will buy some before tomorrow. Thanks Chef John

Everyone loved them including my 10 year old son! Didn't change a thing with the recipe. The chili syrup was really good but we did alternate toppings of butter with blackberry jam& even salsa. I will definitely be hearing a request for Mancakes again!

Although I liked the concept, it didn't work as pancakes for me. So I made savory muffins from the remaining batter instead. They turned out great. Baked them at 350 for 22 minutes. Mine could have been browner on top, next time I might brush tops with butter for the last couple of minutes. Try it and don't be afraid to add your own twist to this basic recipe.

I made these Mancakes with the help of my teenage daughters and they had a blast. In the beginning they thought  the recipe a awkward but they figured it was something that my husband would enjoy for Father's Day. He also took a look at the video and thought it look rather tasty and it did. The Family enjoyed it and adjust the serving to 16 for a family of six and to include left overs. Everyone thought it was tasty and they mostly tast the Bacon and Chedde…Yum. It's like all your side dishes all in one cake cause you need nothing else on your plate when it comes to this recipe. Just eating two gets you full and its easy to do. Needless to say my husband end up eating 4 and his Belly was happy which made him head straight to the couch. Totally a Man Meal thanks Chef.

Wonderful! I cooked them exactly as Chef John suggested and my family loved them! I cook brunch only a few times a year and when I do I serve up decadence and these suit. Three cheers for a gifted chef! Keep up the good work!

GREAT. We all enjoyed these—even two little kids (who had plain maple syrup on top of theirs, not spiked). The skillet in which I cooked the bacon got pretty dark, so rather than using it to cook the scallions, I just added them to the bowl with the butter and microwaved 'em until the butter melted. I used less than half a cup, just because I didn't have enough scallions. I also used ancho chile powder in the syrup because I didn't have chipotle. This was a fun Father's Day breakfast—kind of a special-occasion splurge, like biscuits and gravy.

Very good! Made them for breakfast this morning. Made a double batch and added extra bacon :) Would recommend not using an oil to cook the pancakes in if using non stick pan. Can taste the seasonings better without the added oil/butter/bacon grease flavor. Will definitely make these again! Thanks for the recipe.

Great flavor!  Did not change anything except; we fried the slices of bacon, drained and blotted the fat with paper towels before we chopped it up. Better results doing it that way. Then we ladled a couple of tablespoons of the bacon fat into a small glass bowl. Wiped out the saute' pan with a paper towel and saute'd the green onion.  Then continued with the recipe.

This was easy and fun to make. My kids and wife loved it. If your kids didn't you should probably get them off the fast food diet. The only thing I did was add a bit more bacon. Probably used about 10oz total and added a little bit more chipotle powder to the syrup. I also made home made maple syrup. Way better than store bought and cut out the vegetable oil and used coconut instead.

Mancakes - Fun breakfast/brunch Father's Day recipes that we enjoyed! I was glad I watched the video before preparing, which I usually do not do. Next time I make this recipe I will add a little more cheese, and I will use the white sharp cheddar like he suggested. Would be delicious reheated in the toaster for an "on the go" breakfast!

Just made this for my hubby for Father's Day, and it was delicious! It took me way more than the 45 minutes Chef John says, but that might just be my inexperience. Next time, I think I'll try it with brown sugar instead of white and a little more cheddar, but overall the flavors and texture were different enough to be unique and complimentary enough to warrant seconds for both me and my man! I did use about 1/4 t of chipotle pepper in the syrup because I wanted to turn up the kick.

Ugliest pancakes Ive ever seen, but very yummy. Family was happy to wake up the surprise. And was surprised to taste the spice, bacon, and onion. 

Will make again.

This recipe was SO good. We had it for Father’s Day supper and will eat the leftovers for breakfast I’m the morning. Easy to make and delicious!!  I didn’t use the chipotle because I didn’t have any but they were fine without it. I also cooked them in butter and bacon grease but much less than the recipe called for. A winner!

These are delicious. Made them exactly as written. We didn’t have chipotle Chile powder so we had to substitute nacho Chile powder. I’ll make these over and over again. I may even try using regular onions cooked with the bacon.

The only thing I didn't add to the recipe is the Green Onions. And it was great! My mom doesn't like green onions, so that's why. But my dad and whole family loved it!

Filling and delicious! I subbed spelt flour for the AP flour, due to wheat allergy in my family. I used locally sourced bacon, which is milder than brand name bacon, and I think next time I'll buy bacon at the store so the flavor is more pronounced. I used white sharp cheddar. Next time I will use a bit more than called for as I could not really taste it, though it gave the cakes a lovely texture. Also, my family is not big on sweets, and they preferred the cakes be served topped with butter. Though I liked the chipotle maple syrup, I thought the delicate flavor of the scallions was overpowered by the maple syrup. Do flash fry the scallions in the pan with the bacon; it infuses the drippings with a lovely aroma of the scallions which should then be used to fry the cakes. A terrific recipe; thanks, Chef John!

It's a snow day in Seattle! Wanted to make something different for breakfast.  Almost cut recipe in 1/2 and wish I did as this makes a lot. I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of milk and needed to add another 1/3 of a cup as the batter was so thick. My husband was leary but, enjoyed them. I used chipotle chili powder with my syrup, not his, and really liked it! I can see me making these again!

Made a quadruple batch at a friends bar for a World Series party. We're in Beijing so the games started at 8 am, wanted something breakfasty. Followed the recipe, but added some bourbon to the chili maple syrup. These were awesome!

I made Mancakes exactly like the recipe. My husband loved it. He can be picky and hasn't had much of an appetite lately. He likes spicy food and the Chipotle chili powder in the syrup brought it over-the-top. And then there's the bacon... I probably could've used a whole pound, but didn't and now I have another 1/2 pound! Be sure to use the green onions. It adds a crunch and is a good surprise.  I'm not sure the color of the cheddar or cornmeal matters. I used yellow of both. It worked out well. And last, but not least is baking powder. I think that is what made them light and fluffy (it certainly wasn't the bacon or cheese). Chef John will not steer you wrong.

Not bad but added cumin and fresh corn kernels to the batter.  Served with shredded taco chicken and cojita cheese.  Will make again with the added changes.

These were just ok for us. Mr. LTH deemed them "too greasy" and neither one of use finished ours.  I followed the recipe as written, save the addition of black pepper, per personal preference.  I served this with a side of beer, and that was a hit, but the pancakes themselves fell a bit flat of our expectations (bacon, onions, cheddar, heat...how can you go wrong?!).  Worth a shot, but won't be a repeater on the breakfast table at the LTH house.  THANKS for the recipe!

I made this for my husband for Father's Day 2014.  He loved them and my daughter wants me to make them again this weekend.  I cheated and used pre-cooked real bacon bits, which I sautéed with the green onions.  I had planned to add a little butter if necessary, but I didn't have to.  I didn't add the bacon grease to the griddle, but I think the flavor was fine without.  I'll make again.

Made these for Dad Day.  He loves spicy food, but didn't like these at all.  Said he preferred "regular" pan cakes.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I liked them, but didn't love them.  They were very dense and hearty.  Not bad, but not for us.  Won't make again.

I made this with my son for Father's day for my husband.  It was a refreshing change from the standard sweet pancake.  We all liked it.  The chipotle-spiced maple syrup was a fun and spicy change.  My husband particularly loves spicy dishes and the sweet and spicy blended well together.  The bacon, onions and cheese additions were the bomb!  These were reminiscent of corn fritters in texture, which we liked.  We did wonder about the corn meal, as it was not fun to crunch on - would have rather crunched on the bacon and green onions only.  Otherwise, the flavors went well together and it was fun to try something new.  My 19 year old son (who has a pretty adventurous attitude toward food) said, "Chef John has a sophisticated pallet!"  If you are seeking something new with a neat blend of flavors, then this recipe is for you.  If you wanted standard pancakes, you may want to try something else.

I have never had cornmeal in pancakes before so that along with the savory / sweet combo had me intrigued. I loved the texture of the pancakes as the cornmeal gave the outside a nice crispiness. Also loved the spicy syrup...that truly was brilliant! However, having the bacon, onion and cheese in the batter just didn't work for us. Though the flavor was good, it was just weird biting into pieces of bacon and onion. We will definitely be adding cornmeal to our pancakes in the future and will probably try the spicy syrup again, but we'll forego the bacon, cheese and onion.

They were very manly indeed! I'm not sure this recipe is for me though, maybe because I'm a girl. It was a big hit with my boyfriend but I think next time I'll stick to regular pancakes. The flavors kind of upset my stomach. I think I would have liked them better without the corn meal.

My wife made these for me on Father's Day brunch last year and I thoroughly enjoyed them, just never got to rate them until now.   

Chef John...such a great guy to follow.  I love his concepts and twists on the classics and Mancakes do not disappoint.  The corn meal in this recipe gives a good amount of stick-to-your-ribs richness that regular pancakes don't do for me.  However, I do not think they would be great in the early morning, more like brunch or brinner (breakfast for dinner).

The recipe was followed to the letter as my wife thinks recipes are science projects, not artistic sessions,  but next time I will do something more with the syrup--maybe puree some chopped jalapeno or chipotle peppers.  

Mancakes are definitely not low fat, but they would do well with turkey bacon or maybe even a low-fat sausage for those watching their fat intake.

I love cornmeal pancakes so I really enjoyed these. I was skeptical at first although, I like sweet and savory, cheese inside of a pancake was a little odd to me. I eliminated the black and Cayenne pepper, I thought it was a bit much. I absolutely hate all forms of onion so instead of onion I used a fresh finely chopped jalapeno pepper which added some heat back to the recipe. I made them twice and enjoyed them each time. I actually think they could've use more cheese. I didn't really notice the cheese in the finished product. The next time I'll try adding more. I also found the chipotle syrup to be a nice addition.
I could see these as a part of a savory dish; they kind of remind me of a Latin corn cake.

Thank you! On our family vacation last month we were served these at a little shop in Astoria OR and loved them.  The family has been trying to find the recipe and this is so close.  Served as a savory breakfast with sour cream and applesauce.

Made a half-batch of these for Father's Day yesterday.  Left out the chili in cakes and syrup because Dad's not a fan of spicy but they were excellent, a little thick so next time I'll add a bit more milk but overall well worth the time.
