From the submitter's comment, I expected the cookies to be obviously green, but they looked  like regular chocolate chip cookies.  The green color was almost imperceptible, as was the creme de menthe flavoring in the baked cookie dough.  The only noticeable mint flavor came from the chips themselves.  Although they were good, next time I'll just add mint chocolate chips to a standard chocolate chip cookie recipe and save my creme de menthe.  I bought a bottle especially for this recipe and essentially wasted my money as neither the color nor the flavor came through in the cookies.

Not the best looking cookie, but they sure are good.  Kind of refreshing, actually, like an after dinner mint.  I guess I wasn’t too good at following directions because I mistakenly interpreted the chips called for as mint chips (green) not mint CHOCOLATE chips (brown).  But it was a happy mistake, because they were delicious.  The crème de menthe lends just the right amount of mint flavor to the cookie but it also lends a not particularly attractive color, which is sort of a greenish-brown.   Deceptive, because they’re surprisingly good.

I wanted a different cookie and thought this sounded good so I tried it. I had to improvise because I only had regular chocolate chips but they turned out great. I did get way more than 2 and a half dozen but the more the better. The mint flavor is a nice twist to chocolate chip cookies.

I added a bit more Creme de Menthe than what was asked and I replaced the mint chocolate chips with Andes Chocolates which really made the mint flavor stand out.

Second time I have made these. I like them a lot. The mint taste comes largely from the chips but still yummy. I think the amount of time is wrong...they are too soft at 10 minutes...barely able to remove them from cookie sheet. Try 20 minutes.

These were an interesting cookie.  As evident by the picture I took of these cookies I had no problem w/ the cookies turning a green colour. Having said that I think it needs to be pointed out that you can get creme de menthe liqueur in either clear or green.  I expected that the cookies would have an intensely mint taste but that didn't happen.  For those that state they need to be baked longer, no they don't.  The cookies will continue to cook after you remove the cookies from the oven.  Good cookie, and perfect for St Patricks day!

I really wanted to make these but didn't have the creme de menthe, so I used creme de cacao instead (you can never have too much chocolate!).  I doubled the liquer, reduced the white sugar by 1/4 cup, and doubled the baking soda and added 2 tablespoons (yes, tablespoons) of vanilla.  YUM!

The cookies turned out great! The cook time of 10 minutes, plus a 5 minute rest on the cookie sheet was perfect. I did modify the recipe... couldn't find mint chocolate chips, so I used regular semi-sweet chocolate chips and used 5 Tbsp of Creme de Menth instead of 2.

delicious! Recommend cooking for 11-13 minutes, but keeping them soft. Rave reviews at the office. I didn't have mind chips, so instead used 1 c. butterscotch and 2 c. milk chocolate. Recipe yeilded more like 40 cookies - and they lasted only until 10am!

I added nuts to these and they are delicious!  I agree they need to bake a little bit longer than 10 minutes.

I LOVE these cookies! I'm a mint chocolate fan to start with, so turning that into a delicious chocolate chip cookie makes my day! The creme de menthe adds a slight green hue, but nothing really obvious and it gives an extra boost of mintiness. This is the first chocolate chip cookie recipe I've made where I've actually reduced the amount of chocolate chips. I use about a cup and a half instead of the full 3 and I do tend to get about 4 dozen cookies out of the recipe. These have become my go-to cookie when I'm looking to make something sweet.

This is the perfect mint chocolate chip cookie!  I used the green and brown mixed bag of mint chocolate chips.   I used only a half a cup of the white sugar and the full cup of brown sugar, still plenty sweet.  Make sure you follow direction and let them sit for about 5 minutes or so before moving or they will fall apart.

These cookies were delicious!  I made a half batch but kept the creme de menthe the same and they tasted like mint chip ice cream.  I will definitely make these again.

Great tasting cookie.  Used a variation since I didn't have mint chips.  I used semi-sweet chocolate chips and then pressed a york peppermint patty into the middle.  In the future I will try Andes Candies or Hershey Bliss Mints.  My family's favorite cookie this holiday season!!
