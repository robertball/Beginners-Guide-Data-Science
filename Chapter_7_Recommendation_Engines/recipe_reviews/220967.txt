This was served for a bunco group after Easter....it was wonderful!  Just the right amount of spice, creamy texture and the green peppers and tomatoes added a fresh element.

I just made this for my family and they all loved it.  It has some fresh ingredients that add to the tastefulness of this dish.  It is also very easy to prepare, making it a definite addition into my recipe book.

This is our new Christmas eve tradition. My husband made this and swapped poblano peppers for the green peppers for a south-western twist.  This is the best mac and cheese recipe we've been able to find.

This was a nice way to spice up Mac n cheese. Definitely add more cheese. I stirred in the last 6 oz. of cheese before putting in dish, then I added a layer of cheese to top before baking.

I didn't have the exact type of cheeses but close. I added Parmesan cheese and sharp cheddar cheese was yum!  For the tomatoes  I used sun baked tomatoes instead. I added a little more half and half instead of milk for my desired consistency of the sauce. There was no call for salt in this recipe which was awesome. The diced ham took care of that. Came out delicious. ??

I had to change up a couple of the  ingredients but with the changes I would rate if 10 stars if I could.  Definitely the tastiest macaroni casserole, ever!  I had red bell pepper instead of green and that enhanced the overall flavor too!  I used a half large red pepper, chopped.  8 ounces shredded Monterey Jack with jalapeno pepper,  2 ounces  shredded Parmigianno Reggiano, and 6 ounces  shredded Sharp Cheddar.  The rest of the recipe  was kept as is.  The flavor of this casserole was scrumptious and truly outstanding.   This is definitely my go-to recipe for our left over ham!  I will make it exactly as I did with the substituted cheeses as I did the first time as the flavor was amazing!

I tried this recipe and he flavor was good but the cheese separated from the milk and was not creamy like my regular macaroni and cheese.  I did add a bag of frozen vegetables instead of the tomatoes.  I'm not sure if that had something to do with it.  But even so, it was a good way to use up the ham I had in the fridge.

Yum!! Super easy way to make mac and cheese with no fake cheese. I've made this with kielbasa, ham, hot dogs, or just plain and it's a huge hit.

Not that great, a little simpler than other recipes but it's lacking in texture and flavor.  I'm going back to my old recipe.

I love recipes that push the edge of flavor; this is one of them.  I surprised everyone on Thanksgiving with this addition to the regular Mac-n-cheese, and I'm proud to say there was none left.  As always, I didn't stick completely to the ingredients (adding, sweet and white onion, rotel hot tomatoes, jalapeño peppers), but thats the beauty of cooking.
Try  this one for yourself.

I substituted a jalapeño for the green pepper, minus most of the seeds, and used only sharp cheddar and jalapeño cheddar cheeses.  It had a good kick and tasted fantastic!

Amazing! I'm not much for spicy so I substituted mushrooms for the green peppers and did 8 oz Monterey Jack cheese instead of pepper Jack! Absolutely amazing flavor!
