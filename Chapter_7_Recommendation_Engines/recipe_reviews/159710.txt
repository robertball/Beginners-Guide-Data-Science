When I make it I use self-rising flour insead of the baking mix just because I don't use baking mixes.  The co-worker who gave me this receipe always entered it in baking contest. 6 out of 6 times she won the Blue Ribbon.

This recipe is great!  My husband requested a peach cheesecake for his birthday and this one more than delivered.  He asked for a second one to share with his family, and wanted FRESH peaches in it this time.  After doing some research, I decided to try it.  In order to remove the skin easily from fresh peaches, you need to boil the whole peach for about 30 to 40 SECONDS, then plunge them immediately into a bowl of very cold water.  This allows air to get beneath the skin and it is easier to remove.  Afterwards, I simply chopped them up and added them.   I also changed the "baking mix" to white lily self-rising flour, and I took some juice from a can of peaches to add the right amount of peach juice.  He and his family loved it, and are awaiting the next installment --  Thanks!

Well, this is funny because I have had this recipe card in my recipe box for 15 YEARS and it is tattered as well. Except mine is called "Peaches and Cream Cheesecake". Every time I make this, the recipe is requested over and over. Now I lost my recipe box and while I somewhat remembered the recipe, I set out to find it. This is exactly like mine, except mine called for flour and added leavening, not baking mix. You can also use pineapple as well. I leave off the cinn-sugar topping...and if fresh peaches are in season, use them! Thank you for posting so I didn't lose the trusted recipe!

I use this site all the time and rarely write reviews.  I really felt compelled to write a 5 star review for this recipe b/c it was amazing!  Everyone gobbled it down and there were no left-overs!  My only regret is that I didn't double the recipe!  Also, I couldn't find 1.5 oz vanilla pudding mix (thought maybe it was a typo?) but just weighed out that much from a bigger box and it worked great.

This dessert was disappointing!!! It sounded good, but it overflowed in my oven, and after cooling was no better. The batter was tough & dry. The cream cheese was gooey. No thanks!

Strange texture.  I followed the recipe as written.  It came out rubbery.  No.

Very good!!! Will decrease the pudding/baking mix layer next time though because I used a 8" pie plate and that part was a bit too thick but otherwise...AWESOME

Hmmm, I fail to see why some thought this was great. I doubled the recipe. Tasted the batter before pouring in pan and it was blah. I added van. and almond extract and the flavor improved. Also added it to the cheese mixture because I thought that was flat too, also added extra peach juice. It tasted really good. I wanted to add amaretto to it instead of the juice but was out. Anyhow, it smelled great cooking. I had to refrigerate overnight. Well when it was servered the next day, the bottom "crust" was chewy and not very good. And I didn't feel there was enough cheese mixture per crust ratio. I was so disappointed with this. Even though some said they liked it, some of us didn't. It didn't disappear like my other desserts I've made. I also don't think people should rate it so high when they do so many changes to it because it alters the recipe completely.  I'm an expert baker, I'm known for my cooking, I do it as my job. So it was not due to my lack of skills. But I'm not a fan of this one. Sorry.

Made this today for Father's Day so I wanted it to be extra special; I had some blueberries that I'd just picked at a local farm and made a blueberry sauce as follows: 1 1/2 cups fresh blueberries, 1/4 cup water, 1/3 to 1/2 cup sugar, 1 tablespoon cornstarch, 1/4 teaspoon almond extract.  Put berries and next 3 ingredients in a saucepan, bring to boil, stirring frequently until spoon is coated - approximately 20 to 35 minutes.  Remove from heat and stir in 1/4 teaspoon almond extract.  Ladle a couple of heaping spoonfulls on individual servings of Peach Cheesecake. Very special indeed! Everyone love it!  (Texture of 'cheesecake' more like a cobbler, but still very tasty!)

This is the first recipe I have ever reviewed.  It is both quite easy to make and exceptionally delicious.  It is peach season now, so I used just over 2 cups of fresh, organic peaches.  I also sprinkled the peaches with sugar, let some juice come out, and used the juice to mix into the cream cheese.  This is now my favorite dessert recipe for peach season, and is going to be hard to dethrone (although I am open to challenger suggestions).

P.S. "Baking mix" = Bisquick or the like (I used Bisquick and people did not guess it was Bisquick)

I have had this recipe for years and it is always a favorite at my house or any home I take it to. I always double the recipe,bake in a 9x13x2 glass dish andrefrigerate after cooling to set the cream cheese filling. Plus, the cinnamon/sugar topping - I add more than called for. More is better!!

I made  this delicious recipe twice in one week! My husband just loved it.  It is best when you refrigerate it before serving as it tastes like an icebox cake too.

I canned peaches today and had a few left over, so of course I used fresh peaches instead of canned. Needless to say, despite the substitution, it didn't last long in our home. A new fav!

This recipe needs help. It may work better is you add 1 cup of milk to the pudding mix before adding bisquick. It was like paste until I added more milk. The crust came out rubbery following directions as they were. If you want a real cheescake effect beat in one egg to the topping,

I had high expectations and made this recipe exactly as it read except for adding a little more peach juice to the batter because it was very dry. But I had to bake it twice as long as the directions suggested since it wasn't set up in the center after 30 minutes. So it came out chewy with more like a dry bread pudding texture than a cheesecake.  I won't make this again.

Oh my gosh... I can't possibly say enough good things about this recipe!!  Easy to make, every human who has tried it loves it, and we now have to double the recipe just to get a small portion ourselves!  This is terrific for home, pot-lucks, anywhere at any time.  We actually made this two days in a row because we couldn't get enough!  :)

It rocks! This time I used cherry pie filling in place of the peaches and couple of tbsps of rum instead of peach juice.
