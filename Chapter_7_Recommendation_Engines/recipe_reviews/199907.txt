Simple and delicious for breakfast, just as the submitter states. I mixed in some fresh berries along with the frozen and used ground cinnamon plus a dash of nutmeg.  I didn't have flax seed so I used wheat germ instead. I topped it off with some fat free vanilla yogurt - YUM!

My kids thought this was awesome. I didn't have a cinnamon stick so I just used about a 1/4 tsp. cinnamon. I also used organic unsweetened coconut. They inhaled it and asked for seconds. Smart way to use flax seed! (This was two servings for my kids, BTW.)

Tasty, healthy and quick way to change up the breakfast routine. I followed this recipe, using a mix of frozen berries/fruit.  The brown sugar made a nice glaze with just enough sweetness. I used a toasted flax meal to add some nut flavor. The cinnamon flavor got lost, so I would use regular ground cinnamon instead of the stick. I also might toast the coconut. It added interest and crunch, but the flavor wasn't there. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This was really good, especially when I have a bag of frozen fruit I don't know what to do with! I added a little yogurt and cream cheese to give it a little base. It took it to the next level

Very easy and very good. 1/2 portion was just enough for dessert (to cut down on calories). Would not try to grate cinnamon stick next time but use jarred cinnamon because the pieces were too large.
