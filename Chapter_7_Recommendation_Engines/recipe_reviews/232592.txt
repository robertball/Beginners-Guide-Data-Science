Love this one! I made 6 buns out of it and used them for sandwiches.

Amazing! Great bread! Let it stay moist when you set it to rise. Let the baking soda broth brown and boil a bit before putting dough in it.

Perfect just as written. I needed more flour but I live in a humid climate so I always need more flour. This came out so good it disappeared immediately. Will definitely make again soon.

Absolutely love this bread. Was going to use it for sandwiches but it was gobbled up as soon as it was cool enough to eat. Boiling it in the baking soda water was a little messy but is what totally makes this a pretzel bread. This is our new favorite!

Fantastic recipe. I tripled the recipe so I could share. Definitely a hit. Also made pretzel sticks which where devoured quickly. Will be making this often. Thanks for the fantastic recipe!

This is good pretzel bread but there is another one on this site that I like a little better. It's great texture but a tad on the bland side.
