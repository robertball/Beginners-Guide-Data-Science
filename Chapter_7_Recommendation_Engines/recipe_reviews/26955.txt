I'm not sure why this doesn't have more ratings or reviews.  I found this recipe over a year ago and everyone loves this dip!  Very easy to make and always tasty.  Chill for a few hours for better flavor.

The biggest hit appetizer dish at the party.  Goes great with Wheat Thins, or Ritz Crackers.  YUMMY YUMMY!!!!  It doesn't last long though so make enough for everyone.

Not bad.  It's basically cocktail sauce and cream cheese with shrimp.  I like the flavor but not so much when it's combined like this.  I prefer one of the other recipes that layer the cream cheese and then the cocktail sauce and shrimp together on top.  It just tastes better to me.  Also, the instructions don't say this but I highly recommend softening the cream cheese before trying to mix it with the ketchup and horseradish.  I had a hell of a time getting the lumps out before putting in the shrimp.

Very bland, and very disappointed. We had to add many other ingredients to put some flavor into this dish.

So this is a great base to a better dip. I saut√©ed my shrimp in olive oil and garlic, let them cool, diced the shrimp into small chunks, and then added just the drained shrimp to this dip. I also added another tablespoon of horseradish to this to give it more of a bite.  My boyfriend, our guests, and myself loved this dip! I will definitely make it again.

This was very good and makes a lot.  I did put in more ketchup and more horseradish to give it more flavor.  I've made it twice in as many weeks, people really like this.  The second time, I also put in real crab meat.  That really sends it over the top.  Good spread.  Thank you for sharing.
