First of all, this has GOT to make more than 8 servings...I'd say at least 10-12! My family of four each had a decent-sized helping (and my hubby went for seconds) and there is still 3/4 of the dish left.My boyfriend and daughter enjoyed it, and I and my roommate are so-so on it.  IF I make again, I think I'll cut back on the amt of meat used.  Also, the sour cream and cream cheese mix was a little too much...maybe cut it in half?? Either way, good and I might try to play around with it...after we finish the large amounts of leftovers!

I tried this recipe after reading the rave reviews, and was very disappointed. My family is a pasta-loving family, but all of us did not like this dish. The cream cheese and sour cream really over-power the dish. Thumbs down from me.

My mom did not care for this at all, but I thought it was okay.  I think it really needs more noodles though, because I felt like I was eating meat sauce with a side of noodles, instead of the other way around.

This has become one of my husbands favorite meals (and he doesn't like cream cheese).  It is great for company.
I use 1 lb of sweet italian sausage and 1 lb gr. beef and also add a lot of italian seasoning.  I use a whole box of pasta, too so the cream cheese mixture isn't so overwhelming.  I also use light sour cream and cream cheese and omit the cheddar cheese altogether because I don't think it needs it.

Mmmmm.  I ommitted the beef, used jarred pasta sauce (instead of garlic, crushed tomatoes, paste, sauce, sugar and salt) and left out the green onions.  I also used penne pasta in place of linguini.  I only used half the sour cream and cream cheese called for.  I mixed the pasta, cream cheese, sour cream and pasta sauce all together and baked it in a round pie pan, adding the cheddar at the end as directed.  It came out great and the boyfriend loved it.  Yum!

This was dilicous!! Whole family enjoyed it! However, I did add Italian seasoning to sauce, onion and some canned mushrooms. I subsituted Ricotta for the cream cheese..thought the cream cheese would be too rich.Omitted the green onion and topped with mozz cheese instead of cheddar.

Excellent dish that's even better reheated as leftovers. Also great for dinner parties, as it can be prepared ahead and heated when ready to serve.

I prepared this recipe on my job as a special dish...every one now has that expectant look on their face when they see me with ground beef and cheese.  It was very rich; next time I will use lower fat Neufchatel cheese and sour cream.  This recipe is excellent for feeding large groups.

It was good, but I agree, too cream-cheesy.  I'll make it again, but probably use a 3oz package of cream cheese and use low fat ricotta to lighten up the taste, otherwise it was too heavy.

This was pretty good. I see a few changes I will make if I make it again. I would recommend using chive flavored cream cheese rather than putting chunks of green onion in with it, much smoother that way. I also think the meat sauce needs a little more kick, like maybe some oregano or basil. But overall very good, the family enjoyed it.

I thought the sauce would make a good spaghetti sauce. My boyfriend said he liked it, but it was a little cream-cheesy.

Everyone I've served this too enjoys it.  It's great to take to gatherings.  I use a full pound of linguini and put it in a bigger pan....makes the sour cream and cream cheese less intense.  I also cook the sauce all day in a crockpot and put the dish together when I get home.

This was a great recipe. My boyfriend and I loved this. I cut all the ingredients in half expect for the pasta. I think that was a good move b/c otherwise the sauce would over power the noodles. It was so good.

This was really great.  I made it in the morning and baked late afternoon.  My 9 year old and his friend ate half of the pan and my 15 year old, who hates cream cheese, gave it a thumbs up.  He still does not know it had cream cheese in it.  Will make again.

I was looking for something to brighten up the dinner table and i found it! My husband and daughter loved this meal. So quick and easy i know that i will make it again soon.
