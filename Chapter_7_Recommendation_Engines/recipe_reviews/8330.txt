This is an old, tried and true pineapple cake recipe that's been around for over 30 years--that's how long I've been making it anyway! What's so interesting about this cake is that it has no butter, oil or shortening! It goes by many names, but no matter what you call it it's moist, delicious, pineapple-y and mixes up in no time. I think I like my frosting better tho'...only 1/4 cup butter, which I believe really gives it more of a cream cheese taste, and 2 c. powdered sugar.

I have a recipe that is very similar to this one that I have been making for a long time.  So, I was tickled when I came across this one.  It took me all of 3 minutes to put together.  Just dump everything in one large bowl and mix together.  Be sure to keep an eye on this as it tends to bake quickly.  If it starts browning to much around the edges before the middle is set, just lay a peice of foil on top until it's done.  I didn't use the cream cheese icing because I didn't have any cream cheese.  Out of desperation, I found a birthday cake icing on this site and used it. I did find me another 5 star recipe, so everything worked out for the best.  Thanks Marie.

I too have made this cake for over 30 years.  It is so moist and yummy.  I use black walnuts in my batter and black walnuts in the icing....just gives it a little more kick.  I sometimes sprinkle a little coconut on top of the frosting.

This cake was a great disappointment to me. I had guests and we all agreed that it wasn't worth making again. The only thing that even barely began to save it was the fact that the nuts added a bit of a crunch.I love cooking and take delight in trying out new recipes weekly. This one was definitely a disappointment.

I had a piece of cake at a function that I loved, I came home and looked up what I thought it might be and THIS WAS IT!!  I was so excited!  This is SOOOO GOOOOD!!!  Moist, and flavorful.  I lessoned the sugar to 1 1/2 cups.  I also thought that 1/2 cup nuts couldn't possibly be enough in the cake.  Turns out, 1 1/2 cups is a little too much.  But, none the less, this is now my favorite cake!  Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

I had been looking for this reciepe for awhile.The coffee shop at work makes this treat but the icing is made with brown sugar instead of the powered sugar. If any one can help me in porportion of reducing to brown sugar that would be awesome.When I used the powered sugar my icing was runny.also I cut down the sugar for the batter to 1.5 cups with the pineapple it was still a little to sweet. over all it was a tasty treat..I will use it again with the brown sugar instead of the powered sugar..

This is a very old recipe of mine and a true crowd pleaser.   They always ask for more and for the recipe!  Easy to throw together and ingredients are usually all on-hand. Very moist.  Great all occasion cake.

I brought this to my Book Club yesterday, and it was a great success. We all loved this cake and were surprised at how much this tasted like carrot cake. I really didn't know what to expect when I saw the ingrediants. I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 because of all the sugar. This is just loaded with calories. It's yummy though!

This cake is so good. A friend at work calls this Texas Pecan Cake. Like others I only used 1 teaspoon of vanilla in the cake and 1/2 cup butter in the icing. I was worried about how brown the cake get on top while baking. I baked the caked for 45 minutes. Thanks for a great recipe.

After my mother requested a moist cake with lots of nuts and a creamy frosting, I naturally took to allrecipes to find the perfect recipe. I came up with several contenders, but decided to try this one out first. I followed the advice of one reviewer and decreased the sugar to 1.5 cups and doubled the nuts. I briefly toasted the nuts that I used to top the cake. The result? Raves from both parents, who loved the level of sweetness and the moistness conferred by the pineapple. I'd say this is a cake that would win favor with adults more so than kids. The frosting has a very nice flavor, but if you follow the recipe and spread it on the hot cake, it will melt. I waited for the cake layers to cool, and then the frosting spread easily while maintaining its texture. Thanks for the recipe!

I've been making this cake for a very long time. I make it as a "dump" cake. Just stir the ingredients together with a fork right in the cake pan. I put the walnuts for the frosting on top because it makes a nicer presentation (and that's what my version of the recipe calls for). It's an absolutely wonderful cake.

This cake was really easy to put together and turned out really great.  I used canned pineapple slices that I crushed myself since I didn't have the crushed pineapple.  I also used pecans and low fat cream cheese, and it still turned out really tasty.  It was very moist and delicious.  The topping was really sweet but that's how I like it!

Very nice cake.  A bit sweet, next time I would reduce the sugar.  We had no pineapple so I used applesauce and lowered the baking temp to 325 to compensate for the extra moisture.

This cake is delicious!  I made it as directed, except that my can of crushed pineapple was only 14.5 oz, so I added enough pineapple juice to equal 20 oz.  Very, very moist.  Very, very sweet.  I'm not sure why the recipe says to ice the cake while it's hot...I did wait about 15 minutes, but the cake was still plenty warm.  I ~think~ it would be fine to wait until the cake cooled, but I haven't tried it yet.  I'll absolutely make this cake again!  Thanks!

Outstanding!  A local Tea Room even serves this cake on their menu & I was thrilled to get my hands on the recipe.  When I'm out of Walnuts I have substituted Pecans and that was good too!

So happy to have found this recipe.  My grandmother used to make this when I was little (40 years ago).  I lost the recipe and was so happy to find this.  This cake is so much better cold.

In order to make this a little healthier, I make this recipe with only 1 1/4 cups of sugar. I also substitute the lower calorie Neuchatel cream cheese. For many years I made the original recipe, but since changing to the lower sugar and fat version, I like it just as much.

The first time I tasted this, a customer brought it in as a dessert for after their meal. It was delicious! By far best cake I’ve ever eaten! The next day they brought me the recipe for it. Excited was hardly the word lol. Anyways I made it. All ingredients cost me about $30 total (nuts aren’t cheap). This recipe says to bake for 40-50 minutes. The recipe I was given said to bake for 35-40. I baked for 35 minutes. The piece I ate that my customer gave me was moist, and had perfect texture. Mine however had a rubber type texture but tastes exactly like what I tried. Not sure what I did wrong, but if I can get past this it will be the only cake I will ever make again!!

Loved this recipe.  Cake was dense, but I expected that from reading the reviews.  The icing was fantastic.  I took this cake to work and several people wanted the recipe just because of the icing.  I will definitely make again.  Thanks LMFARM for such an easy tasty treat.

This is a favorite at all pitch-ins.  Sooo moist.  My cake was very done at 35 minutes from this recipe.  Sometimes this cake (from another recipe I have) takes 45 minutes.  I didn't change a thing!  Glad I checked it at 35 minutes.  Delicious.

I love this recipe and everyone who eats it asks for the recipe. I just made it again for someone's birthday at work (their request) and am taking 3 copies of the recipe to work to share.  I have probably shared it with over 30 people.  One person made it 3 times in one week and called it "That  Cake" because she gained five pounds that week. This recipe is practically perfect. I did reduce the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and I like it better that way. I also put the walnuts on top of the frosting instead of in the frosting because it looks nice that way. The frosting should be put on the hot cake. It will melt at first but as the cake cools it will set up. If you taste the frosting right after you beat it and then taste it after it has been put on the hot cake and cooled, it is better put on the hot cake.
