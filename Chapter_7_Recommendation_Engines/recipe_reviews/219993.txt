Pretty good, you need to really make sure the pasta is completely drained and really cold. And if you add fruit, be careful of it's liquid level as well.

I bought some chocolate noodles and then didnâ€™t know what to do with them.  So glad I found this recipe.  All I can say is YUM!!! Who knew?!  Husband and both kids loved it.  This is delicious and a fun novelty dessert.
