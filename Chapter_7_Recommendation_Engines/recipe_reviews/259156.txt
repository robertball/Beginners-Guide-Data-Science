The batter was DELICIOUS. Definitely becoming a staple cake in my home. However, if you love yourself you'll omit the ice cream portions entirely. Or if you're a bit of a masochist like myself, have fun deconstructing and reconstructing a cake that's partially melted and entirely soaked. Use the Fluff for a dirty icing to hold it together, and get it to its final destination before the whipping cream decides it's not whipped anymore. Other than that it was absolutely amazing
