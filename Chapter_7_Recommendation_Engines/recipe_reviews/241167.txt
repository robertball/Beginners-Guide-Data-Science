100% beautiful! We had this with fresh salad mix and garlic bread. The salad mix had some small berries and nuts, so when we alternated between the fish and the salad, they caused some serious flavor explosions in our mouths! Great recipe and definitely a keeper! Thanx!

This is so very tasty!!  Our grill time was longer but we had a large half of steelhead and so expected it.  We also cooked it with Meyer lemons.  Easy, simple and so delicious.

Bought the large lemons and it worked perfectly. I will cook any fish with choice of seasoning this way. Fish was tender and moist with slight infusion of lemon. Did prepare the way recipe stated and was flavorful.

We never had Trout before. We followed the recipe and boy it was terrific!!!  We wouldn't change it.  Definitely going to make this again.  Very simple!
