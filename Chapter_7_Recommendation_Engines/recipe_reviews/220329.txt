I am thrilled to be the first one to review and photograph this wonderful recipe.  What a treat it was to wake up, turn on the oven, pop in this coffee cake, and then have a house smelling like cinnamon.  This is very easy to mix together the night before, and you won't be disappointed that you took the time to do it.  This cake rose beautifully, the texture was very light and moist, and the taste was crazy good.  The next time that I make this, I'm going to add some chopped apples just for a variation.  Maridele,  thanks for introducing me to your fabulous coffee cake recipe; going into my Favorites folder.

I made half of this recipe in an 8” springform pan.  The only changes I made were to omit the nutmeg as I’m not a fan, added 1/2 t. vanilla, and I increased the pecans to around 1/3 cup for my half recipe.  Other than that I followed the recipe as written.  I love the fact that you can make this ahead.  Maridele, this is a wonderful coffee cake.  We really enjoyed it and I’ll definitely be making it again.  Thank you!

Great recipe - delicious, light and moist.  I prepared in a 9 x 13 glass dish and placed in refrigerator last night, this morning I removed and allowed to warm on the counter before placing in oven.  I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract.  Next time I make it, I will add 1 teaspoon of salt because I used unsalted butter.  Thanks for sharing Maridele - it is a keeper and we enjoyed it!

EXCELLENT!  I love the crunch from the topping.  After several mornings of realizing I forgot to make the batter, I decided to go ahead and make it without any refrigeration.  If it didn't turn out, it would be no fault of the recipe and no one would know.  Well, I can shout out "IT WORKS" and what a treat it was!  Although I had to leave out the nuts due to a diet restriction, it was fabulous!  Thank you Maridele for sharing such a wonderful recipe!

This recipe is easy and delicious even for those of us who don't plan ahead and forget to put it together the night before.  I made a batch this morning start to finish and it turned out delicious!  Thanks for sharing your wonderful recipe with us Maridele!

Maridele,

Thank you very much for this recipe.  It's easy & delicious.  I'm not a great baker; so I was thrilled that a cake I made from scratch came out so good.  I added about 3/4 cup of blueberries and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to the batter, also reduced the nutmeg to 1/2 tsp.
Can't wait to make this again.  As another reviewer said, next time I would put a layer of the topping in the middle too.
                                       Thanks again,
                                       Mimi S.

Very simple from scratch coffee cake. Made this for our church breakfast on Easter morning. I loved that I could make it the night before and just pop it into the oven. The cinnamon sugar and pecan topping reminds me of German roasted nuts. Yummy!

This is the second coffee cake I've made, and the second one that tasted awesome but had a really over-moist texture. Considering it's a totally different recipe than the last one I made, I know it's something I did, not the recipe itself. I did use plain yogurt instead of sour cream, but it definitely wasn't that that screwed it up, since I swap yogurt in recipes all the time with great success, and the other recipe for coffee cake I used didn't require sour cream to begin with. The biggest change I made was scaling it down to an 8x8 pan, but yet again, I'm sure that's not the problem. I've really got to figure out what I'm doing wrong here! Either way, the flavor was awesome, just like I wanted, but again, something I'm doing is giving me a slightly more bread-pudding-like texture than I'd like.

I like that u can prepare it day ahead. Baked this Easter morning and my family really enjoyed it.  They said it tasted better than a more complicated one I usually make because it was lighter,  and more moist!

This is terrific first thing in the morning with your coffee. Making it the night before makes it so much easier to have the fresh baked goodness bright and early.  I omitted the pecans due to allergy and added a bit more cinnamon...the whole house smelled great as an added bonus.

I love finding a great recipe that I can make in advance and bake the following morning for breakfast or brunch.  This coffee cake was wonderful – ideal flavor and texture.  I’m not a fan of nutmeg so I did half nutmeg, half cinnamon and it was perfect for us.  This is a keeper.

This was such a nice treat on a cold and rainy Sunday morning! I had everything prepared the night before and slipped the cake into the oven while the coffee perked.  As the kids woke up they said the house smelled like Christmas.  It was a very nice and easy going morning we all enjoyed.  I did sub soy cream cheese for the dairy version.  I also used sodium free baking powder and sodium free baking soda.  I added some home made vanilla to the batter and omitted the salt.  I used a coffeecake bunt pan and dusted with powdered sugar to finish it off.  I think I will make these for Christmas presents for my neighbors this year as we enjoyed it so much.  Thanks for the recipe!

So easy -- it was great to wake up the family to the enticing smell of the innamon-laden topping.  This is a wonderful and simple treat for brunch or any weekend breakfast.

I was pleasantly surprised with this and received some nice compliments. I made it exactly as written except for using cinnamon instead of nutmeg in the cake. Having to assemble this after making Christmas Eve dinner for family & friends, I measured all the dry ingredients ahead of time and put them in baggies in the pan I was going to use so all I had to do was add them to the wet ingredients and sprinkle the already mixed topping. I made this along with an egg breakfast casserole putting them both in the oven at the same time and cut up fresh fruit. It was an easy breakfast to serve while opening gifts! Thanks!

I was short on supplies, so made several changes which still turned out fabulous! Use 1/2 c. sugar and 1/3 c honey for the 1 c. sugar in the original recipe. Only put in 1/2 tsp nutmeg since it can be overpowering. Used 1 c. greek yogurt instead of 8 oz. sour cream. Gently folded 2 c. fresh raspberries into the batter. Used hazelnuts instead of pecans. Turned out AMAZING! Very moist and the berries really shined. This is a keeper!

This cake is absolutely amazing. It is perhaps the best coffee cake I have ever had. I prepared it using flaxseed meal and water as an egg substitute - my youngest daughter had an egg allergy for a long time and we discovered we loved the flavor it added to our dishes, so even though she's outgrown her allergy we still use the substitute. However, everything else we kept the same. We didn't let it sit, we just put it together and placed it in the oven. It turned out amazing! Even my food snob of a brother who lives with me said it was delicious. I highly recommend this dish for anyone with a craving for coffee cake!

Quick to put together.  Bakes up tender and moist. I have a DD who hates nuts so I put chocolate chips and only a little cinnamon and brown sugar on 1/4 of the top and it was just as good.  May try adding blueberries to the inside of the cake next time.

I've tried other coffee cakes before but we really enjoyed this one. The added feature that you can make the coffee cake ahead is a plus for me especially on busy holidays.

Soft and delicious. Just the right amount of sweetness, too. I added extra nuts (because I always do), but that was my only change. I served this with the Jimmy Dean Breakfast Casserole recipe, and it was a winning combo for a picnic brunch.

This was an epic fail for me..... I tried to use a bunt pan and there was not the room that the cake needed to rise, luckily I alway have a cookie sheet under everything, also in my mixer the batter wasn't really a pour more of a scoop into the pan

This is the most moist coffee cake I have ever had! I love that this is made the night before and just popped into the oven in the morning.  I would probably add some of the streusel in with the coffee cake instead of putting it all on the top.  I also folded in 2 cups fresh blueberries.  Its a hit!!

Loved he recipe especially making the night before.  I cooked 33 minutes and it was very moist, and well received by my family.  My only change would be to use less nutmeg.  To my taste buds, it was a little too strong instead of being complementary.  Other than that, a great coffee cake!

Wonderful!  Simple to make, smells great, and is light, moist and yummy!  I added a touch of cinnamon to the batter and a teaspoon of vanilla too.  Made a 9x13 and gave a few plates away!  After my husband and I sampled 2 pieces each, we made sure to keep a plate for ourselves too, although I woudn't mind making another batch soon!  Thanks for sharing the great recipe!  Preparing brunch was so much easier just having to pull this out of the fridge and popping it in the oven!

Baked this for a bake sale on a shopping area sidewalk. It sold well and several shoppers returned to buy more, issue compliments, and ask for recipe. It's not unusual or spectacular - just exactly what folks expect from a great coffee cake.

Brought this to work today.  Very good, but I made it and baked it all the same day.  The topping would have been better if it were a streusel, mine was more brown sugary.  Nutmeg I reduced a little, just grated some over the batter.  I used pear yogurt and a spoonful of sour cream, next time I would use all sour cream.  Overall, good flavor.  Also, I only baked 25 minutes - it would have been dry if I had gone a minute longer.

DS was having a friend over today and they both had requested coffee cake. I don't make many, so I hit allrecipes... found this recipe, read the reviews and whipped it together last night. Baked it this morning. I will say, it was absolutely lovely! Light and airy. I will say it took much longer to bake than the recipe stated, but that could be our altitude. I think it is a fabulous base for making many different, tasty versions and no one will know it is all the same base recipe! Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is easy to make and so tasty its a keeper.Thank you Maridele.
What is strange is its title why is it called a coffee cake when coffee is not included in the ingredients list? 
Nice cake though.

Maybe I’m the only one who had unexpected issues... my sugar and butter didn’t take anywhere near 2 minutes of beating to be light and fluffy and then started to harden, so I stopped.  After adding the eggs and sour cream it never got smooth, and after adding the flour mixture it turned into a stiff dough that was had to spread in the floured pan.  I usually bake with unsalted butter...is that the problem?

This recipe was amazing and super easy to make. Instead of pecans I crunched up graham crackers for an added crunch. A really fun dish to make.

I absolutely love this recipe! 
I could not wait until the next day, so I popped it in the oven and had some seriously good strudel deliciousness.  The sugar amount is perfect and the fluffyness is amazing. It is a very light cake yummy with morning coffee. I divided de mix into 18 cupcakes to easily be able to know the size of a portion and really just do not overfill the cupcake mold and leave enough room for the pecans. It is yummy!

This turned simply scrumptious. I sort of miss a more streusel topping but still it was delightful tasting. The streusel would only be a texture thing. Making sure not to over mix it is key I think. Oh...and the nutmeg was so good, I've missed as I haven't made anything with it since the holidays...I just love it.

Wonderful coffee cake. I was having a friend over for coffee in the morning so I ran to the store at 10pm and whipped it up by 11. I was a little nervous about serving a cake before trying it but it was terrific. It was not dry at all. I misread the intructions and used half the amount of nutmeg and it was just right, not overpowering at all. I will make it again for sure.

Very nice ...except I made and baked right away. It was delicious and moist. I used a 10' round spring form and had no problems with rising or releasing from the pan. Next time I will sprinkle some of the topping in the middle of the cake as well. Thanks!

This was the perfect texture -- both moist and light. The only change I made was to use Penzey's baking spice blend in place of both the nutmeg and the cinnamon. Also, I used sour cream with a 25% fat content (which I think is a bit higher than standard American sour cream); based how well that worked and on some of the other reviews, this may not be a good recipe to try and cut calories with low-fat sour cream or yogurt....The only change I might make in the future is to concur with other reviewers and add an additional 1/4-1/2 tsp. salt if using unsalted butter.

I love making this coffee cake. It’s easy and delicious. I do take the nutmeg down a notch as I’m not a huge fan of it but it does give it a little something. It’s a hit with everyone.

Followed recipe but didn't turn out at all, stuck in my bundt pan and was undercooked even though left for ten more minutes. But maybe blame this cook, the recipe sounded amazing, I just won't be baking it again

Update on the recipe. I made it the night before and popped it in the oven when I got up. Brought it to pot luck. Next time I would like to incorporate the topping into the mix so it's like a swirl.  Maybe use a bundt pan. Next time I'll try adding a little vanilla extract.

I'm so glad I found this recipe!  I make it every year for Christmas.  I mix it up on Christmas Eve in the afternoon and put it into the fridge overnight.  Christmas morning I preheat and pop it in while the kids are opening gifts.  By the time they are finished the coffee cake is ready and it is always a big hit with any family that pops by.

This is definitely a keeper.  I followed the recipe exactly and refrigerated overnight.  It made a light, moist cake and the topping was not overly sweet.  I'll be making this again.  It would be perfect for Christmas morning brunch.

Haven't tasted it just yet, but it didn't raise very much.  I'm quite disappointed in that.  I did everything exactly like the recipe called for.

This is by far the best coffee cake I've ever made and it's super easy.I made a few changes,I used only 3/4 cup white sugar.I also used all spice instead of nutmeg plus I used a bunt pan.I made a little extra pecan and sugar mix,sprinkle some at bottom of pan,then I put 1/2 the batter in pan,sprinkle rest of pecan mix then put rest of batter in pan.I also served warm with a spoonful of ice cream.My new go to dessert!

We we all thoroughly enjoyed this. I made a mistake and dumped the cinnamon into the batter (thought it was the nutmeg) so I measured out more for the topping. It wasn't a bad mistake and gave it even more flavor. I also used walnuts for the topping and ground them up well because my dad can't eat nuts unless they are very finely chopped. These were my only changes but it was perfect. Moist, flavorful and quick to put together. I loved having it ready to cook Christmas morning. Thank you for a great recipe!

Excellent!  I love things that can be assembled ahead of time, but baked just when you're ready to eat it.  I made no changes at all.  This is a very thick batter - much thicker than I'm used to for a coffee cake, and I'll admit I was a little concerned, but it was perfect!  It's a little heavier cake, but not at all dry.  I'll be making this one again!

This was a delicious coffee cake. I did however add some butter to the streusel topping before adding it to the cake. Also added a handful of chopped hazelnuts in addition to the pecans. I mixed half the streusel topping in the middle of the cake, and half on top. Just a wonderful treat. I baked the cake after having made the batter- did not wait overnight.

Followed directions baked for 40 minutes and the centre was still liquid. Added a further 20 minutes and the top was overdone. Going to make it in a bundt pan next time. Also  way too much sugar for me. It was really messy and too sweet. I think I would try to incorporate it by  put 
half the sugar and nuts on top of half of the batter and then put the rest of the batter on.  Also I used Greek yogurt instead of sour cream.

The best part of this dish is the "make ahead" idea.  No mess in the morning!  I did add 1 tsp vanilla to the wet ingredients and a pinch of cinnamon to the actual batter.  The batter was think, almost like icing, so I was concerned when spreading it into the pan that I had mis-measured, but it came out great.  Next time, I might add a splash of some sort of liquid (milk, almond milk, half and half,, etc...) to thin it out.  I will make it again!  It was a big hit.  I  might have over baked it by 5 minutes because I missed the timer, but that's my fault, not that of the recipe, but I will be sure to start checking for "doneness" earlier next time.

I used half wheat and half white flour. I would recommend adding 1 tsp of vanilla in the dough. I think this made it a little less moist so added 2-3 tbsp of cream to the mix to soften it up. I also divided the dough in half and spooned half of the dough out in the pan, then spread it out, and put half of the crumble mixture on. Then spooned the second half of the dough in the pan, spread out, and put the remaining half of crumble mixture on top.  Next time, I may take the second half of the crumble mixture (the one that goes on top) and add a couple of tbsp of butter in so that it sticks together instead of being so crumbly.  I mixed my crumble mixture in my mini food processor. This caused the pecans to be very finely ground which suited my children who supposedly don't like nuts!! ;-)

Made this on Christmas Day. It was a hit with the family! It was easy to make but delicious. The only thing I changed was to reduce white sugar to 2/3 cup. Came out perfect. Will definitely make it again! Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This is a great recipe!  Everyone I bring it to has a big happy smile before and after they eat it!  The smell is divine and it's easier than pie!  I have made it both putting it together the day before and immediately before company comes.... both ways work, no reason to deny yourself because you didn't plan ahead!  I have made it gluten free by substituting the flour cup for cup, though sometimes I add a couple of grated apples to the recipe as well and if I have them, cranberries for some festive color-  other fruits are fun to add too!

Made for the first time & will make again soon! Changes I made were 1/2 the amt of nutmeg, substituted cinnamon. 6oz sour cream instead if 8oz but added approximately 1/3 cup strong coffee. And for the topping I added butter cut into the sugar & nut mixture & extra nuts. The batter was very thick & was afraid the cake would be too dense & dry but it was fluffy & moist very yummy!

This turned out great! I was pretty skeptical of the 1tsp of nutmeg and almost changed it, but I went with the recipe as written and it was great.  moist, great texture, and EASY, which is a plus

I love this recipe.  You can make it ahead of time or bake it right away.  I've added blueberries, raspberries and tonight I will add fresh peaches.  Adaptable and delicious.  Thanks for posting it!

The only change I made was to half the recipe and put in an 8"x8" casserole dish. It was good - just not the best I've had, it was a bit dry. Can't beat the convenience, though!

Awesome cake! We were asked to bring a coffee cake to church one Sunday, and I'd never made one before. This cake was so easy, but it was really moist and delicious! My pan was the first one emptied, which was sad (because I didn't have any left to take back home).

I'm giving it 5 stars b/c everyone said it was wonderful. I thought it was good but I would give it 4.5 stars if I could. I didn't bake it exactly as directed. I used a bundt pan and doubled the topping. I layered 1/2 the batter, put in 1/2 the doubled topping and then the rest of the batter. It looked and tasted great but it didn't keep long. It was a bit drier than I would have liked.

I followed the recipe to the letter... almost. I greased my glass 9X13 dish with coconut oil and skipped the flouring. It yielded such a nice result with no sticking, I will certainly do it again!
