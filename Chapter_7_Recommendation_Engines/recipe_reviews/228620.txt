Great family-picnic cole slaw.  Orange juice gives an interesting kick and sweetness.  I have made it several times, and I think now that the overall amount of the sauce should be increased by about 50%, and the OJ increased by double.  This may leave you with extra sauce (maybe for chicken salad tomorrow?), but you are able to add sauce to acquire the "wetness" that you want in cole slaw.  Good stuff !!!

I love this recipe. I did not have white balsamic so used the regular/dark balsamic. I felt it needed a little more dressing. So I added 1/2 more of the dressing recipe. FYI - I used two bags of shredded cole slaw instead of the cabbage and carrots. It was great!

I love this recipe. I made this along with the Texas Pulled Pork from All Recipes & it was a hit. I used a 2 lb bag of shredded cole slaw & felt it was a little dry so I added 1/2 more of the ingredients. I also used someone's suggestion & used pineapple juice instead of orange juice. It was wonderful!

I used regular balsamic vinegar.  But what the heck it was just the family and beige is a color that goes with everything.  Awesome recipe!!!  Thanks.

Excellent! Used all low fat options in the mayo and sour cream. I also did not have white balsamic so I used my regular balsamic vinegar. I also used 3 small (coffee packets) of Stevia non sugar sweetner instead of the white sugar. Sure the balsamic tinted this slaw an odd color....lol....but it was delicious!I also love the addition of the orange juice. Next time I will add some orange zest as well to bring out that orange flavor. I also added some green onions to this and used a store bought slaw mix. Excellent with shredded BBQ pork! Thanks!

Creamy flavorful and oh so good. I didn't have white balsamic vinegar so I used the balsamic I had on hand so my co slaw was a little creamy in color it didn't change how good it was.

This recipe is delicious!! OJ? Who would have thunk it! I used one bag of shredded cabbage and carrots ('slaw' mix) for the amount of sauce (but could have easily used two bags, if I had as many). I also substituted the vinegar for apple cider vinegar.

Very good. I tweaked it for personal preference (1/2 the sugar, double the orange juice, and half light sour cream/half light mayo). I was just making it for two and used 1/3 the recipe for half of a 14 oz bag of coleslaw mix.  That made about four servings.

I used only one head of cabbage instead of two to solve the sauce issue so many speak of here. Adjusted mayo down to one cup and upped the sour cream to a half cup. Doubled the pepper to half a teaspoon and added a half teaspoon of sea salt. Took the orange juice to 2 tablespoons, it's a really great part of this recipe. Yeah I changed quite a bit but this coleslaw turned out really good with these fixes.

A favorite for my daughter and I.  In the summers I will substitute the cabbage for garden fresh red kohlrabi cut into match-stick size pieces.

The serving guide is way off! To make enough slaw for 32 adults, it said to by 6 heads of cabbage. Way, way too much. Needed maybe 1.5 to 2 heads! I now have 4 heads leftover. Guess l'll have to be creative with the remaining cabbage.

I have not made it, but since i must rate  it to post  i temporarily give 4 stars based on other reviews. I have a question and will be glad if anyone could give me an answer. Am very new to the use of vinegar in cooking. Will a White wine Vinegar do in the place of the balsamic vinegar?

Delicious! Used regular balsamic vinegar because I didn't have white so it looks light brown... but I would use this on/in other stuff too, like tuna salad or just as a sandwich spread, even a veggie dip!

Agreed with all other people in the review - doubled-up the sauce or cut half on the cabbage & carrot which was how I made mine. Big success!! The orange juice definitely added merits into it.

This makes a large bowl  of coleslaw, so good for a crowd. I thought it was very good, but there was a pool of sauce in the bottom of the bowl. A bit soupy, might decrease the amount of buttermilk. I like to shred the cabbage in my food processor, as sometimes that bagged cabbage has a funny taste, and also less expensive.

Super easy.  If you buy packaged coleslaw this can be done in under  10 minutes.   We really didn't taste the orange juice but it did have a nice sweet taste.

What a great tasting recipe!! Made it for our fire station shift dinner to go with pulled pork. Orange adds good sweetness and some zest to it. I bought way too big a cabbage so didn't use the 2 1/2 it called for but oh well. I used dark balsamic by accident but it didn't hurt it at all. A must make!

The only thing I did differently  the first time was use "cheater" cabbage.  My family and I really love this recipe.  I have also made it using only sour cream, and it is every bit as good.  It is  just the thing to ser e with "Perfect Pulled Pork" on "Burger or Hot Dog Rolls" also on this site.

I mad a much smaller batch so I adjusted everything accordingly, except I added a bit more balsamic and a bit more orange juice. I didn't have actual juice so I used clementines. My husband said it was the best coleslaw he has ever had :) I will definitely make this again.

01-16-16 ~ Having friends for dinner, I was looking for a sweet cole slaw.  This fit the bill, nicely.  I was out of sour cream, so I used Greek yogurt in it's place.  The dressing had a slight sweetness to it without being overly sweet.  It paired nicely with 'Roast Pork with Maple and Mustard Glaze' and 'Pumpkin Cheese Bread' both from AR.

Great recipe but I also added more Mayo and sour cream, a little sweet onion and a sprinkling of Old Bay for that "Seaside" flair. In my opinion.....ANY coleslaw should be made the day before and allowed to marinate over night in the fridge.

I used this recipes with 1 1lb bag of progressed cole slow cabbage.  Worked well with that amount of cabbage.  Not sure if this would have been enough for 2-1/2 heads of cabbage.  The flavor was delicious though.  I didnt detect the orange juice like I thought I would.  Almost reminds me of KFC.

Added zest and 2 tablespoons of fresh orange juice. I added a jalapeno with seeds removed and celery seed. The total mixture has a fresh and vibrant flavor. I have made many cole slaw recipes and this is the best so far. T Gerber
