This recipe totally rocked!  I have never had such tender juicy pork chops.  The only thing I changed was maple syrup for the corn syrup (because I didn't have any corn syrup on hand).  Thanks for a great recipe!

These are just great! Don't normally use corn syrup in a brine, but it imparted a bright, smoky note! Perfect grill food. Thanks for the recipe.

My husband and I run a bar/grill and have served these chops for a lunch special - the customers LOVED the flavor.  We served them with mashed potatoes and gravy.

This recipe was just ok for my family. They didn't like the overall flavor and frankly, prefer our regular chops.

I was hopeful that this recipe would make pork chops tastey for my husband who doesn't like them.  But Nope.  He did not like the taste of the marinade and ours were not very tender.

This was really good. To be honest, I have brined chops before ( not this recipe) and thought that they were only ok. I wasn't really planning on using the technique for pork chops again, but I got these super thick pork chops from Costco and I figured that if I didn't brine them there was no way that they wouldn't be at least a little dry. So I found this recipe and went for it. I used Heineken, and apple cider vinegar instead of red wine. I used half Dijon and half Stone Ground Mustard. I ended up not cooking  these when I thought I was going to, and after 24 hours I was worried about over brining them, so I pulled them out of the brine and basted them with BBQ sauce, then cooked them the next evening. They were fantastic, SO moist and flavorful. The brine really kept them juicy. I have more of these chops in the freezer (like I said, Costco special) and I plan on using this brine a lot more in the future! Great Recipe!

Super easy & very yummy.  I only marinated it for 5 hours & will definitely marinate it for 24 hours next time.  Also, I cut the pepper back to 1 teaspoon & will probably add more salt next time.  I also used spicy brown mustard & maple syrup in place of the corn syrup.

My husband loved these chops, couldn't stop praising the flavor.  I substituted dark ale instead of beer, and made a quick syrup from water and brown sugar instead of corn syrup.  They marinated an extra day because we ran out of time to fix them when originally planned, so more like 40 hours marinade time.  I tasted no beer flavor, just incredibly tender pork.  We'll make this one again!

I have cooked this recipes many times! It just gets better and better! You don't have to be a beer drinker to enjoy this wonderful dish. I cooked it as is and made only minor changes in the seasoning amount to suit my taste. It is so good, I plan on cooking it for an upcoming event for a large crowd.
