I used toasted pecans,& added some chopped marachino cherries to cake. Lightened cream cheese icing with cherry juice. It was a GREAT  HIT with all. Had many requests for recipe.

I wouldn't rate five stars, but it is very simple to make, and I don't think you'd ever go wrong with these ingredients.  The crushed pineapple made it very moist and added good flavor.  Next time, I'd use pecans instead of walnuts, but that's just my taste preference.  Used pineapple cream cheese frosting from this site, and added some almond extract to kick up the flavor a bit.

I did not like this recipe at all.  I used a cherry chip cake mix, and even though the pinapple juice did make the cake moist, I did not like the taste of the pinapple chuncks in the cake.  I felt that it just did not go well.  I also found this cake to be rather dry, and had a lot of trouble getting it out of the cake pans.  The cake ripped while trying to remove from both cake pans.  I notice that this cake receipe does not call for any oil, I think that had something to do with it.  Now I see why most cake recipies call for at least a cup of oil.

I also tried making a cherry cream cheese frosting by mixing cherry kool-aid with butter, cream cheese and icing sugar.  Even though the cherry kool-aid gave the icing a nice red cherry colour, it did not taste good at all.  I won't try using kool-aid in a frosting receipe again.  I ended up throwing out 3/4 of the cake.
