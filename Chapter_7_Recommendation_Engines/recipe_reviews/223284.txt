This pie is absolutely scrumptious.  Best to use firm ripe peaches. My recipe calls for 6 firm-ripe peaches, 3/4 cup sugar and 1/4 cup of flour.  Cover pie with foil only if it's getting too brown.  Everything else is the same.  The crust is out of this world.  It's tender and flakey and is perfect for those who hate to roll out pie dough.  I use it for all my baked custard pies, like pumpkin and pecan, because it doesn't get soggy.  Excellent recipe. Updated since 2011:   I have started using a streusel topping on this pie..Use your favorite streusel, brown or white sugar.  I use white sugar and crush some sliced almonds into it. Makes it look so pretty and adds a little crunch to the top.

Sooooo good, sooooo easy & 5 stars all the way.  I used light sour cream and Splenda blend, and it still was delicious.  The pie crust is done in seconds in the food processor, is tender, and you don't even have to roll it out, just press into the pie dish.  Absolutely wouldn't change a thing; it's perfect as is.

I have made this recipe for YEARS. Only we call it Peach Torte! Doubled recipe goes into a 9 x 13 pan.  I sprinkle the top with cinnamon.  Really good with apples,too!

Have made 4 times: first time as written. Came out well, fresh peach flavor comes through. Family wanted some crumble topping with nuts/oats,butter, flour, sugar). Second time with low fat sour cream and half sugar substite. Third time: FULL FAT greek yogurt and 2/3 of the amount of real sugar. Final time (winner, winner): Full fat greek yogurt, 2/3 of the total sugar, uncover @50 min, top with your favorite crumble topping, and continue until set. Refrigerate. Acceptable substitutions with no taste/texture sacrifice, imho.

I followed this recipe exactly! I was worried the filling would never set, after the 50 minutes, I removed the foil and baked the extra 15 minutes. But the center seemed runny, so I baked another 15 minutes, but the same thing? I figured the egg/cream mixture had to be cooked, so I removed it! Thankfully I did! I let it cool to room temp. and then let it set up in the fridge. It was so Delicious!!! Very creamy! I think my peaches were very ripe which is why there seemed to be more liquid on top, but it did not affect the final outcome, this will be a favorite around here for sure!

This is my absolute favorite recipe. I'm not a huge pie person, but this is definitely the exception to the rule. I can't stop eating it! The pie crust is flakey and buttery and the pie is the perfect balance of tart and sweetness. Although the recipe is simple and easy to make, you can tell after the first bite that every ingredient’s main purpose is to highlight the natural flavors of the peaches. They key here is to use fresh, ripe peaches! Don't use canned or frozen and don't use skim sour cream... there's a reason for each ingredient. If you absolutely must add your own flare, I suggest spices such as cinnamon, nutmeg, etc... but I insist you try it at least once as is, you won't be disappointed!

I'm not a pie maker but I loved this recipe. I've made it three times now. I finally switched from flour to cornstarch for the filling, which kept coming out runny. Also tried mixing 1-2 tablespoons if cornstarch into peaches after I cut them into smaller bite size pieces. Also have used filling in a prepared pie crust..hubby loves it.

I think this may be my first time rating a recipe after several years of getting great recipes from this site. I have to tell you, though.... This pie is WONDERFUL! Don't forget to try with vanilla ice cream - yummy! Sounds really strange to put sour cream in a peach pie, but it works beautifully. I fully intended to give half of it away, but my husband wouldn't let me. I can't believe we ate the whole thing! I'm making it again this weekend for 4th of July, and I'm certain it will become a Thanksgiving staple. We had hundreds of peaches from a tree in the back yard; Thanks to gent500 for the great recipe. Perfect.

Delicious...mixed in some fresh mango....I added tapioca to mixture to absorb extra liquid and it worked.   Filling seemed a little loose, but firmed up in the frig.     Do put a pan under pie for spill overs.   And do heavily grease pie plate.   Hard to get out of pie plate after being in the frig.  Quick.   Easy.  And great rating...

Subsituted with fat free sour cream and doing exactly as directions , pie never cooked to firmness..I baked literally for 2 1/2 hrs, even used speed bake for last half hour. Still was soggy inside. But It did have a great taste. Maybe fat free sour cream was the problem.

I saved this recipe for the crust, however the filling was tasty but I found it to runny. I did add a crumble crust the last 20 minutes of baking which helped alot with the consistency

I used the filling recipe but converted it into a crisp with a standard oatmeal and nut topplng, omitting the crust.  I made two changes, based on previous comments.  First I cut the sugar in half because of comments that it was too sweet and my own preference for less sweet pastries.  Second, because of comments that it failed to set up and remained too liquid, I used tapioca instead of flour to thicken.  With these changes, it was an oustanding peach pastry.

First of all, baking is definitely not my forte.  Plain and simple, I can't bake from scratch.  I have tried all kinds of recipes.  No matter how simple they are, they never come out right.  That is, until I found this recipe.  I must confess, I used nectarines instead of peaches and I left the skin on.  To let you know how good it was, my husband moaned and groaned when he took a bite and he HATES any kind of fruit pie.  It was very simple to make and I really surprised myself at how well it turned out.  I will have to make another one for tomorrow for our guests, since this one probably won't last the night thanks to my husband.

Made this twice... I used fresh firm peaches... However, I also had a problem with the baking time... Both times I made this recipe,  I baked way longer and still had a bit of a problem with the pie turning out a bit runny...  Crust is great! Easy to make, overall the pie was really good, just didn't set up like pie should....

I never post anything and I never make pies. This was easy and delicious. I used coconut oil and butter to grease the pie dish. I used 1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup brown sugar and added 1/2 tap of cinnamon. I had to use greek yogurt I didn't have any sour cream. I was so pleased how it turned out. I wonder how rhubarb would taste or blueberries??

Like most other reviewers, I must say this is a real good pie. I used 6-7 fresh peaches and reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup. I baked it for 60 minutes + 20 minutes or so. After taking it out and leaving it into the fridge for 15 minutes, we couldn't wait anymore and even though the custard was still a little runny, we enjoyed the pie very much. I think it will be even better tomorrow once it's completely chilled. I still have peaches, so I'll make another one to bring to work on Monday!!

OMG! Heavenly pie - if you like peaches you have to try this pie. Easy and turned out perfect. I will use this crust for lots of other deserts too. Crust is awesome! Only enhancement I made was an oatmeal crumble topping added in the last 15 min uncovered bake time. 
This pie makes me want to go buy up all the in season peaches and can or freeze just so that I can it several times this winter!

Delish! Especially when made with a crumb topping as suggested by several reviewers. But then the crust isn't essential since it becomes a crisp... Four peaches was too much for my crust though - the sauce spilled out onto the pan I luckily set underneath. Perhaps use a deep-dish crust but then I never eat the crust anyway so... Peach Crisp it is!

I made this pie with a pinch of ginger and a touch of cinnamon. It smelled wonderful. Can't wait to taste. The texture looks right. This my first peach pie. Some fresh whip cream will do the trick. The flavor was great. The filling was set yet creamy. Thanks, Happy Cooking!

At the suggestion of another, I used nectarines, as I don't like touching the fuzz of a peach.  Other than that, followed the recipe scrupously, and it was delicious.

I was hesitant when looking nice at the ingredients, but based on all the raves I decided to give it a try. After all, it seemed easy enough to try it. Sure enough, the pie came out exquisite! I followed the recipe as is and noticed it was a tad "runny". However, if you let it bake 20-30 min more and let it cool AND then set in refrigerator for 30 mins you have a perfectly set filling!! I am trying again but this time with less sugar. It was a little on the "too sweet" side and I feel it will be even more delicious when it's subtly sweet and let's the peaches really steal the show. Great recipe! Had to make my first review here after using his website for years! Def a must try!!! Huge hit with my family ????

This was sweet, tangy, delicious.  Just make sure you grease the pie plate really well or it will be impossible to serve in once nice piece.  Also, make sure all the peaches are submerged in the egg mixture or they will dry out when cooking.

I don't have a food processor so I made the crust using the traditional method which was a little difficult.  It didn't come together in a ball until I added a bit of water, then I could pull it into a ball with my hands.  The taste of the crust is nice, almost like a shortbread, (must be due to the sour cream) even my husband commented that he liked it.  I read all of the reviews before making this pie.  The reviews nearly scared me off from even trying it.  All I can say is, this has a custard-type base, it will be a bit jiggly in the oven, but it will set up as it cools.  Not into a firm solid, but a soft, creamy filling (that holds it's shape) surrounded by peaches.  Afterall, it is a peaches and cream pie!  That being said, I did bake it for some additional minutes (maybe 20) to be sure it would set.  The taste of the filling is great!  I wasn't sure what to expect with the addition of sour cream, but it was soooooo good!  My pie looks just like the featured picture.  Yum!

This recipe is EXCELLENT! My only suggestion would be to adjust the sugar content to the ripeness of your peaches. However, try the recipe as is first so you can later figure out how much sugar you may need the next time you make it again. The more ripe the peaches the less sugar you will need!

I had such high hopes for this pie. We followed the recipe exactly as written and, while the crust was fantastic, the filling needs work in our opinion. It was much too sweet for our taste. Also, the cooking time was pretty far off. We baked it an additional 25 minutes and, after cooling completely, it was still not fully set.  We will make it again with a few adjustments. The star of this pie is the crust -- I'd give that five stars and the filling 2.5 as written.

This is a real winner! Best peach pie I've had in years. Don't change a thing, just be sure to use really good peaches. No cinnamon necessary! The delicate flavor of the peaches is enhanced by the sour cream. The crust is so flakey and the perfect accompaniment to this custard like filling.

Flavors were spot-on.  I used half nectarines and half white peaches... My only complaint is the pie doesn't hold up very well overnight in the refridgerator.  It became soupy

I made it as described and it was wonderful. Didn't  have peaches, used apricots instead, peeled and treated as the peaches should have. It was yummy, a Little tart, light and sinfully delicious and buttery. Shared with a friend who immedeately asked for the recipe. Will make this again. Thanks for sharing!

I have made this twice. It is so delicious. The first time I used 5 peaches instead of the 4 that the recipe called for and the pie was a little runny. This time, I used 4 peaches and the pie turned out perfectly.

I read the reviews and used 2 tablespoons of corn starch instead of flour. Baked it for 50 minutes uncovered it and there was no jiggle . I will increase the pie ingredient by 1/2 in my next one. This is a great pie. I will use the pie recipe for other pies.

The crust of this pie was incredible. The filling had a great taste but something about the texture was off. It was soggy and wet. Maybe because I used vegan sour cream. But overall I enjoyed it.

I loved this recipe- It is my favorite peach pie recipe.  I followed the review by Susan and used more peaches.  I did find it took longer to cook than indicated, and it still seemed runny when I took it out.  However, it set up just fine and was absolutely delicious.  Will definitely make again!

Awesome!  Dust your peaches with some extra flour if they are really juicy before putting into the crust.  This helped my pie set up  within the baking time. I used half the sugar since my fresh peaches were already so sweet.  We loved the crust!

This is my favorite pie crusts ever- I use it for a lot of pies, not just this one.  It's like shortbread cookies.  For a deep dish, make 1 1/2 the crust recipe, you'll love it!

The stars are only for the ease and taste of the crust. I followed the recipe as is and the middle of the pie never set. Baked the thing almost twice as long. Once I refrigerated overnight it was solid and tasty in the morning.

the custard took 1:45 to set.   Maybe it's because I used lots more peaches than the recipe calls for?  I also used 1/3 c. sugar, which was plenty sweet.

absolutely to recommend: I admit that I cheated, and used a premade crust, I was so in a hurry. But I faithfully followed the direction for everything else (only I just substituted sour cream with yogurt) and it was perfect. everybody wanted to know how I did the wonderful creamy inside of the pie and they were dreading heavy cream and butter and so on, so it was a pleasant surprise for everyone to discover it being much healtier!

This is, I am quite positive, the best peach pie I have ever made and eaten! Since I avoid making my own pie crust at any cost, this crust was a SNAP and my entire family raved over the shortbread-like consistency and taste that perfectly complemented the custard peach filling. We were going to take the second pie over to the neighbor, but only ended up with 2 slices left for sharing! :-)  This is a real keeper!

I followed the recipe exactly only I dont have a food processor, I had to use a blender but nonetheless, the crust came out perfect. I had a similar problem as another baker, after an hour of baking the pie LOOKED great, but when i cut in it was soggy. I cooked it for a whole hour more and in the end tried to increase the temperature, but it never firmed up at all and started to burn. Soggy and burned, I feel like my peaches went to waste. When i cut through the crust though, it wasflaky and done well. Im curious as to what I did wrong.

I took a chance and cut the sugar from 1 cup to 1/2 cup. It was a huge hit!  Very delicious and will make it again!

This pie is delicious!  I had smaller peaches, so I used 5 of them (I accidentally left them in a hot car for a few hours and they ripened up nicely).  Per another reviewer, I used ¾ cup sugar and ¼ cup of flour and baked it uncovered.; it browned and set up perfectly.  I’ve never cared for pie crust, but this is the best tasting crust I’ve ever had.  It’s also the easiest to make, since the food process did all the work and I just pressed it into the pie plate.

Followed directions as written and loved the result. Filling set up nicely with prescribed baking time, however I had a heck of a time with the crust stuck to the pan. I used a dark glass pie plate and buttered it with whipped tub butter(not margerine). Could any of this possibly be the problem? Anyway, I will definitely make this again
 Delicious!!

Without a doubt this is the best pie recipe I have ever made.  I was worried about how long it said to cook.  But it came out perfect.  The crust is the best.  I will use for other pies - so flaky. And so easy to make in the food processor - came out beautiful.  Thanks.

I baked this pie as stated.  It had such a wonderful creamy texture and taste.  I will probably make this every season in the future.

IMade this pie yesterday and had high hopes for it but I was totally disappointed. I followed the recipe exactly but as other people said the filling while it tasted okay didn't set up. Also the crust just wasn't very good. I'm not going to use this recipe again.I'll just stay with my regular crust(which is flakey and tender) and my traditional  homemade peach pie filling.
