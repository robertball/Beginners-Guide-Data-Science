Forgot to mention after you combine the garlic, onion, pear, soy sauce, sugar, honey, & sesame seed oil, taste the sauce. if you want it sweeter you can add more sugar/honey/cola

also instead of honey you can also used cola.

pear is used as a meat tenderizer so you can substitute w/ kiwi or rice wine too!

enjoy!

I have made this a couple times and it's super yummy!  Made it exactly like the recipe states and it drew 2 of my neighbors over to find out what I had on the grill that smelled so good!  I always make extra so that we can have it again for lunch the next day.

In Korea, Galbi is served in lettuce leaves with Ssamchang and sometimes Gojujang - these are spicy condiments and quite tasty. You can probably get them in an Asian grocery store.

This made a delicious dinner for us.  I did have to change a few things (sorry review purists!) because of personal preferences.  I had bonesless short ribs, but this was the recipe I wanted to use.  I only used one cup of sweeteners (about 7/8 cup of brown sugar and a tablespoon or so of honey), and went short on the sesame oil.  I only marinated this for 8 hours, and the taste was very delicious.  I loved how they grill because you get crunchy parts on the edges and the insides were perfectly medium rare and perfect.  I served this over sticky rice, a perfect complement to the meat!  I have more to BBQ waiting for us, and I can't wait!  Thanks for this recipe!

This is one of my favorite dishes from Korea. Just to clarify from the earlier review, Ssamchang is a spicy bean paste and Gojujang is also a paste made from finely crushed red peppers. Served with steamed white rice, this is a great meal.

This is a very good recipe for Korean style marinade. I have an excellent recipe handed down from a Korean friend that I like a bit better but it uses many more ingredients. This recipe is almost as good using half the ingredients of mine. I did tweak this a bit. I didn't have a pear so I used apple sauce instead. I also added some chopped green onions and red pepper flake to the blended mix to give it some authentic Korean kick and I like the slightly charred bits of green onion that inevitably stick to the meat and get grilled along with the meat. Bravo on the recipe! Next time, I try to have a pear on hand for the recipe.

Sooooooooo gooooood! even my non-adventurous-ethnic-eating hubs licked his fingers!  I omitted the step of soaking the ribs and didn't add honey since used sweeten soy sauce. tasted as good as the Korean restaurant!

This recipe is sooo good, I had to sign up on this site to post a review.   I honestly encourage anyone reading my review to TRY THIS recipe!  Im asian and have eaten alot of galbi at restaurants.  This recipe matches with the best Iâ€™ve eaten if not better.  I bought a good cut of short ribs, expensive but so worth it.  Its nicely marbled and less fat then cheap cuts.   I followed the recipe to a T.  Thank you to the poster of this recipe!

Fantastic recipe. I won my family's annual rib competition with this. The only changes I made were as suggested, used kiwi and a splash of rice vinegar instead of Asian pear because the pear is hard to come by in my town. I also added ginger to the marinade.  This recipe is so easy and delicious it will definitely be one of our go to lunches.

I lived and worked as a chef in Seoul for three years and often ate Kalbi with my Korean wife.  While the marinade is close to being authentic, there are a few ingredients missing, the cut of meat is wrong and that is why only 2 stars.  When I was in Seoul, they never served "short" ribs as used in this and other recipes on this site but a rib with a lot of meat attached which was cut and spread out from the bone.  Difficult to describe and I do not have a camera to show what I mean as I am preparing it for some friends tonight for our monthly ethic food gathering .

I cut the recipe in half for my small family and I have to say this recipe mirrors authentic Korean ribs I have had at restaurants.  I am definitely making it again...and again....and again. Oh and the only variance from the recipe is that I used the whole pear and not just half since I didn't want to waste it.  Thank you!

Made as is with addition of green onions to marinade. Marinated over night and grilled on big green egg at about 400 degrees for about 3 min per side. My ribs were quite thin purchased at Buford Highway Farmers Market. We liked this dish and will make it again. Next time I'd like to add ginger to the marinade.

My daughter-in-law made these last night for dinner and they were AMAZING!  We were all new to preparing/eating short ribs but now we're "converts".  Marinating overnight (or longer) seems to make them extra tender and flavourful.

I had a large hanger steak and wanted to use the marinade part of this recipe. It was delicious and my family loved it! The next time I make though, I will definitely reduce the amount of brown sugar significantly. I thought it was too sweet. I'm really curious about the Asian pear being a tenderizer though! I want to try using that in other recipes.

Made this last night and it tasted just like the beef ribs at my favourite local Korean bbq (maybe even better?). I used 3/4 cup of stevia instead of brown sugar to cut back on calories and it still tasted great. Will definitely be making a batch of these to take to BBQs in the future.

This is an awesome recipe!  I make this once every few months for my fiance.  I simply combine all marinade ingredients in a blender and blend them, and let the meat marinate for 2-3 days in a ziplock bag in the fridge.  I use 5 kiwis instead of an asian pear, and I like a little more brown sugar than the recipe calls for.  Also, when it's time to serve them, I like to cut them into segments with my kitchen scissors, which makes for a great hands-on meal!

It. was. AMAZINGGGG!
Didn't have Asian pears on hand, so I substituted with 1/4 of some regular US pear and it turned out ok. The meat would probably be more tender if I had used rice vinegar/kiwi/Asian pear, but it was still delicious. Overall an excellent recipe! 
PS. If you have a salad dressing recipe that tastes similar to KBBQ restaurants (a nice blend of tangy goodness), I am very interested. Thanks!
