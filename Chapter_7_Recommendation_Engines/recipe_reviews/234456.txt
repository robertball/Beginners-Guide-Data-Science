Great starter recipe. I usually mash up half a banana first. Leave out the salt, ground flax and baking powder. Then mix it and cook it in the same bowl not two ramkins. Add a little maple syrup or honey and fresh berries it becomes a great breakfast. I find about a minute and forty seconds in the microwave is perfect.

So easy!  Worked perfectly. Super low-carb & gluten-free. Thanks!!!  UPDATE:  These are fantastic!  I eat them every day.  That much flax is hard on my system, tho, so I subbed 1 T white chia seed meal for 1 of the T flax.  Works great.

I prefer my muffins with just a tad sweetness to them, so I added Stevia sweetened Greek yogurt on top. For those who don't use dairy, you might top yours with coconut yogurt. This made for a fast and easy breakfast. ***Update next day - Since this recipe made two, I refrigerated one. The next day I ate it cold, topped with Greek yogurt, and blueberries. A whole different flavor and very good.

The only changes I made was to add 2 packets of Stevia/Raw Sugar blend and eat with maple syrup. With the changes it is a 4 star, without I would rate it a 3. It has an"eggy" taste a lot of Paleo baked foods have that I had to cut with something sweet. Otherwise, it is a quick fix. To make it even quicker, I may portion out the dry ingredients in baggies and just add the wet when I'm ready to make it!

This is so easy. I like to add a few berries to the mix (chopped strawberries or a few blueberries)and drizzle with honey before eating.

Quick and easy breakfast. I add a teaspoon of honey for a little sweeter muffin. To speed things up I multiplied the dry ingredients by four and put it in a jar in the refrigerator then all I need to do in the morning is grease a cup with coconut oil, beat an egg and a little honey then mix in a quarter of the dry ingredients. About a quarter cup of blueberries and it's perfect!

I made them and they were good but a bit hard so I added a 2 tablespoons of honey to the recipe and they were fluffy and delicious.

I'm new to paleo and am pleasantly surprised by this recipe. It does indeed cook up in 1 minute and really helped with my bread/pasta cravings. I added about 1 tablespoon of chocolate chips into each muffin to make them a dessert. Yum!

This is my second time making these muffins and today is better than last time as I added one whole banana mashed and 1:4 cup of tiny walnut pieces. I also decided to omit all the flax seeds and add 1 tbsp of chia seeds and complete with an additional tbsp of almond flour. To end these muffins in an even higher note, I added blueberries on top of the dough and microwaved the two ramekins together for 2 min (30 sec intervals). It turned down delicious and a little more sweet maybe because of the banana. Very filling and tasty!!!

Good breakfast option that can be changed by adding your favorite fruits, nuts, raisins, craisins, and sweetners if you like. Another option instead of almond flour is ground oats.  Works just as good.  You can use egg whites instead of the eggs if you like and they come out the same. You can also use butter instead of oil if you prefer. For a boost in protein, add a half scoop of protein powder.  A great mid morning snack to take to work!

Yum. I added about 2 tsp. Coconut palm sugar for a bit of sweetness. I think Im going to mix up the dry ingredients ahead of time and store them in ziplock baggies. Then all I have to do in the morning is whip up my egg, coconut oil and add them all together. Im also looking forward to changing it up a bit - maybe add a little pumpkin with the egg, and pumpkin pie spice in place of the cinnamon.

Love this! I've added blueberries and tried different flour substitutes. Almond flour works best in my opinion.

Made it exactly as written but topped with real maple syrup and a few Enjoy Life mini chocolate chips before serving. Super easy and very tasty! Will make again many times. Would taste great with fruits, nuts and other combinations.

For the amount of effort, these are spectacular. It's not angel food cake, but it does rise a bit, tastes good, and lends itself to plenty of variations. After the first 30 seconds, I had to use 50% power on my microwave, which is prone to having things overflow. I was pleasantly surprised at how easily they came out of the ramekins. This may be about the quickest hot breakfast you can make from scratch!

I’ve been making these muffins for years since finding this recipe; I love them! I always make them as-is, no substitutions. I drizzle LOTS of honey over them straight out of the microwave, but I bet pure maple syrup would be great, too!

I use less cinnamon. I also make it in a 6 " round glass dish.  Then I slice it in half to use a bread for a sandwich!

I mixed together the dry ingredients first because I wasn't sure how well it would work all together at once. I also melted the coconut oil in a measuring glass and poured it in. Finally, I put 1/2 tsp. honey in at the same time as the wet ingredients (egg and coconut oil) to sweeten it a little. Very good, best recipe I've found for paleo mug cakes, and I will be making it again.

This is a great recipe. It makes the best alternate pancake we've ever eaten.   I have also made it multiple times following one reviewer's suggestion of adding blueberries and a little in muffin form and it's a winner that way too.

I was hesitant to try this because I have never found the microwave to ever bake anything successfully, but tried it anyway because of the great reviews. I tried it according to the recipe and only microwaved a bit longer and they were great for a low carb high/fiber muffin. Tried with cream cheese and Trader Joe’s Everything seasoning and pretended it was a bagel!

ok so for someone that likes things sweet, these are just ok, but if I were on the paleo diet, and not eating sugar daily as I do I might have loved these, with honey drizzled over top these are a quick snack that fills the hole in my stomach and gives me a healthy alternative to the white death that sugar is. Im trying here and these are in my keeper file. I actually had all the ingredients, big surprise, I said im trying, I really am. Thanks for this quick go to for gotta have something now moments! Good night time snack or goto breakfast.

I was out of coconut oil so used avocado oil.  That worked very well thankfully.  I added a TBSP of hemp seed instead of flax, added 1 Tblsp of maple syrup and some frozen cherries cut up.  Yummy.  Love this recipe.  Definitely sticking with this Paleo way!

Wow, even my 7 year old ate an entire muffin. I added ? c applesauce, half a banana, and some blueberries. With the added ingredients I recommend baking at 350 for 15-17 minutes

I added a whole mashed up banana and a few walnut pieces and omitted the flax seed meal. It didn’t get firm like a muffin after 2 minutes in my microwave but I didn’t want to cook it any longer and risk it getting rubbery. I put it in a bowl and added a little butter before eating. I will definitely make this again! Yummy the banana makes it sweet enough for me which is surprising that after just a week of Paleo my sweet tooth has drastically shrank, apples and bananas seem to fix the sweet tooth.

This was a good recipe! I think that you would have to call it more of a biscuit than a muffin though.  We didn't have any almond flour, so I subbed in coconut flour. I also skipped the flax.
Great recipe overall!

Love this recipe as a base. It's too bland for me as is, but I add sliced almonds and stevia for crunch and sweetness and when I plate them they each get a pat of butter that melts over them. Yum!

I used chia seed in place of flax seed meal and because it's so absorbent, had to add about 1/4 cup almond milk, unsweetened. I also did a sprinkle of stevia to add a bit of sweetness. They did not hold together well, I ate it with a fork out of the coffee cup I nuked it in, no ramekins in my cupboards. I think berries would add something!

I didn't have the flax seed meal so I added almond meal instead. I also added a bit of stevia. Mine came out really dry! I checked it at one minute and it didn't look done so I went another 30 seconds which could be why it was so dry. I topped it with a bit of coconut milk and it was definitely satisfying. I will try it again for the proper amount of time but if it's still dry I may add another egg or perhaps more oil. I'd also like more texture so I may add chopped nuts. Thoughts?

I always make the recipe "as is" the first time. This is a good one!  Second time I made some minor changes...., added 1 tsp of honey, more cinnamon, & doubled the coconut oil for more moisture. Also, cooked an additional 8 seconds as they didn't seem quite done (that may have just been my microwave's power).  I sometimes miss bread & this helps w/that....

I added some honey, as suggested by other reviewers, and I made it in 1 large mug. It's good. It's quite filling so I could only eat half of it and I ate the other half the next day. I like to eat it with some fruit. Next time I'll make it without the honey and have it with some eggs/veggies.

I made as is but didn't split between 2 ramekins. I just made it in one regular coffee mug. When done I poured some maple syrup over. It was good, a little dense. I think next time I'll add some fruit, maybe a little mashed banana to give some more flavor. A good fast option to morning baked goods though!!

I tried it first exactly as written and didn't like it much, though appreciated the quick microwave cooking and saw the potential to modify. Second time I added a packet of Stevia, another 1/8 tsp baking powder, some chopped walnuts and date pieces in oat flour (chopped into smaller pieces). Much better for my taste. Also, I measure the coconut oil, plus a little extra, into a ramekin, then microwave to melt. Then I measure the 1/2 tsp oil and add to mix, and use the remaining oil to grease both ramekins. Next time I may add something to recipe for more moisture. I don't find them quick enough to make up one batch at a time, but pre-mixing several batches of the dry ingredients would help a lot. I'll keep experimenting. I like the healthy ingredients, and I'm supposed to eat 2 tbsp flax meal a day, so these muffins for breakfast and/or snack would take care of that.

I added Allspice and dried orange peel to give it a little sweetness. Pretty good with a little homemade preserves. I'll add even more spices next time.

I didn't read all the info so missed the bit about the honey.  I think this would taste really nice with honey on it.  It was very easy to make and quick.  Definitely will try it with honey next time.

I agree with Kelli, it makes a great starter recipe to which I can add other tasty items. I added the half banana today and will try it with berries, etc, another day. Since I can't eat gluten I was happy to see this recipe.

I thought it was pretty tasty, very easy to make in one bowl. Put a little honey on top after it was microwaved.

I substituded half of the flour with coconut flour, and added some stevia. The batter is a little dense so perhaps next time I will add a little coconut milk. Otherwise it's quick and tastes good. Ate it with  almond butter.

As written with cinnamon and salt, I ended up with an odd combination of savory and sweet. I plan on making it with one or the  other in the future. It baked up perfectly on the first try.

Not a yummy muffin, but not a hockey puck either. Perhaps with butter and honey, these would be better.

These are so yummy!  I did add some stevia to the batter to add a little sweetness.  I ate mine with Greek yogurt as another reviewer mentioned.  My kids love these!  I plan on making them often!

Turned out great, not too dense, not too fluffy, and just sweet enough.
