I can't get over how much butter and sugar this recipe calls for!  I cut both the butter and sugar to 2 tbsp. each, peeled and cut my pears into fans so the syrup could penetrate, sprinkled them with a little lemon juice before roasting, and basted them a couple of times while roasting for 30 minutes.  The Bosc pears held up very well.  As soon as I removed the pears from the oven, I poured 2 oz. Amaretto over them and let the liqueur mix into the caramel.  Delicious!

Perfect autumn recipe. Easy, easy - and delicious. It took a 9X13 pan to fit the pears - I used 8 TBL. butter and a bit more sugar.  I chopped up a bit of crystallized ginger and fresh grated nutmeg (idea from "30 minute meals" on the food network - they had used canned pears for their recipe).  Because my fruit was very ripe (I used bartlett pears) I reduced the first cooking time by 10 minutes.  Even then the fruit was just beginning to fall apart. I served the pears with vanilla ice cream instead of sour cream.  The only minor complaint was eating the skin of the pear - they didn't like the texture. I will make this dessert again for my family and for company.

YUM! I used Bosc pears after reading the submitter's description (which I really appreciated - thanks!). I think some of the juicier pears may make the caramel sauce thinner, but you can also always reduce it once your pears are done baking if it's too thin for you. I left my pears whole and cored them from the bottom, then set them on the sour cream and dirzzled with the caramel sauce and added toasted walnut halves. Lovely and yummy. Thanks so much for the recipe!

So delicious and easy! I peeled the pears. Also, I reduced the sugar to 3/4 C. I used whipped cream instead of sour cream. Because my pears were a little soft to begin with, I reduced the first bake to around 15 minutes. And I topped with chopped pecans. I'll definitely make again.

My pears were pretty ripe (I used Bosc) so I decreased teh cooking time to about 20 minutes total & i didn't bother to peel them. I  cut the temp back to 375 because the caramel smelled like it might be starting to burn...next time I will start it out at 375.  The caramel was still a bit "crystally" so you might want to start it first if you are decreasing teh cooking time for the pears. I served it w/ a scoop of sweetened whipped cream (that I added a tsp of almond extract too) instead of sour cream & garnished w/ chopped toasted almonds. Very enjoyable...will have again many times!

I thought the sour cream would be too tart with this dessert, but it actually added a wonderful creaminess. I would definately recommend it for cool summer or fall nights when you feel like putting the bit of extra effort forth for dessert.

What a delicious, easy, elegant dessert. I sprikled chopped pecans into the carmel sauce after it came out of the oven. I left the  peel on the pears and actually it was the best part. Recipe is perfect as is or you could experiment with some cinnamon or ginger to kick it up if desired. Will use this for company... excellent comfort food and lower calorie than chocolate.

These were super easy and tasty!  My pears were really ripe so I decreased the brown sugar to 3/4 cup and also sprinkled some cinnamon down before adding the pears.

You know, this is really good! It's a bit of a misleader to say "Caramel Sauce" as it isn't thick as that suggests, but rather runny. However, I don't really think it matters. I used very ripe pears, so I cut down the baking time by 10 minutes. The pistachios are GORGEOUS with this recipe.

This is a fabulous fall dessert. I used Sunnybird's prep using peeled, cored & whole pears with stems. I made them the day before my dinner party and then put them back in a low oven during dinner to reheat.  Delicious and elegant. The sour cream was a great addition and the pistachios a very nice surprise too.

I have made this several times. The first time, I made it as directed and it came out perfectly.  In other times, I followed others suggestions on ways to reduce fat and calories and the sauce would break and separate.  This weekend, I used the full amount of sugar and butter.  I actually pressed the sugar into the butter until no butter was visible and them I place the pears on top. The sauce came together beautifully and the pears were perfectly cooked.  I shake my head at reviews that call the sauce too thin.  Given that it is only butter and sugar, it SHOULD be thin!  If you want a thicker caramel, you will have to add milk, cream, or evaporated milk and it would be a different recipe. I love pistachios with this but usually use ice cream instead of sour cream.  It's a lovely dessert.

I can't rave enough about how simple and elegant this dessert is.  Fantastic!  As others suggested, turn down the temperature to 375 or the caramel will start to burn.  I also used the melon baller to scoop out the pits and look more professional.  The sour cream was elegant, and I don't even like sour cream!  Try it!  I will make this again with a tiny hint of nutmeg.

Delicious and easy – a perfect recipe for a dinner party.  I used bosc pears and toasted walnuts, and I thought the sour cream was the perfect balance for the caramel sauce.    Loved it.

This was *very* sweet for me, but I loved it.  I made some alterations.  I soaked some old (ok, dried out but I wanted to use them up) raisins in Brandy.  I tossed them into the pan when I turned the pears over.   I also used almonds instead of pistachios because I had a handful leftover.    I'm thinking this may become a go to dessert for me for unexpected company.  The sauce is basic and the variations are unlimited.  Any fruit/ Nut that goes together will work in this.

My husband and I went to Lancaster for Easter.  At the bed and breakfast we stayed in, our hosts made roasted pears for breakfast which my husband loved.  We tried this recipe with a few minor alterations.  We used light brown sugar, drizzled the pears with lemon juice, added 1 1/4 tspn of vanilla and peeled, cored and halved the pears.  We roasted them at 350 degrees and cut the bake time down 10 minutes.  The last 10 minutes we added chopped almonds and basted the pears and almonds with the caramel syrup.  It was wonderful!  I ate mine as is, but my DH ate his with Cherry Vanilla Ice Cream.  I will use a little less sugar next time but this is a keeper.  I feel its a 5 start review, since I changed the recipe, I can not give it anything less.

I used a plain Greek yogurt as it is much thicker than regular yogurt in place of the sour cream.  Very, very good.

Sugar and butter could easily be cut by half. Anjous turned out too soft after baking 40 minutes. The pears can be served the next day slightly chilled. Bartletts firmed up overnight and had some definite pear flavor. The coagulated butter can be removed before reheating the sauce; a shot of vanilla/brandy/sherry would have provided a counterpoint to the sweetness.

I thought this was a wonderful recipe! I added 2 tsp of vanilla, used light brown sugar (that's all I had), squeezed lemon juice over the pears, and when I turned them over I sprinkled them with cinnamon. Served with cool whip and toasted pecans. It turned out delicious!

400 degrees caused the surrounding carmelized syrup to burn. Great flavor overall. I like serving mine with vanilla ice cream.

Super easy to put together and is ready when dinner is!  Keep in mind, the caramel sauce is only a carrier of flavour and can be added to several fruits.  I had some fresh pineapple that I threw in with the pears the last time.  Also, if you take the fruit out and put into bowls and place the sauce back into the oven for another few minutes, it will make a thicker sauce so you can pour it over cool pears.  Excellent quick dessert!

I ended up coring the pear with an apple corer.  Then just layered the pieces all over the pan.  We served over homemade vanilla ice cream instead of sour cream.  I will definitely make this again.  It was outstanding!

I had two pears large that were ripened and seached for a nice recipe. This is so so easy and absolutely delish! I used SPLENDA Brown sugar (my husband is pre-diabetic) adjusting the measurement to package directions, and reduced the oven temp to 375 as one reviewer mentioned...This is a keeper!

Followed previous reviewers advice (375 degree oven, added crystalized ginger and pear liqueur, cut brown sugar in half).  Very yummy and also impressive presentation.  Used pistachios and glad I did...nice flavor compliment.

Delicious!  The sour cream added just the right touch.  When I make it again, I'll probably cut back on the butter and sugar, as I had quite a bit of left over caramel sauce that was wasted this time around.  Probably 1/2 to 3/4 of the amounts would suffice.

My dinner guests enjoyed this but next time I'll cut on the dark brown sugar because I found that the dark sugar brought out too much of a molasses-like-flavor and not the carmel flavor I was hoping for.  Overall, nice recipe that I'll probably make again with a few changes. UPDATE: I used light brown sugar this time and topped it with pistachio ice cream...WOW that was five stars.  Really good.  I've also tried this with peaches.  Delicious! I highly recommend it.

The dessert for non dessert eaters! Just the right amount of sweet to end a meal. I used toasted sliced almonds to garnish. Make sure the pan fits the amount of pears you use, mine was too big so the sauce was too thick and hard in places, but the sauce that was liquid was darn yummy!

Did not have as much flavor as I expected. It was ok but nothing impressive. I thought it tasted a little too buttery. I used cashews in my recipe which was good but I do not think I will make it again. Also instead of sour cream I used vanilla yogurt.

This is a good recipe, but it's better if you peel the pears.  I cut down on the butter because it turns out kinda greasy, instead of caramel-y.

Super easy and very tastey! I used whip cream instead of sour cream and also served with a side of coffee ice cream. Delish, the caramel hardened over the ice cream and was a cold and warm treat all in one.

Simple and tasty. Although you dont really need a recipe for this, just play around with the ingrediants, add some cinnamon to spice it up!

I did a dry run with this recipe today as I'm hosting a dinner party next weekend and thought I wanted this as my dessert.  I'm doing a Beef Bourgignon as my main course and want something lighter to end.  This was a good choice.  The recipe couldn't be simpler.  (I think a note for inexperienced cooks about adjusting cooking time depending upon the ripeness of your pears would be helpful.)  I knew that mine was ripe enough to adjust the time downward.  I peeled the pear, and roasted on the one side for only 15 minutes.  I then flipped it and roasted the other side for the prescribed 10 minutes.  That left the pear soft enough, but still with a bit of resistance and not mushy - maybe the equivalent of al dente for pasta. I had no trouble with the sauce separating.  I suspect longer in the oven might have made the sauce a bit thicker, but I don't think that's necessary.  The sauce is to add flavor and in my opinion a thicker sauce would overpower the subtle taste of the pear.  The sour cream is an excellent counterpoint to the sweetness of the pear and sauce.  The salt from the pistachios is also a nice added element.  I can certainly see where adding a liqueur or vanilla would be a nice addition for some people's tastes.  I'm looking forward to serving this to guests!

I cut the recipe in half so we could taste it before making for Thanksgiving.  Should have made the whole recipe, we were all looking for more!  I used Bosc pears, and topped with some crushed walnuts.  Will double this for our dinner.  It is definitely a keeper here!

Very good.  I peeled the pears before baking because I didn't want to have to eat the tough skins on my pears.  The recipe is quite simple and could be used with apples or pears or a combination.

Yum! I used almonds, and substituted ricotta for sour cream, but I think either works fine. Threw in a handful of dried cranberries just to use them up and it was a nice combination. My sauce was a little runny and separated, so I'll adjust for that next time. Great taste all-in-all!

Basically, a baked pear...could have used some more spices, and the caramel sauce was not really caramel. I recommmend melting caramel squares to get a better flavor.

we pealed the skin when we halved and cored the pears.  It was a tremendous hit!  Not only was it easy to make, it made for a very elegant presentation.

Yummy dessert! I used the Bartlett pears and they browned up beautifully, but also were a little bit too soft! I took the pears out of the oven about 10 minutes early, and finished it off with vanilla ice cream...and my husband was in heaven! Great, easy, easy, yummy recipe.

This is a really good recipe, but you have to understand that it's very sweet.  I reduced the sugar to half a cup and I still found that it hurt the back of my jaw from sweetness.  Having said that, the sour cream does add the much needed acidity to cut the sweetness so I am giving it a 5 star rating.

5 star raves from everyone I have served this to. I have modified the recipe to add 1/2 cup of coconut rum dripped over the brown sugar and increased the pecans to 1 cup  to fill in all the spaces in the pan.

This was great, and so easy. I omitted the nuts. When it came out of the oven, I removed the pears into bowls to serve, then mixed the sour cream in to the pan sauce to thicken the caramel, and poured it on top of the pears. It is the best caramel sauce I have ever made!

okay this has always been an excellent easy dessert in the past however- tonight i totally messed it up! in the past i used butter, cut the pears in slices, and used an 8x8 pan, ignoring the directions for a single layer. tonight after i made an amazing dinner, i totally thought i was gonna top it all off with this dessert. but my husband had accidentally bought margarine so i went ahead and used it. also i put the pears in one layer in a larger pan.  for some reason it came out all wrong, with this weird flavor... i think ill stick to butter and the little pan next time, it turned out perfect then.

Fast, easy and delicious! I did peel the pears, which were very ripe. I baked for 20 mins because of the ripeness of the pears so the sauce was a bit thin but complimented the pears extreemly well.

A nice presentation, something different than my usual pastries.  I used my melon baller to core the pear halves.  Took the advice of others and baked the pears at 375, which seemed to work just fine.  Pears held their shape, caramel didn't burn.  Lovely!

Very good. Next time I would brown the cut side of the pears in a pan with butter before baking in the oven. The cut side didn't brown up & caramelize like I thought it would. The flavour however was yummy!

I peeled and cored 7 very firm Bosc pears and left them whole.  Standing up, they all fit in a ten inch cast iron skillet.  I doubled only the butter since I had almost twice the pears.  As per the suggestions I had the heat on 375 and that was great.  It still took a loooong time to bake since they were whole pears and very firm and the heat was lower...took almost an hour and a half!  And I had to keep flipping them over once in a while too.  That's ok because I didn't want to halve them (not a big enough skillet for all of them and I didn't want to use two skillets).  When done I added a bit of salt to the sauce along with like 1 tsp vanilla and a small slosh of dark rum.  Yummo, will make again.  This is a good starter technique recipe.

I followed the recipe, exactly.  The caramel sauce definitely thickens as it cools.  My husband liked it with the sour cream.  I mixed the whipped topping and almond flavoring; I liked that.  The only thing I didn't care for was the Bosco pear peel remained too firm to devour easily.  LOL  Will peel pears the next time I serve this dessert.  Aside from that, it is awesome!!

I used bosc pears and high end rolled butter. I think quality dairy makes a world of a difference in cooking. The flavor was amazing. We skipped the nuts and ate ours over granola with a dollop of Greek vanilla yogurt. My only complaint was how runny the "caramel" was but it was expected since you're literally just melting sugar and butter in the oven. If a thicker sauce is desired that is an easy fix.

Excellent! I'm not a pistachio fan, so I went with toasted almonds and I added a dash of cinnamon too.

This was a delicious and easy way to use a pear surplus.  I didn't peel the pears, and it's not necessary, although I suppose some people might prefer them peeled.  If you use very ripe pears, they won't need as much caramel as this recipe makes because they'll already be super sweet.  Less ripe pears will be firmer after baking.  Some reviewers said they shortened the baking time because their pears were already so ripe, but when I tried this, the caramel didn't get thick enough.  I tried eating the pears with vanilla ice cream, but I liked it better with sour cream and nuts (I used almonds) as suggested by the recipe.  It's rare that I like a recipe best as written, but this is one of those times!

I made this for my husband on Valentine's Day (3 weeks ago) and he's still bringing it up when he talks to people.  It was super simple and the taste was amazing.  I used both a Bartlett and a Bosc pair, and we both agreed the Bosc was better.  I pealed them and used only 3/4 cup sugar.  I was told if I just so happened to ever want to make that again...that would be ok!  ;)  Thanks!

I really WANTED to like this recipe.  So many stars and great reviews ... but it just tasted like sugar and pears.  Nothing special.  It was just ok.

I followed the recipe exactly as written.  The caramel sauce is way too sweet, even with the sour cream. The sauce probably needs less brown sugar and maybe some vanilla. I won't make this again.

Perfect~ My friends mother from Spain made these while visiting and I couldn't wait to try these at home.  They were delicious. I thickened the sauce a bit after baking to make it a little more "caramel" like.

This is good, but I think I added a bit too much sour cream, which is probably my fault.  I ended up not eating most of the sour cream.  I also baked for 20 min, as that is all my pears needed.  As usual, I didn't really measure but I went easy on the brown sugar and butter.  It was slightly sweet but not too sweet.  Thanks!

Fantastic. You couldn't find an easier dessert to make, and it's still delicious and elegant. I served it to dinner guests who raved. It's better if the pears are nice and ripe already, but it's still good even if the pears you use are a bit on the firm side. Lovely.

We loved it, especially the way the sour cream complimented the sweetness of the caramel sauce.  I kept thinking about this dish the next day and wishing I had made extra. Awesome recipe! Thank You.

These were okay, not as flavorful as I anticipated which the fruit is likely responsible for.  I used Seckel pears, which I think may have been too juicy as my caramel didn't really thicken up as it cooled.  A nice change from apples, though

This is simply not good.  I just ruined my pears by doing this to them. In the future, I think I would use a soft pear and just saute' with butter, brown sugar & cinnamon in a sauce pan, then top w/ whipped cream.

Just tried this recipe and the sauce burned.  Used Royal Riviera pears.  Will try this again but will keep a close eye on the cooking time.  This recipe definitely has potential.
