Mexi-Quinoa Chicken Casserole Haiku: "More like a 'skillet' rather than a casserole, still it tasted good!" So "casserole" to me implies a baking dish that I can make again and put in the oven, so I prepared this just that way - made in the morning, covered, and then baked 350 deg. covered for 30 min., then added the optional cheese and uncovered for 10 more min. I also used chicken that I tore off a rotisserie chicken to make it even easier. Garnished w/ lettuce and avocado slices (and crushed Doritos for the hubs), the only thing that I felt like it needed was more than 1/4 c. cheese, and probably no need for the tomato paste (I think I'd use a can of Rotel next time around, along w/ some frozen corn for even more color.)

I made a quicker version: I used a rotisserie chicken from Wal-Mart & as soon as I arrived home I put it in my oven (lid and all) on 170°. I then started making the quinoa in the chicken broth. While waiting on the quinoa I mixed together 1 can of pinto beans drained, 1 can rotel drained, 1 cup of salsa and took a couple of teaspoons of the seasoning mix and mixed in. Then I pulled the chicken out and shredded the chicken & added it into the skillet mix. Once the skillet mix warmed up I tasted it and added a little bit more seasoning. I would recommend slowly adding the seasoning in because I ended up only using half of the seasoning mix. It would have been way too salty if I put all in. Then I added the quinoa and mixed it in and brought it to a simmer (if it seems a little dry just add a bit more salsa) and for the finale I put shredded cheese on top & let it melt by putting a lid on the skillet. I served it on top of shredded lettuce and a dallop of sour cream. It was delicious! It tasted like an Indian taco.

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars "with exceptions" Based on reading other reviews and what I had on hand, I made some adaptations. I omitted the tomato paste. I had red onion on hand and substituted for regular onion. I also used tri-color peppers just for color rather than green peppers. Instead of salsa I used 1 can diced(undrained) tomatoes and 1 can(undrained) diced green chiles. I added 1/4 cup diced black olives.I also added 1 tsp taco seasoning in addition to listed seasonings. I simmered everything for about 20 minutes and topped with 1/2 cup shredded cheese and cilantro, then served over sautéed spinach. This recipe is good in that there are many variations that can be added.My 2 year old daughter ate it up! It was delicious and I'll be making this dish again.

I love this recipe! It was very good and my wife loved it. The only thing different was that I used my home made salsa and a half can of diced tomatoes and I used white and red quinoa to add more color. My salsa it self is on the spicy side after a few bites by itself so I was afraid it be to much, but I was wrong. It was perfect and good job on the recipe!

After making the dish according to the directions I placed it in a casserole dish, topped it with cheese and broiled it for a mouth-watering presentation.

Delicious and has a nice kick! I was out of quinoa and used 2 cups of cooked wheat berries that I had on hand instead.   Omitted the tomato paste, as others recommended and instead increased the salsa by about 1/4 cup. Only used 1/2 of the oregano and 1/2 the garlic salt.   Next time I would probably reduce the garlic salt even further and use fresh garlic, as the salsa makes it salty enough (I used medium salsa).   Also added 1/2 cup of frozen corn, as another reviewer recommended.  So good it doesn't need the sour cream or cheese !  May top with cilantro next time.

Hubbie really loved this dish, and he's not a quinoa kind of guy. As other reviewers suggested, I too left out the tomato paste. I also doubled the chili powder and used 2 chipotle peppers because I didn't have a jalapeño on hand. We topped it with sour cream and avacado, and it was great! I'll also add onion as a topping when we have the leftovers, and I'm already looking forward to!

I used Pace hot picante sauce and deleted the jalopeno pepper.  After everything was cooked, I added the sour cream and mixed it all together, then put it in a 9x13 baking dish.  I topped it with a mMexican blend cheese (2 cups) and baked it at 350 for about 20 minutes, just until the cheese melted.  Even my husband, who hates "healthy eating" and sour cream, loved this dish!

I made this for my family last night and we all thought it was great.  It was my first time using quinoa but I can see a lot of uses for it now.  We fixed this recipe with tortilla chips, grated cheese and sour cream for a topper, and a side salad.  Great recipe!

This was a wonderful concept but as many others have indicated, definitely more of a skillet meal than casserole. I changed up some of the proportions to add flavor. I used more cumin and salsa than the recipe called for. Rather than chili powder, I used the same measure of taco seasoning and just for more southwestern kick, I added the juice of half a lime.  I also used granulated garlic rather than garlic salt. My biggest issue was the quinoa. While I realize it's healthy, it's also very pricey. This dish would have been equally good and significantly less expensive served over yellow rice.
