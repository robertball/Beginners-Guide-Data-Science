5.28.18  Whoa, this was a great topping for grilled Alaskan cod.   It has just the perfect balance of spicy and sweet and just may be the best pineapple or even mango salsa that I’ve ever had.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, this one's a keeper.

This was delicious on our blackened tilapia. We didn't have a red bell pepper and decided to try something new. We used pomegranate kernels instead! Super yummy. Our jalapeno was large so it made up for any possible missing pepper to taste. Will definitely use this recipe over and over

Oh my . . . what a wonderfullly refreshing salsa! I made it to serve as an afternoon snack with Tostito chips (lime flavoured), and what was left over was served as a condiment with our chicken fajitas at supper. It was soooo good, I even made a double batch later in the evening to cut up the rest of our fresh pineapple and let the salsa chill and blend flavours overnight. I made the recipe as is with the exception of: using green pepper instead of red (that's what we had); leaving out the jalapeño pepper (we didn't have any); we did add the optional garlic; and added ~10 grape tomatoes (each cut into 8 small pieces) to add some red colour. I can't wait to have some again tomorrow!! Yum!! (If I could, I'd give it 10 stars!)
The photo submitted was of another batch made with yellow peppers and the grape tomatoes. I like to add 1/4 tsp of chili powder for a bit of a kick in the absence of Jalapeño peppers.

I forgot to buy a red bell pepper, so I substituted some cucumber.  It was amazing!  I served it with grilled tilapia on tacos.  I used the marinade from "Grilled Fish Tacos with Chipotle-Lime Dressing" for the tilapia.  Great combination!
