It has been a week sence I made these cakes. These cakes do get better with age. They are a little on the dry side.I have them soaking in grape juice. Unable to get currents so I used 3 extra cups of dates instead and I am not sorry I did the extra dates worked out very well. Added 1/4 tsp cloves, 1/4 tsp ginger,1/4 tsp nutmag and cut back to 1/4 tsp mace.  A lot of work!!! But it was worth it.

make this 4 batches of this recipe every year for Christmas presents for friends and family, and it is well received. Instead of orange juice, I substitute double amount of Cointreau.

Excellent recipe! I used smaller loaf pans and got 6 cakes from the recipe. I basted the loafs with rum for about 4 days and they are moist and delicious!

This is similar to what I make.  I don't use eggs    or  orange juice in mine.  I  use the recipe my  mom & aunt   used...it's  an old family recipe.  Otherwise  it's  almost the same  as  my recipe.  I also  decorate the top of the   loaves  before baking with  candied cherries  &  sometimes  candied  pineapple.
