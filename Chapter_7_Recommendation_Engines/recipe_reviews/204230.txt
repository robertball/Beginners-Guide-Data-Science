These were a hit with the hubby and the picky 3 year old!  Sooo quick and easy.  I browned the hamburger before putting it with the other ingredients.  I put the beef cups in for 25 minutes and the bread got pretty crispy, I think 20 minutes would have done it.  Oh and I used the heal of the bread on some of them.  That worked nicely because it was a little thinner than the other slices of bread, plus a great way to get rid of the heal!

This turned out pretty good!  I would follow the previous reviewers advice, and brown the meat and onions before putting in the bread cups.  That way you can drain off some of the grease.  This dish was definitely a change of pace, and I will build on it with some of my favorite seasonings.  Thanks for a great new recipe!

Pretty good!  I cooked my meat first and then baked them about 15 minutes or so.

It tasted like beef and bread, there should be some other flavor to offset the taste...
