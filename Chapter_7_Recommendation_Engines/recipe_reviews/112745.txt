As a man who has "plenty" of ground venison in his freezer and loves a good meatloaf, let me say, this was a godsend. I'm from Texas and like things a little warm so I added a couple diced jalopeno's, umm umm  good. Thanks.

Delicious-- I halved the recipe, used ketchup for the tomato sauce, and baked it with potatoes and carrots.  The flavor was great.

Just made this tonight. The bbq sauce really gives it that something special. We had bbq sauce served with it instead of our typical ketchup. I did leave out the sausage because when we process our deer meat we put bacon in it. Also unless your planning to feed 20 people you can really cut this recipe in half or even a forth. It was far too much food.

I halved the ingredients and that worked well.  I am not a fan of meatloaf but my son and husband LOVED this recipe.  My husband, who is a picky eater said it may be the best meatloafs he has ever had.  This is a keeper!

I was shocked at how delicious this recipe turned out! I loved it and so did my husband, three year old and ten month old! I used a pound of deer meat, a pound of ground beef and a pound or so of smoked pork sausage. I was out of bread crumbs so I used quick cooking oats instead and substituted half and half for the evaporated milk. It was amazing!!! This will definitely be my go to recipe for meatloaf from now on! It does make a lot but we had no problem eating the leftovers!

The wife is allergic to beef, so I decided to try this recipe as an alternative.  Have to say, without a doubt, this is THE-BEST meatloaf we've ever had. And the recipe is easy too. 5 stars!

This was great! I just halved the recipe! My picky 3 yr old loved it so much he had seconds.
