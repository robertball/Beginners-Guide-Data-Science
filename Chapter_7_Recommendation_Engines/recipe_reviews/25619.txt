I have been making seven-minute frosting for years.  This recipe is so much easier and holds up better the next day without getting sugary.  I measured the corn syrup in a measuring cup and boiled it in the microwave - couldn't have been easier, and no beating over the stove,

Very easy to make.  I used this on a 2-layer Devil's Food cake.  I, too, boiled the corn syrup in the microwave which worked perfectly.  This recipe is a touch bland so I doubled the vanilla.  Also, to add a bit of sweetness and flavor to the frosting, once the entire cake was frosted I grated a bar of dark chocolate and sprinkled/coated the top of the frosted cake with the shavings.  It added a really decorative look and a great flavor!

I made the Devil's Food Cake I from this site and frosted it with this frosting for my mother-in law's birthday.  It was a great combination.  She had requested Seven Minute Frosting but it was very humid here the day I made it and I was afraid the frosting would not set up good.  This frosting sets up very good even on a humid day!  It is not very sweet but is good when spread over a rich chocolate cake.

Good stuff- not too sticky sweet, but still kind of marshmallow-y.  Use fresh egg whites (at room temperature).  My mother attempted this frosting with egg whites from the box (like All Whites), and the silly things wouldn't turn into a meringue (even though the box claims it will work).

I like using this frosting - It is not loaded with fat from margerine or oil and it is not overly sweet. It is light and fluffy and easily spreads on the cake. I followed th eother reviewers and heated the corn syrup in the microwave. I reserved a cup of frosting and after I frosted the cake, I made the reserved frosting into chocolate frosting by adding a combination of cocoa powder and chocolate syrup to keep the consistensy the same - or a bit thicker that the white frosting.

Made this last night for some sugar cookies.....this is a very light fluffy frosting, so for iced cookies not so good if you want the icing to harden a little bit. We LOVED this frosting though! I thought is was just sweet enough and I have a very big sweet tooth, not near as sweet though as the icing on bakery cakes that everyone always seem to eat around. It almost reminded me of twinkie filling but a tad thicker, and kind of had a marshmallow taste to it. It does make a lot! My husband just had some on strawberries this morning...YUM!

Yummy! However, beware, this is NOT a very sweet frosting. It is very fluffy and mild in flavor. Works well in offsetting the richness of a chocolate cake. If you are looking for a sugary sweet frosting, this may not be for you. I boiled my corn syrup in the microwave and it worked like a charm. Make sure you spread it on your cake right away, or it will not spread as smoothly (though it will still taste fantastic)! Also, this makes a lot of frosting. I used it for one 13X9 inch cake, laying it on very thick, and I still would have had plenty left over for another cake.

This icing was easy to make with a nice texture, but the taste didn't match. I kept adding vanilla and sugar hoping it would taste better, but it did not improve much. I probably wouldn't use it again.

Bland and strange consistency. Mine tasted like egg whites and not much else, which wasn't what I was going for. I doubled the vanilla and added sugar, but it didn't seem to help much. I should have just gone to the store to buy butter and confectioner's sugar and saved myself the hassle.

This turned out quite nice.  very light, creamy, and not too sweet.  I doubled the vanilla and I'm glad I did because I was afraid it would be too bland as others have suggested.    I also mixed some strawberry preserves into it to frost a white cake.  With that addition, it's quite sweet.  I initially goofed and used 1.5 cups of corn syrup, but a few teaspoons of confectioners sugar fixed that and added a touch more sweetness.  If you're looking for a really sweet icing, this isn't it, but it would be a great compliment to a richer cake.

I received a last minute call from my church to make a cake for a funeral luncheon. I had a cake mix, but no frosting. I found this recipe and had all of the ingredients. It was very easy, but really not very sweet.  I added a little confectioners sugar and topped the whole cake with some sweetened flake coconut.  What a pretty cake!

I needed something extra for a peach cobbler, so I modified this recipe as a great topping. Instead of using light corn syrup, I used the light syrup from a can of peaches, and upped the vanilla extract to about 3 teaspoons. It turned out a great substitute for vanilla ice cream, which I didnt have.

My Mom made this recipe all the years my brothers and I were growing up, all we had was home grown products and homemade desserts.  Wonderful.
