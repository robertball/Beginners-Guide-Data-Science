Very quick and easy to make. I had everything on hand. I enjoyed the little bit of kick this recipe hand instead of the normal chicken salad.

I found this recipe because I was craving chicken salad the way my old college roommate used to make it. This is pretty close and very good!

My husband loved it.  Chicken Salad was never my favorite, but that's now changed.  Delicious!

I did make two substitutes but only because that is the ingredients on hand.  I used spicy brown mustard and miracle whip.   You need to let this set and the flavors meld before eating.  I tried it right after making it and it was okay  but, three hours later it was really good.

Tastes pretty good to me and I just licked the mixing spoon, we will eat after it is chilled.

Really good!  I love chicken salad and liked the spice this recipe added.  Plus not having to cook the chicken was nice.  That being said I added a little more mayo because I like it a little more wet,  but I could have easily eaten it without the extra mayo.
