Made this several times, with three changes. Instead of ham I used smoked turkey legs and instead of beef broth I used chicken broth as well as added one table spoon of green seasoning. However, you will need to cook the smoked turkey with the broth on high for 90 minutes, shredding it then placing it back in the slow cooker with the greens and the rest if the ingredients omitting the skin from the smoked turkey. This is awesome!!!

This recipe made my 1st experience cooking greens very positive.  A co-worker's neighbor leaves produce on her front porch regularly.  When it's too much or she has no time to cook it, it passes on to me.  So what do you do when a big bag of mustard greens is given to you?  This recipe is the answer.  Made without the spice (mustards are plenty flavorful already), I cannot think of a better way to prepare greens.  This rivals Glory Food!

This is a great recipe. Spicy collard greens. I rely on allrecipes.com to help me cook in the kitchen. I'm am pleased. Simple instructions easy to follow. Thanks again for your recipe.

I made this recipe a second time, I just used what I had in the kitchen so I made a few changes. I used two bunches of Collard greens and beet greens, not the mustard greens or turnip greens. I used ham instead of bacon, I used spaghetti sauce instead of diced tomatoes,  I used white distilled vinegar, instead of red wine vinegar, and brown sugar instead of white sugar. Very Tasty we ate it all up.

All I had was mustard greens, so I left out the other greens.  Instead of the ham, I tossed a ham hock in the crock prior to adding the greens.  I forgot to add the bay leaf, but I don't think it would have made that much of a difference.  I also didn't have canned diced tomatoes so I just diced up some fresh.   My husband has a recipe that he always uses for collards, so when he saw the veggies in with the greens he was a bit dubious.  He seemed to like them though.  I served this with fried fish.

This is a wonderful recipe. I've tried several recipes for collard greens from this site and this one is by far the best. The only change I made was to use 2 bags of the pre-washed 'southern greens' which is a mixture of collard, mustard and turnip greens. I cooked it for a few hours on high, then refrigerated overnight and cooked several more hours the next day. I just cooked until the greens were soft. I will be making this one again.

This is very different.  Having made "Greens"  for many years this gave a different flavor.  Not my favorite, however  it has an interesting and spicy taste.

I used this recipe for my first time making collard greens. I followed the recipe exactly, and the greens were delicious! I'll definitely make this again, and I've already shared the recipe with others.

More complex flavor than simple greens.
