Flavor is excellent.  I left out the rasins as I am not a rasin fan. Used Pecans instead of walnuts. Due to other reviews about the rising issue I added 1/2 tsp Baking Powder.  My rose fine. I cooked in a Bundt pan for 40 mins at 350

I was disappointed. My cake didn't rise, only 1 inch high. I used Crisco Butter Shortening and it had a greasy taste. Although with the cream cheese icing it we were ab;e tp eat it. I would not fix it  again.

Recipe was good although made a few changes. I added a half of teaspoon of baking powder, two tablespoons of molasses, and instead of one egg, I used two.... It came out really delicious!!!!

Exactly what I was looking for. As a kid we used a box mix and now that I make the effort to scratch bake I did not think I could replicate the past. 
We omitted nuts and raisins. Used apple juice to make up for the omitted raisin juice. Other changes were using 1/2 butter 1/2 shortening, 1 tsp baking soda and a pinch of salt. 
Turned batter into cupcakes. The batter rose fine and made really beautiful shaped cupcakes.

The cake was dry and very flat.  The flavor was good but wouldn't recommend or make again.

I made it  exactly as the recipe said & it was the best ever. I would recommend this cake to anyone. It's so much better than box cake. It's so moist it's just great.

I have made this several times, mostly as my own birthday cake. I have always gotten compliments on it. I frost it lightly with an extra buttery flavored butter cream frosting. it can also be made in a Bundt pan and drizzled with glaze.

Just used this recipe as a tier for my sister's wedding. It was such a big hit that some people didn't get to try so I have to make another one!
