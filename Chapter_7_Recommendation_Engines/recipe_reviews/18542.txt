My recipe is very similar but I add 3 boiled eggs finely chopping and instead of salt and pepper, about 2 tsp Lawry's seasoning salt to counter balance the sweetness of the pickle relish.  Also, I use bread and butter pickles sometimes instead of the sweet pickle relish and it gives it an extra good taste.  Bear in mind, the more ketchup you use, the sweeter it will be as ketchup contains more sugar than most people realize.  I suggest adding a little bit of ketchup at a time tasting as you go.  Enjoy!

Well, nothing fancy here and it works great in a pinch! This is especially good on sandwiches vs. salads as it's not like the "authentic" type but more of the get down to basics type of thousand island dressing. I cut the recipe in half and used chili sauce vs. ketchup for a little more "kick".

I have been making this recipe for a long time.  I haven't bought dressing in years.  Don't need to.  I just put a little of everything in a small bowl.  Don't measure!  Just get it to where I want it and go!  It really is easy and uses ingredients you should already have!

This is actually a very good recipe for a quick and simple dressing. I made this recipe for my husband since he's the thousand island dressing lover. I prefer ranch myself. He thought is was way too sweet but otherwise did taste like thousand island dressing. I suggest adding small amounts of sweet pickle relish at a time (which is what I should have done, my fault) to get your desired taste.

This is the recipe I was raised on!  No fancy bell pepper, vinegar or worcestershire sauce, just the main ingredients that make it taste so good.  Great on Reuben sandwiches and wedges of iceburg lettuce!  The best!

I made a 1/2 recipe and used a lot less (proportionally) relish. I have always purchased TI dressing but this is so easy I might not buy bottled again. I'm torn. It's REALLY easy pouring out of the bottle and I feel like I can keep it for weeks in the fridge. I'm not so sure how long homemade will keep though so making a big batch is out of the question.  Even as easy as it is, I can't say as I want to have to mix it up every time I need some. Even so I'll bet it's a whole lot cheaper to make like this than buying the bottled.

this did not taste very good to my partner and i. she said it tasted like  the toppings on a hamburger, just put together. i just recently bought bottled thousand island dressing to compare the taste and it tastes nothing like it. not sure what all the good reviews are about!.
this just wasn't for us at all.

This is...thousand island dressing, plain and simple.  It is delicious, super easy to make, and I bet you have the ingredients around the house!  This is so much more fun than bottled dressing.

When I went to get my bottled thousand island out of the fridge to make reubens I had to chuck it because it was expired so I quickly jumped on AR and pulled this recipe up.  I am so glad I did!  This tastes even better than the bottle and I had all of the ingredients in my fridge.  I used low fat mayo and couldnt tell the difference!

Had a craving for Frisco Melts and didn't have any dressing...which is a must.  It was good.  A little bit different than what I am used to, but still works great. Thanks for the post.

I've been looking for a good Thousand Island dressing for years.  I've tried every brand you can buy but didn't care for them.  Even O'Charlies wasn't as good as at the restaurant.  This is wonderful and so simple.  Since I'm alone I used 2 T. Miracle Whip Salad Dressing, 1 T. ketchup, 1 small, finely diced sweet pickle and 1 t. finely diced onion.  That makes enough for about 3 salads and I can always have fresh dressing.  I love salads and will now be eating them all the time at home.  Thank you so much for this recipe!!!

The trick to really kick up this recipe is to NOT use relish - instead, cut up very finely sweet gerkin pickles and use in place of the relish.

Probably the easiest homemade dressing I've ever made with all the ingredients almost always on hand. The family loved it. Very smooth flavored and so much better than the bottled stuff where you can always taste that preservative flavoring. Thanks!

This is good & oh so easy.  I did make a few changes though to make it more reminiscent of my mother's recipe:  I use almost 1/2 cup chili sauce with only a squirt of ketsup, and add a healthy squeeze of lemon juice to cut the sweetness of the relish, which I only use 1-2 T of.  I also sub Old Bay or Season All for the pinch salt/pepper.  My favorite use for this dressing is for crab louie salad, so once the I have made the dressing I add a bunch of imitation crab meat and chopped or baby shrimp and serve it over iceberg or butter lettuce with avocado, tomato and hardboiled eggs.  YUM!!!

I only made half of the recipe since I am the only one who likes thousand island.  I thought it was a little too sweet and needed a little something else.  So I added a tsp apple cider vinegar and 1/4 tsp onion powder.  Now I think it is just perfect.

I made this with dill pickle relish, because I don't care for sweet.  It was the exact recipe I had at a restaurant not far from here.  It will be the only 1000 island I use from now on....Thanks.

OMG, I had no idea Thousand Island dressing could be this simple! This is so easy to make and while maybe it doesn't rival a $5 bottle from the store, it's so much better than the cheap $1.50 bottles.

I needed Thousand Island Dressing for Reuben Sandwiches and didn't want to buy a bottle of dressing just for this.  This recipe really came in handy because you could adjust it to the amount you needed.  The taste was perfect on the sandwich.  This recipe is a keeper!

Wow- all the money you can save by making your own dressing- AND it's as good if not better than the bottled kind! I just added a few drops of worceshrshire sauce- it's great!

Super easy, quick & tasty (for my Reuben sandwich). Do drain the sweet pickle relish to avoid it being overly-sweet & a little too liquidy. Next time I might try dill pickle relish, &/or a  chili sauce (like Heinz').

Better than store bought but nothing spectacular. I halved the recipe and it made a lot still, especially for salad use only. I also used less than 1/4 cup of the sweet relish. Otherwise I agree that it would be way too sweet. I thought the dressing was a little too thick for the salad. It would have a perfect consistency to put in a hamburger though.

I substituted yogurt instead of mayo and I made my own ketchup without sugar (tomato sauce, vinegar, onion powder). I added relish and all natural brown mustard. Tasted just like thousand island and healthier. I used it on spinach, egg, dill salad and veggie burgers.

Made this with Chili Sauce and added ONION powder to the mix.  Chilled for a few hours and used this on Reubens :)  Everyone has their own tastes so this recipe allows you to switch around the ingredients.

I cut the relish quite a bit...one or two tablespoons (can't remember). I also used Heinz chili sauce (like ketchup but with a little kick) in place of the ketchup.  Yummy!  I made this for a shrimp salad.

Made turkey burgers with melted American cheese over sauteed mushrooms.  I whipped up this by just eying it in half to make 4 burgers and spread it onto the top bun then putting some fresh baby spinach on top.  The thousand island held the spinach in place and it was a hit.  Thanks!

Hubby wanted Big Mac from McDonalds...I said can make cheaper but didn't have Thousand Island dressing here...so I used this recipe & it's wonderful! I used dill pickle relish instead of sweet and think I like it better...either way, this is definitely a keeper!! Thanks to the author!

followed recipe exactly. Way too much relish...I would just add a couple Tablespoons and then add more to taste. Otherwise, good recipe

We had Reuben sandwiches last night and I realized that I forgot to tell me husband to pick up Thousand Island Dressing.  I headed right over to my laptop and checked allrecipes.  What a fantastic and easy recipe.  And delicious too!  I will never buy bottled thousand island again; our sandwiches were delish!

I just made this! I love making my own dressings. They're so easy and a lot healthier than the store-bought stuff. I didn't measure, just eyeballed the ingredients for my taste. I also threw in a little garlic and onion powder...can't hurt it! Thanks Sue!

This is a keeper! Super easy and really great taste. Start with the Mayo and add ketchup and sweet pickle relish to taste. I won't buy Thousand Island dressing again. Thanks for the recipe and it was fun..

Pretty good. Unknown to me, we had run out of thousand island dressing at home. I was making a turkey reuben for my husband and found this recipe and had everything. It was a little too sweet. I think there was too much relish. But all in all, it was a pretty good recipe and it worked well on the sandwich.

I was skeptical, but this worked great on reubens.  I chose this version of the recipe because it didn't have anything that had a very limited shelf-life.  I can mix up a batch and it will stay good for months in the fridge.  (Unlike the versions with eggs.)

Great Start for Dipping Sauce - Just modified it with a little horsey sauce and a little less ketchup, in about 2 minutes I had a great dipping sauce for the onion rings I just made.

This is a really good version of Thousand Island Dressing for sure! I cut the recipe in half and followed the directions with the exception of adding some water to thin it out a bit - and I did eyeball the ingredients (didn't measure anything). The end result was really good.

I made this for my Slow Cooker Reuben Dip. Only sub I made was using non-sweet
relish, as noone in this house can stand sweet pickles. (I know, blasphemy!) Worked out great for me.

For such a simple recipe this was very good.  We were making Ruebens and realized we didn't have dressing.  Whipped this up in about a minute.  Will use again.  Especially since we don't use Thousand Island dressing on anything else but Ruebens - we can scale it down to a small amount just for those.  Thanks.

This is so easy & perfect for a rueben sandwich since it's so thick. We also don't eat TI dressing on salads so this really cuts down on waste! Just make sure to let it sit a little while to let the flavors mesh together. I added vinegar, worcestershire and garlic salt but I'm sure it would have been great without it too. My husband said that he liked this better on his reuben than whatever TI dressing his favorite restaurant uses!! Wow what a compliment to this recipe :o) Thanks so much for sharing.

Amazing! I didn't know making Thousand Island dressing would be so easy or I'd have done this years ago! It was very tangy, maybe next time I'll use a bit less pickle relish as it seemed a bit much. I used Heinz ketchup and Vlasic sweet pickle relish along with Kraft mayonnaise. So much better than the bottled stuff. Thank you Sue, for sharing this!

We don't really eat 1000 Island dressing on a regular basis, but I made a 1/3 of the recipe for 3 large Reuben sandwiches. It was definitely better after sitting for an hour as it tasted too much like mayo before. I added a splash of rice vinegar, a bit of garlic and onion powder, but those were the only changes.

Good, tasty, quick and easy with ingredients I have on hand. This isn't my all time favorite T.I. recipe but this certainly will do instead of bottled with all of those unpronouncable ingredients!! Thanks!

I wanted to make a taco salad and needed an easy Thousand Island dressing recipe…this was the right one! My family loved it and it was so easy to prepare. I didn’t have sweet relish, but I chopped up some sweet pickles and it worked! Wonderful recipe!

I cut this recipe in half.  Easy enough!  I felt like something was missing so added some horseradish and it was much more to my liking.  Didn't taste hot . . . just better.  No more buying thousand island dressing once or twice a year (for making reubens sp?) only to throw most of the bottle away a few months later.

Had some leftover corned beef from a restaurant meal and thought about Reuben sandwiches for the next days lunch all the way home. There was no thousand Island dressing in the house so this recipe gets five stars just for the convenience of being able to make it with ingredients that most people have on hand. It proved its value the next day when it worked its magic and turned our leftover corned beef into the star of a couple of tasty Reubens.

I've never made thousand island before and didn't realize it was this easy.  Simple recipe to make and I like it with both Hellmans and Miracle Whip.  Easy to reduce for personal size like a reuben or dipping sauce (2 tablespoons relish and mayo to 1 tablespoon ketchup).  Thank you!  I hate buying it because I never use a whole bottle.

We have been wanting reuben sandwiches all weekend, but we kept forgetting to buy thousand island dressing. So, after work today, we tried this recipe. VERY GOOD. After the first taste test, we added a bit of Worcestershire Sauce. It tasted just like our local delicatessen!

I didn't have any salad dressing in the house and didn't want to go to the store again so I visited my favorite recipe site :) Only two of us in the house, so I halved the recipe. It was a bit too tangy for me so I added some more mayo. My recipe was probably 2/3 c. mayo, 1/2 c. sweet relish, 1/4 c. ketchup, couple shakes each of salt and pepper. I will never buy thousand island at the store again.

I needed  quick and easy.  Used  the mayo half the pickle relish and no ketchup in house, but had horseradish shrimp sauce so subbed for ketchup.  No salt and pepper.  I loved it.  Sweet tooth husband also loved it.  That's a first!

The best!  Better than the bottled and you can make it in small quantities.  I use Hellman's lowfat mayo and you would never know the dressing had half the fat.  THANKS!

this was a good substitute when I ran out of the bottled stuff and needed some for the big mac pizza I was making. I added some garlic powder and a bit of milk because it was a little too thick as is. id make this again if I didn't already have some on hand. Thanks for sharing

Good homemade Thousand Island Dressing.... mine turned out very very sweet... probably just another instance where miracle whip doesn't cut it... I took the advice of an other reviewer and added seasoned salt to counter act the sweetness... seemed to work decently... I also added 1 boiled egg chopped up to make it more authentic... will go good with my ruebens

This was okay, but REALLY sweet for our taste, and I even cut the relish in half.  Next time I'd half the relish and the relish....I may even try dill relish.  Used it on Reubens.

I wanted thousand island dressing for Rubens, but did not want to buy an entire bottle.  So, I tried making my own with this recipe as my base and it was excellent.  I only wanted enough for 2 sandwiches.  So, I just eyeballed the ingredients to make what I needed and it turned out wonderful.  I did add about 3-4 drops of worcestershire sauce and the juice of half a small lemon.  Thank you so much.  I no longer have to waste a bottle of dressing for Rubens!

I made this to go with the Slow Cooked Corned Beef for Reubens, and it was perfect. I'm not a huge fan of Thousand Island Dressing on salad, so it was nice to just be able to make a small amount. I think I can safely say I will never bother purchasing store-bought Thousand Island Dressing again.

.  I was preparing a salad and realized I had none in the fridge.  I found this recipe 5-ingredient recipe a few minutes and it was delicious. Thanks Sue for sharing.  No more store bought dressing for us.  I can't wait for my husband to get home from work to try it out.

The only change I made to this recipe was adding 1 Tbs. of white vinegar and 2 tsp. of sugar to the ingredients.  No need to ever buy bottled Thousand Island dressing again, especially if you only need it for one night's dinner.  Thanks for a great recipe, Sue.

My recipe differs a little as I use dill relish and garlic salt.  We also use low sugar ketchup. I grew up on this and it is very good. You can add almost any flavor to this dressing and it will taste good. We now add about a foruth to a half teaspoon (personl taste) of chipolte powder to this and it really gives it a kick. Thanks for sharing.

This is really good. I've made Thousand Island Dressing before but not as much sweet relish. I like this recipe much better than the ones I've made before. It's simple and good and I needed to use up an extra opened bottle of sweet relish.

I thought this recipe was a great place to start. I added some olive oil, a splash of vinegar and a little garlic powder.
My husband loves it and has finally stopped insisting that I buy the bottled junk from the store. Thank you!

This is a good base recipe for thousand Island dressing.You can add anything to it chopped tomato,bacon,etc. I like a celery/onion base so I added finely chopped celery,chopped onion,and a little sugar because I don't like tart dressings.I also add a little milk to thin dressing out.By adding milk you make the dressing creamier.

We loved it!!  Followed the recipe exactly and it was wonderful!!!! Just a note though, I used "hot dog relish" by Heinz.  I am assuming it is the same as sweet relish.  I use the same relish in my ham salad, so I knew it would be good.  I will NEVER buy bottled dressing again.

I decreased the serving size to two and made two different batches.  The first one I used chili sauce instead of catsup and 2 table spoons relish.  The second one I used two tablespoons castup and one tablespoon of relish.  The first batch was too sweet with that much relish.  The second batch wast just perfect.  I will make this all the time because It taste better than the stor bought stuff and I can make it in smaller quanties.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.

I made this for a dinner guest and he really liked it.

Let it marry together for at least an hour for the flavor to set right. Perfect after that.

I love this stuff. I didn't change anything but it certainly is very versatile. I may try Sriracha Ketchup next time for a little kick.

Will never buy thousand island dressing again. It was soo good. We used it on Rueben sandwiches. We also tried it with some lettuce leaves and it was very nice . It’s gteat on salad if you like the heavy dressings . We like oil and vinegar! I will make this again on my next Rueben sandwich for sure.

My husband loved it.  I did alter the recipe slightly since I didn’t have enough pickle relish. I only used about 2/3 of a cup but everything else remained as the recipe directed.

Easy and tasty! I cut the relish in half and added a splash of Worcestershire sauce, a splash of hot pepper sauce, and a couple tsps of horseradish. It was delicious with these adjustments.

A pretty good recipe, but a bit sweet for my taste. I cut the sweet relish to 2/3 cup and added 2 tablespoons of real crumbled bacon, 1/4 teaspoon liquid smoke and 1/4 teaspoon hot sauce (I prefer Cholula). That was a big hit!

I only needed a small amount of Thousand Island for a couple of Reuben sandwiches.  This is hubby's favorite salad dressing so I might start making it for summertime salads.  I do use mayo made with Olive Oil.

I'm expecting lunch guests in 2 hours and plan to serve rueben sandwiches.  When I checked my TI dressing it was severely outdated so it's Allrecipes to the rescue!  This dressing was just perfect as it was so quick and easy and all ingredients were on hand.  Next time I will put some finely chopped onion in when it has enough time to stand and meld.  Thank you for saving the day with this simple, tasty recipe!

I made this recipe exactly according to the recipe.  It gets 5 stars for quick and easy, but I thought it was missing something in flavor and texture.  I'll make it again, but will look at a few other thousand island recipes for ideas of add-ins.

Tasted pretty good on romaine lettuce. I would maybe do what the previous person suggested and add seasoning salt and egg next time. That sounds reasonable. And also I may even cut down the amount of relish a bit. Very sweet

I used organic katsup (I can't eat corn syrup) and homemade dill pickles instead of sweet. I also added a dash or two of hot sauce and a teaspoon of fresh lemon juice. It's delicious! This is a keeper!

This is very similar to mine. I add diced onion and garlic and let it meld in the fridge preferably overnight but at least an hour before serving. I also use both dill and sweet relish, sometimes bread and butter relish, but only about half of your recipe.

Way to sweet. Iuse dill relish and Worcestershire sauce with black pepper. Leaving out the salt. Much better based on my families likes. Works better on crab Louie and Shrimp Louie. Salad with ham and cheese too

1 cup pickle relish is an awful lot. I had to cut it back by about half. Put a little bit of mustard in and you can use this as a hamburger dressing too!

This was a little sweet for me, but of course my husband thought it was great.  I do like the fact that it's quick to make and easy to remember.  Next time I may sub chili sauce for the ketchup.  Thanks!

Quick & easy. I also add 1 tsp of white vinegar, a Tbsp of sugar, & 4 chopped hard boiled eggs. Can add 1tsp of worchshire too if you'd like. Good base recipe!

Easy and excellent.   I whipped up 1/4 of this recipe in a hurry when I had 3 minutes left for my (frozen section) Rueben Bites to finish cooking in the oven.  It made a lot, about 3/4 cup!  The dressing went very well with my snack!  Thanks for the recipe!

This is the classic recipe I have been using for years. I use my homemade zucchini relish and it just tops it off perfectly. Can't go wrong.

Good and quick! I only wanted a bit for making corned beef sammiches later, and the boyfriend isn't a fan of anything with mayo in it.. I didn't measure, but I scaled it (more-or-less) proportionately, and the flavour is very nice. It'll be my go-to when I need Thousand Island! Thanks for sharing, Sue!

Way too much relish for us! Luckily, I only made a half recipe so I added more mayo and ketchup. I made it again for a party with 1/4 cup of relish and it was great.

Good recipe, ready in 5 minutes. I cut the Relish in half as i´m in Germany, and the Relish isn´t too swett, I like it Abit more zesty. I also added a pinch of smoked Paprika to it, turned out great!

I whipped this up real quick for some patty melts I made.  PERFECT!!!  I had a tiny bit of mustard relish I wanted to use up so I used that plus the rest sweet relish, so this had a slight mustard flavor.  Not sure how I would like this on a salad, but I did save the extra to spread on sandwiches and burgers!  Yum!

This is close to my recipe, but I only use 1/2 c. sweet pickle relish (or finely grated sweet pickles), plus a squeeze of lemon juice, and I skipped the pepper. Good stuff and works for dipping oven fries too!

Super easy and a good alternative to store bought.  I buy organic relish and it makes a much healthier alternative to store bought dressing.

Used this in Reuben Dip from this site. I was oddly out of pickle relish so I just chopped up some pickle spears. Worked great in my dip. I only needed a half cup so I cut the recipe to fit that.

I used chipotle mayo and what a nice kick.  I used to buy the bottle but usually it would get tossed because I only used it for Reubens.   I only made enough for a few sandwichs and it was delicious.

I never liked thousand island unless it was on in & out burgers until I discovered it in a restaraunt while finding something to dip fries in. I did not want to buy it out of a bottle because it always seemed nasty so I searched this site. This recipe is soooo easy and it's very tasty. I make it all the time now for my french fries, burgers, and sandwiches. Thank you!

Delicious! Made it to spread on pineapple chicken sandwiches. I liked that I was able to use low-fat mayo and make a healthy version of the dressing. I also liked the flexibility to make only two tablespoons of the dressing using the ratio provided.

Makes a good, basic Thousand Island dressing.  Nothing special.  Worked great on ruebens.  This made way too much for me though.  Next time I'd make a quarter of the recipe.

I cut in half as I was going to use it for a cheeseburger pizza. Was fantastic. I never have this dressing on hand as we do not eat it. It was very nice to be able to make it for the pizza. Thanks a bunch for the great recipe ;)

Thank you! Thank you! I usually cut the amounts down so I don't have so much on hand but it's the portions.

I love Thousand Island, this was great. I didn't have relish, so I chopped up a dill pickle in it. So good.

I used this dressing for a reuben sandwich and it was fabulous. Better than any store bought dressing. Definitely restaurant quality!

This was perfect with my rebuen sandwiches. Thanks for saving the day since I forgot to get some at the store. But who needs to buy it now when you can make the same exact thing at home!

kudos for ease! my mother's recipe for 1000 island is so good, and so time consuming! I was looking for dressing for the Baked Chicken Reuben recipe from this site, and did not want a long time consuming multi ingredient dressing I was only going to pour in a casserole and bake. This fit the job perfectly.

This worked out perfectly for reubens! Very easy recipe...I didn't measure anything, just adjusted the ingredients until I thought it tasted "right."

This is a great recipe. I also added a tiny splash of cider vinegar for a kick.

Been using this recipe for quite some time and love it.  It has become my family's dressing.  No more store bought TI dressing for us!  Thank you for sharing.

I used some chopped, sweet & spicy pickles for the relish & I only used half a cup. This dressing was very thick...more spoonable than pourable. Hubby loved it (I don't eat thousand island dressing)...thanks Sue!

I cut the recipe in half.  It wasn't bad but it wasn't great either.  I think there was too much relish.  I'll try making it with less next time.
