Gets 5 stars for ease! I wanted to add a little kick so added a tablespoon on Cajun seasoning, I was never more excited to pack a sandwich for lunch :)

Thanks for the reviews! KelleyP, I think I might have mentioned the brand name spread when I wrote the recipe but I think they may have rewrote some parts of what I submitted.  The spread it resembles is Kraft Sandwich Spread.  It really adds another dimension to an egg salad sandwich.

Since Heinz Sandwich Spread could not be found on Grocery Store shelves in the U.S. and has recently disappeared in Canada, I have found this recipe to be my closest replacement.  Great substitute for someone raised with this product.

This was tangy yet sweet. Perfect for a grilled cheese and tomato!

One of the best little recipes on this site.  Hellman's/Best Foods sandwich spread has been around for decades.  But can't find in Florida. This recipe tastes exactly like the Kraft brand.  But if you cut back on the thousand island it tastes just like the Hellmans/Best Foods brand.   Made it both ways and prefer less thousand island.  About 1 tablespoon.  And much cheaper to make.  We make often. Great on a simple beef bologna sandwich.  Thanks for sharing.

I made the recipe because I wanted to make deviled eggs and could not find store bought sandwich spread without high fructose corn syrup.  I used Hellman’s mayo original and added a little more kraft thousand island as my boyfriend loves thousand island.  I was really impressed with the results of a recipe so simple.  I’m really grateful for this recipe.  To like this recipe you have to like sandwich spread to start with which I do.  Those who didn’t like the recipe I think might just not like sandwich spread to start with.  If it turned out for me it should turn out for anyone.  I am no chef and struggle with my cooking.
