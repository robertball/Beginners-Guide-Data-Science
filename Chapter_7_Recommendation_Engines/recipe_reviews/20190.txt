Best drink I've had in a long while, I don't even like lemonade but this was delicious. I did however replace raspberry syrup with strawberry syrup, and I added some of the matichino cherry juice as well. It was soooo good. I had a friend over who tried it with me and he liked it also. I now call it the love drink. he seemed to like me a little bit more after he drank it... then again he likes cheries and lemonade.

very good recipe

This was a great drink for Halloween Dinner! I replaced the blueberries with blackberries since our grocery store didn't have any blueberries! It was great!
