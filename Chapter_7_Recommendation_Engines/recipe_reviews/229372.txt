I had to make two changes only because I am limited on ingredients. I did not have heavy whipping cream, I used equal amounts evaporated milk. I also did not have chervil, I useda little dried parsley and dried chives. Even with my substitutions, this soup turned out FANTASTIC. I've had it for lunch five days in a row with half of a tomato sandwich and I can't get enough. I love that it's low in carbs and low enough in calories so that if I wanted more (which I have), I can have seconds. Delicious!

I turned on the broiler to brown up the cauliflower.After the complete soup mixture cooked for 15-20 min, I pureed 3 cups of it for a smoother,creamier soup.Added small pieces of cooked smoky ham and dusted w Parmesan cheese.Wonderful combination.

I made a few changes to this recipe, the most significant being the roasting time/temp on the cauliflower.  I am not sure if 275 at 30 min is a typo or not, but that time/temp combo does not produce soft, browned cauliflower.  I added an extra 10 min at 425 to the end of that cooking time.  Next time I will do 20-25 min at 400.  The other major change was that I added 3 strips of bacon (fried and crumbled) to the soup.  Great! Minor changes included leaving out the flour (to eliminate carbs and because it really wasn't needed) and partially pureeing the soup with an immersion blender so it was thick and creamy with small cauliflower chunks.  I also did not have chervil and used parsley instead. This is delicious soup and really resembles loaded baked potato soup when you top it with bacon crumbles and cheese.

Easy and delicious. I halved the recipe since my CSA box only came with one leek. Near the end, after adding the spices, I took my immerson blender to the larger chunks of cauliflower to smooth out the soup and make it more "soupy". This is a pretty thick soup and you could stretch it a bit by doing more water or broth if you need to. Both the favors of the cauliflower and leeks were on display.

Three-star rating for misinformation. I'm in the process of making this soup now, and the temperature is way off. 275 F doesn't come close to the temp necessary for roasting. I just raised the temp to 450 which is what many recipes recommend for roasting cauliflower. Blending part of the cauliflower sounds like a good idea.

I was lazy. I stir fried the cauliflower and leeks in ilive oil. Then I added the entire container of low sodium chicken broth. Luckily I had all of the spices. I stirred in the flour and spices and let it all bubble on top of the burner until every vegetable was soft. Probably got done quicker and easier that way. Voila! Delicious!!

Yum! I could not make exactly as written. However, if I could have it would have been just as delish, if not more. I roasted caulif in oven with baby carrots, 2 garlic cloves, drizzled with olive oil. Meanwhile, leeks were sauteing in olive oil, soon after added 3 diced potatoes. Skipped the flour and heavy cream altogether. Instead, I found a cream of onion soup in the cabinet to add to the chick stock. No spices used except for S&P. Used immersion blender to "cream" all together after simmering all for about an hour. Topped with shredded cheddar. So so so good.

Thank you submitter.  Cauliflower and leeks are a good combination. I made it with veggie broth (homemade, used the leek tops, parsley stems, cauliflower cores chopped up - just simmered all this while the cauliflower was roasting), used parsley instead of chervil, added 2 tsp of sugar, added a few scallions that were in the fridge, used the blender to puree about a third of it.  It was delicious. As for the leeks, I used the white and light green parts, and the soup was very pretty - white, light green plus dark green from the parsley and scallion tops.

Awesome soup....made it 2 months ago and because I haven't had cauliflower in the house i haven't made it again.  Added 1/2 lb cooked bacon cut into 1" bites, and a couple potatoes cubed....Everyone loved it. The cauliflower was eaten up by our pickiest of eaters in the neighborhood...my 12 yr old daughter.

Roasted at 400, used low fat evaporated milk to cut fat, and parsley, since no chervil. Immersion-blended some of cauliflower, but left a little chunky. Added about 1 tsp bacon bits to sauteed leeks. Delicious!

With all the five star ratings I was hoping for a really great tasting soup, but it was not to be.  We found it quite bland but saved it by adding a couple of very generous spoonfuls of sun-dried tomato pesto to the pot.  I roasted my cauliflower at 425Â° as I always do.  I also always substitute evaporated milk for cream to cut down on fat.  The soup still had a very nice thick, creamy texture.  Thank you for sharing your recipe, chefsquig.

We really liked this soup but had to make some subs out of necessity.   Sweet onions for leeks and parsley for chervil.   I also cranked up the heat on the oven to 375ish to speed things along.  I also added in two red taters because my missus is a tater in soup nut.   That took a little of the flavor out of the broth, but it was still fantastic.   I will make again.   Thanks!

Thank you! Delicious and versatile. I only use my own broth and only had ham bone broth, which was excellent.  I decided to be bold and use dill and some red pepper flakes instead of chervil. I also thinly sliced some prosciutto, fried it, and sprinkled a bit on top just before serving.  My thoughts are that this is a great recipe that's healthy and adaptable to your own tastes and creativity.  Love this,

Oh my goodness, this soup is delicious!  I had never had nor cooked with a leek before.  And, I just love trying out new ingredients.  I came to the conclusion that my family likes leeks because they all loved this soup.  It is packed with flavor and held up nicely the next day for leftovers, always a plus in my book.  I made this up in the morning, cooled it down, and then reheated in the evening and added the last ingredients at this point.  I didnât have chervil, so I substituted dried parsley flakes.  A great soup that I will again be making in the fall, when the weather cools down.

I blended half per advice from another reviewer. I used homemade organic creole cream cheese in place of heavy cream. I also minced and added a jalepeno. I used vegetable stock. It is very delicious, the jalepeno makes is cream with a nice bit of zip.

This soup is the best ever! I made it into a dinner by adding chopped red peppers - sautÃ©ed with the leeks - and some sautÃ©ed shrimp and scallops. I also roasted the cauliflower for 35 - 40 minutes at 350.

Several issues with recipe.  1. Need to specify size of cauliflower florets; 2. Temperature for baking cauliflower is extremely low compared to time allotted. I used 350 for over 1hr. ; 3. Leeks need softening in butter until just translucent prior to adding flour; 4. Cook after adding flour just enough to blend, careful not to brown. 5 minutes is too long!  6. Overall time to prepare this soup is 1 1/2 hrs. To shorten time, simply parboil the cauliflower for 5-10 min. With common sense adjustments, this could be a very good recipe.

Exquisite recipe!  I made exactly as written except for the roasting part â I broiled it for 10-15 mins after I tried baking the cauliflower at 275 for 30 mins per the recipe instructions. I agree with the other posters that it must be a typo.  I also decided to puree 3 cups per another users suggestion.  The taste is phenomenal. Thanks so much for sharing the recipe chefsquig! Itâs a keeper.

Great combination of garlic, cauliflower and leek. Used thyme instead of chervil because I didn't have it.  My husband made this recipe and he considers himself a starter cook so it's fairly easy.

I would have given this 5 stars if the temperature for the cauliflower had been correct.  I roasted it at 375 degrees for 30 minutes but the temp could be higher depending on your oven. I did not use chervil or any substitute.  I added thin sliced carrots and also used the green stalks of the leeks as well.  This was the most delicious soup I've ever tasted!

Made for my gals poker group.  Everyone loved it.  I added 1/2 teaspoon of curry powder.  Mashed half of the soup with a hand masher and left the remaining chunky.  I will definitely make it again and again.

Wow!  I love this soup.  This is a wonderful combination of flavors.  If you didn't know cauliflower was one of the ingredients you'd swear this was potato leek soup. I followed the recipe except for some minor changes made out of necessity.  I used tarragon in place of chervil.  Also used low fat milk.  I used my emulsifier blender to create a  smooth finish leaving some chucks of cauliflower.  I will defiantly make this soup again.   One more thing.  I did read some of the other reviews regarding the low roasting temp 275 degrees.  If you do up the temperature, you will burn the fresh garlic.  I would suggest using garlic powder for roasting or sauteing the garlic by itself and add it to the recipe after the roasting is finished.

This soup is delicious, but I admit I did make some changes. First of all, I roasted the leeks with the cauliflower, garlic, and olive oil. I also added some celery to the roasting pan because I had it and it needed to be used. Once everything well roasted down (closer to an hour in the oven), I added it to the vegetable broth (used 2 cartons) and brought to a simmer for 20 minutes. For spices, I used thyme and fresh ground pepper. Then I used an immersion blender to mix. I did not add any dairy to it right away because it didn't need it and it's healthier without heavy cream. Once you reheat it (leftovers are even better than fresh), add a splash of fat-free half and half it you need the creaminess. Thanks for the recipe!

I made several changes to the recipe to turn it into a rich, thick, savory soup. I used 1/4 vegetable bouillon and 3/4 chicken stock. I turned up the oven temp to 420 and roasted the cauliflower about 25 minutes, until it was lightly caramelized. I then pureed half the cauliflower with half the stock before adding it to the sauteed leeks to which I had already added a shallot. Instead of using heavy cream, I used 1/2 half-and-half and 1/2 2% milk. I didn't have tarragon, so I took the spices in a different direction. In addition to sea salt and cracked pepper, I used  2 bay leaves, a whole star anise, 3/4 tsp cumin, and 2 tsp Morten & Basset Chinese 5-Spice. I simmered all of this on very low heat (it wasn't even bubbling) without a lid for about an hour. To serve the soup, I added a garnish of shishito peppers, fried on medium heat in olive oil on one side until they blistered. I then used tongs to turn them over, added some sea salt and blistered the other side. When they were done (about 8 minutes total), I removed them from the pan and poured the olive oil from the frypan into the soup. Then I coarsely diced the peppers and mounded them in the middle of the serving. I think peppered bacon would add a nice kick as an alternate garnish.

This was a good low calorie soup. I blended it up and used 3 cloves of garlic, then added dried thyme and rosemary. It would be even better with bacon or ham. After weighing everything and using a calorie app, I came up with 188 calories per serving.

Made this over the weekend. It's a pleasant soup and would make a good accompaniment to a bold-tasting sandwich or serve as an good appetizer to a roast. Agree with previous reviewers that the cauliflower temperature was too low. I did 350 degrees for about 20 minutes. I also used my immersion blender to create a creamier soup. Will make again.

Loved it! Some changes I did: I sautÃ©ed onion, garlic and cauliflower instead of baking them. Added other ingredients except for milk and chives. Added fresh parsley and cayenne pepper. I purÃ©ed into a creamy consistency. Just perfect for us.

This soup is wonderful! I took the liberty of adding quite a bit of dried dill weed along with some green peppercorn, thyme, etc., and some fresh chopped basil. I also added extra butter/olive oil/cream, and substituted vegetable broth for the chicken broth to meet my vegetarian preferences, which was fine, but if you're a meat-eater then definitely stick to chicken. The soup was pretty plain before I added the dill and extra butter, so I highly recommend those two things. Oh, and onion. I added some onion. Delicious soup!

Can't believe how good this tasted. Thank you for all the reviews I read. I too did not have chervil and used parsley instead. Also, I pureed about 2/3 of the recipe for a delicious thick soup. Yummy!

This soup was easy to make and very tasty. (It was hard not to eat up the cauliflower when it came out of the oven).  The only ingredient changes I had to make was by using half and half instead of whipping cream and dried parsley instead of chervil.

I can't quite  put my finger on what is missing for me. I couldn't find the chervil but substituted parsley.  What made a huge difference for me was I fried up some bacon and made homemade croutons and wala - way better.

I used olive oil in place of vegetable oil, used 4 cloves of garlic, and replaced heavy cream with skim milk. I used 3 leeks. Followed the directions as written with the exception of roasting the cauliflower at 375 for 30 minutes. I used an immersion blender for a creamier texture.
The flavor is very good and I will definitely make again!

The only change I made was to use 3 garlic cloves, which was a mistake, as it made the dish overwhelmingly garlicy. I like garlic, but my wife doesnât and refused to eat it. The first night it tasted pretty good, but I had no appetite for it after that, and eventually composted the remainder. In my opinion, cauliflower and leeks do not provide an adequate basis for this dish.

This is a quick, flavorful soup. The original recipe did not indicate when to add the flour. I realized it when all the ingredients were simmering and I saw the flour left on the counter. I removed about 1/2 cup of the liquid and mixed the flour into that before adding to the simmering pot on the stove. It still turned out well. I added thyme and a sprinkle of oregano for herbs. I didn't have cream so used regular milk and it was still so delicious. I will definitely make this again because it was a nice hot, comfort-food soup. Thanks for sharing this easy recipe.

This soup is absolutely fantastic!!  I used Better Than Boullion to make my broth ... used my air fryer to roast the cauliflower ... and used my immersion blender to smooth out the biggest pieces of cauliflower ... sprinkled some bacon bits when I served it ... so simple ... this is going to become a regular for us :)

This was excellent! I followed some suggestions from other reviews like blending the soup once it was all cooked through. I added two bulbs of roasted garlic that I roasted while I was roasting the cauliflower both at 400 degrees for 45 minutes. My oven takes a little longer than mod

I rendered some chopped bacon then removed bacon from pan. I used that oil to cook down the leeks. After I put everything together and soup had finished simmering I purÃ©ed the whole thing. Texture still a little grainy because of the cauliflower.  I then added in the bacon Bits Iâd cooked and also some diced potatoes I had cooked in the microwave, along with the water. It was delicious and chunky.

Surprisingly great soup!  Although, admittedly, being a good cook I read the recipe, got the idea and started cooking, so I did quite likely adjust the temperature and/or quantities as needed for my taste. Still, excellent combination.

I did make changes, in part to reduce the fat and in part because I didn't read the directions well. I used olive oil cooking spray to roast the cauliflower with garlic powder. I cut the amount of butter by half to cook the leeks and half and half instead of cream. I was going to substitute tarragon for chervil, but then I couldn't find the tarragon. So, I went a different direction with seasoning and used turmeric. I used an immersion blender to partially puree the soup. It was very tasty, and I was glad to find a recipe for which to use the leeks I got at the farmer's market. Since my version was definitely a variation, I would like to try the original version for comparison.

We love this. We made it for a Mabon gathering since it used seasonal vegetables and enjoyed it immensely. 

I followed the recipe faithfully with the exception of the chervil which I did not have.  I wonder if it would have toned down the garlic flavor or enhanced it. I may try it again using fresh parsley or tarragon which I almost always have on hand. 

I also might try it using vegetable stock, and make it a dish I can serve to vegan friends. 

Roasting the cauliflower with the garlic oil was a marvelous step and the whole kitchen smelled aromatic and warm on a cool autumn day. Great seasonal dish.

**** At my husband's request for meat - I added some shredded chicken and it was better for carnivores.

Very tasty.  I did make a couple of adjustments because I used what I had on hand.  I substituted chicken broth for the vegetable broth. I added a couple of pinches of curry powder. Just before serving, I used my immersion blender to smooth out the texture (leaving a few bits of cauliflower to keep it interesting). Oh, and I roasted the cauliflower at 400 degrees for about 30-35 minutes. Next time I will use garlic salt or powder on the cauliflower, since the minced garlic got a little brown in the oven. Or I will add the minced garlic directly to the pot to cook with all the ingredients.

As with a few of the other reviewers,  I used evaporated milk instead of cream, no chervil so I just used parsley and I added a couple slices of bacon, chopped!  delicious!!! And I agree with one of the other reviewers,  you probably dont have to add flour.  I also used an immersion blender just prior to adding the cauliflower,  give it a try, well worth it!!

This was a really simple recipe and even my husband loved it. I did add a few more spices; chives, thyme and parsley and threw an immersion blender in there for a little bit. I substituted whole milk too as it was what I had. Delish! My husband said it tasted very buttery and with only 3 tablespoons of butter... that is amazing!

Good soup. I gave the soup a light purÃ©e to reduce the larger cauliflower pieces. I still left it âchunkyâ though.

When I first made it, I thought it was a bit bland but the second day, it was dynamite. I froze three servings. Will definitely make it again.

Used 375 to roast cauliflower and garlic bulb.  Emulsified to be a cream soup.  Very flavourful.

Very good but should have doubled the recipe. It didn't make much. Also I roasted the cauliflower in extra virgin olive oil at 400 degrees. I like my cauliflower a little charred.

I roasted cauliflower at 425F for 30 minutes and it was perfect!  I also did not have heavy cream on hand, so I just put in milk which worked out fine.  I served with shredded cheddar on top of soup and my teenage son said it was delicious!!!  I like this soup way more than leek and potato!

Love this recipe! So enjoyed the soup. Hearty yet all veggie   I used veggie stock the 2nd time I made it. Just as good. The only complaint is that it doesnât make a to.

This soup is delicious!  The only change I made was to use chives and dried parsley in place of chervil, because I couldn't find it anywhere.  I also added four strips of crumbled bacon, per another reviewer's suggestion.  We loved it!  Will make again and soon!

An Amazing soup that I added some grilled chicken pieces to and some fresh basil leaves from my garden because I had no chervil. I also added some"Better Than Bouillon" roasted chicken flavor with about a cup more water since I added the grilled chicken to make it a meal. We'll definitely have this again!

I had purchased a beautiful head of cauliflower at the market this weekend and decided I would try this soup. It is a wonderful blend of flavors. I did make a few changes out of necessity. I eliminated the chervil and added both sauteed celery and steamed carrots. I also used almond milk rather than heavy cream and blended about half the cauliflower into the milk. This soup makes a great fall/winter meal!

Since I do Keto, I had to 'keto-ize' it.  I like my cauli very roasted and brown so did it @400 degrees.  I had some leftover radishes so I roasted them too.  (don't wrinkle your nose until you have tried cooked radishes; taste a lot like turnip.)  I only had a small amt. of chicken broth so added some veg broth, and some fresh kale.  I can't use flour so used some Glucomannan to thicken, as well as a bit of creamed cheese.  Pureed it all, and it is so darned good!  very comforting, and perfect for fall and a KETO diet with the modifications.  This could be served with a bit of cheese and bacon crumbles on top, or just as is.  thanks for this nice recipe.  Surely a keeper.

Loved this soup. The roasted cauliflower makes it. Like other reviewers I roasted it at 400 for about 30 minutes to get a nice brown. I also didnât have chervil so I used smoked paprika instead. Canât wait to make it again!

Doubled the garlic, and I used the green parts of leeks too! Used dried parsley flake since I didn't have chervil, and added red pepper flake for some heat. Delicious!!

Great soup! The only thing I changed was I used coconut milk instead of cream, sautÃ©ed shallots with the leeks, used 3 leeks and added some cayenne for a little heat. Everyone loved it!

This was good. I made it without the flour to keep it Keto. Thus it was thinner but still very tasty. I did smash some of the cauliflower to thicken it. That worked. Next time I make it I will add more cauliflower after smashing some of it. I made this for company and one person had three bowls. We all really loved it.

This was so good! I adapted this for my instant pot and added some aged white cheddar and bacon at the end. I also omitted the flour, subbed fresh parsley for the cheerful and semi emulsified it at the end. This was fabulous! Totally would make this again.

I have made this twice.  You definitely need to roast the cauliflower at a higher temperature and next time I will put the cloves in whole or halved so they don't get too crispy.  Delicious any way you roast it!

Really a tasty soup.  What I do to roast cauliflower is cook it in a pressure cooker (not too much) and then roast it on my grill using a grill pan so it doesn't fall through.  We eat it that way all the time.  It is fantastic in this soup.  Only thing I would change is to add the flour AFTER the leeks are cooked.  1/4 cup of flower into so little butter didn't work well, but it turned out ok.

I am vegetarian so I always use vegetable stock. I never understood why you would want chicken stock in a vegetable soup anyway. It was very tasty, but I think it could use more liquid. I also used parsley in place of chervil .  I agree with the person who said that a higher temperature was required to brown the cauliflower.

I used the ingredients as written, but I didn't follow the instructions. I cooked the cauliflower in the soup pot with the oil and garlic and then added the remaining ingredients instead of roasting the cauliflower in the over first. I don't think skipping that step altered the flavor and it saved some time. There were no leftovers for lunch the next day. I'll make this again :-)

Didn't have cream, so used milk and a bit more butter.  Didn't have chervil so used fresh parsley. Cooked diced potatoes in broth while waiting for cauliflower to soften and roast. Delicious. And very forgiving. You don't have to have these exact ingredients for it to be delicious. Thanks so much!

Read the reviews took some advice on roast temp 400 degrees for 25 minutes. I had on hand some homemade broth that had a nice spice range to it. The soup was amazing especially once the flavours melded.

This  soup is FABULOUS!  I never had made it before, nor had I cooked with  Leeks or  for that matter roasted cauliflower (which btw is awesome by itself I've discovered)  Aside from the typo's in oven temp - should have been 375 and NOT a tablespoon of pepper - I followed the recipe pretty close.  I had a huge head of cauliflower and used extra garlic plus salt when roasting til nicely browned.  I also used the white plus light green leaks cut in half moons.  Since my cauliflower was so big I used about  1 -1/2 qts chicken broth  (one box plus some i  had frozen ) and I mashed the cauliflower several times  so no real florets were left. I waited to closer to the end to add my heavy cream .  I also used a small amount of  frozen fresh thyme  as I didn't have chevil  and  at the end some fresh parsley.  I tweaked the season's with a bit of Lawry's and a shake of cayenne.  - I had some bacon crumbles but never put any on my soup - My husband didn't expect to like it and ate two bowls  only using the bacon with his first bowl - I am now having more as a midnight snack - this is a definite keeper!

I frequently make a cauliflower, carrot, and ginger soup, for which I simmer the veggies together, pulse puree, add milk and then thicken with a cornstarch/butter roux. So, I thought I this soup with roasted cauliflower and sauteed leeks sounded tasty. However, for me it was just awful: it had the texture of paste and tasted strange, so I fed it to the sink monster.

I have made roasted cauliflower before and my wife loved it.  When I saw this recipe, I made and mashed the cauliflower with a potato masher producing a thicker soup that I prefer.  My wife liked this soup just like the roasted cauliflower.

Super yummy and healthy. Creamy and great flavor. My only complaints are that the temperature for roasting the cauliflower is way too low (I bumped it up to 375), and the calories are rather high for what amounts to a vegetable soup. 242 calories per serving and the recipe says it makes 6 servings, but the "servings" are rather small. If you are looking to cut calories, this recipe as-is may not work out. I am going to try it with whole or 2% milk and reduce the oil and butter
 to see if it is still just as good with less fat. otherwise, a yummy homemade soup.

Turn the oven up to 375 at least. Didn't have chervil. Added mushrooms. Immerse blended. Added fresh parsley, homemade croutons and shredded cheddar cheese before eating.  Seems to be missing something. Won't make again.

Wonderful flavour! Roasted cauliflower at 350* for 25 min. I did add  celery...just because I love it, and I also subbed 2% milk for the cream for a few less calories.
Definitely a keeper recipe.

Substituted coconut flour for the all-purpose flour to keep it Paleo and added additional moisture in the form of vegetable broth, fresh sweet basil in place of chervil, diced chicken breast for protein, and some Head Country seasoning salt. Delicious and different. Gets better after it sets a day or two. Even my husband who avoids vegetables ate a great big bowl of the "white gumbo" as he called it and said how good it was. This will definitely get made again.

I will make this again.  That said, it called for WAY too much pepper for my family.  My children could not eat it, it was almost too spicy for me, and my husband was glad because he didn't have to add hot sauce to it like he does everything else.  My family likes very flavorful food, but I was not wanting to make a spicy soup.

This is a 5 star soup! Excellent flavor. I happened to have both cauliflower and leeks to use up and  wanted to make it pretty close to as-written the first time through. I had to give the recipe 4 stars, however, because there are two things that I definitely think need fixing in order for it to work. You do need to broil the cauliflower or roast it at a higher temp in order to get it done (nothing roasts at 275). And an entire tablespoon of pepper would have been FAR too overpowering. At the suggestion of other reviewers, I added a little at a time and ended up at about a tsp of freshly ground pepper, and I wouldn't add any more. I didn't add anything like cheese or potato or bacon (though they would be good) because there are all sorts of potato and cheese soups out there. I wanted a true cauliflower leek flavor, and this soup has it. The only other modification I made is  I skipped the flour (personal preference) and pulled out maybe 75% of the cauliflower solids along with plenty of the broth and blended them in a blender, returning to the pot to give the soup a nice creamy texture without needing flour. I found that the additional simmering time really wasn't necessary. In the end, I gave my husband and father a small bowl each, and they both said it was absolutely delicious!  I'm thrilled to have his recipe to add my collection of great soups! (I should mention, too, that I didn't have chervil, nor could I find it nearby, so I subbed parsley, as others suggested. I rea

My wife and I thought this recipe was great and definitely a keeper.  I only make 2 changes:  I roasted the cauliflower at 450Â° for 30 minutes and I left out the chervil since my wife doesn't like it.  We were amazed at similar to potato-leek soup it was and how few carbs were in it!

This is very delicious!! I used white & orange cauliflower because that's what I had on hand. Also used Evaporated Milk, didn't have the cream. Roasted cauliflower 40 min @ 450 & used dried Thyme, didn't have chervil or Parsley. Then I followed the directions & WOW.... very tasty. Added shake of Parmesan to my bowl just because, well it's Parmesan cheese & I love it!. Will def make again, VERY EASY... :-)

Let me say that this recipe is a keeper. It's homemade and delicious and makes for great fall and winter comfort food yet is still light enough to eat during the summer.  I'm only giving it 4/5 stars because I bumped the temperature up to 425 NOT 275. I blended 3/4 of the soup with an immersion blender before serving.

I tried to keep this as true as possible but couldn't find chervil so I used a small bunch of fresh parsley and kicked it up with cayenne to keep it to myself.  This is wonderful and easy and made a good breakfast.

This was okay but not great.  Be sure to add the salt and pepper gradually. There's a lot of black pepper in the recipe.  I think it might be better with less black pepper, a touch of cayenne, and maybe some Parmesan.

It is a very tasty soup. I added the flour at the same time as the leeks and it turned into a gloppy mess that stuck to the pan. Next time I would sautÃ© the leeks until tender before adding the flour.

At 275 degrees, I had to roast the cauliflower almost an hour to soften it. Next time I would set the temp much higher.

 I wanted to replace the cream with whole milk, so I did not add it at the time that the instructions said, I left it near the end of the simmering time. I found it odd to be adding it so early.

Absolutely amazing! I increased the heat on the cauliflower so I could get a better char and speed up the process. I also only added a pinch of chervil and purÃ©ed the soup in a blender. I'll definitely make this again.

Ridiculously delicious.  Used dry parsley, low fat milk, and roasted cauliflower at higher heat.  Makes enough for four.  I will make again.

Best soup I've ever eaten. I mix in brown rice and chopped chicken sausage for a complete and hardy meal! Delicious! PS substitute fat free cream and half the butter still taste GREAT!

Wow. This tastes 10x better than I ever thought it would! I created an allrecipes account just to declare this! Used 1/2 terragon and 1/2 parsley instead of chervil.

Best cauliflower soup I've ever tasted. Chervil is not available in my local grocery store, so I substituted chives. Wife loved it too!

Really great flavor.  My hubby was skeptical as he's never had anything with leeks in it before, and he ended up really liking it.  And my 2YO too - couldn't believe she actually ate some too - she's the pickiest eater!  Stuck to the recipe for the most part - instead of vegetable oil, I used olive; and I used 2T of butter instead of 3T.  Maybe next time though, I might try half and half or 2% instead of the heavy whipping cream to cut down on calories.  

Oh, I did like other reviewers mentioned - I roasted my cauliflower at 425 for 20-30min.  And I did use an immersion blender for a portion.  

Really good and easy to make!

Really good.  I added Parmesan Cheese and a bit of crushed red pepper.  
Also, I didn't have chervil, so I substituted basil instead.

This was quite a treat and turned out delicious and creamy.  I followed some of the recommendations I read in the other reviews.  I used only one big leek, roasted the cauliflower for 30 minutes in 400 degree temperature, used 1/3 cup of half n half cream instead of heavy whipping cream, 3/4 tsp pepper instead of 1 tablespoon, and dried parsley instead of the chervil.  And I did blend half of the soup for a creamier texture.  My whole family went back for seconds.

I couldn't find me regular recipe so I found this one since it sounded about the same. I'll use this one from now on. The only difference I made was use chive oil instead of the chervil. I like to Mae cauliflower soup to use up leftover chive oil, so that made sense. Added fresh bread. I actually roasted the cauliflower in the morning while I was getting ready for work, so this was actually I pretty quick dinner.

The flavor of this was very unexpected. It almost reminded me of a canned cream soup or a clam chowder without the seafood. I always try to make things easy during the week. I just sauteed the vegetables in a 3" pot, added the liquid and simmered about 5 minutes, then put into my blender. I made a half a recipe, due to what I had, and yielded 3 servings or exactly half of the suggested amount for the full recipe. For ease I used 1 cup defrosted frozen leeks. I subbed milk for the small amount of cream. I dont know what chervil is, so that did not get added. To reduce the sodium, I just did a good pinch of salt instead of the amount suggested. I also made broth out of broth paste with half the amount suggested. It was still plenty salty. I also only did a good pinch of black pepper to taste.

Outstanding! Used parsley instead of chervil and used immersion blender on about half the soup. Per other's reviews, I roasted the cauliflower at 375 for about 30 min in convection oven. New favorite soup and I'm not a huge fan of cauliflower!

This soup was delicious!! Only had one leek and no chervil and there was still tons of flavor in this soup. The temp for roasting the cauliflower should be higher, I had to cook it for a lot longer than 30 minutes at 275, before it got tender. I pureed mine in the blender when the soup was done cooking and it was a wonderful silky thick soup! Perfect for winter!

This recipe is to DIE for. I wanted lower cal and I didn't have heavy cream anyway, so I used about a quarter cup of light sour cream. Parsley and a dash of celery salt instead of chervil. I agree with someone who said 1 T of pepper has to be a typo. And you should roast the cauliflower at more like 400 degrees. But I used about 1.5 teaspoons and thoroughly enjoyed the pepper bite. I pureed it a bit with an immersion blender. It was thick and rich, and tasted like it was loaded with cheese! I will make it again and again.  This soup disappeared quickly.

I liked this soup, but didn't love it.  I felt it needed a little more flavor.  My grocer didn't have chervil, so I followed another reviewer's suggestion and added parsley and dried chives.  This is my first time cooking with leeks, so didn't know what to expect, but my leeks had a very mild smell, so maybe that was where my flavor was lacking.  I will have to try it again, with perhaps more pungent leeks.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, chefsquig!

This was delicious. I may have added too much cauliflower so mine was pretty thick but I will try adding less next time. I added a minced jalapeno which gave it a nice zing and I pureed most of it but did leave some chunks. Shaved some parmesan on top - yummy!

I've made this soup twice in the past month.  You just have to remember that the cauliflower needs to be roasted.  I preheat the oven and begin heating the deep pan for the leeks when I put the cauliflower in.  I reduce the butter to 2T and use Half and Half instead of cream.  I use chives instead of chervil.  Great recipe for winter!

This was very good!  My market didn't have chervil so I used dried parsley instead.  And once the soup had simmered for awhile I used a hand potato masher to break down the cauliflower a bit.  It was a very good soup.  Thanks for the recipe!

I don't love cauliflower but I do love soup....and now, I love this roasted cauliflower and leek soup!  I followed the directions, with one exception.  I used a coconut/almond milk instead of the heavy cream.  Delicious!  I did also use my immersion blender to puree the bulk of the soup, leaving some small bits of cauliflower.  The smell of the roasting cauliflower and garlic let me know this would be a great soup!  It is a wonderfully fragrant and savory soup that I will make again and again!

Great soup recipe!  I cut back just a little bit on the pepper and will probably use about 2 tsp rather than 1 T the next time I make it.  Also used a little of the pale green portion on the leeks.  Delicious.  Added some asparagus the second day.  Also delicious!

Delicious! Wonderful! I'll make this again and again. It didn't however pass for potato-leek soup.  Mashed cauliflower is a great substitute for mashed potatoes, and I thought this might be a similar trick.

I followed advice from reviewers and roasted the cauliflower at 300 or 325 to get it browner, I used milk not cream, I used parsley for chervil (which I don't own), I blended 1/2 to 2/3's of the soup in a blender, and I cut back on the pepper.  I served it with some Irish Soda Bread and it made a great meal.  Next time I'll try a little bacon in it and I might try yoghurt instead of the milk or cream.  I was confused by "use only the white" of the leeks, but I cut them back an inch below where the leaves fanned out and it worked very well.  I was worried it I would lose the leek flavor if I cut too far back.

Very very Good!  Versatile and easy!  In my opinion it honestly doesn't need the cream!! - I used 1% milk and blended the soup a little to get rid of large chunks.  As others suggested I also reduced the pepper, added some broccoli and used whatever herbs I had on hand instead of chervil. Definitely a keeper!

I love leeks and any vegie roasted, but I wasn't as crazy about this soup as most people.  It lacked something -- maybe some cheese would give it more flavor.

Didn't have cauliflower but had plenty of broccoli on hand so used that... looking for something to use up my broccoli and leaks (get organic produce delivered). Didn't have cream or condensed milk on hand as other had said but did have coconut milk... added a can of chicken broth pureed it... doubled the chervil and left out the butter next time will try leaving out the flour to lower the carbs. Will make w/ skim condensed milk or coconut milk whichever I have on hand. Also used himalayan salt instead of kosher... loved the roasted cauliflower and bumped up the garlic to 3 cloves it was awesome.

Loved it and making it a second time with a few changes: half the flour and used almond milk instead of cream to reduce Calories-still delicious by the way! Also baked cauliflower for 25min at 450celcius, I think the 250 must have been a typo. Also blended it as recommended by others, becomes nice and thick. My three-year-old  is asking for more!! Yum yum, thanks its the first soup she has ever finished :)

This is really good soup. I forgot the garlic, and don't have chervil so I used parsley. I probably used 1/4 teaspoon of pepper, I can't imagine a whole tablespoon of black pepper in this. I also used an immersion blender to puree the soup. I'll definitely make this again.

I loved this soup. It was easy to make and very delicious. I didn't have Chervil so I used the same amount of tarragon and it was wonderful. This is a soup I will make again.

i, too, made a few changes. cranked up the heat on the oven to 400 for an extra 10 minutes at the end of the roasting time on the cauliflower to get it browned, used half & half in lieu of the heavy cream, and substituted 1 TBSP of chopped fresh fennel leaves for the dried chervil. i also pureed about half of the cauliflower with some of the stock before putting it altogether to simmer at the end. this is a very savory soup!

Awesome flavor! I ommited the heavy whipping cream to cut down on fat so I blended most of the cauliflour & 1/2 of the leeks so it would be more creamy- also added chives, Husband says it needed some meat but I think it was a perfect and healthy dish, my 7 year old liked it too.

I agree with one other reviewer, the amount of pepper is too much so I have cut back quite a bit, and this 2nd time around I am adding in some broccoli. The soup vanished (even an 8 yr old) so it's a keeper.  Thanks so much for sharing your recipe!

Great taste. We pureed half the mixture and added 4 slices of bacon. Real good.

Wow!!! This soup is so yummy! I wasn't expecting to love this soup, and my husband who hates trying new recipes especially without meat really really loved this soup too. I will definitely be making this all winter long, and it's so easy to make. I only made two changes, I used stone ground whole wheat flour, 1/2 tsp dried tarragon, and 1/2 tsp dried parsley because I could not find dried chervil at the supermarket.
