This recipe is wonderful as is! The only reason why I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the  temp is off. It needs to be baked at 375 degrees for 20 minutes, then an additional 5 minutes after adding topping. Also I recommend mixing all or at least half of the bacon into the batter.

I did not have baking mix so I used 1 c. flour, 1 t. baking powder, 1/2 t. baking soda, and 1/4 t. salt.  I also mixed the bacon in before baking. It was good, except I thought it was way too sweet. If I make it again I will cut out all or part of the sugar.

This was very good!  I had to substitute pancake mix for the baking mix, but it didn't seem to affect the finished product.  I also added some breakfast sausage.  I cut back the sugar in half and next time I think I'll omit it altogether.  We added a drizzle of maple syrup to the top after serving and it was great.  I did as others suggested and cooked it at 375 for 20 minutes, then 5 more minutes after adding the cheese and bacon to the top.  It deflated a bit when I took it out of the oven and set it down, so be careful, or just add the bacon and cheese while it's in the oven.

My 9 year-old son says, "I loved it.  It was great!  We cut it into slices and I ate mine like pizza!  I helped Mom mix stuff together."

This is a wonderful breakfast recipe.  My 15 year old son picked it out from the website and made it 2 mornings in a row!  It has common ingredients and comes out light with a hint of maple and all the cheese and bacon on the top is amazing.  It comes out of the oven with great wow power like it was made in an expensive restaurant.  The basic recipe make 4 servings but easily can be doubled for more hungry folks.  I find it very flavorful and filling.  Topped with real maple syrup it is a real winner.  I am going to experiement a bit with my cast iron frying pan and cover it with tin foil to see if we can get it to work for summer camping trips.

I doubled the recipe and made it in a cake pan instead and this turned out so yoummy.  I'm thinking the next ime I make it I might add more cheese on top and double the bacon, and mix some of it in with the batter before I bake.  But even without any changes, I thought this recipe was very good!

This was very good and devoured by my family. However, the flavor combo was a bit strange. I will definitely make this again but I think I'll experiment with it. I did find the cooking time was way off, I had to turn the temp up to 375 after cooking it at 350 for fifteen minutes because it was still raw in the middle.

Really delicious. Kind of like a homemade McGriddle. I ran out of syrup, so I sprinkled with butter and a pinch of sugar in lieu of the syrup topper. I will make next time I have overnight guests.

Great recipe!  Hits all the favorites of breakfast.  I had to cook a little longer than the recipe indicates, but other than that, I left the recipe as is.  Thanks for sharing!

I made this with country sausage and way more cheese than the recipe asked for. While it took some skill to "sprinkle" the sausage and cheese on top (it was way taller than the pan!), it turned out beautifully!

Great mix of flavors. I will probably increase maple syrup to 1/3 cup next time for more maple flavor. Wonderful breakfast for dinner recipe!

I thought it was just good but I was told later that it was better than regular pancakes. Did a few changes,I used a monterey jack chees instead, light corn syrup and left out the sugar but included salt. I'm thinking what I can do next.

We did not want cheese in ours so we did this a little differently, as this is a very adaptable recipe.  Cooked 7 thick slices of bacon; mixed the baking mix with the remaining ingredients minus the cheese and minus 1/4 cup milk and plus a teaspoon of vanilla.  Sprayed the pan with Pam and baked til toothpick came out clean.  Yummy all around on Thanksgiving morning.  May try with sausage next time and top off with blueberry sauce.  Thanks for sharing.

Made this for breakfast today, and while I like the idea of it, the taste was a bit off for me.  I think that next time, I will try using maple sausage, cooked and crumbled, mixed in the batter, instead of the bacon.  I did take the recommendation of not using the additional sugar, and I think I am glad I did - the maple flavor was pleasing, without being too sweet (and you could always serve extra syrup at the table for those who have a sweet tooth).  Also, the cheese on top didn't do anything for us - will eliminate a few calories next time.  And cooking time and temperature was way off - I baked at 375, and it still took 30 minutes. Thanks for a good starting point.  5/08 - made this again, but with maple sausage and mozzarella instead of cheddar - much improved flavor, at least to our liking.  Kept everything else the same - no sugar other than the syrup, mixed everything together, 375 degrees, no cheese on top -- a wonderful breakfast!  I will serve this for Thanksgiving breakfast - my stepmother doesn't like eggs or sweet things for breakfast (but she does like waffles and pancakes), so this will work just fine!

Yummy!  I used pancake mix, omitted the white sugar, and used maple flavored bacon.  I also did it at 375 like other users recommended

This is fabulous and my whole family loved it!  I would read the other commenters' notes and adjust the time and temperature.  I also omitted the sugar, as the maple syrup provided enough sweetness.

This was a great recipe, we had it for dinner last night!  The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because I made a couple of tweaks to the recipe.  I used maple sausage instead of bacon and added half to the mix, I cut the sugar to 2 tsp, added a little extra cheese in the mix and baked at 375 for about 25 minutes for it to set in the middle.  It came out pretty well, although my hubby and I both agreed that it could have either used a little more maple syrup in the recipe or as others have suggested some syrup topping.  I will definitely be making this again and am already planning to make it for my parents when I go home on Christmas morning!

We didn't have bacon so we used sausage.  We also followed another suggestion of mixing in the meat which vs. Leaving it on top.

This was a great recipe and easy to make. I found Jiffy Baking Mix in the store. I doubled the recipe and baked in a 9x13 dish. I mixed the bacon in with the mix and baked at 375 for 35 minutes. I omitted the sugar and used 1/3 syrup. Family loved it.

Just made it this morning.  Excellent.  It has everything we love, pancake, bacon, cheese and syrup.  YUM YUM!!!  Made it exactly how written, but the cook time and temp is off.  Cooked 375 for 15-20 min.  Oh yeah and added some bacon to the mix and then put some on the top at the end with the cheese.  Will be in our rotation of breakfast when we get tired of plain pancakes or waffles.  Probably will try with sausage next time.

Used pancake mix instead of baking mix, generic syrup instead of good maple syrup, and increased the proportions by about 50% (recipe as given isn't enough to feed 4) and it still came out quite good.  Everyone liked it and was sad there wasn't any extra left over.

The basic idea for this recipe is great!  Based on the prior reviews, I made these changes:
* increased the milk to 1/2 cup
* increased the cheese to 2 cups (I used a sharp Vermont white cheddar)
* mixed 1 1/2 cups of the cheese into the batter and sprinkled the other 1/2 cup on top
* sprinkled a little smoked paprika on top 
* added 1/4 cup of sour cream to the batter
* omitted the sugar
* used 1/2 lb of bacon, and added it to the batter instead of putting it on top
* Baked the casserole for 30 minutes at 350, topped with cheese and paprika, then baked for 10 more minutes
My husband and daughter loved this dish -- will definitely make it again!

Oh man!  This is soooo good!  I just made this dish for the second time- this time for Christmas morning breakfast with my parents and fiancee.  I mix about half of the bacon into the pancake batter, and I baked at 375 for about 18 minutes, then for 5 more after adding the cheese and bacon on top.  Amazing dish!!!  Served with fresh fruit and a slice or two of bacon, it made a delightful Christmas breakfast.

Be careful to cook thoroughly.  I used much more bacon than called for, putting about 6 crumbled strips in the batter and 4 crumbled as topping. I had a 4cheese mexican blend on hand so I used that instead of the cheddar.  I really liked it, but my partner thought it was a bit sweet for his taste.

I just give this recipe 3 stars cause I tried it, and it just turned out OK taste, not something I could say yummy. It was pretty dry, and you have to dump more syrup on it when you eat it. Maple syrup, cheese, pancake, and bacons, they are good to eat together, but cook seperately. Yes, it's much easier to cook them together this way, but for the best taste, paying more efforts and time is worth it.

I have made this 3 times now and we like it because it is quick to make up and all the kids like it.  I use my own pancake recipe and it works well.  The last time I made it, I put some left over pumpkin puree and pumpkin spice in it.  A big hit!  We always use sausage (maple flavor) because I never buy bacon.  This is a versatile, convenient, easy recipe that is simple enough that my picky eaters like it.  Thanks for the idea!

I used complete pancake mix and substituted the white sugar with brown since I prefer brown sugar with maple syrup. I chopped up some bacon and stirred it into the batter. For the topping, I mixed the cheese and minced bacon and added when it was 1/2 way baked. I did have to cook it for about 25 mins and used the toothpick to determine the doneness. Topped it off with more syrup before eating. It was really good. This will be a weekend morning staple. Thanks!

made this last night and it was very good,  followed some of the others and baked it at 375 but I needed to cook it for and extra 10 minutes (30 in total)  then I added the cheese and baked it another 5 min.  I also mixed about 1/2 of the bacon into the pancake, then i sprinkled the rest when i added the cheese

This was a hit in my household!  I followed other reviewers' advice and made a few minor modifications:  1) mixed all of the bacon into the batter and none on top; 2) omitted the sugar; 3) used most of the cheese in the batter (about 1 cup of shredded jack/cheddar) and then about 1/4 cup + of mozzarella for the topping; 4) baked it at 375 degrees for 20 minutes, then an additional 5 minutes after adding the cheese.  Served it with scrambled eggs, fruit smoothies, and the rest of the bacon.  Yum!  And no syrup or butter needed on top.  NEW NOTE: I used Pamela’s GLUTEN FREE baking mix this time & it was at least as good as w/Bisquick. I also think this recipe feeds FOUR, but maybe we're just big eaters!  :-)  QUESTION: Has anyone ever made this recipe in muffin tins or in a 9” x 12” pan?  If so, what temp and for how long?  My kids would like to start having it in the morning before school and I want to make a few batches at once.  Thanks!

Very good and easy. I used multigrain pancake mix and turkey bacon and it turned out very yummy! I cooked at 375 for about 20 min and another 2-3 for the topping to crisp up. Great recipe.

This was really yummy, easy to make. I did make a few changes which I will probably stick to next time. One, I used pancake mix (only because I had it on hand) and ommitted the sugar entirely. Second, I added the bacon and ham (I also had some thick sliced spiral ham which I cut into very small cubes and sauteed while the pan was heating for the bacon) while the top of the mix was still fairly liquid, so that the meat become more incorporated into the batter. I'm glad I did this because the batter is very thick and rich when done so I think it would have been a little heavy on the bottom. I also added dried cranberries and that seemed to add a nice little punch that I think would have been missing otherwise. I think this recipe could be easily customized with whatever you feel like expirementing with - green onion, shallots, whatever - it was really good, I don't think you can mess it up!

We enjoyed this for breakfast; the unusual mixture of flavors was a pleasant change. I fried the bacon in my 8 inch cast iron skillet, drained off the fat and then baked the pancake in the skillet, so I only had one pan to clean. I too baked it at 375 for 20 minutes, added the topping and baked for an additional 5 minutes. I left out the sugar, but will try it with the sugar next time; I didn't think it was at all too sweet. It's only my husband and I and we only had one piece leftover, but we're ranchers and eat big breakfasts! A very easy, tasty recipe! Thanks!

My son has been asking for a "pancake with cheese" and the idea of just putting cheese on a pancake grossed me out, so I was glad to stumble on this recipe.  We followed it as is, but I think next time I might try adding scrambled eggs to the topping so it's a complete breakfast.

I made this for breakfast on Christmas morning for myself, my husband, and our twin sons.  My husband thought it was great!  It reminded me of those McGriddles from McDonalds.  I don't like those much, but this did taste better.  Next time I might leave out the maple syrup, and sprinkle the bacon on before I cook it.  It would be good with part of the bacon added to the batter, too!

It tasted a lot like a mcgriddle. The kids liked it and so did I. Next time I will double the bacon and mix it into the batter, it didn't really work out that well on top.

This was a nice change from our usual weekend eggs & bacon.  You have to eat it hot right out of the oven - texture doesn't hold up very long.

A keeper! Just a little bit on the dry side. Could add apple sauce if you like it sweeter or could add minced jalapeno pepper and bacon in the cake itself for a saltier one.

Very yummy!  

You can take this recipe in a few directions.  Sometimes I make it more sweet (less cheese, etc), sometimes more savory (more cheese, etc).  

I don't often have baking mix on hand, so I'm figuring out an alternative.

5 star taste! I didn't want to use baking mix but used base of sausage and pancake casserole. I did use the cookie sheet, had scaled down to 2 servings and it cooked in less than 20 (+ 5) minutes. Great recipe, one to keep!

This is a great recipe! I usually double it and bake it in a 9x13 pan for 25-30 minutes. I do add more bacon than the recipe calls for, but that's the only change I make. YUMO!

I'm so glad this was a featured recipe, otherwise I would have just blown right by this great recipe.  We all had our doubts about what the end product would be, but it satisfied the whole family, from the teen who doesn't like eggs, to me, who doesn't like pancakes.  It was enough to satisfy four of us.  Easy and a pleasant change from the typical breakfast!

We were not that impressed with the taste, but it could have been the preparation - Bisquick mix was used for the baking mix.  Next time we will try it with baking mix made from scratch.

Family loved it!  I agree, needed to bake a few minutes more at 350 degrees.  I didn't have bacon so just sprinkled some browned sausage on time.  Will definitely make again, maybe mix the bacon or sausage in like others suggested.

This was okay, but too thick to not be more moist (and I even added extra cheese inside, as well as most of the bacon, and omitted the sugar). I think i'll stick to making separate maple bacon in oven and individual pancakes instead of making this again...I'd still rather have a Mcgriddle over this as well!

Everyone loved it.  Flavors balance nicely.  I did as other reviewers suggested and mixed half bacon in with the batter, baked at 375 for 20 minutes then added other half of bacon along with cheese to the top for 5 more minutes.  I used only 1 tbsp sugar since I accidently put i a little too much maple.

Wonderful idea, but a bit too sweet. The second attempt was much better, as I cut out the sugar, added half the bacon to the mix, added more cheese (we LOVE cheese), and drizzled the top with maple syrup.

This was a yummy recipe although I did not add the cheese to the top...just put 3/4 cup inside as I didn't want my daughter to freak before finding she liked it - which she did!  As other said, we served it with hot maple syrup - really good.  My daughter wants to try it with sausage next time :-)

This is a great all in one breakfast that was a real kid-pleaser.   I had to use about 1/3 c flour as I was a bit short on baking mix, and I used turkey bacon, and it was still great.  I can see also how easy it would be to modify it to your family's preferences.  Also, I used regular pancake syrup as it was what I had on hand.  I will make this again!

Amazing! The sweetness from the sugar and syrup combined with the saltiness of the bacon is delicious. Top that off with warm cheesiness and it is divine!! I substituted brown sugar instead of white, and doubled the bacon and cheese. I also drizzled warm syrup on top, and my dad added butter. I've made it twice in the last week. Yum!

I used ground sausage as I had no bacon and it turned out just fine. I also used pancake mix as the baking mix and added more cheese and didn't add any sugar. The cooking time is indeed off, it needs to cook 20 minutes before adding the toppings. I also added a little drizzle of syrup on top of the toppings and let cook for an additional 5 minutes. It turned out good and the leftovers are good the next day as well.

I made this a savory dish using onions, bacon and cheese. No syrup and no sugar. This was for dinner and my husband, being Australian, doesn't understand the whole breakfast for dinner type thing or sugar with bacon..lol...so I made it without any sweetness. I didn't have baking mix so I used the recipe from a user the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt. It was fine, but not as moist as I would have wanted it. I served it with sour cream, fried potatos and green beans. I actually enjoyed it and it's so good with sour cream. Will try it for breakfast one morning and see how it turns out with syrup and sugar.

I used my own homemade whole wheat/whole grain baking mix and homemade maple syrup. There are no pictures because my kids and I ate all of this, there were no leftovers! (I did add a little more bacon because the boys and I like our food really bacon-y.) I suggest using a thick sliced hickory smoked bacon for the best result.

Made this 4 a group of teenagers who really enjoyed it and said it was a "repeat". They even took the left overs with them. Definitely allow for 20-30 minutes to bake; after 15 minutes the batter was still wet. I used Bisquick and  increased bacon by 1/2.  Followed recipe and only put bacon on top. Next time I will add this same amount of bacon to the batter (while also keeping bacon on top) and will also try adding sauteed onions to the batter. While the recipe is very good, I just think it would be even better if the batter had some ingredients mixed-in instead of it just being a base for the bacon and cheese. There's a lot of possiblities w/this recipe.

Excellent!! I added a little vanilla as well.  Try adding a 1/4 cup of chopped sweet onion for a twist.  Try it....you'll love it!  Saute' the onions until translucent first then add to the mix.

This is super easy and yummy!  We make it for brunch a lot.  The first couple of times it took a LOT longer than the recipe states, but after I used my larger pie plate, it's just about 20 minutes. I also mix the bacon in with the batter as well as on the top at the end. We have used sausage too, but we like the bacon the best. Also, I like syrup on top of mine, but the boys like it as is.  Thank you for the recipe!

This was a unique twist on breakfast and quite enjoyable! I recommend adding a majority of the bacon to the batter and then sprinkling the remaining bits midway through cooking. Most of the bacon bits fell off while eating because they merely sat on the surface. If you're craving something sweet, I would omit the cheese topping and use syrup while eating.

Takes like a McDonald's McGriddle.  The only thing I changed was that I had to bake it longer. After 10 minutes, it was still very soupy. It took 20 minutes for it to finish baking.  The bacon was fabulous, but it would also be great with maple flavored sausage.

My husband enjoyed it and I did too but I didn't love it so I gave it 4 stars. Very easy to make. I found though it was a bit bland. I think next time I will mix some of the bacon in with the mixture and maybe add some seasonings. I did increase the temperature to 375 as many reviews adviced and it did take longer to bake.

This was too interesting to pass up. Tried it last night for our "Breakfast for Dinner", and it was very good. The boys put a little syrup on top and decided it tastes like a McGriddle. We served ours with scrambled eggs and fruit. I turned my oven to 375 and it was perfect. My family wants to try it again, but with sausage. (works well with Gluten Free Biscuit Mix also)

My family really enjoyed it.  We used sausage b/c we were out of bacon, and none of us felt the need to add any syrup to it.  The cooking time IS off though, thanks to the reviewers who suggested 375 -- I still baked it for 1/2 hour!

My family loved this! I made it pretty much as the recipe says except :- i used half turkey bacon and i mixed half the total bacon (mixed turkey and regular) into the batter with the cheese. It was fabulous! hubby went back for seconds even though i'd served it with scrambled eggs! we're going to try freezing the remaining wedges for a quick meal in the week! thanks!

This pancake is so good!  I'd been wanting to make it for months and finally did today.  I only had shredded Mexican-style cheese blend, so I chose to put it all on top rather than inside.  I was afraid the cheesy flavor would get lost since it's grated so finely and is pretty mild to begin with.  Also, I used another reviewer's suggestion for baking mix substitute, but added about 2 tablespoons oil to make up for the oil in the cheese.  Left everything else the same.  Next time I actually will add more syrup to the batter so it will have more maple flavor and be sweeter.  It really is great just how it is though- the pancake turned out so soft and moist and had excellent flavor.  Next time I'm going to make it how the recipe says with cheese (possibly cubed) in the batter and a bit more maple syrup.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this this morning and it was INCREDIBLE!  I followed the recipe almost exactly, although I did use skim milk, reduced-calorie syrup, and lean bacon, but the flavor was still wonderful.  I also had to keep it in the over a little longer, as other reviewers have said (20 minutes before adding the bacon and cheese).  Will definitely make again!

I made this recipe exactly as written. However I had to bake for 20 min to start and then 3 minutes after sprinkling on the bacon and cheese. Make sure your baking mix is fresh. I made the mistake of not checking the expiry date and it had a horrible cardboard smell from the box - we could only handle a small piece and then had to throw most of it away and just ate the cheese and bacon off the top. My husband liked the flavor combination and would try it again with fresh baking mix but I thought it was way too sweet. If I made it again I would make it a savory pancake by adding some spices and eliminating the maple syrup completely.

Yummy!  I tried this recipe first with bacon and then with Lee Fogle's recipe for Breakfast Sausage.  The bacon was good, but the sausage version was faboo!  I grew up with Mrs. Butterworth's syrup, so I used that, and it was delicious.

I made this twice. Once with bacon and once with chunked sausage. Both were really good but not as flavorful as we would have liked. I might have to tweak this a bit because basically it is good.

Very delicious and easy to make ! My boyfriend was able to do it very easily ! The only thing he found is that he needed to bake it for 30 minutes and not 15. He also wants to try it with sharp cheddar. We both loved it!

I'll admit I was super wary about this recipe because it seems really strange to me, but this is really good! I didn't quite read (read: didn't read at all) through the recipe when I first found it, so I thought I was going to be making bacon pancakes. When I turned out one big one, I was a bit concerned. However, this is very, very good. I'm keeping this recipe. I made it as is, but I used mont jack cheese (had it on hand). Good stuff.

Baked this for our daughter, who was visiting for a few days.  She loved it, and so did husband and I.  Was moist and sweet.  Put bacon into batter and a little on top with a little cheese.  I loved the combination of the sweet coffee cake and bacon.  Couldn't taste the cheese at all, but added to the moistness.  I wanted to use some buttermilk I had, and didn't have any baking mix, so used 1 cup flour, 1 tsp. baking powder, 1 tsp soda, 1/4 tsp salt, and cut 1/4 cup butter into the dry ingredients.  Then used buttermilk instead of milk.  Overall, was delicious and will make it again for us or even company.

Based on the recommendations, I used only 1 tbsp of white sugar and baked at 375 for 15 min.  I also augmented the recipe using sausage-style veggie crumbles instead of bacon for a vegetarian option.  GREAT recipe!

Nice and easy!  Had to increase the cooking time as per previous reviewers and was out of milk so used half and half.  Also reduced the sugar, think next time will only use the maple syrup  as we don't like things overly sweet.

Ok, I made mine too thick, all the flavors together were wonderful! I really enjoyed this recipe. The next time i make this, I will have to make sure that I use a bigger baking dish on use less batter. I think the oancake would be much better if its not more than 1/2 inch thick

Excellent!  I took the advice of several reviewers and changed the temperature and time (even more because my oven cooks cool).  Also, added bacon to the batter and took out the sugar.  I used peppered bacon, so I'm not sure how that effected the flavor.  My husband is not a sweet/savory fan, but loved this!  THANKS!

We made this, but doubled it so we'd have leftovers to reheat later in the week for breakfast. I didn't add the sugar, but will next time (only half though) and I mixed most of the crumbled bacon into the mix, along with a bit more than half of the cheese. I would not have liked it with all of the bacon and that much cheese on the top. GREAT flavor, and so easy. This will be made again & again! The flavor was wonderful after letting it sit for 2 days!
Adding: I did add 1/8C sugar, and I was surprised at the extra ligt bit it added to the flavor. I have also cooked this at 375, and make sure you use a non-stick spray before pouring mixture into your dish.

Good, and a relatively quick breakfast for something that is baked in the oven.  It probably took about 30-40 min in my oven, so cook times aren't completely accurate for my oven.  I eliminated the sugar--didn't want that with the syrup (too sweet!).  I added maple flavoring bc we only have plain syrup.  I smelled the maple but didn't really taste it.  I also added a bit of parsley for taste and color, and put bacon in the mix as well as sprinkled on top.  All in all, pretty good.  Doesn't taste like MickeyD's breakfast sandwiches to me, which is good, bc I don't like those.  Makes enough for two breakfasts (only the two of us!)--I'll put the leftovers in our lunches for weekday breakfasts.  Thanks.

I gave it 3 stars only bc my husband liked it but nobody else did.  It doesn't beat having a stack of pancakes with bacon and sausage on the side.  I will most likely not make this again.

Great recipe.  Very reminiscent of a mcfamous food chain breakfast sandwich.  My husband said I could make this again, so I think it's a keeper!

I made this for breakfast today and it was ok.  We found it to be quite sweet...but the addition of bacon was a nice touch...we just sprinkled it on top along with the cheese for the last 10 minutes or so of baking.  The dish wasn't bad, but I probably won't make it again.  As an aside, it did re-heat well.

I love this recipe.  Everyone I've made it for loves it, too.  It sounds weird because it has cheese, bacon, and syrup but the sweet/salty combination is out of this world.

Wow!  This is so good!  Did not add sugar, doesn't need it.  Do cook it at 375 and check to be sure it is done before topping with the cheese and bacon.  I put at least 1/2 of the bacon in the batter and glad I did. I added more syrup when serving.  Yum!  It actually only serves 2....at least at my house.  :)  Will be making this again and again!

Tried this morning, even though it sounded a bit strange. Doubled the bacon and put half into the batter. Used my 9 1/2 inch, deep dish pie plate. Baked at 375 for 20 minutes. While it was baking I cooked up some scrambled eggs until just short of done. After 20 minutes, I removed the pancake and added the partially cooked eggs on top, sprinkled them with cheese, and added the rest of the bacon and put it back in the oven for about 5 minutes. Everyone, but me, had seconds, so fed four of us. It was a nice change. Next time I might use a little more syrup in the batter and omit the sugar. We did not feel the need for any extra syrup on top.

We absolutely love this!!!  I was really skeptical at first with such a different combination, but it really was great.  The combination of flavors was such a good different.  It came together pretty quickly as well and works great with turkey bacon on the top!

Pretty easy to make and it makes a nice change for breakfast. The only changes I made were that I made my own Bisquick mix and I omitted the sugar like suggested. My husband and my 14 month old son loved it!

Not a big breakfast casserole fan, but as far as those go, this was def. a fiver!  You really have to enjoy the flavor of sweet(maple syrup), salty(bacon), and cheesy all together to enjoy this recipe.  If not, this is not the breakfast for you!

It will become a regular breakfast treat in my home!

This was delicious and so easy to do, I agree with the other reviewers, the sugar is not necessary and it should be baked a bit longer. I also used crushed Mighty Bites cereal in it in order to use it up.

My group used this recipe for culinary arts class and it was delicious! Granted, it took us about 20 minutes rather than the 10 - 15 (it seemed soupy until then, but it might've been the oven since it's older), it was still delicious.

My family and I loved this recipe.  I did add a little more cheese into the batter and I didn't have any more maple syrup so I just added regular syrup but other than that we did what it says.  Also, the timing is a little off.  We did 375 degrees for 22 minutes before we put the rest of the cheese and the bacon on top.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I would leave out the sugar completely.  I halved the sugar and it was still plenty sweet.  Besides, why mix granulated sugar with maple syrup?  Next time I'll up the maple syrup a bit, or maybe drizzle some on top at the end of baking.

Also, the baking time is way too short.  Up the temperature to 400F and bake for 15 minutes, then check it.

I really liked the basic construct of this recipe.  I couldn't follow the recipe exactly because I didn't have everything required in my pantry.  Here's what I did.  I used whole wheat pancake mix, italian turkey sausage mixed into batter instead of bacon, and some frozen broccoli florets.  Other than that, I followed the recipe with the cheese, eggs, etc.  It came out so good.  I did have to bake for about 15 minutes for the dish to attain a firm enough texture to cut.

I used real maple syrup & I used a colby/monterey jack cheese blend. I also added just a bit of maple syrup to the bacon when it was almost done frying to infues it w/ the flavor. It looked kind of dry after baking, so I poked holes in it w/ a fork (before I topped it w/ cheese & bacon) & drizzled more syrup over it. Then topped w/ the bacon & cheese & finished baking. I doubled the recipe & made it in 2 pie tins but next time, I will bake it in three pie plates so that the "pancake" part of it is thinner. I'll also mix half the bacon up into the pancake batter before cooking. Served this Christmas morning w/ apple slices & cups of eggnog. Thansk  for the recipe Julie!

I had to make so many modifications that I'm not sure if I should be reviewing this at all. Used Aunt Jemima pancake mix instead of Bisquick, 1 c. milk instead of 1/2 c. milk, no sugar. Crumbled bacon into the batter along with 3/4 c. cheese. Had to bake about 20 min, added more bacon crumbled on top during the last few minutes. The extra milk was necessary and adding sugar would have made it too sweet. I'd rather add a bit more maple syrup drizzled on at the end, or serve it with maple syrup. Next time I will crumble all of the bacon into the batter. With these modifications, it was really good and everyone enjoyed it. Thanks for the inspiration!

My 15 year old son prepared this entirely himself - for dinner! It was delicious, we served it with a salad. it would be a great item to bring for a brunch. Semi-sweet, moist, and great bacon. He had no problem preparing, and really enjoyed the results himself.

My family and I really enjoyed this recipe. As another reviewer suggested we had this for dinner. My cooking time was also longer. I baked it at 350 for 20 minutes and it still could've gone another 2 or 3 minutes before I added the bacon and cheese. I also agree it could use a little more maple syrup. All in all, good recipe and easy to make.
