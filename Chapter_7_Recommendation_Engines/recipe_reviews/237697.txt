I made the dough in my bread machine on the dough cycle. I halved the recipe because I find 3 cups of flour is perfect in my machine and I only needed 1 bread.
I used all milk, increased the yeast to 1 tbsp and added 1 tbsp vital gluten flour, for the eggs I used 1 whole egg and 2 yolks.
Do not omit the nutmeg, it is really understated, I would double next time as the bread has a very delicate flavour.
For the topping I used 1/8 cup each flour and sugar, 1 tbsp butter and 1 tsp vanilla powder.
Mine baked in 45 minutes exactly, I used 300 degrees as my oven is a convestion oven, I covered with foil halfway through to prevent overbrowning, I baked mine in a bundt pan as well.
Nice Easter bread when you don't want something too sweet with your coffee.
I made this for Allrecipes Allstars Canada April Challenge #ARFaceless
