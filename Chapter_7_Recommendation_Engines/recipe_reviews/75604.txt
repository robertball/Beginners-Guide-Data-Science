Good and really easy to make, but mine came out a little too salty.  I will probably use a little less boullion next time.

We enjoyed this very much.  I substituted low sodium chicken broth for the water and chicken boullion.  The small amount of butter really adds to the flavor, as does the sweetness of the cranberries.  We will definitely make this again.

Super easy, tasty side dish.  The second time I made this I used pineapple and ham.  Great alternative to rice or potatos.

This recipe is wonderful. I used home made chicken stock, onions, a little garlic and parsley to balance the flavors.  Bulgur is a high fiber, protein grain.  Use it to replace rice or potatoes.

It was so easy to make and so yummy.  I added diced grilled chicken right into the leftover bulgur and had a terrific lunch the next day.

This was good and quick. I reduced the boullion to 1 tsp.  You don't really need to cook the bulgur, you can turn off the heat and let it sit for fifteen minutes, then fluff with a fork. Could easily be used as a breakfast if you take out the bouillion and add a little cinnamon.  But I made it for lunch so I added some green onions and chopped almonds. In the end, I wish I didn't add the almonds. It added to much crunch and messed with the texture.

We thought this was a great recipe.  Like many other reviewers, I used chicken broth.  Next time I think I'll try added some onion and maybe parsley or cilantro. Still, its great the way it is. ETA: I added onion and parsley with my second go around. It was awesome. My husband loved it!

Very good recipe.  This can be one of those dishes that is different everytime you make it, depending on what's in the fridge.  Next time I'll try pine nuts and basil.  It seemed alot like a short grain rice or a couscous.  Very versatile.

This was pretty good, but we found the cranberries (and dried cherries which we added as well) to sink to the bottom of the pan. They didn't seem to want to stay together. This tastes pretty homey, and maybe best suited as a stuffing for chicken or something else.

DO NOT USE  the amount of chicken boullion in this. Use about half, this was super salty the first time I made it. The second time, I used boxed chicken broth in place of the water and then seasoned it at the end  so I could control the salt. The bulgar and cranberry combo is awesome - this is a great side for a weeknight meal - a real change-up from white rice or bland pasta as a side. The texture is hearty and filling. Buy a large bag and store it - great survival food as well.

Made this up as a breakfast meal.  Did not use chicken bouillon, instead used a mix of water and apple juice - half water & half juice.  Stirred in the cranberries at the end.  Very tasty and simple.

This was tasty but pretty basic. I used half of a bouillon cube to avoid over salting. I also added some two tablespoons of flax seeds when I mixed in cranberries, added a little crunch and some health benefits;) 

Some things I'd try next time - 1. Chopping the cranberries up a little, 2. Trying this with bacon or mushrooms (although I'd cook those things first and then add bulgur and water), 3. Adding some spices, I could see butternut squash chopped up with cranberries and some cinnamon; or oregano with mushrooms.

I took the advise of other reviewers and cut the amount of chicken bouillon granules down to 1 teaspoon and I'm glad I did.  One and a half tablespoons would have been way too salty.  I also added some chopped green onions along with the dried cranberries.  My husband didn't care much for this because he's not big on whole grains, but I thought it was quite good.  I'd like to play with adding some other flavors.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was wonderful! I used 1 tsp 'better than bullion' instead of the granules. I added caramelized onion along with the cranberries. I accidentally left out the butter (but had caramelized the onions in olive oil, so that brought in a bit of heart healthy fat).

I followed the recommendations of some users before me and used only 1 tsp bouillon granules and substituted margarine for the butter.  I also added pine nuts, dried apricots, green onions and golden raisins and it was fabulous.  A much more exciting alternative to rice.

This is a really useful recipe.  Sometimes I substitute the cranberries for other dried fruit like apricots and it works well.  The best it's ever been was when I cooked it in homemade stock of the carcass of a roasted duck.  Thanks so much!

Ive been wanting to incorporate more whole grains into my husbands and my diet and this was absolutely perfect! It's extremely quick cooking and you can use anything you have on hand. But the cranberries were delicious. I also added green onions and chopped almonds. I substituted chicken broth for the water and boullion and added a tad of salt. Its fantastic.

I didn't have chicken bullion granules so I substituted with a tsp of Kosher salt.  I also used salted butter.  I used more then 1/4 cup of cranberries and it still worked out great!

I used half of the bouillon powder and it was still way too salty. I'd suggest using 1.5 TSP instead of tablespoons.  I also added a little sauteed onion and a clove of garlic.

I am trying to eat "clean" and so am trying to introduce new grains into my diet. This was my very first attempt with bulgur. This gets 5 stars from me, but only after a few modifications as it is a great base for tons of conceivable additions.  I made it as stated except using broth instead of bouillon powder.  It cooked perfectly but when I tasted it, it was seriously lacking something. I had already decided to add white beans to it for protein as I was eating it for lunch, but then I added lemon juice, then another taste said I needed to add sweet to balance the sour, so I added a bit of honey. This was good, but then it was a bit clumpy, so I added a splash of EVOO. Getting there! Added salt and pepper, yummy! Finally decided it needed some crunch, so after putting a serving on my plate, I sprinkled some roasted unsalted sunflower seeds. Yum-O! This is a keeper for sure, can't wait to play with it more and see what other variations I can come up with.

My boyfriend and I make this at least once a week as a quick, easy, yet tasty side-dish to pair with any meal. Instead of the 1 cup water, I use 1 cup chicken stock which really adds a rich flavor. GREAT RECIPE!

Heed the advice from others that have said this is TOO salty! If you are using no-salt bullion, then it shouldn't be a problem, but most bullions in a jar and/or cube have a LOT of sodium. I loved the way that it smelled as it cooked, it reminded me of Thanksgiving. When it was done, I tried to counteract the saltiness by adding lemon juice and a little sugar. Completely destroyed it, so will try again later after I buy more cranberries. Good thing the ingredients are cheap! Looking forward to having the less salty version. :)

This is one of the best grain dishes I've ever had! I used organic chicken broth and unsalted butter. Absolutely scrumptious!

Way too much boullion; need to reduce it a lot.  Probably a teaspoon per cup of water would suffice.  Nice with cranberries.

I used chicken broth instead of water n bouillon. Also added bacon along with sautéed onions, parsley, cilantro or whatever other seasoning I had on hand. I didn't add butter either.

Instead of chicken broth, I stirred in 4 oz of unsweetened apple sauce with the low sugar cranberries.

Taste like  a dessert!

This was pretty good. Though I boiled the chicken stock then added the bulgar. This would be even better with some chopped, fresh mint I think, but I didn't have any on hand. Next time I'll add that, too!

Great basic recipe. Didn't have chicken bouillons so used half of a beef stock cube. Also added a pinch of whole cumin seeds and it complemented the flavours. Had it with beef stew, delicious. Might try adding cilantro the next time i attempt it.

Very good! Love the nutty texture.  I substituted chicken stock for the water/bouillon combo. The 1-1/2 T of granules has got to be a misprint!  That would be far too salty...  It went well with the middle eastern lamb stew I cooked.

I tripled the amounts because I used Knorr's homestyle Stock, chicken.  Came out pretty good, not salty and as mentioned very easy to make.

This was great. I just used better than bouillon, no butter to cut down on fat. Still great. I've only ever eaten bulgur mixed in with chili, not by itself. I will definitely make this again as a whole grain healthy side dish!

Great recipe, I used soup mix instead of the boullion chives and skipped out the cranberries, added parsley and minced onion.  Everyone loved it!

I took the other recommendations advice and used less of the chicken bouillon (only 1 tsp per cup of water). I also cut out the butter since I didn't feel it was necessary. The flavors of the bulgur seasoned with the chicken stock mixed with the sweetness of the dried cranberries was a delicious combination. I would definitely make this again!

I had a bag of bulgar in the pantry so looked for a recipe that I could use to get rid of it!  Well, this little gem is a keeper.  Instead of bouillon, I just used a cup of chicken broth for the liquid.  Now I may have to get another bag of bulgar!

I am vegetarian so I replace the chicken bullion cubes with vegetable bullion cubes. I also put less 1 cube because it was too salty. but overall its pretty good. I eat it for breakfast.

This was good!   Like others, I used chicken broth rather than bullion.  I used 1/2 broth and 1/2 water.  I did not have cranberries so I used raisins and added pine nuts.  Additionally, I browned some shallot in the butter, before adding and boiling the broth-water. This was my first time using the cracked wheat and it was a big sucess at dinner! I will try it again with various other add-ins.   Thanks for the simple and good recipe!

I used homemade chicken stock instead of bullion to cut down on the salt and added onions. I was very pleased with this as a side dish. I also threw some pecans in at the last minute which was a wonderful addition.

I was hoping I would like this.  It sounded promising and gave me a new idea for the Bulgar in the pantry.  I did not like it at all, even after more than doubling the cranberries.  My husband thought it was okay luckily and ate all the leftovers.
