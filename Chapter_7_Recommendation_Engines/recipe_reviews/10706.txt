I didn't have orange or almond, but I used this recipe as a base.  I added cranberries and vanilla instead.  The biscotti was great.

Read the comments of others and have these suggestions...  Decrease the flour to 2-1/2 to 3 cups (depending on the humidity since the flour will absorb moisture). The orange peel isn't optional if you want that flavor and to heighten the almond add 1/2 teaspoon almond extract. These turned out delicate when firts out of the oven but with the second baking they became a very nice biscotti.

This recipe is too dry.  It has very little flavor and is very heavy.  I will not use this recipe again.

I love this recipe!  The flavor ad texture are wonderful.  However, I cut the flour down to 2 3/4 cups.  I also have great results using orange extract instead of zest.  It's easy to make and the results are consistent!   We love to dip/coat our's on one end with chocolate.

This recipe calls for butter? The biscotti tastes to thick. Can this recipe survive without the butter? Biscotti should be light and crispy, not heavy and buttery. Not bad.. but definately not great.

I made biscotti with a similar recipe, except I used 2 cups of flour, cut salt to 1/4 tsp., 4 tbsp of butter and used added 2 tbsp. orange zest PLUS minced orange meat (not optional).  I also added Grand Marnier and Almond Extract for a more adult flavor.

This will guarantee a slightly more moist and fluffier consistency.  It really is a good recipe, the amounts of the ingredients are just off.

I was a bit disapointed.  The dough was so dry, when mixing, I had to add a third egg. (All my other biscotti recipes with the same amount of dry ingreds call for 3 eggs)  By then, it was a little late for the extra egg and my biscotti were quite heavy textured.  The orange was a nice flovour, though.

This was made for a cub scout meeting. Cranberries were substituted for the almonds and it was wonderful. My 2 year old loved it!

Dough was too dry.  I added an extra egg and a teaspoon of milk.  Turned out heavy and dense but had a good flavor.  Will try something else next time.

Not happy with outcome. Too much flour for recipe. Recommend 2 cups of flour instead of 3 1/2 cups. Very disappointed.

So good!!  I love these biscottis!
I did reduce flour to 2 1/2 c.
I added 1/4 c dried cranberries, 1 T fresh squeezed orange juice and 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  I also like to drizzle a little melted white chocolate over the top of each biscotti.

Perfect basic recipe that you can add ANY fruit/nut combinations to.  I also love to drizzle in dark chocolate, then white over top, just for a little extra decadence!

I bake quite often and recognized the flour was excessive for the amount of liquid in this recipe.  I used about a cup less flour.  If you do this, I think you’ll like this recipe very much.  Be sure to add the orange zest for a light and fresh tasting, buttery, and crisp biscotti.  A simple icing of confectioner’s sugar and fresh orange juice drizzled over the biscotti dresses it up very nicely.

I loved this recipe! I did change the amount of flour though.
