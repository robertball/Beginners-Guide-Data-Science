This totally works. Using cauliflower instead of rice is right in so many ways. The kids will eat it because they have absolutely no clue that it's cauliflower, low glycemic count, healthy as all get out, and sooo much easier than a rice paella...and it's delicious. You still get that rice like texture thanks to the method of adding the last cup of cauliflower at the end. The tomatoes leave it moist but not soupy. We served ours with corn tortillas and ate it as tacos. I had to leave out the tilapia and subbed shrimp. I cut up the chicken into bite-sized pieces before cooking. Lastly, three cups of riced cauliflower was about one small head-including the stalk and leaves.  (It was neither a hassle nor messy). Thank you for the recipe!!

Shredding cauliflower is extremely messy and I was unhappy to begin with. But this dish is surprisingly delicious. I used honey garlic pepperoni, instead of chorizo. So good!

This recipe is amazing!  We are new to using “riced cauliflower “ due to a doctors recent recommendation based on our daughter’s blood sugar levels.  My husband, daughter and my 25 year old son LOVED this.  I found “riced cauliflower”  in the produce section at our local Publix.  A huge timesaver versus ricing it yourself!  Additionally, I would not substitute anything for the chorizo.  It adds a delicious warmth to the dish that I don’t think you would find with any other substitution.  The two things I changed were based on previous reviews.  1) Used turmeric and cumin instead of saffron because we didn’t have saffron. (Saffron is quite expensive, so they both seemed like a reasonable substitute and they added a wonderful flavor)  2) Used frozen shrimp instead of tilapia. (Tilapia is a mild and tender white fish that I didn’t think would hold up in this heavily spiced and meat filled dish).  Another fish alternative may be swordfish or snapper as they are both a little more substantial.  Everything else was the same.  The estimated prep time may be a little “shy” but this would not keep me from making it again.  I served it with a green salad and a nice red wine.  The portion suggestion is accurate and I think that depending on your level of “spice” in your food...those measurements can be adjusted.  My husband insisted we make this again.  Thanks for a GREAT recipe!

We really enjoyed this dish. We didn’t have saffron so substituted a bit of turmeric and cumin. Definite worth a repeat!

This has become a staple in our menu rotation.  I use store bought cauliflower rice.  For variety, I use a combination of 2 different seafoods with the chicken and pork, depending on my leftover situation.  It makes enough for dinner and then lunch leftovers for the next day.

I love Paella and had to stop eating rice because of Diabetes. Made this dish and it was delicious. I didn’t have saffron so I used the cumin and thyme without the saffron. I added some Sirirachs for some kick!  Also I used sea bass filets. It turned out excellent.

Wonderful!   Super easy to make and healthy besides.   Because of family preferences I subbed out the tilapia for shrimp.   Other than that I followed the recipe as written.   I already passed this recipe along to my niece who is gluten intolerant.   Thanks for a keeper.

Fabulous recipe. A bit of prep but so worth it. The five adults eating at our table last night were almost silent. Just eating!! We all loved it. Followed the recipe except for tilapia - had catfish. I was worried it would be too strong a flavor, but it was delish. Don't know that I'll use anything else!! And I will be making this often. Used my food processor with the cheese grater wheel to make "rice" super easy and quick. The addition of the cauliflower at different  times makes such a great contrast. Thanks for a great addition to our low carb plan.

My daughter and her boyfriend are picky eaters, and I needed something for Christmas brunch. This recipe was perfect. I started by cooking Italian sausage, chicken and shrimp in a large frying pan with chopped onion and garlic. I added the rest of the ingredients along with the spices into the pan, stirring long enough to heat through. Transferred everything into a slow cooker and cooked for 8 hours. The shrimp pretty much dissolved and the sausage took on a strange texture. If I were to make it again, I’d follow the instructions to see if the texture of the meat was different, but it was still a big hit with the kids.

Great idea! I just used spicy sausage and frozen tilapia. Turned out great. Smelled wonderful. Frozen cauliflower rice was the easy way to go

This was a great dish.  I used 2 of the small Mexican Chorizo sausages, sliced yellow squash for peas, and fire roasted diced tomatoes with garlic and a large can of whole tomatoes.

I used shrimp instead of fish and also used my smoked chicken sausage and smoked chicken leg quarters.  It was fantastic.
