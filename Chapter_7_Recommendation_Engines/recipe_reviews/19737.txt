This recipe didn't work at all.  The pineapple mixture was very soupy, therefore couldn't be shaped into anything. I even tried freezing it first but that didn't help at all.  I had to thorw it away. Sorry, but this just doesn't work.

What did I do wrong?  Very runny, and couldn't be shaped, even after adding more powdered sugar.

At first I thought this would be a great easy recipe. But the pinapple was runny and wouldn't freeze right. I ended up pouring the pinapple mix into the chocolate.Which didnt work as good as I thought it would be...all in all not a very good recipe. Xb
