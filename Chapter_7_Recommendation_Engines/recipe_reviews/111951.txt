Didn't use the papaya and I used a variety of peppers. This was pretty good. But only try it if you like it spicy!

I added more yellow/red/chili peppers.I added scallions and hit it with the juice of a lime.No sugar added. if you simmer the sauce long enough the sweetness of the peppers are released.

This was just OK.  Followed the recipe exactly.  Was far far far too sweet for my taste & not very spicy at all.  Was expecting - hoping for - a fiery sauce.  Very disappointing.  It was ok, but more a thick sweet and sour taste than anything else.  The smell of vinegar while it was cooking was overwhelming.

This fails as a 'hot' sauce. UNLESS you have a sensitive palate...
3 med-hot peppers to what amounts to at least 3 POUNDS of filler (onion, garlic, mango, etc) would severely reduce the heat.

But if you merely dice everything, and toss in a bowl, you've got an excellent salsa-style topping.
