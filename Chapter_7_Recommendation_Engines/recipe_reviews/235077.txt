If I had prepared this recipe strictly as written I'm fairly confident I would have had a problem with it.  A whole 8 oz. package of mushrooms to a mere  cup of green beans would be just a tad heavy on the mushrooms - unless this was a mushroom side dish and not a green bean side dish! That said, I chose to substitute fresh green beans, cooking them in simmering water for five minutes, then transferring them to an ice bath.  I used a combination of butter and bacon grease to saut√© my desired amount of mushrooms, onions and, at the last, the garlic, and cooked bacon - then tossed in the cooked green beans and heated them through. All of the additions - the garlic, onion, bacon, mushrooms and lemon-pepper seasoning all contributed great flavor to this unordinary green bean side dish.

Mushroom & Bacon Green Beans Haiku: "Just ONE cup of beans, would never make four servings! I used a whole bag." Yea, the main ingredient "guts" of this recipe have a ratio that's a wee bit off. I wanted 4 of us to get nice helpings of green beans alongside salmon, and one cup ain't gonna cut it, folks. Oh, and why use butter to saute the garlic, onion and mushrooms, and not the bacon grease from getting the 2 TB of crumbled bacon? (Unless --shudder-- you're using a jar of bac'o-bits?) - so I did just that, sauteed in the bacon grease, continued w/ rest of recipe, but used a 12 oz. bag of frozen green beans. The taste though - WOW. I'd give 10 stars alone for a magical mix of mushroom/bacon/bean!!

I have used this recipe for years, and it is great!! Glad to see it on here. It is a easy, quick, but extremely tasty recipe. I use fresh green beans, shitake mushrooms, and shallots. Makes it a little more exotic in taste.

This is a great and easy way to fix up a simple side dish. I used French-cut canned green beans because I don't care for the texture of frozen ones. The seasoning is spot-on -- great flavor without being too much. Thanks.

YUM!!  I did do a teensy bit of mods using what I had on hand, but this recipe is dynamite.  Subs - canned french cut green beans drained and cooked the mushrooms, onion, and garlic in a tad of bacon grease before adding the beans and bacon pieces.  I have a larger family, so I doubled the green beans and eyeballed the rest.  The kids loved it and we are definitely going to add this to our regular rotation.  Thank you PrncssLee!

Decided to try this with a pork roast tonight, and it turned out so good that my fiancee ate two servings before I had finished serving myself. Will definitely be a repeat side dish. Although I should clarify that I did use canned french style beans since I did not have any frozen ones. Everything else I followed the recipe for.

Very good recipe to start with. I just used fresh green beans that I blanched before reheating them with the mushrooms, onions and garlic.
Very easy and tasted great. I will make this again, especially since it will go with so many different dishes.

I used blanched fresh string beans, canned green beans ugh only in pinch would I use them. Added a few splashes of Balsamic glaze and it really perked it up.

I was searching for a recipe to use with a 12 oz package of fresh green beans when I came across this recipe.I had all the ingredients on hand (if you count fresh beans in place of frozen). The dish turned out very well. My husband, who is not overly fond of green beans OR mushrooms, loved it. Light and flavorful, this is definitely a keeper.

I'm giving this 5 stars because the flavors are all great together and it was quick and easy!  However, like others, I increased the amount of garlic, lemon pepper and seasoned salt.  I also used more beans and decreased the amount of mushrooms.  I thought 8 oz. of mushrooms to one cup of beans would be mushroom overload.  Two of us ate every bite of these.  I'm going to remember this recipe next time I make green beans.  Thanks for a great flavor combination!

I didn't follow recipe precisely, other than the seasonings I sort of eyeballed things and put what looked like the right amount of each ingredient.  I used a whole 12oz bag of frozen cut green beans, a few slices or so of bacon, didn't measure out the onion but definitely used more than the recipe calls for (I used red onion) and I think I might have added more garlic as well (used a teaspoon or few of the jarred minced kind since that was all I had on hand) and it turned out really well.  My husband, brother in law, and mother in law all really liked it.  Already made it two or three times and will definitely make it again.

Of course like all the recipes I use, I added more amounts of goodies, more onions, garlic, beans, ect.. I used a little bit of the bacon grease to start with and then a little butter as needed. I  lightly steamed the beans before I finished cooking them with the dish, that way the other items don't get overcooked.  I also threw in 1/2 a squeezed lemon. And how can you go wrong with bacon and green beans, awesome! Also, I try to always use all fresh ingredients, much better that way!

(5/30/16)  These green beans were excellent.  I have made beans with bacon and onions before, but the umami from the mushrooms sent them right over the top.  As others stated, the ratio of beans to 'shrooms is off.  I used 1 pound of frozen whole baby green beans to 8 oz. fresh sliced mushrooms.  Everything else was as instructed by the submitter.  I'm a happy camper, and DH is smiling!  Thanks!

good recipe, but I found it lacking in taste. I added a few drops of lemon juice while cooking, and then hubby topped with fresh grated Parmesan cheese once served. Delish  with additions!

Definitely at least double the amount of green beans. I stuck to the recipe as written otherwise & we really enjoyed the change from plain ol' green beans. Very nice presentation too.

Instead of a cup of frozen green beans I used to cans of green beans. I omitted the lemon pepper and used kosher salt to taste. These are the best green beans I've made yet. Will definitely use this recipe again!

I made a few slight changes. I used shallots instead of onions. I used fresh haricots verts and skipped the lemon pepper seasoning. It was a big hit as a side dish at Thanksgiving.
