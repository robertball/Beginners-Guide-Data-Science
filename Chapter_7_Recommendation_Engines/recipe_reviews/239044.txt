This was wonderful!! However, I do recommend getting the spinach ready (thawing, draining, etc.), cooking/trimming the corn, and cutting / saut√©ing the zucchini BEFORE cooking the noodles. Otherwise, the noodles get sticky and difficult to separate. (I used whole wheat noodles.) 

I also used much more ricotta than called for. 

Will make this again and again! Even my incredibly picky elder parents gobbled up every bite and wanted the recipe ;-)
