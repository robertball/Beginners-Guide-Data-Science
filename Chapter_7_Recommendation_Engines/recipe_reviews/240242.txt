This was DELICIOUS, and incredibly easy to throw together. I served it over white rice.  The spice seemed way too light for our tastes, so what I did is after I dredged the chicken and added it to the pan, I sprinkled more creole seasoning on it, and more when I turned the chicken, and it came out perfect for the spice-lovers in my house. Other than that don't change a thing!

I made this recipe for dinner tonight and it was amazing. My entire family loved it and my husband asked me to please add it to one of the dishes that I cook on a regular basis. The layers of flavors was awesome and added so much to the dish. I'll definitely be making this again and again!

I made it exactly as described and was very pleased. It was EASY to make with everyday ingredients that most people already have. I did buy some capers.  This is a great recipe.  It was very delicious and everyone loved it.  My wife said it was a 10!

Easy! I used Butchers Seasoning by Amazing Tastes for the chicken and pan fried it in olive oil with fresh chopped garlic spread on top; lots of both. I half carmelized a yellow onion and fried the diced tomato together before adding on top of the chicken. Simmered all together for 10 -15 mins. The pre saute with onions and diced tomatoes and more garlic really softened the tomato tang and produced and awesom dinner.

I did not have some of the ingredients so I used what I had - I had Cajun seasoning, which is not as complex as creole, and used 3 small, home grown jalapeno peppers with chopped tomatoes rather than Rotelle.  I also used sweet pickle relish instead of diced sweet pickles.  It was good, but not 5 stars - It lacked complexity of flavor, so I am going to add some traditional creole herbs and spices to my leftovers.

I needed a quick recipe so the only modification I made was I used a whole cut up chicken and put all of the ingredients (except the flour) in the pressure cooker. I always add more spice than it calls for and I thickened the juice at the end. Also since I needed at least a cup of liquid (for the pressure cooker) I added some chicken stock. It was an easy recipe to just dump and go!

I didn't have capers so I didn't use it. Also no garlic cloves so I used 1 teaspoon of minced garlic instead and also substituted the sweet pickles with sweet pickle relish. It was good and I will definitely make it again. I added it to my favorites list.

I thought this sounded really weird so I wanted to try it.  I didn't have sweet pickles so I used relish.  I used Emeril's Cajun seasoning bc that is what I had.  It was delicious.  We were all surprised but in a good way.

A big hit for dinner tonight.  I used sweet relish instead of sweet pickles. Otherwise followed the recipe.  A wonderful mixture of flavors.  Be careful with the Cajun seasoning.  A little goes a long way.

Tangy, salty, spicy goodness!  I love all things pickled, and all those vinegary ingredients here work really well with the chicken. I considered docking a star because I did have quite a bit of flour left over (I hate when recipe amounts waste breading ingredients) and the amount of seasoning in the flour is woefully inadequate. Also not a fan of sweet pickles, so used regular ol' kosher dill and ext time I'll increase the pickle amount. I also added half an onion that I sauteed. I really enjoyed this dish.

Excellent and quick meal. I followed the exact recipe and we loved it. I might try the mild Rotel next time as the dish was borderline too spicy for my wife.

Good recipe and very easy to cook. I didn't love the breading. I prefer a crunchier breading, so next time I'm going to use breadcrumbs with more seasoning. Otherwise, it was delicious!

I didn't have capers, I used sweet pickle relish instead of dicing sweet pickes, and I added some salt. Quick & easy dinner! Super easy and everyone liked the 'sauce'.  The chicken was tender but I don't think the cajun seasoning was noticeable.  Really good though and we'll make again.

Very tasty! I didn't have any capers and substituted rice wine vinegar for red wine vinegar. Nevertheless, it's still an easy, tasty dish that I will definitely make again!

Delicious and nice and spicy. I made a mistake and put 1 Tbls chili powder  in before I realized it wasn’t paprika.  So I just continued with 2 Tbls paprika.  The recipe for the creole seasoning came from this sight. I love it and it makes a bunch!

I like chicken from my childhood whenever chicken is prepared at home, I used to wait for my mother's call. PunamPaul.com have your lunch or dinner and I was the first to reach the table.

Being a teen my mother used to tell me the nutrition advantage of veggies, but I start telling to her that skinless chicken provides the least amount of calories and fat, about 143 calories, 3g total fat and 1g saturated fat for half of a large boneless, skinless breast, or a 95g serving.
Mom knows I love chicken too much thus she used to start her food with a smile and we all enjoy our diet together.
My mom is a great chef and use to cook many recipes of chicken the recipe shared by you seems delicious and will surely try at home.

This turned out great!  I used more chicken than the recipe states so I added an extra can of Rotel tomatoes.  They do have one now with habanero peppers which makes the receipe very spicy!  Will definitely be making this again.

Of all things, I didn’t have flour so I used pancake mix. It still turned out very good and I’ll definitely make it again but with flour. My husband loved it.

I made a low carb version of this recipe.  I used no sugar added sweet pickles,  minced the garlic.  For the breading I used carbalose flour and increased the creole seasoning slightly.  Instead of chicken tenders, I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts cut into strips lengthwise and flattened slightly.  I also had to use more olive oil.  My husband really liked this dish.  His was served over a brown rice mixture.

I made it exactly as the recipe called for, I wasn’t sure about the sweet pickles but was very good.   Would be good over fish also.

I made this recipe  and it was delicious.  Made a few changes, I substituted kosher dill pickles rather than sweet.  I added some pickled chopped jalapeno peppers since I used plain diced tomatoes.  I made my own creole seasoning since I needed to control the amount of salt. Will definitely make it again.

Fantastic. We didn't have plain white rice so we used Arborio. This will be a crowd pleaser and is easy enough to make for a very large gathering. When my parish holds its annual seniors appreciation dinner in October this will be served..

This is one the very best recipes I have ever made from this site. I have made way too many to count,that being said I have only written reviews on a handful. I made this according to the recipe other than adding extra capers because i love capers. To say I LOVED this recipe is an understatment. I will make this again and again!!!

I made this tonight and made only two changes: I used the Rotel Hot instead of Rotel Original and I sprinkled a little more seasoning on the chicken when I was browning it. Outstanding! My husband said this is one of his new favorites. Thanks for such a delicious, fast and easy recipe!

I made no changes, and the dish was a big hit.  I would add, next time, bell peppers and onions.  Frying up the chicken first, with the Cajun seasonings was a great idea.  I also served it over rice and it will go on my "make again" list.  Also, the whole thing took about an hour to cook everything.  If you are balking at  having to add vinegar, don't!  It makes the dish.

Followed the recipe as it was written, only left out the cappers because I didn't have any.  I will add them next time though. It was quick, easy and delicious. My husband and I both loved it. This will be one of my regular chicken dishes from now on. Thank you so much for sharing.

Followed the recipe and added extra (creole seasoning), just a few shakes. Added extra capers.  Served it over riced cauliflower.  It was light and tasty.  Used chicken breast sliced into strips.  Will do it again, frequently.

I've made about 50 recipes from this site. All good to excellent. This recipe is outstanding! My husband and I loved it. Two days after I made it, he asked me to make it again. It's quick, easy and delicious! Very low carb by itself. Great with rice. I used sweet relish instead of the pickles.

This was excellent!!  The ingredients sounded a little strange together, but I just had to try it based on all the great ratings!  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and served it with white rice.  I did sprinkle the chicken with a little extra seasoning while browning.  That sauce was to die for!

We're trying to eat more chicken so I'm constantly searching recipes to expand my repertoire.  it is quite challenging to find "different" recipes, and this one's a hit.  I followed recipe to the letter, using thighs.  Good enough for company, who don't need to know how incredibly easy it is.  Highly recommend.

Nice dish with a little kick. I didn't have the capers so I left those out, and didn't have red wine vinegar so I used balsamic.  Accidentally used twice as much pickles in relish form, lol. I will try this again with suggested ingredients.

Haven't made this yet, but with Tony's as a key ingredient, it can't NOT be good! We have Tony's in salt shakers in the kitchen and on the tables; THAT'S how much we love it! Also thanks for the hints in the reviews. I rely on them!

Pretty tasty! Even the kids ate it, and my son generally hates things with tomatoes in it. I didn't have any sweet pickles, so I used sweet pickled onions instead. :-)
