Yummy and satisfying comfort food. I remember my mom used to make something just like this when I was growing up. Followed the recipe exactly, and even though the Kluski noodles were hard to find (they were on my shopping list for almost a month before I found them at a market), they proved to be so perfect in this recipe that I was glad I hadn't substituted some other noodle. Bonus: it was even BETTER the next day!

This was really good, hubby and kids liked it. Two of the 3 kids wouldn't eat the leftovers. Hubby thought leftovers were great although that isn't always an indicator because when it comes to cooking, I think he keeps his bar low for the sake of my self esteem. I've come a long way since we started out but apparently you never really forget...I do think it's best freshly made and next time I may serve it as a side to a meat main. ;)

Never met an Eastern European cabbage and noodle dish that I didn't like. This is excellent the way it's presented, but I suggest that you reserve some of the noodle cooking water  to add instead of tap. Italians know to add pasta water in dishes that require water. The starches released from the noodles give a richer, creamier consistency to the dish than plain water.

Good recipe for cabbage and noodles.  I never had this growing up, and my first time trying it was at a church picnic.  The thickness of Kluski noodles is the key to it really tasting good, I was told by one of the church ladies that gave me directions.  Also adding a tsp. of caraway seeds was called for.  Not gourmet, but good comfort food.  And with the price of meat going up, it is a great way to stretch a meal.  Thanks

Made it exactly according to the recipe except I couldn't find Kluski noodles so I used egg noodles instead. This was very flavorful and satisfying. Note - If you use egg noodles like I did you could easily put in the whole 16 ounce package - I used 12 ounces and it seemed a bit light, noodle-wise.
