I threw the oats into my food processor and pulsed them until they were a fine consistancy. I also used "soured" milk in this recipe. These weren't as fluffy as I would have liked but the flavor of these pancakes was incredible. The kids and I absolutely loved them. I will increase the baking powder in this pancake recipe next time I make these.

Yum! So hearty, and just sweet enough with the tiny bit of brown sugar and the pecans. I agree that it doesn't look promising when you first scoop the batter into the pan - you have a tiny mountain of crunchy stuff with a puddle of runnier stuff around it. Two hints: tap down the mountain with the bottom edge of the measuring cup you're pouring from; it will give you a less crazy-looking finished pancake!  Also, the non-crunchy portion of the batter seemed to get a little thicker over time, so let it sit a few minutes before starting to cook. These are very filling, (seem) really fancy-pants, and are not a bit more trouble than plain from-scratch pancakes. Next time I'll try making them with a little cinnamon or a good-sized glug of vanilla. Enjoy! **Added later: I did try these with two capfuls of double-strength imitation vanilla for a half-batch of pancakes - SUPER YUM!

These are AMAZING.  And very filling.  I ate mine with honey and sliced strawberries.  These pancakes also freeze well, so since I'm cooking for one, I cook the whole recipe, put a piece of wax paper between each pancake and stick them in the freezer in a ziploc bag.  Toast them for a few minutes in the toaster oven and voila!  A delicious breakfast on the run. I only made a few changes: I used wheat flour, added 1tsp each of vanilla and cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg.  I used pecan chips because that's what I had, but definitely use chopped pecans if you have them for a more satisfying crunch. This recipe is very hearty so if you prefer lighter pancakes but want that oatmeal flavor, try try subbing oatmeal flour in your regular pancake recipe (Oatmeal flour can be easily made by processing oatmeal in a blender or food processor.  Like wheat flour, it has no gluten so mix 50/50 with all purpose flour.)  I didn't have a problem with soupy ingredients at all because I let the batter sit for a few minutes after mixing.  In fact, the mix was thick enough that I had to add more milk to the mix while I was cooking because it had thickened even MORE.  These could use a bit more of a punch.  As they are, without honey or syrup, they're a bit on the bland side.  I think a small mashed banana or 1/4c of peanut butter would make these utterly perfect instead of very near perfect.

Excellent! I'm not really a fan of pancakes, but I and my family loved these! The nutty crunch is just divine. I used wheat flour, only 1 cup of rolled oats and added a dash of vanilla and cinnamon. I also added fresh chopped banana to the mix (cooked banana is delicious). It makes a wonderfully healthy, very fulling and tasty breakfast. Thank you!

Delicious, with a great texture!  I used old-fashioned rolled oats, and half whole-wheat pastry flour.  I used Trader Joe's chopped pecans.  The batter looked a little wierd but they cooked up really nicely.  They are filling, but I managed to put away a couple!  Lol.  Served with ice-cold milk and fresh strawberries for dinner tonight.

My husband and I loved this recipe! I did make a few changes though.  I ground up my oatmeal which turned out great. I also used 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup regular flour.  Next time I will use 1 cup of whole wheat flour.  I also used soy milk instead of regular milk, and I replaced the butter with applesauce to make it healthier.  I added a few more nuts, I used walnuts, and it came out great.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks

Yum!  My perfect mother's day breakfast. We did add in a mashed ripe banana, 1 tsp cinnamon, and 1 tsp vanilla.  These are seriously good pancakes with cut up fruit topping or maple syrup.  Don't worry if the batter looks thin, let it rest for 5-10 minutes before cooking. Great fiber and really filling.

Very filling and oh so good. I used old fashioned oats so used another reviewers suggestion of letting the batter sit for 20 minutes. I also added a teaspoon each of vanilla and cinnamon. The kids love these and after two pancakes, I was feeling full and satisfied!

This is a great pancake. Being a diabetic, having whole grain and oats are so much a better choice. So, the only thing I changed the first time,  I used 3/4 C and a 1/4 C of whole wheat. The next time I made it, I tweeked it more to make it healthier....instead of milk, I used fat free buttermilk. Because I used the buttermilk , I added 1/4 tsp. of baking soda in the dry ingredients. I used apple sauce instead of the butter...and I used old fashion oats. Now to make sure everything was ready to use...I let it sit at least 20 minutes before using. This way the oats are softened and you can spread the batter into perfect rounds, no mound of oats in middle and thin batter around it....Thank you Fred for you recipe.

These are an excellent twist to the everyday pancake.  I substituted with buttermilk and these turned out great.  I will mix in a mashed banana the next time.

What a great recipe! It had wonderful flavor--which may have something to do with a slight modification: I only had old fashioned oats or the flavored instant oats, so I opted for Maple & Brown Sugar (used 3 packets). YUM! Very easy to throw together and the flavors were wonderful! I didn't think it was any heavier than you would expect with an oatmeal-based pancake. Only needed 2.5 pancakes and I was pleasantly full! One thing I might suggest: don't stir in the brown sugar. Instead, put the batter in the pan, then sprinkle each pancake with a little bit before flipping over to cook the second side. It is wonderful!

These weren't as fluffy as I like a pancake to be. They came out a bit thin and flat. Tasted good though.

I thought these were heavy, but tasty and will use the recipe again as a nice healthy alternative to white flour pancakes. I made the following modifications: Used wheat flour, added 1/4c additional milk as the batter was very thick. These are very filling and you will proably only need about 3 per person. They do freeze nicely.

I'm sorry to say that these pancakes were very bland, even though I added vanilla to the wet ingredients. Normally I add little to pancakes (just a light drizzling of syrup and maybe some fruit), but for these I had to practically smother the pancakes in syrup. The oatmeal was overpowering and I could barely taste the pecans. I would make these again, but the amount of oatmeal or sugar needs adjusting. NOTE: Just to clarify on some of the comments for this recipe--letting the batter sit for a while will thicken it rather quickly because the oatmeal will soak up the liquid. Don't let it sit too long, or if you do, add more milk so that the pancakes are not too dense and slab-like. Grinding some of the oatmeal might help too (that's what I did, and I had no problem with dense or weird-looking pancakes). Also, some reviews talk about using "wheat flour", but I think they mean whole wheat (wholemeal) flour? All-purpose flour is a wheat flour too, but it is a blended 'medium' flour, giving it a lower protein and gluten content than whole wheat. As such, ALL *wheat* flours (all-purpose, whole wheat, pastry flour, bread flour, etc.) contain gluten, but with different amounts.

Very good. I used whole wheat flour instead of the AP, and also added cinnamon and vanilla as suggested by others, with the addition of the cinnamon and vanilla these are 5 star pancakes.  Very filling, will make again.

I really enjoyed these - I added a tsp of vanilla for a little more flavor.  These weren't very pretty - mine kind of spread into weird, blobby shapes instead of nice round pancakes, but the flavor and texture were very good.   I also made some using walnuts and a few chocolate chips thrown in for a treat - those were a bit hit!

These pancakes remind me of the harvest nut and grain pancakes at IHOP. I use 1/2c. all-purpose flour, and 1/2c. whole wheat flour. Using a size 24 scoop yields 16 dollar-size pancakes. Yum!

Bland, and bizarre texture. I had to keep adding more and more milk, because the oatmeal absorbed it all. I should've expected that to happen, but it still came as kind of a surprise! Nothing to be done for it but to keep adding milk--it's the nature of oatmeal to suck up liquids. As to the blandness, add vanilla and cinnamon (or whatever. Almond and nutmeg. Orange and allspice. Go crazy!) or something, because that's what's keeping these from being the super delicious healthy pancakes you're hoping they'll be when you pick this recipe.

Wow-definite keeper, and a great way to use all of that oatmeal I always have on hand!  You can omit the nuts, it's just as good without.  It's a heavy batter so it makes plenty-I refridgerated the lefover batter for the next day, added some milk to soften it up and it was as good/better than new!

These are hands down my new favorite pancakes.  I didn't have any pecans or walnuts, so I made them without, but they are still great.  I also added a couple tablespoons of oat bran since I had some on hand.  These are excellent.

These were good but "heavy", can't eat too many or you'll be sorry! When mixing up the batter, i didn't think they were going to turn out, but was pleasantly surprised. Easy to make, a nice change from plain pancakes. Next time i'll use a little less oatmeal and pecans, but brown sugar was perfect for just a hint of sweetness.

Delicious - I added about 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and served with honey.  Very filling.  Next time I'm going to use chopped almonds in place of the pecans.

These are good, but are VERY thick and filling. It surprised me because the batter was very runny after we mixed the ingredients together. We loved them though...they have delicious flavor!

I was really excited about these.  When my husband was in Iraq last year we had pancake night once a week.  We got very creative with our pancakes so I was excited to try these.  They were good, but very heavy.  I prefer a lighter pancake.

So yummy! Sort of like eating soft, airy oatmeal cookies with maple syrup. I used old fashioned oats, half whole wheat flour, and added some cinnamon, nutmeg and a healthy sploosh of vanilla. The cakes came out with a lovely, delicate flavor and a wonderful, chewy texture.  I would eat these at least once a week if I could. The only downside is that these didn't meet my two-year old's definition of "pancake"--I think she was expecting the fluffy, melt-in-your-mouth variety.

I've made these pancakes twice now and love them.  I did add some vanilla the second time (as someone suggested) since they were a tad bland w/o it.  I keep these in baggies in the freezer and throw a couple in the toaster to eat on the way to work.  Very filling!

These pancakes were fabulous! My husband and girls loved them. I reduced the oats to 3/4 cup and added 3/4 cup of ground flaxseed meal and was surprised at how good they were. This will be my "go to" recipe for healthier pancakes.

These pancakes were amazing!  Even my husband (who is scared of anything besides plain pancakes) loved them!  I served them with bananas and strawberries on top and felt like I was in a bed-and-breakfast.  Very easy to make, too.

i loved these pancakes! i did pecans and raisins and some cinnamon. also, i made a fruit topping by taking a 1/3 cp water and 1/3 cp sugar and adding a big helping of thawed frozen mixed berries. then to thicken it up i put in some slurry. AMAZING just spread it on. i'll be making this again.

Rated 5 stars by my picky pancake husband!  I made him 2 servings and he couldn't finish them all!  

I made a few changes.  Chopped the pecans pretty fine, and added some raisins.  Also used egg substitute, and added a dash of nutmeg and vanilla extract.

These were great!  Based on the other review saying that the pancakes were heavy, I used equal parts flour and oatmeal.  I also added cinnamon and some wheat germ (hey, you gotta try to make anything healthy!)
My daughter (who is not a breakfast eater) ate four pancakes and requested them for tomorrow's breakfast too!

This recipe is my go to pancake &  waffle recipe. It thickens as it sits so I add more milk as needed. I always add cinnamon, and extra vanilla. We like the texture of the added nuts and the oats so there is no need to crush them in a blender unless that is what you like. Easy breezy!

I have made this recipe several times and my kids and I love it.  I normally add some vanilla and cinnamon.  I've also made it with whole wheat flour and it works well too.  These pancakes are amazing with the sauteed apples recipe on this site also.

This was not an award winning recipe at my house.  They were definately edible, but I don't think I really need to make them again.  These pancakes will definately stick with you a lot longer than a regular pancake.  They took quite a bit of syrup to make sweet.

Again, not bad, just not us.

Wanted a heartier/nuttier/stick to the ribs pancake. This was not to our liking.  For our taste way too much oatmeal. Didn't cook well...undercooked even after leaving on til very golden brown.

I made these this morning for my husband's birthday and they were a hit! I sprinkled a few extra pecan pieces in the batter and it was the perfect consistency, not runny at all but not too thick either. It made seven five inch pancakes and we had two left over. (it's us and our two and a half year old twins) 
We ate them with sliced strawberries and maple syrup. Yum! I liked that they cooked all the way through, no problem. I usually have a problem with that when I make regular pancakes. They also held up well and didn't get soggy with syrup. Next time I may try finer pieces of pecan and oat flour for a lighter, less crunchy pancake and just to experiment with texture, but these were great as is!

I omitted the pecans, simply b/c of personal preference and I must say:

I have never, ever been able to make a good pancake. This recipe is the first time I've made yummy pancakes. It was absolutely WONDERFUL. I prefer my pancakes w/very little extra...not even much syrup. I wanted a plain oatmeal pancake and I have to say that this is going to be my recipe from now on...IT'S PERFECT!

These were awesome!  Even my picky 2 year old, who turns up his nose at oatmeal, ate an entire plate sized pancake!  I didn't have any pecans, but I definately will try using those next time.  We topped ours with butter and brown sugar. YUM! I want to experiment with nuts and dried fruits, but these are fabulous just as they are! Definately a keeper, thanks!!
***update: i've made these a couple times now and each time I have leftovers that my 2 year old snacks on...fabulous recipe:)

These pancakes were delicious.  I even switched the butter for canola oil, and half of the flour for whole wheat flour.  I used a 350 degree F griddle (exact griddle temp was not specified).  I will definitely make these again!

These were delicious, however I didn't have pecans handy so I made them without.  They still came out great and my husband loved them too!  A big achievement as he's not usually a fan of anything with oatmeal.

This is a really good recipe. I used wheat flour instead of all- purpose and added dried cranberries to the batter. I then topped the pancakes with sour cream and syrup.

These are good...very filling! My fiance could hardly finish his and I could scarcely eat one whole pancake. They reminded me a little of the Harvest Grain & Nut pancakes at IHOP, actually. The reason for the four-star rating is because I thought they were a little bit heavy, but that might have been my fault. Anyway, great recipe - I'll make these again.

These were fabulous! I didn't use the pecans (didn't have any!), used whole wheat flour, applesauce for the butter & used Splenda brown sugar. I also used oat flour for the oats. So hearty, and delicious, too! Thank u for sharing.

These are nicely tasty, but I underestimated just how filling they would be.  When this recipe says hearty, there is no joking around.  Even my husband could only eat two!

Wow. What a great recipe. I've made this one three times now since I came across it. I leave the pecans out because of an allergy and they make one of the easiest and tastiet oatmeal pancakes I've ever had. They have a great texture and are fairly dense so a few will fill you up quickly. As well, because they're so dense, they work nicely with fruit and other toppings because they don't become soggy and mushy.

We love this recipe! It is a nice change of pace and you can make it as healthy as you want. All four of my kids, ages 2-11 loved these. 

Sidenote: I did add a splash of vanilla and a sprinkle of cinnamon for flavor.

Good. Changed up a bit though. Used walnuts instead of pecans cause that's what we had. Used soy milk for milk cause that's what we had. Also added a teaspoon of cinnamon cause we love cinnamon. Overall good. and filling.

These pancakes are great! I used splenda brown sugar in stead of regular brown sugar and used no sugar added blueberry oatmeal. It gave them a slightly sweet and fruity taste. My husband is diabetic so these were a real treat for him

Wonderful jumping off recipe.  I made it as written a couple of times with very good results.  I've added grated apple, cinnamon, raisins, just about anything you can think of.  This morning, being out of milk, I used orange juice and a little orang zest.  Fabulous.  TFTR

These were good but I found them very dense.  I would put only 1 cup of oatmeal in next time.  They're very filling, I was full after 2!

I thougth these pancakes were delish. My DH thought they could have used something more. I say whatever gets my guys eating better is OK with me. We may try apple bit with cinnomon or blueberries. Thanks for this great recipe.

These turned out great!  Instead of pecans I added cinnamon and chopped partially-cooked (in the microwave with a dash of water, no sugar) apple bits.  No syrups was necessary!

I served these Sunday morning to my very picky family.  My husband, who will only eat white bread mind you - LOVED them and asked me to make them again.  I had to make a second half batch that morning just so I could have some!  These have such a fantastic flavor that I didn't even use syrup, just spread some butter on it.   I made it South Beach friendly by using whole wheat flour and Splenda brown sugar.   We have a new favorite in the house for sure.   Thank you so much for posting this recipe!  :)

I'm a stay at home mom of 3 young boys and they hate oatmeal!! But with this recipe, adding oats into pancake mix is a smart and yummy idea. My boys ate up these pancakes as if it was there last meal on earth!!! Thanks a bunch!!!
