Good and easy replacement for my chicken pot pie I usually make. My husband loved it. Needs a little more sauce. The biscuit recipe was missing the milk measurement but I guessed and used a little more than 1/3 cup.

This was a hit with the whole family. I added a can of cream of chicken soup, half a can of water and salt to taste, and I also used pillsbury biscuits to save time. It was deelish!

The only thing I did different was add cheddar cheese to the biscuit dough and add a can of cream of chicken soup. This was so delicious it didn't even last the night! My kids even thought it was great. Next time I will double the biscuit recipe though.

The biscuits part of the recipe should list 1/3 cup of milk in the ingredients according to the original recipe on the Taste of Home website.  The chicken part of the recipe is tasty, but the biscuits were a little too sweet for our taste.  I would cut the sugar if I make these again.

I loved this recipe but I thought it needed to have a little more creamy consistency to the chicken and vegetables so I'd add some cream and a little flour to make it thick.  The biscuits were amazing.  Just add enough milk to make the biscuit dough sticky.

This was exactly the kind of recipe I was looking for. However, I think it needed some more seasonings and perhaps some salt or bullion or something. It was a bit on the bland side.

This is a great recipe.  I love one dish meals that roll it all in one.  All I have to do is serve a fruit based side with a glass of milk and it pretty much covers it all.  I have made this with sausage and would substitute leftover ham too.  I use whatever veggies I have on hand.  If I could rate it a 4.5 I wold just because the bottoms of the biscuits are damp from being in the meal, but it's still good and all of my boys love it.

This was very tasty, and very easy! I used a little less than 2/3 cup milk to make the biscuits, but other than that, I made it according to the recipe given.  Next time I might double the biscuit part, because my kids loved them. I know already this will be a staple in our house.

Loved this but changed it a little.  Added more milk and flour along with some chicken bullion to increase the liquid and flavor.  I also added some fresh, steamed broccoli and a small can of creamed corn.  And I used Bisquick for the biscuits because I was lazy.  LOL  But it is a good recipe and lends itself to variations.

Following others recommendations, I doubled ingredients to make more sauce. I added 2 T. of chicken bullion as my family prefers things to be on the salty side. Instead of baking in the oven, I left the sugar out of the dough and used same recipe to make dumplings, cooking in a pot for 15 minutes with a tight fitting lid. The dumplings were excellent. Everyone in the family liked it. I will make it again. Thanks for the recipe.

Follow to the 'T' with the exception of halving the thyme (too overpowering) and adding mashed potatoes to the bottom of the casserole dish before adding the rest of the ingredients.  Very very delicious, fairly easy with a quick clean-up time.  What's not to love?

Family enjoyed it. I used Pillsbury biscuits (I'm always trying to find shortcuts to cooking). Very tasty but next time I'm going to try cut up chicken thighs instead of breast.

I added cr. of chicken soup, as others suggested, and also substituted low sodium vegetable broth for some of the milk. I doubled the biscuit mix and needed a 9x13 pan.  I added garlic to the onion and think this would also be good with celery.  Also added chopped green onions to the meat mixture, and increased the pepper to half a tsp.  Good recipe!  Definitely comfort food...

Basil & thyme add great flavors to this dish.  I also added a pinch of salt to the chicken mixture.  Also, I added a can of Cream of Chicken soup to the chicken mixture.  Great meal - will definitely make again!

Love this recipe. Made a few changes: 2 cans of Veg-all (drained) instead of the frozen vegetables. Also, used a full jar of Heinz Chicken Gravy. For biscuits I also used 1/3 cup of milk.

Great! I wanted to do something stew-like for my family, and this was a good choice. I took liberties with the veggies (I used some frozen peas and broccoli, and I used diced fresh carrots) and I used a pound of chicken that I cooked on the stovetop in a little oil and then cubed. I forgot the Parmesan cheese and I omitted the parsley. It was really tasty! I added a little chicken bouillon to the sauce as it needed salt, and to save on dishes I prepared and baked it in a large oven-safe pot. Even better the next day! Thanks for sharing, Marilyn!

Good on a cold night. I added a can of cream of chicken as well as some garlic. I would add rice next time, I feed 3 teenage boys, it needed a little more substance.

This was good. I added two chicken bouillen cubes. I thought the biscuits were a tad bit too sweet for my taste. Next time I will not add the 1 tablespoon of sugar. It was good otherwise.

I thought that this recipe was great and my husband liked it too. I did add the cream of chicken soup and half a can of water as suggested by another review. It made it super creamy. I will use this one again.

The biscuit recipe is missing milk. Used about 1/4 cup. Need to add chicken broth to the chicken mix for taste and to thin. about 3 tablespoons.

This was very good after I added salt and a little more milk. and the biscuits didn't call for milk .I added just enough to make it sticky and easy enough to drop from spoon.

One of the very few recipes that will probably not get eaten in my house. Missing ingrediants, needs lots of help.

A good concept, but it's much better with a can of cream of chicken and a can of cream of mushroom soup instead of the sauce recipe given.

My family loved it! We usually have leftovers but we ate it all! I doubled the vegetables, added some chicken broth, some garlic salt and doubled the biscuit recipe. Though next time I need to add more chicken and double the sauce. This is defiantly a favorite, thanks for the awesome recipe!

We enjoyed this meal.  This is a nice alternative to Chicken Pot Pie.  I did make a few adjustments.  I added a little more Worcester sauce and also added a can of low sodium cream of chicken soup to the mixture. It made the dish creamier.  I used enough milk for the biscuits to make them stick.  The parsley in the biscuits was a nice touch.  Will make again!  Thanks!

It was okay... tasty but nothing exceptional.  My one complaint is that the recipe didn't mention the amount of milk to go in the biscuits.  I had no trouble correcting for this flaw but an inexperienced cook would really have been thrown for a loop by this glaring omission.

Although this recipe was good it was not what I pictured chicken and biscuits to be like. I would probably try another recipe before making this one again.

Great starter...I made it as written but, after tasting the sauce, found it to be quite bland so here's how I tweaked it...added 3 tbsp chopped cooked bacon, 2 cloves minced garlic, 1 tsp chicken bouillon,1 can cream of mushroon soup. I also used 1/3 c milk for the dumplings.  Next time, I will omit the sugar in the dumplings.  My family really enjoyed this, especially the smokey taste that the bacon brought!

This was a really good recipe.. although the sugar in the biscuits was a bit odd. I did follow the ingredients and found that sweet biscuits really aren't my thing.. next time I will definitely remove sugar and maybe add a bit more salt. I did follow others instructions and added salt to taste to the casserole part before putting the biscuits on top. Overall, this was fairly good, very easy and I was able to cook it all in one pot which was nice.

This was a decent recipe.  It was kind of like chicken pot pie.  The biscuits were great.  My 4 year old son couldn't get enough of the biscuits.  The vegetables tasted sweet probably because of the onions.  I liked the way I could barely taste the onion.  I'm not too crazy about vegetables, but I might make again.

The chicken part was very good but I did not like the biscuit part.  I will definitely use bisquik next time! I did have to add a bit more milk in the chicken mixture, as it will thicken a bit in the oven.
