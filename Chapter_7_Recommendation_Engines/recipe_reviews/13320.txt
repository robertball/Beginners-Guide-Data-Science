Good chili--pretty much like I make usually, but I don't use the tomato soup. In no way is it Cincy chili, however. Tasty, but nothing like Cincinnati Skyline, or even, dare I breathe the name...Gold Star. If you want Cincinnati Chili, you've gotta do Skyline. And cheese. Lots and lots of cheese. Finely shredded.

A delicious chili suitable for the beanlover and non-beanlover alike.  This recipe is perfect over noodles (macaroni was our first choice) with a little cheese and sour cream. YUMMY.  The only thing that we didn't like about this chili is the level of spiciness.  Chili should be spicy, but this chili had a bit too much cinnamin flavor and not enough ummph.  We will definitely make this chili again, but next time we'll be adding a bit more spice to it.

A good quick chili.  Next time I make it, I will not add as much cinnamon, but that is for my own taste.  Family all liked it!

Interesting recipe using tomato soup instead of tomato sauce or diced tomatoes. I felt like the  soup made the chili way too sweet for my family's tastes.  To try to add a little more actual tomatoes,I added a can of diced tomatoes. Also, the cinnamon was way too powerful for my family- they didn't even notice the "hot" spice, just the cinnamon!  I liked it, but the family did not, so it won't be on our menu again.

This is a good recipe, however normally you do not brown Cincinnati Chili..it should boiled in the broth..this is great on top of spaghetti with chopped onions, red kidney beans and piles of cheddar cheese..some like it with oyster crackers as well ! A family favorite !! If you check your grocery there is also a pack mix for Cincinnati Style chili..thats great as well..usually around the packs for roasts, marinades..spice packs...This heats great !

I Didn't think it tasted like real Cincinnati Chili.  However, for a regular chili it is very good.

This was good but very sweet.
A little hot sauce balances it out.

Not tasting like a "Cincinnati Chili" at all! Using a "can of soup" was my first sign, yet , thought I'd give it a try. It was edible, but won't make again. Previous reviewer was correct about boiling the beef, however, I have duplicated the end result by browning the beef being careful not to caramelize it & making sure to chop it into small bits (as if it had been boiled).  Recipe lacked some key ingredients for Cincinnati taste. I found a recipe online that is nearly spot on to skyline chili that I use.

No, it's not Cincinnati chili.  I was born and raised in Cincinnati, but it is good.  It is a lot sweeter than Cincinnati chili.  I used it as a chili dog sauce and it worked real good.  I used it over spaghetti, and it was also good that way.  I just left out the kidney beans because I wanted to use it as a chili dog sauce.  I will make it again.
