I really enjoyed this dressing. It's a bit nontraditional for us, but I loved the sweetness of the dried fruit with the herbs, mushrooms, and chicken stock. I baked my dressing outside the bird. Thanks for a tasty recipe!

It was the hit of the feast. I scaled it down for the size of our guest list.  Through the years, the family has gotten smaller. Can't say enough good about it.  Magnificent.
