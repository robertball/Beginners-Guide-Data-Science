We really love po' boys and this was an excellent recipe. We followed all of the directions but I used garlic paste and horseradish sauce instead of actual horserashish or chopped garlic since that is all I had but it seemed the right consistancy and tasted awesome anyway. the shrimp was good too, it needs the creole seasoning

I'm rating this recipe on everything, but the preparation of the shrimp because I used some frozen breaded shrimp that I had in the freezer instead. This was VERY GOOD! We absolutely loved the sauce, though I couldn't for the life of me find the Ponzu Lime, so I just squeezed some fresh lime juice in there and added a dash of Kikkoman soy sauce. The combination of the breaded shrimp with the garlicky, buttery rolls and the super spiciness of the sauce made this sandwich a winner, and one I will be making again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I thought they were yummy but I didnt have the proper rolls. My kids even ate it but they were just as happy to eat the shrimp by themselves! 5 and 6 year old boys

This was excellent, and one of the few recipes I really think is 5 star AS IS. I love the idea of making the French bread into garlic bread and thought that was a great touch.  I followed the directions to a tee and wouldn't change anything except perhaps adding more creole seasoning to the flour mixture and 1-1.5 lbs of shrimp is PLENTY.  I was able to find the Ponzu sauce in the Asian section of Safeway, but for those that can't it's basically watered down soy sauce with lime and a touch of sugar (as indicated on the ingredients list and this is what it tastes like). I used one loaf of french bread, assembled the sandwich and then cut into 4 pieces.  Served with cajun fries and it was a big hit!

This is the best shrimp po boy sandwich I have ever had! Its success is mainly due to the awesome remoulade sauce. I think I could have used a little extra creole seasoning in the flour to punch up the flavor in the shrimp a little bit. I can't wait to make these again!

It was wonderful. This was the first Shrimp Po'boy I have ever made just as good as some of the resturants make it. Definately go with the French rolls, we only had a random type of sub rolls. We did not get to use the Panko Bread Crumbs (did not have any) and we just used regular lime juice since it was all we had and that worked out great. The remoulade sauce was very yummy.

This is my new favorite allrecipes recipe!!  The recipe is perfect and the only thing that I chose to adjust is to use the small popcorn shrimp instead of the jumbo kind.  FYI, I found the Kikkoman Ponzu Lime at an Asian market because it is difficult to find in your average grocery store.  My 3 year old gobbled it up.  I highly recommend this!!!

Fantastic! I used frozen fried shrimp to save time. I added green onions and extra cayenne to the remoulade. I'm adding this to my rotation.

Just made this for dinner tonight, and my husband loved it and he isn't normally a fried shrimp fan. Followed the recipe except for the Ponzu Lime, used soy and lime as suggested by others; reduced to two servings. Used homemade french rolls The remoulade sauce was outstanding.

Fantastic! I did halve the cayenne and next time I will add some salt to the Panko and/or flour mixture on the shrimp.

This was SO tasty! We used fresh-from-the-boat shrimp but instead of Creole seasoning I used Old Bay.. Next time might use a bit more for flavor, but the sauce was fantastic! I held back on the cayenne for fear of too much heat, but will use a bit more next time. Couldn't find the Ponzu Lime, but squeezed in half a lime and added a dash of soy sauce. Yum! Thanks!

Yum Yum! Like another reviewer I used already frozen breaded shrimp and like that same reviewer I couldn't find the kikkoman lime stuff so I used 1tbs of fresh lime juice and 1tbs soy sauce.  Maybe a little too much soy but the sauce was still the jam!

Yummy!  It could have used a little more cajun seasoning or more sauce for my taste. Also, 2lbs of shrimp is way too much, I bought 2lbs but only ended up cooking 1 and it was more than enough!

I must say this was a hit at my house.  I had frozen cooked jumbo shrimp on hand so I marinated the shrimp in the 2 tablespoons of creole seasoning once they thawed enough to take the tails off (instead of adding it to the flour).  This allowed the flavor to infuse the shrimp.  I left them in the fridge in a single layer in a gallon zip top storage bag till dinnertime.  Due to allergies, I substituted soy milk for the eggs and I double battered some of the shrimp in flour a second time instead of the panko.  The sauce was outstanding!  Thank you.  This one's a keeper!

Fantastic! Shrimp was so crispy, flavorful, moist and tender. The Remoulade sauce was amazing and I will be using the sauce recipe for other foods! My family is on a mission to make at least 2-4 new recipes a month instead of eating out and I am glad my husband picked this one!

A bit time consuming but worth it. My hubby loves Shrimp Po'Boys from Popeyes and he thought these were just as good. I also couldn't find the ponzu lime but it was still great. I used a splash of lime juice and soy sauce and hoagie rolls instead of the french bread. I had a hard time keeping the breading on the shrimp but next time I think I'll use a skillet instead of a pan. Great recipe!!!

My husband had his first shrimp po' boy at Cafe Zydeco (Bowzman, MT) and has been beggin me to make them here at home. Finally did and this (according to him) even gave his favorite a run for their money. Not an easy dish to make (so many moving parts) and definite a kitchen mess afterwards, but taste was everything!

This was friggen great!  I had a vegetarian friend over and did half and half shrimp and tofu and it was great!  I used firm tofu and let it dry a bit on paper towels.  The remoulade was delicious.  I couldn't find any creole season by allrecipes had a solution!

Top marks for sure!

While the sauce is good, it's nothing spectacular.  I used about 2 tbsp of lime and 1 tbsp of soy sauce.  It did not seem to have too much soy sauce in it, but it's possible that the Ponzu sauce would have worked better.  The shrimp was bland, although I love Panko crusted anything.  Overall, it was just okay.  With the good reviews, I was hoping for more.

This was great.  Thank you!  I would double the remoulade sauce and 2 pounds of shrimp seemed to be more than enough.  Some for snacking some for the po boys.

This was pretty darned good, I couldn't find kikoman ponzu lime so i just mixed soy sauce and some lime juice. The remoulade sauce makes a great dip for popcorn chicken I had left over the next day. I'll keep looking for that ponzu sauce and next time make it right.

Very fun dinner!  I actually bought a large french loaf and just sliced it into sub-size pieces.  I did not use the k-lime sauce (because I really don't like soy sauce) and just squeezed a fresh lime.  And yes, for time's sake, I also used frozen breaded shrimp.  Still a great recipe!  Never have had a po'boy, and neither had my husband.  Again, very fun, out-of-the-box dinner last night!

This recipe rocked!!!  I followed the recipe exactly (however, I didn't use the exact brand of ingredients) and it was so delicious.  The sauce was just spicy and tangy enough and paired well with the golden fried shrimp.  This recipe is a keeper and will be making this again.

Made this with the on sale shrimp we got. Used House of Autry seafood breading just added creole seasoning. Didnt have horseradish or the lime soy sauce. Did have horseradish mustard and regular soy and lemon juice. turned out wonderful! Husband said this was some of the best shrimp hed ever had and it would be great by itself. Will be adding this to the rotation.

Made this last night.  3 teenage boys, and all loved it.  My husband asked if there would be leftovers for lunch.  I'd say it was a hit.  I thinned the sauce with a little more ponzu, used Zatarans in with the Panko, and mixed 1/2 cornmeal 1/2 flour for the base dredge on the shrimp.  With the king cake for dessert, I'd say it made a great Fat Tuesday dinner!

Delicious!! I made it almost exactly as the recipe stated but for 4 servings I only needed 1 pound of shrimp. Also I would definitely recommend using fresh garlic (1 clove for sauce and 1 clove for buttered rolls). I also used 1 juiced lime and 1 teaspoon soy in place of the Kikkomqn Lime Ponzu because I have no idea wtf that is. I thought it was delicious and so did my kids (ages 13, 11 and 7). Spicy in a short-lived, manageable way. Will definitely make again.

Made everything as written except shrimp. I used frozen breaded shrimp. I did sprinkle the Cajun seasoning on them when they came out of the fryer. The sauce and bread really make this recipe the family raved over it. My daughter even took a leftover sandwich for lunch, ate it cold, and was still raving over it when she came home. Another plus for me was the simplicity of the dish and the quick cook time makes it ideal for a weekday meal.

And to top it off I grilled two Rib Eye Steaks with the same Herb Butter sliced to make a Surf and Turf Po Boy Sandwich ............ OMG!

The shrimp themselves  were excellent.  The remoulade sauce was also excellent.  I couldn't find the Ponzu lime at a store but made some myself.  The only problem was that I couldn't find a good bun for the Po Boy.  I used french bread sliced in half, but the lettuce and shrimp fell off too easily.  The recipe makes a ton of shrimp.  More than will fit on four buns, but the shrimp were great.  Next time I will just make the shrimp and sauce.

Giving this a 5 star rating for the the sauce alone. The buttery toasted bread was a nice touch and the only thing I did different was add some fresh sliced dill pickle. Next time, I'll omit the Panko bread crumbs because it put too thick of a texture on the shrimp. Egg wash and flower is really all you need to fry up shrimp IMO. And the creole seasoning in the flour is a must. I added a tad more cayenne to the sauce because I prefer more kick. Fabulous recipe.

Like everyone else said, flawless recipe...I did add an extra Tbl. of Creole seasoning.   Sauce was delicious! But....for an added treat, I used Gulf Shrimp. If you can get your hands on or have never tried Gulf Shrimp, you're in for a treat.

WOW!  I was searching for  something different for dinner tonight, and remembered we had seen a show the day before on shrimp po' boys.  We'd never had them, but we were all saying we'd like to try them.  So I used this recipe, and even though we finished eating an hour ago, everyone is still raving about them!  You can bet this will be made again and again.  The only change I might make is to add a little less cayenne pepper.  But that's just me - I'm not too big on spicy food.  Everyone else said it was perfect!

Wow, that is a messy sandwich to eat. Since many of the reviews said the shrimp needed more flavor, I seasoned the shrimp with the creole seasoning before dredging in the flour. They had plenty of flavor. My husband wrapped the shrimp, lettuce, and drizzled sauce burrito style in a flour tortilla.This is a much easier way to eat this. The sauce would be good for fish tacos too.

This is the first time I’ve felt compelled to write a review.  5 stars just the way it is.  Our new favorite way to serve it ...mix the remoulade sauce in some shredded cabbage for a spicy slaw to top the sandwich, instead of lettuce...yum!  Thank you for sharing.

We cut the serving size down a bit- a half pound of breaded fried shrimp with a mayo dressing and butter is quite a few calories! But it was delicious. The remoulade sauce was fabulous.  I served the po'boys with some sliced tomatoes. Definitely will make again, when I'm not dieting!

I seasoned the shrimp directly with Creole seasoning instead of mixing it in with the flour. The spice is more consistent. Fried shrimp in ghee instead of oil. I will make this again.

Delicious! Pretty much made this as-is, except that I only had Cajun seasoning, and I added a LOT of it to the flour. The remoulade and garlicky rolls were fantastic!

This is one of my kids favorites. The Ponzu sauce adds a nice touch, can be substituted for soy sauce with a little lime juice.

The recipe was good but I despise cooking because of the recipes.  There is always something that doesn't exist on earth in a recipe.  

In this case it was the Roumalade sauce.  Read the ingredients and then go to your cupboard to find them, guarantee there will be some obscure thing that you won't have.   Then comes 2 days of going to the super markets trying to find those ingredients, and I guarantee you won't find them all, I don't think anyone does.  And when you ask a clerk for help with finding the ingredients you get a look like you're from Mars.

This time I was to smart to fall for this trick.   Looked online and ordered Roumeylade sauce from Walmart for $3.

That took 98% of the trouble out of making this.

From there it was as easy as Southern living.    The recipe came out great!

I’d make this recipe again. The one thing I’ll skip next time is the eggs. I made some batch with the egg and notice they were too filling and not enough flavour. When I skipped the egg the shrimp had a lot more flavour and the sandwich was far better.

I made it gluten free and I will make it again.  I also used slaw mix instead of lettuce and mixed the remoulade with the slaw.  Our Celiac in the family loved that she could have a po boy!!!

This sauce went over really well with my husband, although I had to eliminate the horseradish since he is not a fan. I made fresh pickle relish to put in. Overall these sandwiches turned out really tasty!!!

This was so fantastic!  Made a couple changes, only because of missing ingredients... we had open faced as we didn't have enough buns for everyone, and that worked out beautifully anyway.  Also didn't have the ponzu or pickle relish, so omitted both those things BUT did add some minced dill pickle instead and that rocked! This is a keeper for sure.

There was way more shrimp than I needed or would fit on my buns. Next time I would probably make about a third of the shrimp volume.

I added another eggs because 3 wasn't enough to coat all the shrimp.

I'd recommend prepping all the shrimp before getting the oil going, it takes a while.

The flavor was good, but I'll need to figure out what to do with all this extra shrimp...

Love the sauce, love the garlic and butter on the rolls. The only thing I did differently was use breaded frozen shrimp (yes really! It was a week night and I didn't have the time nor the energy to do all the extra "stuff") It still turned out fantastic!

Fantastic! Oh my gosh! The only change that I made was adding 1/2 Franks hot sauce and 1/4 teaspoon cumin to the sauce.Then I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs with a few red pepper flakes and it was amazing! This is a must have again and again! Thanks!

These were fantastic!  My other half swears that these tasted as much like the ones as he had in New Orleans as any he's had.  And we love the sauce!  We've carried it over to may other dishs.

Prep takes a little time, and can be a little messy, but the result is worth it.  The only changes I made were to how the bread was toasted.  I softend butter and mixed in the garlic, buttered the split rolls, and toasted them on my griddle pan, instead of baking while i was frying the shrimp.

Turned out great! Didn't have pickle relish so I used fresh dill and parsley in the remoulade. And used soy with the juice of 1 lime and orange instead of ponzu. Served with baked potato wedges and everyone loved them.

Never had a Po' Boy sandwich before in my life but I can definitely say these are delicious. I didn't make the sauce because I found a remoulade dressing at a local grocer that made me want to find out what to use it for. When I learned that it's an ingredient for Po' Boys, I was all in!  This is a keeper.

When we go to the beach my husband always wants a Shrimp Po'Boy.  I made this today and he thought it was just as good as we got at the beach.  Easy to make.  I just baked some breaded shrimp poppers I had in the freezer, seasoned them with Creole seasoning and then followed the recipe for the remoulade sauce. Delicious

This was easy and delicious!! I couldn't find the pinzu lime, but I did find the lemon one. I uses that and squeezed fresh lime on top. I also used raw shredded cabbage instead of lettuce and cut up some tomatoes to put on top. I think the sauce could've been spicier so I added some hot sauce on top. All in all it was good!

I really just used the recipe for the remoulade sauce and it was perfect for my shrimp and crabmeat salad.

I was craving fried shrimp and had some sourdough rolls left.  I came across this recipe.  Yummy.   I used frozen deveined shrimp and subbed cornmeal for the breadcrumbs.  I used what I had on had for filling the po' boy: lettuce mix, tomatoes,  and skipped the horseradish for the remoulade.  This was better than the neighborhood fried fish joint.   Dipped the po'boy in some leftover remoulade with hot sauce.

I made this for lunch for a few of my friends.  They loved it!  The only thing change I made was to put the creole seasoning directly on the shrimp before putting it in the flour.  I had never made a po boy before, but this was excellent!

Both me and my 9 year old son totally loved this recipe exactly as is. In his words - "totally epic Mom!"  My only minor suggestion would be to add a little hot sauce or cayenne either to the eggs or maybe directly to the shrimp to give them a little more flavor, but overall this is definitely 1 of our top 3 recipes from this site!!

I have been trying to make good po boys for years and have finally found the recipe! I followed the suggestions to roll the shrimp in Cajun/cayenne seasoning before the flour. Finally, shrimp with a kick! The sauce was amazing! I hate mayonnaise and my husband is really picky, but we both loved this. I used lemonaise in place of regular mayonnaise, ponzu citrus (all I could find) and a splash of lime juice with the other ingredients. The crusty French bread tied it all together. Very messy and so good!

OK, I'm not a seafood fan, but I do try to make it at least once a month for my seafood loving family.  I made this recipe for dinner the other night.  I cheated and used 2 boxes of frozen popcorn shrimp I found on sale.  I deep fried them per the instructions on the box and then sprinkled them with Cajun seasoning. For the sauce, I didn't have any Kikkoman Ponzu lime, so I used a squirt of lime  juice and some soy sauce instead.  My husband and stepson LOVED this. THEY. ABSOLUTELY. LOVED. THIS.  It was sooo easy using the frozen shrimp. I served it with a fresh fruit salad.  The absolute easiest recipe ever. I will DEFINITELY make this for them again.

Yum!! I used frozen shrimp, so I can't comment on the shrimp. Just the remoulade was great and makes the whole sandwich. I literally had a complete meal in under 15 minutes, and it was DELICIOUS!

This was really good and fairly simple. I toasted the bread for a bit too long at a low temp, so it was too hard to eat, instructions on the temp and length to toast it at would have helped, but oh well! I had untoasted buns left that I ate it on. I upped the ante with the spices too. I had my husband make his special creole spice mixture and I used it as the first thing I dredged the shrimp in, before the flour, egg, then panko. They were SO flavorful, I'm really glad I decided to do it that way instead of mixing it all together! I also pumped up the amount of horseradish in the sauce for a bit more of a kick.

ok, I tweaked it a bit. For the french rolls I buy Simply French bread from Pilsbury to make fresh at home. This recipe is fabulous. A must make recipe because it is so yummy. And I love shrimp.

This was the first po boy sandwich I've ever made and it was very good.  I omitted the relish and horseradish sauce because I didn't have any on hand.  I also used sourdough bread instead of split top rolls.  Awesomeness!
