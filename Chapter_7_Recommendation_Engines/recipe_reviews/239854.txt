Delicious and simple to make. As others did, I browned the onions and garlic with the ground chuck to save a step. Used a can of diced tomatoes; omitted the cayenne pepper because we don't like "heat; used 1/4 t of ground cinnamon instead of the 1/2 stick; added extra curry. It was excellent.

Love how spicy it is. I followed the recipe as written, except instead of potatoes I used garbanzo beans.  Had no potatoes on hand. Definitely a keeper.

We loved it. The only thing I would change about the recipe is simply to state in the instructions that the burner should NOT be on HIGH when melting the butter. New cooks may not the realize that butter can burn rather quickly if you are not paying attention.

Made it pretty much as written,  just substituted canned diced tomatoes for the actual tomatoes and garam masala for the curry powder.  Tasted great with rice - will definitely make it again!

Was so spicy that nobody could even eat it and we are fond of spicy food.  I really should have known better after looking at the ingredients and the amounts.  Nobody to blame but myself on this one.

We loved it. I did use chilli powder instead of cayenne pepper to tone done the spice. Used ghee instead of butter. Also eliminated the potatoes and added some keto friendly mixed vegetables. Served on a bed of turmeric cauliflower rice.

My husband did not stop raving about this dish and told his colleagues at work about it the next day.  That's a big win, in my estimation.  It is delicious and quite easy to make.  I made only minimal adjustments.  I used one large Vidalia onion, as opposed to two onions;  I was careful about the amount of cayenne I used (I figured I can always add more, but if I put in too much, I'll ruin the dish.  Half the amount called for was just right for us;) and I added 1  tsp. of ground cumin, because we are especially fond of that spice.  Otherwise, I made it as written. Highly recommended.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!!

Very spicy, Great flavors. Made it exact minus the cinnamon, just spaced it. I will add it next time. It is hot, If you don't like heat, maybe drop down the cayenne. But GREAT recipe.

Really, really liked this!  I made it as written except I didn't have a cinnamon stick.  I thought about using ground cinnamon, but instead added garam masala at the very end.  I also used fresh grated ginger. Delicious!
I was quite spicy, but I like that.  The family asked that I make this again, but not quite so spice next time, so I will half the cayenne.  I will use the garam masala again because I love that so much.
Thank you!

Wonderful dish.  I will make it again, but with way less salt.  Also for those who use organic spices, start will less and then adjust.  I find organic spices much more powerful.

Love this recipe.   Have not cooked with some of these spices before and found the combinations of flavors to be fantastic.  Modifications included using only one large onion and one large sweet potato.

My husband rarely gets excited about dishes with ground beef but this one he absolutely raved about and loved! The mix of spices was perfect!  One exception though, I had to use ground cinnamon because I did not have cinnamon sticks. I will definitely be making this again and I think I’ll be adding some green bell pepper and carrots.

Followed some of the other suggestions about very lean gr. beef. Perfect. Also took suggestions about not using whole amount of cayenne, perfect amount of spice. And we love spicey food. Will make again!!

I followed the recipe, but used venison & sweet potatoes instead. I also cooked some quinoa for a little side juice soaker. It turned out very tasty & i will definitely be using this spice blend again!

I made this recipe exactly as seen here and I'd give it 5/5. Very tasty, very different from my normal fare. Pretty spicy but that's what I like. I served it with rice and it was just right. I also had the leftovers on tortillas and I think I'll do that next time as well! will definitely make again, a tasty and simple recipe.

Really liked how spicy it is.   Instead of 2 tomatoes, I used a can of diced tomatoes.  Next time I'll add some green peppers, mushrooms and pineapple (just because we like all that stuff).

I was actually looking for a stuffed winter squash recipe and couldn't find anything appealing, so I used this recipe minus the potatoes to stuff acorn squash.  Turned out pretty good.

This was amazing. Adjustments we made: We added 1 sweet potato, frozen broccoli, minced onions in food processor, added juice and canned Diced tomatoes, a pinch of Cayenne pepper and a pinch of cinnamon. We skipped the black pepper and added a tsp more of curry. And added between 1/2 to 1 cup of water so it wouldn’t be dry. My husband loved it.

I have made it several times because it is excellent. Of course it is a spicy, hot dish so omit some cayenne for tender tummies. I use sweet potatoes and have added mushrooms and other veggies depending my taste and the contents of my fridge LOL...and folks, there is really never too much garlic. Enjoy!

This "South Asian-Style Ground Beef (Keema)" was delicious and a "quick and easy" meal.  I added water and simmered (not in instructions) and was generous with the potatoes owing to all the review  comments about "spiciness." My tomatoes dissolved, so it lacked color.  I threw in some chives I had in the freezer, but another time I would add spinach for color. Thank you farabi for sharing your recipe.

I only used 1/2 tsp cayenne and 2 tsp salt and it was the perfect amount of spicy. I might cut down to 1 tsp salt. I served with a dollop of sour cream and fresh chopped cilantro. Absolutely delightful comfort food!

Truly outstanding recipe.  I browned, drained, and rinsed the beef prior to combining with the other ingredients, and it turned out fantastic.  I didn't have ginger on hand, so I substituted another quarter teaspoon of cinnamon, and it was one of the best dishes I've ever had.

This really hit the spot!  My mother used to make something like this, but I never got the recipe from her.  Reminded me of being a kid on an AF base:)

I added an extra 2 teaspoons of cayenne pepper and I substituted cumin because I didn’t have turmeric and It was a winner dinner. After cooking I made rice and used my Asian ground beef to put on top of the rice. ??

For the most part, I enjoyed it as did my parents, although it was a little on the spicy side for my mom - my father and I enjoyed it. 

My mom added a little sour cream to hers and that toned it down a bit, next time I will bump up the mixture with more tomatoes and potatoes than the recipe called for. 

Thank you for your contribution though!

Easy and delicious! I followed the recipe (except I used jarred minced garlic and 1/2 t cinnamon powder for convenience) and it actually was nearly as quick to make as it said even on my own. The only thing I would change is adding closer to a teaspoon of salt rather than the 2.5 t it calls for, as it tasted a bit salty to me. I think it would also be good with other veggies such as peas and bell peppers!

A very delicious dish!  I did reduce the cayenne to 1/2 tsp to suit my tastes, still enough heat though!  Next time I would add 2 more potatoes to make more substantial dish.

Cut the salt in half! It's flexible and forgiving. You can also make it VEGETARIAN and it's still great: Add an extra Tbsp of butter at the beginning, then add meatless crumbles about 5 min before the potatoes are done and heat through. I prefer ghee over butter with these flavors. I've also successfully used canned tomatoes, and 1/2 ground turkey 1/2 meatless crumbles.

I really liked this recipe. I used canned tomatoes, and I added a couple of extra potatoes (because my family loves potatoes). It was a little spicy, but I'm not used to spicy food. Overall, it was an easy recipe, it was tasty, and it was filling. I will be making this again.

Make a point of using lean ground beef if you're going to follow the directions to the letter. Otherwise, with fattier ground beef, brown the beef with the onion and garlic, pour off the fat, and only then add the butter and spices. (And just a sprinkle of salt works for me.) And do consider making this dish with ground lamb!

Wonderful and quick recipe. I only made a few adjustments:

If you have children I suggest you half the amount of cayenne as this dish is spicy for little ones. I also added 1/2 teaspoon of garam masala and half the amount of curry. It was delicious served with brown rice. Next time I will make twice as much because my family cleaned it out and there were no seconds.

I used shredded chicken instead of ground beef.  And 1/4 of the peppers. Pretty good stuff.

The family is really enjoying this. We will make it again! I tweaked the recipe as so: 3T diced fresh ginger, I substituted a yam for the potato, I used about half of a 15 oz can of tomatoes,  and I added about a cup of frozen peas in the last 5 minutes in the pan.

This was delicious!!!  I cut the salt to 1.5 teas, and cut the cayenne to our taste. Everything else spot on. This will be in our regular rotation.

I really liked this, much more than I expected.  I did not put potatoes in it, just seemed weird.  Had it with brown rice. It was very spicy, I loved all the layers of flavors.

Due to tender palates, I didn't add the peppers and halved the curry, but the results were stunningly delicious! Definitely a keeper! Thank you!

This was not a hit at my house. In fairness we had never tried anything like this before and we found it to be very hot and spicy. I would imagine you need to have developed a certain palate to enjoy this recipe.

This was quick, easy and pretty tasty.  I used a bit less cayenne,  based on other reviews and the spice level was just right.  I served it with some leftover rolls, which worked well for sopping up some of the juices.   Next time, I may try it with lamb instead of ground beef.

Wow!  This is sooooooo delicious!  I used coconut oil instead of butter and added some brown rice.  I also reduced the amount of cayenne.  I steamed the potatoes separately so the dish would cook more quickly.  I plan to dehydrate half of this and enjoy it down the trail somewhere.  I'm looking forward to it!

Our Chinese exchange student doesn't like Mexican food so I was looking for something to do with ground beef that was different. He definitely liked this- had seconds! I liked it too! I didn't put cayenne, but did put in some red pepper flakes. I par-boiled the potatoes while I prepped the onions and tomatoes so I could be sure of the timing.
