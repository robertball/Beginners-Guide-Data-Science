Though enjoyable, as written this doesn't scream "Thai" or even "Asian" to me- it screams Frank's Red Hot.  There just isn't enough Asian flavor to compete.  I ended up adding 2 tsp soy sauce, 2 tsp lime juice, upping the Asian sweet chili sauce to 1/4 cup, and sprinkling with cilantro before serving.  Yum!  Did make with chicken legs rather than wings because I had a whole package to use up :-)

I made these without the flour in my deep fryer. They were amazing  I did change some stuff. I did 1/4 cup of honey and 2 tbsp of hot sauce. Really good. And crunchy!

Very delicious.  I added more chili paste and less hot sauce. Family loves spicy.  As suggested I added worcestershire and lime juice.

Love  these wings.  I did as one suggested and used 1/4 cup sweet chili sauce, but I also added some red pepper flakes (to taste).  I eat these quite often.  Thanks for the recipe.
