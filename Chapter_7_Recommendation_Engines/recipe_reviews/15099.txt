I was so excited to try this recipe, but dissappointed when I tasted it.  I will say that unlike others, I did not find this difficult or time consuming at all--I thought it was super easy, with two little ones underfoot no less! However, I thought it was bland and needed to be perked up. My other comment is that the recipe says it makes two pies.  I followed the recipe exactly, and there did not seem to be enough filling for two;  we ended up with two flat pies.

This dish is really something.  You will crave it.  Even months after you eat it.  I made it for Christmas morning breakfast and everyone was oohing and ahhing.  
Definatly a breakfast dish.  Prep the fist part the night before then put it in the pastry in the morning and bake.  Not too much prep time if you cook well and are organized.
I don't know what kids would think of it, but I gave it a 5 in that catagory too.

This is a great recipe that I have been looking for for over 30 years.  My mother-in-law always made it at Easter and I misplaced my recipe about three years after her death and have not been able to find a copy of it since.

Ever since we were newlyweds, my husband insists on having this pie for EVERY holiday.  You should see his eyes light up when he discovers me preparing it - and he is a very finicky, weight concious person!

It is time consuming, so I divide the tasks up.  2 days before, I cut up the cheeses and cook the sausage (I also use a combination of hot and sweet) and the eggs.  The night before, I mix all the ingredients together.  Then I just have to pour it into the pie shell and bake it for brunch!  I also leave off the top crust.  It simply isn't necessary and a look at the mixed ingredients peaks my guests' interest.  Smells so good!

This was okay.  I would make it again but with these changes:  leave out the parsley and eggs, add garlic and parmesan cheese and mushrooms.

The Pie was OK.  I knew I'd be the only one in my house to eat it before I made it because I am the only one that likes dinner pies.  I think the pie needed a little zip.  Maybe some worsteshire or some tomato, something to add a small amount of tang.

This pie was delicious!  I couldn't believe how quickly it was devoured!  I used a combination of hot and sweet sausage and also added some swiss cheese.

This was an unusual recipe for me. But I liked it. Kinda reminds me of Quiche but with pie crust on top. I would make it again. I followed the recipe exactly. It made for a great change as something different to make on Easter.

My pickiest eater loved this pie.  She even had a slice of the leftover pie for dessert the next evening.  Not sure if I'll cook again though, time consuming.

made this tonight using a homemade pie crust with very little sugar, came out great. boyfriend loved it as did I. ty! not 100% sure it will make a second pie however add some diced ham to it and it should no problem. also make sure you add salt and pepper or it will be bland and I recommend making sure you are not using low fat ricotta. I sliced up 5 slices of provolone and added a little more cheddar then required.. last of a huge block grated.
