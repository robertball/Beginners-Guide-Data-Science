This is indeed a very fine recipe for Caesar dressing.  I decided to make only half the recipe so this won't last long for us, but when I have company over the next time, I'll be making it again!  I used 1/2 teaspoon anchovy paste rather than the fillet but otherwise followed the recipe exactly (1/2 teaspoon paste=1 anchovy fillet).  I chopped up a little lettuce to stage a photo for this, thinking that I'd scrape off the dressing and save the salad for dinner.  Silly!  I ate that salad in no time flat!  I know my hubby will love this, too!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This makes a nice thick dressing. Add a little more fluid for less thick. I added about double the lemon juice, a dash of hot sauce, and extra pepper. Perfect on some romaine salad with a chopped tomato and cucumber. I would give this 5 stars, but I thought the dressing was a touch thick and it needs slight adjustments on the ratios.

I just made this with my 10-year old son who is obsessed with Caesar salad.  He just returned from a cruise where he's had it twice a day!  We haven't had it for dinner yet but the finished product we've just refrigerated is EXCELLENT!  I always believe in doing a recipe as its written but I had whipping cream instead of half-and-half and used that.  I also used low-fat mayo as that's what I had.  My other son said there were so many flavors that came out when he tasted it.  We're looking forward to dinner tonight with lasagna to go with it!  Thanks for the dressing recipe!

This is incredibly good salad dressing! My husband and I eat quite a lot of Caesar salad, so I doubled the recipe and it fits perfectly in a 1 quart mason jar! Other than the fact that I doubled the recipe, I made no changes.

If you like Caesar salad, you definitely don't want to pass this one by!!

I used 1 tsp anchovy paste instead of the fillets (1/2 tsp per filet) because that is what I had on hand  but other wise followed the recipe to the letter.  VERY GOOD and so easy.  Thanks so much.

8.16.16  I processed this in my mini chopper that came with my CuisinartÂ®  immersion blender.  I never buy anchovy filets, but I understand the importance of that flavor in a caesar salad.  I put all ingredients in my mini chopper, using 1 tsp of anchovy paste, and in no time at all I had some of the best homemade caesar salad dressing I've ever made.  Don't tell anybody how easy this is to make,  they'd never believe it!   Excellent dressing going into my Favorites file.

Great dressing and easy to make. I too used anchovy paste. Instead of using this on a more traditional Caesar Salad I used it on a pasta salad as that's my daughter's favorite. Bowtie pasta, cherry tomatoes from my garden, yellow and green zucchini, green, red and yellow peppers and black olives. Delish. I made the full recipe and it just about filled that cruet that comes with "good seasonings" salad dressing.

This is a GREAT recipe. Instead of anchovies, I used fish sauce b/c that's what I had. Instead of garlic cloves, granulated garlic (dry).  Followed the recipe in prep the same. It makes a great amount, and keeps well. It's thick enough to be used as a dip also.  It's my go to! Thanks for posting!!

Awesome! Made as directed but didn't have half and half used whole milk instead.  Will try it with half and half next time but if it gets any better my head might explode.

This is the first recipe that had good reviews on this site that was really bad for me. This is way too much mayonnaise. The dressing smells and tastes like fish flavored mayonnaise.

Wow great recipe.  Fast to pull together.  The dressing had sat in the fridge for several hours and was still smooth and I did not have to redo.  Will be making again.

This is very very good.  I only used 1 clove of garlic, 3 anchovy fillets and used skim milk in place of 1/2 and 1/2, it was so good my husband commented multiple times.  It's a keeper.  Thank you for sharing!

First time I did a review. This is great dressing! I was in such a hurry to try it, I started it before realizing I didn't have any Worcestershire sauce. I know when I add it, it will be even more amazing!

Excellent recipe!!  I love garlic, so I used one very large clove and a medium sized clove.  Like a previous reviewer, I used anchovy past (as her conversion stated 1/2 t./fillet) and I am very partial to preserved lemons in place of lemon juice, so I diced the peel very finely, discarding the fruit.  I will definitely be making this again!!

Took all ingredients and put in blender. I went just a little bit heavier on the anchovies and garlic because I love them both. I used half milk and heavy cream because I didnât have the half and half. I have made this several times already and receive tons of complements each time.

This has become a staple in our house. My husband, kids and I all love it, and I urge you not to be afraid of the anchovies; they MAKE this recipe. Use good, quality ingredients, then add your own bacon, croutons, lettuce and parmesan to make this a show-stopping salad. Great for home or a pot luck!

This dressing is truly "The Bomb"! It is the one that will be my permanent go-to Caesar Salad dressing. It is important to use fresh garlic vs garlic in a jar or powdered.  The fresh garlic gives it that zing that is so good!

This is a fantastic creamy Caesar dressing. Used extra anchovies, a little less mayonnaise and yellow mustard as I didn't have Dijon. Thank you for posting this recipe.

This is a wonderful dressing! I used my mini-processor to make this. I halved it and used anchovy paste (1/2 tsp) in place of the real thing and light cream instead of the half&half.  A friend has asked me to bring a Caesar salad to a gathering, and I usually bring a bottled dressing. This is SO much better than any of the bottled stuff and takes just minutes to put together. If I'm asked again, I'll definitely make this. You won't be disappointed if you try this! Thanks for the great recipe!

Oh boy.  I'm real picky about my Caesar dressing.  If it's too tangy, it can spoil my evening.  This dressing is perfect!  It does not bite back at all.  Thanks!

Delicious! I didn't have any anchovies on hand, so I left them out, but next time I'll make sure to buy some. Very tasty and easy to make. Will be my go-to from now on!

Yummy!! I went to the store to get Caesar salad fixings and didnât like my options for bottled dressings, so I looked up a Caesar salad dressing recipe on AR and found this one. I purchased the few items I didnât already have at home, then made it as written (I did buy the anchovies paste, instead of the filets), and let it sit for a day to let the flavors meld. I then had it with romaine, a little crumbled bacon, Caesar croutons & some fresh cracked pepper & it came out restaurant quality. Thank you for the recipe!!

Makes a very good Caesar salad dressing. Like others, used anchovy paste.

I did not use the anchovies since some of the guests don't like the taste. The dijon gives it a little kick, so I didn't miss the anchovy flavor. I would use a little less mayo next time. The dressing is very thick. I also added crumbled crisp bacon and chopped hard boiled egg to the salad. Received many compliments and will definitely make again.

I had never purchased anchovies (didn't even know where to look in the store) before finding this recipe.  Now, anchovies are on my grocery list on a regular basis because family and friends love this recipe and request it often.  Made it exactly as shown.

This is a wonderful recipe!  I followed it exactly other than I was guessing what two fillets were.  I bought a can of flat anchovies in olive oil and sea salt, the only thing available at my store.  It was a 2 oz can and I ended up using half of it which seemed to work out every well.

I have made this about 10 times in the last 2 months.  Love it!  The key is to use fresh lemons and fresh garlic (made it one time with processed garlic and lemon juice from a bottle and you can definitely tell the difference.)  I also use anchovy paste so that the anchovies don't go to waste (since we don't eat them).

I made this exactly to the recipe and it is by far the best Caesar salad dressing I have ever made! In fact, as I was tasting the deliciousness I wondered if anyone has tried this recipe tossed with pasta? It tastes like it would make a great Fettuccine Alfredo type dish. Actually, to be honest I did add an extra clove of garlic because I love garlic and 2 extra anchovies but other than that I followed it to the "t".

This is a very great Cesar recipe minus a couple of things. I really recommend adding a dash of hot sauce and 2 teaspoons of freshly ground black pepper, it really helps to add just that bit of extra kick.

This was a great recipe but I felt it was lacking something to my taste preference. A splash of white vinegar, extra garlic, black pepper and extra parm.....yum!! Without this it tasted too much like straight mayo but it was a great base since I've never made Caesar dressing before!

Ohhhhh yes!!!  My whole family loves a Caesar Salad, and this dressing is better than most we've had at restaurants.  I didn't change anything except substituting evaporated milk for the half and half cream due to tummy issues.  You can throw some grilled chicken or shrimp on top for a complete meal.  Quick, affordable, and delicious!!

Excellent well balanced dressing. I did use anchovy paste instead of fillets, 1 tsp, as that's what I had on hand and I always grate my garlic on a microplane grater to avoid pieces of garlic in the dressing. Will be making this often.

Very good! My very picky Caesar snob grandson liked it! I didn't have anchovies on hand, so substituted fish sauce as another reader suggested. I think it might have been better with anchovies, but even with the fish sauce it was exceptional. Making it again, I would only use 1 Tb fish sauce  instead of the 2 Tb that I substituted. Thanks! I appreciate having the recipe, and I will definitely get anchovy paste so I have it handy in the future!

I'm glad to have found this recipe.  Just the combination of flavors that I enjoy in a Caeser dressing.  I made it per the recipe less a substitution of milk/heavy cream at 3:1 since I didn't have any half-and-half around.
Outstanding over a bed of spinach with bacon bits and croutons.
Thanks!

Oh my gosh! I halved it and basically eyeballed the measurements and it came out fantastic! Even my husband gave it two thumbs up and that, my dears, is saying a lot! Thanks for posting the recipe.

This is my first time making homemade Cesar dressing. I followed the directions as written and did a taste test. I felt the mayo was too strong, so I added in another few dashes of Worcestershire sauce, a couple more chopped anchovies, and a wee bit more cider vinegar.  Much much better. I made up about six hours before serving and it was perfect, didn't thicken up like most homemade dressings do to the point of having to add more liquid, was perfect. It had great reviews at our dinner party, someone said it was the best they've every had.

Excellent! Very creamy, not too strong on the anchovy flavor, perfect thickness. A little too much mustard, but I think that was my doing.

This recipe is extraordinary!  The first time I made it, I used reduced-fat mayo,  fat-free half & half and bottled lemon juice.  It was still the best I'd ever tasted.  The second time, I used "full-strength" ingredients and fresh lemon juice and, quite frankly, I could not tell the difference.   And, in the interest of full disclosure, I do not measure precisely, so this recipe is, indeed, virtually fool-proof.

We are caesar salad fans and we think this is the best caesar dressing recipe ever! Our daughter ate an entire head of lettuce with this dressing. :)

I followed this recipe exactly because this recipe is the first time that I have made a salad dressing from scratch. I am in awe at how good it is. I made it the first time on Friday, it is now Sunday and I have already made it again and almost finished that batch. I will NEVER buy bottled dressing again. This recipe is definitely 5 stars. Thank You Moose's Mama

This is great!! Not being an anchovy fan, the closest thing I had in my house was fish sauce. To compensate for the salt and sugar in the fish sauce, put in about half the worchestershire sauce. Still came out amazing! Yay!! Thank you for posting this :)
