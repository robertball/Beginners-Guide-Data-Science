I scaled this down for 2 eggs and followed the recipe exactly. I thought it sounded like it would make too much filling to fit back in the eggs, but it worked perfectly. Both my Dad and I really liked the taste of these. I took a star away for two reasons though. One was due to the stringiness of the spinach. Next time I will definitely chop the spinach up very fine. The other thing was the presentation. I just didn't think they were overly "pretty". That's IMHO of course, so see my photo and judge that for yourself. Definitely enjoyed them though and glad I made them. Thanks Valali!

We had a deviled egg taste test between this recipe, 'Sriracha Deviled Eggs' and 'Simple Deviled Eggs' all from AR.  This recipe was my favorite.  I did use fresh cooked spinach rather than frozen.  I just made sure to really squeeze the water out before adding it to the yolk mixture.  Thanks Val-Flowers, for sharing your creation.

This tasted amazing!! It was more than enough mayo I actually had to take some away. I did change a bit. I added two different types of mustard, oregano, garlic powder and chopped onion. It came out soooo amazing.
