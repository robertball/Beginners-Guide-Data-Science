Sugar Sugar inhibits the growth of bacteria, keeping your jam fresh, fruity, and safe to eat. Jam recipes are formulated to call for a certain ratio of pectin to sugar, and they will not jell properly if you don't use the correct amount of sugar. If you'd like to make less-sweet jam, you'll need to buy a special kind of pectin that's formulated to work with less sugar.

I modified this.  I can not drink orange juice because of high acidity. So I used fresh squeezed oj from the tree in my back yard.  I dont use liguid pectin I only use sure jell. On concentrate you use 5 & 1/4 cups sugar on this recipe I only used 5 and turned out great...Oh and to get rid of scum or the nasty fuzz stuff on top my mother in law said if you use 1/2 teaspoon of real butter when you start cooking, the butter eliminates the scum so you dont have to skim it before putting it in jars

This was my venture into jelly making and I just want to thank you for making it really enjoyable with this recipe! The jars are cooling off as I type. I tasted the jelly before putting in the jars and it tasted fantastic! I read one of the reviews where it said that it tastes like sunshine in a jar and I'll definately second that...thanks for a super great recipe, Rachel...I'll be making more of this!!

Absolutely delicious and tangy.  Our favorite "new" jam this year.  Two batches turned out great, one batch (a week later) still hasn't jelled, but we'll use it on ice cream or pancakes if it doesn't set.  We love the sweet, tanginess of this recipe.  Thanks for sharing it.

Great flavor and color, easy to make, next time I will add just a touch more pectin since mine didn't set up quite to the consistency that I like. Otherwise it was amazing and I love it on just about anything bread-like in the morning!!!

I made this with 2 cans of frozen lemonade concentrate.  One regular and one pink.  So tart and yummy!  Will definitely make again (I want to try it with orange juice but I didn't have any in my freezer).

I made this with orange juice that has pulp in it (not concentrate) so instead of water I used more orange juice and 1/4 cup lemon juice and it's wonderful. Thank you

This recipe is good just needs a tweak in my opinion...for the cooks who had runny jelly I suggest adding some lemon juice along with the water (reduce water to compensate for lemon juice).  I have been making jelly for my cafe for about a year and get constant feed back on my product, overall when the jam is runny they are unhappy so to fix the recipes that I have gotten on line the addition of acid has helped the jam to thicken in my case. This morning I added some Moscato wine into the water ratio, anxious to see how it tastes:)

I would give it TEN stars if I could! My husband wanted the flavor of orange marmalade but without the pulp or zest. This recipe was PERFECT! Rave reviews from everyone in my household, and huge thanks from me! :)

I always cook the ingredients longer than it says.  I was in a hurry, and it did not set.  The next day, I poured the liquid from the jars, and cooked it again.  It worked fine.  It has set very firm like jelly is suppose to.  I suggest you cook your ingredients longer than the jelly recipe calls for to ensure it sets well.  Especially if you are using sure-jel pectin, boil and cook much longer than a minute.  If you like apple jelly on toast, I believe you will like this.  It taste very similar to apply jelly when on buttered toast.

I used fresh squeezed juice, and tried to get it to set twice, without any success. On a positive note, it makes a wonderful glaze for Orange Chicken which we had for dinner tonight...

This is pretty jelly. I only gave it four stars because I feel that it is a little too sweet. As others have said, it is very easy to make.I guess I was expecting it to have more of a tart taste. I may try less sugar next time or maybe add a little lemon juice. Thanks for the recipe Rachael!

I added the sugar at the wrong time so it turned out more of a nectar. (HAHA) Still tastes good though! (I might add a little less sugar and of course put it in at the right time.)

After a day of pickling I wanted a simple jelly to make and this fit the bill nicely.  I did add 1/2 C of minced maraschino cherries. I also used the syrup from the cherries to substitute some of the water. Which gave the jelly a rich red color. The jelly set nicely and tastes sweet (the cherries) with a bit of zing (the oranges).  If you are looking for a richer orange I would add the cherries minus the syrup.

Followed the recipe exactly. It took 2 days to jel.  I was all set to do them over but they finally jelled themselves.  The jelly is delicious.

I give this two jars for the taste, which was great.   However, I made two batches, and neither one of them set.    When the first one set, I thought I must have done something wrong, and tried it again, only to have the same result.    I've been making jams and jellies for years, and this is the first time I have ever had a jelly not set.   I may try it on pancakes this weekend, but other than that, it's a loss of ingredients and my time.    I made two batches of jelly with wine the same day and they turned out fine.

I made this and is was just flavored water.  I went through every recipe I could find for orange jam/jelly. This recipe is incorrect.  It's only 1  1/2 cups water.  That's why it's runny.  I found the original recipe in the Mrs Wages canning book.

O.k. Here's the skinny on this. It didn't work. I made the recipe exactly as stated and it didn't jell. Not even syrup consistency! So I went and bought fresh pectin, MCP this time, and reprocessed the whole batch. I got it to jell by cooking it down until it coated the spoon. I liked the idea of a different jelly but this wasn't worth the hassle in my opinion.

This was my first ever attempt at making any sort of jam or jelly, and I was very upset with myself cause i thought I messes it up. So myself and my husband made a second fresh batch, and the first time wasn't me. This reciepe would not firm up at all. We even tried a third batch and added some pectain to it to help it and still nothing. If anyone has any other suggestions on how to make it firm up please let me know because the flavor is exactly what I am looking for.
