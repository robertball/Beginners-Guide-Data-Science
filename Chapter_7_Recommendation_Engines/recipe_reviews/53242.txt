I must say, the recipes for this pastry is probably the best I have ever used!  It is really easy to work with, providing you use more water than what is suggested.  It doesn't crack, and the result is quite a biscuity, even textured pastry.  Perhaps in the future I might try adding a little vanilla sugar, or vanilla essence for an extra 'biscuity' taste.  The actual filling has a really nice texture too, and overall, this is a yummy tart.  When I make this next time, I might use a little less lemon rind and juice, because it was a little too lemony for me.  But I guess that comes down to personal preference.  This was a great recipe!

This recipe is a smash hit with all our guests.  It's light, delicious, and refreshing.  I recommend going the extra mile to use fresh squeezed lemon juice as the flavor is somewhat dulled with bottled lemon juice.  The crust is fantastic and it's a fabulously pretty presentation.
One other note.  The recipe says not to overmix the filling.  If you do whip or whisk it too hard bubbles form, and these often will remain during baking and detract from the prettiness of the final product.

Thanks for an excellent recipe.   Made similar many years ago when I lived in Britain.   For those who do not know what castor sugar is (or it is not available where they shop) you can put regular granulated sugar in the blender for a few mins. and that will make it finer.

I made the tart a while ago, and it was a bit too tangy for me, but it would be easy to reduce the lemon in it.  I plan to make it again.  The thing I really loved about this recipe, though, was the tart crust.  I hate traditional pie crust, so I substitute this tart crust for pie crust in nearly all my recipes now.  I also add a bit of vanilla to the tart dough.  It's great with apples for an apple pie.  One recipe of the tart crust easily does a single-crust pie and  could probably be stretched to work in a double crust pie.

There is only one bad thing about this Recipe you need to make sure you have guests over so you don't eat the whole tart yourself its purfect the pastry is just sweet enough to balance the lemon.

I took the risk and made this for a dinner party of 10, everyone was bowled over by the fantastic taste and presentation.  What a lovely way to end the evening! I too put vanilla extract in the pastry and adjusted the lemon mixture to my taste, tangy but sweet!

This is amazing. I'm not an amazing cook but it came out great. I made it for my mom on mother's day and ever since she's been asking me to make some more. One thing I did though was I diluted the lemon juice with water and used less lemon zest. But other that, simply delish! The crust especially is amazing. I make it like all the time just by itself! :D

This recipe is great! Since the dough was enough for 2 crusts, I decided to make 2 tarts, altering the recipe a bit. First of all, I didn't have & couldn't obtain a tart/flan tin so I used a 9" glass pie dish for 1 & a 9" springform for the other. The 1st tart I followed the recipe exact (minus the pan thing); The 2nd tart I reduced the lemon juice to 1/2 c. and the lemon zest to 1 tbls. The one in the pie dish w/exact recipe came out great, regardless of the cracking/bubbling of the crust. The 2nd came out even better! The springform pan made it look pro & the less lemon juice took the bite off (for my boyfriend's mom- she loved it!)Thanks for a great recipe! I'll be making it again!

I loved this recipe. It was easy to make.  The crust was very good.  I added a little vanilla like a couple people suggested.  I love lemon so I didn't reduce the lemon or lemon zest and it was a strong lemon flavor so if you don't like a strong lemon flavor I would suggest adding less zest, or watering down the lemon juice maybe?   Thank you to EILISH40 for mentioning how to make a substitute for castor sugar :) and thank you ausiemaria for the tasty refreshing recipe

I used this crust to make a fruit tart and it was sooooooo good..I'll definitely be using this crust for everything from now on.  I made the extra crust into cookies and they were probably the best shortbread cookies I've ever tasted.

DELICIOUS!!!! DEFINITELY WORTH MAKING!!!!! It is now my husband & my favorite desserts!!!
EVERYONE IN MY FAMILY DEVOURED THIS TART!!!!

YOU HAVE TO SERVE IT CHILLED- it doesn't taste as yummy if you don't.

I thought the lemon filling was tart as other people had commented. However, I thought it just made it that more refreshing on a hot "summer" night. You can adjust the lemon amounts but I LOVED it AS IS as did the rest of my family. 
BRAVO AusieMaria for sharing such a wonderful, delicious  & delightful dessert!!!!

Pastry is really to die for. I tweaked alittle after reading some of those comments on the tartness of this pie. I put in 110ml lemon juice & 40ml lime juice (about 1/2c) & added more cream (3/4c). My daughter who doesn't fancy anything too tangy ate 2 portions. Fabulous!

At first I wasn't crazy about this, but after it set for a couple of days I REALLY liked it. Other people thought that the lemon flavor was too strong, but I'm a lemon lover and I thought it was excellent. Next time I will rub the zest into the sugar. It seemed kind of useless to dump it in the mix and then just strain it out again. Also, next time I will brave cracks in the surface and cook the whole thing until it barely jiggles in the center because, as stated, I thought that it wasn't set properly.

Absolutely delish. Made this for a special even and it was a hit. My only complaint was the crust was time consuming as it needs to go in the freezer for a while but it's worth the time. I topped mine with strawberries instead of raspberries.  This recipe is a keeper.

Pastry was great...will use it for all my pie crusts from now on.  The tart itself had good flavor but wasn't 5* in my opinion...will keep looking for the perfect lemon tart recipe.

I made this for a dinner party yesterday, and it was delicious! I made the lemon tart as written, but also added a top layer of cream cheese/cool whip and then topped with some fresh strawberries & blackberries. The crust is wonderful and the lemon part had just the right amount of tartness. The only reason that I added a top layer is because my tart pan was 11", and I had adjusted the recipe for 10 servings rather than 8, and it ended up not as thick as I would have liked compared to the crust. It needed something on top to bring the thickness up to the top edge of the crust - thus the reason for my addition. My review is only based on the flavor of the lemon mixture & the crust dough, and not my addition.

I saw a lemon tart recipe in a magazine and had been thinking about making one for about 6 weeks...only I didn't like the recipe in the magazine so I began searching and found this one.  I was not dissapointed!!  I've only made one or two tarts before...the crust came together beautifully and the lemon gives you a taste of summertime sunshine in the middle of a dark dreary winter.   I actually thought it tasted better after being chilled for a few hours.

I made this last Thanksgiving to bring to our friends. I left it in the pantry with a pumpkin pecan pie, and when we returned home from our night away, our kids had demolished both.  They were lying on the floor like over-stuffed dogs. I'm about to make them again to bring along this year. I'll make two sets to leave one behind. BEST recipes!!

I've made this a couple times now and I just love it!  It is definitely a "TART" tart, so if you're not a real lemon lover, this one may not be for your.  If you are though, be prepared to enjoy!

Excellent remember it makes 2 crusts save 1/2 for another time DO NOT be afraid of the lemon after all, it is a Lemon Tart! I could have even added more!  Don't waste time looking for other recipes just make this as it says don't need to roll it out like pie dough just put the ball inside the pan and press it around all the edges it works great and yes do the foil and rice step - follow the recipe and you shouldn't have a problem.  I baked an extra 2 - 3 min. it was great and set-up nicely.  It's really good, I promise.

I love this recipe.  I used to cook my lemon filling on the stove top over a double boiler, this is so much easier.  This tart is to die for,the filling is as smooth as silk and the crust is like a butter cookie.  Thanks so much for sharing. YUM!!!

Great recipe! The sweet crust balances the tangy lemon curd well. Will definitely bake it again... delicious!

delish. Don't substitute grapefruit for the lemon though; it doesn't work. The lemon one turned out great though, and the crust was fantastic.

Very tangy! I loved it though! I made this for my friend who loves lemon flavored everything, she said it was a little too tangy, which surprised me, coming from her.  But all in all, if you're looking for a recipe with a lot of lemon flavor, this is the one, most definatly.

I made this last week for dessert after an Asian inspired meal, and it was a real hit!  I wouldn't change a thing......  No, than's not true, I would make two tarts because you will definitely want more!

Very good.  Nice and lemony.  But personal preferance, if I want a lemon dessert I think I'd rather make lemon squares.

Great tart.  Very easy recipe.  I skipped the chill time and very carefully rolled out the soft dough.  I also didn't add lemon zest.  I don't understand why you would add lemon zest and then strain it out.

This recipe is too hard to rate. I second-guessed myself during every single process due to the "do not over beat" and "do not over cook" directions. Did I over beat the lemon mixture? Was 20 minutes long enough to cook? After 20 minutes in the oven, the whole tart was runny. I didn't trust the author's judgment and left it in for another 15 minutes because my mind could not fathom that it would set. It looked like it did when I put it in the over, completely raw. After that 15 minutes, there still weren't any cracks but it was no longer runny. I'm pretty sure now after I've left in in the fridge overnight that I overcooked it! So, I'm basing my rating on the fact that there is no way to tell whether you are making this the way it was supposed to be made. The taste is fine. I actually like all the lemony flavor, but I'm not blown away and it's probably my fault.

This turned out great! I didn't make the crust and instead used a prepackaged one, but the filling was great.  It tasted like a lemon bar and I will definitely be making this again.

I followed the recipe as written. My guests loved it but it was a bit too tart for me. The crust was great. I had to add a little extra water to pull the dough together. I was able to skip refrigerating the dough but I did put it in the freezer while I prepared the filling. I had enough dough for a second tart so I will make a fresh fruit tart with the leftovers.

I cheated and used a store bought refrigerated crust. The filling was so great I didn't even notice the crust. I might try making the crust next time, there will definitely be a next time.

I  added a tablespoon of vanilla extract.  I ended up just pushing it in the tart pan. It came out GREAT! Seriously the best crust I ever had.  I only added 1 table spoon of lemon zest and cut the lemon juice (mine was from real lemons) to half a cup. I also left a pinch of zest in the filling to bake.  I made a fortunate error...I was not paying attention and forgot I had already added sugar to the filling, so I added it again. I thought I had ruined the tart, but it was fantastic, even with the extra sugar. I topped it with not sweet whipped cream and white chocolate curls. It was to die for! If the crust was easier, I would have given this recipe 5 stars.

This lemon tart was good but extra tangy. The crust is a bit tedious to make and you can tell from the other photos how some lack that nice form. The next day, for some reason it tasted even better.

I made this recipe but I found that it made 2 crusts' worth of dough, so I doubled the filling and made 2 tarts. It was delicious and super lemony, and the fresh raspberries on top were a great touch.

This is an excellent recipe.  The tart crust is superb.  The filling is tangy, just the way a lemon tart should be.  It is particularly nice with the fresh raspberry topping.

this is an incredible lemon tart.  wonderfully tart, and not too sweet.  i was too rushed to make the crust and used a pre-made one and it was still amazing.  this will be my standard lemon tart recipe!!!
