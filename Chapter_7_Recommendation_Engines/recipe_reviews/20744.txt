This recipe was quite excellent. A few changes to this, and it turned out really well. I prepared the chicken as directed with the addition of fresh cracked pepper, and added home made chicken broth to it, about a cup and a half. To the vegetables i added mushroom and onion, and stir fried them for a few minutes until they were still crispy yet hot. All the while, the angel hair was cooking, as this dish is quite fast once you get done with the chicken. Added the vegetables to the chicken/broth combo, tossed them, then simmered for about three minutes. Drained pasta, tossed with some olive oil, and then dumped the vegetable/chicken mixture on top. Added some fresh, vine ripened tomatos chopped into small pieces, and grated fresh parmesian cheese on top. Then when people served, they grated a bit more cheese (not much actually) salt, cracked pepper... and it turned out perfectly.  My mom, who enjoys my cooking, said this was the best thing I have made yet. Made a huge pot, a pound of pasta, pretty much tripled this recipe, and it was all gone by the next morning.

One more thing... to increase the flavor use ALOT more basil (fresh) than suggested here. I used nearly a cup and a half. Simmered half of it with the chicken, and the other half i sprinkled on right before serving. You dont need heavy cheese or cream sauces if you try it this way.

This was easy. I altered the amounts somewhat and added onion, garlic and a red bell pepper. I would make it again.

We all liked this very much! I added some chopped onions to the chicken saute and when cooking the broccoli, I added 1/2 red and 1/2 green bell pepper, chopped. Used 1 14.5oz can of broth, which was the perfect amt.  A nice, light tasting lunch and tastes much healthier than the cream-based pasta dishes.  Will make again!

This is the 1st time I sent in a review becuase I felt the need to let others know. This was not good at all. No one in my family liked this. It was dry. It had no flavor.

This was delicious. I didn't use the carrots, but tossed in red and green pepper and mushrooms. I also used a little bit more broth than asked for but the flavours really mixed well together. I used minced garlic and instead of angel hair pasta I used spaghettini. It smells divine when cooking and tastes even better. I have been looking for a pasta sauce that is herb and broth based and this is PERFECT! 
Thanks
A.

I have served this to my family over and over and they love it just as it is.  I also have served this with a jar of Alfredo sauce mixed in for a little creamy consistancy and might add my family prefers it with the alfredo sauce even more.  Either way you fix this recipe, its 5 star.  (Use fresh veggies and experiment with snow peas, mushrooms, as well as broccoli and carrots, you can't go wrong with this versatile recipe.)

very good. I used chicken broth soup instead of just broth. added chopped up sun dryed tomatoes, shalots, sliced greenand red peppers ( allways have a bag of frozen peppers in the freezer). good recipe to use up what ever you have in fridge.

Wonderful dish! This was a very light and healthy meal to serve my family. I did season the chicken with garlic powder and onion powder prior to cooking. I will definitly make this tasty pasta again!

This was a good start to a great recipe. It was a little bland but I was inspired so I made it again last night.
My changes:
I seasoned the chicken after it was cubed. I added some garlic and onion powders and salt and black pepper. 
I used about 1/2 the oil to cook the chicken but added 1/2T of butter (great flavor of butter but the nice high burning point of olive oil)
I did not drain the chicken on paper towels--so much yummy flavor would be wasted that way!
I boiled the pasta in 1/2 water, 1/2 chicken stock (I just added a tablespoon or two of chicken bullion to the boiling water)
I cooked the veggies as suggested but removed them before I added the broth.
I made a roux (melted butter cooked with the same amount of white flour) and then added twice the chicken broth and basil. The stock will thicken and make a very flavorful sauce that is just wonderful on the pasta.
Finally, I left out the cheese. I don't really care for parmesan. 

Sue, thank you for a wonderful start and great inspiration!

My husband and I both enjoyed this dish. I recommend drastically increasing the amount of carrots and rinsing the angel hair pasta and sprinkling it with extra virgin olive oil. The taste is great.

This recipe is very much a tease. It smells great while cooking, but when it's time for the actual eating you are let down. It has great potential but like other reviewers have stated it is a bit bland. I still make it from time to time because it is healthy and easy and I'm hoping I will figure out a way to spice it up.

Here is a tip: Don't bother adding the Parmesan cheese while cooking. All it does is stick to the pan. Put it out on the dinner table for people to sprinkle on their plates before eating.

I loved this recipe.  Added a bit of salt and pepper, maybe a little more olive oil than called for, but otherwise thought it was excellent.  I'll make it again.  Sad that others rate it "bland"...do they not have any common sense to add a bit of salt?

This recipe is great!! Instead of cubed chicken breast I shredded chicken thighs which seemed to hold in more of the flavor, although it made the dish a little less healthy.  I also added more garlic and broth and just cut up some snack carrots, because that's all I had. This recipe is very expendable because you can use any kind of pasta and as much or as little ingredients as you'd like and it will still come out awesome. I thought the flavor was spectacular.

My boyfriend and I tweak this a little. For instance, we saute the chicken with minced garlic, add oregano to the chicken stock, use ziti instead of angel hair b/c the sauce doesn't coat the angel hair very well. We also use a bag of frozen broccoli, carrots, and cauliflower for variety. Otherwise, this is really easy and has become a standard "fall back" dinner.

OK, but not much flavor. My 11 year old, who loves broccoli, picked out the broccoli and hated the rest.  If I were to use this again, I would add more garlic and some white wine. I would also have doubled the amount of chicken broth and let it cook down somewhat to give it a more concentrated flavor.

I cooked this for dinner yesterday, and it was great. My boyfriend is very pickie about eating diffrent things, but when I saw his was finished I ask him did he like it and he said "YES"....I was shocked. I cooked the chicken in rosemary oliver oil for more flavor, I brought a bag of mixed frozen veggies, and use more broth...wonderful dish.

My husband and I really liked this but we messed with the recipe a little as so many did as well!  We used 6 chicken breasts, 2 carrots, 1 head of garlic (we really like garlic!), 2 cups broth, 2 t. basil, and 3/4 cups Parmesan.  I would add the cheese right before serving instead of mixing it in the pan.  We will definetly make this again!  My husband and I and two or our children ate dinner from it and then there was enough for my husband and I the next day for lunch!  Yeah!  I love leftovers!

We all love this!  I don't put any chicken in because I like to do one meatless meal a week and the recipe I orginally had for this was a meatless one.  I don't measure any of the spices or the broth or cheese but I think I probably add more of each of those than what the recipe says.  For the vegetables I do fresh broccoli, red and green bell peppers, zucchini, and carrots.  So glad that I came across this recipe again.

I took others suggestions and "spiced it up" a bit - - i doubled the cheese and when i cooked the chicken, i seasoned with basil and lawry's seasoning salt.

This was okay, but not our favorite. The chicken turned a bit dry and wasn't that much compared to the angel hair pasta.

My husband and I both really enjoyed this recipe.  We added a some shredded italian-blend cheese on top for a little something extra.  I know many are saying that it's bland, but I liked the fact that it had a milder taste and was much lighter than pasta dishes with heavier sauces.  We'll definitley be making this one again.

I've made this twice now and both times it turned out delicious.  The last time I didn't have any carrots so I used sauted onion, califlower and spinach along with the broccoli.  Both times, in place of just basil I used a Garlic & Herb mixture (from Sam's Club).  
This made a very thick sauce and I sprinked the dish with some extra Parmesan cheese when it was finished, too.

I really like this recipe, it is not very flavorful, but I add more carrots, broccoli and spices to it to help it along.  My son asks for this recipe all the time.

This comes together very quickly. We all loved the change of pace, pasta with a light sauce. The only changes I made was using fresh broccoli and cutting the pasta back to 8 ounces, which was still too much for us. Highly recommended.

This is a good recipe for my children. They really like it. I do add a lot more chicken broth than the recipe calls for though, otherwise it is just too dry.

This was good but not great...I followed the advice of some others and seasoned the chicken before cooking, I didn't fully cook initially since it was going to cook in the broth and didn't want it overcooked and tough.  I added some extra garlic...I also use chicken bouillon instead of broth for more flavor and made 3 cups so the pasta wouldn't be dry.  I added some cornstarch to thicken the broth, since my family prefers a little thicker sauce, but still found it needed a little more flavor even after using additional parmesan cheese at the table.....I think if I make it again, I will use some additional seasoning and serve with garlic bread and a salad.

I found this to be a good start to a great recipe.  My husband is a chef and he said fresh herbs would be better, I agree. Also some of the suggestions with the peppers sound good.  You can really fix this up. Thanks for the start.

My family liked this fairly simple recipe. I was quite pleased that all the ingredients were in my pantry/frig. It taught me that a decent recipe doesn't have to be too complicated. It doesn't hurt that I'm brave enough to try variations, so I will use this as a basic recipe to modify as tastes or ingredients require. Since I didn't have angel hair pasta on hand, so I usee bow-tie pasta instead, and maybe too much broth which made the sauce a bit too thin. Still tasty though. Next time, I will tenderize the meat so it's a little easie to chew the chicken cubes.  (My daughter has an orthodontic expander right now.)  Thank you!

This dish was very easy to make and took no time at all.  The chicken is very tasty, along with the vegetables, it was a nice light tasting meal.  My husband thought the sauce was too plain so if your a sauce lover, I recommend you try this with a tomato sauce.

An old boyfriend of mine used to make this and it's the only reason I now eat broccoli.  Fast forward 10 years and it's now my toddler's favorite meal and I'm making it today for her 3rd birthday.  Yummy, easy and healthy, it doesn't get much better than that.

This was so yummy, I am not an experimentor when it comes to trying new recipes, but I am trying to do low fat for my cholesterol and thought this looked really good and could tweek it a little and that is what I did, added red,yellow, and green bell peppers, ommited the carrots. And I used whole wheat thin Spaghetti instead of Angel hair....It was a major hit, could not believe all the flavor, and I didn't even have any basil to put in...now I want to try more recipes on Allrecipes.com...thanks for helping...

An excellent alternative to cream based pastas and VERY easy to customize.  I seasoned the chicken with Cajun seasoning to add a little "kick" in flavor.  I left out the carrots since we neither one like them.  Added asparagus and mushrooms.  It turned out fantastic.  My husband was complimenting me all through dinner about MY new recipe.  I didn't want to spoil it and tell him it was yet another recipe from All recipes.

Both my husband and I really liked this.  There wasn't an overload of flavor, but the flavor was just right in my opinion.  We made it exactly as the recipe called for it, and it turned out great.  We had enough left over for lunch the next day, too.  Leftover pasta is the best.

This was excellent.  I made a few changes.  Sprinkled chicken with cracked black pepper before cooking.  I used 2 carrots, some sliced red onion, 1/2 lb sliced mushrooms as well as garlic and broccoli florets.  Cooked this a little longer and used more olive oil.  Also used more chicken broth.  My husband loved it. I enjoyed leftovers for lunch.

I thought that this chicken pasta was average. I did end up adding more broth & parmesan because it didn't seem like there was enough sauce after adding chicken & veggies. This chicken definately needs more flavor.

This was pretty good, although it could use a little more sauce to go with it.  My husband found the pasta dish too dry, but a little more chicken stock helped solved that problem.  We would prepare this again.

My family loves this recipe, and I have a very picky 6 year old. I use a frozen normandy mix instead of chopping carrots and it's so much easier. For those who say it's too bland just double the amount of basil and garlic. this is something that I make when i need something nutritious (i only use whole wheat noodles) that doesn't take long.

The kids loved this (except the broccoli)! I used a bag of stir fry veggies that had broccoli carrots and snap peas in it, they weren't frozen they were fresh. I added a little more chicken broth because it got dry when I mixed it all together.

Made similar changes as advised. Coated chicken pieces w/a mixture of garlic powder, onion powder, Italian seasoning, s+p. Doubled the recipe. Added a little cheddar cheese to thicken the sauce. Used fettuccine b/c that's what I had on hand. Husband and I used cajun/creole seasoning at the table to kick it up! Is easy and good- just needs some tweaking!

I loved this recipe.  It was easy and quick (although the dicing of the veggies did take a little bit, but so worth it), not to mention pretty healthy.  I am always looking for new recipes that I can incorporate vegetables in.  And that is exactly what I did... I used green peppers, broccoli, onion, fresh mushrooms and carrots.  I added more cheese and broth into the end step as we like more of a "sauce to coat our noodles.  Like other reviewers I also rubbed my chicken with garlic powder, onion powder, pepper and a tiny bit of crushed red pepper before I sauted it.  Flavors worked really well together.  Will definitely be making this again!

i found this recipe to be mediocre as written.  i used 2 full cups of broth (prepared from chicken with herbs bouillon) and the pasta was barely coated in sauce.  for personal preference i used frozen peas instead of the carrots and i enjoyed the combo of peas and broccoli together.  i think if i make it again i would put the pasta in individual bowls and top with the sauce, not mix it all together.  by the time we finished eating the leftover pasta in the serving bowl had absorbed all of the sauce, making leftovers the next day incredibly dry. i can only imagine how dry and bland it would have been prepared as written in the original recipe.

I used about 7 cloves of garlic, added a half onion, chopped, along with the carrots, and dumped a bunch of basil and oregano in, then topped it all off with freshly grated Agiago and Romano cheese.  I thought it was tasty, hubby thought it was kind of bland.  Go figure.

This was so good.  I didn't have any broccoli on hand, so substituted red bell pepper.  Also, didn't have any angel hair so used Organic wheat linguini instead.  I also added garlic salt, pepper to the chicken while it cooked.  While ckn was still in pan, I added 1 tsp more of olive oil and the veggies and garlic and fresh basil (we have a farmers market here in portland so I utilize fresh organic carrots and basil) to the pot with the chicken and stir fried them all together for about give minutes.  I then added the stock and simmered for a few minutes, then added the cheese to the pan, stirred and added in my drained pasta.  It was delicious.  Will make again.

I agree with alot of the reviews that it is kinda bland and 8oz of pasta will suffice. But if you double the olive oil, carrots, basil and add 1/2 cup corn (frozen or canned), SALT & PEPPER to taste, 3/4-1/2 tbsp oregano, 1/2 tbsp minced onion, then in a seperate sauce pan mix the chicken broth with 2-3 leveled tbsp of cornstarch til desired consistency; add to spices above and DO NOT add the cheese to this mix, UNLESS YOU WANT GLUE. Instead garnish the plate with it (and as much as you'd like!)

I was very disappointed because I was looking foward to serving a more healthy pasta dish...This had absolutely NO FLAVOR at all. Plus, there was way too much angel hair pasta for the amount of veggies and sauce, though I wouldn't call it a sauce...

I love this recipe!  I boiled the pasta noodles in the chicken drippings to give it more flavor.  I also sprinkled the parmesan cheese on top right before I served it, rather than mix it with the vegetables.  This has become one of my favorite recipes!

This was a difficult recipe to rate.  I read many of the reviews before starting and so did add additional chicken broth (1 14 oz can).  I tasted the sauce and it didn't have much flavor though other than the basil and so I added some lemon juice.  The sauce was rather thin, so I reduced it a lot, then thickened with a couple of table spoons of butter.  The best thing the dish had going for it was the low cal/low fat factor and the butter lost that.  It really needed more flavor and more sauce, but my notoriously picky 8 year old neice loved it.  So, I may play around with it some more and see if I can find a way to get some more flavor in it without the butter.

This was very good and easy to make.  As previously suggested, I tenderized the chicken breast before cooking.  This made it very easy to chew.  I also added more garlic than the recipe requested and this made it very tasty.  My husband loved it.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks...

This is a wonderful recipe. Very light and healthy. I used fresh brocolli and lots of garlic. I added a tablespoon of flour to thicken the "sauce". It would have been just broth otherwise. That worked very nicely.

This recipe is delicious and really easy to make.
Instead of using olive oil, I used margarine which gave the dish a great taste.  I also added extra cheese and used fresh broccoli, because I enjoy cheese.  I didn't have basil, so I used thyme and chives.

Very good recipe... However, I've found that my family and I like it better now that we've cut the amount of pasta in half.

Very very good!! I seasoned the chicken with some garlic herb Mrs. Dash before grilling it on my grill pan. I used frozen carrots and broccoli that I microwaved for about 2 min before sauteed them in olive oild and miced garlic. I added a little bit of onion powder and red pepper flakes in addition to about a full cup of chicken broth. Served it all over Angel Hair (My favorite pasta). This will definitely be a dish that is made often at our house.

So delicious and so easy to make!  I LOVE this recipe and it is devoured by the hubby and kids.  I cheat a little by adding frozen sliced carrots instead of slicing a fresh carrot.  Highly recommend!!

I decided to try this one tonight. This is a good recipe, and a very quick and easy one at that. However, my boyfriend (like someone else had mentioned) said it was a little dry and needed a sauce. Vjgunkel59's idea for adding Alfredo sauce might be a good idea. I also decided to add green onions and lemon juice to it for an extra kick. It would be five stars if it was a little more creamy and saucy... other than that it was delicious.

I just did not like the way this turned out. I think the chicken needs to be grilled and the sauce was lacking any kind of real flavor. I may play around with the idea behind the dish.

This was pretty good.  It was sort of bland though.  When I reheated the leftovers I saute'ed single servings at a time in a skillet again and added zucchini and more garlic and red pepper flakes.  Once it was heated up, I added the pasta to the pan with the veggies and chicken and added some butter.  It was much better the second night!!

Not much for flavor- had to add salt and still didn't have much to it.  The seasoning needs to be tinkered with.

Taste was very good and it was a nice, quick recipe.   The only thing that didn't seem to work out for me was the cheese - it kind of clumped up and didn't really make a nice sauce. I probably will remove the veggies, then mix in the cheese and make the cheesy sauce, then return everything to the pan next time.  I also added some onion powder, garlic salt and pepper to the chicken as it was cooking.

Update: Made again using leftover turkey that I added at the tail end of the veggie stir-fry just to heat up.  I didn't have the recipe in front of me, so I just used enough broth to make the sauce creamy - no clumping!  I used fresh broccoli, added more basil, more carrot and apparently more broth than the recipe called for and this time it was 5 stars!

I didn't have any basil so I used some Italian seasoning and a garlic vegetable seasoning.  It turned out really well.  Will definitely make again.  Next time I won't make the chicken in oil though.

Dear Sue (hope you're still around), Had to let you know about my experience with your recipe. A few yrs ago my 4 y.o. grandson wanted to learn how to cook, I was making this for only the 2nd time but I let him make it. I did the chopping, he did all the cooking (from a step-stool.) It was great, we talked during the prep, he learned the words saute and sizzle and he caught my love for cooking. We love this dish, eat it all the time, it's soooo yummy and the memories make it even more special. Now he's nine, makes a salad and bakes a loaf of ready-to-bake french bread to go with this meal, lol he thinks he's a chef now! Thanks a bunch, we love this!

I have been making this recipe for years now. I love it. I like to use other kinds of pasta suck as rotini or bowties. After draining the pasta, I toss it with a little of the chicken broth so it doesn't seem dry when eating it. You can also use the pre-cooked chicken strips from the grocery store to save time.

Very good!  I added mushrooms, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  I thought there was a little too much chicken broth, so I will reduce it to a half cup or less next time I make this.  Overall, it was delicious and easy.  And healthy too!!

I followed previous suggestions and sauteed onions with the chicken, added mushrooms, and a bit more basil.  Next time I'll add at least 1 cup of chicken broth ... The 2/3 still tasted a bit dry.

We made this for dinner the other night and I loved it! My husband said it was good, but needed more cheese (we limited his though since we are watching his cholestrol). My mom also liked it, but she's also a cheese fanatic and added more to her bowl. :) Definitely healthier then cream based dishes...will make again. Thank you!

I made this for my family last night and they loved it.  Following the advice of some previous reviewers I seasoned my chicken with cajun spice before cooking to give it a little more flavor.  It must have done the trick because my husband rave about it.  Nice and light and very tasty.

This recipe had lots of potential but my family did not care for it.  We found it bland even with the garlic and the basil.  It needed a light cream sauce of some kind.  Not sure that I would try it again.

Very quickly made and delicious.  I don't care much for heavy pasta sauces so this was a nice topping for the pasta.  I increased the chicken broth and the garlic a bit and leftovers were good too.

4 1/2 STARS  This was very good!!!  I made a few changes and my family loved it!  I added 1/4 cup of chopped onion, and about 1 cup and a 1/2 of sliced mushrooms, salt and pepper.  I also used penne pasta instead of angle hair and it took probably another 2 minutes to boil.  The only problem I had was that you didn't mention at which point to add the chicken broth, so I just cooked the carrots and other veggies in it.  This was great and is very healthy!  Thanks!!!

This was a good recipe.I did tweak it some with others suggestions.used the enhanced spaghetti from this site.Did not have fresh carrots so used a can that I drained. Before I cooked the chicken I put salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder then cooked the chicken,       carrots and broccoli in chicken broth in stead of the oil. My 4 kids and husband liked this very much and are already asking for more.

Full of flavour and so easy to prepare!  I will definitely be making this again.  

Also, as another reviewer mentioned, there is so much you can do with this recipe.  I didn't have any broccoli (totally thought I had did, but they turned out to be brussel sprouts) so I used green pepper and green beans instead.  I look forward to making this again when I actually do have broccoli on hand.

Delicious! My only issue is that I cut this recipe in half & felt that 6 oz pasta was way too much! So next time I'm going to double the rest of the ingredients but keep the pasta amount the same. I was more generous with the garlic & sprinkled the chicken with italian seasoning before cooking it. Great, quick, healthy recipe & thank you!

Great recipe!  It is very flexible so you can put your own spices according to your taste.  The sauce made from the parmesan cheese and the broth was great.  I didn't completely drain the pasta so it wouldn't be dry and it worked out perfectly!  This is definitely one of my favorites so far!

We really liked this, and it was so healthy!  I added some more spices--extra garlic and some lemon pepper, it seemed to add a lot of taste.  It was nothing spectacular, but a great everyday meal.

I didnt like the fact that there is really no sauce with this dish. The pasta seems dry. I used this recipe and found it quite bland. I did everything the recipe stated but when it came down to eating it it fell short of my expectations.

This was just ok - DH liked it more than I did which is why it got three stars.  I found the taste to be very bland, it really needed something to punch some flavour into it - I just don't know what.  For the most part I followed the recipe, the only differences were that I used frozen brocolli instead of fresh, I added a teaspoon or two of cornstarch to the broth mixture to thicken it (so it would cling to the noodles) and I sprinkled the parmesan cheese over the dish at the end (as suggested by other reviewers).  It was definitely a nice, low-fat dish, but really lacked flavour.  Another point to mention is that it defintely does not serve 6 people.  I served 4 people, along with bread and salad and it was *barely* enough.

Delicious!  I was pleasantly surprised!  I loved the light taste you get when you saute in olive oil!  I ended up cooking the broccoli from frozen and it gave it a little more sauce.  I found the cheese to really add to the recipe.  In the end, I mixed in the cooked noodles, doused it with a good dose of soy sauce and put a lid on it and let it steam together for about 5 minutes.  I also seasoned the chicken a little with some season salt and some basil while it was cooking.  Great flavor!

SO GOOD!! Don't add alfredo as some other reviewers suggested, in my opinion it would ruin this dish. This is meant to be light and it is so good!! We added fresh basil, yellow squash and red pepper as well....

Hubby and I agree - this is a keeper!!  Due to other reviews, I used about a cup of broth and I thickened the sauce with a bit of cornstarch.  I also sprinkled the cheese over the top of the completed dish rather than stir it in.  Not only did this taste good, it also made a very nice and colorful presentation when served from a platter.

This was so easy, I've made the vegetables for a side dish.  The only thing I would change is to add a sauce that sticks to the pasta...or make more of the chicken broth/parmesean mixture.  That didn't coat the noodles enough, so the Alfredo sauce might have met this a little better.

I thought this recipe was very delicious.  Only when I make it again I plan to boil the pasta in chicken broth rather than water, b/c they lacked flavor.  My husband doesn't like cooked vegetables--period...so he wasn't very happy with it.  But I liked it!

This was pretty good but we had to add alfredo sauce to the pasta because it was very plain with no sauce.  I'd probably make this again.

I prepared the recipe as stated. It is on the bland side. The parmesan broth mixture was good, but mild. I served this with crusty rolls and it was a satisfying dinner for me. My husband did not enjoy it and did not finish his portion-- it wasn't filling or flavorful enough for his taste.

The first time I made this we ran out, the second time I had to make a double recipe. I make it at least once a week. It is my husband's absolute favorite and he asks for it all the time. Even better with fresh parmesean. This recipe is great!!!

This recipe tasted great and was quick and easy. I did as the other reviews had suggested and added more cheese and less broth.  I used the garlic flavored chicken broth which gave it a wonderful taste.  I also added my favorite seasoning to the mix, Tony Chacheres!

This was a really good recipe, and had more flavor than i had thought it would.  However, i would recommend increasing the sauce/chicken mixture for whatever serving size listed.

This recipe was very quick and easy but lacked a bit on flavour.  The kids didn't really care for it much.  I think I would consider adding something to give it a little more zing next time.

It's a good start, but it is a bit bland.  I think next time I will use fresh basil baste rather than dried basil.  Also it needs more sauce, so I think I will double the chicken broth, and it needs to be thickened a little (corn starch perhaps?)  I think onions, and maybe a little more garlic would be a nice addition.

I made this with Dreamfields (low carb) pasta, so it was actually very healthy and good for my diabetic husband.

I made some adjustments: I didn't use any meat. Instead of dry basil, I used fresh. I also used tricolor pasta instead of angel hair.

I sauteed the garlic in olive oil first, then added the carrots and broccoli and seasoned with salt and pepper. I cooked the veggies for about 4 minutes, then added the chicken broth. I brought the veggie broth mixture to a boil and boiled for 5 minutes. I added the cooked tricolor pasta, then cheese and fresh basil, and seasoned with some more salt and pepper.

It was delicious, my husband and I both went back for seconds!

This was really good I used oregano instead of basil and added some salt and pepper! I also used a rotisserie chicken to speed things up a bit.

This was very good, very easy to prepare and marvelous for a week night dish. I loved it, my son said it needed "more flavor".  Next time I think I'll add onions and mushrooms.  The only substitution I made was fresh basil instead of dried.

A quick and easy meal!  I used fresh broccoli & carrots and about a TBSP of fresh basil.  I also finished cooking the pasta in the pan, tossed with the rest of the ingredients so the pasta would have more flavor.  This required me to add extra chicken broth in order to keep the dish moist.  Very yummy!

I loved this recipe. Simple, and healthy. I actually used pork because that was what i had thawed. I also used organic whole wheat bow tie noodles. It turned out great even with these changes. I did double the amount of the chicken broth / parmasaen cheese mixture.

This dish was well received by my family of picky eaters.  I blanched the vegies quickly to retain their color.  and added a little white wine.  It was very easy to make, I'd definitely try it again, maybe kick it up just a notch!

We loved this recipe.  For those that thought it was bland, I sprinkled my chicken pieces with lemon pepper before cooking.  Nothing about this was bland!  The only other change I made was to stir-fry chopped onion and green pepper with the carrots.  My husband ate two helpings and even suggested trying the leftovers as a cold salad.

I made this last night for dinner with high hopes due to the rating, and unfortunately, I was let down. I made a few additions based on user reviews. I chopped up garlic and onion and added it to the chicken while it was cooking, and also added some dry white wine.  I also seasoned the chicken with s/p and some cajun seasoning. I added additional garlic to the veggies and also added red bell pepper and a splash on white wine with the chicken stock. When the pasta was done, I added some EVOO to keep it from being too dry, since that was the complaint from reviewers. Even though it tasted ok, it wasn't AS GOOD as everyone made it out to be. My b/f said it tasted like a frozen bagged meal...and I agree. It does get 3 stars b/c my 3yr old daughter loved it and ate 4 (small) servings.

This came together quickly.  I used a whole can of chicken broth, and then added 1/2 can of chicken gravy just to thicken the sauce up some.  I seasoned the chicken with s&p/garlic, and onion powders.  DH loved it, as did I.  The son ate it, but picked out the veggies.....I didn't have the fresh basil, but when I can pick it out of my garden this summer, I will make this again.

Good recipe!  I halved it, and it was MORE than enough to feed two adults and one toddler (who loved it!) (leftovers for SURE).  I did put a whole carrot in (instead of halving it too), used the juice from some canned diced tomatoes in place of the broth, added a large spoonful of the tomatoes themselves too.  We used twice as much cheese (if not more!) which tasted great - and also used acini de pepe instead of angel hair, as I find it's easier for our son to get on a spoon than other pastas.

Great recipe! The only substitution I made was asparagus for the broccoli since it was on sale. Next time I will put in another carrot or two. My husband thought it needed a little salt but I disagreed. I will put it in our regular rotation.

My husband and I both thought that it was very bland even though I doubled the garlic.  Substituted what I had on hand, which fettucini instead of angel hair and yellow squash and spinach for the broccoli.  It wasn't bad, just bland.  I won't cook it again.

I thought this recipe was pretty awful, as did the rest of my family!  I added some spices to the chicken (thank goodness!) but thought the pasta part was pretty bland.  We added a ton of parmesan cheese to the top after which made it a little better.

I made this a while back but forgot to review. We really liked this, I had to substitute green beans for the broccoli but it was very yummy. I cooked the pasta in chicken broth and seasoned my chicken the way I like them so I think that really helped with the flavor.

I also added a drained can of sliced water chestnuts to this as well and used frozen carrot rounds and it came out great with a nice crunch!

I really did think this was good and the kids seemed to like it much to my surprise. But my major complant was that there was no sause for the pasta. I gave butter to the husband and kids so the pasta wasn't to dry.  I think I will make it again but I will be thinking of a way to have some sause.

Absolutely wonderful!  I didn't have any angel hair, so I used penne.  I expect it would be good with any pasta.  As a personal preference I would like equal parts of broccoli and carrots, but that's a minor thing.  I will also add a bit more broth next time--and there will definitely be a next time!  This is a great light pasta recipe, and a nice change from tomato or cream based sauces. Excellent!

Very tasty and easy to make.  However the parmesan cheese just turned to glue.  Will make again omitting the cheese.

I used to make this years ago and just came across it again.  I put broth in with the water to cook the noodles and it keeps it from being too bland.

I made this with ziti instead of angel hair. It didn't really appeal to my husband and I.  My husband thought it was too bland.  My son ate his without the pasta and added soy sauce and he thought it was okay.  Not something I would make again.

This was so delicious that I'm giving it 5 stars even though I made a few personal changes. My husband won't eat broccoli, so I used chopped green pepper. I also covered the skillet at the end and simmered it for about 10 minutes to soften the veggies even more. The only change I would definitely recommend would be to stir in the cheese at the very end, just before serving, as the last simmering melted it into strange globs. Overall, a new favorite recipe! Thanks, Sue!

This was a simple and healthy meal, but it did taste rather bland. I added 2 tomatoes cut up in small chunks and sprinkled extra cheese on top of each serving. Next time I'll double the chicken broth and thicken it with cornstarch....maybe that will help with flavor. The broth just sits on the bottom of the dish otherwise.

With a little tweaking this recipe can be great.  You have to use 2.5 cups of chicken broth and double the parmesan cheese. Also the parmesan melts and sticks to the pan so you might want to wait until it is off the burner to add it. You should cut the pasta down to 8 oz and you can add more carrots, garlic or broccoli if you like. And you might want to use garlic salt and parmesan to top off the dish before eating.

The flavor of this was great, but we would like it better with a cream sauce.  The sauce was just too thin.  I'm going to make this again, but with a cream sauce.

I was very surprised that this recipe earned the average number of stars it did.  This dish was so flavourless and dry!!  I used way more broth and parmesan than the recipe called for to give it extra flavour.  The good thing about this dish is that it is very light.

Delicious eating and easy to prepare but it makes a TON!  I knew I was in trouble when I drained the pasta (too bad I didn't figure that out before I cooked it).  I use a cup of cooked pasta as a serving size for portion control.  So, I got way more than 4 servings!  Next time, I'll probably cut the pasta back to 8 ounces.  We enjoyed the dish very much and will add this recipe to our pre-roadrace carbo-loading menus in the future!

I made this recipe as is last night. It went well with my most pickiest eater: my 5 yo daughter. My husband loved it as well and took the leftovers to work for lunch. This is a versatile dish according to other reviews and can be customized to your own taste. My husband says that this is definately something he would like to have again.

I have been making this recipe for a couple of years now. It is really good, and my husband enjoys it too. I always leave the carrot out. The sauce is thin, but I love the taste of the basil and Parmesan. It's fairly light in taste, and delicious.

This is a very good and light recipe.  I have made it a few times and I tend to add red, yellow and orange peppers for extra color.  I also use almost 2 cans of chicken broth.  And I think the ingredient that really makes this dish flavorful is the fresh parmesan, there is just no comparison of fresh paremsan to the stuff that comes in the can.  I also grate up extra parmesan to top it off.

Nice, quick, super easy dish.  Gives me yet another opportunity to use my wok.  I sprinkle a little parmesean on the hot noodels before I add the veggies on top.  I don't like the salt in the pasta water, I use a drop or two of olive oil instead.

Taste is wonderful. Might add a little more chicken broth so pasta/chicken mix is not as dry. I added some diced tomatoes for a little extra kick and color!

This was tastier than I thought it would be, howerver, I should have listened to other reviews and used less pasta - it was a little too dry.  I just added more chicken broth.  Next time I will use less pasta and use a little more chicken and chicken broth.  Maybe try with peas and carrots instead of broccoli and carrots.  Overall, very tasty and everyone (9 of us) liked it alot.

This is a great recipe for a quick and tasty meal.  I like to add a little more parmesan and a little less broth to thicken it up a little.  A slight hint of a spicy something (like crushed red pepper) can give it a little more bite.

I think that this recipe would be better with either cutting the amount of pasta in half or doubling the other ingredients.  It came out very dry.

I found this recipe to be totally tasteless and a horrible waste of chicken breast meat!

Very nice recipe; I made chicken and vegetables only, without pasta, since I do not eat it. I added snow peas to the blend and skipped Parmesan. Also, I used white wine instead of broth. Delicious, will make again, and will try various vegetables.

Easy to make, but flavor was lacking. Next time I will probably add crushed red pepper to spice it up.

My finace absoutly loved this dish.  He's not a fan of cream sauce, or tomato sauce so this was perfect.  Will make over and over again!

i made this recipe for my boyfriend's birthday, and it was perfect!  we both loved it.  it was yummy and flavorful, even without tomato sauce (and as someone who doesn't like sauce, i appreciate that a lot).  a+!  i look forward to making it again--i'm making sure to keep the recipe around.

I love to make this dish...it makes a lot, so I can have leftovers (which taste good cold as well, like a pasta salad).  I usually use a lot more veggies (I use frozen mixed veggies to make the dish really quick) and only 8oz. of pasta with extra spices (parsley, bay leaves, more garlic)

The cheese stuck to the bottom of the pan, so don't add it until after you take it off the burner. Also,  I only used 8 oz of angel hair, but the dish was still 90% pasta, and really bland.

Well, I have to agree with some of the others...this to me was BLAND. I had to add alot more cheese to this and mozarella on the top. It really does need a CREAM sauce. My husband really liked it though. Or was he just being nice? The flavor I think would be better the next day after herbs have a chance to set into the chicken and pasta more. Thanks!

Very good.  I did add some herbs (marojam, oregano, basil, etc.) to it thought to 'jazz' it up a little.  Regular spaghetti worked fine in lieu of angel hair pasta.

This EXACT same recipe came in the mail and I was eager to try it out. I prepared it a few weeks ago and was dissapointed. The vegetables and chicken tasted great, but the pasta was very bland and dry. There just isn't enough sauce to "stick" to the pasta. I may fix it again as an appetizer...it seemed more like a salad than a main dish.

Pretty good recipe, this needs something but I haven't decided what it is yet. It needs more of  a zing. There is not enough sauce....and the noodles taste blah. It was okay thou.  I just added some cavenders seasoning......
