These cookies are buttery, crumbly and so delicious! The only thing I changed was I added a shake of salt. I also made them smaller than suggested so once they were done baking they were about 1 inch in diameter. I love that this recipe really doesn't require much, and anyone could make these, I just toss everything in the bowl at once and stir! I will be making these for years to come! Great Cookies!

So yummy.  I love the texture!  They are delightful as is, but this time, I used 1/2 tsp vanilla and a 1/2 tsp almond extract and made a lemon glaze with confectioner's sugar and fresh lemon juice as a fun variation.

This was very good and easy. I was skeptical with the amount of corn starch and no egg but they're wonderful. We dipped in melted chocolate and let cool. Yum!

These are fabulous! So easy to make and they taste wonderful. I used palin vanilla extract instead of bourbon vanilla extract and they were great. Everyone loved them.

These were exactly as described.  Very light melty and delicious.  i was surprized by the lack of liquid and so added a tiny bit extra vanilla, but  they were really good, particularly right out of the oven.   They are rich and not too sweet. For company i might dredge them in powdered sugar or dip them in chocolate.. but for now, they are perfect with coffee :)

This one's a keeper.   Fabulous as is, but could be dressed up with drizzled melted chocolate or dusted with powdered sugar for the holidays. Be forwarned - these are addicting!

Instead of melting in your mouth, the cookies do more of a crumbling. If they weren't so airy, they'd be considered dry. Eating it is like eating cotton candy. It's insubstantial so you can eat alot without getting full.

I made these last night for the first time! Yum, they really are melt-in-your mouth good. I think you could change them up with different falvored extracts, or even spices like cinnamon. Super simple and delish!

Very good shortbread cookie. A little fragile though. I dressed it up with some Christmas colors sprinkles for the holidays and they look wonderful.

Universal household response: "too much... something." They're not awful, and they're incredibly easy, but they also aren't very good.

A definite 5 star recipe! My husband loves rock biscuits and i used this recipe but instead of rolling into a log and cutting, i just dropped them into the muffin tray and they look & taste fantastic! Got 6 large boscuits using this method.

I tried the recipe with my son because it looked simple to mix. The texture looked right for my cookie press so we tried it and it worked great! We  add food coloring and an additional teaspoon of almond extract. It turned out so good we made a second batch, used a different color and added peppermint extract to that batch and couldn't have been more pleased. We're already planning decorations for Christmas.

I LOVE these cookies!  I'm a shortbread fan and these are just like a light, fluffy shortbread. They literally do melt in your mouth.  I couldn't find the bourbon vanilla, so I used 1/2 almond extract and 1/2 vanilla.  Have already made this recipe several times, but I always double the recipe because they don't last long!

Good Cookies.  We were almost out of everything and the kids were asking for cookies.  With no white sugar and no eggs or milk, I thought we were out of luck...then I found this recipe!  It was great and easy.  I put them in a ziploc bag and the next day they were soft...yum.

I didn't like them at all. I did add walnuts. I wasn't even going to give it to the staff to eat, but I did and they loved it. Even asked for a copy of the recipe. The 2nd time I made them I though they were good. I guess I just had to get used to the dryness and texture of the cookies.

This is a nice little cookie... I did add a dash of salt.... next time think might try like some orange or lemon zest...!! And even maybe adding some pecans.. Love the chocolate drizzle idea or even a lemon glaze....oh maybe even some chopped cranberries or dried cherries.. a very versitile cookie dough....

I made half the batch as instructed and I added chocolate chips on the remaining half. I found all of them to be too buttery and not sweet enough. Simple to make though, but I could not get myself to crave these cookies at all.

I didn't care for these cookies.  Their texture was very odd -- they do have a "melting" effect, but they are extremely dry, which isn't surprising given the mixture of powdered sugar, corn starch, and flour.  Also, although they were soft when I took them out of the oven, they crumbled apart when I tried to put them away after they cooled for an hour or so.  We just threw the cookies away.

One of my favorite childhood cookies! These are easy and so yummy! Add in a little cocoa powder and you've got chocolate melting moments!
