I do not like canned grean beans and I really do not like canned soup-except for canned broccoli soup. It goes without saying, I do not like this kind of green bean casserole normally.  

I did like this. The cream of broccoli made a huge difference. I didn't see a huge difference in the use of cheddar onion stuff. All the same, I did like this.  Thank you.

WONDERFUL!!! This year (2008) was my first time making Thanksgiving dinner, and this is a permanent side dish! I added a few dashes of cayenne pepper to give it a little kick. My family LOVED this dish!! It was gone before dinner was over, and I doubled the recipe! My mom begged me for the recipe and plans on making it herself and not just for the holidays... THANK YOU FOR SHARING THIS RECIPE!!

I made this green bean casserole tweaking the recipe a bit based on the food items available at my local supermarket. I've never in my life seen cream of broccoli soup so I used broccoli cheese condensed soup. I also have never seen the cheese flavored fried onions so I just used the regular onions. I love onions so I added a little bit more than the recipe called for. Threw in a little sprinkling of shredded cheddar cheese. 

It was wonderful!

I made this recipe last spring looking for a new green bean casserole recipe that did not use cream of mushroom soup and this version was absolutely wonderful...very tasty....the family loved it as well.   I may try cream of celery soup next time just to change things up.

Great recipe!  I make a double batch for family gatherings and every time I come home with an empty casserole dish. I often put it together the day before and bake it right before it's time to serve. Definately a winner!

We loved this recipe.  Everyone expected the original version and upon the first bite would exclaim how good it was!  I would not only make this is the future, but may never use mushroom soup again.

This is a super recipe.  I had to modify mine because I didn't have the sour cream on hand and the french fried onions.  I used the salad dressing for the half cup of the sour cream and I used carmalized onions on top but it still tastes great.

Seriously, this was heavenly.  I made it at my first Thanksgiving dinner I ever put on, so it's amateur-approved.  I am going to make it again this weekend... it's seriously so delicious.  I used Broccoli Cheese soup instead of Cream of Broccoli... but I'm a cheese freak.

This is a GREAT dish!! I hated making green bean casserole because I hated it but everyone else liked it. So I tried this recipe on Thanks Giving I LOVED it and everyone else did too! So now everyone's asking for the recipe. :)

My family likes this recipe.  My kids don't like green beans. But, they will eat this.  The only thing I change is I use plain french fried onions.  Thank you!

I found this to just be an average green bean casserole.  Perhaps the problem was the broccoli soup (it was Campbells and not low fat).  I made half a recipe so the next day I had the other half of the soup (properly diluted) and I thought it didn't taste good.  I'll probably try this again, but I'll use a different soup.

This recipe is fantastic!  I followed it with the exception of using the fat-filled versions of the low-fat stated ingredients.  My kids even ate it...and I swear they won't eat anything green.  It's like they're allergic to the color.  Will definitely make this again and again!

As a cheap and easy side this was great, but the flavor was very bland.  Not something I would make again
