Mad this pie last night for a pie contest. Very easy and it turned out wonderfully. I already have requests to make this again for the holidays.

I thought this was really quite good.  I am not usually a fan of pumpkin pie. I added 1 tsp of vanilla extract and a tablespoon of flour since my homemade pumpkin pur√©e was looser than the stuff in the can.  Awesome.  The whole family enjoyed this and I will make it again.

This is a tasty little pie.  I did make a few slight changes.  I use pumpkin and butternut squash interchangeably, therefore I used butternut squash because I had so much from my garden.  Also, instead of using dark corn syrup (I had none) and white sugar, I used light corn syrup and brown sugar.  It came out beautifully.  Everyone enjoyed the pie.

Super easy using an electric hand mixer to blend the ingredients using a 15 oz can of pumpkin.  Instead of dark syrup I used maple syrup, then sprinkled just half cup chopped pecans and baked 45 min in a convection oven.  Pie looked and tasted great!  Thanks for the recipe!

this has been our favorite christmas pie now for a few years, I always liked pecan pie but found it too sweet  so this is the perfect way to tone it down just the right amount
