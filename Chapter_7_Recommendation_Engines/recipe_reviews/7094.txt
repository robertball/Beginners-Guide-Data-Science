Great taste and texture. Makes fabulous french toast. I replaced the oil with 1/2 the amount of banana. In my bread machine I needed to leave out the soaking of the oats. The dough was pleanty moist without the extra water in the oats.

I don't use a bread machine, but I tried this recipe anyway. I think the bread turned out very nicely. You can taste the banana, but it's not overpowering. Also, the bread is not very sweet at all, so that differentiates it from a quick bread. It turns out soft, and I think it would have been fairly dense, but I let is rise for a long time--about two hours for each of two rises. If you are a fan of banana breads, you may want to give this a try for something different.

The recipe came out with a sunken crust and an almost undercooked texture. The flavor was odd and salty. I threw it away. I think this happened because there is too much liquid in the ingredients.

I realllly wanted success with this recipe to bring up its 3 star rating thinking it must be good and others must be doing something wrong or expecting more of a sweet bread. Contrar mo frair! (boy was i wrong) This was an utter dissapointment and unedible waste of ingredients!

This recipe had no taste. Good texture but a waste of my time to make.

Don't know what setting to use so set on quick bread. That must have been a wrong guess cause it was so bad I threw it away. No flavor and turned into a ball of dough in my mouth. Yuk.

This came out well for us. I didn't have powdered buttermilk on hand so I used powdered milk and added a little vinegar to compensate. I also converted the recipe from a 1.5 to a 2 lb loaf. I let it cook on a delay setting in our bread machine and the next morning woke up to a wonderful warm loaf. I will make this again.
