This is "THE BEST" pot roast recipe on this site. I would give this 10+ stars, just for the smell alone while it was cooking. I mean I swear...the dog kept walking around with his nose in the air sniffing and when my husband walked thru the door he said "Oh my God, that smells incredible!" Here is what I did differently: I added seasoned salt and garlic powder to the flour/pepper mixture. I roasted the meat in the same pan that I browned it in. I did not use the wine called for. Instead I deglazed the pan with a can of undiluted beef consumme. I also added halved potatoes and carrots to the pot for the last hour. They were perfect-not mushy. I can honestly say I will never make a pot roast any other way.

Easy. Delicious. Satisfying. After browning the meat in a Dutch oven (used this from browning and roasting) I deglazed the pan with 1/2 cup white wine. (The same wine I used instead of Vermouth.) I didn't remove the meat to deglaze. After pouring the soup mixture over the roast I poured in a can of consommé. I upped my heat to 350 after the first hour. In the last hour and 10 minutes I added red potatoes and carrots. The consommé and flour from the meat made a slightly thick and full bodied gravy that was delicious over the meat slices and vegetables. I served this with a loaf of homemade bread and got rave reviews.

I got the thumbs up from the friends about the pot roast! I couldn't give it a 5 because I changed some stuff in it... but it's definitely 5-star quality.

I used onion gravy mix instead of onion soup since that's all I had. I had no vermouth, so I used the equal amount of water. I also rubbed some powdered garlic into the meat before flouring it. I also didn't cut off the fat before cooking since it added a bit of flavor (but definitely didn't serve it). I put carrots and potatoes in with the roast 2 hours after it was already in the oven.

I let it cook for a total of 5 hours (give it take 20 minutes) at 275 degrees. Very tender and pulled apart nicely!

Incredible pot roast. I have made this twice so far, as a matter of fact I have a roast made with this recipe in the oven as I type this. I seasoned my flour with a teaspoon on garlic powder, a teaspoon of salt and a teaspoon on paprika. I put slits in my rump roast and added garlic like some of the others did. I also substituted cream of celery soup because the cream of mushroom always ends up tasting tinny and has a strong tapioca flavor to it and sherry in place of the vermouth. I cut 2 large turnips into quarters and sliced a bermuda onion into thick slices and arranged that around my roast before cooking. SinceI like my pot roast cooking all day, I lowered the heat to 250 degrees and cooked it for 5 hours. The end result is a tender roast with a very savory gravy.

It was delicious and easy!  I did make a few modifications based on other's input.  Once the meat was browned, I rubbed minced garlic all over.  And, since I'm not a fan of cream of mushroom soup (although I love mushrooms), I used low sodium cream of celery soup and instead of the dry onion soup, I used 1 packet of dry onion with mushroom soup. I also used a zinfandel wine.  Forty-five minutes before removing from the oven I added carrots.  This was definitely a tops with my family.  It was served with mashed potatoes, green beans and fresh baguettes.  Thank you for sharing your recipe.

This is the best tasting pot roast I ever had!
So moist and juicy cooked in a rich gravy sauce.
I also added one can of french onion soup mix
and used a dry white wine instead of dry vermouth.
I added cut up carrots, red potatoes, and onions
to make a complete meal.  Very easy to make!

I've never had much success with making roasts. They always end up tough and hard to cut. This recipe was so easy, and everyone in the house LOVED it and raved over it. Out of 5 people, there are no leftovers.   I did what one of the reviewers recommended. I added season salt, salt and pepper and onion powder to the flour mixture. After searing all sides of the roast in the pan, I kept it in the pan and put it in the oven. I did not use wine, but a whole envelope of Lipton Onion Soup Mix and a can of beef broth. Two hours into baking, I added cut up onions, carrots and B red potatoes. Came out absolutely perfect and I'll never make a roast any other way. Thank you!

Best pot roast recipe I ever ate!  I made it with a very lean roast, a top round roast, and it was delicious! Thanks for the recipe. I also made it in a crockpot instead of the oven before work, and I did pan sear it like it called for.

Great recipe.  I increased the vermouth to 1 cup, added a soup can of water and increased the heat to 350 adding carrots, potatos and fresh green beans the last hour.  You can use chuck roast and it wonderful.

Real good comfort food!  Concerned with salt, I used low-sodium cream of mushroom soup, just a 1/3 packet of dry onion soup mix, and threw in 2 sliced yellow onions into the pot.  ADD FRESH ONIONS - it results in lots of gravy and a wonderful flavor. Also, sub'd white wine for the vermouth. Start checking the roast after 2 hours to test for doneness.  Love the idea of cooking pot roast in the oven (a new twist on a classic).  Soooo good with mashed potatoes - enjoy!    : )

This is a great recipe!!  Simple good food.  My husband and 22 year old son grin and salivate over this like puppies! I love that it cooks away and I can get some things done and the house smells so good. Here is what I do.  Brown the meat as directed in dutch oven (use olive oil, usually), use a sirloin roast, I use the wine to deglaze the pain.  I mix a cup of low sodium beef both with the soup and a full envelope of the onion soup and pour over the roast and mix with the deglazed wine still in the pan.  Cook for 2 3/4 hours, add potatoes, carrots and celery cut in large chunks and a 3 more cups of low low sodium beef broth and cook in oven for another 1 1/2 hours. I seem to need the extra broth for liquid both for the meat and the veggies.  The result is a tender meat and great flavor in the meat, veggies and gravy.  My husband sops up the gravy with bread and smiles.  There is no need to try another potroast recipe.  Many thanks!

My whole family absolutely LOVED this pot roast!  Thank you!  I had to make a few small changes because of what I had on hand (chuck roast instead of rump, I rubbed minced garlic on it before flouring, mushroom gravy mix instead of onion soup mix, and I used Chardonnay [dang, had to drink the rest ;)] but I only mention it to say how versatile this recipe is.  This is one I will definately add (by request) to our favorites.  Make some Rhodes Rolls to serve with this and put on your stretchy pants!

This was great! I usually make my pot roasts in the slow cooker, but this turns out MUCH tastier!! I made some changes to accommodate what I had on hand. I used a good quality black angus chuck roast that I got at my butcher's instead of the rump roast. I browned the roast in the butter in my 5 qt. Le Creuset braiser and then removed. I used 1/2 cup Merlot to deglaze the braiser (I didn't have vermouth). I then returned the roast to the braiser. I mixed one FULL pack of dry onion soup mix and one teaspoon of garlic powder with one can of cream of celery soup. I then poured the soup mixture over the roast and covered with the braiser's lid. No need to mix the deglazing wine with the soup mixture, it does it on its own while cooking. I baked at 300 for approx. 1.5 hours and then at 275 for 2 hours. (I have found when using cast iron in my oven, lower roasting temps. work much better for meats especially when covered with the cast iron lid.) Definitely my new way to cook pot roast, hubby swears the best ever, and I tend to agree. And on a side note, this dish will make your kitchen smell so good while it is cooking. Kinda makes you wish you could eat the air ;-)

I've never used a rump roast for pot roast before, but thought I'd actually follow the recipe since so many people gave it such good reviews.  I followed the recipe exactly and the meat was almost too tough to cut.  What a waste of time and money.

Fabulous meal!  My only 2 issues were it was the gravy was way too salty and the oven temperature and length of cooking time stated in recipe was off.   I pulled my roast at 2 hours and 15 minutes to insert my digital thermometer and the temp was already 160 degrees.  WAY over cooked!  Internal temp for a perfect roast should be 130-134 degrees.  Next time I will lower oven temp to 250 and cook for a longer period of time with my digital thermometer inserted well before I think it's even close to being done.  As far as the gravy being too salty from the onion soup mix (and I didn't add any salt) I fixed that by adding a peeled raw potato to the gravy and let it simmer on low for about 30 minutes.  The potato pulls the salt out and is an amazing trick that I use often.  Other than that, this recipe is great and I will be making it again and again and again!!

I have to admit that I didn't make the recipe exactly per the directions.  In fact, I already had a basic recipe that I use but was looking to improve it and this recipe really gave me the basis for a "high five" roast from my family.  Like others, I added some garlic powder and some onion powder to the flour.  I didn't use 1/4 cup of butter - that seemed like way too much so I cut it back by about two tablespoons.  I used the same pot that I seared the roast in to roast it in the oven.  I did use white cooking wine rather than vermouth and then this is where my changes really happened.  Instead of the cream of mushroom soup I used golden mushroom soup.  And then instead of dry onion soup mix I used a can of French onion soup.  I baked it at 250 degrees for about 5 hours and I've never received so many compliments from my family on a dinner before.  I think I know what we'll be having on Sundays from now on....

I read the reviews & made some changes based on what I read.  The roast turned out moist & so flavorful.  Last night, it became my favorite pot roast recipe!!!!  Here's the changes:  add 1 tsp of Emeril's creole seasoning to the flour; cut the butter to 2 T & added 2 T of EVOO to decrease the chance of burning; used 1 full envelope of non-sodium dry onion soup mix (I make a copycat recipe); tossed in 4 leftover sprigs of fresh thyme; doubled the cans of soup & didn't have vermouth so I used cabernet.  Finally thickened the gravy w/ 2 T of room temp butter & 2 T of flour mashed together ..instant thickening & a lovely glaze to the gravy.

This is a method to make a less tender cut of beef (such as a chuck roast) more tender by slow braising (cooking in liquid).  The roast is not supposed to be rare or even medium. All that said - this is a very good recipe for pot roast, one of the best I've had.  Follow it and you will have a yummy roast - I recommend adding quartered potatoes and carrots during the last 30 minutes of cooking. For rare or medium rare roast beef follow a recipe for roast beef and use a good cut of meat with plenty of marbling.

Phenomenal! I was trying to figure out how to salvage a roast that I forgot to put in the slow cooker this morning. I came across this recipe and made it using a 2.5 pound chuck roast. I didn't have vermouth but I had good ol' box white wine in the fridge so I used a little over 1/2 cup. I put this in the oven at 350 degrees for two hours in my enameled cast iron pot with the lid (Martha Stewart) and it is mouthwatering! Divine!

Classic recipe that has stood the test of time over a few decades.  I fondly remember my son, when he was a little boy, loving the aroma of this as he walked in the door after school. This was one of his favorite meals. He's 29 now and makes this for himself! I use dry white wine instead of vermouth and generally make it easy on myself and use the slow cooker.

Made this tonight and everyone loved it. I had a 4 1/2 pound roast so I used a 10oz can of cream of mushroom soup and as others did since I didn't have an onion soup packet used more seasonings. I used the vermouth and beef broth. Browned in bacon grease with red onions & cooked in dutch oven on 350 first hour then 325 for the remaining time. Served with mashed potatoes and toasted/buttered Italian bread. Didn't change much.
I put some of my potatoes and meat on top of bread. Yuuummmy!

This may be the most delicious thing I have ever put in my mouth! I had a 7 bone roast (which WAS too fatty but worked fine), added seasoned salt and garlic powder (per previous reviews), deglazed the pan with white wine, tossed the whole thing in the oven and came back 3 hours later to the tenderest, most flavorful pot roast I have ever eaten....much less cooked myself! Thank you! This is going to become a regular at our house.

Always a hit!  Try golden mushroom soup instead of cream of mushroom for a beautiful and yummy gravy!

I have never been a big pot roast fan until NOW!  We had this last night for dinner, I used beef broth instead of vemouth and this was by far the best pot roast we ever had.  I added the potatoes and carrots the last hour of cooking.  Thank you for what I am sure will be a new family favorite!

I prepared this for Sunday dinner yesterday and the reviews were rave! I used a bottom round tip roast and followed the directions exactly. I wasn't so sure about the mushroom soup at first, but it was delicious! I baked mine in a Le Creuset-type (enamel coated cast iron) dutch oven and added a bag of peeled carrots for the last hour. My kids even had seconds and didn't complain that the roast was "dry" as they usually do. Highly recommended!

Pretty good recipe. Definitely will make again. I did make some substitutions/changes. I used a tri-tip sirloin roast. About the same weight as what is called for in the recipe. A little less butter than what is called for. Just enough to not burn in the pan. Fat Free cream of mushroom soup, added 2 bay leaves, mushrooms, pearl onions, carrots, green beans and minced garlic. Seasoned meat with an organic seasoned salt with no added msg. I mmixed that seasoning in with the flour when I browned the roast. Substituted white wine instead of vermouth since I didn't have any. I put it in the dutch oven, 325 degrees for 3 hours. Put over rice and ate, and ate, and ate. DELICIOUS

This is fantastic. I usually buy cheaper cuts of meat to save money. This turned my sometimes pretty tough roast very juicy and tender. I used beef stock in place of the wine or vermouth as I had none and it turned out awesome. Even my somewhat picky 4 year old ate all his. I added potatoes, carrots and onions for the last hour or so. Yum. Will make this again and try it with white wine. :) Thanks.

This was really, really good.  The flour on the meat made perfectly thickened juice.  I doubled it and it was terrific.

I microwaved potatoes, carrots, and onion until just tender, then added them to the pot during the last hour or so.  I also added a bit more liquid (I used  chicken broth) when I added the veggies since I knew they would absorb quite a bit of the gravy.

This is very good! I skipped the butter and seared the roast in olive oil. I also seared the carrots and onions with 3 smashed cloves of garlic. I placed them on top of the roast and they werent mushy at all. I used vermouth, a whole packet of Onion Soup mix, low-sodium Cr. of Mushroom soup and a can of Campbells Beef Consumme. I am going to skip the flour next time because the gravy was a little too thick for my liking, but it was very tasty. I used my Cuisinart enamel cast-iron dutch oven and it was so tender in under 3 hours. Very good!

My roast turned out very tender and flavorful.  The gravy was great for mashed potatoes.  I didn't have any vermouth or white wine so I just added water instead and it was fine.

Oh SO delicious!  I've been making pot roast for years, but had never used cream of mushroom soup before.  This recipe caught my eye, and wow, I'm so glad I tried it.  The cream of mushroom soup thickened the gravy and geve it a wonderful richness.  I don't think I will now ever make pot roast again without the mushroom soup!

I'm sure the recipe would be wonderful as written, but since I'd already bought vegetables and red wine which I'd planned to use before I discovered this recipe, I modified the recipe slightly as follows:

1) I seasoned the chuck roast with salt, pepper and garlic powder
2) I dredged the meat in flour.
3) I seared the meat over medium high heat in my dutch oven.
4) I took the meat out, and then browned a bunch of large chopped carrots, onions, celery and red potatoes.
5) I deglazed the pan with about 1/2 cup of red wine.
6) then I whisked in the can of mushroom soup, the packet of onion soup, and about 2 cups of beef broth, and stirred it until the sauce was smooth.  I tossed in a few rosemary sprigs and a few bay leaves.
7) Put the meat and the vegetable back in the pot.
8) I cooked this about 1 hour at 325, and then lowered the heat to 250 and cooked for another 4 hours or so.

Yum yum yum!

I have used the onion soup/mushroom soup idea for years, but never thought of substituting dry vermouth for some/all of the water or stock. Brilliant idea! I also add fresh mushrooms, a bay leaf, and a splash of Worcestershire sauce, sometimes some thyme. Practically any additions work. This recipe works especially well with brisket rather than a rump (which I think are too lean and therefore often dry.)

I am not a few good cook but this recipe was easy and DELICIOUS! I give this one 5 stars. Husband said it was the best thing I have ever made. I did add a few things. I sprinkled garlic powder with the flour and substuited beef broth for the wine. I also deglazed the pan with beef broth. I added a few carrots and potatoes the last hour of cooking. The gravy was nice and thick not to mention TASTY!

The BEST Pot Roast I've ever tasted!!! I can't believe how easy and GOOD this recipe is. I will never use a crockpot to cook a roast again.

I made just a couple modifications to the recipe. I didn't use white wine or vermouth. I used 1/2 cup of water instead. I also used mushroom & onion dry soup mix. 

Unbelievable flavor!!

Thanks so much for sharing:-))

I made a couple of small changes. I added a couple of shakes of garlic powder and onion powder to the flour mix and instead of the vermouth I used the beef cossume' someone else suggested. I added some gold potatoes and carrots at the last hour. 

This dish was awesome it made the best gravy I ever had with pot roast in the past. I would suggest some salt on the vegetables something I forgot to do. This dish is in my box and I will be making it again and again.

So far of the pot roast recipes I have tried here, this is hands down my favorite.  The meat came out super tender! P.S. I used a full envelope of the onion soup mix.

Awesome!!  I seared beef as directed then slow cooked on low for 7 hours.  I added a cup of beef broth to the mushroom soup and 1/2 cup of wine...also added thyme and fresh groud pepper before pouring over beef and potatoes.  Gravy was awesome!  Thickened it to desired consistency in sauce pan with Golden's Gravy Flour - beautiful!!!

I'm not having much luck lately with beef roasts!  This rump roast turned out so tough and unflavored!  3lb roast was done in 2 hours, but the red potato, carrot and onion chucks were still raw after 1+hr in the oven.  The gravy was pretty onion-y  but OK - I poured the gravy in to tupperware while hubby made a run for the border.

OK, but not so good that I'll make again. Too much flour, gravy too thick, not enough seasoning. Don't get me wrong, it's tasty. But nothing special.

Seriously the best pot roast I ever made. Hubby wanted to make sure that I saved this recipe.  Used white wine instead of vermouth and added beef broth.  The gravy was a bit thick so next time I may not dredge in flour.  Added potatoes, onion and carrots for the last hour of cooking. Wow...this one is a keeper!

WOW, great recipe.  I used someone elses suggestion of deglazing the pan with wine, and then mixed the soup in to combine, before pouring over the meat.  I used chuck roast and its is one of the best meals I ever made.

I've made this a few times and I love it. It's flavorful, and so easy. I do make a few changes, though, mostly in the interest in saving some calories. I don't coat the meat in flour or brown it in butter. I just put it right into a heavy duty pan, and place unpeeled red potato wedges, baby carrots, and onion wedges around the roast. Then I sprinkle some garlic powder on the roast, and then sprinkle the package of onion soup mix on top, (I use the whole thing) then pour 1 can of healthy request cream of mushroom soup over it. I don't cook with alcohol, so I substitute that with 1/2 of a soup can of water. I don't have a covered oven pan, so I just cover the whole thing with heavy duty aluminum foil, and bake it in the oven at 350 for 3 hours. This is good with both beef and pork. It's fast to put together, and always comes out great. Thanks.

FINALLY FOUND A GREAT & EASY POT ROAST RECIPE!! I have tried other pot roast recipes from The Food Network etc. but every time they were a disappointment -- or  way too involved. This roast is so moist. I had my 91 year-old grandmother over for dinner and served this; she loved it! She said it was simple, old-fashioned home cooking. I followed the recipe exactly then added some beef granuals. I put an entire bag of baby carrots in the dutch oven as well. Next time, I will add potatoes. This is so easy, and so moist - -lots of gravy left over for potatoes. Do yourself a favor and give it a try. You won't be disappointed!

It was wonderful!  I used an eye pot roast which I browned in margarine.  I added 1/2 cup beef broth to the original mixture and cooked in the oven for 1 3/4 hours.  Then I added 3 quartered new potatoes, a handful of peeled baby carrots and 1/2 lb. of sliced baby bella mushrooms.  Also added a little more beef broth and cooked for an additional hour at 325.
It sliced beautifully and was absolutely delicious.  My husband and I ate most of it!

Very Good! I did make a few changes though. I did the same as another reviewer, I put slivers of garlic in the roast all over before browning. I was also out of Vermouth but I did have some Riesling leftover from the holidays, so I used this instead. YUM! I think next time I'll be using the Riesling because it turned out so good! I used a one and half pound roast (two adults and two children under 5) but did not half the rest of the ingredients and the gravy was sooo delicious! It made plenty for us and then we had mashed potatoes and green beans for sides. My husband doesn't usually like roasts so this was definetly a keeper.

Yum - the gravy is wonderful! I used 2 cans of the low fat, reduced salt cream of mushroom soup and the reduced salt onion soup mix, with white wine instead of vermouth.  I also deglazed the stock pot used to brown the roast with white wine as recommended by another reviewer, straining out the bits (I was worried there would be some crunchy bits) before pouring over the roast.  My roast was just over 2 lbs, and I cooked it for 2 1/2 hours, adding halved red potatoes, baby carrots, pearl onions, and mushrooms in the last hour.  The potatoes needed an extra 10 minutes and the roast was a little dry.  Next time I'll cook for 2 hours.  Did I mention the gravy was great? Thanks for the recipe!

This was absolutely the best pot roast I have ever eaten!  I will never attempt a roast in the crockpot again! I used chuck roast.  Per other reviewers, I added garlic powder to flour coating.  The next time I will use less butter when browning meat.  I added a couple of celery stalks and bay leaves. Carrots were added the last hour.

This was great and the roast came out tender.  I used 1 envelope instead of 1/2 of the onion soup mix and added 4 mediums potatoes.  I didn't have vermouth so I used red wine instead and a dash of Worcestershire sauce.  The family gave me the thumbs up on this one!

OK, This was seriously amazing! The 'sauce' is what makes this pot roast stand apart from all the others I have made the last 20 years of my trial and error cooking adventures. the only thing I would do different the next time I  make this (and I will be making this again and again) is that I will triple the sauce. Aside from that, this was the best pot roast we have ever had and by far the best I have ever made. My hubby and kids (picky eaters, ages 14, 8 and 6) absolutely loved it and wanted more 'gravy' but we were scraping the bowl clean (read to mean 'LICKING' the plates, lol) I made no changes at all, aside from adding new potatoes, carrots and a sliced onion the last hour of cooking time. The only thing I will change for next time is that I will double or triple the sauce recipe. I will probably be coming up with different ways to add this sauce to other meat recipes. It tasted amazing over roasted potatoes.

So good.  Cook low and slow for a tender, fall apart roast.  I had a beef/pork combo roast and this worked great.  I didn't have vermouth and used vodka....yums.

This was good. The dry vermouth gave a nice sweetened taste and complemented the onion soup and COM.

4.5 stars this was really good, after reading other reviews, I did the following, coated the meat in a seasoned flour mix and browned it on all sides in a mixture of olive oil and butter sauteed onions, carrots and garlic, removed everything to pan, then deglazed pan with red wine, beef broth, added 1 pack of onion soup mix. Cover it all up put it in oven after 3 hours it was done and gravy was done, no need to thicken, really tasty.

Super easy recipe and great flavor. My husband said it was one of the best meals he's had in months. I followed the recipe pretty accurately, although added a little seasoned salt and garlic powder to the flour mixture like one reviewer recommended, and used white wine to deglaze the stock pot after browning (which I also used to roast it in). I used a bit more white wine in the soup mixture instead of vermouth. I added some diced carrots and button mushrooms to the pot an hour before serving and it was perfect. My 5 year old even ate it!

So good and easy - I browned roast in my dutch oven, deglazed with additional 1/2 c. vermouth, added gravy, covered it, and cooked for 2 hours, then added cut up potatoes, onions, and parsnips, and turned oven up to 350 for the last hour.  Next time I'll probably add the potatoes 1/2 hour earlier, because they were just done.  Gave my sister some leftovers and she asked for the recipe.

I followed the recipe pretty closely, but made a few changes.  Like others, I put some whole garlic cloves in to the meat before browning.  I used a can of cream of celery and a can of cream of mushroom (both low fat) soup and added the butter from browning to the soup mixture.  I then deglazed the pan with a little white wine and added that as well.  Used white wine instead of vermouth in the recipe.  I added a chopped red onion to the gravy before putting it into the oven.  After two hours of cooking I added carrots, portabella mushrooms, yellow and green squash, and potatoes, along with a cup or so of beef broth for a little extra gravy.  Probably cooked it for a total of 4 hours.  It was fantastic.  Thanks!

Update:  Didn't have butter so I seared the meat off in olive oil, then deglazed the pan with a little white wine. Used two cans  cream of chicken soup, white wine,  a little worschester,  and a bouillon cube.  Added a little garlic and a red onion. Best gravy ever.

WONDERFUL!! I added more wine (1cup) and 1/4c water to keep the gravy a little thinner. It's a family fave- we make it often. SO good w/potatoes!

This is absolutely the best ever pot roast. It has become our standard Christmas dinner and even my very picky son thinks it's a standout! Based on other suggestions, I added some salt free seasoning to the flour mix, deglazed the pan with 1/2 C red wine instead of vermouth and did not remove the meat while deglazing (I use a dutch oven that browns the meat on top of the stove and goes right into the oven for the remainder of the cooking). I added one can of low sodium fat free beef broth and one small chopped onion to the dry onion and cream of mushroom soup mixture that is poured over the roast for gravy. Definitely add some baby potatoes, or red potatoes cut up and baby carrots during the last hour of the three hour cooking time. I'd give more stars if I could, it is worth every single one. Thanks for sharing!

I used a 5 lb. roast and doubled the other ingredients to make more gravy.  Since some reviewers mentioned the thickness of the gravy, I added about 3/4 c. water, and it turned out perfectly.  I also substituted cream of chicken soup for the mushroom and added carrots and celery.  The meat took exactly 3 hours to cook, so I imagine a 3-1/2 lb roast would finish sooner.  Excellent recipe but very similar to the Pot Roast in Foil recipe on this site.  The latter is even simpler, so I will probably stick with it.

This was delicious. We had a 3.09lb eye round that we browned first in a pan. We then reduced the wine in the pan to get the drippings and we added extra wine. We then cooked at 325 for the first hour then changed to 375. Cooked for 30 minutes and added one cup of Beef broth and 4 potatos cut into quarters. Cooked for another hour. Took roast out, used drippings in bottom of pan to make gravy and then sliced the roast. Perfect. Could have probably taken it out 10-15 minutes earlier. Either way, well done, and I mean the recipe, not the meat!

This was fantastic! Thanks for the post! Will store in my keeper-box. The house smelled sensational...I used a 7-bone pot roast I found on sale, and made this. After sprinkling with flour, garlic salt, and smoked paprika, I seared it in a little olive oil. Then I sprinkled some balsamic vinegar, about 2 tbsp, over the roast, then spooned a little liquid smoke over it before adding the soup mixture. I was a little worried that all the bones would be hard to cut through, but they just lifted right out of the meat after it baked 3 hours. About 45 mins before it was done, I added a quartered onion all around the roast, along with as many mini-carrots as could fit(they're my favorite with roast meat). Served with mashed potatoes, and the gravy was wonderful over both meat and potatoes. Yummy-wonderful!

This is the best roast that I've ever had.  I doubled the recipe and put it in a dutch oven to cook.  I also put ground pepper and garlic powder right on the rump roast and then dredged it in flour before searing.  I added potatoes, carrots, and onions and poured the liquids over all of it.  Cooked it 3 1/2 hours at 340.  It was wonderful.

I had never made a pot roast until I tried this recipe.  It was so delicious, I ate my share at supper and then had to go back for a pre-bedtime snack!  I changed the recipe only slightly though.  I only had a 2 1/2 lbs roast which I cooked for 3 hours at 325.  I used the whole back of dried onion soup mix, because I didn't read the directions throughly.  And I used water instead of wine.  With those changes, it was excellent and I will definitely work this into my meal rotation!  (It was better than Grandma's.)

This was SO good!  I used 1envelope of dry beef onion soup mix instead, cream of chicken instead of mushroom(not a fan of mushrooms)put slits into roast and inserted fresh garlic, white wine rather than dry vermouth. A few dashes of worcestershire sauce.  Baked on 275 for 5 hrs. Came out fabulous!

Deeeeelicous!!  This was the BEST roast I've ever made. I added garlic powder and paprika to the flour and added an extra 1/4 vermouth.  I also inserted garlic cloves into the roast. I started the roast in the oven but had an emergency so after 45 min in the oven transferred to a crock pot.  Cooked it on low for 4 hrs.  Incredible!  Thank you.

Thank you for a very good and easy roast recipe.  I also used white wine instead of the vermouth.  I added new red potatoes, baby carrots and a large handful of pearl onions during the last 1 1/2 hours and they came out well done, but that's how we like them.  After reading about "not enough gravy" I increased the wine to 2/3 cup and added 1/2 soup can of water along with the whole package of Onion Soup Mix (easier then trying to figure out what 1/2 package means).  Everyone enjoyed and all went back for seconds.

Absolutely the best roast I have ever made!!!!  I used a Chuck Roast, and added veggies half way through cooking.  Everyone was raving about it!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Sometimes when you see "simple" recipe claims, they're a little too simple and not very flavorful-----BUT NOT THIS ONE!!!!  This was simple and simple DELICIOUS!!!  I didn't have the white wine so I add water instead. We had dinner guest coming (not always the greatest time to try a new recipe!) and they just ranted and raved about the meat!!  I served with homemade mashed potatoes and homemade yeast rolls.  Oh my goodness!!  They had to roll my husband away from the table!!!  Great, great recipe!!  Thanks Becky!

This recipe is a keeper!  I didn't know how to fix the rump roast in the freezer because they always seem to come out so dry.  I tried this recipe and it is great!  The meat was tender and very moist.  Everyone loved it -- even my 6 year old picky-eater.  Following some of the other reviews, I used the whole packet of onion soup mix and increased the dry vermouth to 3/4 cup.  I also added potatoes and carrots for the last hour of baking.  I will definitely make this again!

I"m not sure what to say about this pot roast.  Mine did not turn out well, but it may have been user error.  I followed the recipe.  My only change was to use a whole packet of onion soup mix.  Problem #1 (user error I'm sure) - My butter burned.  Usually I use oil to brown/sear meat before roasting.  At the temperature I usually sear my meat, my butter burned.  I had to cool my pan, wipe out the butter, and try again, but I still had enough burned butter that I had to wipe out the excess after I seared my meat.  Problem #2 - My meat was overcooked and dry.  I tried to follow other users instructions and add potatoes & carrots 1 hour before finishing.  I used a 3.5 lb roast as instructed at 325 for 3 hours.  At the 2 hour mark, I removed my dutch oven to add the veg and I used a probe thermometer to check my status.  It was already fully well done at 2 hours.  I added the veg anyway and put it back in, thinking maybe it would just braise and get tender in the last hour.  I did my veg for about 35 - 40 min until soft.  When I sliced my meat, it was tough and dry.  The gravy made it edible, but it was not like I expected.  Problem #3 - Not enough salt.  I thought that with the full OSM packet, I would have plenty of salt, but I had to season everything.  Possibly the veg soaked up some salt.  The gravy was good and homey, but nothing outstanding and not enough of it.  Overall a disappointment.  I will try again, though.

I thought it was delicious but I had to alter it a bit.  I found the roast was ready after 2 hours.  Also I had to double the gravy since there didn't seem to be enough for our family...but then again our family loves gravy.

This recipe is SO GOOD!  I have made it several times with wonderful results.  If you have time, let the whole thing sit in the fridge for 1-2 days before serving to let the flavors really meld together.  If you add hearty vegetables in the last hour of cooking, it is a complete meal in itself, but it is also fabulous served with rice or crusty bread.

I stumbled upon this recipe which is incredibly close to my mom's recipe I have been using for 30+ years. It is so quick and easy but the flavor covers that secret. The only difference in mine is that I use 1 can EACH of cream of celery and cream of mushroom soups, 1 full envelope of Lipton onion soup mix, 1 can of mushroom stems & pieces, and a couple of minced garlic cloves. I do pepper then brown the roast but have never done that in butter before so I might have to give that a try. I also don't dredge in flour or any seasonings anymore because I didn't find the flour added anything to the finished dish. Toss the potatoes and carrots in for the last hour of cooking (I prefer 275 degrees to improve tenderness) and it tastes like you have been slaving over this dish all day! I think I will also have to try adding white wine next time. Thanks for sharing this timeless fail-safe recipe!

Very good! thank you for the great recipe! :)
I had never made pot roast in the oven and i hoped it would turn out okay.. this was also my husband's first time having me make it... we usually stick with ground beef and chicken breasts, so a chage was due! Normally I'm used to tomatoes being added to pot roast, but this is a good tomato-less recipe. I'm sure that a can of stewed toms would be great if someone added them to this recipe. I also used garlic pieces on top of the roast, and garlic powder, and a bit of lawrys seasoning salt. Also, after browning off the meat in the pan, I deglazed with white zinfandel, then added the rest of the ingredients.. I entertained and everyone was very happy with it! (including the skeptical husband... :) ) I had a tiny 1.65lb and roasted for 4hrs @ 325... I need a crockpot like my Mom!

This is a very easy recipe.  I also added salt, pepper and seasoning salt to the flour mixture before browning the roast.  Instead of vermouth, I added a can of beef broth as well as a medium sliced onion.  We really enjoyed the roast and will make it again.  Next time, I will make a thicker gravy out of the drippings, the remainder was a bit thin.

Wonderful roast recipe. Oddly enough, I only had Cream of Chicken on hand and it turned out quite tasty (I know, right - guess chicken and beef can compliment each other...:) Like others, I added white wine vs the Vermouth. Will make again!

This was my first attempt at pot roast.  I dont know if doubling the gravy messed this up or not...but all in all we had to cook it 6 hours.  It turned out ok.  I got a 4 pound chuck roast.  I doubled the gravy recipe, added onion, mushroom, carrots and potatoes about an hour in...and the potatoes were not done after 4 hours.    This got eaten, it just wasnt amazing.

Excellent!  Everyone loves this when I make it.  I swapped out the vermouth and replaced it with white wine and it was great. I also switched the Cream of Mushroom soup to beef broth when my daughter is home since she is lactose intolerant.  Still tastes great.

I thought it was pretty good but honestly prefer crockpot better. The meat just wasn't as tender as I am used to. I usually do my roast in the crock with a can of mush soup and a packet of brown gravy. It is fall apart tender. I thought this gravy was pretty good too, and the picky fam all ate it.

Delicious and easy! As suggested by previous reviews, I substituted beef consomme for the vermouth/white wine & added potatoes and carrots the last hr.  The gravy is to-die-for and this meal is an excellent candidate for my weekly recipe rotation. (Leftovers make for a killer hoagie) sandwich)

Yummy!! Most of my family does not like mushrooms so instead i used 1 jar of gravy, and 1 can beef broth instead of the vermouth. Like some of the others I added veggies about 1hour before done. Turned out Excellent!

I usually don't make my roast in the oven unless I use a bag recipe. My husband loved this recipe, he raved for hours and then had seconds. My only changes were that I used 2 cans of Cream of mushroom soup, 3/4 cup white Port wine, 4 1/2 pound roast, 1 packet dry onion mix and seasoned the flour with garlic powder and season all season salt.

Wow this was AWESOME.  I accidentally used the lipton soup mix for Spinach Dip (oops) and it was still FABULOUS.  I added carrots/potatoes 1 hour from the end of cooking.

Great recipe!  I added garlic powder, paprika, and a little salt to the flour/pepper mixture (the flour is extremely important in this recipe).  I tried this before and used red wine rather than vermouth.... this time, I used vermouth.  Rather than oven roasting, I opted to put it in the slow cooker after searing (4 hours on high).  I placed sliced onions under and over the roast before pouring the soup mixture on top and after 3 hours, I added baby carrots); it gave the roast a really nice flavor. I think I like the "vermouth" version best!  Served with roasted potatoes.  YUM!

I LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!  i followed the direction of some of the other cooks and added more spice to the flour before dredging, and instead of using dry vermouth or white wine (i had neither on hand), i used half a bottle of beer, and IT MADE THE DISH SO DELICIOUS!!!!!!  i HIGHLY recommend!!

I used a 3.5 pound sirloin tip roast and cooked it for 3 hours. I like it a little pinker in the middle so I would probably do it in 2 and half next time. I also used beef consomme instead of vermouth,and it made the most wonderful gravy,not overly greasy.I made this fr six people,and they ate every last bite of it! Served it with Sour cream n' chive mashed potatoes(this site),green beans,carrots(which I added to the roasting pan for the last 45 min),and thick sliced sourdough bread.Fantastic!

My husband and teenage boys complimented me over and over about how delicious this was. My younger son wanted some for leftovers after school on Monday and told my husband not to eat it all. That's a first because he hates leftovers. They thought the meat was tender and they loved the gravy and potatoes.
I changed it a bit. I used a few shakes of garlic powder in the flour mixture and I browned the meat in a combination of olive oil and 1 TBL of butter. I also used 1/2 cup of savignon blance since that's what I had opened. An hour before serving, I added the carrots, onions, and baby potatoes and flipped the meat. It was a hit. Great for a cold night. This was a keeper!

Usually, I think its odd to rate a recipe if I have made adjustments, but thats not really the fault of the recipe giver, rather due to me having to make adjustments for things I dont have in my cupboards. HOWEVER, this came out so darn delicious, I am going ahead with it anyway. Okay, changes. I did not have vermouth, so I substituted cheap champagne, no onion mix so I chopped up three onions, love carrots and taters so cut them kinda big and put em in, turned oven to 200degrees and cooked over night. I woke up on my own at about 3am, got up briefly and MAN oh man the smells that greeted my nose when I walked through the hall. I was in olfactory heaven. So, I went to the kitchen and turned off the stove but left the roast in. I got up about 6:30, took it out and everything was perfect. Perfect gravy, perfect tender but not mushy potatoes and carrots, and melt in your mouth tender meat. Thank you whoever you are who had this awesome recipe!

This is the best pot roast ever ! My husband requests this once a week , and I happily oblige . The meat comes out sooo tender , and the gravy is delicious. The only thing I do differently is deglaze after browning with a little red wine , and I throw in some baby carrots and 2 sliced onions . We are a gravy loving family , so if you are too make sure to double the beef broth to one cup - this gravy is so good you'll want plenty of it ! My picky 5 year old always has a least 3 helpings of the meat , and my one year old LOVES it too .  I wouldn't mess with the original recipes cooking time too much , though . The three hours it calls for seems perfect to me , once I tried to mess with the time and it wasn't as tender .  I serve this with mashed potatoes and homemade bread ,and it's a home run every time - try this you won't be sorry - thanks for posting such a great recipe .

The word from my picky-eater sister:  "Outstanding!"  Not bad for my first ever pot roast!  I added garlic and thyme to the flour mixture, and red wine since I had no vermouth.  Added 2 tsp of Kitchen Bouquet to get a browner gravy.  Loved it.  I'll use the soup when I'm cooking for folks who like a little richer gravy.

This was by far the best tasting pot roast I've ever have. I didn't have vermouth so we used dry white wine.  We also added carrots, potatos, and some onion in the last hour. Everyone raved about how delicious it was.  I can't wait to make it again!

Absolutely perfect! It came out so tender we barely needed knives! I did a 4 lb sirloin roast for 2 1/2 hours in a dutch oven with a foil tent over it and it couldn't have come out any better! Just ever so pink in the middle, tender and juicy throughout! And the gravy... heaven! It was thin coming out of the oven of course, more like au jus, so I added 2 TBSP of flour and put it on the stove and stirred with a whisk non-stop until it was thickened and bubbly and it was perfect! This will be my only pot roast recipe from now on!

This recipe makes a tender delicious roast and a very nicely flavored gravy. It you toss in some carrots, potatoes and rutabaga during the last hour of cooking, you'll have a complete meal.Thanks for sharing.

This is the best roast I have ever made.  My husband LOVED it and doesn't want me to cook it any other way from now on.  I used the White Cooking Wine and it turned out perfect.  Like others, I sliced small cuts and placed garlic in the roast before browning.  I also added potatoes and carrots.  Was done after 2 hours in oven.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!!

My first pot roast.  The gravy was excellent, but three hours at that temp would be waaaay too long!  I pulled the roast out after one and a half hours and it was perfect.  Plus I feel the recipe is incomplete without adding classic veggies:  carrots, potatoes, onions.

i did not care for this recipe because the pot roast turned out dry (cooked too long at 3 hours) and there was a distinct smell of alcohol from too much vermouth (1/2 cup).

This was great!  Part way into the recipe, I realized I had no cream of mushroom soup, so I used Golden Mushroom soup; no vermouth, so I used Chardonnay.  I also added cut up potatoes, baby carrots, and a cut up onion in the last hour.  My husband LOVED this--he told me I could make it twice a week and he wouldn't tire of it.  
Will DEFINITELY make it again, and it's SOOOO easy!

This recipe was excellent and the smell of it cooking was unbelievable.  After baking for about 2 hours, I added red potatoes, carrots and parsnips and baked for 1 1/2 hours more.  I will absolutely make this again.

My husband swore he hated pot roast until he tried this dish.  I used the garlic soup mix instead of onion and added fresh onions before cooking.  He said he wants it more often.

Very good recipe.  The only complaint I had was I wasn't too thrilled with the cut of meat, but that's just me being picky.  Next time I will do it with a filet.  Also, I used a whole packet of onion soup mix because I didn't feel like figuring out what half was, and it did end up a little salty, but you could probably counter that with the low sodium mushroom soup.  Also, I was happy to have so much liquid in the pan so I could make gravy with it.  Then I strained the onions and mushrooms from the soup out of the gravy (for my husband's benefit) and it was really good.

This came out so delicious! I subbed chicken broth for the white wine. After an hour I added carrots and potatoes, and sprinkled some salt on them. At the end I put in the broiler for a couple of minutes. SO good! The meat was so tender, the veggies perfect. Great recipe!

Why do people insist on changing the recipe and then criticizing how it turned out?  Folks the least you can do is try it the way it is written the first time.  Personally I think this sounds like it would be great but since I roast my vegetables separately, I would not dream of critizing the original recipe as written.  Try it, you might just like it very much!!!

By far the best pot roast! I made a couple of changes: Used beef chuck instead of romp roast, didn't add the vermouth and doubled the onion dip and cream of mushroom because my family likes a lot of gravy. I also cooked it for 2.5 hours.

It's a good recipe--but I think  it's the wrong cut of meat.

 I use chuck roast instead.  Because chuck roast is inherently fattier (and has more interconnective tissue), it will yield a far more tender roast the longer it cooks. 

Rump roast lacks that interconnective tissue that the chuck has, therefore requiring more cooking time--and it may not be enough to make it as tender as the chuck roast turns out...

I was skeptical but had to give it a try based on all the reviews. So glad I did...this was simple to prepare and absolutely delicious. Not the sodium overload I thought it would be, and very flavorful.

I love this recipe however I always make this in a crockpot.  So nice for a weekday when busy or a Sunday dinner.  I follow the recipe but use the entire envelope of soup mix - no reason to waste it, right?  I use water most of the time instead of the vermouth - still just as good.  I add carrots and potatoes right at the beginning.  No need to brown the meat - one pot cooking!  Cook 8-9 hours on low.  I usually add a little bit of corn starch 10 minutes prior to serving to thicken the sauce.  YUM!  Very good to serve with egg noodles.

OMG This was delicious!  We seldom eat red meat, but my husband had a craving today so I picked up a 3 1/2 lb eye of round roast, well trimmed.  I messed up and didn't read the recipe closely and used red wine (Cabernet Sauvignon).  I browned the beef, adding a little garlic powder and season salt with the pepper to the flour, in my cast iron dutch oven, then deglazed with half the wine, put the roast back in and poured gravy over.  I used a beefy onion soup mix (whole package).  After an hour I added quartered potatoes.  The roast was perfectly cooked after 2 hours.  Did it fall apart like a crockpot roast?  No.  Did you actually need a knife to cut it?  Yes.  But it was not dry at all!  It was pretty too.  My husband laughs at the idea of "presentation" being important, and even he said that was a roast that would be just pretty on the table.  I probably should try it with white wine, just to be truer to the recipe, but I don't think I will because my husband said to be sure to give this recipe five stars.  He also wants me to double the gravy next time and put button mushrooms in as well.  I may try the idea of imbedding garlic slivers in the meat as well.  But whatever I do, I will make a roast in the dutch oven again.  Crockpots have their place and I make many good crockpot meals, but this roast was far superior to any I've ever made in a slow cooker.  Thanks Becky Smith, for this terrific recipe!

Made this yesterday with just a couple tweeks because of what I had on hand, but basic recipe.  It is amazing. It was a nice day so I had the doors open, I was mowing the lawn and about 1/3 of an acre away and could smell it cooking. A keeper for sure.  You should check it periodically because I did need to add liquid. I used beef broth to keep it from going dry. I added carrots and gold potatoes. I can't wait to make it again.

Just a reminder you have to tell your Dinner eaters that there is Mushroom soup in this  recipe. Mushrooms are an allergen for Many.

Made this last night and oh my gosh was it good!  Very tender and well flavored.  I'm not usually a fan of using canned soup but will make an exception in this case.  Can't wait for leftovers tonight.  Thank you.

I made this last night. My crockpot cracked after 10 years! It was the best roast I have ever made in the oven. Normally I have to use the crockpot because I dry them out in the oven. I made one change though I didn't use the packet of onion soup mix. I made my own with onion flakes, onion powder, a little organic better than bouillon beef base, garlic, parsley, and fresh ground pepper. The bouillon has a lot of sodium but you can control it by how much you use. I added a mushroom soup box to the mix which made a thick paste.  Then I added red wine to the roast to deglaze and water to my spice mix to get the texture I wanted. Outstanding! I also added red potatoes, carrots, and onions in the last hour. Steamed some green beans with garlic and olive oil. Done!

This was the first pot roast I'd ever made. The directions were easy to follow and the taste was flavorful. I did take the advice of some of the others. I added a garlic seasoning to the flour mix, as well as some seasoning salt. I also added carrots, potatoes and onions. The sauce didn't thicken into a gravy, but it was still useable to pour over the meat, before I served it. All in all, it was a good recipe and I plan on making it again.

My 2nd attempt, I used chuck roast, a whole envelope of onion soup mix, cream of celery soup instead of cream of mushroom, and water for the vermouth (had no wine). I also rubbed garlic powder, seasoned salt, and pepper on the beef before dredging it in flour in a plastic bag. About 1-1/2 hours in, I added a medium onion cut in 1/8ths, 1-1/2 lb baby carrots, and 1-1/2 pounds fingerling potatoes. Had to cook a bit longer due to adding veggies, but it was delicious.

This is a great recipe!! I do have my own modifications to this however.....instead of butter I use olive oil to brown the meat.  Also, to the meat before browning I add fresh minced galic, basil, oregano, onion powder and also a little garlic powder.  While browning the meat your house will smell amazing and it adds great flavor to the dish.  After the meat has browned, I lift up the meat and deglaze the pan with red wine to get all the extra "GOOD STUFF" off the bottom and put the roast back in the pan.  I also use red wine in place of the vermouth. Last thing....my son hates beef unless it is hamburger because it is too hard to chew.  I cooked this at 315 for 4 1/2 hours and the beef comes out SSSOOO tender it just melts in your mouth and my son loves it.  Side note...at the 3 1/2 hour mark, I pull it out of the oven and add all the veggies and potatoes and a little water if the incorporate it.  Put it back in to cook for the last hour.  Veggie come out perfect and not too mushy.  Thank you for the great base recipe.

This was delicious.  I cooked it in a slow oven for 5 hours.  I ommitted the vermouth and used beef stock.  Also added garlic to the flour mixture. Served it with potatoe pancakes for a Chanukah meal. Evryuone loved it. .

I will give this five stars. My family thought this roast was very tasty. I used about a 3 pound boneless chuck roast. The meat just melted in your mouth like butter. I made mashed potatoes with my meal. Thanks for sharing it was a delicious meal.

My family loved this.  I used the basic premise and changed it to make it gluten free.  1) I used Gluten Free all purpose flour  2) replaced onion soup mix with 2 packages of sodium free beef boullion  3) added 3 tablespoons of dried onion flakes  4) added 1/4 tsp dry mustard, 1 tbl of crushed garlic, 1/4 tsp of paprika, 1 tbl of dried parsley (all to cover for seasonings that would have been in onion soup mix)  5) replaced condensced cream of mushroom soup with gluten free cream of mushroom soup (not condensced)  6) replaced white wine with 1/4 cp red cooking wine, (reduced amount of wine as the soup is not condensced)  and I used salt free butter.  This was phenomenal.. the 'sauce' was excellent and my family LOVED it.  Never know it was gluten free... really really delicious.

Good recipe, but the vermouth left a rather bad aftertaste and an unpleasant aroma when combined with the onion and mushroom soup.  I may try it again with a red cooking wine.  My roast using this recipe came out very tender using a 2 pound bottom round.  Cooked it only 2 hours (I would add a note for reduced cooking time with smaller cuts).  Added carrots and small white potatoes.

This was great.  I didn't have cream of mushroom soup so I substituted cream of chicken and it turned out fabulous.  We were fighting over the gravy.  Also, I did not have wine so I used beef broth.  Super yummy.

Four stars because it did not have that WOW factor.  I reserve the five stars for recipes that I would recommend for an impressive dinner date with the girl or guy you really want to hook for life.  Could not find anything wrong with this recipe after preparation.  The flavor was great, the roast was tender enough to cut with a fork--yet firm enough to slice without it falling apart, the gravy it made was very tasty.  I've never cooked a roast without adding some veggies.  I added carrots and potatoes about an hour and a half after first placing the roast in the oven.  My wife makes a roast in the crock-pot that is similar and always turns out great.  This recipe takes a few more minutes to prepare, but cooks perfectly in about half the time.  This one is a keeper.

This was so good!!!! I didn't use Cream of Mushroom soup but I did use 1 can beef broth.  I also cooked it in my crock pot, but did everything else the same.  I like that it called for Vermouth because that's what I had, and it it turned out great! I also think the flour on the roast helped make the juice / gravy thicker when in the crock pot, which was very helpful.

The best roast recipe I've ever tried and will be my new "go to" recipe... no need to look any further! I made minor changes. I used one can of golden mushroom soup, one can of beef consomme and 1/2 pkg onion soup mix and omitted the wine. I added potatoes, carrots and onions the last hour. The gravy was amazing and saved so much work because it was right in the pan. You must try this one!

Five stars for the wonderful aromas  coming from my kitchen!  I haven't tried it yet, but something that smells this good can't be bad!  Can't wait for supper!
Edited to add:  OMG - there was nothing left after dinner....most excellent!  I served with mashed garlic potatoes - this gravy is awesome!

Delicious!  Added potatoes, carrots, and celery. We also didnt have any vermouth, so we substituted sherry and a little red wine. Perfect meal for when you have cleaning around the house to do.  Put it in and forget about it until its done.

What a pot roast! However, I did change three things. First, I added grandulated garlic to the flour mixture as well as sea salt. Secondly, I used a whole packet of onion soup mix. And lastly, I did not have dry vermouth or white wine - so I took a chance and used white zinfadel and the sauce was wonderful. My husband & son whom really don't like pot roast absolutely loved it!! Will definitely make this again but will try with the vermouth.

wow this was simply awesome.  Like others I did add garlic to the flour mixture as well as some salt.  I also put at the bottom of the roaster that I used some celery, carrots and onions to give the gravy another dimention of flavour.

OMG!  I don't cook. I love pot roast. My hubby, not so much. I made this recipe in my Dutch oven that I've never used. I just traded the vermouth for beef stock. The roast was beyond juicy and the best gravy, ever. The last hour I added a bag of little carrots and one sliced onion. I put some meat and onions on a soft roll and dipped it in the gravy. Heaven. And, so did my pot roast hating hubby. Make this recipe today!

i followed original recipe.  I cooked meat for 1 hour in Dutch Oven, then added the veggies.  The meat was falling apart and veggies were slightly browned.  Delicious!! Family could not wait for dinner.

LOVED this recipe!  Even my pickiest 8yr old thought it was the best supper ever!!
The only thing I changed was that I put in a can of french onion soup instead of the onion soup mix.
The gravy was incredible!

I made this for family on a harvest family weekend at my house in October.  It was by far the best pot roast everyone has ever tasted.  I cooked mine in the crock pot.  I cooked it on High for 2 hours and low for about 4.5 hours.  I also added about 1 cup of vermouth instead of just the 1/2 cup the recipe calls for.  Absolutely delicious and my whole family agreed!

This was an easy, basic recipe.  I made it in the pressure cooker, and substituted cooking wine for the vermouth.  We all thought it was way too bland, but then, we prefer very flavorful foods.  When I reheated the leftovers, I added about 2 Tbs. Montreal steak seasoning.  That got rave reviews from the whole family.

I have tried scads of recipes for pot roast and fought wrapping it to keep it warm while I made gravy ... etc ... but this one is GREAT.  I followed the ingredients and only added 1T olive oil to raise the burning temp for the butter. Added the peeled, halved potatoes and carrots last 1/2 hour.  Thanks Becky.

Excellent! Did not have vermouth, used beef broth-actually a boullion cube dissolved in 1-1/2 cup water.  Seasoned with pepper and garlic powder. Also added carrots, onion wedges and mushrooms after two hours.  Then added flour when done to thicken gravy.  Very flavorful.  Served with mashed potatoes and spinach.

Great recipe! This is one of the best I've tried.  I only made a few small changes: -Added a little bit of garlic powder to the flour/pepper mix -Cooked for 5 hrs at 275 degrees -Added onions and a few whole garlics to the sauce for the last 2 hrs  This one is definately a keeper!

Two people almost ate the entire roast. I followed suggestions from other reviews and added spices to the flour. Threw the browned roast into the oven with water and the mushroom soup, plus fresh garlic. At hour 1.5, I added potatoes and carrots. Delicious!

Fantastic! Didn't use flour when browning, or onion soup mix in the oven... but did use mushroom soup, a few splashes of worchestershire sauce, and about 1/4 cup rose. Delicious!

YUM! YUM!  I typically cook my roast in the crockpot, but, what a HUGE difference in the oven.  I used a chuck roast instead of a rump roast.  After browning the roast I deglazed the pan with about 1/2 cup of red wine (instead of vermouth).  I then poured the mushroom soup/onion soup mix on top and covered in sliced onions.  I had about a 4-1/2 lb roast and it took exactly 3 hours.  Wonderful flavor and a thick dark brown gravy!  The roast was fall apart, but, stayed tender and moist. Definitely try this one!

This roast was outstanding.  The gravy was perfect right out of the pan.  I much prefer the flavor of this over a roast prepared in a slow cooker.  The only change I made was to use beef broth instead of vermoth, and that was only because that was what I had on hand.  I would highly recommend this recipe.

Excellent, tender pot roast. I seared it before cooking in the Dutch oven. Next time I will add more liquid, there wasn't quite enough gravy. Delicious.

I made this recipe with a few of the modifications in the reviews, and it was  unbelievably delicious. I used the whole envelope of soup mix.  I put slits in the roast and shoved garlic in them.  After browning the roast, I removed it from the pan, sauteed 1 sliced onion, and then deglazed the pan with 1/4 cup wine.  I also added a bit of extra water.  I lowered the heat to 250 and cooked it for 5 hours.  I added 3 carrots cut into matchsticks and cut-up baby potatoes at about 3.5 hours.  I am sure it would have still been awesome without these changes, but the little bit of extra effort is well worth it.

OMG this is soooooo good! I make it just like the recipe says and roast it in my 8 quart electric roaster. My family was never big on roast beef until this recipe. Thanks!

This roast was very good! I did ,however, substitute Beefy Onion soup mix and golden mushroom soup in the recipe because that's what I had on hand and used water in place of the Vermouth. My husband is very particular when I try recipes and I normally wait for his pros and cons of the recipe but he thought it was good and ate seconds!

This pot roast was so tender and juicy!  I used a red Cabernet wine instead of Vermouth and added carrots, celery and onions after 2 hours of cooking time.  The gravy was rich and non-fatty so I could serve it as is to my family and they loved it.  I will surely make this again.

Wow, this was great!  Did make a few changes though.  Used a red zinfindel (all I had at home) and cream of celery.  Put the potatoes and carrots in about 1 hour before serving and they all turned out fabulous.  No need to make gravy as the drippings and soup mixed well and had a great consistency.  Will absolutly try this again.

I have made this many times.  It is always great.  I double the sauce and have used red wine.  Red give it a little richer flavor.  Always great

Do not think you are going to get the super tender pot roast you get from using a crock pot. I made this for a birthday dinner and wasn't expecting that everyone would need knives. Dumped the leftovers in the crockpot the next morning on low - hours later the meat was way more tender and the sauce had simmered down to the nice gravy I had hoped for the day before. I'll repeat the mixture but next time I'll skip the oven and go for the crockpot instead.

I cooked this in the crockpot.  Followed recipe, but replaced vermouth with 2 cans beef broth.  WE LIKE A LOT OF GRAVY!  I added potatoes, carrots, 1 large sliced onion and cooked for 4 hours on high and then turned to low for 3 hours more.  Served with rolls.   Very good! Oh, also put in 2 tbsp red wine vinegar and also added seasoned salt and garlic powder to flour mixture.  And used an entire 1 oz pkg dry onion soup.

EXCELLENT ! I cooked at high for 7 hours in our crock pot and used white wine instead of vermouth. I also added alittle bit more of everything. About two hours before it was done - I added carrots and small red potatoes. Meat was so tender and the gravy was awesome !

Excellent pot roast with almost no effort!  I didn't really believe that it would make "gravy" while cooking but it did!  My gravy loving husband even liked it.  My only change was that I substituted red wine for the vermouth, as it was all I had, and I added root veggies in the last hour of cooking.  My 3 year old even ate it.

To make for easier clean up, I browned my roast in an oven safe pan, and just transfered it to the oven.  If your pans have "stay cool" handles that can't go into the oven, wrap the handle with aluminum foil, and it'll be fine.  I do it all the time.  Cove the pan with the foil instad of the lid to keep the meat and gravy moist.

Thanks for sharing this great meal!

We loved this recipe! I did change a few things though. I doubled the liquids and threw in baby carrots, butternut squash chunks, potatos and mayan sweet onions. Very moist and yummy.

Very very good! I screwed up & bought sweet vermouth instead. My roast was smaller, but to me there wasn't enough gravy. But since I'm watching carbs again, it works. For those who want more gravy, I advise doubling those ingredients.

Excellent! I did this roast per instructions and it turned out moist and   the gravy was the home run. After inviting some friends over to try it, I was cleaned out. I tried it next in the crock pot for  7 hours on low. I liked the crock pot better, but slow cooking a roast is my favorite way. Stove top was succulent though!

Just tried this and, believe me, I will be making this recipe again!! Real comfort food.
I prepared veggies separately on the stovetop and kept them warm while the meat roasted. I used potatoes, carrots, parnsips, rutabaga, onion and zucchini. When the meat was done, I removed the roast to a covered dish to keep it warm, then put the veggies into the roasting liquid until they were tender.  Very hard to know when to stop eating.....

This is terrific! We don't like cream of mushroom soup, so I used a can of cream of celery, some beef broth, L&P Worcestershire, and the dry onion soup mix. Added in carrots, several quartered potato, and one large onion cut into chunks. Roast was moist and the gravy was decicious! Even the kids ate the veggies (and that never happens!) - Thanks for this one, it's a keeper!

This was amazing! I didn't have cream of mushroom soup, only cream of celery soup, but it was delicious. Also, I used the whole packet of onion soup mix, and I think I would do that again. I didnt' have any vermouth, but I did have some white wine I used, with excellent results. My whole family loved it, and I also made some gravy with the juices in the pan. I will definitely use this from now on!

I have tried cooking pot roasts for years in slow cookers and they always came out too dry. This was AMAZING. I doubled the recipe for the gravy - used 2 cans of cr. of mushroom, omitted the onion soup (we have a family member allergic to onions), used 3/4 c. of marsala wine and 1 c. beef broth. I cut 2 cloves of garlic in half and poked in holes with Rosemary. I did as some suggested and added 1 tsp. paprika, garlic powder, 1/2 tsp. salt and pepper to flour. Browned meat and cooked 3 lb. roast 325 degrees for 2 1/2 hrs. My family RAVED! We had red potatoes and carrots (used butter, beef broth & rosemary and simmered for an hour). THis was super. My hubby and I love mushrooms so I sauteed some in marsala, garlic powder, butter, and dash of Worcestshire..... we added on top of ours with gravy. This is a winner!

The meat had a great flavor when it was done!  We didn't think there was enough "gravy" so I would probably double up on the sauce you put over the meat next time to try to get more, but it sure did have a good flavor too!  This one's a keeper!

This was wonderful! I didn't change a thing. It looks kinda complicated to the begginer, but it's actually pretty easy and it is so good! I added potatoes, carrots and onions for the last 45 minutes.

After years of cooking our pot roast on the stove top or in slow cooker, I was able to be home all one day so I cooked it in the oven as this recipe says.  OMIGOSH!!!The house smelled like pot roast heaven. My husband's nose was twitching when he came in from work,"What's for dinner that smells so good?" Don't know why, but cooking in the oven gave off aroma much more than slow cooker or stove top!  Guess our mom's and grandmom's did know what they were doing!!

This was fantastic!  I used 2 cans of low sodium soup and added a little minced garlic.  It was a huge hit with my husband and his parents.  Also, it only took approximately 2 hours to cook -- it was super tender!  I used a cross rib chuck roast.

I have attempted a few pot roasts in the last few years without much luck.  This one was excellent!!  I used a chuck roast and red wine in place of the vermouth.  This is better than any roast I have ever made in the crockpot or oven.  My whole family said it was great.  Thanks for the easy and delicious recipe.

My family loved this roast.  After 20 years my husband said this was the best one yet.  I substituted apple juice for the vermouth and used the whole package of onion soup.

The whole family loved it.  I used a 3.5 lb pork loin roast instead of beef, and white wine instead of vermouth, added a can of cannellini beans and about a cup of fresh mushrooms.  Yummy.  Will definitely try it again with beef.

I've used a variation of this recipe in the past.  Instead of vermouth, I've used water, which has always been a hit.  Tonight I added 1/2 cup of brandy (no vermouth in the house) and a full packet of onion soup mix.  Everyone LOVED it, even my finicky kids.  Thanks!

FANTASTIC!!!! I doubled the sauce part and put some carrots, shallots,and a couple stalks of celery around the roast before pouring the sauce over.  I used a covered roasting pan  - baked for 3 hours - then cut the roast in half - so that it would be completely submerged in the gravy - then covered and baked for another hour.

This recipe was delicious. I used 1 and a half lbs of 7 Bone Pot Roast, and the entire envelope of onion soup mix and the entire can of cream of mushroom soup. I also threw in 3 medium garlic cloves for extra flavor and during the last hour of cooking, I added sliced carrots and quartered potatoes. However, there still wasn't enough sauce for my taste.  The next time, I'll make this dish in advance, refrigerate over night, skim off the fat and use the sauce as a base adding more chicken stock and or water and flour to thicken. Also, the salt level was just right.  This was one of the best pot roasts I've made to date.

I live in a condo and my neighbor knocked on my door to ask, "What's cooking? It smells delish!" Not only did this recipe smell and taste great, but it was easy to make -- my kind of dish. I like recipes with few ingredients and not a lot of measuring to do. This one was just that. Plus, my boyfriend went to work yesterday with leftovers, something he never does. Tastes great the next day!

This is so good ~ I recommend using a meat thermometer as it was done before 3 hours and all ovens vary. I added the whole package of dry onion soup and whole can of beef Consommé instead of vermouth, makes great gravy to put over everything you put into the pot.

Excellent recipe! Like other users, I added my veggies in the last hour of cooking, and I also added a cup of beef broth with a little flour to make more gravy.

First time using one of these mushroom soup recipes and the end result was very good. Followed directions accordingly, but I did brown the meat with some crushed garlic about 2 cloves. Also used a dry sherry to deglaze pot before adding mushroom/onion mixture. I did not use the vermouth at all. No need to add salt, the onion package brings plenty. Also poured in one can of beef consommé. I felt some of the beef was very tender and some was a bit tough. I might try lowering the temp and adding time next time. Also added some carrots to pot and served over mashed potatoes.

We loved this!  I did not use butter, I used olive oil but only because my butter supply is low.  I used vermouth - gave the gravy a lovely flavor.  I threw some red potatoes into the pot with the roast and also I quartered some mushrooms and threw in.  The gravy is fantastic!  I'll make this again!

AMAZING!!!!  I made this with vermouth - a lot of people who reviewed here had used wine.  The vermouth made the flavor and aroma so rich, and there is no alcohol taste.  Just yumminess.  I doubled the gravy and added in chunks of carrots, potatoes, celery and onion about halfway through.  The gravy MAKES. ITSELF.  Nothing to add.  My roast was a little dry but only because my guests arrived about an hour late.  I thought I made more than enough but this 3.5 pound roast was devoured by 6 people.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.

I have tried a lot of pot roast recipes and this recipe was absolutely delicious.  I didn't have dry onion soup mix so I used a half an envelope of Good Seasons Italian dressing mix.  I also added beef stock instead of vermouth.  I added red potatoes and baby carrots and cooked for 2 hours and it was perfect.  Very delicious and have plenty of leftovers for tomorrow!

I decided to try this recipe because it looked simple. Regretfully I didn't care for it at all. I agree with Susan's comment regarding rump roast as a curious selection of beef cut.  I will go back to my usual chuck roast, as well as fresh carrots, potatoes, onions and herbs instead of dried onion soup mix and canned condensed soup.  Yes it's easy.  But to me at least it is not Pot Roast.

Simple and amazing recipe,  I will never cook a roast in a crock pot again! I was out of the dry onion mix so substituted a pot roast seasoning mix & used dry brown gravy mix. I also added potatoes and carrots per request to the roast during the last hour of baking.  Making a second time today & doing 2 roasts because it was so good there was nothing left.

Outstanding!  I used golden mushroom soup instead of mushroom and red wine instead of the vermouth.  And I cooked it for 5 hours at 275, adding cut up potatoes and carrots the last two hours.  The gravy was thick and tasty and the meat was very tender!  Probably the best pot roast I've ever made!  Definitely a keeper!

Easiest, tender and tasty recipe for Pot Roast.  I use the onion soup mix recipe from mamakittyto3 on this site.  My husband has celiac disease so I use gluten free all purpose flour, gluten free cream of mushroom soup mix and GF beef bouillion in the onion soup mix.    I sub either chardonnay or dry sherry for the vermouth and as others have noted, I usually throw in an extra 1/2 cup along with another tsp. of beef bouillion or an extra 1/2 cup of  beef stock if I have it on hand.  I also add celery, carrots, onion and potatoes immediately and have had no consistency problem.  I've done it a 325 for 3 hours or 275 for 5 hours and don't notice a difference.  A nice gravy results and it's always been a big hit at our house.

Exactly how pot roast should taste! Used beef broth instead of vermouth and recipe came out fabulously! This is a keeper. Thank you for taking the time to share!!!!

Well this was fantastic.  Mine was done in 2.5 hours, but I used chuck roast.  I took one reviewers suggestion and added onions.  Because my kids don't like chunky gravy, I used the immersion blender (because of the onions) it and made a delicious gravy.  Yummmmmm.

Made pretty much according to recipe but for using cream of celery and added penzeys roast beef seasonings. Also added the vegetables the last hour. It was excellent. Great easy meal for a rainy weekend when I have time to cook all day.

I loved this recipe.  I am new cook.  It was easy to follow.  I used wine and I cooked it in a slow cooker on a high setting.

This is now my go to recipe for pot roast. I brown it as directed but use 1/2 olive oil and 1/2 butter in my Le Crueset Dutch oven and add fresh onion slices and carrots for the last 45 min. I roast at 275 - 300 degrees maximum for about 3 hours. Serve it with whipped mash potatoes and a green vegetable.  Leftovers are delicious over egg noodles, almost like a boeuf bourginon.

I fixed this last evening in my new cast iron dutch oven and I was impressed with the pot roast and with my new oven. I made this without changes but I did add my vegetables the last hour in the oven.  It makes wonderful gravy and the roast was excellent.

1) to me it wouldn't be a pot roast without taters and carrots, so added them about two hours into the baking and they turned out fine.

2) Used a hunk o' meat labelled simply "pot roast" without any indication of its lineage (be it rump roast, chuck, etc.) and it turned out tough and gristly.  Not the recipe's fault, but next time I'll be more careful on what cut of meat goes into the roaster.

3) I'd definitely double the sauce.  Most of what was there evaporated away within the hour. Plus both my husband and I are gravy-holics.

I have been making Pot Roast for years…always the same way with beef broth and red wine in the crock pot. I tried this recipe and it was to die for! I did not have and do not care for vermouth so I added 1/2 cup of red wine to the soups and a touch of Thyme. I also added carrots onions and potatoes. The flavor was excellent and the meat fell apart.  I highly recommend this recipe!! I think I'm going to change my ways! ??

I made this the other night, and only used beef consomme because I didn't have vermouth. Everything else I followed to the letter, and it was delish!!  My family said this is one that they want on the rotation.

I cooked it for only 2.5 hour and it was perfect! The hardest thing about cooking a delicious pot roast is the timing and so I'm glad I got that down. Otherwise the seasoning was spot-on for some excellent gravy!!! I did substitute beef broth for the vermouth and I skipped the butter and just did a once around with the olive oil bottle. YUMMMMMMY!!!

Been making my beef & pork roasts this way for years. Only I don't brown them first and I roast them for four hours at 325 degrees for a 3 - 4 lb roast. I also use beef broth vs vermouth or wine, the onion soup mix and roasted garlic cream of mushroom soup for the beef roast and chicken broth, golden onion soup mix and cream of celery for the pork roast. The meat falls apart and is very tender & moist. The gravy is wonderful and you don't have to do a thing to it.

Used a 3lb chuck roast cooked 3 hrs. Used burgundy wine, my favorite for pot roasts and stew.  Rest of preparation was as stated in recipe. Roast was falling apart when I removed it from pot.  Had to leave so I removed roast from pan, threw in potatos, carrots & celery. Returned covered pot to oven but turned oven off.  Oh, I also added 2 cups of water to thin out soup mixture left in pot.  Returned home to perfectly cooked veggies. Haven't eatten it yet but sampled.  It was very tasty and can't wait to serve tomorrow night.

I am very happy that I tried this recipe. Spectacular! It was easy to make and the outcome superseded the effort it took to prepare it.  My chef friend-sister said to try it with red wine if I prepare it again to further enhance the flavor.  I used white wine because I was able to purchase a small bottle for $1.39 instead of a large bottle of vermouth for almost $6.00.  Oh yes, my husband loved it too.  He said he felt like overeating....but he restrained.  What's for lunch tomorrow...easy question to answer!  I had garlic mashed potatoes with carrots to accompany.  I bet parsnips would be great with this too.

Thanks for the great recipe! I used a 1.5 pound rump roast and cooked it for about an hour and 20 minutes. It came out perfectly. I used half the butter and subbed the difference with olive oil. After browning the meat I deglazed with the vermouth as others suggested. I still used all of the other ingredients w/ the full measurements so there was a perfect amount of gravy. Also added red potatoes and baby carrots for the last 35 minutes. Two thumbs up!

My daughter NEVER eats meat. EVER! She ate every bite of this without being coerced for forced! Delicious! I added carrots, celery, onions and a spoonful of minced garlic, as well as about a cup of chicken broth to cover the meat, as my dutch oven was way too large. It turned out beautifully!

Outstanding and super easy!  Based on personal taste and using items I had on hand, thus there were some substitutions.  I added dried parsley to the flour mixture.  The first big change was the onion soup mix.  Inspired by a previous reviewer who used aus jus mix, I used pork gravy mix.  My husband doesn't care for recipes with onion soup mix, I think the pork gravy mix is the best dry soup mix McCormick makes and it's what I had in the house.  Not wanting to lose flavor, I cut up a med to large onion and added it to the pot.  I subbed beef broth for the vermouth and added more than the recipe called for because of personal taste, probably a good 1 cup. I poured the wet mix on top of the beef, then added my peeled and cut potatoes and carrots.  The house smelled terrific the whole time cooking.  The taste is great, love the one pot dinner, it's easy and a crowd pleaser.  I'm looking forward to leftovers this weekend!!!

Excellent! However, I made a few changes based on what I had. White wine instead of vermouth. Secondly, DH does not like the onion soup mix so instead used a half envelope of McCormicks Au Jus gravy mix with a cup of water. I am usually not big on sauces or alot of gravy but this is one the tastiest!

this was amazing.  I am not much of a red meat eater but my boys wanted a roast.  I followed the cooking instructions exactly only substituting the vermouth with red wine and the meat fell apart when I sliced it and the gravy was delicious.  I will make again....this got rave reviews in my house

This is amazing. I make this every couple of months and there is never any left over. I make it exactly as directed and it comes out perfect every time. I keep dry vermouth on hand just for this recipe alone. It's a must in our household.

Loved this recipe!  Forgot to put the roast in the oven and had to be creative so I cooked it in a pressure cooker.  Increased the liquid to 1 cup white wine and 1/2 cup water and didn't dredge in flour.  I also added chunks of potatoes and carrots.  I let it cook for 20 minutes and cooled down the pressure cooker under running water, took out the veggies and turned it back on.  Total cooking time was 50 minutes.  I took the roast out and heated the liquid to boiling and added flour mixed with water and whisked well for a delicious gravy.  The flavor was amazing!  Next time I will cook it in the oven like the recipe calls for.

This was really good.  Thanks OP!  As with a majority of folks on this site, I made a few changes to suit my needs.  I did not use any flour to dredge the meat.  I did not use any butter and used canola oil instead.  I used chuck roast steaks instead of rump roast since that's what I had.  I used Chardonnay wine since that's what I had too. I wanted more sauce, so I added 1/2 cup of water and was suprised there was still a good flavor and did not get watered down.  I added creamer potatoes, mini red onions (think I'll omit those next time and add mushrooms), and baby carrots for convenience (no chopping!).  I cooked it on the stove top in a dutch oven instead of in the oven.  I've had pot roast when dining out and never liked it because the meat was more on the shredded side and I hate shredded meat.  I cooked this chuck steak just so it was tender but not quite falling apart and shredding.  It was tasty, filling, and hearty.

5 stars, except I followed some review advice. Used a can of dark beer instead of vermouth. Used beef broth but had no soup to use.Before flour coat I rubbed fresh garlic on meat. However the recipe helped me have the foundation for what to do! My first attempt!

Loved it!  Didn't have onion soup so I added some chopped onion and a little beef broth to the mushroom soup and wine mix.  I also added garlic powder to the flour like others had suggested, and I deglazed the skillet with a little broth and added that to the roasting pan.  One hour at 325, then 250 for an additional three hours. Added carrots, onions, and red potatoes about one-and-a-half hours in.  This turned out incredibly tender and delicious. The family loved it. Will definately make again!

I used this recipe for pot roast.  My family loved it.  Instead of onion soup mix I used an onion sliced and put in with the veggies.  Otherwise turned out great!

I used this recipe for Thanksgiving dinner (my first ever roast) and it was a hit!  Everyone was complimenting me and asking what I used.  Make sure you serve rolls with this to sop up all of the drippings!  It was a super easy recipe to follow,  the only change I made was I used one can of beef broth in place of the vermouth.  I also added red potatoes, carrots, and onions in about an hour before it was done.  Definitely recommend this to everyone!

Followed as written but I did notice I used the wrong can of cream soup when I was cleaning up.  It was cream of chicken not cream of mushroom.  No matter!  It was awesome.  Tasted exactly like Morton's Pot Roast that you can get at Costco.  This is definitely the only pot recipe I will use in the future.  Thank you!

Ok - this recipe is the best!  I risked everything and tried it for the hubby's birthday dinner.  He said I outdid myself!  It was truly the best pot roast I think I've ever had.  I accidentally used the whole package of the dry soup mix.  I used some sherry and beef consume instead of vermouth to deglazed the pan (roast in).  I heated the consume and then removed from heat and added a can of cream of celery and the dry soup mix.  Then poured this over the roast and one small cut up sweet onion.  Only other change was cooking the veges in for two hours at the end instead of one.  It was awesome!!!

Loved the taste!  The roast was delicious.  This meal was served to 7 of us ages 81 to 13.  Huge hit for all.  
This was easy to make ahead and bake later. I used white wine instead of vermouth.  
Fantastic!

Couldn't help but make this one after reading such great reviews.  Had the roast almost to serve when hubby comes home and says "oh, i thought you said you were making beef STEW?" No problem, cut the meat into chunks, and served over noodles.  EVERYONE (even the hardest to please) LOVED IT!  Did use a cheap white wine, and i would do it exactly the same next time.  Might have added extra garlic, as we are garlic lovers.

I skipped the black pepper & added garlic powder.  I used cooking sherry inplace of the vermouth.  When there was only 1.5 hour left of cooking time left I added chopped onion, potatoes & carrots and they cooked nicely in that amount of time with out becoming mushy.  The gravy that it makes turned out good even though it did not seem like enough but that was most likely because of all the extra vegetables I threw in.  I am only giving it three stars because even cooking it on a low temp for a long period of time in the oven the roast itself turn out really dry (and there was still a bit of pink in the middle).  I have tried a lot of different ways to cook pot roast.  I think cooking it in the crock pot makes it a lot more tender and juicy.

This is the most awesome pot roast recipe ever. Follow it to the tee and you will not be disappointed. Don't think you can get away with not using the vermouth it is an important ingredient for the flavor.

This was fantastic. We just had it for dinner last night. Fussy husband loved it. Very versatile, subbed celery soup for mushroom. Also didn't have any onion soup mix, so I just cooked up some onions in the drippings from searing the roast. Et Voila!

I thought the cooking time neeed to be increased to 5 hours. 3 hours it was still tough, 4 hours it was still kinda tough, after I cut it up in chunks and through it back in the oven, it was finally tender after 5 total hours. The sauce was a little runny.

The best pot roast I have ever had. I have never made a pot roast but this is the kind of recipe that you can memorize. I did change a couple of things though. Thanks to the other reviews, I decided to cook it for 5 hrs. instead of the 3 that it calls for & I put the vegetables in the last 2 hrs. I also didn't have any wine so just used more water. But this recipe definitely taught me the basics of what to put in a pot roast!

Absolutely fantastic!!!  This is such a fantastic recipe!  I added the extra butter from the frying pan, carrots and celery around the roast and sprinkled them with garlic salt and pepper.  Roast turned out perfect, vegetables delicious and served it with white rice and a delicious gravy that I made from the cooking sauce...superb!

This is a great recipe!  I've made this with no changes except for olive oil instead of butter.  It was great!  I've also done this with onions instead of the soup mix and I normally don't add the cream of mushroom soup just cause I don't think it needs it (great with it but I don't always have the mushroom soup on hand).  I also tend to add a teaspoon of horseradish to it just out of habit.  Again, this is a great recipe without any changes.

This was great. I did make a few modifications, but the base of the recipe I'm sure is still superb. The biggest two were that I cooked longer, and lower; and I added a can of french onion soup (liquid kind) b/c I wanted more gravy. I also added celery and carrots. (And made mashed potatoes on the side.) Turned out awesome.

I printed out this recipe 5 years ago and it's time I pay homage to this oven pot roast recipe. I love it, my family loves it and when I make it for guests they thank me for months after. I have tried substituting white wine for the Vermouth and it gave it a different taste, I like the vermouth much better. I make the recipe as is without any changes. This has been a family favorite for years and will be for years to come. Thank you.

The best roast I have ever made! Although, I used brown gravy mix and balsamic vinegar instead of the soup mix and wine. I also sauteed some onions in the pan before I browned the roast in the butter.  AB-FAB!!!  I paired it with Roasted Vegetables: http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Roasted-Vegetables/Detail.aspx

Easy and good.  I used beef consomme instead of the vermouth.  I added chopped carrots and potatoes during the last hour of cooking and they cooked up nicely.

I really like this recipe I have made it twice and my family has really enjoyed it..I used golden mushroom soup instead of cream of mushroom, and used Beef consumme as suggested by others.  This  gave me the more brown gravy look and taste that I enjoy.  I cooked at 275 for 2 hours then 350 for 3 more until the roast could be shredded with a fork. In the last hour i added potatos, carrots, pearl onions, and mushrooms.  After cooking I pull the roast apart and let it soak in the dish with the gravy for about 20 min then serve.

I thought I had a top round roast, discovered late that it was a rump.  Didn't have time to slow cook and I hate slow cooked stringy meat.  Followed the recipe except that I didn't have dry vermouth, used cooking burgundy and baked about 2 hours instead.  The meat was tender and tasty.  Don’t overcook this and you will have a delicious tender roast.  I usually don’t buy rump because I hate stringy meat that is falling apart.  I won’t be afraid to pass up those deals anymore; this is the recipe for rump!  Makes a great comfort meal.

This was very good.  I made it just as directed, except I deglazed the pan with the vermouth and then mixed the sauce ingredients in the pan to take advantage of the drippings.  I made it for the in-laws and they loved it.

OH MY GOSH. I just made this, it was my very first pot roast evar, and it turned out AMAZINGLY GOOD. The only change I made ingredient-wise was to stir in a can of beef consumme instead of the wine, as was suggested on here. I browned the meat in a cast iron skillet, added everything else to the skillet and covered it in foil for 2 hours at 325. As per suggested on here in other comments, I added some baby red potatoes and chopped carrots in at the 1-hour-left mark, basted the meat, and cranked it up to 350 for that last hour. The meat was fall-apart good when everything was done - I didn't even need a knife!! AMAZING recipe. Thank you so much! I need not look anywhere else for a pot roast how-to!

Quite possibly the best roast I have ever tasted.  I added garlic powder and a little salt to the flour mixture and used beef consume to deglaze the pan instead of dry vermouth.  Fantastic!!!

I baked this covered in foil for 2 of the 3 hours, then uncovered for the last hour. It was SUPER tough, couldn't even eat most of it (and I did turn it so it would retain gravy evenly). Would definitely recommend keeping covered through the whole cooking time. I will say the gravy it made was awesome - just eating that on mashed potatoes and veggies almost made it worthwhile!

This roast was FANTASTIC!!  The flavor was amazing.  My husband doesn't usually like leftovers, but he reheated the roast HIMSELF the next day!!  I did omit the onion soup mix because of sodium  content, but kept everything else the same.  Thank you so much for this recipe!

By far the BEST pot roast ever and the EASIEST.  I used some suggestions from other reviews and they were amazing!  I used a 3lb choice chuck roast, omitted the vermouth and deglazed the pan with beef consomme instead, roasted meat in same pot I browned it in, added thickly sliced onions to top of roast and then added fresh mushrooms, carrot and potatoes for last hour.  THANK YOU FOR THE RECIPE BECKY!!!

Great roast! I used a 6 pound roast (if I'm going to go through the trouble, I'm going to make sure there are leftovers)...I too seasoned the flour with garlic powder and herbs before I seared the roast.  I used two cans of Cream of Mushroom with Roasted Garlic because I love lots of gravy.  I also used the entire envelope of onion soup.  1/4 cup of red wine instead of vermouth and a little water.  I then added potatoes and baby carrots.  Put in an oven bag at 325 degrees for 3 hours and it was beautiful!

Delicious! I followed another reviewer's suggestion and added garlic powder and season salt to the flour (I used Accent Season Salt). I also used water instead of vermouth and it still turned out great. I will probably add 1 more can of the mushroom soup next time so there is more gravy. There were no leftovers left after dinner. This is a great recipe!

Very good pot roast and very easy. I used the same pan for braising as baking, and dialed the heat back to 275 and baked longer.I also used Cabernet sauvignon because that's what I had open. The gravy was delicious over garlic mashed red potatoes. I will definitely make the recipe again.

LOVED this recipe, honestly it was so easy and tasty I cant imagine why I would bother making a fuss for a roast anymore!!!! It went from the fridge to the oven in like 10 minutes and the gravy thickens itself from the flour on the roast, so it's ready to go.  Really loved it, and my husband and son kept saying mmmm-mmmm-mmmmmmmm!!! lol

I have been trying to find a good way to do pot roast for years and this recipe is it. I don't add the wine, just the soup and mix and it is sooooo yummy. It is tender, jucy, and has a gravy type sause all done. This is already going in the family recipe book for sure.

I prefer an oven baked roast to a crock pot prepared one, but you could easily make this in your crock pot as well.  Super simple and a nice change from my usual roast recipe.  Husband and kids both enjoyed and asked me to add this to the dinner rotation.

I like pot roast a lot. It makes me think of Sundays when I was a kid. This recipe was ok. I do think that the cooking time was a little long. We got it out about 30 minutes early and it was already a little tough. The gravy was tasty, but it isn't something I'd want to eat over and over. I don't think we'd make this one again.

Husband and I thought it was ok, but my 9 y/o daughter (who, to be fair, is a bit of a drama queen) Gaged with every bite.

Great pot roast recipe. I seasoned the roast with garlic salt, paprika, and pepper, then drenched with flour. I braised mine in a dutch oven and used chardonnay instead of vermouth and also threw in a can of beef consomme. Cooked it for 3 hours at 325, threw in carrots and small chunks of potato the last hour. Excellent recipe.

I made this for our friends and they loved it!  I surrounded it by lots of whole little creamer potatoes, cut carrots and onions and used cream of celery soup mix instead of mushroom.  It was super easy to make and a huge hit.

This was awesome.  It is -15 out and cooking this all day made the house warm and smell wonderful.  It is a keeper.  Best comfort meal that I have had in a long time... especially on a cold winter day.

Very good and very easy. Sauted roast then pulled it out and sauted 1 chopped onion until soft and 1 clove garlic, crushed briefly. Deglazed pan and added roast back along with gravy made from Cream of mushroom soup and a packet of aujus mix. Covered my cast iron pot with foil to seal and put lid on for 2 hours. Then added carrots and potatoes and cooked for another 1 1/2 hours. Wonderful. Keep an eye on gravy though, it can become very thick, mine did! Should have added more water when I added veggies.

I've never made a pot roast in my life so after searching many recipes, I chose this one.  Excellent choice!  
I didn't have wine so I added 1/8 cup red wine vinegar with water to total 1/2 cup, used dry onion and mushroom soup mix and added cut up onions to the roaster when I put the meat in.  Baked for 3 1/2 hours (I like my meat well done) and it's very tender and tasty!  I was afraid there might be a vinegar taste but there wasn't, and it also helps to tenderize the meat if you get a cheaper cut.  Next time I will add more soup to make more gravy but other than that it was perfect!

This was fantabulous. The only adjustment made was to split the cream of mushroom with cream of celery and cook in a crock pot. What flavor and aroma.

Really good flavor.  I made some of the modifications suggested by others-garlic powder in the dredge, browned in bacon fat, cooked for 2 hours, then added celery, onion, potatoes & carrots.  Very tasty!  Didn't make a lot of gravy; next time I might add another can of cream of mushroom soup.

This was my first attempt at a pot roast, and I must say it went well! I chose to add celery, carrots, and new (red) potatoes with about an hour left in the cooking process. I also added about a cup of water along with the veggies to keep things covered and moist. Worked great!

I am re-writing my review on this recipe as the first time I made it, a couple of years ago, I did so based on other reviewers suggestions to do it in the slow cooker on low for 7 hours. It came out great that way, however at that time I was new to slow-cooking and wanted to cook everything in it! I have now made this recipe a few times, and it comes out best of all in the oven without a doubt. I usually buy a 4lb rump roast, I dust it with all over with flour (1/2 a cup is a little excessive), then I sprinkle ground black pepper and a little dry mustard. I usually use dry white wine, red works well too though, I use a little more than half a cup and de-glaze the pan first before pouring it over the roast after browning. I brown the roast in light olive oil, not butter, and I omit the onion soup as I personally don't like the burnt onion taste it has, instead I use half a good sized red onion finely chopped, just throw it in raw on top of the browned meat and add a cup of strong beef stock along with the mushroom soup. Cook for 3 and a half hours on 350oF and add some potatoes and chunky chopped carrots 45 mins before the end - delightful results every time!

I absolutely loved my pot roast.  I even used a lower quality meat and it was amazing. The only thing I changed was that I used beef broth instead of the vermouth.  I can't buy alcohol because I'm not 21.  Even with this change, the dinner was amazing.

Great Pot Roast!!! So tender.  I too used Wine istead of Vermouth.  I cut a few small slits on top of roast and pushed in slices of fresh garlic.  Next time I will only cook for 2 - 2 1/2 hours.

this is a fantastic recipe; i used a venision roast instead of beef. the soup/wine combo COMPLETELY tenderized the meat. the only thing i did differently was to use McCormic Montreal Steak seasoning instead of black pepper flakes. This is my new fav. recipe for my husband's abundant deer meat!

This is the best pot roast I have ever cooked. Like another reviewer said, it's worth cooking this if only for the smell alone.....yum! I did a couple things different: I browned the onions and some garlic in the butter then I browned a top round roast in the same pan with the onions and garlic. Then instead of vermouth I used Alaskan Amber Ale since that's what we drink (not wine drinkers). I put some carrots and potatoes in an hour before it was done and voila! Perfection!

We cut up potatoes, carrots, garlic, onions, and sage and tossed them in at the last hour with salt and pepper. I doubled the gravy amount because we love gravy - used 2 cans cream of mushroom, 1 cup vermouth, and a whole onion soup mix packet - it turned out pretty good but there was a meatiness missing in the gravy... will maybe try 1/2 cup vermouth and 1/2 cup beef stock/consomme next time. Served with garlic bread. Licked plates clean!

Wow!  Just made this tonight for my husband and my sister and her family and it was a winner.  So easy and so delicious.  My roast was 4 pounds and I cooked it at 325 for the first hour, as suggested by others, and then 350 for the remaining 2 1/4 hours.  I added baby carrots and potatoes for the last hour.  I'll definitely be making this again - thanks so much!!

Excellent!  My six year old son, who rarely eats meat, wanted seconds as did my daughter.  I didn't have the onion soap mix so I used minced onion and added some spices.  I'm sure I will make this again.  THANK YOU!!

My entire family loved this! I did not have onion soup mix so I used dry, minced onion. I used chardonnay instead of vermouth and before adding the roast to the baking dish, I poured a can of beef broth in. I added potatoes after about an hour. The gravy was delicious. Can't wait to make this again.

The gravy had such good flavor. I also used white wine instead of vermouth. I added small red potatoes, onion, carrots and portabella mushrooms. Next time I will cook in the crock pot. The meat wasn't falling apart which I like when I make a roast in the crock pot (I had to use a knife & cut into pieces). I will never use another pot roast seasoning in a packet again. It made the house smell wonderful.

This turned out so well, save for the fact that I did not watch it closely enough and it was slightly over done for our taste.  Regardless, it was tender.  I used one cup white vermouth and the full package of onion soup.  This is a keeper.  Thanks.

This is the best pot roast I have ever made, or had for that matter. I did not have vermouth or onion soup mix so I substitued dry cooking sherry and a package of Knorr vegetable mix instead. You want to talk about delicious!! I have also tried it with the original ingredients and it was awesome as well. I also cook mine for about 5 hours, it just melts in your mouth!

I used to buy those "pot roast in a bag" packets thinking I could never get the right mix of spices on my own to get a really good flavor.  I was wrong!  This was delicious, I had all ingredients on hand, and it was ridiculously simple to make.  I also got raves at work when I reheated the leftovers in the microwave!

This was so good! I did use water instead of wine but left everything else the same. The gravy was really good too, I was a bit skeptical but it turned out great! I think this was the best roast I've ever made. Recipe is definitely a keeper!

This was very good.  My husband says it was too salty, but I didn't think so.  And we both agree that it came out very very moist and very easy to make.

This recipe is delicious! My family loved it. I added potatoes and carrots to the pan, and added a cup of water two hours in. The only thing I will do different next time is cook it longer. Three hours later it was good, but it didn't fall apart on the fork like we like. Also, I used white wine instead. Such fantastic flavor!

This is one of those recipes that everyone asks me for and they always remember eating it at my house. I think the vermouth might be the secret ingredient!

Burp! This was great! I cooked a 2 pounder and used onions and potatoes only. I cooked it covered @ 275 for 3 hours. Great gravy! I am eating the leftovers right now in a burrito with a little parmesan cheese. The day after meat is just as tasty if not better than last nights! Thank you!

Very good! Tender, easy, and no need for a knife.  I used about 1/2 cup white table wine and reduced it in the butter/drippings.  I didnt use the vermouth and added just a little water to the gravy.  Will definately make this again! This was super quick and easy to make!

What a fantastic recipe!  I haven't cooked a roast in the oven in ages because they always dried out on me somehow.  This one was so flavorful and moist!  My husband and I practically had to fight over the tiny bit of leftovers the next day!  I added a can of French Onion soup and a cup of beef broth in place of the vermouth and it made a wonderful gravy to use with the meat and veggies!  I added halved baby red potatoes, carrots and brussel sprouts around the roast...simply perfect!

I love this recipe. I made this for 12 of my family members and they all begged for more.  The meat was so tender, I didn't need a knife to cut portions! The gravy it makes is flavorful and the smell while it is cooking makes you hungry even if you just ate!

We may never make pot roast on the stove again!  I added carrots and one quartered onion to the pan under the meat and let them cook in the gravy - we didn't have any leftover veggies.

The flavor on this was delicious, but it cooked ALOT faster than in the recipe. Just be aware of this if you want to make it.

Yum! Yum! Tasted fabulous and soooo easy too...I had a bottle of Merlot open, so I used that and I added 1 sweet onion quartered.  It made the best tasting gravy. I'll definately make this one again.

I did not have mushroom soup, so I used cream of chicken.  After reading several review, I added paprika and garlic to the flour, doubled the gravy and only cooked 2 1/2 hours. This got a thumbs up!  Will deffinately make it again.

Oh wow, wow, just wow. This recipe was completely amazing! I used a sirloin tip roast, and substituted the dry vermouth, for red wine. Wow, wow. I will definitely be making this over and over again. MY praises to the person who posted this recipe.

Very, very good roast.  I didn't coat & brown my roast (I used eye round).  I also didn't have onion soup mix (used dried onion instead) or vermouth (used white wine). I also added about a 1/2 tsp rosemary (b/c after trying the recipe for the Christmas Beef Stew, I found I LOVE rosemary with my roasts and stew).

Wow this was really great.  We don't eat much meat but were given a roast so wanted something different again.  We used red wine instead of vermouth & it was really good.  Except for the fact that the canned soup & packet soup mixes are usually really salty & I wish I could find a way to unsalt them a bit when using them.  So don't add more salt cos you will regret that!!!  Other than that the meat was cooked beautifully & tasted really good.  We made Yorkshire puddings to go with it & they were great with the "gravy" from the meat!  Yummy.  We will cook this for others for sure.  (with salt reduced ingredients if I can find some! lol)

This recipe makes a wonderful gravy.  I used the entire envelope onion soup mix, one Campbell's Soup-at-Hand ready to eat mushroom soup, and red wine instead of the vermouth.  I slit the roast and put in slivers of fresh garlic.  I cooked a 2½ roast for five hours at 275° because I had the time.  I added onions the last 1½ hours.  Very nice and tender although through no fault of the recipe, I can't find decent beef roast in this town.   The meat I buy in the grocery stores here has such a funky taste and I end up throwing most of it away.  But if you are lucky enough to be able to purchase good meat, this is a great recipe!

The meat turned out wonderfully moist and tender.  The gravy...tastes like what it is: canned soup and soup mix.  And very salty to boot.  This was definitely an easy, easy recipe, but I think I'd rather have a better flavor. Not a bad recipe, but pretty basic.

This was a easy and great roast, nice flavor! I only gave it 4 stars because I think had I cooked it 3 hours as directed it would be so dry and hard! I used a 5.5 lb roast and 2 hours was plenty!

It did make the house smell good, was very easy to do, and was very tender.  The flavor was OK too but not award winning.  If I use this recipe again, which I may very well since it's easy and not bad, I'll definitely thin down the gravy.

This recipe was wonderful.  The gravy needed absolutely no further work, not even to thicken.  I served it over mashed potatoes with a side of green beans.  Mmmmm.  I may reduce the cooking time just a tad to make it a little less well done--but that's just a personal preference.

This a very easy dish to make. I added fresh onion and a can of mushrooms as well as chopped carrot and potato at about half way through the cooking time. Total cooking time was about 2 hours. It turned out great! Just as promised, it had a wonderful tasty gravy. Thanks for the great recipe.

So easy and incredibly tasty.  I added potatoes and carrots.  I didn't have a lid so I covered the pan with foil, it seemed to work, but I also had to cook the potatoes and carrots longer.  The gravy was amazing!

This recipe was a BIG hit with my family.  My husband has always told me that he doesn't like pot roast so I never make it.  I saw this recipe and decided to take a chance and I just told him it was a "beef roast."  He loved it and so did my 3 kids.  I used a boneless chuck roast instead of a rump roast and I didn't have vermouth so I used some red wine.  It was so tender and delicious and the best part was this recipe was soooooo easy to make.  Try it...I'm sure you will love it too!

Salty but very good and easy. I added 4 sliced carrots during the last hour of roasting. I am now a fan of pot roast :^)

Very tasty and easy, but next time I will throw in a can of Cream of Celery soup as well, won't be as salty and will give it more gravy.

Excellent recipe. I used a venison roast. For the gravy, I used 3/4 cup of chardonnay, increased the onion soup mix to the full packet, and added 4 cloves of chopped garlic. I also added chopped carrots, whole new potatos and whole button mushrooms an hour into it. I checked after 2 hours, the meat was done perfectly, the vegetables had to be kept in for another 15-20 minutes. The meat was great, the vegetables were great, and the gravy was superb. This dish was very popular, everyone liked it.

I decreased the butter to 2 tablespoons and added 2 tablespoons of olive oil to brown the roast. I didn't have mushroom soup so I used a can of beef gravy instead. I substituted white wine for the vermouth. The roast turned out very tender. I thickened the pan drippings with a little flour and water. The gravy was excellent! This recipe is a real keeper!

I loved the gravy this made.  However, I will never buy Round Tip Roast again - it was too fatty. Yuck!  Well I made this again on 1/12/08 - this time was better.  I bought a rump roast that was much much better.

This is the most delicious pot roast I've ever tasted!  It was super easy to prepare & it tasted like I fussed for hours!  I substituted brandy for the vermouth & it still knocked our socks off!  A definite favorite!

My family absolutely LOVES this recipe.  I'm not a big pot roast fan...nor roast of any kind for that matter, but this apparently is right up my carnivorous husband's alley.  He asks for it all the time!

OK...so I don't love pot roast, but my mother has a weird habit of giving my husband and I frozen cuts of meat. Waste not, want not! So, I made this recipe. Wow. Completely different flavor. Well done, All Recipe friend. Umm..I also added a little chopped garlicshallot combo and new potatoes. Since my mother is bound to gift my family with more meat, this will be prepared in the future.

I have tried this recipe several times and it always turns out great.  It's also very easy.  I didn't have vermouth and used white wine instead.  It still turned out nicely.  I also used a chuck roast. This is my standard pot roast recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

This was the best pot roast ever!  My husband was crazy for it. I did use the suggestion of seasoned salt & garlic powder, plus I used the entire envelope of onion soup mix. Abit more wine too than recipe listed. Added carrots & potatoes during the last hour. Will definitely make again!  Thank you for the recipe.

Literally the best roast I’ve ever made. Just outstanding. I don’t drink, so I didn’t have white wine on hand. Instead I used balsamic to deglaze the pan after browning the meat. I also didn’t have mushroom soup so I used cream of chicken (couldn’t taste the chicken so it was a win!). It was so tasty and it made the best gravy for mashed potatoes. I’ll definitely be making this again!!

Made exactly as posted except doubled the recipe as we like leftovers and added some seasoned salt and garlic powder per other suggestions. It was delicious! I threw in potatoes and carrots for the last hour and 15 minutes. My teens loved it and 17 year old even said “I’m having this for breakfast!”

Served this for Christmas dinner to a crowd of 15 and everyone kept saying it was wonderful. I used 2 roasts for a total of 5.5# and because I'm Gluten Free and Dairy Free I made a few changes.  I subbed olive oil for the butter and made my own onion soup mix from this site. For the cream of mushroom soup, I sliced mushrooms and mixed that with the remaining flour/pepper mixture. Dumped that on top of the roast and poured 2 cups of beef broth around the sides and a heavy cup of red wine. I did add a big tablespoon of diced garlic on top of the meat. Cooked in a turkey roaster 350° for about 3-1/2 hours turning over once.

Excellent recipe.  I used chuck instead of rump roast and added potatoes and carrots cut into 1 1/2" chunks.  The slow simmer time makes everything tastes so good.  I used a whole packet of onion soup mix.  The potatoes take out the saltiness of the soup mix.  I use red white instead of vermouth.

This was everything the reviews said it was - easy, fast into the oven, and DELICIOUS. They could sell Febreze in this scent- made the whole house smell cozy! I browned it in a Le Creuset French oven, scraped the bits loose with a can of beef consommé, dumped the combined dry vermouth and soups over, slapped the lid on and that was all she wrote...added quartered carrots, potatoes and a Maui onion and YUM.

I've made this many times and it always gets rave reviews from guests.  It is one of my favorite recipes when I have guests coming over.  A dutch oven makes it really easy and there is very little cleanup.  Just cook any vegetables separately.

I had to substitute cream of chicken soup and red wine, but it came out absolutely awesome.   I was out of mushroom soup, and cream of chicken was all I had.  I used the whole can, then filled the can with red wine, and mixed the whole thing up with one packet of onion soup mix.  And as promised, it smelled heavenly while it was in the oven.

Pretty good, and used up some onion soup mix and vermouth that I was wanting to use up. Also put potatoes and carrots in. Makes lots of gravy; the gravy is sort of a lighter brown gravy from the cream of mushroom soup.

This is the best gravy ever! I used Golden Mushroom soup because this is all I had. I put slivers of garlic in slits all throughout the roast just because we love garlic and rarely cook anything without it. I only had a 2 lb.roast so put it in the oven at 350 degrees for 2 hours. I added 3 large onions, quartered, when putting it in the oven. Then added potatoes and a couple of carrots and parsnips for the second hour. The onions were really delicious in this gravy. I will make this again using regular cream of mushroom soup to see the difference. Heck, might be good to throw in some fresh sliced mushrooms as well.

Delicious! Everyone loved it and ate every last bite! I added 2 teaspoons of liquid smoke on  a whim and couldn't believe how much flavor it added.

Followed  the directions to the letter flavor was good but even though my roast was just a bit over LB wise  it was very very over cooked.

Best pot roast I've ever eaten. Everyone I serve this to say so as well. It is sooooo easy too.I make this with eye round roasts. They are my favorite beef roasts. I mix up the seasonings. Sometimes onion soup mix, sometimes season all salt. Great both ways.  And I sub the alcohol with Kitchen Basics vegetable stock.

This was delicious.  I did not have vermouth so used Sangria.  The “gravy” was great.  The meat pretty much fell apart and melted in your mouth.  Will definitely make again.

I made this recipe tonight, the only change was I didn't have dry Vermouth so I used a Riesling wine!  I can't tell you how grateful I am for this recipe, it was absolutely delicious and so easy! Not a ton of ingredients but the flavor was outstanding!  The gravy that it made was unbelievable, doused it over my boiled red potatoes!  The meat fell apart, and cooked perfectly!  Thank you so much for a great recipe!

Crowd pleaser!  Didn’t have vermouth (don’t even know what that is) just used wine and water instead and it was delish. I also only used half the package of onion soup mix. Baked at 325 for 3 hours.

I’ve had close to this same recipe for years. And, truth be told, it’s the best pot roast ever. I add sour cream for the last hour of roasting and then I have sour cream gravy. I always make mashed potatoes as I don’t like everything to taste the same. And, that gravy on the roast and mashed potatoes is to die for. I mince garlic and sauté it in my Dutch Oven before I brown the roast. Stove to oven. Then back up to stove to make the gravy. Delicious.

Perfect!! I did as another reviewer recommended and cooked it for 5 hours on 250. Put carrots, onions and potatoes in for the last 2 hours. I also added another can of cream of mushroom and Lipton onion soup mix when I put in the veggies.

I used chuck steak that I cut in big pieces and browned. I also used cream of celery soup which took away the metallic taste. I make it often as the family loves it and there’s never any leftovers.

I gave it 5 stars this turned out so good and simple to make! I always have a stock pile of cream of mushroom soup and wouldn’t you know I ran out! I ended up using cream of celery and it turned out just fine! I also added some potatoes and carrots because we love having that with our pot roast. Great simple recipe and will be making this again in the future.

Delicious!  I used beef broth instead of wine.  I also cooked it slow as others have said, 275 Convection for about 5 hours.  I added vegetables the last 2 hours, the last part without the lid on to brown them up.  Will be making this again!

Omg was this good! I opted to use a chuck roast which revealed a tender, moist roast. I added quartered onion, baby carrots and celery chunks the last hour of cooking. I used white wine instead of vermouth. So good! Definitely a “do-over”!

I did add some garlic powder, paprika, and cayenne to the flour. And because I seared it in a dutch oven, I deglazed the pan with a bit of white wine.

I used Whole Foods organic cream of mushroom soup , substituting Trader Joe’s Onion Salt blend for the onion soup mix, and 1/2- 3/4 cup red wine, also a little water. I then followed the recipe. It was delicious. I usually use my crockpot but  it came out so much better in the oven.

I’m usually not a fan of rump roast, but this recipe nailed it!  I started with a roast that was previously frozen (as we buy 1/2 steer every year), made sure my roast was thawed and followed the recipe exactly.  We’ll expect for using Lipton Recipe Secrets Savory Herb with Garlic instead of the onion soup mix.  The roas was very good and tender.  I would certainly do this again.

It was a huge hit with a large crowd - I actually made 2 large chuck roasts at the same time so I had to use extra large cans of mushroom soup.  Didn't have vermouth (which I REALLY wanted to try in the recipe but no time to get it).  So I had to resort to white cooking wine - I know, I know BUT...it was fantastic.  I've made the basics of this recipe before I found this one that inspired adding the wine (since no vermouth).  Using it next time!   I've used red wine in mine before but liked this better.  I upped all gravy ingredients to have more and added a bit of garlic powder and sonoma pepper.  Delicious.  Thanks for sharing Becky!

The flavor was really one-note and it definitely did not pull apart easily as good pot roast should.  In order to salvage this I added a lot of beef stock as it cooked and added rosemary and parsley near the end.  I also had to force it apart and cook it in chunks because there was no flavor in the meat - probably because it is a fairly lean cut.  Because this recipe looked so easy and had great reviews I decided to try it.  Problem is, too many people who've reviewed it gave it higher rating because of the changes they made to the recipe.

I made this and it was great.  I modified hings slightly by adding red potatoes, carrots and celery (as well as an extra half cup of white wine).  The mushroom/onion soup/wine broth served as an excellent gravy right out of the pan.

The best pot roast I've ever had! We cooked it exactly as the recipe states but added carrots, red potato, and celery half way through. It was amazing!

I slow cooked this is my cast iron Dutch oven. It was AMAZING! Added cubed red potatoes, baby carrots, and some beach mushrooms an hour before finished. The gravy is divine!

It was very easy and my family really liked it.  I used white wine vinegar instead of vermouth.  The vinegar taste was a little strong for me.  I will try vermouth next time.

This was delicious and very tender!  I used white wine vs sherry, just because that's what I had on-hand.   My husband doesn't like cream of mushroom soup in recipes so I substituted two cans of beef stock (two to make sure there was enough gravy). I'll make it again!

FINALLY! A 5 Star recipe that ACTUALLY DESERVES 5 stars!! I'm so sick of making 5 star recipes only to wonder if I'm from another planet!  I made this AS IS (except I used a whole soup packet by pure accident instead of 1/2) and it was wonderful, my husband nearly licked his plate. 

A 5 star recipe should be COMPANY WORTHY, & THIS IS!!!  Thank you Becky!

This is a tried and true recipe. I've used English cut, chuck roast, rump roast and sirloin tip for this recipe. It has never failed to be very tender and juicy. Only change, double the gravy ingredients.

I double the recipe for the "sauce" and then mix it with cut up yellow or red potatoes, sliced sweet yellow onion and baby carrots. I fill a cast-iron dutch iron with the pot roast on the bottom and veggies all around. This has to cook at the same temperature, but for four hours. The pot roast is falling apart and the veggies delicious. It feeds the three of us for at least two meals or more. Love this recipe. My modifications occurred over making at least a half of dozen times.

Wow!  Talk about a classic yummy pot roast!  this is now going to be my go-to roast recipe. I did do a few things differently since I didn't have some of the ingredients. I used cream of chicken  (I know, but it was all I had!), and white wine instead of vermouth. My roast was only two pounds and I was in a hurry so I cooked it in a Dutch oven at 375 degrees for 1 hour. I will cook it longer next time so it will be more tender. The gravy was to die for!  Next time I will put more potatoes in the pot so I can eat more of the gravy!

I made this tonight for my family - a group of 7 adults.  My boys were skeptical because I've had lots of roast "fails" and I didn't check the reviews first! To my surprise, I found vermouth in the house! Hubby doesn't do mushrooms,  so I doubled the sauce for 2 roasts - using one can of cream of chicken and one cream of celery. otherwise, I pretty much followed the recipe. Used a roaster on the burner to brown the roasts and popped them in the oven. I flipped them over every 45 minutes or so, to keep it all juicy.  Amazing aroma!  I kept them in the oven for 4 hours - just because there were 2 roasts. Everyone loved it and went back for seconds! And they wanted to know what I did differently!  Thank you!  This will be a repeat favorite for us!

Loved this recipe. I combined this recipe with another.  Followed same instructions, only I cut the meat in 1-2 inch pieces & dredged in flour.  In a large pan, add 2 TBSP oil & sear the chunks of meat until brown. Remove from pan & set meat aside.  Mushroom Mixture:  Reduce heat to medium.  In same large pan, add 1/4 cup butter,  saute 8 oz. of sliced mushrooms, 1 med. chopped onion & 2 chopped garlic cloves. Cook 5 mins. Stir 1 1/2 tsp flour, cook & stir 1 minute.  In a small bowl, combine the Cream of Celery, Onion soup mix & 1/2 cup White Wine.  Add to Mushroom Mixture in pan & add broth as needed. Simmer 10 minutes. Pour over Roast in large skillet. Bake up to 3 hours.  In last 2 hours of baking, add 5 med carrots cut into chunks & 5 small Golden Yukon potatoes cut into quarter size.  Add broth as needed for a gravy mixture.  Enjoy : )  Sarasmiles

Made this for Christmas dinner for the people who don't like Italian food.  They loved it!  I followed a combination of reviewers, one who spiced up the dredging flour and one who suggested mushroom gravy powder instead of the onion soup mix.  Everyone around the table loved it, and I will totally be making this again.

Great flavor, although I changed the dry onion soup mix (didn't have it) for a dry italian dressing mix.  I only had 1/2 of the amount of vermouth called for so I added some white wine.   I roasted it in a roasting bag and added about a 10 small golden potatoes and a large sliced yellow onion and several large carrot pieces.  I cooked it until I could put a fork in it and it came out easily a little over 3 hours.  I loved the gravy it made, next time I might double it.

This is the best pot roast I have ever tasted, and this Nana has been cooking for 45 years!! I used an English cut chuck roast that at the end of cooking (3 hours) was fork tender. I cooked the roast in a pan using butter, I added onions and celery to the pan drippings cooking till caramelized. I transferred the meat to the roasting pan and mixed the veggies and drippings  into the gravy, I used red wine instead of white wine.  Red potatoes and carrots added toward end of cooking. To die for!!! Next time I think I will add fresh mushrooms....thank you for this great recipe!!

Fantastic! I added baby Bella mushrooms and sprinkled a little thyme. I used half the amount of onion soup mix because I find it salty. Added carrots and potatoes the last hour if cooking and a little water. My husband and I really enjoyed this. Definitely my new go to for pot roast.

This pot roast was wonderful!  The gravy was delicious .  I will definitely make this recipe again.  I did not have any wine available so used beef broth in place of the wine.  I think the wine would've made the flavor even better.

This was excellent! i made this using Bob's All Purpose gluten free flour and chuck roast, browned the meat with a little olive oil (1/2 T) instead of butter, used only 1/4c Vermouth instead of 1/2 c. Very tasty! My hubby complimented the gravy saying it was better than the last couple times I made pot roast.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is an amazing recipe!!  Followed tips and added about 1-1/4 tsp. garlic salt.   At 2-hour mark, added a can of chicken broth and one onion, sliced, a half bag of baby carrots (would use regular carrots next time) and quartered Yukon/gold potatoes last (no peeling required).  Cooked one more hour for the 3-hour total, and the pot roast was done.  Tender meat, veggies swimming in delicious gravy.  Yum.  I going for a second helping now!  Thank you for sharing this great recipe!!  This is a keeper for sure.

I found this recipe to be the simplest, and most enjoyable. I didn't have onion soup mix, cream of mushroom soup or wine, so I did make substitutions. It came out wonderful and my guests thoroughly enjoyed it. I enjoyed the leftovers in my salads!! 
I substituted chopped red onion, a six-mushroom white truffle balsamic vinaigrette, evoo, red wine vinegar.

I skipped butter & vermouth, & tossed a 3# bottom roast into crockpot. I sprinkled dry onion soup on top, then dabbed mushroom soup, laid 6 peeled Idaho potatoes , 1/2# baby carrots , a bag of Pearl onions,  & 1 cup sliced celery  on top. I poured a soup can of water, & turned to Low for 6 hours. A one-pot family dinner complete with gravy. Super!!!

Fantastic! Due to my Mom's numerous food allergies, I had to substitute a few things, but it still turned out great! Instead of canned mushroom soup, I stewed fresh mushrooms with 10oz of water, added the onion mix, and 2 tablespoons of mayonnaise to get that creaminess. Used gluten-free flour instead of regular flour, and earth balance dairy-free spread instead of butter. Even with all of this, the consensus was that this was the best pot roast ever! Followed the directions to the letter except for the substitutions. 10/10 would definitely make again! :)

I added a large can of mushrooms, and substituted 1 c. of beef broth for the vermouth (didn't have any on hand).  Was fabulous!  Will definitely make this again.

This pot roast was delicious! I was so excited to use my new ultra pro from tupperware I HAD to try this out! I'm not even a huge fan of pot roast but my husband loves it. I did do some things different like leave out the vermouth/white wine. I don't keep that stuff on hand and I was also out of the onion soup mix but I had au ju gravy mix I used instead. I did add some water (since I didn't have the liquid) I would have added beef broth if I had that on hand. (Need to go to the grocery store I guess) and like one reviewer had suggested I lowered the temp to 250 and let it cook for about 5hrs so I could start it before church and come home to it being done and resting while I made additional sides. I didn't even use a knife, it pulled apart with two forks. It was perfect.

My husband loved this!  Because I used what I had on hand, I made a few changes. I used white cooking wine, beef gravy (instead of soup) and frozen pearl onions. Placed it in a dutch oven at 300 for three hours.

I added garlic powder, Italian seasoning and dash of Cayenne pepper to flour and shook with meat in gallon ziplock. Then browned meat in  Dutchoven, adding more olive oil as needed when browning all sides.   Then I browned;  1/4 cup onion and 3 garlic cloves to meat, adding 1/3 cup red wine., gently stirring in browned flour scrapings from bottom of pan.  I added juice from raw meat to mushroom soup/ vermouth mixture.  then poured soup mixture on top of meat and baked 3 hours. YUM!!!!!

EZ & Fantastic!  I didn't have mushroom soup so I left it out. I'm glad I did. THIS IS GREAT! I added Onions, carrots, parsnips, mushrooms, cloves of garlic and potatoes.  I wanted more veg, so when the meat was gone from the pan I added more veg to the beef/onion soup liquid and simmered them. OH What a great idea that was! BF said it was the BEST ROAST HE EVER HAD IN HIS ENTIRE LIFE!  This time I used mushroom soup and added a bit of Ranch Dip envelope. I cooked it 2 hours.....better at 1.5 hours. 3/27/19 followed recipe exactly , 1.5 hours , cast iron w/ aluminum foil cover. Use Ranch pkt next time.

LOVED IT! Best roast I have ever made. I followed others advise and switched to Chuck Roast and used dry white wine instead of vermouth. I added carrots and pots one hour before completion and it was out of this world. Roast was tender and fell apart with ease just like Grandma's!

This is such an easy and amazing recipe.  I've made it a lot so here are my standard modifications, although it is good just as written too!  I add some Montreal Steak Seasoning to the flour mixture instead of salt/pepper.  I use Sherry instead of Vermouth and always add a little more than it calls for.  I also use a chuck roast instead of a rump roast and then shred it when it is done and remove a little of the fat.  I sear it in my cast iron pan which then goes straight into the oven afterwards so I don't lose anything.  Everyone loves this dish, from my picky 6 year old to my hard to please father-in-law!

I followed the recipe using wine instead of vermouth. The flavor was good. It didn't make as much gravy as I thought it would and the meat was a little dry. I had a 3 lb roast so I cut cooking time to 2 1/2 hours. Next time I'll just try 2 hours.

We only eat Beef about 2x a month and this was awesome. The changes I made as we use little or no salt was to eliminate the Onion Soup mix and added low sodium Beef Gravy, carrots, onions and small potatoes.

Used chicken broth instead of wine cause that's all I had and it turned out divine! I deglazed the pan with the roast in the pan like another reviewer said , and everything else was as directed . Will definitely make again soon!

This was a great recipe!  The gravy it made was DELICIOUS.  I definitely recommend this recipe.  When I made it, I didn't have any vermouth, but I did have the white wine.  It was SO GOOD!

This is delicious and easy enough for a husband (that's me) to make. The gravy would probably be great on Salisbury Steak too! It was a great hit at my house.

I was amazed at how delicious this was. I was a little skeptical because of the strong Vermouth, but after baking it added the perfect flavor. I add 4 springs of rosemary to it and it's absolutely perfect. I gave some leftovers to a friend and she said she absolutely loved it! I highly recommend this!

This was hands-down the best Pot Roast recipe I've found.  I used a rump roast which turned out so perfectly tender and favorable.  The gravy from the pot was the best addition to an already delicious meat. I wouldn't change a thing and I'll be cooking it again and again!

My family loved this delicious pot roast! It was juicy and melt in your mouth tender! It was simple to prepare and the whole house smelled wonderful while it was cooking. This is definitely my favorite roast recipe. I made it exactly like the instructions. I will never make pot roast in a slow cooker again!

Absolutely love the sauce for this recipe! I used Merlot instead of vermouth, which worked out really nicely. I added carrots, potatoes and onions in for the last hour and 15 mins and this caused me to need to add some beef stock for more liquid but it came out great. Next time I'll be using this same recipe in the crock pot though because the roast just wasn't as tender as I would have liked. Great recipe!

I didn't have the condensed soup or vermouth so I just used two cups of beef broth instead.  It was still amazing.  We couldn't stop eating.  My husband went to put barbeque sauce on his piece of roast (he's not a big roast fan) but my daughter made him try it without the sauce first.  He loved it.

This was wonderful! My guests were late and I left this in the oven at 300 degrees for an extra 2 hours! No problem! Lots of gravy, too.

This was delicious.  Made it almost exactly as the recipe called for.  I did not have dry vermouth or even dry wine... but I tossed in what wine I did have!  The roast was moist and delicious, and the gravy was amazing. My husband thought it rivaled our annual Christmas roast- and that is always a much more expensive cut of beef!  I will be making this again in the future.

This pot roast is delicious!  My husband said it's one of the best meals I ever made!  I did make a few changes based on other's reviews and what I had in the house.  I added seasoned salt to the flour mixture, used cream of celery soup instead of mushroom, and used water instead of vermouth.  I also cooked it for 5 hours at 275 and it came out fork tender and delicious!  Will definitely be making this again and again.

Delicious! I did not have vermouth so instead i substituted it with Sherry cooking wine. I used the entire envelope of the onion soup mix. I sauteed onions, celery, with the beef after browning it. And I added a 1/2 cup of beef broth. I then added the carrots, potatoes, and mushroom, at the two hour cooking mark.  This pot roast came out soooo tender and yummy.

The only change was the soup. I only had cream of onion on hand.I cooked the roast a bit too long. Next time I'll cook 1 1/2 hours. Nice flavor.

This was by far the best pot roast I've ever made. Only added two onions sautéed after browning the meat and threw in a bunch of garlic cloves (to your taste). Also added a can of drained mushrooms to the mix and baked 4 hours at 325. Perfectly tender, fantastic gravy! Served with mashed potatoes and peas. I did not use the butter or flour. Just some oil to brown the meat and onions. Yummm!

I loved this recipe! However it did cook faster than the recipe calls for. I cooked it at 300 degrees in the Dutch oven I browned it in and it was 180 degrees after only 1 hour! I also used a chuck roast instead of a rump roast. Flavors are great though and I will definitely be making this again! Thanks for sharing!!

Will not make again. I had a lot of hope that this would be wonderful, however, it turned out very dry. Gravy was good but that's where it ended.

Very easy!  I did this one in a large dutch oven so it could go right into the oven from the stove top. I didn't have onion soup mix or vermouth on hand so I used a whole fresh chopped onion and tossed in 4 whole garlic cloves and a bay leaf. I also used a dry red wine and it was great!

So good ... easy and delicious...and no last minute work. Used a 2.5lb rump roast and baked in Corning Ware casserole. Made recipe exactly as written but added 1/2 bag baby carrots after 2 hours and noticed it also needed more liquid so add 1 cup beef stock. After 3 hours, removed for husband to slice and added cup frozen green beans. Heated gravy, carrots and beans in  microwave. Served with noodles and put gravy in pitcher to use with meat and noodles. What a stress-free meal!

WOW! We loved it! I added some garlic powder and onion powder to the flower mixture. I added frozen chopped onion and some garlic to the butter and let it saute for a few minutes then browned the roast. I added cut up carrots and potatoes to the dish and used 1 cup of beef broth instead of the wine. I cooked with a foil cover at 250 degrees for five hours. It was delicious!!!!

Best pot roast I have ever made!  I used a whole pkg of onion soup mix and it made the gravy a little salty but that's an easy fix for next time.

I was never a big fan of pot roast, but made it occasionally to please my hubby.  This recipe changed my mind!  I don't keep vermouth in the house, so I just whip up some beef bouillon.  I add a cup of it so we have extra gravy for our potatoes.  I sear the roast in a Dutch oven, mix the wet ingredients together, cover, then throw it in the oven.  I add the baby carrots, potatoes and onions in after a hour or so.  The only complaint that I have is that the aroma fills the house and makes me salivate all afternoon!

Very tasty pot roast and easy to make. I made a few changes...added Adobo seasoning, garlic powder and dried thyme to the flour, then instead of using dry vermouth I used beef broth from bouillon.  I added baby carrots and quartered potatoes (they were big potatoes)about 1 1/2 hrs into cooking time.  Hubby was a very happy man.  Definitely keeping
this recipe!

I tried this recipe tonite, and followed the recipe, except that I added 1 Tb Worcestershire sauce to the mix. After the first 2 hours, I added small peeled onions, small potatoes split in half, and half a bag of baby carrots. I cooked all this in my (Le Creuset dutch oven - just enameled cast iron).

This was far better than my mother's pot roast recipe. Much more moist and flavorful. I've used her recipe for years, never much liked it, and gave up the idea of pot roast until I found this one.

With the addition of the vegetables, I would have added 1 cup beef broth, because the gravy was rather thick.

If cooked to the exact recipe as stated, I think this would have been wonderful. The additions I made...the Worcestershire sauce and the vegetables...took it over the top.

Five stars from me!

I made this recipe just before a TV football playoff game. Had not much time to assemble, but it was quick and easy. I started it on the stovetop in a cast iron pot and transferred it into the oven. I added carrots and shallots to the pot. I used an inexpensive sweet white wine.  I also baked some potatoes in the same oven the last hour and a half. Yes the aroma is very inviting and the taste great. I checked the meat at about an hour and it was tough, then let it finish the three-hour baking and it could be cut with a fork. The meat was then soft and yummy. My only negative is that the soup mix adds too much salt. I would look for a low salt alternative next time. I might try doubling the liquid since it makes such a nice sauce. This was the first successful pot roast I have made. Will be doing this again.

I made this for a large dinner party and everyone loved it. I did use a mix of cream of mushroom and cream of celery soups. Other than that, I followed the recipe as listed.

This was awesome! I made it almost exactly as listed...I didn't have any Vermouth so I used broth. It was tender, juicy and had an amazing gravy. I added potatoes and carrots the last hour. YUM  This will be my new go to pot roast recipe.

My first attempt at pot roast , I was a little skeptical at first... But my father In law said it tasted like his mom's. What a complement! I am totally sold on this recipe!

I tried this for 20 hunters at camp in Nov. They loved it, I will be making it again for rifle season in December. The only change I made was the portion size I went a 1/2 pound per person and it still ran short.

Just made it for the second time. The first time I used some of the suggestions of others browning the meat in a cast iron skillet, deglazing it with the vermouth (the aroma was heavenly!) Came out perfect!  This time I used my dutch oven, browning the meat in the same pot.  I added some bella mushrooms to the sauce and added red sweet potatoes, onion and carrots. I also added garlic powder to the flour mixture. It was another great success! There are so many ways to work with this recipe. Thanks for the contribution to my recipe library.

Excellent, tender pot roast! And the smell of it cooking was enough to drive everyone crazy with anticipation. I doubled the gravy part, because my family is into gravy, but otherwise only added carrots and potatoes during the cooking. Definitely going in my recipe box!

Made this yesterday exactly as written, using white wine instead
of vermouth. The best Pot Roast we have ever had, thanks so much for the recipe! Served with garlic mashed potatoes and boiled carrots and turnips on the side. Yumyum....certainly make again!

This was delicious! I did add one extra can of cream of mushroom soup, but left the rest of the ingredients the same, because I like to have a little more sauce. Turned out great. I also took Boxermom's advice and added garlic powder and seasonal all to the flour along with the pepper. Yummy!

I've been making pot roasts for over 40 years and this is the best, easiest one ever!  I've seen similar recipes over the years but because I don't like cream of mushroom soup or dried onion soup mix I never tried them.  With all the positive reviews I decided to give it a try... Especially since it uses dry white vermouth (the choice of Julia Child in cooking).  I added a little extra water as I added potatoes and carrots the last hour and my dutch oven has a lid that doesn't fit well, so liquid evaporated.  Bottom line... Delicious with the best gravy ever, and soooooooo easy!

I'm making this as I type this...and my apartment smells amazing...I added raw onion, potatoes, and carrots an hour before cooking time is done, so they don't get too mushy.  I tasted the sauce...and it is awesome!

This turned out delicious.  I used white cooking wine because I didn't have any vermouth on hand, and like others I added potatoes and carrots during the last 45 minutes of cooking.  The meat was so tender, my son said, "Mom, you don't even need a knife to cut this!"  My other son said, "Why don't you make this all the time?!"  From now on, I will!!

It's too much butter and you can get a better brown with just a little oil after you dredge the flour.

My mom has made a very similar recipe for 40 years - still my favorite to make!  We do not brown the roast.  Put it in the pot (a flat chuck roast works great), drizzle some Heinz 57 steak sauce on top (3-4 Tbs), sprinkle on 1 pkg of onion soup mix, and mix 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup with about 1/2 can of water (I'll have to try it with the vermouth) - pour it over top of the roast.  Cover and put in a 350 oven for 1 hour, then reduce to 275 for 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 hours.  You may want to slide a foil-lined cookie sheet onto the lower rack of the oven when you start, in case the liquid boils over.  Best gravy ever!  Makes great hot beef sands with mashed potatoes and cover the whole thing with the gravy.

This was very good and easy to make. I did fine the sauce a little boring and spiked it with more vermouth, a little cream, water and herbs de provence. My husband loved it.

Over the past 25 years, I've tried many pot roast recipes, but always come back to this one.  There's a reason some recipes, like this pot roast recipe, are classics; they are just good, comfort food.  The only thing I do differently is I'll use a splash of red wine, instead of vermouth or white wine, if it's handy.  Thank you for sharing this recipe worthy of five big stars!

This was good. I halved the recipe and it only took two hours in the oven. I added cut-up red potatoes and sliced carrots to the baking dish — they were delicious. Next time I'll probably use reduced-fat cream of mushroom soup, as this was very very rich.

Great pot roast!     I made a few changes to suit the ingredients I had on hand.   After browning the roast, I sauteed some chopped garlic & coarsely chopped onion to the pan & then into the liquid mixture.

I didn't have vermouth, so I used red wine - about a cup.  (Of course, it changed the flavor of the gravy.)       After the roast had been in the oven for an hour, I added about a lb. of baby carrots.    At the two-hour mark, I added some thickly slicked mushrooms.

The roast, veggies & gravy were all delicious!    I served mashed potatoes on the side.

I made this tonight and it was delish!! I did make a a few changes though. I added a small can of tomato sauce,carrots,potatoes and 3 stalks of celery and a raw onion. I deglazed with a very small amount of Mascato  (all i had on hand) And used the seasoning from a packet of Mccormick vegetable soup (you could use a pot roast one also) Im sure it would have been good without the changes but they sure made it WONDERFUL!

Oh my god this is amazing. I used Morton's Nature Seasoning in my flour mixture instead of pepper, used EVOO instead of butter, and used Cream of Chicken instead of Cream of Mushroom. 

Came out juicy and tender and so delicious.

Absolutely fabulous and so simple!!! I added 2 shallots on the bottom and between meat. Broth was excellent (I have salty pallet, so added a lot more seasoning salt and garlic powder). Highly recommended!

Wow - this was amazing! To make it even easier, I did it in a slow coooker. A couple other enhancements: I added a layer of mushrooms, then the roast which I had browned in bacon fat, garlic and onions. An hour before it was ready, I added potatoes and carrots. The mushroom gravy was delicious!

This was FABULOUS. I followed the recipe for the most part. I didn't brown in butter but used olive oil and then I baked it in a stone crock at 275 for about 3 hours. Added potatoes/carrots, too. Even my super picky 4 year old liked it. And it smelled divine in my house all evening!

This was great! I used red wine instead of the vermouth (what I had on hand) along with adding some beef broth. I put everything in the crockpot after the meat was browned. The gravy thickened on its own and was delish!

This is the BEST!  My family loved the flavor of the gravy which thickened itself.  I served it with garlic mashed potatoes and fresh carrots.  I think the vermouth is an important ingredient.  It worked well to toss the flour, pepper, and meat in a plastic bag for even coating.  Comfort food at its best.  Thank you, Becky, for a keeper recipe.

Made this as part of a buffet dish for grad party - three people asked for the recipe (one was the husband of a friend!) - EVERYONE loves this recipe - especially the sauce it makes.  Only change I made is using red/white wine instead of vermouth.  Perfect!

I altered this recipe a little based on reviews, and the ONLY reason for only four stars is because the meat was a little overcooked for my liking. I used red wine instead of vermouth, cream of celery instead of mushroom, and dry onion & mushroom soup mix instead of just dry onion... I cooked at 250 for 4 hours 45 min (with a 3.5 lb rump roast), with fatty side on top. I used two baking pans - as I did not have a casserole dish - maybe this is why it overcooked? I put one pan on top of the other, all sides matching... Not sure. The gravy was AMAZING - it really could not have been any better!! I put carrots, quartered onions & quartered potatoes in an hour before the roast was done and none were cooked enough... Still good, but needed more time for sure. Next time, I might only do 3 hours 45 min and put the veggies in for two hours instead of one...

Hubby said, "Keep this one in the rotation".  That means he REALLY liked it and wants it more often. This will be my go to roast recipe from now on.  I think next time, I'm going to thinly slice some raw onions to smother the roast with and leave out the onion soup mix. It's a little too salty for me but it turned out sooooo tender!

This is my new roast recipe.  I have made it twice now.  I always used a crock pot but decided to try the oven,  and am I glad I did.  I used elk roasts both times which tend to be dry, but not with this method.  The first time I used the recommended amount of liquid, but the second time I used more, but only because game meat tends to be dry.  I also cooked it at 250 degrees for 4-5 hours.  So good, I have been sharing this recipe with my friends on facebook!

This is oven roast is AMAZING! My whole family loved it and I even shared with my neighbor. Delicious! I added seasoning to the flour mixture (pepper, tad of seasoning salt) and I used white cooking whine and I believed I used cream of golden mushroom soup instead of the regular. I also added small round potatos, carrots and garlic cloves.  Just a few simple changed to meet my taste.  Making this again this week :) Thanks for sharing!

This is an awesome recipe on my regular cooking schedule. All 3 kids and hubby love this. I use a chuck tender roast and substitute beef broth for vermouth, and bake for 4 hours. For the last hour, I add potatoes and carrots.

Good, though I agree it was a little bland.  I added carrots, potatoes, garlic and onions, too. The vegetables were perfect, the meat tender, but the sauce just needs something.

EXCELLENT RECIPE! My family loves it! I use a bigger roast, so I cook it for about 6 hours, and use white wine as oppose to the vermouth...

This was delicious and had it for my family and husbands, they LOVED it.  Something about the vermouth gives it such a deep rich taste.  I also added a little more beef broth and water but that's the only difference.

Kept the original quantities the same, but turned it into a stew by adding 2 cubed potatoes, 5 chopped carrots, and two quartered onions.  Needed some salt, but otherwise good and easy!

This was the first every pot roast I'd made.  It turned out exactly like what  my mental image of a perfect pot roast should be.  I cooked it for 3 hours, and an hour and 15 minutes before it was done, I added carrots, potato and turnip.  A delicious, complete meal that blew the socks of my husband.

Tasty.  I used pam to brown the meat instead of butter and I only had extra dry vermouth.  This recipe came out great despite my tweaks.

Great base recipe. I used EVOO instead of butter, and didn't use flour. I rubbed the roast w/ salt, pepper, steak rub and paprika then browned. I mixed the soup mix and cream of mushroom with a can of beer (instead of the vermouth), then cooked all in the crock pot on low for 10 hours with carrots, onions and potatos, this was sooo good!

My hubbie said it was the best pot roast he's ever tasted! Eating seconds today. I couldn't quite find dry onion soup mix instead used pot roast mix by mccormicks. Since I doubled the recipe I used part white cooking wine/part red wine/part water.  I served it with mashed potatoes and gravy was excellent on it!

This is THE BEST pot roast EVER!!!  Am usually hesitant about covering things with Cream of Mushroom soup since it just makes every recipe taste the same.  The combo of white wine, soup and dry soup mix though is perfect!  The addition of the flour thickens the gravy up so nicely.  Was seriously dreaming about it the next day planning on when I could make it again!  LOVE this recipe - thanks!

My taste buds are doing the happy dance for sure!  I used mushroom soup with roasted garlic, and a whole envelope of the Onion/Mushroom soup mix as well as subed in with white wine.  The smell is incredible while it cooks.

This was ok. I used white wine and followed the rest of the recipe to the t. I'd rather make it in the crock pot though. It comes out too dry this way.

This is the best pot roast I've ever had.  I've made this recipe numerous times and have always gotten rave reviews.  I've added carrots and pearl onions and some extra condensed soup to extend the gravy and make it into a full meal.  I make this with the recipe for "The Best Mashed Potatoes" and dinner guests have started requesting it!

Wow! This was great it just melted in your mouth. The only thing I did was in the beginning I used only a table spoon of butter with crushed garlic, this way it gave it a nice brown color. First time I made this there was a bit to much butter making the flour a bit soggy. Also I cooked it at 300 for three hours and it was wonderful. Sauce makes a great tasting gravy great over mashed potatoes or even baked. Will make this a regular!

I thought this recipes was great.  I didn't have any soup in the house, so I used beef broth and also spiced the roast with some seasoning salt, paprika, and black pepper before browning it in the butter.  Based on my work schedule, I dropped the temp to 300 and cooked it for about 3 1/2 hours.  Spelled fantastic and tasted just as good.

FABULOUS recipe!  Tasty and very easy.  I can't eat mushrooms, so instead of using the cream of mushroom soup, I used cream of onion.  I added minced garlic in with the onion soup mix, and water in place of the wine.  Turned out FABULOUS!  I also took the other's idea of adding in the carrots and potatoes an hour before the roast was to be finished.  Everything was perfect.

New family fave!  This was great!  I sliced an onion in the bottom of the crock pot, followed the directions for the rest except used a dry chardonnay instead of vermouth.

I have never cooked a roast in the oven before, so I thought I would try this one since it got such great reviews.  This was easy and very, very good.  Had some friends over for dinner and they loved it.  I usually use the crock pot for roasts, but this recipe takes the prize for the best roast I ever put in my mouth.  It was so tender!  I used wine instead of vermouth and it came out great!

Meat was really tender, but I may have messed up this recipe by selecting a cut of meat that wasn't lean. My overall feeling was that it was too greasy. I'd give it another try with a different cut of meat.

I made this today useing sirlion chunks, I prepared it early in the day to the point at which everything got put into the casserole dish, then stuck it in the fridge.
Wow awesome flavor, the only thing I did different was just at the last add a can of whole button mushrooms.We had it with red skin mashed tatoes, the gravey was lovely. I roasted red peppers, next time, I'll do that but then add them right into the casserole before serving.
Only gave it 4 stars only because I don't rate any recipe that uses canned soup a "5".
I'd rather not use it, but sometimes it does come in handy on a busy weekday.

Very good. However, I would make it in the crock pot next time. I found that it took longer than 4 hours to cook thoroughly in the oven - and by that time was a bit dry. The gravy was still very tasty - and I did add carrots and potatoes for the last couple hours of cooking. Love the taste of the vermouth. Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was wonderful.  My husband said it was just like his Grandma used to make. I used low-sodium beef broth instead of the vermouth. The gravy was also just a tad thick when it came out, so I simmered it in the bottom of the pan adding some broth & water.  Will definetely make again!!!

wow, this was awesome.  I used my dutch oven using 1/2 olive oil and 1/2 butter to brown.  I did a 1/2 beef- 1/2 pork roast.  I added carrots right from the start, followed directions to a tee.  This was perfect.  Big raves.  Thanks.

This recipe was awesome! I have never made a roast before in my whole life and was nervous to try, but this recipe exceeded my expectations! Even my husband who HATES pot roast loved this, as well as my beyond-picky two-year-old. It was a definite success. I followed somone's suggestions to rub garlic powder on the meat before the flour dredge, and used water rather than vermouth in the gravy. After the meat was done cooking the gravy was WAY too salty for my family's tastes, so I just diluted it 2 to 1 with water then did the cold water/flour to thicken it and it turned out so so delicious. Thanks a ton!

Superb to say the least! This was my first time making a roast in the over, I usually use my slow cooker, and I was nervous, but it turned out fantastic.....I made a few alterations b/c I was out of a couple things. I used cream of celery soup instead of cream of mushroom, I also used a couple of cup of beef broth instead of the vermouth.  I fed it to my sister and her boyfriend and they loved it! And so did my 4 year old who is ultra picky at this point in his life......

Amazing... I used the Cream of Mushroom Soup I from this site and didnt have onion soup at hand so just substituted with beef broth and some extra onion in mushroom soup. Also used white wine instead of vermouth. Cooked for 3 hours and was so nice and tender. Boyfriend loved it, and so did I. Will definately make again!

This is a good basic recipe, but unless you like your beef well done, three hours is way too long to cook this!  I took mine out of the oven after only two hours and it was still a little over cooked.  The gravy gets 5 stars, however - VERY TASTY!!

Very good and easy recipe.  The roast came out very tender.  I did brown in olive oil instead of butter and sliced the roast after cooking and baked for a little longer in gravy.  I also added extra beef broth to get more yummy gravy.

This recipe was really good and sooo easy.  My 3 year old helped me and she ate soooo much (and she is a very picky eater).  Thank you very much for the great recipe.

I used a Grass-fed beef shoulder roast and put in my potatoes, carrots, onions and about 1 cup extra water the last hour of cooking in my LeCruset oval roaster.  Absolute perfection! The gravy was to die for.  Had enough for left overs! I will be making this again and again and again! Thank you!

Good comforting pot roast.  I added red wine instead of the vermouth, and it came out fantastic.  Will add some potatoes next time.

It was very simple and easy to make, with a delicious and great taste.  However, it wasn't as moist as I'm sure it could have been, but that might have been an error on my part.  I'm not a big fan of pot roast, but all things considered, this was a great dinner.  I substituted the vermouth with water and accidentally added a full envelope of onion soup mix instead of half.  Silly me;)  Despite my shortcomings concerning cooking, the roast was very delectable.

Pretty good. I added potatoes and baby carrots to the ceramic pot too. I roasted my 1.9 lb rump in a convection oven for an hour an a half; it came out medium done. I think a more expensive cut of beef probably will make a more juicy roast; but still this was pretty good. The gravy was great!

Fantastic! Modifications made: low sodium cream of mushroom soup, one whole sliced onion (I did not have the dry soup mix). I added a lot of pepper and fresh crushed garlic to the gravy. Yumalicious!

Very good!  I used dry white cooking wine, as that was all I had on hand, and I added two packages of brown gravy mix during the last half hour of cooking.  Thick broth, tender meat, wonderful flavor.  Definite keeper!

Very yummy! The gravy was so tasty! Served it with mashed red potatoes and steamed carrots. The only thing is that the gravy was way too thick by the time the meat was done. Next time, I will add more liquid to the gravy, as well as doubling it. There wasn't enough!

Absolutely delicious!!! The meat was so tender it pratically melted in my mouth. My husband loved it and ate left overs 2 days in a row!!! Like some of the others, I decreased the temperature and let it cook longer. This has become a family favorite.

Second time making this and it came out even better.  It is not hard to make. However, it does take time, but well worth it.  The only thing I would suggest is adding a little bit of verything for extra flavor and extra gravy sauce.  I love this dish, it is a keeper.

Excellent! So easy to prepare and tastes delicious, loved the gravy. Served it with a nice crusty bread.
And for dessert, it went really well with the Baked Apples in Caramel Cream recipe on this site. The best in comfort food!

This is a wonderful pot roast recipe.  My husband who claims to hate pot roast, loves this one. I usually deglaze the pan with the vermouth and make the gravy in the same pan.  This goes very well seved over garlic mashed potatoes from this site.

This was pretty good when I made it, needed a bit of salt, but the best part is the next day. I shredded the meat into bit sized pieces heated it up in its sauce. DELICIOUS. Ate it with some rice. I will definately be making it in stew form for my next meal.

This was a great roast, and very easy.  I didn't have vermouth so I added chicken broth, it still turned out great.  I also cut slits in my roast and stuffed garlic in before I floured and browned.

YUM!!  I was hoping for leftovers, but my guests couldn't get enough.  This was my FIRST pot roast and it came out perfect.  So easy.  Only change I made was adding a couple of sliced onions to the bottom of pot and threw in some carrots.  I'll be making this again & again.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

Great tasting!!!  I doubled the Mushroom soup for more gravy, and used a meat thermometer...Three hours way too long.  Great for family dinner!!!

This was the first pot roast I ever tried to make and it was so delicious.  My husband is the pickiest eater on the planet and totally loved and devoured it.  I didn't deviate at all from the recipe and it was perfect!

I made some changes to this recipe and still it make a very good taste. Instead of vermouth I use burgundy and used a creamed fresh mushroom, it take more time but came out excellent.

SHUT-UP,I finally had to share. This is the only pot roast I make. I tell everyone about. Dear family loves it. I always make extra for stroganoff; with egg noodles the cut up roast and the gravy. It is a perfect recipe for two meals. The only thing I changed was a larger (family size) mushroom soup for more gravy. Wonderful, kudos to Miss Becky.

This was excellent. I can't say enough about it. I used a chuck roast and used the white wine. My husband said it was the best roast he's had in a long time- and he's pretty picky. Thanks so much for sharing!!!

This is absolutely the best pot roast we've ever had.  I used chuck pot roast and followed the recipe but changing the vermouth to a dry white wine because that's what I had available.  This makes the most delicious gravy we've ever had with a pot roast.  I make redskin mashed potatoes to go with this and it is a hit every time.  I made it twice in two weeks because it was so good.  Leftovers don't stick around long with this one!

I made it in the pressure cooker and cooked it for around 45 minutes (depends on the size of the roast and how you like it done).  I also added some finely chopped shallots and 2 cloves of chopped garlic.  It was fantastic and everyone approved.  Thanks.

I deleted the vermouth, used the entire package of onion soup, added a can of condensed cream of potato soup, a sprinkling of flour, and two cups beef boullion.  Incredible gravy.

We thought this recipe was okay, but not exceptional.  The meat was very tender, but the flavor didn't wow us.  I did substitute wine for the vermouth.

I used a 2 quart round baking dish since I didn't have a larger size so the roast was totally submerged in the soup mix. I subsituted white wine for the vermouth and followed the cooking time exactly(3 hours). The meat was so tender and practically fell apart. I made gravy with the juices and it was delicious. The best pot roast I've ever eaten. Definitely will make again.

Want an alternative to the slow cooker? This is it! I added some minced garlic and substituted whiskey for the vermouth. I also cranked down the oven temp to 300 and cooked the same 3 hours. I used a chuck roast and trust me, this is the way to go...yum yum!!

I've made this recipe a few times allready.  For a long time I have been searching for a pot roast recipe with a brown gravy that was "good".  I tried and read through many pot roast recipes and none met what I was looking for.  They were either flavorless/boring/just blah.  FINALLY I have found what I've been looking for many years.  Thank you Becky, you've made my day.  It is a FANTASTIC recipe and a definate keeper!!

Great Flavor!!!!!  I agree with the others though.  The cooking time was too long.  I tried to keep an eye on it but I still managed to overcook it a tad.  I would recommend makig more of the gravy as well.  Just to have some extra.

We live in England, where the Sunday roast is a serious tradition.  Our guests said this was one of the best roasts they've ever had and shamefully asked for bread to mop up the gravy!

I made this roast for when my grandkids came over. They usually don't like anything.  They all wanted seconds and ate like troopers, their mom was so surprised.  Used Rose wine instead because I didn't have any vermouth, it was fabulous!

This recipie was great!  I would definately make it again.  However, the cooking time was a little too long and the meat was a little dry, so make sure you check the roast around 2 hours.

Simply wonderful.  I had an eye of round roast and wanted no something simple. This was simple and made it's own gravy!  I will use the butter browning method for all my roasts from now on. It probably contributed to the rich gravy color.
