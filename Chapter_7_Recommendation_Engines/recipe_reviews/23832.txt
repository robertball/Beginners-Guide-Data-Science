The meatballs for this recipe are fantastic, but the proportions for the sauce are all wrong.  There's so much tomato paste, and so little of anything else, that the whole thing ends up tasting like tomato paste.  I would go with 30 ounces of paste and 18 ounces of tomato sauce, rather than 48 ounces of paste and no sauce.  Also, throw in 2 onions instead of 1, twice as much mushroom, bay leaf, and basil, 6 (or more) garlic cloves, half a cup or so of parsely, and 2 teaspoons each of oregano and thyme.  Stand by with some sugar (a tablespoon or two) if you need to cut it further.  Also, when the porkchops simmer for 8 hours, they end up tasteless without adding anything to the sauce, so maybe put them in later.  If there's less concentrated paste flavor and more other flavors, this sauce would be great.  (Again, the meatballs are wonderful.)  But as it is, it's not worth 9 hours of your time.  (Also, this makes a lot more than 10 servings; I'd guess 15 or 20.)

I made the meatballs only.  Although I didn't care for the original recipe, my second batch was fabulous with a few modifications. ***I only used 3/4c. bread crumbs.  I used 1/2# sweet Italian pork sausage rather than ground pork and veal.  And I used an Italian Herb blend rather than just dried parsley.***  I did simmer them in jarred sauce.  Both the meatballs and sauce improved each other!  YUM, YUm, Yum, yum!

This recipe was good, but not the perfect meatballs I have been searching a LONG time for.(I'm pretty picky about my meatballs ;) Actually, I think that all they need is a little more garlic.  I must say that they did taste their best the next day and then the next day after that, as most do.  I will  be trying them again with just a wee bit of modification to "Jess-ize" them.  Thank you for sharing...

I only used the meatball recipe and made with my own pasta sauce. Everyone raved about the meatballs. Very good recipe.

I got this recipe for just the meatballs and they were horrible!
Way too many breadcrumbs and they tasted like mush.

I'm not a huge meatball lover but I made these for my husband and he enjoyed them.  I made a lot and froze them and they tasted good whenever I used them.  I really liked the parmesan flavor.  I'll make them again.

EXCELLENT!!!! Just like my grandma Palaia's recipe.  She never used meatballs so that was an added bonus. Very good.  I've never had bottled sauce in my life, but I imagine it's bad. Nothing is like homemade sauce that has been simmering for hours!

I didn't care for the meatballs or the sauce.  The Romano cheese in the meatballs was way too strong.  My other recipe uses Parmesan and it tastes much better.  The sauce was bland and tasted like paste.

I only made the meatballs and made these changes:  reduced breadcrumbs to 3/4 cup, reduced romano cheese to 3/4 cup, added some Italian seasoning, used only ground beef.  They tasted great!

Made meatballs only.  Followed suggestion from previous reviews and used only 3/4 cup bread crumbs and italian spice blend instead of just parsley. Meatballs were easy to make and were very yummy on their own (loved the romano cheese in them).  Were also great a few days later with a spaghetti sauce smothered over them.

I've made these twice now. Great meatball recipe - easy enough to modify a bit for personal preferences. (I added some Oregano for instance for a bit more Italian-kick)

I made these once with the 1/4 lb ground pork - and the 2nd time with 1/4 lb ground mild Italian sausage. Both were excellent - I liked the Italian sausage meat better.

IMPORTANT: Cut the bread crumb amount in half. I got that hint from other comments.

A very good recipe. I made a few changes: used all ground chuck ( do not get too fancy with your choice of meats for Italian meatballs), I added one minced shallot, and about 1/2 C of ricotta cheese into the meatball mix. Cooking the meatballs IN the sauce is critical. Anything else and you just made dogfood.

Meatballs were great  - I did reduce the breadcrumbs as suggested above.  Sauce was only OK - a little boring.  I made for my husband and a few friends everyone ate it and said they enjoyed it but I thought it was bland (and my husband agreed).

Difficult to find ground veal in my area but meatballs were delicious with just beef/pork combo. Will definitely be making this again
