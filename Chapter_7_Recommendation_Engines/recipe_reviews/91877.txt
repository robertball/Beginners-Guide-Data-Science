I made the recipe per instructions. Found it was lacking........so I went ahead and fixed the flavor. I added a bunch of crushed gingersnaps and about a 1/4 cup of brown sugar. Carefully blended in and it made a nice gravy. Finished it up with a T. of butter to bend flavors. Much better. Next time I think I will use red wine vinegar for a better flavor right off. Served it with german noodles and green peas.

1.17.17   Edwina Hoffer, I don’t know if your grandmother was from Germany, but my husband’s was, and our Christmas meal is sauerbraten, been making it for years from scratch.  The first thing I do is marinate the beef roast for 5-6 days, and reserve and use some of the marinade to make gravy later.  This recipe’s  beef does not have the flavor benefit from marinating, so this makes the gravy VERY important, and this is where this recipe disappoints.  Upfront I had reservations about this recipe, but I don’t like changing it much the first time, so I prepared it as written.  The beef drippings that you get from roasting adds great flavor to the gravy, but this quick-cooked beef can’t do that.  The beef was plenty tender, but the gravy tasted just like vinegar and water, and there’s no way that you can thicken this into a gravy with the flour and water amounts listed in the recipe.  In order to salvage this meal, I first had to add a little sugar, added a bit more flour-water, but also added some crushed gingersnaps that I always keep on hand for sauerbraten.  This not only helps thicken the gravy but adds incredible, true sauerbraten flavor.  I’m going to make this again because I like how quick and easy it is in the pressure cooker, but I’ll use a good-quality beef broth instead of water, cider vinegar, and then as above, incorporate the gingersnap crumbs into the gravy.  Sorry for the less than favorable review, but IMO this recipe needs tweaking.

I used the Dutch oven method with a few tweaks: Cut stew beef into 1 inch pieces.Coat beef with flour before browning.Use red wine vinegar.  Stick to 1 cup. Add 1 sliced onion- 1/2 during browning, 1/2 just before adding liquids.Add 2 cloves of garlic at end of browning.  It was delish over noodles!!

I decided to try this recipe with some venison stew meat.I have made sauerbraten the traditional way and loved everything about it except the time it takes to marinate.This method therefore was perfect for me.I did decide to modify it according to my own recipe and it was enjoyed by all.(My recipe calls for a whole chopped onion which is browned after the meat,a couple of tablespoons of sugar on the browned meat and a tablespoon of pickling spice which I put in a tea infuser and added to the liquid) I didn't have my pressure cooker with me so I simmered this on the stove for two hours.Thanks so much for the recipe as I never would have considered using anything but a roast for sauerbraten!!

I followed the directions very closely, and it tasted like vinegar.  I would recommend using 2.5 cups of water and maybe 1/2 cup vinegar.  I will have to experiment first.

Added approx. 1  teaspoon sugar to meat prior to other seasoning after browning...(as others suggested) . added a few dashes of Ginger (would like to try gingersnaps next time  as suggested) ... added about 3/4 packet of mushroom gravy packet (no kitchen bouquet ) and used beef broth in place of water.  I added about 8 mushrooms sliced and about 1/4 of a large sweet onion which I sautéed after the meat.  I used apple cider vinegar in place of white vinegar.  Was VERY good - meat fell apart so much it ended up being a meat sauce instead of cubes of meat.... cooked slow in crockpot.   Added the flour/water at the end to thicken even with the addition of the mushroom gravy packet/was still needed.  Served over egg noodles but would have preferred  spätzle noodles to be more authentic.  Was as close as you can get to the flavor without the week long wait.  Delish!  Served asparagus spears on the side.  Would have given 4 stars but needed many tweeks as stated by other raters, thankfully they did a great job with the notes!  Nice base recipe (thanks so much!) 
but with the tweeks it was very, very good!

Pretty good recipe. I added noodles and it tasted 100% better. I think 1 cup of vinegar is a little much, so next time I will use less. I also added 2-3 extra tablespoons of flour to help with the consistency. The meat is very tender so it is a great meal for little ones as well. :)
