Beautiful Puffy cookies.  I think that is in the separate mixing/beating of each egg.  I just found that I'd like it a little sweeter next time and might try doubling the vanilla, but the kids made them for Santa, and he seemed to love them!

These were super good! They're nice and fluffy and taste great. I love easy recipes that taste good. I did add more vanilla, too but that's nothing new since I always do. Thanks!

These cookies are awesome. I added chopped dried cherries and chopped pecans.I will be giving these as gifts over the holidays.Some reviewers said the cookies went flat. I think it's important that you measure the flour before sifting rather than after...just a hint

These are the best darned cookies- my husband cannot stop eating them. I make just 1 change, use 2 tsps of vanilla instead of one. They are even richer.

I put in butterscotch chips, some peanut butter, and a packet of vanilla pudding mix and they turned out delicious. I'd cut the coacoa in half as its a little rich!

I don't know where the puffy part enters into it, they were just regular flat chocolate cookies.  They had very good chocolate flavor, but I had to add about 1/4 cup more of flour because the batter just spread so much in the oven that it was impossible to get the cookie on the spatual in one piece.  It still happened after adding more flour, but not as extreme.  I'd reccomend them, but do add extra flour or forget it!

These were very tasty.  After reading some other reviews, I increased the vanilla to 2 tsp.  I also only had one cup of chocolate chips left so that is all I used in the cookies, but I liked them that way.  They are fluffy and tender, somewhere between a cookie and a brownie and a cake.  They stay moist on the inside even after they are fully cooled.

YUMMMMMY! This is my new chocolate chip cookie  recipe :-) I've been searching for the perfect one, and  finally found it. The cookies come out soft and perfectly puffy. I also doubled the vanilla, but i usually do that, and added a little extra brown sugar too. Im not a big chocolate cookie fan, so i only put about a tablespoon of the cocoa powder in. It gave it that extra goodness. Everyone loved them.

Perfect as is. My chocoholic hubby proclaims them his new favorite. I do think the quality of the chocolate chips is important. We love not-too-sweet chocolate and these are perfect.
