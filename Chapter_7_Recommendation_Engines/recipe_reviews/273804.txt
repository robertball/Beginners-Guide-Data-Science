Added cilantro to the blender because we love it but other than that I made as written. The veggies are nowhere near charred at 5 minutes. I ended up broiling them on high for 15 minutes. This has good flavor and it is one I will make again.

Loved the mix, spice and lime juice! Just used 4 not 6 garlic and coconut oil. Good with chips and on tacos
