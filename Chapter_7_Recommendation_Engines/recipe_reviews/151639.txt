Excellent!  Everyone should try this.  You would never guess one of the main ingredients is soup.  It tastes like you spent a long time making it, and the whole thing took only 20 minutes.  At first, I was concerned that it was too liquidy and thin, but it's not.  Once you pour it on the rice, the rice soaks up all the sauce and you have some buttery, creamy rice.  It's delicious and you don't need to change a thing.

I rated this recipe with 5 stars; based on the following changes:  Change the green peppper to 1 clove of garlic and the 1/2 cup of water to 1 cup of wine and add 3 tablespoons more butter.  You need the extra liquids to have a sauce to pour over your rice.  My husband was thrilled; he wants me to make it again next week!

This recipe is so easy and will become a regular in our house. There's plenty of sauce for the rice,if you like a saucy dish. I did add extra cayenne pepper, as we like our dishes little on the spicy side. Also, when I added the shrimp I used a little more margarine in the pan.

This dish is very good.  Only change I made was I put the shrimp in after putting in the soup and water and mixing it thoroughly.  Felt like shrimp came out perfectly cooked.  I also let it sit for a couple minutes before serving.

Followed the advice of others and used Cream of Shimp soup.  Also, I added some Old Bay Seasoning and Emeril's Essence to the soup mixture.  Great flavor.  Look forward to making it again.

I also used cream of shrimp soup and added a can of rotel.  Instead of water, I used seafood stock.  This was quick and delicious.

Used 1 cup of red wine instead of 1/2 cup of water.  3 cups of spinach in place of celery and green pepper. 1 table spoon of lemon juice, and a full stick of butter and other ingredients remained the same.

Simple and quick to prepare and it comes out very nicely at that.  I made it pretty much exactly as directed, but added a little salt.  I thought that it took the shrimp a very long time to cook just in the butter and vegetable juices, so I added a squirt of veggie broth I happened to have in the fridge.  I didn't measure the water I added after the condensed soup, just started out slowly and made sure the sauce was neither too thick nor too runny.  There's some room for variation here - next time I might try Cream of Shrimp-Soup instead, a dash of Worcestershire Sauce and maybe some Creole Seasoning or Old Bay Spice. But I will definitely make this again.

This Dish was Very Good. I did take the suggestion of the cream of Shrimp soup and it was great. I can't eat chicken so that was the perfect replacement. Thank you for the recipe. Loved it!
