With any of these, texture can be an issue, but my 3yo and I really enjoyed this! It is easy to make (especially with my kid) and can be "dressed up" with other toppings that you have on hand. We used blue berries and it was great. Next time I might up the cinnamon for my personal taste, but overall a good recipe!

So yummy! We used peaches in place of bananas and added a tad more sugar. Our whole family liked it!

Just like a loaf of banana bread! I halved the recipe for a very very full 500mL jar and did not add yogurt in the morning.
