I used this recipe as a springboard and am rating it 5 stars using my changes: doubled the gr. beans, add 1/2 C mushrooms sauteed with onion. I didn't dice the onion, left it in strips and sauteed til transparent. Was out of worcestershire, so I added a little more soy (didn't miss it.) Skipped the salt since soy sauce is salty. Used Wisconsin extra sharp white cheddar. LOVED it!

This is a great recipe lots of flavor. I doubled the beans. I didn't use fresh I used canned beans two of them. I also added fresh mushrooms that I sauteed with the onion. I also added a lil more than a 1/4 cup of sour cream. I omitted the w. chestnuts just cause i don't like them. All in all this was a great dish. Definitely more flavor than the same recipe everyone is used to.

This was really yummy.  I omitted the hot pepper sauce and added 4 pieces of crumbled bacon.  I live in Montreal and had a hard time finding the French-Fried onion rings.  No one even knew what I was talking about--strange since it's a French province!  Anyway, I substitued chow mein noodles which gave it a nice crunch.  Everyone loved it!  Thanks so much for sharing...

I definately suggest doubling the green beans in this recipe or you have a mushroom soup with green beans instead of the other way around! I found it really salty as well, so I'll probably make a few adjustments next time.

Very good, very rich - used less cheese (no way I was using 3 cups), more beans, less salt.  Will make again.  BTW - not runny at all.

I usually stick to the recipe as is the first time I make it so I can rate it correctly.  However, I did have to make a few small changes due to what I had on hand.  I had about 3-4 cups of beans and wanted to use them up so I used them all.  I only had 2 cups of cheese instead of 3 cups but to tell you the truth, that really seemed to be enough. The last thing was that I didn't have the fried onions to put on top but it was still delicious.  Either way I believe it was a 5.  Nice little change to the common Green Bean Casserole.

This was a really great recipe!  I did add some of the French's Onions to the actual recipe right before cooking as well as putting them on the top.  I also increased the hot pepper sauce to 1/4 tsp instead to add just a slight bit of zing.  It was a hit on Thanksgiving!

This was good and a nice change from the regular green bean casserole, but I thought there was just a tad too much of the soy/Worchestershire taste.  If I make it again I would tone that down.  By the way, to be perfectly upfront, I did not use water chestnuts at all.

Good recipe, just a bit salty. I omit the salt since there is soy sauce, and mushroom soup. That helps quite a bit.

Very good, creamy, oniony taste.  A little on the soupy side - wouldn't hurt to use more beans than suggested.

I get requests every time we get together for holiday meals to make this.  left out the worcestershire sauce and sub cream of celery cuz some people don't like mushrooms.  Otherwise right on. The water chestnuts really add to it.

I made this for Thanksgiving and my family loved it!  I used canned green beans (2 cans of french-cut), skipped the onion because I don't like onions, and left the rest as is.  LOVED the water chestnuts!!

This was great, nice spice.  The beans cook a lot while baking, so make sure you don't overcook in the steaming!

Delicious dish..Very easy, and flavorable. I basically followed the recipe as written except I used 2 cans of green beans, instead of layering the beans with the mushroom soup mixture I heated all Ingredients in a pot then transferred to a casserole dish, topped with the dried onions then in the oven till bubbly. My husband and I loved it. Great the next day too. Thx for sharing!

This is a thanksgiving side dish tradition in my family, but instead of using regular fresh cut green beans we use 2 cans of French style green beans and add chopped bacon in the beans. My favorite!!

Oh My Goodness!!!!! This is a top notch recipe. Quick to put together and stress-free. Made it last minute on a super busy evening and it turned out amazing. It's a great twist on regular green beans. I would definitely recommend this recipe to anyone and everyone!

P.S. mix the bacon throughout the green beans for extra flavor!

I've never really liked traditional green bean casserole, but when assigned this dish for Thanksgiving I gave this one a try.  Using fresh green beans makes ALL the difference!  I omitted the salt, used low sodium soy sauce and only 1 Tbsp of the worchestershire & 2 c cheese.  Didn't have the water chestnuts to add.  Everyone loved this.  I thought the flavor was wonderful!  Thank you so much.

This recipe has been a huge hit at my Thanksgiving dinner for two years now. The flavor is great and the extra crunchyness from the water chestnuts is the perfect compliment to the yummy cheese!

Wow!  The flavors in this casserole were VERY STRONG.  I will probably try it again, double the beans and keep the rest as is.  My husband and I only ate 1/3 of the casserole tonight and I need to find a way to salvage it for leftovers!
