i'm going to admit that i cannot give a true review b/c i altered so much.. but i would still like to submit what i did so i can go back in the future.. i almost never carry canned tomato products in my house so i usually just substitute fresh with great results.. i cut this recipe in half and used a roma tomato and a baby jalapeno for the canned stuff.. didn't have asparagus so used broccoli instead.. i only had a half of a bell pepper in the fridge so i used that for the 1 1/2 listed.. i used 1 T of bottled lemon juice for the lemon and left out the zest.. me and bf weren't in the mood for cheese in this and i'm serving his portion over rice instead of noodles.. i had to heavily salt this after it was done and i splashed a bit more lemon and sprinkled cilantro over my bowl.. this is very healthy.. but not something i was impressed with.. UPDATE: bf had this for dinner several hours after i had submitted my review.. having been able to sit, this actually tasted really good.. so i'm going to change my rating from 3 to 4

I made this for dinner tonight and my husband and I loved it!  I used regular spaghetti because that's what I had. I didn't have asparagus so I used broccoli and green beans because that is what I had on hand.  It's a great recipe to make substitutions because of all the vegetables.  Will be making this again!

Thought it was good but found it almost too spicy even for us and we love spicy. Great way to use lots of  summer veggies. Will make again perhaps with fresh tomatoes and chilies so I can control the heat.

I'm so glad I tried this recipe.  I tasted great and it is pretty healthy with all the vegetables.  It takes a little work but it is worth it.  I like that it is a whole meal.  You can add a green salad if you want, but it is really not necessary with all the vegetables in this dish.  I made the dish as written with the exception of substituting green beans for asparagus and shell pasta for no yolk egg noodles because those are what I had on hand.  I will definitely make it again.

I loved this recipe!  It's often hard to find a healthy pasta dish without all the sauces, but this 
one had great flavor, texture and looked pretty too.  I will definitely try this with company. Easy and pretty quick.

Very yummy flavor and best of all it was easy and fast! You can even make it faster by having all the veggies pre-chopped. The next time I make this I will make  one small adjustment. The asparagus and squash came out a little soggy so I would suggest adding those the last 5 minutes of cooking.

Delicious.  I substituted the egg noodles with wheat pasta, and chose canned tomatoes without the chile peppers.  Instead, to add some spice, I used a red pepper olive oil to rub into the chicken strips.  A whole onion was too much in my opinion, so I used 1/2.  Also, make sure you use the largest pan you have as there are so many veggies going into this!

Followed directions exactly. This meal was tasty with the spicy ingredients, noodles, veggies and sprinkling of cheese. Satisfying, filling but not a heavy meal. Starred this recipe as a new FAVORITE!

Healthy and delicious! The perfect combination. I overloaded the veggies a little bit, but it turned out great.

Very flavorful. I didn't add the Cajun spice and used some leftover fresh vegetables I had on hand. Didn't have noodles so i used some other pasta noodles I had. Delish!

My husband and I loved it.  I substituted with vegetables that I had:  fresh tomato (instead of canned), green beans, broccoli, green pepper, onion, zucchini.  We don't like too spicy so I only put a couple of dashes of red pepper (I didn't have cajun).  Served over penne pasta.  Great taste.

I made this for the first time and I thought it was amazing. I did leave out a few items and made a few modifications as I was pressed for time, but I will include them next time I make this recipe. The items I left out were, lemon zest, asparagus and garlic. The adjustments made was to not include the chicken in the vegetable mix. Instead I fried it with the herbs until I got a crispy cajun style texture and color. This complimented the meal along with releasing the flavors of the herbs and seasoning.  I squeezed fresh limes and used fresh thyme. I also used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth.

Once again a great recipe from this site!  My only complaint is that it was a little watery from the canned tomatoes.  It had just enough kick to it to be a little spicy, but still mild enough to enjoy all the wonderful flavors.  I'm so glad there are only two of us so that I can take the leftovers for my lunch tomorrow.

Looked like this would take a long time based on the number of ingredients, but it really didn't take that long.  Didn't have lemon pepper or asparagus. Used bottled crushed tomato sauce instead instead of tomatoes with chiles because that's what I had on hand.  Cut up 3 chicken breasts to make tenders and got 4 large servings.  Served with salad on the side.  Adding to my list of dinners for when the kids come over.

This would be a 5 star, except it's not my kind of dish. I am more of a comfort food guy. The chicken was great. My Seasoning was only different in that  I used Old Bay, which gave a nice subtle kick.  I used broccoli, orange bell pepper, asparagus, white onion, and garlic basil flavored diced tomatoes. For my wife this was a 5 plus star, make-it-again-soon dish. I didn't use mushrooms, which she loves, but I can't eat. I know, I'm crazy, right? I added a photo. I will make again. I have to!

I eliminated the peppers because I didn't want a spicy dish. I added green beans and kept the recipe pretty much as written. It was excellent. Very good sources for eating  vegetables .

Really really good. I didn't have some of the veggies on hand and I Ieft the pasta out to make it low carb, but it was still great. I only used green & red peppers, asparagus, carrots, garlic & the canned Rotal. The lemon and Rotel added a really nice bite to the dish. This is getting added to the rotation for sure.
