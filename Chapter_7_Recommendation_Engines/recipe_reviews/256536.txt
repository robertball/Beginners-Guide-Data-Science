Great flavor, I ended up making this tasty mixture into fajita quesadillas by melting cheddar cheese with the fajita mixture on a tortilla browned with veggie oil to make it that much better. Didn't even need sour cream or guacamole, though those would enhance it even more!

Teens loved it but requested I cut the peppers thinner next time. Easy and delicious! Definitely one for heavy rotation.

Used all green bell peppers. My husband and I loved it! We just added sour cream and used whole wheat tortillas. Next time will add salsa and cheese! This will be a regular in my house!

Quick and easy, it makes for a fast meal.  Be sure to add a little salt and pepper to the chicken.
