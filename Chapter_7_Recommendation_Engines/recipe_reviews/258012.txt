I used street tortillas. They are smaller. Fit the tin and have less carbs per serving.

Great find recipe. First batch was per recipe. Love pizza and liked the simplicity of this recipe enough to make again, several times, but have developed several options. First if you don't have a cookie cutter, use a band from pint sized jar, lay on  tortilla and on cutting board trace edge lightly with serrated knife - easy and fast. For recipe I use Dei Fratelli pizza sauce (best), but add @ 1-2 tsp sugar to cut acidic of tomatoes. Have tried different cheese's but my long time personal favorite is a mix of mozzerella and provolone. Fine dice some onions, and can use pepperoni, salami,  diced chicken,  precooked sweet sausage (my fav), etc.,  for topping. If you only make 12 or so, you'll have a lot of cheese, sauce, and toppings left over. So while you have all the stuff out and the oven hot, think about making more batches, let them cool then freeze. They make excellent snacks (allow to thaw or reheat in microwave), especially for school or office.

These were super fun and super easy. The hardest part was getting the mason jar lid to cut the pizza crust. It definitely takes some muscle power but they turn out so cute in the end you'll be glad you did it. I had a handful of sliced olive that needed used so I threw them in there too. You could pretty much put anything in them you like. Super fun recipe and one I will not only make again but will I be trying other toppings and varieties. Thanks for sharing!

I used the small street sized flour tortillas whole and just a baking sheet. Easy peasy.

I made this according to the recipe but I made it easier to cut the tortillas. I used a sharp knife to outline the Mason jar lid and then used scissors to cut them out. Yummy!

I used street corn tortillas. I fried in my cast iron pan and yes, it was really good. I had to use Mexican cheese as i couldn't find my mozzarella.  Really good.i will be making again.
