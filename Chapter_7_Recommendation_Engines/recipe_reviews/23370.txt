This is great but I add 1 TBS. of horse radish or to taste instead of onion and top with thin slice of pepporoni.

These are wonderful! The second time I made them with Swiss cheese instead of Parmesan and they were even better.

These are so easy and absolutely delicious.  We used them in our cheesy day at work and they were a tremendous hit.

I made this spread up the night before and just put it on the bread when i was ready to put it in the oven. I also added some finely grated old cheddar as well. This turned out great and my company raved about it. Good onion flavour and the smell is fantastic while it is cooking. Will make this again.

These were a grrrreat idea! I improvised a little - I used red onion, and added dried parsley and a bit of garlic powder to the mixture. I put it in a little food processor and it worked great! It took like 5 minutes and it looked like a gourmet spread because of the beautiful colors from the red onion and parsley. I also used a baguette and sliced them real thin. I spread the topping on the bread about an hour before the party and then when people got there threw them in the oven for about 15 minnutes, until they were golden brown. They smelled delicious and were delicious even when they weren't hot anymore!

I love these.  Had them at a party and loved them so much I got the recipe and had them special made for the cocktail hour at our wedding.  Now I make them for every party just to tide people over.  I use a little less mayo than this recipe calls for.  But I'm sure it's fabulous too!

These are some RICH and delicious little toasty bites!!!  I loved them!  It's good because they are so rich you can really only eat 2 or 3 but they are SO GOOD!!  I did not blend anything out of laziness but chopped the onion very tiny.  Left in the oven about 20 to 25 minutes to ensure the onions were cooked.  Definitely will make again!

Yummy!  My mom used to make these when I was a kid!  I spotted the cocktail rye at the store today and snagged it, came home and searched for the recipe!  Thanks for posting it!  LOVE these things!

A huge hit at my recent party.  I had a number of appetizers that I served and this one was the most popular.  What's great is that the effort to make it is minimal.  This one is a keeper!!

I did not like this recipe at all.  It was too onion-y and the bread got soggy by the end of the evening.

I have been making these for many years as an appetizer for parties and for myself. :0). Just love them! You can really use any type of cheese. I like grated cheddar the best but, use whatever I have on hand. A little Worcestershire or Tabasco gives it a little kick if that is what you are looking for. Crumbled bacon and other toppings like veggies are good too.
