I was curious about this recipe, wondering how it would turn out with uncooked veggies in mayo type sauce....it was amazing!! My husband, who doesn't care for fish much, LOVED it!   Used lite mayo and while sauce was a bit thin, was perfect with sushi rice and snap peas.  Follow the recipe...it's perfect.

I halved the ingredients for 2 people and had lunch the next day too. Didn't add the sugar for lower carbs. This was knock our socks off yummy. We both couldn't get over how flavorful and how well the fish was cooked for cooking so long. I think cutting it in bite sized pieces helped cook evenly, and the mushroom sauce on top was thick and so kept the fish from burning.  Was also surprised that halibut is so costly right now. We'll save it for special friends and splurges for ourselves. Great recipe.

I did change a few things: I used vegenaise instead of mayonnaise, because I wanted to cut out dairy. I also used extra chili garlic sauce, and toasted the sesame seeds. Thrown on a bed of fresh arugula, it was one of the best meals I've had this month!

The flavors were unbelievable. Very sushi-ish which we love as well. The only change I made was I used Ono since I didn't have halibut in the freezer. If I were to change anything up, next time I'll use a nice tuna steak and use only the broiler so it turns out nice and rare. I get intimidated cooking fish when I can't see it cuz I don't want to overcook it. Since the fish was buried in this delicious mushroom mixture I had to go digging to watch the cooking progress. With tuna, rare is better which takes off some pressure there. Thanks for the great recipe! (If by chance the tuna doesn't pan out well, I'll go back to your method!)

The mayo keeps the halibut moist and I like the flavors, but no WOW factor.

This was great!  My husband ate this over about 3 days to polish off the leftovers.  This is DEFINITELY going into my kitchen "sure-things" list.  The only things I did different were to leave out the mushrooms and chop the onions instead of slicing.

Recipe was really delicious but I almost burned it and set off the smoke alarm.  You only broil it for 5 minutes not for 10 minutes if you are just making it for 2 people.  Also make sure to draw all the water off the halibut by drying it out with paper towels.

Used this recipe with a combination of halibut and cod for supper tonight.  Quick and easy to prepare - tasted great.  Substituted a fat free, non soy mayonnaise and used Splenda rather than sugar. The broiling took less than 5 minutes.  Would not hesitate to serve to company and/or use with another white fish.

I just made this with African pompano instead of the halibut seems like this would go well with any firm fish, It was excellent, mom says this is a guest for dinner kind of meal...

I didn’t have mushrooms, but feel that the recipe was still delicious. The sesame oil gives it an Asian flavor that is great. Next time, I will slice the fish into thinner slices prior to cooking as halibut tends to turn out somewhat dry when cooking. The sauce makes it perfect, so make sure to coat the fish well. Also, I think a bit of Siricha mixed in with the sauce or drizzled over the finished product would make a nice touch.

All great. Didn’t have chili garlic sauce so used sriracha instead. Came out beautifully and didn’t move baking sheet to top rack to broil. Just left in place on center rack and broiled. Turn out beautifully.

This is a solid recipe!  I've made a lot of halibut over the years and this put a fresh spin on things.  Wife and kids ate it up.  Will be doing this again and try subbing with the wine.

LOVE. One of my all-time favorites. I would serve this once a week if my husband would let me :-) The only problem is I can  never find halibut so I usually use swordfish. Any other suggestions for halibut substitutions?

Very good! Cooked for 15 minutes at 375 using convection bake then 5 minutes on Broil. I  didn't put in the sugar that it called for and it didn't need it.  Otherwise, I made the recipe as it said and it was magnifico!  Great "gourmet" type dish.  Sure to please any and all company!

It was delicious. Only issue was the cook on the fish. To solve this dish I would suggest a sautée on the onions and shrooms and pan sear the Halibut. Flavors were awesome though!

What a treat! This really lived up to its name! The fish was moist and  enhanced by the mild Asian flavors and mushrooms. I added a topping of Panko crumbs and dill during the last 10 minutes. Made a nice crunchy crust.

I made the mistake in one of the last steps, to move the dish to the upper level in the oven, and inceasing the temperature too much. The mayonaise sauce splitted - but the taste was still very good. Will certainly make this recipe again, but then with more caution.

I'll admit I am not a fish person. This recipe was OK.  I wouldn't make it again.  I wouldn't buy halibut again.

I follow the recipe each time I've made it since my husband's epic fishing trip to Kodiak, Alaska a few years ago.  The only change I've made is to add the sesame seeds before broiling step.  The kids and husband all LOVE this.  It's dynamite, especially when you caught your own halibut!

This was one of the best recipes I've ever tried!  I needed up cooking it for about another 5-7 min because the piece of halibut was fairly think.  Added red pepper slices and garlic shoots around the sides and took them out after broiling and before the additional 5-7 minutes added of baking time.

We love our halibut and we really enjoyed this recipe.  Added a little more chill sauce then called for and it was still not overly hot.

I wasn't a big fan.  It was ok, but I would not make it again.  Prefer just grilling or pan frying the fish.  I will say though that i made it with half Halibut and half Sea bass.  I like it with the sea bass much better.

This was really good a quick. Tasted just like a dynamite roll!! Next time I will switch Greek yogurt for mayonnaise to cut the fat way down.

Very delicious! I made it exactly as the recipe asks, except I used tilapia because I couldnt find halibut at my local store at the time. I served it over a bed of rice. My husband couldnt get enough of it! I wish I had doubled the recipe! It was so simple I will definitely be making it again.

Very nice dish but could use a little bit more kick and depth.  I doubled up on the chili-garlic sauce which was still pretty mild for me and my wife but we do like spicy foods.  I will keep this recipes in the catalog and recommend it to others.

Always looking for new halibut recipes to try.  Really enjoyed this one!  Halved the ingredients - turned out great - used Siracha (sp) sauce instead of garlic chili so a bit spicy.

This was so good that I cooked it twice in one week after my husband brought home fresh halibut from Alaska. It is amazing - quick and tons of flavor. Omitted the sliced onions and found that cooking the mushrooms separately in garlic and oil and adding them at serving gave it some more flavor.
