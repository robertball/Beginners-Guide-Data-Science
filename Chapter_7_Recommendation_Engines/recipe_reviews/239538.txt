This was a hit with our house! I would have rated it 5 stars, but as written, I needed to add some seasoning. (I do understand that the recipe submitter was trying to keep the sodium low, can I rate this 4.5?!) I added about a teaspoon each of garlic salt and paprika to the flour mixture and some Montreal seasoning to the beef mixture.  I really like that I could make this part of the meal earlier in the day and then have time later to focus on the side dishes instead of doing it all at the same time. We will definitely make this again!

This was absolutely delicious!!  My
Husband loved it. 

I inadvertently left the milk out but it didn't affect it at all. We don't like celery so I left that out too. Added additional mushrooms. 

Will definitely make again!

LOVED IT! I messed up my burger patties and they crumbled it the crock pot, but it was still awesome on top of baked potatoes!

I made this. As a new cook, I wasn't a fan of how not specific the instructions are since I basically know nothing about cooking. However, I made this and it turned out great. I sprinkled a tiny bit of salt once it was on the plate and it was great.

No changes and the steaks came out nice and moiste and they weren't tough.  Maybe the secret was I didn't cook them all the way done so when they finished cooking in the crockpot they weren't tough.

Delicious! My husband helped me with putting it together while camping. Everyone loved it. I substituted a can of cream of chicken for one of the mushroom soups. Perfect for a fall evening!

The gravy is delicious.  I did add about a half cup of red wine just because there was a bottle open in the frig.  

I will definitely make this again.
