Pretty good idea.  I used about 2lbs of chicken tenders and maybe about 1/2 cup of ceasar ranch dressing with a few cloves of garlic.  I let it marinate overnight.  Then I rolled the strips in parmesan cheese instead of breadcrumbs because I don't like to eat too many carbs.  Then I baked at 400 degrees for about 10-15 mins on each side.  It was good.

I liked that this chicken came out moist, it was baked, not fried and that it was super simple.  I was, however, not impressed with the flavor, something is missing.  My mom and I both agree that the predominant flavor was the bread crumbs.  I think that I will try this again, but a little different.  I may try it on chicken breasts, and turn it into chicken parm, or I may use ranch dressing instead of caesar.

Very Good!  I added some garlic salt and onion powder to plain bread crumbs in order to bump up the flavor a little bit.  I also let the chicken marinade for almost 24hrs before I cooked it, but it was delicious when it was done!

This was ok, but nothing to write home about.  I used top quality Caesar-style dressing, but I had to almost DOUBLE THE COOKING TIME! It turned out crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, but I did not like the taste.  Very artificial - if you'd like plain chicken dipped in salad dressing, go for this one.  It was easy to make, I'll give it that...

These were just ok for me.  I found the caesar dressing to be a bit strong for my taste.  I liked the idea of these however next time I will try a different dressing to marinade the tenders in.

I tend to look for recipes for the meal at hand so I didn't have time to marinate the chicken. It still came out good with only 15 min.s or so in the dressing!

I marinated the chicken in some leftover Greek tztaziki sauce that I had and a squeeze of lemon juice.  Then I breaded it in panko crumbs.  It turned out very tender and good.  It was very garlicky from the sauce.

I am with other people on this recipe.  Very tender chicken.  Breading was not great - I even tried to add a lot of parmesan cheese to it so that it wouldn't be so bready.  I love caesar dressing, so was hoping for more of the taste - I think it just made it moist and that was it.  Not sure how to tweak it to make it better...

I used creamy caesar dressing and crushed Italian croutons instead of bread crumbs and it turned out pretty flavorful and yummy. Also was yummy on top of my salad for lunch. Wouldn't call this a 5 star... it's more of a quick family meal than something special but it was tastier than some of the other reviews, i believe because of the croutons.

This was good.  The chicken had to be cooked for an additional 15 minutes, but we used breasts instead of tenders.

This recipe was very simple and easy to make. I cut my chicken into strips and marinated over night. I made my own bread crumbs. The chicken turned out delicious and my boyfriend loved it. I'm repeating the recipe again this weekend.

Caesar dressing is not usually a very good marinade in my opinion. Try something with a little more oil...a nice Italian vinaigrette for example. It gave it a little more of a kick (you can eliminate the extra garlic) and kept it nice and moist on the inside. 25 minutes at 350 was about right...let sit for 5 more minutes.

I actually used blue cheese dressing instead of Caesar (as that is what I had on hand) and it was still delicious.  The recipe is easy and tasty!

This was not tasty even with parmesan added to bread crumbs.  It was so not worth the calories to my hubby and I.

I made this recipe yesterday for a party.  I slightly pounded the chicken first.  It was so juicy and tender that it literally broke apart with a fork.  I also added Italian seasoning and parmesan to the bread crumbs since others reviews stated that it lacked flavor.  It was a big hit.

This recipe was good. I used 3 pounds of chicken tenders with the same amount of Marinade. Instead of regular bread crumbs I made bread crumbs out of caesar style croutons. I mixed a cup of those with a cup of parmesan and it was perfect! I made sure that a little of the dressing stayed on the chicken as well.

we did not like this at all. It was bland and limp. I took the leftovers and cut them into small strips and made a stir fry just to use the chicken up.

Very moist and tasty.  I was out of Caesar dressing and used 1/2 cup Spicy Ranch dressing [Hidden Valley] instead.  Kept in the garlic because we love it with almost anything.  A big winner!

We really liked this. I used italian bread crumbs after reading the other reviews and I think it gave a better flavor over all. My family loves garlic so we used 1/2 again the amount called for. We have placed it on salad, along side a pasta and sauce side as well as with mashed potatoes and gravy. They all seem to work well with the flavors. I know we will make this again.
