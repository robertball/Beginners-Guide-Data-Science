I had to do some adapting based on what I had, but this is a great base recipe.  With more veggies, I don't think you need the sausage. It would make a great vegetarian soup. My adaptations, if you care, were: I used canned diced tomatoes as the base for the puree.  I roasted garlic, red and yellow peppers, sweet potatoes, broccoli, and carrots.  I had no onion to roast, so I used onion flakes when cooking the sausage.  I added some of the roasted vegetables along with the garlic to the tomatoes to puree.  I only had sweet Italian sausage, so I added about 1/4 teaspoon of red pepper flakes, and about 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper to give it some spice (not needed, but I like spicy). Then I did the whole thing in the crock pot.  about an hour on low to soften the kale, and then about 2 hours on high once you add the veggies.  Add water, salt & pepper as needed.

I tried this recipe and loved it. I got kale in my veggie co-op and didn't know what it was.  I also got butternut squash, and potatoes, so this recipe was perfect.  I only had Jimmy Dean breakfast sausage, so I used it.  It tastes great in there!  I didn't have the right seasonings so I liberally applied Italian seasoning and crushed red pepper.  I also used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth, because it was all I had available.  The mix of the beans, squash, meat, potato, broth and chickpeas is really good.  And the kale... I like it!  I never knew it until now.  I will be adding this recipe to my list of things to make on a regular basis!!  (Even if I don't get kale in my co-op box again!) NOTE: The picture does not do justice to this recipe!  Mine is BEAUTIFUL with all the bright colors in it.  I'll try to take a picture!)

Of course I changed the recipe a bit. Less evoo, no beans or chick peas (forgot to buy them) but it was AAmaZing!!!  Try it!!! Super healthy. 
My editions are: peal the skin off the butternut squash before cooking and do not include the stems in the kale. Trim the leaves off first. Great recipe. Easy. I feed 30 people at my house once a month and this is my favorite recipe so far!!!!

Good recipe. An earthier, more hearty take on minestrone. Next time I may go with a different type of sausage just to tweak it, but I will definitely keep in the recipe box.

Oh, this was so good. My whole family loved it. I followed the recipe exactly except I used homemade chicken broth instead of vegetable as I didn't have any, but other than that I stayed true to it as written. I have to say this makes a lot of soup though - I'd say 8-10 servings rather than six as it is very filling.

This is a DELICIOUS recipe! I've gotten rave reviews from everyone who has tried it. I did substitute canellini beans for the garbanzoes (my husband doesn't like garbanzoes), Jimmy Dean breakfast sausage for the Italian sausages, and a sweet potato for the Yukon gold. Do be aware that the 1-1/2 hour time is WAY low. I don't think I'm THAT slow. Maybe that time would be right with a hubby or someone helping with cutting and peeling, but if you're doing it by yourself, be prepared for it to take closer to 3 hours from start to finish. But if you have the time, it's well worth the trouble!

I really loved this recipe.  I omitted the sausage and made a fabulous vegetable soup.  I added turnips and used cannelini beans instead of kidney.  Delicious!  I would definitely chunk and roast my root veggies beforehand for a softer texture.

Wow, this soup is delicious. The roasted veggies and pan drippings add so much flavor. I included the kidney bean liquid in the soup. I substituted a can of white beans in tomato sauce (including the sauce) for the garbanzo beans which I did not have on hand. My whole family really liked this soup. Definitely a keeper recipe!

I made this without the meat and it was still really good.  The broth with the baked bits and  puree makes the soup. I'm sure it's even better with the sausage.

Although my husband loved this recipe, I did not care as much for it. The potatoes should not be roasted with the other veggies as the other veggies take longer to soften and the potatoes are left to mush. I never use Kale and did not realize you have to clean it first. The garlic is another ingredient that should not be roasted. I would make this again with the changes I now know, but for others may not as the recipe was made with too many unnecessary steps...but I am a soup person and am always looking for another good healthy soup recipe.

Yes, yes. Made exactly as published - but wanted to kick this recipe up a notch by roasting a seeded jalape√±o and minced it.  Served the soup with home-made croutons.  Made a complete meal.  Will definitely make again - will try Italian turkey sausage next time.

This soup was great, to make it a little easier, I used a pastry brush to spread the oil on the veggies.

I cant believe how amazing this soup tastes.  I used Vegan Sausuages in place of the original listing & it is perfect.  Tasty, filling, healthy & not fattening.  This is worth the prep, time & energy.  AMAZING.

Excellent recipe! I used a can of diced tomatoes with the puree & roasted the garlic in foil so it wouldn't  burn. I also used chicken broth & chicken hot italian sausage.

Fantastic soup. I followed the recipe as given. My comments are that the prep work took much longer than 25 minutes. Between 40 and 50 minutes for prep is a much better estimate. The serving size should be for at least 10 servings. This soup is even better reheated. Tasty, healthy and colorful.

We didn't like this recipe.  Did everything exactly as listed, but the soup just seems to miss something in flavor.  Added some chicken cubes in the end in an effort to rescue the soup, but it still didn't come together.  I like that it's healthy, but the taste just does not match up the effort.  Will not make it again.

I have made this soup twice now. Both times I have ended up with a rather large pot of it, mainly because I double the volume of squash. This will require more veggie broth too so plan your grocery list accordingly. The first time I made it I used acorn and butternut squash. 2nd time, only butternut. They tasted the same, both good. I did peel the garlic for both batches. Like others, I left the veggies chunky. Other changes I made in my second batch were canned diced tomatoes instead of fresh, ground turkey (Italian flavored) instead of sausage (tastes just as good as the sausage without the unneeded fat), and I didn't drain the cans of beans and tomatoes before adding to the pot. I did also add red pepper to kick up the heat since I used turkey. I really like this stew. Very filling and nutritious.

This is delicious soup!! Roasting of the vegetables took a little longer than I thought it would, but the flavor was well worth the effort. The flavor of the broth is rich and the soup is hearty.  I will definitely make this again!

I followed this recipe adapting to what I had on hand, with one twist which was puree'ing ALL the Roasted Veggies together rather than leaving chunks of carrots, squash, and potatoes. I added the crumbled sausage, Navy Beans, and the chopped kale to the puree'd soup, and added more broth as needed.  The flavors are great, and makes a lot of soup (or stew as I called it!).  I kept it warm in my Ninja cooker over the cold holiday weekend (refrigerating it at night), and there was always a warm healthy meal ready for the family to dig into as needed.

Absolutely fantastic. The only way I can eat kale. I will admit I did use my inversion blender just because it is my preference. Also, I left out the sausage and used tomato paste in place of tomatoes. No offense, I seldom follow a recipe exactly, nor do I do much measuring. Try adding some sour cream. Awesome. Thanks Betsy, it's a real keeper.

Outstanding recipe.  I adjusted a little, adding more vegetables. Added diced bok choy, celery,  and diced leeks.  Doubled the amount of broth.   I forgot the sweet sausage so just used 2 hot, as per recipe.  WOW.

I made a few substitutions because of what I had available that needed to be used from my Produce delivery. I used Carnival  squash, cherry tomatoes (halved), and chicken broth instead of vegetable. It was delicious!! Will be making this regularly!!

The  roasted vegetables gave this soup a wonderful hearty flavor. I was a little unclear about pureeing some of the vegetables but it didn't seem to matter much. I will definitely make this again.

The flavours are amazing. BUT the process is too complex.  Next time I will cut the veggies smaller and hand mash some of them.   I like little chunks in my soup and the roasted flavour is great, but blending is a pain.  Other than that, it's easy.

Made this in the crockpot and added chicken. Came out great. I did use 3 chicken breasts, but found that was too much. I think 2 would be just fine.

This soup is so tasty, I call it elixir. We eat it most of the winter and we never catch colds. The only thing I did different is I left out the garbanzo beans doubled the recipe so I could use the whole squash and more potatoes.  It actually inspired me to try many more soups.

This soup was outstanding!  I learned a lot about some of the mistakes I have made before and other tips as well.  By putting broth into the sausage while cooking, it did not turn out tough or have hard edges which would happen with too much heat.  The roasting of the veggies made the broth so savory .  I used chorizo and that gave it some punch because that was what I had.  Definitely a favorite for me.  Good job.

Excellent soup! I have made it at least 4 times. At times, I have increased the number of sausages to make it more a stew  and changed the balance between the spicy and mild depending  my guests' tolerance for a  spicy  hot taste.

Like a couple of other raters, I had to adapt this because I did not have all of the ingredients called for.  I used a can of Rotel tomatoes in place of fresh, no potatoes, no sausage , no bay leaf and used basil in place of thyme.  It produced a very tasteful soup and I can see where this would be a great base for adding other veggies.

Soup is healthy and tasty! With so many ingredients, the chickpeas and kidney beans are unnecessary and they don't absorb much flavor. Also, there is some strange sequencing with the cutting and roasting of the vegetables- I might try cutting the veggies into their final size before roasting them, so as to not have to cut hot veggies. Key ingredients not to be left out  are squash, corn, kale, and chicken sausage.

This soup is delicious! I didn't use much salt... just a few dashes of sea salt over the roasted veggies, and I only had russet potatoes. Perfect!

This was good, but it took much longer to prep than the 25 minutes indicated.  I would say I spent more than 2 1/2 hours in the prep and cooking, even considering that some of the prep work is done while the veggies are roasting, etc.  It seems to me that the same effect could be achieved by stir-frying the veggies in the pan before you add the liquid.  Also, this time I followed the recipe and removed casing from the sausage.  Next time -- if there ever is a next time -- I would simply slice the sausage before cooking it.  It would be far less messy and just as tasty.

Very yummy!  I wasn't able to follow the directions perfectly (for instance, I had to use canned tomatoes and dried herbs simply because I made this soup on a whim and didn't shop for ingredients) and it still tasted awesome!  I can only imagine how tasty it is with fresh thyme and roasted tomatoes!!! Will definitely make this one again.

I made a few changes, I'm jewish  I didn't want  pork sausage. I used this recipe as the basis for a vegan vegetable soup. I used an acorn squash. I used all organic ingredients. next time I will make some  change to the seasoning. An excellent recipe.

So delicious!  The veggies definitely took longer to roast than posted, but it was worth it.  Instead of butternut squash, I used pumpkin, and instead of kale, I used chard.  I also added extra veggies so used a bit more broth.  This was a fun recipe just to play with.  By far, the best part is the blend of toasted tomatoes, onions, and garlic.  I could have eaten that puree with a spoon!

There were a lot of steps to this soup (but roasting the veggies brought out a lot of the flavour), and although I enjoyed the vegetables, I just didn't like the Italian sausage in this soup. If I were to make it again, I would boil the sausage first, because despite blotting and draining the cooked sausage on paper towels, the soup tasted greasy.  I'd also shred my kale into smaller pieces (I thought it would "wilt" down, like spinach does)

I too alter recipes & don't measure. I took some advice & added some of my own. I used all the squash (what am I going to do with the othe half?). I used canned diced tomatoes & 3 fresh that I roasted. I pur√©ed all veg's adding carrots only at the end so a little chunky. Added another can of beans & more kale. I have a vegetarian daughter so split some out & then added meat. I was able to find the ground sausage w/o the casings.  Don't see need to add broth to meat only to throw it away so just browned it. This is hearty & I feel you can seriously make it your own.

My family loved this soup! I made these changes to the recipe - used one package of chicken sausage, dried thyme instead of fresh and minced garlic from a jar instead of fresh. I also didn't pur√©e the tomatoes - just dumped them in after roasting. I also added a green pepper and some red pepper flakes and a little sugar.

I thought this was a great recipe. I used diced canned tomatoes instead of whole fresh tomatoes and simplified the steps by first browning the sausage in the stock pot, adding the liquid and then dicing the vegetables and adding to the pot to cook instead of roasting them. I also increased the potatoes to 3. We like a lot of liquid in our soups, so I usually end up adding a lot more, as I did here. A delicious combination of ingredients that I'll make again and again. Thank you!

So amazingly delicious! I did sweet potatos (which I cut into small chunks) instead of the yukon because that's what I had and I think it would be yummier than the yukon potatos.
