Simply Sensational Chili Haiku: "Love Goya products! Their recipes always win. Rock my socks' chili!" This is a no frills, slurpin' good chili. I made it exactly as written, except left out the jalapeno to appease to the more delicate taste buds of a toddler, and I also tossed in a can of kidney beans. I also used fresh garlic (5 cloves), left it in the crock pot for 8 hours on low (smelled sinfully good), and served w/ green onion, cilantro, and sour cream. Hubbie says "Good, but no Sazon Goya next time" as he spent the afternoon Googling MSG, which is the #1 ingredient in those wee envelopes. I was just happy to make a Chili that didn't have a generic "Chili Flavor Packet" dumped into it. So /deep breath/ -- to sum up -- this is a simple, and yes, simply sensational, chili that tastes like chili and isn't dominated by any one ingredient or spice. Just.Good.Chili.

This is exactly as advertised; great for the whole family.  We live in Texas and not all of the GOYA products are availabe in most grocery stores.  So we stock up on them.  I omit the beans and this recipe turns out great!  I have made this about 6 times and the recipe is very easy to double.  This is a homerun for anyone!

I'm not familiar with Goya products so we used what we had.  We omitted the jalapeño and seasoning packet.  My only complaint was that it was very greasy. Other than that it was quite tasty!

Really tasty....a tad bit salty and I love salt. had to water it down a bit.  And...Please before you put in your veggies, make sure you meat is drained of the fat first.....I follow recipes by the T and it did not say this so....while my husband was loving it he said...I just can't finish b/c of the grease.  DUH!!!!  Ya live and learn.  Kinda gross!  But overall taste was really good.  Tweaking is necessary though with the saltiness.

I used kidney beans.  Will try pinto beans next time.  I love chili and this one just wasn't a favorite.  Felt like it was a little bland and the base too thin.

This recipe is absolutely delicious and I am nothing but satisfied! My Sazon Goya did NOT have annatto in it and I had to use another brand granulated beef bouillon. Had no clue how much to use so I used 1/2 tsp and it came out just fine. I also left out the jalapeno. Highly recommend this recipe!

Deliciously chunky and full of flavor!  Satisfies that "comfort food" need.  Serve with cornbread and top with sour cream, shredded cheddar, and chopped raw onions.  Goya products are awesome!

I made a few changes but till used all the seasonings and flavors listed.  I chose to use cubed round steak and kidney beans.  Red sweet onion in place of green and poblano pepper in place of jalapeño.  I added additional depth of flavor by using fire roasted tomatoes.  This is a nice chili recipe because it allows for being customized.  We rounded the meal out with corn muffins and a salad.  Thanks, Goya!

This is an amazing Chili!
I ALWAYS make it a day ahead of time and cook 1 lb. of dried beans to use instead of canned.
I only added 1 Chipotle cube and 2 stalks of celery and remove the cilantro because we don't like it.
In the MAKE BECAUSE IT'S JUST THAT YUMMY file!!
Great Job GOYA!

I didn't have the goya spices but subbed some from the pantry.  Was a bit spicy but overall very good.  Think my fresh cilantro and bell peppers helped!

This was perfect and I will make it again. I forgot to chop the tomatoes, very important step. Might use stewed tomatoes next time.  I drained the meat and doubled the recipe.  Used red kidney beans, and put the chilli over jasmine rice.  I didn't find it salty, but I also didn't add additional salt, which I actually think it needed.  My husband recommends using two jalapeños - I don't.  My tweaks were minor, the recipe was easy to follow.  I have always been a fan of Goya products and prices, and easy to find in Connecticut.

It did turn out salty.... And bland at thatI didn't use the liquid from the beans bc it was like soup already :/ added 1/4 brown sugar at end to sweeten up. Also oregano, garlic salt, red pepper, paprika, Mexican perfect pinch and extra of all other spices.  after all the changes yes it was good so I will give it 3 for base!!! Definitely do it in a cast iron pot and let simmer for like 3 hours. Thx
