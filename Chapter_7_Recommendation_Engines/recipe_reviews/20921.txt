This was the perfect comfort food!  I sauteed the sauerkraut with onions and a small amount of caraway seeds.  I used penne pasta instead of lasagna noodles.  I was surprised that the canned soup taste wasn't so "canned" tasting.  I layered in one layer of swiss cheese and one layer of mozzarella.  The swiss cheese gave it a nice bite.  I also added the dijon mustard to the soup mixture as suggested by another reviewer. I will make this again.  It makes a lot, so I'll be eating it for lunch all week!  That's not a bad thing, I just hope I don't eat it all by myself.

I make a recipe similar to this but use Swiss cheese to go with an almost ruben flavor. My family loves it! We call it ruben lasagna. Drain the kraut well and enjoy! you can use 1/2 lb of sausage and 1 can of soup and make a smaller pan-ful pretty easily. [I usually use lite sausage and soup to cut down on some fat]

i cannot believe this recipe hasnt received more 5 star reviews!!!!! this lasagna is outstanding. i even made it for a friends wedding. gets devoured every time!!! occasionally i will substitue some of the milk with beer (what goes best with kraut, sausage, and cheese? beer!) and it gives the lasagna an awesome twist! thanks for the recipe :).....i also find it bizarre for people to rate this recipe negatively, claimimg its because they dont like sausage or sauerkraut. those two ingredients are clearly stated in the recipe, so if you dont like them, why would you make this?

I was brought up eating lots of German food and altho it's not my thing, it is my Scottish hubby's love. I started by soaking regular lasagna noodles in a large pan filled with hot water to make them pliable enough to build the dish. I simmered the sauerkraut with onion, a little brown sugar and caraway seeds and boiled the kielbasa to remove some of the salt. Instead of the soups, I chose to make a white sauce which worked out fine. This morning Rachel Ray made a "mile high" lasagna using a loaf pan lined with foil so I followed her lead and did the same thing. Once out of the oven, I let it sit for a good 45 minutes to allow it to set up. It cut beautifully and my hubs thought this was absolutely terrific. Thanks so much Don!

I'm giving this three stars as the recipe is writen because I found it to be too doughy with the lasagna noodles.  The flavor of the recipe is good (if you like sausage and sauerkraut, and I'm a sauerkraut FREAK!) so I'd probably try this again but probably with a different noodle (thin layers of egg noodles? AND more sauerkraut!) or layers of par-boiled thin slices potatoes.  And it's really easy to put together if your a sauerkraut FREAK like me who always has sauerkraut in her pantry.

I made two kinds of lasagna for a party and this one was the hands down winner!  Unfortunately, there was only one piece leftover.  Used no boil noodles and they worked beautifully.  Shared the recipe with several of the guests!

Very good! This was a big hit with my husband. I halved everything but the noodles and cheese, which worked perfectly. I used swiss and mozzarella cheeses and one can of Campbell's Cream of Chicken and Mushroom soup. Reheats well. Thanks!

I didn't follow the recipe exactly as we didn't have some stuff, but I mostly followed it... And it was really good! I used wagon wheel pasta and only one can of soup (mushroom). I used less milk and added a block of cream cheese. It was really good! Our daughter enjoyed it, after pooh-poohing because there was sauerkraut in it. Success! And it was great the next day. Thanks for sharing, Don!

I'll be trying this one again.  I used Italian sausage instead of kielbasa & I don't think it was the same.  Everyone liked it okay, but wasn't wowed by it.  With some changes, I think it could be a bit better.

Loved this recipe! The only thing I changed was to use no-boil noodles instead of regular lasagna noodles (as suggested by a previous review).

This is very similar to a family favorite at our house.  I recommend swiss cheese over the mozzarella.  We always used wide egg noodles and mixed everything up in a casserole dish.  YUMMY!  I opted for only cream of mushroom soup as well.  Experiment with different pasta until you find the one that suits your family's taste.

I followed this recipe as written, and it turned out superb!!! My family is from Germany and even my pickiest eaters agree that this lasagna has a very authentic "German" taste. My husband asks for this lasagna on a regular basis. Thank you for the great recipe!

This wasn't bad.  It was very different.  I liked it more than my husband, but he is not a big sauerkraut fan and I am.  I made a couple of changes based on others' feedback.  I used 1 cup heavy whipping cream and 1 cup 2% milk rather than 2 cups of milk.  I also used wide noodles rather than lasagna noodles and I used 1/2 swiss cheese and 1/2 mozzerella.

Just ok.  If made again, recommend pressing sauerkraut first to get moisture out.  Also needs more cooking time than stated.

Delicious!  Totally different flavor than any dish I've ever made or tasted before! I lightened the recipe a bit by using 98% fat free soups, skim milk, 14 oz. of turkey kielbasa, and part skim mozzarella cheese. This is definitely one I'll make again and again!  Thanks for sharing, Don!

Do NOT use Italian sausage, it just isnt the same for this recipe at all.  Also cook onions and let them cool before adding the soup and milk.   I also use swiss cheese to give it a kind of Ruben flavor in addition to the mozzarella cheese.   One other thing I add is a small amount of sour cream to the soup mixture.   Does make it more fattening but well worth it.  Be sure the sauerkraut is well drained as well.

This was a hit when I made it for some Lithuanian friends. I made some changes and made it like baked ziti.  1 lb ziti 2 cans golden mushroom soup 2 cups milk 1 lb kielbasa (sliced into 1/2 inch slices) 1 can saurkraut (I used the bagged kraut) 8 oz shredded swiss 8 oz sliced swiss 1 1/2 cup sour cream  1.Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add ziti pasta, and cook until al dente, about 8 minutes; drain.  2.In a large skillet, saute' kielbasa over medium heat. Mix mushroom & milk sauce to make sauce and add to pan with kielbasa, and simmer 15 minutes.  3.Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a 9x13 inch baking dish. Layer as follows: Small amount of sauce on bottom of pan, 1/2 of the ziti, sliced swiss cheese, sour cream, 1/2 sauce/kielbasa mixture, remaining ziti, grated swiss cheese and remaining sauce mixture. 4.Cover with foil and bake for 30 minutes, then uncover and bake fro another 15 minutes.

Cooked this for dinner tonight...it was EXCELLENT! We followed the original recipe, except we sautee'd the kielbasa and onion with butter then added the sauerkraut & cooked for a few minutes. This recipe was much better than I expected, true comfort food! For those that aren't "crazy" about sauerkraut....don't worry, it mellows out with the rest of the flavors.

very good, inexpensive dish ! Changes I made were... i used 8oz shredded Gruyere & 8 oz shredded Mozzarella, substituted cream of potato soup for the cream of chicken. Sauted one finely diced small sweet onion and added that to the soup mixture and lastly; toasted 1/2 teaspoon of caraway seeds and sprinkled them on each layer.

Made this the other night and followed some of the other suggestions and it was ok.  Added in some onion, used fresh kraut, a little less milk than recipe called for...it just seemed to be missing something for me.  Seemed a little bland maybe?  I did find the next day when we reheated the leftovers, I liked it better.  Probably won't attempt again, but it was interesting.

I only used Cream of Mushroom, I thought using both Cream of Mushroom and Chicken would add too muc sodium. Sauted the sausage with onions and it turned out great! Also used Reduced fat mozzerella. Great easy recipe and good comfort food!

So there was a little confusion with the lasagna noodles, as the box said 12-14 minutes, so I boiled for about 11 total. And the sauerkraut didn't come in a 20 oz can, so I got a 27 oz. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and it was hands down and instant winner. I tried it on my family for a Saturday get together and everyone had been ho-hum about me trying this "weird" dish. But turns out, they ALL LOVED IT! It was completely gone, which is really rare. Thanks so much!

This recipe was very easy to make and we really enjoyed it.  We love pierogies at our house, and that's what it reminded us of. I will make this one again! :)

This was great! Used two cans cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom(b/c that's what I had on hand) and added 3 slices(broken into pieces) of swiss cheese on the top in addition to the mozzarella.
Also, sprinkled a bit of garlic salt into the sauce.

Although my husband and I LOVE sauerkraut, I knew it might be an issue with my kids but I didn't want to leave it out.  So, I just put very little between layers.  I also browned two tubes of Jimmy Dean sausage instead of using the kielbasa and layered it in.  Wonderful!  Most everybody had seconds or thirds.  We will be making this more often!

Wow, I was pleasantly surprised and this got great reviews from guests. This was so easy and so flavorful. I find German food is often bland but this was great. I added 2 tbs of dijon and about 1/4C brown sugar to the soup mixture. Highly recommend!

This is a very tasty dish. Despite sounding and looking a bit off at first, it really is worth making. I practically had to force feed this to people the first time. Now I constant requests for it.

I only gave this four stars as the meat should truly be seared before cutting it up. It gives it and the dish so much more flavor.

This was just okay for me and the family.  It was so greasy and fatty that I would have a hard time justifying the work and calories of making it again.  Anything this fatty should be over-the-top-good and this wasn't.

Thanks.  This was very different.  I made this just as written except that I used 2 cans of cream of chicken soup and no mushroom soup.  I was surprised at how good it was, although it tasted nothing like normal lasagna.  It was very noodle-y, so some people may want to add more filling, although I liked it as it was.

Very tasty & easy. Both my husband and I agreed that next time I will use egg noodles, or some other form of pasta. The Lasanga format wasn't really working for us on this one, but it was great overall. Definately a keeper!

this is the best variation of the traditional lasagna.  If you love sauerkraut, sausage and cream of mushroom soup, this is your recipe.  Simple and fun enough for my 10 year old to make.  He loves it.

This wasn't bad. The sauce was a little bland although I added some garlic and parsley. I probably will not make again but it was a nice change for kielbasa. I should have added a little mustard into the sauce.

Made this for deer camp this year and everyone loved it, even the guy who hates sauerkraut! 1 pan wasn't enough for 6 hungry hunters, and even printed out the recipe for a couple of them. Made it as written, except for adding more kraut than called for. This has already been requested for next years camp! Yum!!

WOW.  This was fantastic....and addictive.  I did saute an onion with a little bit of carraway and then added the sauerkraut to remove a little moisture.  Used whole wheat lasagna...it actually added a great flavor to it.  Served spicy brown mustard on the side.  Of course I will make this again!!!!

My husband is half German so I was happy to cook a recipe that I thought he might enjoy.  He liked it fine (he's not much on compliments) but I REALLY thought it was good.  Of course, like everyone else, I changed some things to suit our tastes.  I used smoked turkey sausage instead of Kielbasa and "No Yolk" egg noodles instead of the lasagna noodles.  I also sauted the sausage slices before adding them to the lasagna layers.  I just think it makes the meat better to caramelize it a little before adding to a casserole.  Anyway, like I said, it turned out great!  I really think my German mother-in-law would enjoy it.  Thanks for an unusual and satisfying recipe.

This recipe is so yummy!  The saurkraut is not too overpowering either.  Is a very nice change from your normal everyday humdrum meals.  My son and I both loved it.  It was very simple to make and I recommend this recipe to everyone.

I followed the advise of some of the reviewers...I sauteed the sausage with onions.  To that I added some ground mustard and the sour kraut.  I let this all cook together. I used a combo of swiss, provolone and queso (mexican) melting cheese.  It was really good.  My husband commented it was weird but good and had 3 helpings.  I loved it too!

This was a really fun recipe to try out! I think it's a keeper- the whole family loved it. The sauerkraut taste isn't very strong, and the canned soup doesn't have a "canned" flavor. I put it in for 10 minutes longer, adding the cheese for the last 5 minutes. Thanks for this recipe!

This was really easy to make, not to mention tasty.  Like others have mentioned, I too am not a big fan of sauerkraut, but mixed with all the ingredients (especially the soups), the kraut really wasn't overpowering and added just the right amount of pop to the dish.  After reading some of the other reviews, I decided to incorporate swiss cheese as well.  I grated both swiss and mozzerella and combined them while layering... I also mixed about a teaspoon or two of spicy brown mustard into the final layer of cheese that was melted on top... YUMMY!!!!!

Very good. I made this as instructed, using the lasagna noodles and the ingredients and amounts called for and it came out perfect. The only thing I did different was I took another reviewers suggestion and used some swiss cheese. Did give it a nice bite, but I think it gave it too MUCH of a bite. The sauerkraut alone does that. Just depends on your tastes, I guess. I personally don't think this recipe NEEDS any cheese. The sauce in itself makes the dish nice and creamy. So next time I make it, I'll probably leave the cheese out completely.

A tasty, original twist on an old favorite! It's easy to make, to boot! Layers separated a bit for me, but the flavors are still oh-so-heavenly.

Pretty nice change. I added onion to the top layer, which gave it some added flavor and next time I will add it to all layers. I also added dried italian herbs and that really helped. Use turkey kilbasa and reduced fat soups to cut on the calories for a healthy version. Enjoy!

I don't know how to rate this.  My 10 year old loved it.  I am not a big sausage lover so this did not sit well with me.  I could not think of how to describe this, another reviewer said it best... this is doughy.  Like any lasagna it need to "set"  Won't make this again.

Love this recipe. Gave 4 stars because the second time I made it I tweaked it to make it better and have some tips that may be useful. Those that found the sauce runny as I did initially double the amount of kielbasa AND after blending the soups and milk combine the kraut with the sauce. It reduces the liquid level (don't forget to drain well the kraut). ALSO top each layer with shredded swiss cheese.  After baking let the lasagna set for at least 15 minutes to form. THIS is a great recipe. I do LOVE it. Reminds me of great times in Germany when my parents were stationed there.

This recipe was delicious I was looking for something different to try... I did make some slight changes first I used no boil lasagna noodles which worked out cause I didn't have to drain the sauerkruat completely which is a pain for me, I also added salt pepper and garlic powder to the soup mixture, and I used Swiss cheese and a skinless kielbasa. It came out beautifully. Also I didn't see the need to break out the blender to mix the soups and milk, I just used a whisk. I will make this one again but next time ill use more kraut...

Was able to put together quickly since I had most of ingredients on hand. But even using other previous suggestions such as halfing milk with cream as well as halfing mozz with swiss, using no bake noodles and sauteed onions with kielbasa first it still seemed like it was missing something. Will probably try again using maybe mustard and white pepper. Thanks for the recipe.

My husband and I enjoyed this dish, but our son (who is not a kraut fan) could not even finish his serving. So unless the kids like the strong flavor of kraut I would steer clear of this recipe, or perhaps try to substitute it with something less bold.

Good taste with whole wheat noodles. Try only 3 cups of sauce. 4 is too runny.

HOLY COW IS THIS AMAZINGLY GOOD!!!
I love this recipe and will fix it for company soon.  It is so easy and delicious.  I used only the cream of mushroom instead of the cream of chicken and added some dijon mustard.  Instead of all of the cheese, I just grated some fresh parmazan into each layer and a little on top.  I think any other cheese would make an already rich dish, over the top...it was perfect with parmesan!  NO LEVTOVERS!

I thought I would give this a try since it sounded really weird to me, but I love ruben sandwiches. I followed the advice of another post and used wide egg noodles instead. It was good but I don't know if I would make it again. My fourteen year old ate three helpings and then figured out there was sauerkraut in it. Husband gives it a three out five and he loves sauerkraut.

I'm not a huge fan of saurkraut but everyone I make this for who is loves the meal.  It's easy to make and is different. My brother in law likes it so much we made it for Hanukkah dinner two years ago for him with turkey sausage. Easy, delicious, and very unique.

The flavor of this recipe was awesome! I have to admit the lasagna noodles didn't work out so well so this went from a lasagna to a pasta dish. I made other noodles and mixed it up with the soup/kraut/kielbasa mixture. Next time I think I will sautee the kielbasa and kraut and then add the soup mixture before serving over noodles so it's more saucey. Again, GREAT flavor and was even good reheated.

We did not enjoy this at all. I made it exactly as the original recipe instructs, so I'm not rating anyone else's modifications. For one thing, we found it to be very soupy. I think half the milk would have been plenty. For another, we found the texture strange, perhaps due to the sauerkraut. And lastly, but most importantly, we thought it was just a very strange-tasting combination. Soups plus cheese plus sauerkraut? I thought a recipe with four and a half stars would taste a lot better, but even our German roots didn't prepare us for this dish. Our 6-year-old had to be bribed to finish half of her plate, and my husband and I, while we ate it, did not enjoy it. Sorry, just not a good dish for us.

Unreal! I made sure to drain the saurkraut really well and fried it in some butter and onions first. I used farmer's sausage instead of kielbasa because of DH's preference - didn't fry it first, but made sure to slice it really thin. It was sooo good and was a hit at a dinner of about 12 people - went way faster then the standard meat lasagna.

I made this for a international party we went to.  Our country was Germany so accompanied this easy Lasagna with German Beer and Wine.  It was a real hit and there was none left for us to take home.  I will try making it with Penne pasta as one reader mentioned.

I'm giving this 5 stars because my husband absolutely loved it. He said "You can make this again any time." Our almost 4 year old seemed to like it too. I personally thought it was very good, but for my taste it needs a little something - maybe some spices added to the sauce or a cheese with a stronger flavor. This is definitely something I'm going to add to the rotation! Thank you for the recipe!

This is pretty unique, but very yummy.  The sour kraut definitely gives it a character.  I am not sure lasagna pasta belongs there too well, however, I might try egg noodles next time, or better yet, spatzle if I can find it.  Over all, it was delicious.

It was really good! I used no boil lasagna noodles, more kraut than called for. I used sliced cheese of mozzarella and swiss, adding more than called for lol I like a cheesy lasagna. I didn't blend the soups I just wisked them in a bowl. I also put the cheese on top before I put it in the oven. Definitely will make again :-)

I made this with the following modifications:  Sauteed a sliced onion,  about 1 cup of sliced mushrooms and 2 cloves of minced garlic and added it to the sauerkraut before layering.  Half of the cheese I used was Swiss. 
My family loved it.  
I didn't read about using beer until I went to rate and review this.  I'll keep that in mind for next time!

I had some sauerkraut and polish sausage that I needed to use so my ingredient search brought me to this recipe-I admit it sounded weird but what the heck! I didn't have cream of chicken soup so I used 2 cream of mushroom and subbed polish sausage, I also cooked the sausage first  and drained off the fat set it aside, and then in the same pan sauteed the sauerkraut and a small red onion sliced with a drizzle of olive oil before adding to lasagna. It smelled soo good cooking and tasted delicious!!! Try it! 
PS its good with sour cream dolloped on top:)

Made this for an Apres' golf Ocktoberfest!   It went over great!   Easy to make, different, & delicious!!  (I did forget to take a picture, though!). Also, I followed someone else's lead & substituted a 12 oz bottle of German beer & 4 oz of half & half instead of the 2 cups of milk. I did mix swiiss & mozzarella, too, for the cheese.  Definitely is a keeper & will make this the next time I have company.  (German or not!)

I've made this three times now and it's a new favorite. Hubby says he likes this better than lasagna with red sauce. The first time I made this, I followed the recipe as written. It was good as written, but I always play with recipes to see if I can make it better for my family. I made some changes the second time as follows: I used parboiled sweet sausage (1#) and cut them up as directed in the original recipe (be sure to drain off any grease when slicing them up).  I also only used 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup as we do not like the cream of chicken soup. I also added  8 ounces of softened cream cheese and added this when you combine the milk & soup mixture. This may not be for everyone, but it adds another depth of flavor and richness. The down part of that is the increase of calories. Not necessary to add cream cheese, but if you have it, give it a try. Since it is only my husband and me, The third time, I cut the recipe in half and it made enough for 4 servings (2 for the freezer.).  When cutting in half, I did NOT reduce the meat or sauerkraut.  I used only enough noodles that would fit into a 9"x9" baking pan which for me was 6 noodles. Bake as directed for both full recipe and the half recipe. Thanks so much for sharing your recipe. We love sauerkraut and this gives us another wonderful recipe to use it.  PS tip: If you spray the under-side of the foil with cooking spray (Pam), your food shouldn't stick to it.

I made this with "cooked" medium egg noodles instead of the lasagne noodles and it worked out well. If I make this again, which i probably will, i will throw in some onion, try swiss cheese instead of the mozzarella, and use an authentic German style sausage, as i am not a fan of the grocery store kielbasa.

This got raves from my husband and I thought it was great, too! I made some changes to suit our preferences and based on other reviews. I browned the sausage first, then sauteed a 20 oz. bag of sauerkraut (next time I'd use even more) with a sliced red onion and some butter in the same skillet. Reading from many that the lasagna noodles were gummy, and because we love potatoes with our kielbasa and sauerkraut, I used par-boiled 1/8"  slices of potato in place of the noodles. I dislike mushrooms, so I used Cream of Onion soup instead. I baked according to the directions and turned the broiler on for a few minutes at the end because it wasn't quite browned enough. This will be a regular for us!

While I've never eaten a German Lasagna in Germany, this fits the flavor profile. It is a bit salty, so that's a consideration between the high salt content cans and the sausage.

Very yummy! If you like sausage and sauerkraut this is a must!  It heats up well for leftovers too. I followed the recipe exactly as written.

I already left a feedback but I want to add one more comment.  This gets better with time.  In other words, it's even better leftover!

I made this lasagna for an "international dinner" at a missionary conference.  It was loved!  I went home with an empty casserole dish that was scraped clean!  Wow! I will be making this again . . . soon!

I didn't think I liked sauerkraut, but when I was pregnant it sounded good, so I tried this.  It was really tasty, even for me!  Great recipe for something different.

This was so easy to make and delicious!  You can go easy on the sauerkraut or heavier depending on what you like.  Very creamy, tasty and fulfilling.

The flavor was good, but would remake it again using only 1 can of soup. I felt it was too soup heavy for the quantity of sausage and kraut. I did use beer in place of milk and used swiss/mozzerella mixed together cheese as recommended. Added some salt and pepper and spicy mustard to the sauce, gave it a little zing.
