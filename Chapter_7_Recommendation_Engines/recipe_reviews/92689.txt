LOVE these cookies!  The only thing I have changed when baking these is to reduce the cooking time by little.  I like them a little soft.  Also, you can cut down on cooling time by putting the chocolate kisses in the freezer and hour before.  I'm usually baking something as the last minute and this way you can transport them sooner without making a mess of the chocolate.

My mom had made this years ago with both the kisses and mini reeses cups.  I brought them out one night for a softball game of adult men and they all LOVED them!!!  They are so easy and quick to make, such a good treat they're sure to go fast!

These cookies turned out wonderful!  I was very pleased with the results, and they were so easy to make.  My husband loved them and wants me to make some to take to work.  One tip though - Next time I am going to try adding more vegetable oil so that the dough is not so sticky and doesn't seem to split or dry out when cookies are done baking.  When rolling in sugar, do so only lightly, the first batch came out too sugary.  The second was perfect though, when I used less sugar to roll the dough.

I must have did something wrong, because these did not turn out at all how I thought they should. The flavor was fine but the balls did not fall enough and they were a little dry.
