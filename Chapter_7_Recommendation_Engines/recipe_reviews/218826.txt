I like to make this recipe for two different recipes; Meatball Subs with homemade marinara and Barbeque Meatballs. This comes together quickly with ingredients most people have on hand. Sometimes, I'll throw in garlic/onion powder and italian seasoning. They hold together well and don't get mushy when left to hang out in whatever sauce you add them to. NOTE: This can be made healthier with ground turkey or chicken and spiced up to make taste like ground pork with brown sugar, sage, red pepper flake, marjoram, fresh ground pepper and a little salt. Fools my husband every time.

These meatballs are absolutely delectable! When I make it, I use ground beef instead of sausage.  I also use one package of onion soup mix instead of the chopped onion.  They always turn out fantastic and I was happy that I followed the recipe directly the first time I made it.  When I did make them for the first time I thought that they were going to be too runny because it seemed that there was a lot of milk and egg, giving it a very soft texture. However, I was wrong! They turned out perfect, and even better the second time when I used the onion soup mix. Thanks for the best meatball recipe I've ever tasted!

Instead of using all sausage I used a half pound of ground sirloin & one sweet Italian sausage link.  My kids aren't crazy about onion so I diced it very fine.   I formed mini-meatballs (made 33) slightly larger than a giant gum ball & baked for 10-12 minutes.  Half an hour before eating I simmered the meatballs in spaghetti sauce.  My kids LOVED the meatballs!  My six year old even swiped a couple off the cookie sheet before they even went in the sauce.

I used 2 lbs of hamburger to feed 10 instead of sausage, and it was amazing! We all loved it and we will have this again in the near future!

Very good recipe.  I used Italian turkey sausage and had a good result, very tender.  Also, instead of regular bread crumbs, I used Panko bread crumbs.  Once I've baked for 20 minutes, I add to my marinara sauce and let simmer for an hour.

YUM!!! I made these to go with Spaghetti, but my husband couldn't wait for dinner to get into them :-) This is definitely going to be a favorite of ours! They work great with pasta, but would be great by themselves as an appetizer too!

Wonderful Meatballs! Just the right amount of flavoring without overpowering my sauce. Will use them in Sub Sandwiches also.

Simple, straightword recipe for Italian meatballs. My Mom would sometimes add a little sausage to the hamburger mixture for her meatballs and this was a nice change using all sausage.  It definitely got my husband's approval (not that he needs much coaxing to eat spaghetti and meatballs).  This was perfect over pasta with "Best Marinara Sauce Yet" from this site.  Pair it with a nice garden salad and a glass of wine and you've got a great meal!

Excellent recipe! My sons are allergice to dairy and eggs... So I used an egg replacer for the egg,  and rice milk in lieu of dairy milk. The bread crumbs comparable to their allergies is OAT bread.  Finally, in lieu of dairy cheese, I used a non-dairy, non-soy cheese. They were awesome! My entire family greatly enjoyed this meal!  THANKS FOR SHARING!

These were wonderful, made them last night - super easy. My husband's not big on chopped onions in anything so I substituted onion powder and added garlic power while I was at it because - why not?! Great meal!

This is a great recipe. I also made it with grass fed ground beef instead of sausage. I also added a little bit of garlic. Awesome recipe!

Delicious! Very flavorful, moist, and easy.  Used these in meatball subs with homemade marinara.  Next time I think I will try half ground beef, half sausage, however.

Made these meatballs with the only modifications being that I used Jimmy Dean's Ground Sausage, used Reduced Fat Ritz Crackers instead of bread crumbs and added some garlic powder.  They were fantastic!  Next time I'm going to use turkey sausage, Reduced Fat Parmesan Cheese, and enriched or whole wheat pasta noodle to make the meal more on the healthier side. ; )

Very easy to make meatballs. I think I prefer ground beef ones, over these though. I used panko breakcrumbs because that was all I had on hand.

Great recipe for a quick and easy meatball. I made these to go with zoodles and topped with Best Marinara Sauce Yet (Allrecipes recipe). Don't forget the garlic bread.

I made half of this recipe using hot Italian sausage, seasoned bread crumbs and adding a clove of garlic.  Note: for half an egg use two tablespoons of beaten egg.  The sausage mixture is very sticky so be sure to  moisten your hands with water when rolling these into balls.  I baked mine for just a little over 20 minutes.  I made these early in the day, freezing some for later and reserving some to re-heat in my spaghetti sauce (Inger’s Spaghetti Sauce, also found here on AR).  These were good, but I think Hubs liked them better than I did.  I also thought they really needed some salt.  I might try half ground beef and half Italian sausage next time.

3.8.17  I must admit I was surprised how tender, tasty, and moist these meatballs were made with only Italian sausage, no other meat.  I typically use a mixture of ground beef and ground pork and then add the Italian spices, but since the spices already are in the sausage, no additional spices were necessary.  Did I say how EASY these meatballs were to make??  Thoroughly enjoyed them on a meatball hoagie today.

These were really good.  I used mild Italian sausage.  They were a bit mushy as written but I compensated with a little extra breadcrumb.  They also came out a bit on the greasy side, but I think next time I will just put them on a grate suspended so that the grease runs off.  A great substitute for an everyday meatball.

I have my own perfect meatball recipe, but variety is the spice of life, so I decided to give these a whirl.
I'm glad I did because they were delicious. I made as directed and they turned out great. I'll definitely be rotating these with my other recipe.

These were fantastic!  Changes I made:  used turkey sausage as this is what we had in the freezer, used very finely crushed saltines as we were out of breadcrumbs, increased saltines to 1/2 c as the mixture was a bit too goopy to form a proper meatball, threw in some fresh garlic, garlic powder, a liberal amount of red pepper flakes cuz we like things spicy, a dusting of ground oregano and a few crushed fennel seeds.  I made 16 balls out of this so had to bake about 30 minutes, til they were nice and brown on their bottoms :)  and oozing melted parmesan.  The texture and consistency of the finished product was great, tender yet firm enough to withstand simmering in a red gravy, or even a bbq sauce if you care to change up the sausage flavor/seasoning a bit.  I served these with penne and roasted tomatoes and  roasted hot Italian garlic with crumbled feta cheese and fresh chopppd basil from my potted Globe.  They were a bit hit with my family.

I"m not sure why the prep time says 25 min. because it just takes a few minutes to make these. I made mine with Johnsonville Ground Hot Italian sausage, and my family absoloutley loved them. Will never use another recipe for meatballs.

Love this super easy recipe and I make it all the time.  Only thing I do differently is add some garlic powder, onion powder and some whatever Italian spices/herbs I have on hand.  Wonderful and juicy!!

Very tasty and a keeper.  I subbed chicken for pork, added Badia Complete Seasoning and stuffed with cheese.  I served it with a white sauce over pasta with garlic bread.  No leftovers!  Thanks Chef John.

Good sausage meatballs.  Next time I would definitely use the hot Italian sausage instead of the mild.  I did add some garlic powder.

Terrific meatballs!  Very tender and flavorful.  I served it with linguine and Alfredo sauce, and we truly enjoyed it.  They were great right out of the oven, but combined with the sauce..wow.  Thanks, Johnsonville!  Again.

Wonderful and tasty! Easy recipe for sure. My kids were eating them plain before adding sauce to them. SO either you add these tasty morsels to spaghetti or you eat them as are, they are great! TY LOVED THEM!

A big hit with the family.  I made the meatballs on the small side because it's easier for the kids to eat them that way.  Using sausage really made these stand out from our normal beef meatballs and the meatballs themselves were yummy.  The pasta, however, needed some tweaking.  I had to add some mozzarella and ricotta and sauce to make it not so dry.

These were good meatballs but not my favorite since they are a little too greasy for my liking.  I might make them again with half ground beef and half sausage.

I made these out Johnsonville's Pork & Chicken Mild Italian Sausage and was very impressed. I'm not an Italian sausage fan so I was pleasantly surprised at how good they were. I made a simple marinara and turned them into meatball subs - Yum! Thanks for the great recipe! It's a keeper!

I can't believe I've never made spaghetti and meatballs before! I always thought they were time consuming. Not so with this recipe! I used Johnsonville Mild Italian ground sausage and jarred spaghetti sauce for a tasty, quick-on-the-table dinner. ***Update - I made these again with the hot Italian sausage and they are now 5 stars! So much better. I will use the hot sausage from now on. This time I used them with the gravy part of Chef John's Swedish Meatballs, and they turned out fabulous!

Even with 1/2 Grd beef and 1/2 sausage this is messy to work with. Might be easier with lessor proportion of sausage. I browned it before baking. They were tasty though. Next I'll try grd Pork to save on fat.

The best! I stopped making my own sausage when I discovered Johnsonville Mild Italian a few years ago. It is so good so I knew this recipe would be great and it is. The only thing I did different was use Ritz cracker crumbs for the bread crumbs, but other than that do not change a thing; it is perfect as is and couldn't be easier. (Idiot proof!) It is my only meatball recipe from now on.
Thanks Johnsonville!

i added 1/4 finely chopped mushrooms - just added to the flavor.  This is an excellent meatball that won't make it to the spaghetti sauce if i make it too early! next time i think i'll add a little garlic or some red pepper.

These meatballs were delicious, I was making a triple batch (18 servings) so I mixed equal parts of ground beef, italian sausage and pork sausage (1 lb each), tripling all of the other ingredients as listed....they got rave reviews!!

My husband is allergic to beef (Alpha Gal allergy) and was craving a meatball sub.  We used this recipe with a store bought pizza sauce and fresh provolone and it was amazing!  Will definitely make again.  We did leave out the onion (because he doesn't like onion) so I am sure it would be even more flavorful with that!

Very good.  I did tweak it a little.  I added a tsp of ground italian seasoning and 1/3 lb of ground pork,  just because I had it on hand.

These were great.  I used ground venison instead of sausage (we don't like sausage). Made 33, baked in a pan, put the cooked meat balls on a couple of cookie sheets; put in freezer til frozen; added all to a gallon freezer zip lock bag and used as needed. These are delicious right out of the freezer, simmered in your favorite spaghetti sauce and you have a delicious meal within 20 minutes. Add a salad and Texas toast. Umm

My family loves these meatballs!   I have made them at least a dozen times - sometimes we use the spicy sausage, sometimes the regular - but they are always a hit.   And sometimes I will make a double batch and freeze half of them; so I have something on hand for when I need a quick weeknight meal.

I made these meatballs with an old homemade spaghetti recipe handed down from my husband’s great grandma. I used ground round meat instead of the Italian sausage. I make spaghetti every Christmas Eve for my family. My mother-in-law had this same tradition for Christmas Day. The meatballs were delicious!!

I added a pound of hamburg with the sweet Italian sausage. I doubled other ingredients and added garlic and fresh basil. I love meatballs on pasta or in a grinder roll with sauce and cheese. I think it helps if you flour and brown them before you bake.

I've made this with Italian sausage & also Italian ground turkey. Good recipe! I make it dairy free for my son with allergies. Nutritional yeast for parmesan & unsweet almond milk for the milk. He loves it!

I used ½ spicey sausage &  ½ hamburger
I liked that it is simple yet flavorful. Baking in large muffin tins are great and the small/mini are great for kids (& adults too of course)

These meatballs were fabulous! They were so tender and so flavorful! I added one clove of minced garlic and used Italian seasoned Panko breadcrumbs (that's what I had on hand). I flipped the meatballs halfway through the cooking time and they were perfect! Hubby has requested this recipe for our meatballs going forward!

I absolutely loved these! I added them to regular spaghetti sauce recipe afterwards and dinner was a hit! Make sure to have your sausage really cold when you add it to the mixture to make rolling the meatballs much easier.

Per one review, used 1 packet onion soup mix (as did not have an onion) with 1/2 lb sweet sausage and 1/2 lb hot Italian sausage. Onion soup mix was a little overpowering--will cut to maybe 1/2 packet next time or use real onion. Still nice meatball--will def try again. Thx to OP and other reviewers.

Oh yah, I made this great recipe for an Italian hero and  my family raved about them!  The meatballs were delicious, I made them a little large so needed 30 minutes for cook time. I took them out and placed them on the bottom of the roll and threw on a slice of provolone on top then put them under the broiler for 2 minutes.  Perfect!

I have never had any meatballs that were 100% Italian sausage usually they've either been ground beef or a combination of Italian sausage and ground beef. I chose to cook these meatballs in my instant pot - I cheated by pouring Bertolli spaghetti sauce over the meatballs, along with 1/3 cup water, and cooked them on low pressure for 12 minutes before doing a quick release! I served these meatballs with homemade pasta. Semi-homemade dinner in under 20 minutes start to finish!!!

These meatballs are really good.  I added a pound of ground chuck to the Italian sausage and some oregano.  I didn't put them in a sauce. Instead I just put them over thin spaghetti noodles with some shredded parmesan cheese and garlic bread.  Delicious!

I didn't really care for these. I made them using ground chicken instead of sausage. The recipe didn't call for any seasoning, which in my opinion left them very bland. Also I found the taste of onion to be very overwhelming.

Excellent recipe. I added basil for flavor and and cayenne pepper for fire and cooked them on 350 for 45 minutes and 400 for 15 minutes (I have a fear of under cooked pork products). I usually make these once a month or so.

I do not feel the bread crumbs are necessary in this recipe. Flavor is alright. I like that this is a basic recipe where u could add different seasonings. I threw a few of these balls in to simmer with "the Best Marinara Sauce Yet" recipe from this site. Hoping to get that Italian, meaty, robust plate of spaghetti tonight.

I LOVE sausage so this recipe is great. I didn't use any milk because I had a smaller package of sausage and when I added the egg it was actually too much moisture so I added more bread crumbs to soak some up.  I can see with a 19oz package why you would use the milk though.  Hubby loved them and I thought they were pretty darn good. We had them on top of spaghetti with roasted cauliflower and mixed veggies but I think a white sauce might be better with these! :)

I doubled this recipe since I'm cooking for 7 big eaters.  I left out onion (allergies) added 1 tsp. Italian herb blend, 2 cloves garlic. I forgot to add milk, but I'm cooking them in the crockpot, so I don't need extra liquid.  Topping with homemade Italian sauce in crockpot to make meatball sandwiches on ciabatta rolls (with provolone of course.)

I mix the sausage with ground beef. These are really tasty, easy to make, and I like that they're baked instead of fried.

Followed Sarah Jo's review and added the onion soup mix but combined the sausage meat with ground beef. Very good and had nice compliments. Thanks.

This is super easy and very tasty! I was going to buy ready-made meatballs from the store for a party, but I came across this. I took a leap of faith and made 4 recipes at once (using my Kitchen Aid mixer to mix all the ingredients). I used 2 Italian sausage packages, 1 lb ground turkey and 1 lb ground beef. I used onion powder instead of onions. They came out amazing. 4 recipes made about 120 meatballs. My kids ate them first for dinner and they love the meatballs. Thank you for a great recipe!

These were OK, we just prefer our meatballs to be not all sausage.  I think a blend of sausage and another meat would be much better for our preferences.  Must add garlic though, regardless!

The family LOVED these!  I was out of Parmesan and didn't realize it until I started putting these together so I subbed in Asiago cheese.  They were delicious.  I will try them next time with Parm.  And I may try a batch with half sausage, half beef.  This recipe is a keeper!

Delicious alternative to ground beef!  I used the Johnsonville Chicken Sausage Cajun Style and it added a wonderful zip to the recipe.  (I had to use chicken sausage because my husband keeps Kosher and I can't use pork sausage.)  The meatballs were tender and delicious.  One note:  Ground sausage (or link sausage, uncased) is different from ground beef.  Ground beef tends to stick together, so you definitely need the "binding" ingredient(s) in this recipe (eggs, breadcrumbs).  Definitely worth it, though!

I loved these! They were perfect. I served them with pasta, and I think they were great that way, but I think they would be good as appetizers in a barbecue-style cocktail sauce too. So delicious!

When I make lasagna, I put little meatballs in between the layers instead of a meat based sauce. These sausage meatballs would be perfect for that. When you rate a recipe, you should rate it before you change it. Don't change it and then rate it. It's not the recipe that's written that you're rating, it's your version of that recipe that you're rating. I, too would probably add garlic to the recipe and maybe even a bit of parsley as well. I also like the idea of beef and sausage mix. These recipes are meant to be tweaked to suit your taste.

I had made these for dinner today. I admit, I almost never make pork except for bacon on occasion. So, I was a bit surprised when these actually did not come out tasting like what I know as meatballs, besides their appearance, but more like a round breakfast sausage in taste and texture. Although, some people may enjoy the difference especially if they really love sausage. Working with ground sausage, is kind of new to me. I think they need more seasonings to work as meatballs, with marinara, like herbs or garlic. The flavor was very mild. I also did add 15 minutes to the bake time, without any other changes, just because I like ground meats cooked well. Might try crumbling the leftover cooked meatballs into other dishes.

Made as written except I used panko breadcrumbs. Flavorful and delicious; I used the Johnsonville sweet Italian sausage.  The wife said some of the best meatballs she's ever tasted, even beating my Spanish albóndigas.

Delicious!  Since the sausage is already so well seasoned, there's very little work to mixing these up and getting them ready.  Great with spaghetti or by themselves without sauce.

I also used a package of union soup mix instead of chopped onions. And I used half a pound of ground chuck and three links of spicy italian sausage with the casing removed. Simmered in homemade spaghetti sauce for 30 minutes to an hour. I can't wait to get to the leftovers that didn't make it into the spaghetti!

Great recipe. I used a 1/8 measuring cup to measure the size of the meatballs and the quantity came out to exactly be 20 meatballs.

This is my first time BAKING meatballs. I've always fried before. These were scrumptious, and I won't be frying anymore! I scaled up this recipe using 3 lbs. Johnsonville Mild Italian plus 1 lb. lean ground beef...I always omit the milk, because my eggs are xl and I don't need the extra moisture. This batch is going to a family reunion tomorrow and will be devoured, as usual. Note: I urge people to use ITALIAN sausage, or a mixture of Italian sausage and lean ground beef.  There is a huge difference between breakfast sausage and Italian sausage.

OH MY GOSH!!! What a absolutely delicious recipe.  This is the one that I have been looking for; all the others that I have tried don't even come close.  The only change was using 1/2lb of ground beef and 1/2lb of Jimmy Dean Sausage.  It was wonderful, and most importantly my kids ate it without one complaint.

We tried it and the family really loved it. Just bought 5 pounds of meat and will make all of it. Then I will portion out 15 to a bag, vacuum seal and into the deep freeze.
