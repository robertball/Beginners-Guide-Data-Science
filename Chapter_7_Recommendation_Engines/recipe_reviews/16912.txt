We took these camping and everyone enjoyed them. I was lucky enough to find some baby red potatoes that were all about the size of jumbo olives. I rubbed them with olive oil, garlic powder, and italian seasoning before putting them in the foil. I believe the seasoning on the spuds really added to the entire dish. It was great, and cleanup was a breeze! Thanks Kim.

This was great!  Added sliced baby carrots and substituted red and yellow bell peppers for the green.  Found that spraying the foil before loading the ingredients really helped it release from the foil.  I'm anxious to try this again, adding pineapple.

This is a great way to grill chicken and have it turn out moist and tender!  My kids are fussy and didn't want to eat the chicken with the onions and peppers, but they loved helping me assemble the "kisses".  I cut baby potatoes into small cubes and left the packages on the grill for 45 minutes and everything was cooked perfectly!

Really quick and easy.  Great for camping!  The potatoes came out a little under-done.  I'll make sure to put them on the bottom of the kiss next time to see if that helps

I love foil wrapped meals.  I didn't have bbq sauce, but had some Cajun garlic sauce which worked well.  I also added some chopped garlic and chili pepper.  Next time I'll use some fresh herbs and lemon. A nice base recipe!

It was very good! The meat came out very tender and juicy. Instead of putting them in individual foil packets, I bought the foil cooking bags and put it all in one big bag. It was great!

I didn't get this quite right but I am going to give it a 4 anyways. I do this normally w/o the chicken and BBQ sauce and we love it. Definately will make again tho.. One tip.... when wrapping the food in tinfoil, put a damp paper towel between the two pieces of tinfoil. It helps keep moisture in.

Pretty darn tasty. I should have used some cooking spray. My chicken got stuck to the foil, but other than that these were easy, fun, and yummy.

This recipe is so yummy! I always marinate chicken in italian dressing while its thawing and I tossed some melted butter and garlic powder with the potatoes. I baked them in the oven for 1 hour @400 degrees and these were mouth watering! I will definatly make these again! Thank you for such a super yummy and super cute recipe!

I'm only giving this three stars because I don't understand how the potato could possibly be cooked through at the same time as the chicken.  I opted to par cook the potato first. This was simple, easy and pretty good.

I'm giving this three stars because it was soooo easy to make and absolutely no clean up. The taste was awful. I really thought it was going to be better. The fact that there is no mess is what carries this recipe.

I made this for a recent camping trip and everyone loved it!  My kids don't like bbq sauce so I used Italian salad dressing instead for theirs.  We also used pineapple and it was a big hit.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I loved this recipe! I changed it up a little by replacing the chicken w/ another potato, I also put mushrooms w/ it. I cut up the potato fairly thin and put it on the bottom since it takes longer to cook. I also use honey barbeque sauce (I put alittle more on than recommended).

Pineapple really makes the difference with this dish!  Gives it that "teriyaki" flavor.

Great recipe. I modified it quite a bit. I thinned out the chicken by pounding it and then just seasoned it really good. I zapped the spinach in the microwave, cooled it, then chopped it. I then added sour cream, garlic, feta, sundried tomatoes and a little crushed red pepper. I added the mixture to the chicken and bonded it up with tooth picks. This is where I changed things a bit. I didn't add bacon. I put the chicken in foil pouches and baked them at 400 degrees for 30 min. Came out wonderful. No leftovers!

I baked these in the oven at 450 degrees for 60 minutes as another reviewer suggested. I also added pineapple chunks and sprinkled the chicken with cajun seasoning. I thought these turned out great! My husband however, did not like the pineapple and also thought there was too much BBQ sauce.

I baked this in the packets in the oven at 450 for an hour.  It turned out pretty good.  This is a basic, easy meal.  Next time, I might add some drained pineapple for punch.

I loved this recipe. I used several different summer vegetables and added in a few seasonings. It was really bland the first time without it. I also left out the bbq sauce and added a teaspoon of olive oil so it wouldn't dry out. Super easy to prepare and my husband didn't even mind doing the easy cleanup.

Good, quick cleanup meal. Didn't dice my potatoes small enough. Didn't cook in the same amount of time as the other ingredients.  Most importantly....make sure you have enough gas in your grill!!

My family really liked this easy to make BBQ recipe. If you know how to cut stuff up, then you can handle this recipe. I added about 4-5 Tablespoons of BBQ sauce and a little olive oil in each packet and it came out more moist than the recipe. Great to prepare ahead of time.

Chicken over cooked and the veggies didn't cook long enough.  Putting the barbecue sauce on top completely overpowered the subtle flavor of the peppers and onions but did nothing to help flavor the chicken.  Over all was pretty bland.

This is a good recipe with easy clean up.  Make sure to add some salt and pepper though.  The reason I am giving 4 stars instead of five is mainly because it just doesn't have enough flavor for me.

These were good. I "doctored" these up a bit with seasonings, a little bit of italian dressing and soy sauce. This was a fun change for the family. Thanks.

Bland and ordinary. Doesn't worth the time involved. Definitely not environment friendly. Will not make again.

This is a good recipe to build off from. It definately needs seasoning, very bland with just the BBQ sauce. It made for a nice dinner.

I thought the recipe was great.  I think the ingredients are a matter of personal taste...I did not care much for the potatoes but found that some of the other suggestions such as mushrooms and squash sound awesome! My family really liked this, and I felt good serving such a healthy meal.  Wonderful recipe!

A real winner!  My 6 yr old twin granddaughters "made their own dinner" while camping with us.  They enjoyed making it and ate it all too!  Grandpa and I also enjoyed them a whole lot!

We really enjoyed it. It was easy and did not require a lot of watching.  We added slivered almonds along with pineapple.

We did this with frozen chicken breasts and it worked wonderfully! It's an easy and tasty "meal in a kiss" that can be prepared ahead, frozen, and even taken camping! Our kids love it too!

Great recipe. My family uses the same idea, except we never thought to make them as kisses! I often slice a bunch of different veggies such as garlic, onion, celery, broccoli, cauliflower, peppers, potatoes, ect. This is a good "prepare your own" meal. I set all chopped ingredients out on the counter and everyone makes there own! Instead of BBQ sauce we use a drizzle of olive oil and herbs. Yum yum! We cook them with thinly sliced potatoes on bottom of the packet with the whole chicken breast and optional vegies on top for 1 hour :).

A friend was looking for a recipe for her husband's birthday dinner.  He loves Hershey Kisses and this was perfect for her presentation. ( He actually thought she was giving him a big, chocolate hershey kiss... much to his surprise ) This rating is based on her and her husband, as I did not make it.  She cut the potatoes small and added thin sliced carrots.  They both raved about the taste !   Thanks, Kim Jett for sharing to make his birthday special.

TRIED THIS LAST NIGHT - I OMITTED THE BBQ SAUCE, AS I WAS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING DIFFERENT, AND DID NOT WANT BBQ SAUCE ON THE VEGGIES. I USED OLIVE OIL, HERBS AND ZUCCHINI FROM MY GARDEN, RED BLISS POTATOES - CAME OUT VERY GOOD, EXCEPT THE VEGGIES WERE A LITTLE MUSHY - I THINK WITH EVERYTHING CUT IN CHUNKS, 30 MINUTES IS A LITTLE TOO LONG!
LOVED THE KISS IDEA - VERY CUTE - MY HUSBAND WAS SALIVATING OVER THE WONDERFUL SMELL AS THEY COOKED!
THANKS KIM - WILL DO IT AGAIN FOR MAYBE 20 MINUTES! I ALSO PUT A LITTLE GRATED CHEESE ON TOP, ONCE WE OPENED THE "KISSES" - IT MELTED IN A FEW SECONDS AND WAS DELICIOUS!

A good dish. Very easy to make and expand. I cubed all the vegetables and combined them in a large bowl with the barbecue sauce. I found spraying the aluminum foil with non-stick cooking spray to be very helpful. I also left the chicken breast whole, and brushed it wil barbecue sauce. A little bland, but stayed very hot. I've experimented with other vegetables. I really like potatoes, carrots, and onions. The pineapple seemed too sweet and juicy. A real crowd pleaser.

LOVED IT! I have now made this twice for my hubby and myself and him and I can't get enough. I added more veggies though. Broccli, mushrooms, squash, asapargus..it was great. I cooked it a little longer...chicken makes me nervous so I always cook it a little longer than suggested. A new family favorite...

The kids had fun with this one!  Tasted delicious for the simplicity of preparation!  I used KC Masterpiece BBQ sauce and it gave it a good tangy
kick.

Very quick and easy and delicious!  I made it for guests and tweaked the recipe a bit.  I cooked 2 breast halves with potato, onion, mushroon, green pepper, garlic, & barbeque sauce.  Mouthwatering!  I can't wait to try some new combinations.
