Fabulous!  I double the recipe (2.5 tsp yeast) for my 2 lb bread machine.  The bread is wonderful the next day, too!

This bread is great! The 15 year old young man in my house requests this on a regular basis. Once it rose so high it stuck to the top of the bread pan and one time it only raised half way.  Either way it still was delicious.  Most of the time it comes out perfect. Thanks, Chris.  You are popular in my house. Geri

I loved it! its a perfect recipe to throw into the bread machine. And heres a tip: when using the dry milk, substitute fresh milk for the amount of water called for, and don't use water. It makes the bread sweeter!

This is the BEST white bread I've ever tried for the bread machine. My nine year old will take a piece and eat it without butter for breakfast or a snack. She said, "Mommy, this bread is yummy." It also fits perfectly in my small Welbilt machine.

This recipe has proven to be the most tasty bread of the ones I've prevriously tried.  Only difference that I make is I use 1c of milk as opposed to 3/4 cup of water.  It makes a petite loaf of bread that is absolutely perfect.

Very simple and good bread.  Worked well with my machine.  I got my machine used without directions and the first loaf came out well with this recipe.  Thanks.

THIS DID MAKE A SMALLER THAN "NORMAL" LOAF IN MY BREAD MACHINE.  I WAS WORRIED THAT IT WOULD COME OUT SHORT SO I ADDED YEAST TO MAKE 2.25 TSPS.  THE FLAVOR WAS REALLY GOOD AND I BAKED IT ON THE MED DARKNESS SO THE CRUST WAS EXTRA CRUNCHY.  MADE THIS LOAF TO GO WITH STUFFED SHELLS AND THERE WAS NONE LEFT. VERY GOOD!

This is a great one. Tender with a good 
flavor, and very simple. I made it to serve
at a meeting with garlic and herb spread.
I got raves.

Okay, finally a loaf of bread that's a size I can use.  This tastes great and is perfect for what I need.  The loaf is small, but is perfect for the two of us.  We had a slice with a meatloaf I found here, hubby will have two meatloaf sanwiches for lunch tomorrow and we'll both have have toast tomorrow morning.  Thanks for this recipe!

This bread is wonderful!  Everyone in the house loved it.  I can't keep a loaf in the house.  Bread is very soft and light yet just right for sandwiches and snacking.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very yummy. This makes a really small loaf. I had to knead it more and let it raise another hour after the bread machine cycle because it didnt raise enough. Either cuz i did the yeast wrong or cuz my bread machine is not the best. dont really know.

I, like one of the other bakers, had a problem with it only turning out about 2 inches high. This was the first bread machine recipe that I measured out the 1 1/2 tsp of dry yeast instead of just putting the whole pack of yeast in. I think if I would have added the pack it would have turned out nicely.

I couldn't find my bread machine recipe book, so I thought I'd try this. It wasn't as light as my usual recipe, but it was tasty. Thanks!

The bread baker just finished and we already polished off the still warm bread. So.incredibly.good. Yummy. Except for maybe adding a little bit more salt than the recipe calls for, I wouldn't change a thing. Excellent recipe for white bread with a crunchy crust. We absolutely love it and will bake this more often for sure!!!!

This is a very good bread machine bread. It is not as tall as I would like it but it tastes very good. Has a fluffy inside and a soft outside.

This recipe did make small loaf. Only two out of the six people at dinner gave it 2 thumbs up. I personally didn't like the flavor at all. My search continues for the perfect bread recipe.
