Have used this same recipe from a slow cooker cook book, but it calls for long grain/wild rice blend with spice packet. Try chicken broth instead of veggie and carrots/celery/onions instead of mixed veggies. I skip the cheese all together. Add some pepper too.

The soup was OK.  Maybe would have been better with fresh veggies opposed to frozen.  Don't think I'll make it again.

not too bad really bland if you dont spice it up. Its really thick too. Youll want to put fresh cheese on the top after so it has more flavor AND use fresh veggies which makes it taste so much more better then frozen

just tried this tonight....really bland.... definitely needs some spicing up to taste decent..... and an hour for the lentils is a bit much... i found half an hour sufficient. great idea though! definitely filling..

Good soup! Very hearty and we liked the addition of lentils. Will make again. I used chicken broth instead of the veg. broth.
