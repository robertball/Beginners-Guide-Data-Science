Gluten free Barilla is made with rice and corn, giving it a lovely light golden color when cooked. It makes a nice canvas for the red onions and other veggies. The flavor is really nice, as well. The combination of sweet, roasted tomato and the savory onion is wonderful.The toasted pine nuts give it a crunchy finish. Very, very good!

This recipe is so good - super flavorful and you honestly would not know it is gluten free. I served it to friends at a dinner party, did not tell them it was gluten free, and they were shocked to hear at the end! The roasted tomatoes and caramelized onions add nice, sweet flavor that contrasts well with the nutty cheese. Definitely recommend making this.

I love the recipe it was quick and easy I did make a few changes as I cooked. I added fresh garlic to the caramelized red onions and a few to the roasted tomatoes as well. Are used spinach spaghetti pasta which is a great alternative to regular wheat pasta.I was very impressed with the dish overall it was delicious and everybody loved it I did add fresh basil along with the parsley right as I serve the dishes up! Yummy yummy I’ll definitely be making this again

I made the sauce as specified, and it was delicious. My husband and I loved it.  I didn’t use gluten-free pasta, as we are fine with gluten.  I will make this again, regularly.

I really enjoyed this recipe!  It has a clean and fresh flavor that is highlighted by the yummy pine nuts!  I made a half recipe, but next time I'll have to make the whole thing!  Thanks, Barilla!

Excellent flavor and very easy.  The extra cup of cooking liquid made it watery but did not affect the flavor.  Fresh parsley gave it a nice zing.
