I used shredded Parmesan and Mrs Dashes garlic and herb for seasoning. Just parchment paper, no non-stick spray. Easy!

Liked how fast these were to make.  Crispy edges.  I wish the center was crispy.    Tried the rosemary, which was okay, but I think cracked pepper is enough for next time. 

Thanks for the recipe.  Will make these again.  They are rich enough that just a few will be enough to satisfy when we're craving a savory snack.
--- 350 degrees, 10 minutes: crispy brown all the way!

Easy, fast, delicious. Only change I made was to use Penzey's roasted garlic instead of garlic salt. There is enough salt in parmesan cheese and hubby has to watch his salt. Did not notice any lack. Might try different spice/herb combos just for the fun of it. I only made two, because this was a last-minute dinner decision for just the two of us, and loved the ability to do just that! Thanks for this great recipe!

I am at high altitude;  I didn't think that should matter, but with a little bit of experimentation I discovered that I needed a few more minutes to make them more crispy and less chewy. I used a silicone baking mat, an electric oven, shredded my own cheese, and they were perfect at 7 min. For a lacier type of crisp spread the shreds out, this style is more prone to crumbling. For a more defined shape you can pile the shreds up a bit, but this is more sensitive to the time.

I used cilantro and garlic powder instead of garlic salt because Parmesan is salty enough by itself. The edges got crispy while the center remained soft so I think next time I will try it with a lower temp.

These were great! My only complaint would be that they are a bit salty. I think next time I'd use garlic powder rather than garlic salt. The cheese is salty enough so you don't need to add more.

At Friendsgiving where everyone had already offered to bring everything, so I needed a unique snack to bring.  This did it, they got lots of compliments.

I made it with grated romano (not my favorite). Just poured it in a pan and baked. First batch came out ok but not crispy. Second batch (parmesan) was too thin and came out crumbs. Third batch (parmesan) was crispy but still a little thin and crumbly. May try the small mounds next. Certainly tasty, all batches.

Baked cheese! They. Were gobbled up. Tried the garlic/rosemary than moved onto ranch seasoning (burnt up a little) and just garlic.  All versions were enjoyed. Thank you for posting.

The store had asiago instead of parmesan, so I used that instead. The crisps came out very good. I baked at 425 in convection mode, and it took about 5 minutes to get them golden brown. I will make them again!
