Delicious! Plus it's a great way to use up leftover grilled chicken or rotisserie chicken. I used 3/4 cup of Hellman's light mayo cut with 1/4 cup of reduced fat sour cream. I added a bit of curry powder for a little kick and I love the crunch from the celery. Since I didn't have any cashews on hand I added some chopped apple. This was perfect on toasted whole grain bread and didn't require any extra mayo or tomato, just some crisp lettuce - YUM!

This chicken salad was GREAT!! I made it for a party of about 30 people & everyone loved it. I ran a little short on mayo so I added a small amount of pineapple juice to keep it moist. I will make this again - just a smaller amount.

This is very good. I have made it several times and it's the only chicken salad recipe I make. We prefer extra nuts and craisins and I use light FF yogurt w/some lemon juice rather than mayo because of an egg allergy. It's also good with pecans instead of cashews.

I added twice the cranberries and no cashews...it tasted great because the chicken I used was grilled and blacked and it really added to the flavor! MMMM...

Wonderful! I prepared this for a group of friends who totally loved it, and today I'm sending them the recipe.  Besides being great for sandwiches, it would also be great on crackers.

Yummy!  I cut the recipe in half because I only had 2 chicken breasts.  I used 1 clove of garlic, minced, instead of powder.  We didn't top with lettuce or tomatoe but it was still just fabulous!  Perfect way to use that leftover chicken.

5 stars tailored to my own preferences. Used a rotisserie chicken, grapes instead of cranberries and walnut pieces instead of cashews. Alot of my substitutes were based on what I had on hand or what was on sale. It was brought to my attention that the garlic powder addition was very well recieved...I never used it in this kind of dish until I saw in this recipe. I also added green onions which were on hand but I personally would have added some onion even though this was not in the recipe. Having said all that I will definately try this recipe as written.

This was amazing!  Made it for a luncheon and everyone loved it.  Easy to make and tasted great. The sweet craisins and crunchy nuts are the perfect combination to make this chicken salad stand out.  I used almonds instead of cashews (personal preference), but otherwise made it exactly as the recipe instructs.  I kept the "extras" (tomatoes, lettuce, and some provolone slices) on the side for guests to add according to their personal preference.  Will definitely make this again.

This is absolutely delicious! I've been trying different chicken salad recipes, and this one was my favorite one so far. The dried cranberries really added to the flavor and cashews gave it a nice crunch. I've added this recipe to my favorites folder and I will definitely make this many times again.

I didn't happen to have any leftover chicken, but was really in the mood for chicken salad, so I just used canned chicken. I also didn't have celery salt, so instead of using garlic powder, I just used garlic salt in place of both ingredients. I also added apple, as another reviewer suggested. And I used candied pecans instead of cashews. Serve it up on some toasted wheat bread...oh MAN it's good! It's like a Waldorf Chicken Salad Sand! Mmmm...

I make this fairly often for lunches. My wife loves it and likes it even better when I add sliced red grapes to it. I use unsalted sliced roasted almonds instead of cashews and usually use the great canned chicken breast that I find at Costco unless I have leftover chicken.I cut back on the mayo by using some plain Nancy's yogurt. I eat it as a sandwich while my wife likes hers as a salad with some cottge cheese.

We thought this was just ok, but it won't become a favorite .  My grilled chicken had been marinated in Italian salad dressing, so maybe that flavor didn’t compliment the rest of the flavors in this.  I made 1/4 of this recipe which yielded me more than enough for two good-sized sandwiches.  I may try this again, perhaps using rotisserie chicken.

Made this grilled chicken salad 25+ times. I smoke chicken breast just to make this salad.  The smoked chicken adds a great taste to the salad. Thanks Erin!

So delicious!! I was never a huge fan of grapes in chicken salads but the dried cranberries are perfect. I followed the recipe almost exactly except instead of grilled chicken I used canned chicken and romaine lettuce. Best thing I've eaten in a while. Thanks!

Whole family loved it, even the picky eaters. No one wanted it as a sandwich. We ate it straight off the plate. Only change I would make is cutting back on the 1C mayo a hair. Makes it a touch soupy.

We love it. I make my husband lunch everyday and surprised him with this one. I used Costco chopped chicken. So I had to half the recipe. He loved it and so did I, I am not a fan of  canned chicken and it was really good. I used chopped almonds because that is what I had on hand.

Loved this recipe, as others commented I also used leftover roasted chicken in one batch and two weeks later I used leftover  baked teriyaki chicken the only departures from Erin's recipe.

So gooood! Lots of compliments. I left out the cashews, it might've been good but I just didn't want to try it

Delicious!  The salted cashews and toasted bread add to the layers of flavor . Shall definitely make over and over.

The cranberries were a different touch but if I make this again I'll sub for canned sliced or omit the cranberries period. Also used regular iceberg lettuce shredded and added to the mixture and went easy on the mayo because one cup is too much imo. I also added a slice of processed cheese. Added a small amount of cashews just to the sandwich to try it and will definitely not do that again, the sandwich didn't know what it was supposed to be, there's just too much flavors going on.

Love this for any leftover chicken. Quick and easy to make. Instead of cranberries I used grapes I had on hand. Yummy

I thought this was great!  The cranberries add a nice sweet touch.  I didn't have cashews so I subbed with some sliced almonds.  Delicious light lunch :)

Easy, delicious and so colorful! A big hit at our house. The only things I did differently were: I used pecan bits instead of cashews, seasoned with a pinch of salt and a dash of paprika at the end, and I added a little pineapple juice to moisten it. My husband thought it was great, but thinks I should add more dried cranberries next time. I've been wanting to make chicken salad for months and I'm so glad I chose this recipe. I'll definitely be making it again and again.
