This was a hit at a book study of ladies.  Severely decadent.  It's a keeper in my book.  Next time though I think I'll make it in a 9x13 pan instead of the 10x15, to make it just a little thicker.

I made this for a dinner party and it was wonderful.  I couldn't rate it a 5 star kid's love it, kids would prefer something less nutty I think, but it's great.  Don't panic when you pour the second layer on top, it sinks into the first and disappears.  I had to use a 9x12 pan so I cooked it a little longer than this called for.  It came out fine.  Try it, it's a keeper!

I followed the recipe exactly, except that I cooked the first layer for 25 minutes before adding the second layer.  After adding the second layer I baked my cake for 40 minutes, and it turned out so amazingly perfect.  Everyone who has tried it just can NOT get over it.  I used a 13x9 pan, and I think that you've got to add the extra time or it will not be cooked all the way through.

This recipe was a big hit with my husband since he's a huge pecan pie fan.  I thought it was good, but very sweet and rich.  I though it would have been better if it was a little thicker, but he said not to change a thing.  It looks like I will definitely be making this again.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  =)

This is very much like pecan pie without the crust.  It is gooey and rich, but that's what I love about pecan pie!  I made it with whole pecans, because that's how I make my pecan pie.  Served it warm and it was just wonderful!

I made this for the Christmas dinner at our church and everyone loved it.  It is so moist and gooey just like a pecan pie but much better than any pecan pie I've ever had.  Definitely our new favorite dessert!

This cake is awesome!  I don't even like pecan pie that much, but I LOVE this cake.  My mom, who loves pecan pie, said she likes it even better than pecan pie.  I added 1 cup of chocolate chips to the filling like someone suggested previously, and that was really good!  I cooked it about 10 minutes longer on the final bake time, and I think next time I will cook it even longer.  It is very rich and delicious.  My family has requested that I make it at least once a month!

This is an absolutely delicious, rich, buttery cake. I could not find butter pecan cake mix so I used a yellow cake mix and I used pecan halves rather than chopping them. I only had 1/2 cup corn syrup so I substituted agave for the other half. The baking time is definitely off.  Baked the first layer 30 minutes and the second layer 50 minutes.

I made this with chocolate cake mix and it got raves from everyone!! My husband LOVES pecan pie (especially choc pecan pie) and he loved this cake!! HEADS UP... I made it in a 9x13 pan, and baked it for 1 hr & 10 min AFTER the initial 20 min!! Next time I will bake the first layer for at least 30 min and go from there! It was fine with that long in the oven, though! Ice cream makes it even better!!  :)

OMG!  This is the BEST!  I think I am like other reviewers, I almost like this better than pecan pie!  I am so glad that I discovered this recipe.  It will definitely be a favorite from now on!

This is a wonderful recipe. As others stated it is gooey and somewhat difficult to serve. I also had a difficult time finding the cake mix. I used Betty Crocker Butter Pecan Cake Mix.

This cake is awesome!  I made this for my husband for his birthday and he thought it was so good that he couldn't believe he had never had it before.  I did up the baking time quite a bit based on the reviews--30 minutes for the first baking, 45 minutes for the second.  My edges were a bit overdone, so I'll probably do 25 and 35 next time.

I made this for a covered dish at work.  I got rave reviews and everybody wanted the recipe.  I didn't have butter pecan cake mix all I had was white and it still came out perfect.  I did cook it a little longer.  My husband told me to make it for Thanksgiving because he enjoyed it so much.  Thanks for the recipe

This was excellent!  I think it may actually be better than pecan pie.  I made it for a special occasion and it was a huge success!  I was going to serve it with vanilla ice cream, but the suggestion was made that whipped cream would be a great topping.  I didn't have any on hand -- but next time I will!  Thanks so much for sharing.

With every bite all I could say was "oh my gosh".  This is sooo good.  You can't describe it.  Just try it.  Yumm. May take a little longer to cook than the recipe says.

I have not made this particular cake but I made one similar several years ago. I cannot find the butter pecan cake mix made by Duncan Hines I think or any other brand. What is the name of the brand you use and where do you find it?

This cake is delicious.  Only thing I had to modify was the baking time for the second step, at 30 minutes it was still "soupy" and not brown.  I added about 15-20 minutes on to the baking time and took it out when it was golden brown.  The edges were hard, but tasted rather good!

I made this of the great reviews that it got and I love trying new recipes. I made this for work and they loved it. Hubby loved it also. It's rich and sinful, just like a pecan pie, but better becauset there's no crust to make! Thanks for the recipe!

I just made this cake yesterday and it is delicious! It is exactly like what you would think, a pecan pie mixed with a cake! When you pour the liquid mixture over the already cooked cake, it might take a minute, but it completely sinks into it and the cake even looks like it is floating a little. I made it in an 8x11 dish because my 9x13 was missing. Even thought it came out pretty good anyway I would not recommend using anything other than a 9x13. I ended up having to cook mine a lot longer (like 20 minutes longer) and I don't think it came out as evenly cooked as it could have. And it also barely fit in the 8x11 dish. But it was still really good and I will definitely make it again soon!!!

This cake is absolutely awesome.  When I went to add the second layer, I thought something's wrong, this isn't going to turn out...wrong! My husband said it was the best cake he had ever eaten!

This was a big hit at the dinner party last night. I followed the recipe as is, didn't feel like it needed any adjusting. The outer layer is the best part. The combination is melt in your mouth good. The cake itself is very moist. I think it's even better than pecan pie. Great recipe. Thanks for sharing with us.

I am getting ready to make this cake for the second time and realized I never rated it the first time. Initially I made this after I went looking for something pecan-ish for my new niece-in-law who adores anything with pecans. The whole family LOVED it, even my husband who usually hates anything with nuts. This is totally worth a try and totally worth the outrageous amount of butter and sugar!!

I used pecan halves...  Really good with whipped cream but beware... it is SUPER rich and sweet!  I can only eat a small piece...  My husband said it should be super rich and sweet, just like a pecan pie...

This is a really weird cake to make... I'm still not sure if I did it right. There should really be some description of what the cake should look like/move like/feel like before you pour the second layer onto the first. That being said, it was tasty... Whatever it was...

I have made this cake many times, and each time I do, it gets rave reviews - everyone loves it!  I give it 5 stars without hesitation.  It has become my signature dessert.  When I show up at a get-together, everyone looks to see if I have pecan pie cake.  : )

Delicious! I used all butter (I REFUSE to buy margarine! YUCK!) and had to up the second baking time significantly. I used pecan halves I had left over from Christmas, and did not bother to chop them. I sprinkled some more on top of the second layer before popping back in the oven. Serve with fresh whipped cream, and it's a little piece of heaven!

I followed this recipe exactly, just baked for 45 minutes as suggested by other reviews. It set up completely and wasn't runny. Next time I will add more nuts and corn syrup,if a dessert is sweet I like it REALLY sweet. I could not find Butter Pecan Cake so I used Chocolate mix, it was very good. Never would have thought of it if I didn't see it here. Thanks

I love the concept of this recipe. However, it wasn't as good as I thought it would be after reading so many rave reviews. I think the biggest problem I have with it is the texture. So many previous reviewers mentioned the gooiness. Personally, I just think it's half-raw when baked as directed. I left it in an additional 10 minutes but couldn't wait any longer to take it out to make room for the Thanksgiving turkey. I think it could have stayed in another 10-15 minutes and I would have liked it better. I did like the outside edges as they were more "done" than the center. No one ate the center of the cake. If I try it again, I'll bake it a LOT longer, though I don't think I'll be making it again.

Oh my goodness!!! This cake is delicious! I made it for a family reunion using the butter pecan cake mix in a 9x13 pan. They were scraping the pan clean. The second baking I cooked a full 35 minutes then set it out to cool. It firmed up perfectly. Would not change a single thing. Thanks so much

upped the bake time by about 20-25 minutes.  I used one bowl for both layers..don't worry if its not perfectly mixed in (I had chunks on my cake after pouring on layer 2) but it turned out SPECTACULAR!! Exactly what you'd expect from a cake with 2 cups sugar and a cup corn syrup!!

Absolutely delicious!  I rarely have "flops", but I was convinced this was going to be one when it came out of the oven all wiggly and jiggly.  But it set up and when we tasted it, we loved it!

After the second baking period, the top of this cake still looked WET!  Helpfully, I had read the other reviews talking about the "ooey-gooey" consistency, so I baked mine another 20-25 minutes, until the top looked cooked.  It was exactly like a pecan pie without the crust, nothing runny or "ooey" about it.  Wonderful recipe, but I think you will enjoy it better if you double that second baking time.

My husband is a Pecan Pie Lover!!! So when I told him about Pecan Pie Cake he had his doubts, but after tasting it (3 servings) of it this is now his favorite!!!! The only thing I changed was, I used halfed Pecan instead of chopped.

Definite thumbs up! Will make it many more times! The only thing I varied on was the corn syrup.  I used Dark although the recipe said light.  I'm just used to pecan pie having the dark and prefer it's flavor.  It turned out fabulous though, so I won't be switching!  Enjoy!

I made this cake exactly like it said but I don't know if I baked it too long or what but it was very hard and sticky when it cooled. It had a great taste but it was very hard.  I will try again at a later time.  I loved the taste.

I made this using the butter pecan cake mix. It is really rich but what pecan pie isn't? I am just not sure about the texture. Maybe it will be different after it cools more? We will see. But I don't think I will make it again. Other reviewers said better than pecan pie...I am really glad they like it, and it wasn't horrible, but I will stick to the pie! Thank you for sharing it.

I have made this cake twice now. I love pecan pie but prefer cake to pie crust. So for me it's the best of both worlds! I topped it with homemade whipped cream. . . so yummy!

This was delicious and well received by all!  I did have to bake it quite a bit longer than indicated the 2nd time because it was quite jiggly in the center for awhile.  Eventually it firmed up a bit, and even more so once out of the oven.

My husband loves pecan pie and had been looking for a cake version that was close. Well, this recipe definately does it!! Has the cake with the pecan pie  taste. I make it for thanksgiving and his birthday every year with butter pecan mix, and it disappears each time.   If too sweet for some, use a vanilla cake mix or even angel cake mix.  YUMMY!!

My newest favorite. Shared at work, was a huge hit. Baked longer than recipe says though. Add 5 minutes to the first layer and 10 minutes for the second layer.

Okay, here's my take on this recipe. I'm diabetic as is most of my family. I used a 13x9 aluminum pan even though the lady who gave me the recipe said the batter almost overflowed her pan. Her recipe called for white cake mix, but I had yellow and went for it. Instead of using a full cup of brown sugar in the first half of the recipe, I used 1/2 cup. The one-third batter almost doesn't cover the entire bottom of the pan. Didn't even notice that I had forgotten to add the 2 cups of pecans and the first bake had been going for about 5 minutes. I poured the pecans on top of the first bake and pressed them down slightly. As with several of the other reviewers, I had to leave the first bake in the oven for 25 minutes instead of 20. Now for the second bake. My only changes were that I used 1/2 cup of sugar instead of 1 cup and I used just one egg in the reserved 2/3 batter. Because I used 1/2 cup sugar I reduced the milk to 1/2 cup also. By the time you add in the milk you will have a very liquid batter, very unlike the first bake. There is no way this cake is ready at 30 minutes. My cake had to stay in the oven for 50 minutes just so the center didn't giggle. The second bake did fill the pan to the top but after baking, the two layers settled down. My verdict, 3 eggs were just fine and the cake was very sweet even after the sugar reduction. I will try again to tone down the sweetness by not adding in the white sugar. P.S. I finely chopped the pecans to cut the gooey cake.

This is my go-to cake for any event! I am making it for the 4th time today for my friend's birthday who has never even had pecan pie! This cake will forever ruin pecan pie for her; it is that good! YES it does take longer to bake. But to those reviewers who dismissed the recipe because they couldn't wait an additional 10-15 mins, y'all missed out big time!

Need more instructions or pictures to help with bake time on this cake, since it's an unorthodox preparation to add a layer on top of a baked layer.  What is the correct doneness for the first layer?  How do you know when second layer has baked long enough?  I'm sure mine will be concrete when it cools, because it seemed like it needed significantly longer to bake than recipe indicates.  After 20 + 25 minutes, it was still liquid...  Also, I'm glad i put the cake pan on a cookie sheet, because it baked out alllllll over the place.  Because of all the rave reviews, i want to get it right!  HELP!

Gene Peter shared the recipe with me.  I made the cake for family and friends, and they wanted the recipe, too.  Gene was right--it's "to die for!!"

I used 1/4 cup butter in the first part by mistake it only made it a little difficult to spread but the taste and texture was fine.
I brought it into work and got rave reviews...
Mostly.."to die for"
