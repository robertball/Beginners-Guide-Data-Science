This was excellent. I left out the onions and bacon and added chicken. Instead of serving 12 it served dinner for two!

The dressing is sweet and tangy.  It belongs in the finest restaurants.

fabulous!  i used bacon bits (made from soy) from the grocery store salad dressing section since we don't eat pork products.  one time, i stir-fried some chopped-up chicken breast pieces in salt, pepper, and garlic powder and threw it into the salad...made a fantastic lunch.  wonderful for the summer and everyone has loved it so far.

FANTASTIC!! If I could give it 6 stars I would.  I love the dressing, it's great on any salad.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and a little less sugar.

This is such a hit!  The sauce is a little too sweet tho.  I almost always serve this when I entertain guests.  Sometimes, I alter the recipe and put pistaccio for nuts and mangoes for fresh fruits.  The fruits can also be omitted.  The sauce is just perfect with mixed greens alone.

Absolutely delicious!  The flavors are amazing together.  This is my favorite salad, and everyone I have served it to thinks it's fabulous as well.  This is a great salad for company or anytime.  I have also used the dressing on other salads with greens and fruit in them â€“ it always goes well.
