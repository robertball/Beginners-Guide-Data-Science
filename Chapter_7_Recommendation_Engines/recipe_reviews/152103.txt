Wow! This is delicious! It is a little bit of work but boy is it worth it! I did add toasted walnuts and used a little less of the cloves and nutmeg but otherwise followed the recipe exactly... will be making this again!

I am rating this recipe solely based on the changes I made. I have already rated it based on the way it was written.

I changed the serving size to 24 because as written, it will make 3 loaves. By changing the size to 24, it makes 2 loaves.

I used 1 cup puree for each loaf. I used half granulated sugar and half brown sugar. This gave it a deeper, more rich flavor. I cut the cloves in half as they were too strong for my liking. And instead of oil, I used unsweetened apple sauce with 1 tablespoon oil before measured.

With the above changes, the bread was exceptionally moist and flavorful. The applesauce rids the bread of greasiness that sometimes comes with this type of bread. 

I will be trying it with my changes with fresh pumpkin as well.

YUMMERS! I will definately be saving this recipe and making it again. My husband only tasted it (not hopefully) because his Mom had always taught him to try a "no thank you bite" of things. lol He ended up eatting half the batch. I didn't have any allspice so I omitted it. But this bread was great. I look forward to trying out different veggies and variations with this basic recipe in the future. Carrot bread, banana bread, pumkin bread...... mmmmm

Not too sweet, very good for breakfast. Reminds me of the ones I used to get at Starbucks.

I really liked the idea to puree the zuchini. My kids usually wont eat zucchini bread because of "all the green things" in the bread. I used 1 cup of applesauce instead of the oil and it is very moist bread that even the kids love!

This recipe is amazing! I have only used it with zucchini, but I imagine it would work with a number of other vegetables.

I scaled to 12 servings to make 1 loaf. I had an enormous zucchini from my neighbour's garden, I cut it up and steamed it in the microwave for 15 minutes, drained off liquid then pureed. I used 2/3 cup of zucchini puree and it worked fine, froze the rest for future loaves. I halved the sugar amount and used brown sugar, I halved the oil amount and used melted butter, used pumpkin pie spice for the spices, I used Robin Hood Flax flour for the all purpose. My loaf baked in 55 minutes. Very tasty, tastes exactly like pumpkin loaf! #FreshFaces #AllrecipesAllstarsCanada
