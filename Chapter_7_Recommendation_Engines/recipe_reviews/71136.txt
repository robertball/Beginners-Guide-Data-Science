Wonderful!!!!!  Made my meal!  I used a thick blue cheese dressing instead of crumbles...just to make it creamier.  And I also used  dijon mustard instead of powder.  This sauce made my beef taste amazing.  Thank you so much!  Will use again and again!

I used sour cream instead of heavy cream.  We made little sandwiches of beef tenderloin, arugula, and vidalia onion on ciabatta.  This is an easy sauce to make that is absolutely delicious.  Thank You!

Absolutely delicious!  My husband and I followed the recipe exactly and we couldn't believe how good it was on our ribeye steaks.  Our only "complaint" about the recipe is that we don't ever have heavy cream in the refridgerator so it will mean a trip to the store each time we want to make it!

nevermind the brisket i made this sauce for, i want to dip my entire body in this sauce and roll around.  it's delicious.  being the cheese fiend i am, i think i'll add extra bleu cheese next time.  also, i doubled this recipe just because of the size of the horseradish jar.  i now have enough horseradish sauce for an army.

Yum!  I used blue dressing and left out the cream.  Try it with seared tuna!

This was OK, but didn't like the consistency.  I will try this again using sour cream instead of milk, Worcestershire sauce instead of mustard powder and add a little garlic powder.

I added slightly more horseradish because I prefer a sauce a bit more spicy, but is still good as is
