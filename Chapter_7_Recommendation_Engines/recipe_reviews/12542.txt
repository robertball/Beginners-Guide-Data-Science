I thought this recipe was very good! I omitted the nutmeg and topped it with a light and fluffy meringue before topping it with toasted coconut.  Delish!  I will definitely make it again.

I think this is an execellent recipe. I made the recipe as written and it came out as perfect as any pie I have ever made. It didn't have any leftovers, and people asked for the recipe. Super easy to make!

i found this very runny and had to throw it away...i wasn't sure if the instructions were too vague, if the measurements were off or what the problem was, but i baked it an extra 20 minutes and it still didn't congeal properly

This was quick and easy to make. Not so sickingly sweet like most of the coconut cream pies out there. Everyone really enjoyed it and I was asked to write out several recipe cards. I just told everyone about myrecipe.com instead.

I altered the recipe just a tad. I added about a 1/2 box vanilla pudding the smaller box. Also once cooled i topped with cool whip & toasted coconuts. This recipe is a hit. Love it.

This is an easy, delicious pie to make when you are busy.  A great recipe!.  I made it 3 times the first week to share with people at work and for my family.  Everyone loves it.

Had no problem with consistency like some of the other reviewers mentioned.  However, I wouldn't categorize this as a cream pie. It is closer to a custard pie. I also agree that the coconut flavor was also not very strong.  It is a tasty pie- but not what I would expect considering it is called a coconut custard pie.

The pie turned out to a decent consistency but the flavour was not great - very eggy. I also had to leave it in for about 15 extra minutes, which resulted in the crust getting a bit burnt.

Like some of the other reviewers, I found this did not work out. I don't know if I am just to inexperienced a cook and the directions were to vague or if I did something else incorrectly, but the end result was a funky consistancy and I had to cook it an additional 20 minutes to get it to set.

Egg yolks in this recipe make it taste too eggy.  Perhaps just egg whites would make it taste better.

Quick and easy pie.  Took 5 minutes to prepare.

Really easy recipe but my family and I just did not find that it met our taste buds.  Had sort of a bland taste and seemed like it was missing something,pudding maybe?

Even though this was very easy to make - it wasn't extremely tasty.  Personally, I didn't care for the crunchy top (from baking), followed by the gushy middle.

Comes out perfect every time! Sometimes I substitute coconut milk for regular milk.

I made this using coconut milk from a carton and fresh coconut that I ground in the food processor.  I used about 1 1/4 cups of coconut, and used ginger and cinnamon instead of nutmeg, since I don't like nutmeg. It needed to be cooked about 20 minutes more than the recipe stated.  Also, I would call this custard rather than a cream pie.  If I make it again, I will reduce the sugar, as I found it a little too sweet.  Overall it was good and very easy.
