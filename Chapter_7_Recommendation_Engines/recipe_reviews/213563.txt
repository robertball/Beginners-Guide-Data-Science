I just put "Kosher Seasoning Salt" on my crispy homemade french fries, and it taste surprisingly like the seasoning salt that the "New york Fries" franchise uses. Good stuff! Thank you DAVES_POOKY for sharing your recipe.

Trying to limit sodium intake, so cut salt amount in half.  The spices more than make up for the lost salt flavor.  Thanks!!
