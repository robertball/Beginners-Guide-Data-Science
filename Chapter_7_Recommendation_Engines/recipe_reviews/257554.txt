I had some wonderful blackberries so I tried this salad. I used grated ricotta salata instead of feta because that is what I had. Followed everything else and it came out great.

Well, I goofed on this recipe but even with my goof it was excellent. I had walnuts on the brain due to a salad I made earlier in the week. I had assembled the dressing the night before so that the flavors would have time to mesh and on the night of I just threw the rest of it together off of memory instead of pulling the recipe up again. Turns out my memory failed me and I used walnuts instead of almonds. They worked nicely too but my husband would have much preferred the almonds that the recipe called for. He still gave it a big thumbs up though so I am anxious to make it again using  the almonds. I really liked the sesame flavor with the blackberries and feta. I wasn't sure how all of these ingredients would pair together but they all paired great. This one is a keeper! Thanks for sharing!
