Hate to say, but I gotta say it...I made from-scratch biscuits yesterday and these Garlic Cheese Biscuits, that begin with baking mix, beat them hands down.  Not even close.  Never mind the complete ease in making them (you could probably even make these blind-folded)  - these are just fabulously light, fluffy, and flavorful, not to mention gorgeous.   Didn't, wouldn't, change a thing.

Great quick biscuit to make for breakfast. This literally came together in five minutes. I used my own homemade biscuit mix and I increased the garlic powder to a half teaspoon. The family LOVED them. What they didn't eat for breakfast, my husband took to work with him.

I also used my own baking mix instead of Bisquick. I changed a few other things based on other similar recipes on this site too: I added 1/2 tsp of Old Bay Seasoning, 1/2 tsp onion powder, and 1 tsp of parsley. I mixed all of the seasonings and herbs into the mix. Cut the butter down to 2 Tbsp, but still brushed it on top. Baked the biscuits for 2-5 min after brushing with butter.

Super yummy! I didn't have biscuit mix so I made my own; 2 cups flour, 2 tsp baking powder, 1/4 tsp baking soda, dash of salt. I made with extra sharp cheddar and a dash of ground oregano. There where no survivors after dinner and my teen asked to make an extra batch for breakfast. :)

My fianc√© is picky when it comes to biscuits but these WON HIM OVER !! They are so delicious :) I used Smoked Gudam cheese , & added 6 spoonfuls of real mayonnaise!! It makes the biscuits soft & full of a mouth bursting experience ! Even hours of the biscuits sitting out they are Still Soft !!! :) you must try this at home

Simple, but wonderful. I have made other versions of this recipe and have learned through experience that I prefer the thicker version of shredded cheese; it provides a cheesier taste explosion with each bite, and that's a good thing.

This recipe completes the cooking trinity: easy, fast and good.  Made twice both with hearty winter soups (minestrone and a chili). Keeping in my quick go-to rotation.

I cooked these exactly as the recipe stated with absolutely no subsitions. I made 4 dozens of these bisquits for a church dinner and they disappeared out of all the bisquit choices there....FIRST! They hardly lasted warm because we were eating them almost as fast as they came out of the oven.

Great change up on normal drop biscuits.  I did add a decent amount of fresh chives (had to use them up) to the mixture before baking. Use a shredded cheddar cheese blend you really like as it is a dominant flavor in the biscuit.  Next time I plan on spicing these up with spicy pepper jack cheese and serving with chili.  This is a great basic recipe that is super easy to modify to your family's taste.

This is the recipe I have always used for these biscuits, and they are good; I like to use regular or sharp cheddar though. Yesterday, however, I decided to try 1 tsp garlic powder in the dough, and upped the garlic powder to 1/2 tsp in the butter mixture and added 1/2 Tbsp parsley flakes to the butter. They were very flavorful and wonderful with spaghetti and meatballs.

Made a double batch of these to serve with beef stew tonight.  They were a hit with the family, who are very picky eaters.  I did add a little bit of the garlic powder in the mix as well since we all LOVE garlic and used only 2 TBS of butter per batch.  I can see making some additions in the future to go with different kinds of entrees, but even on their own as is, fantastic!!

This recipe is wonderful! I made a lot of recipes from this website but by far this one is the best that i felt I should review it. Incredibly easy to make! Very flavorful, and everything you need you should have in your household. I kneaded it with my hands though and rolled biscuits with my hands as well. They came out looking wonderful and tasting even better. I always follow recipes just the way they are and this one came out wonderful, next time i will add more spices to the melted butter and try and see what the family likes most, my husband loved them so much and said he wants them everyday with his lunch! :) thank you so much for the wonderful recipe.

Good recipe, didn‚Äôt have biscuit so I used the dough recipe mentioned in another review. 2 cups flour, 2tsp baking powder, 1/4tsp baking soda. I also added some garlic powder to the dough and will put more in next time to give it more of a kick. I used sharp cheddar and think I might put more cheese in next time and experiment with other types of cheese. Easy and everyone enjoyed them.

Great biscuits! I had an extra carton of fat free half and 
half so I substituted that for the milk and added Old Bay.

They tasted good, but I wont be using Bisquick next time as I think Bisquick tastes a bit musty, and makes baked goods very dense. This is a good recipe overall, and I would use again, but maybe with a baking mix substitute. I used sharp cheddar instead of mild as that's all I had.

I made this using a homemade biscuit mix recipe that I have. Since the recipe said that it only made 5 servings, I doubled the recipe, and, wow did it make a LOT of biscuits!  I had two baking sheets filled.  I assumed that 1 biscuit was 1 serving, I guess that I assumed incorrectly, that is why I rated 4 stars.  They were good, mine took 10 minutes to bake.  Will make again but will not double it unless I have a lot of guests over for dinner.

I added a bit garlic salt to the biscuit mixture. Halfway through baking I took theses biscuits out of the oven to spread butter over them. I then sprinkled a bit of oregano on top of the biscuits, then put them back in to finish baking.

These were absolutely divine!

Just made these--they're yummy !!  Crunchy outside & fluffy within.  I did add a little bit more milk as all the mix/flour wasn't getting mixed in & I didn't want to overmix.
Fast, easy, & very tasty !!  Thank you, Mossyoakgrl !!

Easy peasy.  Yes, to using a sharp cheese instead of a milder one.  I have limited space for staple storage, but a person can make their own "biscuit mix".  The recipe has been out there for decades.  I'm not going to get into the drop vs rolled and cut biscuit debate.  It's about the taste, right?  I also like that it uses milk instead of buttermilk.

This recipe is a great go to if you're short on time. I doubled the recipe and added a cup of milk more than what it asked for because my mix a little bit dry. For my buiscuit mix, I mixed 4 cups of flour, 4 tablespoons of baking powder and 1 tsp of salt. I baked it for 15 minutes and they came out light and fluffy. Absolutely delicious and scrumptious!

I made these with Gluten Free Bisquick and they turned out GREAT.  Had to make a few modifications, added baking soda,
1/4 cup more milk, but darn tasty!!!!

Turned out great! I added 1/4 tsp garlic powder to the batter to give it more of a garlic taste. I also added 1/2 tsp Italian seasoning to the garlic butter.

Made this without changes and found they were a little bland. Will definitely use a sharp cheddar vs. a mild cheddar next time to amp up the cheese flavor. All in all, not a bad biscuit and very quick to make.

Love these! I must admit though I double the amount of cheese. So good! Sometimes I will also chop up jalape√±o if I want to give it an kick.

This was a big hit with my family - soft, cheesy, & garlicy.  I made with buttermilk instead of milk because I needed to use it up and added some dried parsley to the butter mixture.  Very easy to put together and so tasty.   I saved the leftover biscuits in a baggie and the next day reheated at 400 degrees for 5-6 minutes.  Top was slightly crunchy with a soft buttery inside - tasted just as good the second time around.  Thanks for the recipe!

So quick and yummy - the only change I made was using Lawry's Roasted Garlic Salt instead of the garlic powder.  I has some oregano and basil which add a little flavor and color to the biscuits.

Made my own buscuit mix from another recipe on this sire.  Added the garlic powder to the buscuits before baking.  Doubled the recipe.  6 very happy customers including three 17 year old boys!  20 minutes from starting to add the ingredients to coming hot out of the oven.  So convenient with our hectic schedule.  Thanks for this recipe!  My son came home from basketball practice looking for more... but they were long gone!

Had these for dinner last night to go with some homemade chili, I kind of goofed up I put the garlic powder in with the dough but it still came out great. I think the next time I make them will use fresh minced garlic to give them a more garlic flavor. It was a really easy recipe to make.

I have made these several times now and they are perfect.  We like them better than Red Lobster's biscuits.  I do use my own homemade biscuit mix that I always have ready in the pantry.  Thanks for sharing!
