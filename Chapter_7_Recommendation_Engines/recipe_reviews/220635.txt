My 13 year old made this for a pool party last night. It was easy, fast and cheap to make.  We replaced the peaches with canned cherries. Huge success!

Very easy recipe. I halved the recipe for one pie.  I couldn't find peach preserves, so I used apricot.  I made the low fat version with light cream cheese, cool whip free, and 10 oz. jar of all fruit spread.  I think next time I'd leave out the powdered sugar.  Don't think it needs the extra sweetness.

Followed the recipe exactly (well, I used homemade peach preserves from my tree instead of buying them at the store *LOL*) and the whole family REALLY liked it!  It's light, creamy and refreshing and the peach/cheesecake combo is something you don't see every day.   I'll definitely make this again!

what can I say?
I used real peaches, not the preserves, and chopped them up, placing some in the mixture and some on top. Everyone adored!!!

I made this for a larger gathering so decided to put it in a 9 x 13 container instead of pie shells. I also added slices peaches to the top with the raspberry drizzle. Delicious!

I  thought this desert was very light and tasty. It cleansed your palet well.I added a dash of cinnamon to mixture , then once itâ€™s put in graham crust I put cool whip on the top of pie and sprinkled cinnamon onto cool whip .pie was  delicious.

I would give this 2 1/2 if I could. To me, it's bland. I followed the directions exactly, but it needs something- I'm not sure what, maybe a different preserve with more flavor as even the crust overpowers it. Would be good for a child to make, as it's super simple. Didn't taste anything like cheesecake.
