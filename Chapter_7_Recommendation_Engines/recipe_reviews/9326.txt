There must be an error in the quantity of apple cider. If this recipe serves 30 then the servings are only 1/4 cup in size. Standard drink servings are 1 cup.

This was ok. I would suggest leaving out the lemon juice as I thought it was a bit too tangy. I also had to strain the punch to get the cloves out lest someone choke on one. Lastly I made an adult version and added some good dark spiced rum to this and served it warmed in my crock pot. Think I'll make this again...
