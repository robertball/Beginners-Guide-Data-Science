This recipe was wonderful.  It really grew on us and tasted even better the second day after the flavors melded some.  It also gave me something to do with the yolks after I make egg white cookies!!  I took the tip of cutting the sugar to (2/3 of the original) and it was great.  ighly recommend trying this one.

delicious!! This is a good variation on pecan pie.  Used 1/2 the sugar and it was fine.

Not a very good recipe, although ALL directions were followed thoroughly, the pie seemed gummie, and was not cake-like.

I’ve made this pie for decades, Hubby loves it.  I now make it with Splenda and an almond-flour crust as he is now a diabetic. 

The texture is not like that of any cake that I’ve ever made.
