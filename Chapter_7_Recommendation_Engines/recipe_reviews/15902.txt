I really liked this pie recipe!  It was simple yet flavorful. The only thing I did differently was to bake the pie at 400 for about 30 minutes to avoid a soggy crust, but will definitely keep this recipe to use for the future.  Thanks!

This was really good pie! We loved it. I used an assortment of apples:
2 Fujis
2 Granny Smith
2 Golden Delecious
I think that's one of the secrests to a really good apple pie,  combining really good apples together.
I also ended up adding more cinnamon than called for, about 1 tsp as well as 1/2 tsp of nutmeg as I really like a spicy apple pie. I slpashed about 1 tblp of real mexican vanilla over the top of the apples, before I put the top crust on. 
To top it off, I brushed 2-3 tblsp mented butter on the top crust, and sprinkled it with a few tblsp granulated sugar. This made for a beautifuly golden, and crispy top crust. I served it warm with fresh whipped cream. YUM!!!!!

Yummy.. this was great. I omitted the butter and instead added 10 caramels, cut in half. I put half the apples in the crust, then half the caramels, then the remaining apples and caramels. Brushed the crust with cream and sprinkled with sugar before baking. Absolutely wonderful.

This was by far one of the best apple pies I've ever made!!  I used a combination of granny smith and cortland apples.  I also drizzled approximately 1 tbsp of real lemon juice over the apple/flour mixture once I put it into the pie shell.   This pie had the perfect combination of tart/sweet taste.  Warmed up with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top - absolutely heavenly!!! I use frozen pie crust for the bottom of the pie and my own recipe for the top!!  I use the recipe off of the can of Crisco.  It has always been a foolproof recipe for me.  The two tricks to flaky crust (as taught to me by my mom), try to handle the dough as little as possible.  Also use ice water. This time around I also tried chilling the shortening - was one of the best crusts I've ever made!    Happy Baking!!

I cut up the amount of apples you had in the recipe and had enough for 2 1/2 pies. I put the extra [with all the seasonings] into a sauce pan, added a litle water and cooked until soft. About 30 seconds in the blender and had the best cinnamon apple sauce ever. Great recipe.

I rated this a tad lower than most of the other reviews because I feel it necessary to alter the recipe to include  1/4 cup of brown sugar and 1 tsp nutmeg.  The pie was not sweet enough without the brown sugar, and nutmeg was necessary to compliment the cinnamon.   I used this recipe in a 9 inch glass pie dish and baked it at 350 for 55 minutes.

I used the Pillsbury refrigerated pie crust and the pie came out perfect.  It was the best apple pie I've made.  I also used the food processor to cut the apples really thin and I think that helped.

This pie was very easy, in fact it was the first time I ever made a pie.  I had way too many apples, even though I used a deep dish, so I left some out.    The only thing is that next time I will add more sugar--its just didn't seem sweet enough.  But it was still really good.

My children enjoyed this pie very much. I made this for Thanksgiving. It was my first time making an apple pie from scratch. This recipe made it easy. My pies turned out great. I will use this recipe again.  
Thanks.

Absolutely fantastic!!!! If you double the recipe it can make 3 pies that are winners! I did add nutmeg to flour/sugar mixture and also put 1/4 tsp of vanilla on top of the apples once they were in the pie shell. Will be using again and again - thanks!

This is a great starter recipe for apple pie. I did make a few modifications to the recipe. I used 2 granny smith, 2 red delicious & 2 braeburn apples. To the mix I added 1 additional tablespoon of flour, 1 tbsp. unpacked brown sugar & 1/8 tsp. nutmeg. After mixing the filling together and placing in the pie crust recipe I also got from AllRecipes, I sprinkled about 1 teaspoon of corn starch across the top to help thicken up the sauce.  The pie turned out great. Thanks!

WONDERFUL RECIPE! I used the Pillsbury Pie Crusts (2 in a box, bought 2 boxes). I followed recipe exactly, expect for cutting about 15 Kraft Caramels in half, then adding to the first half of the apples that were added to the pastry shell, then I added the rest of them once the rest of the apples were in the shell, and then about 1 tsp pf vanilla extract to top it off. I cut about 1 and a half of the other crusts into strips in order to lace the top of the pie. (picture available in picture box). Remember to slice your apples pretty thin so the apples can cook down enough while baking. Rewarm the pie before serving and ice cream goes GREAT with it. Especially home made! ;) My hubby who NEVER eats any kind of pie ate some of this one and LOVED it! It is the best apple pie I have ever had and everyone who ate it said the same thing! I used a variety of apples though, so I could catch the flavor of each one. I will be using this recipe plus the Kraft soft-chew caramels EVERYTIME now!!! Thanks for the great recipe!

Years later and I still make this pie. I actually sell about 15 a year to regulars at the restaurant I used to work at who order them for parties they have or attend. It's delish with the caramels and vanilla!

Very good. It wasn't to sweet just the way I like it! It would have been better but I made the crust which was a nice crust but, well, I am a terrible pie crust maker.

Very good apple pie. I did double the apples and sugar; than put in a 10" shell. I did not double the flour,cinnamon or butter and it was great and very juicy. I like piled high apple pie. Pie making is my most favorite thing to do!  I like to decorate with the extra pie dough.

Let me tell you something: I made this pie for my boyfriend's family, and his father said that it was better than his mother's (my boyfriend's grandmother's) pie. That's all that needs to be said for how great this pie is.

I tried this recipe looking for an easy apple pie to make. My family loved it! I did cheat and use the Pillsbury crust, I also added a little vanilla and nutmeg along with a shot (or two) of ground ginger. I did leave it set for about 3 hours before serving so it wasn't to runny. Thanks for a great recipe, I am going to be making this often!

I just returned from a Christmas party and the guests raved about this delicious pie that I brought! I used Gala apples and sprinkled 1/2 teaspoon vanilla over apple mixture before adding top crust. Super easy and very good. I will definately made again.

This is a great, easy applie pie. I usually use an assortment of apples (Fujis, Granny Smith, Pink Ladies, etc.) which gives a nice variety of flavor.

i agree with schmerna... this pie IS simple and delicious!! it takes 10 minutes, 15 tops, to cut, mix and pour. and clean up was even quicker! 7 minutes when usually I leave things (bowls with sticky filling) in the sink for a day or two to soak so it'll be easier to clean but I guess those times have changed!!!!! This is a keeper!!!!!!!!!!!

Loved this recipe. It was easy and delicious, I will never buy a pie in the store again.  I did add a little more cinnamon, and just added all the butter to the apples right away.  I even made one for my mom!

I have made this pie for years but I do add a few tweeks.  I sprinkle 1 tablespoon lemon juice over sliced apples and sprinkle "raw" sugar on the top crust before baking. This is my husbands favorite so it is made often at our house.

I would love to try this, but I want to use home grown apples and they are very small. I am a good cook, but not a baker. Could someone translate 6 tart apples into cups or a measurement of some sort? Thanks. This is by far my favorite recipe site!

I didnt actually make a pie, I just used the ingredients and directions to make the apples and then used them to put into a cake. It was delicious, and my mother in law just walked out taking half the cake with her.

First pie I have ever made and I though it was delicious.  Had WAY too many apples however and there is a liquidy mixture on the bottom of the inside of the pie.  Not sure if it was too much margarine or what.  Next time I will add some suger and cinnamon to the top of the crust as well.  WILL MAKE AGAIN! :)

This is the first apple pie I have ever made, and following this recipe as well as tweaking it a bit made it come out delish! I used premade pie dough from the grocery store (which tastes almost as good as homemade), and makes making a pie easier and less time consuming. I sprayed my pan with Pam first, and then added about 1/4t nutmeg to my ingredients. I used Gala apples (which are my favorite), but had to use about 8-9 instead of 6, because they were small. I also used 1/4 cup white sugar, and 1/4 cup brown sugar. I also brushed the bottom shell with some butter. I then latticed my top dough, brushed with egg, and sprinkled cinnamon/sugar on top. It came out absolutely perfect at the 350*. I will definitely make again! Thanks for the great recipe!

Excellent recipe! I like things to be sweet so I added 1/2 cup of brown sugar and I also added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg. I liked the idea of other posters to brush the top with milk and sprinkle with sugar so I did that too. I'm sure it would have been great without these tweaks, but I altered it a bit to suit my personal tastes. I will never use another apple pie recipe again. This one is a keeper!

As other reviewers I added some nutmeg, and used only 3 apples (fuji, granny smith and golden delicious). It was my first time making a pie and it came out great.

I made this pie but tweaked it slightly for my taste by adding 1 Cup of Brown Sugar and 1/2 Teaspoon of Nutmeg. The recipe was simple and the results were awesome, Opt for Ala Mode as you will have plenty of juice to spoon over the ice cream. This one is a Keeper!

I made this pie today its a cold fall autumn day so I thought I'd try this pie I just took it out of the oven my house smells wonderful I can't wait to try it I added a little vanilla and nutmeg like other views suggested and after baking I brushed melted butter on top and added cinnamon sugar wow I can't wait to try it..  Thanks again hopefully it turned out good.  OMG this pie is the Bomb!!!  I waited as long as I could the pie sat up beautifully the crust was buttery and flaky with the cinnamon topping I had two pieces allready absolutely irrasistable pie I will definitely be making this one again real soon I used the Flaky pie crust in the Food processor and made sure my ingrediants were very cold the crust just melts in your mouth perfect ammount of cinnamon/sugar for the filling absolutely amazing I can't believe I made it :))  Tammy

Serendipitously, I forgot to add the butter to the apple mix. The apples I used were going bad and this recipe made them deeeelicious. Cut a pattern into the crust, baked it according to recipe, and topped it with sugar right out of the oven. Very yummy!

I made this yesterday.  The only changes I made were using 3 large apples and it was more than enough filling, and to cut the cinnamon in half (otherwise it's too strong for me).  It baked for 45 min and turned out wonderfully!  A++ flavor and just the perfect amount of soft apples and spices.  We loved it thanks!

The names says it BEST, this apple pie is as easy as Sunday morning, the best day of the week!! I have never baked apple pie though I love baking. A bag of apples were just sitting in the fridge on the verge of turning so I figured I best use them in a way my family would best enjoy.  They weren't tart so I was a little skeptical that it wouldn't be great but it was amazing!!

Please DON'T CHANGE ANYTHING!! keep the same ingredients and do not add anymore, this was so enjoyable to my Fiancee, me and our kids. Better that any store bought pie I could have bring home, thanks Donna!!

I made this yesterday and it turned out great!  I added some nutmeg after reading other reviews and used three different kinds of apples.  I served it with vanilla ice cream and my kids loved it:)  It was simple, but very good recipes.  It took me a while to prep since I was making four pies at once...!  It's a keeper:)

My husband LOVES this pie. I used 4 Jonagold apples, but I think it could have held 5 or 6 because they are small. I also added an extra 1/4 cup of sugar and reduced the cinnamon to 1/4 tsp (I cannot imagine 2 tsp of cinnamon. It would be overwhelming). This was the first pie I have ever made and it turned out very good. Easy to make.

Good flavor, but too much cinnamon for our taste.  I like that the filling was not too runny and the sweetness is right on.

Best apple pie ever!  Next time I will need to double up on my crust because I would prefer for it to be a little thicker.  But the pie was absolutely delicious! I made it for my husband and he really enjoyed it.

I found this pie recipe and had never made a pie before but if you live in New England, you know about apple season!  Sooo...I decided to try my hand at apple pie!  Lets just say that my family has been so in love with this pie that I am still making one nearly every other day!  I also put in a varation.  For the top of the pie, I do put the top crust on but I lattice it and make a mixture of cinnamon, sugar and butter and brush the mixture over the crust (after I have brushed the top with water of course, to keep from over criping!)  It's amazing!  Thank you so much for this recipe!

This recipe could not be more easy and the results are fantastic.  I will likely add a bit more spice next time but otherwise you can't go wrong with this apple pie.  Yum.

This is a good traditional recipe.  For a little extra, I coated the apples with 1 Tbs lemon juice before adding the dry ingredients, and also added 2 Tbs brown sugar and 1/2 tsp. nutmeg.  Next time I make this I want to add some cranberries.  Yum!

My husband and I LOVED this pie!  This was my first attempt at pie making... I am trying to branch out and start cooking more. I used a 9 inch refrigerated pie pastry and was able to make use of all the apples. The seasonings were just right, not too sweet and not too tart.  I added a little nutmeg just for the heck of it.  It really turned out great!  My husband ate it warm with vanilla ice cream, YUM!

This is a very good pie. I substituted 3/4 cup honey for the sugar, added more flour, and put in some vanilla extract and mapline.

I just made this pie, and it was awesome. I added 2 strips of bacon and some maple syrup for some reason, so I guess I kind of made my own version. I also added the bacon grease, took out a tablespoon of butter, used only 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, and added some salt. I kind of made it up as I went, but it was probably the craziest pie I've ever had. This was also the first pie I've ever made, so it was pretty satisfying too.

I give it five stars because it was so easy and tasted really great.  I put way too much cinnamon in it, and instead of slicing the apples I diced them with the skin still on, and it worked out to be perfect.  I also wound up baking it for just over an hour and it made it slightly crispy and wonderful.   This is my apple pie recipe as of now!

This was the first apple pie that I've ever made.  I liked it because it was simple yet yummy.  My husband even liked it and he is not a big fan of pies.  My only issue with this recipe was that I felt/tasted flour mixed in with the apples.  I don't know if I didn't mix it properly or bake it long enough.  Any suggestions as to what I did wrong?  Besides that I thought it was wonderful.

This recipe is truly fantastic.  I used Granny Smiths and agree that 1/2c sugar not enough.  I used 1c sugar, increased the cinnamon to 3 tsp, and added 3 tbs heavy cream after I put the apples in the pie crust.  I then sprinkled with a little nutmeg.

I didn't change a thing with this recipe and it turned out PERFECT!  I made homemade crust and added some sugar and vanilla to the dough for a bit more flavor.  I also followed the advice of another reviewer and brushed the top crust with water and sprinkled it with sugar.  If you cut the pie right after you take it out of the oven, it'll be too watery, but after about a half an hour the juice thickens up.  I'll definitely be making this again!

I thought the pie was okay, but by using tart apples 1/2 cup sugar was not nearly enough, I used 3/4 cup sugar still not enough. 2 tblsp. flour made pie too dry.
Thanks for sharing anyway.

I love to cook, but have never been a good baker.  This recipe was so simple that even I mastered it - even with a 6 & 7 year old helper.  Best of all, it turned out great!  I followed another's advice and added 1 tsp of vanilla and 1/4 tsp of nutmeg and sprinkled sugar on top of the pie crust.  It was a little soupy at first (probably still too hot), but once it cooled, it was just the right consistency.  Make sure you put a cookie tin under the pie tin in the oven or put some aluminum foil on the bottom of the oven in case there is any over flow!  This is our new apple pie recipe!!

I never made a homemade pie before, but I had apples that no one was eating. And of course I looked no further than this recipe, because as weird as it sounds, my name is actually Sunday. This was awesome. The pie was gone in 2 days.

This was the first apple pie I have ever made.  It was quite good.  I used Granny Smith apples.  I also used Pillsbury ready made pie crust.  There were only 1 downside to this pie.  I think maybe next time I make this I will add some sugar on the top crust to give the topping a bit more of a flavor.  Other than that...it's a keeper!!

This was a great pie! I made it with a crumbly top and it had such a great flavor. The apples are still crispy which I loved.

I used this recipe to make my very first apple pie ever. It turned out wonderful! I took advice from another review on here to use different types of apples as well as added a little nutmeg for spice. I drizzled a little caramel over the apples before top crust, that added a nice extra flavor and moisture. Everyone loved it! I will use this recipe again!

Very easy to make and loved it.  I live in Central America, so apple pie is not a normal thing to make, gave one to my neighbors and they really loved it.  We trade a lot of food back and forth, they give us local dishes and we give them American dishes.  Can't wait to make it again.

I basically went by the recipe.  However, I used more granny smith apples, less sugar, only 1 tsp. cinnamon, used cornstarch instead of flour and only used about 1 tbsp. butter.  After coating sliced apples with sugar mixture I let sit for 10 minutes or so while I made the pastry crust.  Scope out apples from bowl and press into pie shell, be sure not to get any of the liquid at the bottom of the bowl. **  I don't like an overpowering taste of cinnamon so I used less.  Only used a few butter slices on top of apples before placing top crust.  Brushed top of crust with a light coat of melted butter then sprinkled sugar, cinnamon & pumpkin pie spice mixture on it.  Baked at 400 for 10 minutes then reduced to 325 for another 45 - 50 minutes.  The last 10 minutes I placed a foil tent over pie.  It turned out beautiful and was so delicious, my kids loved it.  I will be keeping this recipe with the changes though.

This was a great recipe!  Simple and tasty.  I did tweak a bit myself.  I used Braeburn and Gala apples(7 total). I did use 3/4 cup sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg.  Instead of brushing water on top of the crust as in other reviews, I brushed milk on the top crust and sprinkled with sugar(something my great Aunt always did).  Also, I baked the pie for one hour as it was not nearly brown enough at a shorter baking time. All in all this is a wonderful, basic recipe that can be adjusted to your tastes if you wish.

Very good pie if you stick to the recipe!  Thought I would take the suggestion of extra cinnamon & nutmeg - DON'T DO IT!

I used Honey Crisp apples (I had 13 small ones) and 1 c. sugar because of the number of apples.  Used the same amount of cinnamon, flour, and butter.  I also bought the pie crust and put all the apples in a 10 inch pie plate.  They mounded up high but cooked down and looked great.  My husband loved it.  I'll do this one again.

This is a wonderful simple recipe and using another reviewer's suggestion, I used a combination of apples, granny smiths, golden delicious and braeburns. Also used Barefood Contess'a perfect pie crust and the end result was a perfect apple pie.

I made this pie today and it was my first time ever making a pie. It came out great! I used 6 med/large Empire apples and substituted cornstarch for flour (since I didn't have any flour). I also did a couple of other things a bit differently. I remember my grandmother showing me how to make apple pie when I was a kid so I used a couple of her techniques. One was that instead of adding the butter pieces to the mixture in the bowl, I mixed everything else, put a layer of the mixture in the crust, added some butter pieces, put another layer, added butter, etc. for 3 layers. I also brushed the top crust with milk before baking. It was delicious! I will definitely make this again.

This pie was easy to make and tasted great.  I have made it a few times now, and it's the only apple pie recipe that I will use.  Some of the recipes involve a lot more, and don't taste nearly as good.  I even made a mistake last time I made it, I added 2 tablespoons of cinnamon instead of teaspoons, but I just told everyone that it was an Apple-Cinnamon pie... no one noticed the mistake!

I give it 5 stars because of the ease of making it and how tasty it is.  The hardest part is peeling the apples and that you can do in front of the TV if you want!  I cooked it for 20 college students and they decided to learn how so they can make it over and over again. You can really wow your friends and family with this even if you don't usually bake!

My guy made this for me this past Sunday (oddly enough) and it was fantastic.  Better than the one I had made, that's for certain....used Granny Smith apples and added some nutmeg and allspice but other than that, no changes.  Perfect and simplistic. Thanks!

This was the first pie I've ever made, and it came out amazingly.  Absolutely delicious and was a hit at Thanksgiving!  I used 8 apples instead of 6, half macs and half cortland.

I made this pie for Thanksgiving this year and it was very good.
I added a bit more cinnamon and sugar. There were no leftovers.

I'm a homeschool mom, and decided my kids could use a fun filled home-ec class(oldest is 7 and twins are 5)! My kitchen looks like a tornado hit it, but the pie was worth it! We added a touch of pure vanilla, nutmeg and 2 tablespoons of brown sugar. Great recipe-Thanks for sharing!

This turned out great!  I made it for a Thanksgiving dinner with my friends - and everyone loved it!  It was very easy.  This was my first time making a pie - so if I can pull it off, anyone can!

I skipped dobbing butter on the apples after putting them in the pie - and they turned out much crispier -rather than mushy.  I also used an assortment of apples...

DELICIOUS!  TRY IT!

I had never made an apple pie before and was worried about it turning out runny, but this one was perfect!  I baked it for 15 minutes at 425 to set the crust and then for 50 minutes at 350.  Got rave reviews at Thanksgiving and only one piece was left!  Used Granny Smith apples and brushed the top crust with milk and sprinkled with sugar.  Very tasty, beautiful pie!  Thank you!

I make this every year for Thanksgiving. this year I made two. because last year my husband didnt get a piece and I heard about it all year! That being said, I gave 4 stars because I have tweaked it from the original recipe. I use 1/2 brown, 1/2 white sugar. I add nutmeg and vanilla about a tsp each. and I always use premade dough. This is a fantastic basic recipe that is easy to change up and play with. It's my go to apple pie recipe.

A little bit sweet for my taste, so will knock the sugar back a bit next time.  Maybe it was the apples, because I used pink lady and honey crisp.  Will put some Granny Smith in next time and that should tone down the sweet.

Everyone loved this pie!  I put some nuefchatel cheese (low fat cream cheese) pieces with the butter in the apples.  Used an egg wash, using whole egg, on the top crust and edges.  My, oh, my...what a pie!

So I’ve never really liked apple pie but due to a school project on Tuesday before Thanksgiving, I had a ton of apples   This looked easy, so I made apple instead of anything else. I split white sugar with brown.  It was easy and delicious Thank you!

I made this, as written. It was a perfectly delish pie, but it wasn't mind blowing. I will use this recipe again, but will likely tweak it somehow to pizzazz it up a bit. More spices, maybe sweeter.. Not sure. It was just a bit of a plain jane run of the mill apple pie. Nothing wrong with that!

I love this recipe!  I use 3 different kinds of apples depending on what sounds good.  Usually Granny Smith, Honey Crisp (if I can find them), and another red - something a little tarter that holds up while baking.  I also use half white and half brown sugar.

This was amazing! I used gala apples and baked about 60 minutes. It was my first time making an apple pie completely from scratch, and this was the best apple pie I've ever eaten.  It got rave reviews from the family, too! This recipe is definitely a keeper, and you'll never need another.

Wow, what an amazing pie. To make the crust, we only used 3 ingredients -  2 cups of flour, 1/2 cup of oil, and 5 tablespoons of water. We used a glass pie dish and as such lowered the temperature to 325 and lengthened the time to about 1 hour. The pie came out with just the right amount of moisture - not dry and not soggy. The taste and texture were perfect.  The pie slices were easy to take out of the dish and did not fall apart. We will continue to use this recipe.

Pretty good. Thought the 2 tsp. of cinnamon was a bit too much; will cut back next time. Also will use more apples.

We loved this pie, yet we added 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1 tsp  nutmeg. It made most sense to brush the top crust with egg, like we do with our peach pies. We will  definetly make this pie again, with our additions.

This worked fine for me because I wanted a recipe that I felt I could skip peeling the apples (arthritis in the hands). I used Gala apples. Instead of all white sugar, I used half brown sugar. I added a faint sprinkle of ground cloves. I baked it for 30 minutes at 375 and an additional 30 minutes at 400 in a 9 inch pyrex pie plate. I covered the edges with foil and took it off the last 5 minutes of baking. When the pie was done, I spread some glaze I had left over from cinnamon buns while the pie was still hot.  I used the store brand of refrigerated pie crust. My son said the only change to the recipe should be to put vanilla ice cream on top.

I don't know what went wrong tonight, but it took 2 hours to bake this pie. I've always had great success with apple pies, but this is the first time I've ever tried this particular recipe. I used a mix of baking apples fresh from a local orchard, which I do every fall. But the apples were so dry looking after 45 minutes in the oven. There was absolutely no moisture for well over an hour and then it took another hour to get enough juice to bubble. I eventually covered the crust with aluminum foil to try to prevent it from getting much darker. We'll have to see tomorrow how it tastes. I realized later that this recipe never called for setting the apple mixture aside for a few minutes. Maybe that's what I should have done. I do say, though, the house smells phenomenal!  Wish me luck tomorrow when I take it to my gathering for dessert.  I won't have to worry about a soggy crust, anyway.

Necessary alterations:  Mix 2 tsp lemon juice with sliced apples. Also, increase sugar to 1 cup with addition of 1/2 cup brown sugar to original 1/2 cup of sugar, and decrease cinnamon to 1 1/2 tsp while adding 1/8 tsp nutmeg. Add 1 tsp vanilla and sprinkle corn starch into apple, flour and spice mixture. Voila!

It was simple to put together but for some reason came out dry, not sure what went wrong cause i followed recipe exactly. It did taste good just really not juicy enough for my family.

Following the advice of others who have rated this recipe, I too added 1/4 cup of brown sugar and 1 tsp nutmeg. However, I find that the filling comes out best if you substitute the flour for corn starch and melt the butter in a skillet then heat the rest of the filling mixture until it starts to thicken. It was a fantastic pie with these changes but without the changes the filling has a tendency to come out too watery.

The first apple pie I ever made was this recipe. My wife loved it. I just bump up the cinnamon and sprinkle cinn/sugar on top of crust before baking. I keep crust covered until the last 15 min.

I think this pie was excellent as written, however I like to add more spice than called for in recipes. I added ginger and nutmeg to mine and loved the result! Definitely a keeper recipe.

OMG, this simple pie tasted soooooo good!  Due to my bf's oven we had to cook almost twice as long before the crust looked done, but boy oh boy, the apples and crust were perfect.  It wasn't the prettiest pie due to my 9.5 inch pan, but it really was tasty.

Overall this is a good apple pie. I used the mix of apples as others suggested. I put the bottom pie shell in the oven for 10 min. before pouring the apples in to make sure it didn't come out soggy in the end. I also mixed a little squeeze of lime juice to add a bit more tart in the apples. I think I will try another recipe, in the end it just tasted like a fresh McDonalds apple pie.

I'm not big on apple pie but my husband is.  He said it was the best apple pie he ever had which made me a happy baker.  The only changes I did was I used self rising flour, splenda, egg whites instead of whole eggs and I also added a touch of nutmeg.  In addition, I brushed egg white on the crust. Thanks for a great recipe!

Delicious!  I used a mixture of Granny Smiths and Braeburns, and there was a LOT of apple filling!  My husband said he prefers a "flatter" apple pie - this one was super tall because of all the apples.  I made a homemade crust and added 1/8 tsp each of nutmeg and cloves as well as the cinnamon.  I like one reviewer's idea of adding a splash of vanilla, because this pie seemed to lack moisture somehow.  I'll keep tinkering, but I love this basic recipe!

This pie is packed full of apples and make a wonderful treat :)  I used Granny Smith apples and added a touch of nutmeg. For the crust I used a Jiffy brand.  Awesome recipe, I will be making this again and again!!
