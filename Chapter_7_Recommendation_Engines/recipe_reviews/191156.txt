Familiar with Chinese cooking, I recognized this as a classic blend of seasonings and ingredients as well as an accurate cooking method. Therefore, I prepared this exactly as written - and it was perfect, just as I had anticipated it would be.  My only criticism, and the only thing I did differently, was that the recipe calls for round steak, which I don't think is suited for this style of cooking.  I used a New York strip steak, but tenderloin or sirloin would have worked well too.  The ingredients in the marinade are so traditional and so key to the dish  that I don't really see how you could make any changes and get a fair result.  This was just delicious and made hubs and I members of "the clean plate club."  Just a tip - if you partially freeze the steak for a half hour or so until semi-firm you will find this so much easier to cut into the thin slice so necessary for this style of cooking.

This is delicious, I made one change because I have a friend who worked in a Chinese restaurant for years and she told me the secret to always tender beef even using tough cuts of meat is to cut the beef into strips then place in a plastic bag overnight with 1/2 t baking soda.  Before preparing the recipe, rinse the beef off twice and dry on paper towels.  Other than that difference,  I followed the recipe to a T.  Next time might add a few dried chilies, because I like the heat, but the sauce is wonderful!

OK... if you don't like people who don't follow the recipe, yet review it anyway - then don't read any further!   I followed the cooking instructions, but I didn't have some of the ingredients, so I substituted, using what I had on hand.   I didn't have oyster sauce or sherry, so I used hoisin and extra amounts of soy sauce, and I substituted brown sugar for the white - just because.   Instead of fresh, I used powdered ginger, onion, and garlic, which I added to the marinade.   I marinated the meat for 2 hours, which was good - but overnight would be better.   I used the Normandy frozen veggie blend (broccoli, cauliflower, carrots) from Sam's and added a large sweet onion.   I don't measure anything - just guesstimate, dump, and taste-test until it suits me.  It turned out very tasty!   I'll make this version as written when I have all the ingredients - but, I'll be doing my own version again too!    If this one is half as good as mine, I'll be happy happy!

Wow.  This was good.  I wasn't able to make it exactly as written - didn't have oyster sauce or sherry.  Used powder ginger instead of ginger root.  And still, it all pulled together and had a really good flavor.  Thanks !

This was very good, but a little sweet and the sauce was a bit runny, more like a broth. I followed the recipe as written, but cut the sesame oil to one tsp as I'm not a big fan of the strong flavor/odor. I marinated the meat for about 6 hours. I will make this recipe again, but will omit the sugar and increase the corn starch (possibly mix a little with soy sauce and whisk it in before adding the broccoli back.) Thanks for a tasty recipe!

I LOVE this sauce. I actually have never made this recipe with beef, but I have made it several times with tofu, broccoli, carrots, onion, and red bell pepper. It comes out great every time!! Thank you!  If you want to make this with Tofu, make sure you marinate the tofu with half of the sauce for 2-3 hours.

The beef is kinda tough if you just throw it in pan . If you parboil in diluted sauce for about 20 mins the meat is very tender as in restaurant style.

VERY good!! Doesn't have the "exact" restaurant taste, but definitly a new addition to my recipe collection! I kept the ingredients the same other than I used chicken breast and doubled the sauce. I didn't think these changes changed the recipe so I could still give it an accurate rating. The second time I made this I added fresh mushrooms, water chestnuts and corn (the stuff commonly used in asian recipe's). Thanks Dianne!!!!

A very traditional recipe. Great base for many variations. 

If you like Asian cooking then go to your local Asian market and save money on things like the oyster sauce. In my area a 32 oz bottle is under 4 dollars. If you live in warmer climates you can grow your own ginger from roots from the store. It's nice to always have fresh. It takes almost a year but after that you will never run out.

For a more tender beef, you can marinade the beef in the sherry over night and then add in the rest of the marinade for the final 15 minutes.

I recommend removing the oyster sauce and sesame oil to be put in near the end of cooking, rather than during marinating. Also, to add the cornstarch right at the end of marinating to let the flavor get in deeper first. You don't have to refrigerate to marinate, room temperature is just fine. 

One major thing is that broccoli will probably not be able to be cooked thoroughly by stir-frying. many restaurants par-boil or just add water to the wok while cooking the broccoli (which gives some steam action). 

Also, I use flank steak as my choice, not expensive, but not tough. Make sure you slice AGAINST the grain, all the difference in the world. and slice as thin as you can, there is no such thing as too thin. 

But a decent recipe which is similar to some chinese fast food.

This is a good recipe and pretty standard for Chinese home cooking and is always welcome as a comfort food; the ingredients are always handy. I use Chinese cooking wine instead of dry sherry and select Inside or Bottom Round for the beef (same thing but depending on where you live). I also use Fish Sauce rather than Oyster Sauce; it can be used in Thai and even in Mongolian recipes.

This was really delicious! I modified the recipe a little based on some reviews- added one extra clove of garlic, ginger powder, some red pepper flakes, and some salt and pepper. I also combined everything together instead of adding the ginger and garlic to the oil. I used about 2 teaspoons of potato starch as I'm allergic to corn. I also added 2/3 cup beef broth to extend the sauce. Will definitely make again!

I could tell at a glance that this recipe would be one of my favorites so I tripled the recipe.  And I am so glad that I did.  I made the marinade/sauce exactly except I shredded the fresh ginger and didn't discard it.   I used chicken because I didn't have the beef.  And the rest of my freshly picked garden vegetables were screaming to be included in this recipe so with my fresh-picked broccoli, I added fresh yellow beans, small white onions, carrots, celery, yellow squash and a little chopped up fresh cilantro.  I served the dish with Wild and Whole Grain Brown Rice because I love the earthy flavor of these rices. This is definitely a keeper and the next time I purchase beef, I will make this with beef as suggested here.  Thanks so much.  I uploaded a photo of the dish with the chicken and all the garden veggies.

Because of all the rave reviews I thought this was really going to be something special, but I was disappointed.  I used sirloin instead of round and added mushrooms and onions, but I don't think that was the problem. This was relatively mild in flavor and not in the style of any Chinese restaurant I've ever eaten at.  It really needed something to bump up the flavor.  We ate it, but I won't be making it again.  At least not as written.  Thanks for letting me try.

This was DElicious!  Yum!  Just as good as a restaurant's, if not better.  The only changes I made were: marinated the meat overnight, made double the sauce, and added peapods, onion, mushrooms and water chestnuts.

This is by far best my duplication of a Chinese restaurant dish made at home!   It was exceptional and many many many thanks to the member who gave the tip on how the Chinese restaurants tenderize beef using baking soda.   I let it sit in the fridge with baking soda for about 8 hours and the meat melted in your mouth.   I feel like that little trick alone needs to be published in "The Book of Awesome".   Super easy, yet perfectly seasoned.   I'm super happy with this find!!!

I made this dish for my sisters Chinese menu birthday get together.  Some wanted beef, some wanted chicken so I combined the two.  Turned out yummy.  Personally I liked the bites with chicken.  Overall this is a great recipe which I made as written with requests for the recipe.

I did not like this recipe at all.  After I followed all of the direction... I had to double check that I didn't do something wrong because it tasted bad.  This is the first recipe from this site that I am really not a fan of.  Very dissapointed... it doesn't taste like any beef and broccolli dish I've ever had at a restaurant!

I really liked it. I felt it was a little too much oil, and I had to eventually add a little more cornstarch, but it came out fine.

This was a little sweet for my taste. I'm going to omit the sugar next time. If using a lesser cut meat, make sure to marinate for longer, or pound the slices with a tenderizing mallet.

Delicious and easy to tweak.  Cooking times plus descriptions made this an easy to follow recipe. I added  4 scallions w/ greens, water chestnuts, and carrots.  Seasoned steaks with black and red pepper flakes and pounded with a meat tenderizer before marinating.   Didn't have sesame oil or sherry, so used 1 tbsp. white vinegar and a splash of white wine.

My daughters liked this very much, and even though I don't usually like making stir fry, this wasn't too bad to make. Thanks!

As others have stated, this was extremely salty and more like 3 servings than 4. The serving issue can be fixed, I'm not sure the saltiness can.

I was CRAVING chinese like a prego lady (even though I'm NOT) but couldn't afford to go out, so this hit the spot!!!!! I made fried rice and potstickers to round out the meal. I especially love that it takes authentic ingredients; kinda expensive to buy for the first time but then all you need is the broccoli and steak after that! AND it's picky eater approved!!! My daughter gobbles this up!!!!

I admit I have only had beef and broccoli a few times in restaurants - I usually prefer other dishes. I mostly made this for my wife. I followed the recipe exactly, and was grateful that there were not any ingredients that were hard to find. The result was very good. Let me add a few comments: cooking on a hot stove, you might not need to cook for as long as the recipe says, especially when cooking the broccoli. Second, this dish does not have a sauce when you finish: it is glazed meat with slightly glazed broccoli. It will not be dripping in sauce. The only thing I would change is the sugar - I would cut that in half.

This is very good. Super easy to make, too. My husband thought it was a tad bit salty, so next time I am going to use reduced sodium soy sauce, although we suspect the oyster sauce is also a  culprit.

Just ate this for lunch ... OMG! This is the best Chinese Dish I've ever tried on this site. It surely is an instant hit in my family. Even my daughter who is the pickiest eater in the world loved it. Thanks Diane for this wonderful meal!

I followed the other reviewer's recommendation of stirring 1/2 teaspoon baking soda on the beef strips overnight. Marinated the beef mixture for one hour. Then followed the entire recipe to the dot. Except for the meat, I used rib eye steak, since that's what I have and used white wine instead of sherry. The meat was so tender and the whole dish is so delish. Yum! Yum!

This sauce was delicious.  I used chicken instead of beef and it was excellent.  Next time, I'll try beef.

With the title of this recipe, I was expecting flavors closer to what I would sample at a local Chinese restaurant but was sadly disappointed. I even used a higher quality cut of beef. I felt the recipe called for too much sesame oil and not enough soy. Also, instead of frying my broccoli, I steamed it.

There are just some things that distinguish a good Chinese recipe from a great one.  One of those is sesame oil.  It’s a must and it alone can make all the difference in the world.  Another one is oyster sauce.  It gives a dish its deep rich flavor.  I knew right away that this would be a great recipe.  However, not being a sherry lover, I substituted it with beef broth.  It yielded a nice rich sauce that wasn’t real sweet as other reviewers have noted.

~Even better than going to my favorite Asian restaurant! We like spicy Asian food, so I added some crushed red pepper flakes with the broccoli.  I tossed in some sesame seeds with the marinade as well. This recipe is a definite keeper!!!~

Very good.  The only modification I made was to add a couple of chili peppers into the oil with the ginger and garlic at the beginning of the recipe.  That gave it just a little heat.  We like thing a little spicy in our family.  However, it would have been just as good without it and will definitely be added to my collection.

It was really good! I'd suggest not using as much soy sauce, as it turned out really salty. We had to add extra cornstarch, this was a little runny. Thanks so much for a great recipe!

Very good sauce - went a little lite on the sugar and did not have the ginger- I can never get my beef tender, however, and I used a sirlin instead of the very lean round cut - thought it would be more tender but still a bit chewy. Maybe marinating longer would be better...

This is about as good as it gets for a home made Asian dish.  It is difficult to reproduce the effect achieved with a commercial stove.  But the sauce is good, I however, selected a better cut of meat than suggested.  Other than that, it is good to go.

Amazing. Period. I found buying beef round and slicing against the grain into about 2x1in. rectangles was much better than buying pre-sliced beef. pre-slicing the beef, before sale, takes all the juice out of it, and the end product turns out too dry/chewy. With the round, it came out perfectly juicy.

Great recipe and very easy to make.  Plus, this is a good one to prep ahead of time so it's quick to make for dinner.  I've followed it exactly, and it's come out perfect both times.  To ensure the beef is tender, I cut it against the grain.

Awesome recipe! Sauce ingredients are perfect and the amounts are a great balance. I may have used a little extra soy sauce by mistake- but I have the low sodium kind so no big flavor difference. I love Chinese style food and this recipe is so fast, and tastes like restaurant food. I didn't have sherry wine so I used some other red wine hanging around the kitchen and there were none the wiser.

great recipe.. really restaurant style.   very easy. followed recipe except for: 1) exchanged sherry for a sweet wine.  2) cooked beef for 20 minutes instead of 5mins for desired tenderness - adding small amounts of water just to prevent it from drying or burning up.

I followed the ingredients/directions exactly and this dish came out a bit too sweet for my family. Next time I'll leave out the sugar.  Not sure this is good enough to call 'restaurant style' though. It was okay.

This was pretty good, not quite what I personally used to in broccoli and beef but tasty enough.  I added onion & shredded carrot to the whole mix because that is what I like in it.  Everything else was the same.  Will make this again! Thanks!

I tripled all the sauce ingredients except the sesame oil, oyster sauce and sherry. We like a saucier chinese entree and just by eyeballing the ingredients, I knew it would make enough sauce for us. Because I don't normally have sherry, I used 1/3 c. hoisin sauce. I know that's a stretch but I bought everything for a seperate Beef and Broccoli recipe and at the last minute, switched to this one. I panicked because I didn't have sherry or beef broth on hand, looked through the fridge door and saw that I had 1/4 full jar of hoisin sauce. That was a good accidental addition. Good try for my first attempt at Beef and Broccoli.

I am a culinary specialist in the United States Navy. I have been making this recipe now for about two months and my shipmates love it! What i learned from it primarily was how to properly cook the broccoli so it doesn't turn brown and mushy... Flavors work great together, consistence of the glaze is perfect... Just all around wobderful! Thank you very much for sharing... HOOOOOYAH!

Made this for a big group of people. I just doubled the meat and every thing for the sauce and it was perfect. The longer you marinade the better it comes out. Added red bell pepper cut thin and sautéed with the broccoli and minced the ginger and garlic and left it in. Also added onions. This dish was so tasty. I will be making it often when I feel like having Chinese but don't want to get take out.

Very flavorful.  I added some mushrooms, carrots and bell pepper for color and variety.  Followed exactly as recipe called for.  Next time I will try it with chicken.

Just got through eating this - LOVED it! I will be making again and again. I made exactly as stated except used strip steak as another reviewer suggested. So easy and so tasty. The sauce was awesome  - better than most chinese places I've eaten beef and broccoli at.

This was not very good.  The sherry and the sesame oil really over power this recipe.  Would not make this again.

Flank steak works pretty well, as long as you cut against grain and makes thin strips. Oil and cornstarch will help to tenderize the meat. High heat and quick stir-fry are the key. Recommend to use Chinese broccoli and keep garlic and ginger in your dish for a true Chinese style beef with broccoli.

This might pass for decent beef with broccoli...if the only Chinese food you've had came from Central Texas.  It's just not good.  It's too sweet, and has an odd flavor to it.  The sauce didn't thicken up or really coat the meat as it should,  and the beef it called for wasn't the least bit tender (of course this problem can be resolved with a different cut and better preparation).  At any rate, the flavor left a lot to be desired.  No one finished their serving and I wouldn't even bother trying to tweak it.

This is DELICIOUS and simple to make!   I never thought I could make Chinese food until this.  My 4 kids (7, 9, 11, 13) all love it.  Thank you for a great recipe.    I sliced the beef very thin (slightly frozen) and then added 1 tsp baking soda per lb of beef, put it in a zipper bag in the fridge overnight and rinsed well before marinating with the sauce.

Way to much oyster sauce.  Couldn't hardly stand the smell of it white it was cooking.  Will continue to look for another beef & broccoli recipe this one was not the one.

I made this last night for dinner and we all loved it! I have been searching for a while for a beef and broccoli recipe close to what my favorite restaurant makes and this is it!

I did have to change up one thing since we don't ever have sherry in the house, I used water with a bit of beef bouillon instead. I also used skirt steak only because that's what I had in the freezer. 

Thanks!!

Outstanding! The only thing I'd change is that I'd cut the beef into bit sized pieces and double the cornstarch because mine was runny.  I might put some crushed red pepper in it next time to add some heat.  Great recipe.

Delicious! I used chicken instead of beef and didn't have sherry, so I used fruit juice instead. If you want to use frozen broccoli like I did, thaw it first and use a little extra cornstarch so the sauce won't be too runny after you add the broccoli. Don't add the thawed broccoli to the pan until the very end or it might overcook and turn to mush.

The sherry taste was a little strong for me.  Maybe I will reduce it or omit it next time.  Otherwise, it was good.

Very good!  I added more vegetables, so needed to double the sauce, but very good!  Getting good tasting oyster and soy sauce will make a big difference in how this dish turns out for you.  Also the quality of the meat. I left out the sugar and found the sauce to then have the perfect flavor for my tastes.

Pretty good, although my husband and I didn't like the strong flavor or smell of the oyster sauce.  Maybe it's because we do not like fish.  Next time I'll use only half of the oyster sauce that the recipe calls for and see how that does.

This is my first time making beef and broccoli and it turned out pretty good. I followed the recipe exactly except I doubled the sauce and used ground ginger. The next time I make this I will use a more tender beef since the round steak is not tender enough for my liking. I also will marinate the meat overnght and slow cook it for extra tenderness. As is... this dish is pretty yummy:-)

This recipe puts my local joint outta business - I was a little hesitant as I've never used oyster sauce before, but this was simply wonderful.  We usually discuss a new recipe while we're eating ... but not this time - we were too busy chowing down to talk.  I did double sauce recipe, halved sesame oil (as it's so strong and I don't care that much for it), and added some chunked white onion pieces.  Served over steamed rice with a side of spicy sesame noodles.  Will make again (and again and again).  TY so much for recipe.  Oh - almost forgot - I had company and forgot to let the meat marinade - was rushing around at last minute and managed to only get about 15 to 20 minutes of soaking time in while rice cooked - still tasted fantastic.

This was great - I actually had leftover steak from the night before, so I sliced it and put it in the sauce for about 20 minutes - even though it was already cooked, it still took on the flavor.  No leftovers!  My family loved it!

I don't normally care for broccoli beef, but I did love this version! After tasting the marinade as is, I felt it needed a bit more zing. So, I made two minor changes....I tripled the ginger and garlic (and minced both). There was no need to remove it from pan and leaving the minced ginger in gave it way more flavor.  I also substituted canola oil for the vegetable oil to cut down on fat. With these minor additions, it was a five star recipe in my book, but gave it a 4 star as written. TIP:  I did two batches, by the second batch I was in a major hurry. So, I steamed the broccoli in the microwave for 2 min first, then tossed it into the wok. It cut down on the cooking time and still worked well.

I made this dish for an Asian themed birthday party. It got rave reviews!!! I didn't have sherry but so I used apple cider(which I googled and found to be an appropriate substitute). I loved it and with the leftovers I tossed with some fettuccine noodles and alfredo sauce.

I didn't think this tasted like restaurant beef and broccoli, but it was good, and I will make it again.  The sauce seemed salty to my tasted, so I omitted the soy sauce.  The sauce turned out OK with that change.  I also made about half again as much sauce.  Next time I will add sliced onion.

I wanted so much to love this. That much oyster sauce put it into salt overload. In the past, other receipes have called for maybe a tablespoon or two of oyster or fish sauce. I should've known better. Loved the concept. It would've been terrific if I could've figured out a way to get that salt block out of there. Feel free to share remedies for that situation. Will try recipe again after tweaking amounts. Thanks!

I rarely review any of the many of the recipes I have tried from here but I think this is AWESOME! A must save for low-carbers (I used Splenda instead of sugar). Very, very good and easy once you have some of the not so common ingredients on hand like oyster sauce and raw ginger. But will definitely be making more regularly. Thanks! 
OH...I added sesame seeds to mine at the end too.

Easy and pretty tasty beef and broccoli recipe. I wish I could get my beef as tender as the Chinese take-out places. We had this on Chinese New Year, just for fun!

I was surprised at how good this was!  Followed the ingredient list but added sliced mushrooms with the broccoli.   I added a bit of water along with the broccoli and steamed it with the lid closed for a couple of minutes before continuing on with the recipe.  Easy, fast and tasty.

Simple to prepare. The flavors blend well (I was worried my 12 year old wouldn't like the oyster sauce). We both agreed it was good and we'll eat it again. We served ours with simple sticky rice (Botan) and next time will probably try adding in some water chestnuts or other items. Another nice thing was that it was pretty fast to prep, marinate and cook!

This was good and quite easy to make, however, I know my taste buds and added garlic, didn't have fresh ginger and used 1T of ground ginger.  The 2nd time I made it, I didn't have enough broccoli  so added water chestnuts, baby carrots and chopped onion, it became beef & vegetables and everyone cleaned their plates!  I served with brown rice cooked in beef broth.

Very tasty!  I was thankful for the suggestion another reviewer made about using a different cut of meat.  I used sirloin steak and was very pleased with the results.  I also added water chestnuts, which were a great addition.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

My partner & I had this last night for the first time.  We had broccoli a couple of nights ago so I substituted broccoli with chinese pea pods, fresh mushrooms and water chestnuts.  He LOVED it so much he ate almost the entire recipe minus the small plate I had.  He doesn't eat that much normally ever!  But he loved this!  Can't wait to try it with another meat and other veggies.

This was delicious. All my kids liked it, and even my picky child who doesn't like stir fries liked it. I made as written except I used water instead of sherry, and I added a spoonful of hoisin sauce. I also used ground beef instead of steak and didn't marinate it, I just added the sauce while I was browning the beef. I found that this made enough for me and 6 young kids. We served it over rice.

Terrific tasting and easy to prepare. A couple of cautions though: First, 3/4 lb of meat is about half the amount my four would eat. Second I would caution the use of medium high heat for a total of 8 minutes with 3/4 lbs beef. Following those directions the yummy sauce evaporated. Of course it depends on your equipment.

Tasted better than take out.  I used chuck steak and sliced thin (froze it for 1/2 hour before cutting) and ginger powder instead of ginger root and I left the garlic and ginger in the oil, I used extra soy sauce instead of sherry.  I also added sliced carrots, which went over great, not everyone likes broccoli.

Love the recipe.  I used leftover roast beef cut into strips, and I used a dry white wine instead of sherry (because I didn't have sherry). I had also decided to serve this over rice, so I doubled the sauce/marinade. Cutting up the broccoli in advance was also helpful since I did this on a very busy day. That way, when I got home all I did was saute the brocolli in olive oil and then add about a half a cup of water and let it sit for a few minutes, then I addedd the beef to heat it up.  Husband not into stir fry's. but loved this one!  Great!

I absolutely loved this recipe! I will make this again and again but with a few tweaks. I prefer to use fresh grated ginger instead of a slice which has to be discarded. I will also add maybe a tablespoon of brown sugar for a bit of sweetness. Other than that, this recipe is perfect!

This was perfect!  I was able to make this EXACTLY as presented here and everyone LOVED IT.  I made this twice in 2 nights.  THe first night I had to substitute for jarred minced garlic, powdered ginger & Japanese manjo aji mirrin sweet rice seasoning for the sherry.  It was still awesome.

This was fabulous.  It tasted just like it was made in a Chinese Restaurant.  I added fresh sliced mushrooms and doubled the sauce. My hubby said I should definately make it again.

I was very happy with how this recipe came out!  I did add carrots, mushrooms, and onions (I am a veggie freak!)  Everything tasted great and I cannot wait to make it again!

Sorry. Once I made the sauce, I couldn't stomach the smell to continue. It stunk up my kitchen even after I poured it down the drain.

This was really good.  I made as written. The broccoli takes longer than indicated.  Also, I added water chestnuts halfway through the broccoli cooking time for the crunch.

Turned out great! I followed the recipe completely, except added a quarter sliced onion halfway through the broccoli stage. My only mod was that I used the full recipe with only half the beef and vegetables. I like the extra sauce with the rice. Definitely in the rotation now!

Pretty good recipe.  I added some sliced green onions because I had some on hand that needed to be used.  Also sprinkled some sesame seeds on top after plating.  Other than that, I followed the recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

This was okay, but not a family favorite. They said was a little too salty. It was a nice change of pace. Maybe try again with a little less soy sauce.

Major raves from 12 year old and hubby - no left overs, they LOVED it.  Be warned, oyster sauce is VERY salty, so low sodium soy would be fine.  This is every bit as good - if not better - than take out!

OMG!!! Delish. Substitute hoisin sauce and a few tsp of dumpling sauce because of seafood allergies. By all means do not discard the ginger and garlic, burst of flavor in your mouth. Sesame seed oil is essential.  Added 2 TBPS of water at the end. Easy recipe to make. Now preferred recipe for B & B. Thank you Dianne...;-)

Sometimes we find this type of meal too salty but, using low sodium soy sauce, this was excellent!  I must come to terms with the fact that I just do not like round steak, however, and will use chicken next time around.  Quick and simple, this is a great busy weeknight meal.

It’s very easy to make.  But I guess my tastebuds are different than everyone else’s.  I didn’t like this at all.  It didn’t taste like any beef and broccoli I’ve every had from a Chinese restaurant.

I love this recipe. I make Chinese food frequently and this is the go-to recipe for broccoli beef. I follow the recipe but add tofu because I love it. I also add a little (1/4 C) chicken soup stock while cooking broccoli to add flavor.

My husband and I both loved this.  He said it was even better the next day for lunch.  I didn't have sherry and subbed Chinese cooking wine but otherwise made as written. (oh, I did add some mushrooms!)  I was careful to cut the meat across the grain and this seemed to make it quite tender.

No changes other than taking the advice of another viewer to velvet the beef by sprinkling with baking soda to tenderize.   I let the beef set for about 6 hours instead of overnight and it was perfect.     My husband was incredulous.    Score!

Fantastic! I did make a few changes. I used broccolini instead of broccoli. I added sliced mushrooms. I used about 1 inch of fresh ginger sliced thin and minced and increased the garlic to 2-3 cloves. I did not remove the garlic and ginger as I love the flavors. Once the garlic and ginger were sauted and softened I added the mushrooms, stirred and cooked for about five or six minutes. I added a small amount of water to deglaze the pan and placed the broccolini on top and covered. Cooked until the stems were just tender. Removed to another dish then proceeded with the receipe.

The recipe makes a delicious version of beef broccoli.  It has wonderful flavor nuances due to the sherry that take it a level above traditional Chinese restaurant fare.  I will be making it again.

I used chicken instead of beef, fish sauce instead of oyster sauce, used shallot- and ginger-infused oils. Left raw chicken to marinate 24 hours. Sauce didn't thicken and was too salty. DH said it was better than any buffet he'd ever had, but he's a fantastic complimenter.

This is a delicious, in depth beef & broccoli. The ginger is key so don't leave it  out (I used extra, but I love ginger). I did go a little light on the oyster sauce to keep it from being too sweet. I didn't have sherry so I used a dash of ACV, yummy little tang, and added some sweet white onion and red crushed pepper. I'm all about a one pot meal so I cooked the beef half way then added the broccoli in the last few minutes.  Beef was not overcooked and the broccoli was still a little crunchy. Will definitely go in the dinner rotation.

You can prep sauce and beef the night before to make it quicker the next morning. I took out the sugar and added honey. 
We have 4 kids ranging from 10-2 years old and they all loved it!.

It was good, but when you scale the recipe up to make 6 servings, the amount of vegetable oil called for ends up being 1/4 cup + 1 tsp, which is way too much. But I guess that's more of a problem with the algorithm on the website than the recipe itself. I would still stick with perhaps 1-1.5 tbsp of cooking oil for six servings.

I made the following tweaks: Japanese mirin (made from mochi rice, so it's quite sweet) instead of sherry, no sugar, refined coconut oil for the cooking oil, 3x the amount of garlic and ginger, and since I didn't have enough broccoli, I added two orange bell peppers to make six servings.

I had a lot of marinade leftover, since it made the meat and veggies quite flavorful and salty already. I would probably make half or even 1/3 the amount next time.

My husband is on a low-carb diet, so he didn't have this with rice like I did, which meant, unfortunately, that he ate most of this six-serving recipe, and I have almost no leftovers for dinner tomorrow. But that also means he thought this was good, so it's kind of a win-lose situation, haha.

This was excellent!  Had to sub half hoisin half soy for the oyster sauce and scattered some red chili pepper just because - I also used dark soy because that's what I had.  Not only was it delicious on brown rice, the dark soy made the dish look rich and glossy, the bright green broc still showed up for colour and I garnished with a few sesame seeds.  Pretty, healthy AND yummy!  Thank you for sharing :-)

I followed the recipe but added 1/4 tsp. of baking soda to the marinade as I was told this tenderizes the meat....I also was careful to separate the flowerettes from the stems of broccoli, stir frying the stems first and adding the flowerettes latter to be sure all vegetables came out cooked to a crunch.
 I also added a medium onion quartered after the broccoli was beginning to cook....yum!

First of all, I have to say that the marinade/sauce was spot-on for flavor and very authentic.  I'm sure this recipe would be great made as specified, but, like it or not, I am not one to leave anything alone. I have submitted a picture, but it includes all of my additional ingredients. I have added my recipe with additional ingredients as a separate recipe labeled as Beef and Broccoli Supreme which will list all of the additions I used. I gave this recipe 5 stars because the marinade/sauce made the dish.  You can't go wrong with anything you might add to it.

I will give the recipe the benefit of the doubt and blame myself on not watching the sodium content when buying ingredients. I made as instructed and it tasted like I bit into a salt block. Will have to try cutting back the oyster sauce and/or try using a different brand next time.

VERY disappointing. I made it EXACTLY as the recipe stated. It just had no flavour. I ended up added a lot more ginger, garlic and soya sauce to try and save it. I even added some chili garlic sauce. I won’t be tying it again.

It was really Resturant style, although I did some changes.. first, I used little vinegar instead of cherry, I’ve added all vegetables I found in my fridge, bell pepper, carrot, peas, corn & mushrooms along with the broccoli.. when I put the garlic $ ginger in the oil & added onions as well, I did not remove them (I have used ground gignger), I kept them in the sousepan & added the meat then finally added the vegitables & cooked them all together.. the result was wonderful

Very good base recipe. I like to make recipes 'my own' so here are the changes I made: I velveted the beef strips by mixing 1 TBS water with 1/2 tsp baking soda for 5 minutes, and then adding 1TBS of the sauce to marinate afterwards for 30 minutes. To the sauce I added 1/2 tsp white vinegar to brighten the flavours. In my food processor I process fresh ginger, 2-3 garlic cloves, and green onions, sometimes adding a hot red chile that has been de-seeded.  I brown the beef, then add the garlic mixture, saute for a few then add blanched broccoli at the very end. One final touch: I quarter a small white onion, toss it with a bit of canola oil and 1/4 tsp white sugar, then broil it in the oven. The flamed flavour of the onion really makes the dish.

This recipe in my opinion is nothing like the Beef and Broccoli dishes I have had.  It is bland and has very little taste.  There are better recipes for this dish on this website.  I did find one that was very good.  

I would avoid this one.  :(

The broccoli was too tough even after cooking and needs to be steamed for about 3 minutes before stir frying.

I think it's a great recipe, the only minor thing I modified is grating a bit of ginger into the marinade and crushing in a clove of garlic. Aside from that, the base recipe is delicious on its own.

Very easy to make. The flavor was ok I thought it needed something.
Going to make again but do the garlic and ginger different by mincing it up and adding it that way.

Whole family loved it! This compares to the take out we get and we can customize the ingredients. I used tenderloin and ground ginger and added mushrooms. I kept the garlic and ginger in pan. Served with Jasmine rice. Next time I will increase sauce by 50%. It's a keeper - thanks for sharing!

I too did not have dry sherry or ouster sauce so subbed these for balsamic & fig vinegar and fish sauce. The cut I used was sirloin and the meat was soft like resto style, however I found it too salty ( maybe too much fish sauce? I am not certain if I will make again . ..Do want to give it a second chance with the right ingredients .

Single dad but not totally lost in the kitchen. This was easy to do and turned out really amazing! I didn't alter a thing- I used sirloin. My kids are a bit picky, so getting three thumbs up was a great feeling.

Followed the recipe exactly. Used a wok. My husband had been missing our former delivery Chinese since we had moved - and I don't like trying new restaurants, so I figured I'd make an alternative for his beef-broccoli craving. The video was helpful. A new family tradition...

I am on a roll with Asian cuisine. 3 for 3 on this site. I admit that I go through them all with cautious optimism, but they all come out better than expected. Followed the directions as written, well, upped to 6 servings. The only thing I MIGHT change is using a better grade of meat. The recipe will stay exactly the same otherwise. I encourage you to use ginger root as recipe calls instead of ground. The broccoli was like magic almost instantly turning from dull to bright green when I cooked it. Then I was concerned that the amount of sauce with the meat might overwhelm the broccoli when I tossed it back in, but it did not. Another item Panda Express won't see me ordering from them anymore.

Delicious!  Since I did not have Oyster Sauce, I made my own from recipe found online (juice from canned oysters, soya sauce, white sugar). Omitted the sherry (didn't have any).  Also used baking soda to tenderize the meat as some suggested - I can't believe I have gone this long without hearing this wonderful tip! Thanks for the recipe :)

It really did earn its excellent rating! Luckily had all ingredients on hand, and used a package of shaved steak that our local market had on special. Added some green and red bell peppers that we had already sliced. Served over Basmati rice, family loved it. Dinner time was very quiet that night.

I followed the recipe exactly.  The only drawback I encountered was the sherry.  I prefer dryer sherries so naturally that is all I have in the house.  I should have scaled back the amount b/c all we could taste was sherry.  Next time I will either omit it or cut it back - otherwise the recipe was fantastic!

Never eat Chinese out anymore. I make this often. Better flavor than you will ever get in a restaurant.

This was actually just my 2nd foray into Asian cooking (the 1st was a disaster) and it actually turned out quite well. I'm sure that with some more experience cooking this and similar dishes that it would have turned out even better.

My wife and I thought that this dish was quite good in spite of my inexperience. While it did take a little work to pull together, it definitely was nice to have a good Asian dish within the comfort of our home. I definitely recommend that you give this dish a try1

This was very good, I however made a few changes in the marinade I added dried Chinese peppers, Ginger and some garlic then when I was cooking the meat  I added more garlic, Chinese dried peppers, mushrooms, onions and bell peppers.

VERY good. I've made it as written, and again using black bean with garlic sauce rather than oyster with equally delicious results. The veggies can be added to with success (sliced onion, carrot and bell pepper) as well. We will enjoy this recipe again.

Made this last night to use up some tenderloin left over from Christmas Eve dinner. It was very good! Sliced the meat up thin and it only needed a little time in the pan to get warm. A few modifications: I thought a little onion was in order so I sliced it up thin and stir fried it with the garlic, left out the ginger because I don't care for it and added about a teaspoon of chili garlic paste for some oomph. No need to remove the garlic and onion before cooking the meat since it just needed to be warmed. I also steamed my broccoli in the microwave for a minute before adding it because I like it cooked a little more than the stir fry will do it. None leftover!  The sauce was really good, I only just realized that I misread the recipe and added Tablespoons of sesame oil & soy instead of teaspoons. Oops, it was good anyways:)

This was nice, even though I changed a lot.  I'm not a beef lover at all, so not too well versed in cooking it.  I bought a very thin sirloin and sliced thin strips.  To me it was still a bit tough, but like I said, I don't really know how to cook beef well.  I made a homemade hoisin sauce to replace the oyster sauce (horrific experience with cooking with oyster sauce.  Shudder.  Never again).  I got it off of chinese.food.com and it was very tasty with this.  I also used chicken broth instead of sherry (I don't keep any on hand).  Subbed arrowroot for cornstarch, coconut oil for canola, and sucanat for sugar.  Added red bell pepper.  I can say that this is the first time I've made a stir fry that I'll definitely make again!

This recipe was really good. The sauce was really savory but not too sticky or heavy. The sauce was really addictive and justified several trips back to the kitchen to pick pieces out of the pan after dinner was done.

Very good, and very easy.  Didn't have oyster sauce or sherry or starch, but it still turned out great.  I used Chinese soy sauce instead.  We live in China, my husband is Chinese, but he's never had this dish before.  He said they usually use Pork and broccoli.  Anyway, he liked it a lot.

This was great, loved the sauce which I made as written except for subbing white wine for sherry because I didn't have any. I used coconut oil and powdered ginger, extra garlic, and didn't toss it after sauteing.  I also added some mushrooms and onion when I threw the broccoli in.  We were very pleased with the way it turned out.  Thanks for sharing!

Yum! I used venison round steak, added sliced mushrooms and some green onions. Really tasty and my round steak was very tender. Marinaded it in the fridge for 4 hours. It's going into the rotation. Thank you!

I made this following the directions exactly, except for the ginger because I didn't have any. It was very good. I have a few tips: unless you are using a very tender cut of beef, be sure to slice it very thin and do not overcook or it will get tough. I cooked the beef in two batches so it would fry and not stew or boil. That worked well. This recipe makes too much marinade. Don't add all of it to the pan. Leave about one fifth of it out. One other thing, the portion sizes are way too small. I made enough for six and it fed two of us, with one small serving leftover. I am not a big eater. My dinner partner is a big eater, but certainly would not normally eat four servings at once. I'd say the recipe for four actually feeds two if they don't eat a lot. Anyway, I'd make it again.

Perfect seasoning.  As mentioned in previous comments the quality of the beef is apparent when the beef is over cooked.

I made this for dinner tonight and loved it. I only made a few modifications I didn't have fresh ginger so I used ground and I didn't have sherry so I used a sweet white wine and rice wine vinegar. I also used a sirloin cut of beef. Also I sauteed onions with the garlic and left them in and added a little white pepper and salt to the broccoli. Other than that I kept everything the same. I served it with white rice. It was yummy the sauce was thick not too salty or too sweet or fishy, even my picky kids liked it.

Only change i made was to add a little fresh ginger and for the meat i used the tenderloin tips i already had in the freezer. Oh i did add some extra veggies...carrots peppers and green onion....but that wont change the flavor much. For the poster that complained the meat came out tough.....you probably started with a tough piece of meat.

I make this recipe in a similar way without adding sugar.  Asian people do not typically add sugar to their recipes.  Unfortunately, when Asian recipes are Americanized, sugar is added unnecessarily.

I made this last night for the first time. It was super delicious and easy! I used flat iron steak that I cut super thin and marinated over night. I flash cooked the steak strips in my wok(used peanut oil) and then removed from the wok and then cooked broccoli, rest of ingredients and scallion onion, then added the steak back in just to heat up. I served with fried rice and was better than any take out!

I followed the recipe other than adding onion and used chicken rather than beef.  Found it to be very salty.  I presume it was the oyster sauce.  Any suggestions on how to reduce the salt?  I so wanted this to be wonderful.  It was very easy.

I loved this recipe and so did everyone else. I have to say it was good, but I think it would've been been great if I had the correct ingredients on hand. I had no sherry, so used red wine, had no oyster sauce so added extra water and an extra teaspoon of Guava Nectar, as we were out of sugar. I had no ginger root so used powdered ginger. Had leftover  precooked garlic roast that was cooked rare, very thin sliced. I did add 1 onion also. Then used half cauliflower and half broccoli, as we did not have enough of either. In spite of all those crazy changes, it was still really good! Can't wait to try it with the right ingredients!!!

This is great!  We double the recipe, and it has now become part of our weekly rotation!  We also add onion, green peppers, water chestnuts, and mushrooms.

I made this today to hopefully have for lunch or dinner. I was told that oyster sauce is really strong. However, I wanted to follow the recipe as this stir-fry was different than most I had tried and I thought more authentic. Well, they were right, wow, the oyster sauce was all I could taste. I was fortunate to have also picked up a bottle of hoison sauce. I added more than a 1/3 of a cup of hoison sauce to mask the oyster sauce taste. After that, it was pretty good. Hopefully, when it cools, or I re-heat, the flavors will all blend. This recipe was interesting to try, but I guess I am still looking for what I consider an authentic stir-fry recipe or one closer to my favorite upscale Asian restaurant.

I made this exactly as written but will change it up the next time I make it, which will be soon. It had a great flavor but was too sweet for me. I had never used oyster sauce before & discovered (too late) that the second ingredient listed after oyster extract, is sugar. I will eliminate the white sugar, substitute a dry white wine (less sweet than sherry), add toasted sesame seeds & more cornstarch as my sauce was too soupy.

I thought this recipe was outstanding!  The only change I made was to add some finely chopped ginger to the final three minues of cook time after adding the broccoli back in.  I did it just because I love ginger.  I did learn thought that I also find the flavor of the sesame oil to be quite strong so I plan to cut back on that next time.  Otherwise, this recipe is definitely going in my recipe box for a repeat!

Fixed this for dinner today and it was a hit.  Not a drop left.  It was actually better than some restaurants we used to frequent.  Served over long grain brown rice and it was just delicious.  Gonna make it a little spicier next time and can't wait to have it with chicken.  My go to from now on.  Thanks for sharing Dianne

This made a really delicious and simple dinner along with some fried rice. It was much tastier than most Chinese takeout I have had, and I feel better about eating it because I know what is in it. I will make this in the future when I am craving Chinese food.

Very good!  followed the recipe to the letter and it tasted just like restaurant versions I've had.  I used round steak and I cut it against the grain but it was still a little tough.  I read that 'marinating' the beef in baking soda will tenderize it so I plan to try that and I'll comment here on how that worked.

I liked this but didn't love it. I am allergic to shellfish, so I had to omit the oyster sauce, which I do realize contributes to a lot of the flavor. I substituted fish sauce and beef broth for the oyster sauce and then made the recipe as directed and it turned out just a little less flavorful than I was expecting.

I give this recipe 4 stars not only for the recipe itself, but also for ease of preparation and the fact that it can be on the table in about 15 minutes!  The only change I made to the recipe is that I added onion in with the broccoli. The end result was really good, but next time I will use a more tender cut of beef.

Really great recipe, just a little bit too salty. Next time I may reduce the oyster sauce a little, and thin it out with a touch of water. Husband (who's picky) loves it!

It was pretty good. I also added 1/2 an onion and a carrot. I steamed the broccoli and the carrots first, so it didn't take as long to cook.

This recipe is very similar to the beef and broccoli my mom used to make. However, after she passed away, I haven't been able to replicate it...until now. Thanks for sharing an excellent recipe!!

I have made this time and again since finding this recipe a few months back. I make it with chicken and the chicken is never dry. This always comes out perfect! I rarely have sherry on hand so I substitute with dry marsala. Oyster sauce really adds the authentic restaurant flavor, try to find it if you can.

This was great!!!  I used flank steak (marinated for about 5 hours) and added a bit of crushed red pepper for spice.  This will be a staple in our home.

I made this for dinner last night.  I made the marinade in the morning and let it sit in the fridge for about 8 hours.  Very tasty.  I didn't have sherry, so I used a bit of OJ and I didn't have oyster sauce so I used hoisin.  It was still delicious.  I added 1/2 of a large sweet onion, sliced and a can of bamboo shoots.  Served with rice.  ***I always use flank steak for stir fry.  If it is sliced correctly, it is extremely tender.  Just cut it across the grain on the bias, very thin.  It will melt in your mouth!

Love it...The sauce is a little sweet, but the second time I made it I only used a pinch if sugar. And because I did not have ginger root I used ginger powder and it worked out. Give it a try its inexpensive and yummy.

Fantastic! I've made thise twice now. I use more beef and broccoli than the recipe calls for, so I double the sauce. I recomend using using New York strip instead of beef round. Yummy and tender! I serve this with a vegetable fried rice from this site. Couldn't ask for a more perfect asian inspired meal.

Delicious. I added red bell pepper, carrots, and onions and I also stirred chopped garlic and ginger paste into the meat marinade instead of cooking them in the oil and then removing. Oh, and my husband and I also sprinkled on some red pepper flakes at the table. I will definitely make this again!

This is my husband's favorite dinner when we go to a Chinese restaurant.  I have tried several different receipes, and thi was the best.  I did tweak it a little... I did not have Sherry so I use a really good Merlot in it's place.  I used Sirloin steak (highly recommend this cut) in place of round steak, I added mushroom and snowpeas.  Yum!  This will now go in to my arsenal of regulars to cook.

We have never eaten Beef and Broccoli that even faintly tasted of sesame. As written, the sesame oil in this recipe over-powers it. I came back to this site to find a recipe with a different sauce that I could add to this one to try to tone down the flavor of the sesame. I used the sauce in the Broccoli  Beef 1 recipe, which helped it greatly!! The reason that I rated this recipe 4 stars is because I feel this recipe would be very good without the sesame oil! In addition, the sauce could stand to be doubled or tripled, depending on individual taste.

I was pleasantly suprised at how good this turned out. I folllowed the recipe exatly except I added one more clove of garlic. I used Kikkomon soy sauce and Mama Sita's oyster sauce. It tasted almost as good as restaurant beef and brocolli except my beef wasn't as soft and tender as the restaurant's version. My beef turned out chewy but I still liked it. It's just difficult for my 4 yr old to chew. Other than that, it was very tasty.

My family loves Beef and Broccoli from our local Chinese restaurant. I made this for my family and I followed this recipe exactly. There is way too much sherry in this recipe.  It tasted nothing like our favorite dish.  Still looking for that perfect recipe.

I really liked the flavors of this beef and broccoli!  I added some coarsely chopped onion because I needed to use it up and also chopped the garlic and ginger and left them in.  I also added a touch more cornstarch, based on reviews and, since oyster sauce is sweet on its own, I left out the sugar.  I think it would have been too sweet with the sugar added. Next time, I will double the sauce because there was not enough to use on the jasmine rice I made as an accompaniment.  Doubling the sauce would make it a 5 star recipe, IMHO.

Very good! My husband is a huge fan of beef and broccoli, so he was thrilled to have this for dinner. I didn't have any cornstarch so my sauce was super thin, but I served this over rice so that sopped it right up. I upped the soy sauce and decreased the sesame oil to accommodate our tastes. Thanks Dianne! :)

We enjoyed this dish.  Flavors work together.  We thought it was a solid 4 star recipe.  Loved how the broccoli tasted after cooking it in the oil flavored by the ginger root and garlic, I will definitely incorporate that into cooking broccoli in the future!

I think the oyster sauce I used wasn't so great. The taste was just a little off in my opinion. Next time I will try a different brand of oyster sauce. The broccoli was great but the meat (sirloin cut) just didn't have the right flavor for me. (Hubby liked his chicken version, though).

My husband and I love Beef and Broccoli at restraunts.  We don't care for the mixes.  I think maybe we don't care for this much oyster sauce.  Next time I try a recipe for this I will decrease that, by alot.

I've tried many beef and broccoli recipe and this is definitely the best one so far. I didn't like the smell of the sauce before cooking it, but it turned out great !

This was good - the broccoli turned out great! I'll be using this recipe again. If you don't have sherry it might be a good idea to adjust the sugar to a little more to allow for it, but I think it would be okay without it as well.

This "Restaurant Style Beef and Broccoli" tasted good; however, I believe my usual method of VELVETING the meat produces much a more tender and therefore more desirable result ("less chewy beef: like at Chinese restaurants"). I usually VELVET the meat by massaging it with either tapioca flour or cornstarch. Thank you Dianne for sharing your recipe.

Amazing! Even our fussy 9 year old loved it..  We use cola/soy sauce infused steak, which marinated over night. Might have contributed to the amazing taste.

Very easy rendition of Beef and Broccoli. I followed the recipe pretty closely. If anything, I cooked my broccoli a little more for personal preference. Otherwise, flavors and instructions were pretty accurate. Dish turned out well and I would make it again.

Followed recipe and it came out good. Everyone enjoyed it. The only reason it didn’t get 5 stars, is I was aiming for a specific flavor and this was not it.

Very good. I also used hoisin sauce instead of oyster sauce. And I didn’t have sherry so I used white wine. I marinated it a couple of hours. I also added some water chestnuts and some red pepper. Will make again.

I made this exactly as directed and did ensure the sauce had simmered down to a glaze . . . that said, the entire thing tasted like nothing but cooking sherry - doesn't taste anything like Chinese beef and broccoli in a restaurant.

This is a good recipe. If I were to make it again, I would want there to be more sauce.  I made rice with it and the sauce was not enough to cover the rice. Cut the beef into very thin slices.

I love the recipe. I did not have Sherry tonight so we substituted Marsala wine and rice wine vinegar for this. I added carrots. Otherwise I followed the recipe. It tastes wonderful. I am going to buy the sherry and make it again. Thank you for sharing your recipe.

Really good.  I have made to threes times.  I use honey instead of sugar.  I don't use round steak but chuck strips  I've found at Costco.  We added lemon juice to the marinade.  My opinion on the broccoli is that it has to be fresh from the field with the time the recipe calls for the stir frying it in the beginning.  I cook this in a wok, and it's better to  stir fry broccoli and test it with a fork, add a bit water, place lid until the broccoli is done crisp.  I love the seasonings.  I use sliced ginger....... If you have arthritis ginger is a must in your diet.

Made as written except I didn't have fresh ginger so I just gave a few shakes of ginger powder. I used 1 pound of shaved beef, available at my local Meijer, and it was super easy and very good!

Followed the recipe - but I did follow few of the previous review suggestions ...added two extra cloves of garlic and ginger which I added to the marinade ... marinade over night .. added more starch near the end of cooking the meat for the gravy was to watery as others noted..
Enjoyed it .. This is a keeper for me! 
Will consider adding some more garlic even ginger along with some salt (Beef bouillon cube) to enrich the flavour even more next time.. - it’s a little “Fresh”

This was great!  I did have to make two changes due to ingredients on hand issues (coconut instead of vegetable oil,  and I used low sodium soy sauce).  I will for sure be making this again..and again.  Thanks for posting this!

LOVED IT! I didn't change anything accept (i know. I know) I doubled the "sauce" part. Because... I like more sauce! ;-) It was pretty easy to make. Watching the video really helped too! I made both versions. One with Beef and one with Chicken. My kids loved both equally as much.

I felt the amount of sauce was a little small so I doubled the sauce portion and added it at the very end.  Worked out perfect.

This was extremely easy and delicious.  I served it over rice, and there was enough sauce so the rice soaked up some.  I used a rib-eye steak that had been in my freezer too long, and the marinade gave it a really nice flavor.  I will definitely make this again.

Good recipe!  I made it with some left over rib eye steak and marinated it with all ingredients but the sherry, it was still so good.  When I cooked the veggies I steamed them in water until done no oil than put the oil in and added ground ginger with fresh mashed garlic than added meat until done and than added veggies .  This is very good !  Emmi

OMG! It was so good!!! The only change was I put the garlic & ginger in the marinade. I like extra sauce so I made a separate marinade & added a tiny bit of water & added it about the last 2 minutes of cooking. I couldn't stop eating it!

This was quite good. I probably messed up because I didn't have oyster sauce or sherry. But I want you to know that even with substitutions, this is a great recipe. I used pinot noir instead of sherry and hoisin sauce instead of oyster sauce. I may have overdone the cornstarch because mine was a bit thick, so I added some beef broth and ended up with a nice sauce to go with the beef and broccoli. Served on rice.

So good! It tastes as good as my favorite local Chinese restaurant, if not better. I made it with chicken instead of beef, but strictly followed the directions other than that and it turned out wonderfully.

Used rice wine vinegar in place of the sherry used a little less than 3/4 cup. Next time I would use maybe 1/2 cup. The vinegar was a little strong. Once the sauce settled for a bit all combined with beef and veg the vinegar mellowed out quite a bit.

I must admit I didn't have all the ingredients so I had to improvise.  I used teriyaki sauce and omitted the sugar because of that.  I added thinly sliced onions and carrots too.  It was very good.

I added 1/2 tsp or more of salt (out of a bad habit, although it wasn’t in the recipe) and it was unnecessary and a tad too salty. Nonetheless, it was delicious and we ate it all. Also, we did not have oyster sauce so I substituted fish sauce and I substituted Amino Acids for the soy sauce because my wife is allergic to soy and it was fantastically  delicious  ?? We will definitely make it again without the extra salt.

Didn't have oyster sauce unfortunately, so I substituted with fish sauce. I also used chicken and cauliflower. The only thing I noticed was that the sauce was more of a white sauce instead of a brown sauce. After reading a helpful post from 9yrs ago, I realized I should have used hoisin sauce instead fish sauce.  aSo next time I will do that .

To see if I can "doctor" up the sauce to make less salty, I did add sweet soy sauce  on the side. Didn't taste too bad. I might just re-cook it in that.

We were not impressed.  I chose this recipe over others because of the number of high reviews.  I won't be making this again.  Can't put my finger on what it was that we didn't care for but neither hubby or myself liked it. My kids both thought it was good, but granddaughter who insisted she loves broccoli spit it out.

Didn't have oyster sauce, used low sodium soy sauce and fish sauce.  The Sherry was very strong and, I think, ruined it.

I made it without the oyster sauce(didn’t have any). I substituted  PF Chang’s Kung pao sauce & it turned out great. Just added more water & cornstarch to have a gravy at the end for the rice.

Great recipe.  I didnt have sherry so I substituted it with 2 tbsp of mirin.  I also added peanuts into the work after I placed the beef in and then at the last minute I also added some green onions because why the hell not?

Simple fast recipe where the it doesnt even have to be followed to a T.

Very good authentic restaurant style beef and broccoli. I added a little bit of corn starch to thicken the sauce, but that was it.

Loved this! I added a bit of red onion, a handful of mushrooms and about a tablespoon (2?) of gochugaru Korean chile flakes for a little heat. This was better than any restaurant broccoli beef dish I’ve ever had!

Excellent!  I ran out is sherry once and used white cooking wine and it tasted great; just lighter in flavor.  I like to add slivers of carrots.  Substitute chicken for beef.  Yum!

I like the basic recipe and flavor but the cut of beef that is recommended in the recipe was not tender enough for my liking. I will try the recipe again using different cuts of beef.

I added just a 1/4 cup of water to the sauce during cooking. I may have had the heat too high or I wanted my broccoli a little more done. Either way, it was fantastic and just what I was looking for.

It's so hard to fault this recipe. I've made it multiple times, prepared exactly as written - even doubling it up once or twice to share with my parents next door. It is really delicious and 'want-some-more' sort of dish - even my very picky mum, hubby and son totally cleaned up their plate of rice with the beef and asked for more of this the next day. 

The only thing I did differently is 3 cloves garlic instead of 1 cos I love its rich taste on the broccoli (and sliced carrots), and I didn't add the sherry (as I'm a Muslim, so no alcohol for me). 

Fantastic recipe. Truly loved by every one. Thumbs up.

Good Recipe. The only critique is that the sauce was too thin. I doubled the corn starch the second time I used it & dissolved it with equal parts water before mixing with the rest of the sauce. The recipe leaves out this step so my cornstarch clumped up the first time I made it...

I used this as a base and didn't have broccoli so substituted mixed frozen asian blend and had to substitute vanilla for sherry.  The taste was very good.

Made using ingredients just as described, except omitted the garlic (for husband), added one sliced carrot, about 1/8 cup diced green bell pepper (all we had left). I also crazily used some ribeye steak that I had messed up trying to cut in half while it was not frozen, so it was ripped into pieces. So I didn't have to worry about tenderness, next time I'll use a cheaper cut of meat and use the baking soda trick mentioned in another review.

I also wanted to incorporate some rice stick (vermicelli) noodles. So to do this I soaked 8 oz. of the noodles in cold water for about five to seven minutes. I cooked the vegetables first and set them aside. Then used some more oil and cooked the noodles in the wok, making sure to toss them so they wouldn't stick together or to the pan. I had to add quite a bit more oil, the noodles absorb a lot. Make sure to watch closely and almost constantly moving them because they cook in minutes. At about two to three minutes begin testing the noodles for doneness, you don't want them to turn to mush. When they were done I put them aside and cooked the meat. When the meat was done, I added in the vegetables and coated them fully. It didn't seem like there would be enough liquid, but it was fine! Put the noodles on the plate and the veggie/beef mixture on top. It was delish! Highly recommend and will make again.

I’ve made dozens of beef and broccoli recipes from the internet and this is by far my favorite. Followed the recipe except added another clove of garlic and slice of ginger to the oil. So delicious!! Used grass-fed beef. Will make again.

After trying numerous stir-fry recipes from the site here, I can say that this one had the most appealing sauce flavor and I will use it again. However, next time, as personal preference dictates, I would use much less sesame oil, or maybe none at all. The sesame was not too strong in the flavor on this recipe, but I find that don't like it very much. I added cabbage, bell pepper, broccoli and snow peas to get plenty of vegetables into my meal.

Made exactly as stated by the recipe but was disappointed in the result. The sauce had a good taste but seemed to be missing something. Edible but probably won't try again without some tinkering.

Turned out great! The only slight change I made was with the garlic and ginger root. It was too much trouble to cook it in the oil and then remove it, so I added garlic powder and a little ground ginger (powder) and just left it in the oil when I cooked the broccoli. Way easier and it tasted great. This recipe is definitely restaurant worthy.

This turned out great.  I didn't have any broccoli on hand, so I used stir-fry vegetables instead.  I will definitely be making this again.

Little heavy on the fish sauce. Thought it would balance out once I added the sesame oil and sherry, but once it hit the wok - the whole house smelled, totally put my wife off eating it. Beef tasted okay, but very tough. Even in a very hot wok, the amount of sauce ended up simmering and steaming meat rather than stir frying and glazing.

I made this recipe exactly as written, except I substituted chicken for the beef.  I don't see this as a deviation given the submitter made the suggestion.  I love this technique.  It is the first time I feel like I have ever gotten the textures right.  Stir-frying the thinly sliced meat in the sauce was the key; it cooked up so tender.  Overall, the dish was very good.  My family ate it all up.  The only reason I am not giving it a full 5 stars is that I felt the dish was lacking something; I still prefer a restaurant.  I suppose this could vary depending on the brand of oyster sauce one uses, but I wanted mine to have a little more pizzazz.  But I would definitely make again!

Only change was using chicken broth instead of sherry, and adding minced garlic & ginger to the marinade instead of using separate pieces. Delicious sauce, definitely adding to our rotation.

First - thanks SO MUCH to Karen’s Cupcakes and others for sharing the baking soda secret! That is the trick I’ve wanted to know for so long now!! 

Changes I Made:
1. The baking soda “marinade”!!
2. Added snow peas, mushrooms, water chestnuts and bamboo shoots (cooked separately)
3. Doubled the sauce ingredients 
4. Used 2 lbs of meat and veggies (1lb broccoli plus other veggies)
5. Forgot to add corn starch into the sauce so I mixed that in at the end with cold water
6.  Used more sherry than double what the recipe called for (used some deglazing the pan). 
7. Used pre-minced garlic and “squeeze” ginger (more than called for in a double recipe) and left it in the pan. 
8.  Used sweet chili sauce instead of sugar. 

I really enjoyed the recipe. It turned out delicious and although it has scary amounts of sodium (especially once you factor in the baking soda) it doesn’t taste overwhelmingly salty. It doesn’t taste overly sweet either and for the most part, it’s very easy to put together. Despite doubling the sauce ingredients to match the additional meat and veggies, this doesn’t make a lot of sauce. Just enough to coat the meat and veggies with a little left over. I cut my meat too thick but this could have easily passed at a Chinese restaurant and I would have been pleased with my meal choice. 

Will definitely make it again!!

Excellent. We used strip steak for the meat. Tasted the beef sauce before adding the broccoli so I was hesitant to add the broccoli in. So I took out the beef and poured out half the sauce mixture and put everything back in the pan since I was skeptical. I probably could’ve left it but maybe next time I will leave it all in.

This is excellent. I’ve made this several times and we really enjoy it. I do add lots of chopped garlic and ginger. I also add sliced mushrooms and red bell pepper while cooking the broccoli. This is nice with rice.

I made two minor changes...I used sirloin and I garnished with green onions.  I partially froze the beef to make it easier to shave. Should I make this in the future I will omit the sherry and add the garlic and ginger to the meat mixture.  The cooking instructions are perfect!

I needed to make this gluten free so I made my oyster sauce from scratch.  I also had a flank steak on hand so I used that.  Other than that I made as written and it was delicious.

instead of frying ginger and garlic, graded both and mix it with the marinade. Put it all in the wok while stir frying meat, mixed together with broccoli. So ono!

This was delicious. I made a few small changes based on my ingredients on hand. I didn’t have any sherry so I substituted the same amount of orange juice and I only used the thin slices of fresh ginger root to flavor the oil, I added the garlic to the beef. I also steamed the broccoli because I like it soft. I served it over white rice and it was fantastic. I want to try it with chicken next.

This was a hit with my family. I used a sirloin for the beef and tenderized it using a baking soda & water soak for 15 minutes. Washed and dried the sirloin before using. The meat was exquisitely tender & the recipe was perfect.

Overall this is tasty but It needs more sugar and should probably used brown instead of white. And don't use fish sauce instead of oyster sauce like I did by mistake. It's certainly still edible but it tastes more Thai than Chinese takeout if you do.

Love the sauce but my husband wishes there were more sauce for the rice so next time I’ll double the sauce recipe.  Very tasty - easy to make. I added some green peppers as they’re my husband’s favourite.

It was a good recipe to start with, but we need more flavor here.  I added more soy, ginger, garlic and it still needed more.  Also, I will add more cornstarch next time since it was still pretty watery.

I followed this recipe and I liked  the simplicity of it and it was very tasty.  Next time I will double the sauce.  I used flank steak and it came out pretty tender and the broccoli was good, not mushy.

I made this for dinner, and was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to make and tasty.  I didn't have any sherry, I think it might give it the sweetness it was missing.  I will make this again!

Followed recipe and the dish turned out pretty good.  The beef was a bit tough so I'll try some of the suggestions in other comments next time.  Maybe even double the sauce and give the beef a few hours in a slow cooker...  I'll update next round.  Also, the recipe makes plenty of sauce so I made some white rice to take advantage.  The wife says it's restaurant quality flavor, just need to tenderize the beef next time.  Or maybe even try it with chicken.

Round 2 - I followed the recipe as written, substituting the beef with chicken breast. I sliced a  large boneless/skinless chicken breast nice and thin, marinated and cooked as instructed.  The wife loved it because she's not a huge fan of beef but also because the chicken was very tender compared to the beef I tried a few times.  I even tried some of the suggestions to tenderize the round steak such as cooking longer, in the sauce, and coating with baking soda overnight then rinsing clean before cooking but neither seemed to help so I'll be using chicken in this recipe from now on, and I don't think it takes away from it at all.  Give it a try and enjoy!

This recipe is so very yummy!  I put the meat in a crock pot with 2 cups beef broth in the morning.  This made the meat tender and easy to cut up.  I didn't have oyster sauce and I substituted with hoisin sauce.  Really good!

This was absolutely delicious. I made triple the recipe since I have a large family and we like it a little saucy. 

The only thing I did different was to add teriyaki to it. Since I tripled the recipe I added a quarter of a cup. So if you try that you won't need as much lol.

I made this as written except that I used powdered ginger in place of fresh and served it with brown rice.  I'm sure fresh will be even better.  A decent cut of meat definitely helps.  We will be having this again--SOON!

I followed a reviewer's tip of 1/2 tsp cornstarch on beef. (Actually I doubled it because I had twice the amount of beef.) Did this for 45 minutes-1 hour. Then rinsed dry and patted dry on paper towels. Also only used about 2 tsp of sherry (not crazy about this overpowering taste). I doubled the recipe and followed exactly. Super yummy flavor and so filling. I served it with white rice.

The oyster sauce made this very salty. I would increase the broccoli, a full head was not enough for 4 servings. My family suggested that adding more vegetables would have made this better and hopefully reduce the saltiness.

Prep veggies, garlic, ginger, dried red chilis.  (Leave the chilis whole if you want mild, chop finely if you want more heat)
Prep sauce. 
For the meat I use a 1" thick piece of NY steak, trimmed of excess fat.
Get a cast iron pan smoking hot. a dash of oil and cook each side, and edge for 2 minutes. take it out and let it rest while you heat up the wok...again, smoking hot.
1-2 tablespoon of oil
toss in Chilis, stir ten seconds
toss in Broccoli, stir 10-15 seconds until bright green
Remove from pan
toss in sauce and cook until thickened (add water if it gets too thick too fast).
turn off heat
Toss in Broccoli 
add ginger and garlic
Slice meat thinly...the meat should be charbroiled on the outside edges and pink on the inside.
toss in meat
Plate and garnish with sesame seed.
The BEST broccoli beef you will ever have!

Made this dish a few nights ago and it was easy to make. However, did not use beef preferred chicken instead. It was terrific. Followed the recipe exactly and it tasted delicious. My family loved it.

Because I had 1-1/2 lbs. of stew meat to use, I doubled this recipe except for the sesame oil, garlic, and broccoli.  I added 1/2 of a red bell pepper and 1/4 of an onion both thinly sliced.  I first cooked the broccoli in a steamer basket with 1/2 c. water for about 5 minutes and then removed and set aside--discarded the water.  Cooked both the red pepper and onion with the garlic and ginger and did not discard anything.  Marinated the meat for 2 hours in the fridge and then 1 hour out to take some of the chill off prior to cooking.  Since I doubled the sauce I removed the meat with a slotted spoon from the marinate to cook the meat and then added an additional 2 tsp. of cornstarch to the marinate and added it to the pan during the last minute of cooking.  Removed from heat and added 2 thinly sliced green onions prior to serving on white rice.  I had a feeling there was too much sesame oil in this recipe and I was right.  A little goes a long way.  Used 2 tsps. but next time will reduce to 1 tsp.  Good recipe and the timing for cooking was spot on.  May add some mushrooms next time.   I had considered using some meat tenderizer since I used stew meat, but was concerned about the salt factor.  Glad I passed, I just cut some of the pieces a little smaller and it was mostly tender except for a few bites.  Will invest in a different  cut of meat next time.

Super tasty. Easy to make and tastes better than takeout. I didn't use the sherry and I used the steak I had already bought; they were thinly sliced so the meat came out tender.

Followed the recipe exactly except using New York steak instead of what was called for. It came out salty for some reason. I don't see any reviews mentioning this, so maybe I put too much broccoli? I'll try this again but make sure to double check the amounts. Also will try to marinate the chicken for 24 hrs before making instead of 30 min.

It was excellent. I used my pressure cooker so the meat was very tender and full of flavor.  Even without using the oyster sauce.

Pretty good! I did let the cut up beef sit in a bag with 1tsp of baking soda for about 8 hours like one user suggested. The meet wasn't tough so that may have helped. I will make again.

Quick, simple, and tasty! I made a minor change in how I cooked mine. I cooked the meat first then when it was cooked thoroughly I added broccoli and cooked it to desired level. I will be using this many time in the future. Do I dare say it was better than restaurant dishes I have had?

This was easy and absolutely delicious. My husband is very picky and he agreed. As an alternative I added carrots, celery and water chestnuts for a slightly different meal.

This was quick and easy to prepare and very good but a little too salty for my taste.  I will make it again but cut down a bit on the oyster and soy sauce.  Also i kept the garlic and ginger in the dish instead of discarding them.

We have used this recipe over and over again! In our household we have determined its the only way to have beef with broccoli. I normally double the marinade and let the beef marinate overnight or during the work day for fuller flavor before cooking.  Depending on your taste you can use less cooking sherry and balance it with more oyster sauce, along with cooking it a little longer to cook out the sherry a bit before serving.  We have tried it either way and honestly its amazing both ways.  The sherry is a must through even if you do cut the amount.  Its really what makes the difference between this recipe and just basic beef with broccoli.

Very savory Chinese take out inspired recipe but healthier I bet b/c you actually are in control of ingredients and freshness of food. I loved being able to recreate this traditional Chinese recipe. i used stir fry beef, jasmin rice and fresh brocolli and maintained the remainder of ingredients.  I also loved the nutty sweet authentic flavor. Made this for my bf and I and he loved it and I 'm taking it for lunch at work too! Great alternative to take out as it is a takeout inspired dish , if you can prep in advance and afford the energy. I thought it was worth the energy and unlike takeout can last at least the entire week in fridge. I ll be making this dish again!

Thought I'd try this recipe even though I can't find oyster sauce that is both shellfish and gluten free. With that said I followed the recipe as stated except for omission of oyster sauce. It still came out good, but I was missing the oyster sauce the recipe calls for resulting in feeling a need to add more soy sauce to the final serving (lack of salt from missing oyster sauce). I felt there was too much liquid for the sauce, but it will reduce down and be fine. I’m also not used to marinating the meat (typically I just coat the meat in corn starch with a little salt/white pepper and set aside). Make sauce and set aside to add in when stir frying meat and vegetables, adding more sauce if needed in the end. This recipe’s method makes it a step easier since you use the marinade + beef in cooking. It’s usual to stir fry meat and vegetables separately to avoid veggies from getting mushy and meat from becoming tough, so do not try to omit those steps. I think a round steak is too tricky to use in a stir fry as it’s easy to become tough. Use a sirloin, strip, or even tenderloin if you want. Also, for those who don't know, it's much easier to get thin slices of beef by cutting the meat when it's still partially frozen. If you don't have fresh ginger on hand, it's OK to sub with dried ginger, just be careful of how much you add as you don't want the ginger to overpower the dish—simply add additional if needed after tasting.

This recipe came out pretty good. I followed the directions just as listed. I think the only thing I would have done differently, and will do next time is to instead of adding and removing the garlic and ginger, I will add it to the meat when it's cooking, and leave it in. I also topped with sesame seeds when serving. Other than that, this one is a keeper. Thank you!

Beef and broccoli is my only choice when ordering, so I was excited to try this recipe. Used stir fry beef  for this and it was tender and full of flavor. All other ingredients remained the same. DELICIOUS! Steamed white rice was prepared in the rice cooker. Now I need to find a good recipe for crab ragoons and meat egg rolls to complete our usual order in dinner.

I want to make again because I think I messed up. I doubled the recipe and it doesn't need it. I put 1/2 tea of ginger in instead of fresh and too much. Next time 1/8 of dry if I don't have fresh. Used NY strip, cut thin against the grain and it was tender and very good. Would add water chestnuts next time.

Nice and easy to make....albeit a little on the salty side. Did not use Sherry (even though I am in Spain) and substituted white wine in its stead.

Would make it again, but would welcome any suggestions from more experienced cooks as to how the saltiness might be reduced.

Regards from sunny Spain

This is my boyfriends favorite way to make beef with broccoli. He normally is the cook of the house but when this is on the menu for dinner, I cook. I normally double the recipe for the sauce/marinade and add onions later on when you add the broccoli.  I also keep the garlic and the ginger in with the veggies instead of removing them before adding the broccoli.  I've also made it exactly as the recipe states and it's just as good either way! I do cook out the sherry as long as possible to balance the flavors a little more. Enjoy!

I made this exactly like the recipe directed. It truly came together easily and tasted like as if I'd ordered it in a Chinese restaurant. I will certainly make this again.

This turned out amazing!  I substituted chicken thighs instead of the beef and it was so yummy!  A definite file in my favorites folder!

I'm usually pretty obsessive about making authentic Chinese cuisine, but some days, you just gotta have the beef and broccoli. Far the best recipe I've seen, really tasty. I used less cornstarch, palm sugar instead of white sugar, and I always stirfry with coconut oil. I also added quite a lot of red pepper flake, and had it with brown jasmine rice.  I'll definitely make this again.

I made this and it was amazing. A couple changes though - I didn't have fresh ginger so I shook some (1/2 tsp.) powdered over the broccoli as I was stir frying. Great substitute in a pinch. Also, the sauce was a little too thin so I would double the cornstarch. Phenomenal!

This was delicious. I used pre-cooked beef so it just had to warm in the pan and didn't take very long. I thought the whole thing was pretty salty and would like a way to change that. I'd definitely make it again!

I didn't care for the flavor of this and I'm not sure what I did wrong. But it wasn't that good in my opinion because of the oyster sauce. Ate it, it was tolerable. But I will be looking for another recipe for this dish since I love beef &a broccoli so much.

My family and I loved this!  I had to make my own oyster sauce so it would be gluten free.  I  made the sauce exactly as the recipe states.  I did add extra vegetables on top of the broccoli (mushrooms, water chestnuts,  bok choy, sugar snap peas, and red peppers).  There was plenty of sauce for all the vegetables, meat, and rice.  I will definitely make this again!

I did not make any changes to the recipe, other than doubling up on everything. My picky husband loved it, as did my picky 6 year old daughter. This recipe was pretty simple and straight forward. I used a rice cooker to make rice to serve it over.

The flavor turned out great! But I should have read the reviews before making this especially the tip to make the beef tender, every time I make stir fry with beef it turns tough.

I thought this recipe was very easy to make & our dinner was very good!  I gave it stars because I think the restaurant version is still better.  But I'm glad to have an easy takeout recipe that I can make at home. Thank you!

Very good! I'll be making this again, but I'll double the sauce. I also didn't dump out the garlic and ginger, but rather minced the garlic and shredded the ginger, and then cooked it in with the broccoli. And then I still added more by way of ground ginger and ground garlic after tasting it. I also didn't have sherry, so subbed white Zinfandel. It was fantastic!

I skipped the oyster sauce.  I made sure to keep the pan covered with the broccoli and add a bit of water so it steams itself.  At the end I sprinkled some Sriracha on top when serving.  Really delicious!

Made exactly to the recipe. Whole family loved it! I have made it several time and a couple of times I have not had oyster sauce on hand, so I increased the soy sauce. Very good either way :-)

I liked this, but I have to say all the oyster sauce made it a little salty for my taste. And I really like salt. Not sure how I would remedy that issue with this recipe. Also, I like a lot of sauce to soak up in rice, and this was not quite saucy enough for me. I probably won't make this again.

Added hot chili oil, sauteed onions , carrots  And ginger. Yumm-o!! I cheated too. Used precooked steak and threw the broccoli in the microwave and just cooked all together with  the sauce. Yum yum.

My family inhaled this recipe.  I usually steam my broccoli first and stir fry with beef.  Since it is summer, I added tomato wedges at the end of cooking to add color and nutrition.  Beautiful to behold.

Very easy and quick. I used what I had on hand - hoisin in place of oyster sauce, white vermouth in place of sherry. I even threw in a little Ponzu. I left out sugar due to higher sugar content of substituted ingredients. I added a bit of water and covered broccoli to steam for a minute or so after sautéing. I thinly sliced London Broil and marinated it for @ 10 minutes before cooking it in a very hot pan for a couple of minutes to not over cook it. Teenage son and husband polished it off - no leftovers here.

This recipe turned out great... I cooked it a little  because I like my broccoli well done. I also, added water chestnut... it was hard to find the sherry but I found a  substitute that worked just as well. I will be keeping this recipe to make again.

Made this for lunch for boyfriend and me. Made it by the recipe and we love it. I think next time I'll add more soy sauce since my palate and his like more salt from the soy sauce. Staple meal from now on.

It was bland as it so I added 1 tbs sambal garlic chili sauce and the flavor was right so I added about 1/8 c of hoisin. Tons of garlic and ginger more than the recipe called for are needed as well. Served with farro.

I loved this! I made a few changes based on what I had on hand. I didn't have sherry, so I used beef broth as another user suggested. I also didn't have ginger so I just omitted it. And I didn't have round steak so I used ground beef. It was pretty salty even though I used reduced sodium soy sauce, but I didn't take any points off for the saltiness since I used beef broth instead of the sherry which is obviously higher in salt.

Other than using a higher quality cut of beef, I made as called for by the recipe.  My family enjoyed it very much.
The sauce was very tasty and balanced.
Next time I will dry off the  marinade from the meat and saute the beef alone.  I felt the sauce  steamed the beef as opposed to frying it.  I will then add the sauce to the beef and broccoli just to heat up.  I think some toasted sesame seeds scattered on top would be a great addition too.  Thank you for sharing.

I made a poor choice substitute by using fish sauce instead of oyster. That's what I had and never tried the sauce yet. Wow it was so salty me and hub. Couldn't eat it. Will try again with oyster sauce as long as it doesn't have 1350mg sodium like the fish sauce did.

Really great recipe. Like restaurant style but better and healthier. Loved it. Substituted Apple cider vinegar and dry vermouth for the sherry since I did not have it.

This turned out very good, quite traditional. Next time I think I'll mince the garlic and ginger and just cook it in rather than the method described. I may also add a few red pepper flakes to give it a slight kick.

This recipe was really tasty. My 7 year old, who loves broccoli, raved. My husband, who loves this dish when we eat out at our favorite Chinese restaurant, also raved. I was unable to buy round steak and opted for sirloin, as it was on sale. The meat was tender and delicious. I, definitely, will make this again and again!

Made this last night and it was very good!  We loved it!  Can't understand why anyone would not like it.  This was better than any restaurant I have ever been to.  The sauce was perfect!  The only thing I added was bean sprouts, green onions, mushrooms and bamboo shoots.  Will definitely make this more often.  It is that good!

This was easy and better than take out because it was hot and I know what's in it.   I used all the ingredients as written, adding one sliced onion and skipping the round steak for strip steak which was on sale.   I did steam the broccoli in the microwave partway before stir frying since my experience the broccoli takes a very long time to get tender in a skillet.    
I will definitely make it again.

I read some of the reviews beforehand, so I used sirloin steak instead of the cut of beef in the recipe. Also, I used vegetable oil and Teriyaki sauce ( instead of soy.). This was the first time I used my wok and it turned out great! I will make sure I have all the ingredients the next time, which will be soon.  Both my husband and I loved this.

This recipe was simple and delicious and is going into my keepers! My family enjoyed it and had seconds. We eat Asian food regularly and this standard tastes like what you would get in a restaurant. Many Asian recipes don't taste authentic in the end or require buying ingredients that I would rarely or never use again. I appreciate that most of these ingredients are in my pantry. I didn't change the recipe except to substitute a 2/1 mix of soy and teriyaki sauce for the oyster sauce, as my husband is allergic to seafood, but otherwise I would have used it. I added some fresh snow peas from my garden and some mushrooms that I had on hand to make the recipe go a little further.  Thanks for this tasty recipe!

The only changes I made were I added mushrooms and zucchini because I had them in the fridge and I  added frozen ginger cubes (Derot brand) directly to the marinade instead of the oil to avoid the water oil spatter. Thanks for the wonderful recipe! Definitely going into my favorites.

Excellent! Next time I will reduce the amount of oyster sauce. A bit too flavorful thus salty, I think. But overall, this is indeed near restaurant-style...

I marinate the meat with extra soy, ginger root, and extra oyster sauce.  I also add in Terriyaki.  To the Vegies I add carrots,  celery and onion and add tons of ginger root because we love ginger!  I stir fry these vegies for 5-7 minutes prior to adding the broccoli.   We love this recipe and make it over and over again.  Thanks!

Used 1 pound of beef and it was perfect!
The oyster sauce added that gourmet authenticity flavor.
Not too runny.
Perfect if cooked for 6 minutes!
Probably will make it soon!

I marinated one pound of sliced meat overnight using 1/2 cup of oyster sauce, 1/2 of cooking sherry, and the other ingredients as stated. I blanched the broccoli for 3 minutes instead of stir frying. Next time will add shiitake mushrooms.

Being I am on a Low Carb High Fat diet, (I've lost 22 lbs. and my blood pressure is great without medicine for the first time in decades!) I did need to alter this in very small ways: I switched out the sugar for Swerve/ Truvia and I replaced the corn starch with 1/4 tsp. guar gum.  I believe with just these two alterations, I brought the net carb count down to four per serving...It was so good, though, that I ended up eating the whole thing.  Beef and broccoli is my all time favorite and this recipe tasted exactly like what I'd order in a Chinese restaurant.  Wow, it's a keeper.  I did the baking soda trick by slicing partially frozen meat and putting it in a ziplock baggie.  I then rinsed it off a few times by adding water to the baggie and then dumping in a colander.  I then put the marinade into the baggie along with the drained meat.  I am so excited to finally be able to replicate the flavor I love so much.  I will be forever grateful for this recipe!

The sauce and broccoli were amazing -- the meat was a bit tough, i think it needs to cook a lot longer at low temperature for it to be tastier -- either that or I use a more expensive cut of meat -- will have to adjust next time I make it

Everyone in  my family loved this dish! I prepared it as written with two substitutions: I used ground ginger in place of fresh grated ginger and chicken broth instead of sherry. It was delicious.

This recipe is so easy and tastes amazing! I didn't have the ginger but I did everything else the way it's written. I left the crushed garlic in the oil though. My husband said it would be better with more garlic next time but he loved it too.

I made it as described except I added some red pepper flakes. It was great except the sauce/glaze was a little thin so I may thicken it with more cornstarch next time. But it was easy and delicious!

Fantastic, followed the recipe exactly as written with the exception of using chopped chicken instead of beef. This is definitely a recipe to put into the normal rotation of meals.

I substituted hoisin for the oyster sauce as that's what I had on hand. I used garlic and ginger paste (1 tsp ea.) and just left them in the oil. Only marinated for about 30 min at room temp. Deeeelicious! My family ate it up and there were no leftovers :)

I have made other beef and broccoli recipes and this one is the closest to actual "take-out" beef and broccoli, although I used organic grass fed London broil rather than the cut that was called for (don't know if there is a difference). 
Easy to make, little prep, easy clean up...even without a wok!!!

However this recipe did lack that "pang" from ginger and was a bit flat (flavor wise) when using the original amount called for in the recipe. I actually ended up taking ginger and finely cubing it into ¼ cm cubes and adding it in near the end of the recipe while the sauce was thickening up before adding back in the broccoli to give it that spicy tangy ginger flavor.  I also found the sauce to be a but runny and added additional corn starch than was called for in the recipe (not enough to have any effects on flavor or to create that sediment-like texture to sauces over-supplemented with corn starch for thickening.)

Easy recipe to double if you double properly... Not just double each ingredient amount.

I used a flatiron steak, which was on sale - very tender after marinading.  I did not have sesame seed oil and was low on oyster sauce (I doubled the recipe), so I added a bit of Thai style pepper sauce to the marinade.  It turned out great. I minced the garlic and finely chopped the ginger and like others here simply left that in the oil when I added the broccoli to the pan.  Overall this was a hit with my wife and teenage boys!  Will definitely make again.

Wonderful! I didn’t change a thing (well I did let it sit in the fridge for about 2 hours instead of 30 minutes) I’ve made this multiple times and letting it sit longer than 30 gives it a lot more flavor! Very good.

Pretty decent recipe.  Was lacking just a little bit of flavor so added a bit more soy at the end and hubby and I both put sweet chili sauce on top.

I may have reviewed this before but couldn't find it so...This was delicious tonight for our supper.  I served it over brown rice.  I marinated the round steak about 8 hours-I had frozen it for 35 minutes so it was easier to slice as thin as possible.  I will double the sauce next time since there is not any for the leftovers.  I did add garlic to the marinade and extra to the seasoned oil along with the ginger when cooking the broccoli.  We're saving this recipe for many more delicious meals of Beef and Broccoli.

This was excellent,  and easy. Our local butcher cut up the steak for me. They age the beef 28 days so no marinade time required. Seasoning was perfect ... Was a little worried about salt as we don't use it, but it was fine. We all loved it. It will now be part of our  meal rotation.

This was very good. I used a dry red wine instead of sherry because thats what I always have on hand. My meat marinated for 7 hours. I upped the garlic to 3 cloves and grated a tablespoon of fresh ginger.. And added it in with my Broccoli instead of flavouring the oil and then tossing it out. Will make again.

Made this very close to directions.  It was delicious.  Used New York strips because had some older ones in the freezer that needed to be used up.  We ate every last bite.  Also added a can of water chestnuts because I love them.  Will definitely make again.

I substituted a strip steak because I had one in the freezer. I trimmed it of fat and cut it against the grain. Both my son and I really liked it. In fact, he asked for it instead of oatmeal for breakfast the next day! He ate everything including the broccoli. The sauce was thick and delicious.

I am a beginner and I made this for my family. I doubled the recipe. The only substitution I had to make was using a dessert wine because I didn't have sherry. Because of the oyster sauce the smell was a little strange but it turned out pretty darn good. I would make it again!

Will make again. I didn't exactly measure my sauces  but the steps and ingredients turned out one delicious meal!  I did add carrots just cause.

Very good. I didn't have fresh ginger so used a bit of ground ginger added to the marinade. I also only had jarred minced garlic. I added it to the broccoli right before I took the broccoli off the heat. We liked the broccoli more than the beef so I will be adjusting my ratio of meat to veggies next time.

I made this recipe for supper and followed exactly as it is written with one small exception.  I had 5 green onions needing to be used up so I chopped those and added when cooking the brocolli.   I also added about  2 tablespoons of water to rinse out the  dish in which the beef had marinated as the sauce was getting a little too thick when I added the brocolli and I like things a bit on the saucy side.  It is a delicious recipe and I will make it again and again.  Served two people perfectly.

This is a great recipe - easy to do and tasty!  I have substituted Hoisin sauce because I didn't have the oyster sauce and it worked very well!  Best thing, even the kids will eat it (well 2 out of 3, the 3rd is scared of the green stuff!)

Good recipe with a few tweaks. I didn't have oyster sauce so I used fish sauce....and cut back to a quarter of a cup. It definitely need a little more sweetening because of the fish sauce. I also added another teaspoon of cornstarch because I Ike a thicker sauce. It turned out great AND my husband even liked it, and he is a hard one to please when it comes to food!

Positively delicious, and not at all difficult to make!  I added onions, celery, and mushrooms and served it over jasmine rice.  Sauce/marinade is spot on!

Making this recipe was a first for us and it turned out pretty good!  The only thing I didn't LOVE about this recipe is that I found it to have too much oyster sauce which gave it a stronger taste than I would prefer.  Next time I will cut back on the oyster sauce and I'm sure it will be great!!

I had some leftover T-Bone from a BBQ and decided to use it to make this dish. I sliced it super thinly and put it and the marinade mixture into a Ziploc and let it set over night. Since the steak was already cooked -- the cooking time went very rapidly. 

I LOVE Asian Cuisine, but my Husband doesn't like it nearly as much as I do. I did increase the amount of Garlic to 3 cloves and added about a TBSP of Red Pepper and then some Black Pepper because we like Spicy food!! But this is very, very good!!

Very good.  Very easy to make & quick too. I only had ground ginger so I put a 1/4 tsp in the oil before I started and it came out perfect. If you use a cheap cut of beef then slice it razor thin so it will tender.  Will have again yum!

Since I didn't have time to marinate I used top sirloin instead and it was delicious.  I also had some asparagus that needed to be used and put that in as well.  Also I don't use sesame oil so I used peanut oil instead and it worked well.  Thanks, Dianne

Good, but I didn't get the glaze I expected. I added some Vietnamese chili-garlic sauce but I wished I had added more.  I think I would use more broccoli as it had a lot of beef.

This is just plain deliciousness!  I doubled the sauce to have extra for the rice and it was a perfect amount.  I think some heat would be good in this, maybe a tsp. of red pepper flakes?...Added some black sesame seeds on as garnish :)  Thanks for an awesome recipe!!

I made this with previously-frozen steak, so that part was okay (the sauce/glaze was amazing though) but the broccoli. Oh my god. There are no words for how incredible the broccoli was. I would eat a bowl of just that broccoli.

Definitely the easiest and tastiest that I've ever cooked. It's great because what you can add to the dish is unlimited like mushrooms, baby corn, water chestnuts, etc.

Well as always I like to follow recipe exactly... I did not have Oyster sauce but I went to the store to get it.... Glad I did!  I made a mistake and added a tablespoon of soy sauce instead of teaspoon I wear glasses and sometimes I can't see... The recipe was a little over powering because of the extra soy sauce but this recipe is so easy and so good added so brown rice love it

Delicious!!!!!  I made it as written, the flavor was excellent!!!
 Served over white rice... Definitively one to keep.
I  forgot to tell that I used ginger powder  and I sauté the broccoli in medium high heat until it started to char because we like it not overcooked, kind of crispy.  It came out perfect when I tossed it with the meat. 
Thanks for the recipe!

I sprinkled with 1 tsp baking soda and let it sit in the fridge overnight so it was very tender. But the whole thing was sooooo fishy and the smell was awful, not appetizing at all.

This was so good.  I did parboil the beef.  I have never parboiled beef before.  Should I have parboiled before marinating???  Flavor was awesome!    I garnished with green onion...Yummy!

Wow! Thank you! So tired of soy sauce based broccoli beef recipes. This is hands down the best home made broccoli beef recipe . I made it exactly like the recipe except added an onion. I have to have an onion in stir fry of any kind, actually I pretty much have to have an onion in everything. The whole family loved it and they're particular. My son's a chef and he was impressed. PROPS!

I was hoping for a Chicken & Broccoli recipe, but couldn't find one. So we used this recipe with chicken in place of the beef. My kids and I all liked this, but we didn't love it. I admittedly had to adapt the recipe due to a shellfish allergy and to use what I had on hand - so that may be why it wasn't amazing for us?
I had to use soy sauce mixed with 2¼ tsp of sugar in place of the oyster sauce. I also didn't have any fresh ginger on hand, so I used ½ tsp of ground ginger in it's place. Everyone ate this, and it definitely satisfied my Chinese take-out craving, but, I'm not sure if it is something I would make again. It just wasn't exactly what I was looking for.

I did make some changes, I checked the reviews and learned from them. In making something the reviews are a great place to start. It was a great meal my whole family enjoyed. Many thanks to the person who submitted it.

Flavor was amazing! I would have given it 5 stars if the beef wasn't so tough. I highly suggest using chicken or shrimp instead of beef.  It was quick, easy & tasty!

Had this last night, and it was fabulous.  I used a sirloin steak.  Doubled the recipe so we would have leftovers.  Would definitely make again.

The first time I made this I stupidly used Sherry Vinegar instead of Sherry (still learning here about all the different wines & vinegars and how they impact a recipe).  It was rather bitter-tasting but some Sesame Seed Oil helped to cut the sharpness and the meal was edible.  The second time I made it using Marcela dry wine.  Delicious!  This one's a keeper, now that I got my sherry straight!

This was phenomenal! I stayed true to the marinade ingredients adding a few shakes of crushed red pepper since I like a little heat.  Only made my usual modifications which was to add some onions, carrots, celery and bell pepper. I used a different cut of beef as it was what I had on hand, and there's no reason you couldn't use chicken or pork. Also, I heated minced ginger and garlic in the oil for about 30 secs. before adding the beef and left it in there-- are ya kidding? -- who would want to remove it? I then finished the dish with a sprinkling of chopped peanuts. 
I only used 8 oz of beef between the two of us and have leftovers for my lunch tomorrow. I saved some leftover marinade to use another time.  This was arguably the best stir-fry I've ever made, and I will have a hard time going back to my standard!

Excellent recipe, I added peanut butter, chili powder, and cayenne pepper to the marinade and let it sit for 24 hours. Also, I added a jalapeno and serrano to the beef when in the wok and it turned out delicious! Served over white rice as well.

De-LI-cious!  Made it as is and it was fantastic.  I'm going to save this one and make it again.  It was not labor intensive and it was simple to make.   Great recipe!

It was bland, tasteless. I left the garlic and ginger in the sauce not just subtle oil infused.  White pepper also helps.  The addition of chopped onion would help as well or green onion.  One recipe I saw used 6 slices of ginger root for the same amount of meat.

Just okay. I used top sirloin and marinated it for an hour.  I did use all the ingredients. The round steak after 30 minutes HAS to be tough. It needs a kick of something. I added a little red pepper flakes and put some grated fresh ginger in the marinade, but it was still lacking.

This was really good.  I didn't have fresh broccoli so subbed with a lb. bag of frozen oriental stir fry vegetables.  Used stir fry beef from grocery store....saved me time of slicing up beef.  We enjoy and will make again when I have fresh vegetables on hand.

I made this for my family and was so impressed with the depth of flavor in the sauce/marinade.  I prepared a few hours ahead since the cut of meat called for in the recipe can sometimes be a little on the tough side.  Well worth the extra marinating time.  It was out of this world!  I wouldn't change a thing.  I served it over a bed of Jasmine Rice.  What's not to love about this dish.  Simple, quick and easy.

I pre-cooked the broccoli because My experience with wokked broccoli doesn't make me enthusiastic for that way of preparing/cooking. All in all I was slightly disappointed with the result. I'm sure I'll try again though with maybe different brands of ingredients e.g. fish-sauce, sherry.
And I wouldn't mind to use the garlic and ginger in the dish instead of taking it out.

This is a great recipe.  However, we normally make this with a combination of oyster sauce, fish sauce, and soy sauce in the marinating mixture.

Also, if you soak the broccoli in cold water for 15 minutes before stir-frying it remains crisper and not limp.

This is just as good, if not better than take-out.  I follow the recipe to a "T" and am never disappointed.  Flavoring the oil with garlic and ginger is key.

Really good.  The flavored oil made a huge difference in the broccoli.  I used london broil, lightly coated with corn starch to break down the proteins and then did the marinade.

This has become a new favorite staple in my home.  I did make some minor tweaks.  I use frozen broccoli instead of fresh, and  use minced ginger root and minced garlic.  And while I use it to flavor the oil for the broccoli, instead of discarding it, I will add it back into the sauce and meat (thin cut should steak, a pound cost roughly $6.50) when I cook it.
I also added water chestnuts for an extra crunch just because.

I've searched and tried a great number of " Beef and Broccoli " recipes over many years of cooking ... This is by far the best recipe I have tried. It's my belief  that one of the key ingredients (besides of course the Beef & Broccoli) is the OYSTER SAUCE... this above all gives this dish the authentic flavor often found in Chinese take out.  This is now my go to recipe for B & B ... Thank you...??

I was really looking forward to this recipe but was sadly disappointed. I made the recipe exactly as written and I found the sauce to be too syrupy and thick. Definitely not like restaurant-style and definitely won't be making this again.

Taking reviewer Naple's advice I didn't alter the recipe except I was out of sherry so I substituted a nice dry white wine. Other than that I followed the recipe to the letter. The beef was a little tough but that's not the recipe's fault. Next time I'll truly take Naple's advice and use a nice NY strip steak for more tender meat. This went into the recipe box to be made again. Thanks Dianne for a quick and easy work week meal.

Prepared this with additional ingredients, sliced red bell peppers and sliced onion and garlic.  Didn't need any additional seasoning.  Turned out delicious and colorful served over white steamed rice.

I made this last night for friends, and they loved it! It was a bit bland for me, even though I did add red pepper flakes to add a bit of zip. Otherwise, I prepared this recipe exactly as it was posted. I will make it again, since I did like the consistency of the sauce. I will just add more garlic, more red pepper & probably throw in a few more veggies just to jazz it up to my liking. Thanks for a good basic!

This has become one of our family's "go to" meals, and we have it almost weekly.  It's also one of the only recipes that I don't tinker with.  The only alteration I made is to increase the corn starch since the sauce does come out a bit runny.  I highly recommend trying it just as written!

I have never had this in a restaurant so the opinion is simply on flavor, not on comparison to anything else. We enjoyed this, and the only change was to use a new york strip steak and add some diced water chestnuts. The ginger and garlic were lost to us and I would have preferred more sauce and/or flavor. I did not have a pan big enough to hold all of this so I kept the broccoli hot in a large stoneware bowl at 200F in the oven then just added the meat and sauce to the bowl and served.

First off, those that say the oyster sauce made it fishy: oyster sauce has no fish in it. It is made from oyster mushrooms! Those that had tough beef cooked it too long. Those that said the sherry was too over-powering/strong probably used the cheap stuff. When cooking one should never use any alcohol one would not drink. That being said, I did find this a bit sweet. 
I used soy sauce from HI, (Aloha Gold) which has less sodium and much more flavor than Kikkoman. You can find it at any Asian market. I only gave it 4 stars, because of the excessive sweetness.

It turned out salty despite my using low sodium soy sauce.  Next time I'll reduce the amount of Oyster Sauce a little and that should help.

We enjoyed it. I used top sirlion and marinated it out of the fridge for 30min. It was very tender. I had to add more cornstarch to the sauce as it was very thin. I wish I knew of something to substitute for oyster sauce as I don't particularly care for the flavor.

Wow, the flavors really pop with this recipie. Followed it to a "T" and am loving it!  If you like a bit more sauce then I recommend doubling the recipe. For our needs it was perfect!

I really liked the flavor of this recipe!  Next time I would double the sauce ingredients.  I added onion and a bit of red bell pepper.  I might add water chestnuts and mushrooms for a little pzazz.

Not a huge fan. I had high hopes and I'm wondering if perhaps there was some user error involved but this just didn't turn out very well. Way too much sesame oil.

While I'm sure the recipe is right, mine came out way too salty. I probably reduced the sauce too much. Also, the top round beef is too tough and I think another cut would work better.

This is my go to Chinese recipe.  It's great with chicken too.  For the beef, I use chuck eye steaks and marinate them 12 hours.  Perfect. Great with jasmine rice and I add a tablespoon of sesame seed oil to the rice.  Love this recipe.

This was awesome!  I cook a lot so I had all of the ingredients!  I didn't have fresh ginger so I used my powdered kind. And I had to get cooking sherry.  I don't like this but u really can't tell when it is all marinated together.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was alright but lacked seasoning. IMHO it needs a lot more ginger, garlic, and soy sauce.  A few red pepper flakes wouldn't hurt, either.  But it's a good jumping-off point, and quick.

Delicious.  I didn't have fresh ginger, so I used the powder. I also used bottled minced garlic. I despise vegetable oil and used coconut oil instead. I will never buy beef & broccoli again with how easy this was to prepare. I'm so excited I finally found a good restaurant style recipe.The only change I would make is to decrease the sugar, it was a bit too sweet.

I made this tonight and hubby loved it.  I didn't add the sugar and switched rice wine vinegar for the sherry.  I made a different recipe for lunch and didn't like it as well, so I decided to mince the ginger and garlic and add them to the meat marinade.  Foolishly I added 3 cloves of garlic, I wish I stuck to one.  I used broccolini  and carrots (I didn't have maybe 1/2 lb of broccoli) instead of broccoli, I wish i had gone to the store to get the 1.5 lbs of broccoli.  Hubby was happy to have extra sauce but I wished I had more broccoli.

This recipe is awesome! I didn't have oyster sauce, but used hoisin instead. Added powdered ginger and garlic to the marinade. It has a great flavor that everyone loves! I've also made it with chicken breasts and it's equally yummy! Thanks for this keeper, Dianne!

I made this recipe for a potluck and was pleased with how it turned out! I used another user's suggestion to chill the meat briefly in the freezer before cutting and this improved my ability to cut thin strips of meat.

I love this recipe and make it frequently. Occasionally I swap out the meat that I use. Beef, chicken, or pork, it's great and everyone loves it! Especially wonderful with a stickier rice, such as Calrose.

I marinated overnight, but the steak tasted like sherry.  It didn't have the flavor I had expected. Unfortunately, I made this for my food group, so 3 of my friends received this as my contribution to our monthly meal exchange.  I can usually trust Allrecipes, but was disappointed in this one.

Followed the recipe exactly. I did let the meat marinate overnight, trying to get it very tender. But it was very tough still. This recipe was very easy to make, but I don't think I will be adding this to my recipe collection. Didn't really care for the oyster sauce either, never cooked with it before. If the beef was more tender and the sauce was made with something different than oyster sauce then this wouldn't be a bad recipe.

Great recipe, will use again.  Had no sherry on hand, substituted mirin, which worked fine.  Also minced the garlic and ginger and left them in instead of discarding.  Came out wonderful.

Salty maybe, it just seemed like the sauce gave it a one dimensional flavor.  I'd probably up the garlic and ginger next time.  It was good, but like I said, one note flavor.

I had to change the recipe because my daughter has to eat Gluten Free and oyster sauce isn't GF, but this was great! I used a GF teriyaki sauce in place of the oyster sauce. I also didn't have sherry, so I used red wine. Otherwise I followed it as written.

The sauce was delicious, but a little thin. Next time I'd add more cornstarch. Also, I'll marinate the meat for a few hours (at a minimum--maybe overnight) so it's more tender. 

This was a hit with both my teens too. They LOVED it!

I reallllly wanted to give this 5 stars. The ingredients were perfect, and this is not any easy recipe to get right. But there were a couple problems. First off, who in their right mind saute's fresh garlic and ginger simply to throw it away?? Makes no sense - I minced it, sautee'd it and added it to the marinate. Second, the amount of marinate would be suitable for a recipe that uses, say 1/2 lb. of steak instead of 3/4. It's just not quite enough sauce as written. Lots of reviewers swear that you need to double the marinate. Well, I doubled the marinate and it was far too much - it was overpowering. I only get a hankering for Chinese food about once a year, and my son doesn't care for it at all. So when I make this again next year, I will follow the recipe but reduce the steak and broccoli amounts, and add the garlic & ginger to the marinate.

I am giving 4 stars only because I substituted so I can't review the recipe as written.  What I made was delicious!  The differences were: green beans, sautéed onion, grape seed oil, chili flakes, ginger paste - I think that's all.  I marinated the meat with everything and minced garlic and the ginger.  What I wish I had done was pull the meat out of the marinade and brown/sautéed then add it back in.  I will be using this simple tasty recipe again!  Thank you for sharing.

Too much oyster sauce. If you doubled the thickener and added a little soy sauce and sugar it might have more flavor.

I thought this was just OK -- somewhat on the bland side. However, I am giving it a 4 because my family really liked it...including very picky kids!  So even while I thought it needed some spicing up, I will make it again, just as directed, bc the kids loved it!

What a versatile recipe!  I've made it with chicken, beef and pork on separate occasions.. I've used vermicelle noodles with the chicken version, chow mein with the pork version..I used broccoli everytime..The kids and boyfriend eat it up and ask for more! Thanks for an awesome recipe!

I was very hesitant to make this because there are sometimes even at a restaurant where I don't feel beef and broccoli has good flavor. I wanted something different so thought I would try this and loved it!!! I was so impressed with how delicious it was. The only difference is I made it with Goya yellow rice to bring out the flavors more. Will definitely be making this again!!!

Awesome and very easy to follow.  I did not have oyster sauce so I used Hoisin sauce and added a bit of rice vinegar to marinade. I had milanesa beef steak to use which is thin and tender for a toddler with little teeth to bite thru.  Other than that, I followed the recipe. Hubby loved it and it was quick to do. Will definitely do this one again. Thank you, Dianne!

There is no problem using round (or, at least, eye of round).  Made it last night, very tender.  I think the cooking time indicated in the recipe is too long.  Use a very sharp knife, cut thin, bite sized pieces.  If you try to cook all of the meat at once, you lose the heat and the meat boils rather than fries.  Make sure that the skillet is hot before you add the oil, then wait until the oil just starts smoking.  Cook 3 oz. at a time.  I do about 1 minute then flip for one more minute.  Remove and do the next batch.  Don't forget to let the pan reheat.  (The hotter the better - except - too hot and the sugars burn.  5 on my apartment electric stove seemed a bit low, 7 burned the sugar.  Guess what I'm going to try tonight? - Yes, it's that good!  I'm also going to try peanut oil, which has a higher smoke point)

Loved this recipe! It tasted just like the one in the Chinese restaurant, but this one didn't make my stomach heavy at all after eating.  I will not run and buy a beef & broccoli from Chinese restaurant, but will simply make this one myself. Oh, one little change I made; I didn't have sherry, so used Japanese Sake instead.  Worked wonderful :) Sake softened the meat and helped marinating process!

This was fantastic and definitely becoming a staple in my routine.  The only change i made was using red wine instead of sherry( i didnt have sherry on hand, nor have i ever tasted sherry, so i just guessed maybe red wine would be similar.)And i added,red bell pepper strips, sliced carrots, water chestnuts, bamboo shoots, and baby corn.  It was awesome!

My teenage son loves this recipe and that is the litmus test for me. The only change I make is to cover the pan while cooking the meat for 3 minutes, as I tended to lose some of the sauce when it finally came time for the broccoli- we like it saucy. I might try the meat tenderizing suggestions put forth by others, just because...so happy to have found this recipe- delicious and simple!

I referred to the other comments for this recipe and noted what people liked and what they didn't like. For the marinade, I made a mistake and didn't use the ingredients listed (NOTE TO SELF: READ THE WHOLE RECIPE) and ended up making my own marinade of soy sauce, garlic, ginger, black pepper and sugar, basically a korean BBQ sauce and left the meat to marinade for about 2 hours. I added some onions into the dish and when it came time to cook the meat, used the ingredients listed in the recipe, although I substituted the sherry for orange juice. The marinade I used and the sauce for this recipe did not clash at all and my husband loved it. Will make again!

Tasted way too strong of the sherry! Made it as written other than my meat probably marinated for about 2 hours...maybe that was the problem, ..it just soaked the sherry in.

This was pretty good! I would change a couple of things though. I would use sirloin steak instead of round steak, I had marinated the meat in the sauce for 24 hours and it was still a little tough. I would also thicken the sauce a little more. Other than that we loved the flavor!

Loved this with a few simple changes: I didn't have sherry, so I used mirin, and I didn't have corn starch, so I used regular flour instead. I also opted for organic raw sugar instead of bleached white sugar. I marinated the meat for about 6 hours in the fridge and did it in two separate batches so that I could have a vegetarian version for me. MmM!

We didn't think this recipe tasted that great. It wasn't bad, but definitely not something I would make again. It just didn't have a lot of flavor-- I think it would've been better if the garlic and ginger were added to the marinade, as the sauce did not taste like much--and I made it exactly as directed. Will be looking for a different beef and broccoli recipe.

Doubled the sauce since there is never enough. I used chicken and the sauce is sweeter than I expected though I used less Oyster sauce and I didn't think the sugar amount was that high. You can add whatever veggies you would like. I added celeries.

Steam the broccoli separately to just tender crisp, keep ginger and garlic in pan when adding beef and sauce, and toss in mushrooms, red pepper and onions chunks.

We couldn't eat it, the oyster sauce was too overbearing/fishy.

Very good recipe.  Next time I would triple the soy sauce, add some red pepper flakes, and mince the garlic and ginger.

Another way to tenderize the meat is to pound it with a mallet before or after you slice it.

I loved this recipe. The only thing I substituted was the sesame oil for vegetable oil because I didn't have the sesame. I did marinate it overnight and didn't find I had a problem with the tough beef issue. Tasted just like restaurant beef and broccoli and didn't cost as much.

Smash hit with the kiddos and grownups alike, and I followed the recipe exactly. Not sure about the person who said sauce was too runny, I thought the cornstarch thickened ours up quite nicely! The kids had theirs "plain," and I added sweet chili pepper sauce on the side of mine. We think we might put this on a weekly rotation in our house.

A lot was missing from this recipe.  It needs onion, mushrooms and sliced red bell pepper to produce a flavor boost.  Also, it was VERY salty.  This recipe needs work!

We are high school students and made this for a Home Ec course. We thought it was fantastic! It tasted just like what you would get at a restaurant. We didn't have fresh ginger so we used powdered instead but it was still great. We were also skeptical about the oyster sauce but were pleased that it wasn't heavy at all. All in all, it was a delicious meal that we would definitely make again!

I made this last week my family loved it. My husband said it was the best Beef & Broccoli he had from any restaurant! I used Flap steak, I did leave it in the ref. a few hours with baking soda. I doubled the recipe because I was using more meat. I found it to be a little salty, I added low sodium chicken stock to the sauce & some water to balance it out, & give me more sauce as it thickened some. I will be making this again, it's a keeper!

This was good, but nothing special.  I think it would probably be better if the meat was marinated the day before.

I hate to cook so when I try a recipe I really appreciate it when it actually is as true as its reviews. This recipe was delicious.  The only changes I made were to not use sugar and use ground ginger. I marinated the meat for a couple of hours too and the meat ended up very tender. Thanks for this great recipe!

Hubby loved it. Little salty. Next time I'll use low salt soy. Thank you contributor Karen who gave the hint about soaking the beef in a zip lock bag overnight with 1/2 tsp baking soda. It works great! I also suggest using all sesame oil instead of vegetable to deepen the flavor and I have tried it with added vegetables, like mushrooms, green peppers and snow peas.

This is my first ever rating and from here on in I think I'll rate what I try.  I DO NOT tweak ingredients.  You all put your recipes up the way you do for a reason and that's because you're letting others try what you really enjoy so I think recipes here should be made as is written and then reviewed.  Now the only reason I gave this 4 stars is because one of my sons (who eats everything) didn't like this which I'm still surprised about. My other son, my parents and myself really enjoyed it.  I was surprised at how quick and easy this was as well.  I'll definitely make this again and try some different veggies with it like maybe asparagus cut up, yummmm that sounds good to.  Thanks for the recipe, we really enjoyed it!

This recipe is AMAZING! My whole family liked it. Definitely try this one if you like asian foods. I did make a few substitutions....I used top sirloin (much more expensive but very tender beef) instead of a round cut, and I put 1 tsp minced garlic (instead of 1 clove), and 1/2 tsp powdered ginger (instead of ginger root) on the broccoli. So very good!

It's a pretty good recipe, except for 3 issues.  The broccoli didn't soften enough during the first cooking step.  Next time, I'd cut the oil by 75%, throw some beef broth into the pan and cover it for about the same specified, maybe 4 minutes instead, then remove the broccoli and carry on.  I found the sauce a little sweet for my taste, I'd cut it in half or omit it next time.  Finally, I found the finished dish was lacking something, (umami perhaps?).  I solved this, (for me anyway since I like heat) when I warmed the leftovers by adding 1/2 Teaspoon of red pepper flakes.  I'll make it again, the sauce is quick and simple.

This was very good, the broccoli was perfect, cooking it this way gave it tons of flavor and kept it fresh and crisp. I forgot to buy ginger root so I sprinkled some ground ginger in the oil, I know it would be much better with the fresh but the powder worked in a pinch.

Delicious and easy. I used a more flavorful cut of meat (1 lb. flat iron, sliced very thinly across the grain). The marinade/sauce is so good I'll double it next time. I added the garlic and ginger to the marinade, which leaves out one step in the stir frying and adds to the flavor. A simple, easy, and flavorful go-to recipe.

Family loved it! Family of 6 and I made 12 servings so they could enjoy it again for lunch.
Don't think I'll get any though after they hit it.
Big success!

I've made this recipe a couple of times now and I love the flavor. I used olive oil instead of the sesame oil out of personal preference. I also added one teaspoon of hoisin sauce into the mix the 2nd time I made this recipe and I really liked the result.

i suspect the brand of Oyster Sauce and Soy sauce must make a great deal of difference in this recipe. I made it exactly as written, but it was oddly flavorless and runny.

Made as written. Too salty. Did not love this.
