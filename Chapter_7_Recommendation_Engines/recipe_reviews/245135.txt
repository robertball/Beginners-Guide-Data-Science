The pears with the sauce tasted wonderful, but the crust turned out heavy and soggy. If I make it again, I will just use the pears in the sauce simmered on the stove.  Or? Could it be made as a tart instead with the crust pre-baked a bit so the juice doesn't make it soggy and put the simmered pears and sauce on top to finish baking?

I made the recipe as written, but also added a splash of bourbon to the sauce. Puff pastry tends to always be a little chewy (I use it in other recipes such as chicken pot pie), so maybe next time I might try another option, like phyllo. 

To previous reviewers who end up with soggy dough: Make sure the pastry is on top of the pears while baking, and make sure the dough is thoroughly baked before pulling the tart out of the oven and flipping it over.

I made it just as written and it was excellent!  I pears were extra firm, which I was worried about but it turned out great.  Will for sure make again.

I would definitely make this again. I made this for Christmas with my Husband's family and they loved it!   I added a splash of ginger brandy to the sauce and cooked the sauce a little longer to let it thicken.  YUM!

A hit! The caramel turned to a toffee consistency in the oven. After some resting time toffee melted with the  pear juice, delicious!

Added a splash of good Kentucky Bourbon to the sauce and cooked it in the oven about 7 minutes longer until the crust was a golden brown.....,,yum!!

Very tasty.  There was too much juice, most of which I could remove.  But the puff pastry crust was tough.  If I try it again, I will poach the pears and serve over separately baked puff pastry.
