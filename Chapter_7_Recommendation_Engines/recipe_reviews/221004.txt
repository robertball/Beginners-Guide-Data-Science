The taste was really good and the meal was filling.  However, it took more than 2 hours to cook rather than 1 hr and 15 minutes.  I suggest cooking the potatoes and then, make the dish.  If it had not been for that, I would have given five stars..

My family loved this recipe.  I did make a couple of changes I used 8 oz of sharp cheddar and fresh garlic.  For those of you who have never made a cheese sauce before you do need to sauté the onions (and fresh garlic if you choose) first then mix in flour and spices then slowly add the milk then cheese.  A whisk works best to stir the sauce. Sauce is ready when the cheese is completely melted.

First time making this, I took it to a pot luck and not a drop was left.
On dishes like this, I seldom measure so I know I added a lot more cheese but was careful with the garlic powder.
Two easy tricks:  Just mix the potatoes with the cheese mixture and put it all in the crock pot.  Then I poured the mushroom sauce on top and worked it through the dish.  Saves a lot of unnecessary fussing.
Also, I put the entire dish in the microwave for 20 minutes.  It ensured that the potatoes were fully cooked without pre-cooking them.  I let it cook the full 4 hours which made it cheesy.
This is a keeper - winter or summer.

Tasty and easy recipe!  A great way to use up left over ham and cheeses.  I didn't have 1/4 pound of cheddar so I threw in the last small chuck of cheddar I had, a bit of Havarti I needed to use up, and chunk of colby jack.  Fantastic!  I will definitely make this again!

This is a great recipe- I didn't change a thing.  I'm so glad to find one that doesn't include a cream of _____ soup in the ingredient list.  Thanks for sharing this, Suz!

I did change a few things, but the basics of this recipe are great!  (As a side note, I did not taste the completed dish as I'm vegan, but made it for my husband, who raved over it).  I fried four slices (chopped) of thick-sliced bacon, drained, and set aside.  I then fried my ham slices in the bacon drippings to caramelize them for extra flavor.  For the sauce, I added the bacon along with the other ingredients.  I omitted the peas, used 1/4 tsp. of both garlic and onion powders.  I didn't have any cheddar, so I used a 2 C. bag Mexican cheese shredded blend.  I also used a whole medium/large onion, instead of a 1/2 C.  So, in essence, all I did was add bacon, a little extra seasoning, and extra cheese.  I baked it for about 1 hour 15 min., and my husband said the potatoes were cooked perfectly- cooked, but not falling apart.  Oh, and I left the skins on the potatoes (used organic).  I did as another reviewer said and poured half the sauce over the first layer, the other half over the top of the whole thing.  I took the foil off about the last 45 minutes or so, and it browned up great.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Our whole family of 7 loved this! Had scaled it to feed 13 or so. and there's only a small bowl's worth left to put up. Only things done differently were: layering the sauce and using a bag of mixed veg.   As we are currently broke as a joke, we made this with powdered milk, dried minced onions (put in w/ sauce) and a really plain, cheap, fully-cooked boiled- type ham. Unbelievable! Put it all in my biggest glass baking dish, upped the temp to 375, and it cooked perfectly in 1 hr. Thanks for the recipe, we will be making this again!

I am so excited about this recipe.  I followed it to a T.  If you are tempted to sauté the onion I would advise against it--the raw onion adds so much flavor while it's baking and it softens while cooking.  It's also not necessary to toss the ingredients first--they all blend together while cooking and as you serve it out.  With out a doubt this will be my new go-to.  It might be fun to add some bread crumbs to the top sometimes but really it isn't necessary at all!

Easy and good comfort food on a cold night!  I was rushed for time, so I sliced the potatoes and threw them in the microwave for about 10 minutes while preparing the rest of the ingredients and sauce.  Also put the onions in with the sauce to make sure they were tender.  Baked at 400 for 45 minutes and potatoes were perfect.  Also added a little leftover crumbled bacon to the top before baking - yummy.  Sprinkled a little cheddar on top before serving.

I just tried this recipe out last night and it was delicious. My fiance absolutely loved it and apparently   got up and ate the leftovers for his midnight snack! The recipe was easy to make and I did make a few adjustments due to what ingredients I had on hand. I used Kielbasa turkey sausage instead of ham and I also used a can of peas instead of frozen, but everything worked great. I will definitely make this one again.

I made the recipe as-is and it was delicious!  I know a lot of people had issue with cook time and I wonder if it's the type of potatoes you use?  My family prefers yukon golds, but they are much softer than a russet.  Perhaps that's the difference in cook time!

I made this tonight with leftover Honey Baked Ham from Christmas and it was delicious! My whole family loved it. I followed the recipe exactly except added additional sprinkled cheese on top. The cooking time was spot on for me but I cut my potatoes very thin. I did as another reviewer suggested and put half the sauce in between the layers.  I'm not sure why someone would have a problem with the sauce separating other than they did not make the roux correctly. I suggest melting the butter, adding the flour and cooking it for a minute before adding the rest of the ingredients for the sauce.  The instructions don't really say this for those who don't know. You can easily switch out different meats and veggies making this a very versatile recipe.

The whole family loved this!  I didn't put the peas or onions in (picky kids) & it was still great.  I also poured sauce over each layer.  Will definitely make again.

I love this and it's great because you can change it by either adding different meats or no meat at all. A new fave in our house.

Delicous!  even more traditional: Skip the peas- use 3 c. ham, 1 whole onion.  Skip the paprika on top- use 2 tbsp. breadcrumbs  w 1 tbsp. butter and 1/8 tsp. parsley. Make sure you have 3 qt. dish to bake in, its Very Big.  1st day serving is the best, little dry the 2nd day, but still really good.

Really Yummy - wishing I had doubled the recipe as I have no leftovers!  I like salt, so I added a little garlic salt and reading previous reviews, let it cook for an hour and a half and it was perfect!  I also reserved a little cheese to top it with.  Great way to use up leftover ham!

I would give this 4.5 stars but I rounded up. Definitely yummy comfort food. My husband loved it and the two of us finished a huge pan in two days. I didn't use any peas because I am alergic but it still turned out fine. The only downfall was I couldnt get it to brown as much as I would have liked. I let it bake with the foil off for about 25 minutes and it still didnt brown. Still super delicious, cheesy, and tender. Will make again

Knowing our taste, added some carrots, celery and mushrooms.  I can't say this was my favorite.  However, I do think it would make the good filling for a pot pie, but as a casserole I wasn't thrilled.  Just left some of my tastebuds unfulfilled.

Love it! Brought it to work pot luck and everyone loved it! Some even asked for the recipes. I kept everything the same except I substitute the ham to bacon, took out the peas, and didn't add the parsley and paprika. Oh also because I wanted it a little creamier I added an extra 1/4 cups of milk. Turned out beautiful & very tasty!!!! LOVE LOVE IT! Forgot to add that it is super easy & quick to make. Leave overnight in the refrigerator before baking! It makes all the difference, trust me!

Gave 5 stars even though I feel it was a little weak with amounts of spices added. I had to up the salt, pepper, garlic and onion powders substantially. This was a fantastic way to use pretty basic ingredients. Other than upping the spices, I also changed the method of cooking, otherwise, we would've been eating too late at night. I cut the potatoes, onions and ham into small chunks, parboiled the potatoes, then melted the butter in a large stew pot and steamed the onions and potatoes until cooked. At the same time, I made the sauce as recommended in a sauce pan. When the potatoes and onions were cooked through, I tossed in the ham and mixed in, then I added the sauce and stirred that through. That's when I noted that it was kind of bland and more than tripled the garlic and onion powders and doubled the black pepper and salt. No baking involved at all. This was really tasty and a lot quicker than the original recipe would've been. Thanks very much!

I baked this at 400 degrees for 1.5 hours and my potatoes came out perfect. Had I done 350 I am sure it would have taken 2 hours to cook through. Great taste, my husband loved it!

I've made this a couple times now; I use smoked ham steak, sharp cheddar, and sprinkle each layer of Yukon Gold potatoes with a pinch of cayenne. Other than that, the only major change I make is using minced onion (~2 teaspoons in the sauce) in place of BOTH the powder and raw onion. Rave reviews both times!

Sliced (unpeeled) potatoes thin, and used a whole large onion (we like onions!).  No sauteeing or precooking. Directions don't say when to add parsley flakes, but I added it with the garlic powder and peas, etc. into the sauce. I cooked the sauce down for 7 minutes to thicken as directed, and poured over the top.  Everything turned out perfect in the 1hour 15minutes specified.  

EDIT:  Oh, the 25 minute prep time is a joke -- give yourself at least 45 minutes to slice/chop the potatoes, onions and ham AND then to make the sauce.  It will be worth it though.

Made it without peas as that is what my family requested... Baked it for about 1 hr 45 minutes total.  Awesome.

I too think this is a wonderful recipe and turned out delicious. It did take about an hour and 45 min to bake for me.

This was a great recipe to start with, but next time I won't follow it as written. The onions took longer to cook than the potatoes, so I will put the onions in with the butter in the skillet before I make the white sauce next time. this also had too much black pepper for my taste, so I may cut that in half next time. I'd rather add more on my plate if need be.

5 stars for sure.  Make sure you know how to make a roux, as other reviewers noted, and the cooking time definitely depends on the type of potatoes you use and how thin you slice them.  Just keep on checking them with a fork as the time comes close.  Nice basic recipe that you can exchange meat/veggies/cheese for your own variations.

Loved this. I didn't have any ham or peas but it was just fine. I was worried about the sauce separating as another reviewer mentioned so I googled for solutions. One was to add mustard as an emulsifier. I added about 1 heaped tsp of dry mustard and all was fine. It also added a great flavor. Additionally I sprinkled some parmesan in the mix and on top along with the paprika. It took 2 hours but my oven is from the Flinstone era so most things do take a bit longer. Thanks for the recipe, will make often!

Super recipe!  Took the advice and pre-cooked the potatoes a little in the microwave.  I usually don't modify a recipe my first time out, but I always add nutmeg and cayenne pepper to a white sauce, and I love some dill seed with potatoes, so with these additions, my casserole is almost gone with only 3 eaters.  Will definitely make again!  Thanks, Gai!

Loved it!  I made two pans of this for a pig roast and both pans were gone!  I thought I would slave in the kitchen all day making this, but, actually after you get all the potatoes sliced your good to go.  I acutally let the skin on.  I will be using this recipe instead of going out and buying the boxes of scalloped potatoes.  The only thing I did different was add bacon.  I will try the ham pieces next time.

The photo doesn't do it justice. I changed the directions when I made it. I added the butter to a fry pan and cooked onions, then added flour, cooked it for a minute then added the milk and stirred till it starts to thicken then added the cheese. 
It always turned out perfectly , a great way to use left over ham

Fantastic. This is one of those simple all-in-one meals that everyone devours. No undercooked potatoes here: use the foil, slice potatoes very thin, bake 45 minutes covered, fifteen minutes uncovered.

Had left over ham from Easter dinner and made this recipe - came out fantastic. Did use fresh garlic and onion rather than powder. I tried to add some sauce to each layer of potatoes. Like other reviewers has to cook longer than suggested, will up the temp next time.

I preboiled the sliced potatoes to a softer consistency so I could reduce the baking time 50%. I also skipped the peas and just went with onion powder rather than adding the raw onion. Plus we used a Swiss rather than cheddar cheese. I had to drain off a little extra water (result of the boiling?) halfway through but they turned out great!  My kids don't like much in the way of potato casseroles but they ate these and my parents, who were over for dinner, really liked them too.

My husband and I both enjoyed this recipe and I will make again.  My only complaint is that it took well over an hour to cook and I definitely don't think I sliced the potatoes too thick.  After an hour with the foil on in the oven, I took it out and microwaved it for about 10-15 more minutes to finish cooking the potatoes (we were rushed on time and couldn't wait for oven to finish cooking).  Next time I will partially cook the potatoes prior to layering in dish.  I was also concerned that the potatoes on the bottom layer would not get cheese on them as the directions indicate to just pour over top however during cooking the cheese became bubbly and filled in everywhere so there is no need to take the time to layer the cheese sauce.

My family loved this.  I made no real changes, but did cut down on the onion for a more kid appealing dish.  Everybody from the toddler to my husband asked for seconds!  Very good and easy to put together!  Cooked in exactly the time the recipe said it would.  Very good and definitely a keeper! Thanks!

This was a good tasting recipe with easy to follow directions.  The only thing I might recommend is using a bigger pan; I used a 2-qt. rectangle dish and it boiled over the edges.

I made a few changes: I microwaved the potato and carrot slices for 5 mins.  I added carrots for color and flavor. I sauteed diced bacon and then added the onion to the browned bacon until onion was soft.  Added 1 large clove chopped garlic to the softened onions and sauteed for another 30 seconds.    I put the onion mixture into a bowl and added butter to the pan along with flour and stirred until flour was cooked.  Then I added the 2 cups heated milk and whisked until thickened.  After it was thickened I added the salt, pepper, garlic powder, 1 T fresh parsley (could have used more).  8 oz of sharp cheddar cheese.   I forgot the paprika,but will use that next time.  I will add either broccoli and/or celery next time.  I really like alot of veggies.  Since the potatoes were microwaved and the milk mixture hot, it only took 40 mins to brown.
Thank you to Suz Boyd for such a good recipe.

Great recipe. I used American cheese instead of cheddar because it's what I had on hand. I also didn't put in the peas because I didn't have any. Also I ended up having to use a larger baking dish so I increased my milk to 3 cups and adjusted all the sauce ingredients accordingly. This was really delicious and I will make it again. Can't wait to try it with the cheddar cheese and peas. I'm also thinking of trying it with Swiss cheese. Ham and Swiss go so well together. Thank you Suz Boyde for a great and easy recipe.

Really liked this recipe.  We had left over ham from Christmas dinner so I boiled a few potatoes for about 5 minutes then removed from heat & cooled down. Once cool I sliced the potatoes, diced the left over ham and added the remaining ingredients.  I did omit the peas (as I had none in the house) and added an extra 1/2 cup of cheddar cheese into the recipe. By cooking the potatoes slightly it only took about 45 minutes to cook then another 10 to brown on top.

This was an excellent recipe and so very flavorable. I made it exactly as stated. The only issue I had was I wasn't sure what it was supposed to look like. Is this like a casserole? Mine came out a little soft on top and it was served like a very thick stew. Either way it was totally delicious!

This is a delicious twist to the usual scalloped potatoes and ham.  The addition of the frozen peas really added a lot of flavor to this dish.  I made this dish as written, with the exception of peeling the potatoes.  I scrubbed them really well and the proceeded to slice them.  The end result was a nice creamy dish that I served with a lettuce salad and ‘Hasselback Biscuits’ from AR.  We had a delicious meal that I will be making again.  Thanks Suz Boyd for sharing your version of Scalloped Potatoes and Ham.

It would be 5 stars but I feel that the baking time is too short.  Very delicious and we all liked it.  If you would correct the baking time, or give instructions to boil or microwave the potatoes first (easy way:  slice them in a food processor so they are very thin, and microwave for about 15 minutes while you make the sauce), it would be a 5 star recipe.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I was running late, so I sliced the potatoes pretty thin, about 1/8", and bumped the temp up to 375 degrees. After an hour it was nicely done, I just turned on the broiler for a couple of minutes to brown it. I didn't have any mild cheddar, so I tried half sharp cheddar and half Swiss cheese. Came out great! I think other cheeses would work well too. Maybe pepper jack next time! I was out of parsley and paprika, but didn't miss them.

I couldn't find my scalloped potato recipe so I did a search and found this one.  It will be my new regular recipe.  I like that the simple white sauce is cooked first and poured over the potatoes after the cheese is melted in it.  I was in a little bit of a time bind so I put the casserole dish in the microwave while the white sauce thickened and the cheese melted.  I was able to get it on the table in under an hour.  I didn't have ham on hand so I used a handful of real bacon bits in each layer; that might be a regular occurrence, too.

My husband & I LOVED this!! I had left over smoked ham from Thanksgiving.I left out the peas.I used Colby-jack cheese,& sharp cheddar.I used about 1/2 cup each.I poured the sauce over the first layers of potatoes & ham.Then also on top .I had added the onions directly into the sauce as it was being heated too.I think it made the onion flavor more evenly dispersed through the casserole.And no fear of them being under cooked.OH! I read some reviews how the potatoes were not fully cooked so I boiled my cut up potatoes about 8 minutes first!Baked at 375 for 30 minutes(as the potatoes were already boiled)This was a delicious dish!

I always parboil or parbake the potaoes. It's a great time saver and some of the moisture will cook out of the potatoes resulting in a thicker, creamier sauce. This a great way to use up leftover ham.

This was so good!  I added about 1/2 tsp of ground mustard, and I used shredded cheddar plus 1/2 a small block of Velveeta. 
In the future, I think it would be great with small pieces of broccoli and cauliflower between the potato and ham layers.

This recipe is really tasty, but needs a longer cooking time and larger dish. Changes made the second time around include: precooking the potatoes, adding broccoli instead of peas, three quart baking dish, less ham, one cup milk and one cup plain yogurt, cornstarch instead of flour, a bit of chicken broth, and saute the onion in butter to sweeten before adding.

I was Leary in the beginning, but I figured, "What the heck" so I followed the recipe but omitted the peas. Not a pea fan.
I used everything the recipe called for and cooked in a clear glass buttered casserole dish with a lid. Cooked for one hour, took off the lid and cooked 30-minutes more. 
To be honest, I'm extremely skeptical of reviews on this site. Don't believe what you read, only believe what your taste buds tell you. 
However in this case I was 100% wrong. This dish turned out better  than I had hoped for.
It's cooling down now but I can definitely recommend this dish. And folks, I'm NOT a woman who cooks--- I'm a retired USAF pilot (male, one each) who enjoys cooking.
Men can make this and impress their wives. I know because I did exactly that.
Watch your six!

Good recipe i have done several times - the one thing i did was to microwave the potatoes for about 4 minutes so they would be partially cooked before the main cooking - if you just put in the raw potato slices, the top can burn and the ones on the bottom will be close to raw

Doubled the recipe, minus the peas. That didn't even sound good in scalloped potatoes. It took WAY longer to cook than would have thought. I know I doubled the recipe, but even with that took 2 1/2 hours covered under the foil and then uncovered for about 20 minutes. Will make again, very good, but plan on a LOT longer for baking time.

Worked out fine with 2 sticks of mozzarella and 2 sticks of pepper jack. Omitted onion powder since it already included onions.  Didn't have peas on hand. The all purpose flour ends up clumpy. I'll use Gold Metal Wondera (quick mixing flour in a round blue cardboard container. Which contains wheat and barley flour).

I made this dish for my aging parents. It turned out great. I had left over ingredients to make this dish for our family but instead of diced ham I used left over hamburger and mild italian sausage meat. Also I mixed four tablespoons of can of mushroom in with the roux for extra taste. I almost layered in egg noodles with the dish but I decided not to. Next time I will, I think it would be a great addition! Great recipe.

yumm. I added like 4 slices of fontina cheese into the melted cheese sauce then added 3 more slices to the top of the 1st layer. I doubled the garlic powder and onion powder and the potatoes needed to cook longer than an hour. next time I will bake them for an hour and a half at least or longer.

My whole family enjoyed this. I left the peas out, because I didn't have any. After reading other reviews, I added one teaspoon garlic powder, and 1/4 teaspoon onion powder. Kept everything else the same. I will keep this in the rotation for sure! Oh, I also baked this at 400 for 1 and 1/2 hours, uncovering for the last 45 minutes. Delicious.

I followed this recipe exactly as written.  It was pretty good...hubby went for a second helping, and 1 out of 3 kids ate it (typical). I would have to agree with other reviewers that it is a little on the bland side.  We definitely added salt and pepper to our individual plates when we ate it.  I love peas, but when I make this again, I will probably leave them out.  If you like somewhat mushy peas, then go ahead and leave them in.  I will also add more cheese next time too.  "Cheesy" is in the title of this recipe, but while eating it, you wouldn't think there was any in there. Overall, a good recipe that I will try again with slight modifications.

My whole family liked this!  Tasted delicious.  I cut the cheese in half and used nonfat milk to save some calories since I'm on Weight Watchers.  I also didn't put the peas in but served them on the side.  Leftovers were great for lunch the next day.  Definitely will make this again.

This is the first time I loved a recipe so much that I just had to write a review. Truly fabulous!I omitted the peas but kept everything else the same. Stir the potatoes every half hour or so. Will definitely be a household fave!

This was great, just how my mother used to make!  The only problem I had was making the sauce.  I didn't make enough and it was scary making it because it was my first time.  And I didn't add the peas.  Thanks for sharing!

Good recipe, my husband really liked it.  I usually follow the recipes  exactly as written, but this time I added 8 ounces of  cheddar cheese instead of just 4.  Turned out great!

I've made this recipe for scalloped potatoes with ham... the food was ok for an average evening supper,  I don't think I'd make it for a big dinner, just something I'd  have every now & then...

Very, very good. Potatoes took a little longer than I thought they would. I’m sure I will make it again, especially when I have leftover ham.

Made this and it’s good, really good. I left out the peas because well I don’t like peas. I also added I little velveeta cheese as because I like it. To save time I just bought a 16 oz pkg of cubed ham. I’m sure you wud save money buying a bigger piece of ham or 16 oz ham steak and cubing yourself but for times sake this worked.

I would definitely make this again.

I made this a little differently -- in addition to everything listed here I also added sage and thyme. I made this in the crockpot on high for four hours rather than baking it. The sauce was very creamy and penetrated the potatoes really well.

Next time I'll try the oven method! Turned out great regardless!

I didn't use peas. I made extra cream cheese because its my favoret part. Look like a cassarole dish filled with creamy cheese sause. Couldn't see any potatos. lol. It cooked for an hour and half and the 15 min uncovered. Five of my family members ate off it and loved it! Plenty left overs and left over creamy cheese to eat over whatever. Awesome recipe. Next time I'm keeping the peas though. The pic is left overs with some extra cheese melted on it.

Made this as written, but added some brown mustard and omitted the peas.  Mr. Picky loved it, had seconds and cleaned his plate, which rarely happens. Thx for this winning dish!

My husband hates onions, so I left them out (but kept the onion powder). Sprinkled cheddar cheese over the top before putting it in the last 15 minutes, and cooked at 375F. It was a hit with my family, and I will definitely try again.

Loved it, it was delicious. I made a few changes due to personal taste. I used broccoli in place of peas and I added the cooked broccoli to the layers. I was out of fresh onion so I used dry onion on the layers. I used 1/4c of sharp cheddar and 5 slices of american cheese.  I added about 1/8 tsp of cayenne pepper instead of paprika.  I cooked the 9x6 pan for 90 minutes total, uncovering for the last 15 minutes.

My husband and son LOVED it. I think my husband had 3 helpings. Great comfort food. The only thing I changed was I didn't add the onions or peas due to family preference. Very good!! I will definitely be making this again.

Everyone in the fam loved it. The note about choice of potatoes making a difference is spot on. I used golden potatoes and it came out perfect and without needing extra baking. Will make it again!

Great recipe ! I eliminated the peas. Love them but not in this dish. Easy prep,love the sauce ! So very creamy ! I had a mix of peppers and onions in the freezer, dumped this in instead of slicing fresh. Awesome ! Can't wait to cook these again! 
My honey loved  them too.!!!!!

Yes this turned out great/ however I substituted Purple Adarondak potatoes, added shredded sharp cheddar directly to the layers/ Hormel bacon bits, fresh chopped garlic/ both a small red & white onion chopped. The sauce got dried dill , cilantro, paprika, salt & pepper. Baked 1 hour.

We added 1 cup cream, a little more milk, 4 tablespoons of butter, and onions to the sauce (not on the layers).    We cooked 30 minutes longer.  It was the best we have ever had!

I followed the recipe totally.   I have never had this before and was very pleased with the outcome.   Delicious.  Great use of leftover ham which we all have had at one time or another.
Definitely a keeper.

Recipe was really good however, it took close to two hours to cook. Would definitely cook the potatoes ahead of time next time I make this. Other than that absolutely delicious.

This has become a family favorite.  I made this as the recipe is written.  Making the sauce, and not using condensed soup, allowed me to control the salt.  I have a green pea hater, so I served vegetables on the side. Rather than the oven, I  cooked this in my slow cooker on low for 10 hours.

Super easy and delicious! My family devoured it and asked for more! I added 1/4 pound more cheese over the top and it was super filling. Fed me, my wife, 3 18+ kids, and a picky 9 year old.

'Will make this again. (i did modified the recipe) I prefer bacon to ham, used half'n half instead of milk, no peas. replaced flour for a gluten free flour, Colby-Jack cheese instead of cheddar, I did use the seasonings listed, but didn't have paprika on hand so I added a dash of Sriracha....even my picky kids liked it..  good side dish for a potluck.

My husband and I really loved this.  I increased the butter to 4 Tbsp and used 2 Tbsp of corn starch, due to gluten issues. I used what cheese I had on hand, which was sharp cheddar, pepper jack and shredded Colby jack.  I pored a little milk in the bottom of the pan and I poured half the sauce over the first layer before continuing with the final layer.  I love peas, but the next time I make this dish I will serve the peas on the side.  This is only personal preference as I felt like the dish was perfect without the taste of the peas.  My husband, however, loved it with the peas in it.  I will definitely make this dish again!!!

I made this twice. I used dry cured smoked ham, and sharp cheddar. I layered the ham, sweet onion, and peas, between the potatoes. I cooked it for about 80 minutes total. 
I thought it was great. It was even better the next day!

Very tasty recipe. Used 1 can evaporated fat free milk, 1/2 c mixture of Swiss cheese and  med cheddar and 2 T parsley. Skipped the peas and used reduced fat butter. Zapped the potatoes 5 minutes in microwave while making sauce with the 1 onion. Layered potatoes and sauce with the ham ×2. Baked covered until last 15. Will make again,

Will probably make it again but would add fresh mushrooms into the layers and omit the peas.  Also add French fried onion rings on top after it has baked for an hour as a topping

I would not let the milk mixture get very thick, so that it can run down into the layers of potatoes...but maybe that is because I added 12oz of cheese instead of the 4oz that is called for :-)

Skipped the peas (not traditional in my wife's family).  It took 2 hours at 350 before the potatoes were tender (I used russets).  Other than that, I didn't change anything.  The flavor was excellent!  My wife, who is the real cook in the family, said the seasoning was perfect.  I did follow some others' suggestions and mix the melted butter and seasoned flour before adding the milk and cheese.  The resulting sauce was smooth and flavorful. Will make again.

Just made today this with leftover ham from Christmas dinner. Used double smoked cheddar cheese instead which really added a nice flavour and complemented the game beautifully. Two thumbs up on this recipe. One small detail ... the ingredient list shows dried parsley but nowhere is it used in the instructions.

Amazing.  Only thing I changed was instead of the ham, I used 1/2 of a package of cooked bacon . I crumbled it up and added to the layers. This will be a go to recipe!

Family loved this recipe. Son and his friends finished up dish after we all went to bed. Did add some shredded cheese on top after last 15 minutes of baking. Used Salad shooter to slice potatoes with consistency. Layered potatoes and onions with half sauce and repeated.

Great recipe. Although it took just a little over 2 hours to properly cook. I would suggest a longer cooking time or par boil the potatoes.

I made this recipe modified a bit with derhdraded onions,  bits of 2 cloves of garlic and to thicken I mixed peas and spices and potato flakes instead of flour. This gives the dish much less gluten and more potato flavor. I love the dish and will make it again. Great dish to go to a pot luck dinner.  Also added 6 slices of Turkey bacon on top of the cheese.  Yum!

This dish was very good. The only change I would make is to leave out the peas. They didn’t make sense to me. I also had to bake a little longer to soften the potatoes to my taste.

Wonderful flavor , but a little soupy.   That's probably my fault and easy to correct.    I made no changes to the recipe, but wasn't exactly sure what to do with the parsley, so I just put it in the sauce.

Happy with the results. I was pleased to be able to mix all of the other ingredients in pot together, ie; flour, milk etc and that turned out great! Yet, just pouring over the layers did not work well. I ended up having to dump in bowl, mix all to evenly coat, then place back in baking dish. :/

Interesting take on scalloped potatoes. Not sure about the flavor combination? Not distasteful but different. It was a good way to use up leftover ham and potatoes that needed to be used but didn’t quite taste like traditional scalloped potatoes.

It turned out very tasty. I added finely diced green peppers to one half (for color/flavor), left other half ‘plain’ for my picky husband. He even ate leftovers the next day-something he rarely does!

This is really delicious!  The only thing I changed was using 1% milk to save calories and it turned out fine.  I used leftover ham from Easter (since I had a lot left over).  You could also make it without the ham to use as a side dish.  I also used a 9/13 inch pan.  If you slice the potatoes really thin it takes about 1 1/2 hours. I also added a little sauce in between each layer rather then pouring it all over the top.

This was being paired with a large ham and green beans, so I omitted the ham and the peas in the recipe.  I made a larger batch as well so I made extra sauce to put in.  Couple of hints that I think make this even better than the original recipe.   I used a mandolin to slice the potatoes.  It not only made it easier, it solves the problem with cooking time by cutting the thin and uniform throughout the dish.  The second thing is that I put some shredded cheddar and some of the sauce between each layer of the potatoes.  That is the trick to making this a stand out dish with flavor.

This was an awesome dish for or leftover Easter ham. The 2nd time I made it I used half smoked gouda and half sharp cheddar. The smoked gouda gave the potatoes a delicious  Smokey flavor that worked great with the ham. I will definitely make this recipe again.

I substituted 1 Hillshire Farms smoked sausage diced instead of ham (it's what I had on hand), baked for an hour @ 350 then topped it with 1 cup panko crumbs mixed with 2 tablespoons of butter & baked for another 30 mins at 375. Super simple recipe, had everything on hand, turned out extremely tasty with a nice golden brown crunchy topping!

Loved it . . . I added more cheese of course because you can never have enough cheese.  It did take like two hours to cook but my hubby and I really liked it.  The peas were a nice addition.

This was my first time making scalloped potatoes--I didn't care for them as a child. This recipe was easy! Sure, the bake-time wasn't good for me, even with thin sliced potatoes, but that was just a matter of adding an extra 30 minutes to our wait.  I used extra-sharp cheddar, and used 6 ounces instead of 4.  Also, I did the unimaginable, evidently, because I warmed the milk and butter first, then added the spices, and finally, plopped the flour into the pan and just whisked. And whisked.  It came out beautifully. Even Grumpy-husband was cheered by this dish! I highly recommend this recipe.

I did 3 layers of potato, cheese chunks (I used Coby Jack), onions and ham. Then did the cheese sauce as recipe says and added a cup of corn with the cup of peas. After one hour of cooking with foil on, I did 45 mins with the foil off. Deeeeeliscious

I skipped the peas but added cheese which I’ve never done before, and my daughter let me know it was the best she’s had. For me it seemed to be a comfort food.

This was fantastic!

I love the creaminess & it definitely brought back memories from childhood.

Like other reviewers I served the peas on the side, and added additional cheese (had some specialty cheddar I didn't want to go to waste). I think I might have overdone it on the cheese, but hey- I like a lot of cheese. The only thing I didn't like was the garlic powder taste. I will add some fresh garlic or omit altogether next time. Turned my oven to 375 and it took an hour and 15 to cook. Made it in two smaller batches- one to eat and one to freeze- this might have helped with the cook time. Also, I used red skin potatoes and I don't think they need as long to get soft. I agree with another reviewer that it needs a moment to set and thicken after removing from the oven. Can't wait to make it again!

I followed the directions exactly and this recipe turned out very good.

My husband is diabetic so have to watch the ingredients and this recipe fit the bill.

Me and my measuring, I found 4 cups sliced potatoes equals 1pound 5 ounces.  2 cups diced ham equals 9 ounces.

This is in my recipe book to stay.

I should have read the reviews again to refresh my memory. The potatoes were still very firm after 75 minutes. I added a little more cheese and will add even more next time. Didn't need to saute the onions or make a roux - sauce was fine. It thickened up nicely after sitting for a little while.  Too thin upon immediate removal from oven.

I loved it! I did omit the peas and onion (didn’t have it on hand). I felt like even just with the potatoes and ham, it was delicious. The sauce was great and will definitely make again. Maybe next time I’ll try adding the onion and peas.

To be honest, I've never met a potato I didn't love. But this is great! I did have to bake it a lot longer than instructed to get the potatoes done, so I think I'll increase the temp to 375F next time (I'll definitely be making it again) to see if that helps. I also will be adding an additional Tbsp of flour and maybe a little more cheese as the sauce didn't thicken quite enough. My son loved it and I'm sure my hubby will too. I bet this would also be really good using smoked sausage instead of ham just to switch it up. I'll try that as well!

Absolutely delicious! I never made this before, I didn’t go exactly by the recipe, I added more potatoes and less onions because my family doesn’t like them. But it turned out amazing! Definitely adding this recipe to the family meal plan. My son & husband loved it, we all had second helpings and there are still leftovers. It makes a lot.

I thought it was delicious. Comfort food at its finest-but no one in my family did, My husband and son wouldn't even try it and my daughter raved about it and ate a helping and then decided she didn't like it and refused to eat more.  Ugh-I have picky eaters and my husband is the worst. Won't make it again just for me.

I liked this  recipe!  I used sharp cheddar  cheese,  and a lot more then it called for.  I didn't  put it the onions, peas or the
Paprika. I sliced  my potatoes very thin and it took and hour and forty-five minutes  to cook them.  I took  off the foil after hour and they did not get to brown. I only  gave it 4 stars because of the cooking time being so off. CFC

Great recipe!  I used small red potatoes cut in half and roasted 15 minutes at 130 degrees instead of sliced potatoes.  I also substituted a mix of Cheddar and Monterrey Jack cheese to the cheese sauce.  Baking for an hour does complete the casserole and doesn't require more time as other have commented above.

I had never made "home made" scalloped potatoes  before, so was looking for a recipe that was easy and good.  This was a winner on both counts. I had to sub canned peas (drained) instead of frozen because that's what I had on hand.  Next time I may omit the peas, but I will make this again.

Great flavor.  As others suggested it did take a bit longer to cook though.  About 105 min.  Wish it was a bit creamier for my liking but don't fault original recipe for that.  As my first attempt at scalloped potatoes this a great starting point.

Just an amendment to my last review. I used an extra 1/4 cup of whole milk, and it was thick enough to add 1/2 cup if I need more sauce. I've found that 4 large potatoes works out well. I've substituted bacon for ham, and it's delicious. Sometimes I don't use any meat at all. I use green onions instead of regular onions, and omit onion powder from the sauce as my niece is very sensitive to oniony flavours.  I love playing with this recipe!

Great recipe for leftover ham!  I add extra ham, whole onion, a little more seasonings.  Topped it with breadcrumb and butter mixture.  Easy to adjust for your own taste.  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe turned out amazing. I will definitely be making this again. I substituted the peas for corn, and added a layer of shredded cheese to the top. I also broiled for the last 5-10 mins to give the top a crispy texture.

I've made this several times with and without ham or peas but kept everything the same. It is delicious. I also just made it substituting potatoes for broccoli and my family loved it.

Why add onion powder, you've got fresh onion in there? One eighth a teaspoon is nothing. I tried 1/2 tsp of garlic powder and still didn't taste it. Next time I'll try 1 tsp. And instead of mixing the peas with the sauce (which would make all the peas stay on the top) I layered them with the potatoes onions etc. Also, definitely cook the potatoes first. I tried baking in the microwave and they crumbled a lot, so boiling would be better. Other than that, pretty good comfort food.

I made this for my family last week and every one loved it.  I think I liked it even better the next night for left overs(what little was left).   The only thing I changed was I sauteed the onion until well done then incorporated into the cream sauce because my boys do not like the texture of onions but like the flavor they add.  I will definitely make this again.

I added so slices of sausage while layering alternated the latter the sausage I fried 1st and patted down to remove any excess grease before adding gave a another dimension of flavor
I also used red potatoes Alice not super thin but this also reduces the cooking time since I was limited golden potatoes can be used also to reduce the cooking time a touch

switched out regular onion for green onions with the chives and actually minced fresh garlic also if you have a food processor make sure to use that so your potatoes are all the same thickness and cut them more on the thinner side the thicker the longer it takes to cook them!!  Other than that this recipe is perfect!!!  sometimes I will add in a can of cream of mushroom soup in with the gravy you make to pour over or add in sour cream... be creative with this dish it is very forgiving and easy!!

I used onions and garlic and sauteed in butter prior to making roux and did not use powdered.  I omitted salt  since ham was plenty salty and used a generous amount of pepper.  I added smoked paprika to top and baked for a little over 1 hour at 375.  Topping with  cheese and bacon bits towards end of baking would be a nice addition. 
It was slightly watery when it was done but seemed to thicken up more as it cooled. I'm sure this was due to ham containing water.

I made this  with a few little changes, swaps and tweeks...Outstanding reviews!! I began by substituting  1 cup of heavy cream plus 1 cup of whole milk for the 2 cups of milk- made it Much more creamy! I omitted the peas ( not a fan) and  used freshly grated garlic instead of the garlic powder.  I set my oven to 375 and baked for 1 hour and 15 minutes. After one hour I removed the foil, sprinkled the top with a mixture of one third cup of Parmesan cheese and one eighth cup of Panko bread crumbs, scattered around a bit of parsley, lightly dusted on a bit of Chef's Essence and then dotted the top with a few dabs of butter. I popped it back in the oven for another 15 minutes until the top was golden brown. Magnificent!  Cheesy- Carb Comfort Food!

Baking this as I review so will update after dinner. I tasted the sauce and will keep this recipe just for the sauce  it was delicious and it would be good in a variety of other dishes. I knew the sauce would not turn out correctly as written. I later found a review that told how to correctly put the sauce together.  This is from another reviewer: "I suggest melting the butter, adding the flour and cooking it for a minute before adding the rest of the ingredients for the sauce. The instructions don't really say this for those who don't know." They are spot on and I thought It's worth repeating! I too liked that it doesn't use soups, those can add too much salt. Didn't have frozen peas so I used frozen mixed veggies but layered them instead of putting them in the sauce. Fingers crossed that the dish will turn out as tasty as the sauce.
UPDATE: It was very good, hubby raved and parents liked it as well. Great way to use up leftover ham!  I thought the onions overpowered the taste of the sauce so maybe less onions next time.

I made this as stated. I did not have enough cheddar cheese and supplemented with provolone. After the one hour I removed the foil and after 15 more minutes, the potatoes weren't quite done. I returned it, uncovered, to the oven for 30 more minutes. The flavor was very delicious. But, the casserole was rather runny. I can only think it was from the juices coming from the ham. The cheese sauce lost its creamy texture and was curdled in the dish. This did not detract from the flavor, but it just had a different consistency than I was expecting. I imagine if I used leftover ham from a roast, there would be less meat juice and the sauce would retain its creamy consistency.

This was soooo good. Made it with bacon bits instead of ham, omitted the peas and used almond milk instead. Also layered with mozzarella so I reduced the amount that went into the sauce. By far the best recipe for the cheesiest scalloped potatoes yet.

Much lighter and tastier than made-from-a-box scalloped potatoes.  The addition of peas seemed interesting, but it really worked. I'll definitely make this again, maybe with a bit more cheese.

I will definitely be making this for my family again! I made a few changes. I didn't put in peas and I used minced garlic. I cooked my onions and garlic in the butter (added 2 extra tbs) until onions were translucent. I added the flour and cooked for a minute and  I then added the other ingredients. I doubled up on the cheese as my family loves cheese.

Went for this recipe over plain scalloped potatoes and ham thinking my kids would like a cheesy version better and they did! I microwaved my sliced potatoes for 3 minutes first because I didn't have a full hour to cook and after 45 minutes it was great. I melted the butter first, added the flour to make a roux and cooked a couple minutes before whisking in the milk. Thickened up pretty quickly that way. Used pre-shredded cheddar cheese instead of diced. Just made it a 2nd time and realized there are peas in the recipe! Oops- I'd rather have them on the side anyways.

My husband made this  exactly as directed. We both love it.  I'm doing low carb now and trying to figure out how to do this with cauliflower as potato substitute.  Can't have flour in the cheese sauce so have to figure out a thickener or  adjust the  milk. I use heavy cream so that might help to thicken it. Sure hope so. I don't want to give this up!

This was awesome! Thanks so much! I used broccoli because it's new year's day and that's all I had (stores are all closed) plus I left out the powders for the same reason. Still, the addition of ham and veggies is awesome. Thanks so much! There are zero leftovers so that's a good sign!

Delicious! I had to make a few minor alterations to make it my own, more onions and more cheese. Yum!

I followed the recipe exactly. The taste was great but the consistency was very runny. It turned out more like potato soup than scalloped potatoes. I won't be making it again.

We really loved this casserole, and I made it just as the recipe called for.  I used Yukon Gold potatoes and sliced them very thinly.  I think that's the secret to having it bake in one hour.

I figured it out, and it's 5 stars with this tip- Slice the potatoes FIRST, grease a pan, and bake the potatoes in the preheating oven. THEN follow the instructions, layering the potatoes last! I hope my comment makes it this time. This dish is delicious, just took FOREVER to bake. This tip makes the time right. Enjoy!

Easy, Delicious, and GONE!!!! First time in a long time that there are no leftovers.  The only thing I did differently is I used green beans instead of peas because I didn't have any but they were good too.

This dish was absolutely delicious! I added a little extra seasoning, but not sure it even needed it. Make sure to add the cheese to your cheese sauce before you add extra salt. Added a little extra goat cheese for some tang.

Absolutely loved this recipe!  Was never one to try to make scalloped potatoes but my husband likes them so I searched for a simple recipe....and I found it!  It's so simple to make and delicious.  Didn't have any peas but even without it it's delicious.

This was good - nice comfort food.  I subbed broccoli and Polish sausage (what was on hand), but will use  with the peas and ham next time.  I thought the amount of sauce looked too slight, so dribbled in some chicken broth, but it didn't need it.  Scaled down for the 2 of us, baked in a 8" Corningware dish and covered it while baking, 1 hour.

Although it did take about 1 hour 45 minutes but wow what a delicious dinner.  
My changes: I used 2 cups of 35% cream instead of milk.
I used a bit more diced ham and a bit fewer potatoes.
I also added about 1 cup of milk.

Made it for a friends funeral, made a double batch and there was none leftover. Had many compliments on it. I made exactly like recipe except I didn't have any onion powder so didn't use it. That was the only change.  Will be making it again.

I made this in a 9x13 so I had to 1/2 again the ingredients. The only thing I changed was to add 2 TBL spoons of horseradish.
My wife and I loved it.

Delicious. Possibly the best scalloped potatoes I've ever had; definitely the best I've made. I omitted the ham. I subbed mozzarella and a garlic jack cheese for the cheddar, and sprinkled parm on top. I sautéed onions in butter first, added the flour to make a roux, then the milk, then the cheese, stirring the whole time to prevent lumps. I baked it at 400 covered and it probably took 45 minutes. I low broiled it at the end to get the burnt crispy bits on the edges. So so yummy!!

I made three layers,  added cut cooked bacon with the layered ham,  and layered the sauce in also.  It was easy prep, filled the house with wonderful aroma while cooking, and was gobbled up by the family.  A keeper for sure!

It was pretty good. Notes to myself: slice the potatoes thinly (didn't have a problem with baking time though), sauce needs to be thicker.

I've made these twice. Super easy. 1st time o made it took forever. I used a glass casserole dish. 2nd time cut my time down by a lot. I used a metal 8x8 T-fal pan.

I did not add peas.  
I used shredded cheese (blend of mozzarella and cheddar).
I also added some celery.
I also cooked it for 2 hours.

I used gluten-free flour as my mom is celiac, and this recipe was a hit for my whole family this Easter!! I used extra cheddar for the sauce and  added some on top so it was crispy. My dad threw it on the smoker for 2.5 hrs with the ham and it was fantastic! I didn't use ham as we cooked ham for our main course.

I had a chunk of ham that I wanted to use up and scalloped potatoes and ham was the perfect solution. This recipe was so easy. I loved the idea of just mixing the milk, butter and flour all right in together. I used a wire whisk and in no time it all thickened up and then I I added the cheese. I did add a couple extra potatoes and extra milk, butter, flour and cheese just to ensure there would be leftovers. Delish! Thank you!

A very good scalloped potato recipe. I think the ham you use will make a big difference. I don't know what others were talking about. I had a 9x12 pan with two layers of thin cut potatoes and they were very tender after the time said in the recipe. One hour and 15 minutes was all I cooked it for.

It took over 2 and a half hours in the oven, and the potatoes were still not done. I do like the recipe but next time I will pre-cook the potatoes a little and increase the oven to 400 degrees.

Wow, was this good and so satisfying. I don't like ham, though, so I substituted Italian spice sausage (Johnsonville  brand, about the size of a brat, sliced). Sauteed the onion first and browned the sausage. I bar-boiled the potatoes too, as others suggested so it wouldn't take as long.  It was a very quick potatoe side with the pre-cooking of onions and potatoes.

1 hr 15 minutes is not an adequate amount of time to cook the potatoes. Perhaps increasing the temperature may help.

The first time I made it, as far as I recall I made it exactly as written and I thought it was a little drier than I prefer.  Tonight when I made it I omitted the cup of peas and substituted an extra cup of potatoes, added some extra milk and I topped it with slices of bell peppers, alternating red and green for a Christmas seasonal dish.  Apparently I added just a bit too much extra milk, as this time is was a bit too moist for our taste.  Tonight's dish also had a little too much black pepper for our taste, although I added only the amount in the recipe.  It may have been the particular brand and grind of pepper we now have on hand that made the difference.  I'll get it right for our tastes yet! I used red potatoes both times.

I must confess that I have not made my own from scratch scalloped potatoes in many years, but today I decided to look for a recipe that seemed simple but looked yummy.  I did not add the peas (grandson was coming for dinner and he does not like peas!), but I did not change any of the rest of the ingredients.  I became optimistic during the oven time because, man, did it smell good!  And...it tasted very good!!  My 18 year old grandson had 3 large helpings and said more than once how good it was!!  This is certainly a keeper for my recipe box!

Great Basic and easy recipe. I did it without the ham as we had a ham roast with it. The only other change I made was I added a little feta cheese just to give it a little zip.

I made it with cheddarwurst sausage that I diced up because that's what I had. I also increased the seasoning amounts because of personal preference. I used one of those mandolin slicers to slice the potatoes so they were thin and even. Baked for about 45 min covered and finished another 15 or so uncovered. Everything was cooked well and this was delicious.

Good flavor.  Definitely needs more cook time.  2 hours was just about right.  Also, I sauteed the onion in the butter before making the roux and topped it with shredded cheese.  It was a bit watery at the bottom.  Not sure why.  I will try drying the potatoes next time.

Made 1.5x the sauce because I think I had too many potatoes (9 small-medium sized red potatoes). Sauce was perfect. I made a roux with butter and flour before adding milk and seasonings. I also used mixed veggies instead of just peas. Baked 1hr covered and 20min uncovered. My husband and preschoolers all had seconds!

I love this recipe.  Loved the cheese sauce part of it the best.  I mixed together the potatoes, ham, and peas, then I sauteed the onion, some fresh garlic and made the cheese sauce.  I mixed the sauce with potato mixture and baked it about an hour and a half.  Excellent.

Tastes good, but next time I would add way more cheese. Also make sure to slices your potatoes as this as possible. I needed to bake this an extra 30 minutes because I think my potatoes were too thick. I also added extra ham to make it a little heartier.

I had been looking for a ham and scalloped potato recipe for some time and this one fit exactly what I was looking for!  Based on my own experience with potatoes, I first sliced and boiled my potatoes for about 10 minutes. (I like my potatoes tender!)  Rather than combining all the milk, flour, salt, pepper together at once, I made a rue, melting the butter, adding the flour/salt/pepper and whisking it into the butter, then slowly adding the milk.  My husband enjoyed the meal and was skeptical when he saw the peas - but decided they too were good in the dish. :) Thank you for sharing!

I substituted bacon for the ham, and added shredded cheddar cheese during the last 15 minutes in the oven. Turned out fantastic. Excellent recipe. I will certainly use thus one again.

I decreased flour by 1 tbsp, added 1 can cream of celery soup and 1/4 cup sour cream. I did not include the peas. With these changes, definitely 5 stars. It was a big hit.

It's amazibg! Make the white sauce first, then add on the milk and melt in the cheese before layering in the dish.   I actually added a little extra milk to make the sauce be less thick. It is wonderful!

This was delicious! I added some basil. When I made the sauce I sauteed the onions in the butter, then added a little bit of flour, then a little bit of milk, stirred, and kept adding flour and milk in small amounts, like you would if making gravy. Otherwise, the sauce is likely to be lumpy. Also, instead of mixing the peas in with the sauce, I layered them in with the potatoes and ham, so that they wouldn't all be on top of the casserole. I used Russet potatoes, because they were on hand. Excellent flavor, and it tasted even better the next day.

Not sure what I did wrong on this... It came out really runny.  Not a creamy texture at all.  I used shredded sharp cheddar cheese and also used skim milk.  Would either or both of those have caused it not to thicken?  I did also double the recipe.  I made a roux, but it didn't seem to want to thicken much. Is there a specific kind of cheese I should use next time?  Or do I need to use at least 2% milk?  The flavors were good, but very, very runny.  Also baked at 375 for about 1 1/2 hours.  I'm sure it was due to user error (me), but hesitant to make again until I know what to correct!

Tasted great but took a bit longer to get a nice crust than is let on.  And if you're dealing with real potatoes (not just frozen already prepped) you're going to deal with a longer prep time.  I'd advise doing up the roué with the butter and flour first and then adding the rest to save time/flavor as well.  I also melted a bit more cheese into it and then sprinkled some on top.  Seriously, you can not have too much cheese with potatoes.  Otherwise, this recipe is a great one to play with, thank you!

Instead of ham I used 7 slices of maple flavoured bacon. Instead of peas I used chives and a small can of cream of corn. I also used one cup of 1% milk and a pint of whipping cream. I added the above ingredients to the melted butter and flour.

Excellent!!  I made a roux before adding the milk and cheese, not sure if it would have worked dumping it all in at once.  Also cooked 2 freshly minced cloves of garlic with the roux.  Very easy recipe, I love it!

I substituted Baja Roasted Corn Blend in place of the peas and it gave it a much better flavor to me, and looks prettier too. I also used 8 oz. pkg of shredded cheddar/jack thereby doubling the cheese. BAM!

This was nice to use up left over ham.  I used 1 1/2 cups of ham, 1 3/4 cup of milk and 1/2 pound of cheese, putting some in the layers.

My search for a recipe to use up my leftover ham that had been frozen and all other ingredients from scratch led me here. I really enjoyed it and have made this a few times since.  I made exactly as stated the first time and it is a good solid recipe. I added hot sauce for an extra kick on my serving. After that I have added different veggies (whatever was in the fridge - mushrooms & red bell peppers, corn & carrots) and has turned out great each time. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This was an excellent recipe.  I read the other reviews and appreciated the person who explained how you add the milk slowly to the flour and spices, otherwise I am not sure it would have thickened as nicely as it did.  I also didn't have a block of cheese so I used a cup of shredded cheese and added some on top to give it a nice browned crust.  I also fried up a 1/2 can of mushrooms with the onion and garlic and put that in the sauce.  After reading some comments that it didn't cook in the hour I decided to cut the potatoes pretty thin and I put them in the microwave with a little water for about 3 mins. prior to putting the whole casserole in the oven and it cooked nicely in one hour at 350 degrees.  I think this is the first time I have made really great scalloped potatoes and ham.  This is in my recipe box now and I'll serve it to company.  Thanks!

Sooo yummy! I made a couple very minor changes; I used a whole small onion and 2 cups sharp cheddar. My husband loved it. The dried out ham left over from Easter tasted great! Will make again.

I added significantly more cheese than called for, and I left out the peas because my wife can't stand them. It turned out fantastically and my wife can't wait for more left over ham so I can make this again!

Good comfort food but I plan to modify a little next time.  I found it to have too much liquid & peas, and not enough cheese.  Overall, pretty good

Made with a little extra cheese, Worcestershire sauce, and cayenne . Did not add the peas.

I thought it was 5 stars and my fiance thought 4 stars. Will make again to use up leftover ham!

This was so good.  I didn't have time for it all to cook, so I pre-cooked the sliced potatoes in the microwave for 6-8 minutes.  I upped the spices a tiny bit.  We agreed, it was the best scalloped potatoes I've ever made.

I must have done something wrong, because the end result was more like soup than scalloped. Flavor was excellent.

I tried these and they were good. My husband liked them also. They were missing something for a 5 star rating. I love scalloped potatoes but I have not found a recipe better than my Aunt's. She will hardly ever share a recipe and if she does she usually leaves one ingredient out so no one can make it better than her.

Very good, but they do take longer than an hour to cook. I make these as part of my freezer stock for dinners. Just get them ready, don't cook them and put in the freezer. Take out, thaw and cook.

This was the first time I've made a homemade cheese sauce, and it yummy,yummy,yummy.  My husband loved this! he couldn't get enough, my 6yr old daughter who it so picky couldn't stop saying how much she liked this meal.  The only thing I changed was used smoked sausage instead, and used xtra cheese on each layer.  Thanks so much!

Omitted onion powder and peas.  Similar to au gratin potatoes.  Used leftover bone-in pork roast (basically uncured ham).  Sprinkled shredded cheddar on top of ham and onions rather than adding to béchamel.  Yummy.

I was looking for a recipe to use leftover ham.  This caught my eye and with all ingredients on hand, except for peas it was worth a try.  Delicious.  I did substitute almond milk for regular milk. My husband loved them and is looking forward to leftovers tomorrow - he says Scalloped Potatoes are always better the next day.

Delicious! I made it according to directions except for the peas. Only had Green Beans on hand so threw those in. Was so creamy and cheesy. Only thing I would change is maybe a little  less ham but other than that is now one of my favorite recipes. Boyfriend LOVED it. No leftover casserole in this house!!

This was the best scalloped potato dish I have ever eaten!  I didn't have peas; other than that, I made the recipe as directed.  We ate it as a main dish.  Note:  I used a mandolin to thinly slice the potatoes, so they were done in time.  Being so thin, it's possible that I could have gotten away with a shorter bake, but it will take a repeat to be sure. Furthermore, I wouldn't hesitate to replace the peas with vegetables that I had available, such as broccoli, carrots or a mix.

I precooked the potatoes, and it was prefect. The cheese never quite mixed completely, but I'm ok with that it didn't affect the taste at all. Yum!

The flavor is really good.  I didn't change anything, made the way the recipe is written other then it needs more time to cook.  The potatoes were still hard after an hour of cooking. I cooked for 2 hours.

Thanksgiving leftover ham recipe favorite!  Used 2 cups (frozen,thawed, & drained) garden green beans as substitute for peas. Everything else the same, and it's perfect!

Husband informed me that THIS is a keeper and a definite do-over. Had left over pulled pork, went looking for a recipe and found this one.  Didn't have milk, so I used evaporated mile and only had monterey jack for cheese. Took the advise from another reviewer and cut up left over bacon and added it to the layer. The flavor was so awesome.

Very good!!  I definitely have to remember to spray the baking dish with cooking spray...I made this without the ham and peas as a side dish - my picky son, husband and dad all ate and loved it.  I will defiitely make again changing it up some more but this is something very tasty and easy.

Outstanding. I omitted the peas and onions. I used American cheese slices in the sauce. About 6 slices, and used the cheddar on top. Covered in foil. Took foil off last ten minutes and broiled to brown top. Will make again for sure. Highly recommend

Delicious!! Loved it as is.  Only change I would make would be to reduce or omit the salt.  Maybe my ham was especially salty or maybe because I used shredded cheddar, but it could have done with a little less salt.  But it was great and even my picky husband liked it!  Super easy to make, too!  Thank you!

Very good recipe.  I cooked it less time as I used canned potatoes.  Broiled it for a couple minutes to get a nice browned top.  Thought it was just a tad soupy and will adjust for that if I make it again.
Shared the leftovers with my elderly in-laws and they raved about it.

I had leftover ham and a bag of "use or lose" potatoes, along with some frozen veggies in the freezer. I doubled the recipe for the white sauce, as my family likes things saucy, and I used mixed frozen veggies instead of peas. I also added a coating of buttered bread crumbs on the top, which made it extra yummy. I served it with a tossed salad and crusty bread. This made a great supper meal. Real comfort food.

Question? can this be made a day ahead. Since it takes so long to cook. I will be having guests they will be hungry right after church Easter? Can not leave oven on while we are gone either.

I've never had homemade scalloped potatoes before.  This recipe rocks and I will never buy boxed again.  Yet another fabulous use for leftover country ham!

Oh my, this is good! I have made ham & scalloped potatoes with creamed soups in the past & my husband's response was "ho hum," but he LIKES this recipe. I just spooned some heated canned peas over the scalloped potatoes when serving because I wasn't sure about the peas in the recipe, but they added a nice flavor. Used a whole medium onion and doubled the garlic & onion powder as some reviewers have suggested.  Also added a little cayenne pepper for a touch of spicyness & liked the result. Last of all, I put too much salt in, so I made another 1/2 recipe of the sauce without salt to fix that & really enjoyed having the extra sauce in the dish. Will make it that way every time. I sliced the potatoes 1/4" and it did take an extra 1/2 hour to cook, even at 400 degrees. Will slice the potatoes thinner next time. Thanks for the great recipe!

It was fantastic! I did make one change for a thicker creamer sauce I used 1cup of heavy whipping cream and 1cup milk. The cheese I used a shredded blend which melted easier. I omitted the peas because I'm the only one who likes them. Great night dinner or to take to a potluck.

SOOOOO super easy. I used bacon instead of ham for a little crunch between the soft layers of cheesy potato goodness and forwent the peas (can't stand them), but the sauce was delicious.  I used half sharp cheddar/mild cheddar for a little bite. Will make again!

Not an experienced cook at all.  I actually hate cooking!  Tried this recipe tonight and it was delicious!  I followed the directions exactly.  Will definitely make again.
