Wonderful!  The overall flavor is varied and distinct because of the added spices.  To make this more "sloppy" I use 3/4 cup of porter or heinekin and 3/4 cup of water.  The brown sugar gives it a light sweet taste.  The onions and red peppers give it excellent texture.  If you like it hot, double the chili pepper or add some Aleppo pepper.  I serve it over sliced Tillamook cheddar cheese on large toasted hamburger buns.  I've made this numerous times and each time I love it more and more.

This is a really good basic sloppy joe recipe.  I made a couple of changes:  I halved the chili powder, increased the salt to 1 tsp., and added about 1/4 c. ketchup (to give it more of a tomato-base flavor).  With the chili powder and the pepper it had enough spice to satisfy without being too much!  A good recipe!  Thanks!

A nice recipe!  I made some changes and used ground turkey and 3/4 cup of beer instead of water for the liquid.  After simmering for 30 min or so you get a great taste!

Ultimate to-die-for sloppy joes on a winter night.  I've made this recipe for quite some time.  Every time I serve it for guests, I'm always asked for the recipe.  Ah....if only I could claim it!  Thank you for a great recipe.  Reading some reviews, sounds like there might be some taste differences going on.  That being said, I would recommend playing around with the chili powder, brown sugar and garlic.  My husband has had it several times with me and said tonight was one of the best.  I did keep the brown sugar as is, I put in two teaspoons of chili powder for our guests (instead of three/one tablespoon) and put in tons on garlic.  But then again, I'm one of those people who looked at the first initial 3 cloves of garlic and immediately doubled it!  One thing I've found through the years is the way garlic is presented into a dish. I used to mince it, but found a Pampered Chef garlic press at a party I can't live without.  Not only is it faster and easier than mincing, but it releases the juices of the garlic into your dishes (a tip for not only this dish, but others as well).  All in all, I obviously could go on about it.  I had a very particular person at my table tonight and he loved it, so I knew this was the ultimate score.  Thank again!!

Very Good Sloppy Joe Recipe!! We have been looking for a recipe to replace Manwich-I think we have found it. I will add a little more tomatoe paste and water next time-it was a little too dry. I will cut back on the sugar too, I thought it was fine but my daughter commented that it was good but too sweet. Hubby liked it and that's always a bonus!!

My one and only experience with sloppy joes was the awful canned stuff as a kid.  My husband has been bugging for years for me to make them and since this recipe was without ketchup, I figured I'd try it! Excellent results! My husband and his brother ate the whole pan (with a small bite for me).Will definitely make again!

I've made this recipe many times and my family LOVES it!!  To make this as easy as grabbing a can of Manwich, I make "spice packets" using snack-size zip lock bags and filling with garlic powder (instead of fresh), chili powder, paprika, cumin, brown sugar, oregano, salt, and pepper.  I make about 6 of these at time while all the spices are out.  I also stock the pantry with 6 cans of tomato paste.  Then, when I need a quick supper, I buy 1.5# hamburger or ground turkey, brown it up, add tomato paste, water, vinegar, and a "spice packet".  Sometimes, I brown the meat and stick it in the freezer to have on hand.  This is a super recipe and healthier than grabbing a can of Manwich!

First off, let me say that I used this recipe to make the best sloppy joes i had ever had last night.  Extremely tasty recipe, but I have a couple recommendations that people might find useful:
1) Start the onion and peppers in olive oil before adding the beef.  I know I didn't really like the idea of crunching in sloppy joes.  The veges take a while to soften the beef cooks fast, so I softened the veges before adding the beef.
2) Cut the brown sugar in half.  This is probably just a taste thing with me, but I thought it came out a little too sweet.
3) Add ketchup and redhot.  Again this is just my preference, but I thought the dish benefitted greatly from mixing in a healthy dose of ketchup and redhot.

Sorry!  This recipe sounded great...but way too sweet.  Red peppers add sweet and 3 tblsp brown sugar was way too much for my family.  If I did it again, I would start with less than 1 tblsp brown sugar and add to taste.

Great recipe! However Sloppy Joes II is a bit easier and just as good if not better. This recipe does have a different flavor that is a nice change from most sloppy joe recipes. It's not chili, that's for sure. It is definitely worth a try!!!

Way too much brown sugar, next time I will cut that portion in half at least. However, my 5 year old loved it. I think with some tinkering, this could be a good recipe.

This is the best recipe for Sloppy Joes I have ever found. I add some ketchup (about 1/3 cup or so) to cut down on the barbecue taste. I make this all the time now. Very good!

Not a "love it, but then" recipe.  It's Easy, delicious AS IS! I like the flavor better than Manwich or the packets of seasoning you can buy.  I omitted green/red pepper (family isn't a fan) and used plain tomato sauce instead of paste/water, and it turned out just as saucy.  Another time, I added 1 tsp of cinnamon, for another layer of flavor.  STILL THE BEST!

I am commenting on this recipe because it's so similar to how I make my Joes that  I feel I don't need to practically duplicate this by adding my own.  My differences were to add some chopped celery, I didn't use the cumin or garlic, and reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 tbsp.  Most of the rest of the ingredients were close enough for me to feel sure that they would replicate what would have been used in the school cafeteria where I first fell in love with sloppy joes!  The tomato paste is something I'm sure they would have used in a school kitchen to prepare so many servings.  Ketchup would have been too expensive and the ketchup based sauces that I've tried, taste too much like ketchup and that flavor is not what I remembered from my first taste experience.   The tomato paste along with the brown sugar, the chili powder and a little vinegar gave the sauce the basic flavor profile I was looking for.   The rest of the additions can vary to suit anyones ideal.  Thanks for this, it's perfect at it's heart!

I've tried many recipes but this is by far the best. It's great with ground beef, turkey or pork. This has been a big hit with my family and friends. I have even served it at chruch for potluck dinners.  The only thing I added was a teaspoon of mustard powder. When I've been out of tomato paste, I've substituted tomato sauce and it comes out just as good. Highly recommend this recipe.

VERY good!  Because of other reviewers' comments, I felt I should tweak it a little to make it less sweet and less thick.  I used an extra can of tomato paste and another cup of water, another half measure of the spices, original amt of vinegar, 2 Tblsp brown sugar instead of 3. I used a lower fat hamburger.  The original recipe amounts might be more on target if you're using a higher fat hamburger.  Nonetheless, it's a keeper.  I would think this would freeze great, too!

These sloppy joes are just like the ones that my grandma made before she moved down to Florida. Just the right amount of sweetness and spice. I like to eat them with cheese and tomato on them sometimes.

I used cider vinegar, and a bit less brown sugar than the recipe called for.  The recipe taste the way I wanted it to -- like Sloppy Joes!  My family and I liked this recipe very much.  My 22-month-old picked out the onions, but, other than that, it was a hit!

This is a great tangy/spicy recipe.  I found that I had to add an extra 2/3 cup water so it was too thick to simmer for the 10 minutes so the extra water cooked off after the 10 minutes.

I honestly did not care for this. I like the bold and spicy manwich sloppy joes and this tasted very sweet. Too sweet for my taste.

Delicious!! I only had 1 pound of ground beef, but used the recipe just the same and the joes turned out perfectly! Thanks for sharing this one!

My family loved the recipe thanks for posting it. I did take liberty to try it with the beer suggestion another poster mentioned and loved it even more(3/4 cup beer + 3/4 cup water).

The best after a few little changes...beer instead of water (I used Heineken), more tomato paste, half sugar, a half measure more of the spices, cider vinegar instead of white, and softened the onions and peppers before adding to beef.

I made this tonight as I couldn't find my regular recipe and scaled it to serve 10 as I had 2 pounds of ground meat and not 1 1/2.  I followed everything as it says, but it seemed like it was missing something.  I added some Worcestershire sauce and that helped some, but still lacked "something".  I liked it alright, but my kids weren't wild about it.  I figured out afterwards that I think it needed a squirt of mustard to make it "pop".  I will be going back to my family recipe next time, but did enjoy this for a change of pace.

I don't think I could ever go back to the canned sloppy joe mix after making this.  My mother and husband loved it!  Next time I'll probaby cut down a little bit on the peppers - one was more than enough and also cut the brown sugar to two tablespoons.  Delicious!!!!

Great Recipe - very easy to make.  Ground turkey worked well.  I would agree that it's a little sweet - next time I will cut the brown sugar to half or less.  The buns I used were on the sweet side also which may have accetentuated it.  I served it with a salad with blue cheese dressing which was a nice contrast. Definately a keeper - wonderful every-day dish!

Total hit with my family. Next time I will slightly decrease the sugar. I also increased the vinegar by about 1/2 ts and added a ts of worcestershire sauce.

At first I made the recipe as written.  It didn't taste quite right so I added 2 Tablespoons of ketchup.  It was better but I think the cumin and chili powder turned me off.  I will omit the chili powder next time and reduce the cumin.

This was pretty good. I was in a hurry so I didn't add the bell pepper or onion and I used 2 lbs of meat rather than the 1-1/2. After tasting it, I added a little more brown sugar. I felt like it was missing something, so I will probably use this as a base and adjust it as I go. I was happy to find this recipe since I somehow lost my package of sloppy Joe seasoning, had only tomato paste and already cooked the meat!

Nice little recipe!  I was in a huge hurry tho, so I left out the cumin and Chili pepper bc they were at the back of the spice shelf, lol.  I halved the water & added a 1/4 c. of molasses bc I like it sweet.  Next time, I'll do it right, but it was very good this way!

Both my fiance and I did not care for these at all. I defrosted 1 lb. of ground turkey this past weekend (intending to make these then), so I used that instead of the 1.5 lb. of beef called for (the missing 1/2 lb. didn't make a difference, IMHO). I pre-chopped my veggies too, so prep was extremely quick. If it weren't for these being too sweet, I might have awarded one more star. And boy are these S-W-E-E-T!!! Emily's recipe reminds me of sweet & sour beef (hmmm...). In all fairness, I didn't try any of the top reviewer's suggestions for improvement, so I can't be too critical.... I definitely think I could have used more liquid (doubling and replacing water w/ beer would have helped with that). My only other change was to top fresh kaiser rolls w/ a lg. heap of meat, sprinkle w/ shredded cheddar & then spread the "tops" w/ a generous slathering of softened butter (1 stick), smoked paprika (1/2 t) & garlic salt (1 t worth - my butter was unsalted, or else I would have used garlic powder). I wrapped ea. sandwich tightly w/ a double-thickness of aluminum foil & baked at 350 deg. for 30 min. My sandwich tops were nice & toasty (mmmm...)! My MIL "to be" does this when she makes her stromboli samies, so I thought I'd try w/ this too (why not???). For a quick, economical meal, I can't complain, but unfortunately I won't be repeating this again (my fiance might disown me - haha!). Thanks anyways. :-)

We love this recipe..so fresh and yummy compared to canned stuff!  I use ground turkey, but otherwise follow the recipe... I dont' really measure carefully though and so sometimes it is more spicy and sometimes more sweet, but always great! I disagree with the person who said this recipe doesn't taste like sloppy joe...unless you just prefer the canned kind!  This is a great recipe!

My son would eat this every day if I let him!  Found this recipe over a year ago, and if we have ground beef or turkey in the house (I've even make it with 3 grain tempeh) he get's mad if I make something else. I increase the vinegar and cut back a bit on the cumin and oregano, but that's just my taste.  Sometimes I have to add more tomato paste and water, or tomato sauce depending on how moist the meat is. We all love it, and it NEVER lasts! Thank You!

These were amazing! My husband and I both loved them! After he was done eating on the bun, he picked up a fork and ate just the meat! It was a tad too spicy for me - but I'm a weeny! I will make these again, with less chili powder. Thank you! thank you! for a great recipe!

This recipe was awesome and delicious. But I did add 2 8-ounce cans of tomato sauce instead of the water. Kind of made it a little more saucier. My 4 kids (ages 18 months, 8 yrs, 9 yrs, and 11 yrs old) loved it!!!!

Emily, I love this recipe as is! But as one tends to do, I played around with it and these are the changes I made. I used ground turkey, but would still use beef any day! I substituted 1 tablespoon of (Hungarian) paprika instead of 1 teaspoon, and I left out the cumin. That came to be by accident, but it worked out nicely. I decreased the brown sugar to 2 T and I used green pepper instead of red. I also used chicken stock/broth instead of water. I received raves both ways! Thanks for a really user friendly recipe!

This is my first review!  I couldn't keep quiet about this one.  This recipe is AWESOME!  I am always happier making something from scratch than from a can.  These are the best sloppy joes I've ever eaten!  My picky preschoolers even ate them, which is a miracle in itself.  I followed the recipe to a "T" and wouldn't change a thing!

I found this very bland after being cooked and I kept adding more to kick up the flavor.  I used a can of tomato paste and a can of diced tomatoes.  I found the recipe got very dry very fast.  It was a good simple meal and tasted much better after it was in a bun, but it wasn't my favorite.

Great recipe. I made a few changes. I left out the pepper, and cut back on the chili powder to 1 teaspoon. I also used Italian style tomato paste. They were really good. Joy Ballog

THIS HAS A VERY GOOD TASTE, ALTHOUGH A LITTLE SWEET. NEXT TIME I WILL REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF BROWN SUGAR.  IT IS MORE TIME-CONSUMING THAN STATED.

Very good - nice and thick, although it was a little too sweet for me.  Next time I'll reduce sugar to 2 tbs.

Just delicious!!!! I have been looking for a good sloppy joe recipe for a long time. THIS IS IT. I made a substitution because I'm on Weightwatchers. I used 1/2 ground turkey and 1/2 ground sirloin. I also added 1 tsp ground jalapeno pepper and substituted mexican oregano for the greek to give it a more authentic flavor. But even without these changes this is a great recipe!

I just tried the recipe, I got to say I really like it, the only thing I thought was a bit too much, a teaspoon of cumin, half would have done just fine. But other than that, it´s really good.

Family away this week so thought I'd try something new. This was a treat and very tasty. 3 small changes I added a poblano chili with the red pepper, smoked red paprika instead of cumin - not a cumin fan and I added 1/2 tsp of liquid smoke. Will definitely serve this again perhaps for our next Friday evening get together.

This was so good!  The comment about this tasting like chili worried me a little, but it doesn't taste like chili to me!  I love it!  Used green pepper instead of red.  I used 1 lb. of ground beef, so I tried to just use 2/3 of each ingredient - I'm sure I didn't get everything right exactly, but it is still really good!

Love this recipe!  The only changes I made was to use ground turkey instead of beef to make it more on the healthy side.  Honestly, it tasted the same as using ground beef.  Will definitely make again.

Go Emily! This doesn't come close to chili, whoever that moron is that said so. It does have a great sweetness and light and zesty kick. We made a double recipe and added some beer also. Serving on toasted buns with Cottage Fries and Homemade Bowtie Pasta Salad. Let's Eat! ;)

Made this last night.  The teenager and the husband both like it VERY much.  GREAT Sloppy Joe's.  Just watch the water - I used about half the amount called for.  I also grated the red bell pepper, onion and pressed the garlic.  Enjoy!

These were really good sloppy joes. I used 2 lbs. of ground turkey so I added extra of all of the spices etc. I also felt they were a little dry so I did addd some tomato sauce as well. Let them simmer for a while and the flavor was great!

Was good, but it seemed like it needed something, so I added a pinch of crushed cloves, a little ketchup, mustard, and a little bit extra vinigar.

I thought this turned out well! I used 2 lb.s of ground turkey in this recipe instead of ground beef. I also added a half a can of tomato sauce to the paste---as I don't really like the taste of the tomato paste by itself. I added 2 T of sweet relish, and a few drops of worcestershire sauce, and 1 T ketchup, and a little more garlic. The rest of the recipe I did not change--for some reason my sloppy joes did not seem to taste like chili as some other reviewers mentioned... (Had these on whole wheat buns as well.) Will make this again, thought it was good!

This was a good base recipe, though I changed a few things. It was very, very spicy, not too many people mentioned  this. We added about double the brown sugar. Also added a few cups of crushed tomatoes.

Definitely needed tweaking for personal taste. But, it was a great base recipe. I used less brown sugar, more vinegar, and added some worcheshire sauce. Quite good. I was panicking trying to find my envelope of Sloppy Joe mix, when it didn't appear, I was happy to find this recipe since I had all the items in my pantry. Thanks!

We loved this! My hubby loves SJ's and he raved. I did reduce the b. sugar to 2 teaspoons and added 1/4 c ketchup and I used Hungarian Paprika. I added saute'd mushrooms and used green pepper too. I also used a 12oz can of t. paste and a 10 oz can of puree because we like our SJ's sloppier than most because we eat them opened faced on toasted w/w buns. I jazed it up with a squirt of worchestershire and a splash of cooking sherry too. It was wonderfull and I will save this and use it again, thanks Emily

These Sloppy Joes are fabulous!  They have a great kick and are nice and thick (much easier to eat than the canned Sloppy Joes!).  I served them with Baked Beans II (on this website) and a salad.  It made for a fantastic casual dinner.  My boyfriend had 2 big sandwiches at one seating.  I would have, too, if I weren't so full.  Just remember to add the vinegar.  I almost forgot and thought it needed "something else" until I realized I hadn't added the vinegar.  It made all the difference in the world.

This is a keeper.  It is a little different than other sloppy joes, which is a good thing.  Like other have said, mine needed a little something extra in the flavor.  I made mine a little sweeter with a teaspoon more vinegar.  My husband loved them.

Not impressed at all.  I dumped in some BBQ sauce to salvage this.  I've had better Sloppy Joe sauce out of a can.  I let a couple of people try it as made by the recipe and we all agreed to add the BBQ sauce.  Sorry Emily.

Sorry, this is not what I expected. After test tasting it, I had to alter the flavor somehow.  Added ketchup, mustard, worchestshire sauce and then more ketchup. Enough was enough.  
I'll go back to my tried and true from scratch BBQ mix.

Even with the whole measurement of the chili powder, the meat is still bland, bland, bland... I had to put the whole can of a 12 oz. tomato paste, over 1 tsp. of salt, and add half a bottle of chili sauce just to make the taste right. It also dry... so I add more water, almost 1 cup. Just like one of the reviewer said, I just put 2 tbsp. of sugar.

I made this for our family later one night. Grandpa said - don't make any extra for me. When it was done it smelled so good, everyone had to try this, including grandpa. The sauce is so much better than manwich sauce! Grandpa ended up getting seconds! This is one great homemade sloppy joe mix. Will make this again.

I read the reviews and then tried them out. Yes, the recipe could be a little more 'sloppy' (fix that by adding more ketchup or water?), BUT still way better than the canned stuff. Add more chilli pepper if you like 'em hot (they came out pretty mild, which I personally like). Will make again because the guys who tried them loved them!

Emily’s Famous Sloppy Joes were delicious.  The onions and peppers called for in the recipe give it texture and taste while the chili powder provides spice.  There was a subtle sweetness to this sloppy joe (from the brown sugar).  This meal was quick and easy to prepare, but it easily managed to retain its “homemade” taste.  We put them on buns and ate them two nights in a row!  Yummy!

I omitted the onions and peppers because my husband doesn't care for them, and replaced the cumin with some extra chili powder.  I also added a dash of cayenne and a splash of tabasco and topped each sandwich with sharp chedder which I melted under the broiler.  Very good sandwiches that reheat very well--my husband took them to work for lunch for two days after we had them for dinner.  We will definitely have these again.

Wow! This tasted exactly like I remember sloppy joes tasting like. I added Rasberry Red Wine Vinager instead, and it transformed what I was starting to think was bolognaise sauce instantly into sloppy joes.

These sloppy joes were the best I've ever had!! My mom used to make joes from scratch, but not like this! Of course I love my moms' sloppy joes the most, but Emily's joes were awesome. I'm eating the leftovers as we speak! I have to confess though, I did add a little bit more water and a little bit of ketchup. But other than that, it was great! Sshhhh... Don't tell mom!

I thought this recipe was the best I have ever used and so very easy to make. I don't like the canned mix because it is too "sloppy" and this one is just perfect.  My family asked for seconds.

I always wanted to make Sloppy Joe's from scratch, now I can! We're used to having a sloppier sauce so I added a large can of tomatoe sauce, perfect! Buy day old buns to save even more $.

These are the best sloppy joes I've ever had!  I've made this recipe for several years now and when I make it I substitute ground turkey.  It is a hit with my family every time.  I've also made it for a teacher dinner once and it was well received.  I'm glad many others have generally rated this recipe so high.  Thank you to HBIC for posting it!

It's tastes like sloppy Joes when the cumin is left out. Since we don't like excessively sweet food, I cut the brown sugar and added a bit more vinegar for some tang.

I really like this recipe because there is no ketchup in it. To me, ketchup is a bit trashy to have in recipe unless it's in a dip or a spread. I've made used this recipe many times and the only thing I could suggest is to maybe only use 1 Tbp. of sugar. But if you like it the traditional sweet taste stick to the recipe.

I used ground turkey in this to make it healthier. I also left out the bell pepper b/c my hubby doesn't care for them. These were awesome! The sauce is very flavorful and thick so the Joes aren't too sloppy.

My husband and two kids really liked this and we don't often have sloppy joes.  I was trying to use up some leftover ingredients and this solved my problem -- I made substitutions -- I used 1/2 can of diced tomatoes and 1/4 cup catsup, rice vinegar instead of distilled white vinegar, and 1 and 1/2 roasted red peppers (from a jar) instead of the fresh red pepper.  I also used 11b instead of 1.5 lbs of ground beef.  I simmered it for a good 1/2 hour until it wasn't runny and the flavors came together really nicely.  We really liked this recipe, though I think the version I made was probably a little heavier on the vegetables, lighter on the meat.  It was great.

Delicious!  I started making these a couple years ago, when we got tired of the sloppy joe recipes with ketchup.  When we need a quick, no-brainer meal on a busy day, I often to resort to this.

For my tastes, this is a good base recipe--I like my sloppy joes spicy (with chili powder and cayenne pepper) but also a little sweet and very slightly tangy. In order to get what I want out of the recipe, I have to alter it quite a bit. For me, there is way too much tomato paste--I only use 2-3 tablespoons. In general, the spice combo is good, but I have to alter the amounts, and I add worcester sauce and a little mustard and a few other things. I still haven't gotten the perfect ratio for my tastes, but until I get my recipe perfected, I keep using this recipe as a general guideline.

These were very tasty. Because I prefer my sloppy joes a little sweeterm, I added some extra brown sugar.

Pretty darn good, with changes for what I had in the house.  I was out of bell pepper, so I used a can of diced tomatoes to add the veggie componant instead.  I also used cider vineager instead, and honey rather than sugar.  I served it in pita pockets since I was out of buns with a green salad.

Terrible it took me an additional 45 minutes to even get it close to tasting like sloppy joes. Way to sweet, too much brown sugar. I will never make this again.

This had great flavor. It was like having a bean-less chili in a bun, not your classic sloppy Joes, but good. The kids loved it.

My family has opposing veiwpoints as to how Sloppy Joes are supposed to taste.  This recipe seems to be a great compromise.  I prefer mine to be less on the sweet side and, since I cook, I tend to make them that way.  I accidently spilled a little extra vinegar into this batch and didn't add more sugar to compensate.  Next time I think I will be sure to just use the stated amount because I could have handled this being sweeter.  My 3-year-old ate hers with whole grain noodles and loved it.  She hates everything as of late so that is fantastic.  Her dad added ketchup to his and wished that it was sweeter.  I diced the peppers and onions very finely and added them as soon as I started to brown the ground turkey.  We used Aunt Millie's Fiber For Life buns and could practically call this health food.  I'll definetly be making this again.

The recipe itself was wonderful! Tasted a little too much like chili for me. Next time, I'd leave out some of the chili seasoning and maybe add some BBQ sauce or ketchup to sweeten it. Overall, was wonderful and will fix again

I made this for my daughter's birthday and everyone loved it. There was only enough left for maybe 2 or 3 more sandwiches. I followed the recipe and only made a couple small changes. I used my garlic press instead of minced garlic and I didn't have white vinegar so I used cider vinegar. I had to change the recipe to make 35 servings and it was absolutely delicious. I will definitely keep this recipe and make again. Thanks Emily for making everyone believe I can cook!

When I first began preparing this, I intended to leave the cumin out.  Frankly, I thought it seemed like a strange addition to sloppy joes.  I tasted it, and felt that it lacked something.  I was ready to review it rather negatively, citing its blandness.  I then decided it wasn't fair to slam it in a review without having actually prepared it as recommended.  I added the cumin, and to my surprise the flavors seemed to come together!  My son is a confirmed sloppy joe hater, and wouldn't taste it, but my husband and I both really enjoyed it.  Definitely a big improvement over Manwich!

I haven't had sloppy joes since..... wow, MANY years ago. My boyfriend told me he was craving them so I tried the recipe and it was great. The only changes I made was I doubled up on all spices (on chili powder I used a little over a 1/4 of a cup), I also added 4 squirts of ketchup and 2 tbsp of ALL SEASON. It was PERFECT!

Very, very good. I went a little bit lighter on the cumin, but kept everything else the same. We ate this with whole wheat buns, and while it's not the best sloppy joe recipe I've ever made, it's still very tasty.

This is a great casual meal. I cut down on the chili pepper. Also, I made the recipe for 4 servings and it only was enough for two sandwhiches. I probably could have stretched it to three.

I have been making this recipe for a year and am just now reviewing it.  It is the only sloppy joes we eat, I make it with two pounds of ground turkey but otherwise follow it exactly.  It tastes more like real food than the canned stuff, the garlic, cumin, oregano and chili pwder are wonderful.  Folks who call it bland should check the dates on their spices!

Originally rated years ago. My family (of 5 men) loved these. In the past I've always made Sloppy Joe's with store bought packaged spices or from a can. What a wonderful and delicious difference home made makes! Update: it's 2017 now and I am still making this for me and my hubby. Boys are grown and gone. Favorite part is now we're on salt restrictions and I control the sodium here!

We haven't had Sloppy Joes in such a long time. And when my fiance heard that I was going to make them, he got very excited. We only used about 2 cloves of garlic and it still seemed like too much. Next time we'll only use one. Sloppy Joes are great for my fiance because he is a sloppy eater and his name is Joe! He loves them!!

Both my hubby and I found this recipe great! A couple modifications but it was really tasty! 

-Instead of 3 tbsp of brown sugar I put 2
-added no cumin at all
-replaced the chili powder with Dante's hot sauce. 

We at the leftovers the next day! Thx!!

I did NOT like this recipe. It was too spicy (one tablespoon chili powder?!) and not at all tasty. I was very disappointed.

The flavor was nice but it was way to sweet.  Next time I will use only 1 TBSP of brown sugar. I also added a touch of red pepper to spice it up. I didn't have the hamburger buns but it worked great with whole wheat pita bread.

These were really good, but my husband liked the ones I made last time better. He said they taste a little mexicany. I think maybe a little bit from the cumin. I agree with others that these are pretty sweet, but I like them like that. I would like to make these again, but I know I won't since my husband wasn't crazy about them.

I followed the recipe exactly and thought it was way too sweet.  I added 2 Tbsp. vinegar and it seemed to balance the sweetness out, but the cumin flavor was really bizarre in a sloppy joe. My whole family requested that I NOT make this again.

I'm impressed with how much it actually tastes like store-bought "Sloppy Joe's"! Was a little sweet though and needed a kick. Kids didn't care for it as a result, but I'd make it again (and again) with minor modification: Reduce brown sugar to 2 Tbsp and increase chili powder to, say, 1 Tbsp. GREAT consistency!

Very Tangy and Excellent.... It did need a bit more salt than what the recipe called for, but it may be a personal preference.  I'll never buy the canned stuff again!  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

This recipe was pretty good.  I didn't have tomato paste so I used a can of tomato sauce and left out the water.  The red peppers were really good in this.  If I make it again I'll probally double the peppers they were so good.

Very good - better than any canned or dry mix and very easy.  I cut down on the sugar by half, and also only used half the chopped vegies called for.  Added a little more garlic (powder) and some red pepper flakes.  Will make this often!  Thank you Emily!

Most like sloppy joes we remember. Will add more vinegar, some catsup and a little more brown sugar next time.

This is a great Sloppy Joe recipe but I did add about a can of tomatoe sauce and extra sugar to give it a more “sloppy” consistency. My kids LOVED it so therefore.... I’d make it again!

These were easy to make.  I made them one evening when we all really wanted Sloppy Joes but I was out of store-bought seasoning.  I only used 1lb. of beef, and I omitted the red pepper because I didn't have one on hand.  I also omitted the salt.  I served them with a slice of raw green pepper on top.  These Joes were spicy, and didn't need salt at all.  If I were to make them again I would probably add the red pepper, use the correct amount of beef and omit or greatly reduce the brown sugar.  We all agreed they were too sweet (even my 10 y.o.)  and could really taste the sugar in them.

Add a tablespoon of mustard powder with the seasonings and you're gold. Top it with coconut spinach (search for it on  Post Punk Kitchen) and your mind will be blown.

I love sloppy Joe's but my husband hates ketchup so I found this recipe. What a waste... I should have known cause I usually cook on the fly and have a pretty good idea of how things will taste but I decided try this anyways. We hated it! It tasked like I just mixed tomato paste and chili powder together. I'm going to freeze it and use it to make chili next week so I don't have to throw it away. I would not use this for a sloppy Joe ever again.

Made just a couple of changes. I used a lb of ground beef and used 1/2 lb hot sausage in the tube. I also used a green bell pepper vs. a red pepper. Otherwise, the spices were just about right. Tasted fantastic, will definitely make again!!

I looked this up online because I forgot to buy Manwich. I thought it might be too spicy, but it was delicious. I added a big blob of prepared yellow mustard, some squeezes of catchup and extra vinegar and brown sugar. Yum!

INCREDIBLE !!!    This Is Not Your Momma's Sloppy Joe's !   This is a diverse flavor infused Sloppy Joe filling.   Ca-razy good...

In June 2013 I fist made these.  I was without speech they were so good.  So, I made more ...a lot more ... of these for a group of friends that came over, and people were coming back for seconds and thirds...  A smash hit.  zero left overs.  As far as I'm concerned...this is thee best Sloppy Joe filling to be had.   Should you love Sloppy Joe's...try Emily's and you'll be without speech too because they're so good.

One thing to keep in mind...it can be "watery" and may need some simmering to reduce it to the proper consistency/thickness that you prefer.

Came out perfect. Since I only used one pound of hamburger, I adjusted the serving size to 5, but used one whole 6 oz. can of tomato paste and extra water. I also upped the brown sugar just a tad. I didn't have cumin so I subbed seasoned salt and cut back on the plain salt.

This is one of my favorite sloppy joe recipes. I've tried Manwich and was completely disappointed. This does require a little tweaking-mainly the acidity to sweetness ratio...but once you figure it out, they're the pretty good!

This recipe was delicious. I pretty much followed it as is. The only ingredient I did not have was paprika. Also I used a can n a half of tomato sauce instead of paste/water.
I'm not one to use measuring spoons but eye all the ingredients. I think what makes this so good is the mixture of vinegar, chili powder and brown sugar. I whipped up a little extra to add to it!
Definitely better than manwich!

This recipe is very good for people who want something a little different from your average sloppy joes. It's much sweeter than what I'm used to, and, if you're not careful with the spices, it can get a bit out of control with the spiciness. I found that the brown sugar wasn't needed, the red peppers added enough sweetness! Also, the recipe called for twice as much water as I needed.
I recommend tweaking a few things because this suits a specific palate, but all in all, I enjoyed it!

I made this for our annual bonfire. I used 6 lbs of hamburger!  It was really delicious and I think the flavor was so different than any other recipes I've tried. I liked this one because it didn't call for catsup, which to me is way too sweet. Good job Emily!

These are amazing!  So much better than a can of manwich which my kids don't like.  But they really loved this and even had seconds.  I didn't have a red pepper on hand, so I omitted it.  They are usually expensive at our small town store so I don't buy them unless they are on sale.  I was short on energy and umph otherwise I would have added some grated carrots which would be a great way to hide a veggy.  Green peppers could also be used in place of the red or use both plus the carrots.  I often chop carrots in the food processor to tiny bits and then brown them with the onions before adding ground beef.  Adds a veggy bulk to the meal.....  Anywho we loved this.  I didn't measure the spices, just palmed them and it still turned out great!  I did make it a tad spicy which we prefer.  I did add a bit more water than stated on the recipe as well.  I didn't measure as I just added till what I felt was good using HOT water (190` from a water boiler we keep on the counter) not tap cool water. That may have made a difference as it evaporated sooner with the high heat of the pan.  But anywho we loved this and I'll be making it again with freshly made buns that I make almost daily for my family.

I am saving this recipe!  My husband loved it and said that it had the right balance of sweetness compared to mixes we have used.  We substituted ground turkey for the beef since we trying to eat healthier and it was great.

Sorry but I did not like the taste of this recipe.  I did not think that it was too sweet like others suggested but I did not think the spices went well together.  I ended up doctoring the whole thing.  Sorry

I tried it with ground turkey.  It turned out okay.  I didn't have to doctor the recipe to get the right consistancy.  My husband kind of liked it.  I'm just not sure if we're Sloppy Joe kind of people.

I thought this was okay.  It was a sweet sloppy joe, other than that not any great flavor.  It was easy and quick.  Will most likely make again when in a pinch.

I really enjoyed this recipe,though my husband and his 9 y.o. son both wanted the canned type back-both wanted more of the "ketchupy taste". I thought it was very yummy in that it was not so "kethupy". Oh well...vive la difference!

excellent recipe.The only thing I did different was leave out the oregano...with the cumin I didnt think it was needed.I think the next time I make these I will probably add a dash or two of hot sauce to spice it up even more!Thanks emily for a great recipe.

tasted good and leftovers worked well, but not too different from canned sloppy joe sauce...maybe more seasoning would've helped...but the peppers in it were great.

We really enjoyed these!  I also used tomato sauce (the one with Italian seasoning is good) and substituted green peppers because we prefer those.  I've made them twice and we enjoyed it even more when I followed some reviewers suggestion of half of the brown sugar.  Wonderful reheated the next day!

I didn't care for it, but all the guys at my house that night loved it. It is just not what I was looking for. I think I will stick with Manwich.

As much as I love spices - this one made me feel I was eating something wanting to be Indian - not like the sloppy joe's I grew up with - and was hoping for.
