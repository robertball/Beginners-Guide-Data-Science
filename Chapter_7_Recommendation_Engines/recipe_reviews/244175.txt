Great flavor. I poured it into a muffin tin with cupcake papers.

This is great as is, and with changes. I make this at least once a month, but have adapted it to my preferences. I used 1 cup of milk instead of 1 and 1/2, and I don't add any sugar. In addition to what's listed here, I add 1/4 cup steel cut oats, 1 tablespoon chia seeds, and 1/3 cup shredded coconut. If I have carrots on hand I shred some and add that as well, it reminds me of carrot cake when I do this. I also don't measure the chopped apple, i just chop one up and use it all. This is a great recipe, but don't be afraid to customize to your preference.

This was an amazing breakfast dish! My husband and all three kids devoured it. I used AlmondCoconut milk instead of cow's milk making it dairy free. I also used pecans instead of walnuts. I love the fact that it doesn't call for eggs. To get in our omega-3, I added 1 1/2 tablespoons of ground flax-chia seed blend. Also, I found this recipe is not overly sweet. It has the perfect amount of sugar for our taste. This will become part of our regular meal rotation. Fantastic!

We really enjoyed this because it was not too sweet. Perfect blend of spices. I subbed pecans for the walnuts because that is all I had. In the future I will add two beaten eggs to up the protein. Thanks for sharing!

This is SO GOOD!  I added a couple tablespoons of butter to the milk mixture, plumped up the cranberries with orange juice, and used toasted pecans.

Excellent. I didn't have cranberries, so added mixed frozen berries and added a little brown sugar on top to caramelize in the oven. We really enjoyed it -- even my wife who won't normally consider oatmeal for breakfast.

Loved it!  I quadrupled it because I have a 17yo son and 3 childcare toddlers who love oatmeal.  Put it into a 9x13" pan and baked it for 1 hour 15 minutes.  I used raisins for dried cranberries and chopped almonds for walnuts because that's what I had.  Otherwise followed the directions.  I added a dollop of vanilla yogurt on top but I think it tasted excellent as is.  Thank you so much for a great recipe.

Not having all the ingredients called for, I used 
Almond milk, crushed almonds, pumpkin spice, less brown sugar and  doubled the measurements. Served with whip cream.  Delicious!

Added extra chopped apple (a whole apple) and loved it!  Served with Greek yogurt on top. Yum!

I tried it because I had everything on hand and wanted something different for breakfast.  My husband and I loved it, and it has become one of our go to breakfasts.  It's easy to double when we have guests.
