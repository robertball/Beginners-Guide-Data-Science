Yep, this soup certainly earned its name...Awesome. I made the soup pretty close to how Michele stated, except I wanted a more hearty flavor. I am a pushover for beef stew and beef soups. I increased the amount of onion and used one the size of a softball, up'ed the garlic to 1 TBS minced, and I, being a chicken when it comes to hot food,  had to back off the horseradish and hot sauce. When I cooked the ground meat, I used turkey and tried to keep it in small chunks. For the water, I added beef broth; using water just wastes so much flavor potential, up'ed the carrots to about 4 peeled and medium diced,  1 cup rough chopped celery, I didn't do all the corn, and added 2 good sized bay leaves.  I served the soup in Sour Dough Bread Bowls from San Francisco.  I also had a round loaf of San Francisco Sour Dough Bread because I figured if anyone wanted crusty bread with their soup, they would have to eat their bowl and then what would we do for seconds. I am pulling out recipes for the chilly weather coming up and this one is certainly going to be in the repertoire. The soup is quite good and inexpensive to make which always helps. Next time I make the soup I am going to try adding some extra herbs. Depending on how you are going to serve the soup, sometimes you want a thick soup and sometimes you want a soup with more liquid. Just add more water or broth for a less thick soup. Spmetimes you just want more broth for dunking your crusty bread. Very enjoyable.

I followed this pretty close except I used beef broth instead of water, doubled the horseradish, and used canned vegetables because I couldn't find frozen mixed vegetables without nasty lima beans in it. I used one can each of diced carrots, green beans, and 1/2 can of corn. I even used a can of diced potatoes because I didn't feel like peeling/chopping potatoes. Since the vegetables were already tender I added them 45 minutes after soup simmered and continued to simmer about 20 minutes after that. Worked out great, nobody noticed that vegetables came from can. Everything else followed EXACT. Very good. Will definitely make again, but next time I want to add some of those tiny alphabet noodles.

I tried this one tonight.  The taste is awesome and it is very quick and easy to prepare.  I added a can of Rotel tomatoes, so I omitted the horseradish and hot pepper sauce. I used chicken broth in place of the water.  I also added some small elbow macaroni along with the potatoes. This is definitely a keeper!

We changed the preparation up considerably.  I don't really like to cook beef on a skillet before putting it into the pot.  I really prefer to have all of the ingredients cook together under one roof.  So, we used a Swiss beef steak.  I cut the fat off of it once thawed.  I then put it into the water, and added the rest of the ingredients.  I added some basil, oregano, and black pepper to it while cooking.  I then added some bell pepper, and cut down to 3 potatoes.  It turned out fantastic.

This was a big winner with my kids.  I changed it up a little by adding two dashes of Worcestershire and celery, didn't have canned tomatoes so I used tomato sauce.  I skipped the dill and added more garlic.  All bowls were licked clean!

This is a simple recipe.  I used beef broth instead of water.  It added a very dynamic flavor.

Really good and you can change according to taste.  The horseradish and cinnamon are not readily apparent, just back notes.  Be sure you really brown meat.
