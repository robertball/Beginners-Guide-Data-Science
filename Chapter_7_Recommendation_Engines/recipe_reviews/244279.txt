Made as written.  Excellent muffins. Don't change any of the ingredients; perfect as is. Time to bake was about 32 minutes. Top with a walnut before baking, yum.

I LOVED this muffin recipe.  So moist, and lovely!!!  I added chocolate chips to my batter and used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil and raw organic sugar cane instead of coconut sugar.  I was worried because the batter was very stiff before adding the mashed bananas.  It turned out so well!!!  Will be making this again and again!!!

Just ate one fresh from the oven, slathered with butter. Like others, I used coconut oil instead of vegetable, but that was the only change I made.   The only thing I wish I would have done differently is not use the muffin tin liners, because they stuck badly to the paper.   (I got 15 muffins out of the recipe). This is a great recipe.  They are very moist (the chia seed gel?), without the graininess or slimyness of some gluten-free baked goods. Thank you for submitting it.

These were good! They raised well, too! I added fresh blueberries (that needed to be eaten) and substituted 3/4 cup of the flour for quinoa flour, for added nutrition. The remaining 1 cup of flour, I used Bob's Red Mill 1 to 1 baking flour (which has xanthan gum in it).

I made these on Sunday, I’m keeping them in fridge so my husband and I can each take one to work everyday . They came out pretty great . I did however do a couple of changes because of my own personal preference and my experience with past gluten free recipes . I didn’t add an egg because I had none , I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil, the same amount of the recipe asked for but I think I’ll more next time if I don’t add the egg again , coconut oil adds so much moist to gluten free muffins. I also did not use any of sugar the recipe called for because I was using 4 real ripped bananas and I knew I was gonna add 1/2 cup chocolate chips. Sweetness was perfect , it tasted like banana bread . I will def make these again . It’s a great recipe and def a keeper . Thank you for sharing

Delicious! Instead of 1 3/4 GF flour I used 1 1/4 cup GF flour and 1/2 cup almond flour. And I used raspberry Greek yogurt instead of plain, just for fun. They had a ton of flavor and everyone, including everyone else who isn't GF, loved them. Thanks!

Excellent!  Cooked them late at night only to realize that I didn't have the yogurt -  so I used a duck egg that was in the fridge (much larger than a regular egg) and then added milk after everything had been blended until I figured the consistency was correct.  I also used the mini-muffin tins as they are my favorite. I will be making this again. Thanks.

These delicious muffins will warm the hearts of all muffin lovers. I substituted walnuts for mixed nuts, pepitas, sunflower nuts, slivered almonds, shaved coconut, peanuts, and walnuts. I also toasted this mixer before mixing it onto the batter.

This was AMAZING! I love how moist it is. I halved the recipe and used Greek yogurt. I reduced the sugar and added mini chocolate chips. Would make this a hundred more times - so very tasty!

I didn't have chia seed so I used ground flax seed. Not sure what it is added for. We loved these muffins and will make them again for sure. My husband loved them and didn't care that they were gf.

Great recipe! I did modify recipe slightly. Left out walnuts and added 2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp of nutmeg, and a dash of clove. Very moist and smelled amazing while baking. Great for the holiday season.

This is a great recipe!  Beautiful texture.  The only substitution I made was to switch out the vegetable oil for the coconut oil which I usually try to do when I bake.
