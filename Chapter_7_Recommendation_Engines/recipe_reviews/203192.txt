yea this recipe is from a cookbook and these were the measuremeants written in there but i tend to just throw all the spices together in a small bowl without measuring them, just until the chicken is well coated. i also like to add a bit of cajun seasoning. another tip, if the pan/chicken is looking a little dry, add a splash of water mixed with some more of the spices and that may help with the flavour too.

Less flavorful than I expected, although I didn't have five-spice powder available so I had to fudge around that.  I added sliced onions, and also heated up some frozen rice in the skillet after removing the chicken & vegetables, so the rice picked up the seasonings left behind. Will probably make again.

This is definantly not the 'Salt and Pepper Chicken' I had at my Chinese restaurant here in San Diego.  I am going to give it another try, but this time I am going to use only different kinds of pepper and the salt.    The  Chinese 5 Spice Powder might have been called for in this recipe, but I just feel it is the wrong spice.  That spice might go well with some other dishes, but not this one.

Great, easy recipe.  I used coarse black pepper, cut my chicken into bite sizes, and added sliced onion at the last 5 minutes of cooking.
I would suggest buying and using the 5 spice powder.  It gives it more flavor instead of just the pepper taste.  
 The second time I used strips of beef instead of chicken.

This was tasty. The spices got kind of a roasted edge to them from being cooked embedded into the chicken. I let it cook 5 minutes on each side, added in the veggies and the popped a lid on top. I'll make this again.. easy and healthy
