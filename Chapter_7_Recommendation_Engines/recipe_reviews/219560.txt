Add in some broccoli, mushrooms, and a pepper (red/yellow/orange) or two, and replace the Swanson's with House of Tsang Stir-Fry sauce (or Szechuan if you like it on the spicier side as I do) and you will be eating my go-to at-home date meal.  Goes great on some brown rice.

My husband and I both like this dish; cruncy veggies, nice flavor, and easy too.  We added pepper to taste.

I've been making this for quite awhile now & my family loves it.  I make Angle Hair Pasta & serve this over it.  It is so yummy!!  Sometimes I will stir fry cubed boneless cubed chicken breast first before the veggies. You could serve it with shrimp too.  YuMM!! My Grandkids have requested this from me. Enjoy!!

Easy and delicious!  You can use any combination of veggies to customize it. I used the Swanson chicken broth flavor packets and it was awesome and added a little minced garlic. Will make again!

I have a garden that that I always have extra veggies to use. Added green beans, red onion and zucchini fresh from the garden.  Had pre cooked chicken that I added with the broth. Served with brown rice.  Excellent.

I have been cooking this combination of vegetables for years but have always used a version of Italian Dressing to cook the vegetables in such as Newman's Own Italian or Kraft Zesty Italian instead of the Flavor Boost packet. Also in season, I would often add fresh cut up beefstake tomato's. It is a great side dish or as others have said, can also be eaten over rice as a very full meal. I will make it again and try the Flavor Boost method too!!

Oh my, this was fabulous!!  I took some advice from someone who said to add broccoli, and some colorful bell peppers, and mushrooms. I also put a bunch of shakes of soy sauce, about 1/2 cup or less of liquid vegetable broth, and a whole bunch of siracha sauce and WOW!!  This DEFINITELY goes into the rotation, at least for me when I donâ€™t have my kids!!

My veggies were not flavorful. Maybe I used the wrong type of broth
