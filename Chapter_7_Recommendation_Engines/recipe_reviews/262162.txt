I didn't have red pepper flakes so used Chipolte spice, used dry parsley flakes, didn't use onion, added zucchini slices.  I'm cooking at 9700 ft, altitude, it took about 20 min.  Beautiful, will do again, too salty..... maybe the added spice.  The zucchini was a great addition.

I didn't change a thing. Recipe is fire, will make it again. Lemon shines through... peppers and onion get flavored by the drizzle.  Definitely throwing this recipe into the salmon arsenal.

I made it according to the recipe and it was delicious! Really cold leftover on salad for lunch the next day, too.
