Excellent sauce, but I definitely omitted the butter and cut the olive oil in half! Otherwise you're looking at one greasy sauce.... I minced the carrot, celery and onion by giving it a whirl in a mini food processor and then sauteeing it all in the olive oil along with some minced garlic. I sauteed the beef, pork, veal (1 lb. each) and pancetta separately draining the grease. I then added that to the veggies. I then added 1 & 1/2 cups of beef broth, 1/2 cup of red wine, and a few splashes of balsamic and let that reduce (it takes a while). Plus, if you want it to look like the picture, I had to add a cup of half and half along with 2 & 1/2 cups of "personally prepared" tomato sauce and 6 oz. of tomato paste. You may also want to add some spices if you're using plain tomato sauce. I was liberal with the garlic and also added some salt and a bit of sugar to cut the acidity of the tomatoes. You really have to play with this a bit to get the desired flavor you want and it definitely needs to simmer for at lest 3 hours. But, when it's done - it's fabulous! We served it over penne pasta with a side of garlic bread and had plenty of leftovers!

While I agree with most everything in this recipe, if you are going to take this much time (as you should) to make a good ragu, you should reduce the meat several times with infusions of broth, balsamic vinegar, wine. Otherwise, he is right, real deal.

I would've given it a 5 because it was great. But only after my changes. How can there not be any seasonings added. Is this a given? I'm glad I tasted it before I let it simmer for 2.5 hrs. Taste it before you simmer it. I added 4 cloves of garlic (next time I will add it with the onion). I also added salt and pepper to taste.  Each time I stirred it it started tasting a little better, so I kept adding seasonings. I also added 2 bay leaves when I added the milk.  I'm not a big pork person, so I bought whole pieces instead of ground. I cut it up into little pieces. (obviously next time I will buy ground!). I also cut the butter and oil in half, as other people suggested. The meat has it's own oil.  But it turned out really tasty. Even better after I let it simmer.  Take my advice and taste it, that way you can add the seasonings before you let it simmer. If you add it after, it won't be as good.

This ragu recipe is outstanding.  I make it ahead and put in quart size bags in the freezer.  When I want a fast, authentic tasting, meaty spaghetti sauce I combine one quart sized frozen package of ragu and mix with my favorite jar sauce and serve over pasta.  I follow the recipe to the letter, mmmmm good!

Worked in an Italian restaurant for years and this Bolognese is light years ahead of the one we made. Next time, I will probably saute the pancetta, then the vegetables and finally the meats, draining them off as to get the full effect of the butter and the milk. I also will use vension as it is readily available to me. Mike, thanks for sharing this great recipe!

This is the BEST bolognese I have ever had!  I added 1 cup red wine after the meat was cooked and let that reduce. Then followed the recipe, with the addition of a whole 28oz can of crushed tomatoes, rather than the 2 cups called for.  Let it simmer away on the stove.  Served it over bow tie pasta with some garlic bread. The family LOVED it!  Next time, I will try this in the slow cooker, so I don't have to be around 2 1/2 hrs to stir it.  YUMMMMMMMMMM... you will not be disappointed! (P.S. as with any recipe make sure you taste and season accordingly to your family's preferences)

This was a great start to my own personalized sauce. I did not follow this recipe to the "T". I started with the basics and then went my own way. First, I used a meatloaf mix (pork, veal, beef) 1.4 pounds and then about another pound of beef. Instead of putting the meat in with the veg, I cooked them separately. I cooked off the veg in the stock pot, adding 5 cloves of garlic toward the end (before adding any meat or liquid).  I browned the meat, drained, returned to pan and added RED wine, broth and threw in a few tbsp of balsamic. I let this cook for about 10 minutes and then dumped it in the stock pot and added the milk and let simmer uncovered. I then added the pancetta to the pan where I had just cooked off the ground meat. I let the pancetta get brown, dumped that in the stock pot then deglazed with RED wine, broth tomato sauce and about 1 cup of the meat/veg mixture from the stock pot. I let this reduce down until the meat had absorbed all of the liquid and then added this to the stock pot.  All the while adding salt, pepper, italian seasonigs and a bit of paprika to both the stock and fry pans. After combined, I added more wine and the rest of the tomato sauce and let simmer covered. Amazing flavor. An didnt measure anything, just eyeballed it. Also used one large can of tomato sauce rather than just the 2 cups that was recommended in the recipe. I did use about a full stick of butter but very little olive oil. You always skim the oil off of the top prior to serving.

Time consuming and worth every minute of it! The complexity of flavor is exciting in every bite full. Few small changes...De-glazed the pan with 1 cup white wine after the meat had cooked through, used tomato paste instead of sauce, added just a few strokes of fresh grated nutmeg to the finished sauce.

Delicious Bolognese recipe. I have tried a dozen different Bolognese recipes over the past year or two and this definitely ranks near the top.  I agree with JLDELAP that it makes it even better to add wine and reduce a few times throughout the cooking process.  This was the first time I used balsamic in a Bolognese recipe, and I liked what it did to the sauce.  Lastly, I also mix in grated nutmeg at the end which also makes the sauce great.

This is a great sauce. Doubled the recipe and used it to make lasagna, a little pricey but worth it. I love to cook and I will definitely make this again.

I halved the recipe and wish I hadn't so I had more leftovers! Delicious and exactly what I was looking for.  I did change a few things per other suggestions. I only used beef (that's all I had) and infused the meat/veggie mix with about a tablespoon of balsamic vinegar, white wine, a little beef broth and the milk.  I let that boil down and then added the tomato sauce and the rest of the broth. Definitely let it simmer the amount of time given. Will make again!

This is the first time I have ever made Bolognese, I loved it!!! I made some homemade lasagna noodles and layered it with fresh Mozzarella and Ricotta. It was probably the best lasagna I have ever had. I will for sure make this again!!!!

It looks nice but no need of any butter, pancetta, pork, milk or broth and the thing that its missing is tomato paste.

Excellent sauce!!! My kids loved it. Very time consuming but well worth it. I followed the directions to the T while cooking. However, I made the sauce the day before and put it in the fridge. The next day I removed the fat which had solidified. Same great taste with a lot less fat. Served it over penne pasta. The kids request it often!

The flavor of this ragu was delicious, but I thought it was way too greasy. I didn't drain anything because I followed the recipe, but with a stick of butter, 1/2 c. oil and all of that meat, I should have.  Next time I make this, I'll cut the oil/butter by at least half.  I also added a small can of tomato paste because it was just too watery without it. Great flavor though, I'll definitely make again, just with some alterations.

Delicious! I took the suggestions of reducing with balsamic vinegar and wine several times and this turned out wonderfully.  The whole family (including baby and toddler) loved this.

Outstanding!  We all loved this.  I did a little balsamic during the reduction stage . . .before the milk . . .and also added about 1/2 cup heavy cream and reduced.   I did use some garlic.  I divided into thirds, added about 2 c. marinara to 1/3 and had the perfect amount for one box of rigatoni.  Everyone loved this!  Thx for the delicious recipe!

This was very good.  Ends up being pretty spendy, but the meat is so tender!  I used priscutto instead of pancetta. That was as close as I could find.  I wonder how much the taste would have changed if I had used pancetta?

My omnivore son has never had a taste for spaghetti & meat sauce until he tasted this...FABULOUS ! Not a hint of acidity and so easy.  (I did cheat and add a little garlic....I just couldn't help myself)

This was a nice basic sauce, a little bland for my taste, but the rest of the family adores it.  I have tons put away in the freezer for something fast but wholesome on those busy weekdays, so I am happy!

This is a recipe I’ve made dozens of times.  I look at recipes like the speed limit signs on Italian highways - they are just a suggestion.  Since taste is VERY subjective, I’ll tell you what works well in my home.  First, unless you are sautéing a dozen onions, all you need is about a tbs of butter and same of good olive oil.  You can always add a little more, sauteing the vegetables low, slow and separately from the meat.  (Since celery is a vegetable that will never cross my threshold, I don’t use it - in anything. I would never use an ingredient I don’t like in any recipe.)  This is also a recipe that, in my opinion, needs spices such a salt, pepper and garlic to taste.  Unless you like bland, this is a recipe that begs you to add your own seasonings.   Since I can rarely find veal in my market, I use mild Italian sausage.  I like the mild taste of fennel that the sausage gives the ragu.  I also use one pound each of beef, pork and sausage, several fat hunks of pancetta diced, draining well after browning, then combining with the vegetables.  That is when I have fun, adding red wine (I like Malbec) and good balsamic vinegar, reducing, and repeating this reduction process with wine/vinegar 3-4 times until I get the meat looking very saturated.  I then add the tomato sauce and beef stock - I pretty much eyeball the stock, as I do the wine and vinegar, and let  it simmer for several hours.  You can also put it in a slow cooker at this point and walk away.  I add heavy cream

Made it loved it and will definitely make it again. Followed the basic recipe might have made a few additions on the fly as I always do. Good sauce!

I just made this and it is really good. I do think that you can cut both the olive oil and butter in half and it will turn out just fine. I think I skimmed over a cup of fat off the top during the 2.5 hour cooking time. I also added seasoning to it. Salt, pepper, red pepper flakes, fresh basil and dried oregano to taste since there was no mention of seasoning in the recipe. I served it over zucchini noodles and the thick sauce was perfect. This is definitely one that I will keep and make again.

This recipe is super simple and delicious... once you make some modifications.  I agree with one of the other reviewers on being confused about why there were no instructions to season the meat/sauce.  Maybe it's assumed that the reader knows to do so... I ended up adding salt and pepper to taste while I browned the meat.  

I also made a few other modifications based on previous reviews: 1) added 1/2 cup red wine and cut down on the beef broth to 1-1/2 cups. 2) added a splash of balsamic vinegar. 3) omitted the butter. 4) added 2 tablespoons of tomato paste to add more of the red color back (the wine darkens it a bit) and to thicken the sauce.

I served this with homemade fettuccini pasta... delish!

Overall, this is a great base recipe for bolognese.  I did follow others and add garlic, thyme, basil, and oregano prior to simmering, as I prefer these flavors in red sauces.  A great suggestion was also to add nutmeg because of the sauce creaminess; I will add slightly more next time.  I am not quite sure why other chefs are making this sauce and then "cutting it" with jarred spaghetti sauce or marinara; the bolognese is a meaty, flavorful sauce that is meant to be eaten as is over a thick, hearty pasta!

I just got back from Italy, and was amazed at how different the sauce was there.  This recipe made a very authentic Ragu Bolognese, just like I had in Italy!

I didn't exactly follow the recipe to a "T", but this recipe gave me the framework for a staple in my home.  I don't use as much butter or oil, I use tomato paste instead of sauce, I use white wine and I added a pinch f nutmeg at the end....  It came out excellent, thanks entirely to this recipe.

Not exactly what I was expecting.  But I still gave it 4 stars because the flavor of the meat was great, it just needs something else before you put it over the pasta.  For the leftovers I will either add it to can spaghetti sauce like one commentator does, or add some tomato paste and tomato puree to thicken it up and really make it a "sauce" for the pasta.
