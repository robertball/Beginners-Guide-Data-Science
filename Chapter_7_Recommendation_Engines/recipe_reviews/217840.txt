Every Cuban restaurant in my area has stuffed potato balls, and this one really tastes authentic.  There definitely was a preparation learning curve for me as far as stuffing the potatoes. When I finished, I had left over bread crumbs, beef filling, and too many eggs.  I used a mashed potato scoop, cut the potatoes in half, stuffed one side with the meat, added the other side and squeezed it into a ball.  My potato balls needed more meat stuffing, and next time, I will add filling to each half, and then press together to seal the potato balls.  Also, in the future, I will start with 2 eggs, and 1 cup of bread crumbs; you always can add more if necessary.  On the positive side, they tasted wonderful, and I definitely will make again.  I made these 3 days ago, froze them, defrosted today, deep fried this evening, and they turned out great.  One thing the recipe doesn't mention is hot sauce, and these potato balls always are served with hot sauce on the side, so be sure to put your favorite hot sauce on the table.  Thanks alu1977, these are the real deal!

My wife said these came out great better than the ones from Porto's in Glendale. I added extra salt to the potatoes and semi-froze the meat in mini muffin pans then put two meat blobs together and covered in potato. Then rolled in egg and bread crumbs.

I followed the directions completely. Needed more salt in both the potato mixture as well as the meat.  Also to get the crumbly soft meat thats in the ones I'm used to I will cook the meet like I do for coney sauce in water then add the onion pepper mixture.  These were very labor intensive but well worth it.  YEA Dont have to order them online or make a trip to Florida!  Thanks

We don't use breadcrumbs, just roll the cale in egg. We also aff black olive slices and a small lengthways slice if boiled egg, quite traditional in Peru. Not sure about deep frying either, shallow oil is fine.

Our experiments show that the stickyness of the potatoes, i.e. the starch content is crucial. Old potatoes, that is ones that mash well are essential.

I loved this recipe! I tried it today and it came out delicious! I have to admit i did season my meat differently leaving out the cumin and tomato paste to make it more to our liking. But then end result was great! thank you for sharing your recipe!

Pretty darn good recipe. You are missing aji panca (It is a few thousand year old Andean, notably Peruvian, dish after all). Potatoes are from Peru, not Ireland.

In LatAm (mainland) we don't use bread crumbs (or bread for that matter) step 4 as written. I would think that to be a European addition. Cuban maybe? Not a bad thing. I know they use white [wheat based]breads and such. Fusion as they say.

Quite interesting and it looks delish! Keep up the good cooking!!

I tried this a while back and was very happy with the recipe.The only thing I did different was I used cheddar mashed potatoes that I had leftover after making perogies and found this recipe to use them up.Thanks for this recipe it was easy and tasty, a budget friendly fun dish.

Really good! I made a few minor changes. After adding the cube size potatoes to the water, I started sauteing the veggies with 1 tb of butter and 1 of oil.  I used very lean beef (90% lean) to avoid excessive liquid. In addition to the paste, I added 2 tbl of spaghetti sauce and I substituted 2 tbl of red wine for the vinegar. I also added a sprinkle of mestique and omitted the cumin because we're not big fans of the stuff. (For those of you that complained the beef was bland, just keep adding the spices until it tastes to your liking. It has to be very flavorful to compete with the blandness of the potatoes. Make sure potatoes are salty enough, too.) When the potatoes were mashed and cooled, I formed 1 THIN patty of mashed potato, put 2 BIG tb of beef in the center and covered it with another thin patty of potato. I then formed a ball, rolled it in the flour, egg (only use 2 eggs), and bread crumbs.  Oil must be VERY hot prior to putting the balls in. These are great to make ahead of time. When your ready, fry them and pop them in the oven @ 375 for 5 minutes. My husband and son LOVED them. And my Cuban parents were floored! Best compliment and well worth the effort. Gracias!

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars just for the yummy sound of the recipe as I have not tried it yet.  I do want to know if you could just mix the meat mixture with the potato mixture and then coat?

Since we are vegetarian, I used TVP and followed the directions.  Except I didn't refrigerate or freeze the balls, which may explain why they were more like squares.  Nevertheless, the family loved it!!

Very good recipe! I'm of Cuban descent, and totally forgot about this dish, until it popped up one day. My anglo husband calls it the perfect food, and would be happy to eat it everyday for the rest of his life. He's a little irritated that I waited until 25 years of marriage to spring it on him. lol

This was the first time I tried this recipe and it was spot on!!   Love love love it!   I tried my own recipe in the past and I ended up with greasy crumbled potato bites.  These held together nicely.  I used left over mashed potatoes and the meat was on point.  Great recipe.  Thanks

Made it for a second time and it did not disappoint.  Held together beautifully.   Love this recipe!!

I made it as the recipe stated. We enjoyed it very much. We do feel like the meat in side could be jazzed up a bit, but that would be personal preference. Over all it was easy to make, I made them the night before and fried them the next, and it came out perfect. I used a fry daddy and it was easy.

I made it exactly how it’s written. It took me a few potato balls to figure out how to avoid them from cracking while being fried. First, after the panko coating I let them rest innthe fridge for about 30 minutes. 

After a few of them cracked while frying, I decided to add more oil so that it almost covered the whole potato balls. More importantly, instead of  just letting them  fry  on one side then turning to brown the other side, I gently turned the potato ball every 5 seconds until all sides were cooked and all beautifully browned. They are so delicious.

I was surprised at how good looking they turned out.  However , they needed something to kick up the flavor level. Perhaps that is just me--potatoes are always a bit plain tasting to me.  I used some salsa on the side to add flavor. Next time, I will try to spice them up more.  In any case, it's an interesting way to cook potatoes.   PS: I used soy meat to make them vegetarian.

i love this recipe thank you! i have a suggestion if frying in a wok or pan: get a big spoon and gently ladle the hot oil on top of each one as it's frying :)) turned out great and it was a fun activity for my husband and i to make and enjoy.

Delish!! Making the potato balls took some skill. I had a lot of leftover meat but that was probably my fault for not filling them enough. I used ground turkey but the rest of the recipe was unchanged. I'd make these again.  They are a lot of work and are more of a special occasion dish for me. I made the balls 24 hour in advance and kept them in the fridge. I breaded them right before frying them.

I'm gna start by saying the flavoring of the meat with a little added salt is wonderful but this Potatoe mixture  is completely  off! Thilet Potatoe is supposed  to be more of a dough and the outside should be just a light coating of cornmeal.  This recipe  is OK but it is not what it should be.
