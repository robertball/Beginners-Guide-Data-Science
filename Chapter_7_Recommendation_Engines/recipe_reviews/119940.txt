I've made these for years. I do however, use the brown and serve dinner rolls in the aluminum pans. Remove all the rolls, leaving them together, slice in half, replace the bottom half back into the pan. "Brush" the butter, mustard sauce on the bottom half, then add shaved ham, shredded swiss cheese and "brush" the remainder of the butter, mustard sauce on the other half of the rolls (on the inside portion) replace the top half onto the sandwiches. Bake at 350 for 15-20, or until cheese is melted and the rolls are slightly brown. TASTEY!!! I have made these several times and taken them to potlucks etc. and they go fast! Oddly enough, they taste a bit like Krystals or White Castle burgers.

Fantastic!  Always get requests for this recipe.  I double or triple this recipe for a crowd, making little sandwiches from homemade dinner rolls.  I place them all on a large baking sheet and cover the baking sheet with foil instead of wrapping them individually.  I'm not a big fan of grocery store Swiss, so I often used other cheeses such as Fontina, Cheddar, Gruyere, American, etc.).  Oh, if you prefer to use fresh minced onion, just cook the butter, mustard, onions, and poppy seeds for a couple of minutes in a small saucepan - then proceed with the recipe as written.

Try adding worchestershire sauce to the ingredients that top these sandwiches. Gives a little boost to the flavor. You can use any type of sandwich meat and cheese as well. Great with a good bowl of homemade potato soup.

My family has been making these for as long as I can remember, so they're definitely comfort food for me. I almost always have some in the freezer. They're so tasty and sooo easy. We usually like to have them along with potato soup. Yum yum.

Wow!  These were really good and I'm not even a big fan of mustard!  My only complaint was 10 minutes was not nearly enough time in the oven, my sandwiches were still cold, however, I do keep my buns in the fridge.  I finished them off in the microwave.

These have become a regular in my house!  They have a wonderful deli-style steamed sandwich taste.  They're great to make for football games or other big gatherings, and making them on small dinner rolls is great for classier appetizers.  Different kinds of cheeses work great (pepper jack, provolone, etc.)  I started adding 1/2 tsp ranch seasoning to the mix - delicious!  My only tip is to wrap them tightly before putting in the oven, "squish" them with your hands afterward or all the cheese/sauce will run off the bun.

My co-worker makes these sandwiches and I love them so much! I requested them for an informal wedding shower she threw for me, and they were perfect. So easy to prepare ahead of time...and delicious!

I really loved these.  However, I did just the basic stuff.... ham, swiss, mustard and butter.  I used the ham from one that I baked a few nights ago.  Will definitley be making these again.

I get asked to make these for special occasions at work. My coworkers love them. Try having the ham shaved at the deli counter...makes a big difference! I use Munchee cheese instead of Swiss; just a personal preference.

I found this recipe when I had lots of deli ham left from a party. I filled a dozen buns that tasted fesh when reheated from frozen.

Easy and delicious. I used for my 1-yr-old's birthday (i.e. kids and adults) and the sandwiches disappeared. I also cooked them in a 9x13" glass or metal dish covered in foil till the last 5min and they turned out great. I used honey-mustard for half and dijon for the other half - both were yummy.

These were wonderful, and very easy!  My only thought would be to increase the time to 15-18 minutes.. 10 minutes barely made it warm really.

Delicious! I ran out of foil, so I baked them in a covered casserole dish. I used leftover Christmas ham. I used cheddar and added a spicy pickle to each sandwich, and a good time was had by all. Thanks for sharing!

A classy, gourmet style sandwhich that gets bonus points because it can be made ahead of time. It can also be microwaved instead of baked.  My only changes were real onions instead of dried and I only used 1 Tbsp. of poppyseed.

Really good!  I'm so glad I ran across this recipe.  It's nice and quick for a Friday night meal when I really don't want to cook.  Great flavor and easy to make.  I made extras to throw in the freezer for dinners on Friday nights!

My husband loved this recipe and he is such a picky eater. He keeps asking me to make it. I did make a few changes. Instead of minced onion I used onion powder and sprinkled it on.  I didn't use any poppy seeds since I didn't have any. I also added brown sugar to make it a little sweeter. Will probably be making this once a week.

I never thought I would give a 5-star rating to a ham sandwich, but by golly this is good!  I added a touch of minced garlic to the spread and it was delicious.  Easy to make, quick to prepare and loved by both kids and adults.  Thanks!

My family loves these simple yet tasty sandwiches, they are great for nice warm week night sandwich.  I usually use cooper sharp cheese, because the kids prefer that over swiss, but I love using baby swiss cheese for the adults!

Very similar to a recipe I've made for many years.  I use horseradish mustard, fresh chopped onion, shaved ham and Kaiser rolls, and bake for 20 minutes.  Always a big hit!

The spread for this sandwich was really unappetizing.  I didn't like the smell after I'd made it, but thought maybe once the sandwich had heated through, it might taste good but no it didn't.  Not for me, sorry.

Excellent flavor to these sandwiches! I love the crunch the poppy seed gives this. I don't even like onion, but I loved the taste it gave this sandwich. I was out of swiss so I used cheddar slices this time. I had to cook longer than 10 min though as the cheese was getting melty but the ham was still cool in the middle, so I nuked it for a few secs to finish heating it up. Such a great sandwich, thanks for the wonderful recipe!!!

Easy & tasty.  I have never been a mustard fan, but have been eating more things with mustard in them so I thought I'd give it a try & it was very good.  Fast too...I kept mine in longer than the time suggested too.

This is what I do with mine and they are delicious.
 
1. Use Sister Schubert rolls. Pop them out of the pan as a whole, slice in half lengthwise, and return to the foil pan.

2. Replace the minced onion with a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce.

I also use cheddar cheese, but use whatever you like. I follow the rest of the recipe as it's written. It's absolutely delicious...

This was so good!  I didn't have any dried onion so I used about a 1/4 cup of finely chopped fresh onion.  Also used a very good quality Black Forrest Ham - was so good I brought one for lunch at work and ended up eating it for breakfast :)

I have made these for many years. Great to serve for a luncheon. Either make on smaller dinner rolls such a potato rolls or man size Kaiser rolls..  Always a hit.

I used to make this receipe using the Pepperidge Farm Dinner Rolls, but apparently they aren't making the rolls anymore.  I will try with "slider" buns.

These are awesome! I used club rolls instead of hamburger style. I also used cheddar on some and swiss on others to satisfy the fam. I used more than 1 tablespoon and I also coated the top and bottom of the bun. Will make these again and again!

This is SO great! I've had it before lots of times with the sweet Hawaiian rolls & never thought of making a bigger version with regular hamburger buns! It worked out perfectly, thank you!

These were a quick and easy lunch!  I love the idea to pre-make them and freeze them.  Next time I will try a different cheese.

I'm going to give this 4 stars because my husband enjoyed it and I'd made these as a treat for him.  I thought they were just okay, nothing special.  I was expecting greasy but these were too greasy.  I liked the idea of toasting a sandwich this way though.  I'll use the method again but I think I'll experiment with different fillings to find something we all enjoy.

I was afraid it would taste too mustardy but surprisingly it doesn't.  Goes great with just about any savory sandwich filling.  This spread is great on breakfast sandwiches!  We've been doing bagel or flat bread fried egg, turkey-bacon, cheese, tomato (and jalepeno) sandwiches.   I usually use a mixture of spicy brown, dijon, and plain yellow mustards.  Poppy seeds are nice but not necessary towards the overall flavor.  You gotta use minced onion though.  Onion powder or fresh onion aren't quite the same.  I buy the big bottle of dried minced onions at Costco.

In the Carolinas, we use dinner rolls for the bread and call them Ham Delights....they go quick.

Men in particular can't stop eating them.

Wow, what a unique sandwich! The only thing I did differently was cut the minced onion amount in half and added an extra slice of cheese (my family is big cheese lovers).
