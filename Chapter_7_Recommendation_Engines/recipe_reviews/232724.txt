Very good! I used pecans rather than walnuts for two guests that don't like walnuts. But walnuts would be good too.

My family are not big fans of cranberry sauce so this seemed to be a nice alternative.. I made two changes. I forgot one of the two oranges and I only added 1 cup of sugar, was a little too bitter. I will add maybe another 1/2 cup of sugar or another sweetener. This would be great with turkey, pork, summer and winter. My vegetarian sister liked it with cucumbers.
