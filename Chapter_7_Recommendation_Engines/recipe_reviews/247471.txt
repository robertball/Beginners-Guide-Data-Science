This is an excellent gift for people who say they have everything. How easy is this? ...and so simple to put together. And it's vegan. :-) Thank you for the recipe!!

This was great! Especially for fun summer drinks. I used it for pina coladas and pineapple mojitos. I will definitely make it again!
