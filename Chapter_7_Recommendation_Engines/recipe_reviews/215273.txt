DELISH!  Made this today just as written.  I used my homemade chocolate buttercream icing to go with it.  My husband wants this cake for his birthday & any other time I'm looking to bake something.  "efzed", do you have any other treats that we might find scrumptious?

This is an acceptable cake, but not one I’ll make again given the other, extraordinary chocolate cake recipes on this site.  In addition to not being as dark chocolate as I assumed it would be, it wasn’t as moist or sweet as I would have liked either.  It cries out, then, for a sweet buttercream frosting.  I made this as cupcakes; a half recipe gave me 12 perfectly shaped and nicely rounded cupcakes. I frosted them with “Mint Buttercream Frosting with Dark Chocolate Glaze,” recipe also from this site. Edit 11-10-12: This was much improved simply by adding 1/4 c. more sugar and using strong, brewed coffee in place of the water.

So moist and delicious! The best dairy-free chocolate cake recipe I have tried. I substituted 1 cup of fresh brewed hot coffee for 1 out of the total 1 1/4 cups water. I heard that that was supposed to bring out the chocolate taste. 

Total recipe made 12 cupcakes and 1 9-inch cake pan. I would definitely make these again!

good, simple chocolate cake; easy, ingredients you must perforce have in your pantry, and you can't go wrong. It crecked a bit, so I got it out of the oven early and the centre was nicely fudgy

This recipe turned out amazingly. I made it for a friend's birthday since she's got a dairy allergy. It made 15 large cupcakes. They were light, fluffy and moist. It is definitely going on my regular cake rotation.  (I topped them with chocolate icing sugar made with soy milk)

Great recipe! I modified it to include healthier options so I feel good about letting my kids indulge. My mods are: organic coconut oil, organic sprouted wheat flour, organic cane sugar, organic coconut sugar AND I puréed 2 enormous handfuls of organic spinach to give it some extra moisture and vitamins. These silly kids didn't even know what they were really eating!

My first homemade cake. I had taken a simple cake and made a few mistakes. I had to give this a five star, because knowing now I was the one that made a few mistakes, it would have turned out more moist. I didn't use veg. oil, and I won't again. I used cal. oil, so less fat, might have been a problem. Next time I will add more real butter. I beat it by hand, next time I will use a hand mixer. I used a bundt pan (I love the look of bundt cakes) so by using a bundt pan with the thickness, I had to cook it a little longer. It wasn't real dry, just a touch. Everyone loved it. However, me wanted everything just right. I did top it with a buttercream chocolate frosting, and topped it with pecans. I'm looking forward to getting this just right the next time. My first homemade cake! not to bad....live and learn.

A very good recipe. I added chocolate chips to it as well which worked out very nicely. It gave it a nice little "surprise".

I loved this! It was so moist and is definitely a keeper. My whole family loved this cake. It was also really easy to make. It wasn't too sweet. I was really excited about how this turned out because you never know with home-made cakes. I strongly recommend making this cake for any occasion.  I love the flavor! They taste amazing even without frosting!

I did like one review said and added 1/4 c more sugar and replaced the water with coffee. The mixture almost seemed too runny but it cooked up deliciously!!!

Very nice simple chocolate cake recipe. I made it quickly with things I already had on hand. I did not have time to make the eggs "room temperature" and I used a whisk instead of an electric mixer. It turned out great!

I LOVE THIS RECIPE!! I usually don't like chocolate cake but I had a craving today and I found this recipe. I followed it exactly and the result was amazing, moist, perfect amount of sweetness and the flavor was so good! I made cupcakes instead and it took about 15 minutes at 350. I made the first two batches just with the batter and the last batch I crushed up graham crackers and sprinkled it on top with mini marshmallows in the center, PLEASE TRY IT! :)

I substituted apple juice for the water and followed the directions perfectly.  I cooked it in a very well greased bundt pan for 37 minutes, dumped it out immediately and cooled it in the freezer.  It came out perfectly!  The texture of this cake is amazing!  My family loved it.  Next time I make this I'm going to try adding some orange zest for even more depth of flavor.

Awesome. I've made it as a cake and as cupcakes. For  24 cupcakes bake at 350 for 20 min. I like to sprinkle powdered sugar on top once they have cooled, it makes for a nice finish.

My little one is deathly allergic to dairy products. This recipe is now a regular at family birthday parties. It's amazingly delicious and easy to make, comes out perfect and moist every time. Thank you for such a great recipe!

A good-tasting, moist, milk-free chocolate cake.  However it did not rise quite as much as I would have expected but fine for a double-layer cake you plan to frost.  (I had to make it milk-free so found a frosting recipe online that used coconut oil as the base.)

I used melted butter in place of the oil. This cake is rich and moist. (My only concern was how hard it was not to eat the batter before I added the eggs. It was like fudge. Mmmm.)

This is a nice moist cake. I halved the recipe, because I only wanted one cake and used only one egg. It was slightly on the denser side, but maybe the egg ratio was off. Overall, very yummy and easy to make. I topped it with some cream cheese frosting. Thanks!

Had to tweak just a little for high altitude adjustments.  The cake is delicious and moist.  This one doesn't even need frosting, amazing as is and will definitely be a keeper to make over and over again.  The chocolate flavor was intense which is exactly what I want in a cake.  thank you for sharing the recipe.

This was a surprisingly GOOD chocolate cake I will definitely make again! I really wanted cake to go with my ice cream and I did not have a cake mix. I decided to take a chance on this recipe, because I had all of the ingredients already in the house, unlike other recipes I browsed. The batter looked super thin so I was unsure of how it would turn out, but I had no need to worry! It is very moist and very tasty! I will probably even make this recipe instead of using the boxed mixes as I usually do. It's really easy to put together as well, no special skills necessary!

New go-to chocolate cake recipe, way better than the box and so easy to make! My son loved his birthday cake, it was extra special for his extra special 10th birthday.  I did double the baking soda just because I like a really "big" layer cake and replaced the water with hot coffee.  I used an Ethiopian blend k-cup that was a perfect complement.

This is my go-to chocolate cake recipe. It is rich, moist and delicious. However, I would recommend using dark cocoa powder instead of regular one for a richer, more chocolaty taste. It made it a lot more delicious.

This is a wonderful cake! It is moist, rich, with a nice texture and it is super easy to make. I think it is even better on day two. I used a dark cocoa, 1 tsp of espresso powder, and coconut oil for the vegetable oil. I am sure I will make it again - thank you!

Easy and delicious! I baked it for about 30 minutes in a 9x13 pan. It is moist and sweet and doesn't need frosting.

These make the most beautiful cupcakes!  fill 3/4 full & cook per directions & they are perfect.  Also a lovely, tasty, moist chocolate cake...not sure why some think it isn't sweet enough, it's perfect as is, if you need sweeter, ice it!  We used Martha Stewart's caramel buttercream to frost ours...yummy, but I'll try something different next time!
