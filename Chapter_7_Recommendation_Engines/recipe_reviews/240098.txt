I really like this sauce especially on my roast beef sandwiches. It's got a bit of a kick and stands up well to the beef.

Awesome is right! This went perfect on tri tip. The consistency of this sauce will go great on burgers. Just the right amount of heat from the chipotle pepper. A keeper that will be used as a topping or for dipping.
