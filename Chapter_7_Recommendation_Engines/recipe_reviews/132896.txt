Fast and easy.  I added 1/4 jalapino to give it just a bit of heat. I will next time stir in the cilantro just before serving.

Very good and easy recipe.  The only changes I made were used beef broth, cause that is all I had and used Rotel instead of diced tomatoes.  YUM!

I used Rotel instead of plain diced tomatoes - the green chiles give it a little extra kick. I also added a good shake of garlic powder and cumin. Perfect!

Not bad.  As others recommended I used diced tomatoes w/ green chiles, I added a spoonful of tomato paste to boost the tomato flavor, vegetable broth (to make it vegetarian), a dash of cumin and a little chili powder.  It was more flavorful this way and I would probably make this again for a quick throw together side dish.  Made it as an accompaniment to the Delicious Black Bean Burrito recipe from this site, which I highly recommend.

Very good recipe. The only thing I did different was instead of the tomatoes I used a can of ROTEL Chili Fixin's for a little extra zing.

Thank you mjhutch for this recipe. I tried other rice recipes on this site, but since I'm a cooking know-nothing, I screwed 2 of them up. This one, though was by far the easiest. Following the super-easy instructions my rice came out perfect! (I used the instant white rice like the recipe asked for. I also added the cilantro at the very end, like someone else suggested.)

Next time I made this I altered the recipe as follows: added 1 small can of diced jalapenos and some fresh cut corn kernels, to the rice- tomatoes-broth mix. Then about 1/2 way through the simmering I added 1 cut zucchini. (I added the zucchini late to keep their color and crunchy texture.) This tasted so good and made it so hearty, almost a meal in itself.

Being Mexican (that's why I added the japalenos), I know Spanish Rice, and this is among the best I've had! Now everyone is asking me about the recipe and even my mom can't believe I made a spanish rice better than hers! Rename it "Best Spanish Rice!"

This turned out so much better than I thought with instant rice.  Very easy and simple recipe that you can add anything to, and it would still taste great.  I am at a high altitude so I did add a little extra chicken broth and let it cook a little longer and I added some green chilis. Excellent!

Nice recipe! I added homemade very low sodium taco seasoning, red bell peppers, fresh corn, peas and an extra cup of water because I used regular long grain rice. My canned tomatoes were sodium free and I used veggie broth because I am vegan. My family loved it!

This was a great recipe. Fast and easy. I added fresh diced red bell pepper in with the onions and used a can of diced tomatoes with green chilies. Also added a dash of garlic powder, salt, pepper, chili powder and cumin.

Just made this tonight.  My husband and I both LOVED it!  I used beef broth (was out of chicken) & diced tomatoes w/ green chiles.  Everything else I did the same.  This is now our FAVE rice dish...gonna be our new go to side.

This is tasty! I've made one other version, and so far this is my favorite. Not too much going on, but just enough flavor. I think I should have cooked it a little bit longer, because the rice was a little bit undercooked. Other than that it was great!

It was easy to make. I followed another reviewer's idea of using tomato paste with equal amount of water. I added some beef boullion, cumin, chili and garlic. I forgot to add the cilantro but added can of green chili and a can of drained corn. We enjoyed it and happy it was easy to make!

It was fantastic!  I did 2 bags of boil in bag rice with 15 oz chicken broth, 1 can of drained corn and topped with Mozzarella Cheese.  My husband loves rice, but my kids and I don't usually care for it.  Both of my children asked for seconds, my husband said it was the best ever, and I actually enjoyed it!

Pretty good but not spicey enough for my husband.  I added a can of green chilis to spice it up a bit and followed the directions for cumin, etc.  It was okay.

This rice is good it's the second time I made it. The first time I made it as stated and it was fine but a little bland. This time I used canned tomatoes with the green chiles and subbed water for the chicken broth (didn't actually have broth). I also added a green bell peppers with the onion to sautée. I added some salt pepper and a little chili powder and cumin to the liquid. Once it boiled I added the rice and let it simmer on low for maybe a min then added some cilantro and took it off the heat. It's instant rice so it doesn't need to be simmered. Turned out better this time but still a little bland for my taste. My boyfriend doesn't like a lot of heat so this adjustments were just right for him. I'd def add japalenos and more spice if you want more heat.

I make this a lot for my family especially when we have taco night. Ever since I tried this recipe I love it and prefer it than other Spanish rice recipes. I'm a big fan of cilantro so adding more taste amazing.

Great recipe.  I too used a can of diced tomatoes with green chiles. I also added in diced green bell pepper with the onion, and a teaspoon each of cumin and chili powder. I didn't have cilantro, but it wasn't missed. So much better than Spanish rice from a box!

This is the best Spanish rice I've had. I used 3/4 can of diced tomatoes and 1/2 a can of chopped green chilies because I didn't have Rotel.  I loved the flavor.  My husband thought it could use some salt.

Well is it enough to say there was nothing left in the serving dish at the end of the meal?  Added the cilantro two or three minutes before the dish was ready to preserve that fresh cilantro flavor. Complimented the Salsa Chicken" recipe very nicely.  This will be a family favorite side for any Spanish or Mexican main dish.

Yum! It looked too simple, but it is great. I made with brown rice and a jar of homemade spaghetti sauce, plus garlic powder, and it was terrific - and fast!

This was very delicious. I forgot to add the cilantro (despite that being the reason I decided to make this in the first place) and it was still tasty. I used Rotel based on other reviews. Next time I will make sure to add the cilantro! I also may play around with adding cumin or habaneros to give another layer of flavor.
