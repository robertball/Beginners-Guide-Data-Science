I don't know why more people haven't tried this recipe - these cookies are AMAZING! I followed the recipe exactly except that my dough was only chilled for about 2 hours and it was fine. I got about 30 cookies out of the recipe, although if you made them smaller I can where you could a lot more than that. Be careful when taking them off of the cookie sheet, they're pretty fragile while still warm. I made a bunch to give away as part of my x-mas baking packages.

The dough was easy enough to mix together. When I melted the chocolate in the double boiler, I added a little hot
coffee(about a tbsp.)and another tbsp. of coffee granules, just to soften it up and give it more of a coffee charge. I also added a little vanilla to the dough when I added the egg. It smells amazing.
It's firming up in the fridge now. I plan on using the Mocha Icing from this site instead of the one called for here, as I don't have any chocolate chips. I'll update how they are once I make them. UPDATED: VERY GOOD. The Mocha Icing really completes these cookies. They taste like something you'd buy from a professional bakery. I'll make these again for sure, only next time I'd cut the cinnamon in half.

Very tasty!  I omitted the water, and changed the chocolate to 6 T. cocoa.  I frosted the cookies with melted white chocolate mixed with 2 T. finely crushed instant coffee. We will be making these again!

Very tasty! I made 1/2 a recipe and got 40 cookies that baked in 10 minutes on Silpat lined sheets. I added a tsp vanilla and used cocoa powder for the unsweetened square as I didn't have any. We really enjoyed them but I think I would reduce the cinnamon more as it overshadowed the coffee, or double the coffee.

Very nice change of cookie.  I forgot (!) the brown sugar so mixed it in with the dough, and they still turned out well.  Seems like there are 2 identical recipes on this site, both called Cappuccino Flats.

I'm hard pressed to know exactly what I felt about these cookies.  First of all, they baked up very nicely, and that's a plus.  But the flavor confused me, and to my mind the flavors conflicted.  You have chocolate, coffee and cinnamon all vying with each other, and I wasn't sure exactly what the flavor was.  Nevertheless, my husband and I have been eating them happily.  I wanted to try these for a long time, I'm glad I did, but I don't think I'll be making them again.

These look beautiful and would be a nice addition to a Christmas cookie tray, however, my kids didn't care for them that much.  I think are not very kid friendly but adults would like them.

My Mom thought they tasted professional - the type you would package and give as gifts.  They were very professional looking and presentable.  I prefer softer cookies.  You can definitely taste the coffee flavor.

I had a mix review from friends and family.  The coffee flavor was not strong enough.  Maybe using espresso powder would be better.  They were pretty though....but I wouldn't make again.
