I make this recipe all the time with a few changes for personal taste.  I use ground turkey or lean beef and I add the green chilies right into the filling mixture. I also add some mushrooms and green pepper for some extra vegetables and put olives on top!  A little salsa and sour cream on the side and it's a hit everytime! I have had requests for the recipe and to make it again! It different and fun and people can add their own topping to make it just how they like it.

I love this recipe. The only thing I do different is that I add some of the cheese to the sausage mixture before stuffing the shells.

O I have to be honest i did not follow the recipe very well! I changed it LOTS! I did not use pork since i am a vegitarian. I had some left over ref. bean i had made from scratch i doubled the amount in the recipe added about 1/4 -1/2 c enchilla sauce i had made.( the mole one from on this site)  also about 1/2 cup mixed tomato sauce and diced tomatos( could have added a bit more diced) then i added sliced olives the green chilies and used both Motzarella and cheddar. i then coved it with a thin layer of the enchillada sauce... it was amazing will make many more times!

I used sliced turkey sausage and black beans.  It was pretty quick and easy to make.

This came out pretty good. I enjoyed it and my friends really enjoyed it. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is I think it could use some more spices, like garlic salt. I also think it would be better with cheese inside of them as well. I think it would be better with less beans, but I just don't like a whole whole lot of refried beans.

This was a great recipe! The only thing I decided to change up a bit was, I added a can of black beans to the mix, and I added half a can of enchilada sauce to the tomato sauce.
