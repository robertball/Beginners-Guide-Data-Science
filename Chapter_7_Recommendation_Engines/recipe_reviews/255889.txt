I've made these simply with 2 ripe bananas, 1/2 c of almond butter and 2 c of oats with vanilla, sea salt and cinnamon added. They're healthy but not fat free. Any nut butter will contain fat. I like to add a 1/4 c of mini chocolate chips or raisins too but I'm not vegan.

Easy to make. Not crunchy, more like banana bread.
