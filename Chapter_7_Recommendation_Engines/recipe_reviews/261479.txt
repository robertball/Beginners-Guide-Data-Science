Realtorloves2cook, you realize that the beauty of the original recipe is that it takes FOUR ingredients to make it. You made a different recipe!

Delicious!! I make a similar dish with Shrimp and Bok Choy instead of chicken, so I modified this recipe based on what I had on hand and what I knew would brighten the dish up just a bit more. I did the following: Seasoned the chicken chunks with salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, red pepper flakes and a dash of cumin. Let that sit for about 30 mins to marinate. After browning the chicken and removing it from the pan, I added a bit more coconut oil, another dash of cumin and turmeric, yellow onion, red and green bell peppers, and a few cloves of chopped garlic - sauteed that all for about 2 mins, then added Thai Red Curry PASTE, about 2 heaping teaspoonfuls and sauteed that that all together for another 2-3 minutes on low to medium heat to bring out all the flavors. I then added 1 can of coconut cream and 1 can of coconut milk (the 1 can of coconut cream was nowhere near enough sauce) I let all of that come back up to a simmer. Meanwhile, I had some broccoli steaming in another pot, which I added in the pan with the rest of the ingredients when I added the chicken back in, and cooked everything together for another 3-5 mins. I turned off the heat and added in the chopped cilantro, green onion and a squeeze of lime. I omitted the noodles altogether. It was SOOOOO good served over white basmati rice!!!

I made it with Thai coconut cream  rather than Coco Lopez cream of coconut. It was excellent. I think it would have been fine either way.

I've made this recipe before for my girls at work they didn't seem to enjoy like last before maybe it was just an off night . I like that it is easy to prepare and doesn't take much ingredients. I work for a group home so cost is important

It was delicioso.  I used key lime yogurt,  I did not chopped the cauliflower, i speared the flowers the large ones I cut it in half  , i did not want mash.  Also after they were  roasted I took them out to cook the onion and garlic until golden, then, I added curry and cumin to release the flavor, then I added back the cauliflower and follow the rest of the recipe.
I invited a couple to come and have lunch with me after church they loved it also.  I will make it again and again.   Thank your for a lovely and delicioso recipe.

Remarkably good for only these few ingredients.  Serve over rice for a quick and healthy meal (I prefer to add some cayenne).

Very simple recipe! I added onions and peppers to the recipe. I have made similar recipes that are more advanced. Very good base recipe.

This was delicious and very quick to make. My grocery store didnâ€™t have any red curry paste so I substituted green curry. I also added some red and green pepper for some veggies. Yum!

This was fast and tasty, and easily adaptable for when you have some assorted produce in the house that needs to get used up.

Pretty awesome, especially for a four ingredient recipe! I added garlic to the chicken when cooking and green bell pepper for our veggies. Added a pinch of garam masala, ginger, and cumin and topped with lots of green onion and cilantro. It was still a bit too sweet for us, so next time we will add more salty flavor and more veggies.

This was good. I added some broccoli for color and some veggies. I added several spices and some sesame oil while sauteing the chicken to give the meat a bit more flavor. I used a thicker rice noodle and it worked well. Be careful not to overcook the rice noodles as they can get gummy quickly.

We LOVED this simple and delicious recipe! I used 2 pounds of chicken, but kept the rest of the ingredients the same, and there was still plenty of sauce. I had the Trader Joe's Coconut Cream on hand and used House of Tsang brand red curry sauce, which was delicious! I served this over Basmati rice and topped it with cilantro (for me and the girls), green onios and a sqirt of lime ~YUM, YUM, YUM!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)
