2.17.17   I’d recommend that you blend the hummus and then add the reserved bean liquid “as necessary.”  I didn’t need the full 1/4 cup and had I added it all at the start, my hummus texture would have been too thin.  Made as written with the exception of the comment above, tasted it, and found the flavor weak with  no “heat” at all from the curry powder or paste.  I added Sriracha, more lime juice and tahini, and some garlic powder.  If I make this again, I’ll cut back on the amount of the cilantro, as I thought it sent the curry flavor to the background and made this hummus almost look like guacamole.  This turned out OK, but came up a bit short for us in comparison with other hummus recipes on this site.  Landon, thanks for sharing your recipe, it’s nice that you state this is a base recipe and encourage customization to suit one’s taste.

A little bland as is but the texture was perfect. I used my immersion blender and the carafe it came with. I had red curry paste instead of green so I tripled the amount of curry paste and curry powder and it tasted much better. An easy snack to whip up and use up some leftover curry paste!
