These were exceptional!  I made a few substitutions mostly because it was what I had on hand.  I used raspberry fat-free yogurt instead of peach; almond extract instead of vanilla; fat free half and half instead of milk; fresh peaches that I had frozen last summer, thawed and drained; 1/2 c. oat bran substituted for 1/2 c. flour.  Next time I will add some nutmeg and use egg beaters.  My diabetic hubby loves them!

Appeared to be a tasty muffin but lacked the richness I was expecting. I liked the accent of blueberry and peach but thought the muffin was a bit dry.

I'm not a big fan of peach, but it mixes well with the blueberries.  Moist, not overly sweet.

These muffins taste better with some sour cream. I wish it called for less butter...

Hey,Ya'll,we loved the peach and blueberry combo. Since fat is an issue with my hubby. I used 1/2 Egg Beaters for the 2 eggs and  1/2 cup unsweeted applesauce (have used yogurt)  for the 1/2 butter. Was moist muffin.

I liked the blueberry and peaches together. It was a bit strange to see the muffin turn a greenish blue from the blueberries. Overall, this was a tasty muffin.

The flavor is nice, I would have never known it was Splenda if I hadn't seen it in the recipe, but the texture was a little heavy.

Blueberries turned bread a crazy green color in places, but nice look overall. Not a lot of flavor aside from the fruit, but ok.

These are fairly good.  The fruit tastes great, but the breading is a bit flavorless.
