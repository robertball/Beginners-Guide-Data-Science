We loved this recipe. I made a couple of minor changes after reading the previous reviews. I had eight English bangers and I used both a red and green pepper and one zucchini that I sliced in half lengthwise and then sliced up each half in semi circles. I also used some fresh sliced mushrooms and a large spanish onion because these were the vegetables I had on hand. Instead of water I used chicken broth and along with the salt and pepper I used a few good shakes of Mrs. Dash No Salt Added Garlic and Herb seasoning. Yes the sauce is a bit soupy but over rice it is delicious and I served some crusty buns to mop it up with. Very good recipe that I will make again. Thank you for sharing this one.

4 stars for ease of preparation. I used italian hot sausage. This comes out really soupy - so I served over rice. A little bland on the spices I will try adding more spices (maybe some garlic and cayenne pepper) the next time I make this.

Super easy and quite tasty. I used gourmet tomato basil sausages from a market by my work they really made the dish. i cooked a little under an hour about 45 minutes to keep the peppers a little crunchy. I really enjoyed it 5 stars for ease and great taste.

Made this with chicken sausage that had portobello mushrooms in it. I served it on a bed of white jasmine rice. It turned out great! My hubby really liked it.

My husband and I loved this recipe. We had it with brown rice and it was SO good. I did a few things different. I only used green peppers (that's all I had) and I added cherry tomatoes (cut in half) and when I browned the sausage I added a clove a garlic for extra flavor. I took the advice of another reviewer and used chicken broth instead of water. Great recipe and very easy.

Great quick to cook and leave recipe kids loved it - including the red capsicum! Left in slower cooker all day on auto cook went out all day and it was ready at dinner time. Used only red capsicum though and added peas and corn and paprika served on boiled rice - there was nothing left! Thank you this one is a keeper.

Must say...WOW! I was really surprised with how good it was! I tweaked it a little of course but mainly because I don't measure and I cut the recipe in 1/2 for just my husband and I. I used mrs dash garlic powder and a little ground sea salt. Nice tangy taste and the rice tops it off nicely! I think next time we're trying it with carrots celery and mushrooms in it as well! Thanks so much!!

This was a little soupy like other reviews said but it didn't bother me in the least it tasted great. I added mushrooms and zucchini in addition to the peppers. I also added garlic salt pepper and garlic herb seasoning and used chicken broth instead of water (only half a cup). I found it nice and tasty. I also cooked the whole thing in the slow cooker which worked great. I cooked it on high for 6 hours but I probably could have done it on low.

I love this recipe but I have made three changes to the recipe and I think you'll like the changes. This is so tasty and fills the house with such a great smell. 1. I replace the link sausages with 1 Chub of Premium pork sausage.(pre-fried) 2. Add 3/4 cup of rice (and a 1 1/2 cups water. 3. I add two Relleno or Anaheim peppers chopped up and baked along with everything else.

Its simple preparation and wonderful flavor works well for those busy nights. I cut the sausage beforehand to brown added some chopped plum tomatoes from the garden I needed to use and a little garlic salt to the dish. Also I only had red peppers. After reading the reviews about it being watery I only added 1/4 cup water and half the amount of ketchup because of the addition of the plum tomatoes. This was wonderful served over farfalle pasta.
