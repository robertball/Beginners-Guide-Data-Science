So easy. Added bell peppers and a sweet onion.  Crowd pleaser for sure.

This recipe was very easy to make and tasted great! I did however run into an issue with missing the Barbecue Sauce in the ingredient list. No worries, I not only found it by reading the top, but I also used the same Sauce! Thank you again!
