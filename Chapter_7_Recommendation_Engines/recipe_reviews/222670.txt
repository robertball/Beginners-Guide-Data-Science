This is as good as any aloo gobi dish that we had in an Indian restaurant without sitting in too much oil.  I added 1 cup sliced okra and 1 large tomato chopped, from the garden and it was great.

Absolutely delectable!!  Omitted the potato for keto diet. Used avocado oil and didn't have caraway seeds but was great without. So much flavor!  New fav side veggie. Paired with tilapia piccata and green beans.

This recipe is awesomely delicious!! I steam-cooked my cauliflower and potatoes and mixed them in to coat as the last step before serving. Will be making this dish a lot!

Very delicious. I made it twice already. You have to watch the pan to make sure the cauliflower and potatoes don't burn. I added zucchini and carrots the second time because I had them on hand but this is a very versatile dish.
