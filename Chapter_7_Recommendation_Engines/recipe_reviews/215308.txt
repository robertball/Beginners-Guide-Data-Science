Sorry haven't tried it yet but - cook it for 20 minutes in a Slow Cooker???  The ingredients sound good but the cooking process is confusing.

Very quick and easy.  I actually just threw all the ingredients into the crockpot without browning the meat and I added turkey sausage, because I was runnig late.  Cooked it on low all day, and it was FABULOUS!!!!!  A huge hit!  Served with cornbread and had plenty leftover even after we all had seconds!!

YUM

Everything is warmed up in the pan first.. the 20 min sit time on high in the crock pot is to simmer it down a bit and it is ready to eat at that point. You can start it in the morning and have it sit all day but no more than an extra 20 is needed when you are in a hurry.

Good twist on chili. I like the liquid smoke addition, and still wouldn't mind serving it with (more) chopped onions as well as chopped pickles.  It needed a little something "extra"...

A really good, basic chili recipe.  I added a little horseradish mustard in addition to regular mustard for a little extra kick.

Really great!  My 9 month LOVED this!  I substituted a 16 oz. bag of frozen corn (just added it frozen when I mixed up the recipe), I also used all fresh tomatoes from our garden and added just a sprinkle of liquid smoke.  It was very hardy and great for a cool day!

Fabulous turkey chili!!  This is even better than the all beef chili I usually make for my family.  I have made this a couple of times this past winter and there is never any leftovers.

Easy recipe and everyone loves it.  I only use the slow cooker if we are not all sitting down to eat at the same time .

My husband and I love this recipe. We make it all the time and even have extra left over to freeze. I've tried putting everything in the slow cooker and not browning the meat before hand, but I feel like the turkey is more crumbly when browning before hand. Excellent recipe!

I made this recipe exactly how it said.  Interesting, but not great. I followed some tips from fellow reviewers after tasting it I cut up pickles to put on top. Don't think I will make it again.

Very good throw together on short notice. I will use less onion the next time. But will definitely make again.

I followed the recipe closely and it was pretty good!  Modifications:  browned the onion the skillet after I browned the turkey, and added a clove of minced garlic to the onions.  Also, I let the mixture stay in the crockpot on high for longer (about 35 minutes) and put the cheese on top for about 20 minutes.  I took a photo with the cheese only on 1/2 before it melted, so that you can see what it looks like without the cheese covering it.  Big hit with the hubby and little ones.  It is slightly sweet, but the family liked that. :)

This was just alright.  We served it with tortilla chips to dip.  I will not prepare it as a main dish again, but it really makes some decent chili cheese dog topping the next day.

My husband loves this!  I found that it's easier to to just put all of the ingredients in the slow cooker earlier as opposed to cooking the sauce on the stovetop.  It's really easy to add your own spices and ingredients.
