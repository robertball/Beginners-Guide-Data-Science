This is just as good as the author says it is.  What an easy and delicious recipe.  I made a few changes because I did not need this much and I prefer chopping ham to buying ham spread.  I used my food processor and ground the ham.  I added the yolks and other ingredients to processor and made it in no time.  I used only 6 eggs and 1 pound of asparagus.  I also cut the cheese sauce to 3 tbsp each of flour and butter, added only 1 cup of milk and made the sauce.  Once I had piped the yolk mixture into the whites I used an 8" square pan.  Piping the yolks by cutting a corner off a ziploc or other plastic bag made it easy and clean up a breeze.  I prefer Panko style bread crumbs but used the corn flakes and loved it.  Will make many more times as my husband doesn't like deviled eggs or asparagus but loved this.

I have had this recipe in a Junior League of Lafayette cookbook from 2001 and I had been meaning to try it, so I did a test run last night. Deliciously decadent and must be shared with lot of people that can handle this much cream, butter, & cheese and it looks beautiful! I will be making this again, but plan to modify it with a sharper cheddar and finding a way to make a vegetarian alternative. Possible something with mushroom or marinated artichoke.

This turned out really good. I wasn't sure about the deviled ham but it worked well in this. The only change I made was to use Panko bread crumbs instead of the corn flakes. We don't eat cereal so I couldn't justify buying a box just for this recipe. This is a great way to use up asparagus from the garden!

I liked it very much.  I don't know what 'ham spread' is and I can't buy it anyway.  I opened a tin of duck pate with foie gras in it.  Scrumptious!

I have chickens and tons of eggs. This is an awesome recipe to use the eggs up!  I didn't have ham spread, so I chopped up ham and added alittle mayo instead.  Flavors melded well.  Got really good reviews from the rest of the family. Saving this to my recipe box!
