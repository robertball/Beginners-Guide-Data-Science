I would suggest the following tips based on my experience:

Replace oil with butter for more softness.

Alternatively, if you're out of butter, you can replace 1T of oil with heavy cream. I haven't tried it with a 100% sub, but you could try it.

Increase Juice to 2T and reduce water. You can even increase it to 3T and add no water if you want it really lemony.

If you have less lemons, you could add a 1/4 -1/2 t of zest of the lemon you are using.

Limes can be subbed for Lemons.Even oranges can be subbed but fresh juice doesn't seem to work-you'll have to use  a tetra pack.

If you're using a flax seed or chia seed egg to replace the egg  you can taste the batter and add more juice and zest as you see fit.

Add 1/8 tsp. of baking soda. it reacts with lemon to give a rise.

You can split it among two cups for more even 'baking'.

You can add 2T banana for 2T oil to reduce fat and reduce sugar to 3T. This does depend upon your own taste or lack thereof for bananas.
You can make a 3T sub as well but banana does make it denser so you might want to keep that in mind.Maybe increase the soda or baking powder by 1/4t ?

I thought it was very good.  I read the recipe and didn't have any disillusion on what the end result would be.  I would never say a homemade recipe is disgusting because this is a site for sharing.  Chicago has a wonderful cooking school my son attended - feel free to attend then trash this site.  show some respect and I've looked at what you people like - Not all for my taste, but I didn't troll-trash you.

I enjoyed this recipe.  I will make it again.  Thank you for sharing.

This was heavy and not a great texture. The flavor was not particularly very lemony either. I will not be making this again.

This is a microwave cake.  It makes no pretense to be anything else, so if you make this expecting to eat something with the texture of an oven baked cake, you'll be disappointed.  If, however, you are looking for an individual, easy-to-make, from-the-microwave cake, this is an excellent recipe.  I topped mine with some lemon yogurt instead of the suggested topping, but it was good without any topping at all.

Admittedly, the proportions of this recipe did look a bit off, but with minor modifications, this was excellent. First, only add 1/4 c. Flour. I never use whole eggs in a mug cake, so just added the yolk. For those who complained it was bland, it was in serious need of an 1/8 tsp salt. Microwaved for 90 seconds. And with a powdered sugar and lemon juice glaze (why microwave a second item just to dissolve the sugar?) this was delicious! It came out very soft and light and lemony. Like lemonade in cake form. Yum!

I took the advice of several people who left reviews and the outcome was delicious. I substituted melted butter for the oil and I added lemon zest to the cake mixture for a bolder lemony taste.

I made mine in a soup bowl as it seemed a bit much for a cup but, all in all, it tastes  quite good. I made two and halved the sugar of one. It still came out well. Would definitely make it again.

Very easy, turned out perfectly with no mess. I substituted most of my oil for butter and increased the baking soda, as some reviews said to. I also used powdered sugar for the sauce, and a little bit less. 
NOTE: You cannot expect a perfect lemon cake made in the microwave. If you want something very nice, go make a big one in the oven. This is a great recipe, but shouldn't be used in place of normal lemon cakes when it is just for those days where you cannot be bothered.

I made this cake and was extremely disappointed. I was craving a lemon-y sweet treat. When I made this and tried it I was very disappointed. I got a mix of sour and bland. I’m sad now.?? don’t make this. It’s just a waste of ingredients.

I live at altitude, so I doubled the baking powder, and it turned out fantastic! the glaze helps with the dryness that always plagues microwave cakes, and I put in a little bit more lemon juice so I was juicing one whole lemon for the cake and glaze.

Very good!  Turned out moist and fluffy.  Most recipes I usually have to doctor, but this one is great as-is.  The only recommendation is a sprinkle of powdered sugar on top, or a dollop of ice cream or whipped.

Terrible!!!! I followed the recipe exactly and monitored it closely as all microwaves vary. The consistency is exactly like a microwave mug cake so no complaints there but the flavor..? Yuck. 

I will try this again and use butter rather than oil and add some vanilla. If it turns out better, I will write another review. If you don't see another review from me, understand it to mean the flavor was still not good.

I made this strictly following the directions... and got an oddly chewy cake out of it. The lemon glaze saved this one from being a one-star, though! That was delicious, though it didn't redeem the rest of the cake.

This was totally awesome! I halved the recipe and I'm glad I did because it was big and I even shared it with my brother. I didn't have lemon juice so I used vanilla instead. And I poked holes in the the top so it would infuse the cake. Also I sprinkled powdered sugar on top. It was delish!

so good, I made this the first time and was blown away, the second time I added more lemon and white chocolate chips, It was literally the best thing I have ever tasted

not great. It smells strange and has a strange texture. If I try this again I'm definitely changing up the recipe.
