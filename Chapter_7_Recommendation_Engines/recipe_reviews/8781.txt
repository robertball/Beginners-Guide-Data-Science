Sounds weird but it's a new family favorite.  I'd suggest sticking with standard kraut (not Bavarian) or it could easily get too sweet.  If using frozen chicken breast use the cooking directions on the package but layer as per the directions here.  Excess barbecue sauce gives a mellow smoky sweet taste to the kraut. Drain the kraut first so you get a nice blend of flavors instead of a puddle.

This dish is marvelous!! A breeze to put together and the kraut is abolutely delicious with that barbque suace simmered into it.  I did have to cook this for about 50 minutes though for the chicken to get done. Maybe I used thicker breasts.  Definitely making this again.

This was better than I thought it would be.  The only thing I would change (and this is just for our own taste) is that the BBQ sauce I used was pretty strong so I might go with something milder next time.  Something on the sweet side as opposed to the heavy smokey side.

I made this exactly as directed using Bullseye barbeque sauce and doubling the recipe. Awesome! I would not change a thing. Thanks for sharing, Lisa!

My husband loved this!! He'd give it 10 stars if he could... of course he is a big fan of the kraut!!! He said he would even like it without the chicken!! I, on the other hand, am not a big fan of it...but the bar-b-q sauce changes it for the better.. i also drained my kraut well.... I think this is important... I think it would be too runny.. used honey b-b-q sauce... Most importantly.. it doesnt get any easier... served with "healthy" baked beans and "lighter" mashed potatoes...oh yeah and I did not cover thinking again of it becoming runny.. the kraut was "thick" and carmelized.. it was good!

This reminded me (just a little) of Polish "Kapusta", which is a sweet and sour flavored cooked cabbage (minus the tomato base of bbq sauce). With this recipe however, the flavor varies a lot, depending on the bbq sauce you use. The chicken was good but I like much better with a Polish sausage or Bratwurst and homemade-type noodles (frozen "Reames" brand are excellent)with some of the sauce. This was easier than making  "Kapusta" so I might experiment with different bbq sauces.

My husband loved this, and I love how easy it is to make -- but I can't help wishing there was a little *more* to it.  Some vegetables or something.  I think I'll experiment with other ingredients the next time I make it.  (But I will make it again; it got enthusiastic thumbs up from the fam.)

This recipe was good in flavor, but I ended up having to microwave it at the end because the chicken wasn't done!  I'm not sure what went wrong.  Maybe next time I'll pound out the chicken breasts before I put them in the oven.  -Allison

This is a great weeknight meal, so easy to prepare!  I'm not nuts about boneless, skinless chicken breasts but adding BBQ sauce and sauerkraut definately makes them less blah.  I only did two breasts and used a 16 oz. package of drained kraut and it worked out great.  Also, I did not measure the sauce; just added a thick layer of Sweet Baby Ray's.  Mashed potatoes on the side is a must!  I'll add this to my rotation as the ingredients are inexpensive and easy to keep on hand.

My husband is from Wisconsin, and loves sauerkraut. Although this sounded like an unusual combination, I gave it a try. He usually eats anything I make, and after two bites (one to try, two to make sure) he wouldn't eat another bite!

This one was certainly a surprise!  We loved it, and considering how easy it was, it rates 5 stars in my book.  Followed the recipe exactly, but took the suggetion of another reviewer and added diced sweet potato around the edges of the dish.  A very easy weeknight meal...just add a green salad or a green veggie and you're all set.  Thanks Lisa!

I didn't care much for this but my man liked it. I think that it was the barbecue sauce that I used. I'll try it again with a different kind and I'll bet it will be great.

I'm not a fan of sauerkraut but my husband is. So I thought I'd give it a try. To my surprise this dish is very good. The bbq sauce takes over the flavor of the cabbage. I will make this again.

This was very tangy and the barbecue sauce was mellow. I used Bullseye sauce and Bavarian sauerkraut. I thought this was okay but not something I would prefer to have again while my DH didn't like it at all. It wasn't bad, it just didn't suit us. I enjoyed trying out a new recipe though and a new dish, so thank you for a nice change from our norm.

The BBQ sauce is critical here.  I used a type without any corn syrup.  (All "natural", blah, blah, blah)  The flavor of the 3 simple ingredients is wonderful!  I added sliced carrots right on top of the dish, but  wouldn't do that again.  They came out too "crisp" still after baking and didn't have that wonderful roasted flavor baking usually gives them.  The vinegar in the kraut really made my chicken tender and tasty - surprisingly tender.  I baked the 13x9 dish covered with foil for an hour and a half.  So you can see my disappointment with the carrots not coming out softer.  Great recipe I will make again.  Thanks!

Though this recipe was easy and good.  I used bone-in chicken breasts and baked for about 1 hour.  The kids didn't eat the saurkraut but they absolutely loved the chicken.  Served with mashed potatoes.  Thanks for the great recipe, I'll make over and over.

I read the reviews and was very skeptical; however, given all the positive reviews I had to try it.  My hubby LOVED it.  We were pleasantly surprised and will definitely make this again.  We halved a couple of potatoes and stuck them In the same pan to make it a one dish meal.  Very good.

Overall I liked it, although I am not a fan of kraut... It wasn't half bad. A couple things I would suggest to anyone trying this. 1) Drain the kraut (Otherwise it ends up like soup) 2) Put some barbecue sauce on each side of the chicken. and 3) Cook for around 40-45 Minutes instead of 30.

I was skeptical about this recipe but it turned out really good with a Very unique flavor combo.  I drained my 16oz package of sauerkraut (thanks to reviews!).  Used about 1/2 cup of spicey bbq sauce ontop of two small chicken breasts.. Cooked in an ungreased, 13" dia ceramic dish (with lid) @ 350' for 75min. Thankfully had no issues with the cabbage burning onto the bottom or sides (one of my concerns).   Wish the recipe had been written with a BIT more detail, but overall it's SO easy and tastes great - 5 stars :)

I wanted to like it! I used honey BBQ as others advised. Not even mashed potatoes could save it. I guess I don't like the combo with sauerkraut.

This tasted bad - we love sauerkraut and BBQ so decided to try this recipe out. The flavor was just not good. My teenage son, which will eat just about anything asked me NEVER to make this again. I followed the exact recipe except for adding some chopped onions.

Very tasty.  Like others, I had to cook much longer...over 1 hour probably due to thickness of the chicken breasts I used.  I also added a layer of sliced onions and sliced baby red potatoes on the bottom before adding sauerkraut.  I used Jack Daniels original recipe BBQ sauce and it was a perfect match.

Five stars for simplicity, five stars for tastiness, and five stars for acceptance by the family.  Husband went for seconds and leftovers the next day.  The four chicken breast halves I had were huge so it took longer to cook and would have fed eight.  :)

I really enjoyed this recipe.  This was the first time I've ever tried sauerkraut and I was pleasantly surprised.  I added red potato's and onion, as mentioned in another review and it was great.  My wife really liked the meal too.  Definately will be making again.

This was fantastic!! I used chicken tenderloins rather than the brests and it worked out well. I also added some crubmled bacon bites to the kraut and it gave it an extra smoky flavor which we loved. So easy to prepare and the flavor pairing of the bbq and the kraut was surprisingly excellent!

Weirded out by the recipe, but on reflection, most BBQ sauces have a lot of vinegar or other acidic flavorings.  So I tried it, adding a bottom layer of sliced russets, sprinkled with red onion.  It was OK.  I probably would have forgotten it, but my supermaket had a closeout on giardinere and I had a flash--German chicken with giardinere!
I layered sliced Red Bliss (russets got mushy), slivered serranos, giardinere, some sauerkraut and packed in as many spicy turkey sausages and chicken breasts as I could; poured on some KC BBQ sauce. Covered and baked 1 hour. Uncovered for 15 minutes to brown the meat. FANTASTIC! We ate the vegs and a little bit of the meat for the first meal.  Had succulent and beautifully flavored braised chicken and sausages: last night's supper (with roasted veg); salad, pasta, sandwiches, hash; and there's still one last piece of sausage destined to be a salad wrap in my brown bag tomorrow.
You've heard of German Measles? I've got German (Chicken) Fever!

Yummy and easy to make. I flip the chicken once during baking and add more bbq sauce on top of them. Takes 50 minutes to cook. Serve with boiled or baked potatoes.

I am a native of Wisconsin, and never acquired that oh so famous taste for sauerkraut.  My husband surprised me with this dish one evening.  Although hesitant to try it, it is now one of my favorite (and easiest to prepare) dinners!

Great idea for leftover sauerkraut following brat season. I added onion and carrot slices and used a honey BBQ sauce. Very tasty. I would use less sauce next time to make it healthier, but still get the flavor. My husband liked it too!

Was so surprised at how good this was, as I do not particularly like sauerkraut, and only make it because my husband likes it. I will be making this again. And even want to try it using pork instead of chicken.

Have made this for years! Simple, easy and delicious. Most times I serve it with rice which works well with all the juice and sauce. I have also layered diced potatoes on the bottom which is really good too!

Even though I drained the kraut, it was much too sour for my taste. After 30 minutes the chicken was totally raw. I upped the temperature to 375 and baked it for 20 more minutes. Parts of it were still raw. I had tossed some sliced onions on top which blended well with the BBQ sauce, but not enough to save the dish.

Easily adapted to five small chicken breasts with 24 ounces of German kraut. I used Kraft thick n spicy brown sugar BBQ sauce and baked for 50 minutes. Even my very picky father ate it. I added boiled red potatoes. Great!! Thanks for the idea.

I made this for the first time and we all loved it!  My husband and daughter said, "Make it again." so it will go into my recipe box and will be repeated often, I am sure.  I made it just like the recipe said.  Thanks for sharing this one.

I did a double batch and added some garlic seasoning to the chicken and a tiny bit of sriracha to give it a bit of kick.  We had it with black eyes peas and homemade mac n cheese.  It was awesome!  My fiance who doesn't like sauerkraut really enjoyed it!

I made this as directed.  It was average.  If you are looking for something easy, and different, this is okay.

A hit at my house.  I layered sliced, canned potatoes first, then the kraut and chicken.  I used boneless thighs instead of breasts.  If you are not a sauerkraut lover, try rinsing it before you use it - takes away some of the sour flavor.  Thanks for a great and easy recipe!

I think the taste of this depends a LOT on what kind of sauerkraut and BBQ sauce you get.  The combination we had was pretty potent, and not great.  I may try again with different sauce or kraut.

This really easy, which is a huge plus. The 30 minutes baking time sounded short , so I put it in for 50 minutes  and timed my side dishes accordingly. The chicken was still not done, so I was a little annoyed. I put it in longer rather than microwave. Next time I will buy thin chicken breasts.

I wanted to try this as I never had chicken with sauerkraut before. Unfortunately, we didn't care for this at all.

Nice change from my marinated chicken recipes, but I'm just not in love with sauerkraut.

I really loved this recipe.  My husband liked, and the other guys I live with dont like saurkraut at all so they hated it.  I think this recipe is a winner in my book.  It is definatly a hit or miss recipe though.  Thanks!!!!

Totally easy and yummy.  served with mashed potatoes and steamed carrots.  I used an entire 32 oz. jar of sauerkraut and combined two kinds of organic BBQ sauce.  Also decreased time to 50 min.  Came out great!

For ease of preparation, this recipe warrants 5 stars.  For taste, 3.5 stars.  A very simple recipe with home-cooking taste.  But please keep in mind that this is a three ingredient recipe ready in 30 minutes. Even Rachael Raye would be     impressed!!!

Excellent! I followed the directions and had it in the oven in about 5 minutes. My wife, who doesn't like sauerkraut, loved this recipe.

I tried this because of all the great reviews and the fact it was such an easy recipe. I have to say, I was disappointed. I should have gone with my first instinct of thinking it was an odd combination.

Very easy, and very good. I used a balsamic vinegar infused BBQ sauce and baked at 375F for 1 hour, along side a few baked potatoes brushed with olive oil and kosher salt.  Incredibly easy weeknight meal, good enough to bring to a potluck.

I made this tonight for dinner and I have to say I am amazed at how easy and delicious it turned out. My husband and I both loved it.  I did have to cook a little longer than 1/2 hour though. Absolutely a keeper! Thanks for the great recipe.

Simple to prepare! I love sauerkraut and chicken, and the barbeque sauce sweetened up the dish just enough without taking away from the tange of the kraut. Will include this in my rotation of dinners.

The chicken breasts were lovely and moist. I did not enjoy the combination of the sauerkraut and BBQ sauce. I do like sauerkraut, just wasn't my thing.
