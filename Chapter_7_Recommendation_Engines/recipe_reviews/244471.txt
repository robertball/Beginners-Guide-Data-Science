These grapes are really good!
  I don't like star anise, so I left it out.  And I didn't have cinnamon sticks or whole allspice.    I substituted  1/4 teaspoon of ground cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon ground allspice.  It  turned out great!  
  These  would be a great addition to  the cheese plate during the holidays.   They taste like the holidays!
     Thanks CJ, for something so different and  good.

Interesting flavor; I think it will be better after more time. After one day they didn't seem "pickled through". Also, I had too much liquid by about a cup. Next time, I will use more onions: they are my favorite part!
