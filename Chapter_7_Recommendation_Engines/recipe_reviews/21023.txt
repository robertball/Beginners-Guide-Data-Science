I have made this dish quite a few times now, and everyone loves it. I have found that a dollup of sour cream helps for those who need to take the edge of the spicy-ness of the sauce.

You are right-it looks disgusting, but the important thing is that it tastes great! My 6-year-old, my hubby, and I all liked this very much. My 3-year-old wouldn't touch it, but that's nothing new. We loved the queso sauce. Hubby has requested this become his Sunday night meal, while he watches Sunday Night Football! I guess it's a real manly man meal! LOL! Thanks for sharing. It's great to have some new recipes to try!

Took us a lot longer to make.  Shredding the potatoes is a pain.  If I had to do it again I would use frozen hashbrowns.  Looks gross like everyone says, but it was delicious.  I would make it again

It tastes really good. Since reviewers noted some "bland" flavor, I added about 3-4 drops of tobasco hot sauce to the tomato and since other said it looks... blah (?), before eating it, I took off my glasses !!

This was okay, but a little too bland for me.  I think kids would like it though, not too many strong flavors.  I did not have any processed cheese, so used shredded cheese instead.  If I make this again, I might add some spices and/or maybe make some kind of red sauce to go over top.

Well, it certainly does look icky, but, it tasted good.  I admit I was a skeptic.  I added left over chicken that I had bar-b -qued the night before (1 cup) and loved it and will make it again.  Thanks for sharing.

It was great. My husband and I really enjoyed this dish. I used shredded sharp cheddar cheese instead of the process stuff. I also used Muir Glen Organic Fire Roasted Diced Tomatoes with Green Chiles along with a dash of jalapeno sauce. I topped with sour cream and avocado. My husband said "A++" and he is a meat and potatoes guy. We will definitely make again.

I love potato enchiladas. I use red or sweet potato or banana squash in mine.  Can also use zucchini.

this recipe is only kinda ok.  i only made it because someone gave me a ton of processed cheese to use up.  if i do make this again, i will be using frozen hashbrowns rather than going through all the work of shredding potatoes and attempting to fry them..... mine turned out sticky and grey-ish.  and please tell me no one is using canned peas, ugg... at least frozen ones won't disentigrate into oblivion

The original recipe is fine as is, but I made it better.  I used frozen shredded hashbrowns, sauted them with 1/2 diced onion.  I seasoned the potatoes with black pepper and seasoning salt.  Then I mixed in drained, rinsed black beans (instead of the peas) and frozen corn.  No mashing required--it actually looked pretty good.  You could also saute a bell pepper, I would think.
