This is nothing but pure carribean flavour, mouth watering and overall healty. Taste is delighting and very good. Try this for kids who don't like spinach.

I've never tried any authentic version of this, but I wasn't impressed. The habanero didn't offer sufficient flavor.  The okra goo accentuated the sliminess of the spinach. I thought it was rather bland an forgettable.

I made this with a LOT of substituted ingredients because I could not get all that the recipe called for where I live, here in the US. I used fresh spinach, dried thyme, canned crab, and frozen okra. We do not eat pork so I omitted the bacon and pig's tail. It was still delicious! I can only imagine what it would have been like with the authentic ingredients. I will happily make this again. I loved eating callaloo when I was in Trinidad and Tobago and am thrilled to be able to make it at home. Thank you for sharing the recipe.

The dish came out good. The only problem is the lack of flavor. Added salt to taste but it needed something extra. Growing up with this dish I could tell that the habanero and salt wasn't enough. Just have to play with the seasoning. Pour it over rice and its delicious.
