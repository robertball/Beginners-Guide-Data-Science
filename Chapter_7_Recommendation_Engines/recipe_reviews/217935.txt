I made this as directed with no changes and found it quite bland.  My kids didnt like it at all.  It might help to add some jalepenos to the onions and garlic with the tomatoes when blending in the blender.  I ended up adding a bit of cheese whiz to my bowl.

Made as directed and it was pretty good. I think this is more of a base to create many different types of Fideo. Simmer down more and it is more of how my Mexican mother-in-law makes it for the grand babies. Add more chicken broth and slightly less tomato and its more of how I like it, broth-ier. I will add some shredded chicken fajitas and make it more of a smokey tex-mex flavor soup next time. Mexican spouse LOVED it! This is a good start of a lot of different style recipes.

Very good! I love this soup, but because of heart failure, I'm on a very sodium restrictive diet. So I made exactly as written, but made with 32 oz low-sodium chicken broth,1 tsp no sodium chicken bouillon granules,unsalted diced tomatoes with oregano, basil and garlic, and it was goooood! To the average person it's probably a little bland, but for me it was perfect and I got my soup fix I was craving.

Update: I have since made this recipe several times. I've added a 4 oz can of diced green chilis and definitely use fresh cilantro if you can. Also added 10 oz extra lean ground turkey cooked with Mrs. Dash taco season and added it to the soup. It's a great way to add a little protein to a nice, light soup. This is definitely one of my favorite very low sodium soups on this site.

Very simple recipe. It doesn't have a lot of flavor however. I like to use fire roasted tomatoes or diced tomatoes and chilies.  Also, I add cayenne powder, chili powder, and a cube of Knorr's caldo de tomate. Its really delicious right out of the pot... but let it sit over night and when you have it the next day, it'll have a strong flavor.

actually upon going over those ingredients I do a lot differently as far as measurements go .. this soup is superb. 
I use 3 tomatoes, a sliver of white onion (about 1/8 of it),  3 cloves of garlic (or more, I'm a garlic nut) and chicken broth .. blend all of the ingredients and cook it down till it reduces a few times and the flavor marries.  Of course salt & pepper to taste.  Sometimes I'll add egg noodles but it tastes fine w/o.

Such simple ingredients, yet such an impactful and delicate flavor.  I prefer to use the cilantro fresh as a garnish on top. mmm!

This is simple-y wonderful! I had a Guatemalan nanny who would make Sopa de fideos and we loved it. I grew up and am married to a Guatemalan and we have never made fideos like this. The secret is keep it simple. I did add sliced jalapenos.

This recipe tastes so authentic and delicious!! The only changes I made was to add a little more garlic, and instead of cans of chicken broth, I used just a tablespoon of powdered chicken bouillon. I also added salt to my blender before I pureed my tomato mixture. I would have never thought to use canned tomatoes!

great sopa fideo!  I followed exactly except I was about 10 oz short on broth so I mixed up a cup of calde de tomato and added it. very good. maybe a touch too oniony...I'm ton sure whatnpeople think a small onion is, I used half of what I would call a medium. I wish people would use cups as opposed to "small onion" but not a really big deal. great recipe.

Yes, will make again. 
It was great to have after a long cold day in Chicago.
So easy to make. I think I might add a cup more of chicken broth.
Next time I might use beef broth too.

A little watered down for my liking. I added a small can of tomato sauce which helped. I think next time I would only do 4-5 cups of liquid instead of the 6 that this recipe comes out to & I think that would help a bit too. Maybe even use the roasted diced tomatoes instead of the regular ones. I also added cumin while frying the noodles. This is definitely a good base recipe that can be added to depending on people’s liking.

Pretty tasty. I added a fresh jalapeno to the vegetables and cumin to the broth. There are a hundred variations to make it your own.

Good base recipe to start from, but definitely needs some enhancements. I doubled the garlic and added some chili powder, cumin, and a dash of cayenne pepper and it was delicious. The flavor was very close to the Mexican noodle soup I had at a restaurant and was looking to recreate. I can't imagine not having those spices in the soup.  I omitted the cilantro and used twice as much broth, too.

Very delicious! I had to work with what I had in my pantry so I used the shell pasta and some elbow pasta instead. I used knorr suiza (added about a teaspoon to the tomatoe mixture) instead of  chicken broth. I added chopped potatoes, carrots and celery. When served I added crumbled Mexican cheese and my kids absolutely loved this! Will definitely make it again.

This recipe will absorb all the liquid and is very bland.  I only used half of the noodles and used a whole carton of chicken broth, added cayenne and chili powder.  It was good after all the adjustments

It was terrible! (my version) So, the tomato and onion thing was in the blender for like 30 seconds (instead of 1 minute and 30 sec), then my mom yelled at me and told me to turn it off.  So it came out chunky. Then, I used veggie broth because I'm vegan, and when I put both together, I added super long spaghetti which absorbed all the soup.  In the end, I thought it said 1 tbsp Salt......I'm sure you know what happens next. I ended up going to my room and crying. Yup, I'm a horrible cook. That's what I get for being vegan. I wish I got to try it though, like the actual human food soup recipe.

Authentic. Made it for my son who ate it frequently while living in Mexico for two years; he loved it.

Very easy to make.  My pan wasn't big enough for browning the pasta, but I made it work. Changed up and used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth, and I thought it tasted great. I'd been meaning to make this since I got back from a trip to Mexico this summer. Thanks for the recipe!

May I suggest to add cumin and coriander and a dash of cayanne pepper to spice up the liquid.

I love this recipe, however i kinda added a few things like how my gma would make it. I add some ground beef, carrots, and potatoes to be a little more filling. My kiddos loved it, I also used the star shaped fideo to make it more kid friendly.

It was alright. I didn't care for the tomato mixture. Next time I'll try it without it.

While this is tasty, it's not traditional fideo, which is much simpler to make. But I gave it the 4 stars because it is good.

My mother in law makes sopa de fideo for my son all the time. I finally learned how to make it thanks to this recipe. I only use half bag of fideos because we enjoy the soup version rather than a thick pasta. It's delicious. I like the idea of blending the onion because my son can get his veggies without knowing.

Good stuff. I made a few modifications based on other folks' comments that it was bland. 

1) I added half a bell pepper to the blender, in addition to the tomato and onion.

2) I used two cans of chicken broth rather than three, to keep it thick.

3) I put in a sprinkle of my favourite gourmet chili powder and some adobo powder (which is basically garlic powder, cumin, and salt).

4) Finally, rather than cooking the cilantro, I tore it up and put it on top of the soup in the serving bowls. I also added grated cheese.
