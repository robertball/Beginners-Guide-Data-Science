Definetely a great recipe!  I would make this again next year for Thanksgiving.  I put all of the ingredients in my crockpot in the morning and let it cook on low for about 7 hours and it was delicious!

This was great!!  This was our first attempt at homemade fresh green beans.  We tried to make it a from-scratch Thanksgiving this year, and everything turned out great, including these beans!!  
.
We threw 1/2 a pound of beans (enough for a side dish for 2), 4 slices of pan-fried bacon, cut up, in lieu of the hamhock (if we do bacon again, we'll do 2 slices), and 2 tbsp of brown sugar into the mix for fun, and the beans came out with just the right amount of sweet & salty (the bacon ended up a little sweet though, so next time, we'll try ham).  
.
We cooked them on high in the crockpot for 20 minutes, then low for the next 3 1/2 hours while the turkey took its time.  The beans turned out deliciously, just the right amount of tenderness and firmness and a great flavor. :)

Served this for Thanksgiving. Was a great hit would not change a thing.  The vinegar is very important.  My Brother-IN-Law took the recipe home with him.

This recipe was great!  I did not have a ham hock so I substituted a half pound of bacon cut up and it tasted really yummy.  Even my daughter that does not like green beens ate this one.  Will definitely make agian.

This was a great recipe. I made some subtle changes, though. I reduced the water, threw in a second ham hock (they came a pair to the package), eliminated the garlic, and substituted cider vinegar for white and reduced it to 1 1/2 tablespoons. I cooked that down for about 2 hours before adding the beans. I left them on for a slow simmer for about 2 hours. Letter perfect!

These green beans are exceptional.I celebrate thanksgiving twice a year since I moved to Canada (they have there's on the 10 of October). When I read this recipe I thought vinegar uh but it adds a great flavor to them and I also used cracked black peppercorn, it made them spicy

I made these for Christmas dinner and I loved them.  I used 4 lbs frozen italian cut greem beans and only used about 3/4 of the vinegar called for.  I put all the ingredients in the slow cooker and cooked on high for about 3 hours, then reduced to low for about 3 hours.  My fiance and I loved them, the kids didn't like them at all.

I'm sorry but these were horrible.  I did not like the onion taste on them.  I ended up cleaning them off and just cooking them on the oven with some garlic and oil.  I would not recommend these.

I omitted the onion but otherwise followed this to a T. Used the washed and trimmed green beans in the package in the produce section to save some time. These were the best green beans I've ever made - now I know that the very long cooking time is the key. They were just great, and couldn't have been easier!

This is a really good recipe.  I've also found others that I liked, so I've blended them together a little.  I use 2# of frozen beans, add a couple tsp of sugar, 6 slices of crisp thick bacon (I can't easily find ham hock in MN) w/grease, 1/3 onion, plus the garlic, vinegar, salt & pepper,  and cook it in a crock pot on low for 6-8 hrs in 2-1/2 cups of chicken stock.  Other than the ham hock, these are as close to the beans I loved when I lived in GA that I've been able to make.

Good south of the mason-dixon beans.  Made for Thanksgiving and got rave reviews.  Wouldn't change a thing.  Smelled yummy cooking too.  This recipe would work well for collards or kale or other greens.  Don't skimp on vinegar, gives a nice bite.  Thank you for this recipe.

Loved them!  I made a few modifications:  1 smoked turkey leg versus ham hock.  Next time I will add 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes to give them a little kick.

This was really good and I didn't even use any ham or bacon. . This is the recipe I will use from now on. I guess it has to do with the vinegar. You don't taste the vinegar, but it must do something to make them good.

This was a great base recipe.  I used beef broth instead of water and bacon instead of a ham hock.  I also am not a huge vinegar fan, so I only used about a tablespoon total.  It turned out really amazing with these changes!  I cooked these beans in the crockpot for about six hours on low.

I am a southern food snob... and these green beans hit the spot! I used 1/4 cup of apple cider vinegar instead of the white distilled. I think this tastes better with the beans. I backed off a little on the salt, added seasoned salt, and two splashes of liquid smoke and Worcestershire sauce each. Oh yes. and a pinch of crushed red peppers. 

I cooked the concoction in a pressure cooker which saved on the time. 25 mins on pressure and your beans are done!

I have bee looking fo a recipie for green beans for a long time and I think I have found it. It came out great but I varied the recipie a bit. Instead of water, I used chicken broth. I used apple cider vinegar instead of plain vinegar and I cooked them in a crock pot for 7 hours on low instead of on the stove top. They came out excellent even though I used frozen beans. I will use this recipie whenever I make green beans. My only complaint is that there weren't any leftovers.

This was super yummy!  I was at a loss for what to do for Thanksgiving (hubby hates green bean casserole) and found this recipe!  I didn't have a homhock, so I used a pound of bacon chopped up instead and it turned out great!

Very nice change to green beans.  I am from the south and my husband loves green beans well cooked but with that special flavor that I never seemed to be able to reproduce.  The vinegar made a huge difference.  I made 1/2 the amount but would cut the vinegar a little more than half.  I also added a tablespoon of sugar.  Thanks for sharing.

YUM! Ive never been a big fan of fresh green beans because I always thought they were tasteless. These were the bomb! I used bacon this time but will use the ham hock next time. Will be asking all my friends that have gardens for any extra green beans!

Delicious! I made these for our son's graduation party and everyone loved them. I only cooked them for a couple of hours though or they would have been way too soft for our taste.

If I were doing the review based on my own opinion, I would give this 5 stars.  From my perspective, these were the best green beans I've ever had.  And that's taking into consideration that I live in the deep south and people are fanatic about their beans here.  I cooked them on low in the crock pot overnight and LOVED the vinegar in it.  I also had to cook 6lbs of beans since we had 18 people to feed.

Having grown up in the south I thought these were absolutely delicious.  I just made another pot recently and I can't stop eating them..  I don't know why some of the reviewers are hung up on the vinegar.. it adds a perfect tartness which really complements the salty ham flavor.

I LOVE this recipe! I'm from the deep south, and this recipe is amazingly southern tasting! Someone even asked me, "What is your secret ingredient?" I had to laugh because, well, there are no secret ingredients. I used three cans of green beans and the end of an already cooked boneless ham, and the recipe came out beautifully. This could not have been better!

Best green beans ever. They only thing I changed was not to add vinegar. I cooked them in a crock pot and will be making them again! Thanks for sharing.

I make these with Pole beans. Unfortunately, they are only available part of the year. I always make them for the holidays. They are great, sometimes at Thanksgiving if I don't shop early I have to go to a few stores to find them . I use chicken broth instead of water and I leave out the vinegar. The ham hock is kinda gross, but its a must for great flavor. This recipe has been on my family's table for as long as I can remember.

Didn't use ham hock because I couldn't find any at the store.  I used bacon instead but I think it would have tasted better with the ham hock.

I made these for Thanksgiving - left out the onion, used 1/2 the vinegar, 1/2 the salt (added more later but didn't want to overdue with the ham hock in there) and cooked them all day on low in a crockpot.  Heavenly!  Best green beans ever - makes me want to give away all the cans of beans in my pantry!

I had to cook my first family Thanksgiving this year, so I was trying green bean recipes out ahead of time. I love fresh green beans so this appealed to me. I cut the recipe down for two and ended up eating the whole thing myself. My son just likes things out of the can plain so it was to different for him but I didn't mind it was more for me! I never knew how my grandma made them, and it was to late to ask her, but this tasted like hers. I was thrilled! I didn't use the recipe for Thanksgiving because my daughter begged me to make them my usual way but I will definately make them more often for myself this summmer when I can buy the good fresh beans.

These are very good and will make again. However only cooked 1 hour instead of 4 and came out great. I prefer to not cook green beans such a long time. Ham hock and onions make this recipe!

I used bacon instead of ham hock, because it was all I had.  I liked the peppery, onion flavor, but not the color or texture. Tastes like the greens I usually cook. Smelled really good, though.  Looking forward to these with the ham hock next time.

Best green beans ever.  I used both fresh and frozen beans together.  Could not tell the difference when I served them.  Delicious.  I will be serving green beans a lot more often now that I have this recipe.

I prepared the string beans the day before thanksgiving.  After they finished simmering for 4 hours, I put in the freezer overnight.  They are really good!  The ham hocks seasoned the beans really good!

I ended up adjusting this recipe to our taste because it did not have flavor. I used two 3lb cans Hanover green beans and turkey smoked sausage instead of a ham hock and half the salt(sea salt). I ended up pouring half the water out. The adjustments were made after the recipe simmered. I added about 4tbs of butter, and about 2tbs of Knorr Chicken Flavor Bouillon, and 1tbs of Italian Seasoning.

I wanted to try something different with my green beans. I cooked these for several hours in my slow cooker, but I just couldn't get the taste I was satisfied with. I am pretty sure it was the vinegar that I didn't like, even though I normally like vinegar.

I expected so much better after the rave reviews, I'm so disappointed! I did not care for this - too much ham flavor, too much vinegar (and I LOVE vinegar!).  You couldn't taste the green bean flavor at all.

This was a tasty version of southern green beans.  However, the vinegar was a little potent in it and I would cut back on it in the future.

These taste just like old fashioned country style green beans. We loved 'em. 4 pounds of beans filled my crockpot to the brim and served 15 with some leftovers--but then, we had a large collection of other dishes to choose from too.

I made mine with bacon rather than a hamhock. Just before serving, I picked out the slimy pieces of bacon fat which had slow cooked. I fried a few strips of bacon, crumbled them and added the crumbles and fat to the beans. This boosted the flavor considerably.

These are really good and really easy. You can do them in the crockpot or stovetop. I have also used bacon or a chopped, smoked turkey leg in lieu of the hamhock. I no longer used canned green beans. Much like my Nanny used to make. Good memories!!!

I made these green beans just this pastThanksgiving.  My family gave me a hard time because they did not want to change from the durkee onion green bean cassarole we have every year.  But I persisted and I'm glad I did.  The beans were very good. The recipe made a large portion.  I did add a little seasoning salt and doubled the ham hock.

Great!  I made it for Thanksgiving last week.  I made a couple changes to add flavor though.  I omitted the onion since my boyfriend is incredibly picky and just slipped onion powder in to be sneaky. :)  I also added about a tablespoon each of kosher salt and ground white pepper and one piece of thick sliced bacon, which I just removed after cooking.  I'll be using the recipe next year.  Thanks!

These were delicious.  I didn't have enough time, so they only cooked for 2 hours, but they were still wonderful.  I can't wait to try these again with the full 4 hours of cooking time.

I made this for the first time this afternoon in preparation for Thanksgiving 2 days from now.  I followed directions from another reviewer--David L. Wasson-- to cook the broth & ham hocks (2 of them)  for 2 hours, then add the beans for the next  2 hours.  I also used 1.5 tablespoons of cider vinegar.  Part of the broth was chicken stock.  I did add some minced garlic but not too much.  I did NOT add any onions since some folks did not care for it.  Perfect!  None of the guests have tried it yet, of course, but my hubby and I love these green beans!  I saved about half of the broth with the beans for reheating on the big day.  Update:  12/3/2019  The beans kept well and reheated well in a crockpot a few hours before serving.  Guests LOVED these beans!!

This was not a hit for Thanksgiving. Onions, and pepper were powerful and not enough salt. Kids didn’t like it at all for sure. I won’t be making this recipe again. Good this I had traditional greenbean casserole as well.

Adding vinegar was a first for me. Hubby liked it immediately,  but I wasn't sure. I eventually came around though.  The only change though is that I use ham pieces rather than a ham hock.  So I'm giving it 5 stars.  Note: I prefer Italian green beans.  They are wider and flatter and hold their shape better when cooked.  Just a personal preference.

i cooked them on the stove in 32 oz chicken broth with a bag of kroger real bacon pieces (like what you would put on a salad).  i had no onion, so just added onion powder and some Lawry's seasoned salt.  only cook long enough for the green beans to get to the right tenderness.

Great Recipe!!! I just changed the technique a bit. I used chicken broth instead of water, added the ham hock, seasonings, and only 3 TBS vinegar, stuck them in the crock pot to reduce an hour and half. Sauted the garlic and onions in olive oil then added them, covered and reduced more then threw in the green beans. Bacon bits were last, just before serving and tore up regular bacon. Excellent Recipe thanks for sharing!

These are great and when I get them to this point, I like to add 2 Tablespoons of butter, 3 - 4 Tbsp of  dark brown sugar and enough Worshestershire sauce to melt the brown sugar and warm it all enough to coat the green beans. Wonderful!!  Try it, you'll Like it!..

Best green beans I have made to date.  I was already roasting a pork shoulder, so I used a chunk of that instead of a ham hock and it worked wonderfully.  I only used 2.5# beans, and crumbled crispy bacon into the pot right before serving.  I can't wait to eat some leftovers!

I used smoked turkey instead of ham hock.  I think that is why I did not prefer this too much.  I think the vinegar did not like the smoked turkey.  I may try again with ham hock.

Delicious.  Had no ham hock so I used half juice from the ham I was cooking and half water and added three slices of uncooked thick sliced bacon.  Local fresh beans looked bad so I used frozen and they came out just fine.  Very tasty.

These green beans rock!  I used shallots instead of onion and it turned out perfect.
