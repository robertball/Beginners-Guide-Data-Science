This a light and tasty recipe.  I really enjoyed the light maple flavor.  It's great for a summer dessert.

I added a little more ice cream and a little more maple syrup, tossed in a couple ice cubes and whipped it all up in the blender and had a nice, light, frothy milkshake.  A keeper.

Turned this into a milkshake rather than a float, had to add more maple syrup for a good flavor. A very tasty spin on regular old milkshakes [or floats].

This is an interesting idea.  I love maple syrup, so I decided to try it.  It's not quite what I envisioned.  I think it would be better blended into a shake, like one reiviewer did.  It was fun and easy to try though!

This drink was delicious in shake form. Little sister loved it, hope to make it again soon.
