This was not as good as I was hoping it would be. There's far too much bacon, and using all the grease makes everything really greasy. And other than that, there just wasn't much flavor. This needs some onion, herbs, less bacon, and more seasoning. I added some bacon to the sauce at the end, and saved some for garnishing. I also wouldn't put the cherry tomatoes in at the beginning of making the sauce either. Put them in at the end for better flavor. This recipe needs a bit of help in the flavor department.
