This is a great recipe, 5 star, the only thing I will add next time is a maybe a tablespoon of cornstarch to the berries to help retain the juice.

OMG this recipe was horrible!  What in the name of all that is holy did you people see in this recipe?  It looked horrible after baking, it took forever to bake, I baked it for over 40 mins at the recommended temp to give up and finally pull it out of the oven cause it was so runny looking in the middle.... and what is with the crumb topping on top, it does nothing for the pie.  Maybe if you used graham crackers or something instead of plain bread crumbs?  The flavor wasnt even right, I was embarrassed to serve this just by the look of it, but even more so that I wasted money on the ingredients of this and my time and it tasted "off".  I used all fresh ingredients, and it was bland and lifeless.  I have had 99% success with every recipe I have tried on this site, but this was the worst.

The recipe as is isn't that good. We could taste the flour in the sour cream mixture, the crumb topping should be eliminated or replaced with a better crumb mixture, the flavor was bland, and there needs to be more sugar. 
IF I were to try this recipe again I'd make some changes. For the sour cream mixture I'd use 1/4c flour, an additional 2T or so of sugar, and 1t vanilla extract. In the berries I'd add 2T sugar and 1T cornstarch and wouldn't bother with a crumble topping.

This pie was very nice and not too sweet. I used blackberries instead of raspberries and as I only had about 1 cup of sour cream, substituted the other cup with berry flavoured no fat yoghurt. Turned out beautifully and was very well received!!

My five year old (I helped a little) made this pie for Easter.  EVERYONE loved it, and it was super easy!  However, the nine inch pans seemed a bit too big.  I will either use 8 inch next time, or make a little extra custard to fill the pans more.

This pie is delicious.  I made it for Thanksgiving.  It dissapeared way before the traditional pumpkin.  Everyone loved it.  I made it again but used mixed berries instead of just raspberries.  Absolutely delightful...and very easy.

This was so good! I used frozen raspberries, followed the recipe exactly, and it fit perfectly into a prepared frozen Pillsbury deep dish pie crust. It took less that ten minutes. I doubled the recipe and baked two at the same time. Everyone loved them. Even the kids! I will make again and experiment with other fruits.

This pie is one of my favorites.  The only thing I do, as some others have said, is add cornstarch to the berries, it can be a bit runny otherwise.  Great recipe!

This pie was very good.  I did make a few changes, it was very runny so I put it in the fridge, it was alot better cold and set up nice.  I also used a brown sugar, flour, and butter crumb topping instead.  My family loved it!

I purchased the frozen triple berries at Costco, which worked very well. Rather than make the bread crumb topping, I just crushed some vanilla wafers and sprinkled over the top of the pie.

I really liked this pie.  I followed people's advice and put cornstarch in the berries as well as using Lorna Doones for the crumble.  What I didn't love was how disparate the flavors were.  Next time I would use confectioners sugar in the berries and less sugar in the sour cream.

I really love the flavor of this pie. Not your typical raspberry pie.  I did not give it 5 stars because I did not like the crumb top and used a more traditional one, (or my quick one by mixing 1 pkg of instant brown sugar oatmeal with a little soft butter).  It can get a little runny sometimes, so a little extra flour or cornstarch isn't a bad idea.

This pie was very good, and easy to make. We did not add the crumb mixture to the top, and it still came out looking beautiful. Thanks, Holly

I've cut the servings to 8 from 16 and simply added more raspberries then allocated and this turned out amazing! So good it was gone within 24hrs, I've uploaded a photo for your viewing.

This pie is delicious! My husband ate 3 pieces. I made it according to the recipe and did not find it too 'floury'. The only modification I made was making it in a spring-form pan with an homemade Graham cracker crust. Not too sweet. Delicious tart taste from the fresh raspberries. Delicious!!

Excellent! I use cornstarch instead of flour, like the others recommend. I also mix in some raspberry or strawberry yogurt if I have some in my fridge. No matter how I make it, less sugar, add yogurt, etc etc, it always turns out great. This is a pie that you can't mess up!

I added a few teaspoons of Tapioca to the mixture and had a nice firm pie.  Lower fat sour cream worked well too.  We didn't put the topping on and thought it was quite tasty without it.

The taste of this pie is wonderful.  The only thing I might do differently next time is to add a bit of cornstarch to thicken the mixture a bit.  If you don't let it cool completely, it will be a bit soupy, but still very good.  Didn't bother me a bit.  We also tripled the crumb topping.  I think the amount listed is nowhere near enough...at least for my liking!

Baked very nice.  I was hoping it would be a little sweeter, but that was probably my fault for using some raspberries that weren't completely ripe yet.  Overall a good pie.

This was fantastic. I really don't understand how anyone had any problems with it. I too didn't add the bread crubs, and it was just great. It is a little juicy, but it was perfect. I served it warm, and the company that I served it to commented that it was the best dessert she had ever tasted.

I'm a sucker for raspberries, so I knew as soon as I saw this reciped that I'd have to try it.  I made it with frozen raspberries, omitted the crumble topping and love it, love it, love it.  Only thing I would change next time is pouring some of the juice off the berries before I make the pie - I don't care much about how it looks, but it got a little messy with all the juice.

LOVE IT!  My husband and I have never been a fan of fruit pies.  I tried this one with my Mom's leftover raspberries - it is now a popular request!  Great blend of raspberries and sour cream.

This was easy and tasty.  Nice contrast of the berries and the sour cream.  I will also try it with rhubarb and blueberries.

Love, love, love this pie. I would bet I have made it five times so far.  I had trouble with the pastry shell getting cooked long enough, so I tried a graham cracker crust instead.  As long as you don't cook it toooooo long, it works out well.  I also multiplied the topping times four (I only doubled the butter).  That makes a really nice topping.  I can't recommend this simpler recipe enough!

A great recipe.  Use any berries.  Just taste your berries first and add up to 1/4 C sugar if they are little tart.  I made it Gluten Free with a gluten free pie crust that I rebaked for 10 minutes at 400.  I used no flour.  I used 1/4 cup corn starch in the liquid.  Perfect.

It came out really good for us. It is on the sour side but I'm ok with that, probably our raspberries are sour. I did what other people recommended: rolled the raspberries into corn starch but I followed the recipe as it was otherwise.

Used a graham cracker crust, brushed with egg and baked for 5 minutes in 375 degree oven before filling. Then just threw the remaining egg in with sour cream mixture and used corn starch instead of flour. Omitted bread crumb topping. Used frozen raspberries that had been thawed and drained. Pretty good!

Absolutely delicious, easy, everyone wants seconds and thirds !!!! And they want the recipe. I would give 10 stars,if I could... I only make one pie from the recipe. I make everything exactly as the recipe calls for, except I cut the topping in half as I am only making 1 pie. I up the cooking time about 15 min. because it is a very full pie. Also make sure you line your oven, as it will boil over a little, or use larger pie pan. I use frozen raspberries and do not thaw them prior to adding to batter... I have made it with and without the topping, delicious either way. Will make over and over. A favorite with family and friends... Keeper for sure. I am going to try other fruits, and berries with same recipe, found one on this site using pears. Friend brought me two quarts of canned pears tonight, because they loved the raspberry pie,so much. This is the first review that I have given, but this site has thousands of great recipes and I have not had a bad one yet. Many thanks to Allrecipes.com and all the great cooks for their great recipes...

I thought this pie was absolutely delicious; even my mom (who hates sour cream) loved this pie. I altered the recipe slightly to fit my family's tastes, by using only one 16oz tub of sour cream (which equals about 1 cup) and I doubled the crumb topping. It's also great with Peaches or Blueberries. Thanks Holly for this wonderful twist...it's delicious!
