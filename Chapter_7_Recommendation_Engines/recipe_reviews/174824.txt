I normally don't bother trying company-placed recipes, but I was very happily surprised!  I really wanted a cake that was a little bit fall, a little bit different, and for the birthday person I intended it for-- it couldn't be chocolate.  So I gave this a try and I am SO glad I did.  I did the cake as directed, except for 2 things: I didn't use pumpkin pie spice, I added some cinnamon, clove, and nutmeg to my own taste.  And I didn't use the canned frosting-- the fact that they even suggested it is why I took a star off.  I used a super easy cream cheese frosting recipe (on this site it is called Cream Cheese Frosting 2, I think) and the cake got rave reviews for taste and presentation both.  Definitely adding it to my recipe box!!

This recipe was wonderful.  I took it to a board meeting and 6 people ate the whole thing!  Because I do not care for nuts, I used toffee bits instead and it tasted awesome!  I also made my own cream cheese frosting because I like it better than the purchased kind.  Be sure to take the cakes out of the pan after 5 minutes or you will have the top stuck in the pan.  I will definitely keep this in my dessert file.

I followed the recipe exactly.  Very easy & quick to put together. At first I wasn't sure about the caramel/pecan topping that goes in the bottom of the pan.  I thought it would be too sloppy for a layer cake.  Nothing to worry about - it was not a huge amount.  Just enough to give a caramel like glaze with some crunchy pecans embedded in the caramel.  It was very secure on the cake. Excellent touch.  The cake part was good but it could have been better - maybe with more spice?  Maybe a spice cake mix would have produced better results? I bet it would.  But this recipe is delicious.  I iced my cake with homemade cream cheese frosting that I made into pumpkin cream cheese frosting at the last minute when I realized I still had some pumpkin filling left in the can. The pumpkin turned the frosting a light orange color with just a hint of pumpkin flavor.  On top of the cake I drizzled homemade caramel sauce and topped with toasted pecans. Very attractive - very rich and very delicious.

What a delicious cake! (I've made 2) Reminds me of carrot cake and pumpkin pie all wrapped into one tasty desert. Great for the holidays! I did however make my own cream cheese icing, much better than store bought and very easy to make. I also used walnuts mixed with pecans. Will definitley make again!!

This was so simple and tasty.  A great way to dress up a box mix.  I put it in at 375 by accident so the praline part burned a little but everyone still thought it was great and said it didn't taste burnt at all.

I made this for my daughter's birthday and everyone loved it.  Very elegant looking, very tasty and it's not that hard to do.

We served this as an alternative to pumpkin pie for an early Thanksgiving dinner, and it was a hit!  We put it together just as the recipe indicated. I probably would have baked it for a few minutes more, as it was really sticky/gooey toward the middle. Definitely a keeper - next time we're going to try it in a 9x13 pan so we can serve it in squares for easier portioning.

I was VERY disappointed with this recipe...tasted very much like a cake from a box (which of course it is, but I thought with the positive reviews and additional ingredients, it would elevate the recipe).

This is definitely one of the most delicious cakes I have ever made! Even people who aren't big fans of pumpkin rave over it! All my friends and family request this one when we have carry-in dinners. You can't mess it up!

I made this Cake for our towns annual "Pumpkin Festival".  It turns out just like the picture and makes a wonderful presentation.  I made my own cream cheese frosting as I don't care for canned frosting.  I used 1 block cream of cheese, 2 TBS Butter, 4-8 TBS milk and a bag of powdered sugar.  I waited until it was all cooled before I assembled it.  I will add in later how the cake places in the baking contest :)

I make this every year at Thanksgiving *WITH ONE CRUCIAL SWAP!* Do NOT use the canned frosting with this recipe. Step up with a scratch cream cheese frosting, with pumpkin spice folded in.
