Thank you for an awesome tzatziki recipe without dill or mint (I had none). I went through browsing a ton of tzatziki recipes on this site and finally stumbled on this one. I had to scale the recipe down as I was only making this for 3 people. I used a half a cucumber, grated it the put in a sheet of bounty towel paper and squeezed the water out, then repeated the step with another fresh towel paper. I also filtered 2% milk yogurt since I had no Greek yogurt, I used about 3/4 of a cup since it was gonna shrink when it lost moisture. I then combined the yogurt, cucumber, 3/4 cup of light sour cream, 2 cloves of garlic, and about 1 tbsp of evoo. Refrigerated for about 2 hrs. It was perfect with the "Greek potato stew" from this site and lemon pilaf and Greek salad. I will no longer buy store made tzatziki, this was so easy to make and better tasting. The key is in getting the moisture out of the cucumbers and yogurt (if your not using greek yogurt)

Couple of things: I've never seen Greek yogurt at any store so I just buy regular, and spoon it into a coffee filter. The moisture drains away in no time, and it's an excellent substitute for Greek yog. Secondly, English cucumbers are sometimes called Hothouse cucumbers. Hope that helps.

Thanks for all the great reviews everyone! For those of you who are looking for a low-fat recipe - Whole Foods Market (or probably any other natural foods supermarket) carries a FAT FREE Greek Yogurt, so you still get the thickness, and the great taste! If you choose low fat sour cream over the regular, make sure to drain the water. And for those of you who aren't sure what English Cucumbers are, they are sometimes called something different in the Supermarket - but always come fully wrapped in plastic! Thanks again!

I went to Greece over the summer, and I absolutely loved the tzatziki there. I couldn't wait to find an authentic recipe. This is it! I didn't add anything, and it was perfect- just like what I had in Greece. It really makes a lot, so when I am not entertaining, I will scale it back. Thanks for the great recipe! Spring for the English cucumbers.

I used fat free Greek yogurt and reduced fat sour cream and added a teaspoon of lemon juice and a little dried oregano (a teaspoon or so, I didn't measure). I didn't have english cucumbers--just regular cukes. We had this as a snack for Movie Night with homemade pita chips. Really good. We didn't miss the extra fat. The kids absolutely loved it.

This recipe is just like my baba used to make- traditional greek sauce!! I added nothing and it didn't need anything because traditional greek sauce doesn't have anything else! The greek yogurt makes it!
Thanks for sharing- its a keeper!

Great, refreshing dip.  I cut the recipe in half.  What is missing is fresh dill and a bit of lemon. I used reduced fat dairy.

Excellent recipe! I vacationed in Crete for 3 weeks in January 2007. So, I know what authentic tzatziki sauce is suppose to taste like. This recipe is definitely right up there!

Good, but this tasted too much like sour cream. I think this would have been fine using greek yogurt as the base.

I loved this sauce, it is very authentic. The only thing I added was a tablespoon of dill per my taste. However, I am sure the recipe is just as good without it.

I used fage 0% yogurt, and light sour cream to make this lighter. It is very tasty. I am Greek and this is an authentic Tzatziki dip. It is light and adds flavor not coats the meat.

I truly appreciate heritage recipes and try to prepare them as exact as possible so that I get the full effect. With this Tzatziki sauce, I did switch the amounts of yogurt vs. sour cream as I didn't have enough sour cream on hand and I like the yogurt "zing".  I will say I liked the smoothness that the sour cream gave the final product. I prepared everything else exact to the recipe given. However, I was underwhelmed. It was very bland. I understand that it's authentic but - to my personal taste - it was bland. I added salt, that was a help. I then added dill as I love dill in my Tzatziki and that made a world of improvement however it was still lacking something. On the advice of my daughter, I added fresh lime juice. SUCCESS!  It finally made my mouth sing! I understand this is a traditional and authentic recipe but sometimes traditional and authentic doesn't suit everyone's palate. This was one of those times.

Made this recipe to use with "Feta-Stuffed Hamburgers" from this site.  It was delicious and was the perfect topping for the hamburgers.  It kept well in the refrigerator for days later.  I had bought from our favorite Greek restaurant fresh-made pitas to go with this dip also.  It is a keeper JessNeo - thanks for sharing.

Good, and very easy to make.  I thought it was a bit too thick though, and it makes a LOT of servings.

Yum! Next time I'll probably do more yogurt and less sour cream, but even so, this was divine stuff. We used it with the feta turkey burgers stuffed into pita pockets with lettuce and tomato. My 2-year-old used it as a dip for his grape tomatoes. We were all impressed.

Was delightful as is, yum! But I like dill and lemon so I added 2 lemons juiced and 1 bunch of Dill minced. I gave it 4 stars because I have still tasted better. But I will definately make again!

This recipe was delicious! It was even better than some of the sauces I've had at the local Greek restaurants. It was simple to make and the only thing I added was extra garlic. I will definitely be using this recipe again!

My husband and I love gyros and are always trying new tzatziki sauces at home hoping to replicate the kind we find in our favorite restaurant.  This is the closest I have come so far, but I do wish the end results was a little thicker.  I made this the day before and added a bit more salt.  Yum! UPDATE 5/20/11: I made this for my husband's birthday and switched the ration of sour cream :: greek yogurt.  The end result was closer to the thick consistency I was looking for.

This is an excellent sauce.  I served it with Solvaki on this site. I also added a pinch of sugar.

YUM!!  This was great!  We used it with souvlaki, but finished it up on baked potatoes for a fresh change from sour cream.

Good.  Added dried dill weed to half of the batch.  This is a great recipe made as stated, but I really enjoyed it with the dill.

FINALLY! I have been looking for an authentic recipe, and this is IT!  Using regular lowfat plain yogurt works fine as long as you drain it by using a coffee filter in a collander for several hours.  I also added a little salt and a splash of lemon juice.  Chilling it for at least an hour or two is essential to achieve the full flavor.

This is my favorite tzatziki sauce. I found Greek Plain Yogurt at Trader Joes, it has a great thick consistancy. I sprinkle some dill on top when finished and I eat this with their pita bred or Naan Indian Bread also found at Trader Joes. So tasty!

this was fantastic, although it does taste very strongly like sour cream. This is not a complaint I put these on a feta-spinach turkey burger and they were awesome :). Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent and authentic!  I tried two other recipes on here for Tzatziki  and this is by far my favourite with one exception - I added approx 1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice (1/2 lemon).  I gave the recipe five stars because it deserves five - I just happen to like my tsztsiki with lemon. My thanks to Auntie and Jess.

Haha, it's been in all the yiayia's families! This is pretty much basic tzatziki.. :-) well, it could use a little salt and pepper and no sour cream, Greek yogurt 100%!!!! Also, take out the cucumber seeds. Yummy! Bon appetite!!

This was so delicious!  I made it a day ahead to have with warm pita and the Souvlaki recipe from this site, but it was so good that we ate it with meatloaf the same night I made it!  Luckily, there is still enough left for the Souvlaki!!  I only made a couple alterations.  I didn't add olive oil, I only used about 8 oz of Greek yogurt (that's all I had) and about 1 1/2 t of dill weed.  Even  my kids, who are suspect to "new" foods, LOVED this!  Thank you!!

Yum!  I made this for my Mother who is in the hospital and is on a renal diet.  There wasnt anything in this recipe which she couldn't have, and it's a very limited diet.  She absolutely loved it!  Thank you.

This tastes very authentic. I halved the sour cream and yogurt, peeled and seeded a regular cucumber, used a lot more garlic, added a bit of dill and lemon juice, and put it all in the blender :) We ate it with pita bread and the meat from the recipe "Awesome Spicy Beef Kabobs or Haitian Voodoo Sticks' from this site. Absolutely fabulous.

This is tasty and really easy to make. I halved the recipe and misread the ratio of sour cream to yogurt. I used a 1:1 ratio instead of the called for 2:1 ratio. After making a small sample with a 2:1 ratio, I prefer the 1:1 ratio mixture as it doesn't taste as much like sour cream.

We couldn't find Greek yogurt, so we just made the recipe with sour cream. We added fresh dill and used the sauce as a topping for gyro burgers. It was a nice combo. Served the leftover sauce as a dip with pita chips. We'll make this one again. I really liked the addition of the dill for added flavor and will add it again next time.

This sauce was delicious.  We've used it as a dip for pita bread with Greek Salad, as a sauce on tortillas rolled up with grilled chicken and veggies, spread on a turkey sandwich, etc.  It's very versitile.  Just be sure to thoroughly drain/squeeze all excess moisture out of cucumbers before mixing up.  I used a fat free sour cream and it tasted wonderful!  It's definitely better after sitting at least overnight, and the flavor only improves with time.

Many supermarkets carry 'pressed yogurt' behind the counters at the deli areas. It's the best substitute if you don't have time to drain yogurt.  A real tzatziki is NEVER runny!  (Also if you would like to do it the traditional way, don't use sour cream)

Wow!!  Yum Yum Yum!!  This was super good, the only changes I made to this was that I added just a touch of fresh mint chopped super fine and a pinch or two of kosher salt!!!  This is a keeper and will make again and again.  I served this with the "Feta & Olive Meatballs" (recipe from this site) and it was divine!!  Thanks for the recipe :-)

Delicious! I ate it all up with Gyros Burgers!  I changed the yogurt to fat free (just remember to drain it in a collander lined with a paper towel or cheese cloth so it's not too watery) and the sour cream to low fat. I also halved the recipe since it seemed like a lot and it was the perfect amount for eight sandwiches. I added salt and pepper to taste.

I added lemon zest & Tbsp of lemon juice as well as a Tbsp or more of dill. It is delicious!! After mincing the garlic, I added a pinch of salt to help mash it. ( That way I could add a tad more!) Perfect for ANYthing, lol.  ;)

My family really loved this recipe. I served it with grilled chicken gyros. Delicious! I used Fage Greek yogurt as it is already strained, and added some salt and pepper. Other than that I followed the recipe as written. Definitely a keeper!

An easy peasy and delicious recipe.  One of the more authentic  tzatziki sauces I've tried.  I did add a little dill to enhance the flavor as some others suggested.  My new go-to recipe for this sauce!

AMAZING. I made a half batch and added in some pink Himalayan salt. The key for sure is getting all the liquid out of the cucumber. Using a piece of cheesecloth does the job wonderfully and it's worth it to buy some (trust me). Paper towels would not have done the job. Will make over and over! Great for gyros, salads, and dipping.

Very good! Tasted just like the Greek restaurant. I didn’t have enough sour cream so added extra yogurt.

I made this to go atop my turkey feta spinach burgers. Haven't eaten together yet but this sauce is nice. It could use a tang or something to balance it better but good starter recipe. I will post how it was with the burger when i review the burger recipe.

I stopped by an International market near my home to pick up some gyro meat. The owner of the store asked if I needed any tzatziki sauce, and I told her I was going to make my own. She told me "make it with sour cream, not yogurt." I liked that this recipe was mostly sour cream, and I agree with her that it is better than the all yogurt versions. I used a regular cucumber and removed the seeds and squeezed out the excess water really well with a dish towel. I made it earlier in the day, and it was still nice (not runny) when I served this with our gyros tonight. Great recipe - thanks for sharing!

Oh my gosh, this is such a great recipe! It tastes just like the sauce from my favorite greek restaurant in my hometown! I'm so glad I found this because I've tried making it before with a different recipe and  it was so terrible that I ended up throwing a whole batch away. The only changes I made to this was I added a splash of lemon juice, a hint of dill weed seasoning and I used garlic powder instead of garlic. The garlic powder was actually really good because I thought using fresh garlic would be a little too strong (plus my garlic went bad :c )
Awesome recipe, thanks so much yia yia!

I'm not really into greek food that much but had to test some recipes before going to a greek event i had to attend.  I have tried tzatziki sauce in the past and this one is probably the best ones ive tasted so far.  It doesn't have mint , dill, and not straight greek yogurt.

Just like I get in restaurants.  Same spicy taste from the raw garlic as well, which is not my preference, but my husband loves it.

Perfect!  I used this on a Chicken Souvlaki and we loved it!  I had never grated a cucumber for the Tzatziki sauce - always just chopped it up.  This way is much better and the blend of spices is just right!

I went with this recipe because it did not have the mint in it. It is a nice classic recipe. I did add a smidge of crushed dried oregano. I scaled this back to six servings and it still makes a ton.

I used plain yogurt instead of greek.  next time will search harder for greek yogurt because the draining of the yogurt and cucumber was WAY too much work.  very light flavor.

This is a great authentic recipe.  I suggest straining not only the cucumbers but the sour cream & yogurt as well.  If you can't find greek yogurt, plain works well too - just strain it.  Also, a bit of greek seasoning works too!  And to top it off, a bit of dill!

This is the best sauce I have used. Greek yogurt can be gotten at Trader Joe's. It is the best. We warmed pita bread, cut into quarters and sprinkled with salt. Also good on fish, with grated lemon peel. Just like heaven!

One of the best tzatziki sauce recipes I have found.  A little too much cucumber for my taste, so I only use about 1/2 a cucumber.  I also added salt & pepper, 2 tsp. lemon juice, and 1/2 tsp. dill.  I couldn't find Greek yogurt, so I just used plain yogurt.  Very good!

Yum! I just got finished making this and it is so yummy! I used plain yogurt because our store only sells Greek yogurt in the HUGE container!! I followed the advice of others and drained the yogurt in coffee filters to get rid of the liquid. I also seeded the cucumbers, and grated them into coffee filters to drain- worked great!! My sauce is nice and thick! I am serving with Soulvaki also from this site. Thanks for a great authentic recipe that tastes wonderful!!

Wow! My kids love this with pita bread, but they love it so much, they practically lick it off the plate! Although it's better with the cucumbers, I usually leave them out. I add a little lemon juice, too. YUMMY!

Very bland.  It needed something.  I added some cumin and black pepper.  I also added extra garlic.  I didn't have dill, but I will try to add that next time.  It just tasted like plain yogurt and sour cream.  I was disappointed after the other glowing reviews.  I cut the recipe in half and it still made a lot.  I will try it again, but quartered and add a little extra spice.

I made this to go with gyros and it was perfect. It had a wonderfull cool flavor. You could also use this as a veggie dip but if you do I would recommend adding some seasonings and so on (Greek seems the best choice). I'm so glad I chose this recipe.

Very good. I'm happy to have a recipe for tzatziki sauce. This was my first time making it, and it was easy. I used nonfat plain yogurt, lowfat sour cream - and I neglected to drain them first since I forgot to read the reviews first. It wasn't too runny though, so it wasn't a big deal. I did add a bit of grated onion, and I'm not sure I'd do that again. I halved it, and it still made a ton. I used it for falafel and pitas - and will definitely make it again.

This is absolutely the kind of Tzatziki you will find if you visit Greece. Its awesome - but for those who do feel they need a bit more of a flavor kick try adding some fresh mint or a few shaks of bottled greek seasonings. Also if you are using fat free products remember to drain everything or it will be too thin.

i served it w/ a gyro burger recipe also on the site. it was really good. i sprinkled some salt on my shredded cucumber to cause it to sweat more so it wouldn't get too soupy. we used the rest for chip and veggie dip.

This sauce was just ok and was a little thin.  I couldn't find greek yogur or english cucumbers and it sounds like those make this recipe better.  Was a little sweet for my taste so I added some dill weed which helped.  Used it with the "Gyro Burger" recipe posted on this site and it did taste well on them, would have been better if a little thicker in my opinion.

Really good, but if you want to make it less fat and still good.  Use fat free plain yogurt, and low fat sour cream.  I also do not use olive oil.  For lots of flavor add a tablespoon of greek seasoning, and some lemon juice.
