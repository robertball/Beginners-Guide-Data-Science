Vanessa  Fregoso is my mom and she makes the best homemade food EVER!!!!! I eat home made dinner almost every night ( unless we go somewhere else ). I help her with the syrup but it gets messy. We eat the syrup on pancakes and waffles. Sometimes we make syrup with berries that are not- so- pretty and it still tastes good! She makes way more than syrup and I have been trying to tell her this is restaurant food. This syrup is better than bottled syrup. Try this syrup and you' ll love it just like I do !!!!!!!

I am rating this as a 3 because while it is lovely and delicious, it is not a simple syrup. It is in fact a compote. And no, I'm not "nitpicking" terminology. As chefs, mixologists at home or in industry, terms are terms. Simple as that. Again, this is a compote, not a simple syrup.

I would like to clarify a few things about this recipe: The blueberries can be strained out if you prefer just an infused simple syrup. I have found that a some of my children like the blueberries left in and some prefer not to have any, the choice is yours. The syrup will be thin and then depending on how you intend to use it, you can thicken it with a cornstarch + water combination. If you want to infuse a batter, then the original consistency should do fine (all things considered), however if you want to drizzle this over pancakes or waffles and want something closer to the consistency of pancake syrup then you should thicken this. Refrigerating this overnight will also help thicken the consistency slightly. A simple syrup by convention has equal parts sugar and water, however if this is too sweet for your intended use, and you make it again, don't forget to embrace the spirit of cooking and alter/add your own spin. Enjoy!

This was waaaayyyy to sweet.  So sweet I had to dump it.  Sweeter than true maple syrup.  You could easily cut the sugar in half and it would still be sweet enough.

I love it. I did it on french toast and it was wonderful. Only change was to add 1 tbsp of corn starch that I mixed with water before adding 3/4 of the way through because I like my syrup a little thicker.

thank you

I added in a dash of Vanilla and nutmeg. Using just a bit over the 1 cup of blueberries, I threw in about 1 tsp of corn starch to help thicken it up and had let it simmer uncovered for about 40 min or so to help thicken it up. You can add in more corn starch if you want it thick like syrup, but with the pancakes, the liquid soaks up nicely.

I made this cake because I had a huge amount of blueberries left over from a party.  I made the "Melt In Your Mouth Blueberry Cake Recipe" from this site to serve with.  I had a few friends over for dinner that night and the whole cake and syrup was gone.  My hubby said that this was one of the best deserts I have ever made and I cook A LOT!  I will for sure be making this again.  Company worthy for sure.

This is delicious! I used half as much sugar and thickened it a little with cornstarch as suggested by others. Thanks for a great and easy recipe--my family loved it!

Loved it on pancakes. 3 days later used the leftovers over ice cream at a get-together and still tasted fantastic! Scaled back on the sugar to just over 1/2 cp and was still yummy.

I bought a case of 6 oz. containers of blueberries for $2.00 at a local market.  Obviously, for that price, they were ripe and almost too squishy to eat so I found this recipe.  I used 48 oz. of blueberries, and followed the recipe, modifying it a little with 2 cups sugar, 3 tablespoons cornstarch, 2 cups water, three teaspoons lemon juice, and cooked it for a really long time.  While it was cooking we tested it on homemade pancakes.  It is delicious. You could decrease sugar a little and decrease water a little if you like it more tangy and thicker.

I made this as written, with one tiny exception. After reading that it was “too sweet” I added a bit of cinnamon. First batch tasted perfect, but did not thicken up as much as I had hoped so on the second batch I did add corn starch. Great recipe, and so versatile.

Perfect and simple.  The perfect thing to make when the blueberries go on sale.  This same recipe makes for a great blueberry jam if you boil it until it's thicker.   I used a little less sugar than the recipe called for, about 3/4 cup, and I really like it a little less sweet.

Thank you Vanessa!

I used half cup of sugar and still very sweet.  I think one cup would be too sweet.  I am going to try 1/4 cup sugar next time.  Very tasty.

On this cold January morning, I made this to go with pancakes. I only put in 1/2 of the sugar but also added a couple tablespoons of brown sugar for depth. I added nutmeg and vanilla. Used my hand blender to give it more of a syrupy consistency. Used cornstarch with water for a thickener.  It was sooo delicious! I will be making this much more often!  It is perfect!

Wonderful recipe! I was able to have my favorite, blueberry pancakes, without having to make a separate batch. Also, my daughter, who does not like blueberries, liked the syrup. 
I did use the cornstarch and water addition to make it thicker, more syrup consistency, and it worked wonderfully. I will definitely try with other fruits.

Very yummy! I added the extra tablespoon of cornstarch mentioned at the bottom of the recipe for a thicker syrup and it came out great. My blueberries were a little tart so it cut the edge off the sweetness a bit which turned out still good.

The times for heating, simmering, and boiling were way off. It took me 10 minutes to dissolve the sugar and about 35-50 min. at a slow boil to render the mixture to the point where it started to thicken. 

Unless the recipe was supposed to result with really watery syrup something was not working correctly for me.  I'm not sure where other folks get their blueberries or how big they are but my blueberries were half inch to three quarters of an inch across. That is normal in the northwest. So maybe the extra time it took to render my syrup down might be due the the size of the berries. 
Also it seemed like the end result was not very sweet. So I added an additional half cup of refined sugar and about a quarter cup of brown sugar because I like the earthier taste. 
Also my berries just seemed to be big floating golfballs so I took my puree soup blender  to the whole pot of syrup while it was still simmering. It pureed most of the berries leaving a couple of dozen of the sugar cube sized orbs floating in the mix. I would have preferred something in-between.

I made this for something different to put over pancakes. It was so easy and since berry season is upon us, I plan on taking advantage of the basic recipe. My husband and I both loved it!

We have made this a few times, it is always so flavorful and delicious on pancakes or french toast, ice cream, yogurt ... Very easy to make and store in a mason jar in the fridge. Sometimes I add a little lemon juice and vanilla but it's not necessary.

I made this recipe before. Did half recipe with fresh clean blueberries and it’s came out great!  Just made some again full recipe BUT with frozen blueberries and it did not thicken. Last time I did not add cornstarch like it suggested and it did thicken . So I suppose the recipe should suggest to use fresh blueberries and and alternate suggestion for when using frozen.  I think the frozen contain more liquid for some reason and therefore maybe the use of the cornstarch as suggested below recipe would be necessary or use less water. And it could be made with less sugar (how much I don’t know, I am yet to experiment on it) . Compote, syrup, or what it may be called it was a great way to use fresh fruit instead of store bought pancake syrup.  Overall the flavor was good.

So yummy to have fresh blueberry syrup, nice and piping hot!    Only the g i’d Change is the amount of sugar.  Little bit too sweet for my taste buds.  Otherwise, YUMMY ??

Hubby and I really liked it but I did not use straight cane sugar. I used my Truvia Baking Blend because we both have to watch our BS levels. Also it wasn’t has thick because I didn’t cook it long enough but that wasn’t a problem for us. The flavor was awesome, we love using/eating fresh produce!!

Was very good on our waffles.  Thanks for the inspiration Vanessa!  But because I will most likely use it as a topping again, next time I will double the blueberries and dial back the sugar a bit and hope the cornstarch slurry will thicken it enough.  But then maybe I will make it as stated and strain it and use it in an adult beverage.  That would be yummy too!

Way too much sugar, way too much water - I actually cut the sugar by about a third as I was making it, but still much too sweet - all I could taste was sugar. Urgh.

Easy, quick, and delicious as a topping for just about anything - Pancakes, Waffles, Ice Cream and Cheesecake are ones off the top of my head.  I cut the recipe in half....*** I did have to add a pinch of Corn Starch at the end just to help thicken to my personal preference, but that's it!

Very easy to make but I also added cornstarch to thicken . I believe a previous reviewer misunderstood when it was called ‘simple” syrup . I’m sure that in this case “simple” was meant to be interpreted as “easy”.

I will never buy bottled fruit syrup again! Very simple to make. I doubled the recipe to freeze to have ready when the berry syrup, pancake/ waffle making moment arises. This is very versatile ,and it is very easy to vary the types of berries that you can use in place of blueberries should you so desire. I used a strawberries, blackberries, and blueberry frozen medley. The waffles I made were not as good as this syrup!

Note the "Note" if you want this to make a syrup. It is not thick enough if you make this without the corn syrup. It is tasty, though.

This recipe needs improvement. It is super watery and way too sweet. And I like things sweet. I would cut the water and sugar in half, add a little corn starch, and mash the blueberries.

To be honest it was WAY too sweet. I had maybe a tablespoon of it and it made me Ill. Even my 3 year old said he didn't want to finish because "there's too much sugar."  I didn't even say that out loud before he tried it. I'm not sure it would thicken the same way with less sugar, more water and more blueberries, but I'd try it.  I also had to thicken with cornstarch and boil on med-high for almost 40 mins before it thickened to an acceptable texture.

The end result  was good. I use 3/4 cup sugar and it was overly sweet, I added the tablespoon corn starch (mixed in 1tsp water) right before boil and it still took 40 minutes for a syrup consistency. I will try again with major tweaks.

This was good and tasted fresh.  I enjoyed making and eating it on my homemade waffle, but it did not get as thick as I would have liked. I will make it again. Thank you for sharing.
