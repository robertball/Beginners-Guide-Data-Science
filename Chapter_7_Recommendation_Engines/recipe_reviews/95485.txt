This was very good! BUT, add to it... - 1/2 c. more milk - 1/2 c. honey (instead of 2 Tb.) - 1 Tb. Pumpkin Spice - 1/2 tsp Salt  Bake in a normal greased pan for 20 minutes.  Good idea!

This is without a doubt, the WORST cornbread I have ever tasted...

Tasteless and just plain awful.  If there was a zero star category, that still would be too good.  Don't even waste your ingredients on this recipe, I guarantee, you too, will be very disappointed.

To be fair, I did not follow this recipe to the t. I used applesauce in place of the oil. This made the recipe healthier and moist (some reviewers say it is dry as written), but unfortunately, the bread was still pretty flavorless.  It tasted closer to a plain polenta than a cornbread.  If I ever attemp to make it again, I will replace part of the cornmeal with whole wheat pastry flour.

Pretty good! I added more pumpkin spice, buttermilk and honey in the same amounts as the reviewer above me. I also added a fourth cup white sugar. Timidly sweet with the improvments, can't imagine what it tasted like without them!  I had them with porkchops and broccoli!
