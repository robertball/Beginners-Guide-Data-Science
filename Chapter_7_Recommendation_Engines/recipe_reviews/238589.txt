We LOVED this soup! I made the wontons a couple of days ago and froze them until I was ready to use them to cut back on some prep time. I just threw the frozen wontons in the soup and they cooked in no time. This does make more wontons than you will need for the soup, but they keep well in the freezer. I wish I would've watched the video before making them though, b/c I totally shaped them wrong, lol, but it doesn't matter how you shape them, they are wonderful and the pork filling is EXCELLENT. I couldn't find shitake mushrooms at the store, so I just used an 8oz. pkg. of sliced white mushrooms, and that was great for us. Also, I didn't have anything to do w/ the rest of the carton on chicken broth, so I just added it in the soup, as well. This was simple to make, super light and fresh tasting...a definite keeper~YUM!, YUM! YUM!! Thanks for sharing. :)

Fantastic recipe!  I threw the veggie drawer at the stock: minced garlic and ginger, some snow peas & some red pepper I had around, shredded a carrot and baby bok choy.  I have enough wontons in the freezer to make it again.

Only made the wonton part of this soup and used a different soup recipe. This was delicious! Had enough of an Asian flavour without being overwhelming! Omitted the fish sauce and sherry. This saved some saltiness and didn't need the added Sherry Flavour.

The filling was a little too salty. I would half the fish sauce. Other than that, very tasty wonton soup!

My family loved this soup! After hubby and I got everything prepped, my daughter helped me by sealing the wontons while I measured out the filling. It was a fun family thing, then we feasted on the results. As Chef John said, it was a very comforting meal.

Do not let the simplicity of this recipe fool you...it is delicious!!!
Directions are easy to follow and making the wontons was super easy and fun!  I actually made enough wontons for two batches of soup.  I froze the extra wontons and made the soup again last night which was super quick as the hard part was already done( wontons).  Definitely add a splash of Sesame oil as it truly adds a great flavor.  LOVE LOVE LOVE

When I read this recipe, I knew it would be good.  The only variation I made was to exclude the wonton wrappers.  So I guess this wasn't wonton soup by definition, but tasted phenomenal.  Very easy to put together.  Without wonton wrappers, I simply dropped the pork as little meat balls.  Kinda like Italian wedding soup.  I will make this again.

Great recipe! I made the recipe exactly as written (oh except I didn’t add sherry cause I didn’t have any). I saw another review that said it was suppose to be 1 tsp of fish sauce and not 1 tbsp, like listed. I used 1 tbsp and thought it tasted great. Not too salty. It took awhile to get use to folding the wontons and some of them did fall out when cooking, but no biggie. I also had a ton of extra wontons, so I just froze them. From the pork mixture I was able to make about 100 wontons using a 1/2 tsp of filling.

Love the flavors!

I cheated, using frozen wontons from Costco and a pound of 
 frozen shrimp.    Also added a handfull of shredded carrots. This time  I braised quarter pound of pork belly before  adding teh mushrooms. Better every time!

I used this recipe as a a basis, and tweaked some ingredients (and used store bough wontons, since I couldn't find wonton wrappers in my supermarket) .  Wonderful, filling soup!

Amazing!  I have never written a recipe review before, but this recipe deserves it and more stars!  I made it with 20 ounces of ground turkey, since we were snowed in and had no ground pork.  Used a little extra other meat mixture ingredients since it was a 20 ounce package of ground turkey.  Made well over 75 wontons (2+ packs) but they freeze well.  Allergic to mushrooms so instead I browned diced shallots, then added very small diced/minced carrots and celery to pot before adding sliced bok choy and extra green onions.  Added a 32 ounce box of chicken broth and about 16 wontons for 2 people. We loved it and both went back for seconds.  Froze rest of uncooked wontons in layers of parchment paper and can't wait to make another batch of broth to have these wonderful wontons again.  The ground turkey inside the wontons were at a temperature of 190 after gently simmering for 5 minutes in with the veggie filled broth.

I thought that this was an excellent recipe and pretty much made it as called for. Ok so I added some finely sliced carrots and green onions to the broth given that Chef John gave his blessing to add to taste. I made this for my wife and I but would not hesitate to make it again for company. Thanks Chef for the recipe!

I substituted yellow pepper and quartered brussel sprouts for bok choy since I had none on hand.  This soup was wonderfully comforting!  Thank you Chef John.

I made this vs chicken soup for sick hubby. I did not have Sherry, fish sauce or soy sauce so substituted dry vermouth, and Worchestshire sauce and used beef broth instead of chicken broth. I omitted the bok choy and added a bit of ginger powder to the broth. I will definitely make again when I have all the ingredients.

Chef  John this  is a wonderfully delicious wonton soup recipe.  I loved the pork filling very much however I used 1 1/2 lbs. of pork instead of 1 lb. with the same measurements for everything else.  I followed the recipe fully, almost.  I did steam my vegetables over my pot of broth w/mushrooms. I also steamed the wontons.  I then added the steamed vegi's & wontons to a soup bowl then added the hot broth and  mushrooms.  This kept the vegi's a little crispy, but not too much. I did not have green onions so I used leeks that I had on hand.  Also did not have sherry, but that did not matter.   My husband is not much of  a wonton soup lover, but he really enjoy the soup.  I would definitely  make this again.  Yum!

Pretty good  recipe with some additions: used ground turkey instead of pork and green onions and the wontons were delicious! Didn't have fish sauce or sherry. Still yummy. Used chicken broth and added a tablespoon each of soy sauce and ginger (go easy on the ginger if you aren't a fan) and a few shakes of sesame oil, grated one carrot. Brought to a boil, added wontons, snap peas and cilantro. Cooked for the 5 minutes. Make sure to added snap peas last if you like them crisp. My family loved it! Son had 3 bowls. Will make again!
