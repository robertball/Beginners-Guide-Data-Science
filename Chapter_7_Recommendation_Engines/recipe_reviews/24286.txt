These are really great!  I'm glad I read the reviews, there are a few pifalls to avoid: 1- wait until the batter hardens a little before you mix in the chocolates
2- spray or grease your cookie sheet.  The chocolates don't stick in the batter very well, you have to work it a little to make sure they don't fall off, but it's worth it, this is a great recipe!

I followed this recipe EXACTLY as written, and came out with a paper thin, sticky cookie...that after cooling became a hard disk. If anyone has any clue as to why this happened, or how to alter for fuller, plumper results; I'd like to know. The taste was very good-but presentation for a party platter was a big disappointment.

Wonderful recipe...turned out great.  But NO WAY could this recipe produce 54 cookies.  I doubled the recipe and got 48 delicious cookies.  Not big coconut fans in our house, but they taste great, so guess we can no longer say we hate coconut!  
I found that refrigerating the dough prior to dropping on cookies sheets with a cookie scoop worked wonderfully.  No gooey problems at all....just perfecto!

We liked this cookie! I did, as other users suggested, and used more flour. I ended up using 1C. and the dough turned out perfect. I chilled in the fridge for 45 mins, then added the chocolate. I only had about 1C. of M&M's so I also used some white chocolate chips and regular chocolate chips. It added some extra flavor and my kids loved them! I rolled them into balls and baked them. They held the shape perfectly and didn't come out flat at all! Make sure you don't melt the butter, just soften. That is a mistake a lot of people make when baking cookies! I will make these again. Thanks for the recipe!

These are SO easy to make!  The crumbs and sweetened milk conceal the coconut taste, so it isn't so overpowering! My son loves them, and he isn't a huge coconut fan!  These are on my list to make again, and again, and again......!

I just made these cookies. I wish I had read the reviews before hand. (I usually do). I agree with a lot of the people who mentioned them being very "soupy." I would say they are very "sticky."  However the flavor is outstanding. They taste good enough for me to try to make these again. i will put the dough in the fridge and follow all the other comments that were made. Don't give up on this recipe. The flavor is worth making it again. I do have to agree that it isn't  a cookie for company. The typical look of a cookie doesn't happen with this one. But it tastes great. I normally don't buy coconut or the sweetened condensed milk, so this won't be an "all the time" cookie. 

My main problem that I had was trying to get these bad boys off the pan. Will definitely grease the pan even though it says not to.

These were fairly easy to make, with just a couple adjustments.  Like others said before I added more flour, sprayed the cookie sheet with cooking spray, and made them fairly small.  They turned out perfect!  :)  Overall, a recipe I will use again!

Once I wasted 3 dozen cookies and figured out what was wrong, they were okay.  They spread A LOT, make them small. Also, cool longer than one minute on cookie sheet, then transfer to cooling rack.  I used a non stick cooking spray on the pan, they were nearly impossible to remove even after cooling, much easier with the spray, a must.  The flavour was good (very sweet as you can imagine) but as mentioned previously, not the nicest cookie to look at, very flat and not puffy like the photo.  Wouldn't make them again, sorry.

Was nervous about making these w/so many negatives spoken.  I did increase the flour to 1-1/4 cup & decreased coconut to 1 cup.  They look just like the picture & held shape (did not flatten).  Couldve been a tad bit sweeter.  Maybe should've used the other 1/2 cup coconut.  Next time!  :)

They're not visually appealing but they taste excellent! I've made about five batches of them now and I've discovered they turn out best when they're very small - no more than a teaspoon each when placed in the oven. They do turn out somewhat flat but the taste makes up for it. Oh, and I use cinammon graham cracker crumbs. Yum!

The dough seemed soupy as mentioned before baking, but the cookies turned out delicious and a bit chewy. The m&m's did not melt at all. They are delicious.

So many things wrong with these cookies I don't know where to start.  Most have already been said.  Following the recipe as directed it is very soupy... must add more flour.  Also, because of the condensed milk the coating does come off the M&Ms leaving the candy its self white and the coating then sticks to the cookie sheet.... even the nonstick ones.  What a mess.  Final result... a very bland cookie.  Better off using your regular chocolate chip cookie recipe replacing the choco chips for M&Ms.

These are the best cookies ever!  Have made several batches and kids and adults LOVE them!  My kids say they don't like coconut-thats how little you can taste it.  Remember to use sweetened condensed milk NOT evaporated milk.  Spray cookie sheet with non stick spray and I baked mine for 12 minutes.  Came out perfect!!

Am a beginner...and i had fun making these cookies. They were absolutely amazing. The key ingredients are the condensed milk and coconut. Tip for those with gooey dough: refrigerate the dough for about 30-40min makes it more manageable. Delicious cookies and u can always add or reduce the amount of m&m candies

This recipe made some amazing cookies, the dough was not soupy at all as other reviews said. They baked up perfectly crispy and chewy all at the same time. I agree with placing the dough in the fridge for a few minutes so it's not as sticky.  I did not have the colored chocolates so I used chocolate chips however they again are some of the best cookies I've ever had.

I used gold chocolate-covered candies, along with the green and red, for part of my Christmas 2009 baking.  They were different, looked pretty, and our families on both sides enjoyed them.

Luckily I didn't have the problems everyone else did with them sticking to the cookie sheets.  The only things I would change is to at least double the recipe because it definitely does not make much and I'm personally not a big fan of coconut so I would cut it back by about 1/2 cup.  Other than that, these were simple to make and very tasty!  Thanks!

Even those who aren't fond of coconut ate one or two (although I did reduce the coconut to 1 c).  Great cookie Lynn.  I won't be saving this recipe for the holidays...I'll be making these treats year-round!!

This recipe is really, really tasty.  Especially when you're looking for something a little different.  Careful though, they are a little bit tricky getting off the pan w/o ruining their gooey undersides.  My whole family loved them.

OK I was a bit worried after reading the other reviews. I followed some suggestions and I refrigerated the dough for about an hour before baking. The cookies came out great. Very festive and yummy.

Followed directions exactly, but came out way too soupy.  I just added another cup of flour and it was better, but the colors of the candies mixed together because of how runny it was, so they came out reddish-brown with white candies instead.  Very dissappointing.

They were easy enough and tasted pretty good, but nothing amazing like so much that you get at this time of year.

These are a big hit at my house. They are requested often. I make them exactly as recipe is written. I see people commenting that they stick to the baking sheet. If you haven’t purchased silicon baking mats yet this is your perfect excuse!  They slide right off. I love mine.

I made mine with butter shortening and it did not come out watery at all, I would like to add to put the m&m's before you put it in the fridge, you really don't have to cause with the shorten it doesn't need to. I did double it and it you plan on it use a cup of the butter shortening and add 2 tablespoons of water to substitute the the melted butter.

They stuck so bad to the pan! Lost about a half dozen cookies. And that was with cooking spray!  The taste was amazing.

The graham cracker crumbs gave it a nice taste and the coconut wasn't overpowering.  They did stick to the cookie sheet though and several broke trying to get them off.  I will probably make them again.
