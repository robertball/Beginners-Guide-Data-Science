I make this recipe alot- it's one of our favorite sweet potato recipes. I usually double the sugar\spice mixture and I skip all the steps- I just coat the sweet potatoes with oil and then with the sugar/spice mixture... it comes out really good.

The taste can't be beat, and the recipe is a wonderful way to get different vegetables to your family, BUT, way to much oil! It was too hard to try to strain the oil off after baking and I didn't want to put them on paper towel for fear of losing the wonderful sauce it created! I had doubled the recipe and I forgot the lime as well.  I would recommend using a seasoned stoneware baking dish and just lightly coat the potatoes before tossing w/seasonings.  That way you don't have oil to deal with after they are baked.

My family just loved this but with feeding a diabetic I used olive oil and Brown Sugar Splenda. I just tossed everything into a pan and stirred once or twice.  Nothing stuck to the glass baking dish and you couldn't tell it wasn't pure brown sugar. Note: Always use half the brown sugar splenda to what a recipe calls for.

This is a great recipe! I used olive oil, added some cayenne pepper, and forgot all about the lime juice (I would have tried it if I remembered). I sliced thin (1/2 inch) slices and cooked at a higher temp (425) since I had something else in the oven at the same time. Easy to make, goof proof, and very tasty! Thank you!

Great dish, the lime is a good touch.  Do not overcook the potatos in the oven oil start.  Easily could happen.  Crowd pleasure and not to sweet as most of these dishes are.

this is a great new way to serve sweet potatoes and I loved the lime juice at the end.  I used just a little less than 1/4 cup of oil and had no grease problem

I also forgot the lime juice at the end, but this was an instant hit with the family!!  Mine didn't come out too greasy at all and it wasn't too sweet either - just tasty!!!  I used Canola oil to keep the cholesterol down, and I also tipped it into a large mixing bowl to stir it a couple of times during cooking as 3 "decent" sized yams filled my casserole dish and I just couldn't stir them in the dish.  Will DEFINITELY make this one again and again and again!!!

I find it much easier to combine the chopped potatoes in a plastic bag with the olive oil and other ingredients. It provides an even coating and I can usually get away with adding less olive oil than the original recipe calls for. Always a hit!

This was great, very well received by my very picky family.  I added ground ginger, a little more cinnamon and a little more oil then mixed everything in the baking dish. It is excellent without the lime but incredible with it!!  Hope you enjoy this receipe as much as we did!!

Excellent!  Everyone at the Thanksgiving table who ate them loved them.  I tossed the potatoes with enough oil to coat them lightly then roasted them at 400 F for 20 minutes.  Tossed again with brown sugar mixture and continued roasting another 10 minutes until done.  I did not need to drain the potatoes because they weren't greasy.  Squeezed the fresh lime on top to finish.  Nice touch.

I think it would benefit people to know the size of the chunks of potatoes the recipe submitter used, because that plays a huge role in cooking time. Mine were cut into 1/4 slices and they didn't cook all the way through in 30 minutes. As far as flavor goes, it's the usual sweet potato flavor (we didn't have lime juice on hand).

Very good.  Nice to have a new way to do sweet potatoes.  I followed the suggestions of others and put the cut potatoes in a zipper bag and tossed with the oil prior to putting in the oven.  Also, i doubled the brown sugar and cinnamon and did not use the lime.  Made it nice and syrupy (I like that though).  No problems with the oil, as some have said.  Cooked for about 15-20 min after adding sugar mixture.  This recipe is a keeper!

This was wonderful.  I reduced the oil to 2 T. canola oil, and I left the skins on the sweet potatoes so I didn't miss all of the great nutrients sweet potatoes have to offer :)  For the leftovers, I added them to my salads during the workweek - it was a nice way to spice up the usual old boring salad.

these made a nice side dish with my christmas dinner.  i cut way back on the oil after reading reviews of greasy potatoes and i think that was a very good idea.  i did not add the lime juice either.  most people seemed to like these better than the super syrupy candied sweet potatoes i've made before.  thanks!

Very tasty, liked by the whole family. I reduced the oil as per others and they were not oily at all. I did not use the lime juice and do not think they lacked anything. Easy and tasty!

Really delicious. While I'm sure they would be great without the lime juice, it really adds that extra YUM and something out of the ordinary. I probably used more lime than the recipe called for, and will be extra generous with it next time too.  I'll be making this for Thanksgiving!

This recipe is delicious.  I did not use the lime either.  When the potatoes were cooked, I simply propped the dish up and let the excess juices and oil run to one end, then I dipped the potatoes out into another bowl.  I chose this method over the paper towel so my potatoes held onto all their sauce.  Easy and delish!

These were delicious! I used 3 good-sized sweet potatoes, sliced about 1/4 in. thick. I thought the baking time was a little off, 30 minutes was not near long enough, but maybe their potato pieces were smaller.  I also used approx 1/4 c of oil and did not have a problem with them being greasy like some others did. I did not pour the oil in and bake first, rather I tossed them in a bowl with the oil and then baked. Did not try the lime juice, but would like to.  Without it they are great, so don't let not having lime juice stop you from trying the recipe.

Mine actually took a little LESS time to cook than the recipe states. They are perfectly seasoned with the spice mix and we all loved them! I actually forgot the lime juice at the end and I will definitely try it next time cause it sounds like it would have been good. Thanks!

My husband and 3yr old LOVED this dish !!! I diced up one large sweet potato and added 4 apple/chicken sausages diced up and 2 apples diced up to the dish.  This is definitely going into regular rotation :)

I was totally pleasantly surprised with this recipe. It's really good. I scaled to 2 servings because I only had 1 Sweet Potato. It might have messed up the oil ratio, so I drained it after the first 20 minutes. Very good, I really like the splash of lime.

Love this. We've tried several times & always forget to put the lime juice on.(we'll just have to sacrifice & try again) do need to use less oil. The 1st time we made this it was way to oily, 2nd time fantastic. (we also reduce salt portion)

YUM!! These are so good! I used a bit less oil and, because I like my food flavorful, I doubled the sugar and spices. It took about an hour of baking until they were soft, not half an hour.

I thought these were really good. I didn't have the lime juice so I didn't use it, but I think they were fine without it. I did have to bake mine for about 10-12 minutes longer than the recipe calls for (once the sugar mixture was on them) but I think that was just that I didn't slice them thin enough. I also think maybe I will use a little more of the sugar and cinnamon next time. They were great, but I am used to them being a little sweeter.

These were fantastic! Unlike some of the other reviewers, I did remember the lime juice. I was skeptical -- but it did add to the flavor nicely. I will definitely make these again.

I made this last year, using the suggestion of less oil and a seasoned stoneware pan. Who needs traditional syrupy sweet when you can have loads of flavor? Love it! Definitely doing it again this Thanksgiving and Christmas...and any other time. The lime is a great touch.

Yum, yum, yum!!! These were absolutely fantastic and paired nicely with the Italian sausage subs we had for dinner! My hubs wasn't fond of these, but he isn't a fan of sweet potatoes or sweet side dishes anyways. :( Because I knew I'd be the only one eating these, I halved everything (I used 2 good sized potatoes). I had WAY more leftovers than I expected - but I put them to good use. I mashed my leftover potatoes to create a delicious side to go with the salmon I prepared the next evening! Oh, and if you forget the lime, you are missing out!!! It makes these even MORE amazing!!! Thanks SO much for sharing your recipe, TIA_DAWN! I'll be adding this to my "keeper" file for sure. :-)

It takes longer than expected, next time I'd combine all the ingredients right from the start and bake them for 40 mins. Not sure about the lime, maybe the next time I'll try without to compare it.

These reminded me of Chrstimas! I made some modifications. I tossed 1/3 inch thick yams in the oil (reduced to 2 tbsp of olive oil) and the remainder of the ingredients (except lime and also eyeballed the salt) and baked for 40 mins at 425C. They took longer to bake than I had expected but it was worth it! I served with a wedge of lime on the side.

This was really easy to make. I had two small-med sweet potatoes that I cut up and baked in my toaster oven.  I lightly sprayed them with canola oil. After the 20 min I decided to toss them with meltd butter and the rest of the ingredients.  The lime at the end really does give it a nice kick.

Forewent the oil browning all together since I used already soft cooked canned yams. Even though the title of the recipe is about cinnamon I simply used brown sugar alone and didn’t think I would like cinnamon. To retain their moisture I baked the yams dotted with pats of butter with the brown sugar. Leary, I even did the drizzle of lime juice at the end just because I had some on hand. Didn’t think it did much for it either way. Hubby likes the buttery sugary yams and baking them was better than the microwave sugary version I usually do. I am not a health nut but this is an easier and healthier way to go than the cream and marshmallows loaded sweet potatoes. Leave out the oil bit and use healthy margarine and you’ve got something acceptably tasty and acceptably healthy.

Finally I have found a sweet potato recipe that my husband loves but is not loaded with fat, sugar, and calories. I used frozen sweet potato julienne "fries."  I sprayed the pan and fries with olive oil spray and used no other oil. After baking them at 400 for 10 minutes, I added the sugar cinnamon mixture (half as much since I used fewer potatoes) and baked them 10 minutes more. Fabulous--and easy!

I Love this and make it every time young ones come for dinner (Ok I also make it when it's just adults!!!)  I've taken it one step further by roasting them on the bbq.  WAY less oil this way.  after 10 minutes I bring them in toss the spices and put them back on th ebbq for 5-10 minutes.

Delicious

Great flavor but I had to cook it longer but it may have been due to the thickness of my slices. I forgot to add lime juice and I used olive oil as well.

Just made these for thanksgiving and they were a hit, left out the lime as they are $2.50 each in Australia right now but it would have been a beautiful complimentary flavour touch.

These were very tasty, and well liked by even the sweet potato hater in the family. The only change I would make is to reduce the oil, I found the recipe as written a little too greasy.

I made this recipe for the first time today.  I didn't have the lime but I promise to try it next time.  The potatoes turned out fantastic and very tasty.  I had read the reviews and went easy on the oil and I think next time I'll go even easier on it so they are a little more crisp, but that's not the fault of the recipe, just my taste.  Yummy!

I made these for Thanksgiving 2010, they were a hit!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I did not add any lime juice.  There were only a tiny bit leftover after dinner, which my mother kept for herself!  This is the perfect recipe if you're looking for something that doesn't involve mashing them, or adding pecans or marshmallows.  There was just enough brown sugar in this recipe to make the sweet potatoes tasty & slightly caramelized, but without making the dish too dessert-y.

No one in my family really liked this.  It tasted like roasted carrots almost, not like sweet potatoes. Also, I cooked mine for close to an hour and they were still not quite soft enough.   There were all eaten, but will pass next time on making these;.

These were super.  Not as sweet as those marshmallow topped potatoes, but just enough sweetness to complement the sweet potatoes.  I made no changes and will do this one again for us and company!

My first attempt at this turned out a little dry, and not nearly as sweet as I expected.  Perhaps I used too many potatoes.  It would be more helpful if this recipe listed the number of potatoes needed rather than (or in addition to) the weight.  I will try again, and maybe it'll turn out better next time.

I made this for Thanksgiving & it was a hit!  I did make a few changes & simplified the steps a bit.  I cut the sweet potatoes in to smaller pieces, used olive oil & didn't measure, then just poured & mixed the potatoes until they were all glazed.  I baked for 20 minutes with just the oil, then sprinkled the cinammon/sugar mixture, stirred, and put back in the oven for the rest of the time.  I also stirred them every once in a while.  Next time I think I'll try leaving the peel on, and there will be a next time!

Very tasty, very easy to make!  Even my daughter (who won't even eat candied sweet ptoatoes) ate them and loved them!  I followed the recipes' ingredients, except I drizzled them with EVOO instead of using a 1/4 cup.  I did not have to drain them on paper...and added a touch of cayenne pepper for a kick. They were VERY tasty but a tad on the dry side but perhaps that was because I decreased the oil.....I will make again for sure.

Yummy!!! I was looking for a bit healthier recipe for sweet potatoes(without butter and cream and a ton of sugar...) and these were absolutely delicious! Made them with chicken breasts for which I used the Rosemary Roasted Turkey marinade from this site and it was so good...

First time trying diced sweet potatoes instead of mashed. I used less oil (EVOO), just enough to coat. Wow... delicious! Even my non-vegetable-eating teen tried a second bite, which is HUGE! This will be a regular at my house!

Looks good, but rated it 4 because I haven’t served it yet!
I used raw whole sweet potatoes instead of the jar recommended.  I thought it would reduce the cooking time, but it appears that it did not, so myine may be a little soft.

Awesome and Delicious recipe!  Replaced Regular Brown Sugar with Splenda Brown Sugar. Cut Sweet Potatoes into Wedges rather than Slices. Timing and Temperature are accurate. Doubled the dry ingredients for future use and stored them in a sealed container.

I was hoping for them to be a little softer since I was making them for my toddler. I was hoping for more off a syrup to be created. I am not a sweet potato fan and my toddler loved them.

I just eyeballed the recipe for 2 sweet potatoes and then added the amount of oil & sugar that seemed reasonably healthy. Like another reviewer, I just tossed the potato chunks in oil and spices and popped the whole thing in the oven. Turned out great! The cinnamon is really nice with the sweet potato flavour.

Halved the recipe; cubed the sweet potato and used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil. Also added chopped pecans. OMG!!!! This is a delicious and flavorful sweet potato side dish! I served it along with fried cabbage and a succulent  pork loin roast. A little slice of heaven! Will definitely make again!

I just made this recipe right now to try it out. I was planning on making this dish for our Thanksgiving Dinner, and now after trying it out, I am in love. This recipe is oh-so simple and tasty. I didn't follow exact measurements in terms of the size of each piece of potato or the sugar/spice mixture; however, they still ended up heavenly. One thing I would like to point out is that mixing the mixture of spices and potatoes is not needed necessarily, but it is recommended for optimal taste.

Too much oil.  I actually had closer to 3 lbs of sweet potatoes (4 regular potatoes).  I cut them into thick rings and followed the directions, although I used a little less cinnamon.  The oil was completely overdone.  I would suggest maybe just tossing the potato slices in a couple of tablespoons of oil in a mixing bowl, then baking at 10 min, stir, 10 min, stir, add sugar mix, 10 min schedule.  A good mix of sweet and salt and pretty easy, I will make again with much less oil and maybe a little more salt.  Oh yeah, since I don't keep fresh lime juice on hand, I skipped that bit.

Very dry & tough (undercooked?) I think they need to be cooked at a much higher temp.

Excellent. I wouldn't have thought of the salt, but it's part of what makes this so good. Kids loved it, adults loved it, I made sure to squirrel some away for breakfast tomorrow without anything noticing. What a wonderful and colorful item to add to the dinner (and sneaky breakfast) table. Thank you!

Really good.  I probably baked for too long, cause the sugar crystalized.  Definitely will be making again, just watching the time better.

These did not work for me. VERY dry. After dishing everyone up I put some back and tried adding orange juice, helped a little but not much. I think I'll stick to good ol' sweet potato casserole next time.

I may have done something to mess it up since this is the first time I've tried this recipe, but these didn't turn out very good when I made them this Thanksgiving. In fact they didn't taste much like anything at all! The only thing I changed was that I added a little more brown sugar and cinnamon, but they didn't carmelize in the oven at all and they were way to oily, even though I didn't use the entire 1/4 cup as other people suggested. Also, I used actual fresh sweet potatoes, instead of yams, but I think yams would have been better because they're sweeter. I may try this one more time, with the yams and less brown sugar and cinnamon, but if they don't tasted any better, I'm switching to another recipe!

I was pleasantly surprised at how yummy this was!  The family is so accustomed to the canned yams that they weren't as open minded.   But that's why I made it now and not at Thanksgiving.  They can have their usual "Burnt Offerings" next Thurs, but I still enjoyed these very much!

This was simple and very good. I accidently mixed the lime juice with the brown sugar/cinnamon, so it all baked off during cooktime and we couldn't taste it, but like others I didn't really miss it :) Will make again, thank you.

I followed this recipe to a "T" and it was outstanding.  The mix of the sweet with the salt and pepper was perfect.  My family loved it and there were no leftovers.

I did everything the recipe called for yet it came out bland. Maybe I am too used to the whole "smothered" approach to sweet potatoes! Where this may be a healthier version, I think I'd rather gain a couple lbs. eating something more alot more flavourful. Sorry!

Very good and very tasty. Easy to make too. The hardest part is slicing the potatoes. I had some cut thicker and some thinner and I really enjoyed the crispness of the thin cut slices. It's a nice sweet flavor without a lot of the butter and sugar that are in a lot of other recipes.

I liked these sweet potatoes but still LOVE the old fashioned candied sweet potatoes which of course are slathered in butter and brown sugar.  I am sure these are a much healthier alternative. Easy enought to make but I had WAY to much oil??  I would definitely cut back on the oil and just moisten the potatoes with it.  I didn't use the lime juice--didn't have any but perhaps that is the secret ingredient? I may make again but cut back on the oil. Thanks for a good recipe!
