This gravy was great.  I used real onion instead of onion powder and vegetable boullion instead of vegetable broth and it worked out fine.  I had a problem with the flour clumping so I'd recommend sifting it first. All in all it was fabulous!

This was excellent. Instead of adding the flour as directed I put the required amount plus extra and shook it in a jar with cold water, really well. Then slowly added the flour mixture to the hot gravy, stirring slowly. It thickened up nicely. Also your not supposed to boil miso so I added after it had boiled. I added kelp as well because miso and kelp combined remove radiation out of the body. Enjoy.

This turned out to be easy as promised and pretty tasty. I had to adapt this recipe since I don't have miso paste and I am not sure what that is. I added some corn starch in it's place to ensure the gravy woulf thicken. I added some garlic and onion spices to give it great flavor.

The only difficulty that I had was in making it thick.  And I can't cook at all.  I made this with mashed potatoes (as the main dish) for 11 people.  About 3/4 really like the gravy (which is pretty darn good with this group.)  All in all, very worth making, just be prepared to let it sit for a while to thicken, and never really get that thick.  Also, be sure you like miso.

This gravy is easy and delicious; a meat-eater would never know this was vegan.

though i made a smaller quantity, this gravy came out really really well. nice and thick. very miso-y though.. and therefore quite salty.

Oh my god, this was sooo easy to make and it is surprisingly really really good! I took the precaution of one reviewer saying it was too salty and only added one tablespoon of soy sauce and it came out perfect. I also didn't have miso paste so just used the flour, broth, soy sauce and onion powder and it was just fine!

Worked the first time, and tasted great. I substituted the miso paste for vegemite (being Australian, and not having any miso paste handy) and it worked perfectly. Somehow it even managed to take on a mushroom aroma, loved it!

This gravy wasn't what I was looking for. It tasted too flour-y, and I'm not sure why. I did add mushrooms which gave it a bit of interest.

I liked it!  It's a good way to use up the last of the miso.  I didn't have onion powder, but I sauteed some spring onions before adding the flour.  I used 1 beef bouillon and 2 sodium-free vegetable bouillon cubes for the broth, and found it to be salty enough.

Easy. A little on the salty side. Not sure how the flour was supposed to dissolve in the butter. Ended up using the broth to dissolve.

I didn't have miso, so I added about 1/2 - 1 t. of corn starch. I had to do this 2 times: it's very important to SLOWLY add the broth and stir constantly so as to maintain thickness. Up to this point, it was a 3 for me because I found it a little bland or lacking depth, so at the end, I added about 1/2t. poultry seasoning and it was a 5-star! Everyone loved it, and it will be my gravy standard from now on!

I had to make modifications to this recipe as I wanted to use it on biscuits. I used 1/3 cup of organic vanilla soy milk, and only 1  2/3 cup of the vegetable broth. I also used 1T organic red miso and 1T organic yellow miso, with Organic Tamari soy sauce. I also used malt flour instead of all- purpose and ended up having to add 2T corn starch to thicken it up enough to pour over biscuits. It was very tasty and not salty to me at all. But I do believe the organic ingredients that I used contain less salt than the regular brands.

I love this gravy! Gravy is one of the few things I miss since being vegetarian, but this is even better than the real thing.

I used cornstarch in place of the miso paste and omitted the soy sauce. It was smooth and creamy.

Fried onions first (instead of using onion powder). I would recommend the broth first and then slowly add flour to avoid clumping. Add miso+water in the end, after boiling.

I mean, it's OKAY, not bad, but not the best. The potato is fine alone as well (I got yellow sweet potatoes they're addicting). But then again, the gravy does add a nice affect to it. It's very interesting. It's probably the kind of wheat flour I am using and the type of broth I used (I got some chicken bouillon and that's all I legit had). I'm going to put a five-star on it because it's probs my fault tbfh. Anyway, I'd still make it again.

Really good basic gravy. The only change I made was add bacon drippings instead of butter. I sautéed the onions for a bit first and added in the flour and browned it for a bit. Then added the beef boullion that I dissolved in the water. It was a bit salty so I added hot water until it was good.

I made this gluten free. It was a little floury but still good. Not the number one recipe but a great go to on a pinch.
