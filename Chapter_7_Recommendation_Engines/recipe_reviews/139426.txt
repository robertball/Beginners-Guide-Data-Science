Very good! I thought the papaya added an exotic taste to a really good drink! Thanks for the post! PS Added a little cherry juice to this, also did not have the honeydew so I left that out.

YUMMMMMMMMMY!!!!!!!!!! I loved this. I used really sweet green grapes and I used plain lowfat yogurt because there is way too much sugar in flavored and I never got into flavort yogurt also since the fruits were sweet I thought it would overpower them. I am glad I did because it was so good. Thanks for the awesome recipe!! I am gonna try this in the summer when it is nicer out and the fruit is sweeter and I can carry it out without freezing because N.Y. is sooo cold now! :(

My 9 year old daughter loved this smoothie.  We used everything except the papaya.  I prepped all the fruit before hand and have it stored in gladware in the fridge so it's very simple to whip this up before school.  Very satisfying and filling.

We really enjoyed this as our "pre-breakfast" this morning.  Too bad papaya is not something I have on hand as readily as these other fruits, because I'm sure this smoothie would have been even better, more unique, with it.  I didn't have yogurt so I was FORCED to use homemade vanilla ice cream.  (I don't think the smoothie suffered because of it and I know we didn't!)  I used red grapes and in hindsight wouldn't have, as they left annoying and unattractive little bits of red skin in the smoothie even after blending the heck out of it.  I used fresh squeezed orange juice and cantaloupe as well as the honeydew.  This smoothie served doubly duty - not only was it good and good for you, but it was also an efficient way to use up a bunch of fruit before heading out of town!

Delicious and super easy to make.  Scored ten stars with my five year old who loved helping me make this.

Good smoothie. I added frozen banana and omitted the honeydew because I don't like it. I also used plain yogurt instead of flavored, just a preference.

I used mango instead of papaya and it turned out delicious just as written!

10 stars!  This is a wonderful smoothie.  I bought a papaya and had a pineapple and some bananas that needed to be used up so I went searching for a recipe and this popped up.  Serendipity!!  This will be a regular treat and breakfast in our home.  Changes made:  No honeydew because I didn't have any.  Fresh squeezed tangerine juice because I had no orange juice.

We really liked this. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is the after taste from the yogurt. It just had a weird taste to it.

What a wonderful smoothie! I used mango instead of honeydew and cantaloupe instead of seedless grapes just because I didn't have it on hand. We choose low-fat vanilla yogurt and added about 1 tbsp. of wheat germ. I didn't put any ice cubes because I don't like smoothies with it. This is definitely a keeper. Thank you Stephanie S. for sharing

The pineapple flavor was really overpowering.
