AMAZING! This is the best pumpkin pie I have ever eaten. The ginger is a surprise ingredient. My mom doesn't care for pumpkin pie, but when I made it at Christmas time, she kept raving about how much she loved it!

This is the best pumpkin pie!  I have also used pecans in place of walnuts and it's delicious!  I just can't decide which nut is better on this pie!
