Eggs-cellent!  I love Eggs Benedict and I'm very fond of avocados too.  I wasn't sure I'd like the two together, however,  and I'm glad I gave it a try.  It was soooo much better than I even imagined or hoped it would be.  You still get the tang and the creaminess of the traditional Hollandaise sauce and I'm sure the avocado is probably better for you too. I didn't use nearly the amount of lemon juice called for, just a couple of squeezes, and it was the perfect hint of lemon while still enough to prevent the avocado from turning color.  I was afraid the avocado squeezed over the top might look like some mushy green slime and not be very attractive, and it kind of did, actually.  But I didn't care - I was more concerned with how it tasted than how it looked.  My eggs turned out perfectly (gently simmered for 3 minutes in water to which I added maybe two teaspoons of vinegar) and I like my English muffins well toasted.  This could easily become another weekend breakfast habit.

Very delicious and very good for you too! The only thing I might change next time is to use slightly less lemon juice. Will definitely make again!

Made with bottled lemon juice scaled back to just one tablespoon, but had strong lemon flavor.  Added sour cream to mellow that overbearing lemon taste.  Also added fresh baby spinach leaves to the English muffins, and used smoked turkey breast.  Hubby loved it, will make again....

This was great! I was searching for a diabetic friendly breakfast and this is perfect.  I substituted whole wheat sourdough so it'd be OK for my diet restrictions. I also subbed fake bacon for ham and added a sliced tomato. Sooo delicious :)

Actually quite good, I didn't miss the hollandaise. I used bacon instead of ham, I think it gave it a heartier flavor.
