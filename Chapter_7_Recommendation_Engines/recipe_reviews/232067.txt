This has always been a family favorite.  Today we changed it up and used Johnsonville Mild Italian Sausage.  It was definitely tasty.  A bit of an indulgence since we usually use lean beef but it was really good!

I'm not sure if Cream of Onion soup is a geographical item, but it's not in my grocery store. I used French Onion soup instead and French-cut green beans. I also added Ortega chilies. The soup is delicious. I poured it over steamed rice to make it a little more substantive.

This soup was really not good at all. I followed the directions to a T, the only thing different was that I used cream of mushroom soup because my grocery store didn't carry cream of onion soup. I think what it was was the diced tomatoes with green chiles - it gave it a spicy, Mexican flavor that just didn't jive with the rest of the soup. Also takes a lot longer in the crockpot than suggested. Definitely won't be making this again.

I gave 5 stars-but that is with the following change:only use 1can cream of onion soup.  I tried it with 2 cans and it is too salty and the cream soup flavor overpowers the other ingredients.  This has become a staple at our house. My picky kids pick out the parts they like so we all eat it.

Delicious, hearty taste. The combination of cream of onion soup, beef broth, and tomatoes is terrific.  I used tomato sauce with green chilies, but followed the recipe for everything else.  This is a great use for tortellini!
