I'm tired of the same old Tollhouse cookies. These cookies are a nice change! I increased the cinnamon to 1/4t and added toasted chopped walnuts. Yum! Thanks for a unique cookie,Sandra.

These are, by far, the best chocolate chip cookies I have ever made.  This is my "go-to" recipe whenever I need to bake cookies for my family, my friends, or myself!  A few changes I make:  I refrigerate or freeze the cookie dough so that it is very cold.  Then I roll each piece of cookie dough in powdered sugar, place the cookie on the cookie sheet, and press down with a glass dipped in powdered sugar.  I bake the cookies for a few less minutes than the recipe calls for. This way, the cookies come out a little crispy on the outside, but soft and chewy on the inside, and stay that way even after they cool.

I doctored these up a bit. First, I left out the chocolate chips so that I'd be left with a spice cookie. Then, I added more spice-- 1 t. cinnamon, 1/2 t. nutmeg, 1/4 t. cloves, and 1/4 t. ginger. I also mixed the butter-sugar-egg mixture on high until it was really light and frothy before I added the dry mixture. The cookies turned out flat yet chewy--very good texture and taste. I got 30 cookies out of this and baked them for 10 minutes.

Very good chocolate chip cookies.  Only spicy because I added 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper, though - otherwise they'd be fairly non-spicy but good chocolate chip cookies.  Chewy, crunchy, good cookies and with my addition, truly zippy!  Other than that, followed recipe to letter.

These were alright cookies. I omitted almond extract and cloves because I didn't have them, and increased the nutmeg and cinnamon by half. I also added 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper as suggested by another reviewer. I didn't find them flat at all, and 10 minutes was perfect baking time. Next time I would increase all the spices by another half, and keep the cayenne.

These were very good. I upped the spices to 1/2 tsp. each and added about 1/4 tsp of ginger. It made about 50 cookies.

Yummy and interesting!  I used dark chocolate chips, which complemented the spices really well.  I wished they were a little more spicy, but on the whole delicious!

Oh yeah!  I'm always looking for a good chocolate chip cookie and these are off the hook!  I doubled the nutmeg and cinnamon; only a few drop of the almond extract.  I had semi-sweet mini morsels on hand and they worked great.  This recipe is a keeper!

The first time I made these it was exactly as written, good but not great.  The next time I used 1/4 tsp; of each spice, better but still not great.  Finally I added a heaping 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper and these cookies are worthy of hall of fame status.  Everybody loved them and begged for the recipe.  They were amazed at the secret ingredient.

Much MUCH too thin... too thin to get off the pan and keep together. I'm sure they would have been great otherwise. next time I'll add more flour.

The flavor of the cookies actually deserves 4 stars, but only gave it 3 because of the end results.  The cookies spread so much and they are very thin.  My husband didn't enjoy them at all.  Sorry.

These were easy to make and yielded thin, light, melt-in-your-mouth good chocolate chip cookies with a subtle spicy flavor which my husband and I both loved--the nine cookies I made were gone in about a half hour! Except for recalculating for a different amount of cookies, I followed the recipe exactly, will definitely make them again and not change a thing.

I've changed my mind. Yes, the spices add another dimension to the old stand-by but I don't like flat, crunchy, greasy cookies even after a second attempt where I added an extra half cup of flour. Instead I'll be adding the spices and espresso powder to my regular cookies.

These were a nice surprise. I added some ginger and it didn't really need it, but it complemented the other flavors. It confused people when I told them they were spicy, but everyone loved them. Definitely worth trying.

I used margarine instead of butter, otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Did not come out thin but they are crispy. The cookies are good but taste like regular chocolate cookies. I'll probably make them again but use more spice like te others to see the difference.

These are great. I added white chips as well as I didn't have quite enough semi sweet. Next time I think I'm going to add a little cayenne pepper for some spice.

The title is right to call them slightly spicy.  I didn't have any cloves, but still didn't think they were any better or worse without the spices.  Being in CO, they turned out a little flat so make sure you adjust for high altitude.  They were good, but I'll just make the back of the bag recipe next time.

These are some of the best cookies I've ever made!  I added Oatmeal and omitted the almond extract.  My husband ate them up faster than I did.  We LOVED the extra spice to them.  WONDERFUL!
