Excellent!  I recommend kalamata olives, artichoke hearts and pepperoncinis to garnish.  Add a little cream to the pesto, too!

I did not like this recipe very much-- there was too much vinegar and it did not really taste like real pesto.  I also did not like that it was shredded parmesan cheese and basil tossed in at the end.  It would be fine with only a tablespoon or two of vinegar and blend everything together.

This was okay but not as good as I had hoped.  We tripled it for a baby shower and everyone raved about everything but this.

Came across this recipe while searching for 'pasta salad'.  This came up and have used it ever since.  I make this every time I go to a pot-luck, and it's always a hit.  Never a drop left over.  I give this one a 5 Star rating!!!!!
