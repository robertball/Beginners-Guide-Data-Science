These were cakelike, very tender and very, very sweet.  Do not add extra butterscotch to them.  One batch I added miniature chocolate chips and that was really good.  the recipe was very easy to do and makes 4 sheets, 3 across.  i cooked them on convection at 350 for 12 min. and let them sit for 1 as per the recipe instructions.

Very very tasty!  We even screwed it up horribly by not draining the pineapple, then added more flour to make it not as soupy, and in the end we don't know how much of which ingredients we added, and they were still very tasty!  They are cakey, but if you keep them in a plastic bag they stay moist and wonderful for quite a while!

This is my first review.. Did anyone else have a problem with too dry of a batter? I followed the recipe to a T, but after I stirred in the flour the mixture was crumbly dry. I went ahead and put in my drained pineapple and butterscotch chips and mixed it up, still too dry so I put in a little pineapple juice and mixed, then a little more, maybe 2-3 T. I didn't measure exactly. Baked them up and they were delicious! Do let them set up a minute before you take them off the cookie sheet. I used cooking spray on my airbake cookie sheets and they came off easily. They are a little on the sweet side. Like another reviewer said they remind you of pineapple upside down cake!

This was great, they taste kind of like personal pineapple upside-down cakes.  I could only find a 20 oz can of pineapple so I used it in place of the 2 eight oz ones.  This of course added a bit of moisture to the cookies, even after draining completely, but it didn't really affect the outcome, the cookies were a bit crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.  Delightful and I will make again.  Everyone was intrigued by the flavor combination.

This cookie was too cake-like for my liking and not very sweet. Won't be making again.
