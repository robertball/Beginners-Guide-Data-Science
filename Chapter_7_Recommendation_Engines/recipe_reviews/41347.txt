I've been searching for the recipe of those super-soft sponge cakes sold at Chinese bakeries for AGES, and I've finally found it! This tastes exactly like one of those pudding-included cake mixes! I was sick of failed experiments, so I scaled the recipe to 4 servings, used cake flour and used 3 very well greased tea cups as 'pans' (see pics). I baked them at 325F for 25min, then turned the heat off and left them in the oven to keep their shape... they rose twice their original size! The orange taste was very light, and they were a tiny hint too sweet for me (don't have much of a sweet tooth). Also, when folding the whites, remember to fold JUST until the color becomes uniform, not more!

This cake has both a nice flavor and texture.  I drizzled it with a sugar glaze made with some grated orange peel & vanilla extract. Everyone liked it.  Very tasty!
