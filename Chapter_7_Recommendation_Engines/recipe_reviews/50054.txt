When I origially posted this recipe (under an old user account that I forgot) I left out the cup of chicken stock that you add just after the alcohol from the wine has cooked off. You should first remove the peppers and reduce the liquid by half before adding the pork and peppers back to the pan.

This dish was terrific, particularly if you like pepper.  After removing the pork from the pan, I added a bit of cornstarch to thicken the sauce just a touch.  Also used a red, an orange and a yellow pepper for splendid colour.  Delicious!

I didn't have anything but red wine and used it instead and the dish was INCREDIBLE!  The pepper is very spicy so the next time I will not only use the right kind of wine for the proper taste, but, I will cut back on the black pepper for the 4 little eatters at my table......moist...very, very, moist!  A real meat stretcher dish too with leftovers for lunch!

This was quite a challenge without a mortar and pestle but with patience, perseverance and the flat side of a chef's knife I got the job done.  This was just delicious.  The contrast of the bite of the peppercorns with the sweetness of the red pepper was interesting, piquant and delicious. This "paste" permeates the meat and flavors it beautifully and that, coupled with the wine and chicken broth the submitter advised to add in a separate review, made for a wonderful sauce. I left the lemon off mine, hubs included it in his - -we were both pleased as pie!  I served this with rice pilaf (parsley buttered potatoes would have been good too) and  fresh asparagus. Great dish with a lovely presentation.

This was an excellent recipe! My family loved it. I didn't get to marinate but about 20 minutes & it was still fantastic.  I also did not make a paste, but used crushed garlic out of a jar (don't have a mortar & pestle), & actually, with that much meat I think it worked better as a marinade.  I used my favorite white wine and followed another Reviewer's suggestion to add cornstarch to the leftover sauce, which turned out to be a good idea. Can't wait to make this again!

Wonderful!  I used a combination of red, yellow, and orange bell peppers.  Skipped the lemon slices, but the lemon juice is a must.  We had this with plain couscous and steamed broccoli.

I like this recipe a lot. Although I substituted water for the wine, I still found the sauteed red pepper sauce quite flavorful. Next time I will double the red pepper sauce part as it was so tasty I couldn't get enough!

My family loved this - husband and teenage son.  Used coarse ground black pepper (cut back on quantity a bit), combo of red and green pepper, added some red onion and did not have fresh lemon on hand, so used Minute Maid lemon juice you get in the freezer case. I think some sliced fresh mushrooms would be good with this too! Served over rice.  Will make this again.

This recipe tasted much better than I expected, even after I read all the 5 star reviews.  I did some of the suggestions others did such as using diff colored peppers, adding the chicken stock, splash of balsamic and corn starch to thicken. I marinated my pork overnight. This was so delish - I served it over buttered egg noodles. I will definitely make this again and may use more stock since the sauce is so yummy.

Quick - easy and I loved using my mortar and pestle - I always feel like the mad scientist and anyone around are really impressed!!!  Followed recipe exactly and it was perfect.  I was going to add more garlic but didn't and was glad I followed the recipe. Thanks submitter.  As an after thought, adding bite size chunks of onions may be something I might try the next time.

This is a recipe all-star; it is easy, delicious, and company worthy!    It has been my experience that mashing peppercorns with a mortar and pestle is easiest when done without added liquid.  I added the olive oil as directed in the recipe and think that it made it a more laborious task than necessary.  Next time I will mash the peppercorns alone until almost ready and then add the garlic, olive oil and salt and finish mashing to make the paste.  Not being a black pepper lover I cut the peppercorns to a little over Â½ Tablespoon and I am very glad that I did.  It would have been too hot for us otherwise and I fear that the pepper flavor might have been too overwhelming.  After only two hours marinating in the fridge, the pork was well flavored by the paste and wonderfully tender.  As the recipe submitter suggested in his review I did reduce the wine with the peppers and then removed the peppers to the plate with the pork.  I added a cup of chicken broth and reduced that a bit before returning the pork to the skillet to finish cooking.  I added the peppers with only about five minutes left to go because I did not want them to get mushy.  I served the pork with mashed potatoes and green beans for a simple yet elegant meal.  With so many recipes and so little time I have to absolutely love a recipe to make it a second time.  I am already looking forward to making this again next week!

Excellent 5 stars. Tender, juicy and flavorful. I followed the directions to a "T". I like the simple blend of fresh garlic, black peppercorn, olive oil and hawaiian sea salt for the marinade.  However, the sauce made this dish! The white wine with chicken broth mixed with the marinade made this an excellent dish. I was the only one who used lemon. I gave the lemon a good squeeze over the pork which, to me added a nice balance of flavors along with the sweet red bell peppers and black peppercorns. I served this with, "Sauteed Cherry Tomatoes with Garlic and Basil,""Sesame-Lemon Asparagus," and "Parsley Red Potatoes," from this site.

Great dish! If you don't have a mortar and pestle (I didn't) use the bottom of a sturdy cup (plastic or glass) and mash the ingredients in the bottom of a mixing bowl.  Works great!

I was slightly underwhelmed by this dish but when I read the description, it is exactly as described.  It seemed to be missing something but I really don't know what I would do differently. There was a definite heat to the meat with the pepper/garlic flavors coming through and the sweetness of the peppers did cut it nicely. I did follow the changes mentioned by the author's additional post and also mixed a bit of cornstarch to some chicken broth to thicken the sauce.  The meat was incredibly tender and I served this dish with roasted asparagus and buttered parsley red potatoes.

pros....very easy.  cons....very average.  i made this for company one night becasue of good reviews.  YIKES...I'm not sure I'll make that mistake again.  It was pretty average to VERY average.  Just peppery lemon chicken.  The next night I took the leftovers and added, some capers, a lot of roasted peppers, garlic, and vermouth...with a little more white wine and corn starch to thicken and it was actually good.  But it took a combination of flavors to make this tasty.  nice and easy...but to be honest, a disappointment for a good cut of pork.  With the changes...it will like it much better.

This is SOOOO Good!  I doubled the garlic and only had time to let it marinate for 1 1/2 hours, but other than that followed the recipe to a tee.  My husband loved it as did I.  Served it over buttered noodles with a simple tossed salad.  Yum!

Awesome & easy!!  I didn't have white so I used red wine instead.  Also added 1/2 cup chicken stock after the wine reduced and a little cornstarch to thicken up the sauce.  Used both chicken thighs and pork and both turned out flavourful and moist.  Am sharing recipe with friends.

We loved this pork! Like others, I couldn't get over how tender it came out. I served it with pine nut couscous and it was an excellent and healthy meal. So simple, yet so delicious :)

we've used this recipe several times but not for a while. this time the only change we made to the recipe was to use the paste as a marinade then grill our bone in pork chops instead of using the medallions in the pan.  we coupled it this time with Ramsay's Ultimate Cauliflower Cheese recipe.  incredible!!!  best dinner i've had in a while and that's a serious statement.  and my 10 y/o loveloveloved all of it!

This dish really surprised me.  I didn't think something so simple could be so good!  My husband usually does not like pork, but he loved this!  He said it tasted like steak.  Followed the recipe exactly.

Wow! this was great! I usually don't really like wine in my cooking, but in this dish it was great. I really liked the heat of the peppercorns with the sweetness of the bell pepper and the sour of the wine and lemon.
I will definately make this dish again.
Thanks for sharing.

I liked this recipe alot. I prepared it a bit differently tho, slicing the pork into 1 inch cubes and pounding it out. I let it marinade over night, and added more pepper at the end.

This ws OK..nothing outstanding.  I used yellow and red pepper, that added color and taste.  I also used beef stock, not chicken.  I did like the addition of fresh lemon, definately made it more tasty.  I would not call this dish elegant, but I might make it again.

I keep forgetting that this one needs marinading.  I just look at the cook time and get started.  Hmmm, I am sure it would taste better marinaded.

I used freshly group pepper and cut the pork slices 1/3 inch thick.  This saved a lot of time and effort.  It was delicious.  have made it several times.  The lemon juice is a must and can be added at will.

These were so tasty!! Only had red wine and time to marinate them for 2 hours but still tasted wonderful. Ate the leftovers the next night over pasta and sauteed some more peppers. My boyfriend and I just couldn't get enough!

This actually turned out quite nice. I didn't have a pestle/mortar so just threw ingredients in a food chopper. I didn't press the meat either and it still turned out tender and flavorful.  Near the end, I added a mix of cornstarch and water to thicken the sauce and served alongside mashed potatoes.  Based on other reviews, I added a splash of balsamic vinegar and some lemon juice at the end.  Enjoy with the rest of the wine you use in the recipe =)

This is a tasty recipe, but can be juicier and more tender if cooked only until 140 degrees.  Remove the pork to a plate and cover for five minutes.  The temperature will rise to 145 degrees.  Inside, there may be a slight pinkness, but there is no danger in eating the meat.  When I was a kid, pork had to be cooked to a higher temperature to destroy bacteria, but that is no longer necessary.  Less tender cuts of pork can benefit even more from cooking to 145 degrees.

Fantastic!!!  Don't forget the lemon "spritz"... it really adds to the overall flavor!!  Made a sauce with the leftover juices from the pan but you don't really need it.  The pork is sooooo tender & flavorful, the sauce is a waste.  Served w/ brown rice & asparagus!!!  I'm gonna go eat the leftovers right NOW!!!

This was largely flavorless.  I used sliced pork loin and followed the directions, it just did not pick up much flavor and needed a good amount of salt and pepper.

Tasty.  The garlic marinade gave great flavor to the meat.  We added the cup of chicken broth, which I recommend, but I wish we would have added cornstarch, as the sauce was really thin.  Served with couscous, which was a nice compliment.  Thanks for sharing.

Just made this recipe for a family of six, two adults and four small children. Everyone loved it. I'd probably do three pounds of meat next time. Everyone could have eaten more. I have zero experience in the kitchen but was able to pull this one off. Used Kirkland 2014 Pinot Grigio. One cup for the recipe, the rest for me while cooking. I thought there didn't seem to be enough paste so I made a 1/2 more. That pork had some kick!  . I served it with roasted asparagus and steamed carrots and toasted quinoa, which drank up the sauce. I boiled the sauce down a little. Next time, I might brown the pork for 2 minutes a side. There will definitely be a next time. Frickin'delicious.

I finally made this last night with red peppers from my garden and I was floored. It was fabulous. I wish I hadn't waited so long because now all my red peppers are gone. I did freeze some in strips, though, in anticipation of making this many more times. I wound up leaving it marinating in the fridge almost 24 hours and the meat was garlicky and so tender it cut easily with a fork. I used boneless pork chops, flattened them and cut them into small pieces. The crushed peppercorns were so crunchy and delicious. I don't have a mortar and pestle and had to make do with a bowl and the bottom of a knife handle but because of this recipe I intend to purchase a set. Luckily I had already noticed Stuart Miller's caveat review wherein he adds crucial steps and chicken stock to the printed recipe. I, like a few others, also added a bit of cornstarch to thicken it a bit. I served it with some rice, not that it needed it. Several weeks ago I contacted Allrecipes to ask that the recipe be rewritten correctly and it never was so I can imagine that there are people who didn't add the chicken broth and complete several other steps. Thanks Stuart!!!!

I had a hard time crushing the peppercorns so it had quite a bite to it.  I used both yellow and red peppers and it was very pretty.  I will definitely be making this again for the family and maybe even company.

Since my fiance doesn't like pork, I used this on chicken and steak! SOOOOOO yummy. I sauteed half of a red onion with the peppers, garnished with chives or scallions and the lemon. Excellent on the grill too :)

It was delicious.  I recommend using a little less salt but it tasted wonderful.  The lemons really topped it off and I only marinated for about 15 minutes.

This was pretty good and just something different to do with pork. I actually used boneless pork chops and I didn't have whole peppercorns but I did use ground peppercorns.

Fool proof recipe - I didn't marinate, the pork chops were still partly frozen when I cubed them. I didn't have peppercorns or corse salt, so used regular pepper and sea salt.  I even forgot the lemon juice at the end and it was REALLY GOOD.  I can't imagine how great it will be when I actually follow the recipe!  (I did use the 1 cup chicken broth in addition to the wine that another user suggested)

Wow!  I loved this!  The taste is great!  We followed the recipe -- with the one exception of adding a spash of balsamic vinegar to the sauce.  It was excellent.  Next time we would increase the amount of the marinade by double.  Terrific recipe.

WOW!  I have been an allrecipes.com user for years and this was the first recipe which inspired me to write a review.  I made this recipe for my Portuguese parents and served over egg noodles- truly moist and delicious.  The next day we had the left overs in soft Portuguese rolls- pure heaven! Thanks so much!

What a wonderful dish! I don't have a large mortar and pestle so used an mini chop.  It did not break all the peppercorns so I did crush a few with my small mortar and pestle. Quite a few of the peppercorns remained whole. Although I thought it would be too peppery, it was such a hit at our house that it made the DEFINITELY MAKE AGAIN, AND SOON! list.

I've made this recipe a few times and developed a sauce from the original.  

After the pork is browned  I deglaze the pan with the white wine and a splash of white wine vinegar and let it reduce to almost dry. I then add 1/2 cup cream and let it reduce slowly. Add the pork and cover. Once the sauce is reduced enough add a nob of butter to round it off. Add the lemon juice at the and so it doesn't turn bitter. Season to taste.

We LOVE pepper but found this amount to be overpowering.  Next time I will reduce by half or use regular table ground pepper.  The sauce came out good however, I like others added some cornstarch to help thicken and allow it to "hang onto the meat" In addition to the red peppers, I also used sweet yellow and orange peppers because I needed to use them up...taste was good.

I made this as directed, including the chicken broth. I thought it was okay, my husband thought it was delicious. I found the garlic and peppercorns too strong for the pork and thought the strong seasoning would be better suited for beef. I absolutely loved the peppers though.

Loved this dish. Added some yellow bell peppers and red jalapeÃ±os.  It was definitely a big hit.  Only negative comment is that it was not very good reheated the next day for leftovers. Will definitely make again but will cut recipe in half.

This is so delicious. The reason I didn't give it 5 star is because the pork wasn't tender. I only marinaded it for 3 hrs. Maybe it wasn't long enough. Next time I will let it marinade it overnight. I also doubled the sauce and added some parsley to it.
Boiled parsley buttered potatoes made with red potatoes are wonderful with this recipe.
A good side dish is stuffed zucchini

The pork turned out well, I think next time I will cook it a just a few minutes less. Sweet Wife and I agree that a can of Cannellini beans would make it better. The recipe did not state I should peel the sweet potato, but it did specify peeling the apple, so I left the peel on the sweet potato...do not do that.

This was an extremely flavorful dish. We love our spicy food, so the pepper and garlic were not too strong for our taste-buds. The challenge I had was the sauce. It definitely needed thickening; it was a shame to waste some of the flavor. Could only spoon a small amount over served portions without making whole plate watery. I did not make the changes other reviewers suggested, such as adding cornstarch, and regret that. Otherwise, good recipe.

We're trying to eat healthier, and this recipe looked promising.  Glad I read the reviews and saw the bit about adding chicken stock to the wine after the alcohol cooked off.  I added onion chunks and mushroom slices, and a dash of balsamic vinegar to the sauce, and backed off on the peppercorns going off other reviews.  The pork was moist and fork-tender and veggies nicely cooked.  Thickened the sauce a little with flour/water slurry.  Served over jasmine rice with roasted broccoli on the side....wonderful any night of the week!
