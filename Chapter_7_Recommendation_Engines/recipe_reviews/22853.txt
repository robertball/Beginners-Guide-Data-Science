Taste great. Rich. But 18-20 min was way too long. I cut the time down to 15 and that seemed to be just right.

Quick and easy to make and very tasty.  They get hard very quickly even when stored air tight.  I prefer soft cookies.

While this recipe was the 2nd time to be a repeat offender in my house. I waited to see results. Both times this recipe was made, I liked, but I didn't like the over abundance of the vanilla. 2 teaspoons is way to much, you can taste it above the chocolate flavor and just under the peanut butter chips. However, the 1st time they were made as a cookie and were thick and fluffy and were more like a cakey cookie. I suggested that we try on the next go around to place in a mini cupcake/muffin pan and see what they do. And to my thinking, they did exactly as predicted...they were more a muffin style recipe verses a cookie. This recipe was good like I said but should be renamed as a muffin recipe, not a cookie recipe. And as a muffin recipe, they were perfect little morsels.

I loved this recipe, the dough was thick. When I tried one it was like a cake brownie cookie. I absolutely loved it. This is a great recipe for a nice soft cookie.
