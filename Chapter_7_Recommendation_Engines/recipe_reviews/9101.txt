I've made this every year since I first saw it in 1999 and every year it gets raves.  This has to be one of the easiest recipes out there yet it looks and tastes like you've put a ton of effort into it.

I've never made this version, but have been making one like it for years.  The cranberry and cherry together are wonderful.  I do not use raisins.  I use cinnamon for the spice, tapioca for the flour, and a squirt of lemon juice.  I just make regular pie crust, lattice or otherwise.  This pie is wonderful and always a big hit.

This recipe turned out great! I made no changes, just followed the recipe to the letter. It was such a hit at Thanksgiving at my boyfrinend's house that I took it to mine for Christmas too! A great alternative to your normal holiday pies.

Gave it a 5 for taste alone. A little bit runny, but I guess a lot of pies are. Superb taste.

So easy, got lots of compliments on this dessert. I used frozen pie dough (thawed out one shell to make the lattice pattern). Since I used frozen, I added the orange flavor by basting the bottom side of the lattice strips with orange juice (top still used the milk and sprinkled sugar). Great, easy dessert that's beautiful

I served this to guests over the holiday weekend and they absolutely loved it!  I used store bought crusts and did not do a lattice; I just made a standard two-crust pie and covered the edges with tin foil after the first 15 minutes of baking.  I recommend serving this with vanilla ice cream since the filling is not super sweet.

It was very easy to make, but didn't suit my tastes; mostly due to the texture.  The texture of the whole pie ended up like the whole cranberry sauce, but I prefer it smooth like the cherry pie filling.  Maybe it was the brand of cranberry sauce I used?

This pie turned out great!  The combination of cherries and cranberries was perfect for Thanksgiving.  The lattice on the first one I made didn't get done as well as I would have liked because I was anxious and kept opening the oven.  The second time I was more patient and the pie was beautiful.

This pie is very good.  It's a little sweet, a little tart, and a little citrusy from adding the juice to the crust.  This one's a keeper.

The family loved it.  Worth all of 5 stars.  And really easy.  And I loved the orange juice in the crust.  Very nice.

Not only is this pie easy to make, but it's impressive and something unique that people aren't expecting. The flavor combination is great! The cherries cut the tartness of the cranberries and the cranberries cut the sweetness of the cherries for a perfect combination. The best part is, it's perfect for thanksgiving and summer barbeques!

I loved the flavor of this pie.  the orange juice in a BUtter pie crust was fantastic.  However the pie was a little too runny.  next time it may need more cornstarch.  And I will omit the ginger.

I really like this pie. I kinda cheated and used ready made crust (i'm not into making crust, when the ready made stuff is so convenient) I omitted the raisins, and took it to thanksgiving dinner. it was a huge hit. thanks for a great, easy recipe

I added a 1/2 cp diced mango. Pie came out nice with a little extra sweet. I barely got one slice.
Due to the inconsistency of cranberry sauce, I opted for the frozen cranberries with the dried cranberries. Near perfect in texture and taste.

I made this as written, with homemade pie crust made, as suggested, with orange juice instead of water. The crust was the best part! The filling was, to my taste, lacking something ... it was essentially just two cans of fruit (cherry and cranberry). It wasn't bad, but didn't taste to me like either cherry OR cranberry. My husband liked it a lot, however, so ... four stars!
