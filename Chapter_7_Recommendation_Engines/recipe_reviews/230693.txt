Even after adding a cup and a half of flour, this pancake batter was still wet. I couldn't even get one solid pancake out of it. This whole recipe was inedible and a waste of ingredients.

This was a nice change for our usual pancakes and we enjoyed these very much. I let the oats sit in the buttermilk a little bit to soften before adding the additional ingredients.   I needed to add flour, and as such, we would have rated it a 5 star recipe.     However, where the flour was a major component to the recipe, to be fair to other home cooks who may try this recipe and be unaware that flour is needed, I rated it a 3.

I printed this recipe quite a while ago so I had not read reviews. I did notice the lack of flour and also the fact that the butter was softened, not melted. They called for lots of  baking soda and powder. That did help them to rise slightly, but they were terrible. I threw away half the batter. There are numerous other oatmeal cookie pancake recipes that are excellent.

I didn't want to be at the stove all morning, so I 1/2d the recipe. Added 1/2 c flour, use applecider ving to make the buttermilk, used molasses since I didn't  have brown sugar (left off the syrup). Smells great, we shall see.

We had these pancakes on Saturday, and today, Monday, my husband is still raving about them. He says they were teh fluffiest of any I have ever made.  
I'm glad I read the reviews by the two people who commented on the fact that flour was missing from the recipe.  At least I was ready for it.  I made half the recipe and it needed one cup of flour.  I can't imagine that anyone made this and reviewed it without noting the lack of flour.

As the other reviewers mentioned, I think this recipe is missing flour.  I added 1 cup, but I think it may have been a little too much. They didn't have the flavor I was hoping for and it was tough to get them to cook through without getting very brown.  I might give them another try, but I would probably go heavier on the cinnamon, lighter on the flour I add, and leave the syrup out to pour on top.  They're an interesting idea, but I think this recipe just needs another look to see if the ingredients are as written.
