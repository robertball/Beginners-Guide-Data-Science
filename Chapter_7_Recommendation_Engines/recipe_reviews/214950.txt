This recipe was a delightful surprise. I had my doubts when I saw cream of mushroom pared with zuchinni but it was delicious. I used herbed stuffing because I couldn't get the cornbread so I'm looking forward to having it when I do find it. Will be a regular dish on my menu.

I used this recipe as a platform, then switched it up completely and did my own thing! It turned out great! My filling consisted of sliced carrot, celery, green bell pepper, fingerling potatoes, onions, and fresh green beans. I ran most these items threw the food processor on the "slice" option to ensure they would cook at the same time. I added sliced zucchini, garlic, grilled jalapeno cheddar sausage, and corn to the last minute of the above saut√©ed mixture. I mixed cream of chicken soup, sour cream, and spices on the side, and then combined it with the veggie/sausage mix. I placed the mix into a 9x13 dish, covered with whole wheat bread crumbs, and baked at 350' for 20 minutes.

I loved this recipe, it was a great way to get extra squash cooked up. I added 2 cups a piece of the squash, and sauteed the veggies for a few minutes before adding the broth. Instead of sour cream I added a 1/4 c. of milk, which worked out just fine. We added a large can of chicken to up the protien. It turned out wonderfully, I will make this again!

Things I liked about this dish:  
The color of using both yellow & green squash.  The crunch of dry topping.  The punch of flavor from the herbs in the stuffing mix.  (*I didn't miss the cheese found in most squash casseroles.  To me, it was plenty "creamy" from the soup & s cream.)  The b pepper & onion was also a great addition flavor- and color-wise.
Things I will change:  
Mine ended up too wet/soupy.  I'm thinking this was because I steamed my veggies in the microwave instead pan sauteing, which kept the liquid instead of evaporating it.  I will either leave out the broth next time or maybe add an egg to firm up (and add protein).  
Overall, great recipe!  I will try again!!

Sorry, we did not care for this recipe.  I made it as directed, except I used all zucchini because I did not have yellow squash on hand like I thought I did.  If I were to suggest any changes, I might start with the soup, perhaps a chicken or cheese soup would work better for us.

A must have recipe for all the squash you end up with. 
  This was really very good.  I was worried it would be to wet, it wasn't.
  Very very good.

this is fantastic. It was great the day I made it, and even better the next day. :) I do have to say I thought a whole red bell pepper was too much. I only added a 1/4 of one and it was perfect.

This turned out extremely tasty.  I added a can of pre-cooked chicken and I used low sodium chicken broth.

This dish was so delicious! This ended up making a lot of leftovers, and between my boyfriend and I, we ate it all! The leftovers are even better the next day because it seems like the flavors combine better over night. I added extra cheese to mine. Yum!

Made this last week with squash from the garden!  Only doubled the amount of squash as I did not have any zucchini!  Hubby loves it!  So do I!  Will definitely make it again!

This is most excellent and a family favorite, already.  I've made it several times since I found it.  It's a bit more bother than your usual squash casserole, but definitely worth it.  The bell pepper is an excellent addition.  I hardly ever make anything the exact same way twice, and I haven't with this recipe, either, but the changes I've made have been minor.  Depending on what I've got in the fridge and cupboard, I've changed up cheeses, added a bit of other leftover veg and added a touch of cream cheese, and used different breads or crumbs and it's still maintained its signature flavor and been great each time.  First time I made it was for Thanksgiving, and I think it's definitely a stand-out that serves well for a holiday meal, but everyone (including a finicky teen) loved it so much, I've done it at least three more times since.  Probably four.  And I'll definitely keep making it.  I've already memorized this recipe.

This recipe is a keeper. I did not have green zucchini ready to pick, so I only used the yellow in this recipe (I ended up with about 4-cups). I also used cream of chicken soup just because that is my personal preference. I used regular sour cream instead of low-fat (personal preference); and I didn't check the recipe close enough before I went shopping and bought the bread stuffing mix instead of the cornbread stuffing mix (will definitely have to try it with the cornbread next time). I did soak the stuffing mix in the leftover juices from the simmered squash before sprinkling it on top. I seasoned my squash mixture while it simmered (personal preference). This fit very well in my 8-inch square baking dish and the bake time was perfect. This dish was a big hit for dinner.

My kids and husband LOVED it!!  Both my girls, ages 9 and 10 had two helpings.  I did not have a red pepper, and per another review, omitted it.  I just sliced 3/4 of a large carrot and one banana pepper in it's place.  I used healthy request cream of mushroom soup.  I also didn't have the cornbread stuffing, just stove top chicken flavor.  This was surprisingly tasty, easy, and packed with veggies.

I really didn't care for this at all. The red bell pepper was too strong in this. I would use green bell pepper instead.

This recipe is really good! I tweaked a few things, though. I only added half a bell pepper and chopped it finely. Same with the onion, I used less than it called for. I also added some chicken thighs that I cut into pieces and saut√©ed in a little butter and liquid smoke. I didn't want the chicken to taste bland or like the veggies. I didn't really measure anything, just threw it together and added some pepper to the veggies while they softened up. My boyfriend and I really enjoyed it! So did our little unborn daughter, she's kicking up a storm as I write this!! ???? It's a really good recipe, like I said before. And so happy that it's a squash recipe that isn't drowning in cheese!! Will definitely add this one to my recipe collection! ????

Followed this recipe to the tee. I did see on another recipe for squash casserole that there were mushrooms added and i was feelin for some mushroom so i added that in. I did think after the veggies were done in the skillet pan it looked too watery so i drained it alittle but making sure not everything cos the cream of mushroom and sour cream will thicken it. This was definitely very tasty and felt healthy because of all the veggies!!! It was also very colorful. Will def make again.
