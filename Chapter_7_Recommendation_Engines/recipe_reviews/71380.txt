I took the advice of others and altered this recipe slightly.  So... I seasoned the chicken with fajita spice (made the mistake of not adding salt - the chicken really needs 1/2 tsp salt). I was worried that the peppers would make it too hot (used 1/2 the amount) - next time I would use all the peppers.  I roasted and peeled the poblano peppers - before adding them - they added incredible flavor. I used jalapeno jack and cheddar cheese - and reduced the amount by half. Since I left out 1/2 the cheese the result was bordering on being dry.  Next time I would increase the amount of sauce.  The sauce was great with that hint of lime, but it needed 1/2 tsp of salt too. (Maybe reducing the cheese makes this recipe in need of salt?) The mushrooms didn't add much and I don't really think of them as fitting in a Mexican style dish - I'd leave them out next time. Lastly, for ease of serving I cut the tortillas into squares and lined the pan.  Dad and 2 kids gave thumbs up, and ate it with green tomatillos sauce.

My family LOVES this recipe, including my Grandpa-in-law who doesn't like anything new!  I've made this many times for company and friends and have always gotten requests for the recipe.  I do put in more poblanos (4-6), doubled the sauce, used 1/2 bunch cilantro, skipped the mushrooms since I don't like them, and added salt.  I have made this with both flour and corn tortillas and prefer the corn with this recipe.  Hope this helps.  Enjoy.

I've learned a couple of things, while making this recipe, that I'll do differently next time. First, I'll roast and peel the Poblanos before slicing them. Second, I'll shred the chicken as I'd like a more authentic texture. It's very rare that I prepare a recipe as written, and I did feel it was lacking a certain flavor, maybe I'll discover it next time around.

This was pretty good.  I used half the cilantro and the flavor was good... if I had used it all I think it would have been too overpowering.  I also added onions to the mix - but onions go into everything I cook.  My husband liked it also, so we will probably be making it again.  I will probably add some more half and half to the sauce - it was really thick - but still tasted yummy.

I personally loved it, while once I added some salt and twicked it. I cubed the chicken before cooking and added about 1/4 cup of chopped onion to the chicken mixture. I also diced the tortillas up like I do for King Ranch chicken. I used an additional chicken breast too. I reduced the jalepeno peppers to 2 since they were huge. Used low-fat cheeses, butter and sour cream.
My picky brother did not like it. Not for picky eaters. My favorite ingrediants are chicken, mushrooms, pepppers; so I love this recipe.
Oh yeah I also changed the cheese to cheddar/monterray jack blend.

This was a great dish.   I halved the recipe for my husband and I.  I used flour tortillas because I really don't like corn tortillas.  I had to season the chicken a little.  I used cumin and garlic powder.  I added half a jar of salsa verde to the chicken and peppers.  I didn't add the mushrooms - they didn't really seem like they belonged. I only used half a bunch of cilantro and I'm glad I did.  It added great flavor to the sauce, but it was a little overpowering.  Next time I will double the sauce to put it in both layers, but still only use half the cilantro.  Don't be afraid to use all the peppers.  I like spicy food and was afraid it would be too spicy, but it wasn't.  We'll definitely make it again.

Totally disapointing.  With all those peppers I was expecting more of a punch with the chicken, but it was quite bland.  The sauce was not that flavorful either.  I am not a star chef so I am not sure what it needs, but it sure needs a pick me up.  Mu husband said it wasn't that bad, but then proceeded to cover his plate in Tapatio.  We will finish the leftovers, but I'll probably never see this one on my table again.

This is a good recipe.  I made the chicken in a crockpot and guess what, no poblanos in my grocery store.  I used some salsa and the liquid from a bottle of roasted red peppers.  After it cooked and cooled, I shredded it and mixed in one can of jalepeno peppers, diced and some more roasted red pepper juice.  It still needed something so I squeezed in a ton of lime juice and made the rest of the recipe as written.  It was really good.  I loved the cilantro sauce.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was okay... but on the bland side. I can't put my finger on what this might need to make it better... the suggestions of onions would probably be a good start. Maybe even switching the cheese to a jack variety.

Absolutely delicious. Unlike some reviewers that think it may need salt, most generally salt and pepper are ingredients that are added to taste. This was very flavorful and stood on it's own. Salt is added at the table on an individual basis.

My wife & I loved this dish.  I followed the recipe with the exception of substituting plain yogurt for the sour cream (didn't have any on hand); I wouldn't change a thing.  And for those who are wondering, yes, our friends to the south do eat mushrooms as do most cultures.

I had high hopes for this one. I tried to improve it by seasoning and shredding the chicken, roasting the poblanos, and increasing the cilantro sauce by half, but the result was barely edible. Soggy tortillas, WAY too much chicken (so much so that the peppers were completely lost), still not enough sauce, no flavouring or texture that even suggested the thought of enchiladas, and overall a wholly disappointing meal.

I wasted a long time in the kitchen and a lot of good ingredients on this. My boyfriend commented that it tasted like something you would make out of leftovers. I won't be making it again.

This is a great recipe!! We loved this. The only things I did differently was use less jalapeno (because my husband isn't supposed to have spicy food) and I forgot to buy mushrooms, so we had to go without. So, I added a little bit of chipotle powder and a little bit of ancho chili powder to the cream sauce because otherwise it would be so plain. I did add extra salt and pepper to the chicken/chili mixture. This was so yummy. I think it is pretty adaptable with adding extra veggies if need be as well. We loved it.

I did a vegan version of this and I promise you will not miss the chicken. It was very flavorful and certainly much healthier.

Great recipe if you add a few things. I cut up then cooked the chicken with peppers, onions and fresh corn, added salt cumin and pepper. The recipe calls for way too much chicken and I only used two large chicken breasts. I then topped it off with a mix of jack cheese and mozarella and the cream sauce. I left out the mushrrooms since the hubby doesn't like them. The family loved it! Will deffinitely make this again!

This is a good combination of ingredients, but only rates three stars as written.  To improve the dish, I suggest you:

Roast and peel the poblano peppers.

Add cumin and coriander to the chicken, plus salt.

Replace the mozzarella cheese with monterrey jack and/or a blend of true mexican cheeses.

Slice the chicken into strips before cooking or shred after cooking.

We love this recipe and didn't change a thing.  Confused by other reviews that added additional spices, and complained about lack of salt (um, easy enough to add if you're a saltaholic).  The best part about this recipe is all the fresh ingredients.  For those thinking it's lacking in flavor, make sure you use fresh juicy limes.  It's the lime flavor that makes this recipe over the top.  Additional spices would kill the fresh lime taste.

A few additions:  season your chicken(both sides) (cumin, chili spice, garlic, onion powder)...add some of your favorite onion (red works well), use three-four poblanos, mexican blend cheese with some mozzarella (not necesarily four cups, use your best judgement) . You can forgo the ... mushrooms. Next time, I'll try this with Rotel instead of mushrooms, and add in some green chilis.  My husband and 7 yr. old boy loved this recipe!

Too much cilantro. We left out the peppers because neither of us like spicy. Added salt at the table which was greatly needed but don't know if that was because we didn't use the peppers. Otherwise it was ok. Not sure we would make it again.

This recipe sounded good..but it came out very bland, no flavor at all..and the sauce was way too thick and flavorless.  I will try it again and adjust the seasonings and use a different cheese..I was very dissappointed ..also I don't see any salt or pepper or anything to make the taste POP!

It turned out okay but I wouldn't make it again. The chicken and peppers burned so I would recommend cooking that at maybe medium low, and the sauce took what seemed like forever. I think with some modifications it would have been better but the end result just wasn't worth it.

I had great expectations for this casserole, but was disappointed.  I roasted the poblanos (used 3),  cut the cilantro in half, and used a good quality cheese (cabot) on top.  It was a hot mushy mess.    Maybe if you added taco seasoning and didn't use the Tortillas, it would make a good dip?

Having read another review I made a few additions, . , they said that they thought it was bland,  I added 4-5 garlic, cumin, additional salt, 3 more Poblanos, and Chipotle cheese. I also used milk instead of half and half. it was one of the best that my husband and have eaten. Will be making this again real soon.

I loved it.  However I did make a couple revisions: First, I added taco seasoning to the chicken while it was cooking in the pan.  In making the cream sauce instead of using butter, because I had so much juice in the pan from the chicken, I used about a half cup of it.  Because my grocery store did not have poblano peppers, I used 1 green pepper. I added it to the chicken 5 min before it was done.  I added salt and extra garlic to the chicken.  When I layed the casserole I dumped in the rest of the sauce from the chicken which had all the taco seasoning and garlic and jalapeno bits. This recipie is excellent, it just needs extra seasoning for flavor.

My husband and I loved this when I made it! I halved the recipe since it's only us two, and we still had leftovers for a few days. It has a great lime flavor. Next time I'll make the whole recipe, plus some extra poblanos. (Roasted and peeled first next time). Also, I was scared of the jalepenos because I'm super sensitive to spice but I seeded them and they weren't spicy at all. Just added great flavor! What a great recipe! Thanks for sharing!

I thought this was a great dish the only thing I think it needed was more heat.  I only used two of the jalpenos and I wish I had used all four I guess I was afraid.  Next time I will add all four and maybe some seeds.  I also don't think you needed the cream (or half and half) it would have been just as good with milk and light sour cream.  And then you can save some fat and calories.

I made this for a dinner party and it was so great all the plates were cleaned off.  I did use low fat sour cream and fat free half and half and it was still wonderful.

These had great flavor.  I added a couple extra jalapeno peppers and half of a red and orange pepper.  Also added a few chipotle peppers in adobo for flavor.  Delicious!  Thanks for the great recipe.

I found this recipe to be very bland and dry.  I made up my own version of enchiladas a while ago, but thought I'd try something different.  I'll definitely stick with mine.  I even followed reviewers advice - adding salsa & chili powder to the chicken mix.  I also added some cumin and green chiles.  The white sauce on top is just much too bland.

I cut this recipe in half, and garnished with Fresh Salsa I.....It was excellent.  I'll probably use more peppers next time--i also used the full amount of mushrooms even though everything else was cut in half.

Very good!!  I used 2 Cups of Monterrey Jack Cheese, and 2 Cups of Mozzarella.  Mozzarella doesn't have enough flavor, in my opinion,  for a Mexican inspired dish.  I will definitely make this again!!

This was an instant hit for dinner last night.  Only a couple small changes:  I dissolved a bouillon cube in the half and half and used a combo of dried cilantro and fresh parsley in the sauce. and reduced the cheese to only one cup.  I skipped the tortillas and layered the chicken, cheese, and sauce over broiled slices of polenta.  Top with a bit of hot sauce for serving and it was just amazingly different combination of flavors and textures.

the sauce could use some salt for seasoning. Worth trying again but next time I think ill use a Mexican blend  or smoked mozzarella  cheese would be more flavorful.

It took almost 2 hours to prepare everything, and had very little flavor except cilantro. One bunch isn't a very good measure. Also the pablano skin should have been removed first, it ends up looking awful.

My husband loves Cilantro and loves mushrooms.  He said these were the best enchiladas he's ever had. He's from deep south Texas where authentic enchiladas can be found on every restaurant menu. But he said he won't touch theirs anymore as long as I make these weekly!  Very good if you don't mind mushrooms. I removed them before I ate.

Used leftover shredded chicken and added the peppers,etc. to the chicken. Also used cheddar cheese for the cheese. My family ate seconds of this and it was very easy to put together. UPDATE: Several reviews said the casserole was bland. This time I added about 2 tsp. of chicken bouillon to my white sauce.   The added chicken flavoring and added salt  from the bouillon made a great difference in the flavor of the sauce.

Yum! Only made one change - substituted a can of green chillis for the jalapenos, as my boyfriend is a bit of a wuss when it comes to spice. We also used low fat sour cream as a small attempt to cut the fat. Overall delicious, even reheated.

Ihought this was wonderful! I used Mexican style cheese instead of mozzarella. I expected it to be VERY spicy because of the peppers, but they were flavorful,not hot at all. Next time I will add something to spice it up a little.

Tried this recipe because I like poblana peppers--thought it would have been better using monterey jack cheese instead of mozarrela--see the author adapted it from an alfredo recipe but mozarrella doesn't seem to give it true Mexican flavor!

Rave reviews. On advice of others I roasted and peeled the poblanos and shredded the chicken once cooked. I used a Mexican blend pre-shredded cheese. I cut back on the peppers since I have some tender palets to feed and instead made a tomatillo salsa verde to serve with to spice it up for those of us who like it hotter. I also cut the tortillas into strips. Will definitely make this again.

Bland, Lifeless, not good, not bad, not anything really.  There is definitely something missing in this recipe, with all those peppers I expected a little heat at least, but... nothing.  I like the concept, but I don't even think this is a recipe I can doctor.  I do like the concept of an enchilada casserole though, so I might use this is inspiration to come up with my own that's MUCH better.

This recipe went in directly into the trash after dinner last night. There was no flavor other than the chicken. (how can you go wrong with chicken sauted in butter?) Sauce sounded interesting but did not coat other than where poured. Not spicy. I will find another way to use those extra tortillas in the future.

This recipe has become a family favorite. After making this a few times exactly as written (sans mushrooms and sour cream), I've made a few changes for convenience.  I don't go through the hassle of roasting the peppers; instead, I buy a can of green chilis.  I put cajun seasoning on the chicken, and in the sauce.  I use chicken tenderloins, and they only need about 15-20 minutes to cook.  I omit the mushrooms, because I can't stand them! In their place, I add sauteed onions. I use flour tortillas.  Finally, I don't use cream; I use 4 cups of milk. It tastes just as great, but makes it a bit healthier.  Delicious, and easy!

Scrumptious!  My family was scraping the bottom of the dish to get the very last bite.  I did cut back on the jalepeno's though because not everyone in my family likes their food that spicy.  I'll definitely be using this one again.

Roasting the poblano peppers is a must-it adds so much extra flavor to the dish.  A couple of people have said this was dry I doubled the sauce recipe and did not have that problem.  I used three layers of tortillas and put sauce over each layer to keep the tortillas from sticking.  My husband, who does not like chicken anything :), had seconds of this.

my family loved this w/ the following changes: insead of all butter, I used half olive oil.  I roasted the poblano peppers, added half a diced onion and 1 t. salt.  Amended sauce by using lo-fat half & half, added 1 t. salt, and used 3 c. of mixed cheddar, jack and asadero cheeses.  Texans like heightened flavors, so the changes turned out to be just right.

I loved the combination of tastes! I didn't use fresh limes but the bottle variety! Didn't make much difference. I also used bell pepper pesto instead and fresh bell peppers sauted. Took it to work in a crockpot for a shared lunch and everyone loved it! Will definatly make again.

I'm giving it 3 stars as written. I could tell by just reading the recipe that I was going to need to tweak it. Of course, that's what I always do.
First of all, I grilled the chicken seasoned with fajita seasoning and salt. A little canola oil and the lime juice.
The sauce is pretty much a blank slate and you can infuse it with any flavors you want to suit your palette. I liked the cilantro and lime aspect of it, but it definitely needed more. Definitely salt (omitted from the original recipe maybe? But needed.). I also went with some cumin and fresh cracked black pepper.
No mushrooms for me, but I did saute some onions and used chopped green chiles and tomatillo salsa instead of the fresh peppers.
I also used shredded colby jack instead of mozzerella.
Turned it into a 4 1/2 star dish, according to my family and me.
But hey, unless you are baking, recipes are just guidelines.

Our family loved this!! I also have made it for some families at church and always a huge hit! It tastes very similar to Carlos 'O Kelly's "Suiza Con Pollo".  The sauce seemed a little runny, but once baked it was perfect...no need to alter.  I cut up the chicken, poblano peppers, jalapeños, garlic and added cumin, chicken seasoning (since I didn't have fajita seasoning in hand) and garlic powder and salt.  I let this sit in the fridge for a couple hours before cooking helped the flavors stronger.  AMAZING!

It was easy to make. My children loved it and asked me to make it again. I substituted more poblanos for the jalapenos. They are much less spicey. I also skipped the butter in the sauce and whisked the flour into the half and half before heating it. I used precooked chicken instead of the chicken breasts. As for the salt, I salted and peppered the white sauce to taste before layering the casserole. Next time I'm going to make extra sauce so I can add a melting cheese to the extra and serve it over chicken breasts. Thank you

This was so good!  I followed the recipe mostly, but made a couple of changes.  I added salt to the chicken and the sauce.  I left out the mushrooms, because I just don't like them.  I also threw in a little cumin with the chicken and a little in the sauce.  You just can't have a Mexican dish without it!!  I think this might be the missing flavor that most people can't put their finger on.  Everything else was just as the recipe required and it was amazing!  Next time I make this, I may add a few more peppers.  I like it spicy.  I can't wait to heat this up for lunch tomorrow!!  Thanks for the post!

I thought this is a good recipe, even good enough for company. The only additions I made were garlic to the onion mixture and salt to the creamy sauce.

This casserole is a real winner. It has incredible flavor and texture and contains only fresh ingredients. Since I didn't have mushrooms on hand, I put in  one small chopped onion instead. I added a little chicken broth to the cream mixture and salt to taste. I will make this again and again.

I seasoned the chicken ahead of time in a zip lock bag, using garlic power, onion powder, Mexican seasoning, oregano, salt and pepper.  I let it marinade for about two hours.    I used 1 jalapeno and my store only had large green chilies of which I used two.  I followed the recipe and then added a can of fire roasted green chilies to the mix.    For the sauce,  I sautéed ¼ of an onion in the butter, omitted the sour cream, added cumin, cilantro, lime and 1 can of store bought green enchilada sauce (OMG! I could have licked the saucepan).  I shredded the chicken as opposed to chopping.  I grated some cheddar and added it along with mozzarella.    I spread sauce over the first layer of tortillas before adding the chicken mixture and cheese and alternated that method until I ran out of chicken.   I think this is an outstanding recipe even if I haven't even taken it out of the oven yet!

This is restaurant quality!!  The only changes I made:  omitted the mushrooms and added fajita seasoning to the chicken.  I forgot to add the lime juice to the sauce but it still turned out great!  I will add it in next time.  This recipe is a keeper!!!

This recipe was good, but could of used a little more seasoning. To me it tasted a little better the next day.  When you make this don't forget to add salt even though it dosen't call for it.

Ok, I admit I eyeballed all the ingredients but I'm still giving it 5 stars. I made this with two medium chickie breasts that I diced into bite-sized pieces, browned in butter with some taco seasoning, then added the peppers and garlic as stated. This turned out so good - Husband was literally licking the plate. Not sure how the leftovers will fare - the corn tortillas look really soggy. Oh well. Great recipe. Thanks so much!

Really quite good! Not hot a my wife was concerned but a balanced mixture of flavors.  I would even use more poblanos and maybe another jalapeno to amp it up a bit.  Great recipe that can be tweaked to meet individual tastes.

Made this recipe for dinner tonight and it turned out pretty good. I followed some of the tips from previous reviews. Left out the mushrooms and added some of the roasted pablano pepper to the sauce. Sauce was too thick and needed salt. I will make this again with the sauce much thinner. Pretty good dish!

Great starter recipe. You'll want to tweek it for your family or guests. I defatted the roux by skipping the sour cream and didn't use mozzarella (no taste) and added monterey jack. could use cheddar too. I also threw in 1-2 tsp.ground cumin and chili powder into the meat while it was cooking. My family loved this recipe though and I will definitely make it again. Thanks-

There were mixed reviews on this dish and I thought I could spice it up with no problem with taco seasoning, garlic salt, and more lime.  That didn't happen and I was disappointed that it was still so bland tasting.  I served this to others....no raves here either.  Sorry

I made it but using my own take on the recipe. I used butter, chicken, bell peppers, onion, garlic and green chili. Then for second part used milk, butter, corn starch (gluten free), Greek yogurt, cilantro and mushrooms. Then used Colby jack to layer. Served with fresh avocado. I added more green chili to mine as I plated but left mild for Kids. It was yummy.

This was so good!  I halved the recipe since it was just three of us eating, and it turned out great. I couldn't find poblano peppers at the store, so I used Anaheim chilies and Monterey Jack cheese instead of mozzarella. I will definitely be making this again.

Although I didn't use Poblanos, I used the hotter version of green chilies from New Mexico called Sandia and wow was it tasty! Great for company and very easy to make!

Easy recipe to make.  Actually roasted our own pablanos.  The Alfredo sauce needed something more.  It was a bit bland.  Maybe not enough salt and pepper.  We added a homemade salsa to the top and it helped.

This was amazing.  I followed other reviewers rx and seasoned chicken with cumin, garlic powder and salt.  I cut down on the chicken a little and shredded it, only used 2 jalapenos, added onions, cilantro and be generous with the lime.  absolutely double the sauce.  Next time I may try pepper jack cheese.

I made this for the first time and loved it! I did make some changes to cut a few calories.  Used half the amount of half and half and 2% milk for the other half and used only half of the cheese.  Still tasted very rich. I will make this one again.

Make sure to season the chicken well with cumin, chili powder and paprika or  fajita seasoning.  Then I cooked 3 chicken breasts cut into half.  Afterword while shredding the chicken I cooked the vegetables then mixed everything together. Also used 3 roasted pablano peppers, red onion, and red bell pepper .  Then I added 1/2 block of cream cheese (4oz) which really helped the chicken from not drying out.  I also doubled the sauce with 1/2 bunch cilantro and had extra leftover for the next day.  Turned out fabulous. Whole family loved it

This is really good!!  I didn't have corn tortillas, so I used tortilla chips and it was great.  Also, I used a little milk instead of the full amount of half and half in order to save calories.  I used 3 poblano's instead of just 2.  very flavorful!  And my kids, who don't like mushrooms, never knew the difference b/c I cut them up so small.  :)   Oh, and i grilled the chicken b/c  my hubs can do that while I'm messing with all the other ingredients.  Keeper!

yes i used cheddar and Monterrey jack cheese instead of mozzarella i roasted and peeled the pablanos too.we loved it !next  time i will cook the tortillas in hot oil briefly to soften them that will make it even better.salting the chicken over night or at least a few hours beforehand will really improve the flavor of the chicken too.i added salt to the dish as well.

I thought it came out very good, I did decide to leave out the mushrooms though and add more seasoning to the chicken. Otherwise it was delicious, my wife and I will be making this dish again.

I would definitely make this recipe again! I made a few minor changes... Shredded the chicken instead of cubed... Used shredded pepper jack cheese instead of mozzarella... Used 1 whole lime when preparing the chicken...  The flavor was very savory but will increase the jalapeños next for a little more of a kick.

This was so good. I added a red can of tomato sauce with jalapenos to the sauce. I did not use Mozzarella, but a mixture of Colby jack and pepper jack cheese. I roasted the peppers and only used two whole jalapenos, scraped the cooked peppers into the sauce too. Really, really good.

Made this the other night, it was ok, my husband liked it but I agree with alot of the other reviews the cream sauce was a little bland, had to pour some cholula on it for some flavor.  I will probably make it again but alter the cream sauce, and maybe use some green verde sauce.

Our family loved this recipe - but I did make a few changes to it, to use what we had in the fridge and pantry to avoid an extra trip to the store! I used red/yellow bell peppers rather than poblanos and jalepenos, omitted the mushrooms (no one at our house likes them), used sharp cheddar rather than mozzerella, and used 3-4 ounces of sour cream instead of 2 ounces (light, rather than regular). I was surprised and delighted with the ease of putting this together, and the fact that my "modified Alfredo" sauce came out absolutely perfect, as I often have trouble with those. I would recommend using perhaps 18-24 corn tortillas, as mine seemed to disappear in the recipe, but it was delicious nonetheless. I also loved the fact that it was a time saver to make this casserole-style.

It was yummy.  I read the reviews before I cooked it so I took some advice from some of the other ladies.  I doubled the sauce and my family loves spicy so i seeded only the poblano peppers, leaving the seeds in the other peppers.  It was good.  I really liked the sauce.

We did not love this dish. I had very high hopes and was very disappointed. The taste was very bland, and not at all spicy like I thought it would be. We ended up covering it in salsa for flavor. I should have taken the advice of others and used fajita seasoning. I don't plan to make this again :(

I've been looking for this receipe ever since my dad died a 1 1/2 ago. Was delighted to find it here on this site. Made it for the first time today & it was wonderful. Had to make a few minor adjustments due to lack of proper ingredients; but it still came out great.

I thought this was a very intersting way to make enchiladas. I have never seen them made with the half & half style sauce. To cut fat in the recipe, I used fat free chicken broth and only 1/2 Tbsp butter to cook the chicken.I also used fat free half & half and sour cream. very tasty!

Was a little disappointed in this recipe, had pretty good flavor, but wasn't as flavorful as hoped. Maybe adding some onion and cumin would have helped. Also one whole bunch of cilantro seemed to be too much, it seemed to overwhelm the whole recipe. Did not add the mushrooms, didn't think they really fit with a "mexican" dish, and didn't miss them. Will probably make again with some of my own changes.

We've tried this a few times and I would recommend reducing the mozzarella cheese to about 2 cups--it is much better this way.  Delicious recipe!

This was excellent.  I made several modifications because of ingredients I had on hand.  I used 6 flour tortillas, 2 cups Monterray Jack cheese, and milk instead of half and half, no mushrooms or pablano peppers.  Even with all the changes this was an excellent meal!  My husband said this tasted like meals we had eaten in a restaurant.  Thanks for this recipe!

Overall, this recipe was good.  I did take some suggestions and added some chili powder to the cooking chicken, and I also added chili powder and rooster sauce to the cilantro sauce.  It added just enough to keep it from being completely bland.  However, my tortillas on the bottom seemed to stay very dry, but it could've been the brand I used.  I liked it pretty well, and my sweetheart said it would've been better without the tortillas.  I may make it again, maybe using flour tortillas instead.

I really enjoyed this but thought it needed a little something extra so added salsa at the end.  Also, I would use less cheese next time. My son choked on the cheese it was so thick on top. Easy to lighten up with non fat half and half and sour cream.  Definitely a keeper.

I felt this recipe lacked flavor and the texture was too creamy and cheesy.  I'm not sure what would make it better, but the recipe makes a lot.

This was not bad, but the sauce was too 'gravy' tasting to me.  I will try again with some adjustments and instead of the sauce I will use the White Cheese Sauce from this site.

Our whole family loved this one!  Even my picky, picky kids cleaned their plates!!!  We added 1/2 the cliantro and peeled the poblano's skin too.  I only had 1/2 of the mozzarella so we added Monterey Jack for the rest of the cheese.  Very Yummy......
