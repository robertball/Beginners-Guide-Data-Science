Very good. The bonito was a nice change from the normal miso soup I've made. Really gives a good depth of flavor. I added shitake mushrooms too and used Chickpea miso.

Delicious and fairly quick and easy to make. I was getting sick of the packets of powdered "miso" soup, since there are no Japanese restaurants or Asian grocery stores nearby, so I ordered most of the ingredients online (with the exception of the tofu and green onions). I made this recipe immediately after I got all the ingredients together. So much tastier than the instant stuff you can buy. It was well worth having to hunt down the ingredients and wait for them to arrive in the mail just to make this. I could eat miso every day.

It's my first time making it and I'm surprised how easy it is! It tasted different from the miso soup I get from eating out, perhaps because I used white miso paste. The taste was not very strong but still good. I understand now why Japanese drink miso soup for breakfast as it can be filling. I omitted the spring onions as I didn't have any at hand too. Thank you for sharing the recipe!

Loved it! I made this exactly as written for my daughter and she loved it. She said it tasted just like the soup at her favorite Japanese restaurant. I also made a version without the fish flakes for me (I’m allergic) and I enjoyed it more than any miso I’ve ever had. I used gluten free brown miso. Thank you for the recipe.

Made this for lunch today and it was very good...not quite as robust as I would have liked but that is probably because I used a white miso paste (all I could find at Whole Foods) so next time I will use yellow or red miso instead. I also added an extra teaspoon of the wakame because I like seaweed and thought it needed a little more. Overall, very good and true to what you get at the sushi restaurant.

Super easy and much more delicious than the restaurants! I add a splash of sake when I put in the bonito flakes. The shelf stable tofu, firm is the same texture you get at a restaurant. I use a combination (1/2 and 1/2) of white and red miso paste. It’s the perfect flavor combo for my family.

I added a bag of chopped kale and spinach mix, and enjoyed it very much.  The ONLY thing I would change, would be I would press my tofu so that it soaked up the broth.  Mine was still *raw* tasting, which I still like.... but would have preferred the broth flavor more.

I really enjoyed making this soup for my ?ohana (family).  The reaction of their faces said it all!  They said it was as if they were eating in Tokyo, Japan.  Lol.  Amazing how the fish flakes make the brown soup!  Big mahalo’s to the Chinese and Japanese Cultures for introducing miso to the world!

I used kelp granules and miso broth concentrate instead of paste.  Also used full seaweed leaves (dried), cooked them cut them then added back to the soup.  Delicious, authentic.

My husband loves being able to have miso whenever he wants and I've enjoyed playing with various add-ins.  This is definitely a keeper!

Fantastic - wish I could find an authentic Tofu Ginger recipe that replicates a dish I have at at a Thai restaurant.

This recipe actually beats the Miso soup at my favorite sushi place.  

Thank you All Recipes!

I made the mistake of using sushi roll- type seaweed instead of wakame, so it kind of disintegrated. Despite that, this was a delicious soup! I will make it often (once I get some wakame.)

I found it too strong in the end, so I added much more water to reach my desired level of strength. I also think there should be less tofu,  but with these changes it was a perfect miso soup to me.

Good basic recipe.  Had to make it with red miso since that's what I had on hand, next time I will try it with white or yellow.

I tried the recipe with the broth instead of just water and it made it way too salty, otherwise I loved the flavor and textures. I will definitely make it again!
