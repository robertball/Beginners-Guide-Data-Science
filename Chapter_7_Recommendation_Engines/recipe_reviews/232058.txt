Dave was right in describing his recipe.  We did come back for seconds.  We loved it.  My changes were minimal.  I used Johnsonville Italian sausage so I didn’t need to drain the grease, and I used two large fresh garlic cloves finely minced, sautéing them in just before I added the tomatoes and sauce.    My husband has already requested I make it again.  Thanks Dave!

Found this recipe when I was in search of something to do with the Italian sausages I had sitting in my fridge. This was great! I enjoyed having the sausage in the sauce instead of your typical beef sauce. It gave it a nice flavor. I baked half the batch to eat and I froze the remaining half for a future dinner. It was so good!

I used ground turkey and ground italian sausage, loved it. Also used a regular diced tomatoe. Remember that the frozen tortellini expands, one bag should be enough.

My six year old decided he wanted to make dinner "all by himself," and he and I poked around the Allrecipes website until we agreed on this recipe. I subbed in a bag of frozen bell peppers and onions, so he wouldn't have to cut anything, and the bag of tortellini we used was larger than 9 oz...16 oz maybe? Anyway, we used the whole thing. It came out really well, everyone ate a ton, and my six year old thinks he's the chef of the year.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very good recipe! I was looking for a new way to do some tortellini and I thought a bake would be good! I changed this up A LOT actually but same basic concept. I'm from east Texas so I put some of my natural flavoring to it and actually used deer meat that I marinated in Pinot noir and balsamic. Also added black olives right before I put it in the pan to bake. Turned out amazing though! The black olives are a great touch! Good recipe though!!

For a family of five and Feeding 5 kids (2 who were guest) can be a challenge for picky eaters.  I always have left overs!!  Wanted to try something different than the traditional spaghetti. Found this recipe hoping the kids would like it.  The only change I made was I used Sweet Italian sausage patties (fresh) as it was my first time making it, and I did have Italian garlic bread. Wouldn't you know it! 2nds and 3rds!! No left overs!! It was a hit and something different!! Will make again!

It was so good but I did add garlic to my spicy Italian sausage mixture; and I let it simmer for about 20 minutes but served it with a salad and some Parmesan cheese and garlic bread... Didn't have no leftovers... I will be making it again.

No green pepper here, don't care for it. Used minced garlic and omitted the garlic powder. Otherwise made this as written. A good quick meal that satisfied us. Will make this one again.

This was not a food "revelation," but my whole family liked it, so that's a huge bonus for me.

The only thing I changed was the tortellini cook time in the pot.  I only cooked them for about 3 minutes in a rolling boil, and let the sauce in the oven do the rest.

I simplified the recipe by using a jar of chunky tomato pasta sauce with garlic and onions already in it.  I used Shady Brook Farm's Hot Italian Turkey Sausage which is took out of the casing and broke up as I browned it.  Then I added the  pasta sauce.   I used one pound of frozen cheese tortellini cooked according to the instructions on the package.  Those three ingredients were combined and poured into the baking pan.  About one and a half cups of shredded mozzarella were used - two just seemed like too much to me.  I baked as directed in the original recipe and it came out great!  My husband really liked it, too.  I will definitely make this again.

This was very good!! My picky son and husband loved it! I did make a few changes. Instead of bulk sausage I used mild Italian sausage links. I boiled them first (10 min) then put them in the frying pan. Once done I removed the casing and cut them up and put the onion and green pepper in and went from there.  At cooking time I covered the baking dish with foil for 20 min then uncovered it and cooked for 5 more min. It was Perfect, the cheese was melted perfectly!! Will def be making again :) yummy

Made this once before and it was a big hit, now I’m catering this recipe for my brother’s get together. For sure. A great hit with anyone, only change I made this time is half is made with sausage the other half no meat because he has non meat eating guests, hence the aluminum foil barrier in the middle.

Delicious!!! Made this a few nights ago and my family and I loved it!  I made a few adjustments but only because of our families personal taste preferences.  I added half of a small can of tomato paste to the tomato mixture, used half an onion, and used fresh mozzarella pearls mixed in with the mixture prior to topping it with shredded mozzarella and baking.  Was phenomenal!

Just finished making this dish for dinner tonight. It was a hit! I didn't change a thing, just added pepper for that extra lil burn, I used the mild Italian sausage. The whole family loves this. Thanks for posting this recipe. It will surely be added to our dinner rotation.

Hearty and flavorful! Took a bit longer than I normally spend on prep, so I think if I repeated this I'd do like another reviewer and skip a lot of the boiling/simmering. I tried to follow the recipe as closely as possible, the only differences being: I didn't drain the "grease" because for me it was mostly just the onion juice (your sausage may vary), I used a mozzarella/provolone blend (it's what was on hand, still worked), and I left the dish in the oven for a little less than 20 minutes because my dish was biiiiiit too small to handle the final mixture and I feared spill-over.  But I should have left it in for the full time; only a tiny bit of cheese spilled over and everything else seemed to be staying in place. I should have trusted the cheese. It knew what it was doing.

It turned out absolutely delicious the entire family liked it, including the picky eaters. I added a few extra seasonings to the meat peppers and onions mixture mainly Italian seasonings and cayenne pepper.  Next time i think i may add some half and half or whipping cream only to make the sauce thicken a bit more and become a lil creamy under the cheese top.

It's a KEEPER in our house.  Sometimes I add a little more tortellini to the recipe because 9 ounces is not enough.

Made this tonight and it was delicious! I added some sliced mushrooms and used a spicy sausage. My husband and I ate so much we had belly aches. I used 19oz of tortellini and divided into 2 9x9 dishes and froze one. I’ll definitely make this again!

Great flavor and taste. It seems kinda like a thick sauce with meat in it though. We bought the 50 cent bread from Jimmy John's and put it on that and it was delicious!

Very good. Used a sprinkle of fennel seeds with the onion, not having any fennel available, and penne instead of rigatoni for the same reason. It turned out well.  Will make it again.

This was very good! I did not summer the sauce as long as the directions said. I simmered it maybe 12-15 minutes total. I added extra garlic because I like it. Will make this again.

Great idea for an Italian dish! I tweeked it a little myself, though. Instead of marinara sauce, I used pasta sauce. When cooking the sausage with the onion and green pepper, I  added some minced garlic.  Also, instead of just garlic powder, I added some basil, oregano, salt, pepper, and a little bit of sugar. Perfection!

I followed the instructions very closely with ingredients I had on hand.  I used spicy Johnsonville sausage & spinach & cheese stuffed tortellini. I did place the casserole under the broiler for a few minutes at the end which resulted in a slightly crunchy top.  This recipe is easy, versatile as far as ingredients, & absolutely delicious.  I baked half of the mixture and froze the rest to use for a quick dinner in the future.

I had 24 oz of tortellini so I just doubled everything. I also added mushrooms because we love them.Added some red pepper flakes as we like a little heat.  Was great heated up the next day.

My husband loves spicy Italian sausage so I gave it a try.  It was delicious!!!!  My husband raved and said it was “company worthy”!!  I did sprinkle in some red pepper flakes which REALLY made it hot along with the spicy sausage. Probably wouldn’t do that again.  Great, great dinner!!!  Will definitely make this again!!

I made recipe exactly as stated as I always do when trying a new one and really it was great as is.  Sometimes I throw in extra veggies or spices just to get rid of them.  Excellent recipe.

Made this recipe! Used ravioli instead and meatballs added lots of mushrooms and it worked just fine! Versatile...you can put other things in you may have in your fridge or freezer.

Added more garlic and left out the bell pepper (picky kiddos and boyfriend loves garlic).  All in all, great recipe.  My boys and boyfriend have already asked me to make it again.

I changed the recipe a little.  Instead of tortellini I folded in penne .  This is a easy one pan meal.  I had garlic bread on the side.  So good.

I used hot Italian sausage and my husband loved this dish!  I am not a fan of Italian foods, but it looked and smelled delicious.  I followed the recipe to a "T" and it was a hit.

Turned out perfect.. added Italian seasoning to the meat as it was cooking.. also added key west seasoning to spice it up.    But the timing was right on. Used turkey Italian sausage.

This was really easy and good. I used 1pkg of spicy Italian sausage from Costco (about 1 and 1/3 lb) and refrigerated cheese tortellini from Costco. Because the tortellini had already been precooked, I eliminated the boiling process (and an extra pot to clean!). Will probably double the garlic next time since my family really loves it. If you like your pasta saucy, you will want to keep covered during the simmering and possibly add a bit of water to it. Make sure to stir a few times during simmering too. This was super simple, and a great, hearty weeknight meal. Thanks for the recipe!!!

I made this a few times already :) the first time I made it as the recipe said to and the sausage I used had a spice to it so my daughter wasn't a fan but the rest of my family loved it! So the next time I followed the recipe again except I used maple sausage. And everyone loved it once again! Except this time so did my daughter :) great recipe. I have added this to our family favorites!

Giving this 5 stars for creativity.  Not sure tortellini is the right noodle for a baked dish, but plenty of good ideas in this recipe to improvise with.

This was great! Made it almost as written.  I used Barilla 3 cheese tortellini bc I couldn't find frozen tortellini, I just cooked that according to the pasta package and then mixed it in.  I also didn't use all the marinara, but I would next time. Its important to let the marinara, peppers and onions simmer together to reduce water content.  DONT SKIP that, but if you don't have time, just add less marinara sauce and I think it would compensate.  This was delicious. My kids loved it, hubs loved it.  Great recipe.

Super  easy and very  delicious     Followed the recipe exactly except I used a bigger  (20 oz maybe ) package of tortellini.  There was plenty of  sauce and cheese to  cover. I served it with  a tossed salad with balsamic vinaigrette  dressing.  Will definitely make this again.

This was good.  I didn't put in the green pepper and the diced tomatoes.  I just didn't think the recipe needed it.  I did add some oregano and basil since I didn't use the Italian tomatoes.

Very good. We don't love green peppers, so I only used a half. The only thing I would change is to use more tortellini.

I loved this dish! Here are the things that I did slightly differently (yes, I know how annoying that is, but I think some of this could prove helpful to others): 1) I left out the green pepper and added a little minced garlic; 2) I used a full pound (16 ounces) of frozen tortellini, and 3) I rinsed out the marinara jar with less than 1/4 cup of red wine and threw it into the pan.

This is becoming a regular dish I cook at home, and it's one of my husband's favorites. I usually add some additional spices, like salt/pepper, Italian seasoning, and fennel seed.
This is a great recipe! Thanks!

This is now my family's #1 Dish! This dish was soooo good!!! I did add some beef as well as the Italian sausage which worked well.  I cooked the dish on Mother's day and my family was asking when was I going to make it again! I did make it four days later and it was still delicious! I wonder how mushrooms will work with it?

We aren't big green pepper fans so I left that out and added fresh crushed garlic. Delicious! Even my 4 and 1 year olds were downing it which is always a huge win! Thanks!

Definitely a hit! The boyfriend loved it. Says tortellini is his favorite now. Next time I may chop the tomatoes a little smaller or cook longer to break them down more. Probably will do two alternationing layers of meat mixture and mozzarella cheese instead of too much on top. Flavors were fantastic though!

My absolute favorite recipe I have come across! Never have any complaints with this one. I use the Italian sausage filled tortellini and sometimes I add in pepperoni, other than that I follow the recipe as is. This really is an amazing dish :)

This was sooooo good. I had some leftover spaghetti sauce, so just added a can of Italian diced tomatoes and only half onion and bell pepper and it was perfect flavor. Made enough so we have another note to enjoy!!

The one change for us was using Italian turkey sausage. I buy a favorite marinara sauce & used Delmontes diced tomatoes with basil, garlic & oregano. I love a recipe that actually makes the amount advertised. By taking the time to cook the sauce down the flavors were intense. I served this with a small salad & garlic bread. There are just 2 of us & this serves 6 easily. Will have a second meal In a couple of days. Hate to freeze this as I don't want it watery. This is definitely a keeper for a larger crowd.
