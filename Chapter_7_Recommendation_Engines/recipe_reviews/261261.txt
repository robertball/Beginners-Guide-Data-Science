Very tasty! This recipe is not hard but a bit of a hassle in my opinion. When I bake things in the oven I like to stick it in and be done with it until it is ready. This one has several steps so you can't do that but it was very worth it in the end. I recommend getting your mushrooms started while the oven is pre-heating so that they are done when the 15 minutes is up on the chicken. I do not know which chain restaurant specializes in this dish so I cannot compare it to that but this is a really good tasting recipe.

Very simple and very tasty. I followed the recipe to a tee.  DH said this can be repeated.

Similar to my Mothers Smothered Chicken recipe, except we throw the raw onions and mushrooms, a mix of white and portabella or exotic blend into the dish with the raw chicken, you add chicken broth 1/2, Worcestershire sauce about 1/3 a cup, white wine (a sprinkle) and soy sauce into the glass baking dish with the boneless skinless chicken thighs.  Bake at 375 for 35-45 minutes pull it put and put either mozorella or provolone cheese slices over the chicken and let it melt.

Spoon chicken/mushrooms and sauce from dish over white rice and serve.

This is really good.  I added garlic (of course) and it was a huge hit.

I love to try new chicken dishes that are low carb and this recipe fit that bill nicely. I only made one change in that I used thyme instead of oregano as I think,ended up being a better choice with the list of ingredients of mushrooms,wine,and cayenne pepper. Really moist chicken!  I don't understand why another reviewer thought it was a bit of a hassle to make because ither then the chopping of mushrooms and onions, I thought it was easy .I did  sauteed chicken thighs instead of chicken breasts,then took the thighs out and sauteed the onions and mushrooms with the wine and other ingredients in the same pan for a few minutes then added them to the chicken thighs and baked it all together. I thought it was a downright tasty well put together dish!

Followed directions exactly, easy to make.  Did not like the oregano flavor, seemed odd in this dish.   I like other smothered chicken recipes on this site better, like from Brian DeSaw.
