This is a great meatloaf recipe. In fact I still have the original card from Great American Recipes I got in the mail that it came on.  If you don't want it to be mushy, use lean ground beef (90/10) and put in extra bread crumbs until you get the desired consistency. I use italian style bread crumbs.  Also, for the mustard use dijon. I use 1/8 tsp. of cayenne pepper instead of crushed red pepper. You may have to cook it for 50-55 minutes depending on your oven.  I also double the sauce and add more brown sugar to it.

This dish was a big hit with my husband! However, I made a few modifications...like suggested in a previous review, I omited the tomato juice and added worcestire instead.  I used a mix of ground pork and beef, chili sauce instead of ketchup for more tang, added minced garlic and used panko (japanese breadcrumbs) instead of fresh.  I doubled the sauce and replaced 2 tlbs of the brown sugar with maple syrup.  It was great and not all crumbly!

A good friend called and asked if I had a good meatloaf recipe for her husband (he's got cancer).  I don't like meatloaf myself, but this looked like the reviews were good, so I gave it a shot.  It was a huge hit!  I served it with red mashed potatoes, broccoli in lemon butter, and chocolate cake.  People are still talking about it!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was my first attempt at meatloaf, and it turned out wonderful.  It's also the first time I have made something that tasted better than what my mom used to make. I didn't have enough ketchup, so I used about a 1/4 cup in both the meat and the sauce and added an extra 1/4 cup of tomato juice in both to make up for it.  I was worried that it would be too runny, but it wasn't.  It wasn't too sweet either, and it held together really well.  So good, I had seconds :)

#1 Meatloaf Ever! This recipe is what brought me to allrecipes.com. I originally got it over 10 years ago in their printed cards that came in a box. For children, I only use 1/2 the red pepper flakes but don't leave out completely (adults prefer full amount). I use homemade whole wheat bread crumbs (tastes same as white but healthier). I also add 1/2 teaspoon chopped garlic but it's not necessary. Best with extra lean ground beef, which has less fat to drain. 
Tip: don't line loaf pan with foil as meat still sticks & it gives a tinny taste. I use parchment paper or better yet, an unlined, ungreased silicone loaf pan. I always make 2 & freeze 1, unbaked. Great with mashed potatoes & corn. Many thanks for the only meatloaf recipe my family will ever use!

This is absolutely the best! Served to over 100 people at church in 12 different loaves and was asked for the recipe over and over. There were so many people that told me they didn't even like meatloaf but were only being polite, until they ate mine! This is great!

This is my new meatloaf recipe.  I omitted the tomato juice and used worstshire instead, I also used ground turkey.  It was fantastic, I can't wait to get home to heat up the leftovers!

I found this recipe to have a good flavor, though I like my meatloaf a bit more solid.  I began making it as called for, but the mixture seemed a bit too loose so I reduced the tomato juice to 1/2 cup and added another 1/2 pound of ground beef before baking.  If I make it again, I'll omit the juice altogether, and use small cubes of stale bread rather than the crumbs.

I love the sauce. When I made it the second time I doubled the sauce and poured some over the meat loaf when served. One of the best meat loafs I have had.

Very good basic meatloaf. I replaced the pepper with Montreal steak seasoning. Very good and even my kids had seconds which they usually don't do.

I have been looking for YEARS to find a meatloaf recipe that everyone would enjoy and FINALLY came across yours and my family LOVED it! 

I didn't have tomato juice and was going to use tomato sauce instead, but I didn't have that either sooo I used Worsheshire sauce in place of the juice and didnt have enough of that so I just added a little more ketchup. I also put salt, pepper and a clove of fresh minced garlic to the meatloaf.... it was YUMMULISHIOUS! And the red peppers added just the right touch! A+ thank you for the great recipe!

Was one of the best.  Used 1/2 turkey 1/2 buffalo, so I added a little EVO for moisture.  I've used the topping for pork chops.  A definite favorite.

Great comfort food.  Did add some steak sauce, garlic, thyme, oregano and worcestershire to the beef for extra flavor.  Baked for 45 minutes on a broiler pan, which allowed the grease to drain off the meat as it cooked, adding the topping in the last 15 minutes.  Delicious.

This was the first meatloaf I ever made that didn't turn out to be a disaster, because it uses a 9x5 loaf pan, which is all I have right now.  Not only was it not a disaster, but it was delicious.  I only made about half of the sweet topping because my fiance and I have no sweet tooth at all, and it was perfect!

This meatloaf is fantastic and I'm not a huge meatloaf fan. I will be making this one again in the future for sure! I followed the recipe exactly except for lining the pan in foil for baking and I drained some fat about 1/2 way through. I also don't like onions so I made 1/2 of the loaf without. It was excellent! Thanks for sharing=)

I WAS ONLY MAKING THIS FOR TWO PEOPLE SO I THOUGHT I WOULD TRY IT MEATBALL STYLE INSTEAD OF MEATLOAF. TURNED OUT GREAT. IT REMINDED ME OF MY MOM'S MEATLOAF. VERY GOOD.

I loved this recipe! The only thing I did different was use ground venison. It was all I had but it still turned out great! My Boyfriend doesn't trust when I cook new things(although I've never made anything he didn't like) he didn't want to try it until it was almost gone....then regretted he hadn't gotten a chance to eat more of it! The sauce is great, i'm definately going to double it next time.

We liked this version and will definitely make it again but I had to cook it for over an hour at 400-425. The only changes I made were to use oats and cayenne instead of bread and crushed peppers, and omit the glaze. I made this uncovered on the top rack of the grill and when it was done there was no extra moisture in the pan but the meat wasn't dry at all(which is my problem with most recipes). I had a slight problem with the slices not holding together but I should have used a spatula.

My first attempt at meatloaf, and it was perfect! I used Italian bread crumbs and baked for 55 minutes to an internal temperature of 160 degrees. My boyfriend ate almost half the loaf! Thanks for the recipe! ^_^

For my first meatloaf, this came out awesome! Had no leftovers!! did replace the tomato juice for worcestire, a little more bread crumbs and doubled the sauce to put on top. cooked for an extra 10 mins (may just be my oven) No pink but very tender and fell apart rather easily. That wasn't a problem though! simple and delicious! will make again.

I am not big on meatloaf but I love this!  My husband and son love it too.  When they ask what's for dinner and I say meatloaf they are happy.  I use ground red pepper instead of the crushed red pepper.  The mixture for the topping is so much better than just plain ketchup on top.

This is almost too moist. It was good, not the best I've had. Maybe better the next day as a sandwich filling. Must follow reviewers suggestion on putting the dry bread under the meat before baking, I did not. I used lean beef but after cooking the oil came up and mixed with the topping which was not tastey. Maybe I did it wrong.

I didn't have any crushed red pepper when I made this so I substituted about 1/8 cup (maybe less) of the ketchup with Frank's Wing Sauce and got rave reviews from friends and family. So yummy, thanks for sharing Melissa!

My husband took one bite and said "WOW". This is our new favorite meatloaf recipe. It has just the right amount of spice and tomato. I used quick oats instead of bread crumbs, omitted the tomato juice, increased the amount of ketcup and added worchester sauce. Also used egg whites instead of whole eggs. It was absolutely wonderful!!!

Excellent!  I used a mix of ground beef & Italian sausage, added chopped onion & green pepper.  The flavor was outstanding, & it was even better the next day on a sandwich.

For the past 30 years, I have thrown away more meatloaves than I care to admit. Shameful for a southern boy. FINALLY, I meatloaf I adore (I do double the sauce). Now I can spend the rest of my life trying to make biscuits. My grandmother and great aunts made it looks so, never measuring anything. I am not optimistic.

This was really tasty and juicy. I used Steak sauce instead of ketchup. I doubled the amount of Red Pepper and added dried Mixed Italian Herbs and some Mrs Dash seasoning. 
I omitted the Tomato juice as it was true what another reviewer said about the meatloaf being to 'wet'.
I used 1 pound of Beef and 1/2 pound of Pork as I always find it lends any beef dish a juicy and sweetness.
Would make this again and again.

Good recipe, I enjoyed it but have had better.  My kids told me they preferred the more standard meatloaf recipe.  They commented it was too tomatoey.  I'd suggest leaving out the tomato juice and mustard and add some fresh chopped parsley to the recipe.

This is the most fantastic meatloaf ever, and I've tried many recipies!  Since my husband is Canadian and we always have HP Sauce on hand (a close US equivalent is A1, but A1 has a bit more of a bite), I used 50/50 ketchup/HP sauce, and it was amazing!  Also substituted oatmeat for the breadcrumbs (great way to sneak in the cholesterol leecher when I can).  Made this twice in one week! TY!

My husband said this was the best meatloaf he ever had!  I left out the tomato juice because I felt like it already had enough moisture.  I used herb seasoned stuffing mix instead of fresh bread crumbs. Used 93% lean beef.  Texture was great and was moist.  Will make this one again.

Good flavor. I pretty much followed the recipe - I never really measure on things like this. Just added some minced garlic with the onion because, well, it's GARLIC! I would probably increase the amount of the topping next time - but I will definitely make again.

I've been using this recipe for years!!  My favorite and have received many compliments.  I don't use the fresh bread crumbs.  Have always used 'seasoned  bread crumbs' by 4C
Also, recently I've been doing it half ground chicken and ground beef.  I almost prefer it this way as it makes it lighter and a little healthier.

Teh family loved it...I made the mistake of adding some Zucchini and reduced the amount of beef which made the meatloaf to moist.  But very tasty and we'll try it again for sure.

Very moist and flavorful. Could have used more bread crumbs I think. The sauce on top was ok, a little too tangy for me. But it was good and even my 5 yr. old picky eater loved it!!

Excellent recipe! The only changes I made were omitting the tomato juice, used chili sauce, Worcestershire & minced garlic (as previously suggested) and added a tad of hot sauce and Ray's BBQ sauce to make up for the tomato juice.  I had 2 lbs of ground beef so I let it cook for 50 minutes and it came out perfect.  Will definitely be replacing my old recipe for this one!

Delicious!!  Very reminiscent of my grandmothers meatloaf, and almost any recipe that takes me back in time is going to rate high with me.  I did cut the meatloaf portion in half, but the sauce was made as if for 1 1/2 lbs of ground beef.  This is my new  go to recipe.  Thanks much!!

I followed the directions as best I could on this, but used a sweet/hot German mustard as opposed to yellow.  It turned out great, but a little too mustardy for my family.  Next time I'll try a milder one.  Other than that, I loved it.  4 stars because I altered it.

This is a good recipe to use as a base recipe. I don't follow it to a T because I like adding other ingredients like bacon, hot sauce and BBQ sauce. But even alone it taste great too!

Great tasting meatloaf, by far the best one I've made taste wise.  However, the recipe is a little watery, so I would decrease the juice parts---I used tomato sauce instead of juice, and it was still too 'wet', so less of that.  I also lined the bottom of the pan with 2 cans of whole tomatoes that I sliced in half, which made it nice =)

delicious..The only changes I have made are to add 1/2 pound ground pork sausage (With sage),use 2 pounds burger, and tomato sauce rather than juice..We have even had this when company has come to dinner and they loved it as well, asked for the recipe..I also roast my potatoes in the pan with the meatloaf, I put all in a 11 by 13 pan, this makes them taste so good..

Excellent base meatloaf; instead of crushed red pepper I used 1/4 c Sweet Red Chili sauce from Trader Joe's and packaged Italian bread crumbs, and V8 Juice instead of tomato juice.  Wonderful flavor.

I also have been making this meatloaf for years.  I think it's only downfall is that I NEVER have any leftovers!  I don't even really like the taste of ground beef, but this is delicious!

Awsome.  Used Worcestershire instead of tomoato juice and will maybe add some crushed garlic next time.  Cook time should probably be an hour.

Everybody loved this! I made one without onions for the boys, who don't like onions, but WOW!, this is good meatloaf. Thanks to Melissa for suggesting the foil. You can form the foil on the outside of the pans, then slip the formed foil inside and it will take less fuss to make it fit. Also, prepared mustard is the yellow stuff you squirt on hot dogs. I am embarrassed to admit that I did not know that.

This was my second attempt at meatloaf and it greatly redeemed me! I took the advice of others and added minced garlic, worchestershire sauce, and some milk. The loaf was very moist and my husband was impressed with the ketchup/brown sugar glaze!! (I omitted the mustard) I'll def. make this again (and may try the sauce on some chicken.

I tripled this recipe to make for an event I catered last evening.  It got nothing but positive responses from the diners.  I cooked in on long jelly roll pans and used 85/15 ground beef.  I have added it to my catering recipe book.

Cottage Meatloaf Haiku: "Pleasant and basic. Not 'firm' enough for my tastes. But we still liked it." I don't know if it was the tomato juice, or if I should've increased the bread crumbs, but my meatloaf was too moist and fall-aparty. As far as tastes go, it was still great, but definintely couldn't have translated to leftover sandwiches as it was a bit soggy crumbled. I'd make it again, but probably lose the juice and up the breadcrumbs, otherwise, a nice homey comforting meatloaf recipe.

This was very, very good. Easy to make. I made one small change, I didn't have fresh bread crumbs, so I used half italian bread crumbs and half whole grain oatmeal (uncooked). Came out great. My husband loved it. I will be making this again.

I love the glaze and only made a few changes to the recipe...I didn't use the foil because I used Corningware; altered the 1/2 cup ketchup to ketchup/57 Sauce; added a little garlic powder (forgot I had a fresh one on hand), Mrs. Dash and red pepper flakes.  I also used 1/2 Ritz crackers and 1/2 Italian bread crumbs and tomato cocktail instead of juice, and baked for an hour instead of 45 mins.  Love it!!

Good stuff-the topping makes it sweet, and the red pepper makes it spicy. It was really good.

This reminds me of my mom's meatloaf..I've been looking long and hard to find that!  I wish I had made extra of the sauce to have on the side.  The only changes I had...I didn't have tomato juice, so I used tomato sauce...and the meat I bought was prepackaged with 2/3 beef and 1/3 pork.....oh yeah..I didn't have any red pepper flakes on hand, so I dashed in about 5 shakes of Texas Pete.

I love this recipe .  I have used a similar one for years and everyone loves it.  

For the glaze - Instead of using ketchup, I use an 8 oz can of tomato sauce mixed with 1/4 cup of  brown sugar, I use  and 1-2 tbs of mustard (to your taste).  
I mix half into the meatloaf mixture and pour the rest on top as a glaze.  
I also bake in a ring pan or bundt pan for a different presentation.

Years ago we found this recipe on a recipe card and decided to try it.  This is the best meatloaf I've ever had and we have had many people request this recipe from us over the years.  Takes a little time to prep but definately worth it.

I always say,I'm going to go back and rate a recipe and I never do.  Well, this was the best meatloaf that I have ever had that I made it a point this time to give a review. My husband commented on this being my best meatloaf and he hopes I can duplicate it again.

I made a few changes based on what I had on hand:

2 lbs of ground beef (I moved to a 9x13 pan as the 9x5 was cramped), skipped the vegetable juice, added a garlic pepper blend that I got at the wholesale club, skipped the salt & skipped the mustard. Added huge pieces of chopped onion.  I also skipped adding the topping as I ran out of Ketchup.  I don't think it needed it but I am sure it would taste really good.

This wasn't dry as other meatloafs turn out and I was also able to cut slices easier than I usually can too.

I'd make this again and again and next time try it the way it was written.

Thanks so much for sharing your recipe!

We have made this several times and it always disappears fast. The first time I let it sit a bit before baking and it fell apart after I took it out of the oven. If you don't over mix it or delay baking too long, it is a great, tasty meatloaf! Oh yeah - it makes good cold meatloaf sandwiches, if there are leftovers!

This was a great recipe. I did make a few minor changes to it. I used diced tomatoes instead of the juice. I added some worchester, lemon juice and garlic powder. I also cooked it in a water bath. It was very good though. My husband loved it.

This recipe is great! The only problem I had was that it took over an hour to cook not 35 - 45 minutes like the recipes says. Besides that it is great!

I'm only reviewing this from the boys in this household because I do not enjoy meatloaf. They said it had good flavor and was moist. I did try one bit and agreed on the moistness. I once got advice from an old church member that said to never use lean ground beef for meatloaf so I do stick with a lower ratio ground beef.

This meatloaf was excellent!  I baked it a bit longer than called for, and I loved the crusty edges it made.  The meatloaf was very moist and delicious!  It is now my new meatloaf recipe.  I used a meatloaf pan I bought at Walgreen's, and it worked wonderfully.  No need for aluminum foil.

I was really looking forward to this recipe as my first meatloaf after reading all the reviews. I definitely took the advice of switching tomato juice for Worcestershire sauce and everyone was right in saying that it takes longer to cook... didn't think it would be a whole HOUR longer; and after all that, saying that it was still "moist" is an understatement. It had a great flavor but next time I'm going to eyeball the bread crumbs in because I think the whole problem was that the meat mixture wasn't at all stiff. The sauce wasn't great either. I guess I got used to my late mother's way... she never used a topping, just brown gravy and mashed potatoes. I am going to use this recipe as a "base" recipe but switcheroo it all up next time based on the experience this time. Thanks for the recipe!

This was a little too moist for my personal taste.  I substituted worcestshire sauce for the tomato juice as others suggested and I'm glad I did.  The mustard was a bit too strong for my own personal tastes as well, so I will cut back on it next time.  Overall, this is a good base recipe for meatloaf.  I just need to make a few tweaks for my tastebuds.

Flavor was OK but this meatloaf absolutely fell apart!  Followed recipe except omitted brown sugar in topping because we don't like it sweet.  Probably won't make this again.

Meatloaf turned out very greasy. I used 1/2 ground beef and 1/2 ground turkey which was a mistake. I will not make this again.

I really liked this recipe and would make it again, but I would agree that it falls apart:) My husband also really liked the meatloaf, but asked me to leave the "topping" off next time.

i used the cayanne instead of red pepper. however, for me the crumbs just needed about 1/4 cup more. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was my first time ever making meatloaf and I thought it came out quite well. I made it for my husband and his boss and they both said it was very good! I used worcestshire instead of tomato juice like others suggested. I will be making it again!

This was fine. But it wasn't the best meat loaf I have ever had. I did not use the tomato juice. Maybe that was the problem. It did not fall apart though. My husband did not like it. But he doesn't like anything.

This recipe is one of the best tasting and easiest meat loaf recipes I've ever tried. Even my food-fussy nine year old daughter loves this meatloaf. The only bad thing I could say is that it comes out very moist so I just add a little more bread crumbs and it's perfect!

Very good loaf!!  Only change I made was to put in a very small amount of tomato juice (I'm not a fan of tomato juice)and add some worcestershire sauce.  I put some dry french bread in the food processor to make the fresh bread crumbs - fresh breadcrumbs or torn up bread always better in meatloaf then those dry things you buy at the store in my opinion.  Crushed saltines work well too.  We all enjoyed this meatloaf alot.  Will definately use this recipe again.

This was an easy recipe, no fancy schmancy ingredients, just good old everyday pantry items. My husband and son loved this meatloaf. They ate almost the whole thing by themselves, there's only 2 slices left for hubby's sandwich for lunch tomorrow. I had trouble with mine falling apart even though I let it stand. I would have given this a 3 based on personal tastes (but I have my favorites here).

My husband LOVES this recipe.  No changes.  I do find that I need to cook it about 30 minutes longer than the time shown in the recipe but other than that, it's perfect and extremely tasty.  We make rice or couscous to go with it, and some veggies.  I usually have to double it so we can have a little leftover.

Very flavorful, but came out a bit mushy, even after an extra 20 minutes in the oven. My husband said it reminded him of canned dog food - not very appetizing! It firmed up after being refrigerated, but still a tad muchy when re-heated. Perhaps I did something wrong. But the flavor was great!

Good flavor even though it had difficulty "setting up" after the 10-min hold time. Maybe dry bread crumbs will pull it together a bit more firmly (rather than fresh crumbs).

I have tried many many meatloaf recipes in the past and this is the favorite by far!  Definitely a keeper!  I used dijon mustard instead of prepared mustard and added chopped onions and green peppers.  YUM!!!!

This is my new favorite meat loaf recipe. I'm getting rid of all others. :) It's pretty much idiot proof, and if you don't have quite all the ingredients it's easy to make substitutions. I had no tomato juice so I used milk.  (Afterward I realized I could have used tomato soup, but oh well.) And due to picky eaters, I replaced the crushed red pepper with paprika. I didn't have enough ketchup and ran out to get more while it was in the oven, so the sauce didn't go on until it was almost done. And again because of picky eaters, I stuffed one with pepper jack and one with cheddar. Still turned out fabulous.

Both my son and I have food allergies, so I made the following changes. I used ground Turkey instead of beef and corn bread crumbs instead of regular bread crumbs. I added a small amount of bacon chunks to the top as well and used little tins for portion control and ease of separation for school lunches.

I have tried this recipe twice and my son loves it. I read reviews first and like other viewers I also substituted, Worcester sauce for the tomato juice, and use fresh chopped garlic cloves in the recipe. Awesome recipe.

this is THE BEST meatloaf ever!!!  I've made it a ton of times, and so have lots of people that have tasted mine and asked for the recipe.  I never have tomato juice so I always use tomato sauce or whatever sort of canned tomatoes I might have, puree them with an immersion blender.  This IS super moist, as others have said, and basically falls apart as you're cutting it, but the flavor is just to die for!  Maybe a bit more bread crumbs would solve that problem (I use panko if I don't have fresh) but it tastes so good that it doesn't matter if it's not cut in one solid piece.  Soooo yummy!!

Very good recipe.  I used boar meat instead of ground beef - delicious! I upped the cooking time to 50 mins, and instead of using the recommended sauce, I used a thin brushing of Hoisin sauce.

Hubby loved this meatloaf. It was very moist.  I added a finely shredded carrot just to have some extra vegetables, and it blended well. I think it could have used some extra sauce on top.

Next time, I'll omit the tomato juice as it was too moist/wet.

Otherwise it was delicious!

Used lean ground beef and followed recipe exactly. Took more like an hour to bake and then just fell apart.

Delicious! I couldn't find my recipe as I recently moved so I tried this one. I did omit the tomato juice and used onion powder instead of fresh onions ( it's a texture thing for me) but otherwise followed the recipe.  I'll definitely be making it again.

This is hands down the best meatloaf ever! The only changes I made was instead of regular mustard I used Dijon mustard and instead of plain bread crumbs I used garlic and herb bread crumbs. I have made this recipe before using all the listed ingredients originally from the recipe but this last time I made it I change those two things and it took it to a whole nother level of goodness!

As others have suggested I doubled the sauce. Also I substituted Worcester sauce for tomatoe juice. I also divided and cooked in a muffin pan for 30 minutes applied sauce and then baked 15 minutes more at 365 degrees.

This is the best meatloaf recipe I have ever made, and I have made it numerous times throughout the years.   I used to have the original "Great American Recipes" card, but lost it, and luckily found it posted here!  I use very lean hamburger meat when I make it so it's not as greasy.  I have even made this in my instant pot in 25 minutes! I highly recommend this meatloaf recipe!

I have made this for years since I first received the card about 10 years ago in the mail. I couldn't find it so went to the
best route of searching it on the web. My 11 year old loves it and asked me last night if I could make it today. Great recipe!! I've added my own twist by removing the juice and using tomatoe sauce, a lil cinnamon to the sauce and some time changing up on the seasoning. Love mash potatoes as a side with broccoli.

Awesome recipe. I made this in cupcake tin, for individual portions. I was out of brown sugar so substituted for a teaspoon of sugar and a little syrup. Couldn't tell the difference.

I made this exactly as instructed. No changes. It was so good!!! It'll be my new "go to" meatloaf recipe. It held together very well. I've had trouble in the past with other recipes with it falling apart. I look forward to making this again. Great taste!

I made it following the recipe exactly because it was the first time I made it. It called for simply lining the pan with aluminum foil. Next time I would definitely put it in a drip pan,  so it wouldn't get so mushy setting in the grease.  It was good but there is nothing special about it and I definitely would not hold up to being good for sandwiches the next day as it fell apart too easily.

This was excellent! I used ground venison instead of beef and my homemade verde salsa instead of tomato sauce. I did a double batch and added some thyme and two more eggs so it would hold together good. Foil was awesome idea so I could freeze the extra one. Venison and extra eggs make this a high protein meatloaf.

Been making this recipe for years. But lost my paper recipe!!  EVERYBODY loves this meatloaf. Sometimes (most of the time) I don't have just that splash of tomato juice, so I take 1/3 c. water & add ketchup to it for the right consistency. Don't use pepper flakes. Use a little Tobasco instead. I add some garlic powder, too.

I didn't change a thing.  This is a fantastic recipe.  My family loved it very much.  I used extra lean beef.  Kept this recipe as one of my faves.  Thank you very much.  Dinner was a snap.
Served it with mashed potatoes of course, and loads of fresh in season vegetables.

I too have the original recipe card from Great American Recipes. This is my favorite meatloaf by far! I've tried other recipes over the years and this is still my favorite. the only thing I do differently is I lay a few slices of bacon across the top when I bake it as we have always put bacon on top of meatloaf :)

This is an amazing meatloaf! I make this one all the time and I have passed the recipe on to others. I do double the glaze just so it covers the whole loaf and if I have bacon I put that on top too.

soo good. it's one of the best meat loaf recipes I've tried and liked in a long time  only thing was the recipe needs more bread crumbs I like my meat loaf to be more solid . so maybe I'll add 1 cup-1&1/2 or so of the bread crumbs . Also I left out the tomato juice and added fresh garlic and parsley .and cooked it for 55 mins turned out great

Excellent meatloaf. Made it the other day and turned out fabulous. Made a couple minor changes. I eliminated the tomato juice. Didn't feel it was needed. The onions, I salute for a couple minutes with two cloves of garlic. Followed the rest of the recipe to a T. We loved it! Thank you!!

I was looking for a meatloaf recipe and came across this one and I am so glad I did.  I followed the directions exactly and my husband loved it.  The sauce is especially good, not too tangy.  So I'm making it for the 2nd time tonight.

Best meatloaf I have ever had!! I have used this meatloaf recipe for years. Ever since it came to my mailbox on a card. You have to use a meatloaf pan so the juices can leak through, otherwise it just falls apart. do to how super moist it is.  Mods I use are Tobasco instead of the red pepper, two shredded slices of toasted wheat bread instead of bread crumbs and I double the topping sauce to use after cooking.

This is an excellent meatloaf. I have tried many different versions of meatloaf recipes and this is, by far, the best. The only changes I made were doubling the breadcrumb amount, replacing the tomato juice with worcestershire sauce and replacing the prepared mustard with dry mustard in the meat mixture only. I found it was too soupy without adding more breadcrumbs and the other changes were just personal preference. It turned out fantastic. Make sure you make the topping. It really makes the dish and is quite flavorful.

This surpasses all previous meatloaf recipes I have used. It is the first time my husband did not put ketchup all over the top...he thought it was moist, delicious and especially flavorful.
Following other readers suggestions I made a few "tweaks"..I only used brown sugar in the topping...I substuted worcestshire sauce for the brown sugar in the meatloaf itself. I also used chili sauce in place of the tomato juice.
I must say the results surprised me. Try this recipe you will not be disappointed

My husband absolutely loves this meatloaf. He boasts that he doesn't need to add ketchup when it is served. That is a great compliment!

Made this recipe for my husband's birthday dinner, at his request. It was SO flavorful! The red pepper flake really gives it a kick! I will definitely make this recipe again!

Everyone loved this meatloaf.  Following others' suggestions, I did eliminate the tomato juice and add a little more ketchup and 3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce.  I also subbed Italian Breadcrumbs for plain breadcrumbs and we left out the red pepper just because we don't like that flavor.  The meatloaf was a little mushy at first, but the longer it cooler, the firmer it became.  I really liked the tang the mustard gave the meatloaf and my kids loved the sauce on top.  Will make this again.

Made this last night for dinner.  While it tasted good, the texture was quite mushy even thiugh I cooked it longer than stated.  Maybe I'll try slightly increasing the amount of bread crumbs next time.

As is, I don't think this recipe would turn out too well. I did not make it as directed after reading the reviews of those that did. I made a few of my own substitutions. I used seasoned breadcrumbs, added 2 large garlic cloves, used Worcestershire sauce instead of tomato juice, and added basil, oregano, and parsley. This is an okay base recipe, but I certainly would not like it as much if made as directed compared to my changes. For each their own!

For several years I have been trying different meat loaf recipes so I could get away from the packaged seasoning mix (my husband's favorite).  My husband really liked this one.  He said it had lots of flavor, and I liked the moistness.  I did add chopped bell pepper because our garden has an abundance of it right now, and I added more salt and pepper.  Thanks!

This is super easy and good.  It did seem very like is was very wet going into the oven, but I cooked it on a jellyroll pan and it came it great.

This is a really good recipe.  I substitue instant oatmeal for the bread crumbs due to a wheat intolerence but it worked just fine.  My husband is a little finicky about eating meatloaf but he really loved this.  In fact, after a week he asked me if I would make it again.

Really, really good!  I followed the recipe exactly as written and I was so pleased.  I made a bit more of the topping so that I could serve a bit more if I wanted.  I'm glad I did because it came in handy for the leftovers we were able to eat for lunches.  Thanks for such a great recipe!

Made this the other night for the family...first time..and it was a hit, even with picky (older) kids.  Actually made it the night before and left 20 minutes before totally done, then finished cooking the next night for dinner; great FAST dinner for a weeknight.

I've used this recipe for 16 years.  I just recently lost the card it came on.  I got it in the mail a long, long time ago.  I searched online for it...luckily I remembered the name of it and when I saw the ingredients, I was ecstatic.  You would think I would have the recipe down, by now, but I don't have the exact measuments memorized.
