Very good recipe. The only reason some people can't get them chewy- or the reason they aren't ending up chewy is because if you flatten them with a glass they will bake up crispy. Just flatten them very slightly with your hand and they will do what they are supposed to.

I'd been looking for a good chewy oatmeal cookie and this is the one!  No need to look further.  These are great.  I added 2 tsp. cinnamon but make no other changes.  Will definately be making again.  Thanks Olga!

Best use of six ingredients that I've tasted in some time.  I did add 1 1/2 t. of cinnamon, though.  I kept thinking "where's the eggs, the vanilla, the salt?", but these aren't your average oatmeal cookies.  I found the baking time to be rather flexible, but I did use heavy duty aluminum cookie sheets.

This recipe is quite easy to make. Baking time is very important though, because if you overbake it, they won't be chewy. Unfortunately, I had difficulty finding the right baking time to keep them chewy a day later. 

My husband loved them, but I felt there was just too much butter in the recipe for me to enjoy them.

these turned out very yummy...but i must have done something wrong...they turned out nice but almost like shortbread...tho i wanted chewy i was very pleased with the results...i added some raisins and did bake less time and did not use a glass to flatten...nonetheless...(i also am not a very experienced baker/cookie maker) but i would make these again...

These cookies seemed to me to have too much butter, as another reviewer remarked.  Mine turned out crumbly, and the texture was more like a pastry than the chewy cookie I was looking for.  But they were very easy to whip up just before the kids got home from school, and my kids enjoyed them immensely.

I have never made oatmeal cookies before and they sure were a hit.  I added 1 cup of raisins per the request from the family.  Next, time I will not roll the balls of dough in sugar, to see if they are just as yummy.  The ingredients are easy to find and assemble.  I will be making them again.  Thank you!

Wonderful recipe!  I added two cups of raisins.  I used a large ice cream scooper to make six really large thick cookies and added about two - three minutes to cooking time, but keeping a close eye.  I wanted a chewy & sweet oatmeal cookie, and these are excellent!

Yummy!  I added dried cranberries to make them more festive and Christmas-y.  They were delicious!  I will definately use this recipe again.

A very easy cookie to make but seems to be lacking something.  I added cinnamon but next time will try some of the other reviewers' sugggestions, i.e. adding an egg, vanilla, salt, or cutting back on the margarine.

Brilliant and so quck and easy! My first attempt at oatmeal cookies and they looked delicious and tasted better than any other I've ever had! I made 12. I wanted to keep them a bit chewier than usual so I added a tablespoon of golden syrup.

I was looking for a recipe that was similar to a mix I used in a bakery I once worked at. It produced chewy, dense cookies that were full of flavour. This was it! I never would have thought to omit egg and use just soda for leavening. Slightly crispy on the outside, chewy inside. I stored them in a sealed container and they were still chewy 2 days later. The amount of oats seems too much at first but it is perfect. I added 1C raisins the second time I made this and it was wonderful. Thank you so much!

I too have searched for a good chewy cookie like this! I am not a great cook so if I made these taste good then they must be. made a TON so the family was happy. I did not flatten at all, and added Craisens (sp) and they were deelish.

i made these cookies..as a matter o fact, i just gathered them all and put them on a plate...the recipe makes a little more then what i wanted to try for the first time..so i used 1 1/2 c margerine (i am out of butter at the moment) 1 1/2 c brwn sug 1 1/2 c all purpose flour 1 1/2 tsp baking soda 3 c oats....i DID NOT roll them in sugar (for me, the cookies are sweet enough w/out the excess sugar) nor did i smash them down on the cookie sheet with a glass...the dough came out wet so i didn't bother trying to make little balls out of them so i just spooned them onto the cookie sheet, threw them in the oven for 10 mins on 350 degrees, i got about 4 dzn cookies 2 inchs in size. after baking the first 2 dzn, i added 1 1/2 cup of raisins to the remaining dough...baked at the same temp for the same time and the result was nothing less then perfection!! this recipe is definately a keeper!! this is great for anyone on any baking level!! thank you for sharing it :)

I Love Love Love this recipe, my husband was sceptic about this recipe due to not containing eggs, BUT they are the Crispy/Chewy oatmeal cookies that i just love to death, if you make them very flat, you can then roll them onto a small rolling pin and make them curl over the pin and they will stay that shape so you could fill it with ur fave. cream & or dip the ends in chocolate. this recipe is Definatly not for someone watching thier wasteline. they are def greasy from all the butter but thats what makes them such a crispy deliciuos cookie that tastes like heaven.

Mmm! Last Wednesday, I had a Dinner Potluck at my house. It was amazing; everyone brought such great food, especially desserts! My friend Francesca brought in 'Francesca's Famous Chocolate Chippies' and they turned out to me dry oatmel with burned chocolate chips...ew! Well, I still LOVE oatmel cookies, and I wanted a good recipe...enter Chewy Oatmel Cookies! I made these with chocolate chips and they were PERFECT! Everyone in the office (the Potluck was over, quite a shame in fact) LOVED them!

I loved how this recipe had so few ingredients as I wanted to use what I had on hand.  I did make a few additions/substitutions based on what I had in house.  I used white whole wheat flour instead of white, and I added apple pie spice, dried orange flavored cranberries and pecans to give it a little extra flavor. I also added in extra oats because I didn't want an overly buttery cookie.  They came out so tasty!!

My husband's absolute favourite cookie!  There is a lot of sugar in them, though - probably why he likes them so much... I plan to experiment with stevia, honey and agave, maybe using half the amount of sugar.

We loved them. I added chopped dried fruit, by SunMaid, including raisins, dates, apricots, and apples, which was a great addition. 

My only reason for dropping a start is that the baking time was difficult to gauge. I literally baked for about 25 mins each pan. I wonder if I slipped a tad on the baking soda....

disappointing that the cookies spread, i even refrigerated them for a few hours, i had them in for almost 20 minutes too on a normal cookie sheet and pan. after cutting them up after cooling they tasted pretty good and chewy!

These were very good and simple to make!  I reduced the recipe down to 8 servings, and ended up getting almost 20 cookies.  It was the perfect amount for my little family.

This is like the best oatmeal cookie recipe evvvvaaar!                         

I am ruined for other recipes. I added two teaspoons of vanilla and a dash of salt though not needed. Finish with cookie icing and YUM! I'll be making them for all of my friends. 5 stars! kudos!!!

Is this really 3 CUPS of butter (6 sticks) or is it 1 1/2 cups -- 3 sticks.  I read a review that said too much butter and want to be sure before I made them.  THANKS!

My husband considers himself a "connoisseur" of oatmeal cookies and he couldn't stop raving about how great these cookies were.  I added 3/4 cup of raisins and cut the recipe in half.  Wonderfully chewy, great flavour - best oatmeal cookie ever!

These are INCREDIBLE! Best cookies I have ever tasted! I must have gained a whole pant size just for these guys because I can't get enough!  Especially good with chocolate chips or apple sauce on top. If you're looking for a recipe for the greatest cookie, viola! You've found it.

Loved these cookies, I used a #24 cookie scoop and I got well over 50 LARGE cookies. The only problem that I had, that no one else mentioned, was my cookies stuck to the foil. I used parchment paper on the next batch and they came right off. I also only put 6 on the baking sheet, after my first 12 ran together and I got square cookies. They were picture perfect, and TASTED even better.

The one thing I changed with this recipe was instead of rolling the cookie in white sugar I used the brown raw sugar. I just like the size of the grains and it looked really good after baking. Other that this I love this cookie and I used the one suggestion to press down the cookie with my hand instead of a glass. Great recipe and yummy cookie. I will make these over and over again.

Way too much butter...they spread way out and blended into one big cookie on the sheet.  Also, in addition to the eggs that another review mentioned, this recipe needs salt badly!  I'd say, cut the butter to 2 sticks,  add a tsp or salt, and an egg, and you;ll have a decent cookie.

I made these cookies a few days ago and I knew as I was making them that something was wrong. The first batch was completely flat and greasy. First, the recipe calls for too much butter. I only used 2 sticks. Second, it needs eggs! After fixing the butter and adding 2 eggs, some cinnamon and a little vanilla, it was perfect. I also omit the white sugar completely. Hope this helps everyone. :)

EXCELLENT! I followed the recipe and instructions exactly as written!  The perfect chewy oatmeal cookie!  Addicting!  I baked them for 11 minutes at 350.  I think if you cook longer they would get crispy pretty fast.  So good.  Thanks for the recipe!

Made them exactly as the recipe states only I didn't roll the balls in the granulated sugar.  I made 1/2 a recipe and added 1 cup of mixed raisins. Turned out great and chewy!!  Definitely will make again!

What a mess! I needed to make 10 dozen cookies for an event.  These ran all over my air bake cookie sheets and stuck like crazy.  The taste was very yummy but there was no way I could serve these.  I added another cup of flour and they worked better.  I didn't smash them with a cup for fear of making them spread even more than they already had.  With the extra cup of flour they really needed to be rolled in the sugar for the extra sweetness.  I'm still trying to figure out how the rest of you got the original recipe to work!!

These were awesome, only smash lightly, err on the side of under baked and let rest on the pan for a min before removing to rack.
I split it in fourths, added cinnamon and raisins, cinnamon, raisins and walnuts, chocolate chips, and chocolate chips & walnuts for variety. All turned out great! My favorite was the cinnamon raisin walnut. Alltogether great, even without salt, which I questioned initially!

Make these just like they said.  They came out AWESOME.  After tasting the first batch that came out of the oven, I stopped rolling in the sugar.  Didn't change the taste one bit.  HIGHLY recommend these.  Also agree, no need to flatten like other reviews said.

I changed the servings to 12 & started making the recipe. I realized too late that i was 1/4 cup short of oats. I happened to have some brown sugar & maple flavored oatmeal packets, so i added 1 pack to make up for the missing 1/4 cup of oats. The cookies turned out awesome!!! This recipe is a keeper!!! (with that 1  small change, lol)

I used this recipe because I didn't have any eggs on me. The cookie has a decent taste, but they were very flat and didn't want to stay together. Way too much butter. On the positive side, it made a ton of cookies.

I made these cookies and they turned out great.  I even took out an entire cup of sugar and I thought they were sweet enough.  I made half the batch with raisins for my husband and the rest were plain as the recipe called for.  Thanks!  This one's a keeper!

These came out really good!  I think next time I'll cut the butter down a bit just to make them more healthy.  Thanks for a cookie recipe that does not include eggs.  That is a big plus in our house as my son is allergic.

This was just what I was looking for!  A simple oatmeal cookie... I added some vanilla, but otherwise made the recipe as stated.  The reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 was because I made the first batch by rolling and pressing the cookies like the recipe instructs and had to reduce the baking time to 8 minutes, but then made the second batch by just rolling them in balls and placing them on the cookie sheet without pressing and then baking for 10 minutes and I got a much nicer looking cookie.

I tried this today, it's great! Simple and easy. I didn't have enough brown sugar so I subbed white to make up the difference and they were the best I've made,and I've been told not to bake.

My DH said they were not sweet enough but I did leave off the sugar on top. I thought they were more like an oatmeal bisquit than a cookie. But so many people liked these so maybe I am just not used to homemade cookie texture.

I accidently added too much oatmeal and they still turned out delicious! My grandmother can not have a lot of salt, so I appreciate the fact that there is no salt. We will definitely make these again!

These are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had. I made them for Thanksgiving this year and everyone in my family loved them, even after I heard a couple say they don't like oatmeal cookies. It's now December and I'm about to make them for my mother's birthday. Thanks so much for this amazing recipe. : )

This recipes is PURE HEAVEN!
Oatmeal cookies are my husbands favorite, and he LOVED these. They were also a big hit at a get-together I took them to over the weekend.

I had to alter the recipe a little bit, because I live in a very dry, high altitude area. I decreased the flour by 2-3 tablespoons, and sprinkled the dough with a little water before rolling them into balls and baking.  Before adding a sprinkle of water the dough was very dry and crumbly, and wouldn't hold a shape to roll.
I also added (after my initial test batch) dried cranberries and pecan pieces to half and the other half got walnut pieces and raisins.  

This recipe makes alot, so I can make it up and keep it in the fridge to bake as I need them. I've already made 2 batches since I found the recipe last weekend. 
:-)

I was a little doubtful because the dough seemed dry and brittle. I shaped the balls and followed the recipe. Wow, my family loved the taste of these delicious treats. So easy to make with great results. Next time, I might try them without rolling in sugar, it should taste just as great. Like a butter cookie with oats. Yummy.
