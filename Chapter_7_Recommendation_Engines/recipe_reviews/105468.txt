I've just made this lemon meringue pie today and all who ate were satisfied! However, there were a few adjustments I had to make. The temperature was WAY too high at 450 degress fahrebheit (230 celsius) and the outside of the meringue went crispy too early while the inside was raw so I turned down the heat a bit and left the lemon meringue pie on for longer so that it was cooked inside and out. Also, I found the meringue a bit tasteless and I noted to add more Splenda for future baking!
This meringue pie was tasty especially the lemon filling, and didn't affect my blood sugars.
Without my adjustments I don't think that it deserved quite the four stars though.
