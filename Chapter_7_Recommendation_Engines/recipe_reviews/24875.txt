My wife loved it!  Quick and easy.  No buttermilk here so combined 1 tablespoon of white vinegar to 1 cup of milk and 5 minutes later, presto buttermilk.

Very good dressing! I halved all the ingredients- I didn't need  a lot. You can't get much easier! I'll try fat free mayo next time to try to make it a little healthier. Thanks, L.R.!!!

Buy a nice blue cheese (doesn't have to be the most expensive), follow the recipe, and this dressing is terrific! I used my immersion blender but reserved a handful of crumbled blue cheese to throw in after so that it's nice and chunky. It will be even better tomorrow, and the next day. Makes a lot!

Recpies are a good start.. I just took mayo and added half and half, instead of buttermilk..   added a bit of sea salt..   I like it chunky so I just wisked it in and mashed it up a bit.  Good stuff gets better after an hour or so in the fridge.  Freeze  the rest of that Roquefort cheese, it's $$$  but worth it.  No need to realy measure, just eyeball it.

I used 5oz cheese instead of 8, 3T Worcestshire instead of 2 and added 1/2c sour cream. It is now my favorite dressing ever. Thanks for sharing!

Good flavor and super easy, but very thin. It seemed to get thinner every time we used it over the next few days. I would like to try it again, but not sure how to make it thicker.

Delicious!!  I made some homemade butter and was wondering what to do with the buttermilk.  I ended up using Gorgonzola cheese and it was super good.  Thanks for sharing.  A definite keeper!

This was such an easy recipe and tasted just as wonderful as some of the high end restaurants.  My store did not carry Roquefort so I just used a wedge of blue cheese and did not puree to be totally smooth and left it a bit chunky.  Will definitely 1/2 the recipe next time as it makes quite a bit.  I have been eating wedges like crazy :)

Just OK. I cut recipe in half. I will look for a recipe with more body. This was just too thin.

Very good dressing.  Not think and chunky if that is what you are looking for.  Much more like the kind of dressing they used to have at steak houses in the past.  I tripled the amount of Worcestershire sauce because I REALLY like the taste.  Turned out perfect.

This is a very good dressing base. I use  10 oz. blue cheese  (only because the blue cheese at Aldi comes in 5 oz. containers) and Kraft Olive Oil mayo with cracked peppercorns, a little less than is called for. It could probably be adapted in many ways.
