Needed to make it a healthy option for me, so I made it without the cheese topping and nuts.  Just followed direction #1 and omitted the oil and did add sea salt to the rub.  Chicken was juicy, tasty, and will definitely be adding this to our weekly menu.  Roasted in the same oven for same amount of time: squash, zucchini, and mushrooms sprinkled with garlic powder, sea salt, and fresh pepper...so delicious!

I've made it just as is and twice afterwards but added cannellini beans to the escarole.A bit of crisp bacon crumbles to top it off and a side of marinated cherry tomatoes...very nice.

I used Belgian endive, and I'm not sure whether that's different than the curly endive. The flavors didn't seem to blend together all that well. Maybe the Belgian endive is why?

I made the escarole as a vegetable  without the chicken and it was excellent.
