I found this recipe to be quite a disapointment. The cooking instructions were inaccurate and the bare taste was blande, and not sweet enough. I would not recommend ANYONE to try this recipe!

These cookies are definetly not the "Best Ever Sugar Cookies". However, with a few minor adjustments, they can be quite yummy!  Instead of Sour Cream , we used vanilla yogurt.  We used less flour, and more sugar, and added icing decorations on top of them.  These simple substitutions made these cookies more enjoyable then the original recipe. - D&H

My daughter is allergic to egg.  We have a crisp, shortbread-like sugar cookie recipe that is egg-free, and this recipe gives us a tender sugar cookie recipe too.  You can change this up by skipping the nutmeg and subbing a tsp. of vanilla, or by putting a little fresh lemon zest in.    I looked at the other reviews, and altered the recipe with 2 Tbsp. more of sugar and about 3 Tbsp. more sour cream.  The dough is delicious, the cookies are tender.    Rolled them out to 1/4 inch thickness, as 1/2 inch seemed way too thick.  Baked about 10 minutes, then cooled on the sheet for a few minutes before transferring to the cooling rack.

I thought this was a great recipe!  Although, I have to admit, I did some tweeking after reading the other reviews.  I added an additional 1/8 -1/4 cup of sugar along with a teaspoon or so of vanilla extract to the dough. The end result were, honest to God, the Best Ever Sugar Cookies!  Even my husband, who doesn't have much of a sweet tooth, loved them!  They're great plain or with frosting. maybe next time I'll roll balls of dough into a cinnamon and sugar mixture for a variation on the Snickerdoodle.

I liked this recipe because it was easy to make and also very tasty too!  I can tell you kids do like it for I am only 12 years (gr.7) old my self.  I know that some kids say they like it when they realy don't.  That is why I gave this recipe five stars!  
     If you were wondering how I found this website it is because in famlay studys I am doing a cook book.  I was looking for recipes on the internet!
        Hope to see you soon!  Your friend

I made these today for Christmas cookie cutouts. I used very small cutters and they worked great!  AND very tasty.  I haven't had very good luck with cutouts in the past in the flavor department.  These are wonderful!  I used powdered sugar instead of flour for rolling them out.

Wow. Well, I didn't chill the dough because it was already too dry. I added a tad of apple sauce to make it pliable. Also, added pecans and vanilla extract to add flavor. Still... tasted terrible. I wish I could give this a good review, but even with the tweaking, I did not care for it.

Made these cookies the other day and only thing I changed was the addition of some vanilla extract! Next time am going to add some butter flavor too for a melt in your mouth butter cookie flavor. These had a great texture, were a little chewy and couldn't get enough! Tip for rolling out: Take two sheets of waxed paper greased and roll with pin til flat and put in freezer for 10 minutes. When removing wax paper, add some powdered sugar so it doesn't stick, flip over, do to other side and cut out! SOOOOOOO much easier! and repeat with cutout left over =)

These are my favorite sugar cookies by far. I added cinnamon (1/2 teaspoon) and a bit of milk, and they turned out very well. they're fluffy and flavorful.

These are great! We did add almond extract and powdered sugar to the cookie dough. The frosting is good but really sweet. We used almond extract in the frosting also.

Sadly, these are not the best ever sugar cookies. I followed the suggestions of several reviewers and modified the recipe. I increased the sugar & sour cream by 1/4 cup added a 1/2 tsp of vanilla. I attempted to roll the dough out to 1/4 inch, as well. Unfortunately the dough kept sticking to my rolling pin & cookie cutter---even when using lots of flour and powdered sugar.  I finally gave up and spooned the dough onto the cookie sheet and flattened them with my powder-sugared fingertips. I also increased the baking time by 5 minutes after my first batch seemed too pale.
Second batch still came out pale. 
The cookies were chewy. I prefer crispy sugar cookies. They were only mildly sweet;  even with the increased sugar and the extra powdered sugar I used in my attempt to roll out the dough and cut it into shapes.

I don’t believe sugar cookies need to be diabetic inducing sweet. This recipe was refreshing on being sweet enough while being easy to make personal adjustments without compromising the results of having soft and tasty cookies. A person needs to remember that not everyone likes the same level of sweetness. I didn’t change this recipe much except for using coconut sugar to substitute some of the white sugar. Wonderful recipe.

These were amazing!! We added sugar to the flour on the counter before rolling out the dough then we sprinkled a little sugar on top of the cookies before baking them. The nutmeg gives them a really nice flavor. Thank you for sharing your recipe it is now in my favorites.

Two of my grandsons are allergic to egg.  The cookies are delicious and loved by all. I roll out to 1/4",and frost with store bought 'Cookie Icing'. This has become a favorite of family & friends, and I have made them for all family events. The nutmeg reminds of my grandmother's sugar cookies.  Yummy!

I made these cookies last Christmas for the St Jude fundraiser. They were a huge hit, and sold out in a very short time. They were  delicious and easy to decorate and transport.

Based on other reviews I did add an extra 1/4 cup of sugar and they certainly were the best sugar cookies ever. For a chewier cookie I reduced the amount of flour for the second batch.
