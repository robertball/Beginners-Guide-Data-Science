Perfect! The only thing I changed was substituting unsalted sunflower kernels for the pine nuts. A cup of pine nuts was over 12 bucks at the grocery.  The same amount of sunflower seeds was 1.40...

Scaled down the recipe for a trial run before Thanksgiving.  Came out great! I'm not a fan of sage or poultry seasoning, so I used a bit of oregano instead.  Had a great flavor.  Left out the pine nuts, but will consider adding them in next time.  Was a bit on the salty side, so for Thanksgiving, I'll use low-sodium chicken broth and not add any additional salt.  Can't wait for the family to taste it!

My sister was going to make Stove Top stuffing for Thanksgiving and even though I don't usually care for it, I really didn't want that. Did a quick search and decided to try this. OMG! Really good! But not a quick dish. So I adjusted some things a bit. I cooked the sausage & thick cut, peppered bacon and the onion & celery all the night before. Stored it all in a container refridgerated overnight.  The next day added the rest of the ingredients as recipe dictates. I did consider omitting the pine nuts due to the expense however they are totally worth it. A bit soggy but I should've used the entire french bagette instead of worrying about following the measurements to the letter. I added Oregano, white pepper & garlic salt along with the spices as listed. Not sure it needed all the butter on top. Lots of left over so it can be served as a good breakfast dish with an egg over easy on top. I will make this again.

This is probably the best stuffing I've ever had.  This completely out-classed everything else on the dinner table this Christmas.  The only change I made, saving time for myself, was to use a bag of cornbread stuffing w/out seasoning in place of crumbled cornbread.  It was so good I was handing out the recipe like it was lottery tickets.  awesome.

I used sun flower seeds instead of pine nuts as another review suggested and I couldnt stomach it at all. The flavors were perfect but that random crunchy texture (I usually love all things crunchy) was unpleasant. I will omit any kind of nuts next time. It tasted great otherwise, I cooked it in our turkey not in a dish also

This was the hit of our Thanksgiving dinner. I used Pepperidge Farms cornbread stuffing instead of making my own cornbread. Next year I'll use real cornbread. Other than that, I followed the recipe. It is definitely time consuming so next time I'll start prep two days ahead.  Well worth the time!

Sorry to leave a poor review. This was far to spicy and greasy for us. Yes I cut down the spices to 1/3 of the recipe and drained the sausage.

Stuffing is my favorite dish at thanksgiving and I wanted a recipe that would blow people away...and I found it with this one! I made some variations for my taste - (I omitted nuts, I didn't use poultry seasoning -but oregano and thyme instead. I just used parmesean cheese -about 2.5 cups. I cooked it in the crockpot with about 1.5 cups of chicken broth for approx 2-3 hrs on low). I have made this twice this year and both times, people have raved about it. I will never make another stuffing again!

I have never made home-made stuffing before and after looking up dozens, this one stood out, I made it a few months before Thanksgiving to "test" it out and it was a fantastic hit! I'll be making it for Thanksgiving. Thank you for sharing!!

I baked a loaf of french bread in my machine two days before Thanksgiving, I also made a pan of corn bread. I cubed both in large cubes, sat out for two nights to get stale. The night before Thanksgiving I pre cooked. I browned the sausage, ( one package of sweet) and drained, then browned the bacon, ( half of a pack) and drained, saut√©ed the two onions then added the 7 stalks of celery, and 4 cloves of garlic, then re added the cooked bacon and sausage to combine flavors until veggies were very soft. Refrigerated over night. In the morning mix 4 cups of water w/ 2 packets of chicken bouillon and 2 packets of saxon, boil and add meat.Then mix breads w/ meats, veggies, and 4 cups of mozzarella.

It tastes great. I took out the pine nuts and added a pound of ground beef, green and red bell  peppers, mushrooms, and regular bacon. Also used beef broth instead of chicken  cause someone that's coming is allergic to poultry.

Awesome taste.  I may never make a different stuffing again.  I followed the exact recipe, however, I should have cooked it a bit longer but would still give it 5 stars.

After reading as many reviews as possible, I made the following changes: No nuts (kids are not nut fans), 4 oz of pancetta, 3 stalks of celery, sage breakfast sausage.  I also made cornbread (JIF) 2 days ahead of time and used pre-made unseasoned stuffing rather than the french bread (found a bag at the deli at my local grocery store).  Came out amayyyyyyyzing.  This dish had the most requests for the recipe and there were no leftovers (I knew it was a hit when the Mother-In-Law asked for it!).  It is a little time consuming and next year I will probably do what a few others have done by cooking the meats along with the celery & onion the night before.  Delish!

Decided to try a new stuffing recipe for this year's Thanksgiving and did a test run (scaled back to half the servings) on this one last night. It is truly the tastiest stuffing I have ever tried. It's also the most time-consuming and expensive, but I think it's worth it. I first made the cornbread from scratch using "Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread Recipe" from this site, then I crumbled it for this recipe. I've never been big on stuffing, but now I think it's because I never had good stuffing before.

I halved this recipe tonight and gave it a try.  This was excellent, and looked nice in the dish, too.  I will make it for company on Thanksgiving.  This is a very interesting dish - flavor was good, texture nice, a great idea overall.  I used "Sweet" Italian sausage.  It was NOT too spicy.

Have been making this recipe for three years now. Never used the pine nuts but followed an other instructions. This last time I only used half the amount of butter which I think worked out better. 

I have made it all at once before serving, have made the meat and celery/onion mix the night prior then finished the next day, and have also made the entire thing the night prior to dinner then rewarmed. 

I've found the best was to prepare everything is the night before. Make the meat and vegetable mixture, let that sit together a few hours and then bake with the bread and spices. Then on the rewarm, I put half the stuffing upside down in another dish so all the  edges end up browned and crisp. The middle was always a little too soggy for my taste so this really perfected it. 

This thanksgiving we had someone who she's not care for stuffing at all, and this recipe converted them. Well worth all the work.

This stuffing is the best!!! My father and I never were fans of stuffing and always talked about how we don't really like it. We are Italian and so when I saw the name I decided to try it and OMG it is good. My father said this is the only stuffing allowed at thanksgiving from now on. Great recipe, thank you!!

Did not care for this recipe at all. The cornbread gave the stuffing a very rough, unpleasant texture. The flavor just didn't appeal to me either. No amount of modifications would salvage this recipe and will not make again.

Made according to recipe.  Spices too much for my southern palate.  Family didn't like it either, rather hated it.  Dogs loved it.

Love this recipe! Never made stuffing in my life! I replaced with crushed walnuts and I only had sage seasoning so I cut down the amount accordingly (think it was half). And I only used 5 cups of broth.   I also prepared/cooked the onions garlic, celery, sausage and pancetta night before.  Then put in sealed glass bowl in fridge over night.  Next day when I was ready I just threw all the stuff together and in the oven it went.  The only thing was all the chopping. Especially the pancetta.  I got it sliced thick and it was a little hard to cut. The other stuff use your chopper!! Lol. Otherwise easy peasy. Thank gang!

This recipe was a hit! I made just half of this recipe, and it still took me a long time to prepare and cook. It was worth it though, it was a delicious addition to our Thanksgiving meal.

This is the stuffing my Mom taught me.  Heritage from southern Italy, I recognize the flavor profile.  All areas have regional differences.  My family does not like sage so we use oregano. Also we are from northeast US so we love roast chestnuts instead of pine nuts.  Lastly, the cheese thing is an American thing.  No cheese in stuffing.  It is safer to bake the stuffing outside the bird.  I actually bake stuffing in muffin tin.  Each guest has their own stuffin muffin.  Great recipe.  Thank you!

Spectacular!!  It immediately became a family favorite.  I substituted bacon for the pancetta .  The only thing I wish I had remembered was to make 1/4 of the recipe without onions so everyone could have enjoyed it.  Other than that BIG HIT!!!

The taste was fantastic but I think I cooked it wrong!  It turned out very soggy and I think I went wrong somewhere with the chicken broth,  maybe not letting it settle long enough or. . .  letting it settle too long?  I don't know,  any advice is appreciated,  the dish tasted fantastic!

Phenomenal! I listened to the reviews and didn't use as much liquid as it called for and the grocery store didn't have any pancetta, so I used bacon instead. I also boiled the giblets from my turkey, chopped them up, and tossed them in there too. Yummy yummy! This is the first time in 17 years my husband has liked stuffing!

I literally made an account solely to review this stuffing, as I‚Äôve made it now for 5 years (Christmas and thanksgiving). Everyone in my family loves it and insists I bring it every year. The only thing I change (after a few years of trial and error) is using half spicy sausage and half sweet Italian sausage, I don‚Äôt use pine nuts or any nuts at all, and I also don‚Äôt use as much celery as they call for (probably about half as much). I‚Äôm not sure where the ‚Äútoo spicy‚Äù comments are coming from or the ‚Äútoo greasy‚Äù comments either, there‚Äôs literally nothing spicy in it unless you make it the way I described with half spicy sausage. It‚Äôs also great to do the sausage/pancetta/onion/celery/garlic mixture the night before to save some time.

This was incredible. Supreme. Deluxe. I made a few changes but I think you just can't miss. I used only 1 lb of sausage, and biscuits instead of French bread. Ended up with 10 cups of bread cubes and used a little more broth to compensate. Actual comments from guests..."this might be the best thing I have ever put in my mouth" "next level stuffing" and mom said "congratulations now you make stuffing every Christmas" .

Hands down best stuffing.  Everyone at the table agreed, even though my mom brought our family‚Äôs favorite stuffing too!  I followed almost to a T. Only difference was instead of pancetta,  just used some bacon fat I had to saut√© the onions.

This was a Thanksgiving hit! I used mild bulk Italian sausage from Earth Fare. I was concerned from other reviews it would be too spicy.  It wasn't. I made the sausage, pancetta and the vegetables the night before , combined and refrigerated over night.  I left the french bread & cornbread, diced and crumbled, out on the counter for 24 hours. I will say, this recipe made A LOT. I did not have a bowl big enough to combine everything,  so i used an extra large zip lock bag and was able to mix everything up very well.  I also did not have a deep sided 9x13. I had enough to fill a normal sided 9x13 as well as an 8x8. Everyone loved It! Even my mother who doesn't like sausage (I didn't tell her it was in there and she loved it ??). Was very easy day of. I will definitely make again.

Followed the recipe except omitted the bacon and the pine nuts.  Absolutely great!  It was the hit of my Christmas dinner for my Italian family.  This will now be the only dressing I serve.

Excellent! I just made a couple of changes after a trial run for Thanksgiving.

To make things a bit easier (and cheaper) I used regular bacon instead of pancetta, bagged stuffing instead of fresh bread and slivered almonds instead of pinenuts.

*I usually like pinenuts, but we really preferred the slivered almonds-better crunch and texture. I definitely recommend that substitution if you want to change up this recipe a bit.

I added more floor and less milk, and it still came out a bit sloppy. Hard to roll up too.  And took quite a bit to make.  I will see how these freeze, might be okay for a holiday party.

I made it in Brazil for christmas (Yes, turkey is traditional on christmas here) and since we do not have all the the ingredients here in Brazil I had to adapt some of the ingredients. Even so it was great, very easy to make and delicious. My family loved it.

I halved this, didn't use the pancetta or sub for it, topped with 1T butter instead of 2, which would be the correct amount halving.  Oh, only half pound of mild Italian sausage.  I liked this.  'I baked in a casserole dish rather than an oblong or square dish & mine was too wet from covering; good, but soupy & didn't firm up even after baking uncovered.  My fault.   First time having sausage in dressing.  'Liked it, but probably won't do it again - the sausage part.  Thanks for sharing your recipe,, Briana!

This is a hit every time I make it.  The last time, my girlfriend told me not to let my feelings get hurt if no one eats it.  They are very picky.  Well, it was a hit there as well.  Everyone raved over it and my dish was the only only one completely gone.  I use regular sausage instead of Italian sausage and I do not use the pine nuts

The first time I made this there was way too much going on. It had  potential so this is what I did. I used breakfast sausage instead of the Italian sausage, 3-4oz of pancetta not the 6oz it called for. 3-4 celery stalks not 7, 2lg garlic cloves not 4, I added 2lg shredded carrots, got rid of the pine nuts altogether, substituted 1 cup of broth for one cup of milk. The milk is an Minnesota trick my mom use to use. Now I love this stuffing, its not so overwhelming and I believe stuffing should be a side dish not the main dish. I made this about 3-5 years ago after it won the best stuffing award on one of the morning shows. I think it was good morning America. I have tweaked it ever since and came up with recipe.

A unique twist to dressing which was well received.  I am glad I invested in the pine nuts -- toasty and delicious with the French bread and sausage.  I doubled the recipe for 24 people and had plenty to send home with guests.  Thanks for the excellent recipe.  Many compliments from guests.

I was so looking forward to making this, but for some reason I just didn't like it, and nobody wanted seconds.  For me it was the texture, it was chewy and tough and the pine nuts made it nutty.  I made it exactly per the directions, except that I down-scaled it a bit, so maybe I did something wrong with the proportions.  Anyway, sorry to say it wasn't a hit at my house like I thought it would be.
