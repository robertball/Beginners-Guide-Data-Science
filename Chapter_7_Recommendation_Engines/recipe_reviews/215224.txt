These had to be the BEST chicken tacos I've ever had.  The only thing I did different was to use boneless breasts, because it's what I had on hand.  The flavor blend in these were spot on, with just the perfect little kick.  My family absolutely loved them.  I will never make another chicken taco recipe again!

This was absolutely outstanding!  Moist, flavorful delicious shredded chicken for soft tacos.  I adapted this recipe for the slow cooker by placing 1 1/2 lb boneless frozen breasts in the slow cooker with cumin, adobo, taco seasing and a cup of Goya tomato/chicken boullion, cooked seven hours, removed the chicken and drained the juices through a seive, then added the shredded chicken, recipe ingredients, and some strained broth back in the slow cooker.  I added a can of chopped green chilis too.  A definite do-over!  Thanks, Goya.

OH SO GOOD!!!  I made these just as written, except I didn't have ancho chili powder.  I used regular chili powder instead.  I also went a easy on the cumin.  I put in about 1/2 - 3/4tsp.  AND, you really don't need to use goya brand products...  I used mostly store brand.  Came out great!

really good!!  i usually buy those rotissere chickens and take the chicken off the bone and freeze it...so i used that and it saved me A LOT of time!  I used half the amount of chili powder and it was really spicy...so just be careful with that.  I warmed the tortillas on the stove with a little butter and put everything on it lettuce, tomatoes, avocado, sour cream and cilantro and my husband loved it!!! except for it being a little spicy, but i love spicy!!

This was amazing. I Made as is but cooked everything together in the crockpot on low for about 6 hours. Just poured in the spices which were store brand not adobo and the sauce and 4 large boneless skinless chicken breast. I shredded and added a little hot sauce to taste at the end. I served these on keiser rolls with rice on the side! Can not wait to make again!

Oh Yes. Better than authentic shredded beef tacos and way better than any other chicken taco I have ever tasted.   I went under on all spice measurements as my family is sensitive to spicy food. Added more as needed. The COMBO of spices is wonderful. My family and I are so grateful this recipe was shared online.  It tastes so good and is healthy! Can't beat THAT.

As is, this was a three, at best ... it just tasted like tomato sauce on chicken! But, after tasting, I added some additional spices (more ancho, garlic powder, onion powder, more orgegano, tumeric) as well as some salsa verde, and it came together nicely ... it was a five-star, then, and I'll definitely make again, but definitely check the seasonings after the chicken has cooked in the sauce for about 10 minutes ... I cannot imagine anyone not wanting to do some major tweaking on this basic recipe!

I used boneless skinless chicken breasts and regular chili powder.  I used flour tortillas since that is what I had but I would have preferred corn.  It has a nice flavor with just enough heat to it.

So good, I couldn't find the Adobo so just used a teaspoon of taco seasonings, also added the juice of one lime, small can of Rotel tomatoes with green chilis, half a red onion sliced and brown sugar instead of white.  Cooked in the crockpot on low 4 hrs, so good!  Tacos first night and burritos with grilled peppers and zucchini second night.... Will definitely make again!

This was a delicious meal. We didn't know what Adobo was and left it out, but we'll figure it out one of the next times we make it. This recipe is now a family favorite.

Sorry Goya, but I didn't have any of your products. The mixture of flavors was fantastic using the brands I had on hand. For the chicken, I used left over rotisserie chicken. I made the sauce and let it simmer for a while then added the shredded chicken and let it simmer until it cooked down. Garnished with our favorite taco toppings and served with refried beans. Excellent and easy meal~much better than the "taco seasoning packet" from the store which I was wanting to avoid!

Used the suggestion of cooking this with frozen chicken breasts and a sliced onion in the crockpot.  Put it on before I went to work and when I got home it was fabulous! I just had to shred it up!

This recipe gets 5 stars simply because my 5 year old son who is the pickiest eater in the world, LOVED it!  He inhaled two tacos and then asked for a third.  My kids had sauce all over their hands and faces and kept saying, "Yum, Mom this is the best!"  I will be making this again and again!

Oh, I just used what I had on hand.  I didn't have white vinegar so I used apple cidar vinager.  I didn't have olive oil, so I used crisco.  I used thighs instead of breasts, and seasoning salt in place of adobo and it still turned out excellent!

Everything is fairly nice about this recipe. I added more Ancho and Cumin to taste as well as a touch of Cayenne because I always crave heat.   A keeper for sure.

These were a big hit. I doubled the recipe. I used fresh garlic and maybe went a little heavier on the spices, didn't use all Goya brands, but that was it. Served with corn and flour tortillas and all the toppings. I will definitely keep this one!

Delicious! These were so easy to make and perfect for a quick meal. Like others, I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts. Since I didn't have corn tortillas I opted to use flour tortillas for a wrap and added some shredded cheese, diced tomato, and lettuce with some sour cream on the side. I served this with Spanish rice - YUM!

This was very good and simple to throw in a slow cooker. I didn't use Goya products because I don't have any...but I keep all these things on hand, so this was a great pantry meal for us.

Sooo tasty.  Nice blend of spice, and mild heat. Opted out of garnish shown in this recipe, and served with either Wasabi Guacamole or Dave’s Coleslaw as optional toppings (both are AR recipes) - - they were delish. Added to the Make Again-Yummy folder.

LOVED this recipe!  Our market didn't have the Goya products.  I substituted Hot Mexican Chili Powder for the ancho chile powder and wasn't able to find Adobo with pepper---it was still delicious.  We warmed the leftover chicken mixture the next morning, layered it on warm tortillas, topped it with over-easy eggs, cheddar cheese, and my husband's homemade salsa---very yummy!!!

I would give this a 5 *but I thought to flavor was was too strong for tacos.  Maybe if the sauce we not so think maybe by adding some chicken broth to it and use as an enchilada sauce.  These were good but the flavor was overpowering.  I used leg quaters as I think dark meat is more moist.

This was delicious and simple.  I doubled the recipe and used whatever brands I had on hand or were on sale.  Some of my family used corn tortillas some used flour.  I chose to put my chicken on top of a huge green salad.  Low carb delicous meal.

My boyfriend said these were the best chicken tacos he'd ever eaten after he tried them, they were great! I couldn't find adobo at the store so I omitted it and they still came out great, I'm excited to try it with the adobo next time!

This was excellent! I didn't have any Goya ingredients or the ancho (which I think makes a big difference, but I didn't have it on hand). So i used 3 t. chili powder and 1/8 t. chipotle powder to add the smokiness that ancho would provide.  I also used just 1 t. of oregano because I had ground, not leaf.  Altogether wonderful! Served in hard corn shells with cheese and guacamole. Our whole family loved it.

I don't cook very often and decided to try this recipe. It was very easy to follow, as there was also a video for this recipe on youtube. It was simply AMAZING. I love the touch of sugar in this recipe. I'm not much of a spice person so I only put in 2 1/2 t of ancho chile powder and 1/2 t of t of cumin. Everything else as followed and only a small dash of adobo was used. Would definitely make this again!

These tacos were fantastic! I changed up the cooking method, but used all of the ingredients called for. First I put 2 frozen chicken breasts in my slow cooker then added the rest of the ingredients. Turned on low and 7 hours later the chicken was fully cooked and ready to shred and mix in with the delicious sauce. We used both corn and flour tortillas- both were great! I even used the leftover chicken for to make an enchilada casserole-yum! Will definitely make this recipe again!

Delicious!  And it's super easy if you use pre-cooked rotisserie chicken meat and then heat it up in the tomato/chili sauce.  Yum yum.

I loved it!  I also used the chicken as enchilada filling, rolled and topped with cheese.  I did not add additional sauce.  Delicious.

This recipe was a good starter but seeing how my family likes some spice I think it needed a little more kick. I used 3 large chicken breasts and put it in the slow cooker for 8 hours on low and it shredded perfectly! But next time I think I will add a can or medium rotel during the cooking process to heat it up a bit!

Yum! I used about 3/4 lb of boneless skinless chicken tenders for the meat in this recipe - it reduced the cooking time quite a bit! I didn't have Adobo seasoning, but when I looked it up it seemed a lot like taco seasoning, so I used the top taco seasoning recipe from this site when it said season to taste (I keep it on hand all the time, it's so good). I did feel like the sauce needed salt, so I added it to my personal preference. All other ingredients, I used what I had on hand, no Goya products. I made corn tortillas with masa harina and my tortilla press and topped the tacos with chopped lettuce and D's Salsa from this site. SO good! I will definitely make this again.

This came out SO yummy! My changes (due to necessity) were- One 14oz can of petite diced tomatoes, rather than 2 cans of sauce; 3 cloves fresh garlic, passed through a garlic press; Italian Herbs rather than oregano; I didn't use anything branded Goya. I cooked according to directions, and they were the tastiest chicken tacos I've ever had. All 4 of my kids loved them, and so did my husband. This is a keeper!

This is a great recipe! I used a whole chicken and cooked everything in the crockpot on low for 4 hours. I also used jalapenos instead of chiles. Then deboned the chicken, added it back to the sauce and let it cook for another 30 minutes in the crockpot. Definitely will make this again!

Pretty good. I used boneless chicken breasts and pretty much halved all of the spices (the amounts seemed to be too much for me) and I used about 1 tsp Adobo in the sauce. The filling was a little salty, but I used shredded lettuce, tomatoes and sour cream as toppings and they helped balance out the saltiness. I used crispy taco shells instead of corn tortillas.

I tried this for the first time tonight, and it was a big hit! I didn't have Goya brand anything, or any Adobo seasoning, so I made some with Traci's Adobo Seasoning recipe and it was great! Be careful about using chili powder or chipotle powder instead of Ancho powder, as they are much hotter.

This recipe was AMAZING!  I altered a few things about it with what I had in the kitchen: -used white wine vinegar instead of distilled -basil instead of oregano -Montreal Steak Spice instead of Adobo, since I couldn't find Adobo at the store  I made it for my boyfriend and our roommate and they ate until they were stuffed!  I'll definitely be making it again!

This was delicious! My local grocery store does not carry Goya products, so I used what I had and since I could not find an Adobo seasoning product I used the one on this site and made my own. Husband raved about these and the 3 and 5 year picky boys I have ate them with no questions or complaints! WINNER!

This recipe was fantastic!!! I have been looking for a good shredded chicken taco recipe for ages... (no more trips to Taco Bell thanks to this recipe!) I used boneless skinless breast and used Pam cooking spray instead of oil.  I also omitted the sugar and used whatever brand products I had on hand (not Goya) and it was fabulous.  I couldn't find adobo seasoning so I used the recipe from this site: Traci's Adobo Seasoning Recipe - Allrecipes.com
and it was delicious! I made extra and have used it to season ground turkey for turkey tacos. I served the shredded chicken with white corn taco shells, lettuce and a shredded Mexican cheese mix. My 8 year old and I  gobbled them up and cant wait to eat them again. This will become a weekly menu item! Thanks to all the user comments- it always helps!!!

This wasn't really that great. I think one of the issues is that you really want your chicken slow-cooked for your tacos and this recipe just doesn't do it. Another problem is that it's very tomato-y, in a way that I wasn't expecting--it's almost Italian in its flavor. Weird. While cooking, I was hoping there would be a transformation in the taste as I simmered the sauce, but I was pretty disappointed in the result. I tried simmering for a longer time, hoping for more caramelization and sampling the whole time, but it never got there.

The final tacos were saved by the other ingredients and salsa I whipped up, but I wouldn't repeat this recipe. I'll definitely try again on chicken tacos, but I don't think this recipe is worth tweaking to make it work out right.

Ingredients list is excellent but

 1)Shredding chicken after cooking for 20 minutes is next to impossible.  Screw cooking in a pan, just combine all ingredients with 2 c water into a pot and slow cook for 3 hours.

2)whoever wrote this is obviously shilling for goya products and has never cooked this recipe before.

I think these are very authentic chicken tacos. These are the type of tacos that people from Mexico make at my job. As I was making them, I remembered they also put chipotles in them, so I added it to the chicken for a little kick. I didn't have adobo seasoning, but I found a recipe on here called Traci's adobo seasoning, and used that. It turned out great.

These were a huge hit.  A bit on the salty side though - no need to add the adobo to the sauce since the chicken is generously seasoned before searing.

This is a definite do-again.  It was easy, fairly quick (I used boneless chicken breasts) and the entire family loved it.  My 9-year old had three tacos and even my extra picky 5-year old finished her taco.  Delicious!!

Tacos were on point--reminded me of the ones I would get at a taco truck.

The sauce absorbed the shredded chicken when I put it back in the pot--only a few more minutes of stirring needed.

Also used boneless skinless breasts as that's what I had in the refrigerator--just as tasty and less work!

Didn't use lettuce/tomato/avacado--just a simple lime, onion and cilantro as garnish--authentic style!

Will definitely be putting this in the recipe box.

Shredded Chicken Tacos Haiku: "I love Goya things. And their recipes don't fail. Gobble, tacos good!" I've made these several times now, both as directed, and once (w/ not nearly as tasty results) w/ boneless, skinless chick breast. The combinations of ingredients is fantastic, and of course, using non Goya products won't affect the flavor all that much, but what I find essential to this recipe is both using the split chick breast, as well as Adobo and cilantro. Ate the chicken tonight piled high on tostadas w/ cheese, tomatoes, lettuce and cilantro and I'm already anxious to make this recipe again.

Made these last night. Easy and delicious. I used Boston lettuce leaves in place of tortillas. This is a great low calorie meal that also fits in with the 17 day diet. I will use leftover chicken in a salad for dinner tonight.

DELISH!!

Was looking for something different to do with chicken that my kids would eat after reading reviews and making sure I had all the ingredients I threw this together. So easy!! I of course did not have the "goya" brand or the adobo but I dont think that mattered much.

My kids *9,4 and 16mths* loved them!They tasted even better today for lunch and I am not a fan of leftovers!

This is a keeper for sure!

Sooo good! Of course I didn't use anything Goya because I don't have any of that name brand. I didn't have ancho chile powder so I used regular chile powder and added some fajita seasoning too. I used left of chicken I had already in the fridge and just shredded ...heated it with oil and added the sauce. My family LOVED it! :)

This is the real mexican deal.  I boil a whole chicken, with all ingredients except tomato sauce.  I shread entire chicken, then add tomato sauce, a little of the broth and let that simmer...  aside from this being a goya commercial, this is authentic as it gets!

Really good!  I only had frozen chicken breasts, so I put them in the crockpot on high for about 5 hours with some chicken broth.  When they were done, I just shredded them and put the shredded chicken in a skillet with all of the other ingredients.  I added some of the broth from the crockpot and simmered everything for about 20 minutes.  My 14 year old picky eater ate two of these, so that gets 5 stars from me.  **Note - these are also great using lettuce leaves instead of tortilla shells - nice crunch and no added calories!

My boyfriend and I made this tonight (with Southwestern Rice on the side, also from this website). It was really easy and it came out pretty good, but we both wished there was more of a kick. We used chili powder instead of ancho chile, thinking it wouldn't make a difference. Next time, we'll see if ancho is spicier, and we'll probably add more adobo (we used about a tsp, unsure of how much to put in). We also used boneless chicken, and that worked just fine.

I wasn't sure about this recipe when I first read the ingredients, but I decided to try it anyway. I'm very happy that I did, because they were absolutely delicious! I did use a few substitutes: boneless/skinless chicken breast, flour tortillas, and regular chile powder. I did use the Adoba, but all of the other spices were store brand. I think they turned out great! I will definitely make these again!

pretty good. I think I must have added to much Cumin because it was very strong. I couldn't find any GOYA products anywhere, but I made due with what I had.

I used boneless skinless chicken thighs. Ensure you drain fat from pan before adding sauce to chicken. When shredding chicken, shred in thick chunks- not thin like pulled pork. I garnished with diced avocado, fresh cilantro, tomatoes and chopped fresh spinach. The fresh lime squeezed on it is nice if you like lime.

We love these in my house. I make them at least once a month.

Update: We are now doing Taco Tuesdays and I make these every other week because it's one of my favorite meals. I usually cook up mushrooms, zucchini, onions, and bell peppers to add to the tacos.

I admit that I was a skeptic at first, but the chicken shredded easily, and it was even good after an extended time on the stove due to my wife getting stuck in traffic.  Other than using boneless chicken breasts I followed the recipe exactly.  Very tasty and not hugely time consuming.

This is a really nice filling for chicken tacos/burritos/nachos. I did not use adobo seasoning because I didn't have it on hand. I used emmerils essence after googling adobo seasoning and discovering the ingredients were very similar.  Also after discovering I had twice as much chicken breast than the recipe called for, I added 2 cups of chicken broth to the tomato sauce mixture and it cooked down nicely and made a rich and flavorful sauce. Also added about a half cup minced onion for flavor. Very tasty. Will definitely put this into my rotation!!

I will definitely be making this again! Best taco  I've eaten yet. However, the recipe didn't make enough sauce to suffice. I had to double it. But it was amazing for a recipe that doesn't need much oil. I'll also be trying to make this with other parts of the chicken and get back to you. Finally a chicken recipe that doesn't taste so "chickeny".

I used half tomato sauce and half chicken broth and this still tasted very strongly of tomato. If you want that, it's fine - but I was hoping for something a little different.

Some of the best chicken tacos I've tried.  My family devoured every last bit of it (not a leftover in sight).  I've been a big fan of Goya for years, and the love affair continues!

We really enjoyed these tacos. I live in Canada and can't get Goya products, I just used the ingredients listed except for the adobo. I made it in the crockpot, I chopped 1/2 an onion and put that on the bottom, I removed the chicken skin then place the chicken on the onion, mixed the sauce ingredients together then poured over the chicken. I cooked on low for 6 hours, removed the chicken, deboned the chicken, strained the sauce then added the chicken back in. Didn't find it as spicy as we liked so I added some red pepper flakes and a squirt of lime juice.

I have been meaning to share this since I made it two weeks ago. This receipe was so good and worked out great for left overs as well. The receipe does call for all Goya seasonings since it is a Goya receipe; however, I did not have the Goy
a brand so I used the brands I already had of course.
 I also used boneless thin sliced chicken breast instead which worked out great. The chicken was so easy to shred which made me an even more happy camper. We could not find Adobo with pepper seasoning so we just used the basic Adobo seasoning. I love spice to my foods so I am sure if we'd had the Adobo with pepper it would have been even better.

These are the absolute best chicken tacos I have ever eaten. My husband, children, and grandchildren gobbled them up. I doubled the recipe and should have tripled it. The only thing I did differently was I did not add any oregano and went a little lighter on the chile powder. I used Goya Adobo but the other ingredients were not Goya.

I used just the chicken for enchiladas, and they were a big hit! Just added some diced green chiles, cheese, & enchilada sauce to the top, along with more cheese. Baked 350 for 20 mins or so, and they were delicious! You could use just the chicken portion for a lot of Mexican dishes. Yum!

This recipe was really tasty!! The 2 lbs of chicken was 2 large bone-in breasts for me (just an FYI in case you're trying to gage the amount you'll need).

I used regular chile powder because we didn't have adobo and it was fine.  I also added some chopped onions and red bell pepper to the pan while browning the chicken to add texture.  I also seasoned the chicken with some garlic and onion powder before browning it.  The finished product was tasty!!! I am not one for leftovers but this was even better the second day.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

Love this recipe!  I haven't used the adobo yet (maybe in the future) it taste great without.  To change it up a bit, I like to make quesadillas with this meat mixture and a Mexican cheese blend.  Delicious!

I use cans of diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce.  These are easy and delicious!

This recipe was so delish! I followed it down to a tee. I maybe added a shake more of cumin. The adobo does make the dish. For those who don't what it is, it's basically just a blend of seasonings in a jar. Similar to a Misses Dash kind of seasoning. Next time I make this I am going to try it with some toastadas. I can't wait!

I love these!  I used skinless, boneless chicken breasts.  I didn't find adobo in my grocery store, but I did use chipotles in adobo.  I put the chipotles in the tomato mixture and used the sauce to coat the chicken.  It was very good.  I served it with many toppings, coleslaw, guacamole, lettuce and a pico di gallo among others.  This will be a standard for Mexican night at my house.

Awesome!  I added spicy red peppers to kick it up a notch. Also, Cole likes these with deep fried corn tortillas.  But the chicken is good in soft tacos and on nachos too!

This turned out really good! Thought it might be too spicy but it was fine for our tastes. Used mostly store brands, since didn't have Goya on hand, and it was great! Glad to find something where we could use chicken on the bone since it's much less expensive.  A definite keeper!

Really tasty chiken tacos! Instead of buying or cooking chicken breast, I just used canned white meat chicken by Tyson. It saved me tons of time, which I tend to often run out of juggling college, work, and a two year old by myself! Oh, I couldn't find "ancho chili powder", but I did find "ancho chili pepper" (powder form) in several brands. I think it's a typo or something.

These were delicious!  I didn't use any of the chili or hot sauce because my husband's allergic.  I also didn't brown the chicken first.  I just cut it into cubes and threw it in with the sauce to simmer a while.  The whole family liked it, even the picky 4 year old.

very good and easy to make. I couldn't find the adobo seasoning so went without & I didn't feel anything was missing. Excellent flavor, restaurant quality. Everyone raved about them except my husband who doesn't like tomato-based stuff.

This was a huge hit with my family. I made the recipe more or less as is, maybe a smidge less chile powder  and my spicy-averse teens had no issue with the heat level. SO flavorful and much better than any chicken taco meat I've made before. My only comment is to not use really thick chicken breasts, which I did since it was on hand. It didn't shred very easy. The only chicken tacos I'll ever make again will be these.

Family loved it and I will definitely be making again. I am not a heavy spice person but my family is and I didn’t think it was too spicy at all.  I was a little concerned reading the reviews that it might be too spicy for me but it was just right for me and the others added hot sauce. I will be making this to take to son in college for his freezer. I can see using this for enchiladas as well.

I have made this several times. I usually use boneless and skinless chicken breasts. The hardest part of this recipient is the shredding, which take no time at all. 

I am making it again tonight but I will use my charcoal BBQ instead of cooking indoors.

This is a great recipe! I only use Goya Adobo. Otherwise it’s all off brand store ingredients. And with a shredded rotisserie, this is even better and easier. I add a little more cumin for good measure. Love this recipe!

I made this exactly as written except I used one 15 oz can of tomato sauce.  I also added additional salt, pepper and more adobo seasoning after the chicken was shredded and simmered for 10 minutes.  This was excellent!   Even my extremely picky husband liked it, got seconds and said make this again.  Winner, winner, chicken dinner!

I made a few changes due to what I had on hand. Nonetheless they were delicious and huge it my house! I used flour tortillas, chicken breasts, (didn’t have tomato sauce) skipped that, (didn’t have onions) I used onion powder which made the recipe a bit salty.. but after rinsing it, the flavor was still there and absolutely delicious. My picky eaters loved this recipe... will definitely be making again!

This was just OK for me.  I used boneless/skinless chicken breasts and pretty much followed the instructions.  I just didn't think this was anything special.

We adapted this for the slow cooker and would highly recommend!  We used four boneless, skinless chicken breasts.  Added all ingredients to a bowl to create a sauce and tossed the sauce and chicken in the slow cooker on low for about 6-7 hrs.  We did not use the lime or cilantro and used chipotle chili powder because I couldn’t find ancho chili powder. So good!

I used this recipe as a jumping off point using the spices and general directions in my own way.  First, I'll put it out there, I  did not use Goya anything. I'm a store-brand kinda cook. 

I mixed all the spices as directed then browned boneless chicken breasts (it was what I had) as directed. This is where I diverged. I added store-brand Rotel-type tomato and jalepeno to the pan along with the vinegar and I simmered for about 45 minutes which reduced the liquid significantly. I removed the chicken, let it cool about 15 minutes and shredded it. I added it back to the pan and the simmered another 15 minutes. My husband, who is a better cook than I by far, really liked it and asked me to remember how I did it so I can do it again.

Easily a five star rating. My wife wants to eat them for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The only changes I made were of necessity. I could not find the ancho chili powder so I just used chili powder. The optional adobo with pepper spice was also not available so I did not use it. I used the recommended garnishes (diced onions and cilantro) and some store-made guacamole (too lazy to make it). One of the best chicken tacos I've had in a long time!

I've been known for making great tex-mex beef tacos, but decided to make this as well to mix up the selection for a party. 


It blew my beef tacos out of the water and they went untouched because the chicken was so good.


This recipe was easy to make and hard to screw up! 


Modifications:
I did not use any of the "goya" products as suggested by the recipe and instead substituted in fresh ingredients wherever possible. 

I added about 1oz of tomato paste to enrich the flavor.

Instead of hot-sauce I added a minced jalepeno and a pinch of cayenne pepper.

Insanely delicious. Didn't change a thing except for adding a couple dashes of Chipotle Tabasco instead of a adobo because we didn't have adobo.

The sauce is so good, I could eat it as soup. This is a great recipe. The meat mixture could also be used for taco salad, or any Mexican dish. Loved it.

The flavor was fine, but I live in the Southwest where Mexican and Southwestern food abound.  I did dial up the spices but I think the tomato sauce base is not interesting enough  to my taste.

I turned the recipe into burritos!  Just switched the lettuce and tomato for Spanish rice and black beans.  Added cheese.  Toasted the burrito just like Taco Bell except I just used a frying pan!  The kids loved them!

This receipe was delicious and easy to make. I threw some chicken breast in the slow cooker for a few hours and then followed the recipe exactly. We usually have at least one picky eater out of  my family of 9 and no one complained this time. Definitely adding it to our favorites!

Super yummy!! Our whole family loves these, adults and all ages of kids. Delicious (maybe even better) the next day. This is my first time using adobo (Goya) ever and now I have been using it on so many other things, too!

OH MY WORD!! I am not an experienced chef and tacos are not my number 1 choice of food. But those chicken tacos were absolutely amazing. I followed the instructions even though I was tempted to use my pressurized cooker because chicken is so easy to shred when I use that thing. But I didn't and I am happy I didn't. I spend a good amount of money of the ingredients because I had very little on them, but now that I do, I am making them again tonight and I only spent about $12. And I will be able to make enough for days this time. Don't question the ingredients. I did, without warrant lol. Also, when cooking the chicken mix smells kinda strong, almost unappetizing. But it's worth it. I also recommend a different type or tortilla Mia Rancho Mamas Flour Tortillas they are to die for. So happy I found this recipe and website. For now I am stuck on this hopefully it won't be long till I try something new

This does take a long time to make, however my kids and I LOVE this!. We eat a lot at small, family run Mexican spots and this rivals the real thing. Hi highly recommend. :)

Tasted like chicken with tomato sauce on it.  Followed the recipe exactly.  I didn't like it.  Kids hated it.  I wouldn't recommend this at all.  I'm not sure how it's rated so well.

This is a great recipe! Tons of flavor and such tender chicken. I used the Traci's Adobe Seasoning recipe from Allrecipes because I didn't have that seasoning on hand. It was great.

Wow!  This was great!  In terms of spices i didn't change a thing except I didn't have ancho chili powder so I used regular and I cut that back because the crowd I was cooking it for doesn't like things spicy.  I also cooked boneless breasts in the slow cooker and couldnt believe how juicey it was.  Everyone raved about the flavors.  Definitely will make this again.

This recipe is amazing!I didn't have tomato sauce, so I used canned diced tomatoes instead.  I recommend that substitution to anyone  who feels that tomato sauce overwhelms the dish. I also didn't have white vinegar, so I used apple cider vinegar, and that was very good. (In my opinion, the vinegar makes this dish.) Everyone in my family raved about it and asked for more. And best of all, it's inexpensive and somewhat healthy!

These were the most juicy, flavor-filled chicken tacos I have ever tasted. Definitely restaraunt quality. I stuck to the ingredients, minus the adobe and I used boneless skinless chicken breast. I also chopped half an onion, and one green bell pepper and added that to the mix. Rather than follow the cooking instructions, I browned my chicken in my pressure cooker for about 5 minutes, threw in the rest of the ingredients, and cooked for 15 minutes. Shredded it, served it, and I had a happy family. Great recipe!!

I didn't have all the ingredients handy,  so instead of adobo seasoning, chili powder, or oregano, I added: smoked paprika, a bit of cinnamon, Italian seasoning, and crushed red pepper to the tomato mixture along with the garlic, cumin, sugar and vinegar. The chicken (I had skinless, boneless tenderloins) i seasoned with the above substitutions, plus garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper.  Aside from that, I followed the recipe and served them in whole wheat tortillas with shredded cheese, sour cream, and shredded lettuce, plus some chipotle hot sauce I had. They turned out awesome, the boyfriend loved them. Will definitely make again!

I made this recipe with ingredients I already had at home and boneless, skinless chicken breast for a multi-family gathering.  Superlatives used were awesome! Outstanding!!!  Several members asked for the recipe.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

Just amazing! I used a small crockpot and halved the recipe using four boneless chicken breasts and the only ingredient I used differently was chili powder instead of the other pepper. Baked in low as suggested, for six hours. Yummy!

My family loved it! I couldn't find "Goya" in my market so I had to make some substitutions. I also used a whole chicken that the butcher cut up for me. I think the addition of the dark meat was a great idea.

This was fantastic, my whole family loved it!  My husband said they were the best tacos he has ever had.  I made the recipe exactly as listed and won't be changing anything next time around.  The Ancho Chili Powder is key - don't substitute regular chili powder as it has a completely different flavor.

This is a winner! Made it for the guys, but they had already eaten before they came over. Then they took one bite of the chicken and made themselves multiple tacos. I'm currently making them again as I write this! Very delicious. Thanks!

This recipe is absolutely delicious. I don't have anything goya and use seasoning salt in the place of Adoba. I also use regular boneless chicken breasts and it comes out fantastic every time. From dinner parties, to nights at home...this recipe is a winner!

Incredibly easy. I made as directed and it was perfect. My 11year old son loved it as did my company. Very versatile. Will definately make this again. Of course, I didn't use all goya products but I keep their adobo on hand at all times! =)

Fantastic!  I made the meat for tostadas which turned out great. I browned boneless skinless chicken breasts, then threw everything into a crockpot. As soon as the chicken was tender enough, I shredded it then returned it to the crockpot.  I think slow cooking the shredded chicken all day helped blend all of the ingredients making it very flavorful.

Definitely a keeper.  Didn't use the goya brands, or adobo and only had boneless chicken.  For that reason, the simmering and carmelizing times can be reduced.  I also substituted regular chili powder for the ancho.  Amazing flavor!  Will make again and will try to get adobo and ancho!  Shredded the chicken in our Vitamix and it had a great texture!

My grocer didn't carry skin-on, bone-in chicken breasts. So I used boneless, skinless and they turned out fine. I scooped out the chili seeds, so they were mildly spicy. If you like a really authentic and spicy flavor, leave in the seeds. Served with ice-cold cerveza...it makes a nice lunch or dinner.

These were really good.  I made them for a club meeting and they were a hit. The chicken was really flavorful.  We didn't even top with cheese.

I made this for a "whatever" night for myself.  My husband, who doesn't normally like this type of dish, ended up stealing some of it.  I did have to make an alteration because I bought the wrong thing.  I didn't think the tomato puree I did buy would taste right so I used the Rotelle I did have.  I was told to add this to our rotation and to try it with beef.  Love this recipe.

I've made this recipe twice so far and everyone has LOVED it!
I made a couple of changes according to what I had on hand.
I used "Traci's Adobo Seasoning" recipe found on this site and also substituted hatch chili powder instead of ancho.
I used a little over a pound of boneless chicken instead of bone in. Tried it once with breast meat and once with thigh. We preferred the thigh meat only by a little.
I did simmer the chicken in the sauce for a while and spooned out a couple of tablespoons of the sauce to add to some refried beans along with a couple of shakes of adobo seasoning. Family gobbled up the cheap canned refried beans as well!

I think the flavors are fantastic.  I have made this several times and with the leftovers I make chicken quesadilla's on the grill.  Always a hit at my house.  I only stray from the recipe in that I don't use Goya brand ingredients and use my own home made adobo spice from a recipe I found on the web.

Such a great recipe.  I just throw everything in the crock pot with 5 boneless skinless chicken thighs (frozen) and cook on low for 6 hours.  This is our go to shredded chicken taco recipe.

This had a really authentic taste. I just moved from Texas where you could get Mexican street tacos on every corner to Memphis, TN where all the Mexican food is so americanized. So I have really been missing those flavors. I did manage to find some blue corn tortillas at a specialty store & they were amazing with this mix. Like most people, I did not have the goya products nor the adobo but there is a really simple recipe on this site for the adobo mix that is amazing. I believe its called Traci's adobo seasoning. Since its just me & my hubby we had a lot of chicken mixture left over. We warmed it up the next day & made the most awesome nachos ever with it.

This was super easy and everyone in the house loved it! I followed everything but the brand of spices and used a chicken seasoning by McCormick instead of the goya...also a little more garlic but I love garlic :)

These chicken tacos are sooo delicious!  I used a can of diced tomoatoes and a small can of tomato paste (didn't have sauce) and it was better I think.  I also didn't have ancho chile powder but put in some chipotle pepper.  I make my own adobo seasoning (recipe online) to season the chicken breasts (don't throw it in the tomato sauce).  I used boneless skinless breasts, so I cut down their cooking time.  The shredded, sauced chicken was perfect in a corn taco shell with shredded Mexican cheese, chopped onion and lettuce!  A little more effort, but I will be making these again!

My husband really enjoyed this, but it was a little too tomato-y for me. I would probably reduce it with chicken broth next time.
