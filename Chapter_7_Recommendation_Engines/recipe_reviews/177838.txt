Delicious, the only thing this recipe didn't mention for the amateur cook, is to cut the sausage after it has cooked a little bit, otherwise the sausage gets mushy while trying to cut it raw.

This recipe was most delicious. I followed the recipe with the exception of the following: added about a half pound of crimini mushrooms. Instead of the spaghetti sauce I used a large can of whole tomatoes that I cut up into smaller pieces. Also used about 8-10 cloves of garlic. One of the best recipes I've gotten on this site. Having the leftovers tonight.

Very, very good! The only changes I made were to add mushrooms. You definetly want fresh parmesean to sprinkle over the pasta too.

So excellent! Quick and Easy. My whole family loved it! We used whole wheat penne and a red and green pepper. We also used spicy sausage. This one is surely a keeper!

Delicious... definitely a 4 1/2 star recipe... Not quite 5.  Made the recipe as per directions.  My family likes dishes a little bit spicier.  The traditional Prego sauce isn't spicy enough, so next time I will add 1 tsp. garlic powder and 1 tsp. of red pepper flakes.  Also, will add 1 more small jar of Prego - the penne needs more sauce to cover adequately.

This recipe was easy and delicious.  I didn't have any green or red peppers so I added a can of diced tomatoes with chillies to the sauce instead.  It was fabulous.  Thanks!

This is good.  I make a big batch and freeze in small containers for weeknight meals.  It's well-balanced, with veggies that my picky toddler will eat, so it works well for our family.

I would pay for this at a restaurant, this is outstanding. Only made a few changes...added fresh garlic, mushrooms, basil, crushed red pepper and extra sauce. You can tweak this recipe to your liking..next time I will throw in some zucchini also. This recipe is even better the next day which for me is shocking because I don't like leftovers. I would try this one you won't be sorry.

I didn't user the oil just cooked my sausage, peppers and onion together. I also used a jar and a half of Ragu (I didn't have Prego) as we thought it needed more sauce. I added moz cheese, cheddar and parm cheese. We all enjoyed this.

Good recipe!  I used hot Italian sausage, a mix of green, red and yellow bell peppers and bow tie pasta.  I cooked the sausage before trying to cut it into discs (much easier).  Since my sausage was already cooked through, there was no need to simmer for 20 minutes.  That would have robbed the peppers of their beautiful color and probably turned them to mush.  This made for a nice, quick dinner that was colorful too!

Have been making something similar to this for years - it is fantastic.  I have used either hot or sweet Italian sausage, whatever is available, and add red pepper as necessary to bring up the heat.  In cooking the sausage, I slit the casing and remove the sausage so that it cooks like ground beef.  Oh, and I also add mushrooms, sliced - gotta love the mushrooms.

This is pretty much just like the way I make my 'sausage and peppers rustica', except that I boil the sausage so that it's easier to cut into slices, and so I know it's cooked all the way through. This is a recipe that uses simple, everyday ingredients, but tastes like you spent a lot more time on it than you actually did. Great for an easy weeknight meal or to serve to company...this is one of my hubby's favorite pasta dishes~YUM! :)

Simple & yummy! I used the sweet Italian sausage & added minced garlic & hot pepper flakes when I added the sauce to the skillet. I also used one red pepper, one green pepper & half of one onion thinly sliced (that's how my husband prefers the onion cooked & he's not crazy about too much onion.

Have made this several times and it is good - so easy and quick.   Do prefer other sauces rather than Prego (e.g. Barilla Marinara) and also add mushroom and black olives.

Excellent! My husband loved this! Probably the only thing I did different was not use any oil. I had our favorite mild Italian Sausage that we like so much. I buy it on sale and then freeze it (1 lb pkgs). It's easy to slice when frozen or after it's thawed a little bit. Instead of using Parmesan we like the taste of Lucadelli.

I loved it and so did my kids. My Husband did not and I think it was the peppers. But that is ok cause it still rates excellent in my book and he said he would eat it again, but with out the peppers. So I think I will try that next time and leave it plain for him and keep the peppers for myself.

Sorry, but I won't make this again.  I wanted something different for the hot italian sausage I needed to cook.  The pasta was dry b/c there wasn't enough sauce.  The sausage flavor was not very strong and there wasn't much kick to the recipe.

I added garlic, mushrooms and red pepper flakes. Made sure the sausage was cooked when browning it and then didn't cook it for the full 20 minutes to preserve the crunchiness of the peppers and onions. It was great!

Great and Easy recipe.
I changed the recipe a little. First, I browned the whole sausage for about 5 minutes. Then I took them out to slice. Second, I sauteed the vegetables  and the sliced sausage all together in the pan. We love garlic! I also added 3 cloves of fresh pressed garlic. Then, I added a can of Italian diced tomatoes and a can of tomato and chile, a pinch of basil and oregano. I added pepper flakes for flavor. We like it a little spicy. It was a little too thick so I added half a jar of Prego sauce. Then I simmered it for about 30 minutes. Hmmmm delicious! Served over the pasta with fresh grated parmesan and fresh chopped parsley.

For a quick meal that didn't take too many ingredients this was very satisfying. I used turkey italian sausage and chunky mushroom prego sauce. Certainly made my hectic night a little easier, and I will make this again. Thanks!

Very easy to make and a nice alternative to spaghetti and meatballs. I added some fresh garlic to the onion and peppers, and also added basil and oregano to the sauce!

Delicious! I cut the veggies in half and added 4 cloves of garlic. I boiled the sausage first to make for easier slicing. After browning the sliced sausage in the pan, I deglazed the pan with about 1/3 cup of white wine. I still have plenty of leftovers for my lunch today.

This was so good!  I did add some fresh garlic and crushed red pepper flakes, after the sausage was just about done, I added the onions and peppers with the sausage and just combined everything in one for about 10 minutes.  Will definitely make again!

it was good but i agree that cooking the sausage just a bit before  cutting them was a better idea than cutting them raw. i also added mushrooms, another half  jar of prego sauce and cooked it just a little longer. great recipe!

i did this and it was awesome: saute skinny premio sausage with basil in big pot w/evoo until browned. then cut up and continue to cook in a little water so it doesn't burn.  after it cooks down, add diced red pepper and some onion and some pizza seasonings.  cook that together.  then take a 28oz can of whole tomatoes and put in the blender.  add s & p and basil until it tastes good. then add that to the sauce.  also add quarter to a half a can of paste.  let it simmer together for min to an hour to blend the flavors.  cook penne and add to pot. put the whole thing in one of my large bowls in d.r. top with parm cheese. serve w/garlic bread and salad. yum  10/31/10.

I've made this recipe twice now (with two variations) and we liked it both times.  The first time I used green pepper and all sausage, adding garlic powder and red pepper flakes to the recipe.  This week, I used a red pepper instead of green (which I preferred) and since I didn't have enough sausage, I improvised with some lean ground beef.  It was great either way.  I think the garlic powder and red pepper flakes give it some kick.  (Note: I used Target's Market Pantry traditional mariniara sauce b/c it was on sale for $.77! It was just as good as the Name Brand.)

This is good, nothing special, but good.  After browning the whole sausage, slice them. Also, I would suggest dicing the onions and peppers rather than having them in strips.

Great recipe.  I added 8 oz. sliced mushrooms since we love vegetables. I also used a 45 oz. jar of spaghetti sauce after reading several reviews.  I think it was more than enough and probably not necessary.  24 of 26 oz. would not really be enough - maybe add another small jar.  A very forgiving recipe.  What I really liked is that it let me make 1 recipe instead of 3 for my family - my picky 8-year old ate only sausage slices that I reserved, my husband ate only the sausage and peppers in sauce (gluten-free diet), and my daughter and I enjoyed it as is.  That's a winner in my book!

I really enjoy trying new recipes, and while most I try out are good, rarely do they make the cut of becoming a "regular".  This recipe is so good, I will definitely be making it again.  I cut the recipe in half for our family of 4, used half a green pepper and half a red, added in fresh mushrooms, a clove of garlic, and a dash of red pepper flakes.  It was fabulous!

Thank you for this simple, yet oh~so~tasty recipe! I made it accordingly except I added a little Oregano & Basil to the tomato & basil sauce :) I also added 1 medium Zucchini to the pasta, sliced thin, and the whole combination of flavors made for an awesome, filling dinner with the side dishes in the pasta!

We thought this was fantastic. We were looking for a new way to serve Italian Sausage. The only change I made was to add some minced garlic, use Hot Italian sausage and drain some of the grease before cooking the vegetables. Even the leftovers were awesome. Thanks for a Great Recipe.

I used homemade tomatoe sauce...plan was to make pizza but realized we'd run out of cheese...for this recipe.   I was quite surprised at how good this dish was. It was quick and simple but I was not expecting much.   Quite flavourful! We used hot Italian sausage so it had quite a kick. Kids (3 and 5) loved it!

tasty and easy to make. I saute garlic cloves right before adding the sauce, some dried oregano and basil. for those who are limiting carbs, this is great by itself or served over sauteed zucchini or butternut squash noodles!

I add some cream cheese or sour cream to the marinara to make a vodka sauce. This is a regular weekly recipe! I also like to use turkey italian sausage but I have to omit the onions for my picky eaters :)

Yummy! Changes I made: I use Classico Tomato & Basil (32 oz.), one onion, half green pepper and made up the difference with red and orange peppers (that's all I had in the freezer), added a 15 oz. can of basil flavored tomatoes (I had accidently opened the other evening) and a very few red pepper flakes. I got lots of compliments.

We loved the flavors of this dish as is. And it was so easy to make. Next time we may put  some pepper flakes and garlic in to punch up the dish. Mushrooms would be great in this as well.

I used to get this type of a dish from Bob Evans and started making it myself.  This is almost exactly how I made it, except for I usually add canned sliced mushrooms, cut the peppers into long strips and cut the sausage diagonally.

This is a really easy recipe for beginners and there is a lot of room for making changes if you feel like experimenting.

Too many vegetables and not enough sauce.  Next time I would use 1 pepper and 1 onion.  I even added a can of stewed tomatoes and still there was not enough sauce.  I added minced fresh garlic which helped.

I also added red pepper flakes, mushroom, garlic. I  would rather serve this on a french roll.
