This is a super yummy olden golden day's cocktail which was created for her after Prohibition when she had become a prolific imbiber of alcoholic beverages. It was created by bartender Eddie Woelke, an American who left to set up shop in Havana, Cuba. Woelke also invented the drink 'El Presidente'.     Mary Pickford actually had other cocktails named after her. One is the still well known cocktail, the 'Bloody Mary', which is thought to have been created by bartender Fernand Petiot of The St Regents Hotel in New York. Two all but forgotten cocktails are 'Romana' and ' Rosita' named after film characters that Mary Pickford played.

Love this! I put in vanilla vodka sometimes and it tastes like pineapple-upside-down cake :)

I thought it would be sweet, it was not, but still don't think I would ever make it again.
