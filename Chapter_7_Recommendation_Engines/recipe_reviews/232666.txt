This recipe is delicious, and is now a family favorite.  I bought pancetta already cubed  and saut√©ed it with the shallots. The only modification was that I sprinkled the tarragon. A few sprinkles is just enough.

Very good! I cut the recipe down and just sprinkled on the tarragon, to taste. Instead of cooking the pancetta in the oven, I just cooked it in the pan, added the evoo and the other ingredients, and cooked it up, which worked perfectly. This was a great way to 'dress up' asparagus, and I will be making it again! Thanks for sharing. :)
