I would recommend not going by the time based on here but what your oven is going to do. Just check your time by how they look they get crispy rather quick when they're thin. But these are wonderful chipsl

First, I cut the sweet potato more like 1/8” than 1/4” (this is the one star ding). Second, I mixed the slices with olive oil in a bowl to coat them thoroughly with less oil. Third, used a silicone sheet instead of foil. Fourth, I added salt, cinnamon, and chipotle-garlic grillmates seasoning before cooking. Allowed the chips to get brown on the edges and they’ll have crispiness, but not like a processed chip. (Buy those if that’s what you want.) Lastly, I let the chips cool on a cooling rack like one uses for cookies. Very tasty!! Thanks for posting this recipe! It was a very nice launching point for a super snack that I will make again and again!!!

It worked.  Today, March 23, is National Chip and Dip Day so I made these to go with the Hot Crab Dip from this site.  I think they should have cooked longer or at a higher temperature as they were really not crispy.

Got brown and crispy on the edges but still a little soft in the middle, they were good. Took awhile to slice with potato peeler, but good to have fresh chips.

Ha! these did not work for us at all. So sad too because we can't have "real" chips anymore. They never "hardened" regardless of how long they were cooked/dried.
