Nothing special about this recipe – except that it’s especially delicious.  I used San Marzano tomatoes from my garden and added fresh minced garlic.  This recipe perfectly illustrates how a dish needn’t be particularly involved or include a lot of ingredients to be awesome good.

Nothing new here.  This is a pretty common and basic recipe.  I did not have shells, but I did have Barilla Plus Farfalle pasta.  This is good when you are not in the mood for a heavy meal or need a light side dish.

Very nice.  Simple, easy, and quick.  it doesn't really need a lot of adjusting, but tolerates that well.  I was slow with the pasta water so tossed in some chicken broth to allow it to simmer, and added rosemary and thyme since my mother in law loves both.  Very delicious lunch-everyone enjoyed with some salad.  Thanks for the recipe!
