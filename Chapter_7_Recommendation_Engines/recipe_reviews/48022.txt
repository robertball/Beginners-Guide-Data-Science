An impressive (and great-looking) dish that is exceptionally easy to make. It took me a little over 30 minutes, which isn't really, really quick, but oh well. The taste was great, not awe-inspiring, but superb for how easy it was. A light paremesan cheesy with subtle garlic taste. Rice tastes especially great with a light salty chicken flavor from the broth. I substituted grated paremesan (spaghetti topping) for fresh shredded parmesan, which tasted great.

Tasty quick meal all in one.  The chicken it self was very bland, lacked pazazz, next time I will try it with boneless chicken thighs.  It may add a little more flavor.

This was a very good recipe. I didnt have any Parmesan so I used the shredded cheese and mixed it in w/ the other ingredients and it turned out even better. I would def use this recipe again.
