I used this recipe for honey-dijon chicken. I used reduced fat mayonnaise and because I was using homemade italian seasoning in the coating for the chicken, I used white wine vinegar in this recipe. (I wasn't really sure that rice wine vinegar would go well with italian seasoning, to be honest). It was absolutely perfect--just enough to coat four halved chicken breasts and it made the chicken wonderful. My husband and kids inhaled the chicken dish. I'll use this recipe again and again.

I needed something for chicken fingers tonight and this was delicious! I used Hellman's light mayo and Frank's red hot for the hot sauce which added a nice little kick!  This would make an excellent marinade or basting sauce...

This is great!  We loved it with ham.  I am sure it will be great with chicken too.  A really nice step up rom the standard mayo / mustard combo.  Thanks!

I thought this was good, but not great. I always make Honey Mustard Dressing II from the site, which I love. This was the adult version of honey mustard, as it had a definite kickback from the vinegar and hot sauce.

Made exactly as written. Easy and tasty. Based on my family's preferences, I would add more hot sauce next time but that is a personal preference. Very tasty just as written!

I used this recipe to make Honey-Mustard Turkey Breast from this site.  Wonderful!  I used Frank's Red Hot, Best Foods Mayo, Grey Poupon Dijon Country Style, French's Yellow Mustard, Busy Bee Organic Honey, and Nishiki Rice Vinegar.  I will definitely make this again!  Thanks for the recipe!

7.19.17  Enjoyed this today as a dipping sauce for some corned beef hash croquettes.  For our personal tastes, I cut the honey in half and doubled the hot sauce.  I can see this sauce being a perfect match for so many things, and I love how easy it is to mix up. This one’s a keeper!

I doubled the recipe to use as a dipping sauce for panko encrusted chicken tenderloins.
It was great.  This is a keeper.

Excellent! Everyone loved it, we used it as marinade and dipping sauce for grilled chicken. I didn't put all of the hot sauce in because we have little kids, but definitely gave it a good dash or two. I also noticed as I was copying it into my recipe file that I actually misread the recipe and put 2 TABLESPOONS of yellow mustard in. Nevertheless, very good!

Amazing!!  I didn't put the hot sauce cuz of small kids and it already has a little kick to it cuz of the Dijon. It was perfect. Will make this over and over again for sure. Thanks chef John for another amazing recipe!!

Wow, this is a really delicious mustard sauce exactly like it is written.  I whipped this up the night before serving it, to let the flavors meld.  It was great with Slow Cooker Ham (also from this site).   (Because my husband loves honey, he doubled only that ingredient, and it sent him over the moon.)

Doubled the recipe and made the following modifications:
Lime Juice instead of lemon
added Cayenne pepper to taste (FOR ME ABOUT A 1/16 TEASPOON)
It is great on chicken of course but really wakes up a Turkey sandwich

This is delicious! I didn’t have rice vinegar so I looked online and found you can use white wine vinegar with 1/4 tsp sugar, which is what I did. Kept everything else the same. Served with veggie corn dogs. This will definitely be the mustard sauce I make from now on.

I thought it had too much vinegar and not enough honey. Will adjust that and it should be OK.

AS IS, it just didn't maintain each item's flavour. I used tabbasco, which may have made it less tasty. I'd actually say 3.5 stars. I didn't stop eating it.

This was great, I made it exactly as written except for using reduced fat mayo because that's all we keep in the house.  I made this to go with some chicken nuggets and it was perfect, spicy, sweet and a little tangy.  Even better after sitting in the fridge for a few hours.

This was very good.  I made roughly half the recipe to serve with Potato Chip Chicken, also from this site.   I would make this again, whenever I’m in need of a honey mustard dipping sauce.

Perfect honey mustard sauce! The rice vinegar and the hot sauce really add depth of flavor to this.
