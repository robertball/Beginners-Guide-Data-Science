What a fun and delicious meal to make. I used pizza dough instead of bread dough since I had my own in the freezer, and fresh herbs in the Parmesan sauce. The Parmesan sauce shines through in every bite of this Stromboli, a nice change from the regular tomato sauce. I did also top the deli meat and provolone cheese with some shredded mozzarella cheese since we love cheese. Mine was perfectly golden brown in 25 minutes. I enjoyed it just as it, but the son and husband enjoyed dipping theirs in pizza sauce. Very versatile on what deli meats and cheese you use, but don't omit the great Parmesan sauce because it takes this Stromboli over the top. Thanks cris for a great recipe. A keeper in this household.

I made this for recipe group on 3/04/13. If you've never made (or eaten) a stromboli, this is lacking in instruction. It doesn't give any clues as to how big the rectangle should be, how thick/thin the dough should be, or how to roll it up. I have never eaten or made a stromboli so perhaps others take it for granted. Regardless, I got help and got it made. I used homemade pizza dough and pizza size pepperoni instead of sandwich size (about 18 slices). I rolled it up jellyroll style, sealed the end seams like I do a loaf of bread and it ended up being 15" by about 4". The only change I made was to eliminate the eggs due to allergy. I coated the inside with olive oil and sprinkled on the seasoning and parmesan. I also sprayed the top with olive oil and that worked to keep on the toppings. It baked in about 25 min in a convection oven. We liked these so I'm not knocking the recipe rating but I would have passed this by due to lack of instructions if it hadn't been a recipe group pick.

Made this for Recipe Group.  This was a hit tonight!  I used homemade Pizza Dough and omitted the egg and mushrooms.  I served with pizza sauce on the side for dipping which everyone in our home preferred over eating with no sauce.  Flavor and presentation was great!  Thanks for sharing this keeper, cris!

I didn't have frozen dough so I used two packages of refrigerated crescent rolls.  I did not add the green pepper or mushrooms and added capicola. Yummy!  The egg, seasoning mixture is the key to this recipe.  I will definitely be making this again. Easy peasy and would be great for a party!

Made for Recipe Group. Never met a stromboli I didn't like! The sauce/dressing for this is good! I used the tubed pizza dough, rolled it out on parchment on a sheet pan, braided the top instead of rolling the dough. I 'sauteed' the onions in the microwave with a splash of olive oil and some garlic powder, added them to some already roasted peppers and left out the mushrooms. Fantastic combination, thanks for the recipe!

Fabulous. Rave reviews. Great to make for a party buffet since it can be hot or cool. I made the meat and cheese version and I made a vegetarian version with more veggies.

This will be my go-to recipe for any variation.

This is a great and easy recipe.  I used pizza dough (for a medium pizza) instead of the frozen bread dough.  This a perfect recipe for those who can not or do not enjoy pizza sauce.

Nice recipe. Made it as per the recipe and it came out great. 
With the exception of adding bruschetta bread topping, I drained it well so it wouldn't make the sandwich soggy.

I had problems first with the frozen bread dough, I couldn't get it stretched out.  Tried with pizza dough and it got too thin in places and too thick in others.  The parmesan sauce was too thick to spread well or else there wasn't enough of it - I had to make more.  Maybe I tried to go too big?  Will try again with some adjustments.

This is so good!  I needed a stromboli twice in one week.  The first one I used Pillsbury crescent rolls from the can.  It was good and perfect for 4.  Needed a bigger one for the 2nd day and so glad I used this recipe and the frozen bread dough.  The egg yolk and Parmesan are so perfect.  Got loads of  raves from all who enjoyed it.  Thank you, Cris, for sharing!

I make this once a week and my family never gets tired of it. I use canned pizza dough to save time. I omit the ham and usually use pepperoni and good genoa salami from the deli. I serve it with warm spaghetti sauce for dipping. DEEE-LISH!

This is an absolutely delicious recipe and one I continue to make on a regular basis.  The sauce/herb mixture is the star for sure.   I have made it many hours in advance and refrigerated it until I was ready to bake and it always comes out perfect.   My only advice is to keep it simple.  It may not seem like a lot of filling but more is definitely not better.

This was fantastic followed to the t, it was very easy to roll up and looked beautiful . The white sauce is a must it was flavorful and a little nutty from the parm cheese, this makes a lot so have some company to help you eat it up.

Recipe Group selection 3/4/13.  I used homemade bread dough since I had it in the freezer.  I don't care for pepperoni so I used hard salami and deli ham in place of Virginia.  Everything else remained the same.  Plans had to be shuffled and dinner postponed.  Rather than serve it cold, I cut it into portions and used my Panini maker.  We will have this many more times.

Recipe Group Selection:  02, March 2013 ~ Oh yeah, this was a winner in our house!  My guys LOVED this sandwich!  It was a lot easier to make than I thought it was going to be.  I wasn’t sure how thin to roll this out, so I just kept rolling until I thought it looked about right.  I used all the ingredients listed with the exception of the mushrooms (we’re not fans).  My pepperoni was the small size, so I just put in what I thought looked like a nice amount.  I did not have any problems rolling this up and it baked up perfectly in 35 minutes.  I did let it rest, with a piece of foil laid loosely on top for about 5-7 minutes before I cut it to give the cheese a little time to set up.  I served this with ‘Quick Italian Pasta’ and ‘Brookville Hotel Sweet and Sour Coleslaw’ both AR recipes.  Family thought I was a “superstar” with this meal.  Thanks cris for sharing your recipe! :o)

Made this for Recipe Group selection.  I changed the recipe ingredients by using olive oil and adding a small can of mushrooms as I didn't have fresh. I also used about 1/2 cup of green pepper and sweet onion.   I also used a blend of part-skim Provolone, Romano, Asiago, Mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses for the filling. The amount of spices remained the same. Overall, it was well received by the family. Thanks for sharing your friend of a friend's recipe cris!

I used crescent rolls since that is what I had. I tried to use one can to make a meal for two, but ended up using two because it looked like there was not enough bread. I just wrapped the second can of rolls around the already wrapped Stromboli and baked it. Turned out great! I did not tweak the recipe, nor do I think it needs any revisions.

This is my go-to stromboli recipe & is my mom's as well. The parm/egg yolk mixture is so good and flavorful. I did the egg white mixture on top the first time I made it, and it slid off and stuck to my pan, so I have not done the egg white mixture since! Dip in marinara or pizza sauce. Mmmm :)

Super easy to make, went to TJ's and bought some pre-made pizza dough.($1.29!) Spread the eggs, threw all the fixings inside and rolled it up.  Free styled another with the same egg wash inside and out, both came out a cheesy delicious roll of pizza.

This worked out really well as it was written.  I have used this template to make different strombolies based on what was on hand. The Parmesan, egg yolk sauce made a rich and yummy addition to the flavors.  I used bread dough like the recipe said.  It took some handling to get it to the right size and I found the pizza method of drape and spin over your fists worked best. Trying to roll it out didn't work so well.

I made 2  of these for a New Year's Eve church event.  One had only  the meat and cheese, and the other had the veggies as well.  They were a hit.  I will make these again.

What a great sunday night meal.  I used pizza dough and turkey pepperoni, but I think the sauce is what makes it so good.  Didn't change anything with the sauce.  Will make this a go to weekend meal.

This was a hit at our summer picnic.  To clarify, I used 1/2  lb thinly sliced ham, 8 slices salami instead of pepperoni,  1/2 cup green peppers, and the roll out type ready to bake pizza crust.  I omitted the mushrooms and onions,  because hubby doesn't like them.   Rolled it up jelly roll style, finished product was about 15 x 4, and baked for 30 minutes.  Looked beautiful on the top with the egg glaze, cheese and seasoning.

Easy peazy to make and oh so delish. Served with a side of warm red sauce. Dear hubby went back for seconds! This made many portions for the two of us so after it cooled I sliced and froze the extra's. The leftovers froze and re-heated nicely.

I have made this recipe several times. My family loves it! Over time I have switched the ham for Italian sausage just because my family likes it. Amazing! The egg sauce that is spread on the dough is key to making this so delicious!

Use olive oil instead of eggs. Stuff with sausage peppers onions and mozz or chicken Tom and mozz too.

Yummo!  Made this for dinner.  My husband and boys enjoyed it.  Used Wheat Portland Pie dough instead of bread dough.  Also used ham, pepperoni, genoa salami and mozzarella cheese.  Was delish!  A keeper for sure...will play around with ingredients next time.

Easy to put together, just plan ahead. The spread that goes on the dough was very good. Everyone enjoyed this very much.

You can add whatever meats and cheese you like, But definitely use the parmesan cheese mixture inside. It adds a great flavor and makes it all come together well. I WILL make this again. Very easy and makes a wonderful meal, and leftovers are good for lunches too (if there are any).

Made this for recipe group...DELICIOUS!!!! The only change I made was to omit the oregano fron the egg/parm mixture b/c we are not huge fans of too much oregano. This was easy to make and baked up beautifully...A definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)
