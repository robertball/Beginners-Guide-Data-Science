I love this, looks like its a pain to make - but so much more healthy.  Look at the sodium content on canned or boxed stocks, this has much more flavour and you get a whole lot which is easy to freeze for later use.  Loved it!

Thank you for the clearinstructions.  I have always wanted to be able to make this, and I agree that the pure beef flavor makes the most  useful and versatile stock. Since today's slow cookers are set at a higher temperature than the ones originally made, it is nw perfectly possible to make this stock in one of them from start to finish.  I buy beef bones from an Asian market (in case you can't find them in hyour supermarket).

This is how I make my stock.  The only thing I do different is to roast them for an hour at 350 degrees first.  I also put cheesecloth
over my strainer and that helps catch all those fine particles.

This recipe is indeed easy, but it is time consuming!  If you want to do this on a weekend, start on Friday night, after dinner.  I had to interrupt the cooking time because I didn't start until Saturday morning.  It didn't hurt a thing, in fact it probably helped me manage it, because refrigerating it after removing bones and straining allowed the fat to congeal, for easy removal.  Also, bonus:  my strainer did not get the finer particles out, which I discovered after refrigeration.  They settled to the bottom, and I was able to remove before the final reduction.  Beautiful, healthy beef stock with a surprisingly good color.  I think next time I will roast the bones prior to simmering, for an even deeper color and flavor.  Thanks for your clear instructions!

This is perfect for a healthy, no-frills stock. When done cooking, let cool slightly then pour into ice cube trays and freeze. Much easier for portions.

I made this and it's absolutely divine! I could get beef bones at my local grocery store that has the best meat next to a butcher which we don't have in our small town. I split the bones up into five pound packages and used two large crock pots and it turned out perfectly. I froze it in small portions, popped it out and stored it in large zip top bags. When I wanted it I just reached in and got what I needed.

I went out and bought bones and just started it. To Chris Lidberg, the butcher uses a saw to cut the bones up. My name brand grocery stores don't do actually butchering anymore; their stuff comes prepacked. I went to the carneceria.

to answer Chris Lidberg's question;
the bones are usualy sold at the market cut into managable pieces, but you can always ask the buther/meat department to cut them up for you.

I made 6.5 lbs of boned in sirloin roast last weekend. I saved the bones and all the extra fat.  I added four stalks of celery, a carrot, half an onion, two bay leaves, and dried basil.  Then I put the leftover bones and whatnot on top of the veggies and covered with 6 c. of water.  Put it on low in the slow cooker for 8 hours.  Strained it with a fine mesh strainer.  It turns out the ice cube trays hold 1/8 c. for each cube, so I used those to freeze the broth and ended up putting them in a plastic bag in the freezer.  It's a space saver (vs using mason jars or tupperware), and now I know exactly how much I'm pulling out for each recipe.  ...and the flavor is SO much better than the store bought stuff.  Thanks for posting!

I made according to directions. My dad is a cattle farmer so I had "soup bones" in my freezer that I needed to use up. Pick a couple of days that you are home. Leave it alone & let it cook. Easy. Delicious & good for you.

Made a great beef stock. Roasted the bones and veggies first for two hours then put everything in stock pot and went to town. Instead of freezing I canned them for later usage canned makes them last longer

I love the simplicity of this recipe and plan to make it soon, but was wondering if anyone could tell me how they actually cut the bones into smaller pieces.  Thanks.

I just started making this last nite. It is so very simple in the crock pot!!  I tasted it after about 18 hours and it  is already pretty flavorful.  I put the crock pot on high for 3 hours, and have had it on low ever since.  Thank you for  the great recipe!

Great Beef  flavor!   Best ever.   The extended cooking time really brings out the beef.      I could not monitor the pot for 48 hours so I did it in 4 spurts.... refrigerating in my winter garage each time.

Perfectly simple!  Many recipes over-complicate the process of bone broth.  
1 - Bones (beef/chicken/pork/fish roasted or not) 
2 - Cover with water
3 - Cook long and slow  
Try using a slow cooker, since you can set it and go.
I love a good bone broth!
