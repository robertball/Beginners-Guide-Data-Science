This recipe is an excellent base recipe for cheesecake. It is a little "gritty/grainy" because of the ricotta cheese; however, it is not as "gritty" as a traditional ricotta cheesecake due to the cream cheese and sour cream. I added a 1/2 cup of sugar, 1T of vanilla and some crystallized ginger.  Therefore, it was not even slightly bland.  This cake is great to experiment with, and since I like to play with my food I will continue to experiment. Overall, the cake was great. Light, sweet, and flavorful...a definite keeper.

This was another one of the 3 cheesecakes I made for taste-testing.  It rated 3rd due to the grainy texture and lack of taste.  It did, however, bake up beautifully, no cracks, didn't sink, had a lovely appearance.

Although this is a very easy cheesecake to make and comes out very creamy, it doesn't have much flavor.  A 1/2 tsp of vanilla does little.  Try adding more vanilla, or adding additional extracts like almond or orange.  Maybe even a little liquer.  If not, the taste will be flat.

Wonderful… such an easy and tasty crustless cheesecake! I loved the ricotta flavor. I opted for almond extract versus vanilla, and then served it with fresh strawberries. I did change the baking a bit by using my favorite method for thick creamy cheesecakes: bake at 400 degrees for 20 mins, then 200 degrees for 2 1/2 – 3 hours, next turn the oven off and let the cheesecake cool inside for another couple hours, finally chill overnight. Thanks for the great recipe!

This is the GREATEST cheesecake recipe ever!  The recipe must be followed to a tee, and it shouldn't be whipped too long with the electric mixer, but if you cook it long enough and bake it in a pan of water, it is restaurant quality!!!  Very easy recipe, too!

This is a very tasty cheesecake and I agree that tastes even better next day. Even people who don't usually care for cheesecake liked this one. I made topping using 1 cup whipping cream, 2 Tbsp. sugar, 1/2 cup milk, 4 Tbsp. instant pudding (vanilla flavor, next time will try strawberry flavor), just put everything in a bowl and mix till thickens. Then I spread it on the cooled cake and served with halved strawberries around each portion. This goes to my favorite recipes.

This cheescake is like the canvass to an inspired artist.. The taste of the basic recipe is very even, very smooth and could be considered a little bland, but very inspiring.  But that's no reason to not try it.  It's an amazing recipie that will inspire you you be creative...

I changed this a little. First I made a base from 10 digestives and 6 ginger nuts with 85g/3oz butter in the blender and baked at 150c/300f for 10-15 mins. When mixing, I used the food processor for all the mixing of ingredients and the texture came out rather creamy and delicious. Also, I used an 8inch tray instead of a 10 inch one. This made the cheesecake really deep (SO much batter!) so I left the oven at 150 and cooked an extra 20-30 mins. I served it with chocolate powder sprinkled on top and some single cream. 

Everyone raved about this cheesecake. The extreme depth went down quite well all round. Even the smallest sliver was still a nice sized piece! I'll make this again.

Excellent cheesecake.  Wrap the bottom of the pan in foil to waterproof it so it doesn't get waterlogged while baking in the water bath.  The texture changes after it gets thoroughly chilled so it tastes better if you wait to eat it until then.  Wait overnight if you can.

My father would bring home a cheesecake from an Italian bakery that was so light and creamy.  This recipe is the closest to the tast of that.  I make a similar recipe with 3 packages of cream cheese, but the ricotta makes this one lighter.  I added a teaspoon of lemon extract and I lined both the inside and outside of the pan with foil - no water leakage at all.

Did not care for the texture of this cheesecake, and it was extremely bland, in fact I would say there was no taste at all . The only thing that would give it flavor would be to slather some type of topping on it.  Will not make again.

This is THE BEST!  I've made all sorts of variations on it and have always had a great cheesecake.  I've made it gluten free by using featherlight mix, I've added raspberry flavorings, I've sprinkled chocolate chips on top after it's done. . . I've made it diabetic for the old people in my family by using Splenda, I've used egg alternatives for the same old people - it always comes out great.  The only thing I didn't like was using soy flour instead of all purpose - but everyone else liked it.  Also, I've learned you can only make them on one shelf at a time - in other words, if you can fit 3 in one pan on the top shelf go for it, but don't put one on the top shelf and one on the bottom shelf.  Both come out mushy and not set at all.

This cheesecake has an absolutely perfect texture. However, it doesn't seem to be sweet enough, so try adding 5 TBLS extra sugar.  Also, it doesn't seem to have the bite that one associates with cheesecake... it's a bit bland.

This cheesecake was good but not the best. I liked that you didn't have to use as much cream cheese and the ricotta definitely gave it a different texure.  The taste was a little bit different than what I'm used to - not as creamy cheesey (obviously) but was still good.  Would make again if I were in a pinch and didn't have as much cream cheese as is necessary for most other recipes.

This is REAL cheesecake, not the sugary stuff you find too often in restaurants and smothered in cherry pie filling or gobs of fake cream.  The ricotta gives it great texture - I mixed the ingredients in the KitchenAid mixer and it was perfect.  I did, however, add 1 tablespoon of vanilla and left it in the oven at 150 for an hour instead of turning it off as the recipe suggested.  Everyone raved about this dessert.  I had a slice at 11 this morning with a strong cup of coffee.  Bliss.

the cheese cake itself was good, but the problem is with the water. i've always put a separate dish of water on the other shelf in the oven. i tried it this way, and wrapped it sooo well with foil, but it still leaked. i say stick to the separate dish of water...

Simple to make, I liked the idea of no crust.  Did make a few changes for my taste, though. Used all reduced fat ingredients, and a little lemon juice.

I made this cheesecake a few days ago, and I just wasn't very impressed. It was good, but I guess I was expecting more since it got so many great reviews. I followed the recipe exactly, except I had to make a smaller cheesecake as well since it made so much batter. I used an 8” springform rather than a 10” since I don’t have one, but I had enough batter left over for a two 5” springform pans as well. 

The cheesecake was a bit grainy, even though I beat it thoroughly; the batter was quite creamy looking when I put it in the pan. I also thought it needed to be sweeter. Topping to with strawberries and strawberry sauce helped, but by itself it would have been too bland. It also cooked up very dark and cracked halfway through baking, but that may be due to the smaller pan size. 

I probably won’t use this recipe again, or if I do, I’ll add more sugar and probably leave out the ricotta, or just use a lot less.

This is the best cheesecake on earth.  I used pure Mexican vanilla and 1/4 cup more sugar.  I was asked for the recipe by all who attended the party!  Comments? This is the best cheesecake on earth!  It's well worth the time to make to so completely please your guests.

This recipe was such a welcomed sight to see. It's hard to find recipes with both Ricotta & cream-cheese.  I made a few modifications that really made it work out well for me!  I used 1 whole 500g container of ricotta cheese (the fresh soft cheese BARI Brand). I also used 1 & 1/4 cups of sugar.  I didn't use a springform pan. Instead I baked it in a greased 14" round cake pan. I lined the bottom with a round cut piece of parchment paper, and I used a graham cracker crust to press into the sides only of the pan. Once it was baked, I refrigerated it overnight, and it unmolded with great ease. I simply flipped it upside down onto a plate, peeled off the parchment paper, and put a moderately thickened cherry topping on it.  I was slightly disappointed that it cracked on the top, but that may have been my oven, or because I used less ricotta than the recipe called for. Since I was flipping it over anyway, the crack never became an issue.  It was beautiful with the cherry topping, and the sides full of graham cracker. 
Great recipe to experiment with. Everyone ranted & raved about my cheesecake :-) Thanks for sharing!

Have made this several times now- a great favorite at work. It was the only desert finished off at the Christmas party- at a table filled with pies, cookies and cakes. (Most pies remained untouched) The name says it all!!

I don't agree that this cheesecake is grainy at all. It is THE best cheesecake recipe I've EVER tried! I've been using it for years and always get rave reviews. I serve it with fresh strawberries.

This was... alright. I split cooking the batter into 2 seperate dishes - I wanted a traditional in-the-crust cheesecake with this, and then the rest in a small square dish with the water pan. like the recipe says. Everything cooked great and worked - but it's not as "cheesecake" tasting as I was hoping. The texture wasn't as smooth either, even though I had it in the mixer to cream it for awhile.  This is a "hmmm" cake. I'll probably look for another one to try out.

The ricotta cheese in the recipe created a gritty consistency. There was little to no favor in the cake and my family hated it! I have to say this is the last time I'll make this cake.

The ricotta makes this grainy.  I would never make again.  It was edible, but far from the "best cheesecake on earth".  Don't waste your time or ingredients.

I made this for my birthday party last month and it was a huge hit!! I also had some fresh strawberries and rasberries sliced up  (and mixed with sugar to make a syrup), and chocolate sauce on the side so my guests could dress up their cake how they wanted.

This cheesecake is awesome. Very light & delicate. Just like the Italian restaurants back home. I mixed instant coffee granules with a bit of water and swirled it through the batter just before placing it in the oven. Mmmmm.

This is the easiest, lightest and BEST cheesecake recipe.  I made this for Easter and then for a business luncheon.  Everyone raved and raved about this cheesecake and insisted I give them the recipe.

This cheesecake was just like Mommy-Amoia made.  We have not had cheesecake since my grandmother passed away this would have made her proud.  It was very good and just like we remembered.  I do mess up with the flour and added too much but but you could not notice.  I will definitely make this again as it was a crowd pleaser.

This was a cheesecake recipe my dad always made and loved, rave reviews whenever it is made, I follow the recipe with one small difference-I put the ricotta cheese in my food processor with the metal blade to smooth it all out--awesome. Also, vanilla bean added with some extract does give it more oomph.

This cheesecake is the answer for a low carb follower.  I use sucralose instead of sugar and everyone loves it!!  Experiment with almond, walnut or other flours for a different taste.  It is the best!

If you add 2 or 3 ginger mint leaves (cutted up into small pieces), that will be the hit on a summer party afternoon.

OK, I am not sure why the rave as the recipe is not good. I followed the instructions to the letter. It was "gritty" in texture, not smooth, no crust and no flavor. Much better recipes out there.

This is the definitive cheesecake recipe; it delivers exactly what the cook promised. It reminds me of the cakes I used to eat at my Italian friends house, but it's better.

How good is that?

I think this is a great and easy to make cheesecake.  I used skim milk ricotta and low fat cream cheese and sourcream, and used bulk splenda (or any sugar sub for baking)and you get a great dessert with less fat and calories.  If you dont tell anyone its lower fat-no one would be able to tell

This is wonderful! Very creamy. I made this for a family reunion and it was devoured. I was lucky to get a small sliver. I have numerous requests for a repeat. I will be sure to make an extra one next time.

My whole family loves this cheesecake although I've made a few alterations to the recipe.  Instead of sour cream, I use creme fraiche and have added 5 additional tablespoons of sugar.  However you make this,  it's terrific.

it wasn't as sweet as usual cheesecake that doesn't use ricotta but it was good. I think I prefer the creamier sweeter new york cheesecakes however.

I LOVE this recipe! This is my go-to holiday cheesecake recipe. I get many compliments from family (they ask me to make it every year for Christmas day). I agree with other reviewers who say that this is not a sweet recipe. However, coming from an Italian family, where we'd make a plain ricotta cheesecake, we are used to a cheesecake that is not very sweet. The cake itself is light and fluffy (not too heavy). I also make a raspberry sauce that can be drizzled over the cake, if anyone wishes. In my experience, however, most people love it plain! If looking for an interesting addition, you could add lemon or orange zest (or orange extract) to the cake batter. I tried this a few times - also very good!

Do not bake this cheesecake in hot water!  I did and the whole thing was ruined because of a leak, though I followed the instructions to the letter.  The water leaked into the pan past the foil and spoiled an afternoon's work.  It might be great, but I will never know.

I made this on Thanksgiving for those in my family who don't like fruit pies. Not bad, but not the best on earth. It came out of the oven beautifully -- no cracks, done just right. However, everyone found the filling to be rather bland. Luckily I'd sprinkled some English toffee pieces on top of the crust & made a bittersweet ganache to top it, which made it more enjoyable. Maybe an additional teaspoon of vanilla would have helped the flavor of the filling.

The water in the baking pan leaked through the foil to the springform pan both times I tried this.  It made the cheesecake at the bottom soggy and only the top was right.  I had to take the top layer of both and cut them into pieces to make cheesecake squares for Christmas.

This truly lives up to its name.  I am not a cheesecake fan, but my son found the recipe and made it.  I now make this for every suitable occasion, and even when there is no occasion.  This is the very best cheesecake I have ever tasted, and all of my family agree.

the name does say it all. Absolutley the best cheescake.  Even a novice can make this one.
