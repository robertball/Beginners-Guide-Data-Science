I have never baked with spelt flour before but these came out great in spite of my lack of experience. Spelt offered a slightly nutty flavor to the scones. I do think this would be great using allpurpose flour so next time I will test that. Chef is right, these are more like a very tender biscuit with juicy blueberries. Will definitely make these again.  YUMMMMMM!

These scones are delicious.  I was very worried when I added the buttermilk to the dry ingredients because the dough was more like a pancake batter, that is, VERY wet!  I  sprinkled more flour (a lot) and more soda and powder and salt, just eyeballing it.  I left it quite wet, since Wet-ish doughs seem to be a good thing.

It could be that the chef's sprouted spelt was more absorbent.  I used Bob's Red Mill spelt.

In the end, these were wonderful. Layers inside because of the pieces of butter, and crunchy and beautiful on the outside.
Embarrassed to say I ate four after they had cooled a bit.
 

About the grated butter: I had to really work it with my fingers to get the grated pieces down in size to look like coarse crumbs.

I used all purpose flour and frozen blueberries and they were delicious.  I will be making these again, maybe adding a tad bit more cinnamon and nutmeg. But overall great recipe.

I make scones as a Christmas treat for my neighbors every year.  I usually make two types and this year, decided to try these blueberry scones as my second type.

I made the two (different) recipes back to back and noticed a few differences.  The first recipe had eggs in it, while this one did not.  The second major difference was the cooking temperature.  The first recipe baked at 375* for 25 minutes.  I was surprised by the higher temperature and same cooking time for these scones.

These blueberry scones taste delicious - they are not too sweet.  However, I felt that the dough was a little dry.  I ended up adding more buttermilk.  

Next time I think I'll try baking them at the lower temperature - they seemed to get dark on the outside quickly but needed a little more time for the inside to get done.

Finally, I didn't like shredding the frozen butter.  Next time I think I'll try the more traditional method of cutting the softened butter in with a pastry cutter.  I don't expect it makes a real difference in the way they bake?

Overall, a good recipe and one I'll make again with these slight modifications.

I made this for Easter. I thought (foolishly) that you could do a one  for one substitution using almond flour instead of the spelt.  Wrongo! So if anyone out there thinks this will work, I will forewarn you that this is not the case and maybe this review can save you some grief.  The dough (actually batter) was super wet. I had to add an additional 3/4 c of almond flour, 2/3 whole wheat and 2/3 bread flour.  (Yeah, it got kinda crazy!) Anyway, when I got it together, it sort of worked.  Followed all the directions as written to include baking temp and time. The result: a reasonable scone, probably a bit on the dryer side, but it was edible.

The changes I made: I used all-purpose flour, low-fat buttermilk (1 cup), salted butter (and didn't add the salt in the recipe) and regular sugar for sprinkling. After 25 minutes of baking, I turned off the oven and let the scones sit for another 4 minutes to get a more golden topping. I love the video that accompanies the recipe, super helpful and simple to make. The scone has the perfect, fluffy texture and is not too sweet!

These are wonderful.  I used what I had, Unbleached AP flour.  They came out moist and fluffy on the inside and a little crunchy on the outside from the sugar.  Just sweet enough to make them really special.  This will definitely be my go to recipe.

My 5 year old made these by himself, and they came out amazing.  I can't believe they only have 2 T sugar.  Another big hit from Chef John, thanks!

These were super yummy for extra blueberries. Easy enough for my 13 year old daughter to make by herself. Definitely opt for the sugar.

For me it was a complete disaster. 3/4 of a cup of buttermilk is just not enough liquid to form it into any kind of a shape. It just fell apart on my board into a pile of dry crumbs while the blueberries jumped off the table because they wouldn't incorporate. I'm off spelt flour for good.

I did not have spelt so used all purpose gluten free flour. I used vegan butter from the fridge and cut in with a pastry cutter. I used cashew milk and did not wash the tops with milk. As an afterthought I did sprinkle natural white sugar on top. Mine were pretty wet because I used double the milk, so I folded in additional ww flour and spread the dough across the backing sheet and cut triangles in a more rustic form.  I made a lemon and powdered sugar glaze for after baking. Despite my changes and really big mistake, they turned out wonderfully!
