I have never had or even heard of Big Bob Gibson so I cannot compare this recipe to that sauce but I will say this is good. I did make one change which is probably a big change but I'll explain. I've been eyeballing this recipe for quite some time now but the Miracle Whip is what has stopped me from making it. That is all I ever had growing up and mom always called it mayo so I thought it was all one and the same. It was too sweet and I didn't like it. It wasn't until I got married that hubs asked me why I never bought real mayo for recipes. What? So, it has been real mayo from that point on. I stumbled on this recipe again yesterday and did some Googling in regards to Big Bob and every single copycat version I found actually called for mayo. So, mayo it was. I used it to dip grilled chicken and vegetables in and it was good. It was a tad too sweet for me so next time I'd reduce the amount of sugar and double the amount of horseradish. If you are a fan of Miracle Whip I say go for it but I wanted to let you know that it works well made with real mayo too.

It was good but needed a little something, something extra.

Such a simple sauce, with great impact on the flavors of my smoked meats.  I put it on pork and chicken as well as lamb.  I love it.  It will be a regular in my house, it even improved my coleslaw.
