A good basic idea but too many pots and too much fuss. There is no need to boil the potatoes first. Just use the second step... saute aromatics in oil, add diced potatoes and corn. Add liquid, cook till potatoes are tender. Press into the pot with the back of your spoon to mash up for thickening or take a little out and blend then put back in. No flour needed. Besides the flour isn't used correctly in the first place... should be added to the fat. This application is correct for corn starch. It shouldn't take 30 minutes start to finish. I replaced the Yukon potato with finely diced carrot and the soy milk with coconut milk (added at the end,) but that's just personal dietary preference. Made a very nice lunch!

Turned out well! My blender was not working to blend the sweet potatoes so I used my immersion blender wand. I also added more than the suggested cayenne pepper to give it more kick. I also ended up using regular cow milk instead of soy milk and adding a tablespoon of butter based on household preferences. I tried it before I added the milk and butter and it tasted good though!

I did not follow either. ....I just cooked all in one pot . Then took half and blended it and added back in. I also do cornstarch slurry to thicken at end.

I was looking for a cold rainy spring day stew and came across this recipe and was intrigued.  Usually my first try I follow a recipe according to the exact measures and prep, however, after reading the other comments I made the following modifications - pre-cut sweet potato boiled along with a russet, I forgot to reserve any of the water, so I used 3 cups of veg broth and 2 cups of coconut milk (so delicious unsweetened) I also added more than a pinch of cayenne and about a 1/2-1 teaspoon of smoked paprika.  Oh and 1 cup of sweet baby peas added with the corn.  I used gluten-free all purpose flour that I added to the onion, celery, garlic sautéed at the beginning to make a "roux" and begin the thickening early.   It was so comforting and yummy ... I served with baked tofu crusted with old bay seasoned potato chips.  Perfect for the day!

Deeeeeeelicious!  The only change I made was to add a splash of nutmeg and a smaller dash of cinnamon.  Enjoying this soup was the soup form of  a warm  hug. We had a crusty French bread to dip into  soup, and man on man... fantastic! Thank you so much for the recipe!  It’s a definite keeper.

Loved this as a base recipe! I was looking for a sweet potato soup to help me get rid of some Thanksgiving leftovers and this was perfect. I ended up sticking to the recipe and cooking the sweet potatoes first, which I then blended with about 1 1/2 cups of the potato water plus some peas and spices. I subbed sweet peas for corn, unsweetened coconut milk for almond, skipped ginger/celery, added a tomato and a TON of wilting parsley. Mixed the flour in a small bowl with a scoop or two of the broth before mixing into the full soup to avoid clumps. Delicious!

Made pretty much as written, except I didn't use flour and  I added some Kuwaiti spice mix. Warm, hearty, and spicy. So good for these cool fall days.

Wonderful to have celery and ginger in this chowder! We enjoyed the blend of flavors.  I did not peel the potatoes.  I used my hand blender to mash part of the potatoes, and did not even need the flour for this thick hearty chowder!
