My husband thought these were great as written and I'm sure most would agree. I personally would have liked less sugar and more jalapeno. This is a recipe that can be easily adapted to suite your family's taste which is always a bonus. Thanks for sharing your recipe KSWRIGHT!

Made this dish in my slow cooker  for a 4th of July pot luck barbeque, it was  a hit - the only changes I made were to omit the jalapeno peppers and added 1 tbsp of jalapeno powder and 1/4 tsp of tumeric - it was gone within an hour .

Made this dish exactly as the recipe calls for and they were a big hit. Many people said they were better then the BBQ ribs which were the main dish at our party.  I will absolutely make these again!

Great recipe. I tripled the recipe for a church picnic. I will definitely make again. I replaced 1 - 28 oz can of beans with 1 15.5 can of black and one 15.5 can of kidney beans and drained all the beans.  Next time if the canned beans have sugar I would omit adding any sugar; I used turkey bacon to make it a tad more healthy.

I think it would be very good over brown rice.
