This is delicious!  I roasted my pepper over the gas burner until it was charred, then put it right into a sandwich bag while it was still hot...the steam makes it very simple to just wipe off the skin.  I've found that the more 'stuff' you use in the quesadilla, the better!

These were pretty good but needed a little something more.  I made up some sour cream and dill mixture for the side and also added some shreddec cheddar to a couple of them to add more flavor.

Wow,this was surprisingly great!  I added the tiniest sprinkle of cheddar cheese for added flavor, and served them with sante fe caesar salad.  I cooked the quesadillas on my George Foreman grill for 6 minutes and they were perfect.

This was a really good recipe - have already used it twice.  Substituted goat cheese for the cream cheese both times and cooked the peppers a little before adding them to the quesadilla the second time.  Very simple but very flavorful.  Great with black bean soup!

I REALLY loved this recipe!  The wonderful thing about this recipe is it opens up a wide variety of different items to grill in tortilla wraps on the grill.  The original was a big hit.

As written this is pretty bland; yes, the peppers are flavorful but the cream cheese adds nothing to the flavor or the texture.  Next time, I will ditch the cream cheese and use either Montery Jack/ Colby cheese or cheddard instead and serve with a mango salsa or pepper salsa on top.

I had high hopes for this as I love mangos but was very disappointed. The Quesadillas didn't have very much flavour. I added a little cheddar cheese to a couple of them and they did have a slightly better flavour. Prefer CHEESY TORTILLAS from this site.

there is such thing as "hatch chile season" here in texas.  i'll put them in everything, but they really found their home in this recipe.  this is beautiful as is, but it's also easy to play around with.

This is a delicious recipe!!!  I sauteed the peppers until slightly blackened.  I served the quesadillas with salsa verde and they were a huge hit!

I wasn't paying attention and just "figured" the pablano was supposed to be charred then skin removed, so that's what I did over my gas stove burner.  I recommend it, yummy!  Get as much filling as you can in there cause it's good stuff!  Thanks for the great quesadillas!

I found this rather bland.  Next time, I will add fresh jalepenos, red onion and cilantro.  I think those additions will spice it up perfectly.

YUM!!!  I can't believe my husband ate a "vegetarian" dinner...  He loved this and said it's a "keeper" which, for something without meat is a miracle.  I added some shredded monterey jack.  I also made a salad w/ tortilla strips and the Casa dressing from this site. Definitely will be making this again!!!

This is a great idea for a recipe.  I served this with Swan's Summer Soup from this site, and it was a delicious dinner.  I only rated this 4 stars becasue the poblano pepper was not spicy enough for my family's taste.  The next time I make this I will look for a spicier pepper to use, and also include either some blackened chicken or blackened shrimp.  Overall though, a great recipe that we will try again. Thanks!

I added some diced grilled chicken and a touch of shredded mexican blend cheese and it was wonderful!  Great as a main dish or starter.

these are really good. We don't have a grill, so we used a skillet on high heat to brown the tortillas after we filled them. This was quick, easy and pretty healthy! (Where did the protein in the nutrition facts come from?!)

This was very good I liked how the sweetness of the mango blended so well with the creamcheese and poblano pepper. I also grilled my peppers and removed the skin. Will make again!

Just wanted to thank you for this posting. I was kind of looking for something new and also to use up what I had in the house. I decided to use what I had in the house so, I used green Spinach/Cilantro wraps(tortillas), some cream cheese and mozzarella sticks I had, several small red,yellow, orange pepper, and some mango cubes. It was a great combo and I was so glad to use up all these from the fridge. Thanks for the inspiration. I still do intend to make as directed when I purchase some poblanos, might use the goat cheese as someone suggested.

I was disappointed with this recipe.  It may have been the mango we had, but I really didn't feel like these had very much flavor to them.  After grilling up a test quesadilla, I added colby jack cheese and a dash of lime juice but we still didn't end up with a good taste.  Two of my kids took one and bite and opted to go without dinner rather than eating more.  My other son and I ate ours (after slathering with salsa).  Hubby didn't finish his either.  We won't be making these again unless I can seriously alter the flavors.

It's just a point of personal preference, but this recipe is much better when the poblano pepper is grilled before placed into the quesadilla. The flavor combo of the poblano pepper and mango is amazing.

Great easy recipe!  It was a huge hit at last night's potluck.  I followed the recipe with the exception of adding 1/2 a jalapeno. I'm a chile nut, so next time i will kick it up and only just jalapenos.  mmmm mmm yummy.

great idea, but I did feel that it needed something for a bit more flavor. I love the spicy/sweet combo, maybe next time I make this I'll mix some taco seasoning in with the cream cheese for a bit of a kick.  Thanks for sharing!

While the combination of the ingredients wasn't bad, I also added some shrimp into the mix, they were messy as all get out!  When I type messy what I mean to say is, it was as though my tortillas were a dam and the stuffing just plowed through and around the tortilla dam, and flooded all nearby villages (the plate, the other pieces of quesadilla, and my fingers)!!  And I didn't even use the amount suggested for the cream cheese (I used less!!).  Soooo, I'll probably tackle these for another day, and maybe add a different filler or mix the cream cheese with something to thicken it a bit.

I added some crab to the mix and stuffed into portabella mushroom caps and baked for 12 min at 400 degrees and there turned out so amazing.  We splashed on a bit of hot sauce and it was a mouthful of love

Wow! I like mangoes but have never found a favorite way to eat them.  This is it.  We made them just as the recipe described.

Very good combination although I like this recipe better with brie instead of cream cheese.  Also try adding a bit of chopped fresh cilantro.  Yummy!

Awesome!  One of my favorites.  Thank you for sharing this great recipe.  I have also made this in the oven.  I bake at 350 for 5 minutes and then put it under the broiler until the tortillas just started to brown.  Excellent.

I switched the cream cheese for goat cheese too. My girlfriend really didnt expect to like it and i had reservations myself since it sounded, as she put it, "weird". We were both suprised and loved it. I will definatly make it again. I used it as a side dish along with some chipotle chicken and rice. She wasnt sold on the mango so i made one without the mango in it for her and she ended up using the leftover mango as a dip for it.

Tried it as written, it was very very bland. Added shredded 'mexican cheese mix" and some cooked sausage for second tortilla and it was much more flavorful. There could be many variations, adding in flavorful ingredients to your taste.

This recipe required quite a few modifications. I used an avocado cream cheese mixture; sauteed red onions, poblanos, and garlic; and I topped the whole thing with hot pepper relish.

This was good. I followed other reviewers and added shredded monteray jack. The husban also liked it considering it did not have meat. Would
make again.

I made this with pita bread and left out the butter and made it in the toaster oven.  Everyone loved the flavors.  It was a big hit.
