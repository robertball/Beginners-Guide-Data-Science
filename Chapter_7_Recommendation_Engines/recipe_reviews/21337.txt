I used dried apricots and apple cider.  I added the cider before cooking as I didn't read the recipe carefully enough. My husband really liked this and he usually complains about having fruit in his meat. I also thought this was a fairly healthy dinner as it didn't contain alot of processed ingredients.

I used orange juice instead of apple, dried apricots instead of fresh and I doubled the cranberries and ham. We liked it pretty well. Next time I think I'll dice the apples and add less honey.

This is just a fruit pudding with ham in it and tastes really not very nice, sorry!
