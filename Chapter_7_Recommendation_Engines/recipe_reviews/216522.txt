First, I grew up with marshmallowy/syrupy sweet potato casseroles and hated them; my palate is far more savory. You can maximize this recipe per your tastes; I did 2 versions tonight.  1st: the "sweet" version with syrup: can't afford pure maple syrup and don't like it. Used the store-brand stuff, reduced it to a near toffee consistency, then added the roasted swt. pot. and onions and bacon. The result was like taffy....chewy, sweet, and beyond flavorful.  The 2nd version I did simply omitted the syrup: just the baked swt. pot., smoked bacon and carmelized onions. You know what MAKES this recipe? the thyme. I didn't have fresh; used ground I had on hand (a probable amount and then some) and it gave a wonderful punch and savory=ness to the taste. A great balance to the sweet. (Do add s/p to taste)

This is my first review after a year using various recipes on this site.  This dish is delicious.  I served it for a post Christmas large family gathering.  I was tired of the same old sweet potato casserole.  This is an amaaazing blend of sweet and savory, southern sweet potato and northern maple flavor.  You will get so many compliments.  I had at least 3 people at the party tell me this dish was their favorite.  Do not change a thing.

It was super tasty, love how all the flavors joined together. Next time, going to turn down the temp on the potatoes when they are roasting, came out slightly burnt. Definetly going to serve this at Christmas dinner.

This was absolutely delicious! I could have eaten all four portions that I made by myself. It's going to become a standby side here in my house.  I modified this recipe to cut the calories by 180 per serving (just 107 calories a serving) and cut the fat by 6 g per serving.  Changes I Made:  For four people I used 1/2 lb sweet potatoes, 1/2 lb baby carrots, 1/2 a large onion, 1-1/2 slices of center cut bacon, only 1 tsp of olive oil (more than enough), and 2 T of lite syrup, plus 3/4 tsp thyme. I skipped the salt entirely because of the bacon and added plenty of black pepper.

Great recipe to accompany ham or poultry. Did not have bacon, so substituted diced proscuitto added to onions about 5 minutes before they finished cooking. Since I did not have the bacon grease, I used a tablespoon of olive oil to saute the onions. Used a combination of 0.75 cup of the pure maple syrup and 0.5 cup diced canned pineapple and reduced that to half volume. The thyme was not something I thought I would like, but it definitely works well here. I used 0.5 teaspoon of dry thyme. Another great surprise was how good the potatoes tasted after the roasting, before adding the glaze. Served it to 12 picky  women and they all want the recipe!

Excellent!  We made this for Thanksgiving. I made the night before to be as prepared as possible for dinner.  Warmed in over after the turkey came out and microwaved the sauce.  A nice time saver for this yummy dish.

I found this looking for some twists on traditional holiday fare and was a little nervous serving it for the first time on Christmas....but it was a huge hit! My husband said to not hold this one out for another holiday, so I am making it tonight for a family birthday celebration!

I'm a huge fan of all of the ingredients included in this recipe, so I thought I would really enjoy this dish.  Once I made it, though, it was such a strange combination and I really didn't like the flavor.  My husband and I both agree that we probably won't be making this again.

Absolutely cant go wrong with this side dish! The combination is very nice. I ended up using about 1 tsp dried thyme, and 2 small red onions thinly sliced. I also cut down the roasting time to 30-35 minutes. Since I made this a day ahead of time I wanted the reheat time not not get them all mushy and over cooked. Never again will I for myself to eat the marshmallow topped goop from a can! I will definitely be making this again!

I made this for Christmas and it was my favorite dish of the evening!  I was out of bacon and had vegetarians as guests anyway, so I made this without the bacon and it was still heavenly.  The I used a lot of pepper before baking on both sides of the potatoes.  The onion and syrup made a nice contrast.  I will make this again for sure!

THIS WAS AMAZING!! Hands down, the best sweet potatoes I have ever had!!! Only thing I would change is; maybe use half the amount of thyme the recipe calls for. I will always use this recipe in the future!!!

Hey vegetarians and sweet potato haters, listen up! I haven't made sweet potatoes on 5 years because they gross my dear husband out. Not this time. We made with half honey half maple syrup and NO BACON...loved it! Just sauté onions in a little olive oil and make sure to add sea salt before roasting and thyme afterward - it truly makes the dish. Next time may add roasted pecans or slivered almonds for a little crunch!

Hands down best yam (sweet potato) dish ever. Usually most take an obligatory glob of gooey sweetness, but this year my guests clamored for seconds and raved about the savory flavor. I will make this every year!

This was the surprise winner of our Holiday menu. Even mom, not too crazy about sweet dishes, has requested we make this again. This is absolutely a keeper.

This recipe sounded really tasty, but i wasn't ready for the deliciousness! Simple, fragrant, elegant and a wonderful medley of sweet and savory. My entire family enjoyed this dish as part of my holiday dinner. I wasn't able to find fresh thyme, but it was still delightful using the dried thyme.

Simply awesome!  I used red onions for some color, but other than that followed the recipe exactly! I probably will decrease the amount of pure maple syrup since it was a bit sweeter than necessary and little runnier than I'd like.  This is a keeper for holidays and special occasions! If you have to hold it for a length of time, there's no problem-flavors seem to marry and just get better!

This has become a "must have" dish with my dinner group and renamed Sweet Potato Crack.  I've learned I can prepare most of it earlier in the day (roast potatoes, fry bacon, caramelize onions)waiting to combine and heat through right before serving.

I made these for Thanksgiving dinner, and they were a hit! I left out the bacon because I didn't have any, and made them in a slow cooker, but otherwise followed the recipe. While they were cooking, the Thyme smelled really strong, and I was afraid the flavor would be too intense, but it wasn't at all. I will definitely be making them again!

This is my go to sweet potato dish for Thanksgiving. We’re talkin’ 10 years in a row with a gang of over 20 people! EVERYONE loves it. I double the bacon, cause I like bacon! Perfect blend of savoury and sweet.

OMG.  This could possibly be my new favorite holiday and non-holiday dish. I am not a fan of the cloyingly sweet marshmallow-topped-syrupy goo sometimes served on Thanksgiving.  This recipe does the trick. Roasting the potatoes first gives them flavor. But adding carmelized onions and bacon goes over the flavor top in a spectacular way.  I went easy on the maple syrup (perhaps a quarter of what it called for), and will do that again.

This was phenomenal!  I sized it way down as I was the only one home tonight - now I wish I'd made the full amount.  I barely touched my main meal so I could eat ALL of this.  No changes were made and none were needed.  Outstanding recipe!

I just made these as a pre-Thanksgiving test.  OMG, they were out of this world. I didn't realize until I had already starting cooking that I didn't have bacon. I can't imagine how crazy good the will be with that addition. This will be on my Thanksgiving table for sure.

We really enjoyed this recipe. I only had dried thyme so I used 1 tsp. and it was great but will try to have fresh on hand the next time  I make it.... And I will make it again! Thanks for a great dish!

I am not a fan of sweet potatoes, so I was skeptical if I would enjoy this. It was delicious! Everyone at my Thanksgiving table loved it and has asked for a repeat for Christmas dinner!

A good recipe for sweet potatoes. I think they are sweet enough as it is, so I leave out the maple syrup. The result is similar to turkey dressing. My family ate twice as much sweet potato as usual using this recipe.

OMG!!!  What a great way to have Sweet Potatoes! These were brought to my house for Thanksgiving and were quite the "hit."  I found your recipe and have recently prepared them for dinner guests. Again, a "hit!"  This recipe is a real keeper.

I wanted to make sweet potatoes for Thanksgiving dinner, but I wanted to do something different from the usual sweet potato pie, so I gave this recipe a try. I made it exactly as the recipe said, and it came out fantastic. A good friend of mine told me, after dinner, that if he ever found out I stopped making this dish, he would never forgive me. (Though, as another reviewer pointed out, the temp is a bit high. Next time, I'll turn the oven down a little.)

So good, everyone loved it at our Thanksgiving dinner.  Really liked the flavor combo of maple, caramelized onion, bacon and thyme.  Of course everything is always better with bacon, can't go wrong with this recipe!

To die for!!!   We loved this recipe, will definately make it again.   I didn't have an hour to cook so I started by cooking the potatoes in the microwave to soften them.

These are fabulous. Great way to get away from my normal sweet potato dishes. I loved the salty smokey flavor of the bacon and the onions were a great addition. I will make these again! Thanks for the recipe.

I've made this for Thanksgiving three years in a row now and it's perfect. It's an absolute go-to that I look forward to fixing. As some have said, the fresh thyme is crucial and is what takes this to the next level.

Wanted a change from mashed potatoes for Thanksgiving this year. Ten relatives from 3 to 63 all loved it.  Used real maple syrup.  Cant't think of any changes we would make.

I pureed these instead of roasting them and used bacon bits instead of sliced bacon.  I thought it was really good, but a whole bag of bacon bits was not enough and I have a feeling 5 slices of bacon would not have been nearly enough either.  This would be good without the maple syrup, for those on a low sugar diet.

I read several reviews that said they had made this without the maple syrup. So I made half a recipe with and half without.  My company was split on which way they liked it best but they definitely liked it!

This dish is very tasty and it's such a nice change.   The right balance of sweet and savory, but still allowing the flavor of the sweet potato to shine through.    
  We cut back on the onions slightly.  Also, rather than add the potatoes and bacon/onion mixture back into the skillet to coat it with the glaze, I just pour the glaze into the bowl that the mixture was in.  I gently mixed everything together and then transferred everything to a crock pot to keep the food warm.   Next time, however, I will cut then onions into thin strips  instead of the thin rings.    It should allow the onions to separate a little easier rather than end up as clumps of onion next to the potato cubes.

I followed the recipe as written. I found that I was unable to reduce the syrup to half as specified in the recipe. I cooked it as directed but it did not reduce so I tried cooking a little longer. It still did not reduce. I finally used it as is. Next time I would use less because most of it just ended up sitting in the bottom of the bowl, a waste of expensive syrup.  I also found the long pieces of sliced onion which ended up looking stringy unattractive. Next time I would thinly slice them and then cut them into shorter pieces so that they mixed better with the potato pieces.  Overall good taste but some flaws in the instructions.

I was looking for an alternative to the syrupy sweet traditional sweet potato casserole and thought this would be it. If you are looking for a very sweet dish, this is it. If you are looking for a non-sweet or “slightly” sweet dish, omit the maple syrup all together. If I make this dish again, I will skip the maple syrup completely. As written, this dish is so sweet it’s more like a desert. Tasty, but not what I was looking for.

I only used 3/4 of a pound of onions because a full pound just seemed like so many. Next time I make it I will add the full pound because they cooked down really far and were delicious.

The flavor of thyme was very strong.  I would likely cut it back by half.  Other than that it was delicious.  My potatoes came out caramelized and crispy on the outside.

This was delicious and a perfect side dish to salmon. I've used one sweet potato for my chunks and other pieces to make it for 2 servings. I did have trouble with my syrup since it got too thick. But I did add an extra amount to make up for the glaze. It's so good I would make it again.

I made smaller amount and estimated ingredients as I didn't measure.  I used pure Michigan maple syrup and vidalia onion.  Will make this again.

This was delicious. I didn’t have real maple syrup which would make it ever better but Mrs Butterworth made this pretty good too. I also didn’t have any thyme so I improvised with basil and oregano. Next time I make this I’ll make sure to get the sweet potatoes cooked until they are quite browned and crispy. This will make them even better. I would recommend this dish for a special meal or like we had it. With a bbq’ed pork chop regular weekday meal. Yummy.

I made this for Thanksgiving.  It was super easy and delicious. I was I worried the maple would make this dish too sweet but it was perfect. The onions helped balance the sweet and savory. I left out the bacon and it was still great.  I will be making this again for sure!

The recipe might actually not be bad, but I just don't care much for the texture of the sweet potato.

This is one of my favorite ways to have sweet potatoes. I just used regular maple syrup instead of pure maple syrup and it was great. Have already made it a few times and plan to make plenty more in future.

Good but a little on the work intensive side and next time will cut down on the thyme. I will make it again.
