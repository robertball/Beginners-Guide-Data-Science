Did not feel it needed the extra rice. The tortilla was filling enough.  I made it in the saut√© mode if the instant pot. Then just let it sit on warm until dinner. 3hrs or so.  I had school so the family had a ready to eat hot dinner.  I will definitely make this again.

This is an amazing recipe. I made jalapeno zucchini boats to go with it, oh my, I  won't go out for fajitas again. I give this one 5 stars!!!
