This cookie cake turned out great for me! I made it for my sisters birthday and read many reviews before doing so. Many reviewers said that the cookie came out bland, so i added 1 and a half tsp of cinnamon, half a tsp of ground cloves and 1/4 of a teaspoon of nutmeg. (im assuming instead of those 3, allspice would give the same effect as well). I really recommend doing that. I also added some molasses about 1/4-1/2 a tsp. The cookie cake turned out flavorful and soft on the inside yet firm on the outside. PERFECTION! The spices gave it a ginger spice cookie-esk taste but it worked well. I also added chocolate chips and used butter cream frosting. THANKS FOR THE RECIPE! :)

This recipe is just great!!  I just followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect.  I added small pieces of dark chocolate to the top.  I also used my hands to mix the batter, it works much better, and floured my hands to spread it on the pan so the batter didn't stick to my hands.  You won't be sorry if you try this cookie!

This cookie was very easy and tasted great!!  My children and I made it for Daddy for Father's day.  It wasn't as big as I thought it would be.  I used my 13 inch baking stone, and the cookie didn't cover it.  Next time I might double the recipe.  That's the only thing I would change.

I substituted applesauce for the butter and pressed dark chocolate chips and chopped pecans into the dough before cooking. It was really good and kids and husband loved it. I had tried it with butter the first time I cooked it and have progressively lessened the amount of butter until I completely eliminated it.  The family didn't even notice.

Great recipe.  I doubled the recipe and spread the batter in a 13 inch (throw away) aluminum foil pizza pan.  I decorated it with icing for My daughter's birthday and sent it to school.  Young children aren't always fond of cake in school.  But they always love chocolate chip cookies!  The teacher told me that it was alot less mess for her too.  Great recipe.  ** Update, this pizza pan cookie isn't really something I'd take to work...  it really is just "good kid food."

This recipe is great.  I added 2 tsps. of cinnamon.  Very easy and quick.  I will definitely make it again.  If you flour your hands, it is easier to pat out the dough in the pan.

I made cookies instead of a cookie cake.  They were good and soft! And even better with cinnamon.  The recipe only made about 16 cookies, which I thought was a much smaller batch than normal.  The 1 to 1 ratio of oatmeal and flower really gives it the right consistency.

ok..a little bland I think it needs a little cinnamon/cloves/nutmeg and salt. 

I made it with 1/2 light butter and splenda for the white sugar, which made it turn out more like a muffin/bread like texture rather than a crispy moist cookie. Still good tho.

I give this cookie a 3 for texture, but the taste was kind of on the bland side.I didn't have a pizza pan, but wanted something sweet,(like, if I don't get something sweet right now, I'm going to go nuts kinda day) so I took this recipe and made normal cookies. They tasted like they were missing something. I added raisons to them, but it didn't help. The mixture was actually sweeter before I baked it.

I doubled this recipe to fill my pan and make the cookie a little thicker. Otherwise I followed this recipe exactly and it was the best oatmeal raisin cookie I 've ever made.

My kids loved this.  My youngest who usually hates anything with oatmeal in it begged me to make this a second time!!   (I made it in a springform pan and added chocolate and white chips.  I had to increase the baking time by a few minutes. )  Easy and delicious!

This recipe is ok but with a few tiny changes goes from 3 stars to 5 stars!!!  I added a dash of cinnamon, a 1/4 tsp salt (this was the key), and used milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet. I made this two nights ago as listed and it was ok. I made last night with minor tweaks and it was so yummy!  It's also the perfect size for a sweet treat for our family.

This was very good. I read the reviews beforehand and decided to add 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon to my batter so it wouldn't be bland. I didn't want a ton of spice and 1/2 tsp. turned out well for me. This recipe did not fill my pizza pan, which was fine in this case because I was not feeding a whole lot of people. I would definitely double the recipe if I was feeding more than a few people. I thought this had good texture (edges crispy, middle soft- so you can please everyone depending on the texture of cookie they like!) I will be making again soon!
