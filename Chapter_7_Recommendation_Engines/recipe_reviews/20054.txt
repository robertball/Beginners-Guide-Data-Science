Yuck!  I hated this and my asparagus-loving mother didn't enjoy this either.  The directions are totally off.  I bought a 20 oz. loaf of bread and used the entire thing to wrap each piece of asparagus.  I baked these from the frozen state.  There is NO way these could brown in 10 minutes.  I had to up the temp. to 400 and bake an additional 7 minutes for a total of 17 minutes in the oven.  There was WAY too much filling which made it impossible to slice so I had to serve them whole.  I threw most of the wraps away.

Served them last night.  They were a hit. I served them whole. However, they were not baked in 10 minutes.  I turned the oven up and added an additional 5 minutes to the bake time - They were still not browned to my satisfaction, so will play with the baking - Maybe put them under the broiler for a couple of minutes.

My friend has made these for parties for several years and they disappear quickly. I suggest you just mix the spread and use as much bread as needed. Yum...wish I had some right now.

This is a great recipe, which I have been making for a good forty years. I melt the butter, and after rolling the asparagus rolls, I roll them in melted butter and place them on a cookie sheet in the freezer (or whatever you have that will fit). I freeze them for an hour or so, then cut into bite size pieces (4-5 per roll). Wrap them up, bag or "seal" and place in the freezer. Take them out, as many as you need and bake.(You can also , after rolling in the butter, roll them in sesame seeds. The seeds will toast , when baked.)

I used fresh asparagus, blanched, used about half of the blue cheese called for and wrapped in three sheets of phyllo dough, lightly brushing with butter between each layer then cut to 'fit' with a pizza cutter.  Cooked them at 375 for 15 minutes.  Quite good!!

Great taste! Used fresh, slightly steamed, asparagus. Also, did a test run on two of them by baking whole vs. pre-cut. I did need an additional 5 minutes baking time and the whole ones were difficult to cut after baking (too gooey and the soft, stringiness of the asparagus was hard to cut through) so I would also recommend pre-cutting prior to baking. Wondering if I could do something similar with apples and gouda or figs and brie... Any suggestions?

This is a wonderful blend of flavors.  My only tip is to cut the rolls into pieces before baking!

I made this as a second course of a five course meal. I used fresh asparagus spears. I would recommend going easy on the butter. Two full sized spears were enough for each person, but if you have fewer courses, plan on three or four. I used low fat cream cheese and also steamed the asparagus for a short time first. They were not fully frozen before cooking, but I still needed a little more cooking time. Delicious!!

I tried these at my mother-in-law's. I just love them - and had to get the recipe. This recipe is the same as her's, only her recipe does say to slice them first, before baking.  A wonderful combination, and I generally don't like blue cheese!

I didn't like these very much. The flavors were flat, and they became soggy quickly.

This recipe is great EXCEPT the way I have had it is with boiled lasagna noodles instead of bread! I think this way with the bread wuld be disgusting. Try the lasagna noodles instead!

I really liked the taste combination on this recipe. I agree with the additional baking time and pre-cutting while frozen - that made it much easier. I do think I am going to chop the
asparagus to add a little more of that flavor. But overall yummy and am looking forward to serving it over the holidays! Thanks!!
  p.s. I did try the chopped asparagus and LOVED it and so did my company over the holidays. Thx again!

I have had this recipe for years. I never liked asparagus til I tasted these. The only thing I do different is to use canned asparagus drained on papertowel.

My best friend used to make these and everyone loved them.  She passed away several years ago and I didn't have the recipe. I've tried to find this recipe ever since then.  Thank you for sharing this.

These are tasty. But... they are for people who don't like asparagus. The asparagus is completely unnoticable in these. I liked them because of the blue cheese and because they were fun to make and tasty, but I happen to love asparagus, and I couldn't even tell it was in there.

this was an excellent recipe.  I made this for the superbowl and doubled the recipe. I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the next time i would use a little more asparagus ad a little less of the blue cheese spread.

I made these for a bridal shower and everyone enjoyed them.  My only suggestion is that the asparagus came out in one long strand when we bit into them, so when I make it again I will probably cut the asparagus in half, perhaps even thirds, and roll them the same, with just the tips showing out either end.  That way when guests bite into them they won't pull out a long strand of asparagus from the wrap like a long spaghetti noodle.  And just to note, I did blanch the asparagus prior to wrapping, so that was not the issue.  But the flavor was delicious and they were all eaten during our party.

I made this ahead for a big party. Easy to do ahead which is a must for me.  It is wonderful but rich.  Next time may use a grain bread. Think the texture would be interesting.

My young niece says this is her favorite thing I make.  I thought she would say some dessert when I asked but she said this.  It is easy to have in the freezer and bake when needed. I use fresh asparagus.

DO NOT flatten the bread! Wrap, then cut in bite sized pieces, dip in melted butter, freeze on cookie sheet and then bag them after they're frozen.

Mine didn't turn out so good. It tasted good but looked bad. The bread wasn't big enough and the spears  were hanging out. I cut them after baking but the bread didn't adhere very well. Next time I will try crescent roll dough and cut the frozen spear in half.
