I did a search for Cinnamon Pie after watching the Dual Spires episode of Psych... This is the only recipe that even popped up under allrecipes for a cinnamon Pie.  This recipe Extremely Easy to make... like extremely easy... which is a good thing for me. A lot of times recipes like this are way too complicated... This took about 15 minutes to prepare with the kids getting in the way and 45 min to bake and about an hour to cool at room tempature.    Mine didn't really look like the picture though.. I know some people said it looks 'ugly' beucase of the color, yes, it is ugly, but to me it looks like a pumpkin pie just a little on the darker side.  If you like cinnamon you will like this... and if you are not a HUGE cinnamon fan.. I still think you might like it.. I am not huge on cinnamon, but I will definately make this again.

Its not very often that i write reviews to recipes but i just had to this time. this pie was GREAT. When you make it, the "batter" will be very thin almost like milkey. and when you take it out of the oven it will giggle. Just let it cool for 30 minutes, Don't worry though. it will be great. And for the crust i recomend using the "buttery crunch crust" recipe on this site. It went GREAT together. Try this, it is awsome with a cup of coffee the next morning.

The filling is a very thin liquid before you bake it but when its done and cooled it becomes more of a cinnamon custard. Its a very ugly pie to look at because the surface of the pie develops into a brownish crust but it is verrrrrry tasty especially with whipped cream. Make it for taste and not for looks!

I was so excited about finding this pie, but after reading the reviews I got a little worried about the texture of the pie, so I made a few adjustments: I added an egg and an extra teaspoon of cinnamon, I subbed the milk in recipe for a 12oz can evaporated milk, and for a little something extra I sprinkled some Hershey's cinnamon chips on the bottom before I ladeled in the filling. The pie was absolutely delicious!! It had the perfect custard texture that I was hoping for.

This is my favorite pie of all time although I have not used this particular recipe yet , but I can tell by looking that it will turn out exactly as its supposed to . I grew up with these . For those who don't know ,its merely a slightly different(& less expensive :) version of what , in this area, is called "Sugar Cream Pie " . If you look up that one you'll see what I mean . Its often made with a dusting of nutmeg on top , although I prefer cinnamon. Around here , its not an oddity , its a classic , often found on restaurant menus & well worth a try , but be warned , its wonderfully rich !

The flavor of this recipe was great but the consistency was a little weird. When I took it out of the oven after an hour I didn't think it was anywhere near done but it was perfect after sitting on a cooling rack for an hour or so. As other reviewers suggested, I used the Buttery Crunch Crust recipe from this site. The recipes complimented each other very well.

I tried this after watching the Dual Spires episode of Psych, and wasn't sure what to expect.  This is a nice homey type pie.  Nothing fancy or exotic, but comfortably delicious.

This pie was very easy to make. Yes, after I took it out of the oven, it did take a little while to "set". It was like a custard. Was very good with coffee ice cream! I'll definately make this again!

I thought this was pretty good.  The texture is a little carmelized on top and underneath it's like a pecan pie texture without the nuts.  It is very nice with a good flavor.  A snap to put together as well.

This pie tasted good, but not quite great.  It wasn't as thin as I expected from the description, which was nice.  My husband liked it and that's saying a lot.  I prefered this pie warm and fresh.  It seemed to lose a bit of flavor the next day.  Also, if the filling bubbles over the crust edge a bit, it WILL carmelize, making it difficult to get out of the pan once it has cooled.

I followed the recipe exact, only using evaporated milk in place of the regular milk called for in this recipe. I used the Butter Flaky Pie Crust from this site. I'm glad I read through the reviews before I made this, they were correct--the batter was REALLY thin. But, after it cooled, it was perfect. Very, VERY good. We had this with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top and it was.......sinful. GREAT on-hand ingredient dessert, not to mention quick.

Very tasty, and very easy.  I too was brought here after being Psych-inspired.  This pie as great.  Alterations I made were:  used 1/2 cup of heavy cream in place of 1/2 cup of milk, used brown sugar instead of white, and added a tsp of cinnamon.  Next time I will likely add even more cinnamon - but I am a huge cinnamon fan.  Other reviewers have commented that this pie is kind of ugly, and I'll admit that it's not the most attractive dessert that I've ever made, or eaten, but the taste more than makes up for it.  Overall I love this recipe!

This is a really great pie.  I did not even know about cinnamon pie until I watch the episode of Duel Spires on Psych and looked it up.  It is now my favorite pie.  So yummy with whipped cream.  I modified mine a little with two eggs instead of one and halfed the milk with condensed milk for a custudy feel.

This was very good and everyone in my family enjoyed it. I did not have to bake this as long, maybe because I used a tad more flour. Also added approx. 1/2 teaspoon more cinnamon and thought that was perfect. Per other reviews/suggestions, I used the Buttery Crunch Crust and this worked out very well. I will make this again, probably closer to Thanksgiving/Christmas. Thanks for sharing!

Very tasty. Just made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. Smelled heavenly while baking. I also tried it with the buttery crunch crust and that was a great combination. This recipe is a keeper!

I've made this awesome pie a few times..this recipe is a keeper! Last time, I changed it up by adding thinly sliced apples first then pouring the cinnamon(1/2 c less milk)mixture over.The family loved it even more.

I made this for company and it was good, but overall it was not what I expected.  The flavor was tasty, but the consistency was not what I thought it would be.  I used skim milk because the recipe didn't specify, but I think it could have been better if I used whole milk.

Wow, this was great!  First time for cinnamon pie and I loved it!  It's amazing how 1 t. of cinnamon can flavor so much pie.  Crazy!  It really tastes best cooled.  Otherwise the texture is can be soupy.  I used my 10" fiestaware pie pan and it could have handled another 50%.  Next time I'll increase the filling.  And there will be a next time!   Yum!  *Update* My husband said, "This is one of the best pies that I've ever eaten."  Keeper!

Delicious!! I baked this for my family, and it was GREAT! A definite must-have. It is a little bit sweet for adults, but kids love it! Don't get scared if it's EXTREMELY watery at first..It turns out great in the end!! :)

I was horrified when I saw the ugly mess I made is the pie shell..almost angry when I saw the thin grey ooze baking in the oven. But I waited it out. And OH MY GOODNESS I'm glad I did!! After it cooled in the fridge it settled into the most wonderful layered custard pie.. we all couldn't get enough of it!! In fact my family fought over the last piece!! Definitely a keeper!!! Dont be scaed of it guys and gals.. it'll all work out!

This was much better than expected. The filling is VERY thin when it is first mixed up, but cooks very nicely. It took mine quite a while to cool and firm up once out of the oven, but it was delicious!

This was good ... not the greatest pie in the world, but it gets kudos for simplicity and for the gact that this is a good pie to throw together at the last minute to make something special.  I love cinnamon, and this is a great way to feature it.

I did not enjoy this at all.  I made exactly as directed, but used the "buttery crunch crust" that was suggested several times.  The texture was not appealing, and the flavor was not to my liking. The filling seemed to soak into the crust, and all that was left was the crunchy top layer. However, a couple members of my family did like the taste.  If I were to ever try this again, I would definately use a regular unbaked pie crust as the recipe states.

This recipe is good and turned out great but based on other reviews, I did make some changes. I used a 9 in. frozen pie crust, 1/2 cup liquid egg substitute, 3/4 cup sugar, 2 tsp. cinnamon, and 1 cup milk. If you love cinnamon, 1 tsp. will not be enough. Using less milk makes it not as runny and the extra egg makes it a little thicker. In my opinion, it was too sweet even with less sugar and next time I will use 1/2 cup sugar instead. I will also decrease the amount of butter by half as well. The frozen premade pie crust I used did fine and was not too soggy. I used the directions for baking it and it was jiggly when I got it out but it firmed up soon after. It's a thin pie but still delicious.

Like several other reviewers I first started looking for a recipe for cinnamon pie after watching the Psych episode with the Cinnamon Festival.  This was a very easy recipe to make and tastes excellent.  I used a little more cinnamon that called for and, as suggested, use a can of condensed milk instead of the regular milk called for.  I also used a ready made pie crust so it was very simple indeed.  I highly recommend this pie to everyone that likes cinnamon.

I am not a big pie person but I too wanted to try this after Psych. This pie was good. I made this twice, once following the recipe and once with a little variation. I got to say that the original recipe was a little flavorless and a little too runny for my taste. The second time I made it I added a 1/4 cup of brown sugar, one egg, 1 1/2 of cinnamon and 1 tbls of flour. I also reduced the milk to 1 1/4 cup. This gave it a better taste and a texture similar to pumpkin pie. I did as others suggested and used the Buttery Crunch Crust recipe, and I would suggest leaving out the pecans with the original recipe because it seemed to overpower the taste of the cinnamon.

This was a soggy mess! I had to bake it for 4 hours, with 3 cups extra flour just to get it to start hardening! I also refridgerated it for several hour to no avail.

Delicious!  This is my new "go to" recipe.  Not only is this incredibly easy but I always have all the ingredients in my pantry/fridge and can throw it together in a pinch.  We serve it warm with whipped topping or ice cream.  It can easily be warmed in the microwave for a couple of days...If it lasts that long!  MUST TRY!

This pie was so easy and so very good. However it got very thin when it cooled. The second time I made it, I added a layer of sliced peaches. Serve with whipped cream or ice cream.

Made the recipe exactly as stated. It came out watery and curdled looking. I can usually find a way to save a recipe, even after it's cooked but not this one.

Very good flavor.  (If you like rice pudding).  It tastes very milky, and very cinnamony. Very rice pudding-y.  

The consistency leave a lot to be desired though.  For some reason my pie seemed to split into three seperate layers.  Bottom: a rather thick paste-like (flour) layer, Middle: a layer that looked like curdled milk, Top: and a brown cinnamon layer on top.  

I think it could use a little bit more thickening.  Maybe another egg, or possibly more flour.  I'm not sure, give me a couple more tries and i'll know.  All in all it was good, but not great.  

My pie still had not set after a day, so i poured out the liquid and ate what was left.

Easy pie made with pantry ingredients.  It was good the first day but from now on I will wait to serve it after it has been refrigerated.  It was much better.  It took awhile to set up after baking so don't be alarmed if it looks like it isn't done.

I was a little worried about the pie being runny after reading other reviews, so I added one egg and put in 2 TBSP flour instead of 1 1/2 and upped the cinnamon to 2 tsp.  I absolutely no problems making it.  I disagree with others, I like it better cold.  Last night it was good, but this morning it is amazing.  If you are a custard fan you will like this pie.

I find it interesting that there have been so many inconsistencies with this pie.  Mine turned out almost identical to the picture.  I didn't have all purpose flour, so I substituted Bisquick.  The pie turned out nice and firm.  I used a graham cracker crust instead of pie dough.  It was very sweet, but for me a bit bland.  Next time I think I might increase the cinnamon, decrease the sugar, and add chocolate chips.

We followed the recipe exactly and it came out pretty much as the previous reviews indicated.  We let it cool for over an hour before digging in and it had a thin custard consistentcy.  This is defintely an "old school" recipe that screams for a cup of coffee.  We will make it again with potentially an adjustment to thicken up the pie a bit but that's the only change we will make.

The taste was good, but it was very watery.  I followed the instructions to the T (except I added about 1/2 tsp more cinnamon), but the consistency was not very good.  I will try to find a new recipe for this.  I was going to take it to work for our office tomorrow, but I decided against it because of the way it set up (or lack of).

Delicious. I was paranoid that I had done something wrong because it was so jiggly even after having been in the oven so long, but it was the perfect consistency--jiggly is good!

I brought this over to my in-laws.  When we cut into it, it was extremely watery.  I'm the only one who actually ate it and thought it was okay taste wise.  But because of what it looked like no one else wanted to eat it.  I will not make this again.

Oh my God!  My hubby and I ate the whole pie before morning.  I wasn't sure I'd like it because I'm not a huge cinnamon fan but I knew he was.  Well, I think I liked it even more.  I'm drooling just thinking about it.  I highly suggest doubling everything to make two pies.

SO good! Had a different consistency than what I thought it was going to have-like thin custard-but tasted GREAT!  I followed the recipe exactly and the only problem I had was that my crust started burning a bit.  I used a store bought pre-made crust.  Not sure what you could do to fix that problem, but the taste of the filling made up for it!  My husband even liked it and he doesn't usually like things that have a custard consistenccy to them.  We ended up eating more than half the pie just between ourselves!  I will definitely make this again.

The pie did not turn out well.  The middle was mushy and I had to leave it in a lot longer than the recipe said.  The crust ended up being burnt and the middle still wasn't cooked enough.

This was an amazing pie. Even better with whipped cream. I really like cinnamon so I added an extra half tsp. as another user stated. Came out perfect. I wouldn't have thought of searching for this if it wasn't for Psych.

Great recipe! Like others, I went looking for this after the Psych episode and was not disappointed. I substituted brown sugar for white and used 2 tsp of cinnamon but otherwise, made it as the recipe was written. It made the house smell wonderful!! Thanks!

The flavor was totally there but the consistency was WAY off. Mine was kinda greasy, maybe the next time I try I will leave it in an extra 20 mins or so. I also wish it was thicker. At this thickness its more like cinnamon 'tart'... too bad because Psych totally has me craving this. I made it with the Rum-Spiked Horchata recipe on this site and the two are perfect together. I hope I can find someone who is good with pies for suggestions on how to make this more like what I was looking for.

I tried this recipe twice and made it just like the directions said. The first time it came out in a jelly texture, and the second time it came in the jelly texture AND it had separated into two distinct layers. Very disappointed in this recipe after reading all the rave reviews. FAIL.

There is nothing good about this recipe. It was runny to begin with and the suggestion of using a glass pie plate doesn't help this recipe at all. HOW ONE TEASPOON OF CINNAMON is supposed to make this a cinnamon pie, I'll never know. Sorry, but it tasted like nothing.

DELICIOUS.  I used the buttery crunch pie crust with it and that was lovely.  It was a little unsettling to see how loose the filling is when you get it mixed and there is a definite hour or so when it's out before it's set but well worth the wait.

I had never heard of cinnamon pie so decided I should give it a try.  What a perfect recipe. EVERYONE should try this....don't change a thing...it's perfect just the way it is written.  It is very easy to make and it is absolutely delicious.  As other reviewers suggested, I used the Buttery Crunch Crust recipe submitted by Sal on this site and it was perfect with it.  I am 82 years old and my husband said this was the best pie I have ever made.  This is a keeper!  Thanks for sharing this with us Sharon and "kudos" to your great-grandmother!

So yummy! My pie separated into three distinct layers. I used a whole wheat/nut crust. 1 cup Wheat flour, 1/2 c butter softened, 1/4 c chopped nuts, and 1/4 c brown sugar. Press all togther in the pie pan.

This was thin and milky on its way into the crust; and jiggly when it came out of the oven, but once it set it was a lovely custard. The top of the pie looks like the surface of the moon; not pretty but delicious. I used the Buttery Crunch Crust as other reviewers suggested.

A fantastic pie, but it still remained watery, even after cooling on a pie rack for over an hour. I think I'll cut the milk to a cup next time and see how it comes out.

This pie was "TO DIE FOR". My boyfriend ate almost the whole pie watching TV last night, and finished it for breakfast. The only change I made was I used 1 cup heavy wihpping cream and 1/2 cup whole milk because that was what I had in the house. Also topped it with more whipping cream (what diet?)Thanks Sharon for a great recipe!

My whole family loved it, but it wasn't the deep kind of pie that I like. I cannot be very objective. The taste was good, but the consistency was not the kind I was looking for.

Loved this recipe:)Was very easy to make.Mixture was thin so i was amazed at how it cooked up. Was great to eat an hour after it baked but tasted even better the next day after it had sat in the refigerator. A good choice if your looking for a "traditional" pie to serve at Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner:)

Whoever wrote this recipe did a heinous job.

It is never stated that this is a custard. Would have made a world of difference.
You do NOT mix everything together at the same time. Mixture can easily be over mixed causing it to separate. Butter needs to be cooled completely or it’ll start cooking the eggs and the eggs need to be mixed in last and slowly to prevent curdling.

I made this recipe twice now exactly as it’s written and it came out as disgusting curdled soggy slop; even after baking for an extra hour. I tried it with the homemade butter crunch crust and with a premade crust. I tried blind baking the shell first and tried unbaked but neither option helped. 

This recipe needs to be rewritten. Good luck to all other chefs and bakers!

This pie is dangerous, I could eat the whole thing myself! I just had to find a cinnamon pie recipe after watching an episode of Pysch and was pleased with this recipe. The pie does look a little weird but is amazing! I figured out a way to make it where it did not look so weird, but I forgot what I did (uh oh.) I did make slight adjustments: 3/4 c and sometimes 7/8 c of sugar, 2T flour, 1 c milk and I only use the deep dish pie crust.
Thank you, Sharon!

I also looked this up after watching the Psych episode! Haha! It was so worth it. The only thing I did different was add a bit extra cinnamon. I also recommend that if you're using a store bought shell (I know... shame on me!) be sure to use the deep dish. The regular crust is too shallow and mine way over filled! I took it to a Pie Night though and it was the first pie gone! I'm making another one right now because my husband was disappointed he only got one slice. ;)

This was amazing! We got the idea from Psych and had to try it. I used heavy cream instead of milk and 2tsp. of cinnamon. I also pre baked the pie crust. It wasn't ugly either.  I served it with some cool whip too. I plan to take it to my next event!

This is a holiday favorite in my family, served with a dollop of whipped cream. After watching Psych's Dual Spires episode with the cinnamon festival and the guys drooling over Cinnamon Pie, we had to try it! It is a light custard consistency and very tasty. Enjoy it!

This was my first experience baking a custard pie, so it was a learning process. To address some of the issues other negative reviewers had: before making this I researched and found that with custard pie, it's best to blind (pre) bake the crust, this prevents the sogginess. For a smoother custard, filling mixture should be blended just enough to combine the ingredients, but no more. I added the eggs second to last (just before the milk), after everything else had been well blended. I had two reasons I did this. Firstly,the butter was still warm from the melting process, so I wanted to make sure that it was cooled down enough that it would not begin to cook the egg prematurely. The second reason being that the egg would not be overly beaten. The texture turned out pretty good; mostly smooth overall. The flavor was okay. I did add a little more cinnamon than the recipe called for, but I still felt like it was kind of blah. I don't think I'll make this recipe again.

I love cinnamon pie and this is as close as I can find to what my aunt used to make but I don't believe she used an egg. Just milk, sugar, cinnamon and either flour or corn starch to thicken.

I enjoy unique recipes so I had to try this one.  Since the first pie, I've made this several times.  The last time I made it I thought I would have left-overs... yeah right! My three kiddos (8,7,5) finished the whole thing.  My 5 year old son "This is the best pie!" It's the best.  I will be making it for some curious family members at Thanksgiving.

The flavor of this unusual pie was excellent - delicate and delicious, but the texture was a bit gummy. As other reviewers mentioned, the Buttery Crunch Crust on this site goes wonderfully with this pie.

It looks like I'm the only one who had this boil over in the oven. After the first 10 minutes I heard something sizzling and then smelled the burning sugar, I opened the oven door to be greeted by a cloud of smoke. I turned the heat down to 300 for the rest of the 45 minutes and that seemed to stop it from boiling over anymore.If I try this again (and that's a BIG if) I'll start it off in a 375 degree oven and go down to 300 and watch it like a hawk. And I'd put the pie plate on top of a cookie sheet just in case. The taste was only so so when I tried it but after it sat awhile the taste improved some.

This pie has a good flavor - sweet and cinnamony. It is easy to prepare. I wouldn't give it a 5 because there is something a little odd about the texture and it isn't very attractive but if you like cinnamon it's worth a try - I'd classify it as an "everyday" pie.

This is delicious, easy, and you're almost sure to have everything you need without a trip to the store. My husband thinks it's "wonderful"!

As suggested, I made this with Sara's buttery crunch crust.  I used a little extra cinnamon in the pie, and garnished with Cool Whip sprinkled
with cinnamon.  Good...but have to say the crust
is what made the pie worthy of 5*.

Mmmmmmm...very good!  I made it for dessert on Valentine's Day, and my husband was thrilled.  It also smells divine while it's baking.
