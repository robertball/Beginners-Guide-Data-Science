This was great! I steamed up some cauliflower and stuck them in the casserole between the crescent rolls and poured all the soup and cheese over it. This way I was able to get the veggies in the casserole and it made it even heartier!!! I used all organic ingredients, just fyi. My husband loved it so much he kissed my hand, literally! lol

This is something that is requested often at my house. I usually cook my chicken in the crockpot all day and assemble the casserole at dinner time.  The chicken shreds incredibly easy cooking it this way. Our favorite veggies to eat with this dish is spinach, onions, and roasted red bell peppers, which I normally throw in the crockpot along with the chicken. I season my chicken with salt, pepper, garlic, and onion powder.  I also drain the broth from the chicken and veggies really well and add softened cream cheese before rolling the filling in the crescents. I bake the rolls without the soup so it's not so doughy then add the soup mixture and top with cheese with a few minutes under the broiler.  Sooo delicious.

Fantastic! I added steamed mixed veggies and with my food processor it shredded the chicken quick with little effort. I served on top of mashed potatoes and my hubs had thirds. I'd say that's a rating in its self!!

I loved it! The process of shredding the chicken was a little tedious but well worth the effort. The addition of the broccoli as mentioned in the by HotintheKitchen25 was a nice touch and rounded out the whole meal.

This was yummy. I make a similar dish but tried it is his way to see which I'd like best. I make mine pot-pie style...layer of crescents rolls on bottom of dish, then chicken and other ingredients, layer the top with crescent rolls. I don't shred the chicken but cut it in halves. My way provides a crunchier pastry. All a matter of preference though! Loved the spin on it.

YUM!! Will definitely make this again. I bought a pre-roasted chicken to save time and added a cup of frozen broccoli florets as suggested and it was just perfect!

I made this tonight and we loved it!!!!  I made it exactly as written.  To those who felt the shedding was a pain, I actually pounded the chicken breasts flat before I seasoned and put them in the pan...they shred very easily after that and also cook quite quickly maintaining a lot of the chicken's natural juices.  

Thanks so much Hotinthekitchen25 for a great comfort food meal for a cold night!!!!

I did make a package of peas on the side so that there were veggies for dinner!!!!  lol

Wow...my boyfriend has renamed this dish "Chicken Disaster-ole." We made this according to the directions, without adding broccoli or other veggies. The chicken was completely flavorless even though I tried to avoid this by simmering with vegetable broth and seasonings before shredding.  This makes more than 4 servings, holy cow who needs 1/2 can of crescent rolls per person! Also I didn't feel there was enough sauce, maybe add more milk? I love quick easy casseroles, but this is not one I will ever waste the ingredients to make again.

A family favorite for years and years.  I'm not sure when it was first posted, but it has been copied into a well-worn cookbook.  Use cream of mushroom or  chicken.  To make it even easier, buy a rotisserie chicken and cut it into small chunks (no need to dirty your food processor.  Stuff the crescents with your favorite cheese and the chicken.  Put your veggies (frozen/fresh - whatever you have on hand)  in the cream soup and heat separately.  I also add a few dashes of Weber roasted garlic and herb spice. I like to spray the crescent pan I use with a cooking spray for easier clean-up.  Place the stuffed rolls in the pan and place in the oven to get toasty brown.  Remove the pan and pour your soup /veggie mix over the crescents.  Place back into the oven until bubbly hot.

This was good, but it came out kind of doughy. I took it out at 40 minutes because the top was golden and bubbling. Next time I make this, I'm leaving it in longer.

This was a hit in my house.  I changed it up a bit.  I saut√©ed mushrooms and onions and garlic first and rolled that in the crescent roll with the shredded chicken. I also used creamed spinach and skipped on the can of chicken soup, using only mushroom soup instead.  It was delicious!

This was a keeper - - the whole family enjoyed it and we thought it was good the next day, too! The only change I made was to mix a small amount of cream cheese with the shredded chicken. I think some bread crumbs would be good on top, but it was great without them. Next time I'm going to add broccoli, as some other reviewers suggested. Thanks for the great recipe!

I shredded 4 chicken breasts, saut√©ed onions, added cooked crumbled bacon to stuff the crescent rolls. I used Jumbo crescents in 11x17 pan, Poured frozen corn in between the crescent rolls, poured the mushroom chicken & 12 oz EVAPORATED MILK  mixture between crescents keeping tops dry, & baked at 40 min for 400 degrees. YUMMY!

My husband is pretty picky and he loved this recipe! I 1/2 the recipe and made a few changes.
Rubbed chicken with salt, pepper, creole seasoning and garlic powder before cooking. Added 1 tbsp cream cheese, 1 carrot chopped and 1/2 cup of peas & 1/4 cup of cheddar cheese to chicken mixture. Baked for 30 minutes. Absolutely perfect & so easy. Will bake in the same pan I cooked chicken in next time to make clean up even easier.

Tops. 5-star. Made second time using thighs, 6 skinless and boneless thighs, and they are much easier to shred. Second go-round I used natural Swiss. That is a keeper in my repertoire.

I halved the recipe for our small family. And also rolled fresh spinach into the crescents and on top of the casserole. I found the whole thing to be quite salty. I'll make it again but will leave out the cheese which will hopefully remove enough of the salt taste.

I found this on a whim just trying to use the ingredients I had and it turned out so well that my hubby specially requested I save it and make it again. I tweaked this to make it my own... 
(cooked chicken thighs in olive oil and garlic, then added water, veggie bullion cube, paprika, salt/ppr and a touch of curry. After scooping the chicken out and adding it to the croissants I used the left over stock for cous cous which came out amazing. Rolled the croissants, topped with a mix of cream of chicken, 2tbs of powdered broccoli cheddar soup mix and milk. Layered grated cheddar on top. Cooked at 450 for 20min) We will most definitely be making this again.

This was awesome. I followed this recipe through, but added diced mushrooms, bacon, and onion in the soup mixture. The bacon added great flavor to the dish, blending excellently with the crescent rolls. I cooked for 40 mins at 350, but found my crescent rolls were still doughy, so I set oven at 400 and cooked for about 10 minutes longer. This was awesome and I will make it again.

I have made and enjoyed many recipes from this site and others.  I tried this because it looked easy and tasty.  It was easy, but it was not tasty.  One bite was all I could do.  My wife felt the same way.  Perhaps I did something wrong, but I can't imagine what, as I am very good at following recipes.  Sorry, this just wasn't for us.

Turned out delicious! Instead of cooking chicken as per directions I cooked chicken the slow cooker with broth and seasoning then shredded it. Added broccoli and bacon before adding  the soup mixture and it was a hit!

Delicious!!! Like one of the other cooks, I cut the chicken into strips, seasoned it and cooked until no longer pink.  I drained the chicken on a paper towel and then wrapped the chicken in the separated crescents. Next, I put mixed steamed vegetables (squash, zucchini, carrots, broccoli, cauliflower) around the wrapped chicken. Lastly, I poured the creamed mixture over the vegetables and wraps and baked as directed.

Very good tasting but my chicken was dry. Next time I will poach or do rotisserie chicken. I added peas instead of broccoli. Next time I will double the sauce because it was super yummy. Both otherwise very good recipe.

Easy to make, however had 16 rolls from the 2 dough packages so had to squeeze them in the 9x13" pan.  When baked, couldn't tell where I squeezed the extras in.  Husband had 2 helpings and said it was a "keeper!"  Great way to use leftover chicken.

My husband absolutely loved this casserole!  I added carrots, mushrooms and onions that I had on hand and some fresh thyme.  It was really tasty.  My only concern is that it‚Äôs definitely not a low calorie meal but I will make it again since my husband enjoyed it so much.  I just need more willpower!

I added onion powder to the chicken and diced jalape√±os to the liquid, extra cheese on top and panko crumbs on top of the cheese. I put all of this in my 12 inch deep cast iron skillet. My husband loves it!!

The casserole was DELICIOUS!!  I added broccoli to the mix (should have cooked it first!) and I just laid the crescent rolls on bottom of dish.  I also chopped up the chicken, did not want to shred!  I put the other can of rolls on top, with some cheddar cheese on top.  It baked within 40 min. and hubby LOVED IT.  He hates the word "casserole" though..so I use "chicken dish" instead...lol.  It is more than enough for 4 people though!!!  But leftovers are great; especially with this receipe!!

I took advice from a few other reviewers and made some simple changes to this recipe.  

I added chopped onion and mushroom,  sauted and added to my shredded chicken. 

The chicken I seasoned with salt,  pepper and McCormick's cajun seasoning as my husband likes a bite to his food. 

instead of wrapping the chicken in the crescent dough, I layered one can at these boron of my baking dish,  spread my chicken mixture,  then topped with the 2nd can of dough.  

I added fresh spinach on top of that and then the sauce.  turned out pretty good,  and will make again with further adjustments.  

overall,  a good,  very basic recipe that is open to making your own.

I think they should have called it chicken and crescent dumplin casserole. The crescents were doughy (as suspected) like dumplings. I, like others added my own twist. I added fresh spinach with the soup mixture, grilled onions and mushrooms into the crescents with the chicken.

This recipe was too labor-intensive and VERY salty.  I would not make it again.  The chicken crescents were soggy and I had to cook it much longer than 40 minutes and it was a soggy, salty, version of a Chicken Pot Pie.

Yum, but chicken was time-consuming.  Might try canned chicken next time.  Added broccoli florets - very tasty.  For us this made 8 servings, not just 4.  Will definitely make again.

We call this Cheesy Chicken Rollups. We use chicken and cheese only in the crescent roll up ave we make our ‚Äúgravy‚Äù with the cream of chicken soup, a soup can of milk and cheese. We don‚Äôt drown them in gravy when cooking but do serve the gravy for dipping later. My kids LOVE cheesy chicken roll up night!

This was always my moms recipe, and for nearly 30 years, I always thought it was a secret family recipe. I've never made it with broccoli, but anxious to try it. I make this a couple times a month and I find to use a hand mixer and shred my chicken in a bowl adds a finer, easy peasy, shred that's not so tedious like using two forks. This recipe can be made unique to you by adding various spices or garlic to it. Sometimes I've made this with a dash of Worcestershire, other times I added minced garlic, season salt. One time I even added leeks. Sometimes I use only cream of chicken, or 50/50 cream of mushroom. It's a very hearty meal and one I ALWAYS make when I am homesick.

I followed Kbing's suggestions including cooking the rolls first.   I used Cream of Chicken and Cream of Celery.  I also used Parmesan cheese instead.  I had spinach and kale growing as well as cauliflower so those went into the sauce.   Yum!

Really good but I recommend getting the low sodium cream soups as this was a bit salty.  Good comfort food and I've made it several times.  I don't use two cans of cream soup over the top, it's just too much sauce.  I only use one with the milk and cheese and is great.  I don't change it at all.

I used left over Christmas Cornish Hens.  I felt there was too much sauce, as it was all runny after being cooked.  I added 10 minutes to the cooking time since it wasn't looking done as described.  The next time I make this I will wrap the chicken, then bake the crescent rolls for some time before adding the sauce.  The rolls just tasted like dough in the dish.

My family gave this a thumbs up.  I used chicken tenders and just rolled each one in a crescent roll, eliminating the shredding altogether and seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic powder and minced onion.  Put broccoli between rolls before adding cheese sauce.  I agree it needs to cook a bit longer than 40 minutes.

It's ok. The top of my biscuits burned before the bottoms fully cooked. I did add some mixed vegetables with the gravy. Reminded me a lot of Chicken Pot Pie. Although it was ok I wouldn't make this again.

I made this recipe to use left over grilled chicken. It was AMAZING and simple. I added broccoli and made only a half batch with 1 can cream of chicken, because I didn't have cream if mushroom soup on hand. It still turned out excellent!

I really liked this recipe and am making it again. I, too, added cream cheese to the chicken along with shallots. I was more than enough mixture for my needs, so I froze the extra chicken mix. Am going to use that today for another casserole, but think I might add some broccoli as some of the others have suggested.

Taste was ok, but I left in the oven even longer than required and it was so soggy! I would not reccomend this recipe, though hearing the ingredients it sounded fabulous.

Made this.  Added cooked, fresh broccoli before baking.  Everyone loved it!  A definite keeper.

My kids thought this was fabulous; even my teen daughter (who is a very picky eater) had a second helping.  I changed it up slightly from the recipe: I cooked the chicken in chicken stock before shredding; then added blanched broccoli florets, roasted red peppers and a little white wine.  It gave it some nice flavor and made it a little more colorful, too.  Will definitely be making this again. P.S. I shredded the chicken in my food processor -- quick and easy!

I really liked the base to this recipe!! I actually slow cooked the chicken with onion, garlic, and chives. I omitted the salt and pepper. Then I shredded it with some low fat cream cream and followed the recipe. I did add broccoli and cauliflower to the soup mixture. All in all very yummy!!! I'm excited to completely modify this by doing a buffalo version!! This recipe give you lots of room to play with and use your imagination. My only con to this recipe is the VERY high in fat and sodium it is. Next time I'll use healthier soup versions.

I have been making this recipe for years and just stumbled upon it on this site.  The only thing I do a little different is add onions to the chicken (can add mushrooms too) and add a squirt of ranch to the soup mixture to give it a little spice.  It is AWESOME as leftovers!

I cut the recipe in half and baked it in an 8 by 8 inch pyrex dish.  It was pretty good, tucked asparagus (raw) in around the rolls and sauteed some mushrooms to serve on top.  Used the Kraft Italiano cheese mix.  My only complaint was the sogginess of the rolls, which might be fixed by using a 9 by 9 next time, making the sauce a little more shallow in the pan.  Might try this again, pretty good as comfort food!

Really Yummy!  I changed a few things...
1.) Added fresh minced garlic to the chicken with a little basil
2.) Took the suggestions others made and added fresh broccoli! 
3.) Used a mixture of different cheeses not just sharp chedder

Don't be afraid to stuff the rolls with a lot of chicken!  This came out great!

YUMMY!  Everyone enjoyed it.  Next time I make it, I will stuff more chicken in.  (I understuffed my 1st few that I rolled this time.)  Will also try with broccoli, and maybe even add bacon as suggested.

This was great! I thought the sauce poured over the crescent roll dough would make the crescents soggy, but they turned out perfectly! The only thing I did differently was add parmesan cheese to the sauce mixture. This was so quick and easy I will definitely make it again!
