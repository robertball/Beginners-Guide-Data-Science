I was happy that AR published this recipe, but they changed something kind of important, which is the amount of cheese. Original recipe requires 4 cups of shredded sharp white cheddar and 2 cups shredded mild cheddar. I know that's a lot of cheese, but this is mac n cheese. There would be too much liquid if you didn't add the cheese they left out of the recipe or cut down on the liquid to accommodate for the reduced amount of cheese. Granted, this is not the healthiest dish in the world, but we can enjoy something like this from time to time. Try this dish with the full 6 cups cheese and I promise you wont be disappointed.

I happened to see the recipe submitter's review on using four cups of shredded cheese instead of two. To the sauce, I did add a little hot sauce and a teaspoon each of garlic/onion powder. I happened to be out of Ritz crackers but I did have seasoned croutons--I ran them through the food processor for a rough chop and used them instead.  I did not try this myself but the husband and kids liked it, NO leftovers. I would make this again-- this was a cheap, filling meal.

First, I’d like to apologize for Goodfella for selecting her recipe so I could use up some leftovers.  I appreciate everyone who is kind enough to share their recipes, truly.  But I had half a box of macaroni and a ton of different cheeses in the refrigerator that I wanted to use.  Goodfella’s recipe appealed to me because of the addition of tomatoes and chicken broth. I recommend reading her review.  I followed the amounts pretty much, but the cheeses were an amalgamation of different cheeses which I guarantee ended up as stringy, gooey, wonderfulness.  I made half the recipe and put them in individual serving bowls.   This is without a doubt one of the best mac and cheeses I’ve made.  Thanks for sharing!

I adore baked mac and cheese, and since I have never kept a recipe box, each time I make it is a little different. This is hands down the best one I have ever made.
