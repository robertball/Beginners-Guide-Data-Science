Very good !

Adding Cucumbers give it a nice crunch !
I added grape tomatoes and sauteed the pre-cooked shrimp with garlic,lemon a onion a bit before throwing them in.

It' has been a hot day in Va. and this was perfect!  It was so easy to make and so good.  My husband is in love with this recipe.  I cut down on the onion and the lime, I added a smashed garlic clove...awesome!!!  I had pitas which I cut in half and filled with the salad.  Five stars.  I will make this for the rest of the summer.  Thanks

This is a great, refreshing summer salad.  My husband loved and and I can't wait to take it to a summer get-together.  I used larger shrimp than the recipe called for and also added about 3 tablespoons of fresh chopped cilantro.  This is a great, light summer meal.

Very Yummy! used Trader Joes Guacamole kit (2 avacados, 1 tomato, jalpeno, shallot, lime) minus the garlic and added 1 more tomato. Worked out prefectly. The pepper gave it just a bit of a nice kick. Used Trader Joes frozen pre-cooked medium shrimp instead of salad size.

I've been making a similar recipe for years. Try adding chopped cilantro (fresh) to taste for extra flavor. Also great with leftover grilled chicken. Very tasty on a warmed corn tortilla.

Yum-yum! Do as the recipe states and allow to chill so the ingredients get a chance to mingle but DO allow to stand at room temp for about 1/2hr before serving for maximum flavor.

I've made this twice now and I just love how easy it is to put together and how delicious it tastes!  I thought I'd suggest a variation I tried and liked - I added about a cup of cooked brown rice to the salad.  I thought it worked well and added some healthy whole grain carbs - it was more satisfying that way for me.  Thanks for this quick, easy, and delicious lunch idea.  (I just love the picture, by the way - but my salad looks a little less professional when I fix it!)

I loved this recipe. I sauteed the shrimp with olive oil and cilantro. I let the cucumbers, olives (I added these), tomatoes, avocados, and onion all marinate with a bit of evoo and the lime juice with salt n pepper. I served with buttered pita toast. Very pretty and yummy.

I made this with red onion, and threw in some arugula that needed using up. I didn't chill it - really cold salads are way less flavorful. Good stuff. Thanks!

Wonderful recipe.  No changes need to be made but today I decided to modify it a bit.  I used Jumbo shrimp cut in half because I had that on hand.  I cut the amount of onion in half.  I also added 1 tablespoon of minced cilantro and 1/2 of a jalapeno chile minced and then tossed in a can of corn (well-drained).  The corn was a last minute idea and it was a great addition.  I refrigerated it for several hours to let the flavors combine.  Thanks for the recipe.

Great idea for summer...I added some cilantro and half a seeded jalapeno.  I also used large shrimp and sauteed then in garlic and evoo instead od using salad shrimp.

This is an easy, delicious, healthy dish - I added the cucumber suggested by others for a little extra crunch.  I'm enjoying it in the dead of winter, but will definitely be making this in the summer when I don't want to turn the oven on.

This recipe deserves a 5! Everybody loved it and my dad won't stop raving about it! Only minor differences, I didn't use a lime and used canned tomatoes. Made extra for lunch the next day.

Delicious as is, although I usually leave out the onion (due to laziness/husband's preference) and add cilantro (because we looove cilantro). This has become a warm-weather standby for me, and I'm usually not a shrimp person. I think it's GREAT on warm corn tortillas, although my husband prefers to eat it out of a bowl.

Fantastic recipe - so easy to make and healthy to eat. Also added some red capsicum. Found the onion bit too overpowering, so next time will cook it lightly before adding. Otherwise great recipe - will be making again.

nice and simple!  I used a handful of spinach as a base and added cucumbers and chopped orange bell pepper.  I squeezed half of a lime all over and added a little bit of garlic powder too.  I'll be eating this again soon.

This is a great recipe. After reading the reviews, I made with the Mexican Bean Salad dressing from this site and it turned out so great I kept going back for more. While the original recipe is good, I like the addition of black olives and the different dressing to give it more zing. Such a plus not to have the typical mayo dressing.UPDATE: Made this today with fresh Ga. shrimp (readily available at the coast), Vidalia onion (locally sourced) and cherry tomatoes from my garden. Absolutely the best. Gave it about 15 minutes to let the lime juice soften and that's all it needed.

Recipe was okay.  The tiny little shrimp were yummy.  I think this recipe uses way too much avacado.  It took over the recipe.  I took some of the advice and added fresh garlic and put the mixture in a warm tortilla.  Decent meal.

This is a great base for the salad but I use the dressing from "Mexican Bean Salad" on this site.  It goes PERFECTLY together!!  I also add cucumbers, black olives, and fresh sweet corn. I also use raw shrimp and cook myself, since most store bought pre-cooked shrimp is way overcooked.

We liked this very much. We live in central Florida and eat a lot of salads during the long summers. This has some of our favorite ingredients that we hadn't put together just like this before. As usual I couldn't resist adding a little garlic salt to the shrimp. We used larger shrimp since we always have on hand a bag of large or medium frozen shrimp, grocery store brand that we frequently add to salads. Will make this again and again.

My recipe is slightly different.  I saute most of the onion with a teensy bit of garlic, use some diced pickled jalapenos in the dressing along with a tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil and lime juice. I cut the avocados in half, only, and make 'boats' out of them ending with the diced tomatoes on top.  We love it!  Needs to be chilled before serving.

I made this salad just the other day and it was great. I added the cucumbers and a little green salsa to give it some kick. Now I'm making it again. Thanks for the recipe.

The lime, salt, and onion give this salad so much flavor. I used some red onion. Cvelasquez23 suggested cucumbers and I liked that addition.  I am going to do as a couple of others have done and add cilantro next time because I love it.  But NO changes are needed for this delicious, EASY salad. My husband couldn't get enough of it.

With a few changes, this turned out to be a really delicious salad. I added diced celery to the basic recipe. Then I blended 1/4 C mayonnaise and 1/4 C sour cream, together with one TBSP of horseradish and one TBSP of minced garlic (from a jar). Served the salad au naturel with the dressing on the side. Dear wife and I loved it.

This was very good on top of some romaine lettuce for a light dinner. I added some ponzu/citrus soy sauce(?) for extra flavor, which went very well. Next time I might grill the shrimp first and cut it into pieces so it's easier to eat. I will make this again.

Excellent recipe.  I served it to 13 people over Christmas and everybody loved it.  I used about half the amount of sweet onions and I think it came out even better.

My husband loved this! As some suggested, I added chopped cucumber,  a little olive oil, cilantro, green onion (because I didn’t have red), some crushed pepper and feta cheese. Delicious!

Awesome!  Could serve multiple ways - as a sandwich filling or in a martini glass with artisan crackers. I left it chunky using jumbo shrimp.

It was okay but needed something.  Sautéing was a mistake.  It killed the onion and disguised the lime juice.  My wife liked it but she's an avocado freak.  I tried a lime juice and white wine mix as a dressing on the leftovers and that WORKED.   I will make it again with two tablespoons each of the juice and wine as a dressing sprinkled on just before tossing things.

I made this exactly as suggested.  We loved it.  It made more than four servings, and it held up for lunch the next day.  One of our guests asked for hot sauce.  He is a fussy eater, buthereally liked it.

We really enjoyed this dish.  As suggested by other reviewers I added a few more ingredients.  I added corn and cucumbers and instead of just squeezing lime, I added some olive oil and hot sauce.  I will be making it often.  This is a wonderful summer dish.

This was a hit! Perfect for a hot day.  Be careful with the onion - less is better. I used three Persian limes since they are smaller. A couple dozen cherry tomatoes, halved. Served over a bed of Spring Mix lettuce. Made enough for three adults. Will certainly be making this again!!!

This is really tasty!  I used only one avocado and a tiny bit of onion and added a bit of cilantro. I made it late last night so the Hubby and I could have it for lunch today. While letting it chill for a bit did wonderful things to the flavor, it was too long for the avocado, which started to turn color and got a bit mushy.  The Hubby suggested tossing in some rotini pasta next time.

I have to admit, I wasn't sure about this. But it was so different from other salads I had to try it, and I'm glad I did! The combination of flavours and textures was amazing, and the lime juice really brought it all together. Instead of salt & pepper, I used a few twists from my garlic-pepper-salt grinder. I also used a couple of slices (diced) Vidalia onion since it's in season. This is way more servings for us, however... I halved the recipe and we still got a little more than four servings out of it.

Delicious, quick, easy, refreshing! I used larger shrimp, since they were on hand, fresh garden cucumber and fresh basil leaves, sliced into thin ribbons. Fresh lime juice brings up the flavors as well as preventing the avocado from darkening too quickly. If you must have a carb, pita, corn tortilla, sun-dried tomato wraps, or croutons all work well.

Great summer salad.  Especially suited to a nice lunch dish because it is so light.  I made it one with chicken and two with shrimp because my daughter is allergic to shrimp. Both were delicious!  I took the advise of one viewer and served it with warmed pita bread.

Pretty good recipe. Quick easy salad. Omitted the onion as I thought it may overpower the other ingredients.

Make this, you won't be sorry! This is one of my very favorites and have been making it for a few years now.  It is always a crowd pleaser by far!  Adding cilantro to this is a must!

I really like that besides the lime juice, this requires no dressing.  I did add parsley and dill, however, and sauteed the shrimp with Old Bay.

I left out the onion and added fresh cilantro. It takes a while to clean the shrimp, but the taste is worth the effort. (Have any of you ever wondered why the shrimp container says the contents  are "DE-VEINED" but the entire bag is still full of dirty shrimp? Hmmmm.)

I was skeptical about the simplicity of this salad but these flavors really work well together. Like others, I cut back on the onion (I used red onion) and added chopped cilantro. Very tasty and healthy.

I made this salad and it tasted soooo good. However I added some ingredients to make it more satisfying. I included two small steamed potatoes chopped into pieces and cuccumber as well. I kept telling everyone to try this out. Avocado is really delicious and gives a creamy texture to the salad!!

I made this with two friends the other night. We'd been searching for something to make which I could eat with violating my diet, and this fit the bill. We followed the recipe exactly, and it was amazing. We wolfed it down, and after every other bite would look at each other and exclaim "this is so delicious!" Of course, we all had seconds, and added a bit of sriracha to the second bowl, just to experiment. The dish was still excellent with the sauce, but it wasn't any better with it; it didn't need it the sriracha.  I will be making this again and again and again.

I thought this was okay.  I added garlic and cilantro as well to the shrimp.  I think if you followed the recipe exactly, you're not going to get a very wow dish.

Excellent recipe! I really enjoyed it. I did have to make one sub, I didn't have an onion so I used onion powder instead. It turned out great and I look forward to making this for family and friends. For the pretty presentation like the picture I think I will assemble then drizzle the lime juice over the top. Thanks again.

Very good summer time meal.  I did not change a thing.  I used shrimp from Kroger and had them steam them there using the mild cagan seasoning.  Served on whole wheat pita bread.  My son took it for lunch the next day and said it was still delicious.  I have been told this will be requested again!  Very good not to mention HEALTHY!
