4.21.19  The recipe doesn’t specify sea or bay scallops, and I used bay (what I had in the freezer).  My shrimp were large, and my scallops were small, so what happened is I overcooked my scallops (and I should have known better).  I would suggest that you be sure that the  shrimp and scallops are approximately the same size, as would be the case with sea scallops.  If you use bay scallops, would recommend at the beginning adding the shrimp to the skillet and cook for 1-1/2 minutes, and then add the scallops for the last 30 seconds, as they will continue to cook later.  Just follow the timing as  listed in the recipe, and you’ll be golden!  Bottom line, the shrimp, baby bella mushrooms, onions, and asparagus were cooked perfectly.  Just get everything ready because this impressive dinner comes together quickly, as with any stir fry, and has lovely presentation.  I can buy shrimp fairly inexpensively the majority of the time, so I can see making this with only shrimp and not worrying about the size of the scallops.  Simple Easter dinner served with lemon jasmine rice, sliced tomatoes with a balsamic vinaigrette, a hot baguette, and a wedge of fresh lemon.  Shana, thanks for sharing your recipe, we thoroughly enjoyed it.

I made the recipe as directed, with the only modification being the addition of extra shrimp. The stir fry was served over rice. I found additional cooking time was needed to cook the vegetables, and the final result wasn’t particularly flavorful. Perhaps additional lemon or seasoning would punch this up a notch.

Recipe is missing when to add the garlic. Guessing when cooking the seafood? Good taste but we found it to be too much pepper. Made exactly as directed would make again with those changes.
