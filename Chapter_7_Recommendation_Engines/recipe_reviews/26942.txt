I needed a good, quick salsa recipe and this one was the perfect starting point for me.  I made a few changes based on my own tastes.  I used 1 can of regular diced tomatoes and 1 can of Rotel tomatoes (the ones with green chiles).  I use lime instead of lemon because that just makes more sense.  I use an entire onion, again my taste. 2 or 3 cloves of fresh garlic.  No hot sauce because that's just weird in salsa, and I use 1 or 2 serano peppers instead of jalapenos because I think it's a better tasting pepper.  I mix this up in a food processor and let sit overnight.  It's the only salsa I make now.

Wow!! This is fantastic salsa!! Using a blender is a great idea. The flavor is so delicious and my husband who is NOT a salsa eater, ate a large bowl of this salsa with chips tonight. I could not believe it. I made this recipe as written and was very impressed and satisfied. The ingredients and instructions are simple and it is restaurant quality. I served this with a mexican themed dinner tonight and it was a huge success. My family (except for my husband, until now) enjoys eating salsa and chips for a snack. I have purchased about every brand of jarred salsa but they just don't taste like the salsa at a mexican restaurant. I'm going to keep this as a staple in the fridge and never buy jarred salsa again. Great recipe and thank you for sharing.

This is a GREAT salsa. It is easy and fast. I add a can of green chillis and use a can of Rotel tomatoes for an extra kick.

This salsa is very similar to the hot salsa that comes with the chips at the Mexican restaraunts. It is made with canned tomatoes but the cilantro & onion gives it a nice freshness.  I also used a hand emulsion blender which made it real quick to make. The only downside is it is a little bit too hot for my taste.  I added a pinch of garlic powder and of onion salt, but left out the hot sauce as the green chiles in tomatoes and fresh jalepeno was enough hotness for me. Also it makes a lot of salsa. So, unless your having a party, I would maybe cut the recipe in half.

Sarah, I just made this wonderful salsa, and it was wonderful!  I left out the onions, added 2 cloves of garlic, and added canned jalapeno peppers.  It tastes better than tbe mexican restraunts I go to.  No more canned  for me!  Thanks.

This turned out EXCELLENT!  I've NEVER made salsa before but I tried this and followed the directions step by step only I added a bit more garlic & only 1/2 of a jalepeno pepper and it was so YUMMY!  The fresh cilantro made it that much better!  Thank you SO much!!!

I confess I mainly wanted to try Sarah's Salsa because my name is Sarah but it ended up being great salsa. I've made it several times now and have yet to find a salsa recipe my husband and I enjoy more than this one.

This would be 5 stars with my changes: lime juice instead of lemon, the whole bunch of cilantro( we LOVE it in our house) cumin, salt, pepper, and leave out the hot pepper sauce. Made that way, it tastes just like our authentic mexican restaurant's salsa. YUMMY!

This was my first time making salsa. I took it to a tailgate party and everyone really liked it. I did make a few changes, though, which I think made a positive difference. I replaced 1 can diced tomatoes with 1 can whole, peeled tomatoes, used lime juice instead of lemon, doubled the jalepenos, added more hot sauce, and threw in a bit of cumin (based on other reviews). I also did not blend it until smooth, because I like my salsa chunky. With these small changes, the recipe is very good and will be what I use from now on.

This recipe is excellent as is. I made it exactly as written the first time but the second time I made it I added green onion which I love, an extra clove of garlic and only blended one can of the tomatoes with the jalapeno, garlic, hot sauce, lemon juice, cilantro and salt and pepper and left 3 cans of tomatoes (2 w/green chiles) and the sliced green onion unblended for a chunkier salsa which I prefer over smooth salsa...thanks so much for the excellent recipe. It is so so good.

Great recipe! Instead of the the yellow onion, I used red onion and you can use lime juice if you don't have any lemons around. Also, for a change, you can use the fire roasted diced tomatoes. Really delicious salsa.

This salsa rocks! It was super quick and super easy and super delicious. I blend it really smooth and use it for a low-fat/cal salad dressing.

This is such a great recipe for salsa!  Taste just like what you would get in the restaurants....the only thing I would add is maybe a little more salt, but that's it.  I'm sure this is going to a be a winner with the kids!

This is a great, easy salsa recipe!  Has just the right amount of "after bite" to it.  I had to leave out cilantro :( because my husband doesn't like it and I think I blended a little too long..at least for the consistency I like, but great flavor.  Thanks!

So easy! I served with Adobo Sirloin from Allrecipes. I omitted jalapenos, lemon juice and hot sauce, and substituted chopped chipotle pepper and a little adobo sauce in the salsa. It's hot - a little goes a long way, but so good. This recipe is awesome when made exactly the way it's written, too. I don't like cilantro, so I always use parsley instead.

Dee-licious!  What an excellent idea - this is my favorite kind of salsa, why not make it myself?  Only problem was my own fault - I thought 2 jalapenos would be better than 1...whoa!

Everybody loves this.  I used 2 whole cans of diced tomatoes with green chiles and omitted the can of green chiles and the 2 cans of plain diced tomatoes.  Surprisingly fresh-tasting, probably due to the cilantro, so be sure to include it.

YEAH! Fast, faux-fresh salsa.  I dry grilled a small poblano and jalapeno pepper (use membrane and seeds if you want it spicy), onion and 2 garlic cloves (leave skins on until grilled-then remove).  Whirl veggies in the food processor briefly, then add to DRAINED tomatoes.  Reserve the liquid and add back in if needed.  I used one 28 oz. can diced tomato and one 14.5 can fire-roasted diced tomato.  Add a little salt and sugar--no other seasonings needed.  Yum, Ole!

I love this salsa and so did everyone I made it for!! The only thing I did differently was I left out the hot sauce. I like it milder personally but besides that this is now the only salsa recipe I'll ever make!! Yum!

Oh my goodness, this is the best. I made only two changes which was to add the whole bunch of cilantro as I like it. I also omitted the jalapenio as I do not care for them. We ate the whole recipe in one day. Will definintely make again.

Only used 1 can tomatoes. Used 2 fresh Hatch green chiles. Omitted the hot sauce. Used lime juice instead of lemon juice. I thought the salsa was great & put it in the African Yam Soup (that David & I both LOVED), but by itself, David said this salsa didn't have enough "balance" to it.

I made this as a way to use up some canned tomatoes that had been in my cupboard for some time. I was pleasantly surprised, this recipe is excellent!! The only thing I did different was add some sliced green onions for a little more color. I will use this recipe again, without doubt. Thanks!

Easy and quick and except for the chips...healthy! I left the seeds in the jalapeno and skipped hot sauce. Didn't have a can of diced tomatoes with green chili so added a large can of chopped green chili instead. A food processor will work just fine.

I used cherry tomatoes from the garden and added a can of "three bean salad" from Aldi (seasoned Mexican-style).  I made it without the ribs or seeds of the jalapeno but it wasn't spicy enough so next time the whole thing is going in.

Soooo easy to make and delicious too! I have been using this recipe for years and it is high time to review it! I make it according to the directions, but do not blend it. I use an onion chopper that I have so everything gets thrown in and is diced together instead of making it smooth. I use a smaller sized Jalepeno pepper and it is the perfect amount. This recipe is just too easy!

canned toms in salsa is a new concept for me. what a great idea for homemade salsa during the winter. i added some cumin, more garlic, a little salt, and sugar. to me, salsa is like mexican rice. everyone has their own taste so use this as a base and adjust to your liking.  i will be making salsa w/ canned toms from now on during the non growing season. i did use bottled lemon juice which worked fine but i would suggest lime. i didnt need the hot sauce but i left a lot of the ribs in my peppers for  heat

This recipe is great - simple, quick - and delicious. It's also basic/flexible enough that you can really just add anything to taste - jalepenos, corn, avacado, beans,green peppers – there are tons of possibilities!

I was surprised at how delicious this was.  You can tell there's canned tomatoes in there (which isn't a bad thing), but with all the fresh ingredients added, it's really good.  I used one can of stewed tomatoes and one can of Italian tomatoes (all I had, lol) and half a green bell pepper in place of the jalepeno- I like it pretty mild.  Doubled the garlic, and used 1/4 of a small red onion.  Used lime juice instead of lemon and added more cilantro.  Didn't use the blender; just used my immersion blender to break up the stewed tomatoes.  I like it chunky.  Thanks for the recipe.

I tweaked this just a bit to meet our tastes but it was pretty darn good before the tweaking. I drained much of the liquid from the tomatoes w/chilies and used 2 cans. I also cut the cilantro to a couple of tablespoons because it has such a strong taste. We like a bit of heat to our salsa so I used 2 large jalapenos and about 1/4 tsp of Tabasco sauce. Added some salt and black pepper ....man oh man this is GOOD! I had planned to freeze half of it but I don't think its going to last that long! Using food processor for chopping and then throwing it all in the blender, this was ready in about 10 minutes.

This is a really excellent recipe, we loved it.  The only thing I did different was add 4 jalapenos instead of 1, because we like it hot and spicy, and two cloves of garlic instead of one.

Very good!  I cut back so I used 1 can of diced tomatoes and about a half can of hot green diced chilis.  Then added the rest of the ingredients to taste.  Delicious!  Never thought of adding hot pepper sauce to salsa!  Thanks!

Great Salsa!  And very easy to adjust to your family's personal taste.  The first time, I made it exactly as written.  It was good but a little spicy for my family as I have 2 children under the age of 10 yrs.  The next time I adjusted the spices & heat level (2 Tbsp cilantro, 1/2 jalapeno, no hot sauce) so that the salsa was a little milder. more tomato-e tasting.  My hubby & kids raved & insisted I make more!  This is a keeper! I plan to have this around instead of the jar stuff.  Thanks Sarah!

I had high hopes given all the great reviews, but this salsa really fell short of expectations.  It had too much of a canned tomato taste.  Maybe I'm spoiled living in CA where authentic Mexican salsa abounds, but I will not bother trying to make this again.  My attempts to doctor it up still yielded a less than satisfactory product.  Sorry.

This salsa is killer - I get tons of requests for the recipe, and to bring it to parties and pot lucks.  The only changes I made are to use lime juice instead of lemon, more garlic than called for, only 1 can of tomatoes with green chilies, omit the hot sauce, and add salt.  Everyone loves it!

I was skeptical about using canned tomatoes but it turned out fine.  Great basic recipe...made some changes...used 3 14.5 oz cans of diced tomatoes, (2 plain, 1 with chiles), used a whole onion and 2 cloves of garlic, lime juice instead of lemon, no hot sauce, added a red bell peppper in addition to the jalapeno and definitely salt.  Make's a full blender's worth (3 full jars so you can share) Best part is you can just rough chop everything and pulse it a bit, stopping to stir the bottom up every so often.  Takes 10 minutes to make. It's a keeper.

Delicious and easy. I used just one can of the tomatoes and one can of tomatoes w/green chilis. Used a serrano chili instead of jalapeno, and a brown onion instead.  Added more fresh cilantro (like that flavoring).  And only blended it all for about 5 seconds so it didn't get too soupy.  The best!

I was not impressed by this recipe at all - I hesitated to make a salsa recipe using canned tomatoes and now I know why - there's a funny "unfresh" taste to the salsa...it did have a bit of a kick to it because of the jalapenos, but most of my guests did not make any comments about the salsa (not a good sign).  Note:  I followed the recipe exactly and did use a namebrand for the canned tomatoes...I will look for a salsa recipe using fresh tomatoes going forward.

This salsa is excellent! I have never made salsa and I made it for a party- I got many compliments! One thing, I substituted the diced tomatoes with fresh tomatoes. However, I did use a can of diced tomatoes with diced bell peppers and then measured the fresh diced tomatoes using the empty can. Put the tomatoes cut into large pieces in the blender a few at at time and pulse chop (take them out). DO NOT OVER CHOP! Chop the onions separately but not too fine. With the blender empty, put in the canned tomatoes, then put all ingredients in- use a spatula to mix the ingredients a bit and then pulse blend for a second. Mix with spatula again and then pulse blend again. Do this until you get the consistency you want. I made mine just chunky enough and everything was blended well! YUM!

This has an awesome flavor.  The only reason that I did not give it 5 stars is that my DH prefers a much "thicker" salsa.  But if you like your salsa on the "thinner" side...you will LOVE this!!  Thank you for a great recipe.

We decided to try this recipe on the spur of the moment and are certainly glad we did.  The consistency is just right.  I'd read reviews from folks who said to not put onions in the blender as they give way too much onion flavour, so we chose to add the onions, cut finely, afterwards.  Our changes were to use lime juice and white onions.  We didn't notice it was supposed to be a can and a half of Rotel, so we used only one can, we added more garlice since everyone here likes it more garlicy and I'm a wuss, so there was no hot pepper sauce or jalepenos added in my bowl! If I was to bring this for others I would add them as most folks seem to like it hotter.  This salsa is very flavourful and "sweet" for those of us that prefer a sweeter taste.  Super!

VERY simple to make... great flavor.  I followed this recipe, making a few changes as others suggested.  Depending on your level of handling spicyness... you may want to add half of a serrano pepper instead of a whole one.  I chopped up a whol eserrano, leaving the seeds along with it and it had quite a bit of a kick (next time I will use half).  I also used 2 limes, great flavor!  Leaving it in the fridge overnight definately enhanced the overall flavor. I will use this recipe over and over from now on.

This was sooo easy. I will be honest, when it was finished, I tried it and was insanely disappointed. I put it in the fridge and gave it another chance the next day. SOO GOOD! Only downside is that it has to wait and chill before being so good.

The family loved this salsa.  Everyone said it tastes just like a Mexican restraunts.  Next time I will drain some of the juice from the tomatoes, it gets a little watery after a day.

The first time I made it I found that 1/3c of cilantro is *way* too much and overpowered everything else. I've cut back on the cilantro and instead of a can of tomato/chilies I use a can of diced chilies.

Thank you so much for this recipe! It is so easy & tastes really great. I love the taste of salsa but usually face a real dilemma: I hate onions, & it's hard to eat around them with salsa. Now I have a solution- I can make my own & leave out the onions! :) My whole family loved it. I will definitely not be buying jarred salsa anymore!

Okay. So, I HAD to make this because my name is Sarah and it would be great to have an actual salsa recipe with my name in the title. I used lime juice in the salsa only because we like the taste of that better. I also only used a bit of the tomatoes in the blender with the garlic, cilantro, onion and lime juice and mixed that into the diced tomatoes because we like our salsa chunky. Other than that, I changed nothing else. Really tasty salsa and it only took five minutes. I won't be buying jarred salsa again, that's for sure.

Wonderful taste, very very easy to make....I did change the recipe slightly by roasting both the jalapeno and the onion in the oven for 1/2 hr. Great recipe, thanks!

This salsa was amazing!  It was just the recipe I was looking for...tastes just like my favorite Mexican restaurant's salsa.  I think maybe slightly less garlic may be better.  I was still tasting garlic the next day.  Makes a lot but we went through it in a day and a half!

This was pretty tastey.  I used lime juice instead of lemon and added extra onion and a tsp of salt.  It would be good with some fresh tomato mixed in with the canned. I think a finely chopped green pepper would be a nice addition also.  After reading the warnings about blending it too much...I blended it in small batches to get the consistency right.

Awesome salsa! has the same texture and flavor as the salsa that they serve at Mexican Restaurants.  I added an extra jalapeno, only put in one can of the diced tomatos with the green chiis, and added a little salt.  Will be making this again for sure.  Thanks for the recipe.

Wow what a hit.  This is the best salsa recipe we've tasted in a long time.  I added 1 serrano pepper, used frozen chopped onions (lazy way, no chopping), and used 1 can of hot and 1 can of original tomatoes with chili peppers.  It gives it a nice bit.  I've seen the tomatoes in mild too.  It's just preference.  It's our new favorite, so much better than the name brand salsa.  Thanks Sarah

Great salsa recipe. Great for parties and get togethers. Although I make this for the heck of it. Makes for a good snack food. I follow the recipe pretty much as is, but I add in a little extra onion and garlic and just do 2 cans of tomatoes with green chiles. Mine usually has a tiny bit of a kick to it, nothing we can't handle. Very good, thanks for sharing.

not the best, i did everything how it said to make it except i used 2 jalepenos instead of one. I like salsa thats spicy.  It might be just because i dont like tomatoes. (it calls for lots of tomatoes!) And also the cilantro does not taste good in this! I do not recomend if you like spicy salsa, and or do not like tomatoes very much.

Even with all the praise this recipe has earned I was not expecting to get a product this PERFECT from home - and using canned tomatoes at that! I love love LOVE salsa in mexican restaurants and while not the best I've ever tasted, this is so close to it I have no need nor desire to try and find another recipe. I feel the key to the this is using FRESH onions, jalepenos, and cilantro. It just transforms the tomatoes, I've tasted the salsa blend at just tomatoes and after adding the produce and the difference is stark. I personally leave out the hot pepper sauce and garlic. EXODUSMOM, you have transformed my kitchen and cost Pace hundreds of dollars in revenue: thanks so very much for sharing!

Made exactly as written, this recipe is missing something. It tasted very bland to me, except for the taste of cilantro. I added salt and a small amount of cider vinegar & sugar. That improved it a little, but for our taste, the cilantro overpowered any other flavor in there. It had a good aftertaste (after the cilantro flavor was gone). Next time I will cut back on the cilantro. I used a food processor instead of a blender and just pulsed it a few times. The consistency was perfect. I will definitely try this again, with some more tweaking.

for quick salsa, this works great!  Stir a couple of tablespoons of this salsa in with two avacodos, lemon juice, a little salt and garlic powder  and you have really good, quick guacamole.

I am currently visiting relatives in the Philippines, so I had to make some substitutions since you can't find certain things here. I used *canned* jalapenos, some random "green pepper sauce" rather than the Tabasco-esque pepper sauce I'm guessing the recipe meant for us to use (had to use a lot more than 3 drops as a result), and the same proportion of diced tomatoes but without green chiles (added some chopped bell pepper to make up for it). When completed as written, the salsa does seem to be "missing something", but it is actually a plus because, as the description states, you can add to taste. I added a few dashes of salt, and a bit extra lemon juice, cilantro, and onion. Finally, I accidentally dumped in a good amount of the liquid the jalapenos were floating in (haha). But hey, it turned out exactly how I like salsa :) My whole family loves it!

YUMMY!  The only change I made was I used 2 cans of the tomato green chile because I had no other use for the other 1/2 can.  I did drain the second can to keep it from being too watery.

Where we live, you can't buy salsa, so this was a first time experience to try to make it.  This recipe was a great starting point and I can add/change ingredients to suit our tastes more.  I still haven't found the perfect mix, but I'll keep working at it.  It really is easy to make.  If I perfect my recipe, I'll still make it from scratch even when we go back to the States - it's that easy.

Wow!  I LOVE this salsa. It has a ton of fresh taste, but without much chopping.  I wasn't sure whether to de-vein my jalapeno pepper or not, but I did anyway and I thought it still had a nice little kick.  I'm making it again this weekend to take to a family 4th of July gathering.  It does make a TON so hopefully you have some friends around to help you consume it.  Oh, and get a BIG bag of chips.  :-)

This salsa is SO good. I've made it twice already and am going to make it again tonight. I've stuck to the recipe on everything but the type of tomatoes - I've used a variety of canned (i think having some crushed and then the diced with chiles in there tastes good) and fresh. I also didn't add any hot sauce. We like it mild. And I don't blend until completely smooth. But it is pretty smooth.

This was just ok.  I actually liked the consistancy, but the flavor was missing something.  Made it exactly as it reads with name brand tomatoes, but it tasted canned.  The next day I added 2 tsp of chili powder, a bit more garlic, and antother jalepeno, which helped.  This does make A LOT.

Usually I like a chunkier salsa, so I was skeptical of the blending till smooth part, but it turned out perfect. This is a great recipe and I can see that it's really versatille. The only thing I changed was I chopped up a hot pepper, and threw that in instead using hot sauce.  Next time I think I would add both and a bit more cilantro and lime juice instead of lemon.

Also it does make a pretty big amount so it was perfect for the party I was hosting, but I don't know if I could eat that all between a couple of people in a short period of time.

Good, my husband loved it.  I think it would be better with fresh.  It seemed to be missing something.  The cilantro adds a great flavor.

Restaurant quality salsa.  A very solid salsa recipe.  I used 1/2 fresh tomatoes to 1/2 canned to use up some fresh garden tomatoes that I had on hand. I reduced the cilantro slightly.  At one time, I didn't care for cilantro, but I think it's growing on me now.  One "common sense" caution: If you prefer chunkier style salsa (or even if you don't), be careful how long you blend the mixture.  It's salsa, not tomato juice.  Hehe.

We loved this salsa!  My hubby is not easy to impress, but he really liked this.  I used part fresh tomatoes and part rotel because I wanted to use up some of garden's tomatoes.  I had to add a little salt too. This will be a staple in our house from now on!

Good recipe for a quick salsa when tomatoes aren't in season. I used lime juice instead of lemon. Don't blend too much or it'll be soupy. 
Note: This is now my go to salsa. I never buy it premade, this is so easy!

The first day I made this, I put half in the freezer for a later date. Well, I had to thaw it out before the day was out. My family is inhaling it! Next time I made it. I bought tomatoes in a gallon can at Sam's. Thanks for a good one!

I left out the jalapeno pepper and didn't put this in the blender as I wanted it a little chunky. It's an easy fix for homemade salsa.

This turned out excellent. Upped the garlic and onion a little bit, left out the hot sauce and used both lime and lemon juice. Has a bright and fresh taste with just the right amount of spice kick. Didn't use the blender, pulsed with an immersion blender to leave it a bit chunky. I also drained about half of the juice from the canned tomatoes so that it would be a bit thicker.
Don't think I'll ever buy salsa again, this is much better and so easy.

I'm giving 4 stars because it's a great base for a quick and easy salsa. I added more spices and hot sauce based on my personal preferences.

This definitely tasted like tomato sauce, except a little stranger. I'm not sure why it says to put into the blender, because then you get a smooth sauce instead of a chunky salsa. Not my favorite Allrecipes Salsa...

This is a delicious  recipe.  Only thing I added was green pepper. Made way more than I expected but that was a great thing. Just divided it up and made one batch hotter than the other.  Will make again.

This was excellent!  I made it for a party and it was gone quick!  This is definitely spicy though.  I had to add about 4 more cans of tomato to lower the heat.  It could have just been the jalepenos I used, but I don't think I will put any in next time.

Used lime instead of lemon, 2 jalapenos (we like it hot) a whole bunch of cilantro, and kept it a bit chunky. Huge hit at my party.

I was looking for a very quick recipe and for me too, this was it! I did not have diced tomatoes so I used fresh simple ones and this still worked out to be very tasty. Easy and good.

Needed to add salt and extra hot sauce since everyone likes hot salsa here in AZ. Otherwise it was super easy and I will be making it again. The blender was good for restaurant style. I also skipped the blender for a chunky version. :)

This recipe was exactly what I was looking for. I needed an easy recipe that could be ready quickly. It tastes really good even without the cilantro, which I didn't have on hand. I used lime because that's what I had, and added cumin because I love it in anything that is even remotely a Mexican cuisine. Thanks!

Wonderful recipe! Served with Whit's Chicken Enchiladas (see reviews). It was perfect. Tastes so fresh. I did add a bunch of cilantro and more fresh lime juice because we love those flavors. I might make this to give for Christmas presents.

This is an awesome basic salsa recipe.  I loved it, but I made a couple changes. I used diced rotel tomatoes with green chiles.  Used smaller amount of cilantro and it was still overpowering.  Did not taste any garlic with only one clove, so added some garlic powder.  I loved it and it's a great basic recipe to tweak to your liking. It's by far better than any store bought salsa. Thanks!!

This was fabulous.  Received rave reviews at my dinner party.  One guest said I should bottle it and sell it to our friends.  I gave her the recipe.  I just put everything in the food processor and it turned out perfect.  BETTER than my favorite restaurant.  Thanks Sarah!

This was so easy to make and it was delicious. A little spicy but then I like it that way. I made this for a cooking clubt hat I belong to and it was a big hit. I have never made salsa before but I will from now on.

This is the best salsa I've ever had!  My husband and I don't like really chunky salsa and this is perfect because you can blend it to your liking. I love cilantro and garlic so it was perfect for me.  I also added an extra clove of garlic and a little more hot pepper sauce.  EXCELLENT!

Very and easy to make and tasty.  I like salsa hot, so I added 6 drops of pepper sauce instead of 3.  That was a mistake, but still great.  Next time I will stick to recipe, except maybe a little less cilantro.  Thanks, Sarah!  I will make this often.

THIS IS AN AWESOME RECIPE! MY SON AND I CAN'T STOP EATING IT. IT TASTE JUST LIKE OUR FAVORITE RESTAURANT'S SALSA. I LEFT OUT THE HOT SAUCE AND USED LIME INSTEAD OF LEMON BUT EVERYTHING ELSE WAS GREAT.

This salsa was pretty darn tasty! I took it to work for Salsa Daze and came home with an empty container. Some complained it was too hot though, so you may want to omit the jalepeno if you can't take the heat. I will be making this again. Thanks Sarah!
