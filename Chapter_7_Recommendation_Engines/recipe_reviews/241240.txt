I modified this dish tremendously using food items I already had in my kitchen.  For starters I used salmon and shrimp for the seafood.  Replaced the basil with spinach.  Added sweet tomato basil sauce, original rotel and jasmine rice mixed with garlic, peppers, onions, mix blend of shredded cheeses, lemon juice and other amazing spices. Despite the modification, the recipe turned out amazing and I love it!  This will be a new staple to my weekly meal prep.

Just based on what I had on hand, I used bell peppers and omitted the fish. Super easy to make and my family loved them! My toddlers ate every last bite. So good!

So, I made these tonight & I really enjoy how tasty the filling ended up being. I will say that of course DO NOT BUY CUBANELLE PEPPERS!!! Why the cook has that, I do not know.  Use Sweet Bell Peppers-.  Tip #1: Use maybe 1/4  or 1/2 of the Clamato cocktail. I felt a cup was waaaayyy too much-made for a watery mix in the pan that I had to ultimately drain. Tip #2:  Boil your hollowed out peppers in water for a bit before filling them. This allows the peppers to be softer after the oven time.  What I did differently: I used 2 tilapia fillets & a can  of black beans; it allowed for me to stuff 8 peppers. I used Uncle Ben´s long grain wild rice-the kind that comes in 90 second packs). I forgot to mix the cheese in but I will next time. I did put it on the top before putting it in the oven.  I also used butter , 
Tony´s Cachere Original Creole Seasoning,  salt, & pepper. Very flavorful! I look forward to making it again with my own learned tips!

This was a pretty good recipe. I cooked my rice in a tomato and chicken stock base for some extra flavor. I didn’t have scallops on hand so I stuck with tilapia and red shrimp. The only thing I’d change in the future is to add stock or water to the pan with peppers. Even though it was covered, it was still a bit too crunchy for me. I wanted my peppers to be steamed more.

My husband made this for me.  It was so delicious.  Easy to prepare and make.  We had enough for left overs the next night, even better then.
