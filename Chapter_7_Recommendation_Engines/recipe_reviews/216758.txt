My husband is currently eating his fourth bowl of this stuff, no lie. I actually made the whole deal in my cast iron skillet--sauteed, simmered, added biscuits and stuck it in the oven. Turned out perfectly and made a neat presentation, as well.

Thank you for this recipe, Pam!  I prepared it "exactly" as the recipe stated - the eight peoole I served it to, ranging from 4 years old to 80+ years, loved it.  They thought it was better than similar dishes they've had at those "country" restauants.  I've done reviews on very few recipes even though I have been visiting this site for years - and this one merits much praise.

Thank you for this recipe, we all liked very much and I will make it again. I did adjust the recipe slightly, I did not have any parsley and used some basil instead also I added 2 cloves of garlic chopped and sauteed with the vegetables. (it is difficult to make a dish in our house without garlic ;) I also used Bisquick drop biscuits for the crust. It is great to find a new way to use the leftover rotisserie chicken, and the kids love it.

I've used this site for years and never commented, but had to say but this was the best and the easiest of all the versions I've tried!  I always add broccoli florets, and sliced almonds as well as a tablespoon of sherry to whatever version I use and it really enhances it. Sometimes I use a puff pastry to top. I copied those ideas from a restaurant whose pot pie was wonderful.  Thanks for sharing!!

This was a great comfort food.  I used refrigerated biscuit dough and halved them horizontally to be sure they baked through.  I used frozen mixed vegetables, cooked them just a little bit before adding to chicken mixture.  Used quite a bit more chicken than called for, as we like lots of meat in our casseroles/meat pies.  Turned out delicious.  Will definitely make again.

Loved this recipe!  I used rotisserie chicken, frozen carrots, chicken stock instead of broth and doubled the stock/flour/half and half mixture.  For the crust I used Pillsbury pie crust. Sooooo good!!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was very good! The basic recipe is excellent, but I made a few tweaks:
I crumbled and saute'd two sweet Italian sausages and mixed with the chicken.
I peeled and cubed 1/2" pieces, two medium red potatoes. Par-cooked them in lightly salted water so they were almost tender. Added them to the vegetables just before adding the flour, which I increased to 1/3 cup plus 2 tablespoons.
I had no broth so I used chicken base and added it to 3 cups water- according to pkg. instructions.
I had no 1/2 and 1/2, so I used a whole can of evaporated milk.
This mixture filled a 9x13" Corning-ware baking dish and I still had room for the biscuits.
I made my own drop biscuits:
Mix together:
2 cups flour
2 tsp. baking powder
1/4 tsp baking soda
1 tsp salt
Cut in:
1/4 shortening
Stir in:
1 cup buttermilk
Drop over chicken mixture as stated and then bake at 400 for the 20-25 minutes.

Very good!  It took a while to cook the biscuits. Next time I will either flip the biscuits over halfway through, or cook a little before I put on top. But it was a great meal. Very tasty!

My husband and kids really liked this!  I poached  individually frozen chicken breast in the broth to cook it and used the liquid to make up the sauce as directed.  Didn't have thyme but used poultry seasoning.  A definite make again

This is a great comfort food recipe.  The reviewers who said this was bland, you should taste and season the chicken mixture several times with salt and pepper.  I baked the biscuits for five minutes on a baking sheet and then I put them on top of the chicken mixture and baked for twenty minutes.  The biscuits were golden brown and baked through.  Perfect!

Followed the recipe exactly, I doubled all the ingredients and made one pie for dinner, and two for the freezer. (will top with the biscuits before popping in to the oven).  Great basic pie. UPDATE ~ I used the mini biscuits and oh so much better.  They cook perfectly throughout, not doughy on the bottom like the regular size.

Fantastic! Instead of using fresh carrots, celery, onion i used 2 bags of frozen and diced up red potato on 1st part. Also used 1/3 cup of flour and about 2 1/4 cups of broth. With the chicken i tossed in canned drained mushroom pieces.  Fantastic meal !! left overs were great for lunch the next day!!

I made this tonight with leftover turkey.  All I had on hand was canned crescent rolls.  I laid them out on top and they came out beautiful.  Cooking time had to be changed due to the crescents being thinner.  Everybody loved it.

Wow - a little bit of work, since you have to cook the filling, then bake the potpie, but worth it. I made the recipe as listed with a few minor variations - I added a few turnips to the vegetable mix, because I had them in the fridge. I used fat-free half-and-half and skipped the egg yolk wash on the biscuits. The filling had a great flavor, with the thyme, and the sauce was the perfect consistency, not too thick but not too thin. I used regular Pillsbury Grands refrigerated biscuits (in the can) and they made a great topping. I only used about five in a circle around the top, so there was a little space in between, which I think helps them brown and cook through more (because steam can escape the filling mixture as it heats). A homey, filling meal.

Very easy and tasty dish! Added 1/2 tsp sage and used crescent rolls placed over top since that is what I had. Turned out great! I also substituted canned corn for peas. Cooked it in one pan and put the whole pan in oven to make it a one dish meal.

This chicken pie is fabulous! I'm glad I altered the amount so my husband would have leftovers for a couple of nights because of our different schedules.
We couldn't believe how great this turned out.
One thing I did not do is alter the recipe in any way which is very unusual for me. I like to change a couple ingredients more to our liking but this one sounded perfect as is and it was.
I boiled split chicken breasts which made them very  tender and juicy. I am making this again this weekend and there will be plenty left for him to enjoy during the week. The entire pie stays tender and juicy with reheating.
I can't rave enough on the taste, texture and quality of this awesome dish and am so glad I found it!!! Thank you!

My family LOVED this. I've made it twice, and I've only changed two small things. The first is that both times I've used less half and half than is called for (about half, and the other half 1% milk). Also, the first time I made this I didn't like how doughy the biscuits were on the bottom, so the second time I actually arranged them on a cookie sheet (so they were touching like they would on the pot pie) and baked them separately from the pot pie for about 6 - 7 minutes before putting them top of the filling and continuing to bake the whole thing.

I HAD TO ADJUST THE 4 CUPS OF CARROTS TO ONE AND THE 2.5 CUPS OF CELERY TO 3/4. I ALSO ADDED SOME ONIONS BECAUSE I THOUGHT 2 TBSP WASN'T ENOUGH. IT TURNED OUT OK THOUGH.

I love chicken pot pie and this did not disappoint!!!  I used the recipe exactly as listed and it was very yummy!  Like another reviewer, I was also worried the biscuits wouldn't cook all the way through...however, I used Pilsbury Grands Jr. and they turned out perfect!  I also used a rotisserie chicken.  My husband and seven year daughter enjoyed this tons too!  Thanks for a delicious recipe I can add to my file!

Loved this! I always have problems with the bottoms of the biscuits baking. I ended up adding 7 minutes to the baking time & it seemed to be just the right amount of time. I also used skim milk (reduced to 1/2 c.), 2 cans of canned chicken & whatever veggies I had laying around. FABULOUS!!!

Fabulous and easy!  A real keeper.  I didn't have any parsley so I didn't add it, but it didn't need it.  The flavor was wonderful!  I did add garlic because we love it and used bagged frozen mixed vegetables because I had it on hand.  Like another reviewer suggested, I cut the biscuits in half so they would cook faster and it worked great.  The whole family is burning their tongues right now because as my kids say "it's just so good I can't stop eating it!"  Even with my substandard ingredients, this recipe is 5 star.  Can't wait to make it with parsley and fresh veggies.  Wish I had made a double batch!

This chicken pot pie is beyond amazing!! Only thing I did different was use stock instead of broth and dried parsley because that's all I had! I used a can and a half of grands layered biscuits to make sure every spot was covered! Heavenly!! I did what another user did which was prep in the cast iron and then just bake with that. Saves on dirting another dish! Will be making this again, and again, and again! Thanks for the recipe!!

Quick, simple, and delicious! Cook the chicken beforehand, or use leftover to speed it up even more. Also makes for great weeknight leftovers.

We found a great way to make pot pie, when you purchase a rotissere chicken save some of the thigh meat as well as any lean parts of leftover chicken and chop into pcs.   If your lacking flavor add 1/2 pkg of new Swanson flavor packs to your gravy.

Absolutely awesome!!!  I made a biscuit dough from scratch (didn't have any other options) and dropped it by the spoonful on top...It turned out great.....I also threw in the veggies I had on hand - green beans, diced potatoes, peas and carrots....I will definitely be making this ALOT this winter - my kids couldn't get enough of it :o)  Thankyou!!

This recipe was great!  I also added a little corn that I cut off of a leftover corn on the cob, and a diced med red potato (just because I wanted to use them up).  I didn't have half and half on hand, so I used whole milk.  I had made an oven roasted chicken with veggies the night before and used the leftover chicken for this.  I also threw in the leftover veggies.    I didn have any refrigerated biscuits, so I used this recipe that I found on this site:
  1 cup all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup milk
1 teaspoon butter or margarine, melted
One of the reviewers for this recipe warned to only mix this until just blended or they would be tough.
I doubled the recipe, divided it into 8 biscuits, and just dropped them onto the mixture.  Baked all in the oven at 350 for 25-30 min.

It was delicious!  I added garlic and poultry seasoning.  Also made the filling for 9 servings then topped with the 1 can of biscuits and egg wash.  It was JUST the right amount of stew/soup to biscuit.

I made this recipe for my husband's dart league.......all 30 guys loved it!!  I added frozen corn and fresh mushrooms (because I had some in the refrigerator) and used sliced potatoes for the top instead of biscuits. (again, because I had potatoes instead of biscuits!)  I sliced the potatoes with my mandolin on a medium width because they weren't going to be in the oven long and I wanted to make sure they were cooked.  Will definitely make this recipe again.

Very yummy! I used a whole roll of Pillsbury Grand Flakey Buttery biscuits - think I'll double up the potpie mix or use only half of the bisuits next time.

This recipe was delicious. I used all the ingredients as listed and used fresh herbs from my garden. For the veggies I used potatoes (precooked) and peas because that's what hubby liked. Halfway thru the meal he stops to take a photo and text it to his friend to brag about it. I make pot pie regularly with leftover chix but this is now my fav. Frankly I think it's the thyme that made the difference. The sauce was unbelievably tasty. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the biscuits. I had to cook them until almost overdone to get them cooked on the bottom. Next time I'll do what another reviewer suggested and cut into small strips. Loved it!

I made this for dinner tonight and my husband and three boys all loved it.  Definitely a keeper.  I followed the recipe except for two minor changes.   I sauted the vegetables in half butter and half coconut oil.  It gave the casserole a slighlty sweet taste.   I also chopped kale up very small and sauted it along with the the other vegetables.   The family never even noticed it was in there.

When a table full of 5 teenagers goes silent, you know you have a hit on your hands!  
I cut the biscuits a quarter way across and then twisted the ends to make it look prettier.  Plus I was afraid of a big hunk of biscuit just sitting on top.  Even so, I still had to cook longer (have made this twice) than directed to cook the biscuits through.  You could also slice across the middle to make two narrow disks instead of one large one.

This was awesome!  I'm not a fan of chicken pot pie,but my kids love it, so I found this recipe and made it.  I love that it didn't call for canned cream of whatever soup.  It was real ingredients and you could tell when you tasted it.  I will make a bigger batch next time, since everyone wanted seconds.

We loved this recipe.  In addition I located a great recipe on how to pre-cook the chicken so that it did not get dry or chewy:
I used breast tenders.  If they are not equal thickness you can use a meat tenderizer tool to fix that. Mix 1/4 cup of flour and add either dry or finely diced herbs of your choice.  I used a little rosemary, thyme and sage.  Pre-heat a skillet, add approx 2 tbl of butter and 4 tbl of olive oil.  Salt and pepper each piece of chicken and then quickly touch each side in the flour (more like a thin dusting) and place into the hot skillet of butter and oil.  Cook for 1 minute on medium, flip the pieces over and lower the flame to medium-low and cook for 10 minutes covered.  Do not open the lid!  Turn off the heat and allow to sit for another 10 minutes again without every lifting the lid.  The should be moist and tender and ready to add to your chicken pot pie.

Very tasty. I used fresh thyme instead of dried, and added garlic, poultry seasoning, and sherry. We found that there was too much biscuit for the amount of filling. Next time, I'll either use smaller biscuits or make my own small ones. Overall, a very good recipe. Perfect comfort food for a chilly winter evening.

I tried this recipe because I had leftover chicken that I needed to use. I didn't have a pie crust so this was perfect. I used canned veggies instead of frozen and it tasted fine. The only thing I would change is to increase the amount of "filling" because I thought that there was a little more bread than filling.

Very nice, indeed, and a good-looking presentation. I made the mistake of thinking the gravy, or sauce was a bit thin and got it a little too thick, but it still tasted great. Good comfort food. I don't who designed the biscuit package for the "Grands," but, getting that open was the hardest part of making this. Finally resorted to using a knife, and pffft...which was a little exciting for a moment or two.

My family LOVED this! I added frozen organic broccoli, frozen organic corn and frozen chopped organic spinach + used evaporated milk since I had no half/half, and a frozen pie crust (which I broke into pieces).  It was a huge hit! I love lots of veggies in my recipes. Thanks!

Delicious Comforting Pot Pie!  We really enjoyed it.  I love that it can easily accommodate whatever leftovers are on hand.  Hubby doesn't care for pie crust, so biscuits were a hit, although I made homemade instead of canned.

Great flavor. One meal dish.  Definitely would make again.  I loved the bisquits but my husband said he would prefer pie crust.

I made a huge mess! I decided to double this for a family of 5+ leftovers. I put it in a 9x13, got the biscuits on top and realized the pan was WAAY to full. Had to carefully take the biscuits off and transfer to a bigger 10x15 pan. But in the end it turned out good. Biscuits wanted to burn after only 10 mins but I lightly covered w/ tin foil and baked for a total of 40 mins. Canned corn instead of peas and less celery. Also a couple of diced potatoes sauteed in the mix. Will make again.

Not only did this take MUCH longer to make than it said that it would, it was just not good.  I am not by any means a picky eater but this was just bland, too runny (and I added corn starch to thicken!).  Otherwise I followed the directions exactly.  I used a 2.5 quart dish, which is larger than what was recommended and it still overflowed all over the inside of my stove.

Really good!  I didn't add the cream and never missed it.  Works well with home made buttermilk biscuits for that real homemade touch.

I have tried many chicken pot pie recipes, and this is the best.  The flavor is perfect, and it can easily be adapted to include any veggies you need to use up from your fridge. I made it a one dish recipe by doing it all in a Corningware dish that can go from stove to oven.

Outstanding, I have made this quite a few times now, my 12y.o. DS inhales it, and DH loves it too (and he's quite picky).  So easy to put together. I use the mini biscuits and stretch them out a little to cover more area, and they cook and brown perfectly.  I also use just a little egg beater instead of egg.  With some minor tweaks like these I have made this WW friendly.  Thanks again for a wonderful meal!

In our opinion the thyme overpowered the other flavors even though I used barely an 1/8 teas rather than the 1/4 teas as written.  Made from scratch biscuits and cut them quite small and had no problem with the baking time.

I made this recipe and it was fabulous! It came out great. 

Instead of using flaky-rolls on top I used French bread which came out better. It didnt flake into my food. It was more hardy and filing!

LOVED IT! So delicious and hearty... perfect for a winter night! My husband loved it, and he before trying this he used to think "pot pies were gross."  Pretty easy, too! Made excellent leftovers as well. Would definitely recommend this recipe!

The flavor of the "stew" was excellent, however, the biscuit underside was raw and doughy while the top was nicely brown...maybe longer in the oven next time?

This was wonderful! Made it exactly as instructed. The only thing I would do different would be cutting the biscuits in 1/2 horizontally to make a thinner top crust. They were a little thick and didn't cook all the way through. Definitely would make again.

Loved this! I am a vegetarian, so I added cut up Morningstar Farms Chik'n Strips to it. It was not necessary - the flavors were amazing. Only changes: it was a bit dry, so I added a little more half and half to it. It did take longer to cook it becuase the Grand's biscuits took about 15 minutes longer to fully cook. Next time, I will half the biscuits and not worry about the fake chicken. It was really yummy and the leftovers were gone the next day. Really easy to make, too!

This was an excellent recipe and didn't seem too heavy.  I cooked chicken in a crock pot for about 6 hours so that the chicken would be shredded.  I would suggest only adding about 1/3 cup frozen peas because they seemed to overpower the recipe. Overall, great recipe!

My family LOVED this recipe! Delicious basic recipe. I didn't do the the egg wash on biscuits and I added small diced potatoes. My husband doesn't care for peas. This is a staple recipe in our home now.

My husband loves this but I had to add cornstarch to the sauce as it seemed too thin. Overall, good recipe but next time will add more flour and half and half to sauce as in traditional ratio. of 1:1:1.

Definitely no leftovers!!  This was easy to make. I happened to make it just as it is listed with the exception of doubling the recipe to for in a 9x13 pan and I halved the biscuits so it would bake quicker.  It turned out perfect! 6 happy bellies here.

Come on, are you kidding me?  This was so easy and so good! We had our first snow of the season and I wanted comfort food and this delivered!  I threw the chicken in my pressure cooker while I chopped all the ingredients (I had two pounds of chicken so closer to 4 cups.) I also combined everything in my cast iron skillet and baked it.  The egg yolks wash ensures a beautiful golden brown on the biscuits so don't forget to do that.  I did add a clove of garlic but that was the only change in ingredients.  This is going into the saved recipes file FOR SURE!

This dish was delicious!  I followed the steps of the recipe exactly.  The only additions I made was 1 small potato (cooked with the carrots/celery) and almost 1 can of corn (added with the peas).  I did use canned peas instead of frozen as that's all I had.  For the chicken I cooked that quickly using Goya Sazonador Total seasoning.  I pre-bake the biscuits per other reviews and they were perfectly done after I baked the whole dish.  I did add a little more half and half & broth because I like a lot of gravy.  I cooked and baked the whole thing, including the chicken, in one pan so clean up was really quick.  While the chicken cooked I pre-baked the biscuits (about 5 minutes) and chopped all the veggies.  Besides the Goya seasoning on the chicken, I didn't add any other spices beyond what's listed in the recipe.  I will absolutely make this again (with even more gravy next time!).  Yum!

Perfect recipe when you don't want/have cans of soup. I did use the chicken fat from a chicken roaster I had made previously instead of butter and I added corn for a bit of sweetness. I made chef John's pie crust on this site instead of biscuits. But other than that, I followed the recipe. I will make this pot pie recipe again!

Fabulous recipe. Going in my "keep" file. I used the recipe as it is with only minor change, as I used frozen peas and carrots and they worked just fine. This is a very good recipe. Thank you for sharing.

Made it vegetarian and made homemade biscuit dough to go on top.

Instead of meat broth I used vegetable broth. Instead of chicken I used Beyond Meat chicken strips(amazing btw). Instead of butter used olive oil.

I cooked the carrots, celery, onion and added 2 cloves of garlic. I also added green beans. Used whole wheat flour and everything organic. Used regular milk instead of 1/2 & 1/2

So made it healthier and vegetarian.

 Now that I wrote my review, I guess I tweaked it quite a bit. Well heck, I'll call this the vegetarian version :D 

In the end it turned out amazing.

A tasty, hearty meal!  The types and amounts of vegetables are flexible.  Feel free to use any frozen kind you may have hanging out in your freezer.

This is my go-to pot pie recipe, and I eat far too much of it! I use the kentucky biscuit recipe from this site, super simple and much better than canned biscuits. I also started subbing corn for the peas because I love the sweetness. Can't bring myself to try a different recipe when I want pot pie!

Biscuits didn't cook properly...end up with doughy goo in the pot pie filling. In the future I will cook the biscuits separately and just add them on top when their done.

Delicious. Ingredients can be switched out. I used what I had on hand: corn instead of peas; dried parsley instead of fresh (3 teaspoons); turkey instead of chicken; chicken stock instead of broth. I also added 2 cups of cooked potatoes. Made a great, hearty meal!

YUM!  Did everything in a round dutch oven and put it straight into the oven for easy clean up!  I added potatoes which soaked up a lot of the liquid so I would add a little more broth next time.  I also halved the biscuits horizontally and used pieces to fill in the holes on top.  They were perfectly done after 25 minutes -- I don't think whole biscuits would have been done in that time.  Definitely a keeper!!!

Loved it!  An easier version of my chicken pot pie recipe - I followed the recipe exactly, next time I may spice it up a little more with more herbs from the garden and additional spices along with extra salt and pepper.  It's easy to vary the veggies as well.  This is one that will go in our regular dinner rotation!

Yummy, although I did make some changes. I wanted to serve more people so, I added a large can of cream of chicken soup, 2 potatoes (diced), i used a whole onion, and almost all the bag of peas. Also, I didn't have half&half so, I used a can of evaporated milk and I shredded 3 large chicken breasts instead of having pieces. Man, was this good!!! I served 12!

This was great.  I make biscuits from a lower fat mix;   I also substituted low fat condensed milk for half and half. I added garlic and onion powder. Still okay next day. Will definitely make this again.

Delicious! I added one potato, and sautéed with the veggies. I replaced the cream with fat free/lactose free milk. I replaced the butter with coconut oil, omitted the parsley and used a good amount of thyme. I also used a 9x13 and ripped the biscuits in half, they cooked all the way through in 25 minutes. Veggies could be doubled and chicken omitted for vegetarians. Hubby had four or five servings, and four year old had two (even though he usually doesn't touch food with herbs)

This was very easy, much simpler than making a pot pie with a crust but fulfills the same craving.  I thought that the filling could use a bit more flavor--not quite sure what I would add, but it needed a boost, somehow--but overall it's good comfort food.

So good!  DH and I are fighting over the leftovers.  Took a little longer to make than I would like but I will definitely make this again.  I'm sure it would be a great meal for kids.  I think I'll use frozen peas and carrots next time to save some time chopping carrots.  Loved the Pillsbury Grand biscuits on top.  Wasn't sure about the egg yolk painted on, but it was great.  20 minutes was all it needed in the oven for us.

This is the second time making this recipe and my only tweaks were I cook my chicken in the crockpot all day with wine, broth, garlic and peppercorns.  Shred it and make the recipe as stated, adding a little more thyme.  This recipe is fabulous, it makes 4 individuals and my husband eats 2 everytime!  The second time I made it I didn't have parsley, but a parsley pesto I had made and had in the freezer, added that and it was incredible.  Great recipe and easy to adjust when you need to.

Oh my gosh, so yummy!  I used chicken thighs and mushroom broth and it was soooo good!  You can assemble the mixture on the stove top in an oven safe pan or cast iron skillet and throw the whole thing in the oven and you have an awesome one dish dinner!  I served with a simple green salad and it was the perfect Monday night dinner.

This was great!  I actually substituted fat free evaporated milk for the cream and also used 1/8 cup of butter + 1/8 cup olive oil instead of the full 1/4 cup butter.  Also, I didn't use celery but added some more peas.  The only issue I had was the center roll was a little gummy.  Maybe I would just try not to squish the biscuits in so tightly together next time.  My whole family just loved this recipe!

Took another reviewer's feedback and baked it a cast iron skillet.  Looked great and tasted great, too.  My only change in the future may be to make a little bit more filling.  Otherwise, great recipe.

excellent, I didn't have carrots or peas on hand so left them out, added corn instead.  Nice creamy sauce to which I added some snips of fresh rosemary this gave it a very light delicate flavor.  I'll definitely be making this again, might even try with leftover ham.

It was absolutely delicious, it tasted just luck chicken and dumplings and was super easy to make.  

I substituted basil and Bisquik drop biscuits for the thyme/parsley and refrigerated biscuits, as well as added garlic.  

We will definitely make this again with the addition of curry powder.

Made this for dinner tonight, but used this recipe as more of a guideline. I had a few leftover already baked biscuits, so I crumbled those in the baking dish as a bottom crust, made the recipe as called for,except I had no biscuit dough, nor any time to make any from scratch, so I made a standard pie crust. My mom said the only thing I need to tweak is to make a double batch next time! Great recipe! I also had no celery so I also added a half cup of frozen corn.

This was a  good recipe and the ratios are great! 

I thought there was too much cream in it though. I would recommend either using milk or using less. 

Otherwise, I totally recommend this one.

YUM! I cut up 3 chicken breasts into bite size pieces and cooked in a little olive oil. I seasoned with salt, pepper, and a couple cloves of garlic.

My husband and eight-year-old daughter loved this!  The only change I would make is to add diced peeled potatoes--we all thought they were missing.  The biscuits on top rather than the pie crust made preparation much quicker.

I thought this was pretty good as is.  A little bland for my families taste.  I would add garlic and maybe green beans to the mix of veggies the next time I make it.  I did love that this recipe didn't used condensed cans of soup...and the sauce was simple.

So good! I used frozen veg (get the good ones, usually organic has the best quality) and boiled some chicken breast in  chicken broth which I found just as easy or easier than cutting up a rotisserie chicken.

Best chicken pot pie I've ever made/had. I added a bit more veg and used a whole rotisserie chicken from the store. To avoid the soggy biscuit issue, I baked my biscuits for 8 minutes, then put them on top to bake on the pie. Turned out perfectly. The biscuits didn't over-brown and were cooked through. Hubby loved it as well. Quite easy to make for a huge flavour return!

I did not have half and half, so I used 1 tablespoon of butter melted and the rest milk to equal 1 cup to substitute for the half and half. I really liked it also.

Yes I will definitely make again. Next time maybe add a little less flour and a little more half and half and broth. The mixture was a little too thick, but maybe I cooked it too long. Otherwise the flavor was awesome!

I made this tonight, my market was out of celery so I substituted with frozen corn. I didn’t have left over chicken so I cooked chicken (set it to the side)  and cooked the onions and carrots in the same pan, i added four cloves of garlic with the peas and corn and once they cooked a few minutes I added some white wine to deglaze the pan. With those alterations it was the most balanced dish I’ve ever made. Extremely worth it!

So simple yet so delicious!  I loved the made from scratch cream-gravy instead of a can of cream something.  My 10 year old daughter actively helped and wants to add it to her dinner recipes.  Made it in a cast iron skillet and finished in oven - easy clean up too!

Made this twice now, and love it! Second time I made it I skipped the biscuits and served over egg noodles - yum! If you keep the filling separate you can eat this over noodles or with biscuits, however you like, and keeps well for leftovers!

Used a can of peas on hand, and used season salt for more flavor. I halved the biscuits like others have suggested so it would cook quicker. Cooked the rest of the biscuits for more on the side. Will make again!

This was amazing!  I made it almost exactly like the recipe.   I didn't have fresh carrots or frozen peas so I used canned of both.   I also used regular chicken broth since I didnt have any low sodium. 
For the chicken, I put a couple chicken breasts in the oven with chicken broth, onion, garlic and parsley and let it cook for several hours - then shredded it.  
Everyone went back for seconds!!  This is definatly a keeper recipe but next time I will try to lower sodium chicken broth since it was a tad too salty.  I may also double the recipe (except the biscuits)

Yum! I made this with fresh chicken and fresh mushrooms-using what I had on hand. Peas, too, of course. The only other thing I added to the recipe was Worcestershire sauce-perked up the flavor a lot!

Easy and deliciois!  I added poultry seasoning and a dash or worchester sauce for added fkavor. I also took the advice of another reviewer who halved the biscuits so they were thinner and cooked faster. This was a big hit and a gorgeous dish. I wish I had taken a picture...but I will make it again!!!!

This a fabulous recipe.  I used a package of frozen vegetables that I microwaved for about 5 minutes.  I also cut up a potato into  small pieces and boiled for 5 minutes and added that to the mix.  I  sliced the biscuits horizontally  and used the half biscuits for my topping.  I sprayed the biscuits with butter pam and sprinkled some garlic salt on top before baking.   It looked beautiful when done and everyone raved about it.

First time making it and my family loved it! I used the regular size pillsbury biscuits and cut them in half. I added a chicken bullion cube as suggested by another reviewer  to give a little extra flavor.  I would recommend cutting the biscuits in half so they can cook better. Besides that I didn't change anything else and it was great!!

This was really easy and fast to make.  I cooked everything in a dutch oven so I didn't need to use another pan to bake.  I cooked chicken breast with salt and pepper in the dutch oven and set aside. I added the butter to the pan drippings for more flavor to cook the rest of the ingredients.  Other than that, I didn't change a thing.  My family enjoyed this and it is delicious on a cold weekday night.  Thank you for the great recipe!

I’ve been using this site for years and I’ve never posted, but believe me when i say: this recipe is OUTSTANDING. I followed it exactly and I used the grands biscuits. The only thing i’d change really is the biscuits. Another user suggested cutting them in half and i think thats a good idea. They were a little doughy on the bottom. Either that or maybe i’ll pre cook the biscuits part of the way and then lay them on top. Otherwise this recipe is GREAT and I’m definitely putting this in standard rotation.

I made this recipe EXACTLY as it is posted.  It was the most delicious version of pot pie that I have ever made.  Thank you so much for this recipe.  I strongly recommend that anyone wishing to try this recipe does not change it at all.  I will double the recipe next time and share with a neighbor! :)

I made this last night and it was soooo good. I cooked it all in my cast iron pan like the picture. Next time I will add a little more filling and maybe use half of the biscuits if using the grands.  I also added a few shakes of poultry seasoning.  It was creamy and had great taste.  did not do the egg wash. I will make this again.  Thank you for the great recipe!

Made as written.  Loved, loved it.  However, the only thing I didn't like was the biscuit didn't cook all the way through.  I think next time I will separate the biscuits in half.

this is a really good, simple recipe. I did however make an adjustment, i used the red lobster cheddar biscuit mix instead of the canned biscuits. Made the biscuit recipe as normal, then topped my pot pie mixture with the dough. it did take about 10 mins longer in the oven until the biscuits were golden brown.

Made exactly as written except I didn't have peas so used 1 c of frozen green beans. Yum! Ultimate comfort food. Next time I will add a little garlic but not necessary to change a thing!

I made this for the FIRST time yesterday.  It was so easy and so good!!  Next time I have to remove the peas (hubby hates peas) and I will add potatoes instead, and keep my carrot chunks bigger and add a bit more liquid......but even though he hates peas he ate it all (less the peas) and loved it....

I didn't really make any changes. I used mini biscuits. This was delicious. I used the skillet for both stove top and in the oven.  This is definitely one I will keep in my cooking rotation. It will be great with leftover turkey too! So glad I tried this one.

I added potatoes, which my husband insisted on and which I find adds even more to the pie. I also make a vegan pie for myself, so I use the same ingredients that contain animal products by using plant based substitutes. I am making it again today.

This is a great recipe, excellent comfort food on a cold Saturday.  I used chicken thighs, poached and reserved the strained liquid to use in place of canned stock.  I also used evaporated milk instead of cream.  I sautéed the vegetables my Le Creuset stock pot, added the rest of the ingredients, and put it right from the stovetop into the oven.   I'll make this again!

Being a bachelor; I used a can of Celery Soup for the celery portion. Wasted celery bunches??
Added 2 small cloves of garlic to my tastes as well. Using fresh ground black pepper is nice too.
White pepper is a hidden item it that is to your preferences.

I doctored it a little because of ingredients I had on hand, and to lower the calorie count... and even using things like fat-free evaporated milk instead of half and half it was SIMPLY DELICIOUS! The hubby ate two huge helpings and said I should make this one again! He NEVER says that! lol Pam, thanks so much for sharing this fabulous recipe, it's going to see a lot of use in my kitchen! (No more tossing out that left over chicken, and can't wait to try it with turkey!)

Simple and delicious! I only used the dried thyme and added about 1/4-1/2tsp of poultry seasoning. I've made this several times and ultimately ended up using croissants instead of biscuits due to the ratio of filling to crust being a little heavy on the biscuit side. I would suggest, if you prefer the biscuits, to cut them in half so you get more filling. A+

This is my third time making this recipe. It’s a solid pot pie dish. This time I did add a little shredded potatoes and corn since I didn’t have enough celery and carrot and it still came out delicious. I always add more seasoning. A little garlic, some onion powder, and herbs de Provence.

The sauce was excellent!  Didn’t have dried thyme so substituted 1/8 tsp ground thyme and added one clove minced garlic.  My hubby frowned at the thought of the big biscuits instead of pie crust but took the advice of others and used the crescent rolls instead.  I had an 8” x 8” pyrex, just a little stretch and the crescent dough was doubled on top and came out just like pie crust, cooked in 20 minutes.  Didn’t have peas so added a medium potato cubed and cooked when adding the chicken.  Definitely a keeper and will work well I’m sure with all that leftover turkey.  Thanks so much for the recipe!!

Made it to recipe and it was fantastic.  Made a double batch using G free flour and put 1/3 in a GF pie crust for my wife.  We are both in love with this recipe and it will not be long before making it again.

This is delicious.  The only change I would make is what another reviewer suggested:  put the biscuits in the oven 7 minutes or so before you place them on top of the pie and put it in the oven.  I tried separating the flaky biscuits into 3 layers, but it was kinda difficult  and I missed having a full size biscuit on top instead of a fairly skinny little biscuit.    Plus I have 2 and a half leftover raw biscuits in the refrigerator.  This recipe will be my go to chicken pot pie recipe from now on!

Nice and rich. It's the ultimate comfort food. I'm pretty fond of my own homemade baking soda biscuits, so that's what I topped the chicken mixture with. I just needed to bake it a little bit longer to brown the biscuits nicely. I'd like to try it next time in a vol au vent. The puff pastry would go nicely with this recipe.

Made it t but made many changes and made it my own started on cook top, moved to oven.
2 c cream of celery, 2 carrots cut up, 1-onion, (I love garlic) so cut @ minced full clove, 3 celery stalks, 1-c chicken broth, 1-can chicken, added 1- kielbasa cut slim, 6- small red potatoes, 1-C chicken broth, 1 C milk w/ vinegar to substitute for cream.
I sauted garlic, onion in 1 tsp olive oil, added celery then carrots, broth, cans of cream of celery soup. After seasoning everything with this and that, Italian seasoning (no salt) added red potatoes on cook top (stove) 10 min between saute and boiling all flavors together w/chick & kielbasa.
  (cooked potatoes on micro for 5 min first) then combined in bowl.  Cooked in oven °375/convect  °400 reg temp w/o biscuits for 40 min first then removed added rolled out jiffy biscuits, cooked for 10-15 min longer  checked until biscuits were brown all in 9x13 glass pan. Nice recipe idea.  I made it my own with base ingredients, did not need flour at all.

OMG so good!! Thank you. All most followed the recipe.  Used Red Lobster cheddar bay biscuit mix. I baked it for 20-25 min at 425. Not much left to take a picture of. I used my cast iron Dutch Oven.

Made exactly as directed, except I cut my biscuits in half since I was short on time and didn’t have the time to wait for them to take longer.   I really liked the way the biscuits came out, with the egg yolk on top.  My kids were thrilled to have plain biscuits anyway.  Rotisserie chicken made this fast.   The most time consuming part was cutting the veggies.  I also used a pot that could go from the stove to the oven so clean up was a breeze.   My five stars are based on decent flavor (though I’m not a fan of thyme so I’ll substitute something else next time),  and ease of the recipe.

I give this 4 starts because it was easy to make, and it tasted very good.  I made some changes because I didn't have all the ingredients and I was making if for young teens girls that don't like onions or celery.  I used green beans instead of peas and I added corn and it turned out great.  I asked my daughter how she and all her friends liked it and she said that they loved it.  I told her I would definitely make it again.

Love this recipe with minor tweaks!! Added a little oregano, added a cup of diced potatoes, used butter flaky crescent rolls (flattened and cut with pizza cutter into squares). Placed dough throughout dish and top. With my oven cooked for almost an hour to get the potatoes soft. I also used 1/2 cup margarine (1 stick) and 1 cup of flour. super tasty!!!

Can't stand peas (yeah, I know, sacrilege).

So we're gonna try it with broccoli instead...add sliced taters...and quite a bit more onion than called for.  I'll keep ya posted.

Love this recipe!  I often double it.  I make the chicken "gravy" and bake the biscuits separately.   I've  also served it over hashbrowns, and over toast.  Delicious!

This was a delicious pot pie but I can't give it five stars because I made some changes.  First, I used a combo of olive oil and butter; I didn't have cream so I used evaporated milk; and, third, I used the homemade biscuit recipe from this site on top.  We both enjoyed this dish and I was advised that I could make it anytime.  Thanks for a tasty pot pie.

I may have written a prior review - not sure. But just to pass the word, this is a great and easy recipe. I've probably made it 6-8 times, following recipe, and it never fails. I use canned biscuits and tear them in half because I don't like lots of the crusty/doughy stuff. As another reviewer suggested, I make it in my iron skillet for a one pot meal. Really good! As for biscuits, I use the Grands, 5 count, tear them in half to make 10 and find of stretch them a bit, and they cover perfectly, puff up, and cook thoroughly. I do watch the salt as the broth can be a bit salty. I just add to taste after cooking.

I made the recipe to the T and it tasted amazing! My husband and I both went back for seconds. I may have added too much salt but that's my own fault. My oven is not the best so after baking for 20 minutes the top was nice and brown but the biscuits  were not cooked all the way through. I covered with tin foil and baked for another 10-15 minutes checking on it every 4-5 minutes. Perfection!

This is the BEST chicken pot pie I have ever eaten.  Its excellent.  I only made one change.  I used rotisserie chicken broth instead of regular chicken broth.  I will definitely made this again.  Hubby and my Dad both loved it.

This is a very good recipe, though I don't like using store bought biscuits, so I mixed up some Bisquick and dropped that on top by spoonfuls and it worked superbly.  I also added a few mushroom slices and it was all very tasty.

Being a less than mediocre cook I rarely have recipes turn out just right the first try, this one was a welcomed exception!! Being a Kansas girl I HAD to add potatoes so I cut back on the celery by half, added 3 diced potatoes, and a little extra butter, flour and half&half. This was a HUGE hit at home, my family of 6 "foodies" really enjoyed it. Thanks!!!

Great Recipe. I  didn't have celery and had to make do without it - and it turned out great still. Would have even been better had I had the celery. I made mine in my dutch oven, and it was easy to make and clean. My husband loved it and we ate on it for a couple days after! It does microwave well, considering we didn't separate the biscuits out. I do think it got  a little think on me, I might consider adding a bit less thickener to keep it a little more runny. Other than that, Awesome recipe and a keeper for me!

I really enjoyed this dish.  I made a few minor changes based on other's reviews, which proved quite helpful.  I added two cloves of  chopped garlic.  I finely chopped most of the veggies to make a mirepoix.  I saved some of the carrots and celery, slicing them and par cooking them in the microwave prior to adding them at the same time as the frozen peas. I used Bisquick mix to make very "goopy" dumplings on top, making sure to allow about 1" between the dollops to  allow for complete cooking.

Awesome recipe!  This was a classic, easy and FLAVORFUL recipe.  Not a drop left over. After reading the reviews, I brushed my biscuits with egg wash and placed in preheated 350 degree oven for about 7 minutes. Then I layered six biscuits on top of hot filling and baked in oven for 25 minutes. The biscuits were cooked beautifully and the meal was complete. I will definitely add this to my recipe rotation. Thank you!

Made this with slight modifications with what was in my fridge and pantry: frozen mixed veggies and heavy whipping cream instead of half and half, and I added sage along with dry parsley. Super yummy! Came out perfect! Hubby loves it! He sprinkles Cajun seasoning on his for a bit of a kick. Will be making this again.

EASY TASTY  Quite good.  I followed recipe and added corn
and green beans with a little cooking sherry to sauce at the end. I did not do biscuits, I made slow cooker mashed potatoes for it.  Very Good

This was excellent. I added frozen corn to the mix right before I put it into the oven and also added a little red pepper flakes. I used pillsbury crescent rolls instead of the biscuits to give it a flaky crust on top. Whole family loved!!

This is a fantastic easy dish.  The only change I will make in the future is replacing the celery with broccoli.  My kids just hate celery and I couldn't get it past them.  But other then making sure I split the biscuits in half to ensure they cooked, I did it exactly the same.

This was great! I read about how others added changes ex. Adding chopped potatoes. I cooked the potatoes in a separate pan with half of the chicken broth until almost cooked, then combined the potatoes and broth in at the same time that you add the peas. I will make this again. The boyfriend and I went back for 3rds.

Really good! Used the leftover turkey bits after cleaning the carcass following Thanksgiving. Family was overjoyed with it.  I liked that it was like a pot pie, but didn't require a crust.

I cut the biscuits in half horizontally as suggested by another review and it turned out wonderfully! My husband, who had been requesting I make a pot pie because he loves them, called this a glorified version of a pot pie! Pretty nice compliment, I thought! :)

My husband and I loved this recipe. I made almost exactly as written, only used fresh thyme instead of dried. As other reviewers mentioned, I bought the mini biscuits (versus full sized) and pulled them thin to cover the dish, they baked perfectly after 20 minutes in the oven. Added cornstarch slurry to thicken since other reviews said it was too runny. My husband said "This is a keeper!"

Definitely boyfriend tested and approved! He ate half the pan. I followed the recipe exactly - except no fresh parsley, just dried! It was delicious.. really good comfort food and really, really easy. 

I used the biscuits the recipe suggested, and split them in half before layering on the top just to make sure they cooked through. Baked for 25 minutes and it was perfect!

I can't believe how easy yet delicious this was.  It was a huge hit with my children.  I may either do less biscuits next time or more of the pot pie to even out the ratio of sauce to biscuits.  The flavor was heavenly!  It was perfect for a very cold evening.

Fabulous!  I used this recipe as a jumping off point for chicken and dumplings.  I did add some poultry seasoning, dill, and onion powder (no onions).  Thanks for the inspiration!

I used this dish as a first recipe for my 12 yr old daughter to try with supervision of course.  It was absolutely delicious and easy to make.  We will definitely make this again.

I was so tempted to add garlic and potatoes, as some reviewers suggested, but I decided to make it exactly as recipe states.  SO GLAD I DID!!  It was better than I even imagined it could taste!  My husband went back for 'thirds' and my picky son went back for seconds--that NEVER happens.  I was hoping to get 2 meals out of this, but only a very small serving leftover.  I followed one reviewers comment that she put it all together in her Dutch oven, then stuck that in the oven.   Did the same, and it worked out.  However, next time I'm going to try a smaller casserole dish to bake it in.  Because I used an 8-qt Dutch oven, the biscuits took longer to cook and brown---baked it for over 1/2 hour before they were browned enough.  OH, and I used the Grands Jrs, too.

This one's a keeper!

Its awesome n sooooo yummy and hearty. Only changes i made was i used cornstarch with a 1/4 cup of milk n 1 of the 2 cups of broth called for in this receipe. I wisked the milk, corn starch and 1 cup of broth in a cup and thrn added it to the rest of the pot with the flour already cooked in the pot prior to adding my corn starch. And i made hime made biscuits with a dolup of honey. Placed them on top after baking them half way first. It will be a new favorite in the colder months for sure.

I don't like cooked celery, so replaced it with some frozen broccoli and one diced russet potato.  The wife gave it two-thumbs up.  It is very good and very hearty!  Had plenty of liquid for the added veggies.

Didn't have peas, green beans worked very nicely.  The sauce was a little thin, next time I would use more flour. Tasted just like a Marie Callender pot pie

Before I try a new recipe I read the reviews and suggestions, the only thing I added to this recipe was garlic. When I try a new recipe I always ask my husband if it's a keeper and this one is a keeper! I myself have never been big for pot pies but this recipe is delicious!!!

This is a wonderful dish!  My fiancé said it was 'perfect'.  The only difference was that I had forgotten to buy peas, but i had some cooked leftover green beans that I added in with the chicken instead of them.   Also I forgot to add the TBS of water to the egg yolk (lol) but the biscuits looked absolutely beautiful anyway.  I'll definitely make this again.

Followed recipe except when it came to the biscuits. I looked at other comments that showed them to be doughy. So I cooked them for half the time showed on package then put them on top. They turned out cooked all the way though. Good recipe!!!

My family LOVED this! The kids were scooping it out of the skillet with a spoon before I could even get it in the oven. :) I made very few changes. I used a Publix rotisserie mojo chicken, which yields around 3-3 1/2 cups when well-picked. I used 4 carrots, 2 ribs of celery, 1/2 a sweet onion, and I substituted corn for the peas, because my family likes corn better. Like some other reviewers, I used Pillsbury Grands *Junior* size biscuits so they would cook well, and I made extra biscuits on the side. I was tempted to thicken up the sauce with cornstarch, but was glad I didn't. By the time it simmered for a while and I added the chicken, it thickened right up on its own. My family loved this, and I will definitely make it again!
*11/12/15: Made this for the second time tonight and it's still a hit! I used the regular sized Grands biscuits this time and it turned out fine. Cooked the whole thing, from start to finish, in my new pre-seasoned cast iron deep skillet and it turned out fantastic. And only one pot to clean is always a plus ;) This recipe is definitely in my rotation of favorite meals now!

Simple and delicious! You can add any veggies that suit you. I always add a clove of minced garlic and I often add sauteed mushrooms as well. But the key to nicely baked biscuits is to make sure the filling is bubbling hot BEFORE adding the biscuits on top. So either heat it through thoroughly on the stove, then add biscuits and place in oven, or put the filling in the oven until nice and bubbly, then add biscuits and continue baking until they are baked through. Enjoy!!

I followed the recipe exactly, though I might add more carrots/vegetables next time.  We loved this recipe!  I followed another reviewer's advice & made the whole thing in a cast iron skillet & then baked it.  It looked fantastic.  We'll have this again, definitely.

Loved it! Prepared exactly as written, although I substituted fresh parsley for dried, as I didn't have any fresh, but it still turned out very delicious! The Grands were a bit thick for my oven (it's old), so I might try thinner biscuits next time -- but that's my oven and not the recipe. I will definitely make this again!!

This is really good! I cooked two boneless chicken breasts in butter, garlic and poultry seasoning in my cast iron skillet, then cut it up and set it aside to add when the other ingredients were ready.I used Grands butter biscuits for the crust. I also added a teaspoon of chopped jarred garlic while cooking up the carrots and onions.

I thought the sauce was a little bland, so I added extra red pepper, garlic powder, lemon juice with a teaspoon of sugar, and a splash of Brandy.  Wow!  Chicken Pot pie with zing, zest, and depth.  It tasted  gourmet.  Great recipe.

Love the conept of th biscuit crust, but i just does not work.  Th top of the biscuits are cooked, but the underside is raw dough, because of how they settle into the filling.  The filling flavor was fine, but there needs to be a better crust.

Loved this recipe. SO EASY! Perfect as it is... BUT  only because my family loves mushrooms did I change it very slightly... I added 16oz sliced mushrooms putting them in when the celery and carrots were half done. Because I added mushrooms I increased the butter to 5 tablespoons... and flour to 1/3 cup to soak up the moisture from the mushrooms.  The 5 stars is still for the original recipe... it's a winner!

This recipe was fantastic! It was slightly time consuming since I was working without chicken broth and needed to make my own from scratch, but worth it in the end! The filling came out creamy and the biscuit crust was the perfect combination of buttery and flaky. Will definitely make this again!

I didn't change anything. But would add another cup of chicken broth and maybe another 1/4 cup of half and half, for more liquid. I like my chicken pies a little soupy and that would be perfect. It was great! So glad I found it!

Easy and delicious!  I didn't think the bread would cook all the way through but it did.  The whole thing turned out amazing!

My family really liked this recipe.  I did omit any extra salt as there was enough even with low sodium stock or broth.  I did take the advice of another review and made it in my cast iron skillet and it turned out great.  I did half the biscuits to make it thinner.  Next time I will make scratch biscuits as I like the taste of them better.

Fantastic recipe!  Definitely use the smaller biscuits if available or the dough will not cook thoroughly on the bottom. I also started to cook them separately in the oven at the same time and 5 minutes before the chicken mix is done, I add them on top so they are not gummy.

My family loves this recipe!  It is easy, yet delicious!  I prepared it the first time according to the recipe.  The next time I used a bag of the frozen mixed veggies and it was just as delicious!

1/14 i had alot of leftover chicken and turkey so i only used half the gravy this recipe made.  i also used a bag of frozen mixed vegies.  I baked the biscuits for about 8 min until the bottoms were firm then put them on top of the casserole and let them cook the rest of the way.  it was pretty good, a good way to use up the extra meat.

pre-bake the biscuits and then set them on top to continue baking. They didn't quite bake through all the way.

To be honest I didn't follow the recipe as is because I only had carrots, broccoli, corn and onions. But, the timing was spot on and after reading other reviews, I did cut the biscuits in half. I also took the other half of biscuits and created one layer for the bottom, baking for about five minutes, then added the filing and remaining biscuits, topped with egg wash and parsley and baked!!! Great base recipe thanks :-) *my 3yr old picky son enjoyed helping cook and eating this dish...

This is the second time I've made this and it is just delicious. I add broccoli and some potatoes as well. I doubled it and found that I didn't need as much liquid as it called for, so omitted some. The first time I made this I used biscuits and they were crispy on top and soft on the bottom (like a dumpling) and this time I used crescent rolls on top. I also used 2% milk instead of half and half. Perfect for a fall/winter dinner.

I don't know if it was something I did, if it was the ingredients or if it was just not our taste, but no one in my family cared for this. I still gave it three stars because it wasn't inedible, but I won't make it again, even with changes to make it more appealing to my family.

This recipe looks great in a picture, but the biscuits don't cook.   I thought ....well even it is like a dumpling texture that would be fine.  My biscuit dough was completely raw.  So the picture looks great, but it would have been easier to cook the biscuit separate.

Great recipe! I cook gluten free for my allergy prone family, so I made some gluten free biscuits in the morning and used them instead of the pre made ones. I also threw in all of the roasted veggies I'd made with the chicken the night before. Awesome!!

I made this recipe tonight for dinner and we absolutely loved it!  This is one of those recipes that is easy to put together on a weeknight.  I had made a chicken earlier this week and had some leftover chicken stock and chicken from that. The only complaint I have is that the filling was a little thick, so next time I think I'm going to add a little more cream. Will definitely make this again and add to the fall rotation :)

I made this today for dinner and it was truly wonderful.  I used poultry seasoning instead of thyme and fresh snow peas rather than frozen peas (not a fan of peas).  I also added cremini mushrooms to the other veggies.  This is a keeper.

I had to make a couple of minor changes to use what I had, but followed the recipe closely. I used a 12 oz can of Grands jr biscuits instead of the 16 oz can, and dried parsley instead of fresh ( although I'm sure fresh would have been better).  I kept everything else the same with excellent results.  My husband LOVED it and the kids liked it fine.  The only thing I would do differently is cut the biscuits in quarters before adding...some of the ones in the middle were still on the doughy side underneath even though they were nicely browned on top.  This took awhile to put together but was easy and much better than premade pot pies.  Great comfort food on a chilly day!  Thanks for sharing.

I made this last night and it turned out great.  Instead of fresh vegetables and chopped fresh parsley, I just bought a can of mixed vegetables and parsley seasoning (from our spice rack) and used those.  It sped the process up a lot and still taste great.  

I used a 2 quart baking dish as recommended, however mine was too large and it actually took 2 cans of biscuits to cover the top completely.  Also, because of the size of the dish, the pot pie was a little too thin underneath the biscuits.  If you use a 2 quart dish, I'd recommend one smaller with higher sides.

Very delicious!  I made this recipe as written except using dried parsley because I did not have any fresh.  I did follow another reviewers suggestion and sliced my biscuits in half so that they were not so thick and they cooked beautifully.  This is a keeper that I will definitely be making again.  I used leftover rotisserie chicken this time.

I loved this!  I used dried parsley flakes only because I forgot to buy fresh at the store.  Rubbed 3 chicken breast with EVOO, added sea salt and fresh ground pepper.  Perfect amount of chicken.  Followed another suggestion and cooked entire thing in my iron skillet.  It's good reheated except biscuits get a bit soggy and tough in microwave.  With that in mind, it does make a huge amount for one person and with grocery prices so high, I refuse to waste anything.  I'm going to try freezing some of the filling, thawing, heating and topping with a biscuit for individual servings. Definitely a keeper!

This is wonderful!  First time making chicken pot pie and didn't have any pie crust on hand so searched for a biscuit top version.  So glad I picked this one!  It was DELICIOUS!  I boiled a package of chicken tenderloins while I sauteed the carrots, celery, and onion, and then just did a rough chop on the chicken.  Didn't change anything except I didn't use parsley because I didn't have any, and I used 2% milk in place of half & half (because that's all I had), so I ended up adding a little extra flour to thicken it up, didn't seem to make a difference or hurt anything at all!  The thyme is what makes it so good.  Turned out awesome, and the whole family loved it, even the man who hates carrots, celery AND onions!!!!!!  YUM!

This was awesome. Made as is, with 2 exceptions due to what I had on hand. Used corn instead of peas and used regular milk instead of half and half. It was perfect. I will make again for sure!

Yum. Great recipe! I used a cut up rotisserie chicken and it turned out amazing. I'd bake it at 400 next time though because the biscuits were pretty underdone.

Very good! I would reccommend baking the bisquits separately - mine were very doughy the 2nd time i made this.  The 1st time I did not put them on top and this was really great

We've made this several times, always to rave reviews!  It's a super make ahead meal.  We make the filling, but do not bake it with the biscuits on top.  Instead we bake the biscuits off separately.  To serve the next day we reheat the filling on the stove top and serve it spooned over split biscuits.  Delish!

I'm always on the lookout for recipes to use leftover chicken. A week ago I roasted a whole chicken, so guess what i had a lot of? Made this today. I heeded the advise to split the biscuits, and used some sage in the mixture. My wife and kids loved it. Good stuff!

The only vegetable I had were carrots and celery, so I changed big-time. I used asparagus, broccoli, fresh instead of dried thyme, and milk (no 1/2  & 1/2).  This was the best chicken pot pie I've ever tasted, and that includes some pretty pricy restaurants.
Must the the basics...mostly the preparation and sauce I guess.  The Best.

This is fabulous, didn't change a thing.  I did take the advice of others and cut the biscuits in half to insure that they cooked through, and I'm glad I did.  Will definitely put this into my rotation.  Thanks!

Loved this recipe and it made enough for leftovers for work.  I upped the spices a little bit since it seemed a little bland before I put the biscuits on top but otherwise followed the recipe and it was easy to put together.

I'm not much of a cook, but this recipe sounded relatively simple and we had some leftover store-bought rotisserie chicken I wanted to use up.I was a little skeptical that my wife and picky 
teen-age son would like it as much as some of the other reviews. Well, I was wrong! They both each had 2 helpings, and as my wife left the house for work this morning, she said she's planning on having the remainder for supper tonight!The only thing I'll change about it next time is to perhaps add some diced potato, but this really is a great recipe...and if I can make it, anyone can. -Terry S, Denver, CO

We enjoyed this. I didn't have an onion on hand so I substituted 1 tablespoon of onion flakes. I think I would have enjoyed it more with the onion. I was out of peas so I used 1/3 c corn and 1/3 c green peppers. I'll be making this again with leftover chicken. I might add some garlic like another reviewer suggested.

This is delicious!!  I made it exactly like the recipe except that I used homemade chicken stock (made in the crock pot) and leftover roast lemon chicken. I have made this previously with Costco roast chicken and store bought chicken stock. It’s a win-win any way you make it!!

I followed this recipe but didn't have celery and instead of chopping everything, i shredded it or cut it thin.  I shredded the chicken and the carrots.  cut the onion very thin pieces about an inch long.  it was all the same flavors but a different eating experience. I also portioned this out between three foil loaf pans, wrote the cooking directions, +50 degrees in the oven and 1hr of baking, on the foil sheet before covering and freezing.

I used leftover turkey from Thanksgiving I had in the freezer.  Biscuits were a bit doughy underneath I think because I pushed them down too much, but it was still delicious.  My husband also ate 4 bowls!

We enjoyed this recipe very much, however next time I will make my own biscuits and use a rotisserie chicken instead. Also I didn't have Thyme, so instead used Sage and it was delicious.

We made this dish and enjoyed it very much. We did modify it slightly by pulling the biscuits in half and covering the top completely.

Made it just as directed,  with the exception of making it in an iron fry pan from start to finish.
This was very easy and very tasty. It was a good quick lunch for Mom and the kids when they came in from sledding. I did use a rotisserie chicken.
I will make this again.

Absolutely YUM! Very easy to make and quite the satisfying treat. This is not the recipe to make though if you're worried about fat and sodium.

When the biscuit top were toasty brown the lower half was still doughy.  If I make this again I would divide the biscuits in half.

Delicious! Excellent base recipe! My husband said it was incredible. I made mine in the cast iron skillet. Only changes I made were to add a little more peas and add potatoes. I like potatoes in my pot pie. So I cut up about a cup of petite golden potatoes and boiled them until you can pierce with a fork. Then I added them at the same time as the chicken. I used a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store. I also baked the biscuits for 6 minutes by themselves before putting on top of the pie after reading a few comments that said the biscuits did not cook through. So good we will make this often!

Followed the recipe and baked for 25 minutes but the biscuits were still a bit doughy on the bottom. Next time I’ll give it another 5 minutes. Delicious!!

My husband is hard to please. HE LOVED IT! He said it tastes like KFC pot pie. That’s an honor. I loved it too. I will say that I would have to add a little more flour to thicken. But will see how it is as left overs. Great recipe thx

Wonderful recipe - wanted to use up the leftover turkey and this was perfect.  Didn't have quite enough meat so cut back on the ingredients by about 1/3.  This was fast, easy and delicious.  I did bake my biscuits separately; we don't like soggy bottoms.  Will definitely make again - would be perfect for leftover rotisserie chicken.

Good! Thanks for posting. Now, for those who are not fond of peas, substitute something you like, such as zucchini or green beans. Also works with leftover Thanksgiving turkey, too. Works great!

I've made this twice now & love it. Of course I slightly modify the recipe each time, that's what I do.  Both times I've used the already premade frozen biscuit, not in can as this recipe calls for and I will continue to do so because I like this type of biscuit better.  Although the 1st time I made I used only 6 biscuits, which cooked thoroughly and evenly around sides of biscuits due to extra spacing between biscuits. However the 2nd time I made I put 8 biscuits which took longer to cook sides of biscuits, due to less spacing, touching each other. They turned out a little gummy, so I  kept cooking until more evenly cooked around the sides. Also more biscuits seemed to take up more moisture/liquid from remainder of dish. To me main part of having biscuit it to enjoy sopping up that gravy. Although both times my genuine pigs (LOL) loved it.  This recipe is a keeper with only 6 frozen premade biscuits. Super easy and less mess than chicken and dumplings.

I used regular chicken broth with extra bullion cubes, instead of adding salt, and I added corn to the vegetables, and rosemary to the seasonings.  Very good, and much easier and quicker than pie dough

I have never liked chicken pot pie-the traditional stuff I remember eating as a kid was awful but this recipe looked to delicious to pass up and I was right!

No frozen veggies and a delicious sauce with the biscuits all put a great spin on this classic. (And there's actually a fabulous amount of topping to filling ratio)

Took a little bit more prep time than anticipated but definitely worth it! And despite using a pan and not a cooking dish, the pie actually held together really well and didn't slop everywhere.

Also, I accidentally bought Honey Butter Grands biscuits but would HIGHLY recommend because this blunder made it taste even better

I did not make any changes and my family thought it was delicious.  It took a bit longer than the recipe called for though.  I did not find that the carrots were tender enough for me in 15min at medium low.  Baking time was nearly double as well.  I would still make this again.

Added a little garlic salt and some Ortega chilies to make it more exciting.  Easy and filling.

I made this today, and my family and I loved it.  It was not difficult, I had all the ingredients (except the biscuits ) on hand already.  Very tasty.  Perfect for a cool fall evening.

Agree with many other reviewers, this is the best chicken pot pie recipe I've ever found, delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly, but used Pillsbury refrigerated pie crusts instead of canned biscuits.  I used one crust to line the bottom of the pan, pierce bottom and sides, and bake for 8 minutes or until light brown.  Add filling on top of bottom/baked crust, then cover with top crust, pierce to vent, then bake per instructions.  Wonderful!

I made this in my cast iron skillet. Presentation was lovely. It was easy enough and turned out nicely and had a good flavor but it didn't have that AH factor. I was expecting my husband wouldn't like it since he is picky and doesn't like cooked carrots but he said it was good and the textures didn't bother him. He thought the biscuits on top didn't flow with the rest of the recipe. If I made it again, I might try making my own homemade baking powder biscuits so they would be crunchier on top.

Yum! I hate to cook, but this seemed simple enough and perfect for fall!
I did not want to waste the extra bisquits so I cut them up and plugged the holes in between the six bisquits!

I recommend baking the biscuits separate then place on top when serving, otherwise the bottoms never cook and remain doughy. I also added a bunch more seasonings like celery salt, sage and cayenne pepper.

This stuff is insanely good. I don’t like chicken...but it’s so good that I double it and do one pan without chicken and use a really good chicken base and we can’t get enough! I use extra thyme, salt and pepper and I use heavy cream. (If you are going to eat comfort food, make it worth the calories!) I use a little extra flour and cook it off really well before adding the peas so it doesn’t smoosh them. I’m making it tonight for my husband’s birthday. We have four kids and even with the recipe doubled, there won’t be leftovers.

Made this for dinner last night -- it came out amazing.
I poached a couple of chicken breasts and added a few more herbs.
This is definitely a keeper -- and perfect for a weeknight dinner.

I was pleasantly surprised - it was delicious! My whole family liked it and it got eaten up in one night (just what a cook likes to see). I liked it better than chicken pot pie made with pie crust. I used thigh meat and added garlic and potatoes. You can add whatever filling you like. Maybe next time I will add mushrooms. It almost reminded me of the chicken friand dish from Le Madeline lol! Recipe is definitely a keeper!

I prefer a creamier sauce so I put in 2 cups of half and half (versus 2 cups of chicken broth) and 1 cup of broth. This makes a much thicker version. Great recipe!

Pretty tasty.  My husband liked it, too.  My grandson ate most of one serving, even though he said he didn't like it.  I substituted heavy cream and low-fat milk for the half-and-half since I didn't have any half-and-half on hand.  Only thing that went wrong was that I didn't bake it long enough and at least one biscuit wasn't fully cooked (I judged by the very brown appearance of the biscuits that they were done; next time, I won't use the egg-wash).

I took a hint from LALAFLUTIST and prepared and baked this in my cast iron skillet.  Fortunately I had the sense to put a cookie sheet under it because it did overflow.  The recipe  allows a lot of leeway for amounts of vegetables and chicken, and although I didn't add any vegetables not included in the recipe,  if you feel like it, go for it.   If you go by the color of the biscuits, not by the time elapsed, I don't think you will have any problem with underdone biscuits.  Let them get nice and brown.  (I didn't use the egg wash).   Overall it was a satisfying dish.  Not the best chicken pot pie I've ever had, but good enough.

I followed the recipe almost exactly, except I had to cook the chicken breast, which wasn't a problem.  It took me longer to make it since I'm pretty slow at prep work.  I made it with the biscuits for the family but since I don't eat biscuits, I ate mine over brown rice and it was quite good that way too!  I will probably make it again.

I've been making this for years. My husband asks for it at least once a week. This time, I added about 1/4 C of white wine with the chicken broth and let it burn off before adding the half and half. SO GOOD. I used pinot since I was drinking it at the time, but I bet any white would work. ; )

I decided to bake the biscuits separately, to avoid soggy biscuits (I store leftovers separately as well). I just place them on a baking sheet (or on a griddle, if we're camping) then bake everything, according to directions and time everything to be done at the same time. Everyone just scoops a helping of the yummy filling into a bowl and takes a biscuit or two. Nobody leaves the dinner table until they're unable to eat another bite! I love using my cast iron, so this is definitely a keeper!

This was great! I have some picky eaters in my home, so I made the following changes to the vegetables. I diced two medium potatoes and 2 carrots and cooked them in the 1/4 cup butter with a lid on the pan until they began to soften. Then followed the rest of the recipe as it was written. With eight biscuits on top, my teenager had seconds, my middle schooler said it was good, and my husband and I each had seconds too! Only one biscuit left! That's a success here! The veggie to chicken ratio worked out good!

This is a very good recipe. The only issue I had was the biscuits were still doughy in the middle, while the tops were browned. Had I baked longer the tops would have been over baked. Next time I will use smaller biscuits.

Great recipe.  Thank you!

After reading the reviews, I chose to make this in an iron frying pan so that I had less clean up.  This worked out great.  I didn't use rolls as I had a frozen pie crust in a pan that had been damaged and cracked.  I defrosted it and fitted it over the mixture and it was wonderful.  For those with issues with the grand rolls, I'd check the wrapper and cook at the temp suggested there.  Perhaps 350 is too low to brown them.  I may try a sheet of crescent rolls next time with vent holes.

Perfect! I made in cast iron skillet, so stovetop to oven to table was easy. I split the biscuits in half so everyone would feel like they got plenty on top. This one’s a keeper.

Very tasty!! Would definitely make again, I think it needs a little more aggressive seasoning. I added some minced garlic just before sautéing the onions and that helped add a little extra flavor. Also added a half can of corn to add more veggies.
I’m not a fan of cubes chicken so I low boiled some chicken in some broth and shredded it before adding to the recipe. Which I think looks more homemade than cubed meat anyway! Overall it turned out great!

This is a great from scratch recipe which is easily modified with what you have on hand. I increased the vegetables by 2 cups and that required another cup of flour. The sauce came out thick and creamy. If you are using fresh, raw chicken then boil 1/2 a chicken in a large pot with skin on. This will make for fresh chicken broth and you can remove skin, debone and dice into chunks after boiled. I used some fresh herbs from my garden. If you do not have fresh parsley remember when using dried herbs it requires less. I also used 3 biscuits split in half into 6 discs. I place them in bottom of casserole dish and cook til golden before adding the mixture and remaining 6 biscuits on top. This creates a nice bottom crust.

We loved this, as other cooks recommended, I added some additional seasonings, garlic Mrs dash and sage.  And used biscuit mix to make dough.  I added more onion, and 1 potato.  Even picky kids loved it.

I felt the filling mixture was a little too liquidy. The flavor was OK, perhaps I should’ve used more of a roux.   Also, the biscuits did not get done quite enough on the bottom. Next time, if I make this recipe again, I will add the cooked biscuits on afterwords

I used a little less parsley than suggested and added corn instead of peas. I also finely chopped broccoli to help give it more colour. Turned out wonderful.

The spices are needing a tweak. Way too much of both it over powers the dish. The  biscuits browned nicely and I added more veggies which made it better I think.

A good basic recipe.  I am fond of potatoes in my pot pie so I diced and steamed two of them and added to the mix.  I also made biscuits from scratch instead of Pillsbury which, I admit, made the whole putting together a bit more labor intensive.  Try the Kentucky biscuit recipe on this and be extra pleased with the results.  Then pat yourself on the back for overachieving.  I should mention that I cut back on the carrots and celery to accommodate the addition of the taters.

The filling for this pot pie is so delicious! The first time I used the biscuits. So easy! But I decided I liked it better with a pie crust (top and bottom). It needs to cook at 400 for 40 to 50 minutes with this change. But it's easier to serve and eat with the crust. Also, the pie crust reheats nicely in the microwave, where the biscuits just turned hard and inedible.

Very yummy. Made exactly as stated. As several reviewers, noted the rolls were doughy. I flipped them over and cooked another 15 minutes. Still doughy. Will make again but cook rolls separately or maybe try a 13x9 pan instead of a casserole dish.

My family loved this recipe. I used frozen chicken tenderloins and a breast (what I had). I boiled them in salted water for a a few minutes, turned down the heat and let them simmer while I prepared the rest of the recipe. When the chicken was done, I shredded it. I also used 2 small tbsp of dried parsley because I didn't have fresh. I didn't have half and half so I substituted 1/3 cup Mexican table cream (thin creme fraishe) and 1/3 cup regular soy milk.  I omitted the celery because I didn't have that either.  I used Pillsbury butter tasting flaky biscuits. It turned out great! Thanks for a great recipe. I will share this one with my sister. We always share recipes that are quick and that the whole family will love.

I added 2 more cups of chicken and a can of cream of chicken soup instead of half and half- it thickens it well. I would give it a 5 except biscuits were not done on bottoms.I think mini biscuits would work better and bake well!

Wish I had read more of the reviews prior to making.  The biscuit topping was not fully cooked even after 25 minutes. Next time I will make my own biscuit topping.

Tasty; good base recipe.  I prefer to add sauteed mushrooms; I've also added broccoli florets (cauliflower would be good, too).  I have to suggestions, though:  (1) Don't add the peas while cooking the veggies with the flour -- they end up overcooked after being in the oven.  I add them just before the oven stage - cooking them very briefly on the stove first.   (2) I always increase the sauce quantity -- we like enough sauce to clean up with the biscuits!   (3) It's very easy to make your own homemade biscuit dough -- honest!  The Pilsbury dough is so chemical-tasting (and it IS full of nasty ingredients).    (4)  I've actually stopped putting the raw biscuit dough on top of the stew to cook -- I bake them slightly on a baking sheet first, because them always seem to be too doughy on the bottom/middle, but the tops will burn if cooked long enough to mitigate that.  Yes, the oven temp could be lowered, of course, but that just takes too long!  The biscuits can be baking for a few minutes while you're fiinishing up with the stew on the stove.    One more caution: if you decide to use rotisserie chicken, remember that it is always loaded with salt...

One of my favorite recipes found on this site. Bravo, and thanks for sharing! I will make this again and again. I've always been intimidated by pot pie, but this recipe could not be simpler or more impressive!

Fabulous recipe.  My family has asked me to make this every week for the last month.  I make this in a cast iron skillet start (cooking chicken breast) to finish (baking in oven). No transfer.  Everything else I follow exactly.  I have used low sodium chicken broth and I have used natural low fat swansons broth.  I think I like the low fat better.  My family can not get enough.  Leftovers are easy to Tupperware and reheat next day.  Thank you for a great recipe

This dish is really tasty! The one problem I had is that not all of the biscuits got cooked all the way through.  I baked it for 20 minutes and saw that the pie was bubbling, so I took it out of the oven. When serving it, I had to throw away the middle biscuit because it was all gooey and raw under the baked top! The biscuits on the edge of the dish were cooked through. If I were to make this again I'd bake it for the full 25 minutes instead of just 20.

This was a fantastic recipe! I have been looking for a good, easy chicken pot pie recipe.  I made a few small changes- I didn't use fresh parsley (just the dried kind and not as much as it calls for), and I left out the frozen peas.  I also used heavy cream and milk mixed together and this worked great since I didn't have any half and half.  This was so good and even my picky 7 year old ate it!  Thanks for sharing!

The mixture turned out to be too runny, I also only put a third of the parsley in and that was all you could taste, will try a different recipe.

This is very tasty and easy.  I used the store roasted chicken as suggested for ease. I also sliced the biscuits in half and used them on the bottom and top (12 biscuits total).  This actually made serving easy since I used a 13x9 Pyrex and there were 12 individual portions. I did saute the onions and celery but added 2 cloves of garlic and used 1 bag of Birdseye Steamfresh mixed vegetables instead of carrots and peas since I wanted corn in the pie.  Finally to cut on fat, I substituted plain Greek nonfat yogurt (2 small individual serving containers, 5.3 oz each) for half and half.  Everyone liked, my husband had a few helpings, and my most picky 8-year old daughter ate it all!

The "stew" part of this recipe was okay but the Grands biscuits were far too big to be cooked successfully in the manner suggested in the recipe.

This was great comfort food!   I'm always looking for a chicken recipe that my picky hubby will eat - this hit the mark.  Very easy without the fuss of a crust.  I flattened out the biscuits a bit to help them cook faster but followed the recipe exactly.  Thanks for a yummy idea!

The only change I made to this recipe was switching the all purpose flour for brown rice flour.  I wish it was a little more moist or juicy when I took it out of the oven and let it sit for 10 minutes.  The biscuits absorbed the juices from the veggies.  Next time, I would increase the liquid and switch the Grands biscuits to the regular biscuits.  It was very good.

I made it per the directions.  While it had a good flavor, it was not quite what the family was expecting; they prefer a creamier sauce and a bottom crust.

Barely fit in the cast iron skillet I used, but overall was well received.  I underestimated the salt that it needed and was adding it after the fact.  Might try adding some chicken bullion next time for a little more chix flavor, but otherwise, tasted fine and looked great sitting on the stove resting.

Didn't use half'n half, peas, or canned biscuits. Substituted 2% milk for the half 'n half and made scratch cheddar biscuits. This was more like chicken and dumplings than pot pie. Very good, hearty meal.

I too added a little garlic powder and onion so couldn't give a 5 Star as original. This was great and worked wonderful since I have one who doesn't like crust. Will do again.

Very tasty and versatile.  Use what you have!  I added a potato.  I didn't have all of the spices so I just used salt and pepper and it was yummy.  I didn't have half and half so I just used milk.  It worked fine!  I didn't have canned biscuits so I just made homemade.  (Why did I make this recipe when I didn't have all of the ingredients????) Glad I did!  Hubby loved it and wants it in his lunch for work this week.  I cooked this in my cast iron dutch oven start to finish.  I am giving it 5 stars because even though I didn't have all of the recipe ingredients it was still wonderful with what I had on hand.  Thanks!

This recipe has become a favorite with my family/friends.  The only reason I didn't give it a 5th star is we don't really care for the biscuit topping....I switch out the biscuit topping with frozen puff pastry.  Delicious!

I made this this weekend and it was really good.  With the ingredients listed by # of items insead of cup measures, it's hard to be precise with measurements.  I think my "3 celery ribs" must have been larger than the average, because mine was very celery heavy.  Other than that, the filling was very creamy, homey, and tasty.  I did add a few shakes of poultry seasoning when I tasted it before adding the biscuits to give it a little oommph.  Also, I made a quick homemade stock with the rotisserie chicken parts after I picked the chicken for the meat and used that in place of chicken broth.  Oh, and I skipped the egg wash (lazy).  My biggest issue with this recipe should have been obvious before I started.  I made the full recipe for my 4 person family and we had about 1/2 the dish left over.  The biscuits would have disintegrated if I put it away all together.  I had to remove the biscuits, scrape off the sauce, throw them in the cooling oven upside-down for a bit to dry up, and store them separately so the leftovers would be edible.  How dumb am I?  Next time I will either make a half batch for my light eating family OR just make the biscuits separately and pour the filling over "a la king" style.  Oh, and I like some potatoes in my pot pie, so I'll probably add just a couple small cooked potatoes next time.

Delicious! I followed the directions to a "t." The only suggestion by my husband was to double the chicken filling as, in his opinion, the ratio between biscuit and filling was a little heavy on the biscuit. I used a rotisserie chicken and just pulled the meat off and tore it into chunks. The method for adding the flour to the vegetables first and then the broth and half/half was new to me. It made a perfect lump-free gravy. I'll make this again very soon.

Delicious! We used a rotisserie chicken for ease of prep. Definitely let the casserole sit for at least 10 minutes before serving. The dish tasted better when we went back for seconds!

I was doing a chopped challenge in my own kitchen and was able to piece this together from what I had on hand.   I love that this recipe has no canned soup in it and you can control the salt.  My husband enjoyed this and requested this to be added to the list of regulars, and my 6 year old also loved it.  2 pieces of feedback: I didn't have celery and used celery seed for the flavor (would prefer the celery itself).  Also not sure brushing the biscuits with the egg yolk was entirely necessary, so I might skip that next time.  Yum!

This recipe is really good!  I did add two diced potatoes but otherwise I made it exactly as listed here.  I used the smaller biscuits based on comments the big ones didnt cook fast enough and they cooked perfectly in the time on this recipe.  Next time I'd like to add some more half and half and chicken stock but otherwise great dinner for the family!

I made this as directed until it came to the biscuits--I made my own. Then I got a little nervous about them turning out since some reviewers had trouble with them getting done, plus my family was "starving," so I baked the biscuits separately and served them with the chicken/vegetable sauce on top. Everyone thought it was delicious. Next time I will add more chicken broth to make it saucier.

Made recipe exactly as written. Filling was good, but my biscuits were half raw after 45 minutes. Loved the idea of this, but would probably stick to the pillsbury crust for my carbs- just as easy and I have never had it not cook.

This is an excellent, simple recipe for using leftover rotisserie chicken. If you lack some chicken, add a can of chicken (which we usually keep around for chicken salad). Fantastic comfort food and everyone is always satisfied.

Ladies Here is a receipt to get that leftover Routiessri Chicken used.Only made 3 changes 1 did it on the Weber and used a 8 " cast  iron pan and cut back on the stock to one cup but add a tsp of better than bullion for salt and no pepper.  Also you can challenge your other halve to do it on the gas grill.  I also didn't have fresh parsley so I used dried.  Pam your mom's a genius. Oh I also added some frozen corn.  I just like peas and corn.  On the grill side when you add the biscuits to the grill be on indirect heating or it will dry up and you can't add liquid at that stage.  Tomorrow for lunch left overs.  Two week from now another rotisseri chicken followed by Mom's Fabulous pot pie. Thank you very much Pam for posting this recipe.

It was ok. It was a good try but I don't think I will make it again. I wansn't too thrilled on how the biscuit cooked. Half soggy ad half baked biscuit.
