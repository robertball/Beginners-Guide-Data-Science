Easy to make!  I scooped them off a spoon, then sprinkled with chopped coconut.  Rich flavor.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I substituted peppermint for the vanilla and used canna cocoa butter for the oil. Same measurements as original recipe. 2g canna in 2oz cocoa butter (decarb'd & strained) for a .5 gram dose in each cookie. I made a sample batch of 4 for my bro & I to try this weekend.
