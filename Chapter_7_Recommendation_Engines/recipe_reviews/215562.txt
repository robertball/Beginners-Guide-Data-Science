This was excellent.  I have been buying marinated steak tips at The Meat House and this marinade is very close in taste to their's.  I used red wine vinegar instead of garlic vinegar, and added a bit of kosher salt.  I also used a little less brown sugar.  It was FABULOUS.

This was a lot of ingredients! I didn't have flank steak so I used a 1" think slice of equally tough meat. I used a hand emulsion blender to grind it together.  Just make sure that you do not cook the meat in the house as I did the first time. The meat will steam in the marinade and then burn in the pan becoming bitter tasting from the sugar in marinades. It makes clean-up a pain to. On the grill it worked fine, the next time, although I was hoping for a more juicy aftertaste. But, I guess when you start with a tough cut of meat marinades can only do so much. It did have a really nice smell on the grilll though, and the people I served it to seemed to like it.

We liked this a lot. I substituted red wine with white wine, because I didn't have any, and omitted the ginger. I might use a little less sugar next time.

This was fabulous.  My guests loved it.  I followed the recipe almost exactly.  I think I will use chopped shallots in place of the onion powder next time.  Otherwise really great.

It seems like a lot of ingredients for a marinade but they go together quickly - and it is so worth it. The only change I made was to add a bit of cayenne pepper to it. Everyone loved it!

Love this marinade. I did not have the green onions or garlic vinegar, but it still came out fantastic. We tried it on chicken too, it is the new family favorite. Thank you!

not what we were hoping for - a bit too oily and the vinegar flavor stood out.

I used this on a sirloin tip steak and marinated about 5 hours.  We thought it was pretty good, although not life-changing.  The only difference I made was to use sunflower oil instead of olive oil (my son is allergic to olives) and to sub red wine vinegar and an extra garlic clove for the garlic vinegar, since I didn't have garlic vinegar.

Made this today exactly like the recipe. It was ok. Very subtle flavors.  Was hoping for a bit more.  Still tasty, but I think I would try marinating it for at least 24hour plus next time.  Only did about 6 hours this time.

I used this for my rib eyes. I did cut back on the oil and sugar by about half. Also don't have garlic vinegar so used a small squeeze if lemon for acidity. I loved the idea of blending the Marinade..i thought that was awesome . I've seen it done but never have done it myself...i think that right there makes all the difference. ..will use variations of this again.

This recipe is phenomenal!  The only change I made?  I didn't have garlic vinegar on hand so I used balsamic vinegar instead.  I wondered about the intensity of so many similar spices in different forms but followed the recipe and the flank steak was "melt-in-your-mouth" - the flavours married perfectly!  Thanks so much for sharing your family recipe Ron!  Definite repeat!

Great flavorful marinade! Next time I will most likely  slice this up before marinating to get the flavor all over the meat.

This is an excellent recipe.  Nice combination of flavors here.  The next round, I think I'll leave out the brown sugar to experiment with making the marinade less sweet.  I made this with a white wine and parm-regg risotto and it worked out really well.  Overall, this is a winner!

That meat is tough, exactly as flank steak is!  Try the marinade on another beef.  The marinade is good, I used  good balsamic vinegar & did not have green onions.  Don't think that would have  changed anything.  Maybe the garlic vinegar would have made the diff.  I have never heard of garlic  vinegar & won't buy it.  Cooking for a long time & I was buffoled by this marinade.  Good luck to the the other cooks.  So sorry it was an expensive endeavor.

I used this recipe for skirt steak. It was THE BEST EVER!! We have a market in Santa Cruz that is awesome. This BEAT IT hands down.I had no honey, so I put 2 tbspns. of sugar instead. Either way, you cant miss with this!!
