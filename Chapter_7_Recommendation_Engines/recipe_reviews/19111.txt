I use this recipe often. There a few caveats that should be mentioned as we all know that half of our cooking success is really in technique and not just the ingredients. First--try to make on low humidity day or have the AC going to dehumidify the air--things just seem to work in this recipe better with lower humidity. Second--WRT ingredients--whole milk or any level of cream will work better--must be dairy and not any of the imitations that are quite good but will NOT yielod the same result with THIS particular recipe. THIRD--please do yourself a favor and use butter the first few times around with this recipe--my only failures came in using a cheap margarine and other whipped "spreads" that are great on toast but don't always make the transition into old family favorite recipes (I figure if my mom and grandma made it with butter--if I want the same result I should use butter)--actually my frosting was slimey tasting when I used one of those 'spreads'--grossed me out and I wasted the other ingredients and still had to get dressed and run to my all night grocer. You need to reduce the flour and milk mixture to a smooth paste by constantly whisking over medium low heat. Is this a fussy recipe--kinda but well worth the effort and like everything else--the more times you prepare it--the better you will become.

This was very grainy and greasy. Recipe called for white sugar but maybe it was supposed to be powdered sugar or confectioner's sugar. Won't make it again.

I use this recipe on all my cakes and have always received rave reviews. It is very smooth creamy and sweet. Be sure to beat it well -- for 8 mins as you add each ingredient. You can even add peanut butter to the mix which is great on a chocolate cake.

I have been searching for this recipe for over 20 years.  A friend of mine in Michigan used it for a coconut cake and when I moved I lost contact with her, as well as my recipe book with all my favorites.  NOW I can finally make icing that works for me.    As SEVERAL people have said, this works only with butter, not margarine, though you can use shortening.  The flour and milk must be COLD before you combine it with the other ingredients, not just room temperature.  Otherwise, it is gooey and not at all what you are looking for.  I put mine in the freezer when I take it off the stove and leave it for about 20 minutes or more until it is very well chilled.  Do not take it off the stove until it is so thick that it is a paste, not a white sauce.  Other than that, you should always be successful.  Good luck!

I have a similar recipe that I got from my mother. Mine calls for 1 stick of margarine 1/2 cup crisco and no salt. There are a couple of problems that people seem to have with this recipe. The first is that you must whisk the flour into the milk until you do not see any more clumps. Then you need to cook the mixture over medium heat and constantly stir until it thickens into a paste. Which is sort of a pain but well worth the effort. The second problem is that you must wait until the flour mixture is completely cool before combining with other ingredients. This is key. I use my recipe all the time. Goes great with chocolate chip banana cake.

Great stuff. I can't have wheat so I used potato starch in place of the flour. It did not fluff as much as it should have but it made a rich velvety frosting very satisfying. Next time I will try corn starch tapioca starch or arrowroot.

As a former professional cake decorator I'd like to say that I LOVE this recipe and used it often. On wedding cakes also....I like to make a thicker flour base (for decorator frosting) so I use more flour to milk about half and half. I also give the base a whirl in the food processor after it is cool to make sure it is perfectly smooth and able to pipe. Then proceed to the formula. As others have said use BUTTER for the best results.

This is really very easy and tasty. I like how light the frosting turned out. And I am sure I can tinker with it by adding different flavorings as well as perhaps unsweetened cocoa powder the next time I make it. I think the trick is to make sure you whip the butter and sugar together really well. Using super fine sugar or food processing regular sugar would help too.

To the reviewer who gave it one star and said it was grainy...I think you may have had your butter too soft and you didn't spend enough time whipping. Because this is the CREAMIEST, FLUFFIEST, and most DELICIOUS frosting recipe ever. It is smooth and silky, not overly sweet, and not overly buttery.

"Until fluffy" really should say "at least 8 minutes" because it can be fluffy, but not all the sugar will have dissolved. 

If you want an awesome orange frosting, add a teaspoon or two of orange extract and for color, add some orange food color. It tastes just like a 50/50 or Dreamsickle ice cream bar. I frosted my orange cupcakes with this and because it's less sweet than regular buttercream, my family loved it. 

I also find that if you cook the flour and milk on low for a longer amount of time, you lose the floury taste. I whisked on low heat for about 10 minutes, and actually added a bit more milk to keep it from getting too clumpy.  I now use 4 tablespoons of flour to the 1 cup of milk. Slow and low!

This had a good taste but it was runny instead of fluffy. I haven't figured out what I done wrong yet. I might have to give it another try. It wasn't too sweet but just sweet enough. Thanks.

This recipe requires basic cooking skills and a decent mixer. Don't try it if you don't know how to make a roux. This is my family's favorite frosting and I will occasionally add some cocoa for a chocolate version. Yum!

This frosting tasted really bad and had a texture I did not care for. It seriously looked like hair gel. It never fluffed; it was always thick.

Wow this frosting is a new favorite. I followed the recipe ingredients exactly but read the reviews as I made and was worried the whole time it would not come out right. My white sauce got really thick and lumpy as I was not watching/stirring the whole time so tried whisking smooth but it still had lumps so I put in the fridge to chill anyway. I beat my butter/sugar mixture for more than 10 minutes but it still seemed really grainy (I used regular sugar) so I was really losing hope. I pushed the chilled white sauce through a seive to get rid of any lumps and beat into the frosting and it all came together perfectly! This frosting is light and fluffy but not overly sickly sweet like buttercream frosting can be. Reminds me of the kind of fluffy frosting you get from good bakeries that you love but you can never recreate at home....well this is it! Was awesome on a simple chocolate cake but I am sure would be great on any recipe.

Great frosting easy to make. For smooth creamy results stir cooled flour mixture through a seive before combining with butter mixture. This will keep in the fridge for several days. Remove from fridge warm to room temp stir vigorously and it will return to it's original smooth creamy texture.

When I was a kid I loved to bake a old neighbor gave me this recipe. I use to make it for my parents and brothers Birthday cakes. When I left home I lost the recipe. So glad to have found it again. (My older brother just asked me to make it for him justs like when we were kids again)

Halfway through making this recipe I thought it was going to be a bomb nasty as it just tasted like flower. Boy was I WRONG!!!! This was a very cheap-to-make recipe but it tasted like a million dollars! I substituted Splenda (diabetic-friendly) for the entirety but I had to add a little sugar to make it perfect probably about 2-3 tablespoons. WOOHOO!!! Soooooo absolutely delicious! I cooled the milk/flour mixture in the freezer probably about 10 minutes then finished the recipe. It was not grain-y like some reviews have commented just add dry ingredients little by little then you'll be fine:-)

This is the recipe my grandmother taught us and we used it on all of our birthday cakes when I was a kid so cake kind of doesn't taste right without it! If you like a sweet frosting you might not like this. I lost my grandmother's recipe and was thrilled when i found this! I think the directions could be a little more thorough. It is all about technique and this is what we did to make it perfect every time! First it took us more like an hour to make. Don't sub anything. Start with cold milk and flour and whisk until smooth then gradually cook over medium heat until you get a thick paste. You must constantly stir this stage. Let cool to room temp while creaming the sugar and butter and once at room temp stick in the refrigerator especially on hot days. As soon as the paste is off the heat cream the butter and sugar and beat until ALL of the sugar is dissolved not just until light and fluffy. Just do a little taste test to make sure the graininess is gone and continue creaming as necessary. I remember this step also taking several minutes with a hand mixer. Then mix in the cold paste and beat until light and fluffy. We always beat in a little (1/4c) of the creamed sugar/butter to the paste to get it moving and smooth it out before adding back into the mixing bowl with the remaining butter/sugar mixture. I did leave the salt out when making this since it was not in grandma's recipe and it tasted just like I remembered.

This recipe came out greasy and grainy when I made it (still delicious though). However after reading several reviews I think it's because I only let my roux cool to room temp and did not chill it. I also didn't beat the mixture for 8 minutes like another reviewer recommended- more like 4. Next time I will try those two things and hopefully it comes out as fluffy and velvety as some reviewers claim!

First time maker. Read all 28 reviews first. Used 1/2 cup real butter instead 3/4 cup. This reminds me of home made ice cream custard starter. Has no one yet tried it with powdered sugar? Much beating required for smoothness. Will try it again with a few tweaks.

This is one my mom used to make. Velvety. I recommend you cover the paste while it cools so it doesn't form a skin.... it will be lumpy if it skins.

This is probably the best frosting I have ever had! The people who are hating on this frosting need to try it again. Not everything will turn out the way it says the first try so you have to try it again. However you have to follow the directions JUST as they say.

I made this frosting for a sheet cake for Easter. After reading all the reviews and doing research on food from The Great Depression I substituted shortening for half the butter and it came out perfectly. First of all when you are making the roux do not leave it for one second or you will end up with school paste. Constantly whisking with a wire whisk is key! If you need to pass the roux through a sieve to remove any lumps. That is what a sieve is for. Secondly make sure the roux is cold. Put it in the fridge covered with plastic wrap. Make sure the plastic wrap covers the surface so a skin doesn't form on the top. When it is cold the frosting emulsifies better because you are not melting the fats as you whip it. Thirdly the fat and sugar need to be creamed for at least 8 minutes to meld the sugar and fat without graininess. And lastly whip in the roux 1/4 cup at a time ensuring that each addition is fully incorporated before adding more roux. You will end up with the lightest fluffiest frosting with a silky mouthfeel and whipped cream consistency. I have added vanilla bean paste cocoa powder strawberry jam...all with excellent results. My mother in law absolutely raves over this frosting whenever I make it. And contrary to popular belief this is the traditional frosting for Red Velvet Cake. Totally rocking!

I was impressed at how fluffy it was note: keep stirring the flour mixture. It needs to turn into past and be very smooth. Let cool completely. When creaming the butter and sugar make sure the butter is not melted.

Made no changed. Been making this recipe for 50 years. Thanks to Aunt Dorothy. One said it was greasy and gritty. I am wondering did she use soft butter not melted and once made after sitting for a short time was it still gritty. I have never had these issues It s a recipe with ingredients you always have on hand. Butter flour milk and white granulated sugar and vanilla. Also it only uses - cup of sugar so it isn t overly sweet
