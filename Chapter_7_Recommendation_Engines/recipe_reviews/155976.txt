Really good.  Although I'm not sure I understand why there are so many hummus recipes on this site when they're all basically the same.  In any event, roasted red peppers is my favorite type of hummus.  I couldn't find the tahini so I ground up sesame seeds in my spice mill... and trust me... I looked ALL over my local grocery store looking for tahini to no avail.  Of course, this afternoon I found it... in the peanut butter aisle... DUH!  Anyway, the recipe turned out great... tasted EXACTLY like the container I pay $6 for at the store.  Oh, and I took a reviewers advice and while rinsing the beans, I rubbed them together in my hands and the skins came right off.  Skimmed them right off the top of the water before tossing them in the food processor.

The best Hummus dip I have ever had! Although, I did add 1/2 teaspoon each of ground cayenne pepper and ground cumin.  I served the dip with wheat pita bread wedges.  There were no leftovers!

This is great hummus, only changes I made were to use 1 tsp of garlic salt in place of individual garlic and salt and I needed to add a little bit of olive oil to get it blending up to the right consistency because I forgot to save the reserved liquid.  I agree with another reviewer that there are way too many of basically the same red pepper recipes on here!  This is the most simple and you can always add any the typical seasonings (cumin, cayenne, more garlic) if you like.

This is good and easy.  Used roasted garlic instead of minced, so I tossed in a lot more.  I, too, used homemade tahini that I had made before.  Good to use it up--I don't really like tahini much at all.  Thanks for the recipe.

Absolutely delicious! And more nutritious than store-bought. This was posted at our gym, as a matter of fact, and it's a great recharge. A great change from ho-hum ranch and carrots.   It tastes even better after refrigerating overnight. :)

Would love to say I didn't change a thing but...the raw garlic is too overwhelming. I roasted my own, along with my own red peppers and, with the addition of some fresh-ground black pepper, this was fantastic!

Really delicious.  I added a few teaspoons of cayenne pepper, and I think next time I might switch up the lemon juice with half a lemon and a lime, as well as adding cilantro as a garnish.

I just made two batches of hummus using this recipe. This is a very good basic recipe that can easily be modified according to your mood or what ingredients you have on hand. I omitted the salt because the peppers I used already had it added. And I added more garlic because I LOVE garlic.

Tahini can be expensive and not easily found but peanut butter will work as a good substitute. I used some spicy peanut butter and it just made flavor that much better.

this is way too acidic. Just a teaspoon of lemon juice is plenty. i'd add water or evoo if you need more liquid to get the desired consistency.

I have made this recipe several times and I always get rave reviews.  However,in all fairness, I had to rate it a 4 star, as I made ALOT of modifications.  I love garlic and spice, so increased that and cut back on the Lemon amount by half and included the lemon Zest.  Just personal taste, but this is a wonderful 'Base' Recipe for making a delic hummus of your own.  Don't buy the store stuff :(

This was ok. I found myself wishing I had opted for something more spicy or with a stand out flavor. It was easy and inexpensive.

This is a great recipe, however, I did tweek it a little. I added an extra can of garbanzo beans, because the dip was thinner than what I'm used to. To compensate, I added another teaspoon tahini paste, 1/4 teaspoon salt and about 1/4 cup more red peppers. The next time, I will cut the lemon juice in half and use either one large or 2 small cloves of garlic. The texture was nice and thick - perfect for dipping. 
I, like many others, had trouble finding the tahini paste. Look in the asian food aisle. I found it near thai sauces.

Fantastic!!!  The only change I made was some cayenne pepper, since we like extra heat in everything we eat!  I will be making my own hummus from now on!  Thank you for the recipe!

This is AMAZING! My husband recently developed a taste for hummus, but he'd never tried red pepper hummus. I made this last night and got rave reviews from him! Definitely a keeper, and SO quick to make in the blender.

3/2017: I doubled the recipe and added some cumin and cayenne pepper. I wasn't sure how large a jar of peppers to use, so I used about 8 oz (for 2x recipe).

Great basic recipe.  I agree with other comments with regard to the need to add cumin and cayenne pepper.  I roasted my own red bell peppers in olive oil and used the drippings, which helped the consistency.

YUM!  Really enjoyed this hummus recipe.  After 4 stores, I finally found tahini, it's a big jar so I know I will be making this one again.  I could not find jarred roasted red peppers, so I roasted my own.  I don't care for the hulls that are on the garbanzo beans, so I pulled them off before starting with the recipe.  I put everything in the food processor and it blended to the perfect consistency.  The next time, I'm going to try adding some cayenne pepper and/or cumin to give it a bit of heat.  This recipe is wonderful, thanks for sharing, kymberly!

Loved this. I doubled the recipe. Also roasted my own sweet red pepper and added extra garlic. So much better than store bought. So easy. Will definitely make again and again.

I just attempted this recipe & yes it's very very simple but unfortunately I accidentally put a little bit too much tahini in it which ended up overpowering the red pepper taste. So I scrambled for what to put into it & so I added more salt, some chili powder, more lemon juice & the juice from the bottle of red peppers. Now I've been advised to add cumin. So now it's more flavorful. Just took me a lot longer than I thought. ;)

This is an excellent recipe! I used a couple of substitutions that I don't think affected the taste significantly one way or the other. I used lemon juice from a jar rather than juice from a fresh lemon, only because I didn't have one on hand. I also used one whole fresh roasted red pepper rather than the bottled red pepper. It was delicious!! My nieces used it to make veggie wraps, and I ate it with carrots and crackers. Perfect!

I had some jarred roasted red peppers to use up, so I tried this recipe. I did cut back the salt to 1/2 tsp and added about 1/2 tsp cumin (personal preference). My 2.5 y/o toddler usually gags on all hummus whether homemade, restaurant, or store-bought, and he can't stand bell peppers in pasta or pizza, but he gobbled this right up with crackers. I'm sure eventually I can get him to dip veggies in it too. :-)
