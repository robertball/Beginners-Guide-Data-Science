This sangria is excellent! Very light and refreshing.  I followed the recipe exactly, although I think next time I'll add fresh peach slices to the glass.

Easy, refreshing, and enjoyed by our guests. I only had 3 peaches on hand, but it still tasted great.  Not sure why the cheesecloth step is needed. I used Cooks dry champagne instead do sparkling wine.  All good!

I made it but replaced peaches with pineapple, strawberries, and orange slices. I used orange cranberry juice and a shot of orange juice. Tastes a lot better.
