I love the tropical flavor of this punch but it is very sweet. I wrote it for lemon-lime soda but I think perhaps ginger ale might be a good fizzy alternative.

Yum! Make sure your sherbet is melted or this tastes like extra-citrusy Sprite. People at our party loved it.

This punch was a big hit at our family Bbq!! I had made it for the kids but found that the adults loved it just as much. Only change made was that I substituted Ginger Ale in place of lemon-lime soda which seemed to balance the sweetness perfectly.
