While these cookies tasted good I honestly don't think they were worth the effort. Also the consistancy just didn't seem right they were too gooey and I was unable to keep them from breaking because of doughiness. I raised cook temperature to 325 and cook time to 17-20 mins and this seemed to help. Sorry Esther!!
