These were very flavorful and moist - and got lots of compliments at a party!  I couldn't find raspberry lemonade, so I used less lemonade concentrate instead and added in some strained frozen raspberries.  They still ended up more lemony that raspberry, but still tasted great!  My photo is the one with 'bunny poop' on top of it to fit an "Oh " themed party, haha!

Made exactly as recipe suggested. Got lots of compliments from the kids & group I took to. However, I felt the cupcake was waay too moist with the pudding inside. Had to eat it with a fork on a plate and warn people what was inside so they didn't think it was under cooked (people mentioned they thought this before I told them). And it didn't have enough lemon flavoring to suit me. May try it again with a lemon cake mix (saves a step-but would be more yellow), or additional lemon zest. Icing also way too sweet to suit my taste. Will probably cut the sugar in half with the icing next time.

Excellent!  It's the combination of flavors that make it so good.  They require some work though.  Next time I'll get a baking syringe to inject the pudding.  I used a straw to poke a hole and then squirted in the pudding.  I'll make them again!
