Want to suggest an Instant Pot technique.  To be with, I don't like pulled pork that is soggy, that has to be drained.  I prefer it somewhat dry.  So I used everything included here but instead of  BBQ sauce, I used about a cup of vinegar and cup of beef broth.  But most important, I put the insert in and placed the meat on top of it so it is not soaking in liquid.  Then I lifted it out and shredded the pork in a bowl and added a small amount of liquid back it.  Much more control.

Used apple cider vinegar instead of water, used standard 3 lbs pork shoulder roast and cut the fat before cooking. Tasted better than usual.

The ingredients do not list garlic powder, but the directions do.  I added about a teaspoon. The flavor is good and my husband likes it, but it doesn't taste like real pulled pork made in a smoker.

This was simple and tasty. I used a 3 lb pork loin but kept the ingredients the same, except for using 1/2 T smoked paprika, which I think was plenty. I only cut the pork into 2 large pieces, not into chunks. I really liked the spices in the rub. (I used 1/2 t garlic powder as suggested by a reviewer.)  I would cut back on the water next time, as I had a lot of liquid that I had to drain. Also, mine wasn't burned, but the meat was getting very dark and starting to get a tad dry. I would cut the time to 50-55 minutes next time. And I'm sure I'll make this again.

You need to add all the water because if you don’t you get the burn error. It was not soggy at all if you sautéed the sauce at the end like it says.

I cut back on Paprika and water, substituted the water for Apple cider vinegar as a few reviews said. I added Garlic Salt 1tsp to the ingredients as they were left out of the list.

It's good.

I made this almost as written, my only change was I used a larger piece of pork, 5-6 lbs. I kept all measurements the same and used 1tsp garlic powder since it is not listed. I also used Jack Daniels BBQ sauce.  My family enjoyed the BBQ and were surprised it came out of my pressure cooker.

Made this exactly as recipe stated.  I found it way to sweet and way to “liquidy”.  Probably won’t make this again.

Didn't like it that much. The pork was dry, and the sauce too sweet for my taste. I did use less smoked paprika, as others suggested. I did not have a problem with the amount of liquid, because the instructions said to reduce it by cooking it down.  I probably should have cooked it for less time, since pork loin is a tender cut, but probably pork shoulder would have been less dry. And maybe a different barbecue sauce would have helped. It was easy, though!

I used lean pork chops. I didn’t read ahead so it was a surprise that it had to cook for an hour, the pressure release naturally took another 30 minutes (used a cold cloth on the lid to speed up pressure release). It did turn out nice and juicy.

Very tasty.  My whole family enjoyed it.  I added two tablespoons of brown sugar but that was all I changed.  Will definitely make this again!!

Made the recipe as stated except cooked the meat under high pressure for 45 minutes instead of 60.  The meat was very tender. 

This recipe makes too much liquid.

This turned out great! We served the sandwiches pickles, but it would have great with a apple cider cole slaw too!

So easy to make using an Instant Pot! The directions call for garlic powder, but it is not listed in the ingredients (I used 1/2 tsp). We were happy with how this turned out. The only adjustment I'd make is to cut down on the smoked paprika a bit, maybe to 1/2 Tbls. Thanks for the recipe!
