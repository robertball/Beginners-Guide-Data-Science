This was awesome. I made it when my husband's whole family came over. They're endlessly critical, but there's nothing negative they could say. I used more whipped cream mixed in with the pudding, since it was a little thick. I also skipped the butter, and the crust was fine without it.

AMAZING! Everyone in my family loved it. I didn't have oreo pudding so I used chocoloate and it was still delicious. I am going to try this recipe with oreo flavor pudding next time. GREAT summer dessert...YUM! :)
