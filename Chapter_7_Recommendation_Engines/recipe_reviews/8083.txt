I wish I could give this more than five stars. When I started out looking for a cheesecake recipe, I wanted a WHOLE CHEESECAKE, but this is SO much better! I made these for my husband's birthday, and they were to DIE for! Usually, if there is more than one bad review, I'll expect the worst when I try a recipe, but these turned out perfectly. I like a thick "crust" though, and the first batch i tried didn't allow that. I just scooped the graham crackers directly on the bottom, and only what was sticking to the cheesecake stayed. The rest sat in the muffin liners. Since that didn't work at first, I just made a whole graham cracker crust recipe, and scooped large portions into the muffin liners. It was perfect.

Mmmm yummy... only change: used a graham cracker crust. I made 4 for a trial run, 1 chocolate swirl, 1 vanilla strawberry swirl, 1 chocolate strawberry swirl, and 1 lemon curd swirl (with lemon extract)(my favourite - tasted light and refreshing) I converted my dad (who doesn't like overly rich desserts and never liked cheesecake and refused to try it before) into a cheesecake lover- he tried my lemon curd swirl one and liked it so much, he finished it off! Will make again!

These are to die for and much easier and quicker than making a whole cheesecake.  Instead of using the cookie on the bottom, I crush the cookies in a food processor and scoop a spoonful into each muffin well.  It's funny that once they cool they sink a little in the middle which is just right to hold the fruit you put on the top.

Yummy, yummy, yummy! I love this recipe, it is a keeper! My whole family loves cheesecake! But I got tired of making the big cheesecakes which we end up OVER eating and hast too many eggs and take up a whole lot of cream cheese! This recipe is good! You only need very few Ingredients! and it is a nice size for those who are on a diet! Plus they are cute. I did make some changes to the recipe! I used a graham cracker crust. I will explain how I prepared mine: I made the crust with 1 cup and a half of crackers, 1/4 cup of butter and 1 tablespoon of sugar. I added about a tablespoon into each baking cup and patted it down. I baked the crust for about 8-10 min. just so they would be nice and cooked. (you might have a bit left.. just save it for later. I added an extra half a teaspoon of vanilla. I baked my mini cheesecakes for 25 minutes then I turned the oven off and left them in for about 10 minutes. I took the cups out of the mold and let them sit on a rack for about 20 minutes. I am always in a hurry to eat them, so i put them in the freezer for about 20 min. then i added the cherries and put them back in the freezer for another 20.. They get nice and cold! ... I don't know how good it is to cool them that fast.. but mine taste good! LOVE THIS RECIPE! give it a try.

Really, really yummy recipe.  I love this recipe.  It's a great base recipe, as well, I've melted chocolate chips and swirled them for a marble effect, have also dabbed a bit of raspberry jam on them.  I get requests for these for parties all the time, and there are never any leftovers!!

Delicious! Very quick and easy to make. Everyone raves about these. Paper liners work as well as foil ones, but the foil is more attractive. I always add some canned cherry pie filling on top.

I used this recipe as a base to create my own treat with Mexican influence.  It was incredibly easy and accommodated my changes nicely.  

I introduced some dark chocolate and Spanish peanuts.  I used vanilla wafer crumbs instead of whole wafers - enough to cover the bottom of silicone mini tart forms by about 1/4" (and the same for a 4 inch spring form pan).

Great recipe!

These were pretty good except for the bottoms. If I make these again I will use graham cracker crumbs instead of vanilla wafers as they were just too bland for my liking. Everyone else seemed to really like them though my boyfriend ate 4 in one sitting.

Very good.  I'm making these for Valentine's Day for my office and my fiance's office.  I'm sure they'll be a hit!  I overbaked the first batch a little, though.  Remember to take them out when the center is still a little wobbly.  I topped them with cherries, but they would be good with any fruit or chocolate.

My sister requested cheesecake on her birthday, and since we only had one package of cream cheese, i cut this recipe in half and made six. All that we had was fat free cream cheese, and it still came out tasting great! I also added a dollop of sour cream, which was also fat free. Topped with cherry pie filling, cheescake nirvana! My sister was happy, and so were my parents, who love cheesecake but not what it does to their waistlines!

An excellent recipe. I made some plain and some with crushed pineapple on top. My guests thought they were "bakery bought."

This cheesecake recipe is fantastic. Very rich and delicious. I did a chocolate version. Instead of a vanilla wafer, flatten one Entenmann's Brownie Bite for the base, add one cup mini chocolate chips to the filling and drizzle tops with chocolate syrup after cooled.

I have been using this as a whole cheese cake recipe for years with a cookie crust so decided to try as mini cakes when I saw this. Well it came out really good. I still used my cookie crust of 1 1/2 cups vanilla cookie crumbs with 6tbl butter melted. After mixing I placed two tbl crumbs into each  muffin cup and pressed in with the back of the spoon so that some came up the sides a little. Filled cups and got 12 mini cakes. Looked really cute with topping and whipped cream may give as xmas gifts.

The texture was okay, but the vanilla wafers were soggy to the point of actually dripping liquid.  Wholly unappetizing.  I'll keep looking for a mini cheesecake recipe--sorry.

They were Great, very tasty, i made them for a party and everybody just loved them. I recommend not to put a creamy topping, fresh fruits will be great. Also double the amount, it vanishes like a swoosh.

These were the hit of the party!  I used mini muffin tins and made about 55 of these with this recipe.  They only needed to bake 10-15 mins and I topped them with canned cherry pie filling.  They were wonderful!

I added the grated zest of half a lemon and about 2 Tbs of lemon juice for a bit of zip and use half regular Philly  and half neufchatel and Egg Beaters for less fat.  I make the batter in the blender (lots of pausing to scrape) for greater consistency and ease of pouring into the muffin cups.  I made a variety by sprinkling mini chocolate chips on the wafer and top, while the rest were topped with lemon curd and a perfect blackberry.  (If you have a Trader Joe's- I love their Ultimate Vanilla Wafers for mini cheesecakes b/c they are made with bits of vanilla bean and real butter.)  These aren't what you think of for Christmas cookies but they are seem to be a favorite with the recipients.

The flavor is really good but I wasn't happy with the consistently.  Maybe I didn't beat the batter enough.  I may try these again but will probably keep looking for another recipe.

Used a very mini muffin pan.  I was able to get 48 from the recipe.  They look so special on my Christmas tray.  Was able to use one new mini vanilla wafers for crust for these.  I only had to bake 15 min each.

Easy and delicious. Made these for a High Tea at our church and made many new friends!! Changes: crushed cookies in blender and placed crumbs in foil lined cups. Melted dark chocolate and topped little wonders. I think the chocolate made the friends!

I made these for my husband two nights ago and he ate... one.  Just one.  He said they were very bland and did not taste much like cheesecake at all.  Maybe I overcooked them a bit, but I guess that still doesn't explain the lack of flavor.  I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but he rated this one a 2.5 :(

Perfect.  I topped half with cherry pie filling. The other half I mixed chocolate chips in the batter, and topped with a couple more chocolate chips before baking.

An excellent recipe!!! 

I made a graham cracker crust as I didn't have vanilla wafers in the house. I melted some chocolate chips and peanut butter together and swirled it into the mixture before baking.  

I used the mini pie plates to cook these in and ended up with 20 desserts for a pot luck.   They were gobbled up.

Will use this recipe again.

This was a great recipe! The only change I made was a graham cracker crust, they came out perfectly baked for 25 minutes. Next time I will definitely try some of the variations of this in the reviews. Lemon curd sounds tasty!

Everyone who has tried these when I make them absolutly loves them. They also like the changes I make as experiments. The only real change I made was put a graham cracker crust. Did not like the way the vanilla wafer bottom turned out.

This is a classic standby.  I've been making these for years because they always come out perfect, and always get gobbled down.  I also add about a tablespoon of lemon juice, and offer strawberry or blueberry pie filling as a topping.

What a great idea!  I never would have thought of making cheesecake cupcakes.   They are the perfect serving size.  This list of ingredients was easy.  I had everything on hand.  I was very happy that I changed the crust from a vanilla wafer to a graham cracker crust.  I just used crushed graham crackers and butter, and I pressed that firmly into the liners before pouring in the cheesecake mixture.  I halved the recipe and made 3 with chocolate chips and made 3 plain.  I served the plain ones with strawberries in syrup that I picked up in the frozen food aisle.  They were awesome, and the variations are endless!  I'm so pleased with how simple this was.  I'm definitely going to use this recipe for our next backyard barbecue.  I was concerned about the cakes not being easy to eat without a fork, but the cupcake liner comes off easily, even without cooking spray.  Thanks!

Yum!  I did make adjustments to satisfy our low carb diet by omitted the wafer and substituting the sugar with Splenda.  I made sure the cream cheese was room temperature as others had suggested. I would also recommend removing the cheesecakes from the muffin tin about 10 - 15 minutes after removing them from the oven, once they've set, to prevent excessive condensation which is probably what happened to the reviewer who said the wafers were dripping with water.  I cooled mine on a cooling rack.  I served them with sugar free fruit preserves.  Definitely satisfied our sweet tooth!

My daughter made this for a Bridal Shower.  They were a huge hit.  We will definately make again. They sunk in the middle a bit, but was a perfect place for 1 cherry (pie filling) we placed on top.

At first, the flavor wasn't right and the texture was weird. I followed the recipe to the letter, with the exception of using a real graham cracker crust instead of vanilla wafers. I almost threw the minis out but hubby convinced me to do otherwise. So, I just wrapped the pans and put in the fridge. After sampling one this morning, I have to say they taste much better. Still not the flavor I was looking for (so can only upgrade this to 3 stars) but the texture isn't weird anymore. I guess it needed time to fully set.

Love this recipe.  It's perfect for just that little sweet bit you want.

I've made it as is, but have also made it with lemon juice instead of vanilla - wonderful taste there too.  Can be made without the vanilla wafers or any crust/base at all and still taste wonderful :)

This is a great recipe, my only suggestion would be to tap the pan down after filling so that the cheesecake goes around the cookie...some of mine were not fully covered on the bottom :D

These were wonderful!  I added some fresh squeezed lemon because I like a hint of citris to my cheesecake.  They are perfectly sized and you can add any topping you like.  We used cherry pie filling and my son put chocolate chips on his.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

I found that the nilla wafers weren't big enough to cover the bottom of the cupcake liner, and also the cheesecake was a little too cakey.  If I try these again I will probably make a graham cracker crumb crust and add some sour cream to the cheesecake batter.

Easy to make but found this recipe rather 'dry'.  I prefer a more moist/fluffier cheesecake.  If you make this, definitely top with a fruit topping that will make it less dry to swallow!

I love this recipe. I have made it 3 times now...twice exactly directions which was wonderful & the third I was in need of using some bananas, so I added mushed bananas & added banana extract instead of vanilla. I served them with sliced bananas & caramel sauce...they were great!

These were perfect!!! I made 36 mini cheesecakes. I used Vanilla Wafers II recipe from the site because I don’t get Nilla Wafers where I live. I found 1/2 tbsp vanilla wafer crumbs per cheesecake to be an ideal crumb:filling ratio.

It was OK. Changed crust to recipe on box of Graham cracker crumbs. Cream cheese filling was fluffy but bland-- next time I'll add lime juice for bit if a kick.

This is my go to dessert recipe when I have to bake for a crowd and have very little time. It's so incredibly easy and everyone always loves it. I must've used this recipe 20+ times and have never had any issues. I have never had a problem with the crust being soggy. I could see how that could happen if put into the refrigerator without cooling at room temperature first, but not if the directions are followed. 
I've made this plain and I've also topped with blueberry or cherry pie filling. I've also cut down the sugar to 1/3 cup with no issues.

This was a big hit at our annual family Christmas Eve Buffet!!  For the crust I used crushed Larna Doone cookies and I topped them with cherry pie filling.  So easy to make and they came out great!  The mini size was perfect for the buffet table!  I will be making these again!!

Good cheesecake recipe. I broke the Nilla Wafers in large pieces to cover the whole bottom of my muffin cup. I also used aluminum baking cups as other users suggested. They turned out yummy and were gone as soon as i put them out!

This was a big hit especially with the men at Christmas. I topped them cherry pie filling and marionberry jam, plus I like the vanilla wafer cookie. Believe me, I'll be making this again.

We really enjoyed these.  I ended up crushing the vanilla wafers, because they were a little too small to fill the bottom of my muffin cups.  The only other change I made was the addition of some miniature chocolate chips to the last half of the batter.  These were great, despite the fact that I overbaked them a bit.  The chocolate chips were also very good in this; all in all, an excellent recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

YUMMY!!!  These are VERY easy to make!!!

Make sure to get cream cheese to room temp so there will be no lumps! Makes it faster to make too. I followed recipe for most part, except i used Neufchatel Cheese and one Pecan Sandies Cookie for the crust. Just drop it in flat side up and thats it. I made them ahead of time so they had at least 12 hrs to ensure firmness. The cookie held with the batter perfectly. Top with chilled fruit topping when ready to serve and all done. Absolutely doing this again!!!

This is a great basic recipe for cheesecake and the portions are fantastic for snacking and sharing. I used a graham cracker crust instead of the wafers and would also suggest using a bit of condensed milk for added sweetness.

crushed the wafers and cooked longer, mainly due to my own oven's 'issues'.  Very good.
