This was very plain. But WHAT A TERRRIFIC IDEA!
I did what other reviewers said-stuffed with other ingredients.  The best so far was shredded chicken, with a mix of sour cream, shredded monterey jack cheese, ranch dressing, finely chopped yellow peppers, onion and chili powder.YUM!

This was a very easy recipe.  I used beef and refried beans for the filling.  It was very good and makes great snacks to heat in the microwave for later.

Very quick and easy - we put a bit of cream cheese in each wonton too to yum it up a bit.

I made these tonight with refrigerated wonton wrappers. I shredded some leftover chicken, added some cream cheese, a bit of mexican cheese blend, a bit of pepper/salt/garlic and baked them in the oven at 400 degrees for about 12 minutes. Mine came out crispy, crunchy, and great! Thanks for a great base recipe. This is making the rotation for quick, easy, changeable dinner :)

My family made these all the time when I was growing up - but we fried them. The only thing we did different was we mixed the chicken with sweet and sour sauce before placing in the won ton. Then we used sweet & sour sauce for dipping. Loved the idea of baking them instead of frying them!

Beautiful idea!!  I added pepper, garlic, onion and chili powder to the chicken while I cooked it then like another reviewer added shredded carrot, diced green pepper, cheese and bean spouts.  I then threw in a few chopped jalepeno peppers as well.  It was soooo good!!  Next time I'm going to try putting this filling in spring roll pastry cause when I baked the won tons they were hard around the edges and rubbery in the middle...maybe I need to lower the oven temp?  All in all a fabulous idea, I'm hooked!!

This recipe just doesn't work well unless you use your imagination to add to it.  A good basic start though.

We had these for dinner tonight with beef and broccoli stir fry. They are INCREDIBLE! My whole family loved these, even my picky 10 year old. I made a batch of chicken and a batch of cream cheese, fried them and served them with sweet and sour sauce and hot chinese mustard. Thanks for the great recipe. We will be making these over and over again. These are very easy to make with canned cooked chicken.

These were pretty good. I used 1 can of chicken breast and mixed it with a tub of chive and onion cream cheese. Next time I'll use the chive and onion cream cheese and imitation crab.

This is a fun recipe for the kids to make. My kids added some beans, cheese, rice, chicken, bacon bean sprouts and shredded carrots. It is a great way to get them to eat some veggies. Thanks for the idea.

Love the versatility of this. I mixed cream cheese with some leftover rotisserie chicken and chives. I also cranked the oven up to 375 and sprayed all of my won tons with some olive oil and none of mine turned out soggy. They were all perfectly crispy. The mixture tasted similar to a crab cheese won ton you would get a Chinese restaurant except with chicken. yum!

Not my favorite-YET.  It is more of a blank slate to work with.  Chicken and cream cheese was not a winner although the kids ate it-too chewy and dry to make again).  I'll have to try the chili powder, sour cream suggestion as I love to make little nibble food.  Thanks for the idea.

Has anyone figured out how to make them not so chewy??  My uncle made these for Christmas Eve but deep fried them...I've been looking for a baked recipe all week!  I'm going to try and make them for NYE.

these are really really good. I use cream cheese to thicken it up and I cook my chicken in the crockpot ahead of time and then shredd....I added cumin to the chicken along with white wine....this is a favorite on movie nights

AWESOME RECIPE!! I have a daycare & the kids LOVED these!! Great for picky eaters. I served this with white rice & Contadina Sweet & Sour Sauce (this brand can be hard to find, they don't keep with the other sweet & sour sauces, but it's the best!). I make these on a regular basis. My mom has been making them this way my whole life, except she fries them in oil on the stove, which I prefer, but I like to make them healthier for the kids, so I usually bake some & fry some.

Good base recipe.  I too added low fat cream cheese, some chopped garlic, scallions. Baking is a great option.  I did mine in greased muffin pans to hold them together.

This is such a great idea! I think some of the reviewers missed the introduction where it said you can season them any way you like, and just saw the two ingredients, made them and said they were plain. So, that said, I went with mexican seasoning, added salt, garlic powder, cumin (sp), about 2 tsp of diced green chili peppers from a can and about 1/2 a cup of shredded colby jack. I also sprayed the pan with cooking spray and sprayed the tops of the rolled up wontons. It did make them crispier but they took more like 20-25 minutes to bake. The only reason I gave 4 stars is that my family wasn't crazy about the taste of the baked won tons. Overall, a great recipe! Thanks for the idea!

Not sure why these didn't turn out very good. Mine were chewy and hard to eat, even though I cooked them longer than the recipe states. Maybe I could've cranked up the heat? Or maybe these just need to be fried. Might try again.

Just made these and I added sour cream, chilli powder, pesto (which tasted great), onions. It was pretty good. I used Tomato sauce, and sour cream for dipping sauce.
