5 Star plus.  While this was cooking I was ready to write this one off.  So wrong.  It is a recipe that I would now use for company - it would be a great, easy meal for a shower or girl's get together since it could be cooked 3/4 way and finished before serving.  Like others said, use the amt. of ingredients you like best.  I did 50-50 canned diced tomato and artichokes, did add a little garlic, used less peppers (diced very small) and the spices (dried).  Also used shredded mozzarella since that's what I had (I wouldn't change that).  Also I changed from marinara (I didn't want a heavy sauce) and used Emeril's "Kicked Up Tomato" which was light but spicy which was a hit here!  I made angel hair pasta and just spooned the light sauce juices over it and ended up slicing the chicken rolls about 1 1/2" thick which made such a beautiful presentation seeing the stuffing in the middle.  I was so disappointed that I wasn't having company to see and experience this dish.  A salad and some garlic bread would touch it off nicely.  Maggie, thanks so much for inventing this!! THIS IS A KEEPER - AND AN INEXPENSIVE DISH!

As written a 3.5 or 4* recipe but with a few additions, it turned out great. Actually made this as a topping for some sauteed chicken breasts. Used canned diced tomtoes, added fresh garlic, fresh mozzerella, roasted red peppers instead of fresh, balsamic vinegar and brown sugar. Left out the marinara sauce because I didn't think it was needed in the end.

We thought this was a keeper recipe but agree with others that it needed some doctoring of the proportions.  I sauted three cloves of garlic (minced) with the vegetable mixture.  I also mixed feta and mozarella cheeses.  I have to say the wonderful aroma while it was baking roused even the teenagers out of their rooms!  What I love about this recipe is that you can play around with it and it will still be delicious. A definite "taste as you go" cooking experience.  Thanks for sharing it.  We will make it again!

I loved this recipe!  I used dry seasonings (adjusting the amounts) because I didn't have fresh and added garlic as others suggested.  I omited the pasta sauce because it just wasn't necessary and used canned diced tomatoes.  I also used marinated artichoke hearts for extra flavor and chopped them very tiny so the kids wouldn't know what they were eating!  I made sure to use fresh mozarella since that is one thing I really enjoy.  Sometimes it's the little things that make a dish special.  I spooned all the leftover filling on top of the stuffed chicken breasts as there was quite a bit left over.  This was a very flavorful dish.  I served it on a bed of angelhair pasta and my husband commented that it looked like a pricey dish at a restaurant.

I made this once with the vegetables under the chicken & once with them on top.  I thought it just came out too watery, maybe because of the juices from the chicken.  Perhaps it would be better if it was baked without the  marinara sauce.  The chicken then could be taken out of the liquid & the marinara could be added just before serving.

This recipe was GREAT!!  I added some garlic, and reduced the tomatoes, just too much for the stuffing.  Next time I will omit the marinara sauce, and just add some more tomatoes to the top.  The sauce overpowered all the other great flavors in the stuffing.

Great recipe. I added some fresh spinach, sun dried tomatoes, and colorful bell peppers to the mix before filling the chicken breasts. Served with cheese ravioli. It was fantastic. See my photo.

My advice is to brown and then simmer on stove top if you have time...anywhere from one hour to 3....first with lid on then off for last part to reduce liquid...I added a tiny bit of sherry to the pot...made the flavour richer...the sauce was thicker..I used goya tomato sauce and seasoned it...some diced peppers in sauce as well....Add a bit of 1/2 and 1/2 if you like a thicker sauce.  Play with it! Serve over rice or pasta.

Great recipe!!!!!!!!!! I completely disagree with another post here that the chicken tasted bland - it tasted great! I used a little extra artichoke and nixed the basil since I didn't have any, but it still tasted DE-LISH! I will definitely be making this again soon :-)

This is a great recipe, but I took it one step farther. Dip the roll in egg wash and then, seasoned bread crumbs. Brown quickly in olive oil, Then bake as directed. Enjoy!

This was delicious - I made a few variations - I used the canned garlic-oregano-basil diced tomatoes in the stuffing and of course added more of all the spices.  I put all the pounded chicken breasts together and made one huge stuffed chicken roll.  Four adults agree it is delicious!

This is a neat concept of rolling chicken around healthy ingredients and it works nicely. I do however, have some suggestions that may improve the dish... definitely add a little salt & pepper to the chicken before you stuff it... as the veggie mixture is herbed nicely but lacks salt when everything's cooked. Also, I had WAY too much of the veggie filling and it seemed a big waste! So delicious! So I suggest topping the chicken with it instead of opening a can of marinara sauce. The sauce wasn't really necessary but something on the top was, so I suggest using leftover filler for the top. I plan to use my leftover filler today for bruschetta. Mmmmm.

I made this for my family and they liked it. The only problem I had with it was getting the chicken thin enough. It had alot of good ingredients in it.

I simplified this recipe by just dumping everything on top and around the chicken, adding extra sauce to make sure everything was covered, and it still turned out great!  Even my boyfriend enjoyed it, and he's usually terrified of anything with artichokes.  Great recipe!

Delicious! I used marinated artichoke hearts and fresh mozzarella. I did add some shredded mozzarella toward the end and returned it to the oven to melt. I will definitely make this again!

Fantastic recipe! My boyfriend and I tried it this weekend with a few adjustments based on other reviews, and we loved it.  We added spinach, orange peppers, and used the shredded 4 cheese mix instead of just mozzarella cubed.  We also decided to leave out the marinara sauce.  This is definitely something we are adding to our cook book!

This was alright, it's a nice idea but it turned out pretty bland, which surprised me.  Perhaps some garlic or something with some stronger flavor added to the filling would be helpful.  I'll definitely try again with some tweaking, thanks for the recipe!

I work til five so made some adjustments so we could eat before 8pm. I used half the amount of tomatoes and doubled the artichoke hearts only because we love artichoke hearts. I used shredded mozarella and not cubed. I just don't have time for all the pounding of chicken and rolling etc. So I put the chicken breast in bottom of pan, dished the contents on the breasts and covered with the marinara. We loved it. Really good meal. Thanks for the recipe.

Oh man this recipe was phenominal!!  I even hate artichoke's, but what i did was i added mushrooms, spinach, onions and sundried tomatoes and sauted everything together.  I then breaded the chicken and fried it for about 2 mins on each side and then I put it in a casserole dish layered thinly with spaghetti sauce then placed the chicken in that, put a little bit more sauce over the tops of the chicken, baked it for 45 mins uncovered, then sprinkled some cheddar cheese on top and melted it and i do have to say it was phenominal!!  Definatly recommend this recipe to friend's and family!!!

Well, my husband enjoyed this recipe, but I wasn't the biggest fan.  It reminded me too much of a stuffed Parmesan chicken, which I don't really care for.

This recipe was just OK.  As others have said, WAY too much filling.  For me the bell peppers (which I do love) overpowered everything else.

This was delicious! My store was out of fresh basil so I think using that would have been over the top good.  I added minced garlic and used sundried tomatoes instead of fresh. I served it over pasta and used homemade marinara. Everyone loved it from my 20 mo. old baby to my 17 yr old. This is a keeper!

Turned out great! I cut my LARGE chicken breasts in half. Next time I will make sure my chicken is patted dry, and I will substitute sour cream for some of the mayo.

This was good. Kinda like a cooked Caprese salad with chicken. I cut up the chicken and browned it, then followed the recipe rather than rolling it to speed up the prep/cooking time. It was good on top of pasta.
I would make this again.

Just like so many other reviewers, I added minced garlic (two cloves) to the vegetable mixture, and used yellow peppers instead of red.  I was saving my fresh tomatoes for a salad, so I used petite diced canned tomatoes instead.  I don't know if using fresh tomatoes would make much of a difference. It was very tasty and quite simple to prepare.  I served it on a bed of spiral pasta, with a simple green salad on the side.  Got lots of compliments.

Yum ME! I've made this twice using drained marinated artichokes.  Second time I was lazy and just layered the chicken then the artichoke mixture, topped it all off with sauce and cheese before baking.  Great dish! Thanks Maggie!

this is so flavorful and tasty, it's almost hard to believe that it's a home-cooked meal. i've made this numerous times and it's in my repetoire for cooking, that rotation of 25 or so recipes that everyone has. great inventor !

I thought this was good, but a lot of work for what you get.  I used marniated artichoke hearts to give more flavor, but it was still missing something...

I chose this recipe for Sunday dinner with my family this last week. It was a hit!! I changed a few things & would love to share them with you all. I decided not to put in the red bell pepper & instead use a small package of mushrooms & 6 good size garlic cloves. Finally, I opted to substitute sundried tomato alfredo ,from Classico, for the marinara sauce to cover the chicken. My family raved with every single bite! This is a quick & easy meal that looks & tastes like you've slaved all day in the kitchen. Manga, Manga!!

Five stars  for a slightly altered, more healthful version. I did not have any red peppers. Instead I sauteed onions and garlic in 2 Tbs of oil (instead of 1/4 cup-- that's too much). I also halved the cheese to make it less fattening. It turned out superb!

Ok, so this was a hard one to rate!  The flavor was pretty good, but I didn't think it was a 5, so I am wondering if I messed it up!?!  I had a lot of left over filling, so I just topped the chicken with it, which really dried out the chicken and made the dish very watery!  I would probably not cover it and serve it over noodles or something!

Great recipe!  Made a few additions/substitutions: 1 can diced tomatoes instead of fresh (drained most liquid from can before adding), three cloves crushed garlic, one yellow onion, shredded mozz instead of cubed.  I sauteed the onion, red pepper and garlic first, then added it to the rest of stuffing ingredients.  Stuffed chicken then spooned extra over the top.  Baked about 45 minutes at 350 and served with medium shell pasta.  Everyone loved it and I'll be making it again soon.  My husband says it was great left over too!

I LOVE this recipe!  It is going to become part of my regular repitoir. I made some changes b/c I'm trying to eat enitrely organic foods: 1)Instead of the mozzerela, I used feta and 2) I left out the marinara sauce and used the remaining filling to cover the chicken. It was amazing. The feta gave it a wonderful zip. My boyfriend and I made it a part of our date night and we had so much fun with this recipe. I don't think I've ever seen him so happy.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!!!

I didn't enjoy this recipe.  The colors of the stuffing were beautiful together, but once everything was cooked, it turned out to be quite tasteless.  The artichoke was completely lost to the tomato.  I would not make this again. There was too much filling for the chicken too, so I just ended up sprinkling a lot of it on top of the chicken.

This was a good dish and nice change of pace.  I love tomatoes and artichokes, so it definitely appealed to me.  The only changes I made were to used canned diced tomatoes (drained) and to leave out the cheese since my son is allergic to dairy.  I cut the amount of the artichoke-tomato stuffing down a little and still had a little too much to roll in the breasts, so I just tossed the rest in around the chicken rolls.  My husband and I both enjoyed this, but I think it could use a little something (which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5) - maybe some garlic or even salt & pepper.  I think I'll try adding both next time.

Great recipe! Very tasty.  I did modify the recipe a bit, however. I added garlic, salt and pepper as well as crumbled feta cheese.  The vegetables I doubled and put the extra veggies on top of the breasts with the marinara sauce. We gobbled them up! Thanks for sharing!

I found that it needed more time in the oven and needed salt afterwards.  As a rule, chicken is always bland unless you do some marinating beforehand.

This was a while lot easier to make than I thought it was going to be! The chicken was nice and juicy. I did think the filling was a bit on the bland side, next time I will add some garlic and maybe a few other things to spice it up a bit. I also have lots of filling left over so will reduce that a bit next time.

Wow!  Not to take away from your great dish as it is Maggie, but I did not have Mozz cheese in the fridge.  I did have a bar of Goat Cheese though and I used that.  It was a wonderful surprise and I felt I should share that tidbit. I made some whole grain Penne for the side and made great use of the excess sauce it created.  Oh YES! we will indeed do this again.

This recipe was absolutely one of the best I have ever made!!!!  I did make a few adjustments, such as adding red wine, fresh garlic, jalapeno instead of bell peppers, added brown sugar, balsamic vinegar, and a dash of worsteshire.  It was a great base to build on and add flavors that our household enjoys.  Thank you so much for coming up with an outstanding chicken dish!!!!!

This recipe is a great idea and provides a basis for lots of experimenting. I see no reason for the 1/4 c. olive oil which escalates the calories. I made it tonight with 1/2 t. olive oil, canned diced tomatoes (well-drained), artichokes, fresh mozzarella, garlic, dried herbs and onions. It would also taste great with mushrooms and black olives. The chicken breasts need to be seasoned with salt and pepper on both sides. I grated parmesan over the top of the spaghetti sauce and baked it uncovered (it will release a lot of moisture). I served it over whole wheat noodles. I'm on Weight Watchers and the total with spaghetti was only 7-8 points. Delicious!

My entire family LOVED this recipe. I did make a few small changes... Used shreaded cheese because thats what I had on hand, also like other reviews suggested I added mined garlic to pan just before adding veggies, I didn't have marinara so I used 1/2 can of tomato sauce over top. Again like many others I had ALOT of liquid so I removed from over after 40 minutes drained liquid and then put back in oven for another 15 minutes while the garlic bread cooked. This worked out because hubby was running late.  It came out PERFECT and my kids already want me to make again!

My husband commented during dinner that the recipe was definitely "a keeper".  I tweeked the sruffing slightly by adding chopped black olives which gave it a little color variation and also added flavor.  It's relatively low cal. and a great addition to my recipe box!

Excellent recipe.  Easy to assemble and bake.  Wonderful flavor!  I did use Italian herbs to spice up the bread crumbs.  Had trouble with my cheese oozing out and will secure with additional toothpicks next time.... hopefully will stay in place better.

This recipe was great!! I did tweak it slightly:  -added garlic to the veggies -once the chicken was pounded, I dipped in olive oil and used Italian style bread crumbs mixed with Parmesan cheese for a light breading -cooked in the oven, covered with foil, for 20 min before taking out and adding tomato sauce - cooked for an additional 10 min  This was really juicy and tasty - a new favorite chicken recipe!

The only negative about this recipe is it took 1 hour 15 minutes to cook (5 minutes in microwave at the end).  We made as directed and had a lot of extra "filling", so just poured that around the chicken.  It tasted wonderful & this will certainly be made many more times in the future.  Next time, however, I will not do the roll-up stuffed chicken.  I will either cut the chicken in bite size pieces and cook it in the tomato mixture or leave as whole chicken breast and pour the mixture over top.  I may add the garlic as reviewers have suggest, as well.  Although it took longer than expected to bake, it was well worth the wait.  I served with thin slices of toasted Asiago Garlic Bread with a vegetable of baked potato and raw baby carrots (salad would have been a great addition, as well).

This turned out great! 
I left out the red pepper, added some garlic and used italian canned diced tomatoes.

Great idea! I took some other people's suggestions and changed it a bit myself. Instead of regular tomatoes, I used sundried tomatoes. I used marinated artichokes and shredded mozzarella, asiago and romano cheeses. It was delicious. Next time, though, I will only cook it for about 30 minutes. Since I didn't use the marinara sauce, the chicken was a bit dry.

We really liked this served with pasta.  I used shredded mozzarella instead of cubed, which melted really nicely.

Great recipe, but I agree that it needs a few changes.  Add crushed garlic to the mixture...half the tomatoes and peppers, but increase the artichoke.  I also added lemon juice to the mixture.  Overall a great easy recipe that my guests loved.

This was very good! Only change I made was to cover with some mozzarella and omit the peppers. For marinara, I used the Best Marinara Sauce Yet recipe from this site. Also, served the remaining marinara over spaghetti noodles as a side.

I have made this recipe several times now and just love it. The artichokes give a wonderful flavor and the mozzarella is creamy and delicious. It also delivers a very tender chicken. I usually bake it for approx 40 minutes.

My husband is not too adventurous when it comes to new recipes, but he hasn't stopped talking about this!  I can't wait to make it for company!  I did use feta instead of mozzarella, sundried tomato (in oil) instead regular tomato, added some fresh spinach and omitted the marinara.  Cut it into slices served it with some chicken flavored rice.  I do agree with another review that it might be worth trying to brown it on the stovetop and then simmer with some chicken broth. May give that a try next.  I love looking for new things to try and this one is a keeper!

I probably don't need to tell any cook what a great sauce for pasta this makes, but it does!  Of course that meant giving it all of its cooking time in the pan, then spooning it over prepared pasta.  Loved it.

Just had this. Excellent dish. The flavor that predominates is the fresh basil, now growing with a vengeance in my garden (Florida, so I'll have it all year). I made pretty much the recipe amounts, but wound up with extra filling. That'll go great with pasta. Thanks, Maggie!

I made this for my daughter's 21st birthday family celebration. It is delicious! I did not have luck getting the chicken thin enough so I put the chicken on the bottom of a 9x13, poured the veggies/cheese on top and covered it with the marinara sauce. After 35 minutes, it was done. We made spaghetti with it which was yummy. The chicken was perfectly tender and moist. We will definitely make this again!

I used three chicken breasts cut in half and cut all the ingredients in half because I could already tell it would be to much filling.  I gave a four star because it is a good base but as recipe follows it is watery and bland. I still had lots of extra filling and poured on top.  Next time I will follow some of the other suggestions to add garlic, mushroom, onions and may not even add the marinara sauce.

this was fantastic...I did add a can of black olives for color, and doubled the mushrooms.  I had trouble rolling the chicken so I folded it taco style and tied it with string....much easier, and if you tie it tight enough it tends to fold in and look like a roll.  Family loved it, thanks for sharing!

Good combination of ingredients. Felt a little bland could have used salt and pepper before cooking. We also added mushrooms and garlic and topped it with parmesean cheese. I think next time we are going to add another type of cheese to help enhance flavor. Overall we did enjoy.

I'm only 16 but I made this dinner for my family the other day and it turned out really good. I would say to half the tomatoes and other veggies. I had tons left over so I poured my remaining veggies throughout the pan along with marinara sauce.  This was very simple and had lots of flavor. love it!

This was a great dish. Easy to make and very tasty. I never used the marinara sauce the recipe called for. I had a lot of the tomato and artichoke mixture left over after stuffing the chicken. I poured the leftover all over the chicken and then baked.  Delicious!

This recipe was INCREDIBLE!  My husband said it may be the best thing I've ever made.  The only change I'd say was this could be enough filling for 8 chicken breasts and I added a little grated Parmesan on the top.  DELICIOUS!  I made it with the Sweet-Potato Carrot Mash that I found on this site - perfect match!

So delish! I changed is up a bit, but def. a good base, I didn't use the red bell peppers I also used shredded five cheese mix and canned toms. I crusted mine with panko bread crumbs and didn't use any marinara. Me and my boyfriend loved it and i also brought some left overs for a friend and he couldn't stop talking bout it. keeper for sure!

Unfortunately, this recipe took much longer for me to prepare than estimated.  While I liked the flavor of the stuffing for the chicken, it made twice the amount that was needed, and it was very watery--requiring the use of a slotted spoon. Per someone's recommendation, I also held off adding the Marinara to the dish before baking and served it warm on the side.  Thank you for sharing, but I don't think I'll be making this again.

This was good, not great, but after 45 minutes at 350 degrees I turned the oven up to 400 and cooked it for about 10-15 minutes longer.  The chicken didn't cook all the way the first time (it was still very raw looking).

We liked this, but it was not a great meal that I would repeat. The stuffing needs some spicing up, perhaps hot sausage meat would be a good addition.

this chicken was so very tasty.  it definitely needed the garlic since garlic makes everything better!  the artichoke mixture makes a lot, too much even.  that could be cut in half.  so i took the extra and put it on top of the chicken while it baked.  but this was so very delish and i will definitely make it again.

This is a great recipe.  It looked very impressive and tasted great.  I took another reviewer's advice and did not cover it with marinara sauce, instead I covered it with the leftover filling that I had.  My husband loved it.  I will definitely be making this again.

This was a good bare-bones idea. I used chix, marinara, garlic, & goat cheese.  Could've added more herbs and pine nuts.

I thought this was great. Next time, I will add some garlic and try the grated cheese. I had a lot of filling leftover (though I don't usually measure when I cook things like this), so I sprinkled the leftover filling on top of the marinara. It was great!

Wow! This was a nice surprise. Like others, I made some adjustments. Because I was using a homemade (very thick) tomato sauce (which already had herbs), I went light on the seasoning. I also used shredded mozzarella, and fewer fresh tomatoes than the recipe calls for.  My dear boyfriend is always raving and using superlatives about my cooking -- but he said that this one tops them all! I was pleasantly surprised to see that the "cheesy stuffing" didn't pour out of the chicken roulade while baking!

I added garlic as suggested and this was fabulous!  We really enjoyed it.  Only had four chicken breasts so we baked the leftover vegetables in a casserole and it was wonderful along with the chicken!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was really good!  Kind of surprised really but WoW!  I would do this again.  

I added garlic and chopped the chicken breasts up into bite size pizza then poured the red peppers, artichoke hearts, garlic, basil, oregeno over it.  Then I topped it with cheese and baked away!  Great easy, tasty dish!  Thank you!

Delicious! The chicken was very tender and all the flavors complimented each other well. I left out the cheese.

This chicken was really great!  My hubby doesn't like artichokes-- but I love them- so I got to "sneak" them past him in this one. I added mushrooms

Excellent.  I changed the recipe slightly.  Two tomatoes instead of four.  One can of Del Monte Diced tomatoes Zesty Green Chili recipe.  More artichokes.  Season salt and crushed black peppercorns.  Had to cook approximately an hour.  Herbs directly out of the garden.  Everything else the same.  It was awesome.
