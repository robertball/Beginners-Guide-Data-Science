I'm a third generation biscuit maker who swears by Martha White self-rising flour for my biscuits, cakes and cornbread.

I have never had my biscuits fail to rise. I think perhaps those with non rising biscuits might have used all purpose flour by mistake, or had errors in technique. 

I use whatever solid fat I have available. My favorite is butter followed by lard and then Crisco. 

Work the dough as little as possible if you want light, flaky soft biscuits.

I like to put a little fat in the baking pan for a crisper bottom crust, but keep your eyes on them because they'll burn more easily. And I brush a little melted butter on the top prior to baking.

I have used this recipe many times so many times that I have it memorized.
The biscuits always rise perfectly. I roll the dough out to about one inch, cut them out with my biscuit cutter and then I use a pie plate to cook them on. I also use just a tiny bit more shortening than is called for in the recipe. A little more shortening seems to not make them as crumbly.
My husband loves them and so does my Dad.
I cut this same recipe from the flour bag and laminated it to protect it.
This recipe is quick and very easy.

I love it! This is the same recipe that my grandmother used. If you make them right they turn out beautifully.

This is a regular favorite at our house. I had trouble with the biscuits rising until I substituted butter for the shortening and seltzer water for the milk.

LOVED IT!  Instead of Crisco, I used the same amount of cold butter that comes in sticks.  I just cut the stick up into tiny pieces and used my fingers to mix it into the flour.  Then I used buttermilk instead of regular milk.  Since buttermilk is thicker, I ended up adding a little more to the mix.  I rolled the dough out and used a glass to cut out most of the biscuits, but then ended up fixing the rest of the biscuits by hand... those turned out the best.

For the biscuits if they do not rise it is best when using a round cutting disc not to twist it but to shake it otherwise you are sealing the edges shut and the biscuits will not rise.   I've made these biscuits my self just like my grandma taught me.  And I had to learn the do's and don'ts.  So when you do try them again learn to make some adjustments no one's perfect right and let us know if they turned out better.

Biscuits did not rise well. Will make again but make rolls bigger making serving half of what it says.
