Simple to make and absolutely spectacular.  When I read the recipe I thought I would add some scallion, but when I tasted it before adding the scallion, I realized that it doesn't need it.  I did add the scallion only because I had it chopped and ready to go, and it was lovely with the scallion as well.  But this recipe is actually perfect just the way it's written.

Love this. The only thing I changed was I did not add croutons. I agree it is the garlic that takes it to next level. Thank you for sharing.

Really nice recipe with not too much mayo. Love the combo of potato, artichoke and garlic. Ate it almost right away with some left over to taste again tomorrow after flavors have had a chance to meld. I imagine the flavor will just get better.

I did this recipe for a 4th of July cookout. Everyone raved about it. What a hit!!!! I did the eggs and potatoes at the same time to save time. I also let it set in the frig overnight. I made it for 6 servings but it was enough for 8 people because I like adding the following:
 6 slices Bacon (well cooked & chopped)
1/4 cup fresh Red Onion
1/4 cup fresh Green Pepper
YUM

WOW!  I didn't think these would ever be good together, but looked at the other reviews and had to try it.  My husband and I both loved it!  I will be making this again next time we have company!

I was looking for a way to use up some extra croutons and found this recipe.  It was definitely different.  If I made it again I would use less Dijon mustard or a weaker Dijon mustard.  But the reason I only gave it 4 stars was because I followed the suggestion to make it the night before and let the flavors mix.  This made the croutons mushy.  I would recommend making the night before to let the flavors mix, but I wouldn’t add the croutons until you were about to serve it.  If the croutons aren’t crunchy, then I don’t see the point in adding them.

We're split on this one.  Definitely different and a change of pace from normal potato salads.  If you like artichoke hearts, you'll like this.  I used light mayo and doubled the sauce portion (not the garlic) because we like saucy potato salad.  Needed a decent amount of salt and pepper (artichokes were from Trader Joe's and had no salt).  Makes more than 4 servings as a side - more like 6 healthy servings.

This was wonderful.  I did leave out the croutons because I knew we wouldn't eat it all, but they would be great added in I'm sure.  I will definitely make this again.

I've made this twice now, and followed the recipe except for including the artichoke hearts.  I really enjoyed it, and so did my whole family.  The second time I added a little more garlic because we like garlic!

Very good change of pace for potato salad! I doubled the dressing and added a little bacon and chives (but it probably didn't need them). Great recipe!!

I made this last night to go with Sloppy Joes and it was absolutely fantastic. The recipe didn't specify potato size, and since mine were small, I used 5 instead of 4. I also left out the croutons, partly because there were only two of us and I knew we wouldn't eat it all, and partly because I'm not a huge crouton fan. The result was SO GOOD. I had to wrap it up just so I wouldn't eat it until dinner. Later in the evening, when I was putting things away, I found myself snacking on this again. And I'm already looking forward to eating more. It is heavy on artichokes, so I wouldn't recommend making this unless you're okay with that, but if you do like artichokes, make this and dig in.

Best potato salad! I added some fresh chopped herbs to punch up the flavor even more.

I substituted mild cheddar cheese for the  Parmesan but other than that I made it exactly the same. I like  artichoke hearts so it was a hit with me. Next time I might add some red onion and celery.

Seemed a little zingy with the artichokes and then the vinegar.  I only added 2 eggs.  This definitely makes more than 4 servings.

Made this for my 30th Birthday party bbq and I just loved it . My guests were really surprised with the artichoke, it was a good surprise. Really happy I went with something a little different, changed the standard bbq food and it was a hit.
