Very good recipe!  I was kind of leery about the lemon pudding, but it was muted by the whipped topping.  I did alter it just a bit...instead of vanilla wafers, I used angel food cake layers.  It was wonderful!

This recipe looked beautiful in the bowl, but the lemon pudding (and I love lemon) was too overpowering and artificial tasting.  Would be much better with a box of vanilla added to a box of lemon pudding. In addition, the leftovers were not pleasing...a soggy, mushy, mess.  I used fresh berries (strawberries, blueberries, and raspberries) which made this an expensive desert with less than stellar taste.  I would not recommend this trifle.

It was very good fresh.  The Nilla Wafers get soft, but not gross.  The leftovers were not appetizing.  Make sure you drain your berries before you use them.

I love this recipe.  I tried it after I saw the recipe on a Cool Whip tub.  It was easy to make and my family loved it!  It was a great summer dessert!
