Delicious! I didn't have plumb jam so I chopped and reduced fresh plumbs with 3/4 cup sugar over medium heat. I subbed a splash of a nice syrah for the white grape juice and a teaspoon of chili paste for the chili sauce.

Family loved this.  We had just finished making jam out of our plums  and grape juice.  So this was a perfect finish to our bounty.   We didn't use any oil and bbq our meat.  With rice it was ideal.
