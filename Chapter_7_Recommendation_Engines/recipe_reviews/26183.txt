I loved these as a kid, but after bariatric surgery knew I'd never have another...until today!  These still favorites were modified using 1c Splenda, JIF Simply Peanut Butter, and I Can't Believe It's Not Butter.  I may not have knocked out all the fat, but I definitely reduced fat, calories, and sugar.  Great for diabetics too!

This recipe could definitely could use some alterations!  2 1/2 cups of sugar is sufficient.  3 cups made it excessively sweet.  Should be called "Peanut Butter Oatmeal Fudge Cookies.  Try adding 1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips along with the oatmeal. Also, these are very rich so keep them to a maximum 1 1/2 inch diameter.

I cooked for about 2 minutes instead of 1.  My friends (and I) loved this recipe.  It was the only one I found without cocoa (I was out).  I put them in a small dish to cool and cut into bars instead of drops.  Worked great.

Start timing your boil after the syrup comes to a rapid boil that you can't stir down. I have the oatmeal and peanut butter  measured into a large crock bowl. I pour the syrup over that mixture and begin to stir. You can tell by looking at the mixture that it is ready to drop onto a silpat mat. These are wonderful!! No need to add extra oatmeal at all, or to cook longer than one minute if you get the syrup to a rapid boil before you start timing. They are peanut butter no bakes, there's no chocolate added because they are PEANUT BUTTER no bakes.

These are great, but I don't think they look as good as they taste. I lined a 9x13 pan with parchment paper and spread them out it in. I sprinkled mini chocolate chips on top. When cool, I removed the parchment paper and cookies and cut them into squares! Much more appealing when added on a tray with brownies and rice crispy treats for my daughter's volleyball team.

I thought the cookies were very good with the exception of being a little too sweet.I will make them again and cut the sugar down to 2 1/4.

I know these are simple.  I know you probably won't impress anyone by making them.  But these are just my absolute favorite cookie.  They are very sweet,  very peanut buttery, and have a perfect texture; slightly hard on the outside into a nice chewy middle.  It is crucial that you boil the sugar solution for a full minute or else you will end up with gloopy cookies that never really harden.  If you boil the solution too long, the cookies will turn out dry and fall apart.  I generally cook mine for just over a minute.  I know some people who throw in extra oats because they think the batter looks too runny; this is not necessary and will make your cookies tough and bland.  The batter will look a bit runny, but it's fine; the cookies will set up nicely despite this.  The hard part is waiting for the cookies to set!

These cookies are great!  I highly recommend them if you love peanut butter.  They did remind me of peanut butter fudge, and thats my all-time favorite.

Yummy Peanut Butter Goodness.  I was craving peanut butter something and boy did this give me a great PB fix.  I used 5 cups of oats (3 1/2 quick and 1 1/2 old fashioned) and just 2 cups of sugar.  I didn't have time to scoop them out so I Spread them in a pan and sprinkled with a few mini chips.  They were great!!  Thanks for the treats!

Great treat for kids on a hot summer day when you don't want to bake anything. I reduced the sugar to 2 cups and that was perfect. 3 is way more than necessary. Also, let the syrup boil for a good 2 minutes instead of just one after it gets rolling. This sets them up better and they won't be too sticky/chewy. I spread the 'batter' in a 9x13 pan to make 2 dozen small bars instead of cookies. Drizzled with a few ounces of milk chocolate for fun. They look a little more appetizing that way. Perfect with a tall glass of ice cold milk!

I've made this numerous times and it's always delicious. My cousin use to make the cocoa version when we were kids, and although I love chocolate, I prefer this cookie without the cocoa. This recipe is perfect as is, but this time, I used about 1 cup of brown sugar (not packed) with 2 scant cups of white, because I ran out of white. I also used chunky peanut butter, which I loved; nice crunch and flavor from the peanuts. My 9-year-old daughter was "umming" over these, saying, "I wish I could eat 40 of these!" I've made drop cookies out of these in the past, but this time I poured it into a buttered 9 x 13 pan. That size was too big, so next time I'll use an 8" square pan. My favorite part? After I pour it in the glass pan to cool, I love to scrape the sides of the pot and eat the warm peanut buttery, oatmeal, left-over goodness. Really, really yummy! Kind of like a cookie and a candy combined. It is now in our "favorite" recipes.  Thank you so much for sharing!  I also wanted to mention, that I always use old fashioned oats. I much prefer the chew this gives to the instant. UPDATE 3/26/16 - well, my daughter is now 15 and she still loves these cookies! We made them together.

This recipe is excellent.  I made no adjustments to the ingredients.  (Word of warning -- no bakes can be finicky, alter recipes at your own risk because they may not set up correctly!)  The one review I read that said they were too sweet -- I don't think so.  There are a lot of things I won't eat because they are too sweet or too rich, and these aren't.  It comes together easily and they set up quickly.  Make sure you melt your butter before adding the milk and sugar, bring it to a boil over medium high heat and turn it down to medium when you get it to a full rolling boil, stirring constantly for 1 to 1 1/2 minutes.  Using a whisk is best for stirring while boiling and for mixing in the peanut butter, then use a large spoon for mixing in the oatmeal.  Allow to set up and cool, then enjoy.

I LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe!!  I substitute everything for the healthier version (splenda for sugar, margarine for butter, natural peanut butter, light vanilla soy milk, whole oats).  Very crumbly, I keep them in the refrigerator and put them on parchment paper with an ice cream scoop. I add ground flax seed and a scoop of protein powder to make them even healthier.  I'm doing the south beach diet and with these I'm still losing weight!  Thank you!

I have been thinking of these cookies since grade school and thank you, Cindy, for providing the recipe as it's too late for me to marry our school cook.  I thought they were great as they were but next time I will cook them 2 minutes after boiling point to see if they set up a little better.  I will also cut the sugar back to 2 1/2 cups & add a bit more peanut butter as they are even sweet for my sweet tooth. Yummy, yummy & now I can have more than just one on my lunch tray!

This is the first recipe I have ever rated so low,and it is a highly rated recipe on top of that. There are three huge reasons that I rated this so low;
1)They were so horribly sweet and I even used half a cup less sugar than was called for!

2)The peanut butter flavor (of which I am a lover of) was over-powered by the other ingredients. Most likely the sugar was the culprit in this.

3) The texture was lacking, it almost felt like there needed to be half the sugar and marshmallows mixed in after the oatmeal or instead of oats you used rice crispies.

These are great! They are very sweet and will satisfy that sweet tooth, but you can cut back a little (2 cups) on the sugar if you are not a fan of very sweet, rich desserts. Use real butter and not margarine as they will not properly set up. These make a about 2 dozen but if you double the recipe then double the boiling time too.

Great recipe, they aren't like cookies, I'd say they're more like a cross between a chewy granola bar & a truffle.  If you need a peanut butter fix this will do it.  I didn't use any sugar,I used about 1/4 cup of honey to sweeten, some Splenda & Equal right at the end. These were really good and easy to make.  I think it's way too much sugar in this recipe, but that's easy to fix and it doesn't affect the outcome.

These were really good, better than I thought they would be!  I made 2 changes-only used 2 1/2 cups of sugar, and I made then in a 9x13 pan instead of individually, then once cooled cut into bars.  This was my first time tasting a no-bake cookie like this, I made them with my step-son and it was just too hot to have the oven on.  We are looking forward to making these again, they are great!

Delicious! I had enough for 30 cookies and a whole 9 x 13 pan of bars! I added a 1/2 tsp of kosher salt (because it makes everything better) and a bag of milk chocolate chips.

These cookies were far too sweet for my family's taste.  I would definately cut down on the sugar if I had to make this again.

Next time I'll use a bit less sugar and a bit more oatmeal.  They turned out great, but a little sweet for our tastes.

LORD HAVE MERCY! These are the best cookies! I make sure to time after they are boiling really good! The mixture looks a little runny, but when you mix and they start to cool, once you drop them on the wax paper or foil, (I use a silpat mat) they will start to set up. By the time I have all 60 done, they are looking dull and setting up. I have made this recipe for 25 years, I am so glad to see it on this site! Thanks Cindy for sharing!!!

After reading all the revies, I too timed the boil after I couldn't stir it down. These cookies turned out perfect. I didn't add extra oats or anything. Come to find out, these were served at my high school, they were a favorite clear back then! I'll be making these again!

I'm so glad I tried this recipe! Just what I was looking for. I was little afraid of all the "too sweet" reviews, so I just added a little extra peanut butter and oatmeal. Worked perfectly. :-)

Easy and yummy! always had a hard time making nobakes either over cooked and they came out crumbly dry mess or didnt cook long enough  gooey never set up right mess. This recipe works for me for some reason also I didnt prepare wax paper for placing cookies on before i started making and was afraid it would start to get hard in pot if i started rummaging for the wax paper so I threw the whole thing in a 8 x 8 sprayed with PAM pan and let it set up in that...and just cut it like fudge...even easier!

I used 3 cups of sugar the first time but it came out way too sweet, so I tried 2 1/2 cups the second time around and it was much better.  I lined a cake pan with waxed paper, poured the mixture in, waited until cool, and then cut it into little bars.  A good recipe overall.

I cut back the sugar to 2 cups and they are still sickeningly sweet. I think they have good potential, but I will decrease the sugar even more next time!

I followed others suggestions and only used 2 cups of sugar and that was plenty. Pretty much followed the recipe but mine didn't firm up very well.  I brought it to a rapid boil then cooked for 1 full minute.  I would suggest 2 minutes next time. I put mine in a 13x9 pan then cut when cooled. I've been keeping mine in the fridge and it's still soft but tastes great anyway!

I love the soft consistency even after hardening! The cooling process took a little longer than expected. I took the mixture out of the hot pan into another bowl to speed up the process. They also tasted more like fudge than a cookie and they were too sweet. I am adding less sugar next time.

These cookies are very good! and so easy! They are practically mess free! I did use 1/2 cup less sugar. I also used half regular peanut butter, and half crunchy, simply bc I didn't have enough of either.

These are not bad. They remind me of the traditional no-bake cookes minus the cocoa. I used a skip "natural" creamy peanut butter, and they held up nicely, no spreading. The original recipe made 48 cookies! I typed in 12 on the recipe page and calculate, to make less, to try them out. It made 18 level scooped cookes with a 1 Tlbsp. cookie scoop. I then pressed them down slightly, to look more like cookies. To cool off quicker I put them in the freezer for about 10 minutes. These would make a good lunch-box cookie.

I've made these twice now.  The first time I dropped them onto wax paper to set, yummy but crumbly.  The second time I let them set in a glass baking pan to form bars.  Much better.  I would add less sugar and butter next time.  I was the only one in my family who liked them, but I love pb!

Very good.  I was going to make the cocoa peanut butter no bake cookies and didn't have enough cocoa.  I came across this no bake recipe and was glad that I didn't have enough cocoa!  These were a welcome change from the tranditional cocoa recipe.  I may try to cut back on the oats a little and add coconut next time.

I love this recipe.  I've tried it with reduced fat peanut butter and Splenda and they still turn out great (a little less sweet than w/ real sugar, but still great!).  I use this recipe often when I'm craving a quick, sweet treat.

these were soooooooo good!!!!  Made a smal batch of 12 last night to try them out and in a few minutes they were all gone...the grandkids loved them and so did my daughter.  Im making them tonight again but I think I might cut the sugar back alittle as they were very sweet and Im going to drizzle them with melted chocolate..they should be awesome.  Great simple recipe for sure!!!

So easy and oh so good!  Love them.  Watch out, they are addicting.  For some reason though mine are really soft and gooey, which is fine, but they taste better from the freezer.  I am wondering if it is because I used natural peanut butter which seems to have more oil than the processed kind?  I also left out 1/2 cup of sugar and cannot imagine having any  more in there.  Next time I'll cut back even a bit more.

I followed this recipe exactly and it came out great.  Even better, they took no time at all to make.  I was in a rush, so I poured the batter into a 9x13 pan (with a little non-stick spray; didn't have wax paper) as opposed to spooning out, and just threw it in the fridge to set.  I cut into bars after that.  This is exactly what I was expecting... they remind me of the cookies we had at school!

These were amazing and were wiped out at the church potluck.  I only added 2 1/2 cups of sugar and crunchy peanut butter.

These were pretty good but very sweet and you'll need a big drink to go with them. Son loved them, hubby and I thought they were ok but we prefer a baked cookie. Easy to fix and great for summer as they didn't heat up my kitchen like baking does.

Way, Way to sweet. I added some salt and more oats, but it was still too sweet. Other wise it was good.

A local grocery store here used to sell some cookies similar to these and so I decided to try and make them myself...Sooooo glad I tried this recipe! It is even better than the ones our grocer sold. They are moist and soooo good. I sometimes add up to a cup more of oatmeal to them and it never seems to make them dry or anything. I have also added a couple tablespoons of wheat germ to make them even more healthy and had great results! Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Very good.  Just like the ones I remember usually have with cocoa, but I think I like these better.  Wasn't sure if they were going to set up at first but they did overnight.  I can't stay out of them!

It's like peanut butter fudge, but so much quicker and easier. Creamy and delicious every time. And no candy thermometer!

Should really get 4.5 stars.  Nice and soft, perhaps a bit too crumbly.  I scaled to 24 servings and that worked great.  In a very cool spot, setting takes about 20 minutes.  A nice variation from the chocolate kind- but very different than normal PB cookies (as one would expect).

I like this recipe 'cuz I have someone in my family who can't have chocolate. It's nice to find a recipe, without chocolate in it that isn't the old standard peanut butter cookie (boring). My kids love it (all 5 of them).

These were really good but super sweet!  Brown Sugar, sugar and honey was a little too much sweet for me, I will be making these again for sure! But, next time I am cutting back on the sugar.

I was craving something sweet but not chocolate.  These were perfect!  I used raw sugar instead of white so they had a slight caramel flavor which complimented the peanut butter well.  I am not sure I could recogmend trying it with brown sugar as I have had that burn easy.  My only complaint is this style of cookie never cools fast enough for me.

This was the first time ive made no-bakes and they came out awesome! They taste like peanut butter fudge but better because their not overly sweet. I boiled it for 2 minutes instead of 1, i also made sure the peanut butter was fully blended before adding the oats and they came out perfect not gooey at all.

These are my favorite cookies - I've misplaced my recipe.  Thank you so much for sharing this.  I only used 2 1/4 cup sugar because it's all I had.  Measuring the oatmeal wasn't exactly perfect either, it was probably closer to 5 cups than 4 1/2. They tasted delicious! This is a peanut butter lover's dream cookie!  They are quick and easy to make.

These are delicious! I've never had luck with no bakes--they always come out too hard or too soft. These are also too soft and runny, but I used Jif Natural PB, and other reviewers mentioned that may make cookies softer?! In any case, the one big alteration I made was I only used 1 1/4 C sugar, plus the less-sweetened PB. They still have PLENTY of sweetness, so I really can't imagine using 3 C sugar and typical sweetened PB!! I also boiled the initial mix for 2 minutes instead of 1. After the longer cooking time, I could tell they were still too soft when I added the oats, so I ended up adding an extra cup of oats to make them firmer. That didn't help, so I added about 3/4C unsweetened coconut. That's why only 4 stars and they are still gooey. Next time, I'll put them in a brownie pan and toss them in the fridge like fudge. That would be an easier way of storing them anyway.  At the moment, I have a kitchen table full of sticky gooey cookies, and with a toddler in the house, that is a recipe for disaster! I could see many great additions to these, such as chocolate chips, raisins, almond slivers, flax, sunflower seeds--really anything could go into these for a health-ish cookie!

These are THE BEST!  Love them.  I've always made as written and they've been wonderful.  Tonight I did try something new and they came out just as good, though a little healthier.  I cut the sugar down and I also used some wheat germ.  This is a family favorite, thanks for sharing! :)

Peanut Butter Fudge is my "crack" of choice but I dare not make it. I made these per the recipe except that I substituted 2 cups Erythritol + 1 cup Splenda for the sugar. The finished cookie had a medium "cooling effect" but not enough to ruin them for me. I will probably make them again but experiment with different methods to prevent or diminish the cooling effect, if possible. In any case, this is a good recipe. Thank you.

I LOVE these cookies and have made them this way, as well as the choco no bakes for ever!  I decided to drop the sugar in these to about 2 cups....after boiling and when mixing in the vanilla, PB and oats, I stirred in white chcolate chips for something different! WOW!  They made these even better, if that is possible!!  TOO GOOD!

These cookies are amazing!!! I love chocolate and so does my family, so I added about 1 cup of semi sweet chocolate chips when it was warm and they melted perfectly.  When the where cooling I added a chocolate chip on top for decoration! Yummy!

Awesome! I have been looking for a recipe that needs no cocoa and from now on Im making this. Thanks! The only change I made was add extra vanilla (Im addicted to vanilla).


I make this all the time now using organic sugar and organic peanut butter, organic milk, and 1/4 C of organic finely shredded coconut, extra vanilla, and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon They are always gone within a day!

I had one hour to find and make a recipe with my 9yr old son for his boyscout meeting. Since it was worth 2 point for him for bringing a treat and for making a snack for his troop we wanted it too be yummy and we knew it would have to not require baking since we had less then an hour to finish. I searched for "no bake cookies" and was trying to find one that we already had all the ingredients at home. After 4 others I decided on this one since it didn't ask for cocoa powder. I didn't have any! So as we lowered it too 24 servings to be sure we had enough sugar etc.  He began to make it and we found some Nutella a choco hazelnut spread and some mini marshmallows. I had him follow the easy directions and we added one tbsp. of butter and 2 tbsp of milk to help smooth out the 1/4 cup of nutella we included. After we mix all into bowl we added the mellows and folded them in. With 15mins to spare we  put the platter of cookies in the freezer to help them chill and had enough left over to still enjoy some at home too. They are very yummy, we licked the bowl and spoon clean. The additions made them super delicious and they didn't last long. I am lucky to have gotten the photo I took!!! :) Thanks so much!!!

I make these all the time.  They are delicious!  I let the cookies cool in the pan for a while before I spoon them onto wax paper.  That way they don't flatten out so much.  Great recipe -- thanks!

I was a little shocked at the amount of sugar in this recipe, so I reduced it to two cups, and the butter to just one stick.  Still came out great, if a little crumbly. Yum!

My family has made No-Bake cookies for over 30 years and we love them!  My father recently has gone into kidney failure and can no longer have the cocoa in the original No-Bake Cookies due to dietary restrictions.  This recipe was heaven sent because he can now enjoy the same cookie as the rest of the family just minus the cocoa.

Awesome and easy. I cut the sugar to 2 and a half cups. I also added the vanilla while boiling the other ingredients. I spread them in a pan and sprinkled chocolate chips on top and chilled. They were a big hit. Will definately make them again.

These are so good! I'll make again for sure, but I'll probably only use 2 1/4 to 2 1/2 cups of sugar. They are borderline too sweet as written.

We were always making the no-bake cookies that have the cocoa, but I knew I had seen them without cocoa.  We searched for the recipe and found these.  We are so thankful, they are delicious.  We actually substitute margarine for the butter and rice milk for the milk because my son is allergic to dairy.  He is also allergic to the chocolate which is why we desperately wanted to find a recipe like this one.  They are sweeter than the no bake cookies I make with cocoa, and I am not sure if the substitutions have anything to do with that or not.  However, we still enjoy them and they are simple to make.

Based on other reviews, I reduced the sugar to 2 1/4 cups.  I used everything else in accordance with the recipe.  I love the flavor of these, but have to keep them in the freezer because they are too tacky and never solidified up.  I will try again and maybe discover what went wrong.

Just finished making these. I used I Can't Believe It's Not Butter instead of real butter because it was all I had. I used slightly less sugar than called for and will probably use less next time. I only made 18 of these. Instead of making cookies, I turned this into peanut butter balls. My family loved them! Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Mine never got firm. They stayed gooey.  I guess they need to state to not use Margarine.  I am not sure that was the trouble.  Someone said not to stir it while boiling it.  WIll try again with real butter.

We loved these cookies. I increased the recipe size and still had no cookies by morning. My husband and kids are actually requesting I make them more often. I love that they are so quick and easy to make and require very little clean up. Thank you for sharing your recipe.

I was really happy to find these cookies in a non-chocolate variation.  I made them with 5 cups of oats but next time I will stick to the recommended 4 1/2 c because I thought the extra made it crumblier.  I agree that these are just about too sweet but I believe I will leave them that way because now I find just 1 or 2 satisfying and I'm afraid if I cut down the sugar I wouldn't be able to stop eating them!  Thanks for this recipe and the trip down memory lane!

Quick, easy and delicious.  While they were a little sweeter (no so peanut buttery) as I would have liked, these went over the well with all.

OMG I LOVE THEM. The only problem is it takes mine FOREVER to set! Do you have to put them in the fridge in order for them to set? I do. I like the one person's advice..to put them in freezer.  My husband loves these SOOO much that I too try to make them AT LEAST once a month.

This really is the best for anyone who likes SWEET and peanut butter.  These are the most requested treat by my HS students.  Boy, will they work for these! Lots of butter, sugar, and calories make them delish.  I use crunchy PB for added nuttiness.

I love this recipe. I too cooked for about 2 minutes or they can be grainy. Reminds me of peanut butter fudge. I took them to work, they were a hit. I will definately make these again and again.

These were awesome! I didn't have any cocoa in the house but had everything else and I specifically went on this site looking for a cookie just like this! They were great without chocolate, however, my boyfriend said he wanted a bit of a chocolate taste. So I just melted a handful of dark chocolate chips in the microwave and poured them in the mix. So awesome!

I love this cookie! It's so simple to make but is so delicious! I tried it once the way the recipe said and they turned out great, then I tried again and substituted rice crispies for the oatmeal and it turned out even better! Thanks!

I just made these and they are sensational!  It's a requirement that you like peanut butter, of course.  I also added some chocolate chips to give it just a hint of chocolate goodness.  I left some downstairs for my 39 dormmates.  Let's see how long they last.

I just bought a pack of these (12 for $2.50) at the store and thought, "I know I can find this recipe on allrecipes.com!" sure enough I did.  They turned out better than the store bought one's!  I used a big cookie scoop and they are perfect.  I listened to others advice though and just added 2 1/2 c. sugar, 2 c. peanut butter, and 5 c. oatmeal.  AWESOME!!  The kids cannot wait to dive into them!

Excellent recipe. I added just a little bit more peanut butter (just because I love it) the second time I made it and they still turned out perfect. I make these at least once a month now. A family favorite -- I just tell myself they are fat free because there is no label on them!!

I've been craving a good peanut butter oatmeal cookie for the past couple of weeks.  These are fantastic.  It really hit the spot.  I followed other's advice and used a little less sugar and a few more oats.  I used regular oats and they seem to have turned out fine.  They are still cooling right now, but I've eaten enough of the batter to know they are going to be perfect!

This recipe was VERY easy and quite good.  I subsituted 1 cup of brown sugar for the 2 cups of white...and added about 1 cup of rice krispies to give it a different texture.  The result is krispy and sweet cookies.

Way too sweet.  I even added more oats as others suggested.  Would be better with less sugar and much more oats.  I still had tons of peanut butter stuck to nothing.

Just like my mommy used to make!!  My only variation is that I used Old Fashioned oats and changed the serving size to 32.  That rounded out all of the measuring :).

Excellent recipe and extremely quick to make up.  For whatever reason, I have had to use 5 1/2 cups of oatmeal to get the consistency I needed.  Makes at least 3 dozen or more.

MMMM! I used to buy these at Sheetz because it was the only place I could find them. Great way to use up oats! My 3 year old loves to plop them on the wax paper...and we end up with some REALLY BIG cookies! Sets up really nice, huge quantity, and doesn't get dried out. Maybe could use a little less sugar.

I agree with AKAKIWI26 and Lisa, it's a little overwhelmingly sweet.  I would cut back on the sugar by about 1/2 a cup also.  Peanut butter is sweet already so adding that much sugar is just kind of an over kill.  Other than that these were very good.  =)

I have been looking for a great recipe like this for years. I, too, was fortunate as a kid to have been blessed by the lunch lady with this delectable treat. Made the cookies today (pretty large sized) with 5 cups of oatmeal. They set up well and taste great. Thanks for the excellent recipe. This will definately be a keeper recipe!!!!

These are the best cookies!!! I love them, my kids love them, and my husband who doesn't even do cookies loves them! I packed a few in his lunch for him and his friends and all he hate all day was the cookies, no lunch, and he didnt share! The highest compliment in my opinion. Super easy too, can't beat that. thanks so much for sharing.

Easy to follow recipe. Other than tasting a bit too sweet, I love the combination of peanut butter and chocolate flavour.  Another note, my cookies turned out gooey and soft.  I am going to put them in the oven at a low temperature for a while to see if I can fix them.  I will definitely make them again but will definitely reduce the portion of fat and sugar. Thanks for sharing.

These cookies are awesome and fast to make.  I've made them several times.  Tonight I only had two cups of oatmeal so I toasted and chopped some walnuts to make up the extra cup.  They turned out just fine so I'll make that a permanent substitution.

Not a fan, the peanutbutter flavor just wasn't there. i did reduce the sugar to 2 cups and they were plenty sweet, although soft. If reducing the sugar, I would use a candy thermometer to make sure the syrup is at the soft ball stage before adding the other ingredients.

I've just put these on the parchment paper so I cant comment on how they'll set up but from licking the spoon after, (yeah, I did that) I can tell they are super sweet. I'll probably do less sugar next time. Thanks!

I fixed these cookies and they are fantastic!!!!! Easy to make and so much better than chocolate no bakes. I, like others who's reviews I read before fixing them for the first time, only used 2C of sugar and they were plenty sweet. I did not use the quick oats either, I used regular old fashioned oats and they were very good. I didn't drop on paper either, I greased a 9x13" pan and pressed into pan ever so gently as not to compact them too tightly. Do yourself a favor and make these, you'll never fix chocolate no bakes again!!!!!!! Thank you for sharing the recipe :)

They turned out great! The key is to boil just right and not to much. I like to add the peanut butter first, to get it melted and mixed in. Then the oats.

I knew I was going to be in trouble when I started to eat this out of the pot before it hit the wax paper.  I only made half a batch, thank goodness because I almost ate the whole batch myself.  These are so very good.  I followed the recipe and it was perfect.   These will be made again but, not for awhile, I hope.  :)

Just made this recipe version first time and after 55 years of making different recipes of them—these are the BEST! Only difference-I used Old Fashioned Oats instead of quick cooking because we like the chewiness of the old fashioned oats better. These are a gem from the past!

I made the huge mistake of using Steele cut oats. They turned out horrible. They taste like cardboard and kitty litter. I will make them again with regular old fashioned oats. They turn out great with regular oats.

It's just a snack for myself so I cut all ingredients in thirds. It  seemed a bit runny after stirring so I simply added another half cup of oats. Fast yummy recipe and they came out great!

Unfortunately, I didn't have the traditional ingredients to make this properly. I used brown sugar instead of white, and Chinese peanut butter. The sweetness wasn't there, and I could barely taste the peanut butter. Oh well, I'll try this recipe again when I have the proper ingredients.

These are very good. I took the others advice and cut the sugar down to 2.5 cups. I hard boiled them for 1 minute only. And they set up perfectly. Will make again.

I didn't have enough oats, so I reduced the amounts by 1/3.  Worked great!  My hubby just spooned them out, I think next time we will shape them into balls and flatten them out.  They are a little crumbly, but the ones I patted together were not crumbly.

Absolutley scrummy! Great recipe. Word of warning, although these are very sweet, do not cut the sugar, they won't set up. I also use JIF peanut butter - it seems to set up best.

I have used this recipe many times and not once has it let me down! The recipe did not include instructions for the butter, but my best results have come from fully melting the butter and adding one teaspoon of vanilla in with the sugar, butter, and milk.

Love these cookies! They’re sort of like a peanut butter fudge with oats. You can scoop out individual cookies or spread mix onto a sheet pan and cut/break once chilled. I cut the sugar to about 2.5 cups usually because 3 cups turned out too sweet for me. I typically use natural PB and didn’t have any issues using it in this recipe. Enjoy!

These were so easy to make and they turned out amazing.  I did add a little more peanut butter because I love it and thought that they were a little pale.  I had my neighbor and a couple of my friends asking me when I was making more.  Definitely will be making them again soon.

I cut the recipe in half and only used 1 cup sugar. These are so sweet neither me nor my kids can eat them. Quick cooking oats, per directions, just turned to mush. Gross.

These are irresistibly peanut buttery goodness! I was shocked by the amount of sugar that went into it afraid it would be too sweet but it's the perfect balance to all the peanut butter. I will be making this many more times!

Great recipe. Tried a few things differently and turned out awesome. I used original flavor almond milk in place of regular,  1/3 cup less sugar, and added a couple tsp of cocoa.

i've made these twice and i love the taste of them but can't seem to get them to set right. the only thing that i change was half cup less sugar. i bring it to a rolling boil for exactly a minute and it takes them FOREVER to set enough to even pick them up. i don't know what i'm doing wrong but other then that great tasting and simple recipe.

These were a hit with my family who loves peanut butter.  I did use only 2-1/2 cups of sugar as suggested by some.  They were still sweet and wonderful!!!

After reading the reviews, I decided to cut the sugar to 2 cups.  It came out splendidly and tasted great and wasn't too sweet for me.  The only concern I had was the cookies were still a litte soft when they set.  I refrigerated them to make sure they stayed set.  But I was very pleased with how they came out.

I gave it a four star just because 3 cups of  sugar is far to sweet for me.  Next time I would lessen the sugar being that peanut butter already has sugar roughly 130 mg of sodium.  Other than that it was fairly easy to make.  After placing them on the wax paper/parchment paper I put them into the frig to cool and harden.  They came out just fine.

These were delicious!!!! I made the following changes based on what had on hand:
2 cups sugar (could still cut this down by quite a bit for my taste as these turned out very rich)
Subbed coconut oil for the butter and almond milk for regular milk. I didn't have any vanilla but I don't miss it. I just did 4 cups regular oats. After I mixed in the oats I threw in a couple large handfuls of chocolate chips to mix in. They melted nicely and cured my peanut butter and chocolate craving! I put the whole batch in a 9x11 pan and cut into squares once cooled.  Perfection...and vegan now that I think about it for those on that type of diet.

These are a HUGE hit in my home! I make them with a few modifications. With the sugar I add 3 tablespoons light corn syrup. This helps the cookies from turning grainy after a couple of days (if they last that long!). For the milk, I substitute Half-n-Half.  The added milk fat also helps make the cookies creamy. You can use whole milk but I don't recommend 2%, 1%, or skim. You want the extra milk fat, but do not use heavy cream! Heavy cream doesn't have enough liquid and will cause your cookies to be crumbly. Last modification is I like to use 3 1/2 cups of quick-cooking oats and 1 cup of old fashioned oats. The old fashioned oats adds a little extra texture. 

If you love peanut butter, you have to try this recipe! Enjoy!!

These cookies are great tasting cookies if you like the traditional sweetness of no bake cookies. I made the cookies exactly as the recipe states. The only reason I didn't rate 5 stars is because it takes the cookies a long time to set up. I had to let them set out on foil over night before they were firm. In the future I might boil a tad bit longer.

I followed exactly as written and it was great!  These taste like perfect peanut butter fudge in a cookie form! I'll be making these often as a treat for the kids. Thanks for sharing.

I used 2 cups of sugar instead of three and let my milk mixture boil for a tad bit longer time. They turned out more like fudge than cookies. Any suggestions?

Just made these with my little brother. I added a couple of tablespoons of cocoa powder when I was waiting for the milk mixture to boil, and sprinkled shredded coconut on the cookies as they were cooling. They are absolutely delicious!

My family really liked these cookies.  I made them for the kids after school one day and they were a hit.  They did get crumbly after a few days while we were working our way to the end of the batch.  Will make again.

Sooooo good! A deli next door to my house sells these and their baker told me she got the recipe on here! I don't know if this is it, but I made these tonight and they were delicious. I only used 2 and 1/4 cups sugar and next time I'd do even less. Very rich! I also used whole milk if that matters to anyone. Instead of dropping them on wax paper, i poured the warm mixture in a 11 x 9 glass baking dish which i greased, leveled it and then I put it in the freezer for about a half hour. Then I let them continue to cool down on the counter and finally cut them into bars. Yum!

We loved this. My boys and I are big fans of no bakes I have been trying to find a peanut butter recipe that reminds me of the ones my mom used to make and these were it. They were so peanut butter-y. These did not last very long in my house.

This was a great recipe. It was my first time making no bakes. I decided to use half white sugar and half brown sugar. I also used old fashioned oats instead of quick cooking. The boiling time does have a lot to do with the consistency of the cookies as has been mentioned in previous reviews. The first time I made these I only did a minute and started the timeing after it was at a rapid boil (had a hard time stirring it down) and the cookies came out mushy but were still great anyways. I attempted making them a second time and did three minutes and this proved to  be too much because the cookies were kind of dry and crumbly, would not stick together well. Third times a charm though! I boiled for 2 minutes and the cookies came out perfect. My family has had no problem eating all my trial runs!!

AWESOME!!! This recipe worked great for my friends who love no bakes, but not chocolate. I did add 5 cups of oats and they were perfect!

i made a 2/3 recipe since i only had one stick of butter on hand. reduced the sugar because i feared it would be too sweet, and still was too sweet for me. 
the smell was great, but the mixture was a little runny -- might be because i used regular (not-quick) oats? But the cookies finally set over-night. taste good but too still too sweet, and i think i prefer chocolate with my peanut better.

These were good...and easy.  I am not sure that I "loved" the oats with the peanut butter, but with the heat wave we have been having I like any dessert that doesn't make me heat up the oven.  Thanks for the post.

I made these for a bake sale and they were a huge hit.  One guy left and came back for more, said they were the best he'd had.

I really like this recipe. They taste great and my husband loves them as do the people I work with.  The only reason I gave them only four stars is they take a little while to set up.  Other than that they are wonderful.

These were so yummy. A very nice alternative to the cocoa ones that we are used to. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Wow, I love this recipe! I do not care for chocolate, seems that every no bake cookie recipe is all about the chocolate version of these. I have made them and made them, and I am now looking at making quite a few recipes by this submitter! Thanks for the quick recipe!

I didn't have a family recipe from Mom for these so I decided that this one sounded good.  They were so easy to make and tasted great.  Thanks Cindy.

These are very sweet cookies, don't forget your tall glass of cold milk to gulp after each bite.  They were a nice change from the usual cookie, and they're so quick with no baking. I only used 2 1/2 cups of sugar, and they turned out yummy.  Thanks for the recipe.

These are great! I didn't change anything in the recipe and they turned out wonderfully. I haven't been able to stay out of them so I'm thinking I may have to make up another batch. I've been making the variation of these with cocoa for years but I think I like this way better. Thanks a bunch Cindy!

This is a great no bake recipe.  My 3 year old loves to help me make them for her friends.  I added a little more oats to ensure that they set.

This recipe is great, it's just like the chocolate no bakes but with out the chocolate.. The only thing is you have to work fast when droping them from the teaspoon, or it crumbles.  I will make them again.
