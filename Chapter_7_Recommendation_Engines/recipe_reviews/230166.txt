I have made a lot of Yorkshire Pudding recipes and although this is different in both the ratio of eggs / milk and I have NEVER added baking soda - these were great.  They rise well and hold their shape better than most Yorkshire Pudding recipes do.  Thanks for a great recipe.

These little gems were a hit at my Christmas Eve dinner. I usually bake the traditional Yorkshire Pudding in a pan or the puffy popovers. They were a perfect texture and shape. I mixed them up an hour before baking.  While the roast rested, I prepared the pans and put them in the oven. It gave me just enough time to make the gravy. Everything came together perfectly. Please thank Nana for the recipe!

Very good and very easy! My husband's mother always made yorkshire pudding for his b-day.  After 22 years of marriage I finally decided to attempt making it.  He said it was as good as his mom's. Thanks for the recipe!

I am sorry I have never rated a recipe before now, I have made lots of yorkshire puddings before but have to say these were horrid, they tast more like a muffin than what I am use to , which is light and fluffy but to be fair this was the very first thing I have made in my new oven.

I tried this and the puddings did not puff up with the characteristic hollow.  Although I did cook with my roast at a lower temperature than suggested.  Will use my old recipe next time.

These were so easy to make and held their shape perfectly. I have used this recipe twice and it is replacing my old yorkshire pudding recipe. Thank you for sharing.

We loved these. i dont always get enough drippings to make other  Yorkshire pudding recipes so I'm glad to have this tasty gem to go along with my roast beef or even just for a delicious snack. They have good texture and decent flavor and i always have the ingredients on hand. I will make often.

I make these every year when I make the holiday prime rib. Not only are they fantastic with that dinner, they are wonderful with sausage gravy the next morning! Yay Nana!
