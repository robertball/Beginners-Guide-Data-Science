It's very delicious! and a bit labor intensive. You don't have to ...but I "sweated" the eggplant and then browned it. Sweating or weeping is salting it and letting it sit for 30 min . It makes it more tender and less bitter. I only used one eggplant but 1 lb of turkey....it still makes a LOT. I added mushrooms and cooked them first also because they produce a lot of water if you don't.  If you omit the quinoa it's far less carbs, but quinoa is good for you. You do NOT need to cook the quinoa first.

This recipe was great inspiration, but too much cheese for our healthy diet.    I added part skim ricotta and cut the shredded cheese to 1 cup total.  I also roasted the eggplant, using 
less oil.  Even my picky 9 year old liked it.

This was unbelievable delicious! The flavors and textures went together perfectly. This was also  easier to digest because it is healthy. This is my favorite lasagna I have ever had, and it would be great for a party or just for a family meal at home.

This was a tasty dish.  I liked the addition of eggplant and that it used quinoa. This is a nice italian style casserole
