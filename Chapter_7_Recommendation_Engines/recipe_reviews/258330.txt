my go-to recipe for traditional Dutch apple pie :-) I usually add 2 teaspoons of cinnamon, since 1 tablespoon can be a bit overpowering.

Soggy base, too little browning and undercooked apples even at the far end of the timings, i'd try this again but knock the oven temp up a bit and toss a little polenta into the case to prevent some of that sogg
