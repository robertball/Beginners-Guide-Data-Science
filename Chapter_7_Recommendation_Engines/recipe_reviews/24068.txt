Mine turned out really good!  I had read through the comments, and had taken the advice of some of the other readers regarding getting the fudge to harden properly.  First of all, I only used one 7 oz jar of marshmallow cream (1.5 cups).  Secondly, I had to boil it a bit longer to get it to soft ball stage, which is where fudge has to be in order to set properly.  Instead of 5 minutes, it was more like 6 or even 6 1/2 minutes.  You don't have to use a candy thermometer, but at least look on the 'net to see how to test for soft ball stage.  One final tip:  Mix your peanut butter, marshmallow cream and vanilla all together in a heat-proof bowl while you are boiling the other mixture, and then pour the boiling mixture over the peanut butter mixture in the heat-proof bowl.  If you don't, you'll end up with scorched, dark bits of peanut butter throughout your fudge.  It doesn't affect the taste, but it does take away from the appearance.

This is very creamy and yummy.  Beware however, that a 7 oz. jar of marsh. creme is only about 1.5 cups.  I just added some mini marshmallows to make up for it (they took a while to dissolve though, so I won't do that again).  It doesn't cut very nicely, but I guess that's the price you pay for such a moist and creamy fudge.  It doesn't say whether to put it in the fridge, so I did to see if it would cut easier, and it did. Thanks so much Pam!

This was my first try at making fudge - nobody in my family makes it and I thought I'd give it a go!  This was the easiest, most idiot-proof recipe I could find.  No thermometers, no "soft-ball" knowledge required.  The fudge was creamy and fattening - just the way fudge should be!  I got rave reviews from my workplace and my husband's co-workers as well (couldn't keep it in the house for fear of having to buy a new wardrobe!).  One hint to people who want to try it:  Mix all your "non-cooked" ingredients before cooking the rest of the mixture; the cooked portion cools quickly and if you aren't careful, you could end up with a sugary concrete mixture in your pan.  I'll be using this recipe all the time!

This is a fabulous fudge when done correctly. However, the above recipe is a tad incorrect which is why everyone is having issues with it setting up and not tasting peanut buttery enough. I ALWAYS double this recipe because it tastes so much better that way. When doubling use 2 1/2 cups peanut butter, and a large jar of marshmallow fluff. Do a full rolling boil for 5 minutes. The grainy taste happens when you don't do the boil long enough. When pouring into the pan, the fudge should not be more than 1/2 inch to an inch thick. If its too thick it won't set .

Quick and Easy.  This is the best fudge my family has ever tasted.  If its PButer Fudge you want than this is it.  Although, the first time I made it, we only had one cup of Mrshmllw Cream and it was more PButtery. Try and see.

After 31 yrs. of marriage, I could never make a good "batch" of fudge until I used this recipe.  It is so easy because there is no dropping the sample into a cup of cold water to check for the "ball" to form.  Very easy and quick.  Now everyone loves to hear me say "I think I will make a batch of fudge(they used to make jokes)".  Everyone on my "gift list" will get fudge.  Haha.  Great recipe.

Good, but not as creamy as I had hoped. For those who have had problems with it not firming up, be sure to start the 5 minute timing only after it comes up to a full, rolling boil, meaning one that can't be stirred down. Adding a bit of salt (1/8 tsp) helps make the flavor pop. Makes a nice, deep 8" pan.

I'd never even attempted fudge until last night at midnight, and felt completely overwhelmed as I read through all the recipes demanding "soft ball" tests and the like (I don't have a candy thermometer, and have never tried making candy of any sort before).  I doubled the recipe, didn't have marshmallow creme, and I ran out of sugar--instead using  white, brown, and turbino (raw) sugar to fill the quota. Against all odds, the fudge came out absolutely delicious, with nothing to worry about! Definitely recommended.

It was okay, I could taste the marshmallow in it.  Might be because I used real mashmallows instead of the cream.

I have been making this fudge for 30 years and I make as much as 15 batches at a time. A reviewer wrote that the fudge gets "grainy" when you undercook it and that's not true, it gets grainy when you overcook it and/or if the fire on the stove is too high. You can have a higher heat with chocolate fudge but peanut butter fudge is finicky and likes a lower heat. A rolling boil for 5 minutes is what it takes for the fudge to properly set up but peanut butter fudge comes out better when you do a little less than five minutes. It does not matter which pan you want to use, fudge when properly done should set up no matter the thickness. Also important is the peanut butter you use and I find Jiff to be the best for this. Before cutting fudge it should sit for 12-24 hours to properly set up. You can cut it before but it needs time to set up. I line my pans with wax paper and lift out the brick of fudge to cut up, makes it easier. Also, you must constantly stir the fudge. My recipe uses 2/3 cup evaporated milk, 1 cup of peanut butter, and 1 (7) ounce jar of marshmallow cream.

This never set up for me - it's more the consistency of playdough than fudge.  Not really sure what I should do with the two batches I made...

I love this fudge!  Very creamy and peanut buttery.  It is softer than traditional fudge, but I liked that.  Great with coffee.

This turned out wonderfully!  Here's how I did it with perfect results: First, I used an old fashioned, regular peanut butter (it was just a store brand), NOT the natural stuff which is too oily and won't allow the fudge to set up.  Also, I used only a 7 ounce jar of marshmallow creme, not the full 2 cups.  Once the sugar mixture came to a rolling boil, I cooked it for 6 minutes instead of 5.  I put the peanut butter, marshmallow creme, and vanilla in a heat-proof bowl and poured the sugar mixture over it and mixed, which was very fast and easy.  I would recommend not scraping the sugar residue off the sides of the pan while the mixture is boiling as it may leave sugar crystals in the finished fudge.  I put the pan of fudge in the refrigerator immediately and cut it the next day using a knife which I ran under hot water and dried off.  This resulted in a pretty squares of delicious fudge which my family all raved about!

taste and smoothness were good, but it never set up enough to cut into chunks.  Had to spoon it into mounds to serve...so I will continue looking for a fudge that I can cut into pieces.  I followed recipe to the letter.

This does taste good, but mine turned out very soft. When I got to the stage where you mix in the peanut butter, I thought I had failed because it was absolutely liquid. I poured it into the 8x8 pan and stuck it in the fridge. It did harden up a lot, but I think that if I just left it on the counter, all the pieces would run together. My son described it as a really delicious, creamy, thick frosting as opposed to a fudge. So it tastes good, but the texture is somewhat inconvenient if you want to serve fudge. I don't know what happened. I boiled it for the right amount of time. I did use an organic peanut butter that was a bit runnier than the normal 'Skippy' or 'Jif'.  I might try this again, but cook it longer. We'll still enjoy it, but perhaps with a spoon.

Followed the recipe to the T and I ended up with peanut butter flavored marshmallow fluff.  :( It never set for me, even after 12 hours in the fridge. It would taste really good with jelly sandwiched between two pieces of bread or even on graham crackers; not quite what I was looking for. :( Next!

Absolutely amazing! I have been insearch of a smooth creamy peanut butter fudge for many years and finally, this one is it i found it easy to cut if you put your knife in very hot water, wipe the excess water of and quickly slice before the knife cool!

This is so good.  I did read the reviews and follow a few of the tips.  I did cook the sugar mixture to soft ball stage and I did mix up the peanut butter, marshmallow creme and vanilla before the sugar mixture was done cooking.  The only thing I did different was add the hot mixture to the cold ingredients.  The fudge was set in just a few minutes.  Thank you Pam great recipe.

I just made this and it was great!  Really good taste and consistency.  Apparently you are not supposed to stir once it starts boiling or it will form sugar crystals.  I followed that advice and it was very creamy.  I will definitely make this again!

Perfect!!  It is my Mom's recipes, but with actually measurements instead of..."Oh, about a half a jar of peanut butter, some marshmallow cream....etc" The only difference is that if you just use one tub of marshmallow creme, it actually sets up and is not so mushy.

I made this recipe and tweaked it a bit by using frozen marshmallows folded into the fudge.  It was a huge hit at my daughter's University Dorm.  Every time I sent other fudges, they all asked when I was going to send my "Fluffer Nutter" fudge. I give this 5 stars because of the ease in making it and the wonderful flavor.  It's on my list. Wild Irish Rose Entertainment  After reading the comments ... here's my Post Script. 
P.S. I am adding my notes for those who are having trouble with this recipe! ~ I use 1 1/8th cups Skippy plain peanut butter for it's fat content and measure out the full 2 cups of marshmallow cream (Kraft) because it matters to the mousse-like texture and in doing so, it has never failed.  I also use 3 Tbsp of butter and only use regular sugar in this recipe, not the Bakers superfine sugar.  When timing the cooking, in 6 minutes, my digital thermometer goes up to about 230 degrees. I hope this helps. I gave this tin for a birthday gift for a young friend and she had about half of it left over (! and 1/2 pounds) ... when she awoke in the morning ... her husband to be had eaten the entire thing.  (Needless to say his "Tummy" hurt)  He still likes the fudge.  Nuff Said!

Never mind that this fudge never set up for me, it's just flat-out not peanut butter fudge! It's more like marshmallow fudge with a peanut butter hint.! And got a recipe for real peanut butter fudge off the Jif website. Now that one tastes like peanut butter fudge. The directions are not very good either. My guess why it didn't set up for me is because i didn't stir it while it boiled. Because the directions didn't say to do anything while it was boiling. I cook and bake just about everything. I was so disappointed with this recipe. But the Jif peanut butter fudge is great. Try that one instead!

Best Peanut Butter Fudge I've made or tasted!Since my pans are sensitive, I cooked on 5 till boil then between 4 & 5 for 7 minutes-Absolutely Perfect!!!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe! Note-constantly stirred with and kept sides of pan clean, otherwise you will pick up undissolved sugar when pouring into pan.

This is a really good recipe for fudge.  To make it healthier I used splenda and lower fat margarine and it came out just as good.  Also a bit of chocolate chips mixed in tastes really good as well.

This is a pretty good recipe... it is very smooth and rich as it should be. I wasn't exactly paying attention to it while it was on the stove so it might have been on there for two minutes more or two minutes less than what was expected but whatever I did, it must have made changes for the better. All of my other peanut butter fudges hav been too gloopy and thick for my liking... this one is perfect. My only negative comment is how stick it was because of the marshmallow cream. Next time I will use less- I don't think it will matter to the already sweet recipe. :)

not quite peanut buttery enough for me. Very good consistency and texture though. Maybe a touch too sweet.

Only so-so. Tasted good, but definitely not peanut-buttery enough and it never set up fully to where you could cut and eat it as fudge. So after 2 days in the fridge, I got desperate and scooped up balls of it with a spoon, then rolled them in melted chocolate. Now THAT was very yummy (and naughty), but rather messy.

I have several variations of "Fudge" recipes and they all seem to come out about the same. One thing I think most people don't consider with the cooking time is that the size & thickness of your pan and the kind (gas or electric) of heat your cooking with do factor in. This is why a thermometer and/or the soft ball test is necessary. With that being said, "Thanks Pam for your addition to my fudge collection!"

I love this recipe...however, I did "adjust" it slightly. The true recipe has some needed changes to avoid issues with setting. There is too much marshmallow. One 7oz. jar of marshmallow crème is enough. I used 1 1/4c. of peanut butter just because I didn't have a 1/8 measuring cup. Lastly, I added 1 Tbls. flour to peanut butter mixture. I listened to other viewers and let it boil on high and set timer for 6 minutes from rolling boil...perfect! no candy thermometer, no ice water test. It is very important to mix the peanut butter, vanilla, marshmallow and flour in a bowl first, before you heat other ingred. It saves time when your mixing it into hot ingred. so that it doesn't start cooling down and setting in the pot before everything in mixed in smoothly.

So, it didn't come out how I had expected it to. It tastes delicious, but I also had problems with how it formed. Instead of being how I had imagined it being; it was really goopy. It wouldn't set even after a few hours in the fridge, so I put it in the freezer. Now it has more of a taffy-life consistency. But it tastes really good! It's just unfortunate that I can't cut it into squares and eat it, and instead have to eat it with utensils.

This is not worth making. It was lacking in peanut flavor, by the time it reached softball stage it was already overcooked after adding other ingredients it was crumbly and tasteless. Will not be making this again.

Very Good! I never made fudge before and it turned out wonderful! The only think I changed was the cooking time and not stirring it when it came to a boil. I cooked it for 7 mins.

This was my first time making peanut butter fudge. The only change I made to this recipe was that I cut the sugar in half. My fudge turned out too creamy. I'm not sure if it was the lack the sugar that did that. Otherwise the fudge turned out tasting okay.

This didn't set firm enough to take the pieces out of the pan when sliced.  It was very creamy, but could use more peanut butter flavor. It would make a great frosting!

It had a good taste and it seemed firm inside the fridge, but as soon as 30 minutes passed by, they started to turn very mushy. I passed a few out as Christmas gifts last year and I didn't get any compliments. I figured they turned mushy by the time they took them home. I felt bad, I wanted them to turn out great.

Mmmmmm, this is a delicious and very rich recipe.  I scaled back the servings to 12, in order to use the 7 oz. (1.5 C) of marshmellow cream. Filled an 8 x 8 pan.  Will definately make again!

This was just the peanut fudge I was looking for. I added a bit more pb then listed but it turned out wonderful. Tastes just like the kind my Grandmother made for holidays when I was a kid. And very easy to make.

This was a SUPER EASY recipe. I used a sugar blend product for baking (1/2 artificial sweetner 1/2 real sugar)...worked great!

I used real marshmallows instead of creme and substituted coconut oil for the butter and mine tasted like Chick O Sticks, everyone loved it.

I made these for christmas this year. They were really good, came out perfect... Everyone who tried them liked them... But no one really ate much and I had a lot left over and I have a huge family. I think they were just too sweet. I couldn't eat much of it. Good though!

I love this recipe!! It's smooth and rich, so decadent but so simple! When I make it, I line the pan with wax paper and then let it set up in the fridge. Then just pull the whole thing out to cut evenly. I'm making it for Christmas and I'm going to try it with nutella swirled into the top, should be yummy!

This was grainy and tasted of sugar granules.  Not peanut buttery enough.  Follow the other people's advice and cut down the marshmallow in 1/2 or add more PB.

This recipe tastes great, but it was not nearly as firm as I would have liked. I boiled it for exactly 5 minutes and didn't stir it once it reached a rolling boil.  If I make it again, I think I'll use a candy thermometer.  Otherwise, everything was great.  Mild peanut butter flavor and just the right amount of toothiness.

I've been making this recipe for a few years.  It doesn't really matter the size of the pan, just as long as you have a pan.  I've used pie plates before, and the fudge still turned out excellent.

Wow! That was easy and the people at work raved about the results.  I made two batches this year.  The first one turned out very soft and creamy, and people just couldn't stay away from it.  The next batch, I think I coooked a little longer and it was firmer, but still really good and tasty.

I added about 2 tbs of honey to the sugar mixture. This fudge is very peanutty and a bit chewy. The chewiness may have come from the honey, I'm not really sure but my husband liked it and he doesn't really like sweets. This is definately a keeper.

Has an excellent taste but too mushy for me. I like my fudge a little more firm. I'd try this again but would cook it longer than 5 minutes. Maybe to softball stage and then add the peanut butter and marshmallow.

I've made this one twice now. First time I followed the recipe. Wonderful and foolproof!  This time I left out the vanilla and added 1/2 cup REAL BACON PIECES. Not fake bacon bits. OMG!!! The bacon and peanut butter are already a match made in heaven, but the salty and sweet combination is supreme!

I think I varied a little in the amount of Peanut Butter...mostly resulting in "Must keep in freezer" extra gooey!!!  But the recipe is spot on Magnificent !!!   My has the tendency to melt in your hands like M & M's, but this is the only, easiest and favorable to the wallet recipe that I have ever used.  Just wish that I could have got a photo of it flying out of my freezer and out the window when my husband and I were trying to relocate out 32ft 5th wheel some years back!!

followed all directions and measurements, the marshmallow cream was too much. I ended up with soft gooey peanut butter cream. I redid  the recipe using half the amount of marshmallow and it was a little better.

I made this fudge recipe tonight and it turned out perfect.  I have attempted making fudge a  few times in my 54 years, but it would never set for me.  Not sure what I was doing wrong, but tonight it set perfectly.  I even got to cut it with a knife this time!!  GREAT RECIPE FOR FUDGE!! 
 Cool cool double cool  :o)      Thanks, Pam for your moms recipe............ it's great

I made this recipe exactly as written. Same exact ingredients and same exact measurements with no tweaks or changes whatsoever. The only thing “extra” I did was to use a candy thermometer to ensure my mixture reached the correct soft ball temperature. While the recipe says to boil for 5 minutes, on my stove it took 6.5 minutes to get to the soft ball temperature. Other than that, this is an excellent recipe. Next time I may add a smidge more peanut butter, but it’s great exactly as is. Nice and easy!

I found that if you don't let it boil for 5 minutes, it will become a sort of spread that you can then put in between 2 halves of a rice krispies treat.

I like some of the others mixed the peanut butter, vanilla and marshmallow fluff first. Is this where I went wrong? This recipe failed miserably. It tastes good but there is no way it is holding its form. I have let it sit for 6 hours and it is falling apart.

These turned out great. I did change the recipe up a little and made it with less marshmallow fluff (13oz is what I used) and I added in 1/4 cup more of peanut butter. My son can't get enough!

This worked perfectly. I did cook it in the microwave in a large ceramic bowl (the yellow one of the 3 bowl set). Bring to a boil watching carefully so that it does not overflow. Turn down to power level 4 and cook for 5 minutes. (I check for softball by dropping a drip or two in cold water to see if it forms a ball. Be sure to use a pot holder as bowl will be hot.)

I haven't made fudge in years, but I was looking for a gluten free recipe for someone at my husband's work place. This worked out wonderfully and was so easy to put together. I'm from New England so anything you use Fluff in usually comes out fabulous.

The only recommendation is do not use Jif. I love it for every other thing in the world but Skippy sets up better because it's not as oily. I have made this recipe for many years and forgot that little piece of info once and it wouldn't get hard in the FREEZER!!! lol   Thought I invented a new type of antifreeze.

My boyfriend loves peanut butter fudge, so I thought I'd give this a try. I followed the recipe exactly and it was very simple to make with a good taste, but it was a little boring to me. Tasted like thicker, grainy peanut butter. Now, I'm not a huge PB fan so maybe that's part of it, but I like fudge to be smooth and creamy and this... just wasn't it for me. I live in the south so I know that humidity can be a factor and cause crystallization, but I was sure to wait for a dry day to make this. I have to say though, it did set up nice and quickly on the kitchen counter so it was nice not having to wait for what feels like forever to try it. I later dipped the cubed fudge into some chocolate and it tasted just like Reese cups! So while I didn't care for this as a fudge, it was a nice candy replacement. Regardless of what I did, everyone else who ate it enjoyed it and went back for more.

This recipe was delicious! I brought it to school and everyone devoured it . People have been asking me everyday if I could make fudge for them. Although I recommend that when you put the fudge on a dish try putting wax paper down so it doesn't stick and it just come right out, ready to be cut. Other then that this recipe s something I have made over and over. Great for kids or a desert to bring to a party.

Great recipe and not too difficult to make.  I substituted a little of the marshmallow creme for some extra peanut butter because I like a little more PB flavor.  Would recommend you try this one!

I tried this fudge, and the taste was superb,but it wouldnt set up...even after 24 hours in the freezer! After the second day of being frozen, it started to firm. Because of this, I gave it 4 stars. Not knowing what I may have done to make this happen, I will try it again because we liked it outside of that.

Easy fudge recipe.  This recipe tasted peanutty, but definitely looked more like a maple walnut fudge as apposed to a peanut butter fudge.  I'm going to try adding less marshmallow cream.  I'm hoping that will give it more texture and a better "color."

A little too creamy (mushy) but otherwise very tasty!

Tastes great. I'm only giving it four stars b/c I had a really difficult time cutting it without bits crumbling off the edges. I used one jar of marshmallow cream (7oz) instead of the full two cups--maybe that's the reason. Still worked for my christmas candy gift boxes though!

Great recipe. Excellent flavor and so easy. I added a half a cup of chopped peanuts. Haven't tried the finished product but the "spoon" test says it's a winner!
