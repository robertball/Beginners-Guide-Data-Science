This cake is FANTASTIC! I've made it a thousand times and it never fails to disappoint. For those of us watching our figures using all "lite" or "Sugar free" possibilities (Jello, Whipped topping, cake) the cake STILL tastes wonderful. Especially chilled. Yum.

I made my own chocolate cake but I did follow the recipe in assembling it. I poured some of the(liquid)Jell-O onto the cake but I kept most of it refrigerated till it became actual (solid)jello. What I did was I had my Jell-O solidify in a thin layer (I used a cake sheet pan) and I cut it up. Then I put the cut-up jello pieces between each layer of cake along with the cream and cherries (fresh cherries taste lots better). What I LOVED about this recipe was the frosting which really isn't frosting but a cream. It tasted perfect with a chocolate cake! Thanks for the recipe!

This is as good as it looks. I didn't change a thing. Great if you are looking to do a few things ahead of time. I prepared the cake and jello mixture,covered with aluminum foil, refrigerated it overnight and finished the next day.
