It had a wonderful complex flavor - I did not have any loomi - so subbed kefir lime leaf, and I doubled the liquid to 2 cups. It tasted like I was at a Middle-Eastern restaurant.

Needs at least one more cup of water. I was skeptical about the amount of liquid, but have never pre-soaked rice before, and didn't know how much of a difference that would make in need for liquid. Turns out, not enough to overcome the 1.5 C rice to 1 C liquid. While the rice came out crunchy, we did like the flavors.
