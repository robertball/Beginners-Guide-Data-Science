This was super good!  I tweeked it with some ideas from the French Onion Soup VII recipe on this site. I used butter instead of oil and veg broth instead of beef broth.  I also just put a regular slice of bread on top along with a slice of muenster cheese and broiled.  Super good.  My husband and I both had a bowl and it seemed like the leftovers will feed us several more times.

Tried this tonight and it was yummy!  I made it just as directed with just a couple of exceptions.  I like my soup salty so I added an extra 1/4 tsp of salt, and I put a square of bread with mozzarella on top in the bottom of each individual crock and microwaved to melt the cheese before adding the soup; I then put another square of bread on top the soup and covered the entire top of each crock with more mozzarella and melted the cheese on the crocks under the broiler until each was ever so slightly browned.  The recipe says it serves four but I used two fairly large individual bean-pot crocks and it was the perfect amount to fill both with room for the bread besides.  Very hearty and filling, a meal in itself.  I will definitely make this again but may try swiss cheese on top next time as many similar recipes call for swiss.  If you like onion soup as prepared in fine restaurants, you'll like this; it's easy to make and tasty too!

OMG. Best onion soup EVER! As usual, I made some slight modifications, substituting Swiss Gruyère in place of the recipe’s shredded mozzarella. Why? Because Gruyère is what I had on hand (you’ve done it , too ). I also added a splash of red wine during the last 5 minutes of cooking. Why?Because I like red wine, that’s why. Michael David Winery’s Petite Petit, if you wish to replicate my gustatory experience. You’re welcome!

I tried this recipe tonight with leeks and faux beef broth, since we are vegetarian, and it was fantastic!

I loved this!! I made my own vegetarian immigration beef broth with 8 cups of water, and adding tamari, Worcester sauce, vegetarian immigration chicken soup stock, garlic powder, cracked black pepper, and table salt. I also topped off the baguette slices with shredded mozarella, mild cheddar and provolone cheese.
