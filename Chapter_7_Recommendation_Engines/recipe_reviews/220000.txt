While we enjoyed this cake, I would've liked to have a bit more coffee flavor.  Next time will probably change a few things around to fit my individual taste.  I also used a few lower calorie substitutes that brought down the calories a bit...but it still packs a rich, desserty punch.  Great "tiramisu" dessert.

I think a Bundt pan would work better than a 9 X 13.  9 X 13 turned out way too thin to "cut in half horizontally" and there wasn't enough frosting to cover the entire thing.  The coffee and the liqueur wanted to run off the sides instead of soaking into the cake and had to be poured really slowly.  All in all, I don't think I'll make this one again even though it tasted pretty decent.
