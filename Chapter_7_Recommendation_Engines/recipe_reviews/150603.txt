I thought these cookies would be sooo yummy and delicious because of the sweetened condensed milk but as it turns out, I think that the recipe had too much flour.  The turned out kind of chalky.  Especially after having to use more flour when rolling out the dough.  Next time, I will omit some of the flour.
