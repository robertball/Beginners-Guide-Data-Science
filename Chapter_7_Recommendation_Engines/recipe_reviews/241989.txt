Excellent dessert! The only think I left out was the almonds because I didn't have them, but I made the sauce as directed and it was really good. I wasn't sure if this "fancier" version of baked peaches would be worth the trouble, but I tried two of the peach halves with just butter, brown sugar and cinnamon, as most baked peach recipes out there call for, and I have to say that in this case, the simple version, which I can only describe as "very sweet", didn't quite compare. I think maybe the brandy and the pinch of salt lent this sauce a touch of sophistication and slight savoury-ness that made it stand out.

Delicious!!! The brandy gives a nice kick to the sauce and is not overpowering. The sauce is sweet and gooey and the almonds add some nice flavor and texture. When mixed with vanilla ice cream the flavors are out of this world.

Exactly like it said, just OK.  It wasn't bad.  Only used 2 peaches, definitely need at least 3 peaches, probably better with four.  Lots of leftover sauce with 2.

For my taste, the sauce recipe needs some work to put on peaches. Itâ€™s great on ice cream. Something about using honey in this makes for a gloopy sauce, kind of strange. Instead of almonds, pecans would work better for the flavor profile. Overall, a good starting point. Try it then experiment with other ingredients.

Silly me ... I don't like alcohol so left of brandy. Ran out of honey so used real maple syrup. Used microwave instead of pan to create sauce.  Excellent !
