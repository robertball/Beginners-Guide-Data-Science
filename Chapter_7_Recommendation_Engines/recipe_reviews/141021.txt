I followed the recipe and followed a recommendation of one reviewer, that claimed the A1 was too strong.  I cut back to 2 tablespoons instead of the excessive 1/2 cup that it calls for.  These were ok, and everyone "claimed" they liked them, but I didn't think they were very tasty.  There are much better shrimp recipes out there.  I will not make this again.

Tossed just-cooked shrimp with warm sauce then served.  Nice compliment to the rest of our Super Bowl spread.  A little too A1-y for me to rate it a perfect 5 stars.

The good news is the shrimp were all eaten - the bad news is that the sauce tasted too much like A-1.  Nobody was raving about the sauce.  Will I do this recipe again?  Probably not. But I am glad we tried it.  A-1 will remain a "beef" sauce.

We used Heinz 57 sauce and only about  3/4 c. Also, thickened with corn starch instead of flour. It was delicious!!!
