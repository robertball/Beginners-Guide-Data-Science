I made this for a friend who has to follow a gluten free diet.  She was so surprised to have a cake she could actually eat safely.  I thought the orange flavor was overwhelmed by the spices, but I believe they can be adjusted.  Thanks for a gluten free recipe that doesn't cost too much to make.

Very nice flavour,hard to believe there is no flour. Best eaten the day it's baked. Mine was completely baked in 40 minutes. I would definitely recommend lining the bottom of the pan w/parchment, I used a well-buttered non-stick pan and the cake was a bit difficult to remove intact.

I made this cake today and I was very impressed how well it turned out. It is a very simple and easy recipe that turned out tasting great.We had it for dessert topped with cool whip and it tasted like pumpkin pie. Will definately be making this again.What a great healthy alternative.

Served it to guests topped with a cream cheese frosting flavored with a little orange extract (very little, just an enhancement) and they raved over it.  It's a very dense cake, like a brownie and small pieces are very filling.  I didn't tell them until after dinner that it was made from a can of beans. :-)

Next time I think I"ll double the recipe and bake it in a springform pan so that I can more easily remove it from the pan and also so that it will bake more evenly.  Baking it in the square pan did result in more hardened corners which can be great for brownies but not so great for cakes.  Baking it in the springform pan will also allow it to more easily be removed to frost it on all sides.  It did kind of crumble while trying to remove the first pieces from the square pan.

I made half this recipe with 1 cup chickpeas and 2 eggs and used honey instead of sugar. I used half an orange and omitted the spices and baked in a shallow pan. I was really impressed with the results. Baked 40 minutes. Basic easy cake.

The first time I made this I thought it was too crumbly...  then I realized that I had used a full 19 oz. can of beans....   I was disappointed that it didn't taste like orange, rather more like pumpkin flavour...  So I made it again, eliminating the spices and using 1 and 1/2 cu beans, adding vanilla and orange extracts, a whole orange, unpeeled along with 1/3 cu of cream cheese.   I processed the whole thing in the processor and it turned out great.....   and it tasted like orange!

OMG... So bad.  I even went back and double checked the recipe to make sure I didn't miss an ingredient or step.  Never again.

Pretty good! Next time I'll try it without the ground cloves as I found the spice a bit over powering.

I made this with some dried chickpeas I cooked in the instant pot that were just a little softer than canned chickpeas.  I cooked the cake for 30 minutes and it came out with the texture similar to a sponge cake throughout.  It is very aromatic.  Cut into small pieces and topped with a dollop of whipped cream, this would be good to take to a brunch.

I've made this cake twice now, to rave reviews. I didn't have an orange so I used 2 limes. Agree with others that the spice overwhelmed the citrus but it was so delicious that it didn't matter. The only addition was a glaze made with the zest and juice of 1 lime,  1 T butter and about a cup or less of icing sugar. Looked a bit strange with the zest but WOW did it ever pack a lime punch. I will make this cake again and again, and again.

I really enjoyed this recipe. Was looking for healthier protein rich, low-carb,etc, dessert options for my husband to take the edge off dieting. Was pleasantly surprised by the taste and texture of this recipe and was tempted to eat the whole thing myself! (and I'm not even much of a spice cake fan)  I substituted the white sugar with healthier less processed sugars (combination of panella, sugar in the raw, etc) to increase the nutritional value and it was wonderful.  Its a guilt-free treat my husband can eat any time of day when gets a sweet tooth.  Shhhh, just don't tell him or the kids it's garbanzo beans!
