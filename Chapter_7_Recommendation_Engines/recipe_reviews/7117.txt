Great bread! I don't have a bread machine, so I did the following: 1.) Let the yeast “bloom” in 115 degree water, then added the yeast/water mix and molasses & oil to the dry ingredients, kneading for about five minutes in my KitchenAid. 2.) I made a "rustic loaf" by forming the dough into an oval on a cookie sheet (oiled and sprinkled with cornmeal) and let rise for about an hour. 3.) Baked it at 375 for 40 min and it came out perfect. It looked pretty with some slashes and an egg wash to make it shiny, and it tastes great! Wish I had had some caraway seeds to add, but I will buy some before I make this again as I'm sure the bread would only be better with their addition. Thanks for the recipe - I'll definitely use it again!

This indeed was a great recipe! So very flavorful! I didn't have rye flour so I substitued the same amount of whole wheat flour, even added the caraway seeds and it just turned out incredibly yummy!

I added slightly more water, about 1/3 cup more. And used butter instead of the vegetable oil( was all out of the oil) but it tasted great. Made a nice big freeform loaf. Not to light but not really overly dense either. Will make again. Thanks

Oh...my....GOD!  The smell of this bread baking in my breadmaker woke me up out of a deep sleep and I actually got out of bed!  It took me a minute or two to realise it was like 4 am and though the smell was awesome, I should probably consider sleeping more before eating it :P  Seriously though, it has a rich rich taste, great toasted with peanut butter and for sandwiches.  I made mine on the medium crust setting and it was a little tough on the outside, this time I'm doing it on the light crust.  Also I have a hard time digesting refined flour so I put 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 1 cup of all purpose.  DEFINATELY worth a try to all of you rye junkies out there!

The flavor of this bread was really good, I think it was my foul-up and  didn't have the crust setting right on the machine or something, but the crust was hard and I didn't care for that part. This was the first loaf of bread that I have ever cooked and the recipe was completely simple to follow. I really enjoyed this.

Very good bread.  I used whole wheat flour instead of white and I increased the caraway seed to 1 tsp.  I don't have a bread machine, so I kneaded it in my Kitchen Aid mixer.  I ended up having to add an extra 1/4 cup of flour, as the dough was a little too wet.  I will try cutting the water to one cup next time.  I let it rise for one hour then punched down and put in a 9X5 loaf pan.  I let it rise another 45 minutes and then baked at 375 for 45 minutes.  Next time I would use an 8X4 loaf pan for a taller loaf.  I will certainly make it again!

This is my second time making this bread.  The first time it was too dense and sweet.  This time I doubled the recipe. Added 1 extra TBS molasses, cut the sugar in half, added 1 extra TBS cocoa powder and put in 1 TBS caraway seed. Did 5 tsp dry active yeast.  I also used bread flour instead of all purpose flour. Kneaded it in my Kitchenaid mixer with the dough hook for 10 minutes until it became stretchy.  put it in a greased bowl and let it rise for 1 hour.  formed it into rounds and baked at 375 for 45 min.  YUMMY!

Very delicious, will make again. Place ingredients in bread machine, added one extra tsp of caraway seeds. Put on dough cycle and then let bread raise on it's own. Baked 25 minutes at 375 degree's.

DELICIOUS!! It took about 5 mins of prep work and made my house smell like a bakery! I can't wait to make it again, most of the loaf was gone in one sitting! The only thin I would change is put in 1 tbsp of molasses instead of 2 b/c I found it to be quite sweet.

This bread was nothing that I would call rye bread.  It was more like a sweet brown bread of some sort.  I will not be making this again.  I made it for reubens and we were sorely disappointed.

Other reviewers have said that this bread is very dense and heavy.  I added a teaspoon of soy lecithin granules and a tablespoon of vital wheat gluten and found that this was not too dense and heavy.  It's my new favorite rye.

I was looking for a rye bread on which to make cucumber sandwiches and I really like this one. I started it in the bread maker on the dough cycle then put it in a pan to rise a bit before baking it. I baked it at 375 as one reviewer suggested. I used a mini loaf pan and baked for 30 mins. The only thing I did differently after making the first loaf was add more caraway seeds because they are so scrumptious

This bread was amazing! I chose to make it by hand and had to add about another 1/8 cup of water to get the dough to work. All I had was bead molasses so I cut the sugar down to 1.5 tbsps. We LOVE caraway so I did 4 tsps. I formed a round rustic loaf and cut slashes in the top. My husband and I ate half the round for dinner with a cabbage/lentil/ham based soup and it was delicious. It took about an hour to rise. I sat the pan on a cooling rack atop my toaster oven while baking something else. I baked it at 375 for 50 minutes. If making by hand proofing your yeast with the sugar, molasses and WARM water is a must!

This was WAY too sweet. It was also very dense. It did not raise properly despite using good yeast.

I've declared this a fail-proof recipe! I don't have a bread machine so I made this by hand. Yeast and I have never been great friends, and I thought I failed after my dough didn't really rise after an hour...however, during the second rising, it came to life to produce delicious bread! Only 4 stars because it was a little sweeter than expected.

Nice mild tasting rye bread. Would double caraway seed next time, though. Made me crave pastrami or corned beef and hot mustard sandwiches with dill pickles. Baked 40 minutes at 360. Made one lovely round loaf on the pizza stone.

Great Bread. It's lightly sweet with a tiny taste of caraway, perfect. I think it is the best bread I've made from AR thus far. But a reminder to those wanting a big, fluffy loaf, rye bread is a dense bread. But seriously, it is sooo good.

I loved this bread. It was a bit sweeter than I would prefer, but lovely and moist. I took the advice of another reviewer and doubled the recipe - only to start panicking that it might be too large a loaf for my machine! I needn't have worried as it came out beautifully - a large loaf, certainly, but quite delicious. I only used half the amount of brown sugar mentioned, so will try less molasses next time.

Great tasting rye bread.  Wonderful for toasting and having peanut butter.  My husband loves rye bread and I got thumbs up with this.  It is a little on the heavy side.  It is very tasty.

I made this recipe today in my bread machine and it is fantastic! I didn't have rye flour, so I subbed whole wheat flour and used canola oil instead of vegetable. I also used warm water (didn't get an exact temperature, just warm out of the tap) and used 1 1/2 tsp salt as others suggested. Not sure if it made a difference but I also used 2 1/4 tsp yeast--bought in in bulk--instead of the single use packets I've used before. I followed the instructions for my bread machine and this bread rose more than any other bread I've made! Great taste and texture and was perfect for the Reuben sandwiches that we had for dinner!

This recipe made a perfect loaf of bread. I followed the directions on the first page of the most helpful reviews because I don't have a bread machine. Next time as a personal preference I will omit the molasses and cocoa powder. Still five-star bread!

Excellent recipe! The only changes I made were to increase the caraway seed to 1tsp, and I used light olive oil for the vegetable oil. It turned out perfect! My only complaint is that it makes just one loaf... next time I will double the recipe!!

Tasty bread easy to make in the bread maker using the white cycle (mine doesn't have a basic).  The bread didn't rise very much which I was surprised given the amount of yeast.

My first time at Rye bread and it turned out very good! Good enough that a lady from Europe (my barber)who was complaining about not being able to get good rye bread here bought some of mine! She also asked for me to make more for here and her family! I did make a couple of small changes. This is for a double batch of dough. I used 3 tsp caraway, added 2 Tbs of vital wheat gluten, and bread flour instead of AP.  Next time I will try the AP flour to see what the difference might be. I did the mixing in my Kitchen Aid and then worked it further on the bread board. Let it rise for an hour in a bowl sprayed with Pam and then formed into boules and proofed in floured wicker baskets. Slashed the tops and put on the baking stone for 35 minutes at 375 degrees. I did leave it in a bit longer until the thermometer read 205*. What a wonderful fragrance when they were baking!

I won't make again. The crust was too hard even baking it on light in my bread machine. Was more like pumpernickle rather than rye. Too dense and not very moist. I like another user will keep searching for another rye bread recipe.

Well, my Austrian husband is very happy today!  He said that he hasn't had a bread like this in the US.  He loved it!  For the people who said that theirs was too sweet, it was probably due to fact that they used syrup, and not true molassas, which is not sweet at all.  I found this dough very hard to mix and was worried that it wasn't rising very much and was heavy.  No worries after it was done! I mad a round artisan loaf and mixed 1T carraway seeds in and sprikled more on top. Awesome!  Now a family favorite.  Thanks for sharing!

I just became a registered user in order to rate this recipe.  It is excellent. I used the basic setting on my bread maker and it came out perfectly.  I did add more caraway seeds (1 tsp).  It was dense, moist, flavorful. Really good.

Made this twice - first time strictly by the recipe, and it came out terrific! Very nice and perfect taste. Husband said was a bit too sweet, so second time, I omitted the sugar altogether, just added the molasses - this is when the surface is somewhat irregular, and doesn't rise as much, but still is wonderful. A definite keeper

Interesting recipe! I don't have a bread machine so I followed the suggestions of another reviewer. The yeast bloomed nicely and I mixed the dough in my Kitchen-Aide for 5 mins. It sat for an hour under a damp towel in my kitchen and rose nicely. I increased the amount of caraway seeds and coated the bread with an eggwash before baking. Also sprinkled caraway seeds on top. Baked at 375 for 40 mins and it turned out just fine. Next time I might leave the molasses out if I can..I prefer a lighter rye. This one was a little too close to pumpernickel for me. But overall a nice simple recipe.

Good bread. Nice and dense. I used whole wheat flour in place of the all purpose flour, used more syrup in place of the brown sugar, and omitted the caraway seeds because I didn't have any. I thought the bread a bit too sweet, and would perhaps half the second portion of brown sugar/syrup in the future. If not enough liquid, add a tablespoon of water when mixing.

Fantastic recipe. I was very happy that I got a nice rise, which can be very hard when using rye or whole wheat flour. The second time I made it, I added chopped fresh dill and a tsp. of minced garlic. Wonderful. Thanks so much for posting this recipe.

I wanted a European-style dark rye to satisfy my German family members, and this recipe is exactly what I was looking for - nice flavor and internal texture without having the density of a rock. This bread was heavenly; my first thought was "Rubens!". Minor-ish tweaks: 1) I used the full recipe to make one big loaf, and did not use a bread machine. 2) I followed the ingredients exactly, but added a little bit of extra water because my mixer was struggling with the knead. 3) For the second rise, I shaped the dough into a round loaf, made 3 slashes in the top, dusted with flour, and let it rise on parchment paper in a covered bowl for another hour or so. From here, I used the Dutch Oven method and carefully lifted the parchment and dough into a *preheated* dutch oven, put the lid on, and baked at 425 for 30 minutes. Then I took the lid off and baked it another 10-12 minutes to firm up the crust. The end result was a beautiful artisan loaf. It weighed 1-pound, 14 oz, and reached an internal temp of 205 degrees. Perfect!

I used the useful hint from a review (No Bread Machine) Did the yeast in 1/3 cup water 115 degree ....Living in a low humidity state, I turned oven on to 400 --preheat(turn off!!)....set a pan water next to the dough(covered) --- let rise for an hr Took out, punched, divided into 3 small loafs, set on cookie sheet ---let rise for another 40 min(doubled in size) Baked for 15 min...mmmm
BTW---No caraway seeds and no Cocoa

This bread is fantastic! Great flavor, wonderful texture, beautiful color. The first time I made it I didn't have caraway seeds, but it was still very good. The second time I used the seeds and it was amazing! I will use this recipe at least once a week.

Dense loaf with good flavor - I should have warmed my water before putting it in the bread machine pan.  Will try that next time to see if I get a larger, lighter loaf.  Also added more caraway seeds - about 4 times as many!

Have made this several times. Not bad but as with other rye  home recipes it never has that "bakery" flavor.  I ordered rye sour and rye loaf improver from K Arthur flour and added some of both.  Definitely adds to the flavor, will have to play a bit more and work out the kinks.

Excellent!  Definitely do light crust and add more caraway (I did 1.5 tsp).  Many others reviewers recommended both of these tips.

This turned out really dense and heavy.  The taste was very good, though I would use more caraway seeds if I made it again.  It was just too dense to use for a sandwich for my taste, which is what I made it for.  Will make it again if I can figure out the texture issue.

Really good bread.  Made following the recipe, with exception to reducing the brown sugar to 2 T as a few other reviewers felt it was too sweet with 3.  This loaf didn't rise as well as some of my other breads, but that may be due to some inadvertant thing I did.  Made in the dough cycle of my bread machine and baked in the oven.  Will definitely make again.

I made this twice, once with a loaf pan and another time using the bread machine. On both occassions, I found the dough was a little sticky because I had subtituted molasses for honey. After the first rise, it's hard to get it to form a smooth tight surface for the second proving. The finished bread had a somewhat irregular surface. Nonetheless the taste and texture was excellent. Toast the slices and serve with fresh butter. Makes a perfect breakfast. Then, for the third try, I got some molasses and the result was fantastic!

Very good flavor and texture. I left out the caraway seeds (personal preference) and did the dough in the bread machine. I formed the dough into a free form loaf on a cookie sheet and baked it at 350 for about 25 minutes after the second rise. Better than a lot of the store bought rye breads I have tried.

Used Dough cycle on the bread machine, because I wanted to make two small loaves of rye bread for appetizers.  The dough seemed quite dense when I removed it from the bread pan, but the 2 loaves turned out great and the flavor is exceptional.

This bread is MARVELOUS!  I live above 5000 feet, so I reduced the yeast to 1 1/8 teaspoon, and added an extra 1/8 teaspoon of salt.  I also tend to get very thick bread using all-purpose flour, so I chose to use bread flour instead.  The end result was a PERFECT rise, with a light, fluffy loaf full of flavor!  My picky fiance is hooked and declaired this is new "favorite"!  Thankyou!

I have been making this recipe for about a year now, sorry I thought I had already rated it! This is a perfect recipe. The flavor and texture of the bread is spot on. The only tiny change I made after the first few times of making this was to up the caraway seed to 1 Tbs per my husband's request. He wanted it to be "even ryeier". Thank you for posting this recipe it is a staple around my house now. 10 stars if I could!

This is the best rye bread I've ever tasted! I followed the exact recipe but used the "dough" cycle in my bread machine, and then I made 12 rolls and baked them on a cookie sheet. Delicious!

I gave this a four however I will have to work on it a bit.  I have a wheat free diet.  I substituted regular all purpose flour with gluten free.  I added an extra ½ cup rye.  I was almost out of all purpose so I had to add half cup mixture of smelt and oat flour.  My dough was too wet.  The taste was great I will have to check consistency next time.  I cooked in the oven 375 did not need 30 mins.  Made a pretty loaf.  This is the best rye recipe I have found to fix into a wheat free loaf.

This has very good flavor. My only complaint is that it didn't rise as much as I had hoped. I don't know if this was due to my machine or the recipe. I think I will try it again and see if I have the same results.

Great recipe. I’m a mom of 5. Never buy bread. This is without a doubt part of my staple bread line up for the family
 I added more caraway and baked in a pottery bowl. Perfect!!!

loved it, did a few changes. I put 2 cups of rye flour and 1&1/2 regular flour, left out the brown sugar and added caraway 2tsp, fennel, 1 tsp and a full heaping tablespoon of dried dill. It was perfect, smelled so good and tasted amazing.

The dough wasn't wet enough to form a proper ball, so I had to add a little water. And then it was a bit crumbly. It was so tasty that I do plan to try it again, with special attention to moisture.

AWESOME! i have saved this recipe for my favourites and have lost count of how many times i've made it. I have to make it a lot b/c it is a bit too popular! :)
The only thing i might change is add a bit more olive oil. It tends to help with the mixing.
Also, i have no idea what caraway seed is and have never used it and my bread has turned out fine every time without it :)

It is our favorite. It is our favorite. As it was mentioned in previous reviews I used 1,5 teaspoon of salt and 1 tablespoon of caraway seed

loved this bread. Did it by hand and let it rise till doubled in size(about 2 hours). Baked it in a cast iron dutch oven, warmed cast iron in oven. Baked covered for 30 minutes and uncovered for the last 15 minutes.

Does taste of rye.  However, this recipe's liquid to flour ratio is way off, and yielded a heavy, thick, and dense crumb.  Very unpleasant.  The yeast couldn't even make proper cells.

Delicious and easy, good flavor.  I did have to cook it a little longer than the regular bread machine cycle, that may be because of changes I made.  I substituted 1/2 cup whole wheat for some of the all purpose flour and added a tsp of gluten, used 1 T of regular sugar and 1 T stevia (did not have brown sugar) and added extra caraway seeds.  Used basic setting, light crust.

This was great! Definitely a keeper. I used 2 tsp of caraway for a stronger flavor. I don't use a bread machine, just my kitchen aid and then bake in the oven at 375 for ~35 min. It made a dense but soft loaf with a great texture for sandwiches.

Great recipe, I added about 1/2 cup caraway seeds and made into oven bread.  Definitely keep the flour ratios as is, any more will make it too dense.

Delicious!! I made the dough in the bread machine, then baked it in an oval loaf on a parchment lined baking sheet. Rose nicely. Dense, but not overly dense, for this type of bread. I did add more caraway seeds, and will probably add even more next time. Can't wait to use it for grilled cheese sandwiches! Thanks for sharing!!

A good rye bread but I found it needed more caraway.  Still toying with the amount but 2 tsp was a minimum for us.

I did like this recipe! It was very easy to follow. Personally though i did not like the molasses flavor (which i never used in bread before, that;s why i wanted to try) I did make it again though and then used only 'half' a tablespoon of molasses, left out the cocoa and kinda substituted the missing liquid with a little bit more oil and water! Also used a bit more carawayseeds then. I liked it a lot better then, however i'm still messing around with it. Maybe try a bit more salt next time or add yet another flavor! Guess it would turn this into a complete different recipe, though i'm glad to have found it and use it as a base! Thank you!

This was good but very dense and I only used 1 1/2 cups all purpose flour.  It was very good toasted but not really good for sandwiches.  Would make a good dip bowl tho.

Delicious! I was a little wary of all the sugar (molasses and brown sugar) but I guess it was to counteract the bitterness of the cocoa powder. I will definitely make this again. I made the dough in the bread machine and baked it in the oven.

Excellent.  This bread doesn't have a super strong rye flavor, it is a cross between whole wheat and rye flavor.  This bread slices well for sandwiches, also tastes great toasted with butter & jam, or for cheese melts.  It kept for several day and was also great fresh.  Since it's vegan, next time I'll try adding the ingredients to the machine the night before and setting the timer.  Thanks for the great recipe!
Update Note: Setting the timer overnight totally worked, and we had delicious hot bread at breakfast.  Using Red Star Active Dry Yeast also worked just fine as bread machine yeast.

I've made this bread twice now following instructions and feel it didn't rise as much as it should have.  My yeast is fresh and other loaves of bread I made last week turned out fine.   The crust came out rock hard the first time - so the second time I took it out of the machine 15 early...again rock hard.  The taste is ok - no rye taste.  I imagined this bread to be light and fluffy and large like the picture.  I guess I will keep searching for the right rye bread recipe for me.  The turkeys and the deer in my backyard seem to be enjoying this rye!

I made this Christmas morning because I was having ham for dinner. I let the bread maker knead it. Then I put it in the oven at 375 degrees for around 40 minutes. I used an egg wash on the top before baking. It was beautiful and tastes wonderful. The only thing that I changed was subbing 1 T. of honey for 1 T. of the molasses. I don't care for molasses. When I starting cutting it my brother ate a few slices right then before dinner. We all love it and I know that I'll be making it many times in the future. I'm even eating it with my breakfast. It couldn't be better. It's not too dense and it raised just fine. Thanks for posting it.

Loved the taste, but as another reviewer stated, the crust got really hard the next couple days. My machine dosen't have a crust setting, so will try coating with some butter while still warm next time, and storing in a large ziplock bag. This seems to help when I make white bread.

Yummy!  I tripled the recipe so that I could have extra bread to freeze; I was uneasy to triple a recipe I'd ever tried before, but I'm definitely not regretting it!  I omitted the molasses and caraway seed, and replaced the cocoa powder with carob powder.  I didn't use a bread machine but it turned out fantastic anyway!  I'm going to go make a second batch now - thank you!

The only adjustment I made was to use potato water (leftover from draining cooked potatoes) for the plain water.  Made a loaf & took it to a church brunch yesterday without even tasting it first.  It disappeared so fast I almost didn't get a slice.  I was concerned that it would be too sweet, but it was just right.  The sugar seemed to heighten the other flavors.  Definitely a keeper.

Absolutely great bread!! I didn't add the caraway seeds cause my family doesn't like them. Still turned out very flavourful. I am really impressed with how well this bread turned out in the breadmaker.
