Completely flat. I had a puddle of dough in the pan, with chocolate chips hills sticking up. I thought it was because I tried to hurry and not refrigerate as stated...so I put the remaining half of the dough in the fridge overnight. Next morning, I attempted to bake the chilled half and still ended up with puddles. Look elsewhere for a good chocolate chip cookie recipe--

This recipes has too many chocoolate chips and not enough flour. I followed the recipe exactly and they were flat...
It needs at least 1/2 cup more flour.

They tasted great but I changed it instead of semi-sweet chocolate chips I used butterscotch and I only used 1 cup instead of 1 1/2 cups that makes them better

Great cookies, although you can't buy white chocolate chips in Germany and I had to use white chocolate. My familiy, friends and the people I work with love them!

The cookie never "set up".  Not enough flour or too much butter.  I ended up spreading all the batter in a jelly roll pan to attempt bars.  Very tasty, but falls apart

these are great cookies , for the 3 chocolates,I substitute about 1 1/2 cups of walnuts, one 8 oz bag of health bar pieces and one bag of chocolate chunks,  I always make an extra batch to freeze.  PS if you make them too big they come out flat, I use a heaping teaspoon to  measure them out

Mine spread out into thin blobs.  I melted the butter first as specified, but didn't let it cool very long, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. They still tasted good!

Amazing! I will never make chocolate chip cookies again without using 3 different types of chips! Wonderfully crispy, too.

Super easy? No.
Worth the effort? Yes, if you like a nice crunchy cookie, add a little cream of Tartar.

The taste was excellent - although mine came out flat, too.  They puffed a little while cooking, but as soon as they started cooling on the pan - they flattened out & were flimsy.  (They became crispy after completely cooling)  I did use salted butter & omitted the tsp. of salt.  Could that be why???

Tasted great but there were so many chocolate chips that they wouldn't bake evenly, so I basically got burned edges and way too gooey middles. Next time I make it I'm putting in less chips and maybe more flour.

My friend and Accidentally messed up this recipe but it made for great cookies we used 2 cups of milk chocolate and semi but not white chocolate. As well as no nuts. I loved it.
