If possible, make this easy on yourself, save yourself an extra pan and saute the chops in an ovenproof skillet - no need to transfer the chops to another pan.  This is seriously lacking seasoning as written, definitely wanting for more than just salt and pepper.  So... instead of chicken broth I used a dry white wine - a mix of broth and wine would be good too.  I left the chops seasoned as is, with just salt and pepper, because I seasoned the bread crumb/Parmesan mixture with fresh minced garlic, sage and parsley. In addition to heightened flavor this gave the topping nice color interest as well. I served the chops on a bed of baby arugula that I lightly dressed with equal measures of olive oil and fresh lemon juice.  Also served side dishes of roasted fresh baby artichokes and "Pasta Basico," also from this site.  The chops were just delicious - juicy, tender, and cooked perfectly after 30 minutes in the oven. The wine, fresh sage, parsley and garlic were invaluable and necessary contributions to this dish. Other herbs would work well too.  The crumb topping was quite nice, deliciously flavored and golden brown, but I did cut back on the cheese - the amount called for was more than I thought necessary.  The chopped onion and pan juices were excellent, adding more flavor as well as texture. With just a little embellishment (i.e. seasoning), this is easily exquisite, 5-star quality.

Absolutely delicious! My husband was shocked! I bought my veal chops at discount because they were frozen. Even after defrosting them they were so tender. If you love onions add more, and don't be shy on the bread crumbs. I used italian flavored bread crumbs. I can't wait to make this meal for my parents when they come into town!

This recipe is amazing and has become a new "regular" dish in my house. Because the veal chops in my parts leave much to be desired, I've been using 3/4" veal scallops, doubled the onions and a splash of white wine instead of stock to really impress the dinner guests.

I am always on the lookout for veal recipes and, boy, am I glad I found this one.  Excellent taste and very easy to put together.  I added minced garlic because we are garlic-heads around here.  Yummy, both my husband and I savored every bite.

My husband loved this! I substituted the chicken broth with french onion soup base and omitted the parmasan cheese since we aren't cheese fans. Served with mashed potatos and used some of the sauce as gravy. Definitely will make again.

Amazing recipe and so tasty!  I added 2 small cloves of minced garlic to the onions and used Panko bread crumbs instead per someone's post.  Great easy dinner.  Probably would be good with pork chops too.

These chops came out amazing. I added about 5 cloves of garlic sliced to the bed of onions, and the bottom of the baking dish smelt like pure heaven when I took it out of the oven. I feel like I was cheated, because I cooked a mornay sauce to go with the chops not thinking I would have some prime drippings to serve the meat with. While the mornay went perfectly with the veal, it was an absolute waste to just let the onion/garlic in the dish go to waste. Next time I pick up some veal, I'm going to do the dish justice and let the recipe stand on it's own feet.

Love this recipe, though I did make a few changes to it.  Taking some advice from naples.  I used part broth and part white wine.  I had no breadcrumbs or sage but did have croutons and bell seasoning.  I crushed the croutons to breadcrumb texture and added the parsley, bell seasoning, garlic and Parmesan.  It came out fantastic.  I was not in the mood to eat but I could not pass on these.

I thought this was just ok. I doubled the recipe, and I found the amount of broth to be a bit much. Plus, the veal wasn't super tender, so maybe I should have cooked it longer. All in all, this recipe was just ok.

I read the others and tweaked my prep.  I did use garlic as well as onion; I added dried basil, oregano, and parsley to the unseasoned panko bread crumbs and parmesan cheese mix;  I did it all in one pan from stovetop to oven - a small non-stick Le Creuset skillet.  I used butter and xvoo to brown the chops first, plated them and then put the onions and garlic in, adding 1/4 cup white wine (not broth).  I put the chops back on top and top the entire pan with the bread crumb mixture.  After 20 minutes I added a little bit more water -- maybe another 1/4 cup.  I'm thinking I could have shorten the oven time by 5 minutes since the Le Creuset already was hot.  AND I give and cooked food 5 or 10 minutes of "rest" time.  I completely forgot to add salt and pepper!  It was find without them.  But that is just my cooking habit -- sodium is important but we use too much of it.

I was very disappointed with this recipe.  I made no changes and found the bread crumb topping too dry.  Maybe it should have coated the whole chop. I think it needed more spices.  After reading all positive reviews, I am surprised I nad this result.

This was just ok.  The veal did come out very tender but it was just SO salty and I followed the recipe exactly.  Maybe it was my bread crumbs... Anyway, I probably won't be making it again.  I'm going back to my old trusty recipe.  Sorry Betty.

The reciepe as is is perfect for a quick meal, can't ask for better. The veal flavor dominates the dish, and that is what it is about, the veal!

I have made some changes for company to make it a little differently.

I took advice from one reviewer to use one oven proof pan to do it all.

For the crumbs, I used Panko breadcrumbs with the butter and added dried sage, rosemary and thyme. 

Instead of the broth, I used 1/4C+ Noilly Prat Vermouth and 1/3 tablespoon Glace de Viande Gold Brown Stock from "More than Gourmet". It may sound fancy (it is REALLY good) but if you get it in the one pound size, it is no more expensive than stock from the supermarket. It is beef and veal stock reduced.

I seared the chops with a little oil, removed them from pan,  then off heat I added the onions few cloves chopped garlic  in the pan, returned the chops, poured over the sauce added the bread crumbs and herbs,  and finished in the oven until internal temp was between 140 and 155.

Awesome!!

This recipe was fantastic. It was moist and flavorful.  My fiance and I were sorry that it was all gone.  I was looking for a good way to cook a veal rib shank that I had.  I did add a little more chicken broth, because I was so scared it would get dry (yes I know someone said there may be too much broth).  I was wrong.  Next time I make this I will stay with the correct amount of broth.  However, for my own preference, I'll use a litle less bread crumbs.  I think this recipe will be great with lamb too.  Thanks.  Ellen

YUMMY!!! This recipe is so.o.o.o good and easy to prepare. I'm passing it on to my daughter, even though she doesn't eat veal. It will be equally as good with pork chops.

I never cooked veal chops before so I'm glad I found this recipe. It was delicious! I did add some shallots and white wine to the pan. I also followed someone's suggestion and used an oven proof skillet. Why use an extra dish when you don't have to? I did use almond meal instead of bread crumbs since I'm trying to keep gluten free. I will make again!

I made this dish but I amped up the flavor by following comments from the most helpful reviews to this recipe and it turned out to be a 5 STAR meal.  We had it with the 'Pasta Basico' also found on this site recommended by chef NAPLES. This dish could easy pass for a dish at a gourmet restaurant. You will not be disappointed.

This recipe surprised me. Not only is it a very delicious, quick meal, but my husband who normally swallows his food whole actually took the time to chew and savor it! I used a shoulder round bone cut, browned just slightly and baked exactly 30 minutes, since we like our meat a little on the rare side. It came out perfect. This is a keeper.

I found veal chops on sale out of the blue and cooked this dish for our 18th anniversary.  It is awesome, and it is so easy.

This was a very easy recipe to follow and was quite good. I didnt have bread crumbs so I substituted french dried onions and it was awesome. Very tender and great taste.

Just ok. Followed recipe exactly except did add diced garlic with the onion in the dish. Veal did come out tender but the bread crumb crust wasn't that flavorful. Needed more spices or something. Family wished we had just simply grilled the chops and enjoyed them that way.

Very tasty. I liked the bread crumb topping a lot. The chops were tender and this was very easy to make. I will make again!
