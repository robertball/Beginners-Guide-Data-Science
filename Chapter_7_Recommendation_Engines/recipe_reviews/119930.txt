My kids called it Superkraut!! Very much milder in flavor than plain sauerkraut, and a lot creamier.  Made a fantastic and tasty topper for brats too! Cooked it just the same as the chops and called it lunch.

I wished I had sampled the flavor before adding the sour cream, and may have made adjustments.  This recipe was a bit strong of caraway - I'd reduce the amount slightly,and use less sour cream, but it was a tasty meal with a nice sharp flavor for a change.

I made this recipe for dinner tonight for the 1st time. I have to say I didn't add caraway seeds or paprika becuause I didn't have any. I used very thin porkchops with all the fat trimmed away cut into strips. I seasoned them with a bit of salt and pepper and browned it in olive oil and then added a heaping teaspoon of minced garlic and a small chopped onion. I let everything mingle together and get transluscent then I added about 1/2 a 14 oz can of sauerkraut. and let it cook then I added about 3/4 cup fat free sour cream and about a cup of beef broth because that's what I had on hand. I didn't add any flour to the sauce because it didn't need it.  I boiled some pierogies on the side and added it to the finsihed product and that helped thicken up the sauce a bit. It was by far one of the tastiest dishes I have made in a long time and I am not even a big sauerkraut fan and neither is my husband and we love this. Give it a try and it will become a family favorite.

Looks like the dog's breakfast but the taste is great!!  I used 5 pork chops and the full 1/2 teaspoon of caraway and would have liked more of the caraway taste.

I think I would rather cook the pork chops with the saurkraut and serve it that way-with no sour cream. It just didn't work for me.

very good! used bagged kraut and no chicken broth, only juices from the bag.  Husband loved it.  Also, used boneless pork chops.

Loved it!  I can't eat sauerkraut without caraway seeds anyway so that was a must, but what I especially liked was how the sour cream and flour took the edge off the kraut without masking the flavor.

This turned out delicious. I was out of caraway seeds [which i know would've made it stellar] but followed the recipe pretty closely, except that i drained half of the liquid before adding half of the flour and half the sour cream. I think if i would've used the correct amounts it may have ended up a bit too soupy...though i'm sure it still would've tasted great. Nice recipe...will make it again!

I loved this recipe.  I didn't add caraway seeds because I did not have any, and I didn't add any flour (it didn't seem to need any).  It was absolutely delicious and I will make it again.

Myra, your a genius! This recipe tastes of Germany, when I was a little girl. Will make again, and again. So easy to prepare, and so very flavorful. Even son who does not care for sour kraut ate the chops! Thank you, Thank you!

My eight year old boy asked for seconds...and he hated sour cream and sauerkraut...he's a big fan of it now. I used smoked paprika and smokehouse pepper.  Caraway seeds are a key ingredient.

My husband and I loved this one. I thought my mom would, too, because she loves kraut, but she hated it and so did the kids. lol. This one definitely isn't for everyone.
