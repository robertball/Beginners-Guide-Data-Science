This recipe is great.  We are actually on GAPS (very similar to Paleo; we use lots of Paleo recipes and make small changes when needed).  The medical practitioner we see wants both my daughter and me eating beef every single day.  So I'm constantly on the lookout for new, and (relatively) easy things to do with beef, especially since my 8 year old daughter can be picky with ground beef, as it is one of her least favorite meats.  This recipe was a hit.  I used ground beef instead of turkey sausage, had to look up a recipe to make pizza sauce (found a good Paleo pizza sauce recipe that worked).  I also doubled everything in the recipe.  My husband eats organic but is not on GAPS (or PALEO, but will eat whatever I make, and ground beef IS his favorite).  Doubling the recipe filled a 13x15 baking dish to the top.  We wound up eating 1/2 the dish for lunch!  My husband just could not stop eating this, my daughter ate a hefty slice, and as for me I ate a "reasonable portion" and then just kept slicing a thin line down the baking dish taking "a little" bit more, and before we knew it, 1/2 the dish was gone.  The other modification I made was adding 16 oz of mushrooms (and could have added more).  We all thought it was very similar tasting to lasagna.  For those people who do  (or can) eat dairy, some cheese would have been amazing on this as well.  Would definitely make this to serve to others as well.  Just add a tossed salad and you've got a complete meal.  It's delicious.

I had gone paleo about 10 years ago when there were very few recipes beyond mixing vegetables together as a side dish to your meats. So when I returned to the diet again with my boyfriend we saw this recipe and were so excited to try it. We enjoyed it VERY much! We used minced garlic and sauteed them with the onions (instead of garlic powder). We used a larger medium sized squash and I think it was more than the dish called for because after adding the eggs they seemed to be absorbed which meant it wasn't as bubbly and moist as I imagined it should be. I'd like it if there was a measurement suggestion for the amount of cooked squash but in no way was it ruined. We even had leftovers which I found helps keep me on track for when you're looking for a quick lunch or dinner the next day.
The flavor of the whole dish reminded me of sweet italian sausage, yum!
I agree with AO's comment about draining the turkey slightly. It wasn't noted so my boyfriend (who was in charge of cooking the turkey) forgot to do so and realized it when it was too late. My only other adjustment was to spoon pizza sauce over the finished slices. Definately looking forward to making it again real soon!

This is a really flavorful alternative to your standard spaghetti. If you're not actually following a paleo diet, 4 oz or so of fresh Parmesan cheese sprinkled on top before baking really adds a nice flavor to it.  I use fresh basil and about 2 cups of baby spinach.  We also usually only have regular ground turkey on hand so I just add oregano and some crushed red pepper to it instead of buying sausage.  The only other change I make is to cook the red pepper with the turkey and onion while it's in the skillet, rather than adding it later.

My daughter went Paleo before I did and I could not believe how yummy this is. She uses ground beef that is grass fed instead of the turkey. More expensive...but very lean. This will not have any leftovers.

Great recipe. I actually had a large enough spaghetti squash to make two large dishes of it. I also added garlic when saut√©ing the onions and turkey, and put extra sauce over the entire dish before baking. Also (and I know it isn't "Paleo"), I added a small bit of parmesean and shredded Monterey Jack before baking the dish. It turned out PERFECT!

Paleo Spaghetti Pie: "LOVE spaghetti squash. Enjoyed eating it this way. But too watery." My daughter saw the video for making this on Roku's AR channel and insisted we make it, probably b/c it was called "pie." Whenever I make spaghetti squash, it's usually just baked, then topped w/ whatever spaghetti sauce/meatballs I have around, so this was a fun, different way to do it; just didn't like that it was so watery at the bottom when it was time to serve, and didn't quite come out in nice "slices", but appearances aside, it tasted awesome!

This is a GREAT recipe!!!  I added a jalepeno and instead of turkey sausage, I used elk sausage.  My husband, who is a meat and potato guy even liked it!

Was great! Used "hot" turkey sausage and it was great. Next time would drain the sausage a little better, wasn't noted to, so only drained slightly just in case moisture needed, but wasn't.

Super yum! My husband was a huge skeptic at first. "Spaghetti squash, applesauce, and egg?! Babe that is going to taste like dog food."
I made him admit that he officially loves to eat dog food! He loved this recipe! We have to eat dairy free due to a dairy intolerant breast fed baby! This recipe really is super yum! We will for sure be eating this more often!

I needed to use up a spaghetti squash and came across this recipe.  Looked easy and I happened to have most things on hand so I gave it a whirl.  I only had about 3 servings of the pre-cooked turkey sausage crumbles to use which turned out perfect- cut down the time and calories a bit.  I had to use spaghetti sauce instead of pizza sauce as that is what I had.  My squash was fairly small- just 19 oz of actual 'noodles' after cooked.  This was so easy and quick and delicious!  I will definitely be making this again.  I added up all calories/fat/protein etc with the changes that I made.  Using this as a recipe for 4 servings it ended up being just 229 calories/serving with 16 grams of protein!  That's a winner!!

The family enjoyed this and asked me to make it again.  Made as written except omitted the applesauce.  Added additional pizza sauce instead.

Outstanding! I too only used half a large squash and used ground turkey but not sausage. Added sauteed mushrooms and a bit more sauce.The results were awesome. My wife, 9 year old and I ate almost all of a 9x13 pan. The leftovers made a great breakfast too! Thank you!

This was shockingly good and it freezes really well. I will make this again for sure. I used the exact ingredients they recommended and it came out perfect.

Awesome! I feed 2 families at once and have a "Foodie" family while my friends family is a "don't like anything weird family", this one was a great success. Even reheated the next day for lunch! Highly recommend! 
(Would suggest roasting the squash earlier in the day or the day before even to save time, I burnt the heck out of my fingers because I was in a time crunch!!!)

Really excellent, i first tried to mix it all together in too small of a pot - next time.

I'm not sure what it meant on the eggs - I mixed everything together including the eggs, poured it onto a baking dish and let her rip.

I made this recipe tonight for my family. Two members are on gluten-free diet and one is on dairy-free. I omitted the onions since the kids won't eat them, and substituted the applesauce with canned white beans which I mashed. They absolutely loved it! I will definitely be making it again, and experimenting with different ingredients. Also, I did drain the sausage after cooking, so the whole thing set up nice and firm.

WOW! What a great recipe! I made it using chicken sausage instead of turkey and I used spaghetti sauce instead of pizza sauce.  It tasted wonderful.  It made me feel like I was eating lasagna.  My boyfriend loved it and said it was one of the best dinners he's had.  My two boys (ages 11 and 9) didn't exactly fall in love with it like we did.  However, they did eventually finish their plate.  They tend to dislike dinners I make that look different (food all mixed together) than what they are used to seeing (meat, potatoes, vegetable in their proper places on the plate).  I'm sure they will love it after I make it a couple more times.

I made it as written the first time and really liked it but a large squash is a relative term and it was too much for an 8 inch pan so I made 2. This time I made modifications. I mixed the squash, sauce, meat, seasonings (I leave out the applesauce), spinach and eggs. Poured them in 13 x 9 pan. Baked for 40 minutes. Top with vegan cheese, green pepper, red onion, mushroom and turkey pepperoni. Baked for 20 minutes more. Take out of the oven let sit 10 minute, cut and serve!! I will use 4 eggs next time.

DELICIOUS!! I am already looking forward to making this again. I think non-paleo family will enjoy this too. I had to substitute a few ingredients for what I had on hand... ground turkey instead of turkey sausage and I needed to use up a small container of rosemary lemongrass bone broth so I cooked it with the meat to add flavor. I also did not have red pepper. I'm going to try as stated next time. I'm sure it will be delish!

Delicious Gluten and Paleo dinner. The dish looked cooked all the way through with 10 mins to go. We left it in anyway and it was cooked just right.

Delicious!  Me and my 9 year old son loved it!  My more picky 12 year old, not so much.  It has a slight sweet taste (maybe due to the applesauce), which is really tasty.  I did add fresh chopped garlic with the onions.  I added garlic salt and garlic pepper to the meat while cooking, and to the spaghetti squash after scraping it out of the shell.  I was afraid it would be runny, but it came out perfect!  I also used a 9x13 pan, as this recipe was too much for my 8x8 (which is good - more to eat!).  It did take about an hour of prep time, then an hour of bake time, but well worth it!

This came out spectacularly delicious. I used more spices than called for (veggie spice blend, etc), more salt than called for, and used ground beef, because that's what I had. Other than that, this recipe came out SO good that it's now become a staple instantly.

I made and served this to my husband, my daughter and her 3 children.  My daughter insisted the kids were not going to eat it and when she saw me put the eggs in she was grossed out and said she could not eat it!!!  Well all 3 kids ate it and the 14 year old actually had 2 servings.  My daughter decided to try it and was very pleasantly surprised at the wonderful flavor!!  The only things I did different was to put about 1/2 teaspoon ground fennel in the sauce and grated Asiago cheese on top when I served it to give it the good flavor that I wanted.  Excellent!  I will definitely make this again.  Thank you for putting this healthy recipe in allrecipes for us to use.

I made it exactly to recipe and it came out  a congealed, bland mess. I like all of the ingredients separately, but somehow put together, not so much. 

I should add that although we eat healthy food routinely, we don't usually eat paleo and I was trying something new. Maybe you have to get used to this type of food to appreciate it? I've had vegan stuff that the vegan people raved about that was absolutely revolting, so maybe this is the same sort of situation. I don't know. 

Overall I would say this may not be a good choice for experimentation if you don't eat paleo. I tried a few other paleo recipes this week and they were much better.

I used fresh garlic instead of powder and ground turkey instead of sausage.

Healty and tasty! I cooked the spaghetti squash in my slow cooker (pierce the squash about 8 times then add 1/2c. water and cook on low for 3.5 hours). Then followed the recipe from there. As per another review I also added jalapenos and I am so glad I did. It gave the dish a nice bite. My husband even loved this and he was super skeptical. Will add parmesan next time. A keeper!

Don't let the nasty photo fool you, this is delicious! 

This turned out awesome. We are a family of 4, all picky eaters . Everyone LOVED this and came back for seconds. The only thing I didn't like was that this was very time consuming and labor intensive. Thankfully it made a huge batch (it filled my 9x13 baking dish) so we will have leftovers for lunch and dinner. I'm lazy and if I have to spend over an hour preparing a meal I won't make it again. However, since it yielded such a large quantity I will make again in the future.

This is delicious!!  Had read others reviews so I did stray a little from the original recipe; saut√©ed garlic with the onion before browning fresh pork sausage.  We‚Äôre on the eat everything diet....  Used kale in place of spinach.    Extra diced red pepper and then sprinkled shredded pizza cheese on top at the end.  Placed under broiler to melt the cheese.

This recipe was great!  The only thing I suggest for change is adding an extra 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 6 cloves minced garlic and 1/2 shallot.

Delicious plan to make for my parents as they are 90 and can't have too much salt or fat. I too used fresh garlic with the onions and turkey sausage. Our store only had the breakfast links but the meat came right out of the casing. I used yellow, red and green peppers for color. One squash filled a 9x9 pan, should have measured the squash! I would add more spinach as it's a nice contrast and it shrinks up. We are trying to reduce sodium and I found a jar of Marinara sauce from Trader Joe's that was no salt added, 1/2 cup had only 35 mg!!! I added some of xtra oregano and basil and about 1/2 t - 1 t of cinnamon. It is addicting as one of the previous reviews mentioned she kept taking another thin slice to "even it out."

I have never made anything with Spaghetti squash before.  First of all, it was very hard to cut it in half, then it took almost 1 hour in the oven to shred.  I would recommend using more pizza sauce, it was a little dry.  Over all I did like it, my two children not so much.  It was a very healthy dish and a great change from the usual dinners.

Delicious! I am on the SCD diet, not Paleo, so I added a topping of grated Parmesan cheese and used sugar free pasta sauce and sausage. Thanks for a delicious addition to my recipes  I can eat and serve to guests not on my diet.

I tweaked this after reading the "too watery" reviews. I sauteed the spinach and bell pepper with the sausage, then lifted all out with slotted spoon. I also omitted the applesauce. The pie wasn't watery at all, and did stick together. It was pretty good. Cheese on top makes it extra yummy.

I'm not paleo, but had squash and wanted to make a "spaghetti-like" dish. The taste was fine, but I wasn't happy with the consistency. It didn't stick together and I found that, through the baking process, it became quite watery. I did, however, use only two eggs (that's all I had), so I subbed a 1/4c of apple sauce. I'd be game to try this again IF I knew for sure the third egg would make all the difference, but I really don't want to be disappointed again. I topped it with grated parm and cheddar... which was the only part that did stick!

Amazingly yummy.  My and my boyfriend can't get enough!  I didn't have pizza sauce, so I used a can of diced tomatoes, small can of tomato sauce and a 1/2 can of tomato paste to substitute it for it.  Real garlic instead of powder.  SOOO GOOD, even better the next day!  Making it again today.

I made this not expecting much as it is my first Paleo recipe I have ever made. I loved it! Mine didn't look as pretty as the one in the picture but it tasted great. I wonder if you can freeze this after you cook it. Anyone know?

Only change I made was chopped fresh garlic instead of powder.  This recipe is fantastic!  The gluten-free Husband wasn't a big fan "tastes like vegetables".  There's no fooling him on the spaghetti squash being anything but a veggie.  I've never made a spaghetti squash before so I wish I'd watched the video first.  The written recipe didn't say to seed it first.  I seeded it after cooking (I watched the video while it was in the oven) but it still came out fine.  When it was done I did sprinkle some shredded cheddar on top.  The next day's leftovers had no cheddar, but I sprinkled on some chopped jalapenos (which made it AWESOME!)  I would recommend adding the peppers for some crunch and bite!

We actually enjoyed this. It fit well within our Whole30 eating style . I  followed the recipe as indicated for most of the  ingredients but kept the Squash, egg & spinach as the crust base and topped with the remaining ingredients. I did use a whole jar of  Whole30 compliant spaghetti sauce and beef instead of sausage.   It gave us another great option to use spaghetti squash to replace the pasta we used to eat lol. For those suggesting the addition of cheese etc. make up your own cheesy spaghetti  pie, don't try to make this one unhealthy.

I had to make a few changes based on what I had on hand: used ground beef, and 1/4 c egg whites.  Also added a little more of the spices and some low sodium salt.  My spaghetti squash must have been too large, because we ended up having to add more tomato sauce after it was finished baking because it was a bit on the dry side.  However, it turned out delicious.  We all loved it!  My 8 year old daughter, who is gluten sensitive and somewhat picky, had no idea it was spaghetti squash, though it was real noodles.  She even asked for it for lunch the next day.  Based on my changes, this is a 5-star keeper, and I will for sure make it again.

Tasty and well received by guests.  Good alternative to egg bake breakfast dishes which generally are made with bread.  Followed directions exactly, but next time want to try without apple sauce.

Love this dish! Made it exactly as directed the first time, but every time thereafter the change I made was increasing the amount of spinach (only as a way to use up the bag so it doesn't go bad if I'm not using it for anything else. Still works, doesn't overwhelm the dish at all)

I changed this recipe a lot. Used the spaghetti squash, already roasted, mixed it with 1 egg and ¬Ω cup of Parmesan cheese. Patted that into a 9" pie plate. ( the squash I used was small, next time might need a 10" pie plate). Sprinkled Penzeys pizza seasoning on top, added 1 cup of drained dairy free cottage cheese. On top of that, I added 1 cup of Prego sauce that was simmered with onions, mushrooms, sweet peppers that I saut√©ed first. On top of that, spread 1 cup fresh spinach. Then topped off with mozzarella cheese. Bake at 350 for 35 min. So very good, just like regular spaghetti pie!!

Made this for dinner the other night. My husband who is picky thought it was good and we have plenty for leftovers. I used fresh oregano and basil and it was very tasty. I will be making this again.

Delish. Used what I had which was hot italian sausage and ragu marinara sauce. Kept the rest the same. Easy,fresh  and spicy. (Could have used shredded cheese in there too. Might top it with  that next time. )

I really liked it, kids did not. It's pretty oniony. Kids may like it more without the onions. I didn't have spinach or red peppers but it was still good without. I also used low fat sausage instead of turkey bc I don't like turkey. Really good flavor though!

I had a super large squash picked from the garden in the fall that needed to be used. This recipe was really good! I used frozen garden basil, leftover seasoned hamburger from a taco meal (instead of the turkey) and some left over pizza sauce and spaghetti sauce. I am not on a paleo diet, but thought this was really good tasting and would make it again. I let the dish set up for about 15 mins before it was eaten and it was not watery at all.

I used crushed tomatoes instead of pizza sauce and chicken instead of turkey sausage. I should have added more spices and salt as it turned out bland because of the meat substitute. My husband didn't really like it but it was his first time eating spaghetti squash. I would make this again.

Loved this!  Used grass-fed beef instead of turkey, a kale/spinach/chard blend instead of just spinach, and I doubled almost everything to have a bigger casserole.  Topped with a small amount of cheese and some crushed red pepper.

WOW! I am just starting to eat my veggies, and this was excellent! I used what I had (no bell pepper, applesauce or spinach, and way less than 1lb of sausage), topped it with mozzarella before baking, and it came out delicious! 
I will definitely be making this again and looking for more ways to eat spaghetti squash! Be sure to let the squash cool before handling too!

I made this with squash from our garden so used two small ones-made perfect amount. I had some leftover tomato meat sauce and two pork chops so I sliced up pork and added as well. It turned out very well and I'll definitely be making again!

I made this today - was a bit hesitant about the apple sauce and the egg on top of everything but trusted the recipe. It turned out great!!  I added some cayenne pepper and cumin and only used 2 eggs.  I think next time I need to add a bit more of everything as I was short on spinach and I felt it needed a bit more spice. I will definitely make this again!

Great as is or toss in some add-ins to make it yours!  Some pizza or spaghetti sauce on top at serving is a great addition.

Excellent!  I did not have red bell pepper on hand, it would have added nicely to it but still great without!  I used two teaspoons fresh basil, chopped up.  This one is a keeper, so good!  Thank you so much!

My whole family enjoyed this dish!  I used ground turkey instead of turkey sausage (because my daughter is not a fan of sausage).  Also, I boiled the whole spaghetti squash in a large stockpot rather than baking it (I find it much easier to cut the squash after cooking because it has softened).  The squash released a lot of liquid during the baking process, so I carefully drained it off prior to serving. This is a great fall dish and am looking forward to making it again!

I modified the recipe to my vegetarian tastes (no turkey sausage or meat).  I also didn't have basil or oregano but I followed everything else exactly. It was wonderful! I have been searching for tasty spaghetti squash recipes and this one is a keeper!

I made this last night with ingredients I had on hand. It was fantastic! My husband doesn't like casseroles or turkey meat but was thrilled with this recipe. He had seconds and thirds! I was missing quite a few ingredients like white onion, fresh spinach, applesauce and red bell pepper. I substituted red onion, frozen spinach and added a cup of chopped fresh mushroom. The mushrooms added moisture so you really need to drain the meat mixture before adding the eggs. I absolutely love the flexibility of this recipe and cannot wait to experiment with different ingredients. The video was fabulous. Bon Apetit?

Ok, being diabetic I love Italian food, but the pasta don't love me.  Tried this recipe and without a doubt this is the greatest thing since sliced bread.  Never had a spaghetti squash before, but I now know that this is a great substitute for whole wheat noodles let alone regular wheat pasta. I did cheat and use Italian sausage for the meat... but hey, take the fat over the carbs anyday..... This is GOOD !

Excellent!  I doubled recipe except for sticking to 1 pound of Italian seasoned ground turkey and put in 8x8 dish and 9x13 dish.  Also since the ground turkey was already seasoned I did not double the oregano, basil, garlic.  I will definitely make this regularly.

Made this for dinner last night and it was fabulous!  We eat healthy, but not necessarily paleo.  My husband has been cutting way back on carbs lately though, so I thought I'd give this a shot to see if it would curb my craving for pasta.  It did the trick!  Tasted just like a yummy lasagna!  The only change I made to the recipe was using minced garlic (and a lot of it) instead of garlic powder.  But otherwise followed it exactly.  I did not drain the turkey sausage as some have suggested, and I'm glad I didn't.  I think it might have been too dry if I had.  I did put a little freshly grated parmesan on top before baking.  The only change I might make next time is to add a little more pizza sauce‚Ä¶ just a personal preference and not really necessary to make this delicious!  Will definitely be making this often!

This is no doubt a five star! Extremely tasty and easy to make. I've never baked a spaghetti squash but I will be using this recipe over and over again !

Wow, what a great recipe!  We just loved it! I increased the garlic and added red pepper flakes as per other reviews and it was just perfect.  Easy and healthy, definitely will make again!

I just made this recipe.  Smelled grand!  I realized I had too much squash after viewing the video once again.  I read the reviews & noticed that someone used HOT turkey sausage.  We ate it even had seconds, but felt it was rather bland.  It needed more sauce or something else. 
I did love the turkey and the seasonings and mine came out perfect.  I cooked the meat and onion for stated 6 minutes.  I'm still trying to come up with an answer to making this recipe "POP".

Wow. I was skeptical but given all the 5 stars, thought I'd give it a try. Used what I had on hand: lean turkey meat, mushrooms, frozen spinach (thawed and squeezed dry), no peppers, and egg substitute instead of real eggs. But even the nine year old picky eater asked for seconds. 

Not sure if I'd do the unsweetened applesauce again, I think it made it more sweet than I would generally prefer.

Over the past six years I have made spaghetti squash 6 different ways- but tonight's recipe "The Paleo Spaghetti Pie" was AWESOME!  I thought our family had grown tired of this vegetable- however this recipe had the "kick" we needed to fall in love all over again!  YUM!  Easy and inexpensive too!

This is wonderful. For someone who cannot eat pasta, it's refreshing. Only thing I did different was use green, orange AND red peppers.  Will look for something to add a bit of punch, but would eat it like this again. Thanjs for the ideas.

Growing up, spaghetti with meat sauce was a staple in my household, a literally something I could eat almost every day.  Using the right sauce and the proper amount of meat makes this match traditional spaghetti with no tradeoffs.  The only drawback is this did not age as well in the fridge.

This was so tasty and pretty easy to make.  I made it with just turkey and was wonderful.  I will try different things next time.  What is wonderful is how healthy it is and how awesome it tastes.  Thanks for sharing!
