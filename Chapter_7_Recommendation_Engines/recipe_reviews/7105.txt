My mother and I have been making this bread since I was 3, it's a Good Friday tradition.  I have found it easier though over the years to use anise extract, I think it gives it a little more flavor. Also if you're not into the dried fruit, Raisins are a great if not better substitute.

This was a good sweet recipe, great for breakfast.  However, use more dried fruit than is recomended.  This recipe was hard to knead the second time because of the dry ingredients.  Take your time with this one!

Really good recipe.  However for the advanced baker since it's a yeast bread with multiple rising periods.

Overall, very authentic-- and I'm 100% Italian!

I have never made a braided bread ring, but had wanted to try.  This was perfect!
I made it for my Bible Study class & got only raves.  It wasn't hard to prepare
or make.  It was very good to eat- too!

This is a very good recipe.  I did make some changes, however.  First of all, I used half of the salt and still had excellent results.  Also, I substituted sultanas (golden raisins) for the fruit called for in the recipe.  I also omitted the nuts.  The resulting loaf was beautiful to look at and makes an excellent Easter morning certerpiece.

I do question the safety of letting the braided loaf rise for the second hour because of the raw eggs.  Only let mine rise 30 minutes after the inserting the colored raw eggs.  Everything turned out great.  The bread is very lightly sweet and goes very well with coffee.

Followed recipe as written--love it!  I use kosher salt, and didn't notice a salty taste.  Everybody raved about this last Easter.  It tastes sweet--more like a cake bread.  Excellent!

There is too much salt!  The other recipes I have call for just a pinch of salt. I would use 1/2 or 1/4 teaspoon instead of 1 teaspoon.  I couldn't taste the sweetness in the dough for the saltiness.
Otherwise, it is a very good recipe.

Bread was very easy to make, although I had to add more flour because the dough was way too sticky and the cooking time was only 25 minutes.  Other thatn that I handed out the printed recipe to the girls at work along with a miniature braided wreath with one egg in the center.  Everyone was very impressed.  This one's a keeper.

This was my first attempt at an Easter ring & I was thrilled with the result!  I brought this to an Easter dinner & everyone raved about how good it was.  The kids loved dyeing the eggs.  I'm going to make this a new Easter tradition.

I'm excited to try this again next Easter.  My bread turned out a little dry and the icing was too watery, but I think I just need to practice.  Making the dough and twisting it into a ring was pretty easy, and inserting the eggs in the ring also went well.  My dad was very impressed, since his family always bought their Easter Bread.

This turned out great! It is a bit of work, but well worth it. This was my first time making a bread ring and it looked absolutely gorgeous. I could not find candied fruit anywhere, so I used a mix of candied pineapple, candied cherries and raisins. It worked out really well, and it was delicious. I will make this every Easter from now on. Thanks for the recipe(:

I'll give this three b/c it did turn out as a bread.  However, I can't give it more than that b/c I didn't follow the recipe.  I didn't add the dried fruit or anise seed or colored eggs; instead I added anise extract and it still wasn't enough for my tastes.  I was hoping this would be like my Sicilian grandma's Pigna but it didn't come close.  If you're not Italian and not used to authentic Pigna then this may satisfy your needs but it just didn't do it for me.  I crumbled it up and gave it to the birds.

bread was good, however, I left out the dried fruit, anise and almonds, since it's not a ruitcake.  And, it did not double in size at all and I followed directions step by step.  But everyone loved it.

I actually came to All Recipes today looking for this recipe. An old friend used to make this for us when my kids were small and I haven't had it in years. After trying this, it's exactly what I was looking for! I did use less salt ( I usually do no matter the recipe). I had golden raisins and dates and sliced almonds on hand so I used those instead running to the store for the candied fruit. It turned out wonderful. I did have anise seed and I used it, and I was pleased with the taste. For me this flavoring is what makes it stand out from the rest. I did cheat and used my Kitchen Aid mixer instead of doing the work by hand. I started with the batter paddle and then switched to the dough hook for the ten minute knead. Do be careful about not adding too much flour as I feel that this is just on the border of being too dry. If you add a touch too much flour I suspect it will make a difference. Even so I was very pleased with the consistency and the taste, oh and the look of it too. I'd have taken a picture but we started tasting it and had trouble stopping so there is isn't much left, it was supposed to be for Easter. Oh well.

I made this yesterday for Easter and it was a hit.  I used tha amount of salt that was called for in the recipe and we were not able to taste the salt as others said they were able.  I was not able to find any dried fruit that said it was candied so I used a dried tropical fruit mix.  The only other thing I did not use was the anise seed.  I could only find anise extract and that is so strong that I didn't want to try and substitute so I left it out.  Even with all these changes it was very good.  The bread itself was not sweet (due to no candied fruit?) but the icing was plenty sweet.  A+++

I made this for Easter and it was a big hit!  I made a couple changes after reading other reviews - omitted candied fruit (family doesn't like it) and substituted raisins and used Anise extract instead of the seed.  I also needed to add a few more TBS of milk to make the right consistency glaze.  I baked with white eggs to prevent dye transfer onto the bread, and then when the bread was done I removed the white eggs and replaced them with dyed because it really makes this bread POP!  I will definitely make again.

I have been making this bread for many years.  However I do not add the candied fruit or nuts but anise flavoring instead of seed.  I have found that the egg coloring tends to bleed into the dough while cooking, so the past two years I have left them white.  Delicious though!

Very very good! I skipped the candies fruit and mixed extra almonds and vanilla but it was very good and first time making Easter egg bread ever! The waiting and rest times are tedious but worth it!
