This makes an excellent, sweet, guilt free dessert. I used nonfat cottage cheese and nonfat milk. It's also good without the crust. Just bake it in custard cups.

Yummm! I LOVE this. This pie is a big family tradition. We make for Easter breakfast, and other special occasions. The only modification I would make is to use slightly less sugar than called for. For reviewers that are wondering when it's going to set up, we always let it cool on the counter and then refridgerate it overnight... it sets up quite a bit while cooling.  Thanks for putting this reciepe on here!

I did not care for this recipe. For one thing it was way too sweet for me. Another is the texture, which I found unappealing.Thirdly is the amount of time it took to bake, I had to bake it an extra 20 minutes and it still wasn't set. I followed the recipe to a "T".

I followed the recipe exactly and found it pretty unexciting...it hinted at lemon flavor - could have used lots more lemon for my taste. The texture was fine and I had been curious about  uses for cottage cheese so this fit the bill, but I probably won't make it again. Sorry...
