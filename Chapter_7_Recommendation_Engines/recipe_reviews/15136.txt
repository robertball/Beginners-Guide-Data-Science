This was some good stuff. Of course, I can never follow a recipe to the "T". I always tweak something in it. I cooked the rice in the poaching liquid from the chicken, I threw in some shredded cheddar along with the veveeta, tossed in some frozen peas and carrots and topped in all off with some french fried onions instead of the cracker crumbs. My kids went nuts over it and my husband got up in the morning and ate it for breakfast. He said it was even better reheated. Thanx for a great recipe...this one is a keeper.

This was very good, and a very creamy delightful switch from the usual run of the mill "Chicken & Rice" recipes.
But I have got to say after making it a few times I tried a more gourmet tasting flair to it and it worked beautifully.  What I used was 1/2 gruyere cheese and 1/2 good cheddar.
Then I diced 4 large chicken breast halves into small bite size pieces and placed  approx. 3 cups of large sliced fresh mushooms in a bowl and sprinkled 1/3 cup of white wine on top and tossed the mushrooms and chicken to absorb the wine and let sit while I prepared the cheese sauce.
I also prepared the rice using the water I had boiled the breasts in and strained it and added some chicken base.
I would definitly serve this for company done this way and recommend having fun using the basics of this recipe to your own tastes. It is a keeper!!!

This recipe was not a very big hit with the family. I tried it again without the Velveeta and used cheddar, also did it with uncooked rice and baked longer. this seemed to have added more flavor to the rice. My famiily liked this version more.

Good but I also added broccoli, celery and onion to the chicken mixture.  In addition I took out the chicken bullion and used garlic and onion powder with the seasoning salt.  For the topping I halved the cracker crumbs and added about 1/2 cup of shredded cheese to them for the topping. I also took out the butter which was not needed once the cheese was added, I used sharp chedder instead of the velveta.  I think the combo of velveta, bullion and seasoning salt would add way to much salt to this dish. With the changes I belive it is a 5 star recipe, but a 4 as written

Great first out of the oven, when re-heated I felt it was too dry, maybe the rice soaks up the extra liquid.  Next time will add more sour cream or something to make it have a little more liquid.

A classic, home-cooked, comfort food dinner! I didn't add the cooked chicken to the sauce (so that I could stir it better/smoother) but just mixed it in ahead with the rice (Step one or two).  Also, I took another's advice about adding veggies: I added some cooked chopped broccoli & cooked chopped carrots. Overall - an easy dinner that we all thought was terriffic! Thanks!

I always read the reviews before trying a new recipe and use the suggestions that sound good.  I tried the gruyere cheese Cheryl B suggested, what a delicious cheese! I saut√©ed onions and celery with chicken tenders, then added the rest of the ingredients.  I also skipped the bouillon and used a carton of chicken broth, using 2 cups in the rice and substituting the other 2 cups for the milk.  This casserole came out delicious!

Really, very good taste!  Nice and creamy!  It is missing something though, lacks color. I don't think I'd add anything in the recipe per se, but having peas and carrots on the side to mix in would be awesome.  I would also put more of a crust on it--another cup or so of crackers should be fine since my topping seemed a little wet anyway. Overall, really good though.  Now that I know the taste, I can figure out what veggies to make on the side(see above) and make it a comlete meal. ENJOY!

Tasty, tasty!  Used Durkee's fried onions instead of crackers.  Cooked rice in chicken broth. Added cooked mixed vegetables. Chopped cooked chicken rather than shredded it.  Mixed shredded colby jack and cheddar cheeses in with the cheese sauce.  Only had about one cup of sour cream and it still worked out well.  My son doesn't eat meat, so made a portion for him without meat in one tray. A guest doesn't eat onions, so put the crunchy onion topping only on part of it.  Easy to adapt for nearly all picky eaters at the same table! Will definitely make again! Thanks!

Great comfort food! My family loved it-even the picky little ones. Thinking about adding green peas next time for flavor and color.

This is an excellent recipe. I made it for my family and they loved it, even my picky 2 year old. Also I took this to a pot luck and everyone raved over it. I had to pass the recipe on.

Simply delish.  One of the best comfort foods I've had yet. I made minor changes to suit my family's likes and availability of ingredients.  I have made this a few different ways and broccoli is a great addition.  Thank you to the chef for this crowd-pleaser and base recipe.

It was nice to find a recipe like this that didn't use a canned cream of something soup.  I used french fried onions (from the can) instead of the crushed crackers.  I didn't use a full 12 ounces of Velveeta.  This is great comfort food.

I did not care for this recipe.  I couldn't taste aything other than velveeta.  I think if I halved the velveeta and used cheddar cheese with some onions/veggies it would help.  Sorry this wasn't for me.

I used jasmine rice from a rice steamer and I thought it had really good flavor. I would make this again and again. I did add a little more seasoning to the sauce,but very good!

This was pretty good and will probably make again. I used half cheddar and half velveeta. It wasnt my favorite but good for something different.

I made this recipe exactly as written...thus giving it a 3.  If you're a BIG fan of Velveta, you'll likely love it.  We aren't velveta fans and therefore didn't care for the velveta taste.  I may try this again sometime using cheddar cheese...it was good other than the velveta.

Easy way to clean out the fridge.  I didn't have velveeta so I topped the dish with shredded sharp cheddar and then the crushed crackers.  Kids didn't love it but they all found something to pick out and eat; rice, crackers, cheese, or chicken.

This was the BEST chicken and rice casserole I have ever eaten.  I have tried all kinds from artichoke to poppyseed and everything in between.  I steamed the rice in a steamer with vegetable broth and that added a nice boost of flavor.  I also poached the chicken in vegetable broth.  In a pinch you could easily use a pre-cooked rotisserie!  Thank you for a great recipe!!!

I was looking for a new one dish chicken meal because I was tired of everything I usually do with chicken and I am so glad I tried this one. I did not have any garlic powder so I used 1/2 teaspoon of minced garlic instead. I also used yellow (saffron) rice because I did not have enough white rice. I was so thrilled with the results and was surprised at how you could taste all of the individual ingredients so well. I made about half again the amount of topping listed and I loved the result. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

Not a low fat recipe but really wows a crowd!
I recommend adding cooked mixed vegetables to the rice for a all in one dish meal!

This is a huge hit in my house, it is my son's favorite casserole. I boil and cook the chicken & rice in chicken broth. I also use cheddar cheese instead of Velveeta and it works perfectly.

I made this because we had almost nothing to make in the house, right before shopping day... It was so easy and turned out absolutely delicious. very flavorful and certainly not dry like i thought it would be... The only changes I made to it was instead of bouillon I used the seasoning packet from a chicken flavored Ramen, and I used canned shredded chicken. Still, it was great and will definately be making this one again...

Too much sour cream for us, I don't plan to make this again unless I really scale down the sour cream. It was thick and rich. My 2 and 3 year olds really liked it but the other 5 of us did not enjoy it as much. We used only cheddar.

This was a very good meal.   When I served it I had all kinds of suggestions like wouldn't this be great with tuna or just as a side dish.   So this recipe will stay in my box to use again.  I am a die hard velveeta fan so I would personally add a little more although taste wise it didn't need more.  This was simple and easy.  A great dish for potlucks!

This was a pretty good recipe, I added fresh broccoli which I boiled, adding only 2 tablespoons of butter or margerine and some salt. I also did 16oz of velveeta cheese. I also subed pilsbury cresent dough for the cracker topping (one can covered the top of my cassarole dish) unroll over the top of cassarole before baking it. I let it cook uncovered until the cresant topping was lightly browned then covered it until heated throughout. I would suggest adding more salt and pepper, but I like my food a little salty. My husband loved it!

All the kids loved it & husband too! I poached the chicken, tossed a little poultry seasoning and garlic powder in with it. Cooked the rice in the chicken water. Added a little time, but worth the effort, produced a great flavor. Everything else was as per recipe, except I had a 1/2 can of French's French Fried Onions kicking around from Thanksgiving, so I dumped it on top too. Super yummy!

I am so excited to find this recipe.  I like it even more since it is condensed soup free.  I think it tastes better.

This recipe was okay. Just okay. It definitely needed the addition of some broccoli or peas to cut the taste of velveeta. Beyond that, it was very work-intensive for a pretty average-tasting meal. If I make this again, which I likely won't, I will increase the rice to six or seven cups and will add a vegetable. But like I said, I probably won't put the work into it again.

this was quite good. i liked that it uses more of a homemade sauce instead of canned soups.  i didn't have quite enough chicken but it was still ok. i added about a cup of green peas mixed in. and i mixed it all together before baking rather than pouring the sauce over top - i was too scared the rice would be dry.  it came out great though, not dry at all.  i also didn't toss the crackers with butter, i don't see the need, they still browned up and were nice and crunchy without the added fat.  thank you!

First off, this was another good recipe as a base to add your own flair too.  My alterations included using diced chicken breast, marinated heavily and pre-cooked.  I had shreaded cheese instead of processed (Kraft Mexican 4 cheese).  When I mixed everything but the meat/rice together I didn't think it had enough flavor at all.  So I tried my (never used) Emeril's Original Essense - about 3 tbsps - and instead of layering I mixed everything up with a bag of pre-cooked brocolli.  Wow - I had no need to be worried!  My son and BF both thought it was excellent - the leftovers disappeared the next day.  Thanks again - this site is making me look like I know how to cook!

I made this for my daughter's "family birthday party" and everybody loved it.  I doubled the recipe, using 12 oz. of Velveeta and 8 oz. of shredded cheddar, 16 oz. of sour cream and a big bag of frozen chopped broccoli.  I loved the flavor and the crunchy topping but I wish it would have been a little more creamy.  Maybe the broccoli caused it to be a little more dry?

Yum!  This is a very filling delicious casserole.  I used lite sour cream and skim milk and it was still very rich and creamy.  It was even better as leftovers, which is very unusual!  I think it needs a chopped onion next time.

This is great!  Lots of flavor and makes plenty for a family of four.  Made green beans on the side.  Would be good with a fresh loaf of crusty bread.  Will make again for sure.  Thank you so much!

This is a hit every time I make it..I even have my grown children's friends call and ask if I can make it for them....and the only thing I do different is cook the rice in the chicken broth and mix it all together before I bake it..GREAT pot luck dish too!!

Really liked this! I'm always looking for casserole dishes that don't call for "Cream of Whatever" soup. :) Only thing I added was a layer of frozen veggies on top of the layer of rice before I added the chicken mixture.

I really liked this recipe. I did as is. My only gripe is that it was pretty dry the next day. Next time I will add more liquid and hope the rice doesnt suck it up.

Comfort food at it's best!  My changes: added frozen mixed veggies, added red pepper flakes (like 1/2 tsp) and increased the amount of the rest of the seasoning.  Finally, instead of crackers, I used corn flakes. Yum!  (oh, and I had to use two pans because it made so much) both times I've made it.

Exellent dinner! and quick! I had to improvise on some of the ingrediants. I didnt have enough velveeta cheese so I used half velveeta and half cream cheese, and I used saltines instead of butter crackers, and it still turned out sooo yummy. I bet corn flakes would be good to use as well instead of crackers. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I made a few changes as suggested and this was pretty good.  Not bad for a weekday meal as it doesn't take too long to make if you have cooked chicken on hand.  The changes I made were as follows:  1 medium onion and 2 celery stalks chopped which I cooked in the melted butter before adding flour. I only used 1 tsp. bouillon but will leave this out completely next time I make it. For additional chicken flavor I added 1 can of cream of chicken and substituted crushed corn flakes in place of the crackers as I didn't have any on hand.  Family loved it, I thought it needed something to add to the flavor but not bad overall.

This recipe is fantastic based on the sauce.  However, I didn't follow this recipe very well so I'm really saying the sauce is a great base.  I used real cheese instead of velveeta.  I used a cheddar/monterey jack mix but you can use whatever kind of cheese you want.  I also halved the recipe and that actually gave us the 6 servings this recipe claims.  I did not do the crackers drenched in butter, either, but instead pulsed two torn up slices of whole wheat bread in my blender and topped the dish with those.  They browned very nicely in the 13 minutes I had the casserole in the oven.  Finally I used milk instead of sour cream to thin the sauce as it's far fewer calories and uses quite a bit less.  It was fantastic and my husband declared this "a keeper".  Next time I will also add steamed broccoli.  I will also saute onions when making the roux.  The sauce thickened very quickly so this really is a quick and easy recipe!  You can also use egg noodles instead of rice for another variation.

I love this recipe and make it often. We have tons of leftovers every time. Normally I hate eating leftovers, but I never mind re-heating this dish. We use low sodium (Ritz) crackers for the topping, and low sodium chicken boullion.

We really enjoyed this but did make some changes.  I used a rotisserie chicken, about 2 cups cheddar and 1/2 cup parmesan cheese, and a bouillon cube instead of granules.  I also used 2 cups uncooked rice which resulted in 6 cups cooked and this was a good amount for us.  I also used 1 cup heavy cream and 1 cup milk just because I needed to use the cream.  One sleeve of town house crackers.  I will make this again.

This was SUPER MEGA AWESOME. INCREDIBLE. Delicious with a capital D!!!  I used lowfat milk, low fat sour cream, made the rice in chicken broth, added broccoli, and instead of Velveeta I used 5 oz. shredded sharp cheddar and 1 oz. shredded mozzarella. I made a half version, so it was 3 servings but for us, it was 4. This recipe was a HUGE HIT and will become a staple in my home. THANK YOU.

This was really good.  It was even better as leftovers.  The only thing I altered was the bouillon powder.  I used 2 bouillon cubes instead (I didn't have powder).  Also, I didn't use the crackers, and it was just fine.  Highly recommend this recipe!

The high cal/fat of the original was a downer for me, but I thought it was a good jumping-off point for my own version. I used 2 cups of cooked rice, 2 cups of leftover rotisserie chicken, covered with a basic bechamel to which I added thyme, salt, pepper, garlic powder, 1/4 c shredded 4-cheese blend and maybe 1 T cream cheese. I put some mozz on top and yum, yum!  This is a good idea that you can make your own.

This was soooooo good! We had it for leftovers every day afterwards until it was gone. Definitely has more than 6 servings. I made a few substitutions only because I was short on some ingredients. Instead of 2 cups sour cream I used 1 cup sour cream and 1 cup cottage cheese. I only used 3 cups chicken, and I used whtie basmati rice instead of regular white rice. This is the best casserole I have made yet! YUM!

I changed a few things with this, I used brown rice, in the same amount, but used half the amount of the rest of the ingredients(it worked great and was still very creamy!) then used as suggested by others, Frenches onions on top. It was perfect, but if brown rice is used it's much better the next day. (It would be perfect for a "make ahead" dish.) My husband even liked it and he is not a chicken and rice casserole fan! I will make this again! Thank you!

Very good.  My girls all finished their dinner!  I boiled the rice in chicken broth, omitted the bouillon, and did half sour cream and half mayo because I didn't have enough sour cream.  I think the mayo and chicken broth added a lot of flavor.  I didn't put crackers on top because my little girl is gluten sensitive. (I also used rice flour to thicken the sauce.)  Instead of Velveeta I added a cup of cubed cheddar.  Great recipe!

The first time I made this my family could take it or leave it.  I tried it again using cream of chicken soup instead of the bachemel sauce, threw in some chopped broccoli, and skipped baking it.  Everyone seemed to like it much better.

We have been making this for years. My kids request it all the time. It is high in fat, so I substitute FF milk, red. fat cheese, FF sour cream, and my original recipe that I use calls for 1/2 c, butter, divided, not 3/4 c. Which would be way too much. We have also used brown rice before which is yummy too.

This was a very yummy casserole! My husband and kids loved it. I made a few small changes--added cooked broccoli, used half velveeta and half shredded cheddar cheese. Instead of mixing the cracker crumbs with butter, I sprinkled the crumbs over the dish and drizzled 1/4 c. melted butter over them. Half a cup seemed a bit excessive--the topping still browned nicely and added a great flavor. It did brown quickly, so I covered the dish with foil for about half the baking time.  I also added basil and oregano to the sauce, since I didn't have any buillion cubes and wanted some extra flavor. I'll certainly make this one again, thanks!!

I liked this very much!! It was a little much in the fat and calorie dept.  So.... I chaged it a little, I used brown rice 1% milk low fat sour cream and it was still very good.  Next time I am going to add peas carotts. But I did think it was very good.

This was okay. It got too dry at the end, not sauce-like at all. I put some peas in it, that made it taste better, but the consistency was not good.

This recipe is TO DIE FOR!!!!  I even put too much rice and it still turned out well.  We plan on using the sauce alone over grilled chicken breasts, it was awesome.  

This recipe took a little more time to make than I like (I'm a working mom) but it was worth it.

This recipe was just ok.  It was too cheesy.  It tastes like Velveeta shells and cheese, except with rice.  If I made this again I would probably sub cheddar for Velveeta, and sub cream of mushroom for milk. Sorry

This was great! I was looking for a chicken tetrazini recipe like the one a local restaurant serves and saw this. I subsituted wild rice for white and used cheddar cheese and a little less sour cream. It was just the right texture and richness. I served it with steamed brocoli to my fiance and 3 year old. Both loved it! We have enough left overs for 2 more meals!

Increase spices
Decrease butter on topping

I will definately make this one again with my own cajun variation.  Thanks for sharing this one with us all.

WOW is this tasty! Quick, easy, fast meal in minutes. I was very skeptical about this recipe. I‚Äôm not a huge fan of Velveeta but I do like the creamy texture of it in some recipes, so I did modify the recipe to use 6oz Velveeta  and 6 oz sharp cheddar and that was about a perfect mix. I used onion strings instead of crackers. I threw in a can of mixed veggies and I thought it was great! I will say, the bullion or chicken stock paste (better than bullion) does make a difference. I initially forgot it in the cheese sauce and the flavor was not right, once I added it, the sauce came together from a flavor perspective. Overall, this will be my go to dish for pot lucks from here on out. The husband loved it too.

I didn‚Äôt have enough Ritz crackers on hand..just used one pack of Ritz bacon flavored. And just used shredded mild cheddar cheese instead of Velveeta. It turned out pretty tasty. When I make it next time I‚Äôll try it with the Frenches Onions as others have done. ????

Turned out really good....best if you use the broth to boil the rice.. I also added 1 can cream of chicken soup  to provide a little more moisture.  When reheating, add a spoonful of sour cream or a splash of milk for moisture. Flavor was great though....quickly a favorite for potluck....

This was great! I did double the bullion. I also added some seasoning to the butter before mixing the crackers in. I don't think the Velveeta is a must if you aren't a fan of it. Thanks for sharing. Dinner was a hit.

This was very tasty. I saut√©ed onion and diced celery and used cooked wild rice. Added dash of cayenne. Also used shredded 2% cheddar cheese, low fat sour cream and skim milk. It was very good even with using low fat ingredients. Will make it again.

I made this for my family. My husband isn't a fan of chicken but he liked it so much he declared it one of the best chicken dishes he has had which says a lot for it since he doesn't really love chicken. I followed the recipe and instead of ritz crackers (which I didn't have) I used plain bagel chips. It was delicious.

Family devoured this dish - it will remain a go-to recipe in my house.  Easy to adjust to personal taste and in the future I will add veggies and try different types of cheese.

My family liked it a lot.  I used 2 cups of Mexi-Blend shredded cheese instead of Velvetta, and added about 1 cup  of French's Fried Onions mixed with the crumbled crackers.  We'll have it again!

I changed the servings to 4 servings. Used just 1 cup sour cream.   Baked in a 9" square pan.  For every day it sat in the frig it tasted better.

This is a huge favorite of everyone I make it for.  I often take it to new moms, who need yummy comfort type food.  It comes together pretty easy so I try to always keep the ingredients on hand.

Can't say I liked this recipe. I took the suggestions of other reviewers and saut√©ed onions and celery to add more flavour it still wasn't to my liking.  Sorry but will not be making this again.

This went over really well!  I made it almost exactly as its listed.  I did cook my rice in chicken broth instead of water for taste reasons but otherwise, I wanted to try it exact before making my tweaks.  It was great.  I fed it to a bunch of friends and they went back for seconds and thirds!  The pan was empty when the dust settled!  I think you could easily substitute mashed potatoes or even egg noodles instead of the rice.  Very creamy and cheesy.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this for our Super Sunday church service and it was amazing!! There were only three things I did differently, but it was my fault. It called for more sour cream than I had, I only had half of what the recipe called for so I substituted the other half with a can of condensed cream of mushroom soup. It called for processed cheese and all I had was shredded Velveeta. I will make this again where I can follow the recipe exactly. I also used Brown rice (because that's what I have) my children said I have to cook it again!! Absolutely no complaints!

Made this for dinner last night and it was a hit! The only thing I did differently was use shredded Mexican style cheese in place of the fake processed cheese food called for. Was out of Cheddar or I would have used that. I also added a 1/2 cup of French fried onions to the cracker crumbs, other that that I stuck to the recipe. I can't say we'll have it too often because of all the fats in it but it will definitely be a now and then special occasion treat. My son had his bottle of wing sauce ready in case it lacked flavor for him but he didn't use it after all. Yummy stuff! One plus was no cans of soup in this recipe!

My husband and I absolutely love this! It is creamy, very flavorful, and overall satisfying. And I agree, that it is even better as a leftover. For whatever reason, my kids aren't as crazy about it, but will eat it. We use less rice, and if you are a non-processed cheese kind of person, you can leave out the Velveeta.  Just add another cup of milk, 1/4c butter and 1/4c flour.  The mixture without the Velveeta is equally amazing.

Very yummy.  This will replace my cream of chicken soup recipe I usually make for dinner.  I used Cheddar Cheese not Velveeta (personal preference) and boiled the rice in stock. Next time I will try adding some frozen veggies and string the mixture into the rice before baking. I may have made mine too thick, but it didn't get all the way down into the pan of rice.  It was still really good.

We used real cheese rather than processed velveeta and it was delicious.. if you use shredded it melts easier.

Great use of leftover chicken and rice.  I would make it more if cooking with velveeta didn't make me feel guilty.

Really enjoyed this recipe as written. Used white Velveeta instead of the yellow (the white has a milder flavor). Iadd two boxes of frozen broccoli to the rice as it cooked, and I threw two handfuls of shredded white cheddar into the cheese sauce. When mixing, I had the chicken, rice and broccoli already in the baking pan, and just poured the cheese sauce over and stirred together. Made crumb topping as written and we loved it!   It's a keeper, thanks for sharing!

Good comfort food recipe, but was clearly something was missing. I think a little chopped onion would do the trick to add more flavor and make it worthy of another star.  For the cheese, I opted to use a combination of sharp and medium shredded cheddar.  I also used plain greek yogurt in place of sour cream.  I have been doing that in all recipes that use sour cream lately and you really cannot tell the difference.

cut in half once for an 8x8 pan, but ended up using an 8 oz block of velveeta (instead of 6) and 2 small sleeves of ritz with 1/4 c butter (maybe could use less of the butter?) for the top.  It was good, but maybe could try using 4 oz of the cheese next time (is there such a thing as too cheesy??)

Tried this recipe and added somethings that some reviews mentioned; I did use carrots and peas and instead of using regular rice I used the chicken flavored rice. Next time Im using chicken and broccoli flavored rice. Very good recipe.

One of my very favorite recipes to make!  I've added different veggies (broccoli, onions, etc) & tried different toppings (like french fried onions) to switch it up, and it always turns out excellent.  So easy & is great re-heated! I always use real cheese, too!

LOVED it!!  Maybe a little too rich - less cheese next time?  Leftovers were even better.  I did the corn flakes topping.

This recipe is delicious, but really is way too fattening.  I cut down on velveeta, left out the butter at the end, used lowfat milk, did not add salt (plenty of salt in the bouillon), used lowfat sour cream, and added a lot of broccoli.  My changes added a healthy side and it was still great!

This recipe is great but I would add frozen broccoli next time. I also added the fried onions on top instead of crackers-I can't imagine it with crackers I think this other option is much better! I was short 1 cup of chicken ( i cooked up 3 chicken breast and could have easily cooked up 4 or 5) but it was still good. I kept the velveeta cheese and thought it was perfect. It looked so good when It was all made up. I give it 4 stars.

A little time consuming but, overall YUMMY......I substituted a small can of cream of chicken soup instead of using the required amount of sour cream.  I used about a cup of SC.  I also used mozarella instead of velveeta!

This is great....however I did change a few things....I didn't have rice so I used penne pasta.  Didn't have crackers so I used crumbled Corn Flakes instead.  My family loved it, I'll make it again.

I made this within thirty min and everyone loved it. The only thing I changed was the sour cream. I left that out. The sauce is amazing, though. I am thinking about using it as a gravy and on some others things. All and all, it was yummy!

This was good.  My husband really liked it. I took some of the ideas everyone posted to spice it up a little, but I didn't change too much.  I added Chicken Base to the rice and used the base instead of the bouillon for the cheese sauce.  Also instead of crackers I topped with cheddar and mozzarella cheese just because I'm not a fan of the cracker topping.  The cheese got nice and golden and really worked with the recipe.  My husband said it reminded him of Mac & Cheese, which is a good thing!  I think that the next time I make this I will add some broccoli but other than that I thought it didn't really need anything else!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This recipe is excellent!!  Yes, it‚Äôs not a ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù dish and you can make substitutions to make it lighter, but every once in a while, it‚Äôs great to make a recipe as is and ‚Äútreat‚Äù yourself.  I am a vegan, so I vegainzed this recipe using soymilk, tofutti better than sour cream, earth balance ‚Äúbutter‚Äù, vegetarian ‚Äúchicken‚Äù bouillon, gardin chick‚Äôn filets, and Follow Your Heart cheddar ‚Äúcheese‚Äù.  I used 1 ¬æ cup of soymilk and ¬º cup of white wine (Pinot Grigio), topped the rice with a bag of steamed broccoli and some saut√©ed baby bello mushrooms and omitted the seasoned salt (there was enough salt from the bouillon).    Other than that, I followed the recipe verbatim and it was excellent!!  It‚Äôs satisfying, filling, creamy and delicious!!  It doesn‚Äôt take much to fill you up.    You can make this recipe using as assortment of steamed veggies instead of rice and it would still be excellent.  You could probably substitute the milk for ‚Äúchicken‚Äù broth and lighter versions of things (sour cream, milk, cheese, etc.) to make it lighter.

This was easy and delicious.  I have tried the soup version of this but it never came out right.  I substituted the velveeta for a mix of sharp and mild cheddar.  I also used left over chicken from the night before.  Exactly what a chicken rice casserole should taste like!

I used minced garlic (instead of powder), added frozen mixed veggies (after blanching them) and added more crushed crackers than called for (as someone else suggested) and it was DELICIOUS!  My husband will EAT just about anything but is REALLY stingy with compliments - but loved this.  He said this makes his Top 10. :) A very hearty, homestyle meal.

Simple to make. I didn't have a lot of cheese on hand so I also added a can of cream of mushroom soup, just to be sure it had enough flavor. It was very creamy and rib-sticking and the family liked it.

I cut this recipe in half. Added half a bag of corn. I didn't have sour cream on hand so had to substitute (almost 1 cup milk plus 1 tbls lemon juice sitting out to sour and an extra 3 tbls melted butter). I also didn't have cheese so I omitted it and I used canned chicken. It was delicious for something so quick and easy! It will definitely be a staple meal in our house. Good comfort food!

This recipe was good. I liked it because it was simple and i was able to use ingredients i had around the house. instead of the cracker top. i decided to use cornbread. i put white rice on bottom. then the chicken. and i poured cornbread batter over top and baked. It was delicious.

very good dish. i was searching for something a bit different than normal for my husband and i and came across this. i had all ingredients on hand, but altered the cooking a bit to fit my schedule. i thought it would be way too creamy, but to my surprise it was perfect. instead of all velveeta, i cut back on it and added a bit of colby jack. delicious!!!

While I enjoyed this dish, the rest of my family thought it was planned.  They did say they'd want it again....we'll just spice it up a little.  : )

I cut the fat way down on this by using a combination of 1% milk and fat free sour cream in place of the cream, used about 1/3 c of reduced fat shredded cheese and didnt use the topping.  I served them over biscuits and the family consensus was that this was OK, not amazing..they prefer chicken a la king if looking for a creamy chicken dish

This was great cold weather comfort food! I used lite sour cream and 1% milk and it was still very rich and creamy. I also added a little cheddar cheese and some mixed veggies to make it more of a complete meal. Served it with biscuits. It was delicious! I will definitely make this again!

This tasted good, but I found it to be rich. to the point where once you get half way through you don't feel like eating it anymore.

I think this recipe has promise, but I found it wayyyy too rich. Too much cheese! I think, next time, I'll half the cheese and omit the sour cream.  Otherwise, I think it's goood! My family loved it, though.

One of my new family favorites! This is an exceptional recipe. I have made it 3 times now and I have to say, if you use Jasmine rice in place of regular rice it makes a great recipe a phenomenal one! It is SO worth the extra expense for the Jasmine rice. (I do 1 1/2 the suace ingredients and  also use 2% velveeta and low fat sour cream to cut calories and you can't tell!)

Ate nearly half the pan myself! Used a can of cheese sauce I had leftover from a party and 2 c rice leftover from last night's dinner. The sauce was great!! I too probably should have combined some veggies with the rice/sauce, but put green beans underneath my serving and it got mixed in anyway. Wonderful!

Awesome! Everyone in my family loves it. Daughter asks for it anytime I tell her I'm making chicken for supper. The first time I made it, I used shredded cheddar chesse (That's what I had on hand). The next time I used Veleeta. I like it both ways, Husband likes it better w/ Velveeta. This is now our new "chicken n rice" favorite, Thanks for the recipe!

Way too easy to make and my family loved it! Modified the recipe a little, too, at the suggestion of previous posters: added 2 cups cooked mixed vegetables, onion and fried onions on top instead of crackers.  Can't wait to try the leftovers tomorrow.

Absolutely scrumptious! An easy and delicious comfort food. My 19-month old toddler can't get enough. To cut down on the fat, I used light sour cream and 2% milk Velveeta. This will definitely be a permanent recipe in my rotation.

I took this casserole to a friends house for a potluck dinner and it was a HUGE hit! We even loved the leftovers even more.  The only thing I did different was cut the amount of cheese almost in half. Will definitely make again.

I loved this recipe.  It did not have too much of anything.  My boyfriend especially loved it.  I would recommend this.  I did put some peas and carrots not only for color but, I did not have to use a separate dish for vegetables.

Absolutely delicious!  I used brown rice instead of white and my 3-year-old didn't even notice!  I also used cheddar cheese instead of velvetta. I added a veggie mix for color and variety.

Great recipe! I hate boiled rice, but the sauce gave it so much flavor. The only negative thing is that when this dish cools  it gets very thick. I think it tastes even better reheated.

Everyone loved this dinner.  I had to change quite a bit though because of the calories and the fat.  I actually screwed this up and used macaroni instead by accident..added fresh garlic.  Omitted the crackers and the other half cup of butter.  Used 1 1/2 cups reduced fat milk and 1 cup reduced fat sour cream.  Also substituted reduced fat cheddar instead of velveta.
Very good and easy to make...will definately be making this again.

Very good. I used cheddar instead of Velveeta, added some minced garlic, frozen peas and onion. I mixed it all together instead of layering and topped with cheddar and buttered bread crumbs. Will make again.

This was awesome! My husband raved over it. I would change nothing...it is perfect as is. The only caveat is it is probably really fattening. It was soo filling! This is for one of those days you could care less about fat grams!

This was just ok in my opinion. It is definitely creamy, although I would've preferred more bulk in the form of added rice. It just seemed like it needed "something." I will probably keep looking for other chicken casserole recipes.

This was a really yummy recipe, but had a little too much fat for me! I made it more low fat by using less butter, 1% milk, and instead of Velveeta I used a mixture of mozzarella and cheddar cheese. I took some other's advice and added some broccli to make it a complete meal . Instead of the butter and crackers, I simply sprinkled some breadcrumbs on top of everything. YUM!!

I made this for dinner today; it was delicious!  I halved the recipe, but otherwise followed it exactly, and my husband and son both loved it.  Now I'm sorry I didn't make enough for a 13x9x3 inch pan, it would be nice to have add more left over.  Oh well, I'll just have to make this again that much sooner.  Thanks for a great recipe, Janet.

Your recipe is good the first day and spectacular day two and three. From now on, I'll cook it the day before. My family is already asking for it again. I sure appreciate you sharing it. I didn't change a thing except I didn't have the crackers. I served it with steamed veggies and a salad. It was a big hit at our house. Thanks, again.

I thought this recipe would be perfect for leftover turkey from the holidays.  It was very good but it seemed like it was missing something.  I will make this again, but I will add veggies and some more seasoning.  My husband thought it was great and had three helpings.

Well, my husband and daughter enjoyed it. I omitted the sour cream because I didn't have any and added a layer of green beans between the rice and cheese-chicken mixture. The cheese flavor was a bit odd for me, and it could have just been that I didn't have the sour cream. I might try this again with a different kind of cheese as others suggested.

This recipe is very good, not gourmet but tasty comfort food.  I didn't make the topping and used a combination of Velveeta and cheddar cheese.  I only used about half of the sour cream and it still turned out very rich, might cut down even more.  I also added a large bag of frozen broccoli and will probably add even more veggies next time.  All in all a keeper!

This recipe is FABULOUS!  We've made it 4 times in the last 3 weeks.  It's really easy to make with stuff you probably have lying around and is extremely tasty.  I used cheddar instead of velveeta and waited to put the chicken in until after the cheese had melted.  I also put in a little less sour cream and use less bread crumbs on top, but that's just me.  I use approximate measurements rather than digging out the measuring cups, but it comes out great every time!

What a simple and comforting dish.  I doubled this and took it to my sisters house after she had her 3rd son.  Her family are very picky eaters and they all gobbled it up and were very happy to have a second casserole leftover for the next day.  I also did not add the chicken to the sauce until the end, it does make for easier mixing.

I've made this twice already since finding it a few weeks ago, which I never do. My husband really loves this one, and he hates everything. When I made it the second time I made more, and he said "You can never make enough of this!!" :DD Added peas, red pepper flakes, and Louisiana hot sauce, since he likes things a little spicy. Also omitted the topping. Delicious!

Sort of like making your own chicken helped, but BETTER.  It was real easy and really good - even as leftovers; which you'll have since it served a lot more than it said it would.  :)

"Now this was really good!"  my daughter said after finishing her plate of Creamy Chicken and Rice.
My whole family enjoyed it.  It's a great dish that isn't time consuming to make.  Thanks!
