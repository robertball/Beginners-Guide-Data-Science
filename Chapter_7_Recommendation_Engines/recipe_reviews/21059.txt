Easy to prepare in a rice cooker but does need more spices for such a large volume of rice!!  More salt and pepper at the very least!!

I loved this! I cooked up whatever vegetables I had first, then cooked the rice in the skillet with them. Goes great with some diced chicken.

"Flavorful rice" not so flavorful.  If you try this recipe, consider adding more spices.

Turned out great! The light flavor made it an ideal accompaniment for a main course of baked trout.

Nothing special... good rice to go along with something that has a very strong flavor, though.

I enjoyed this dish. It was new, different, and very easy. My family didn't think it was much to shout for but they ate every bit of it. Next time I will try ROTEL

Pretty good.  It would be easy to add kidney beans or chicken and make it a one dish meal.

Terrible. There was NO flavor to the rice. I substituted balsamic vinegar for the white vinegar and it STILL lacked flavor. If balsamic could not save this dish nothing can!

Found this rice to be very bland. Perhaps more spices would help.

very good. I used a lessor amount of rice and adjusted the other ingredients to rice measurements.

I did half the amount of rice/water and the same amount of spices, as per advice from other reviewers.  I still put in a whole can of tomatoes.  I usually have these ingredients on hand, so if I need a quick side, I'd probably make this dish again.  It wasn't super good, but it was filling and it goes with just about any kind of beef/chicken/fish.
