These turned out really good. I'll admit it would have been much easier just to drop them in a deep fryer but this was a nice healthier alternative. Keep a close eye on your sauce. I got distracted and let mine go 45 seconds and it had started to burn. These were not bland or too spicy but had just the right amount of heat to them. Thanks for sharing!

This was really easy to make, and was pretty delicious. I am not sure if I added too much cayenne, but it was really hot. Definitely making this again, but will probably change the spices up a little bit to suit our tastes. I liked the baking the hot chicken instead of frying aspect of this recipe a lot.

A new favorite!  So delicious & crispy & low cal, you'd think it was fried. Just enough heat in the spice to not overwhelm the kids or faint of heart.

My husband and I love hot chicken and this is a great healthier alternative to the real thing.  We like it HOT, so I used more hot sauce and cayenne.  Very yummy.  Thanks for the recipe!

Did not use the oil mixture at the end because of dietary preferences. It had some heat to it which we love!

My family and I thought this was really good. It wasnâ€™t as crispy as we normally like, but the flavor was definitely there. I will make it again!

I followed the recipe word for word and it was 2 stars as it's written. 1. It tastes nothing like Nashville hot chicken. 2. It was way too salty. The salt needs to be cut by half and maybe even left out of the oil. 3. The breading was soggy. It would better fried. I may try making it again, but I honestly didn't think it was worth the effort.

We did not like it at all.  It was salty and tasted like flour.  I  used a convection oven so I thought it would be crispy but it was not.  We ended up throwing it out.

The chicken itself before the sauce was OK. That's why I gave it 2 stars. There was so much excess flour on the chicken, presumably to get the sauce to stick it it? However, I found the sauce to be plain gross. It tasted like oil with added spices and an overwhelming amount of cayenne - bleh. I tried heating it longer to help everything mingle and then it just tasted burnt. I decided to toss it and just coat the chicken in honey mustard and bbq sauce. Would not make again.

This was delicious and easy to make! It was WAY too salty though. I'd probably cut out the salt in the breading and sauce next time bc with the brine, the chicken is salty enough!

It was definitely hot. That's about it.
