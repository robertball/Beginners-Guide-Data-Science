Finally!  I have been searching for this recipe for years!  My Aunt goes to Italy every year and brings these back for me because I love them so much.  They are chocolately and spicey and keep for  quite a while and the older they get the better they taste!  Perfect for Christmas cookies. The kind I get normally have a chocolate icing, but this one is good too.  The only recommendation I have it to refrigerate the dough for about 30 minutes before rolling it out to make the process easier.
