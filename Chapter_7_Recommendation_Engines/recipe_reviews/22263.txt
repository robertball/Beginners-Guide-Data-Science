A great recipe, but I found you can cut out most of the butter to reduce fat and still maintain the great flavours.

What a nice change from the usual brussels sprouts with bacon! I sliced mine in half and boiled them for about 10 mins but will shorten that for next time since I like them a little more crisp. I used red grapes, garlic, less butter and olive oil and omitted the onions. I sprinkled a little parmesan and bread crumbs before serving but I think next time I'll try some goat cheese or gorgonzola. Last week I had dinner at a Lebanese restaurant in NY and one of our appetizers was this dish! They used green grapes and it was also delicious. However, I believe the restaurant's version was oven-roasted and there was a cheese sprinkled on top if I remember correctly. I will definitely make this one again!

This was fabulous! All of my family loved it. Just a couple of tweaks; I used frozen Brussel Sprouts and let them thaw in the fridge. They were just right for tossing in without the boiling stage (big time saver) plus they're smaller so no need to slice into halves and they were a nice size with the large red grapes. I also followed the advice of another review and used walnuts (large chop) at the very end just before serving EXCELLENT touch!  I used jar chopped garlic and since there were no green onions in the house I used chives from the garden. I let mine sit long enough to get a bit of a carmelized effect on the sprouts for huge flavor.  This was the best, you just have to be brave and give it a go.

Hmm... although my husband liked it, this will not be a "do over". There's a time and a place for brussel sprouts and grapes, but the same pot is not it. To put it another way... I like chocolate, and I also like niblet corn, but I'm not going to cook them together either.

This was good, but a little heavy on the fat side.  The garlic is the predominant flavour here, along with the butter.  The grapes realy balance this vegetable dish.  I thought it was so odd, I had to try it.  I served it at our Thanksgiving dinner, and had surprised reviews on it...from Wow, gapes and brussel Sprouts..to...I don' like brussel sprouts, but this is interesting.  It was a fun dish to serve.  I bet it wd taste even better with a little lemon juice.  I would do it again...but I would like to experiment with another recipe for brussel sprouts until I find the perfet combination of spices for these little baby cabbages!!

This is the first time I have been able to get the bitter taste out of brussels sprouts. A totally fantastic recipe. I almost ate the whole pan myself!

This seemed like an interesting recipe to try, but it turned out just okay for me.  My husband only ate one bite and  I finished my serving fine. Perfectly edible but not particularly enjoyable for us.  Thanks anyway!

Thought this recipe would be wierd, but it was great.  We both love brussel sprouts and grapes, but couldn't imagine them together.  I used some white onions and omitted the butter.  The results were great.  I'll definitely make again.

I made this recipe for the first time and took it to a holiday party. It was well-liked, everyone wanted the recipe. I didn't use any butter, but did add more olive oil.

Very delicious, we all loved it. Next time, I will not cook the sprouts so long in boiling water. If I use fresh sprouts I might even consider bypassing the boiling water part, I like my sprouts with a little crunch.

I used a small bag of frozen brussel sprouts. I pricked the bag and cooked them in the bag in the microwave on HI for about 4 minutes. Cut each brussel sprout in 1/2 before combining with the other ingredients. Also 1/2 the other ingredients, and I only used about 1T. olive oil, cooking in a non-stick skillet to cook them. The taste was similar to an Asian sweet-sour with the grape, onion, garlic against the brussel sprouts. Quite tasty!

What a delightful way to serve Brussels sprouts, people who don't eat them wanted to try them, the greens and the red grapes make a terrific presentation, and the garlic draws the curious in.

We frequently get Brussels sprouts from the market, get home, and remember we don't care for the taste of them all that much.  I told my husband about this new website I was using, we looked up recipes and found this one.  Weird, it's true, but, boy, did the sweetness of the grapes ever make the sprouts not only palatable but very tasty!  We'll make this one again!

I made this for Thanksgiving, and it was a huge hit! It is an unusual combination, but I find the grapes give the sprouts a really nice flavor. I make it as is, except the sprouts tend to cook down, so make extra.

3 and a half stars.  This is pretty bland with green grapes--so we'll give it another go with red, as the recipe is written.  My 3 year old didn't go for it; I thought he would.  Would pair well with pork chop or ham meal, most likely.  Seemed to be lacking something, so be plenty liberal with the grapes!

I have made this now for 4 Christmases. Our family loves this recipe. I chose it for my vegetarian son at first but we all fell in love with it. In fact for my Granddaughter brussels sprouts have become her favorite food altogether.

I had brussels sprouts, red grapes, and green onions left over from my Christmas menu so I thought what the heck? These were surprisingly good. As written I can only give it 4 stars. 30 minutes total cook time on the sprouts was too long and 4 tablespoons of butter is too much in my opinion. Cut the cook time and butter and you have yourself a unique and wonderful side dish.

Quick and different - I think it would be fun to serve to guests.  This is made even quicker if you buy the Steamfresh Brussels Sprouts.  Thanks submitter.
