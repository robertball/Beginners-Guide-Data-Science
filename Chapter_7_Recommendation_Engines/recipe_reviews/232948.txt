I make a variation of this and love it!! I use 2 cans each of shoe peg corn and black beans, about 2 cups of diced celery, a third of a medium diced sweet onion, and half of a diced red pepper. After prepping the veggies, I make a vinegarette out of 1/3 c white sugar, 1/3 c apple cider vinegar, and 1/3 c vegetable oil that I heat to boiling in the microwave and pour over the veggies. It's best if you can let it sit overnight...serve with chips and it's guaranteed to be gone quickly :) I even won a cooking contest at work with this!!

This is extremely similar to  a recipe my sister and I use.  However, we only use 1 type of pepper-red, add a TBSP of cilantro, a can of rinsed garbanzos, omit the black-eyed peas, and mix with a ready-made zesty italian dressing.  Because it is a chunky salsa, it's served with scoop chips.  Very yummy!
