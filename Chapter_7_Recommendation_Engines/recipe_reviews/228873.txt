This is one of my favorite ways to eat Brussels Sprouts. I do add a pinch of crushed red pepper when I add the parmesan cheese to give it a little kick but other than that, I keep to the recipe. Two servings......psh. Nope. I eat the whole thing myself.

I decided to thinly slice the Brussels sprouts and jazzed them up with some sliced, caramelized shallots.

I wish I could make this a 6 star recipe because I have only had brussel sprouts twice in my life and I HATED them.  My husband insisted on buying these little alien vegetables last week as he has loved them as a kid so I scoured the net for seemed to be the best way to eat them.  I settled on this recipe and I can't believe how much I now love brussel sprouts.  I have cooked them twice since and I will keep cooking them thanks to this recipe.  I love this website!  thank you

Darn delicious! Added crushed red pepper and substituted asiago for Parmesan and it was delicious. Quadruple the recipe for a family size I would say!

FANTASTIC! I did cheat and use 'steamfresh' brussels sprouts, so I did this slightly differently...I cooked the sprouts according to the pkg. While they were cooking, I melted 1/2 the butter in a pan on low heat and added in the garlic. When the sprouts were done cooking, I cut them in 1/2 and added them to the pan (turned the heat up), to allow them to brown. I flipped them and added in the other 1/2 of the butter, along w/ the salt and pepper. When they were done, I plated them and sprinkled the cheese on top. GREAT flavor, and something that I will be making VERY often~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Simple and excellent.   I made a very minor change to shift to a healthier fat content: I melted 1/2 TBL butter and 1 TBL olive oil to saute the garlic and then added the brussel sprouts with 1/2 TBL additional butter. Half way through the cooking, added another 1/2 TBL butter.  This was plenty of butter/oil for 1 lb of brussel sprouts, and my family loved it.  Thanks for a great recipe!

We liked these!  The only part I didnâ€™t like was cooking them in a skillet.  They took far longer to cook then indicated in the recipe and began to burn, so I had to turn the heat way down until they were done.  Also by slicing them in half, you loose a lot of the outside leaves as you are turning and cooking them.  I would leave them whole next time and roast them in the oven, then sprinkle with the parmesan cheese.

I like to roast the brussel sprouts cut in half, 450-475,  drizzled with olive oil  or sprayed with Pam, salt and pepper.  Easier than cooking in a pan.  Then will add the Parmesan. 
  Another way is to roast them, then coat with equal amount of maple syrup and balsamic vinegar (1T each, cook 40 seconds in microwave first). Delicious!

Mmmmmm Gooood!!!!!  Thanks for a really tasty recipe.  They were a big hit at my Thanksgiving table...even by those who are not crazy about brussel sprouts.  This will be my "go to" way of fixing them from now on.  Pretty much followed the recipe to the letter.  Next time tho I want to try adding a dash of red pepper flakes as recommended by another reviewer...just to add a little zing!

This is a tasty way to prepare Brussels sprouts.  The ingredient list is strange here.  Butter is listed three times.  And only six Brussels sprouts?  I used many more than that!  Sprouts are sold here in the fresh produce in a net bag (maybe a pound?).  Quite a few...filled my skillet.  I used a tablespoon of butter and a little avocado oil to brown them. Added a little water (could use chicken broth) to help them cook.  Sprinkled on the cheese and seasonings and covered a minute to melt the cheese.  (No added butter.)  I think some walnuts would be a nice addition if you want to make it a little more special.  Very pretty side dish!  Thank you.

Best brussels sprouts recipe. Don't change a thing -  just watch that your heat is med-low or your garlic will be browned too much. Thank for a brilliant way to eat such a healthy vegetable - amazing as a fish side-dish.

I am not a fan of Brussel sprouts and my husband is and he is the pickiest eater in the universe. I figured I will try this. I cheated with the frozen steamer bag of Brussel sprouts. I heated those with the directions on the bag then through them into a steaming hot pan with half the butter suggested. The Parmesan adds such a yummy bonus here. I was very impressed and hubby was popping these like chips.

I was a little busy in the kitchen when I made these and they got a bit singed but even with that they were still really good. The recipe is easy, healthy, and tasty and I'll be making Brussels sprouts this way again and again.

Easy and simple! I did, however, use only 1 tb of butter altogether instead of 3 to keep it healthy and it turned out great!

I don't like Brussels sprouts usually but these I liked.  the texture was perfect and the taste subtle.  I used the longest cook times and mine were a tad over browned but besides that they were great.  even my 3 yr old ate them.  may use 1 TBS less butter next time to lighten them up a bit.

What an excellent recipe!  I just now made it and we're eating it right now...big hit with everyone...kids included.
Mine were big Brussels sprouts and so I halved them, and the cooking time was perfect. Also added a couple of tablespoons of water, to help them steam a bit. This is now my Brussels sprout go-to recipe. Thank you, Live, for a great recipe!

I just got some brussels sprouts at a farmer's market and tried this recipe out.  It was delicious.  My brussels sprouts were small so I didn't cook them for as long as the directions said--just long enough to brown them a bit.  The garlic I used was also very fresh.  I will make this again soon.

So delicious! I've made Brussels Sprouts another way that I thought was good but this recipe is much better! I made them Christmas Eve for my extended family and they were a hit. Made them just for my family another time and we ate every last one.

Followed the recipe.  I really wanted to like it and based on the reviews had high expectations for something special.  All I can say is, "Meh."  Probably won't make it again.

This was so quick and easy and so yummy!  After I started I realized that I had romano not parmesan but it was delicious..  I also threw some crisp fresh bacon bits on top as well which, although not needed, bacon never ruins anything!

I normally don't like brussels sprouts that much, but this turned out great. We added a little extra garlic, and plenty of Parmesan at the end.

I like Brussels sprouts, & this recipe enhanced them! Read the reviews and added a dash of red pepper flakes.

This recipe was super easy.  I have never eaten Brussels sprout before and heard some negative review of his vegetable. I bought it on sales and wanted to find an easy recipe to follow. I saw some recipes that require baking of 50 minutes. Then I found this recipe and I like it very much. I will definitely make it again.

My DIL absolutely loves Brussels sprouts, but I don't!  I made a vegetarian Thanksgiving, and included these.  While I am still not an avid fan, these were very good and I would gladly eat them again.

Husband doesn't like Brussels sprouts. He really liked this recipe, so did I. Simple to make and very tasty. We added more cheese when serving. Everything is better with more cheese.

I never liked Brussel sprouts nor my husband so never would cook them.  A neighbor gave us a bag and I didn't want to be disrespectful and say no.  Found this recipe and we ate them like they were chocolate chip cookies.   Will make them again in a week or so.

Tasted great. Made 10 servings for a bag of 32 brussels sprouts. Next time I would omit the 2nd serving of butter and just add 1/4 cup of water since the parmesan cheese is oily enough.

I cooked my brussels sprouts as directed and probably cooked them even longer than the time suggested but they came out way to crunchy.  I didn't care for them at all crunchy and I think they would be good cooked even longer.  Maybe I will steam them next time for a short period then follow the directions.  I will state that the brussels were larger than I normally see in the store so even with cutting them in half they were kind of large.

These were absolutely AMAZING!  I actually added a little grated gouda along with the parmesan cheese during the last 30 seconds of cooking as well as 4 cloves of garlic instead of 1 in the beginning.  I don't think we will ever eat brussels sprouts any other way again.  Thank you so much for sharing.

Converted this to 6 servings and made it as a side dish for Thanksgiving.  To save time I put it in oven at 350 degrees till tender.  I left the garlic in large slices so it didn't burn and added the parm after Brussels sprouts were tender and stuck it back in oven for 5 to 10 minutes.

We made this as a really fast side dish. Didn't have parmesan but subbed asiago as anothe reviewer recommended and it was very good. Didn't use nearly as much butter as it called for (about 1/3). Added a few TB of water to help steam the sprouts. Will definitely make again.

I was trying to find a recipe for brussel sprouts without bacon, and this is it--very tasty.  I doubled the recipe which was just right for two people with a few left over.  I did quarter them and subbed some olive oil for part of the butter.  Be careful not to burn the garlic.  This fast and easy recipe is a keeper.

I liked it and will be making it again.  My brussel sprouts weren't as fresh as I would have liked due to being a few days old and I overcooked the garlic just a bit but I still loved it.  I'm sure it will warrant 5 stars when I correct these issues the next time.

I had wanted to double the recipe so used 12 Brussel Sprouts.  When I went back to the recipe I forgot to double it again and used the measurements for 6.  Thank goodness the flavors still worked.  Butter was plenty and salt, pepper and cheese were put on at the end so was able to adjust those.  Oh, and took the advice of taking leaves off of some of the sprouts to crisp.  Delicious!

It was very tasty, and very easy!  Be sure to cook them long enough to cook all the way through, even t he larger pieces.  My husband, and even my son liked them...and that's high praise!

I made this to go with boxing day dinner. I left out the garlic and used olive oil instead of butter, but used lots of parmesan cheese and sprinkled some bread crumbs on top!  It was a real hit!

I've not been successful with fresh Brussels sprouts in the past. Decided to try again and I'm glad I did.  The only change I made was using lemon pepper. This is great! Thanks

I used olive oil instead of butter.  And, the red pepper flakes add a kick.  Also, used lemon zest and splash of fresh lemon juice just before serving.  For larger number of servings, I used a sheet pan in the oven.

This is a great basic recipe that leaves itself open to interpretation. I left it basically as is for my first time, although I used more than six sprouts. We loved it as is, but I can certainly see playing with it... adding cartelized onions, perhaps, or scallions at the end, or nuts (oh yes!) or other spices. The poster who thought it was bland probably added more sprouts but didn't adjust the spices. I used white pepper because my husband isn't allowed black pepper, due to kidney issues, but other than that, it was as written. Definitely going in my recipe box!

Yum!!!!! I did make a couple small edits, didnâ€™t have garlic, so didnâ€™t add it. Also, after turning the sprouts & adding the last tablespoon of butter, I melted a tablespoon of butter & added a 1/2 cup-ish of panko crumbs, combined & then added to the sprouts pan for added flavor & texture. I may have been a bit generous with the parm, but no foul there! Very yummy fish & a great addition to ways to prepare brussel sprouts.

I donâ€™t like Brussels sprouts but I did like these. I took the advice of others and added some chili peppers which made it good but I didnâ€™t halve the sprouts. I did stand them on their cut ends and fried with the garlic in butter, then gave them a stir and finished them off that way. Will definitely be my new veg recipe!

I added another recipe's suggested addition of frying 6 slices of chopped bacon first, then sauteing the garlic in the bacon grease before adding additional butter and the brussels sprouts. It was a raving success!

Very good. Simple, basic, delicious results! Thank you! (I actually added about 10-12 mini potatoes that I just wanted to use up and they worked great together)

SO good! The hubby loved them. I guess I'll be making these again :) I'll try changing it up like others did too. But they are great just like this.

This recipe is over the top delicious.  Only thing I did different was I added more Parmesan as we love Parmesan.  My husband and I both loved this recipe and will definitely make it again...

Easy recipe for a special side  dish. As did Sarah Jo I added crushed red pepper, about 23 tsp. to liven up the sprouts. (My Singaporean wife  says she cannot even taste the hot, so she adds  sliced Thai chili  to her plate.

Good as far as brussel sprouts go. I added about 1/2 a tsp sugar to the mix and that helped balance out the sulphuric flavour of the brussel sprouts. I used an imitation parmesan (because the real thing isn't available where we live), and I think using the real thing would have been better!

This is now my favorite Brussels Sprout recipe!  I caramelized half an onion during the garlic phase of this recipe which added a bit of sweetness.  I also just stirred the Brussels Sprouts rather than cooking them on each side and they turned out fine.

I first boiled the sprouts for 4 minutes then transferred to cast iron skillet and browed.  Caramelized an onion with garlic splash of balsamic vinegar placed on bottom of dish and then placed sprouts on top with the parmesan cheese.

Easy, low cost, delicious, and I'm talking about brussel sprouts!  Crazy!  As is or with a little kick with red pepper, it's yummy. Baked with olive oil was my go to but now I have options with these sprouts.  Nice.

These were so easy and yummy. I used a small bag of sprouts, probably 15 in the package and a little less butter, 2-1/2 tbs butter. Just realized when I went to write the review that I forgot the Parmesan cheese but loved them just the same.

I'm not a vegetable person but never having tried Brussels sprouts I figured this seemed simple enough.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I burned the first batch - I checked them at the 4 minute mark and they were already turning black.  The second batch I checked and flipped at 3 minutes and they came out fine.  While I was so-so on the taste due to my dislike of veggies in general, my husband found them to be very good and said to make them again.

Neither of us have had Brussels sprouts before. This was the  freebie last week where I shop,  so I  decided to try them, not expecting much.
The only change I made was  doubling the  garlic.  We both enjoyed them, thank you for the recipe.

This is a hit! My husband and go through the entire batch of 24 Brussels sprouts. So we make the recipe x4. We made it a few times and the third round made some slight modifications which we preferred: grated Parmesan instead of shredded Parmesan and olive oil (as needed) instead of butter.

Be sure to let the brussels sprouts simmer covered for at least 10 minutes before uncovering and finishing. Outstanding flavor. Do not put the Parmesan on in the pan...

Wonderful complement to rosemary roasted chicken.  I made a double batch as well as roasted root vegetables.  I have leftover root vegetables, but no leftover sprouts....

04.17.17. ~ My hubby loved these sprouts.  I taste them every time I make them and try really hard to like them.  Just not my veggie - DH on the other hand could eat them weekly.  He liked the flavor the garlic butter added and thought the fresh grated Parmesan was a nice touch.  Yes, I will be making them again, for him!

Great recipe, my husband who hated brussel sprouts growing up loved it. Only change I made was adding some spritzes from a lemon with the salt and pepper. The sprouts I got were pretty large, so cooking time was increased a bit. Will definitely make this again.

This recipe is excellent! I kept them covered and turned off the heat after the fifteen minute cooking time while i finished preparing the rest of my dinner. It made them softer, which I liked.

4 kids, husband and I didn't enjoy this BUT if you actually like Brussels sprouts to begin with, you probably would like this recipe.  The parmesan helped but there was still just too much bitter taste for us so I think we'll have to stick to roasting them or using a stronger tasting sauce with a vinegar base.  Made a family sized portion so maybe that's why, but it took longer than stated to cook.

This  was a good recipe. Following some others suggestions, I used a half pound sprouts, a little olive oil (1 tsp) and a total of 1.5 Tablespoons of butter.  I added a few red pepper flakes with the garlic and 3-4 Tablespoons of water for the last 3 minutes.  They were crisp-tender and flavorful.

Delicious! New favourite. I added bacon and green onion, and substituted bacon fat for butter. I've made this with farmer sausage but it was better with bacon. 

I have made this with yellow onion as well. Simply sautee the onion in the bacon fat, or butter or coconut oil. Once translucent, add the garlic and cook as per instructions.

I made more than six as apparent in the pic. Also I added another tablespoon of butter because of so many of them. After flipping, I salted, peppered, and sprinkled the Parmesan cheese over them before transferring them to serve. Best I ever had! Really good if one doesn't really like Brussels sprouts. It might make them favor them.

We love this recipe and make it at least twice a month.  We halve them as it says but we leave them on longer for extra crispiness!   The cheese, garlic and butter melt in your mouth.   Best brussels recipe I ever made so far.

These turned out amazing.  I never thought I could like brussels sprouts prepared this way more than roasted but I DO!  So easy and so nummy.  I put the parmesan on a little too early, definitely sprinkle it on right after you remove it from the heat (I was thinking it might be better slightly melted, but not so much).

YUMMY! LOVE these brussels sprouts, but only 3 each????
Made them before and am making them tonight (more than 6) - looking forward to it. My husband says they don't even taste like brussels sprouts, which suits me fine because I'm not all that fussy about them, but I do like these ones!

Absolutely amazing! I cannot express how tasty and easy this recipe is! My husband is super picky and he loves it. Only thing I changed is I added an extra clove of garlic (Italians what can I say?) and a bit of lemon because it does need a bit of acid. I wish I could afford to cook this every day!

Lovely and delicious!  My brussel sprouts must have been smaller so I used the 3 per person, plus I added an equal volume of raw, cubed Australian Blue winter squash at the same time the brussel sprouts were added to the saute pan.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly, and the 4 of us gobbled it all up! Yummy!!

I did not follow the recipe to a "T", because I have made them before.  I like my brussel sprouts soft, but I also like the crunch and taste of fried, therefore I covered them (to add the steam and soften them) and left them fry a little longer so that they were more than golden brown.  Also, these brussel sprouts were gigantic so they required a little more cook time. 

Love, love, love brussel sprouts with fresh grated parmesan!

Loved it, I steamed them in the microwave for three minutes before I fried them to make sure they were not too crunchy.

Yum.  The ONLY thing I changed, and this is just because I cook with butter way to much, is to add a tablespoon of olive oil to keep my butter from burning.  I also didn't add the additional butter after flipping the sprouts, just a bit more oil.  And I added my Parmesan then stirred real quick and plated it.  Great way to serve sprouts when my family is tired of roasting them.

I usually roast my sprouts, but the oven was full tonight with other veggies. I took a chance on this recipe, and they came out really good! They did, as a few people mentioned, take longer than recommended.

My husband and 10 year old do not like Brussels sprouts.  Not only did my husband TRY it, he had SECONDS!!! I used shaved Brussels sprouts from TJ's and added a little fresh lemon juice half way through cooking, to brighten up the flavor.  ?? (My 10 yr old is still not a fan, but there's still hope.) I used a heavy iron skillet and cooked them for about 14 minutes.

Incredible! I covered it with tin foil before serving and the taste intensified. I then decided to toss it with pasta and toasted pine nuts, a little cream and more parm. Unbelievably good!

Wow, followed recipe mostly, added about 10-12 halved sprouts vs 6 (way too few) and added with last portion of butter, a drizzle of maple syrup, chopped pecans and cran-raisins. Adding the handful of bright leaves uncooked at end, as suggested, was fantastic, brightened up the dish and did really add that bit of crunch, along with the pecans. The main dish was 4 chicken thighs baked with wedged red potatoes and onions and sliced mushrooms. We paired it with a wonderful Cab - "Educated Guess" by Napa's Roots Run Deep. For a complete amateur like me, cooking  for my girl, it was amazingly delicious!!

I've never had or fixed brussel sprouts so this was a test!  Excellent!  I really had no idea how to clean them so washed & cut off the stem.  not sure if that's correct.  I added a few sprinkles of red pepper flakes as another reviewer mentioned.

Great flavor, but I got SUPER mushy brussel sprouts.  I'm sure I did something wrong.  For one, I had to add a lot of extra butter because it kept cooking out.  I think I'll stick with roasting going forward.

This was an absolute hit at our house on Christmas Eve. My fiance, 2 boys under the age of 10, my mom and my brother loved it. No leftovers! How many kids devour brussels sprouts. We couldn't put the parmesan on due to an allergy in the house (though some of us added it later), and we used non dairy butter. It was delicious. I'll definitely make this again!

This recipe must be for GIGANTIC brussels sprouts.  I used small-medium ones and quite a few more fit in the pan (and were needed to serve 2).  Cooking time took longer on medium heat (high enough to brown and crisp the outsides) and could have still used a few minutes to be softer all the way through.  First batch I was careful to place cut-side down and flip, second batch I just threw in the pan and they turned out the same (and much easier).

These came out delicious.  I sliced the Brussels sprouts in 3 or 4 pieces and left out the last Tbs of butter.  I added about 1/4 cup panko breadcrumbs after the first 5 minutes.   It was tough to let  them cook for 5 or 6 minutes without turning them, but it was worth it.  They browned up nicely and got a little crispy crunch to them.  Highly recommended!!

Well I didn't have fresh garlic because I'm unpacking from a move, so I used some pre-crushed garlic. But somehow the flavors didn't mesh well for me. Fresh garlic probably would have been better, but I didn't get enough out of this attempt to try again. The consistency of the Brussels sprouts was good though, liked that.

Absolutely delicious! I never thought about adding a strong cheese like parmesan to brussel sprouts and am so happy I tried this recipe. It is so easy but tastes like a lot of effort went into it. Next time I may add a dash of basalmic vinegar just because I really like that taste on the sprouts as well. Thank you for this easy and healthy recipe!

I used the basics of this recipe (I omitted the parmesan since I was out of it) but keeping to the cooking times yield crunchy, hard brussel sprouts. I prefer mine much softer so I cooked them long and added water to steam them a bit. Much better!

Not a big fan of Brussels sprouts but loved this recipe.  Took the microwave option to soften before I fried the sprouts.Will also add the red pepper as suggested next go around.

These were delicious! The only change we made was to add a little bacon grease to the pan. They turned out so yummy. We will definitely be making them again.  Next time we will fry up a piece of bacon and crumble that into the pan along with the Brussels sprouts.

Used this recipe for my Easter dinner today and yes it was very good.  I browned them in my cast iron skillet with garlic and green onions. However they weren't cooked through.  what I did was put them in a casserole dish with Parmesan cheese sprinkled throughout.  I like the idea of the Asiago Cheese too.  Then in the oven to bake at 350 until done, this is some good stuff.  Will make this again.

This was quite good. I did what another reviewer said and used a bag of frozen Brussel sprouts. I cooked them for 3 minutes (bag said 4-5) and they were perfect, not too hot to cut and not too soft. I cut about half of them based on another reviewers comments about them falling apart due to cutting, I didn't find this to be the case but wanted to try both ways. I would cut them all next time. I used probably 1-2 tbsp of butter total and added a bit of EVOO at the beginning. I also added about 1/4 cup of bacon (real bits) at the beginning, I believe this is what caused my husband and 11 yr old, who both groaned 'ew Brussel sprouts' when they sat down, to both ask for seconds, I converted them!!! :) only sprinkled a bit of parm on at the end, it was enough for us.

Try adding a little lemon juice for a little zip. Steam rather than fry and use olive oil and raw grated garlic and parmesan.

More than delicious...... The only thing wrong with this recipe is saying to use 6 brussel sprouts for 2 people.  I used 18 for the  2 of us and it wasn't enough!!!  I could not stop eating them before dinner, during dinner and after dinner.  So easy to make and can't wait to make it again.

I've said it before, cooking green leaf vegetables without water makes them taste so different. It makes them sweeter and allows you to taste something you don't get with watered down boiled vege's

This recipe is fantastic.  Even if someone doesn't like brussels sprouts, I'm pretty sure they would love these.  It may have a little too much butter for some people, but in the end it is so worth it!  We grew brussels sprouts one year and anyone who has grown these knows how many you can end up with.  I made these once a week, and brought them to holiday parties.  Needless to say they were a success each time!

easy way to make brussel sprouts more interesting! i used less butter and added pine nuts halfway through, plus a dash of cayenne pepper at the end.

This was really easy, but yummy. Even my toddler ate his brussel sprouts. I used frozen brussel sprouts instead of fresh. I cooked them per the microwave directions, and then I followed the above recipe with a slight decrease in cooking time. They still turned out great.

I'm not a brussel sprouts fan, but made these and they were an instant hit. I didn't have garlic cloves so I used granulated, and also added cooked/crumbled bacon for the last 3 minutes. Probably 4 stars without the bacon, but bacon always makes things better.

Just yesterday I found some beautiful fresh sprouts at my local market --- for 99c a pound (crazy inexpensive!)  I brought them home and immediately cleaned them and froze them in packets of 10 each.
This morning I found this recipe and I immediately steam-microwaved one of the packages of frozen veggies with about 3T. water for about 3 minutes, allowed them to cool a bit, halved them and continued with the recipe using my covered stir-fry pan.  I also added about 1T. red pepper flakes as many suggested.  HEAVENLY!!
Thank you so much for your contribution to a great and healthy vegetable dish.

The only problem I have is the amount of fat (butter) in this recipe.  So I decided that it is so good that I would cut back in the other dishes served at the meal.

I gave this a 5 star for brussel sprouts seperate from my other ratings. This veggie has to be one you like and if you do I would rate this a 5 as it works with well with it. If you dont like the taste of BS then forget it. Only changes I made was a drizzle of olive oil with the butter and then I drizzled a little over them when done.

I wish I could give this recipe 10 stars!! I doubled  the recipe to 4 servings, knowing one of the boys would not eat them.  I could of easily made it for 8 servings and it'd still be gone!!  They were both asking for more!!  Super easy and great taste!  I'm going to try it next using my stirfry plate on the grill.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Brussels Sprouts....who knew my kids would not only eat them but devour them.  Very simple and very tasty.  Mostly Paleo-friendly.  Nothing in the pan for tomorrow's leftovers.  Thanks for sharing.
