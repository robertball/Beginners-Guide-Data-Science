This salad was very good.It is a very unique salad.I liked  all the flavor of the dressing,with the garlic,lemon and sweetness of the maple syrup(100% pure)The cranberries are also a nice touch.I used chopped almonds instead of pecans.I would make this again when I'm looking for a salad thats a little out of the ordinary.This salad tastes much better when the dressing soaks into it overnight.Also,double the dressing if you like alot of dressing.

This was good - next time I'll reduce the amount of balsamic vinegar, it seemed to overpower the salad.  But overall, it's a refreshing, different dish!

I absolutely love this salad. It is a great side dish for poultry. And if you are entertaining it's served at room temperature so more room for the oven and stove!

I prefer fresh ingredients rather than packaged, so I chopped my own broccoli/slaw. Based on another review, I reduced the Balsamic Vinegar by half. I toasted the pecans for my flavor. Yummy! Thanks for sharing.

This slaw was very good and very well received by everyone at Christmas dinner. I had read the previous reviews and made the recommended tweaks. First, I made this slaw the day before and that really brings out the flavor. The broccoli slaw remained crisp and did not get soggy. It also made it so easy for Christmas dinner because that was one less dish that had to be cooked or prepped. Secondly, I used white balsamic vinegar so it would not turn brown.  I reduced the oil from 1/2 cup to 1/4 cup because other reviewers had said it was too oily. I used olive oil instead of canola oil because i thought it would taste better in this dish. I increased the maple syrup (use the real stuff only) from 1 teaspoon to 1 tablespoon to increase the sweetness that other reviewers said it lacked. Also I used honey roasted pecans and almonds which also added a little sweetness as well as crunch.  With the tweaks, it tasted great. Making it a day ahead really made it very easy as well. I recommend giving this recipe a try.  Next time I might add a little crumbled blue cheese or feta.  I think either of those would taste great with these ingredients.

This was good, but it wasn't quite as flavorful as I expected. The dressing was very unique. I chopped my own broccoli slaw, and I used olive oil. I added 1/4 cup chopped hazelnuts. The lemon zest really stood out in this--maybe a bit too much for my taste. I think this could use some fresh herbs; tarragon might work well. Plus, I would increase the green onion (and I'm not even a fan of onion). I'll probably try this again with those tweaks.

I thought this salad was a nice change and it maintained its crispness the next day as a left-over. I liked that as it is alway nice to have a few dishes that can be made the night before.

I used the full 2 tablespoons of balsamic vinegar, but cut the oil to 1/3 cup because I prefer less oily dressings.  It turned out great!

Wow! Great salad. I also tweaked for my preferences.  Increased sweet to 2 tblsp maple syrup (sugar-free)and used 1/2 cup fat-free mayo instead of oil.  Yum!

I was buying something like this at the deli - so much more inexpensive to make myself.

A nice,simple change from the "usual" salads. The texture of the packaged broccoli slaw was a delightful suprise,very crunchy.  As another suggested,more sweet,I used 2 t maple syrup. Perfectly balanced flavor and textures.

I found this looking for a vegan broccoli salad. It has become my whole families favorite! I double the dressing. I use olive oil, pomegranate seeds when in season, & I chop my own broccoli. It is nice to have a non-mayo broccoli salad that my vegan son in law can eat that everyone loves!

I try not to change recipes much so as to try what the poster shared but for this, I did cut down on the oil to 1/4 cup. Just couldn't justify that many fat calories :) Was very tasty. I used unsweetened fresh cranberries (didn't have dried ones) and we loved the tart overall flavor of the salad.

I'm giving this a 4 because I thought it was alright, but my husband LOVED it. I prefer my broccoli salad creamy but he really enjoyed the tanginess. As a bonus it was really easy to make.

Great way to eat broccoli.  I took other reviewers suggestions and doubled the syrup (I used sugar free) and the sweetness was just right for us.  The slaw in the store had carrots which I am avoiding right now, so I made my own by shredding 1 lb of broccoli in my food processor - really nice, everyone enjoyed it!!

Presentation on this salad is terrific, but the taste is only so-so.  It was too tart/sour and I think that's b/c of the balsamic (as noted by other reviewers).  I do like the cranberry-broccoli-nut combo, but the dressing needs some tweaking.

I am one who does not eat broccoli stems and branches (just the florets).  I tried this and it was unbelievable.  While I don't like homemade oil dressings as I think they are usually to oily, I used one half cup of a balsamic vinaigrette to which I added 1 tsp. of Dijon mustard and 1 tsp. of maple syrup which turned out great.  Husband and I could not get enough of this salad.  I used diced onion instead of green onions also.  As suggested I added a little shredded mozzarella but didn't think it added anything.

This has become a go to salad in my house, especially during the warmer months. The only change I made is using white balsamic vinegar as others suggested.

Very good, but I took another reviewer's suggestion; I used lower fat mayo in place of the oil.  I used chives instead of green onion, because I had it on hand.  By mistake I used 1 tblspoon of maple syrup, so mine may have been a bit sweeter.  Cranberries really add to flavor

This was excellent!  I did make one change that I think made a big difference and that was to use white balsamic vinegar, which has a lighter flavor and also doesn't change the color of the veggies so much.  I also used less oil - maybe a scant 1/3 cup of grapeseed oil - and I toasted the pecans.  I thought the flavors in the dressing complimented eachother superbly! I use lemon, dijon and balsamic together a lot in dressings, and the maple syrup gave it a different richness.  I use Trader Joe's Dijon Mustard - my favorite!

Very good salad. Next time I would probably reduce the oil to 1/3 c. This is a recipe that really could be played with... I liked the tarragon suggestion from another reviewer. My son suggested sunflower seeds which sounded good too. I'd probably increase the amount of dried cranberries next time just because I love 'em!

Yummy - with few tweaks. It needed more "sweet" so I doubled the cranberries and added a some raspberry vinegar I had. I also added a little sugar. I'm usually not a sweet. The next day it was even better.

09.17.16 ~ A nice change on a broccoli salad.  The dressing is totally different than a creamy based dressing.  We liked the change.  I made the dressing exactly as written and thought it went well with the broccoli and dried cranberries.  I went to get pecans from the freezer and all I could find were sliced almonds.  So in the salad they went.  Served this with all AR recipes - 'Pineapple Sticky Ribs', homemade rolls, ' Buttery New Potatoes with Leeks and Parsley' and 'Rhubarb Raspberry Crunch' for dessert.  Dinner was fantastic!  Thanks JMS5, for your recipe.

This was good.  Only change I made was reducing the balsamic a little bit, and adding a bit of lemon juice to sub for the lemon zest because I forgot to get a lemon at the store.  Next time I make it I will make more dressing, maybe a recipe and a half.  I enjoyed a salad that wasn't mayonnaise based, or had ramen noodles.  It is very pretty, easy to make and a nice change.  I tossed a 3 oz can of tuna in mine for myself for dinner as I didn't want what I made for hubby and the kids.  This would be a nice light lunch, too.  Thanks for sharing!

Finally a recipe for broccoli salad without mayo! I used clementine zest, some of the juice, no maple syrup, added a little brown sugar in addition to the fresh orange juice. I did not have a coleslaw mix, so I used grated carrots, broccoli, a little chopped onion, and a little amount of celery for crunch. I also substituted cashews (what I had on hand), and topped with hemp seeds for added flavor and healthiness. Even my kids liked it, This was awesome! It also kept in the fridge fresh for a day before it started becoming a little soggy.

I made this as a side dish for guests & they LOVED it!  I substituted 1 Tbsp. lemon juice for the lemon zest, used 1/3 cup canola oil, &, just before serving, added 1/2 cup of chopped pecans.  The 2nd time I made this, I used white balsamic vinegar so that the salad didn't turn brown.

The lemon zest is completely out-of-place in this recipe.  It was a little heavy on the mustard for me personally, but I don't like mustard.  I also probably used less oil.  Toast the pecans first to bring out their flavor, and add more maple syrup.  The maple-balsamic combination was a good idea, but by the time I got done adjusting the ingredients to my taste, the proportions were very different from the original recipe.
