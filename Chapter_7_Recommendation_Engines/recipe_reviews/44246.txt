This cheese ball is wonderful!  It has become an annual addition to my Christmas Eve appetizers.  It is extremely simple, beautiful to look at, and wonderfully tasty - I serve it with assorted bagel chips.

Just what I was kinda looking for. Simple but very tasty. I didn't have garlic powder. Used 4 cloves of smashed roasted garlic. Let it rest overnight. Take out of fridge at least 1/2 hour before serving.   ---thank you for recipe

For those who think it's too salty, you may want to use unsalted butter. Just a thought.

I thought it was very good, but extremely salty.  My family apparently loves salt, though, because everyone raved!!  I'd make it again, maybe with less olives and garlic.

I liked this ok, but evidently my guests did not because hardly anyone ate it.  I think I would make it again and leave out the garlic powder.

I made this for christmas I thought it was pretty good. My family didn't seem to like it too much. I think I would make it again for another party.

This is a great cheese ball and very easy to make. After mixing ingredients together, it was a little too soft to roll into a ball. I just put it in the fridge for about an hour and it was perfect to work with. I rolled mine in pecans. Everyone just loved this recipe. Next time I am going to try using Italian seasoned olives. Great recipe for any get-together.

I really like this- I added a cup of cheddar cheese but the recipe as is is really good also.  And with the pimento stuffed olives it is festive for Christmas!  Good green and red coloring in the middle of this cheese ball!

If the olives are rinsed off then dried it should not be as salty as some have complained about. Also make sure to use garlic powder and not garlic salt.

I'm an olive lover, but the olive flavor in this cheese ball was just overpowering.

I made this for my friend's baby shower (she has been craving olives like crazy during her pregnancy). Not only was it super easy to make (I used pre-chopped olives in a jar) but she loved it and told me the whole next week she was craving more of this. Great easy party food- highly recommend!

I made this for Christmas Eve and everyone loved it. I did omit the garlic tho, but it was still very tasty. I love the butter in it, it makes it so smooth and creamy. I didn't roll it into a ball, just put it in a nice dish. Leave it at room temperature for awhile so it is spreadable.

Great recipe, although it was waaaay too garlicky with the 1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder (and I love garlic!).   I changed it to 1/2 tsp and it was perfect.

This was very good. I used unsalted butter in the amount the recipe called for. However, I think next time I will use slightly less butter than cream cheese so that the cream cheese flavor is more pronounced. (Nothing wrong with recipe as written, just personal taste preference). It was a big hit at get together. Thank you for the recipe.

This was so easy and tasty.  I had a large jar of olives so I measured out 3/4 c of them and minced them.  It tasted great. It looked like there were not enough olives in the cream cheese, next time I put in 1 cup (unminced).  Too many olives...very salty.  It was great anyway, I found that the butter was harder at room temperature than the cream cheese(I keep house temp at 62), so I put the stick(in wrapper) on top of the stove for a few minutes turned it a few times(I had just finished baking cookies) so it would be a little softer from the warmth of the oven.  It softened just enough.

Easy to make, delicious appetizer can be made ahead of time! I used sliced almonds instead of chopped walnuts which are very expensive. Will differently make it again!
