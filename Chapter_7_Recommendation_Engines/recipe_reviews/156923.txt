WE LOVED THIS RECIPE! Salt would make this recipe perfect (but lack of salt isn't enough to demote it to 4 stars). Salt helps to compliment the sweetness. Salt your chicken before marinating in the coconut milk. Add a little salt to the breadcrumb mixture. The ginger snaps add a wonderful flavor and this recipe would be lacking without them (since the ginger snaps have a nice spiced and sweet flavor). THe baking method is great, just coat the pan with coconut milk (don't drench the chicken) and it will be perfect. Don't forget the pats of butter ontop of the chicken while cooking:). We loved this N*R recipe...do try!

This was creative, unusual, fun to make but in the end it wasn't my favorite.  I think the basic idea of coconut and ginger is great but this was much too sweet for my family's taste.  I used unsweetened coconut but the gingersnaps is where all the sugar came from.  I will try this recipe again without the cookies and add a little gorund ginger to the breading mix.

This was a great recipe. I added a little salt and cayenne to it for a kick. So tasty! I also marinated my chicken overnight, made it super moist and tender. Thanks!

We thought this was really good.  After Hubby wrapped his head around the idea that it was chicken *AND* coconut together in the same recipe he thought it was really good and ate two pieces.  The only change I made was salting the chicken before marinating it in the coconut milk.  This is a good recipe if you are looking for a "different" way to have chicken!  N*R

This was fast, easy, and tasty.   Be sure to just barely coat the bottom of the baking dish with the coconut milk, otherwise it will make the bread crumbs very soggy.   I substituted light coconut milk, to cut down on the fat, without impairing the flavor.

Mmmmm! I love coconut but hate any kind of spiced cookies so I just added some ginger to the bread crumb mixture as another review mentioned (and salt as suggested). Because of my love for coconut I also added a drop of coconut extract and a little left over coconut milk to the egg. Wasnt too coconut-ie just right :) I also used 3 chicken breast since I didnt have tenders and baked at 350 for 1hr (just because thats how I always bake chicken breast), mine was not soggy at all. I only added enough milk to coat the bottom of the pan so idk why everyone is getting soggy bottoms.
My husband loved it too! We will have it again :)

delicious. I salted my chicken before. don't forget to use the hard type of ginger snaps...no soft ginger cookies. So good. The bad thing about sweet dishes or salty dishes, everyone has different tastes...this was to our liking very much!

The recipe was easy to make but not a family favorite.  Made it for the coconut lovers when the coconut haters were out of town.  Did not have the gingersnaps so I crushed some graham crackers and added a little ginger to the mix. We thought this was a little sweet for a main dish.  It was ok, just not great.  N*R

I really like this recipe, although I will caution you about the shredded coconut. Be sure to use UNsweetened coconut; otherwise it may be too sweet for you. My gingersnaps (I used Shasha Co.'s, which are not really sweet) provided enough sweetness already. I added extra ginger to the mix for more ginger taste and used more breadcrumbs in place of some of the gingersnaps. I also left out the butter. Thanks, Katz! :)

Both my bf and I liked this.  I didn't have a clue what 1 1/2 lbs of my Costco chicken was, so I just used 4 chicken breasts.  It took about 1/2 the can of coconut milk to cover them, so I used the other 1/2 in the pan when baking.  It is a bit sweet--probably from the gingersnaps and the coconut milk--so I don't know that I'd use the gingersnaps again but maybe just use bread crumbs and put in ginger with them.  I also think the coconut milk should go in the pan before the chicken, not after.  Since we liked it, it's worth trying again with a few tweaks.  Thanks for the recipe.

It was okay...I followed the recipe exactly. It was edible, but, it was too sweet, soggy, and it was hard getting passed the ginger snaps.
I will try the receipe again with a few changes...
1. Omit coconut milk from baking dish and add more butter or chicken stock to keep it moist.
2. Decrease number of ginger snaps used and increase bread crumbs.
3. Add additional coconut flakes the last 10 min to toast.  

I will update my review and let you know how the changes went.

Very easy and delicious! Only advice would be to make sure that the coconut/ginger snap mixture doesn't get too soggy towards the end. It get's really hard to get it to stick after a while. But overall, it was fantastic. So sweet.

Very good recipe.  I used panko instead of plain breadcrumbs, and used a few less gingerthins.  Great flavor, not too sweet, but could have used a little something else, i just can't put my finger on it...

This was a hit at my house! I was told it was the best meal my friend had in months! I used panko crumbs insead of the bread crumbs and more of the coconut milk to let in marinade in (about 4hrs) it was so so yummy!! I will be making it again for sure!

I'm not sure if I will make this again.  The bottoms of the chicken were soggy.  If I do try the recipe again, I will omit the coconut from the baking pan.

Not a whole lot of flavor.  It tastes like it's missing something, but you can't add salt with all of the sweetness going on.  Due to the lack of flavor and the idea of cookies in a dinner recipe, my picky daughter loved it, but the adults are not eager to make it again.

I made this for a fast dinner. I used regular milk and butter salt and pepper  because I didn’t have coconut milk. I used cracker crumbs because I didn’t have bread crumbs.   I mixed the coconut, ginger snaps and macadamia nuts (and a little bit of cinnamon sugar)  in a food processor. (It made a great topping for gingerbread muffins if you have extra) I know I changed a lot of it but, it turned out great.

It was absolutely delicious. My whole family loved it. I marinated the chicken in the coconut milk for 1 1/2 days. Next time I think I'll put 1/2 c of coconut shreds.

I made this according to the instructions, except for adding the pieces of butter, which I forgot to do. It was still really good! I did not think it was too sweet as other reviews have mentioned, although I do think I will try salting the chicken next time. This was enjoyed and complimented by all.

Really good! I marinated the chicken in coconut milk for 5 hrs and it was so moist and tender. The crushed gingersnaps and coconut really give it a great taste.

This was a pretty good recipe. Made exactly as written and we were all pleased with the result. One tip: be sure to purchase 'crisp' gingersnaps and not soft ones. Thanks, Katz!

We had a small gathering of friends on this past Sat. when my husband asked me what we were having, he was a bit disappointed.  However, after he tasted this chicken, he told me it was the best chicken he had ever had.  And to prove this point, Tim doesn't like leftovers, but he has had this for diner the last three nights, as well as on Saturday.  It was a definite hit. Thank you, and it is okay to try new recipes when company comes, just pay attention to what you are doing!

Pretty good, chicken was really tender from soaking in milk.  Might add more coconut next time.  Was also not really crispy like I was expecting, but if I don't pour the extra coconut milk in the baking dish, it might help.  Made some mac and cheese and green beans to go with it.

This was an easy recipe and very tasty.  I left out the butter due to dairy allergy in the family.  Coconut taste came through well, but the ginger taste was very mild.  Next time I'll add in ground ginger to both the coconut milk for the pre-chilling and the breadcrumb mixture.  A repeat!

I was disappointed in this recipe. There was no taste of coconut.

A new idea that's really delicious. Although I think that the chicken might need some more spices.

I made this recipe last night for dinner and it was WONDERFUL!!  I made it just as the recipe said and we thought it was great.  So easy to fix and will sure fix it again and again.

Something different for those who like variety... a bit on the sweet side though.
