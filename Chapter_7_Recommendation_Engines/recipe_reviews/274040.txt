This dish was so amazing! After my family tried it, they started beging me to keep making more. This dish is truly a delight to make.

For those complaining about the slaw, um, leave it off.  I topped ours with the traditional pickles and onions and they were FABULOUS!!  Chef John does it again.  I'm actually not a huge fan of the McRib, but this is on a whole other level than the ground up mystery meat McDonald's serves.  If you like ribs, these are a can't miss!

No pickles? Must have pickles to be a copycat. Also, the original doesn’t have slaw; just onions, pickles, and sauce. I used this recipe as a base, omitted slaw, and added caramelized onions and pickle chips. Served on  Bolillos (Mexican rolls) 
It was delish! Next time, I’ll cook the meat in the IP.

First off, I’m a McRib die hard fan, so this recipe was absolutely love at first sight. I have made this twice now with lovely Constanza rolls and each and every time I’m in heaven. As an bonus I bought Chef John’s SFQ BBQ sauce to try to get it as close to the intended recipe and I think it may be the best BBQ sauce I’ve ever had in my life. Anyways, this recipe is such a treat and besides the two required cooking sessions, it’s really not that much effort.

The sandwich was amazing. You definitely have to have some homemade coleslaw with it. Very easy to make very affordable if you're on a budget. I recommend it.

Too much salt. Even cut it in half. Will make again. Very good is spite of salt.

Not sure if the amount of salt for the run was a typo, but the meat turned out to be VERY salty. Disappointing.

I want to know where I can get Michelle’s SFQ barbecue sauce? I want to try it...I live in Illinois(yeah I know!) wondering if any stores this way carries it! I have not made this recipe but I have made many of your other recipes...they all turned out amazing! Thank you for sharing! I am giving you 5 stars because all the recipes I have tried were 5 star as I’m sure this one will be!

I cheated when I made it. I bought the ready made riblets frozen  2 packages of 6 in a package., I cooked according to directions, drained out the sauce it came with and replaced it with better bbq sauce, I used Hawaiian buns and added the slivers of onion & thin pickles just like how the McRib is made and it only cost about $8.00 total to feed my family of four..
