I had this for lunch because I am eating low-carb to lose weight. My steak was already grilled from the night before. I didn't have Caesar salad dressing and wondered what Light Ranch and a little bit of Heinz 57 would taste like mixed up and it was very yummy (and a little spicy if you use too much 57). Great 'meal' salad!

Sorry Marzetti, I used home made salad dressing...but the salad was good! I think the key to this though is using good quality steak....I used filet mingon.

This was sooooo good. I used a slightly different kind of steak and pan fried it and it was very delicious.
