I used whole wheat flour instead of white, and honey in place of the sugar.  This is some of the best bread we've ever had!

I followed this recipe with slight adjustments to the seasonings.  I used chives instead of the onion which gave great color and softer flavor.  It was a huge success and everyone loved it!

I made this for dinner tonight with a Beef Stew. I made a few minor alterations for high altitude because I live in Denver. High altitude changes at the bottom of the post for anyone interested.  Not sure what the issue was with the poster having trouble with water/milk temp. I used hot tap water, nuked about 20 seconds and nuked cold from the fridge milk for 45 seconds. Temps were perfect and I used a mixing bowl that I had pre-heated with hot tap water. My kitchen is a little cold today because outside temp is about 5 degrees right now.  The only alteration I made not associated with altitude was to make one with the topping as written in the recipe and used the 2nd one for cinnamon and sugar (my family has a big sweet tooth :)). Just melted some butter and spread on top of the 2nd loaf, then sprinkled with 1/3 cup sugar and about a teaspoon or so of Cinnamon.   This turned into a great bread to go with the soup and a yummy desert as well.  Thanks for sharing!  High Altitude changes (I live at about 6,000 feet): Reduced the yeast by 1/8 tsp. Increased flour by 2 TBS and increase water/milk by 1 TBS each. Also to compensate for altitude I increased oven temp by 15 degrees and decreased cooking time by 5 minutes.

Yum. I made several alterations (used half rye flour, muenster cheese, reduced the amount of melted butter for the top) and it was quite tasty as a flat dipping bread for chicken tikka. Will definitely make again.

I only made the bread portion of this recipe (followed it exactly) and it turned out great.  Thank you Joan!

I liked the bread although i did not worry about the temprature of the milk just as long as it was warm.  And i used a 12 grain flour which made it a heavier bread.
