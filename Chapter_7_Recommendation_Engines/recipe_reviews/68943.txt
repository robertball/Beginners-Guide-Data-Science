I always dis-like people who "massacre" recipes and then rate them so low (well duh! It's not like you're some awesome well known chef!), so having said that, I made it per the instructions and it's good (4 stars), but to make it 5 stars, here are my suggestions:  Mix 2 tsp each garlic powder and oregano w/ 1 tsp crushed rosemary - rub this onto the pork chops, and do a quick sear in the oil. Use a GOOD brand of pasta sauce (ever hear the theory "buy cheap, get cheap"...well the same holds true in cooking!)  I recommend Bertolli Fire roasted tomato sauce w/ cabernet sauvignon!  Then to give the dish more depth, don't stick to regular diced tomatoes, I suggest Glen Muir fire roasted diced tomatoes.  Instead of a normal bell pepper, I chose to go gourmet and bought fire-roasted red bell peppers...it was Absolutely phenomenal!  Also, instead of your regular white mushrooms, swap those for the baby ports - it will give some rustic heartiness to this dish.   Even though this dish has dry white wine, the flavours meld SO nicely!  It's a fantastic dish!  Oh, and make sure you are using fresh mozzarella, not that brick stuff!

DELICIOUS!  I was a little hesitant to try this, as I lived in Italy for a short time and hold my Italian food to a very high standard.  I was very pleased with the turn out.  It would be better with homemade pasta sauce, instead of using sauce from a jar.  But with the added veggies and spices, the sauce was great.  One major change I did was I only cooked this for 4 hours.  I made sure the pork was done.  If I had cooked it for the full time, the meat would have turned out too tough and not tender at all.

This was delicious.  Only problem was the chops came out so tender, they were falling apart in pieces and I couldn't lift out whole ones.  Also, this makes A LOT of sauce so either add more chops or do like I did which was to serve spaghetti noodles on the side.  I still have a lot of sauce left over.  Next time, I will probably 1/2 the sauce.  Thanks, Teresa!

I've made this recipe a few times, my daughter LOVES it! The first time I made it exactly as written, the second time I just threw all the ingredients together in the slow cooker.  The result is the same.  The third time I used chicken instead of pork, which I think tastes much better.  The only problem I have had with the recipe is that I find the sauce too liquidy, and I have to thicken it with cornstarch. Not a big deal.  A lot of sauce is made so I double the meat and freeze leftovers, they reheat well.  This recipe is worth making for a busy mom and kids love it.  Thank you for sharing!!!

People are right about the pork being dry but it's not the recipe's fault.  Pigs are bred for leanness now, and when you braise meat, what makes it tender is the fat and connective tissue turning to gelatin from the low, slow, moist heat.  Pork chops these days just won't cut it because they're usually too lean.  (It has nothing to do with searing the meat preventing liquid from getting inside.)  You will be better off cutting up the fattest, most full-of-connective-tissue cut-- like a shoulder arm picnic or Boston blade roast-- or using chicken thighs which are higher in fat and will stay moister longer.  I would definitely cook it less than 8 hours too!!!

4 1/2 stars.  used frozen chops (did not brown), and poured all ingredients over them in the slow cooker (without browning the ingredients).  cut back on the sauce; added some chicken stock; and these turned out great -- tender & flavorful.  very easy, i will definetly make again (probably with chicken).

I didn't brown the pork before putting in the slow cooker and they cooked perfect.  The dish was wonderful served over rice.

I grew up in a predominately Italian neighborhood; where three generations in the home; was the norm.  The grandparents were usually from the “Old Country.”  The smells of food cooking all day long filled the air.  This recipe is reminiscent of those days.  Awesome flavor!  I used fresh Roma tomatoes instead of canned.  The Pork was cheap; country style ribs on sale for $169 per pound and it cooked up fork tender.  There is a flavor that only comes from slow cooking meat in a tomato sauce.  This recipe gets my five star stamp of approval.

The sauce was great!  I didn't have fresh mushrooms so used canned (drained) and skipped the wine.  (Had that *with* dinner!)  I didn't like the pork chops; I'd use chicken thighs next time and cut back on the cooking time by an hour.  I used thick cut chops and browned them first.  I think the browning seared the outside preventing liquid from penetrating the meat as the chops were dry.  So, I shredded the pork and served it over rice and it went over well with the family.

I would probably just throw it all in the pot without precooking anything!

We all loved this.  I used chicken (leg quarters with bones and thighs without) and the meat fell off the bone when I took it out.  So I ended up stirring it all together into a kind of sauce and putting the whole thing over pasta.  My kids (5 and 2) devoured it.  And it did make a ton!  I have two batches in the freezer for other nights.  Yay!

This is a delicious recipe! I read all the reviews and made a few adjustments, came out wonderful. I used 8 boneless pork loin chops. I don't see why you would use only 4 since this makes so much sauce. I sprinkled my chops with Emeril's Essence and pepper and browned them in the oil. Then , I put them in my crock pot and browned the onions , adding in about 6 cloves of minced garlic after the onions were tender. Then added in the green pepper, mushrooms and I also added a chopped zucchini and a red bell pepper too.I chopped my onion and bell peppers as a personal preference to the sliced. I used Prego for my pasta sauce and only used 1 (14 1/2 ounce) can of fire roasted diced tomatoes. I only used 1/4 cup of wine and it was Burgundy , not white. In addition to the seasonings, I added 1 teaspoon salt, a pinch of oregano, some sugar, crushed red pepper flakes and Worcestershire sauce. To thicken it up, a couple tablespoons of tomato paste works great. Also added a bay leaf. Cooked on high for the first hour and then on low for 3-4 more hours. No way does this need 7-8 hours. Served it with thin spaghetti and garlic bread. Sprinkled it with shredded mozzarella  fresh grated Parmesan, and fresh minced parsley. Adding fresh minced parsley into the sauce the last hour or so of cooking time is a good idea too. Next time I'd like to try the pork loin with the bone to see if it's even more flavorful. It was so delicious this time though, I will be making this often. Thank you!

As written, the recipe is bland and watery. It needs salt, at a minimum (I can't believe none is called for!), and I'd be careful what kind of pork chop I used in the recipe. Mine came out dry and tough--which I should have expected, frankly, from long cooking of lean meat in an acidic sauce. Another reviewer is totally correct in suggesting the use of a tougher, fattier cut.   Other changes I'd recommend would be using flour when browning the chops to help thicken the sauce, and carefully draining the tomatoes. I used dried mushrooms which I thought would help soak up the liquid, but it still was more like soup than sauce. Perhaps next time I'd also leave the cover off the cooker for the last hour or so.

This is a nice, different recipe for pork.  I dredged my pork chops (boneless) in Italian bread crumbs before browning.  We love the texture of the diced tomatoes (I added those later in the cooking time).  Thanks for the recipe!

I wasn't too sure about this recipe, especially made with pork but surprisingly enough... it was delicious! I didn't want to stray away from the original recipe since it was my first time making it & I was already skeptical about it. I seared the pork very quickly in a frying pan, just put it on there & took it right off, amazingly the pork was not dry at all which is one of the things I was worried about. I calculated for 6 people and I never ended up using all that sauce nor the 2 cans of diced tomatoes, it would have been way too watery, almost "soupy." I only cooked it about 6 hours on high and that was more than enough time, I can't imagine cooking it 8+ hours! I think it would have tasted better with chicken but it was a nice change with the pork as well. Hope this helps!

What a delicious dish! I've made this with chicken before, but using pork had never crossed my mind... silly me! I left out the mushrooms, because I don't eat them, but followed the rest of the recipe exactly. It was amazing! Thanks for this fantastic twist on cacciatore.

This recipe is so easy and as it cooks throughout the day the smell is fantastic!  I didn't brown the pork or veggies, I just threw all the ingredients on top of the pork chops in the cooker and it turned out AWESOME!

I will begin my review with a quote from my UPS driver who delivered a package to the door, just as I put the last spice into the sauce.  He said, “What is that cooking?  It smells YUUUM YUUUUM!”  I could just end it there but I will go ahead and share some of my experience.  Since I was going to be home and my meat was frozen, I decided that starting dinner could wait until later, and then I could brown the meat, I could brown the veggies, I could add the sauce, I could add the meat, and simmer on the stove for a few hours, all in the one same pan.   I know the purpose is probably suppose to be to let it cook together slowly all day and not worry about it, but I figured if I was going to dirty a pan to brown the stuff, I would just finish cooking it in the same pan.  There was a lot of sauce but this is a positive thing since I served it with spaghetti noodles.  This was certainly delicious and I sure wouldn’t contradict a recipe from an Italian, but I do believe that for my own personal preference and the way that I like to cook (and clean up) if I use the slow cooker, I will just put it all in at one time.  And the slow cooker would be the way to go if I didn’t have time to tend to it on the stove but it did turn out ma’ velous on the stove.   I served it with a Romaine salad and some garlic bread made from some homemade bread I had baked yesterday (I know!  I was shocked too!)  Anyways, wonderful meal.  Thank you for sharing.

After reading some reviews, I cooked this as directed except I halved the pasta sauce and amount of diced tomatoes. I regret doing that! It does make a lot of sauce but that sauce is needed to stew all 4 of the chops. Next time I will use the whole recipe and make spaghetti another night because the sauce is delicious! Some people complained that it was a little watery, which is true but that doesn't bother me. Others suggest throwing everything in the crock pot without browning the chops or sauteing the vegetables. This would still taste good, but browning helps keep the meat from falling apart. Sauteing adds a level of taste to the vegetables that stewing alone will not get.

I made a few changes; hence, the four stars. I set up my slow cooker in layers.
Cook chops until lightly brown on each side. Cut off fat after they cook so it cooks in some of the fat juices. Put chops into slow cooker.
Turn heat down to med-low add sliced onions. cook until brown. i sliced up my peppers and mushrooms while they cooked. Add peppers and let the onion and peppers cook alone for a bit then add mushrooms. I added minced garlic while the mix cooked until tender on med- high heat. Add to slow cooker on top of chops.
Turn heat to med. I used a jar of Barilla Tuscan herb and a can of Tuttorossi crushed tomatoes. I didn't have any cans of diced tomatoes in the house so i diced a fresh tomato. I put the fresh tomato in first... added my 2 sauces...next time im using two cans of Tuttorossi i like to add my own seasonings and tomato paste.
I added a dash of italian seasoning, a dash of basil, a dash of garlic salt, and oregano to taste. I added 1/4 cup of reisling instead of white wine because i didn't have white wine and 1/8 of chicken broth. I let that simmer a while then added sauce to slow cooker.
I cooked on low for 7hrs.
Served with rotelle pasta and salad.
I suggest for mothers that want to make this fast make your sauce and mushroom mix the night before so sauce can simmer a bit.
i saw someone suggest just combining it all in the pot, but i think its a crime not to simmer your sauce. 
***USE A WOODEN SPOON*** ADD SEASONINGS TO SAUCE TO YOUR TASTE!

Excellent as written.  Lots of yummy sauce.  Soooo good on tomorrow's pasta.  As a personal preference, added a dash of worcestershire sauce and a bit of red pepper flakes for a little spice.

It's a nice recipe.  Like others, if I'm cooking it in the slow cooker, I just pile everything in and let it go, but for no more than five or six hours on low.  I use half the quantity of sauce for three pounds of pork, and I prefer the boneless country ribs, which I cut into serving pieces.  Canned mushrooms drianed work well for me - I use baby shitakes canned whole and keep them whole.  I prefer fresh herbs to dried, which is possible if they grow in your garden in season, but dry are fine otherwise.  Most of the time I don't have time to cook in the slow cooker, so I fry up everything first as the recipe says and put it in a baking dish or casserole and cook at 350 f for about a half hour.  No problem with the meat falling apart if you do this, and there is also no problem in getting it cooked tender.  I don't put any cheese on the pork, but it's nice to brown the top of the dish by sprinkling on some parmesan or romano and putting it back in the oven for five to ten minutes.  Three cheers for Italy!

Here are a couple suggestions that I have for this recipe:

1. Dry chop? Use a chop that has MORE fat content. This is what gives any cut of meat more moistness. You can also use boneless chicken thighs for this recipe to change it up a bit. They stay moist!

2.  Falling apart? Use a thicker cut chop than you would usually use.  These will hold up better to the long cooking time. You can also decrease the cooking time by about 2 hours. Your pork WILL be done.

3.  Not enough taste for you?  Add your own spin on things and make it YOUR recipe without bashing the original.

4.  No wine? Although that is an essential element, just use water and choose fire roasted tomatoes for more flavor. Water works fine if you are against using alcohol in your cooking.

5. Don't want to brown your chops?  Don't.  But, searing the pork will help it stay together and not fall apart as badly. 

I think the recipe is wonderful and I have it stored in my recipe box. I do add my own spin on things by using fire roasted tomatoes and sauce and port mushrooms. I've also made it with the chicken, which you can throw in frozen if you choose, and it is delicious. 

Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe makes a great meat sauce for pasta.  I followed it pretty closely, only making a few minor changes.  I omitted the olive oil, because it isn’t necessary in the crockpot.  I also used 6 cloves of garlic.  I used about 7 chopped vine tomatoes instead of the canned tomatoes so it wasn’t so watery.  As for the pork make sure you use a fatty cut otherwise it will be dry.  I also just threw the pork in the crockpot raw.  The second time I made this I used rabbit, and it was much better.

AMAZING!!! My super picky vegetable-hating step dad absolutely LOVED this recipe!... mind you I did reduce the amount of pepper and mushrooms and made sure everything was cooked the way he liked it. I couldn't keep my mom away from this either, despite her intolerance to all the spices used. Delicious! Will definitely make again! Thanks.

This is good.  I used pork chops with bones in them, but that is annoying.  Next time, I want to use boneless!

I made this dinner last night for my husband, children (their spouses and mother-in-law) and baby grandson and received rave reviews.  Instead of cooking for 7-8 hours though, I started late and cooked for only 4.5 on high.  The meat was very tender and very tasty.  Great Sunday afternoon dinner with homemade tomato spaghetti and a summer salad.  Dinner was a hugh success!  Thanks for the recipe!

Have made this twice - one as stated & one w/o the pasta sauce. We like it better w/o the pasta sauce & use 15oz can diced tomatoes. We thicken before serving over egg noodles. A small can of tomato sauce with basil & garlic could be added or small amount of tomato paste if desired, but we like it just with the can of Italian diced tomato. The second time making this I didn't bother browning anything because the pork chops were frozen.  I put everything in the slow cooker as is & let it cook.  On medium setting it takes 4 - 5 hours.

I really enjoyed this.  Rather than browning the chops, I just threw the pork chops (which were frozen) into the slow cooker with everything else.  I did have to leave out the white wine (didn't have any).  As others have noted, this does make a TON of sauce.  I used 5 pork chops and serve this over spaghetti and I still have sauce leftover.  Maybe I can freeze this?  In any event, this was an easy, tasty dish.

We loved this. I added a red pepper and some extra italian seasoning to the sauce. I only cooked mine for about 5 hours on low and the pork chops were falling apart. Next time I make this I'll cut the sauce in half because there was a ton left over.

Fantastic, comforting meal.  Very tasty.  The only thing I did differently was shred the pork before serving which is how I typically do chicken cacciatore.

As another reviewer mentioned, the sauce is a little thin, but can be thickened.  Other than that, a good recipe, though the next time I make it I will add some more seasonings, as it was a little bland for my taste.

I made this for last night! I did not brown the pork chops or pre cook the mushrooms & onions and just put them in the crock pot raw, and I did not have a bell pepper on hand.  OTHER THAN THAT I followed the recipe as written. It was outstanding! Both Hubby & I give this a 5 star rating! I did have one little mishap, while adding the Italian seasoning the top came off and 3/4 of the bottle went onto the raw mushrooms and onions! I had to take them out and wash them off before adding them back into the slow cooker. No damage was done! I served this on top of Spaghetti noodles with Fresh Italian bread on the side & a side salad. We did not touch our salad. The bread was perfect for soaking up the sauce on our plates! A big thank you to Sneakyteaky for sharing this with us!

Thank you so much for the idea. I used a 5lb boneless pork loin roast, seasoned heavily with salt, pepper, oregano, basil, garlic powder.  Sautéed 2 chopped small onions & lots of fresh garlic in a bit of olive oil.  Moved onion garlic to side and then browned my loin on all sides just to seal, placed in crock pot and poured onion and garlic over roast. Turned  to the lowest setting (10 hrs) cooked for 1 hr, then poured 2 jars of sauce and 2 cans of Italian style stewed tomatoes, 1 cup of "red"  cabernet sauvignon, and tons of spices (crushed red pepper, basil, oregano, sea salt, peper,etc..) WE LIKE SPICE! Let cook another hour, then I sautéed in a bit of olive oil, 2 sliced green/red peppers for just a few minutes, then added lots of sliced mushrooms (about 16 oz) until a "golden" brown (NOT TOO LONG!) and added to the crock pot. Gave it a mix and let cook for another maybe 3 hours. Came home, checked the temp of pork and it was done!  Took roast out and let rest.  I cut thin slices of roast(divine just like that) placed back in sauce while noodles cooked. Served over angel hair pasta with freshly ground Parmesan/Romano, salad and some crusty Italian bread. OMG this was DELISH! My family of 4 from 9-55 yrs LOVED this dish :) Will definitely make again! If no time, place everything in crock right from the start! 5 hrs for 5/6 lb ROAST perfect but less time would have worked as well. 7-8 hrs for 4 chops WAY TOOOOO LONG that's why I gave 4 stars. The chops would be so dry!

Soooo good. I will use this recipe on more than just pork. The leftovers just seemed to get better. Use a great pasta sauce, I am loyal to Barilla but if you use a ho-hum sauce the recipe will suffer. Thanks so much for sharing!

Just made this tonight with pork steak..  really great flavor.  Very easy.  I made it very close to the original.  added a little extra garlic..  browned the meat and veggies..  used fire roasted tomatoes and a small jar of pasta sauce.  Sounded a little strange but the reviews I read were so good that I tried it... execellent!!

This is a TERRIFIC meal with the pork melt-in-your-mouth tender, and the FLAVOR from the tomatoes, pepper, onion, mushroom, garlic, and seasonings exploding in your mouth!!  I used 2 drained, diced tomato cans instead of sauce and added a packet of dry, spaghetti seasonings with a cup of water, last time I made this recipe.  I served the pork and sauce on egg noodles which the family also enjoyed.

I thought that it was good, but I think that it was a little too watery/runny.  The sauce could have been a little thicker.  It was definitely good, and something different for dinner, but to be honest I don't think that I will make it again, at least not frequently.

This was really good, I didn't have any bell peppers as my husband doesn't care for them, but followed the recipe otherwise, using bone in chops, (found out why wanted boneless. LOL) Used baby portabellas and had no white wine so used white wine vinegar and cooking sherry. 1 other change, lots more garllic as we are garlic lovers. This was so delicious my husband even heated up the leftovers, which did freeze well, when he cooked dinner one night putting this on toast instead of pasta or rice. It was just as good on the toast. Will definetely make again.

I followed the recipe pretty much as given and we really liked this dish.  The pork chops were extremely tender and very flavorful...the one thing I did do was season the chops with pepper and granulated garlic prior to browning and my tomatoes had basil included in them but since the recipe called for basil I just cut back on the amount listed...I would have given the recipe 5 stars but the sauce was very thin, flavorful but thin, it needs to be thickened a bit so it sticks to the pasta...I will definitely be making this recipe again.

This was a hit! The only thing different I did wass two large pork steaks (because that's what I had). For the spaghetti sauce I used prego garlic and herb, and had it in the crock pot for 7 hrs. I will be doing this again, and I might try chicken in it to at some point.

This was a great recipe. Like a few others suggested, I did not cook my pork chops beforehand, and they turned out very tender. I used nice, thick pork chops (3/4 in.).
My husband does not like mushrooms, so instead of using them, I used 1 cup of diced eggplant as a substitute, and the recipe was delicious.

I followed the recipe ,but followed others advice to cook for 4 hours.  The dish was very good but the sauce was a little too watery for my taste and the chops were a tad dry. 
It was easy to make and I love any dish that includes veggies!  I will folow others advice and next time will use some pork with a little more fat.  I used Barilla Tuscan sauce and Hunts basil, oregano, and garlic diced tomatoes. and included the white wine.  Made a very nice semi-homemade sauce.  I think taking some of the sauce and using an immersion blender then adding it back in, would thicken up the sauce.  It's a great base recipe and I'll definitely try again.

Can omit browning ..put everything in crock together...use 14 oz can diced tomatoes and half the wine......cook 4-5 hrs...it's plenty of time.....can also use frozen chicken or pork then cook for full time....really ez...add more spices....needs a little extra  seasoning...add grated pram cheese instead of mozzarella......worth making...great with pasta...lots of sauce

Good flavors....just a little dry....i used very lean pork chops that were on the thinner side...did not fry any of the meat or veggies prior..everything in the crock pot. I also used a 28oz.can of crushed tomatoes instead of jarred sauce and used 14oz can of fire roasted tomatoes.  Tasty....especially using red and green peppers.  Will make again ..maybe with a different cut of pork. Served over whole grain pasta.

I had planned on making this in the crockpot but forgot to put it all together in the morning, even still I used the same indredients, but did it on the stove.  I browned the garlic and onions in olive oil; added the pork chops and the rest of the ingredients and let it sit on the stove for about half an hour.  I served with some noodles with xtra virgin olive oil drizzled on top.  My three kids raved

This turned out really well. I took away a star because I felt 7-8 hours was way too long. Maybe that is why so many are saying their pork turned out dry. I used a fattier cut of pork in place of pork chops. I did brown them ahead of time and checked them after 2 1/2 hours and they are perfectly done even on the low setting of my slow cooker, but that will depend on how thick your cuts are. I didn't have any white wine, so substituted chicken broth in place of it. My sauce turned out thick enough, but I also used crushed tomatoes in place of diced. A family preference. Some grated mozarella and parmesan on top worked well and served along with whole wheat spaghetti. Thanks for the recipe!

Absolutely delicious!!  Easy and quick.  My family loved it.  However I knew from previous experience using a slow cooker, that it generates a lot of juice so I used a 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes instead of the 28 oz can the recipe called for.

This is a good recipe, but I did make a change with the tomato. I used the equivalent of Hunt's spaghetti sauce (multiple flavors) instead.  I usually get the Four Cheese sauce and add one of the Spicy. The choice of sauces, for instance, are Spicy, With Mushrooms, Traditional, Meat, and more. My favorite, is Four Cheeses. I even use it for my pizzas. Give it a try.. The sauces are already flavored..Extra addition. I, too, like another reviewer prefer chops with the bone. There is more flavor and the tenderness is almost guaranteed.  Thanks, Sneakyteaky....

This recipe was delicious until I screwed it up.  I decided to mix the pasta into it, and was perfect for lunch.  But I forgot to turn off the crockpot and by supper time the sauce dried up and the pasta turned to mush.  I will definitely make this dish again but I'll unplug the crockpot when it's done, so I don't make the same mistake again.

This was fantastic!  I was a bit lazy and threw the pork chops in the crockpot semi-frozen and just mixed the veggies (didn't sautee them) and sauce/spices together, poured over the pork and let it cook.  The pork was so tender and flavorful, the entire family loved it!  I will definately use this as a base recipe for beef, brats, chicken, etc. in the future!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I did not brown the chops before adding to slow cooker as some reviewers suggested.  It came out very tender.  Next time I think I will use a better quality jar sauce, the one I used was not as flavorful, and the house did not smell great as I was expecting.

Family really liked this recipe. I stuck with using pork chops but I felt that more than four could be used, there was a whole lot of sauce left over. Six chops is what I would use next time. Also only used a 14.5 oz. can of diced tomatoes, 28 oz. is not needed. Next time I will try a previous reviewers suggestion and coat chops in bread crumbs before browning. Great, uncomplicated recipe.

This was quite good, however I don't think it needed to be slow cooked. Te sauce was excellent, one of the better ones I have had. I will make this again, however I might just brown the pork, and cover with cheese while it's in the pan, and then smother in the sauce, skipping the slowcooker entirely.

I thought I was onto something great here until I tasted the meat. The flavor didn't permeate the meat and it all smelled better than it tasted. Rather lackluster.

This was delicious!  I served over polenta to which I add a bunch of cheese.  I used mixed peppers - red and green - and more garlic.  I really recommend this dish.

Made it exactly as it was written and it had a LOT of flavor.
I found that because it's in the slow cooker, like all other recipes with  onions and mushrooms,  it's a good idea to add more, they seem to disappear!  It made a lot of sauce, and I froze a container for a quick dinner.
The meat falls apart, so it was impossible to top it with cheese. A wonderful recipe you can make ahead of time when having company over. I served it with linguine.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was yummy but could have used more spice. The pork chops fell apart, which I loved, but the sauce was a little bland.

Why would you cook the onion, mushrooms and peppers before putting in slow cooker? They will soften in the cooker.

This was delicious! Used thick pork chops and added a bit of fennel seed.  I would skip the jarred sauce next time and just use diced tomatoes, as I ended up with a lot of sauce.  Pork was tender and juicy, and it was a nice change from my usual chicken cacciatore.

Meh! It was rather bland and tough. Very soupy consistency and that was without putting as much sauce and wine as was called for. The cheese gave it the little flavor it did have. Sorry, won't be making this again.

This could have used a healthy dose of salt, but otherwise was pretty good. I took a tip from a few other reviewers and skipped the browning and precooking steps, electing to just dump and go, and mine turned out just fine AND I wasn't late to work this morning, so...win!

I made this by the recipe and it is delicious! The pork was fork - tender and the sauce is tasty. I let the family add their own salt to taste in my cooking, and I did add a shake to my plate. The final result was very " saucy" but I wouldn't say watery like other reviewers. Next time I will halve the amounts of tomatoes and pasta sauce, adding more as needed. Right now I have delicious spaghetti sauce!

You have to try this recipe, it is delicious!  I make it in big batches and freeze some for my Mom - who doesn't cook any longer- and it freezes beautifully.  The flavor is stupendous and I don't say that lightly.  If you can get pork on sale at the market, any kind of pork works in this recipe.  I've used pork butt steaks, and thick cut chops and they all work well.  It's a keeper!

I would definitely make it again. 

To start, I put salt and pepper on the chops before searing them. Before searing, I cut a large garlic clove in thirds and put it in the oil before adding the chops. 
I used a whole red pepper (I'm not a fan of green) and I doubled the garlic. When sauteeing the onion and pepper together, I added the minced garlic. I omitted the mushrooms since my husband isn't a fan.

I only had Vodka Pasta Sauce, so I used about 2/3rds of the jar. I added probably 1/4-1/3 c. of white Sauvingon Blanc I had in the fridge.

Once the sauce and undrained diced tomatoes were added, I put in about 1 T. of Penzeys dried red and green peppers, parsley (1 T), a pinch of celery seeds, and 2 t. of dried celery leaves. (I used the recommended basil, then added a little more with oregano and fennel seeds.) I also added about 1/4-1/2 t. of red pepper flakes...these added a nice kick, but not too much so.

I use the Aroma Rice Cooker which is also a slow cooker ($30 at Costco...best deal ever) and cooked it all on 4 hours. Perfect! The chops were tender and kept their shape but could easily be shredded by a fork.

I topped the dish with Sargentos 6-cheese Italian Blend shredded cheese. 

Soooo good!

Very good.  My slow cooker is very fast though.  Would do 3 hours on high instead of 4/7 hours on low instead of 8.  The meat was a bit dry, but again, I think that was my slow cooker... not to recipe.  My son really liked it!

After seeing all the positive reviews, I was very hopeful for this recipe.  Unfortunately, I was very disappointed.  I followed the recipe to the letter and for the effort and price, it just isn't worth a repeat.

Like some others, I could not bring myself to subject an expensive, lean cut of meat like chops to this kind of braising. I used a boneless butt roast. Otherwise, I prepared it as written, adjusting amounts to the size of the roast. It was delicious. The meat was tender, and easily shreddable, and the flavor was great. Very easy to prepare, just what you want for crock pot cooking.

It was good but a little dry. I think next time I will cook it on low for a little longer. I did add more spices and I will say it tasted much better the next day.

Cooked this as directed and it came out ok but not as good as I hoped. Pork just does not go well with all of the tomato. May try a sage pasta sauce next time or add a teaspoon of ground sage.

I tried it with boneless chicken thighs and the chicken turned out great but the sauce was watery and bland.  I was cooking for two so used appx 1 1/3 lb of chicken, half the sauce and tomatoes with the full amount of onion, pepper, mushrooms (Baby Bellas) and garlic.  I didn't have Italian seasoning so used 1/4 teaspoon each of basil, oregano, thyme, rosemary and a bay leaf, along with a very good pasta sauce sold by a local restauraunt and Muir Glen fire roasted chopped tomatoes.  It definitely needed salt and pepper.  I served over linguine and used freshly grated parmesan which helped but would look for another recipe in the future.

Made this exactly as written and served over leftover spaghetti noodles. My kids gobbled it up! And while the kids loved it - when I make it again I will follow other reviewers suggestions and use Rotel and a spicy tomato sauce. Was a little bland for me but perfect for kids.  Only cooked about 4 hours in the crockpot and pork was moist. 8 hours would definitely be too long.

I made this recipe exactly as written, except I substituted parmesan cheese for the mozzarella. It was delicious. It does make a lot of sauce. I put the extra in the freezer for another use...probably w/ more pork chops in another installment of this recipe. My picky ten year old declared "really good, I'd like to have this again".

The only thing I will do differently is to add fresh parsley the next time I make this  This is a great recipe and I'll make it again. If anyone does wish to thicken up the sauce a little it's easy. Take about 1 tbs. of flour and mix with a small amount of water to make a creamy paste. Stir this rapidly into the sauce and allow to cook awhile longer, and it will thicken as it cooks. I put mine over pasta, and used it as it came out of the crockpot.

The flavor was absolutely delicious.  Only thing is that it came out pretty watery.  I did not add extra water to the crock pot.  Next time I may leave out the wine and try to drain as much liquid off the veggies before moving to the crock pot as possible.  May also drain the diced tomatoes before adding.  I used a cabernet marinara and it was phenomenal.  Great recipe!

Really good, and easy!  I decided to brown it with flour and seasoning like other people did, and I can't say that kept the sauce thick or not, as I also drained the tomatoes.  There was still a bit of extra liquid, but we liked it.  I used roasted red peppers as other people did--only peppers I had in the house.  I don't like mushrooms, but I just pulled them out on my plate since hubs does like them.  A note:  if you are worried about dry pork chops, just cook for less time.  I cooked for about 2 hours on high and they were perfectly cooked and delicious.  I put a thermometer in the crock pot before turning off to make sure, and the temp was definitely over 160, so it was fine.  Thanks for the recipe!

I really enjoyed this recipe with one exception.  Tomato sauce is nothing more than tomatoes, fresh or canned, and seasonings and maybe onion if you like it.  I don't understand why everyone feels it is necessary to add a "jar of sauce" to this recipe when you are already making your own sauce with the tomatoes and seasonings.  What happens is that cooking the "jar of sauce" for another 7 hours makes a really acidic and STRONG sauce.  Next time I make it, I will simply add a 28 oz. can of crushed tomatoes instead of that costly "jar of sauce" and I'm sure I will end up with a very nice tasting tomato sauce.  I am not a crockpot fan, but I would definitely make this again.  I really enjoyed it (minus the extra acid in the way too cooked jar of sauce). Thanks for submitting!

Delicious & simple comfort food!  Loved this recipe, I served over spinach pasta.  I made pretty much as written but added some fresh basil and oregano, red and yellow peppers in addition to the green.  I had two huge center-cut pork chops, so I just added one 15 oz can of diced tomatoes and a half a 32 oz jar of sauce.  Lots of sauce left over, I froze it and I'll use for a side of pasta with grilled sausages.  After 7 hours low this was fall-apart tender.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe, Sneakyteaky!

This was so easy, and really good. Everyone in my family, including my toddler, chowed down on this. The pork got so tender it practically fell apart without cutting, and the melted cheese on top of everything was delicious. I prepped it all the night before and put it in the fridge overnight, then started the slow cooker in the morning. I served it in the evening with spaghetti for a quick weeknight dinner.

We loved this. Chops were moist and tender. I did brown them first as per the recipe. Think I'll try it with chicken thighs next time.

I used a pork loin roast instead of chops. The sauce wound up being thinner than I anticipated but the flavor was really good.  I will try draining the diced tomatoes and adding tomato paste next time I make it. This recipe definitely needs salt and pepper.

Made this last weekend. Followed the recipe, results were great. Family says do it again soon and it is high on their list for when we have company over for super.  One thing I did do is make my own linguini pasta.  The sauce is so good, I now have it on my keep it made up foods.

I had no spaghetti sauce so I used Alfredo sauce instead.  It was absolutely delicious.  Next time I shall use the speghetti sauce.  It will be one of my favorites.

Ver nice idea.  Like earlier reviewers I did not feel good about using todays' ultra lean pork chops.  Instead I used a nice thick, well trimmed,2 1/2 ib. pork sirloin roast.  I browned it lightly with olive oil, course sea salt and a pepper mixture and then put in the slow cooker with the diced tomatoes.  Cooked for 1 1/2 hours and added the sauteed onions and green pepper.  Cooked for 45 minutes, and drained off all the liquid.  While the roast continued to cook I thickened the drained tomato base liquid with a small amount of corn starch to resolve the "watery" issue noted by some other reviewers. I put the thickened stock back in the cooker and added about 60% of a large jar of Arribiata Pasta sauce, continuing to cook for another 2 1/2 hours or just under 5 hours total. I added mushrooms in the last hour so that they dd not overcook.  The roast was wonderfully tender, moist and flavorful--not quite the consistency of pulled pork but close enough to make serving easy and eating a delight.  The sauce was of moderate spiciness (it worked for my family who ranges from delighting in spiciness to those who prefer little) and of perfect consistency for the pasta on top of which I served the pork and sauce and vegetable mixture.

Cooked this yesterday, aroma drove us crazy!  Stopped crockpot after 4-1/2 hrs and chops were so fall apart tender and taste was great.  Added some cracked pepper to sauce shortly before serving and put meat on a bed of linguine, covered with sauce and shredded asiago cheese on top.  Served with garlic bread.  This is really a keeper!!  Thank you sneakyteaky for submitting this to share with us.

I followed the recipe ingredients exactly except for the pork, which I didn't have.  Also used two jars of pasta sauce.  I used frozen chicken breasts and added them directly to the crock pot without thawing.  Threw everything together and cooked on low for about 7 hours.  The chicken was moist and falling apart.  Sprinkled our dishes with grated mozzarella because that's what I had and served over mini-fusilli pasta.  It tasted even better the next day.  My husband and I both really enjoyed this.  I'll be making it again.

This is a great recipe. I have been looking for more pork slow cooker recipes and this one fit the bill. I did make it with some modifications (used carrots instead of green peppers and a sweet Riesling wine instead of dry) but I don't think those modifications significantly change the recipe. If anything, it just goes to show how versatile and easy customizable this recipe is. One thing I would like to mention is that you should buy thick cut pork chops instead of a thin cut. The chops I used were 1 to 1-1/2 inches thick and they were perfect. I will definitely be making this again!

I used my own tomato basil pasta sauce and it made this especially great, my husband loved it, the meat fell apart.  Lots of sauce leftover, so today I am going to add ground beef, and eat it again!

This is a great basic slow cooker sauce that works with almost everything.   Add cut up and browned top round steak and bingo..swiss steak!  I usually serve with mashed potatoes but pasta works as well.

I find pork chops with the bone in don't dry out as much as boneless...bone gives more flavor it seems.  Delicious.

This was very good. I used a combination of button and baby bella mushrooms. I also used shredded mozzarella, as that's what I had on hand. The meat was fall-apart tender and had great flavor. It made the house smell amazing all day. Thank you :)

This was okay, I wasn't really crazy about it. My husband liked it but I think he was the only one that did. I think I would prefer chicken cacciatore.

My husband LOVED this dish.  I didn't really care for the pork.  As other users stated, it was a bit dry and the flavor didn't seem to penetrate the meat.  Though, I like meat very tender, even though this did fall off the bone.  I think it is a personal taste.  I will make this again for my family, it was easy, low fat, and filling!  Thanks!

Great base flavors, we put it over basmati rice. We are going to try using country style ribs next time instead of pork chops, I think a darker meat would be better.

This is kind of weird but we liked the Cacciatore but the pork just didn't cut it.  I bought All-Natural pork chops that are not in a brine solution.  The meat was stringy, really unappealing.  However, the leftover Cacciatore sauce got used with other things.  I'll go back to chicken.

I happened to have a small pork roast, so I used that instead of chops.  The only other change that I made was to omit the green pepper due to the diet restriction of a family member.  My Sicilian Grandmother would have made this recipe again and again, so will I!

Made this last night.  Read other reviews so used 1/2 the pasta sauce and 1/2 the tomatoes.  Had to omit the onion & garlic due to my current dietary restrictions so increased the other seasonings a bit.  Still ended up with 3 generous meals for the two of us.

I looked at the reviews and floured and browned the pork chops. I added sun-dried tomato’s but otherwise made it as listed. Easy Peasy company dinner. I served it with a side of linguine. Made another side of green beans plus garlic bread. I sat back and took in the compliments

Great recipe! I made it even healthier, more delicious and much easier to prepare by using 12 oz. trimmed pork tenderloin (cut into large pieces) instead of the chops. No need to sauté anything or top with. Just place tenderloin pieces into crock pot, add all prepared vegetables on top. Into a bowl or large measuring cup, mix only 14 oz. each of the pasta sauce and tomatoes (undrained) and wine, then add seasonings to taste (less than listed). Pour this mixture on top of the pork and vegetables. Poke a knife into the whole mix in a few places to make sure that some of the liquid will funnel down into the vegetables and pork. Cook as directed for 8 hours. Cooked this way, the pork tenderloin comes out extremely tender and the vegetables are soft but not overcooked. Enjoy!

Very good! Made in the morning and then placed in crock pot to enjoy for dinner after work. Omitted white wine, because I did not have it.  Great for when you’re tired of making pork chops or pasta the same old way- will make again!

This would have made too much sauce to accompany just 4 pork chops so I used half the pasta sauce, half the diced tomatoes and half the wine but kept everything else the same and glad I did. It took less than 4 hours on low to cook, but I should have used a fattier pork chop since mine was dry in the middle.

I halved the recipe and served with Parmesan cheese instead of mozzarella. Boneless pork chops are too lean for this, probably much better with boneless ribs etc. Otherwise just pasta sauce with peppers, onions and mushrooms.

I have a small crock pot, so I put in the pork and all the vegetables first, then added as much sauce as would fit. It came out wonderful and will make it again. Makes a LOT of sauce that is just as good as leftovers.

I used a large onion and a medium onion, and I minced up five cloves of garlic.   Super easy to make.  I left it on for 7:30 and it fell of the bone.  Left overs for tomorrow.   Loved it!!

This was good slow-cooker recipe, I'm used to chicken cacciatore and had pork chops in the freezer to use and this worked well. As others pointed out it makes lots of sauce, so pasta and crusty bread go well with this dish.

This recipe turned out perfect for me. Like others mentioned I did not sear the pork chops,  they came out very moist and flavorful. I got bone in chops with a good ring of fat around each one. I added some salt to each chop. I doubled the chops, 8 instead of 4. Used 2 cans of fire roasted diced tomatoes, one 24oz can of Huntz pasta sauce and swapped the green pepper for red. Instead of normal pasta I used spaghetti squash, for those looking for lower carb options. After 7 hours I took the lid off and left it on for another hour, though I'm sure if you left the lid on it would be fine. In all honestly it probably was done at 7 hours. Instead of mozzarella, would definitely recommend using fresh Parmesan.  Over all though, very good base recipe.

I have made this recipe more then a dozen times.  Every time everyone loves it.  I do not put the mozzarella on it but pass parmesan cheese instead.  It is one of the best slow cooker recipes I have found.  Thanks

I really enjoyed it, but did add a lot more meat than the recipe called for.   Next time, I'll again add extra meat (~3 lbs pork chops, total) and also try skipping the marinara sauce and just use 28 oz petite chopped tomatoes with all of the vegetables.    Any extra sauce would make great marinara sauce if blended with an immersion blender.

I was looking for something different for pork chops with an Italian flair.  

The chops were tender enough and pulled apart with your fork...  I do my own spaghetti sauce usually and spice mine for a punch,  but stuck close to the recipe this first time.  I ended up increasing the spices a bit. 

However, the grain in pork chops is tight, they will hold spices to the outside when doing something like Schnitzel , however the sauce nor flavor did not penetrate the meat at all even after simmering most of the day.  

Probably will NOT do this one again, unless somebody has an idea to get better flavor penetration into the loin.

Excellent dish but someone explains to me how you pre cook the pork chops, cut and chop everything and prepare the tomatoe sauce in 15 minutes. It take s at least 1 hour to prepare.

I followed this recipe except for substituting rice for spaghetti noodles. I have a tried-and-true recipe for chicken cacciatore that I have used for years, but this one is delicious as well. My whole family enjoyed the taste with a side salad, fresh fruit, and a homemade cheese onion muffin.

Decided to forego the 'shrooms, but added pancetta, inserting the step after browning the pork, and before the onions and peppers.  Very tasty!

This was the first time ever I didn't make a change. The sauce was amazing on it's own, but became a little bland after poring it over the pasta.  However if I do make this again I will add some red pepper flakes.

Made this tonight. Followed recipe exactly as written which I always do first time out. Because of personal time constraints I cooked it on low for 6 hrs which was more than enough time. My boneless pork chops were pretty thick. Sauce was thin but I was ok with it. Seasoned with salt after plating which worked perfectly. Served it with thin whole grain pasta. Will definitely make again. Hearty New England Winter meal.

It's OK, but under seasoned.  Also , it makes way more sauce than you can use.  I'm going to use the extra sauce as spaghetti sauce after I figure out what to use for seasoning.

I have made this multiple times , I have used boneless skinless chicken thighs in place of pork. This is now cooking in my crockpot with 3 lbs of italian sausage . I baked them in the oven for 40 minutes,cut them in slices and followed the recipe except for adding a little sugar to cut the  acidity.  I serve it over the small rigatoni. I live alone so I put this in small containers with some pasta and parmesan cheese and freeze. Excellent  recipe.

Really lovely recipe.

I didn't have any mozzarella so switched it up with some cheddar. - Of course I should've added a little extra salt to compensate, but forgot.

Still, with a day rapidly falling to pieces it was good to have something warm and comforting that just sat and saw to itself until we were ready for it (must've been about 3hrs on warm function after cooking). 

Definitely a keeper.

I also found pork very dry, will use chicken next time.
Loved the flavor, added zucchini and only used 1/2 jar
marinara sauce, next time will drain the diced tomatoes.
Also only cooked for 4 hours

This is excellent, aside from one fact.  Your print magazine gave the preparation time as TEN MINUTES...here it says 15 minutes.  Well, it took me 35 minutes preparation time.

Unfortunately I didn't like this.  I'm not the best cook so maybe I did something wrong. It just tasted like Mariana sauce over pork chops.

No doubt this was good...made it tonight. The house smelled so good. I went exactly by the recipe, except one thing. By the time I browned the chops in the oil, then sautéed the onion, mushrooms, pepper, then the sauce, etc. etc. I thought, why not just keep cooking it in the pan that everything has been prepped in?? 
I mean, I've spent an hour+ browning and cooking, dirtying up a pan and utensils. Why dirty up my crockpot too?? The beauty of the crockpot/slow cooker is...you put the ingredients in it and let it cook itself. I don't want to spend an hour cooking and then put it IN the cooker. It just seems "not convenient" which is what I love about my crockpot!! Still give it four stars--delicious.

Made this for my parents tonight and they loved it!  I followed recipe except I used 8 pork chops and one 15 oz. can of fire-roasted tomatoes (all I had), 6 cloves of garlic (we like garlic!) and both a red and green bell pepper.  The sauce is a little thin but could be adjusted to preferred consistency.  I cooked it in slow cooker 3 hours on high, came out perfectly, meat very tender!  Don't skip the mozzarella cheese!  It's delicious!  Thanks for a great recipe!!

I am always looking for low sodium recipes so made my own sauce with crushed tomatoes, tomato paste and no sodium diced tomatoes.  I had to add more seasonings but that is very easy to do.  It tasted great the first day and even better the next day.  I did add some grated Romano cheese but not much since it is so salty.

For years I've done a pork cacciatore in the oven that comes out tender and moist each time.  However, I thought I would try this slow cooker version due to the convenience of using the crock pot. I followed the recipe as written except for the mushrooms (neither my husband nor I are mushroom lovers).   I was disappointed.  I found the meat dry and the sauce a bit watery.  I'll be sticking to my oven version.

I found this recipe absolutely divine.  Contrary to others I found the pork moist and flavoursome.

I did add an extra clove of garlic to the recipe.

My entire family ate this up. The pork does get a little dry, as it is such a lean meat.  In the future I may cut the coooking time, but certainly will make this again!

This turned out so well! My pork chops fell apart when I took them out of the slow cooker, so I pulled them apart with 2 forks like pulled pork and it was great over pasta. My only complaint is that the sauce was very watery. Shredding the pork helped. Next time I would add a little tomato paste to thicken the sauce. Overall, the flavour (and SMELL!) was fantastic and I will make this again.

I used a small pork butt roast , and roasted red peppers instead of fresh ones. Slowed cooked for 8 hours and served over white rice. The roast was juicy and fall apart tender. I make once a month on Sunday.

This was excellent!  Too late in the day so I did it on the stove and used chicken.  DH loved it.  I did put the sauce and fire roasted tomatoes in the blender (I don't like tomato pieces in my sauce.  Definitely a keeper!

Absolutely fantastic dish! I followed the original recipe & only made a couple of small adjustments. I substituted 1/3 each of red, yellow & orange bell pepper in place of the green bell pepper (just my preference.) I added @ 1 tsp. sugar and 1/2 tsp. baking soda to the sauce when it was done. My mom taught me to do this to cut the bitterness when cooking with tomatoes. I only cooked it for 4-5 hours instead of 7-8. Served it over penne pasta the first time; then used bowtie the next two times. It was fabulous! The best Italian sauce I've ever made. The sauce makes so much that my husband and I had two meals with the pork chops, then I saved the rest of the sauce and added browned Italian sausage for a 3rd meal. It was really great with the sausage! So delicious!!

I made this yesterday. It was sooo good !! I didn't have any wine on hand so I omitted it. I don't know if it could possibly taste any better with the wine ?? This was absolutely delish !!! Don't change a thing & don't skip a step (as some have suggested)!!!! The meat was so tender. After having this for dinner, I shredded the rest in the juices for sandwiches for the rest of the week. I also froze a ton of the sauce/juice to use at a later date.. maybe with fish or chicken ??

 Thanks for the great recipe SneakyTeaky !!!

This is awesome!!!!! Wonderful taste! I used Barefoot brand Moscato wine - highly recommend! I can't wait to try this with chicken breasts and again with round steak. The cheese added at serving is a nice plus too and will keep using her suggestion. We don't like mushrooms, but that's the only thing I omitted. We served it with boiled, buttered potatoes. For the pasta sauce, I used Barilla's vidalia onion style. Mmmmm! I can't wait for leftovers tonight! Thanks so much for sharing "sneakyteaky"!

My husband does not like pork. Therefore I substituted pork for chicken thighs, which as I knew would fall apart & become shredded chicken. It was a little runny, just felt like it was missing something. I did season the chicken with season-all, pepper & garlic powder before I put it in the slow cooker. It does taste better the 2nd day though.

#1.  Yes a bit watery, and LOTS of sauce.  We ate the sauce on Spaghetti the first night, as I started the recipe late.  Sauce on Spaghetti was excellent.  Put the crock pot in the fridge overnight, pork chops still needed more time, only had about 4-5 hours of cooking time first day, and started it up the next day about 10 AM.  By 3PM the chops were braking apart, ready for supper.  Oh YEAH !!  Followed the recipe EXACTLY, and just a taste of the sauce made my mouth water and cringe with delight.  Going to share this one with family and friends, not something I do often, this one is worthy.  To thicken the sauce a little maybe could add a little corn starch or masa, didn't bother me, I wiped it all up with garlic bread : ).

Easy, fresh and delicious.  Used 4 frozen chicken breasts (could've added a couple more for meat-to-sauce ratio), dropped in the crockpot as is and followed the rest of the recipe as is... adding only one can of tomato paste, 1t of salt and an extra 1t of basil.  Was a great, easy, enjoyable dinner! Thanks!

My husband and I both thought this was excellent. I used all of the listed ingredients, but I cooked it in the pressure cooker for 30 minutes--about right for my model. The meat was moist and tender...very good. The only thing I would change next time is to omit the white wine. I use a very good and tasty low carb pasta sauce, and I felt the wine actually detracted from it. I used some garlic salt too.

Fantastic and Easy!!  It's also superb with chicken.  If you're short on time, or don't have a slow cooker, it can be cooked on top of the stove using low heat.

I followed most of the above recipe but I had to make a few changes when I realized I didn't have a few ingredients!  I used marinated artichoke hearts instead of the mushrooms, one small can of tomato paste with 18 ounces of water because I didn't have jarred spaghetti sauce and red wine instead of white.  And you what?  It turned out great.  I started it at 10:30AM and put it in my crock pot on high.  It was ready to eat by 1:30PM when my husband came home for lunch.   the lid of the crock pot during the cooking process and the sauce will thicken nicely.  Also, if the sauce is tart, add 1/4 tsp of baking soda and a teaspoon of sugar.  The baking soda reduces the acidity of the tomato sauce.  Add salt and pepper to taste during the cooking process.  This is great recipe.  I normally don't change the ingredients to recipes when I make them for the first time, but I had to after realizing I was missing a few. Also, if the sauce should taste bland, add more garlic, basil and italian seasoning.  Remember, it's to your taste.  If you don't like the taste after following the directions, doctor the recipe to suit you.

Great recipe. Used beef for  both tacos and burritos. One change and one add on.
I used one can of beef consommé (Campbell's ), and added a layer of onions on bottom of crockpot. Perfect!

I made this recipe and, although very good and easy, thought that one could cut out the spaghetti sauce entirely and use 2 cans of diced tomatoes.  I had a lot of sauce left over.  I also believe this would be very good with chicken.  I served mine over bowtie pasta.  I'll keep this recipe and make again.

Not really that impressed with this. The pork was so tender but really no flavor was added from the sauce. Don't think I will be making this one again. Sorry!

Maybe my crock pot runs hot, but the pork was pretty dry after 7 hours.  Otherwise a decent pasta.

This was super yum! I used red peppers instead of green and I used half the amount of sauce and diced tomatoes.  We still have sauce left over, but it will be put to good use!  So happy to have another go to slow cooker meal!

instead of adding the garlic and italian seasoning-try adding 3 tablespoons of Homemade Gourmet's Grandmother’s Sunday Roast Seasoning

YUM!!  Instead of the slow cooker, I put it in the oven.
