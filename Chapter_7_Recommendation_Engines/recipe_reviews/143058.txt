I should start out by confessing that I'm no fan of anchovies.  I don't know what persuaded me to try this recipe but I am so glad I did.  The anchovies kind of dissolve into the veggie mix- you don't even know they're there (especially if, like me, you only use 4 oz. of anchovies instead of six).  I did cut the red pepper down to one tablespoon and it was plenty spicy but not burn your mouth off.  Also, I recommend doubling up on the veggies because the first time I made this, it felt a little scant- doubling made sure we had a hearty bite every time.  Also, any old noodle works well in this.  Thank you so much Rachel, for a dish that tastes like it came from a restaurant and takes very little time or energy to prepare!

I really enjoyed this recipe and figured I would because I love anchovies! I used the amount called for and I didn't think it was too pungent, this dish really has wonderful flavor. I didn't measure the veggies, but I doubled them, maybe even tripled them. As written, I don't think that's enough for a pound of pasta, at least not for us. Also, I used 2 cans of diced  tomatoes and instead of adding the water, I used the juice from them, which was great. Be sure not to cover this at the end while simmering, because it was way too soup-y and thin. Simmer uncovered for 5-10 minutes so it reduces. With a few changes, this recipe is really great, and I highly recommend this to anchovy lovers! Thanks for sharing :)

Mmmm, so simple and so delicious! Don't be afraid of the anchovies. They melt into the sauce just leaving their delicious flavor behind. Thanks for the recipe, I will make it often!

First time I ever cook anything with anchovies in it. I was pleasently surprised by the simplicity of the recipe and the flavors in it. Very good. Not bland at all. The saltiness of the anchovies it's all this dish needs. I only used 4oz (instead of 6oz) because I was afraid of overpowering the dish with the anchovies flavor but that wasn't the case. I think 6oz would be just fine as well. Will make again.

I made this for my husband and he literally gobbled it down!  I actually liked it; although I don't care for anchovies.  The garlic made the whole thing come together very nicely.  I would make it again.

I've never had anchovies before, so this dish was a pleasant surprise for me.  Personally, I prefer a much chunkier pasta dish, and so the next time around I might be willing to either double everything else or halve the amount of pasta.  Trying this with another type of pasta (penne or bowties) might also be good.

This was pretty good!  I wanted to make this more veggie than pasta, so for three servings I used 4 oz. of spaghetti, halved the olive oil and used only 2 oz. of anchovies, which was plenty for our tastes.  I doubled the broccoli and tomatoes and added some chopped fresh basil that I needed to use up, and also subbed homemade vegetable stock for the water.  The sauce was tasty, but it was a little thin for me - almost broth-like.  I wanted to add a pat of butter to "finish" it, but didn't this time.   Still, I enjoyed this! Thanks, Rachel!

Very tasty dish.  We ALL loved it.  I substituted 1/2 cup white wine and 1/2 cup chicken broth.  I also recommend not covering while cooking because it came out very runny.  Once it sat for a while, the juices got absorbed and it was much better than our first helping.  And last, if you don't like anchovies, don't worry, they totally disappear with all the cooking.  But they leave a wonderful taste.

This was great.  Only change I made was I added a chicken bouillon cube to the water.  Other than that, exactly like written and it was wonderful.  Thanks.

I found frozen anchovies fillets in a supermarket. They are healthy fish, so I found this recipe as best rated on allrecipes.  I have few remarks:
- no need to add so much water as per this recipe, add only as much water as you think it will need
- no need to use "choped" anchovies, as they will dissolve
- the dish needs more spices. I'm not sure which spicies goes well with anchovies. As some other reviews noted, this dish can take as much garlic as you can eat. 
- parmesan needs to be added to this recipe, as you probably want to eat this with parmesan.

This was really good, easy, and quick. I did make a few modifications (which sometimes you just have to do). I left out mushrooms b/c I didn't have any and I don't eat/love them enough to go buy a bunch. I used spicy anchovies b/c that's what I had on hand. I didn't have fresh parsley so I used dried parsley flakes. I added garlic powder (b/c I love garlic) and salt to taste. Topped with a bit of parmesan (good but not necessary) and fresh cracked black pepper. Yum!

Very good with a couple of changes. I doubled the vegetables and eliminated the water. I also used a little parmasan cheese to thicken the sauce. I also eliminated the oil and just used what came with the anchovies. The flavor was exceptional.

good, but after tasting it while cooking I added about twice the tomato, as well as a little more of the other veggies.

Pretty good, but I think I would need to add some more fish to it so I can feel full... I need meat!  However, if you don't eat a lot of meat, this is a great dish for you with a bold flavor.  I would give it one more star if it were hardier, but based on flavor, it's outstanding.

Very good but I did mine a little different.   I only used 3 oz of the anchovy fillets.  A little does go a long way.  Use more if you like but I think 6 oz is very overwhelming for this recipe.   I added 2 cups (instead of 3/4) of the  broccoli florets and only 1 tablespoon (instead of 1 1/2) of the red pepper flakes.   I also added 1 cup (instead of 1/2) of diced tomatos and 1 cup of heavy cream.  The heavy cream softened the taste of the anchovies and gave the sauce more depth.  And it was excellent to soak up with garlic bread.

So good! For just me and my husband, I cut the pasta way back, but make the sauce as called for with 6 servings. It's delicious! In place of the water, I use a half cup of white wine and half a cup of chicken broth. I also cut back on the crushed red pepper just a wee bit. If you don't use all the pasta, that spice goes a long way, and we love spice! I can't wait to make this again. Don't forget to serve this with garlic bread. :)

Love all the veggies, but I found that it needed more seasoning.    Also, for garlic to be in the heading of the recipe, I thought it should have had more of a punch.  This could be personal preference as in my family tradition growing up Italian, it is one of the food groups.  I'll modify and try again.
