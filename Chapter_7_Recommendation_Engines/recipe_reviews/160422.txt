Made a few changes - 
I left out the parsley since I didn't have any on hand. I only used a 10oz box of frozen spinach, and shredded an extra 1/4C of cheese to sprinkle on top. Also, I've started making this dip with light mayo, light sour cream & 1/3 less fat cream cheese - still tastes just as good (but is better for you!). This has become my go-to hot dip recipe for any gathering. So yummy.

Everyone I've made this for loves this recipe! I add extra garlic and usually use parmesan or romano instead of asiago cheese. Our closest market's cheese section is terrible. I've also put it inside of puff pastry squares as a filling for spinach puffs. That is sooo easy and people think you spent all day. Amazing either way!

Amazing! All my friends asked for the recipe. I used fresh baby spinach for mine, so there were no chewy or stringy pieces.

Scaled this down to about 16 servings and made as directed.  This was AWESOME!  After my hubby's golf game today he brought back a few friends.  This was gone in no time.  We will be making this again and again for sure.  Oh, one buddy who doesn't even like spinach, ate half of it.

Wow!  Best spinach dip I've ever had!  Just a couple small changes : I used fresh spinach because that's what I had on hand and I replaced the 1/2 cup of mayo with a 1/2 cup of plain Chobani Greek Yogurt.  The yogurt made it so light and airy.  Amazing!

Made it twice, the first in the oven, kind of dry. Then I made again with 1/2 cup more asiago and put it in the fondue pot.  It was GREAT!

I made this dip last night for our family gathering and it was a big hit.  Didn't change a thing and served it with pita crisps and a cut up baguette and it was really tasty.  I'll definitely keep it in my recipe box.  Thanks for a great appy!

The recipe could be a bit creamier/cheesier. It ended up much heavier on the spinach than cheese.

Yummy!  If you like hot spinach dip when you eat out, this is your new favorite dip! I followed the recipe except added less cream cheese (I only had 4 ounces in the house) and it was great! I served with nacho chips and french bread.

This was a VERY good dip. I made it for Christmas and it was a hit! I made garlic pita chips with it and it was requested to be made for New Years as well. Definitely worth trying!!!! I made it exact to the recipe, except I topped it with Romano cheese- yummy!!!!!!!!

For me, this was just ok.  I agree with the other reviewer who said it was a bit too dense.  My husband and I both felt it needed to be creamier.  I'm really glad I tested this first before serving it to guests. I have used much better recipes for Hot Spinach Dip.  With modifications this one would be much better.

Wow! Amazing! I added a bit more sour cream and mayo (about 1/4 cup each) and that made it very creamy rather than stiff. So good! Was generous with the garlic, and also sprinkled a little more asiago on top before baking. I'm a cheese lover so it makes me happy but not necessary. It's 10:30 at night and I'm still dipping into it!

Easy peasy and delicious. Modifications I made were: instead of an onion, I used a shallot. And, instead of Asiago, I used an 8oz. package of four-cheese blend. Definitely will be a go-to from now on.

I got many rave reviews about this dip. Great texture and taste. Also, really easy to make.   I just mixed the ingredients in a small crock pot, put in on about 2 hours beforehand, and it was ready for guests.  I changed the amount of parsley.  I only added about 2 tablespoons, as the spinach was enough on the flavor and greenery. Also, I added about a cup of corn to the mix to give it a little extra color.
