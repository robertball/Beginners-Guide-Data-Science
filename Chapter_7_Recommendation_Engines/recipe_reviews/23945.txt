This was really good.  It was quick and easy to make.  Tried it with sourdough bread, and it was great.  My teen-aged kids loved it with tortilla chips.

Everyone loved it at my New Year's Eve party.  I served this in a sourdough bread bowl with bread, melba toast, and tortilla chips. Really good recipe.

I've been making this recipe for years and it is always a hit, wherever I take it.  You can keep all the main ingredients in your pantry and make it in a moment's notice.  Perfect for unexpected get-togethers.  I serve it with cocktail bread or slice baguette.

Super yummy!  The flavors blend wonderfully and the chiles add spunk.

This recipe was disappointing. I didn't have green chilies and substituted 1/4 C of green chili sauce. I used two small jars of marinated artichokes (was a little shy of recommended amount). It was better after it was cold than when it was hot...but still was lacking something...

4.5, such a NICE change from the standard hot artichoke/spinach dip.  As well, I used water packed artichokes as I felt the oil packed ones would make the mixture too oily. The only thing that could have made it better is a couple of splashes of hot pepper sauce.  :)
