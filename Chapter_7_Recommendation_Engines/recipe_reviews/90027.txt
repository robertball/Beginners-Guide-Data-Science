Was looking for something fast & easy to do with tilapia and this fit the bill.  Substituted 1/2 t dried tarragon for the fresh.  Fish was a tad overcooked, maybe 3 minutes would have done it?  Overall, the recipe worked but we just didn't care for the taste.  The cider vinegar seemed to overpower the dish.  Maybe this should be left off entirely?  It's easy, but this one won't be a do-over at our house.

This is delicious - we didn't add the vinegar (which is what, I suspect, the people who reviewed this poorly, didn't like). This is an easy way to prepare fish - we will make often!

I liked the way the tilapia didn't have that fishy taste it usually has.  I subtracted one minute from the cooking time because you definitely don't want to overcook fish.  My daughter didn't like the tilapia but I thought it was delicious (kids can be reluctant to try new dishes, especially ones with 'green stuff' so use this recipe for adults unless you have an adventurous kid).  I used the version of the recipe for two people and thought that two tablespoons of cider vinegar was just right, one for each fish.  If you're making more than two servings, just pour a tablespoon of vinegar on each fish rather than measuring the total amount.
Finally, cook it just before serving; don't let it get cold.

We loved this! I used 2 thin filets & they were done with just the 2 minutes. I used dried Tarragon (didn't have fresh) and just a few drops of the vinegar. My husband said "this is good, we should make fish tacos with it". I'm going to do that for my lunch today!

Aurrgh!  I meant to take a photo, but we ate it too quickly!  I am always shy about microwave recipes (especially fish), but was really late making dinner and had exactly a pound of tilapia to cook, so I was so happy to find this easy recipe.  My 4 year old son said no thank you, but my 2 year old ate it up & his portion, too.  The flavor was perfect.  When I flipped the fish, though, there wasn't any liquid to spread over the 2nd side, so I basically repeated the recipe, with a little less of everything--it was perfect.  We did 2 min on one side & 1 1/2 minutes on the other side--perfect.  Thanks!

This is surprisingly good!  Like other skeptics, I wasn't sure about microwaving fish, but I only had a few minutes to come up with something for lunch and I had some tilapia fillets in the fridge.  I didn't have any apple cider so I put a splash of lemon juice on each fillet before cooking, and fillets were gobbled down by myself and the kids in about the same time it took to cook them!  They were especially tasty with fresh tarragon from my garden.  My fillets took the full 4 minutes of cooking time,  but I did check them after flipping them as it seems that other reviewers took only 3 total minutes.  Must depend on the thickness of the fillets.  I also put a pinch of kosher salt on each fillet after cooking and that made them just perfect.

I had no idea you could microwave fish.  This is a 5-star recipe for what it is--quick microwave cooking.  It came out perfectly.  I went light on the apple cider vinegar because of some negative comments in the reviews, and I ended up adding more after I started eating it.  The flavor blended very well with the other flavors, and next time I'll put the whole amount on right away.  I used dried tarragon, but would love to try it with fresh.  I'll make this again and again.

this was a bit bland. the only thing i did differently was to use dried tarragon instead of fresh. we sprinkled penzey's 4S seasoned salt on it and that helped. it was definitely fast, and if you're OK with adding spices after tasting it, this is a good, quick dish.

This is a very quick and easy recipe. My husband usually finds tilapia too fishy, but the garlic and apple cider vinegar gives better flavor. The only change I made is a little bit less vinegar, so it doesn't over power the fish too much. But overall, this is a wonderful and quick dinner.

I have to say, this tasted better than I thought it would!  I too substituted dried tarragon (just sprinkled some on top) but my microwave took longer (approx. 6 min.).  Guess it depends on the microwave.  My kids didn't go for it, but my husband & I did.  Very quick & easy.

Tilapia is a fish that is not a staple in our household.This recipe worked perfectly in the micro wave oven as written.The only changes made were Herbs de Provence for the tarragon and rice vinegar for the apple cider vinegar, using half the amount of each.

I only microwaved one tilapia fillet that had previously been frozen. I wasn't sure how long to "cook" it for so I started with a minute. It was making a popping noise, so I stopped it and went to flip it, and it started falling apart, so I figured it was finished. I used red wine vinegar and italian seasoning because that was all I had! I enjoyed the vinegar on the fish. Not sure I would make this often because tilapia already cooks so fast on the stove or in the oven.

Made one large filet for kids sub'd Herbs de Provonce for Tarragon.  Only needed 1 min for first side and just over 30 seconds for back side.  Mixed apple juce with white wine vinegar instead also. Mildly flavored perfect for kids...DELISH!!

Thank you for posting this recipe! I did use the seasonings we prefer but it was the only recipe I could find for cooking fish in the microwave. My stove is on the fritz and I've been trying to use the microwave. The fish actually tastes better in he microwave than on the stove and much less mess.

This recipe made me love tilapia! Most fish cooked in the microwave becomes tough and inedible...but to my surprise, my tilapia was fully cooked in 3 minutes, and still tender, juicy, and sweet. I followed the recipe the first time I made it, since then I just add whatever spices catch my attention when I'm making it. But I highly recommend this one, it's fast, it's easy, and it's oh so tasty!
