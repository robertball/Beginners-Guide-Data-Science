This was very easy - I doubled the batch and made exactly as the recipe stated. I used 2 (20 ounce) package Bob EvansÂ® Hash Brown Potatoes. 
It was very good but if I make them again I will add onions and garlic as there was not much flavor.

I used 1% milk because I didn't have whipping cream and added minced onions based on other reviewers stating it was a bit bland (would have sauteed some real but didn't have any). This came out really tasty and my daughter loved it! Plus one of the few ways to make a cheesy shredded potato dish that doesn't include sour cream which is what I was looking for. I'm not positive but I'm figuring this recipe was lower in fat than other versions but definitely not lacking in flavor!

These are really good. I followed the recipe as written other then I used 2 cups of cheese. I also only cooked them for 30 minutes. Everyone loved these.

This was a pretty simple take on au gratin potatoes.  I could tell even before I read the reviews that this was going to be a little bland, so I added garlic and onion powders (I will add sauteed next time).  These were very easy and tasty.  I definitely like the shredded hash brown idea because it is much easier than peeling, slicing, and layering all those potatoes!  I am certainly saving this for future use!  Thanks!

I made these with the southwesteren style simply potatoes, and used mexican cheese instead of cheddar.
Very easy and delicious!
I took them to a brunch and everyone wanted the recipe
