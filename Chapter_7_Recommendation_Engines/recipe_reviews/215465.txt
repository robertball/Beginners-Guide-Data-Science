Excellent way to use up boxes of Triscuit crackers in my pantry that I've couponed. I used sliced deli ham and sliced deli swiss instead of turkey and cheddar. To make them less dry, I spread some homemade garlic aioli over the crackers before making the stacks. My kids especially thought this was awesome.

My niece started her first day of kindergarten and my brother has enlisted my help for snacks!  This is a great idea.  I used low-fat triscuits along with the turkey.  I took the cheddar cheese and cut into fun shapes using minuature cookie cutters I had laying around (flowers, hearts, etc).  I ditched the lettuce and tomato because I thought it might get soggy by the snack time and gave her a little bag of grapes to go with it instead.  She loved it!

This was a nice alternative to a sandwich and chips! I always think of crackers and cheese as a snack, not a meal, but in truth once you add some lunch meat and veggies it was good. I doubled it for my lunch, since I am a grown up. The nice thing about this is that nothing got soggy, I made it the night before instead of having to get up early to make a sandwich. I also didn't need chips with lunch - I love to have something crunchy and salty so this was nice.

This is a nice alternative to the old-school sandwich and the idea can be used to make many variations with the crackers. Great idea!

Have taken along assorted meat, cheese and cracker 'Lunchables' snacks this way for many years to put together and eat as a meal when away from home but never thought about also adding lettuce and halved cherry tomatoes so I thank you very much for the wonderful idea! :-)
