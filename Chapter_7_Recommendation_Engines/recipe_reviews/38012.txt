For those who had trouble with the tapioca not blending well, using flour instead is the answer. I mixed 1/3 cup flour into the sugar (of which I replaced half with Splenda) and mixed into the fruit. The result is a never-fail, smooth, lightly firm filling when baked. I used one 20 oz can of Dole crushed pineapple. Because rhubarb is out of season, I was forced to resort to the Publix frozen variety. It's less tart than fresh, so I also pepped up the tartness quotient with 1 Tb fresh lemon juice and the grated rind of one lemon. Added a dash each of cinnamon and mace. An unconventional combination (my daughter called it weird, but that was before she tasted it!) but it works - quite well!

The pineapple rhubarb combination is a perfect sweet-- tart blend. It was also very easy to make ,even with homemade pie crust. Because I like pies with texture, I did not mind chunks of pineapple, but for someone who does,  pinapple tidbits instead of chunks would be a good compromise.  Great with vanilla ice cream.
  . . .  Just a thought:  Could the reason why some cooks  are having trouble with the tapioca not dissolving be that they need to use the INSTANT tapioca instead of the regular??

I really liked this, it was quick and easy to prepare.  I love rhubarb, and bought it and the pineapple frozen. It was my first experience with tapioca, and I was pleasantly suprised with the results.  Keep 'em coming Chef Dunask!

The flavor combination is really good!  Rhubarb still powers over pineapple, but you get this random sweet bite of the pineapple and it livens up the sauce. Note: 4 cups equal about a pound.  Also- replace 1/3 cup flour for the tapioca and don't completely drain the pineapple-- you end up with a perfect consistency and sweetly flavored sauce.

This didn't work so well for me.  If I make it again, it will be with MAJOR modifications.  The tapioca was hard, and it didn't really thicken. I would also use pineapple tidbits or crushed pineapple instead of the chunks, so that the texture is a little closer to the texture of the rhubarb, which dissolves quite a bit when baked.  Overall, the flavor was ok, it was just the texture (and the hard bits of tapioca) that we didn't like.

I read this review and ended up making it exactly as the recipe called for - I used Minute tapioca.  The pie was excellent!  My husband and his friends love it.  Thanks.

This is a fabulous dessert!  My guests absolutely loved it.  I made the recipe exactly - I thought about adding cinnamon but decided not to.  The pie does not need any flavoring because the rhubarb and pineapple flavors are wonderful on their own.  This recipe is a keeper!

I never had the courage to eat rhubarb, but I have a bunch growing in my garden and had to make something with it.  I made this pie and for the first time I was really impressed.  The pineapple was the perfect contrast and gave enough sweetness.  I made it for mother's day and it was a big hit with everyone.

Excellent! I love pineapple and rhubarb and the combination of the two is just delicious. It is such a simple pie to make and it smells heavenly as it bakes and tastes wonderful. My husband is a picky eater and he loves this pie.

Excellent recipe!  I got lots of good comments on this pie.  The rhubarb and pineapple pair very well.  My only comment is that this recipe does not make a deep dish pie.  When I made it in my deep dish pie plate, it was disappointingly shallow.  The next time I made it, I simply increased the filling ingredients by half to get a full pie.  I will definitely make this pie again and again.

I liked the combination of rhubarb and pineapple. I think I like just rhubarb better.  It was different .I used suggestions of crushed pineapple (20 oz can)  and 1/3 cup flour. Turned out perfect.

Really great flavor! My family liked it, but I could definitely feel hard chunks of tapioca. I even baked it for an additional 10 minutes, and they still didn't cook down. Not a deal breaker, but a disappointment anyway!

I have tried other pineapple rhubarb pie recipes, but this is absolutely the best.  I did make a few suggested changes: 1 cup sugar, 20 ounce can of pineapple and 1/4 C flour.  The 20 ounce can of pineapple yields 1 pound of pineapple after draining.  So the amounts of fruit were equal.  Used my own pie crust recipe with 1/2 butter and 3 tablespoons of sugar.  A perfect dessert that my family loved.

This makes a simple very tasty pie. I used fresh pineapple and fresh rhubarb.
I made it a second time, reducing the sugar by 1/8 cup (I just used 1 cup sugar), and adding 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/8 tsp nutmeg and was delighted with the results - the spices and reduced sugar brought out the tartness of the rhubarb, but not overwhelmingly so.  This is a keeper!
