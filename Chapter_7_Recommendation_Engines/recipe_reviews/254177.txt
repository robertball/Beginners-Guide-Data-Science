My wife didn't even want any after tasting it.  I didn't even think it was hardly sweet so I added another 1/2 cup of sugar... and then a bunch of stevia, and it still did not seem very sweet.

This was quite good. It is creamy but you have to take it out of the freezer at least 15 minutes before you can scoop it. I used brown rice syrup instead of corn syrup.
