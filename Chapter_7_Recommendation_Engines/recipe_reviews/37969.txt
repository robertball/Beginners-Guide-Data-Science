Pretty good! Honey is such a tasty alternative to sugar in coffee-drinks. I love relaxing with a honey bee latte. =)

Sorry, this didn't do it for me. I love honey in tea, but it didn't work in coffee; honey is as flavorful as it is sweet, and in coffee it just tasted weird. I threw this away, and once again turned to my favorite: 'Mom's Warm Milk.' I love that stuff :)
