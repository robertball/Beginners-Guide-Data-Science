This is very similar to Hungarian Galushka which my mother made - although 1 cup of butter is overkill!  I reduced it to 1/4 to 1/2 cup and add a little chicken broth if it needs to be more moist.  Try using wide egg noodles instead of the farfalle, a freshly ground coarse black pepper. Combine cabbage and noodles in the pan and cook together for a few minutes to blend flavors. This was a frequent, Friday-night, vegetarian supper.  Thanks for the memories!

This is an old slovak recipe called 'Haluski' Grandma passed down the love of it. It is not spicy, most slovak food is not, but it is full of flavor. We 'cheat' and add sliced polish sausage to it to make a whole meal, YUM

I loved this dish!  I made a few changes, however.  Being Italian American, I grew up having a bowl of pasta with butter, and a little salt & pepper, so I am always looking for pasta dishes.  I used it as the recipe suggested, but used whole wheat pasta shells, and only 1/2 of a 13 oz package.  I used minced onion, and garlic salt instead of the garlic and onion, and added a little salt & pepper.  Also, I like my cabbage crisp tender, so cooking for only 7 minutes was enough for me.  The butter paired really well with the pasta and cabbage.  I also love parmesean cheese with pasta, and added a little to my dish before serving.  Cheese is a little salty, so you might want to use very little salt in the cabbage.  Also, this is a quick dish, I had it ready in 35 minutes, and served it with nothing else, but some hot pull apart rolls.....Delicious!

Great basic recipe. I have made this for years (Polish you know!!) After 40 years I think I have thought of most every variation. They are all good with this dish. I usually make mine in a skillet then add noodles at the end with a half cup of sour cream. It is just a nice touch, tastes great!

Great recipe.  I fried up a few slices of bacon, and let them rest while I prepared the rest of the recipe.  When done, I put the bacon on top with a dallop of sour cream.  I halved the butter on the advice of other reviewers.  I would add more garlic next time, because it seemed a little bland to me.  But I think this recipe is great because you can really make it your own.  Thanks!

My family loves this one, but instead of butter I substitute 1 pound of bacon and cook the rest of this in the bacon fat. The bacon makes it a meal.

This is very good!!!  I used a package of Dole Coleslaw with the carrots in it and I liked the flavor alot.  I did cut the butter down by 1/2 and next time I think I'll start with 1/4 cup and just add it if it's needed.  I also added more salt and pepper to taste.

Excellent side dish, goes great with meatloaf! A bit heavy on the butter though, so I cut back. Instead I used 6T butter + 2T olive oil. I also recommend using egg or macaroni noodles instead of the farfalle.

Nice classic Halushki recipe. I serve this with peanut butter and jelly sandwiches like my mother used to do when we were young. It was a comfort food for us.

Pretty good! I used 1/2 cup light butter and halved the recipe. Added about a cup of chicken broth to the skillet. Served with corned beef baked in the oven - good combination!

We really liked this dish!  The only thing I did different was add 1 lb. hamburger (plus some of the drippings) and dropped the butter to 1/4 cup.  It was yummy!

I am not a big fan of cabbage, but I am a big big fan of this recipe!!  (I cut the recipe in half) Was a very easy dish to prepare.  I cut the amount of butter WAY down and added two pieces of sliced bacon. I also used garlic powder instead of cloves and whole wheat pasta. I think next time I might add some sausage as suggested in a previous review.

Loved this one.  Used red cabbage. 1/4 cup butter. Broad egg noddles. Combined all in the skillet and then added generous parmesan. Cheese created a different taste than intended, but made it for us!

This was really good, I only used 1/4 cup of butter and that was still a little too much. You could easily use a couple tbls of butter along with a little olive oil and this would be much healthier and still taste really good.

Had grown cabbage in the garden this year, so I have been trying different recipes.  I thought this was very delicious, and the cabbage had a sweet tasting flavor.  Thank you for sharing, I'll definitely be making this again!

This recipe was okay but not really spectacular - probably would not make again.  too greasy and not flavorable enough to justify the calories.

I make this dish all the time (Slovak heritage) but a little differently.  Browning the butter and onions in a large skillet like my grandmother did adds a lot of flavor.  I then add shredded cabbage and fry the mix until the cabbage is a golden color.  Add the drained pasta and toss until the pasta is well coated.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was great, but it was a lot of food. If you make it as a side dish, its enough for 6 people and as a main dish, I would say about 3-4 people. I will make it again for sure and just adjust the amounts.

I halved the butter and sprinkled Parmesan cheese on top to serve.  We loved it!  A do again.  May try to lessen butter and add olive oil next time to make it healthier.  Kielbasa or sausage might be nice too  as a main meal.

I added some red pepper flakes to give it a little bit of spice and it was very good. I used whole wheat penne pasta and next time, we decided we would like to try it with spatzle.

I made this for bf and he seemed to enjoy it.  I did add sour cream and seasoned salt, which he liked.  I would've served it to  him as written, but he's used to a dish like this with bacon so I knew it wouldn't cut it for him without some additional flavoring for him.  With these few additions, though, he really liked it.  Thanks for the recipe!

I thought it was pretty good. I gave it three stars because I changed it slightly. I cut down the butter like previous reviews suggested. And then I added smoked sausage so that it would be more of a main dish. Overall though it was really good.

I used a coleslaw mix and small ziti. I also didn't need as much butter as it called for. I did add fresh ground pepper.  I thought it was good, my family did not. If I make this again, I'll do it on a smaller scale and make it just for me.

This was very tasty. I did make some alterations as suggested by others. I used a package of pre cut coleslaw to save on time, a half cup of margarine, 2 tablespoons of garlic and I added a touch of lemon pepper spice to liven it up a bit. I also used fine cut egg noddles and really thought it worked out great with this dish. It is definately a quick dish to make in the future. May try some Low fat Kielbasa sometime with this...

I thought this was good, but not great. I was trying to use up some cabbage and made this as a vegetarian dinner but it definitely needed something more to bulk it up. If used as a side dish as suggested, it would probably be fine. As per other people's suggestions, I did cut the butter down to 1/2 cup (and probably could have used 1/3) and also added a bit more garlic.

Excellent! All I added was a few more spices. Everyone added some parm cheese and salt and pepper to taste to their plate. Very easy and tasty. Great way to use up extra cabbage from the garden. We ate this by itself with some garlic bread but it would also make a great side dish for pork chops/roast. Will be making again. Maybe next time I will add some tomato for extra flavor and color. Thanks for the idea!

This didn't sound good, but i tried it because I had the ingredients & had read the rave reviews. My whole family of pick eaters loved it, going back for seconds. It was such a hit that it will be a regular for us. Cheap, easy, & tasty! I followed the recipe except used a little more seasoning and a little less butter. Made an onion & garlic free version for my husband, and even that one was yummy.

I can't fault the recipe. I also can't help but alter things. I added diced sauteed Jalapeno pepper to the vegetable mix. I used 2-3 tablespoons butter, some Olive oil and some bacon fat. Makes for a tasty mix.  I like complete meals so I put in chopped Turkey Kielbasa.

Good recipe, but I added just two more things to it: a small piece of chili to fry with the onions, garlic and cabbage, as it gives a little bit of kick, and I also mixed in PASTA WATER when adding pasta to the pan. It perfectly combines everything together and gives the pasta a smooth texture.

This was a great quick meal to make. I did change a few things like the amount of butter, I cut that amount in half. I also used a little sesame oil for extra flavor that worked out well if you like the stir fry flavor. I added a can of chicken for extra texture. Sour cream went great with this as a topping. Overall this was good meal that my family finished in no time at all.

This is a great side dish, and for a quick easy dinner I added Costco's garlic and mozzarella sausages cut up in thin slices.  It added an incredible flavor and the cheese melted a little and made a nice addition to the pasta. NOTE: I got away with using 1/4 C of butter (half a stick) and it was plenty to keep the cabbage and everything moist enough to sauté without burning or being dry (for info this was before adding the sausage that has melting cheese).  I add the sausage a few minutes before serving, just enough to warm it up. Great dish, thanks!

I just finished making this recipe almost as directed.  Way too much butter.  I would try 1/2 cup next time verus the 1 cup. I also added garlic salt, curry, and paprika.  I used "coleslaw" mix cabbage for the cabbage.  Very tastey.

I made it with red cabbage (some call it purple cabbage) and it tasted great.  I didnt use the whole portion of butter as I didnt want to feel like all I was eating was a stick of butter.  I put in a slice of butter and 2 tablespoons of olive oil for cooking in the initial directions.  After the cooking was done, I put in a slice of butter and tasted.  I kept putting in a slice of butter until I got a good buttery taste.  I must have put in one or two tablespoons of butter at the end, but each person's taste may differ so adjust accordingly.  Wished I had taken a pic of the dish to share.

This was pretty good, but nothing special.  I added chopped up chicken and cooked it with the vegetable mixture for a main dish rather than a side dish.  I think I wouldn't make it without the chicken.

Good side to meatloaf.  In fact, i mashed my meat and put it into the pasta.  I used 2 tablespoons of margerine,  used a bag of prepackaged coleslaw, and added chicken broth, parm, bacon, and franks hot sauce.

This was amazing! I'm sorry some people didn't enjoy, but I absolutely did.  This is a 'less is more'type of recipe. I used purple cabbage because I had it and needed a recipe to use it all. It required more cook time to get the cabbage tender, but came out great. I also used black bean penne pasta instead.

I have made this a few times now and it is very tasty but I did end up reducing the amount of butter. I also ended up adding smoked sausage making a meal out of it.

This is a wonderful polish dish ( Huluchski)my mother in law taught me how to make. The flavor really comes out when cabbage is cut and simmered correctly. This dish is not to be rushed, the final stage is making home made doughy noodles and dropping them in boiling salted water while cabbage is cooking, drain and combine when cabbage is almost melt in your mouth soft. We use 1/4 cup butter, salt and pepper only. Everyone wants it whenever they stop by.

I halved the recipe and used only 2 tablespoons of unsalted butter. I followed recipe exactly but needed to add about 1 1/2 cups of unsalted chicken stock to keep in moist. A tip for the cabbage...cut out the larger ribs as they take longer to soften and required an additional 10 minutes to cook.
