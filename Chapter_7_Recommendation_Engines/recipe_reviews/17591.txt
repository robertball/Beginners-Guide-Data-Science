This salad was great. I served it with the Chicken Chili Stew as part of a themed dinner. The dressing was totally addicting.

This salad was okay, I thought it could use a lot more garlic and chilies.

We really enjoyed this salad and would definitely make it again.  I too used the tortilla strips in place of croutons, and baked them in the oven with cayenne pepper and garlic salt sprinkled on them - they were excellent.

My friend is a native of Guatemala, and he loved this salad.  We tossed in some fresh avocado and a little bit more garlic.  This would be great with Queso Fresco rather than the Feta or Cotija cheese too.  We'll make this again and again!

I add about a 1/2 cup of fresh red bell peppers instead of the can of green chiles.  Very tasty.

loved this salad dressing.  It was a nice change for my family.  I used jack and cheddar cheese and drained and rinsed black beans, and it was great!  Will definately make again...

this salad is absolutely fabulous!  it's really simple to make, and the flavors blend together in a way that's wholly unexpected.  it's a great take on the traditional caesar salad!

Wonderful version of a traditional favorite. I loved the dressing, I grow cilantro in my garden and am always looking for new recipes to use it.  The cilantro and spice combination in the dressing gave this salad a very fresh taste.

Wow! I cheated a bit and used a ready made Caesar salad kit. Added a small can of chopped green chiles as well as salt, black pepper and fresh garlic to the ready made dressing. It was terrific and fresh tasting and such a refreshing twist to a sometimes heavy Caesar salad. I can see adding some lime marinated grilled chicken next time. Really liked it. Served with the Green Chili Chicken Soup (see reviews).

I would recommend leaving the chiles out of the salad-the flavor from having them both in the dressing and the actual salad was a little overpowering.

Delicious!  Just enough spice for a subtle kick and plenty of flavour.   I add fresh lime juice for a bit more tartness and garnish with chopped green onions.

This recipe was awesome!  I was cooking Mexican food for guests and I wanted a salad that had a Mexican flair to it.  This was just the right thing!  I made the recipe for 8 servings, but I could have made half of the amount of dressing and still had plenty.  So, half the dressing ingredients.
