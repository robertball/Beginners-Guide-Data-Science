This was really great with a few minor tweaks.  I looked over other greek salad recipes on this site and came up with the best dressing.  Instead of 4 tsp. of lemon juice, add 3 and 1 tsp of red wine vinegar.  For the salt and pepper, add 1/4 tsp of each.  Also, add half a green pepper chopped, kalamata olives instead of black and it comes out amazing!

Excellent salad! Stirred in just a couple heaping tbsp. of nonfat greek yogurt. I darn near ate the whole bowl. I might try it with the red wine vinegar in place of the lemon juice as other reviewers have suggested and see how that is. The longer it sits, the better it gets. NOTE: A trick Grandma taught me to help draw some of the liquid out of tomatoes is cut them the way you want them on the salad, then lay them on paper towels and sprinkle with salt. Let them sit for a bit and drain. Blot with paper towels. You do this, your salad will be less drippy.

I subsituted 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar for the olive oil and used fat-free feta.  It came out absolutely delicious with so much less fat!

Wonderful salad!  I used halved grape tomatoes and I didn't have Greek olives so I used black olives instead.  When it came to the dressing I took the advice of another reviewer and used Absolutely Fabulous Greek/House dressing scaled down to five servings.  Delicious!!!

It's nice to have a change of pace from the usual lettuce or romaine salads, so we tried this.  It was very good, and the tart lemon flavor was good.  We've had it a couple of times, and varied the size of the chopped vegetables. Try this one.

I really enjoyed this refreshing salad.  Light with the lemon dressing, which I just loved, while at the same time a little zesty with the boldness of the oregano (I used fresh).  Just as a matter of personal preference I went a little lighter on the feta and did not peel the cucumber.

Excellent!  Fresh, summery, and healthy.  Next time I may try it with fresh herbs.  All measurements are approximate in this recipe; suit to your taste.  Tip: cut the cucumbers lengthwise, then scoop out the seeds with a spoon and discard.  This keeps the salad from becoming to soupy and slimy, and gives it a crisper texture.

Great salad. I put this on torn romaine lettuce, and used calamata olives instead of the black. This was just like what you'd get from a fine greek restaurant. Thanks for the recipe.

This salad is absolutely lovely! I probably doubled the olives, but otherwise we had this unchanged. I served this with whole-wheat pita bread and hummus. We cut the pita open, speared it with hummus, filled it with salad and topped it with some chopped chard. It was amazing and SO easy. I think this is going to be a new picnic food staple for our family!

This salad is delicious!  I include thinly sliced cucumbers, red onion, red bell pepper, crumbled feta cheese, LOTS of lemon juice, extra virgin olive oil, salt/pepper, and oregano.  It's my favorite salad!

WOW! Just made this and was blown away by how good this simple recipe tastes. I'm often up late and was hungry for something quick, healthy, yet tasty and this was perfect! I don't like onions so I omitted the red onion. I didn't have feta cheese or Greek olives so I used regular sliced black olives and sprinkled a bit of parmesan on top to serve. I then remembered I had organic farfalle in the fridge and tossed some of that into my bowl to make it more filling. It was amazing! I always add pasta only when I'm ready to serve it to avoid it absorbing all of the liquid. Thank you so much for this great recipe! It's def going to be a staple. I can't wait to make it again :)

Took me less than 10 minutes, and this salad is VERY filling. So it's good for you, and you won't feel hungry for a while. I recommend it.

What a great, light salad!  Since I needed a "substantial" main dish for dinner tonight, I took the following liberties with the recipe, which turned out be amazing! First, I whisked up the dressing: olive oil, lemon juice to taste (a LOT more due to personal preference), a couple tablespoons of rice wine vinegar, some garlic/onion powders, freshly ground sea salt and black pepper, dried minced onion, and Italian seasoning to taste. I let it "marry" for a bit to soften the dried onion. I used an entire bag of butter lettuce mixed with organic baby spinach and mixed in the cucs, tomatoes, thinly diced red onions, feta cheese, and used kalamata olives just in my portion since my DH doesn't care for them. I also diced up some turkey, along with an avocado, as a topping to the salad. Much to my great surprise, the 4 year-old DD LOVED this and even liked sampling the kalamata olives. Awesome salad; one that will be repeated in this house.

Loved this salad! I liked it so much that I went back for a 2nd helping and ate all the rest myself (too bad for my hubby)!  Next time I try this, I'll add a few boiled shrimp to the mix and serve as an entree instead of an appetizer.

Fabulous! I made this to go with Gnocchi and Baked Chicken. The 2 little girls I made it for loved it. But asked if I'd make it with extra greek olives...so to my delight I was glad they loved the olives...there's just not enough in the recipe. But as well as they asked me to make it again...with out so much onion. But it's was so easy to make, and simple to put together. I'll make it for the gals in the house...the boys don't like tomatoes and onions...so I don't thing they know what they are missing. TYVM!

EXCELLENT! added a yellow & an orange bell pepper for a little more zip. Extra olives & cucumber were good too (one can never have too many). Would be perfect for a potluck- colorful & presents well. I bet it will be even better leftover tomorrow!

Loved this recipe!  I used grape tomatoes and added 1/4 of a green pepper chopped.  I omitted the onions as I don't like them.  I went with other reviewers' suggestion and made my dressing of 3 tsp. lemon juice, 1 tsp. red wine vinegar, and only 1 tsp. dried oregano.  Will make again!  UPDATE:  I made this salad again and instead of making the dressing with this recipe I used the "Absolutely Fabulous Greek/House Dressing" from this site.  Was even better!  Definitel recommend the dressing change!!

This was very good, even my 6 yr old son loved it!  Next time I make it I will definitely salt & drain the cucumbers 1st.  It got very watery after a few hours in the fridge. A tip I used with a different cucumber recipe was to line a bowl w/paper towels, add the cut up cucumbers and lightly salt them and put them back in the fridge until you need to use them.  Just remove the wet paper towels and make your salad in the same bowl.  Next time I make this I will try the Absolutely  fabulous Greek/House Dressing form this website.  That dressing is amazing and would go with this so nicely!

Delicious recipe that was well received by both adults and kiddos.  Perfect for a hot summer dinner or weekend brunch.  Does not 'keep' well, so be sure to enjoy this dish the day you make it.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

This salad turned out great. I halved everything using 2 roma tomatoes, 1/2 large cucumber, thinly sliced, 1/2 small purple onion, 1 1/2 T. olive oil, 2 tsp. lemon juice, 1/2 t. salt, 1/4 tsp black pepper, a pinch of organo, about 1/2 cup feta cheese and 6 olives, quartered. I whisked together the olive oil, lemon juice, salt & pepper and tossed the cut up veggies to coat.  I refrigerated the salad for about 30 minutes while I prepared the rest of dinner. Just before serving I added a couple of cups of chopped romain lettuce. It made 4 "side dish" servings. Definitely a recipe to use over and over again.

Excellent salad.  I increased the oregano to 1 tsp. Changed the onion to a red onion and used a 4 oz. can of sliced black olives.  There will be no leftovers.

This salad was delicious! My husband and I were getting tired of our same old salads, and this was so easy to make and will definitely be added to our dinner line up. We decided to use the advice in the reviews and we added 1tsp red wine vinegar, and then added in some marinated articokes. If you don't have to run to the store for some ingredients, like we did, this wouldn't take more than 10 minutes to make! Delicious!

It was good, but it needed a hair more flavor.  It was a little too bland.  I'll probably add some red wine vinegar with it to give it more.  Otherwise, simple, easy, and a good starting point.

OMG, this salad was so awesome.  I made some pork chops with feta cheese and some other Greek flavors so I thought that I would give this salad a try.  It was sooo delicious.  There was some left over so I kept it and the next day the salad was even better. You should make this salad ASAP.

This was wonderful as written. The Greek olives are a bit pricy, but serve a purpose in keeping this tasting authentic. The only change that I made was to use goat cheese instead of feta because of personal preference. I will probably only use 1/2 small onion next time I make this. The onion was a bit overpowering. So easy and quick to prepare, also. Thank you for posting this.

I used about 1/3 c. diced red onion and less oil on this salad.  Though not a true fan of oregano, I included it, but next time I will sub dill instead, and add more olives.  This is a colorful, chunky salad, and I liked the combination of tomato, cucumber and feta.

We had this as a side dish with dinner tonight.  We had plenty of cucumbers in the garden.  It was very good.  We followed the directions as written, although we used more olives than listed.  This was better and more flavorful than other cucumber-based salads we have tried.  This probably won't be a regular in our rotation, but we will probably make it once or twice a season.

So good! Make sure to buy the pitted greek olives or this will be time consuming. The only change I make is to add spinach and use reduced fat feta.

This was delicious.  I left out the kalamata olives because they were really expensive. The cheapest jar I found was on sale for $5.99.  Without the olives I thought this was great!

Very good , a bit different than the Greek salad I'm used to. I never chop the ingredients, but usually slice thin and pile on top of romaine lettuce. I tried this for something different, but I did use red wine vinegar instead of the lemon juice. Personally, I think the vinegar makes a Greek salad, although I did use lemon before and it's good, the vinegar is  a personal preference. I used reduced-fat feta cheese and instead of the oregano, used Greek seasoning which has oregano, spearmint and sea salt. I did serve this on top of chopped romaine because this was a meal, served with pita bread. I also had to use black olives, but kalamata olives make all the difference. To me, you can't go wrong with a Greek salad, as it is my favorite. I will use this again for sure without the lettuce for a nice lunch. Thanks for the recipe :)

Great summer salad. I dont care for pasta- so I like this salad because it is low carb. Used light feta, 1/4 cup red onion. I seeded the tomatoes and cucumber and cut into small pices. Served with a pasta salad.  I used this dressing based on another cook: 2T lemon juice, 2T red wine vinegar 1/4t each salt and peper 3T EVOO 1 1/2 t dried oregano. I chilled salad before serving.

Very good.  Don't be tempted to substitute a yellow onion for the red onion if you don't have red on hand.  Yellow onion would completely overpower this dish.  Concur with the other reviewers who suggested 3t lemon juice/1t red wine vinegar instead of the 4t of lemon juice.  Finally, I found 1 1/2t of oregano to be a little much, I'll drop to 1 teaspoon next time I make this/

Very good. I like a bit more seasoning. Best when served right away or else it gets souply due to the tomato juice.

An excellent Greek salad but, as someone else said, I don't see how it's healthier than any other Greek salad... Combining oil, feta and olives has never made a low fat dish! For an healthier (yet tasty) version, omit olive oil and use reduced fat feta cheese.

I was looking for salads to serve in pitas for a shower.  We served this (along with Becky's Chicken Salad) and both were a big hit. I chunked the vegatables generously and it turned out great! 

I drain the bowl a couple of times--between the tomotoes (I did not seed) and the oil it collected liquid on the bottom and did not want this to make the pitas soggy.  

We served it with an orange coucous salad and Terra chips--one of the most well received menues we have had!

This salad is yummy.  My kids won't eat it but my husband and I love it.  I serve it with greek chicken from this site.  I also leave out the olives as neither my husband or I like them.

This was DELICIOUS even though I subbed fresh spinach for the cucumber (didn't have any).  Do not exceed the recommended amount of lemon juice or it will be too sour.  Mine was borderline too sour, but still good.

This is better than the restaurant variety.  Must use the Kalamata olives though.  For the dressing I used Greek Oregano.  Delicious anytime, but especially good with grilled meats.

I am not a big tomato fan, but I enjoyed this salad.  No one flavor was overpowering.  This would be a nice salad to serve when having company instead of a typical green salad.

This is a pretty good recipe for Greek Salad.  It sure is nice and easy.  However, there was something lacking in the flavour that I miss from getting Greek Salad eating out.  I am not sure exactly what it was though.  :)  Nevertheless, this is a very tasty recipe, but just needed that extra something to get a five star rating from me.

Mmm I loved this salad. I used the green onions recommended by the submitter, and my olives were kalamata marinated in wine and herbs (just on my half, none for DBF!) I found this very refreshing and a beautiful presentation (I sliced instead of chopped and layered instead of tossed). Going into the summer rotation of 'too hot to cook and must get rid of the cucumbers' :)

The only greek salad recipe I will use. I added a tsp or so of Epicure's greek seasoning to the dressing. Great for potlucks etc especially as it makes a ton of food.

Loved it.  The second time a made a few changes:  1. Used Kalamata Greek olives in place of black olives.   2.  Added 1T red wine vinegar.     3.  Made sure the tomatoes were well drained by placing on a paper towel for 5 minutes before adding to salad mixture.    4.  Made sure all ingredients were cold before tossing together and serving.      
I can't stress enough how important it is to use the freshest of lettuce for this salad.  The cold crunch is so important to the over all experience.  My husband commented on how delicious the flavors were and asked for it again tomorrow!

Excellent.   Just a hint, you can omit the oil and lemon and use a jar of feta cheese in oil and use that as the dressing.  I've tried it and it tastes amazing.

Exactly what I wanted to use up to extra cukes and tomatoes from the garden.  So good!  Added extra olives, lemon juice and some red wine vinegar as well.

I added one green pepper, fresh oregano and fresh parsley and used some brine from the kalamata olives. Fantastic!

Very tasty, didn't have Greek olives but regular black olives were very good. I did use fresh oregano and grape tomatoes from my garden. Made about five hours before serving and stored in fridge turning bowl to let the flavors marinate together. Thought I had some feta cheese but kids must have eaten it so grated some Romano and it worked well.

This was a very good tasting salad that went well with the soulaki I made.  I used a little less feta cheese as I don't like too much feta taste.  I also added extra olives because I love them. This would be an excellent recipe in the summer when fresh tomatoes and cucumbers are in season.

This was good, but the raw onions were too much for us.  Might swap with green onions if I make this again.

You really can't go wrong with tomatoes, cucumber, olives, onion, feta and avocado (I had to add the avo - I love them so)! I used the Absolutely Fabulous Greek Dressing from this site and it was a perfect side salad!

A great mix of flavors. I let my tomatoes drain, but there was still too much liquid which made the overall presentation too juicy.

Is this great or what? Just the right balance of veggies and dressing. I really did think "Greek Salad". The DH loved it too, and he is not much of a salad eater! Easy to prep and hold for hours in the fridge. You can toss together and serve in a minute. Thank you Jen!

I absolutely adore this salad! I don't think it would be the same if you didn't have fresh tomatoes and cucumbers so it should probably only be enjoyed in the summer. It didn't even take me fifteen minutes to throw this together and it was delicious! I took others advice to reduce the olive oil and add red wine vinegar to cut down on calories and also used a vidalia onion and NO olives because I hate them! I bet this will be even better as leftovers since the flavors will have more time to combine. Yummy! I'll make this often since I have a surplus of tomatoes and cucumbers. Note: I only sprinkled the feta on each individual serving so the leftovers will still taste fresh.

This was pretty good. Although, I had to spice it up a bit. I added some greek seasoning in addition to the oregano. Next time, I would definately replace the greek black olives with kalamata olives, I thought the black olives (in olive oil) were a weird texture and didn't really add anything to the recipe favor-wise. I would also add some variety of vinegar. Perhaps balsamic or red wine. Overall, a good starting point. Thanks!

We love this!  I actually have been making it on my own for months before seeing this recipe.  The only difference with mine is that we toss this all with lettuce - not so Greek, I know, but we like it.  We also omit the oregano quite often.  My kids even love this salad.  We top our Greek tacos with this.  This is especially good with fresh produce from your own garden!

What a WONDERFUL way to enjoy summer veggies - took me back to my summer in greece!  I used grape tomatoes (my favorite), sweet onion (only a little - not a big fan), and did not peel the cucumber (cut into thick slices then quartered).  I also ommitted the olives.  The dressing is great - I made it ahead and kept it separate until ready to serve.  Left-overs aren't the best because the cucumber tends to get mushy.  I made it for a party last weekend and plan to make it again this weekend - just for us!  I can't wait until my "home grown" tomatoes are ready!

Very very good. I followed the directions to the "t" the first time and took it to a picnic. Everyone loved it, but I thought I could tweak it just a bit. After that I played with the recipe here and there, and found a little balsamic vinegar really kicked it up a notch, as well as using kalameta olives. I also seeded my cukes and usually let it sit several hours before digging in. I made this several times a week this summer with produce from the garden and kept a big brick of feta in the fridge to break off some for this salad. Delish!

This is extremely good. I made it as stated in the recipe, except I didn't have red onion and thought a yellow onion might be too strong, so I used a shallot. I think it's better than the Greek salad our Greek restaurant serves. I wanted to make a meal out of this, so I made some orzo pasta with lemon juice and olive oil and chickpeas and served this salad over top of the pasta mixture. So healthy and tasty--I just loved it. I'll be making this often.

Just okay.  It was saved by the feta and greek olives.  Otherwise, it would have been fairly bland.  But, as the title boasts, at least it is healthful!

I made this tonight for my brother and I and we both loved it! Didn't make any changes (except garnishing with coriander) as the recipe was just perfect! We didn't have naan so used chappati instead which just as good. Will definitely make this again =]

My only change to it was to add more than 6 olives - but I love olives!

Wowza! This salad was delicious, refreshing and filling! I added 2 teaspoons of lemon juice and 2 teaspoons of red wine vinegar.  This is a restaurant quality recipe and we will be making this regularly!

This is a really good recipe that I will add to my rotation. The only changes I made wa to substitute fresh oregano in place of dried, and I added a couple of tablespoons of balsamic vinegar to the dressing to give it more flavour. Thanks for sharing!

Very nice combination of fresh ingredients, but do not make this salad too far in advance or it will turn watery and the cucumbers will look tired even if kept in the refrigerator. Also, do not add the feta cheese until ready to serve or it will turn milky.

This is amazing the first day! I used 2 lg tomatoes 3 cuc. half a scallion. You need to eat as much as possible the first day not as good the second. That's the reasoning for the 4 stars. leftovers are not as tastey.

I have made this several times over this past summer.  I have been blessed with ample tomatoes and cucumbers in my garden.  This is probably my favorite lite go to salad.  Do not leave out the oregano as it is not the same!  I have done the recipe with lemon juice, and with lemon juice and red wine vinegar.  I prefer it with the red wine vinegar.  Excellent recipe!! Will continue to use until I run out of vegies!

Salad is wonderful - super easy and delicious. I like more zesty, zingy dressing so I used a store bought Greek dressing and some balsamic vinegar.

Great, simple recipe! Used the juice of one lemon and a drizzle of olive oil. Did not add vinegar as some suggested (don't think it needed it after the lemon). Also used peppercorn feta from Aldi-which was perfect! The flavors were refreshing and it was very filling, though I didn't feel guilty about my meal afterward :)

Really easy and yummy!  Comments above that said the dressing smelled bad... I wonder if they used fresh lemon juice and GOOD olive oil.  This is the perfect thing to make ahead of time for lunches :)

The tomatoes were mushy & this didn't really have a lot of taste to it.  Perhaps some fresh herbs would have made it better, but the recipe as is is lacking in my opinion.

Overall, this was good not great. It was a little watery after about 5 hours in the refrigerator.  I didn't add the olives and felt that it needed a little more punch to it (maybe the olives would have given it the punch).

An excellent salad, quickly put together. I recommend seeding the cucumber after peeling (scoop out the seeds with a spoon after cutting in half length-wise). Also, I used my immersible blender on the dressing, worked beautifully in keeping the dressing from separating!

Such a great blend of flavors in this Greek salad! Made according to the recipe, except I used jarred peppercini rings instead of black olives. As is, it makes a lovely side salad. To turn it into a delicious main dish: add cheese tortellini, feta, and "Greek Style Garlic Chicken". Top with Balsalmic Vinegarette. Healthy & delicious!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  It was light and refreshing, just what I needed during a hot summer.  I used red wine vinegar instead of lemon juice because it's what I had and didn't change the other ingredients.  It was delicious and I'll be sure to make it over and over.

Killer salad!  I only had ingredients for the dressing, tomatoes, feta, and onion but it was still AWESOME.  I was very impressed with how this was an exact match for my favorite Greek salad in St. Louis.  Next time, I'll plan ahead and be sure to include everything!

Really tasty. I did take a previous reviewer's suggestion and replaced 1 tsp of lemon juice with red wine vinegar, also I used kalamata olives and grape tomatoes. The red onion can dominate if there's too much, so I might use less next time. But it was a nice change of pace for a salad!

we really enjoyed this.. used Absolutely Fabulous Greek/House Dressing from this site.. subtracted one tomato.. substituted green onion for the red, kalamata olives for the black, and garlic and herb flavored feta for the plain.. ty so much for the recipe.. UPDATE: made this again today with the red onion and the extra tomato and made sure to seed them.. this time added a bit of sliced pepperoncini.. love how versatile this can be

This was my first attempt at a Greek Salad and it was delicious! The only thing I added was romaine lettuce chopped in strips, because I like lettuce in all my salads where possible. I waited until just before serving to add the dressing and it was a hit!

This is a wonderful salad. I put a teaspoon of balsalmic vinegar in place of 1 teaspoon of lemon juice used greek seasoning and put it in a blender then added olive oil to make a emulsified dressing. it reminds me of gazpacho except it's a salad not soup! Delish.

This was easy to make and delicious! I made a 1/2 recipe and got 3 small or 2 large servings. The deli at my grocery store had greek olives already pitted. I used an English cucumber, which I like the peel on it, saving a step. I liked that the salad was not loaded with dressing like others I have tasted. Plus, I didn't have to use a separate bowl to mix the dressing which was nice. The only thing I did different was use about 1/2 the onion suggested. I will make this again. It will go great with some grilled chicken.

This is almost exactly the same recipe that I make but instead of the lemon juice I use balsamic vinegar and it gives it a great flavor. I also throw in garlic powder, basil, and sometimes peppers if I have them on hand. Our family loves it! Never use black or green olives unless that is all you have. Greek or kalamata olives are the BEST!

This dish is delicious.  The only thing I will do differently next time, and there will be a next time, is to seed the cukes.  The salad got a bit watery so seeding will keep that from happening again.  Easy, refreshing, tasty.

I first tried greek salad a few weeks ago at a buffet, and was thrilled to find recipes for it on here.  This was close to what I tried, but I didn't care for the lemon juice, so when I made it again I used 2 teaspoons of balsamic vinegar instead and it was exactly like I had tried in the restaurant.  I also made it with Armenian Cucumbers because its what I had, but it was perfect.

Great recipe! Definitely cut down on the onion a bit. I cut mine up really small, so as to not have overwhelmingly large chunks. But, that releases more of the onion juice, which can out-flavor the other things. A little less of the pungent flavor makes room for a lot more of the refreshing and cool tomato/cucumber combo. Very tasty as a side or right on your main course. (I used leftovers on a portabella panini--awesome!)

This was a very good salad! I didn't have a cucumber, so I used a green bell pepper instead. I omitted the onion and the black olives, just a preference and for the dressing I made "Absolutely Fabulous Greek/House Salad" from this site.

This was a fabulous fresh salad to have on those hot humid nights. The feta cheese and olives are the key. Make a double batch and let marinate overnight for a picnic. The flavors mature as it sets.

I thought this was a great starting point for a very light summer side dish.  I needed a main course for a few friends so I started with this and added a little grilled chicken (that was left over in the fridge), macaroni salad pasta and a bit of romain lettuce chopped small.  I stilled allowed the cucmbers and tomatoes to be the main event by adding less pasta, lettuce and chicken than I did cucumbers and tomatoes. It was a huge hit!

This is an attractive and delicious salad that's very easy to make.  I served it with the Ab Fab Greek House dressing from this site.  I bought a red onion just for this recipe and forgot to add it...it was still wonderful!  Thanks for the recipe, Jen!

We loved the dressing from this! We just cut up a bunch of veggies, tossed it with romaine lettuce, some feta and olives.  Even our toddler gobbled it up.

On another round of this we found that there wasn't enough acidity to the dressing.  If you don't serve it with the olives and cheese it's very plain.

Great salad, but I prefer Balsamic Vinagret as a dressing. This is the only way I like red onions. One day I will try it with white onions!

This salad was excellent. I thought to myself that I was silly for following a recipe for a salad (just throw veggies in a bowl!!), but so glad I did. I really get sick of lettuce based salads, so this fit the bill perfectly. I used, by accident, way more olives than the recipe called for, but my husband and I love olives so it was perfect mistake. I will make this again, most definitely.

really loved this.  I made this for something to take to work for lunch for a few days.  I didn't have the greek olives so I used green spanish olives (which I love) and next time I would cut the cucumber in bigger bites since they were the first ingredient to become mushy before I had finished eating all of it.

Very easy and good. I added cooled tri-color rotini pasta to it. I also used a little more lemon juice (I love the tart flavor) and I left out the olives (don't like them). I also used halved grape tomatoes (I like them better, and it didn't seem to get as runny the next day). My husband loved it. I will def. be making this again!!

You'd never know it was so "good for you"-- the flavor of the lemon juice is not over-powering like vinegar.  However, I love vinegar so I put a smidgen of pomegranate-blush vinegar.  I didn't have red onions so I subbed green onions-- which surprisingly wasn't bad.  I'd give this one a 10-star rating if I could.  Definitely a keeper in our regular family menu.

Why can't all simple recipes taste this good? I used a little less olive oil and added a teaspoon of red wine vinegar. So good! Thanks!

This is very similar to a salad I began making after a trip to New York City.  The only differences I would suggest is using English cucumbers (seedless) and not peeling them.  I also use Kalamata Olives and halved Cherry tomatoes.  I mix my dressing using Lemon Olive oil (of course you could just use olive oil and lemon juice) and White Balsamic Vinegar.  I set the feta aside for picky eaters and allow my guests to sprinkle it on top of their salad.  This also keeps the feta nice and crumbly instead of melting into the dressing.  This has been a hit everywhere I take it and even picky eaters love it.  Sometimes, for a larger salad, I'll add a bag of chopped Romaine Lettuce.

Pretty good.  It probably didn't need as much olive oil.  The next time I make this, I would scale back to 3/4 of the amount recommended.

I've tried the recipe as written before, but I prefer a little red wine vinegar.  I did not have that on hand tonight, so I used 2 splashes of balsalmic vinegar and that sufficed, but made the salad take on a ugly appearance.  Thank you for sharing!

Loved this recipe.  I was looking for a light Greek salad recipe and this is a great one.  I did add iceburg lettuce and green pepper to the salad.  I also added a splash of red wine vinegar to the lemon juice.  A keeper.

I served this at a party we had recently. I borrowed cook in trainings idea of filling pittas with it, I arranged the pittas around the salad and then filled them as people wanted so it wouldn't get soggy.The dressing was really good . I did omit the olives. Guests enjoyed this. Thanks

Refreshing. Perfect in pita bread for lunch. I made it exactly as written. EDIT TO ADD:  I made it a second time. This time I added a tsp of lime juice, a clove of garlic, and extra salt to make up for not having the salty feta cheese. I served it on salty tortilla chips. Still very good, even without the cheese.

I added 1 Tbspn of distilled white vinegar to this recipe only because the salads like this in the North Texas are are prepared like this and it was amazing. My guests plowed through it and although I doubled the recipe some ate this by itself in lieu of the giant cheeseburgers I cooked over hickory. I would absolutely recommend this recipe...vinegar or not.

Came out great!  I like someone suggested only put in 3T fresh lemon juice and 1T of red wine vinegar.  I also added in the oregano,salt and pepper with the mix, tossed and refrigerated covered for a few hours.  I used Mediterranean flavored feta.

Absolutely delicious! Almost exactly like the Greek salad I get when I go out to a Greek restaurant an hour from my house.  Yum.

Thank you for sharing!  This recipe is delicious, even the kids love it. I have made it exactly as is, or sometimes I substitute the lemon juice with balsamic vinegar, it tastes great using either one.

I enjoyed this as a base - I added in more flavor and it was still a little bland. I did add in a handful of spinach and 2 cans of albacore tuna, so I can have it as a stand alone meal. Perhaps swap Mediterranean flavored feta cheese, basil and add Italian seasoning/dressing packet. lots of creative options and makes enough for me to take to work for a couple of days. Refreshing. Thanks for the share!

This was amazing.  You can reduce the calories even more by cutting back on the oil, cheese and olives.  It will be a new staple in our house.

This salad was exceptionally good!! I pretty much stayed true to the recipe too. Only variances: I had to use Bleu cheese stuffed green olives because the store was out of kalamatas and I completely forgot the dried oregano until this am! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!

Had to make do with what I had around, so yellow onion and Italian shredded cheese, but that's not too bad. Also used fresh Asian basil instead of oregano. Very flavorful and very easy. Two of my favorite things!

This salad is fantastic. I now make it about every three days and have some every day, and will continue to do so as long as fresh vegetables are available at the local Farmers' Market. 

Although perfect as is, I add more olives--an entire can of black greek, and an entire jar of Kalamata, chopped. I also add dill along with the oregano. 

I sometimes add grilled chicken, which is awesome with this salad. Can't get enough of it! Thank you!

We thought this was an excellent, light side dish to our meal. I removed the seeds from both the tomatoes & cucumber & gave them lots of time to drain after dicing. I don't ordinarily like raw tomatoes & onions, but I'll eat them in this dish! We will make this again. Thank you for the recipe.

I love this recipe. I eat this as a meal or a snack. 
I use a little less onion and add whole Kalamata olives. 
In a pinch, sub the seasonings for Italian salad dressing. Quick and easy!  
Also, if you let this sit, the tomatoes will start to break down. If you don't like the liquid, either drain it or eat it right away.

I have made this numerous times now although usually for two people so I adjust the quantities.  I don't typically change a thing otherwise although it is a salad so easy to swap an item or two or throw in an extra.  I don't think it needs it.  What I like about it is that it is so quick to prepare and that it isn't full of lettuce or kale of spinach or any other leaf like most salads available in the grocery store.  You don't feel like a rabbit eating this one.

We enjoyed this salad, I had some Romaine lettuce to use up so I placed that on the bottom, then the rest of the ingredients on top, I also mixed the salad dressing up in the morning to let it sit, I added a pinch of sugar as I found it a little acidic.

I added 1/3 of the onion it called for because I was using really flavorful heirloom tomatoes and didn't want the onion overpowering it. I also served the olives on the side because 1/2 of our kiddos don't like kalamata olives (weird, I know) thanks for a quick and easy yet tasty recipe.

Made it as-is, and it was so good! I was a little scared to try it because I'm not a huge fan of olives, cucumbers, or tomatoes, but everything went together so well! Mmmm! So simple and so healthy!

This is a very good, healthy recipe! I made a few alterations. 
 I used an English cucumber (scooped out the seeds), halved cherry tomatoes, kalamata olives and crumbled gorgonzola cheese.
Otherwise I followed the recipe as given.  I will be making this again!

Excellent recipe, and it didn't last long in our house! I added half of a chopped green pepper as one reviewer recommended, and substituted 2 tbsp of lemon juice for 2 tbsp of red wine vinegar. (so I used 2 tbsp fresh lemon juice and 2 tbsp red wine vinegar.) I used garden fresh ingredients and kalamata olives in place of black olives. Delicious!

So good!  The adjustments I made were to add a small amount of red and yellow peppers, I cut the amount of lemon juice a little and added a little red wine vinegar, and I used Greek Seasoning (that's what it's called) instead of pepper.  

I couldn't wait to eat it but I'll bet it's better on day two.

I made this salad to accompany Chef John's Greek Lemon Chicken and Potatoes that I made for dinner tonight, and it went perfect with it! I really just eye-balled the ingredients, and used white wine vinegar in place of the lemon juice. Refreshing summer side salad, and one that I'll make again.

First of all I feel you can't really rate a recipe if you don't follow it. I'm all for being creative in cooking but I always try to make it as directed first. And that's what I did. It was very flavorful. Only reason I gave it 4 stars is because mine got super watery. I brought it to a BBQ and it was like soup on the bottom when I got there. Not sure what I did wrong. I will try this again for sure!

Make it a real Greek salad:  lose the black olives; use calamata greek olives' and add finely chopped sweet basil, mint and touch of oregano, and of course use good quality feta cheese. Also red peppers are always better than green peppers. Greek or Italian dressing made with real extra virgin olive oil   ok, with a touch of lemon juice. otherwise, not bad for "Gringos".

I love this - I love it SO much that I've made it three times in two weeks and ate it all myself. I did split the amount of lemon juice with red wine vinegar and tend to add any extra veggies I have on hand (celery works really well) but can't thank you enough for the recipe. It's wonderful!
(I wonder how some Louisiana muffuletta olive salad would work in place of the olives........I guess I'll give it a shot next time)

Great just as the recipe calls for! For an added twist you can add chilled beets, banana peppers or hot peppers. I use this salad for our "salad day" of the week and it never gets boring. We do sometimes drop the oil and lemon and use a great greek dressing.

It was good, not great.  It's probably because I'm an inexperienced cook.  The onion was harsh...a milder onion might have been better.  It looked pretty amateurish, a hodgepodge of ingredients not nearly as nice as the picture.

I made this salad exactly as written except I was out of lemons so didn't have lemon juice.  I served this ontop of torn Romaine. Since I didn't have Lemon juice , I just used my normal homemade dressing which is a blend of olive oil, apple cider vinegar and honey. It was very good but I am looking forward to making it again with the lemon juice. Oh yeah, I added some sliced avacado on my salad (not greek but love avocado) and it was delicious.

I love this! I wasn't too thrilled about all the onions, not my favorite, but it is so tasty. And it's easy to make.

Loved this and will be making it often.  Made a few changes based on other reviews.  Subbed 1 tsp of red wine vinegar in for a tsp of the lemon juice, also used kalamata olives instead of black and a lot more of them.

I used cherry tomatoes cut in half, mini cukes sliced, the juice of 1 lemon and the same amount of red wine vinegar, added some lemon pepper and extra oregano. This was delicious, thank you

I made this today and served it with the Absolutely Fabulous Greek/House Dressing as others suggested for a church function. I doubled the recipe and worried I'd made too much. To my delight, it was gobbled up and enjoyed. I will be making this again and again.

Yum, simple and a great compliment to our falafel meal :) I made as written and then added a TBS of red wine vinegar because I felt like it was missing something. I will leave the vinegar out next time and add some dill pickle chips.

This is a great summer salad, and I t refrigerates well for a couple of days. The only change I made, was to try grape seed oil - I have a bottle of it that I was trying to get rid of and I'm glad I tried it. The grape seed oil made it even lighter and lent itself to the flavors of the veggies.

i liked this recipe which was easy.  I eliminated the olives b/c I don't care for them and added some extra feta cheese, but my family was not as enthused as I was.  I will try cutting down the feta and trying it again this week.

This is a great salad to use up those abundant home garden vegetables. The flavor is bright and crisp. I had been looking for a good cucumber salad and this one is my favorite so far.

I made this last night and as some others did, I used red wine vinegar in place of lemon juice. I also added chopped bell pepper and I used both black olives and kalamata olives. Love it!

I love this recipe. It has become my go-to Greek salad recipe. The only change I have made is that I like to add peppers, green or red, whatever I have. Other than that, this is a huge favorite!

Very yummy.  I put in a bunch of fresh parsley and more olives than the recipe calls for.  I make this almost every week in the summer.

I love this and make it all the time now. My two-year-old son is also a huge fan. I use halved grape tomatoes, add red wine vinegar in addition to the lemon juice, use kalamata olives (several more than the recipe calls for), and also use fresh oregano whenever possible.

I LOVE this salad!! I have made it twice this week. I cut back on all the ingredients, just to make my lunch for the day. But if there was a get together, I would follow the recipe. I did add a touch of red wine vinegar and  made no other changes . It is SOOOOOO good!!! :)

5.5.16   I did remove the seeds from the cucumber and used fresh oregano instead of dried, otherwise, followed the recipe to the letter.  This is a  delicious and fresh salad exactly as written, and I wouldn't change a thing, perfect amounts of all ingredients.

Made a nice lunch. Made just for myself, so didn't bother measuring the vegetables. 
Made the dressing in a Mason jar(with the addition of 2 cloves of garlic minced, and a small squeeze of Dijon mustard). 
Will keep the salad dressing for future salads this week. 
Will make again.

I peeled the cucumbers before cutting them and used regular olives instead of black olives. I ate it over a bed of romaine lettuce and it was excellent

I made this today exactly as the recipe was written, other than putting it on top of a bed of red leaf lettuce.-- as for my taste lettuce always adds to any (even a greek) salad.   It was fantastic and light and knowing what was in it--quite healthy.   This will become standard pot-luck salad for me .

Love it! I don't like olives, so I don't put them in.  I also add a small amount of tortellini just to make it feel like a main course.  So yummy! Other than that I make it exactly as listed.  I am trying to put together a lineup of healthy but very tasty dishes to vary throughout the week.  This made the cut!  I also love the black bean salad with corn, red peppers and avacado.  Between those, and some healthy soups and salads, I have a good mix!

I followed another reviewers suggestion and replaced 1 Tbsp. of the lemon juice with 1 Tbsp. red wine vinegar. I also increased the feta to 1.5cups and I get lots of rave reviews! This is great as a potluck item, and it's also great to prepare at the beginning of the week to help you create healthy meals all week long. I can't wait to try some wrapped up in a pita with hummus and tzatziki...yum! Also, I have used both 1 and 2 cucumbers and both have been fine. I also use approximately 1 pint of cherry tomatoes, halved, instead of the chopped tomatoes as it yields far less juice and is a tad easier to prepare. All in all, a great recipe and one of my favorites!!!

I made this salad for my family last night with the pork chops italiano and they loved it. We will have it again with pasta. But now I am finding out that it drains out water over night and it's really only excellent the day it's made. It gets 5 stars for taste, and 2 stars for storing.

I'm not real big on lettuce, so when I came across this recipe, I knew I had to try it!  It's so delicious, and as several other reviews have said, the longer it sits, the better it gets, and because there is no lettuce, there is nothing to wilt.  I've added fresh baby spinach as well as mixing a little Greek yogurt to the dressing.  It's the only Greek salad I'll ever make from now on

I used this recipe as a base, I just changed things up a little. I used 3 large tomatoes- chopped into chunks, 2 large cucumbers- also chopped into chunks, 1 can of sliced olives, 1 small red onion- chopped, 1 cup of crumbled feta cheese, and a 1/2 cup of salted sunflower seeds. I then dribbled a little cold pressed olive oil and lemon juice on the mixture. Then I added a good amount of McCormick brand gourmet collection Greek Seasoning (It has spearmint in it!), Dill Weed, and black pepper to taste. I put this mixture on a bed of romaine lettuce and fresh spinach leaves. To die for! ;)

Very good. Used the suggestion of adding some red wine vinegar -- just a few sprinkles.  I used Kalamata olives but think I'll use plain black olives next time because the other add too much tang and takes away from the dressing flavor.

A delicious salad, that is very refreshing.  I did omit the olives, due to our personal taste. I mixed up the ingredients in the morning and added the feta right before serving. This paired nicely with  'Chicken Shawarmas' and 'Buttery Pecan Green Beans' both from AR.

This is fabulous - a great mix of flavors that you can change up a bit.  I used balsamic vinegar and oil once..  loved it. The next time I put in all in with a mixed grain and lentil combo and added a lime vinegrette and oil. Sometimes I add basil, sometimes oregano.  Its really versatile!

My favorite thing to eat is a good salad. This recipe is one of the best greek salads I have eaten. Along with other reviewers, I did add a splash of cider vinegar but otherwise followed directions perfectly. What a nice dish.

This salad was really good and everyone liked it. We only had one cucumber and a lot of small heirloom tomatoes, so we had to guess what was a good amount. We added half the oil and the juice of one lemon. We also added a cubed avocado and left out the olives because we didn't have any. We didn't have a red onion, only yellow onions, and it was very strong, so I soaked the chopped onion in water for about 10 minutes before adding it to the salad.

Made this last night and it was a treat.  Many years since I made a Greek salad.  only change was a touch of freshly minced garlic and about 2 tblspn of red wine vinegar and two green peppers.  Mixed the salad mid afternoon and refridgerated it.  Also mixed the dressing at the same time but left it off the salad until just before serving.  Tossed lightly

I used kalamata olives instead of black Greek olives. I also add quinoa to it also to make it more filling. When cooking the quinoa use any type of broth to give it more flavor. I used chicken broth because I was serving the salad with pork chops.

This recipe was a huge hit with my family rangiing in dietary needs and age.  From dieters, vegetarians, diabetics, little kids, and junk food lovers. I couldn't believe it.  This is my new ho to salad!

Eating this as I type. I'm on Coumadin and we aren't allowed green leafy veggies so this was perfect a salad without greens! The only thing I added was a little bell pepper because I love the crunch of it and a little garlic powder to the "dressing". Very light and yummy! So hard for us on Coumadin to eat our veggies because so many of them aren't allowed. Glad I found this recipe!

this is surprisingly delicious!! I gave it a 4 because I found the lemon juice lacking a little tang, so I added about 1  1/2 tsps to it. otherwise everything else the same! will definitely make this again!

I decided to serve this salad with a bag of romaine lettuce added. I bumped up the amount of the acid elements to stretch the dressing to cover the additional leaves in the recipe. The lettuce added some bulk and is great for plumping it out as a full meal or for feeding additional people as a side dish. I also changed the composition of the dressing a bit by using half lemon juice, half red wine vinegar (2 tbsp. each instead of 4 tsp. lemon juice) and substituted kalamata olives for the black olives, just because I like them better. Delicious base for a Greek salad, and very quickly and easily prepared. I will be making this often!

This is a great classic recipe. I put a little less olive oil than called for. Love the feta and olives with the cucumbers and tomatoes!

Not bad! While nothing compares to a fresh salad at one of Chicago's well-known Greek restaurants, this was a pretty darn good! Other than the dressing being a *tad* bitter for my liking, I really enjoyed this. I didn't detect the bright, citrus note that I am accustomed to, but I think that may gave been my fault.... I used the juice of a Meyer lemon and think that may be the reason my dressing didn't turn out as I had hoped it would (FYI, Meyer lemons have a sweeter, less acidic flavor than the common supermarket variety). To make this salad a bit more "authentic," I did a little doctoring (I know, I know...). I sliced my cucumber and onion, cut my tomatoes into wedges, added a few peperoncini peppers and tossed everything with crisp Iceberg lettuce - voila! I can now enjoy a big fat Greek salad just the way I like it. :) Thanks for sharing your recipe, Jen. This lovely salad paired perfectly with my Mediterranean-inspired main dish! :-)

My husband said it was the best salad he has ever had.  I thought it was a bit lemony, and I love lemon.  I will just take away a tbsn next time.  I did add some garlic and a tiny bit of stevia.  Home grown tomatoes and just plain black olives.  Thank you for the recipe.

I made this pretty much as written except I used grape tomatoes and I forgot to add the salt and pepper to the dressing.  Didn't even miss it though! The salad got a lot of flavor from the cheese and olives.  It was delish!

I love this recipe! I make it often on Sundays and have it to munch on before dinner with some hummus and pita bread. Makes a great snack! The only substitution I made is garlic salt instead of salt and pepper and I like to slice grape or cherry tomatoes and put some in for some added texture.

Quick & easy.  I do think it would be better chilled some before serving though. We did add more Greek Olives (I usually don't like olives even).  A suggestion to soak cucumbers in salt water first may help if they're to soft & have a lot of juice. Thie will help firm them.

I LOVE this salad!!! It was tasty and SUPER easy to make.  I added double the olives though...for a greek salad it didn't seem like 6 greek olives was quite enough.  YUM  YUM!

All I can say is WOW!  I thought this would need some dressing added, but it was so fresh and tasty without.

I was trying to make something similar to our local grocery store to save money.  This is WAY better than the salad there!  

So fresh and full of flavor.  I did follow reviewers and added some peppercini's and did 3 tsp of lemon juice and 1 tsp of red wine vinegar.

We loved it, we used the advice and used 3 teaspoons lemon juice and 1 teaspoon red wine vinegar and left out the olives.  I mixed it with feta and couscous.

Good salad. The dressing was not as good as other Greek dressing I've made. I think next time I will use all vegetables listed here, then make my own dressing which uses white wine vinegar, lemon, sugar, and olive oil.

Delicious summer salad!  I served the black olives on the side and let people add how many/few they wanted.

Omitted olives since didn't have any but did add some chopped green pepper as someone suggested. DELICIOUS! Will definitely make this again. Tasty and healthy. Thanks for sharing.

I enjoyed this salad.  It was quick and easy and healthy! I tossed it in the greek dressing I found on this site and put the mixture on top of romaine lettuce and sprinkled with feta cheese. Very good for summer cook-outs!  Will make again...next time may top with grilled chicken strips.

I served this salad to a group of men who absolutely raved about the wonderful, fresh taste and proceeded to clean up the huge bowl of salad.  It's simple and quick to prepare and has a wonderful presentation of color.

I made this for a dinner party and my husband thought it was one of the shining stars...and he's not a big fan of feta cheese!  I had all of the ingredients left over, so I made it again last night!  I did follow the advise of other reviewers and used a little vinegar with the lemon juice.  I used grape vinegar the first time and balsalmic the second.  Both were equally yummy in our opinion!

Very good salad.  I left out olives because I'm not crazy about them.  I did the 3 tbsp lemon juice and 1 tsp. red wine vinegar and added a half of a chopped bell pepper.  Good stuff!

I made this yesterday for dinner, and it was good.  The only thing that I will do next time, is use the red wine vinegar that some suggested.  I thought that the lemon didn't really give it that zing that I was hoping for.

I can't stand olvies so I did not put them in.  I don't know if that's what it was missing, but it was way to bland for me.  I added some red wine vineagr and it helped a little.

This is one of our favorite summer dishes when the tomatoes are fresh.  We eat it at least once a week.
