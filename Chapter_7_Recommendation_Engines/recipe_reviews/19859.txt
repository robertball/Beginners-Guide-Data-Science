With a couple of minor adjustments this is excellent. With this quantity of garlic I think slow cooking for much longer than 90 minutes is essential. Otherwise there is a lingering garlic harshness which mellows and becomes a great undertone after about three hours. I also would use far more onion......onions are full of sugar and also add a nice chunkiness. I'd use four or five times the onion sauteed until translucent.

Need just a little sugar added to the mix. Other than that it is a good sauce. Freezes well and tastes better the next day.

The oregano must have been a typo. A full cup?? And 20 cloves of garlic - really?? The garlic and oregano simply overwhelmed all the other ingredients with an unpleasant acrid flavor. The acidity that many felt needed to be counteracted with an addition of sugar results from pouring in the wine at the end of the cooking time instead of at the beginning which would allow the alcohol to burn off and a mellow flavor to develop. Eating this was not a pleasant experience. It got fed to my brand new KitchenAid disposer. You could probably turn this into a decent recipe but not without some drastic changes.

My whole family loved this sauce. Even the picky 5 year old who only eats his spaghetti with butter asked for some of this because it smelled so good and ate every bite. I cooked mine in my slow cooker for 24 hours which made it very easy. It freezes very well and makes three meals worth of sauce for our family.

Thanks for the great recipe! I used fresh tomatoes so I ended up simmering it all night long! We woke up so hungry for the sauce after smelling it cook all night! I added a can of tomato paste too because my tomatoes were a bit watery. I think this would make an excellent manicotti or lasagne sauce where you don't cook the noodles first.

I've made this twice now and I agree with the reviewers that it needs to simmer a bit longer (I let it go about 3 hours). The second time around I added additional sausage extra garlic and used Pinot Grigio because I had no red wine. I also chose to balance the acidity with a bit of sugar. This freezes really well. With my modifications I give this 5 stars! 2011 UPDATE: I've discovered that we prefer this sauce if I use 1 #10 can (you know the really big one) of diced tomatoes in puree to replace all the little ones. Do that and you have no fooling around with the whole tomatoes at the end (hubby who doesn't like big hunks of cooked tomato prefers the diced as well -- no surprises if you miss any!) This is our go-to sauce now!

Too much oregano for my taste-I froze it in quart size bags & add a large can of crushed tomatoes and simmer a while before serving.

Flavor of this recipe is so-so. With this much garlic there is a long lingering bitter after taste that is not pleasing.

This was okay. My dad really liked it and my mom thought it was good. My husband said it would have been better with a lot less oregano. I only made about a third of the recipe. My 1 year old ate a little of the sauce my 3 year old tasted it and decided he just wanted noodles and butter.

Good starter recipe although I add spices not listed here and the garlic is a bit much unless its roasted first & for artery sake I cut down on oil and add lemon juice but overall good Sugo. Instead of canned tomatoes though I processed some from my garden and had to add some bell pepper just because i love it in my Italiano dishes. I also cook this for about 2 hours.

Scaled this down to use 3-28 ounce cans of tomatoes. I used San Marzano whole tomatoes and zapped them with my immersion blender to make a smooth sauce. Also only used 1 tablespoon of oregano and 5 cloves of garlic. I also used fresh basil and 1 large onion.This lacks in flavor and would benefit with more seasonings. Rosemary bay leaves Italian flat leaf parsley and a bit of sugar to cut the acid of the tomatoes. It also needs more simmering time I left it go for about 4 and 1/2 hours. I will add another can of tomatoes to it with the said seasonings as I hate to waste food.Hopefully it will work. Will not make this again. Made for allrecipesallstartscanada facelessnomore
