I love that this chili is so simple to make and that it can be made with stuff I keep on hand.  It is a little different than the chili that I am used to . It has the consistency of taco meat and barely any liquid.  I wasn't sure I liked that at first but I put it on a bag of Fritos and it was great. They didn't get soggy!  The chili wasn't quite spicy enough for me. I had to add a little cayenne pepper.  Overall, it is a good recipe and I would make it again.

Thank you Jeff I remember eating this as a child in OK. Can't wait to try it. But I'll have to search for the chili powder!

I made this for a Monday Night Football gathering to top baked potatoes.  It doesn't make a lot, about 1 quart and I had more than half left over.  It is basically seasoned ground beef.  I thought the Gebhardt's chili powder might be something special but it wasn't any different than many other less expensive chili powders.  Sorry, but I was not impressed with this recipe.

This is midwest chili not Texas or southwest chili. It is not meant to be spicy hot anymore than Cincinnati chili is.  We like it  for a change of pace and I use it for "chili dogs".

The cocoa is overpowering and the recipe needs salt.  If you adjust, it will likely be pretty good. I won't make it again because there are just too many better chili recipes out there for me to mess around.

I made a couple changes just because it what I always do, used ground turkey, added a 19 ounce drained and rinsed can of marinated mixed salad beans, added an extra tablespoon of tomato paste and a 28 ounce can of Italian style diced tomatoes 1/2 of them whirled in my magic bullet and a pinch of sugar.
