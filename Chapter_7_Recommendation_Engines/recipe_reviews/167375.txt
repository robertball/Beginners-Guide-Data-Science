Delicious and super easy! I omitted the ramen noodles and the celery, subbed edamame for half of the peas, and used fresh ginger. I also used olive oil instead of peanut. This is so flavorful and crunchy, even without the noodles. I'd add a touch more soy sauce next time, but this is a definite keeper.

Delicious blend of sweet (peas) and salty (cashews + soy sauce)!  I had just run out of oil and onions, so put in neither one, but the taste carried through!  Great crunchy salad!

This was just strange for me.  I can't say it was bad (probably because I eat almost anything) but it wasn't good. I made it for company and all agreed "this is weird".

This was delicious! I omitted the water chestnuts, because I didn't have any, and added shredded carrots in its place. Added nice color to an overall lovely mix. Didn't have the peanut oil, but could see that it would have added more flavor.  Great recipe and one I really needed in my mix. Thanks!

Fresh and light (words I don't often use to describe asian food!). The Chili Flakes are the X Factor!  Delicious!

I think the person that said the recipe is weird didn't make it quite right, there was nothing weird about it.  One of the best asian salads I have had in a while. I didn't change the recipe a bit and it was excellent.  No changes needed!  All I did was keep the dressing, the peas/jicama/water chestnuts and the nuts separate so that I could make it for lunch all week long.  

I also made the dressing for another salad.  I added the pea/jicama/water chestnuts and cashews to a spinach, edamame, carrot salad and it was just as delicious.  You can overdress the salad since the soy sauce is strong but if done right it is a definite crowd pleaser.

Yummmmmmmmmm.  Thank you for posting!!!

So great, but only with the flavor packet from the Ramen. I used pork flavor.

I made this as directed and I think there are other similar salads out there that are better.  I think another 25% or so on the dressing would give it a little more flavor.  And I would leave out the celery, it doesn't seem to go with the other flavors and there is plenty of crunch and texture with the ramen, water chestnuts  and jicama without it.

Love this salad! I substituted black bean pasta for angel hair. Good enough for a dinner party.

Super yummy and different than other types of salads.
