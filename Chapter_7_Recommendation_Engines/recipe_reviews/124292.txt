This is so easy and tastes great! The only thing I did different was to add a little fresh ground pepper and a few more crackers. I love the onions with the sour cream and cracker crust. the only tip I have for anyone is to not over saute the onions. If you don't like this recipe, maybe you don't like onion's as much as you thought, and you must use Vidalia onions!

Love this recipe! I was going to a BBQ and wanted to bring a side dish. This was perfect. I sauteed the onions with some minced garlic. Other than that I stuck to the recipe. Everyone asked me to email them this recipe. Will definitely make again.

It was good and different. I didn't change anything. We served it with grilled steaks, it was a nice accompaniment and easy to make. Thanks!

A tasty side dish, and simple to prepare. Added some extra crackers and seasoning. We used two very large Vidalias, and came close to filling a 1-1/2 qt. baking dish. The recipe is not particularly sensitive to the number of onions used as Onion Casserole I on this site is the same recipe but uses five onions rather than two.

If you like onions this is a great side dish.  I've served it with chicken breast, roast beef and pork chops.  Also added roasted garlic and sweet and green onions to the mix.

I wasn't sure when I read the ingredients if this would be to my liking.  I couldn't have been more impressed.  A big hit at tonight's BBQ - thanks for posting!

If you like onions you will just love this. I made it as a side with pork and was perfect. Really enjoyed the flavour, and I didn't change a thing.

Nothing more than onions. I love sweet onions, but this needed some seasoning and longer cooking time in skillet or oven. May try again with some salt and waiting for a little color this time before putting together.

This is very good but I would suggest not skimping on the cracker quality.  Also I doubled the recipe one time and it really did not do well for some reason, there was too much liquid.
