Hubby adores bleu cheese, so I had a feeling this would be a winner!  I chose to score and marinade my london broil in McCormick's Montreal Steak grilling sauce, which is my favorite way of preparing london broil....so easy and so tasty. Also, I broil the steak for about 10 min. per side instead of grilling.  The bleu cheese butter really made it though!!  I made the butter a few hours ahead of time so it could sit in the fridge and "blend".  Very robust flavor!  My husband loved it, he brought the leftovers to work today for lunch, which is always a sure sign of a keeper recipe.  Thanks for the post!

What a great taste!  I have made this about 6 times so far and have found that it's best to put on the rub, then leave the meat to rest for about 30 minutes before grilling.  I tried it once without the wait time, and was less satisfied with the results.  Also-- use good bleu cheese for best results!

We have made this twice now both times with sirloin steak. The rub is incredible and the bleu cheese butter is to die for.  The combination is great and adding the chives is a definite.  I will make sure to do this with other cuts of meat.

Made this last night with cuts of sirloin instead of london broil (was cheaper at the store)! Fantastic! Even my husband, who is iffy about bleu cheese, loved it! We thought it may have been better with some sort of marinade, but was great and juicy without it! We cooked the meat on a grill pan on top of the stove- medhi heat, 4 mins on each side and got a gorgeous medium rare, which is what both of us like (with 1 inch thick cuts). Try this!!

Everbody loves this recipe.  I make a bleu cheese sauce by melting the butter and bleu cheese together and adding some heavy cream.  Sometimes I'll add some Merlot or Cabernet to make a bleu cheese/wine sauce.  The rub is great and the sauce smooths it all out.

This was so delicious.  I had a taste for red meat (london broil in particular), and this satisfied my pregnant craving!!!  The bleu cheese butter was an excellent addition to the meat...made it spectacular.  I microwaved the bleu cheese/butter/chive mixture for about 15 seconds on high b/c I wanted to serve it warm on the meat.  Freeze dried chives work just as well as fresh chives.  Also, I rubbed the meat down with garlic pepper, which made this especially flavorful.  I will be adding this to the rotation!

This is excellent!! It definately added a kick to the steak. I also put it in my mashed potatoes and boy that gave them tons of flavor!! I think it would be great on any veggie too.

This is a huge hit at my house.  It's great for company too.  I have cheated and used the Montreal Steak Seasoning and then put the bleu cheese butter on it, it's excellent.  Either way, it gets great reviews!

The combination of butter and spices was a HIT! I recommend doubling the bleu cheese, though. Also, definitely add the chives to the spice mix-gives it a great flavor!

Although I liked this recipe a lot, there was nothing special about the meat rub (I will probably just use Montreal Steak seasoning next time).  However, the blue cheese butter made the meal.  I am not usually a huge fan of blue cheese because it is so strong, but the blue cheese and butter mixture was a perfect compliment to the meat.  I will use this as topping for beef in the future.

Made this for Fourth of July BBQ! So delicious! Added kosher salt and subsituted garlic powder for garlic salt. I used gorgonzola instead of blue just my preference.

I used a different marinade because I wasn't too excited about a spicy meal so I'm rating this based solely on the Bleu Cheese Butter sauce because man, that made this steak!  I melted the butter/cheese down to nearly liquid and let it thicken in the fridge stirring every 10 min or so until it was paste-like.  Then rolled it in plastic wrap and sealed the ends so that it was a cylinder.  Freeze that and then you can cut out slices of this butter.  Just a different technique to make it look pretty.  But the ratios were spot on!

Wow, this was just amazing! I think this may be the best dish I've ever made! The only thing I changed was using two "London Broil" cuts of lamb (I was gonna buy the beef, but the lamb was on sale and had the dish name in it!) and I added some extra chives into the bleu cheese butter. I seared the lamb on a really hot pan with olive oil to caramelize the outside. It was amazingly delish! Served with blackened asparagus and a spinach salad with sauteed red onions and clambshell mushrooms. I just can't gush enough!

Very flavorful (if you like blue cheese) and tender. I substituted garlic powder and kosher salt for the garlic salt and used about 1/2 tsp of paprika. I sprinkled a pepper blend seasoning on the meat instead of using 1 full tablespoon and did not use cayenne pepper. For the sauce, I did not have chives on hand, so I just added 1 chopped green onion. Also, my flank steak cooked a lot faster than recipe suggested. Maybe mine was not as thick(I also prefer it on the rare side). Sliced really thin. Chilled sauce mixture in a log shape and sliced rounds to top meat. Yummy! Thank you! Update: I used leftovers in Linda Miller's steak salad recipe on this site. Still yummy. Leftovers would also be good in flour tortillas with guacamole, sour cream, cheese and salsa.

My family gets bored, so I thought I'd try this for something new. WOW!!!  10 stars!  I bought a small London Broil in case they didn't like it.  Although the kids ate it without the bleu cheese they loved it!  Eight thumbs up from our house. (due to weather I broiled it inside but it was still fabulous)  Thanks Robyn!

Excellent steak recipe! I followed the amount of ingredients as instructed and it turned out great.  Rather than letting the blue cheese butter as is, I melted it slightly!  Wow!  What a great taste!  This steak recipe goes well with scalloped potatoes and of course, a nice bottle of Grenache & Malbec red wine!

omg, this was SOOO good! I used flat iron steak instead, 4 minutes per side on high, but it worked out perfectly. my DH doesn't like blue cheese so i thought the butter topping would be just for me. but he tried it and absolutely loved it. Thank you so much! best steak i've ever made!

I have to question the use of flank steak with this recipe.. even "london broil" which is actually top round, is a terribly "tough" cut of beef regardless of the length of time or method of how its marinated.  The recipe looks delicious, but do yourself a favor and buy --at the very least-- a cut of TOP SIRLOIN for this wonderful recipe.. flank AND "london broil" just gets bigger the longer you chew it!!!

Definitely one of my favorite recipes I have made to date (about 200 and counting!)(so that is saying a lot!) I used Montreal Steak Seasoning to season my meat and then a slow BBQ over the grill.  The blue-cheese butter was wonderful.  It was SOOO good - I tushed out with a bite and said to the hubby " You have got to taste this - it is awesome!!!"  He agreed and we savored every bite!  Not only a keeper - but I might NOT tell everyone where I got the recipe this time!

This was AMAZING! I always marinate my London Broil for 24 hours, which I did with my own spices which are similar to this recipe. The Bleu Cheese/ Butter really made this an excellent dish!

The Bleu cheese butter is of course delicious, but do yourself a favor and buy a flank steak. The London Broil is so much tougher than a flank steak.

I added a little more to the rub mixture, like paprika, and let it marinate for 8 hours.  The rub made the steak so moist and juicy and the blue cheese butter was perfect!  I will be making this again and again.  Delicious!

Love this recipe!! I use this for company when I make a Filet Mignon roast, but my sister in law gave me similar recipe, but you toast in a frying pan some walnuts till the oils begin to come out then you through them in a food processor and pulverize  them and mix them with the bleu cheese butter.  Yummy!!!

I used a marinade and marinated the steak over night. The flavor from the bleu cheese butter is wonderful.

Awesome-Blue Cheese Lovers need to go ahead and double up on the blue cheese butter part of the recipe.  This is soooo good.  The steak seasonings rubbed on the outside are not spicy at all.  I wondered with so much pepper of both kinds how "hot" it would would taste.  It was flavorful and tasty, but not "hot".  I would probably increase the cayenne pepper next time to maybe 1/2tsp and see what that does:)

I love the bleu cheese butter on top. It melts nicely and spreads a great flavor over the meat.

Wonderful! I made this for my family today. They all loved it. I put blue cheese and chives in the butter. Fantastic!! Although, next time I might soak my beef in some cola or something before I rub it with the oil & spices so it will be a little more tender. Was very good otherwise!!

This was delicious.  We don't have a grill, so we broiled it instead.  Takes about 5-7 minutes per side.  Also, next time, I'd triple the amount of butter/chives/bleu cheese for the recipe.  Simply Delicious!!!

We used fresh cracked black peppercorn instead of black pepper. 

My Mother-in-law is Puerto Rican and she found it right on maybe just a little bit spicy.  My Father-in-law is not Puerto Rican and he found the crust to be way too spicy for his taste.  But he also didn‚Äôt have any of the bleu cheese butter which really cut the spice for the rest of us.  Everyone agreed the flavor was great.  He even went back for seconds and thirds.  The meat itself came out with the outside being like it was seared and the inside tender.  

My personal take on the seasoning:  I think I would leave it alone but in the idea of having to cook for someone else I‚Äôd probably reduce the amount of pepper to 1 ¬Ω teaspoons.
I don‚Äôt know what else I‚Äôd use the butter on, though some put in on the rosemary potatoes we made, but it was outstanding.  Might have been better with really small chives, but the flavor was great.  We did increase the amount of butter we made.

Fantastic recipe! Supper easy and it was delicious! I served this for a new years party and it was a hit. I also used a grill pan and it was scrumptous andtook less than 10 mins to cook to the right doneness. My guests loved it topped with the butter as it added something special. Thanks for sharing!!

just made this for the second time last night.  we had some of my husbands friends over and they freaked out for it.  i triple the blue cheese butter because it's too good to just have a little bit! also, instead of chives, i added about 5 stalks of green onions... amazing!

This recipe is just wonderful. My family now asks for the blue cheese meat dish instead of London Broil!  I double the butter/blue cheese ingredients so we have more to spread on the meat individually.  I'm almost getting sick of it since I've made it so.... many times now.

Excellent recipe.  Very simple, still let's the meat shine through.  Looked around the site and saw a number of London Broils that required marinade and I didn't have the time or, really the  interest in a marinated steak (I tend to prefer steaks with just a season rub.)  Spotted this recipe and left it unchanged except I had crumbled Gorgonzola on hand instead of Bleu Cheese.  No matter - rave reviews from my wife and family.  Thanks, Robyn

I've used this recipe for about 2 yrs.  It is wonderful.  Never in ten thousand years would I have tasted blue cheese (and a little of this goes a long way), but it makes the meat.  We use London Broil and the left-overs (when there are any) are just as good.  Just be sure to get the meat medium rare.

I'm giving this 5 stars because my husband and sons LOVED this recipe...infact my husband wanted me to make it again within a week.  I personally did not like it.   I sliced the leftover meat very thin the next night & used it for soft taco's & they loved those too!

I must say the bleu cheese butter sauce...GADZOOKS!!! I am now a big fan of bleu cheese,
will use sauce with other foods, for sure! The meat has outstanding flavor, although still a bit tough. Need to add something to tenderize it just a bit more. Thank you for sharing such an easy, great tastin recipe.

Holy cow was this delicious!! I used a couple of Porterhouse steaks though, we just like them better. I shook some McCormick Montreal steak spice on both sides of the steaks, grilled for about 10 minutes on each side and they came out perfectly medium well. I sauteed a vidalia onion in some butter, and made the bleu cheese butter which was phenomenal! The whole meal was an explosion of deliciousness in my mouth! This butter recipe is definitely a must for steak lovers and is going in my recipe box permanently!

I made this recipe twice now and it is a family favorite.  The steak was very tender and the spices were a perfect blend with the blue cheese butter.  We will surely be making this again and again!!! Great recipe.

I thought everything about this recipe was amazing!!! The blend of spices was out of this world and as for the cooking time if you followed the recipe when it said leave the grill on low it cooked the perfect medium rare stake in the perfect amount of time!

The flavors are awesome! The cooking time was way too long. Flank steak usually is very quick to cook. Just watch your meat and it'll be okay. Can't wait to make it again! This time I'll watch it carefully!

A delicious and different way to enjoy a good steak!  
We cook London broil fairly often, and I will typically marinate it overnight in a varying mixture.  This was my first time doing just a rub, and the steak was delicious all on its own.  But with the addition of the bleu cheese butter, well... Perfection!!
My only note - Make more next time!

Made this recipe as written with the exception of using 1 lb trimmed filet mignon, I doubled the spices to make sure I had enough rub(I did not change the ratio of spices), and I added more chives to the blue cheese butter.  My husband has been talking about this recipe for weeks!  I would like to add that I absolutely hate blue cheese.  But there is no way I could hate this blue cheese butter!  Thank you so much ROBYN050501 for making the perfect steak rub and butter!  My soldier loves it!

We broiled the meat in the oven for about 7-10 min/side.  It turned out medium well. Next time we'll try to do 5-7 min for even more tenderness.  I did pound it before cooking, I think that helped. We also allowed the meat to rest before cutting...that was hard! :-) My husband kept cutting end peices off while we waited. The meat was incredible! YOU HAVE GOT TO MAKE THE BUTTER! The butter REALLY added to the flavor and was neccessary to cool the heat (Not temp.) down.  My husband said he would have paid for the meal! I would have too!

Even though my husband and I love blue cheese and thought it would be a hit, we felt it was just ok.  I had 2 NY strips frozen, so that's what I used...not sure if I will make again.  We seem to just like our steaks marinated.

The london broil is tough to cook... I'm not that great at it yet, but my fiance was the grill/broil master. It worked out. This dish was otherwise SUPER easy and realllly tasty :)

Oooookay. 1st: this is London Broil which is NOT flank steak. A "London Broil" is usually a Top Round Roast, not a flank steak. I had a top round cut and used this, but I wish that I had used a flank steak it would have been MUCH better. The blue cheese butter is AWESOME!!! It ABSOLUTELY saved my over-cooked top round! I'm only giving it 4 stars because of the name confusion. I feel that it should be called Kickin' Flank Steak with Bleu Cheese Butter.

My review is the same as everyone else's--the rub for the meat is okay, the bleu cheese butter is fantastic!  Next time I think I will make a little extra of the bleu cheese.  Update--made again and used Montreal's steak seasoning instead of the rub, and it was great!

OK so you ever have one of those moments where you start cooking and realize your ingredients aren't quite right?  That was me tonight.    The good news is that even with the tweaks I had to make this steak was WONDERFUL!  I had no onion powder so I omitted.  I had garlic powder not salt so I added 3/4 tsp of salt.  Cayenne looked funky so 1 tsp chili powder instead.  THEN the cheese was gorgonzola not bleu.  BAH!!!    Still everything was amazing!  8 minutes both sides under the broiler medium, another 2 after slicing for my well done preference.

This was really, really rich and came out (with little work) like something I'd order off of a nice restaurant menu.  I enjoyed this a lot, but won't make it frequently, as blue cheese is a special treat here.  Like one reviewer said, season and let the meat rest before cooking.

This was sooo good and easy!  I made it for company and everyone was impressed.  I did use a little less pepper in the rub since little kids were going to be eating it too, but it was still great with lots of flavor.  I used a London Broil and grilled it to medium and it was very tender and juicy!  I served it with boiled baby red potatoes with chives and butter and grilled carrots.... It was a complete success, thanks for posting!

I was afraid I would ruin it, and it wouldn't turn out like the other reviewer's did. I am hit or miss with any kind of steak! BUT - this was perfection, tender, juicy and delectable! I don't know why some reviews said London broil was a tough cut. Mine was melt in the mouth tender! I did the olive oil and rub, then let it sit a good half hour, stuck it in the broiler for about 6 min each side, then another section a little more for those who didn't want any pink.

Excellent recipe!! This has become a regular in our house. I use a london broil cut of round steak, instead of the flank, just because it's more readily available here.   I make up a large batch of the rub to keep on hand, making this even easier than it already is. I put the rub on at least an hour before and find it really adds to the flavor.  Tons of flavor in this.. the meat is great alone, but with the butter it's to die for! Thanks so much for sharing this.

I hate to admit it, but it is only recently that I have begun to appreciate Blue cheese.  I'm still a little scared of it, but I really wanted to try this recipe.  I used rib eye steaks instead of flank steak.  I added fresh minced garlic and cayenne to the butter mixture, I cut the blue cheese back a bit, and I used gorgonzola.  This was delicious.  I served it with a whole grain pilaf, mushrooms sauted in butter with garlic and sherry, and a spinach salad.  Very good meal.  Thanks for the recipe!

I thought this was just okay. The butter seemed to completely overpower the beef - I was glad I put it on the side instead of on the meat.  I would cut down on the pepper as well, it was a bit much.

Awesome topping!  I used a bottled rub  for the meat (my kids won't eat anything too spicy), and doubled the blue cheese topping.  Everyone gave it a thumbs up!!

I agree with some other reviewers- the bleu cheese butter is fantastic. I'll be using this on other meats as well. I think the meat still needs to be marinated- ours turned out pretty tough, even only medium-rare. I may find a mild marinade next time, but I'll definitely use the butter!

This was fabulous!  Wouldn't change a thing, and I highly recommend adding the chives to the blue cheese butter.  Great served with grilled veggies and a good wine.  Thanks for the recipe, we will make it again and again!

We love bleu cheese and this is a regular on our dinner list.  Even if I don't always make the flank steak this way, I usually make the butter to go with it -- or steak or burgers, beef whatever.

Cut back on the black pepper to 1/2 tablespoon.  You can also substitute Wasabi for the red pepper.

This rating is for the Bleu Cheese Butter only ... used the butter to top a salad with organic greens and balsamic marinated portabello mushrooms (sliced).  Absolutely fantastic!!  Great for a first or second course in a special meal and easy to prepare.

This is superb!!! I searched and searched for a recipe for london broil and when since we've tried this, we will search no more! Followed the directions exactly except I have never had any chives for the butter, just bleu cheese and butter is great. It is a family hit.

I cooked a London broil on the grill for this. Instead of onion powder and garlic salt, I minced a clove of garlic and diced an onion. My measurements were estimates. I didn't use cayenne pepper and used black pepper in its place. It turned out well, but the blue cheese butter was the star. The strong flavor of blue cheese made this meal delicious.

I mixed this recipe with one that called for a marinade made of olive oil, minced garlic, balsamic vinegar, soy sauce, ketchup, pepper, and oregano. The bleu cheese butter was phenomenal and the use of a marinade maximized the moisture of the meat. I loved it!!

Loved this - the flavor was wonderful with the blue cheese and chives (added scallions).  You could play with this several different ways although not needed.  Definitely a fan of the strong flavor, we LOVE blue cheese!

The meat preparation was spot on!  Olive Oil and then the rub... I let it sit for a couple hours in the fridge before I put it on the grill.  This was a BIG hit and was gone very quickly.   I didn't make the bleu cheese, but I will next time.

Loved it!  I loved the butter mixture so much, I kept sneaking tastes of it while the steak was cooking!  I also used some on the broccoli we served on the side.  We also had some saut√©ed mushrooms and onions with it.  The weather was bad, so I made it on a grill pan inside, and it was still delicious.

I think I just prefer a different cut of meat - the butter made the dish & would use on any steak. Nothing special about the rub.

Oh. My. GAWD. This was so, so good! Perfectly rare after 10 min/side on low in a grill pan on top of the stove. I let it it rest for 10-15 min, sliced, and served. I made a ton extra of the bleu cheese butter and served it over baked potatoes for a side dish. Saving this one for sure!!

This was delicious. I had grassfed beef london broil in the freezer and no idea what to do with it, so I tried this recipe. It was fantastic! The rub had a little kick and the blue cheese butter was fantastic.

LOVED the blue cheese butter and the general concept of putting it over the beef. The thing that kept me from giving this five stars is the cut of meat recommended in the recipie. I will make again, but use a better cut of meat.

This came out GREAT!  My wife said it was her favorite meal I have ever made.  I marinated using the "London Broil I" recipe on this site. I added 3 tsp of white vinegar to tenderize the meat.  After 8 hours I added the rub and then grilled it for 12 minutes each side over low heat on the grill and it was amazing!

This was fantastic!  The rub was excellent and we've used it on strips...but really, we were thinking, why pay for strips when the london broil turned out so great! My husband loved the bleu cheese butter, but I didn't care for it.  Nevertheless, wonderful recipe!

Was good, but really spicy, way too spicy for the kids. Liked it though, may try on a better cut of meat, like a ribeye.

Was in a hurry to cook London Broil and wanted something tasty.  Used Grill Creations Smokey Mesquite rub and didn't have blue cheese so used goat cheese. Substituted scallions for chives and cooked the steak only 5 mins. on each side.  It was delicious. A real keeper for someone in a hurry!

FANTASTIC!  so easy and so foolproof. I used montreal steak seasoning to save on steps and because i love using it on my meats - cooked under broiler for 8 min's per side.  served w/ cold, sliced cucumbers in dressing. there was NOTHING left over.  Thankyou for the recipe.

I have never cooked a London broil before, so I was a little hesitant about overcooking it. I followed the directions exactly as written and the meat turned out fantastic. I had to increase the rub recipe a bit and added a smidgen more cayenne, but other than that everything stayed the same. My husband, my guest and I enjoyed it so much that we managed to consume the entire 3 lbs I prepared and were still craving more. My only warning is, the blue cheese can be a bit overpowering, be careful that you don't go over the recommended amount in the recipe. All in all a wonderful, simple, quick, and delicious recipe everyone should try. Kudos to the chef!

London broil just can't be cooked in any quick way. We felt like we were eating shoe leather. What's up with all of these great ratings - maybe I'm just lucky that I've been to really good steak restaurants.

I thought this was quite good! Another reviewer is correct when she said that london broil and flank steak are not the same thing. I used flank, because I think it is a bit more tender piece of meat. I thought the rub could've used a little something, but, it was a good starting out point! Next time I will add a little of this, a little of that to suite our tastes! Everyone loved the blue cheese chive butter! We served it with the steak and mashed potatoes. Thanks!

I have to agree with others, this was an exceptional recipe. I used the broiler as another user suggested. I made the blue cheese butter for myself because my hubby HATES blue cheese but I made him try it anyway. He spread a thin layer on his steak and then was asking if there was anymore left. It was delicios. I will defintely be making again!!! Thanks for the post.

the only thing i would say is that flank steak is not the same cut of meat as london broil so if you actually buy london broil this recipe rocks.

This is just so unbelievable!!!  We LOVED it!!  I did a 2 lb london broil.  8 minutes on one side, 10 on the other.  I'd probably do 8 and 8 next time to have it a little rarer.  I eased up on the pepper a bit and would probably use even less - maybe half of what the recipe calls for next time.  Too spicy for my 5 year old.  Otherwise..........perfect!

This was "Kickin'"!!  Reduced the pepper by half and doubled the bleu cheese butter (had some extra after the meal was over, but that was better than not having enough) :) A previous reviewer said the bleu cheese butter is best at room temp, I wasn't sure what he meant at the time.  I started out spreading bleu cheese all over the top of the steak and it melted away to nothing.  I found it was much better served on the side.  Use a small cookie scoop for a nice presentation.

Great flavor combination! I only used half the black pepper based on other reviews. We did find that even 11 minutes on a side was too long for medium rare (it ended up more mid-well), even on low heat - be sure to keep a close watch on the steak. Otherwise it was very good!

One of our family's favorite recipes! I am a begginer at cooking so was very scared when I had to make a meal for company. I chose this recipe and it was a GREAT pick because it is easy, very good and the taste is impressive. It has been well over a year since I have made it, and the company I had over still talks about it to this day!

Wow....this was really good.  The nice thing about it is that the butter is made seperately, and put on at the end, so if the kids don't want the "cheese that smells like feet!" on theirs, you can leave it off!  My hubbie and I LOOOVED it.  Even the leftovers were delightful the next day.  Will definitely make again!!!!!!!!  Thank you!

My teenager who usually hates steak loved it an ate 3 servings. Rub is rather spicey with so much pepper so cut  it down to 2 tsp. We doubled the butter sauce cause everyone was fighting for more!

This was so good. I had never cooked a london broil before and was somewhat skeptical after some of the other reviews said it was a tough cut of meat, but it turned out excellent. I followed the recipe except I used spray olive oil on the meat and let it sit for a little while as another reviewer suggested, and broiled it instead of grilling since it started raining when I got home. My only reccommendation would be to add a little liquid to let it marinade in next time. I will probably let it marinate in some red wine and add the seasonings. Oh, and the bleu cheese butter is amazing :) Definetly a keeper :)

Good with any grilled meat.  We've tried this with several meals served on the side.  It's important that the bleu cheese butter is served @ room temperature.  Perfectly yummy!

I've been addicted to this kind of meat and cheese combo ever since I had a steak at an upscale restaurant. Only that time I believe it was a Gorgonzola/garlic butter sauce. Excellent! I was interested in this rub particularly. However, the peppers totally smoked up my house when I used my cast iron grill. It still turned out delicious.

Recipe was very good - I reduced the pepper just a little bit and let the rub sit on the meat for about 30 minutes.  The only problem I had was my grill on low isn't quite low enough so it didn't cook as slow as it should have.  So I'm sure the meat would have been more tender - but that's my grill's fault!

We used a 2 inch NY strip and it was excellent. LOVED the rub. Definitely not overpowering for the steak. The blue cheese mixture on the other hand was too much of a flavor for me. I did not have any chives, but I bet it would have been excellent with that. Next time I think I will use the chives, less blue cheese and perhaps Gorgonzola instead of blue cheese.

Highly recommend this recipe if you want something that tastes more upscale without the price tag. :)

Excellent!  My husband loved the flavors together, although next time I will use less cayanne...simply because I am not a big spice person.  I couldn't believe how creamy the bleu cheese/butter mixture was, and how well it complimented the beef.  Absolutely will repeat!

This was awesome (except,as several others have suggested, the wonderful flavors deserve a better steak than London Broil. Even though I  cooked it med rare, it was tough! I will use a good steak next time and really savor the flavorful rub and the blue cheese topping (which I doubled)! A keeper!

This was really good!  I followed most of the suggestions, and it turned out great.  My husband is the only one who likes bleu cheese, and he asked me to make it again.  It is now one of our favorite meals.  Careful with the pepper, one time it turned out too peppery!

I have got to be one of the few who didn't like the butter. It was too weird. The blue cheese was lumpy in it, I wouldn't put something cold on my hot food, I just didn't like it. I made my own marinade/rub for the meat: 1/4 C olive oil, 2 t Montreal steak seasoning, 1 t black pepper, 1 t garlic powder, 1 t onion powder, dash of Worcestershire, dash of liquid smoke. Mix together in a bowl & run into the meat & let sit in the fridge for an hour. So I really can't review the original recipe since I made changes. For some reason I just didn't like the butter. Thanks anyways.

While I love bleu cheese, I felt in this recipie it somewhat took away from the taste of the meat. I like my London Broil really rare and can usually eat half of one myself. The bleu cheese butter was too heavy and I stopped usuing it after a few pieces.

This is a great recipe especially if you don't have time to marinate your london broil. I love the blue cheese butter w/ fresh chives...I have also used it with other cuts of red meat and it's fabulous.

This was too spicey for me.  Maybe I used less steak & too much spice?  I made kabobs with tomato, onion and green pepper and rubbed the steak with the spices.  I LOVED the bleu cheese butter.  It would be perfect with less spice and more bleu cheese butter.

I used top sirloin and doubled the amount of the bleu cheese butter portion of the recipe.  It was phenomenal!  This recipe is going to have a permanent spot on my family's menu.

We used ribeye, as we prefer it to London Broil.I would suggest less spice, so as not to mask the quality of meat- but maybe that is needed with lesser cuts of meat. Very good overall.

This is hard to rate since there are 2 things to consider - the meat and the bleu cheese butter.  The blue cheese butter was outrageous and I WILL BE using that often - can't wait to use it on hamburgers.  But the meat rub was just ok.  Definitely try the blue cheese butter!!!  Thanks submitter.

SOOO good!  Husband said that this dinner (made with sesame green beans from this site) was the best he has EVER had!  I didnt have any green onion so I did not use that and also subbed  garlic salt for garlic powder.

This was excellent, and my husband loved it. I thought at first the bleu cheese would make it a bit to strong. Instead it blended perfectly with the meat, and was wonderful.

The blue cheese butter was absolutley awsome.  I made this for my sister and her boyfriend, and it was a huge hit.  I used a different marinade on a london broil, but it was the blue cheese butter that made the meal.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Yummmmmmmmmm, this was great.  I can't wait to serve it to guests.  The chives definetly added a nice additional flavor.
