This is a GREAT spice bread!!  I've found that it's also a wonderful base recipe that be easily personalized.  I made it using applesauce instead of shortening, 1/c. brown sugar instead of 1 c. white, substituted half the flour with whole wheat flour, and added about 3/4 cup of rolled oats.  I also threw in chopped candied ginger in addition to the raisins!!  Whooooo............it was gone in a flash, and my guys don't know they're getting fiber!!  Definitely will keep making this one!!

This is an absolutely fabulous loaf!  Because it contains ingredients that are commonly found in most kitchens it can be made up at any time.  It freezes well too!  This is now a family favourite.  Note:  I like lots of spice so I added more, but it's great as written!

Made this using some tips from comments.  Added a little extra spice, half the sugar & some applesauce with less oil.  More raisins & more nuts(pecans).  Used three little tins instead of larger loaf pan.  Otherwise followed the recipe.  Absolutely delicious & I will definitely make again!!!  Wonderful texture & I can taste the coffee, maybe because know it's in there!

Made this today and did a few changes as others did. Used 1/4 cup each butter and shortening, 1/2 cup each white and brown sugar, 1 cup each white and wheat flour, added about 1/2 to 3/4 cups oats. it would have been just great exactly as per recipe too. Only suggestion would be to add a little more raisins. Definitely a keeper. Thanks Marsha

We have a Christmas tradition in our family to make Mennonite "Pfeffernusse" aka Peppernuts.  I wanted to make a Pfeffernusse version of a loaf.  Using this wonderful recipe, I omitted the raisins and nuts, and added ½ tsp each of black pepper, ground star anise and nutmeg.  Also, I used butter and substituted ½ the white sugar for brown sugar.  Lastly I sprinkled the top with a bit of white sugar before baking.  My daughter walked through the kitchen as I was making it and she said' "It smells like Pfeffernusse".  Mission accomplished, and it turned out AMAZING!

The flavor is good, but we thought it was dry in texture.

This was good and very moist but I thought it could use more spice and way more craisins (used craisins instead). Next time I will up the spices and the craisins and see how it comes out. Delicious warm with butter though. Not a toss out recipe but a retry! It has potential

I took the advice of another review and used applesauce instead of shortening, added oats, used 1/2 whole wheat flour, 1/2 a/p flour and also added chocolate chips instead of raisins and nuts.  Somewhat good for you and yet my husband will eat it(choc chips)

Just ok.  Had a nice spice, could not taste the coffee.  The texture was rather crumbly.
