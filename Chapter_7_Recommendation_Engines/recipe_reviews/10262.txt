Excellent flavor!  Bake the base for 15-20 minutes before adding the remaining ingredients.  Bake until golden brown on top.  Cool on wire rack.  Cut with a sharp knife and sprinkle with confectioners' sugar.

These are yummy. I used almost 3/4 cup cherries.  as another reviewer suggested, I used almonds (did not have real cherries).  Does anyone have an opinion, which is better- sour or sweet?? I rated it a 4 star- recipe did not state whether butter should be cold or soft, and it was not ready after baking 25 min. I baked it til golden brown with great results- a delicate, crispy layer on top-soft and chew in the middle. UPDATE: I tried it with fresh sweet cherries. The batter looked so wet-so I added 1/8-1/4 cup flour. A mistake! It came out too dense-like a heavy cake. Still a great recipe. Next time: It will be sour cherries- with no extra flour.

This has been a bar I've made for years.  My husband has to have it every Christmas.  I too double the recipe.  I also bake the crust for a 20 minutes. I found it works well to lower the temperatue of the oven to 325 degrees during the last ten minutes of baking.  Then the edges don't get so brown.   compared to the outside edges

Also one of my favorite childhood recipes.  The only problem is that they go too quickly.  I like to double to recipe and make it in a 13x9 inch pan.

The first time I made these I thought they were wonderful.  I love coconut and cherry mixed together.  May try a batch with almonds next time.

Great bars, they received lots of good comments.
 Only thingid that the crust had a hard time staying together when taken out of the pan. Let it cool completely!!

My FAVORITE childhood recipe!  If you like cherries, and you like coconut - guaranteed you'll think you died and went to heaven...  Enjoy.   I'd give it six stars if that were an option...

This is much better with toasted slivered almonds instead of walnuts, and real cherries instead of maraschinos.

Deliciously different bar cookie that's easy, quick and fills the house with a decadent aroma.  I followed the recipe exactly and had perfect results.  Especially attractive on a Christmas/New Year's dessert plate.  Thank you so much for sharing with us.

My 12 year old made this mostly by herself.  It was great, we left out the nuts due to allergies and increased the cocnut and cherries slightly.  My favorite part was the shortbread, it was very light and flakey.  Will make it again.

I've made a version of this recipe for years.  My version uses brown sugar and no cherries.  The shortbread crust is wonderful.  I used a food processor and cold butter.  It produced a smooth small dry crumb that I pressed into the pan and then baked for 20 minutes, as suggested by other reviewers.  I also dusted the bars lightly with powdered sugar.  I cut them into 16 bars, I think 24 would make bars too small. This is a good recipe and I loved the maraschino cherries and walnuts in it.

I used 1C real cherries; substituted almonds for the walnuts, and this was delicious!  A great recipe to make up when in a hurry.

As per reviews, bake crust till golden and let cool before proceeding. Otherwise, delish.
