I made the sauce, cooked the pasta and sauteed the shrimp but the sauce tasted so awful, I had my husband taste it.  I figured it might be just me having a problem since all these good reviews were up but he agreed. This is horrible! Don't waste your time or precious ingredients.

This recipe needs no alterations!!!  Very good and extremely easy.  The rich buttery sauce really enhances the natural flavor of the shrimp and the ease of preparation makes it one I'll make time and again!!!  Kudos!!!

Too lemony with the juice of half a lemon. I found it to be tasteless and too heavy with all the butter.

Just sat down to review this and realized I forgot to add the parsley at the end.  Opps.  Very good, but make sure to add a good amount of hot sauce.  Really needs it for flavor. I didn't because of a 9 y/o girl whos kinda picky, but i added it to my bowl and yum!

Very good! I was a little nervous about sauteeing shrimp for the first time, but they came about perfectly. I read other reviews about the flavor being a bit bland, so added some diced habanero peppers and italian seasoning for more spice--and it was perfect! I added slightly less butter, about 6 tbsp, and used rotini pasta. No complaints!

My Husband and I truly enjoyed this recipe.  We added a little bit of a Teriaky marinade to it.  A really yummy meal.

Pretty good.  As it was I thought it was a bit plain, but still good so I put four stars.  Added chili powder and a lotta cayenne to my own.

This was pretty good. I have been looking for a recipe that calls for fines herbs and it was nice to finally use them.

This was delicious.  I had mine with spaghetti squash rather than pasta.  Next time I will reduce the butter and try using 1/2 the amount and replacing the remainder with olive oil.

I fixed this for dinner tonight and wow!, it's fantastic! I made a few changes. I cooked the shrimp in olive oil. I also added garlic and cajun seasoning to the sauce. I also used a little chicken boullion in the water for the pasta.

VERY hot not meant for kids.  If you don't have the taste of really hot stuff, decrease the cayenne pepper in the Buffalo Sauce.  EXCELLENT recipe.  Can't wait to do it again.

So quick and easy, and an amazing taste! I substituted the vegetable oil with olive oil and added 1 1/2 teaspoons of garlic while cooking the shrimp. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

We didn't like the angel hair pasta with this. Way too much and the flavor took away from the shrimp. I would decrease the pasta next time and cook in chicken broth for some flavor. Otherwise bland like another reviewer stated. I think the shrimp could stand on its on and just leave the pasta out. The flavor of the shrimp was very, very nice. Also, this was not hot enough for us and we bought the jalapeno and hot sauces to the table to increase the heat.

We all liked this pretty well.  Son thought the noodles were too bland.  It is certainly easy to make...less than 35 minutes, unless you count peeling the shrimp.

Not bad at all and really easy to prepare. I added black olives and followed the suggestions of others and added sauteed garlic. Nice flavor and great light meal. Next time we will make it with chicken and hope it comes out just as good.

The dish was just ok. The sauce was nothing. Just buttery and almost tasteless. However, I will probably make this again and take my husband's suggestion of adding some heavy cream and parmesan cheese to thicken it amd make it creamy.

Made this and my wife loved it.  Having read the other reviews I got a little more creative and added oregano, tabasco sauce, and red pepper flakes to the other ingredients.   She can't wait for me to make this again!!
