This was Lemon Ice-Box Pie when I was growing up. I make it exactly like the recipe, but I make a meringue for the topping. The zest helps make it not too sweet, and it is better after refrigeration for a couple of hours before serving. I make a homemade graham cracker crust, using the crackers and melted butter-no sugar added to crust. It is super good!

Yum yum! So creamy and delicious and so easy! I used the 3 egg whites to make meringue for the topping instead of whipped topping. Whipped em up with 1/4 t. cornstarch, and added 3/4 c. Confectionate sugar. Let it get toasty & brwon under the broiler for a couple of minutes - watch it close! I agree that it is better after it sits in the fridge for a couple of hours!

This is one of my favorite pies.  Learned how to make this in home ec (50 years ago) in high school, only we used vanilla wafers for the crust.  Still use when I need a quick and delicious dessert.

After months of heavier and/or spicy fall and winter desserts I loved this refreshing lemon version of Key Lime Pie. As I do with my Key Lime Pie, I also added 1-1/2 tsp. of grated zest and baked it for just 15 minutes at 350 degrees.

I use this recipe but use the sour ornamental oranges for juice and zest. I also use a mix of sour cream and sugar, spread over the filling, then add zest, and "set" in a hot oven for about 10 minutes.

We really enjoyed this pie. Perfect tart/sweet combo. Using freshly squeezed lemon juice is a must. I also added the zest from 1/2 lemon. This recipe is also on the Eagle Brand site, with an added layer of raspberries. Very easy (10 oz bag of thawed raspberries and cornstarch; heated until thick and clear and then poured on top of the cooked lemon layer.) Hubby loves raspberries so I added it. I added approx. 1/8 cup sugar to the raspberries. Perfect. We will enjoy this again soon.

I used crushed pretzels for the crust and had a salty/sweet/tangy pie!  Next time, I will double the ingredients to do a really tall pie in a spring form pan. It must have a meringue or whipped topping because the top dries out easily.

I made this for the first time the other day. IT IS THE BEST LEMON PIE and so easy to make!!!!!!! I made it for my Sister's BBQ, what a big hit it was. It was so delicious I made two more the following day. I followed the recipe pretty much how it was written. The only two changes I made was: I added lemon zest to the lemon filling and than also to the cream topping and I made my own crust with vanilla wafers. Absolutely the best, so good after a BBQ! Would highly suggest this recipe to anyone. Thanks for sharing :o)

This is SO luscious and just.......wonderful! I did add a teaspoon of fresh grated lemon zest and I made my own graham cracker crust. I made no other changes or substitutions. We love this pie--it's already half gone!

This is my husbands favorite pie--bar none. His mother gave me this recipe when we were first married 28 years ago. The only thing I noticed was sometimes its a little runny after it sits, so I started putting 1/2t of cornstarch before mixing and it just comes out perfect everytime......its better than his mothers!!(which of course I love). Great pie.......

I love this pie! It is super easy #1 and everyone raves about it. It has now become a staple over the past few years for my Thanksgiving dinner. It is so versatile that even sometimes I use key limes or regular limes, oranges, or other citrus. YUM!

Super simple. Not worth it. I expected this to be similar to a key lime pie as the ingredients were similar, but it was not creamy or looked anything like the picture. The filling was dense and more cake like than pudding like. It barely covered the bottom of a 9 inch pie crust and one side looked like it "fell" as it was not puffy like the rest. The flavor was fine, but the presentation was just not there. I only used the yolks as called for but wondered if maybe it needed the whole egg after all? Huge fail. Sorry Eagle Brand, this didn't work for me.

great flavor, easy enough to prepare and went over very well at easter dinner!  i did add a little extra lemon juice based on other reviews and i think this made a difference...  also, used a vanilla wafer crust instead of graham cracker.

Loved this recipe.!!!!!! I took naples34102's advice and baked at 350o for 15-20 minutes...until set. I slathered whipped topping on top and garnished with berries before serving. This is a keeper...thanks!

I really enjoyed this one. The lemon filling reminded me of the filling in lemon meringue pie. It was also a snap to throw together. Will definitely make this one again when my lemons are in season.

I made this pie using the directions exactly as given.  I found it to be extremely sweet and very brown in color (not a nice lemon yellow as seen in the picture).  The EAGLE BRAND Sweetened Condensed Milk that I used was caramel in color.

As written, this is just okay, but add 1/2 teaspoon lemon extract and a few drops of yellow food coloring, and you've got a winner.  I prefer the graham cracker crust.  Cooking time can be a little long.  Sometimes it is done in only 20 minutes.

This dessert really couldn't get much easier.  I even made my own graham crust, and it still only took minutes to make.  It was a wonderful, light, tangy dessert, perfect for the summer!

Ok, I tweeked this a little. First, I added the zest of two lemons and used the juice from the lemons. Second...I used a merringue topping. I baked the pie for 1/2 the time and then added the meringue. Dropped the temp to 200 and baked for another 45 min. It was hit! Everyone loved it!

I loved the ease of this pie and the taste was delicious.  Yes, it is a bit sweet...and my kids loved it.  For adults, it was perfect with a cup of tea or coffee.  But my pie didn't come out with a yellow filling but rather a dull, creme color...but this is meant to be eaten not seen.  :)  I topped it with homemade whipped cream and yes, ultra-pasteurized heavy cream and sugar/artificial sweeteners/stevia works great.  *Cheers*

I followed the recipe as it was written and the pie turned out great.  Light, refreshing and a nice lemon flavor  I made it for a dinner and there was only one slice left, which my husband and I split the next day.  I'll be making this again.

I made this for Easter. My son & husband loved it.  I used low fat condensed milk and reduced fat graham crackers for pie crust.  We will have this again for a refreshing treat!

This was very good and easy!  Took it to a gathering and every single piece was gone.  It reminded me of key lime pie- I would imagine you could probably do this with lime juice too.

I really like this pie.  It is very lemony and EASY to make. I did use home grown lemons so I don't know if they made the pie more tart, but it took my husband about 2 bites before he decided he liked it.  Then he ate 2 pieces. It kind of reminds me of a dense tart custard.  I will make it again. One thing I did add was the zest of one lemon to the mixture.

Have been enjoying this pie for over 30 years, my mom passed this recipe down to me and it is the best. My family loves this pie and now I make it in a deep 9X13 pan and larger for family gatherings, picnics and parties.

Easy Easy Easy! This recipe could not have been easier. I gave it 4 stars because not everyone loved this pie, however, the pie did seem to disappear pretty quickly. This recipe is good for something quick and light tasting. I would make this again.

Not bad. I've had better, however, this is QUICK AND EASY!!! My husband made one for Thanksgiving. It lasted 24 hours so he had to make another one for the family.  He made the meringue. It would be great with whipped topping as well.

Made it yesterday and not impressed. I just didnt like the texture. Maybe I did something wrong but the directions are simple and it is easy to make. Teenage boys that ususally gobble everything up were not  crazy about it either. Not horrible just ok. Thanks anyway :)

This is the best lemon pie recipe I have found yet.  It turns out perfectly EVERY time!  I usually am told it looks like it came from a bakery!  I do top it with Cool Whip instead of merangue.  It is best to let the pie cool for 2 hours, top with Cool Whip and then chill for at least 2 more hours before serving

I made this for Easter dessert, and it was very well-received. I piped whipped cream on the top, and there are only a couple of pieces left! My husband thinks it could have a stronger lemon flavor though - maybe I'll add more juice next time. It was super easy though - I made it Saturday morning and then we ate it Sunday afternoon.

Excellent! I bake the crust for 15 minutes at 350. Remove and set aside. Mix up the lemon cream. Beat the whites from the 3 eggs with a little sugar. Pour the lemon cream into the pie shell and top with meringue. Bake at 350 for 15 to 18 minutes.

Easy as PIE and amazingly delicious. I followed others' advice and added about a teaspoon and a half of the zest of the two lemons I used to get the juice for the recipe. I have four kids and the entire pie was gone in about a minute. Next time, I'm making two or three pies because I want a second piece!

This was sweet.  I followed the recipe directly but added about a tsp of lemon zest.  Topped with meringue, used a frozen pie.  Not a dramatic dessert but tastes good.  Nice and quick.

I made this for Easter, so-so reviews.  Has a nice lemon flavor, I used a baked pie shell instead of a graham cracker shell.  Not as good as the old-fashion lemon meringue pie.
