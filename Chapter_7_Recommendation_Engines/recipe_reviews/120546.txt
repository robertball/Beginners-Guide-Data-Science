My son loved this cake!  I made it in a 9 x 13 pan and added walnuts also.  But it was just wonderful.  Everyone that tried just got this big smile on their face and their eyes lit up with that "WOW" look.  Once they were able to talk again they were asking for seconds.

My family loved this cake - especially my 2 year old.  I didn't have sour cream so I substituted lowfat vanilla yogurt, which added a great flavor.  I will try it with sour cream next time. I also only had chunky applesauce, which added a great "surprise" to the cake.  I had to bake this for 45 minutes.

I made this in a bundt pan and it came out very pretty. It is very good and easy. I liked it cold. Thanks!

I followed this recipe exactly except I used a bundt pan as others had. It took 10 minutes longer than stated in recipe. My wife said it tasted like a cinnabon. It was pretty good and very easy to make. I will make this again.

This was very good, considering there is no oil in the recipe. I liked that it only used egg whites, and the streusel layer really added flavor. I made it in a bundt pan, so it took a bit longer to bake. I think it would be better in the 9 X 13 pan. Good recipe!

This cake was very good. I didn't have sour cream on hand so I used yoqurt as a substitute and no glaze. It was supermoist.  I'll definitely make this one again!

Outstanding!  Rather than use the glaze I doubled brown sugar and cinnamon then added in 1/2 stick of melted butter.  I used a bundt pan and put in the middle.  It ended up sinking to the bottom to make a crust.  The kiddo loved it.

This is a very yummy cake. The glaze is a wee bit overpowering so I will make without the glaze next time. I didn't have a box of yellow cake mix so I used one that got from the site. For cake mix: 2 1/3 cups cake flour (2 tablespoons per 1 cup of all purpose flour for a sub for cake flour), 1 tablespoon baking powder, 3/4 teaspoon salt, and 2 cups sugar. I will probably double the cinnamon and brown sugar next time just because it is so yummy and gooey and the cake mix recipe makes a little bit more than a regular box of cake mix. I also used about 1 cup of applesauce instead of the 2/3 called for on account of the cake mix that I used. I also used a Bundt pan for this and it was very pretty!

Tasted really good.  It was very moist. I used homeade applesauce.  Will make this again sometime.  I gave some away to a neighbor that later came back and asked for the recipe.

Simply delicious....everyone enjoyed at our neighborhood BBQ yesterday. I made one change and it was to use a can of prepared vanilla frosting which I microwaved until pourable and use that as my glaze. Otherwise made no changes in the cake itself....love the brown sugar and cinnamon middle!

Simply awesome! Super moist and delicious. I love the fact that it's actually not that bad for you to eat. I also used yogurt instead of sour cream and it was great. The glaze gave it just the right amount of sweetness.

This was great and very easy to prepare.  It was a big hit at dinner.  It's a perfect recipe for a bundt pan. I made it in a 9x13 but a bundt pan would have made presentation better.  Everyone loved it.  Thanks for a great recipe.  I will be making it again.

This was great! We made it in a bundt pan and it was so pretty. Also we were out of sour cream so we subbed mayo. So moist and delicious. Will make again.

Great recipe!  I made this for a colleague who loves Honey Buns.  He and the rest of my office thought it was the best cake ever!  Very simple to make with this recipe but used a bundt cake pan.  Makes a perfect crust when flipped.  Next time I will make it with more of the powdered sugar mix for the icing (topping).

Very easy! I used 2 cups of white eggs, almost 1 cup of vege oil, doubled the filling, added small cut of peaches to the filling. I skipped the glaze and didn't miss it at all. Just nice with cream on side. It's so light I couldn't stop eating. My husband liked it but still prefers something else with chocolate. Thank you for the recipe! Will make this again as upside-down cakes next time.

Moist and delicious, even with the boxed cake mix.  The cake is very light and is far better than most other honey bun cakes that I've tasted.  This recipe is a keeper and I will make it over and over again.

I'd go 4.5 if I could.  Took this one to work for those of use who had to work on Thanksgiving - it was our "breakfast" with strong coffee.  Everyone raved & there was nothing left, in no time flat!

Oh my!  I can't express how yummy this cake was!  I had a honey bun cake at a party last year and I have been looking for a recipe for it.  This cake is so moist.  Goes great with a cup of peppermint tea.

This cake was really good.  Nobody who tried it didn't like it.  I didn't put the glaze on half of it, I put cool whip and thought it was better than the glaze.

This is simple and really good, I did not change a thing.  I poked holes in the top of the cake with a fork then added the glaze. Nice and moist!

I did not have enough sour cream only 3/4c so added 1/4c of block cream cheese. My husband does not like cream cheese but you could not taste it. They loved it.

This cake is so moist! We love it. And with hardly any fat we are thrilled! I baked mine in a tube pan, it is very eye appealing.

This was good but tasted like a box cake recipe. Still liked it and may make again. Was nice and moist.

Sorry, this cake just didn't do it for my family. It was really dry and didn't have much flavor and I followed the recipe to a T. Maybe I should have used mayo or yogurt as other reviewers did in place of the sour cream, but as written this cake is super blah.

This is a very simply yet delicious cake.  It can be dangerous because it didn't stay around my house long at all. I love it and will Definitely make it again.

This cake was sooooo good. I didn't have sour cream on hand so I used mayo as a substitute. It was supermoist. Just great! I'll definitely make this one again!
