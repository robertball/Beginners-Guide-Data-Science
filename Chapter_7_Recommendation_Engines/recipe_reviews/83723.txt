Its great to see online a recipe my Norwegian grandmother has taught me years ago to make, and I have had many times in Norway.  Although, there are a few differences.  I guess back in the day it was easier to say 1 egg to 1tbsp sugar to 1 cup milk to 1 cup flour. never heard of salt going in. And one major Norwegian recipe not included here was Cardamom.  All Norske's as far as I know put a heavy sprinkling of cardamom in the mix.  And all norskes roll this with strawberry jelly. Jordbear.  Oh yeah, they call it tinnepannekakke (thin pancake).  Here in the US we add some cinnamon and vanilla, but it's not neccessary.

Well, despite his skepticism about *Norwegian* pancakes being anything like crepes, my boyfriend was promptly enthused by these.  He thinks they are very excellent and can't wait for me to make these again.  I, too, thought them to be very tasty.  They were very easy to make(of course, you needed to overlook my inexperience at the flipping of them).  I added a dash of vanilla to the mix and then we smothered them with whipped brown sugar and cinnamon cream cheese, drizzled some maple syrup on the top, and sprinkled with powder sugar.  Great!  Thanks!

These are very good. My very Norwegian family has enjoyed Norwegian pancakes for generations. My Grandfather has loved to make these for us over the years. This recipe is just like his, except it doesn't have cardamom. So, I just added some cardamom to the mix and presto...there you have it! I eat these rolled with butter and powdered sugar, topped with homemade lingonberry sauce or with freshly cut strawberries. Absolutely wonderful!

Very easy to make, quick to prepare. We've had these for breakfast two days in a row. :)

Cooking technique is important: We don't have a crepe pan so used a regular frying pan instead. The batter needs to be thinly spread or it doesn't cook through. 

We made a side relish of peeled and diced apples and pears mixed with a little brown sugar and apple butter, then sauteed until soft. This was excellent with the pancakes and even better the second day. 

(Also used real maple syrup. Yum.) :)

This was quick and easy recipe to make for breakfast.  I used Pam and eye-balled the amount to go into the pan. Cooks quickly and easy to turn over.   I scaled back to 2 servings (got 4) and topped with the Apple-Cinnamon Syrup recipe.

I am not Norwegian, nor have i ever tasted Norwegian pancakes before, so i have no clue whether or not they came out how they should but they were yummy. Heavier than crepes, but lighter than American pancakes. They're that perfect in-between; not too filling, but very satisfying. I've made these at least 8 times in two weeks; trying different fillings. You can't go wrong with any filling. I used sweetened cream cheese, cream cheese and blueberry jam, blueberry jam alone, cream cheese and blueberry compote with fresh blueberries, chocolate ganach, plain with some butter and syrup, and my absolute favorite, chocolate with coconut pecan frosting so it was like German chocolate cake pancake. You can't go wrong with filling. However, with cardamom added i didn't think it tasted as good with the sweet fillings. without sweet fillings though it's delicious. But user BEWARE! Cardamom is a strong spice so know how much you like. Too much can be too powerful a flavor and you may hate it. But don't be dissuaded, add a little at a time each time you make it to find out what's right for your taste-buds

Excellent and simple recipe!  My turn for slight changes that make all the difference:  Add one banana to the mix when you stick it in the blender.  Cook the same, and instead of filling with butter, sugar, syrup, etc., fill it with applesauce!  It's SO much healthier and tastes incredible!  This is now my "thing" that people love to come over for breakfast for, and oh man is it easy to make!

Very similar to my BesteMor's recipe.  This is more of a north-west Norske recipe (which is where my BesteMor is from), whereas in Oslo they tend to do things a bit different.   Every Norwegian home has a different pancake recipe, but they are all good! :-)

Sorry, we didn't care for these at all.  Very bland.  We tried them with bacon, syrup, jam, peanut butter and powdered sugar, non of which seemed to help. (We tried each of these toppings separately, not together!)

Our family has made these for a generations, except we call them Swedish Pancakes! The beauty of this recipe is that you can add a little more liquid and make the pancake even thinner. We eat them, one at a time, by lying the pancake flat on a plate and putting a "line" of warm syrup down the center, then we roll the pancake into a "tube". My mother-in-law eats them with sugar or jam! Thank you for this posting! It's so good to share the Scandanavian joy!

I have never had Pannekaken before and if I made them correctly I found them to be a little thicker and eggier than crepes.  They were very good and very easy to make.  Thank God for non-stick pans.  Next time I would add a little vanilla extract to the batter.

I had to add a tsp of oil to my ingedients after ruining the first one. Also added a tsp of cardamom. Turned out great. I didn't taste them, but those who did thought they were delicious. Update: I tried one, and 1 tsp of cardamom is way too much for my taste. I second the notion that you should be very careful if you add that spice. I've never been a fan of it outside of certain breads. But since the recipe doesn't actually call for the spice, it still deserves 4 stars.

Tasty, but I prefer the dessert crepes from this website better.  These are much more eggy.  With that said,  they are a lot less delicate and held up better to folding and handling.

In Norway, we always eat these with blueberry jam and/or sugar. That's the traditional way in my family and everyone else I know! And every tuesday is pancake-day:-)
Try homemade blueberry jam, that's just wonderful.

I made these for my sister and myself for lunch. Oh. My. Goodness. I saw the reviews that suggested cardamom, so I added about 1/4 teaspoon, and the same with some cinnamon. We topped them with different things - I tried one with homemade cheese, and we used honey and apple butter and strawberry cream cheese, just trying them out. They are so good and I will definitely make them again!

This is almost exactly the recipe we use for our Norwegian Pancakes. I thought we were the only family calling them that. Everyone else calls them Crepes around us. 
The only difference between this recipe and ours is that we add sugar, not salt. They are easy to make and save well "if" you have left overs. Cut up fresh fruit is good on them, but they are the best with Pure Maple Syrup! Yum, yum, a favorite at my house!

I love these Pannekaken.  It's nice that my kids and husband do too.  We can each have our own choice of filling.  My oldest and I go for whatever fruit we have in the house, my youngest likes chocolate chips and marshmallows.  My husband prefers the traditional sweetened cream cheese filling/spread.

Awesome recipe and SO EASY! 

I sprinkled some powdered sugar, butter, and lemon juice on the center of each pancake and folded it up so the butter would melt. Oh, so good!! I'll be making these often.

We would eat these every sunday, and now every Christmas we have them, we always used just butter and powered sugar then rolled up. Still my favorite way.

My husband and daughter really liked these.  I try to cook a little healthier, so I used 1/2 c each of wheat and all purpose flours.  To fill, chopped strawberries mixed with a little thin jam.

These are a staple in our household now! We have been making these exactly according to the recipe for more than a year and they are my kids' favorite for breakfast. The texture and sweetness are perfect. They are suitable for use as crepes too. My kids love these with Nutella and banana or filled up with scrambled eggs and veggies.

My hubby grew up in a Finnish family and obsesses over these this pancakes.  They say they are very close to what his Bubup (Grandpa) used to make.  They came out pretty well, just watch the heat, you don't want to cook them too quickly.

So delicious!  I love crepes (which is what these are like) but I hate having to let the batter sit!  These are crepes at the very moment you are craving them.  Don't worry if they seem crispy when you cook them, I've found they soften up on the plate.  I have made these on multiple occasions and filled them with a variety of fillings and have yet to be disappointed.

Perfect!  I've been wanting to make these for awhile, but I thought they would be difficult or that I'd need a special pan, but this morning I decided, 'what the heck, I'll give it a go!"  They turned out so delicious and I was able to make them in my tiny'ish omelette pan (6" pan).  My son took one look and said, 'I wanted pancakes,' but after a bite, he was sold on them.  My hubby thinks I'm a kitchen genius now (good thing he wasn't in the kitchen when I started the blender without securing the lid!) anyways, these were tasty and pretty.  I made huckleberry sauce a few days ago (1 1/2 cups huckleberries, juice of a lemon, 1/3 cup sugar, 1/2 cup water, tbsp of cornstarch, simmered for 45 minutes) and I can't come up with a better way to use up my pricey huckleberries than on these pancakes.
I burnt a couple, these cook super duper fast so you end up chained to the stove until all the batter is gone, cooking a never ending supply of little pancakes, but even the slighly black 'cakes were tasty.  I just folded the charred bits under and smothered them in sauce, delightful!  Just a note about the number of servings, it says six, not sure if that means it makes six pancakes or serves six, there was enough for the three of us to stuff ourselves with pancakes and I have four leftover which I'm planning on saving for my son's breakfast tomorrow.  Also, I think these would be great in a Crepes Suzette recipe.

Great, simple recipe. I cannot make a pancake cooked through or not burnt to save my life. Finally something I CAN do. These turned out excellent. My swedish grandmother used to make them also. Had no clue they were so easy to make! Will make them every weekend now! This batter made 4 large and one small crepe for us. Our pan was pretty big though. I could only eat 1.5! Thanks in da wings.

I was so happy to see this recipe.  My Mom used to make what she called "egg pancakes" but she never shared the recipe, said it was just in "her head".  So I have tried to figure it out, but was never able to, so now I am so happy, and will share this with my kids who really liked her "egg pancakes".  We are all full blooded Norwegian!!!

Excellent, fast, and tasty.  Took a few times to get the flipping perfect.  Rolled with whipped cream, blueberries, and topped with icing sugar.  I also threw a bit of ground flax seed in.  My 12month baby loved it (he didn't get the 'good stuff' though) and so did my 4yr old.

This is a really easy and tasty recipe that yields more than 6 pancakes. I made 8 - 10 servings. I also added in some lemon zest and vanilla extract for extra flavor.

Easy and delicious recipe! At the suggestion of others, I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla as well. The addition of a maple walnut cream cheese filling really made them very special. I then topped rolled pancakes with walnuts and maple syrup.  Would be great to serve with just butter and cinnamon sugar as well!! This is a keeper!!

UNBELIEVABLE!!  So good.  My mother and I had some similar to these at a restaurant in Ft. Lauderdale at a place that specialized in Norse-American cooking.  These were just as good if not better - YUM!  I served with cream cheese in the middle with a dash of cinamon and then made a berry compote out of butter, frozen berries and real maple syrup.  Let that simmer while you are making the pannekaken and pour over the top when ready to eat - YUMMY!  :)

Super easy and very quick to make.  Had them for breakfast yesterday.  Used nutella on some and homemade marionberry jam on the others.  Mmmmmm mmmmmmm  Sprinkled powdered sugar on all of them.  I did add a good teaspoon of cardamom to the batter but couldn't really "taste" it.  Great breakfast change up from the norm.  Thanks

Although I would call these "Swedish" pancakes, they are definitely the best homemade ones I've ever had! For years I've infrequently bought mixes at various places to make these and they never turned out well. These taste just like a favorite restaurant's version. The recipe could not get any simpler also.

These are just like my Aunt used to make us when we went to visit.

I made them with whole wheat pastry flour and added a little ground flaxseed. We put on a little brown sugar and roll them up. Yummy!!

This recipe for Norwegian pancakes is very good.  When my father and I make them, we put a piece of cooked bacon in the pan before we put the batter in.  Once cooked, we roll them with either syrup or brown sugar and cinnamon in them.   Delicious

Hi! Nice pancakes!! I`m writing from Norway, and just want to give some information about Norwegian pancakes. Never heard about cardemom used in pancakes.. The traditional way of eating them is with sugar, fried bacon and blueberry jam and yellow pea soup. Really really nice!

Very tasty, but rich, so you wouldn't want to eat them all the time. I used lactose-free skim milk, but kept everything else the same. I ate mine with margarine and syrup, and my husband had his with peanut butter and jelly.

I omit the salt and add about 1/4 tsp cardamom.  Spread with homemade raspberry jam, roll up and YUM!  My husband prefers these to any other kind of pancake!

These were light and tasty.  I served with a dusting of powdered sugar.  I will try a variety of toppings in the future.

These were pretty good.  They cooked and flipped like a dream.  My boyfriend and I made them with eggs and bacon on the side and also put cheese on them.  Our only complaint is that they were a bit too "eggy" tasting,

Wow this is really good, only thing I added was a touch of vanilla extract. I made it for my 7 year old son. I told him I was going to make him a special breakfast since today is his birthday. He loved it and said he wants me to make this everyday. Thank you.

These are like Swedish pancakes and I amended mine slightly so that it would be similar to my mother-in-law's own (she doesn't have a recipe herself, so I had to guess as to the measurements!)  I changed it from 1/4 tsp salt to 1/2 tsp and added a 1/2 tsp of vanilla sugar to the mix.  I too used an electric mixer for mine.  My Swedish husband enjoyed them with strawberry jam on top.

I made these and they were very yummy.  I added 1 teaspoon of cardamon to mine and just wisked it all together, and it was fine. I baked mine in a 375 oven. I used a 9" preheated pie pan, sprayed it with Pam, then poured in 1 cup of batter.  I lightly sprinkled them with sugar and baked them for 25 minutes.  I put 3 in the oven at once, and when they were done, I cut them in half and served them with strawberry jam and whipped cream.  Everyone loved them!

This is very close to my grandmother's recipe.  Of course hers was not measured exactly, and that is how I learned to make them.  Make Norwegian pancakes in a well seasoned cast iron skillet. Simply swirl the batter around the pan to coat the bottom and they will turn out perfectly. Well... the first one always sticks:)

I'm raised in denmark and we always made these at my mom's. The batter is so good very tasty but i had one problem:  getting the right shape i think you will need a lot of practice to be able to make them nice looking. but the taste is wonderful. give it a try.

I made these for Mother's Day and they turned out great!   They are very similar to what my German mom made for me as a child.   I thought they were really really good but I need something to blow-me-away to be five stars.  I'll definitely make them again.

THESE WERE AWESOME! I've never had Norwegian Pancakes-Pannekaken and I was very happy with the ease of cooking. I would have to say, these were better than any crepe recipes I've tried and would like to replace this recipe with all of my crepe recipes. Easier to flip and not as fragile. Thank you so much!

My mom made me these for my birthday every year growing up!  They are a family tradition...even though we called them Swedish Pancakes.  You really have to practice making them so you get them flipped correctly, but once you do.....delicious!  We served them spread with a little butter, sprinkled with sugar, and rolled up.  YUUUUUMMMMMM!!!!!!!!!!

Very good but needed 1 more egg to give it that slightly "rubbery" crepe texture and great taste. Added vanilla and a pinch of cinnamon. I melted butter added lemon, put in a tablespoon per crepe then sprinkled powdered sugar. Incredible. Be sure to cook with Pam not butter for best consistency and appearance.

It's my kids new favorite breakfast.  They love it with wrapped around berries with whipped cream on top.  It is also very good with some vanilla in the mix, and even better with blueberries in the mix (but cut the milk slightly to compensate for the berries).

Delicious

I was happy to find this recipe, my dad used to make these for us on Sunday mornings and it was always our favorite breakfast.  My wife wasn't a big fan of the texture, but my daughter and I love them.  I use a hand crank beater mixing the eggs and milk together until frothy, and then mix in the dry ingredients for a solid 3-5 minutes, until the batter is very smooth.  We usually top with butter and sugar but these are very versatile and the recipe can be tweaked to compliment your toppings.  Thanks again for the recipe!

Literally just made and ate this!! I thought it was a very light and airy form of a pancake but thicker than a crepe.  It was delicious and I followed the directions to a T.  I simmered a frozen mix of berries over the pancakes and added a bit a whip cream!!!

Being Norwegian, I always double the recipe using 10 eggs and add 1/2 cup of melted butter and increase sugar to taste. And add flour until it has the consistency of liquid yogurt. I cooked them all up and the kids add peanut butter and powdered sugar and eat them for lunch. I also use an electric mixer to mix. If you let the batter sit for about a 1/2 hour, they will be easier to cook. My Grandmother ate them with a little powdered sugar and lemon juice. Grandpa ate them with lingonberries.

My dad taught me how to make Norwegian pancakes.  He learned from his mother.  They didn't measure anything, but my dad said that his mom used one egg per person, but he used two eggs per person and then added milk and flour until it's the right consistency.  He added a pinch of sugar to help it brown.  This recipe works well and one of my daughters asked if we could have Norwegian pancakes for her birthday coming up soon.  She's grown and is a grandma herself  now, but on her birthday they'll come over for Norwegian pancakes for dinner.

This was amazing, I make the pancakes exactly as shown, then had a blast sauteing mandarin oranges with a vanilla peach sauce to fill them with and an ice wine syrup lightly drizzled on top. The end result was divine!

I am visiting my in-laws and this was a big hit with them. I've been trying many authentic Mexican foods made by my sister-in-law so I thought I would make something from my Norwegian heritage. Nerve racking, but worth it. This was just like my mother made them. 5 stars!!

I love this recipe! The pancakes were fluffy and satisfying. I used strawberries with maple syrup drizzled over them as a stuffing. However, I omitted the salt and still tasted great. Thanks for a great recipe!

It definitely needs some sort of filling, but it is tasty and doesn't fall apart the second you try to take it out of the pan.

I made these exactly as instructed.  I wasn't sure if they'd be so different from crepes, which we make all the time.  Essentially, they're eggier and as a result, "sturdier".  They also be definition would be higher protein and lower carb.  All in all, the kids loved them.  Will probably make again.

Fantastic recipe! My husbands family is from Norway this is how they make em, nice and thin. My nine children love these pancakes. We make them at least once a week.They were also a hit at the children's 4-H cookoff. Everyone HAD to have a copy of the recipe. We served them with strawberries and whipped cream:)

I was expecting these to be different than traditional pancakes, but I wasn't a fan of the eggy texture.

My mom made a very similar recipe growing up. I was craving it one day as a college student away from home and I tried this recipe out. It was so good, exactly like I remembered from when I was young. I like to eat them topped with butter and powdered sugar or Nutella.

I will definately be making them again, and they were so easy to cook!

We have pancakes every Sunday and these were such a fun change.  Simple to make and so yummy.  We just used a little strawberry jam on them and they were great.  Will definitely make again!!

I used whole wheat flower and followed the rest of the ingredients exactly. We have a pancake/crepe tradition in our family, and I am the "crepe" girl. This recipe had my dad gushing, even though he has had my pancakes over 500 times in the past two decades. I'd say that warrants 5 stars!

Good, even though I burnt the one side because I'm inept at flipping things. My boyfriend thought they were a bit bland, so we topped them with cinnamon sugar and butter. I cut them into bite-sized pieces so we could share. Will be making again!

I was looking for a thin pancake to stack and this one was excellent. I used whole wheat flour and they came out perfect. We spread just a little bit of peanut butter and jelly on one, then stacked another and did the same, then stacked one more on top and sprinkled with powdered sugar. So yummy. Next time I want to try rolling them up with the topping inside.

I have been making these Pannekaken's for over a year now, if I miss a week I get in big trouble with my loved ones. I like to mix the batter in the blender, it makes the pannekaken's a little lighter and fluffier. My only complaint about this recipe is that the  batter separates before you can make the whole recipe's worth of batter.

Delicious!  Made them for my mom for muders' dacht (dutch for mother's day) and we all loved them!  Definitely a keeper.  However, add more sugar if you don't want them to be bitter.  Also, pour on enough batter to thinly coat a large skillet and cook each side for about 10-15 seconds.  Then put them on a plate and put a little blackberry jam in the middle and roll it up!

Great recipe! It's pretty close to crepes. I wanted to make mine a bit healthier so I used half all purpose flour and half whole wheat flour, sifted together. Based on other reviews I added a splash of vanilla. For those without a blender, you can mix it just fine with a spoon. Used 1/3 cp measurer to pour into the pan. They came out fantastic! I made some blueberry orange sauce to fill them with...absolutely delicious!

I think next time I'm going to try what another reviewer suggested: 1 egg, 1 tbsp sugar, 1 cu. flour, 1 cu. milk - otherwise it came out great!  I put a thin layer of whipped cream cheese and low sugar strawberry preserves, rolled 'em up - thanks for sharing!!

I really love these.  Easy enough to make but I did add a pinch more sugar to the batter.   For the filling I used a recipe I got from this site for blueberry sauce from Isybel.  Just like the restaurants sell.

Brings back memories of my Norwegian grandmother making these for my family.
She filled them with a filling made with 1 container of cottage cheese, 3 eggs and some sauted onion, She would roll them, like an egg roll and place in a greased pan/ top with butter. Bakein a 350 degree oven for about 30 minutes until golden brown. SO GOOD!

This recipe works wonderful!!  I make if for my husband and fill it with cheesey scrambled eggs with sausage.  If you want a sweeter crepe, then try adding 2 TBLS of sugar.

Delicious and simple recipe.  Also good if you add extra vanilla to the recipe and top with bananas grilled slightly in a honey, brown sugar, and cinnamon mix.

This is a good basic dependable recipe. Thank you.  I was tired of coming up with ways to fix chicken and rice and decided to mix things up w/ breakfast for supper.   We picked 3 pancake recipes from this site including this one, of course (They were all good). With these I added brown sugar cinnamon cream cheese mixture and canned apples (leftover from another day) and I filled some w/ egg salad. Yup! can you believe.. .well, everyone is happy and filled. . .Nuff said!

I was just hungry before and didn't have anything of substance in my fridge, so I decided to make these. I heated up some frozen berries I had in my freezer and served the crepes with these in the middle, with icing sugar. Perfect for a late night snack! Super easy to make, pretty much failsafe.

I wound up making a third of the recipe instead and it was delicious with lemon and sugar. Perhaps it could do with a little vanilla but that isn't necessary. The entire recipe is about 860 calories- divided by 6 is  143; so, it'll definitely do you some good to add fresh fruit and perhaps some creme.

I make this recipe as written regularly per the kids' request. I have two smaller non-stick frying pans going at the same time to cook them. Once you get the temperature right, they cook quickly. I don't use too much butter when cooking, it prevents the great golden brown bubbles from forming. We put bringebærsyltetøy and butter & sugar on them. YUM!

Easy recipe to make!  I found it took a little trial and error to find the right temp. to make them.   I smeared oil/butter in the pan with a brush in between each pancake even though I was using a non-stick pan.   I did make a batch adding 1/4 tsp cardamon, 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp vanilla to the batter which I really liked.

Delicious and so easy! Took less than 20 minutes from start to finish. I reduced the amount of servings to 4. I remember making these with my sister's when we were little. We filled them with homemade blueberry jam then sifted a little 
 powdered sugar on top. Took me right back to my childhood!

It is a great basic recipe, but you must have CARDAMOM before you can call it a NORWEGIAN pancake!  I add 1 tsp ground cardamom to this basic recipe, and then spread with raspberry or boysenberry jam to make it perfect!

I made it for dinner and even though I made 4 servings worth we split them between three people. It took an hour to make instead of 20 minutes, as I am currently still learning how to cook properly. I would describe it as more of a dessert pancake than for a meal.

These are so great! I actually didn't have milk so I did almost  the full cup and 1/2 using water, and about a tablespoon of half n half and they still turned out so dang good..with less calories might I add. Sprinkled some cinnamon and sugar on them, then I rolled em up and ate them!

Will be making these again very soon!

Mostly the same as the recipe I have been making since my grandmother showed me while visiting from Norway. She did not measure anything. But we used 6 eggs, then flour and sugar in the same proportion to the number of eggs used. Then we poured in milk until the desired thickness was reached and then added in the melted butter last. The number of eggs used made a smaller or larger batch. 6 eggs made enough for a family of 5 or 6. We used syrup for the Americans and we Norwegians used butter and jam. :-)

It was great, just like in Norway. I made one round and decided to double the sugar, I would recommend to do that. Also, I thought it meant mixer instead of blender, it may seem strange, but the blender is the way to go. Great breakfast!

My recollections of Norwegian pancakes were when I was a very young little girl.  My Bestemor used to put homemade strawberry jam in the middle and roll them up and dust them with confectioners sugar -  It was NIRVANA!   This recipe is exactly what I was looking for!  I love putting everything in the blender...it truly made my life a heck of a lot easier -  I did add a 1/2 tsp. of cardamom to the mixture to make it even more reminiscent of the pancakes my Bestemor used to make.  Thank you for a trip down memory lane...I have made this recipe many times and each time, I can feel my Bestemor right next to me.

What a fantastic recipe! A long time ago, when I was romantically involved with someone from the island of Fotö, Sverige, I learned how to make these from her mormor (her mother's mother). Well, that was a long time ago, and the relationship didn't last, but I still remembered those pannekoken (and her mormor, who was one of the nicest people I've ever met, and whom I think about every time I make these)... and I never got it exactly right until I read this PERFECT recipe. Thank you!

Added cardamom, cinnamon, and vanilla...  My wife immediately shared the adapted recipe with her Norwegian family!  What a great recipe!

My husband is a soldier, and he's always hungry after PT...I tried this out the other day as a surprise without much reservation on how they would turn out. I didn't change anything, and I used all ingredients listed...and they were delicious and easy to make (and flip). I would suggest using a non-stick pan, or some non-stick spray or I could see where people might have problems. This was yummy, and reminded me of crepes...I only wish I put nutella on them instead of syrup. ;)

My family loves these pancakes.  I too add cardamom-1/4 to 1/2 tsp. Tastes pretty much like Krum Kake when you add the cardamom.  I also like to substitute buttermilk for 1/2 the milk

Wow, this recipie is AWFUL. I made an account, just to comment on this recipe. 
Not only are the pancakes rubbery and a little slimey, the "batter" seperates in under 30 seconds. These things aren't even sweet! And I used extra sugar. 
I couldn't find my usual Pannekaken recipe, so I thought this one would be fine. NOPE.
Don't even bother with this thing. It's terrible.
