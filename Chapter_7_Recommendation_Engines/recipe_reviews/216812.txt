Very good will definitly make again. I'm not even a rice person I usually hate rice but I LOVED this recipe, rice and all it came out perfect. The only thing I did different was season my chicken with creole seasoning, garlic powder an pepper I added 2tbls of creole seasoning to the soup mixture because I didn't have any curry seasoning other that I stuck to the recipe. Highly recommend :)

DELICIOUS!  Sauteed garlic with other veggies.  Used boneless thighs which cooked in about 40-45 minutes.  BE SURE your rice is cooked-look on mix directions before putting in oven & I cooked in chicken stock not water.

This came out way undercooked and watery, completely inedible.  I would never recommend this recipe to anyone.

This recipe full of flavor--my husband and I loved it! I modified the recipe somewhat to go along with what I had in the house--I used carrots instead of celery, cream of mushroom soup, 1 cup of white rice, chicken tenders and no parmesan cheese. The only thing I would change is the amount of onion--next time I would only use about 3/4 of an onion. Overall it was fantastic!

Delicious. I didn't have sour cream so I used heavy cream. Also important is your curry. I used Kashmir garam marsala northern India curry blend.

Simply amazing. I dont care for mushrooms so I left them out and used creme of chicken soup. I prefer chicken breasts so next time I think I will use those instead. The rice was great. one could use the recipe for curry rice and leave the chicken out.

Used instant rice, added red pepper flake, used chicken legs. Was pretty good-- had to bake chicken for 1.5 hrs.

Very, very good and will definitely make again.  I followed other reviewer's suggestions and used carrots and not celery.  Nice colour too.  Also I didn't have sour cream so I used canned milk  and I used regular cream of mushroom soup. I added garlic with the onion.  But the biggest change I made was to use couscous instead of rice.  My family really enjoyed this meal.

I seasoned my chicken really well adding celery, onion, Jamaican curry, black pepper, garlic powder, olive oil, Himalayan sea salt and a bottle of Korma Curry from Trader Joe's. I topped brown rice with the curry chicken. Yum!

My family loves this. We stuck to the recipe except for the fresh ginger that I added to the cooked onion mixture. After putting it together I cooked in the oven for an hour at 350 degrees just like the recipe said. When I checked it the chicken wasn't anywhere near done so I raised the temp to 450 and cooked another 30 min or so. Finally when the top was nicely brown and the chicken was done we dug-in and had a great meal.

I made this for supper last night we loved it! I used BLSL breasts and doubled the recipe. Subbed 6oz HG french onion dip and 1/2 cup evaporated milk as I had no sour cream and added some carrots for color. Chopped chicken into bite sized pieces and sauteed with the veggies and a sprinkle of curry powder. It turned out firm yet creamy! Thank you for a great recipe!
