I didn't have maple syrup in the house so I replaced the maple syrup with 1/4 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of honey...boy did I get rave reviews from the family!  Everyone loved this, including my youngest daughter who can be quite picky when it comes to vegetables.  This will be seen on our dinner table again!

Nice complement to pecan breaded chicken  made from this site. Makes girls like me more. Which is peculiar since my charming personality should be enough.

I essentially made this but with a slight twist. I boiled 2 sweet potatoes and 1 carrot then mashed them together with 1/4 milk, 2 tbsp of honey and 1 tbsp of margarine. It was delicious! I will definitely make it again. On a side note I've also made this with a crisp. To do that put the finished mash into a casserole dish. In a separate bowl combine 1 tbsp melted butter, 1/2 crushed bran flakes and 1/4 cup pecans and 2 tbsp of brown sugar. Mix well and sprinkle on top of squash mash. Broil it in oven until crisp is lightly browned. Serve. Delicious!

I didn't need to break out the mixer... potatoes were soft enough to just mash up with a fork. All you really need here is half the butter and the syrup the recipe calls for and NO milk. SO much healthier that way (I even used light syrup). A couple dashes of cinnamon and yum!

Thank you for sharing this.  We love nutritous sweet potatoes and this one is easier than the casseroles that are so popular. The maple syrup gives it a wonderful taste. Didn't rate kid opinion because we don't have any at home. Did not need this much milk.

This was simple and easy to make. I used only 1/3 cup of milk, and 1/3 cup of maple syrup, and 4 tablespoons of butter. Sweet potatoes are so creamy that they don't need a lot of liquid. I also added 1/8 teaspoon of nutmeg, and 1/8 teaspoon ground cloves. I mashed these all together with a potato masher, and then I baked them in the oven for 20 minutes at 350 degrees to give them a "twice baked" fluffyness. My son loves these potatoes.

I roast my potatoes whole in the oven then peel the skin after they cool a little.  The flavor is much better than with them boiled.

These were okay - just a little too sweet for me but my daughter really enjoyed this. I took a combination of other suggestions to reduce the sweetness: used 1/4c maple syrup, 1/4c honey and 2 TBLS brown sugar, A nice change to mashed potatoes but I'm not sure if I'm going to attempt them again. Still, thanks rainspirit for sharing the recipe.

30 minutes was not enough time for the potatoes to cook. Next time I will cook them longer. Instead of all that maple syrup I used about 2 Tablespoons of brown sugar, 2 tablespoons of white sugar and topped it with cinnamon. Came out good, but a little lumpy because of the undercooked potatoes.

4.5 stars.  I peeled and cut up 3 potatoes.  Boiled them and mashed them.  Mixed in 1/2 cup milk, 6 TBS butter, 1 TBS brown sugar, and 1 TBS of honey.  Excellent.  The sweetness was perfect (would not add any more sugar or honey).  Made 3 meals-worth for our family (2 adults, 4 kids).

I could eat the whole 6 servings!  I didn't add as much milk b/c it would have been too runny.  I add the butter first, then the syrup, and add milk until it is the right consistency.

Yummy - the syrup adds lots of flavor. Many people liked this one, but we couldn't eat to much at a time since the flavor was kind of strong.

I scaled this back to suit just two people. I peeled, cubed and boiled 1 large Yam for about 10 minutes. I added a little butter and milk, to taste. I knew the sweet potatoes would be naturally sweet so I only drizzled enough maple syrup to heighten it a little more without it being "overly" sweet. I stired and whipped the potatoes until they were the right consistency. Yams never disappoint me because they are already sweet and tasty. But with the addition of a the butter and maple syrup, these mashed sweet potatoes were buttery, flavorful and fluffy. I can already see that these will be a rotation for this year's Fall and Holiday meals. Tonight we all enjoyed these along with, "Turkey Veggie Meatloaf Cups, " "Garlic-Chive Mashed Potatoes, " and " Quick and Easy Sauteed Spinach, " also from this website.

These were easy and good- I only added cinnamon. I also used only 1 tbsp butter & halved the recipe. I boiled my potatoes whole, then cut them in half and scooped out the insides. I think that is easier than peeling and chopping raw potatoes.

I like sugar as much as any sugar-holic, but don't care for candy-sweet dishes with a meal.  This recipe was exactly what I wanted - the taste of sweet potatoes that wasn't drowned out by sugar, nuts, and the dreaded marshmallows.  After washing and piercing them, I placed the potatoes in glass pan with a bit of water, covered with pierced plastic wrap and microwaved them as another reader suggested.  The skin slipped off easily and to avoid the issues of strings, I sliced them into disks, then mashed using a hand masher.  Based on the sage advice of others, I added the remaining ingredients incrementally until I achieved the desired consistency and taste.  they were going so fast that I hid a couple of servings in the fridge to enjoy with the turkey leftovers today. Many thanks to the contributor - this recipe will be on our table for decades to come!!

These were great - the key is to slowly add milk until the potatoes get the right consistency.  The skins can be left on, they blend into the mixture well.  I also added cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt to taste.

Delicious!  I've made it twice - once with maple syrup and the other time with half honey & half brown sugar.  I also added a healthy dose of cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg.  Next time I'm going to try adding a little pumpkin pie spice.  I've never really measured anything in this recipe - I just keep adding stuff 'til it tastes good.  A big hit and people will think you spent a lot more time on it than it actually takes!  YUM!  :)

I had a catered dinner at work and there was quite a bit of baked sweet potatoes left, so I wanted to see what could be done with them.  I came across this recipe and thought I would give it a try.  The only changes I made was that I only needed 1/3 cup of milk and used sugar-free syrup (we are all watching our weights).  It was a hit.  My family loved it and this will definitely be a side dish I will make often.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

I just made these for Thursday's Thanksgiving Dinner--They are so good, I can't wait for my guests to try them.  I cut down on the maple syrup and added some brown sugar and cinnamon.  I will probably also add some chopped pecans when serving.  I used sugar free syrup and splenda brown sugar to make them diabetic friendly!

Made a few modifications but everyone loved it - especially the kids.  I cut the yams in half & nuked them for about 8 minutes, let them cool for 10 minutes and them scooped them easily right out of the skin.  Added about about 2 tsp butter, fresh ground black pepper, a pinch of cinammin & about 2 tbsp of maple syrup.  Just mashed with a potaoe masher (didn't need a blender)   Also cooked 6 slices of bacon until crispy - chopped and stirred in & the end.  Bacon isn't the healthiest add i know but will probably do it again for special occassions.

Delicous & easy enough for a week night.  Once the potatoes were tender (at least 40 min total), it came together in minutes. I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and just a tiny bit of syrup.  Also only used about 1/4 cup of milk and wayyy less butter!

Made some with syrup, and some with brown sugar. I preferred the ones with brown sugar, I guess just because I associate it more with sweet potatoes! I added the ingredients little by little to achieve the best taste and consistancy.  Went well with Pecan Crusted Chicken!!

Made this last night with chicken and stuffing casserole.  Used only 3 sweet potatoes so adjusted ingredients. I did not have maple syrup so I used a little honey and brown sugar.  I also added cinnamon and nutmeg to it.  Did not need all the milk called for.  Teenagers liked it, but the 5 yo would not touch it, but only because he knew it was sweet potatoes.

This was good but not great but I am going to make it again. I would like to try a little less boil time and give the potatoes a little more chunkiness.  This time was a little too much like baby food.  Also, it needs another ingredient in it, maybe chunky pecans.

Absolutely delicious!! I'll be making these again and again. The only changes I made were to use half & half instead of milk, and 3/4 of the butter. A wonderful and easy fall treat!

Loved these potatoes! I used a hand mashed rather than an electric mixer because I prefer some pieces of "clumped" potato rather than a whipped texture.  Excellent.

I've made this recipe a few times now and they are so good. My almost 2 yr. old will even eat them and she has been very picky eater latly. I have used brown sugar and honey as suggested by another reviewer because we were out of maple syrup and they are really good that way also.

I cut back a little on the butter (about 1/4 c) and syrup (about 1/2 c) and added a whole bunch of cinnamon.  When it comes to sweet potatoes, I've always preferred them simple and baked to desserty casserole style, so this simple recipe works well for me!  For someone living alone, they keep well in the fridge as a side for various meals through the week.

Good flavor. I recommend adding all of the ingredients little by little to taste, because I'm sure I used quite a bit less, and simply stopped adding when it got too sweet/mushy/buttery for me. A teeny dash of cinnamon is great in it, too.

Well, this recipe just didn't work for me. Wierd texture, and the sweet potato taste is just too strong for me (I like them all fancied up and hidden under sweets and cinnamon).

The overall taste of these was very good.  I have some issues with the ingredient amounts and directions though.  First off, I was preparing this for 2 people, so I only bought 2 sweet potatoes instead of 6.  When I started putting the sweet potato chunks in the pan to cook, it was clear there would be way too much, so I really only used a little more than 1 sweet potato. Just 1 probably would have been enough, as we had leftovers.

Second, the instructions say to add milk until it's the desired texture and then add the butter and maple syrup.  Those ingredients thinned out the sweet potatoes even more and it ended up a lot more liquid than I liked.  So I would recommend adding the butter and maple syrup first, and then if you want it any thinner add milk last.

My 7 year old son decided he wanted to make mashed sweet potatoes, I asked him if he wanted to add maple syrup like this recipe said and he wanted to.  But we only had pancake syrup.  It is amazing!

We had them for Easter Dinner and they were good.  Husband doesn't like sweet potatoes, but he ate them and even commented on how good they were.  Will make again, but might tweak just a little with seasonings.  I didn't have to add any milk, because the potatoes were already wet enough.

These were great!!! I had traditionally used a recipe that had brown sugar in it as well, and was looking for something slightly less sweet.  This wins a place at the Thanksgiving table every year!

This was a good recipe, it's possible that I should have used real maple syrup instead of pancake syrup.  I had to add brown sugar, cinn, and nutmeg to cover up the pancake taste of the sweet potatoes.

Time saver suggestion: microwave the sweet potatoes. Wrap them in either wax paper or paper towel and microwave between 3-5 minutes for a large sweet potato. The skin separates easily and you can mash it with a fork. Like other reviewers, I reduced the ingredients and added cinnamon and....yum!

The family loved it.  A healthier alternative to mashed potatoes.  I used brown sugar instead of maple syrup and seasoned to taste with cinnamon.  Goes great with a fruit stuffed pork roast!

These were great.  The whole family loved them.  After reading the reviews I added all of my ingredients to taste, reduced the amount of milk, subbed margarine for the butter, added a little honey, brown sugar, butter lite maple syrup and a pinch of cinnamon.  Was very good and I will make it again.

I made this for Thanksgiving last year and it was a hit.  Made it again this year at my husband's request!  However, I used Eggo Buttery Syrup and didn't have to use any actual butter in it at all!  It's so simple and very tasty!

VERY good, and different side! I did not add any milk, just butter, maple syrup and a little cinnamon.

This is the best recipe for mashed sweet potatoes!!!  It's the maple sugar! This is always a hit at pot luck dinners.

I've made this several times, and we really love it.  I add a touch of vanilla (1/2 to 1 tsp) to round the flavor out, of this very simple recipe.  I don't time the boiling; just when they're very soft.

Way too sweet!  I cut the milk and just added butter and 1/4 cup of brown sugar.  This is a great side dish or a great topping for steel cut oats.

I was skeptical about these, but man was I wrong?!?  They are absolutely delicious.  I made them a day ahead for the "Addicting Sweet Potato Burrito" recipe also found on this site.  They were so delicious that I was worried I may not have enough leftovers for the burrito meal (made them exactly as stated in the recipe above).  Never fear though!  You can always make more!

The maple flavor is really strong, so if you're not into it you might want to add less syrup.  Otherwise a crowd pleaser!

Delicious!  My recommendation-- don't skimp on the butter! I don't add the maple syrup, and use nonfat milk to even out the added butter calorically.

I added a small pinch of salt and a few shakes of cinnamon, and used sugar-free syrup for the sake of a diabetic in our household. Since we were spared a few calories using the lower calorie syrup, I was able to use heavy cream instead of milk and still keep it under 200 calories per serving. I didn't need quite as much heavy cream as the original recipe called for in milk, so I imagine that if I had used milk in the recommended quantity, they would be a bit runny.

The results were heavenly and this will absolutely be a new kitchen staple for us, with my changes incorporated.

As a side note, I don't know if my sweet potatoes are abnormally large or not, but there is *no way* there are only 6 servings in the original recipe unless they are using much, much smaller potatoes than I used. I got 10 generous servings out of a *half*-batch!

For a less sweet version I use butter sour cream and a can of chopped green chilies.  My family who won't eat sweet potatoes normally, love this.

A bit sweet with the maple syrup.  I omitted the syrup all together and used sweet potatoes, not yams, which are a lot less sweet, but hard to find...yummy!

Very good recipe.  I used half of the syrup and butter suggested.  I thought it could have used even less syrup because I added more milk to mask the syrupy taste but my husband loved it.  I suggest adding the butter and syrup in very small increments as suggested.

Great idea, husband and me really enjoyed this.  For 2 people, used one extra large sweet potato, 4 tblsp light butter, 2 tblsp skim milk, and sugar free maple syrup to taste.  We liked ours just a little sweetened, maybe used approx. 1/4 cup syrup.  Ended up with about 3 servings.

I've been making mashed sweet potatoes for a long time.  I bake my potatoes (be sure to put foil under them).  Then when done I remove the skin and rice them with just butter and a little salt.  My DH doesn't like sweet potatoes with a bunch of sugar.  He loves these.

This recipe was delicious. Didn't really follow the amounts, I just eyeballed them and added what I thought was enough and how my family prefers it.  I used pure maple syrup and poured only a bit of a time to taste, I didn't want it to come out to sweet. Also sprinkled some cinnamon.  It was perfect, will do again, thanks!

I haven't always been a huge fan of sweet potatoes, but I know they are good for me, so I thought I would try this recipe! Mmm... Super awesome!!!! They tasted more like dessert than potatoes. I added some brown sugar and put in less maple syrup too and they came out great! Yummy!

Very simple & tasty.  I used light butter and sugar free syrup and they're still delicious.  Got lots of compliments when I served them as a side to ham at a recent football game.

Thanks so much! I'd bought sweet potatoes because I'd heard they were a nice change from regular, but I didn't know how to cook them. I used 1/2 the butter, and 1/2 the milk, (figuring I could add more if necessary) but I didn't need it. The nutmeg and cloves another user suggested were divine. Thanks so much for posting this easy, easy, delicious recipe!

I gave this five stars but I also changed quite a lot of things about it. So many things that it was almost a different recipe. I first sauteed in butter a few shallots (about 3/4 cups roughly chopped) and one peeled and chopped green apple. I added pepper and nutmeg to this. I followed the rest of the recipe separately and I stuck to almost exactly (although I did use a little less maple syrup) and I roughly mashed the potatoes so they would still be a little chunky. Then I mixed in my apple and shallot mixture. Because the shallots are much more mild than onions, it compliments the sweetness of the syrup perfectly. I paired it with smoked porkchops (topped with the same apple/shallot mixture - with some brown sugar added - which comes out like a warm chutney). It was an excellent meal and my roommates still talk about it even though I made it months ago.

Used only a bit of syrup to taste. These were not too sweet which was a good change. It's a keeper.

I took the advice of another reviewer and used 1/4c brown sugar and 1/2c honey because I had no maple syrup.  I didn't have to add any milk, it was already liquidy enough.  It turned out well and was really easy with the mixer doing the mashing.  Turned out a bit sweet, I'd say you only really need 1/2 that amount of maple syrup, but it was very tasty.

I made these for Thanksgiving and they were a big hit.  I did make a few adjustments...  I used half the butter called for in the recipe (didn't miss it!)  I also used just a little bit of maple syrup (to taste) and added some cinnamon.  They were yummy!

Pretty good! My husband loves sweet potatoes, so I'm always looking for new ways to prepare them. I used my stand mixer to mash them and omitted the milk. I always add vanilla to my sweet potato recipes, about a teaspoon here. Used a couple teaspoons of brown sugar but forgot the cinnamon. Husband gave them thumbs up!

Too sweet. This tasted more like a pie filling than a side dish. Will maybe try making it once more with about a tablespoon of maple syrup.

This came out fantastic, so easy. Instead of using a blender, I used my hand masher (keeps the consistency thicker, not too smooth like some of the previous reviews). I only used 1/4 cup butter, added the maple syrup and milk a little at a time until the consistency was perfect and so was the taste. The recommendation for cinnamon was the perfect touch. There were a lot of "Mmm mmm's" at our table tonight and seconds all around.

These were an excellent addition to Christmas dinner.  Next time I'll use a little less milk to help it maintain a thicker consistency. Otherwise, it was great!

This was great!  I cut back on the maple syrup once I realized it was getting soupy - the kids loved it.  The only problem I had was serving it with cinnamon squash at Thanksgiving dinner - people thought it was squash and the squash was sweet potatoes.  :)

This was the perfect solution to over-boiled sweet potatoes!  I didn't add milk and less butter and maple syrup, so it makes a pretty healthy side dish that tastes GREAT!

I just made this for thanksgiving. Instead of maple syrup I used 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup honey (we don’t eat maple syrup so I didn’t have it in the house) Overall I thought it tasted great but I Iike the taste of honey. However, if you don’t like sweet things I would say skip the maple syrup or any substitutions like what I did. I would recommend to just use the milk and instead butter and maybe a bit of brown sugar in the sweet potatoes.

For the top I added crushed pecans, brown sugar, and crushed gram crackers and mixed them together with 2 tbs butter. I didn’t measure how much I used I just eyeballed it. Left a really nice crunch to the top. Baked it at 350 for 25 minutes. 

Some of my family members didn’t like the sweetness so next year I am going to try this again with just butter in the sweet potato mix with the toppings I used this year.

Made no changes in the recipe.  My granddaughter asked me if I would make them for her and she promised she would try them.  I only made 3 potatoes, but, she loved them.  They will be on my Thanksgiving table every year from now on!

This turned out really good but next time I'll use a hand masher instead of a mixer.  Using a mixer makes it whipped even on low setting.  I also used 1/2 cup of maple syrup and that was the perfect amount of sweetness.

Just made this tonight, and after reading several reviews, I reduced the amount of syrup, butter and milk.  I went with three large potatoes, peeled and cubed, it was probably about 7 -8 cups.  You can always add ingredients to taste.  The simplicity of this recipe favors weekday meals, but it’s something to serve guests as well.  A keeper.

Overall, good sweet mashed potatoes. Slowly added in maple syrup and amount called for would have been too sweet for our taste. Also, just used a spoon to mash them as the potatoes were soft enough. Would make this again, but with minor changes. Thanks for the recipe!

These are easy yummy smashed sweet potatoes.  Sometimes it is good to just let the natural flavors express themselves instead of lots of sugar and nuts.

I left out the milk, used honey for the sweetener, and added a teaspoon of salt, as it was just too sweet on first taste. 

A quibble from a new mashed potato person: the recipe didn't specify draining the potatoes, so I left the water in it (it was a small pot, so there wasn't that much water, I didn't think...), as I know that's where most of the nutrients go. 

It was very watery, and needed some corn starch and further simmering at a low heat for a couple hours before it was even close to what I'd call mashed potatoes.

Easy to make and delicious! I used 4 large sweet potatoes, 1/2 cup of maple syrup, maybe a little less than a 1/3 of butter and added cinnamon. I was able to mash with a fork them used a rubber spatula to fluff it up. When using the spatula I added around a teaspoon of milk.

SO delicious!! I'm always tempted to add something else (garlic / onion powders, brown sugar), but I didn't.  It's actually good that you can just enjoy the taste of the sweet potatoes. Perfect as is; only needs a little salt and pepper. Thanks for the great recipe for healthy sweet potatoes!

These were very good. I cut back (2 Tablespoons butter & 1/2 Tablespoon maple syrup) on the butter and maple syrup to make a half batch of the recipe. Glad I did because it was the perfect amount of sweetness with a hint of maple. I also added a dash of cinnamon. Delicious! Will definitely make this again.

Thank you so much for this recipe! I hadn't ever made mashed sweet potatoes before. I used 4 good size sweet potatoes, 1/4 c brown sugar, 1/4 c butter and 1/2 c milk.  I sprinkled a little brown sugar and cinnamon on top when done.

I liked the recipe because of its simplicity.   I did modify it because I didn’t want to use syrup and I wanted pecans.   MODIFICATIONS:  after boiling and draining sweet potatoes, I put them in an oven safe pie glass dish, hand mashed, added the buttter, brown sugar (start with  half of a 1/4 cup and continue to add based on how sweet you want them), added milk and mashed it and mixed it altogether in the glass pie baking dish.    When I was happy with the flavor, I smoothed the top so it looked ‘pretty’.   Then I added whole pecans for decoration and then crumbled fresh pecans and sprinkled them on top.  Then I drizzled honey over the pecans and baked for approximately 20-30 minutes.  I will try to add a picture - not only was it incredibly delicious (even my sweet potatoes ‘haters’ devoured it!) It  so easy to make!

We are not really fan of really sweet stuff so we used much less maple syrup but otherwise it was great! Will do it again

Spook good. I used no milk. Half   the butter and sugar. Only because I wanted it to be a little healthier. Will be doing a lot of these. YUM!

My sweet potato loving wife, loved this. It was necessary to cut way back on butter, milk, and syrup because there is only two of us. Definitely recommend adding them in small increments to make sure the potatoes are not too soupy.

If you want to go with a less sweet variant, use light agave syrup. It goes really well with this dish!

Sorry to say I wasn't a big fan. I love sweet potatoes alot of ways but mashed is not one of them.  Reminded me too much of baby food. Just my opinion.

This was a delicious accompaniment to my beef filet roast Christmas Eve.  I micro waved the potatoes and just scooped out the flesh.  I used much less syrup, about a 1/3 cup or so.  Thanks for a simple and seasonal side recipe!

I didn't like it that much. I used a half bottle of pure maple syrup...I started with only a 1/4 cup . It taste so bland I poured more. I used 1 stick of butter and 3/4 cup of milk . I followed the recipe as it called for. It didn't have much flavor. 

I originally tried sweet mash at Appleby's restaurant  near me and fell in love with it. It lead me to trying to make it at home. The Appleby's version is really , really sweet. This means it's probably not good for me. Anything really good usually isn't healthy. 

I'll try this again, but with a different ingredients. I'll play with it until I love it.

This was great! I threw just a touch of brown sugar in too and there was enough liquid I barely used any milk. They were light and fluffy. Great maple taste.

Rating is on the ingredients...not the amounts.  Cubed 4 medium size sweet potatoes relatively small.  Simmered right at 20 minutes.  Mashed with potato masher.  Added 4 tbsp butter and maybe 1/4 cup maple syrup.  Added about 1/4 cup milk.  Whipped mixture with electric mixer, adding more milk a little at a time until the consistency of mashed potatoes,

Loved it...a great piece of advice in making any kind of mashed potato...drain the potatoes in a colander, return the the stove in the pot and over a very low flame, hand mash to release all the steam and extra moisture which can cause potatoes to get watery when you start to prep them. When it comes to adding butter, syrup and milk, do it GRADUALLY since you want to have a consistency that isn't soup!

I like the natural sweetness of the sweet potatoes so I didn't bother to add the maple syrup and it tastes yummy

I have never peeled a sweet potato to make mashed.  So much wasted time and effort.   Cook the whole, unpeeled potatoes in water until fork tender;  move to a cooling rack and when cool the skins slip off.  There you have your potatoes ready for mashing!  (and the skins with a little butter are delicious also)

Good basic idea for sweet potatoes.   Of course, none of the proportions are that important.  Make it as sweet or as savory as you want.

Exactly what I was looking for. I didn't add milk, as I am lactose intolerant and try to stay away from that. It was fine without. Just added maple syrup for mine and butter also on my boyfriends. I will be making this again. Thank you.

Will make it again. I did cut the amount of maple syrup by like 1/2. My toddler requires extra calories and this recipe was perfect for him.  Separated into 3 containers to freeze for later. In one, I added a tiny bit of cardamom to it. On another, I added a tiny bit of cinnamon. I left the last one as is. One of his favorite ways to eat sweet potatoes.

Milk would make it too watery since the sweet potatoes were boiled. What's wrong with boiling the whole sweet potato and peeling it after it's done? Save one step of preparation. I used coconut oil and agave nectar to substitute butter and maple syrup. Added some nutmeg, cinnamon, and pinch of salt. I didn't measure any ingredient either. I"m going to use it for sweet potato pancake stuffing.

I tried this and love it with just a few changes.  Like another reviewer I added cloves and nutmeg (sorry I don't know how much I just sprinkled them across the top of the potatoes).  I used 4 HUGE sweet potatoes, probably 1/2 pound each and still I did not use all the maple syrup.  I used 1/4 cup maple syrup, 1/4 cup agave, 1/2 cup milk, 1/4 cup of butter, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and the cloves and nutmeg to taste. It tastes wonderful.  My husband thought it was too sweet still, but my 30-year old son and I loved it.  Will make for Thanksgiving with some chopped roasted pecans on top.

Granted I may only be 14, I made this recipe for my family's thanksgiving dinner and it won out over all the other dishes. Instead of store-bought syrup, I used my family's homemade maple syrup that I myself helped make. I also used farm fresh butter from my grandparent's dairy farm. Again, this is by far my favorite sweet potato recipe and will be made again soon.

I liked this dish. I did not add milk because my hubby is lactose intolerant. I boiled my sweet potatoes whole. It takes longer, but I think that chopping them before boiling cooks some of the natural flavor out of them. I boil, peel, mash, and heat. I also added about a tablespoon of cinnamon. I thought it was great with the garlic spinach recipe on this site. The contrast of flavors was awesome.

This has more sweet than needed.  I have started doing it by baking the potatoes rather than boiling them, then after scooping out the skins, mixing in a little blood orange infused olive oil I get from a local olive oil bar and maybe a tablespoon of agave nectar. No milk is needed, I find.  As one other reviewer commented you could put in some cinnamon, allspice or clove if you like.  But to our taste, the sweet potatoes really don't need all that much to be wholesome as well as awesome.

This dish was AMAZING! Though I did change a few things.  I boiled 1 full sized carrot and two peeled sweet potatoes for 45 minuets. Then I would mash them together with 2 Tbsp honey, 1.5 cup milk, 1 Tsp butter, and 1 Tbsp maple syrup. I would also add a crisp. The crisp is 1.5 cup almond, 2 Tbsp maple syrup, .5. Cup brown surgar. Add it to the top then bake for 15 minuets on 250!

I served these in cupcake tins at a pot luck.  Made the potatoes as directed then put them in cupcake tins and broiled to crust a little bit of brown sugar on the top (mostly for looks).  Very sweet, almost too sweet for me, but everyone at the party was VERY complimentary!

I am vegan so I replaced the milk with organic  coconut milk. I did a bit of agave and raw brown sugar with a touch of cinnamon minus the maple syrup. I added some toasted coconut as an edible garnish....great base recipe!

I have never been much of a sweet potato lover till recently and I really liked these potatoes.  My husband who does not even like sweet potatoes ate them all up, though he said they were not his favorite.  Coming from him, that is quite an accomplishment!

This is a great base recipe. As is, I figured it would be too sweet and too bland. So I added a little brown, white sugar, and honey. Also added cinnamon and nutmeg. We liked that it wasn't too sweet.

I chose to bake the potatoes at 325 for 90 minutes instead of boiling them, which I feel waters down both the potatoes and the flavor.  After 90 minutes, I just cut the potatoes in half and scooped out the inside...no peeling necessary. I used more brown sugar and less maple syrup because I know my wife isn't a huge maple syrup fan.  They were great!

Right now I'm giving it 3 stars. I haven't tried it out yet on the family. First time making it and it seems okay. I went with the brown sugar and honey bit (THEINGRAMS4 review) and added a little nutmeg. Twenty minutes was fine when slicing the tater in four chunks and I used 6 medium sized sweet potatoes and used a small hand whisk to whip them up.

This is a favorite for me when I cook pork chops. I add brown sugar to the mixture though and a dab or so of cinnamon. It makes it a bit more sweet which I personally like.

Yuuuuuummy! Did it like it said, and boy is it good! Very buttery, and the sweetness wasn't overpowering at all. (Though I do like my food very sweet, so I guess I'm biased.) Easy to make, and highly recommended.

This was delicious and so easy to make!  Both my husband and I aren't big into sweet potatoes, but we loved this recipe.  I only put in half of the maple syrup, and would put less butter in next time. We loved the buttery flavor, but I think it would be just as tasty (and healthier!) with a little less.

The mash went very well with seasoned crumbed pork fillets.  I didn't need to mix the sweet potatos after 20 minutes boiling, just mashed it really easy with a fork.  Everyone in the family loved it and my younger boy who normally takes ages to finish up his meal cleaned out his plate in under 20 minutes.  The moistness of the mash complemented the crispness of the crumbed pork fillets.

I did the 3 serving version of this and it was excellent.  I cut back on the butter and it was still awesome.  You'll be hooked.

This was a good idea to begin with, but I followed the recipe exactly and it was more like baby food than mashed potatoes. Less milk is probably the solution to this.

Too much maple syrup!! The sweetness overpowers the already delicious natural sweetness of the veggie.  If you scale the maple syrup down, this is a great, fast, and easy recipe!

AWESOME!  Super easy to make and delicious!  It's easier to peel the potatoes after boiling, the skin just slides right off.  Veganized it by using soy milk and earth balance "butter."  Nom nom!

I made this recipe today because I couldn't find my favorite Mashed Sweet Potato recipe after cooking them on Thanksgiving, and I have to say that I'm glad I lost it!  This recipe is much simpler and a lot less sweet, which is good for me since I am diabetic.  I'm the only one in the house that eats them so I cut the recipe to only 2 servings and it still turned out wonderful.  I also made some homemade marshmallow for the topping and it turned out perfectly.  With this recipe, Mashed Sweet Potatoes will definitely be appearing more regularly on my dinner plate!  Thanks for sharing!

I love sweet potatoes because they are healthier for you than regular potatoes.  I don't use the butter but i did add a little splenda brown sugar and they are plenty sweet enough!

Very easy and delicious.  The maple flavor is subtle but adds something different.  We used heavy cream rather than milk.

My husband is not a huge fan of sweet potatoes, but loved this the first time I made it, almost 4 years ago.  We have come back to it for an occasional treat ever since.  It is definitely worth it (not to mention healthier) to use real maple syrup, not the fake kind!

Pretty good. I think next time I would add less milk, they came out a little too runny for me. The taste was great, though. I would make again and maybe add some pecans.

Very good, though I thought they could be just a little bit sweeter (& I used pure maple syrup).  I made in advance, then chopped up some spiced mixed nuts & sprinkled on top, then threw it in the oven with my pork chops...DH loved them!

I personally like these very much and I don't really care for sweet potatoes, but my husband who loves them did not like this, nor my two kids.  Go figure.

Blech! Came out like baby food and very bland. Maybe I did something wrong but I won't be making this again.

Perfect!  That's all I can say.  This was perfect in every way.  Taste, consistency, and ability to fill my tummy!

Whole family liked it. Used real Michigan maple syrup and whipping cream instead of milk.  Didn't have the trouble with the boiling time as another reviewer did.  Served with jerk chicken and fresh gold pineapple.  Will make again.  Thanks!!

I didn't use any milk, and it was still good.  Not very exciting, but tasty nonetheless.
