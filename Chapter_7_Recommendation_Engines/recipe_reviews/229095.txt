I sauteed the onion and a little fresh minced garlic in the butter before adding it to the chicken mixture. I sprayed the baking dish with non-stick spray instead. I added one small package of frozen peas and carrots, doubled the milk and added some fresh ground pepper. Instead of sprinkling the cheese on top, I just added it with the rest of the cheese in the casserole ingredients and brushed the tops of the biscuits with melted garlic butter. This was inhaled by my family, we all really liked it. This was enough for one dinner (paired with a huge vegetable platter with homemade low calorie ranch dip) and one lunch for tomorrow.

I thought this was a good base, less about half the onions. I also think it would be great if some peas and carrots were added, I am going to try that next time. I think with a little tweaking this could be a five star recipe!

I had some leftover baked chicken and crescent roll dough so I tried this recipe.  It was good and my husband ate two servings.  However, with the cheese on top, the roll dough did not get done.  I also think this needed some veggies added so I threw in some frozen peas.  Carrots would also be good.  I'll probably make it again with a few tweaks.

Melanie's Chicken Biscuit Casserole Haiku: "No raw onion, please! Saute it first with garlic! (Peas & carrots too!) Spot-on reviews b4 me knew this would be better w/ sautéing the onion w/ garlic in a little butter first, as well as how a chicken/biscuit combo just sings out for a pea and carrot partner, so I did just those 2 things. I ended up mixing about 3/4 c. cheese into the casserole mixture, rather than sprinkling any on top of the raw biscuits. These came out pretty tasty and not time-consuming to put together, if you have either a rotisserie chicken to yank apart, or some leftover shredded chicken already on hand. I'd make again, for sure.

I baked chicken breast in a little white wine and poultry seasoning to provide more flavor. I also mixed cheese into chicken mixture rather than sprinkling on top. Quick and easy, tasty, dinner.

If I'd sautéed the onions first, and added in any other vegetables - peas, carrots, corn, broccoli, heck, even celery - this would have been pretty good. We really liked the biscuits on top. But won't make again.

The flavor was good but most of the sauce was absorbed by the biscuits.
