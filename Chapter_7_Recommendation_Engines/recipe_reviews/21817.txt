This was fantastic! This was my first fondue with my brand new fondue set and I was amazed at the ease (if you have an all in one fondue pot) and the taste was amazing!  I had to improvise with red pepper flakes and not canned ones, but it was still terrific!  I will make many, many times in the future!

This was so tastey! Everyone LOVED it.  It is very quick and easy.  A first time chef or nervous hostess would find it to be a snap.  I have been looking for a cheese fondue recipie witht he right texture, and this did the trick.  I resisted choosing this recipie, since I hate to use the processed cheese, but for texture and ease it just can't be beat!

This was an incredibly easy dish to prepare. I took it to a family holiday gathering and it went over very well. I served with crackers and bread triangles and there were no complaints. Definitely use fresh crab if able - it makes a difference.

This recipe was good, but too runny (I didn't drain the artichokes first, which is a must), but overall pretty good

I was really suprised at how well this recipe turned out.  I am normally not a big fan of American Cheese in anything - but this recipe was excellent.  I used the shredded American/Cheddar mixture already packaged together at the grocery store.  I also used fresh red pepper diced.  It was fabulous.  I served with Bruscetta toast and fresh bread.

This was very good.  I served it with several kinds of bread and veggies. It did end up at one point getting a little chunky so I just added a little bit more american cheese and it smoothed it right out.  Family and friends enjoyed it much more than one I made before that had wine in it.

For a basic fondue this was great.  I thinned it out a bit before adding it to the fondue pot and it kept the creamy texture really well.  Next time I will probably add a few ingredients to spice it up a bit.  I really liked the artichokes and peppers in it.

This fondue was very easy to make and I was able to use a small crock pot rather than a fondue pot-which was very nice. My guests loved the roasted pepper and artichoke combination, but I would suggest using more cheddar and less processed cheese. It was almost too salty and standard tasting. I think this recipe would be great for a tailgate or casual event.

This was a success for my first fondue ever.  The texture came out perfect.  Everyone enjoyed it.  I served it with apples, bread, carrots, mushrooms, broccoli, and cauliflower.  The apples were everyone's favorite.  It was missing something.  I couldn't pinpoint it.  It was a little plain tasting.
