I had a bunch of strawberries to use up and this recipe was the perfect way to use them.  I managed to fit it all into one big loaf pan and cooked it ten minutes longer. Came out perfect! Super yummy!

Overall, a moist tasty pound cake that always gets positive comments when I make it for a birthday cake. The recipe calls for loaf pans, but I have never made it that way. I have used it twice now for a 4-tiered round cake (I use a pound cake when making a fondant-covered cake as a sturdier cake is required for stability). One batch makes 2 x 6” cakes; bake for 40 min. I haven’t tested it for other pan sizes. For high altitude and personal preference, I make the following adjustments to recipe:
•	Omit ground almonds
•	Add ½ tsp baking powder
•	Sub buttermilk for milk
•	Chop strawberries rather than quarter
•	Add 4 drops red food coloring

I made this pound cake last night and thought it was excellent.  I'm not sure why some reviewers thought it was too sweet - I thought it was just the right amount of sweetness.  I forgot to buy the almonds so I left that ingredient out and jut put in a little more strawberry, but I didn't feel like it was missing anything.  Like the other reviewers said, there is no reason why you can't fit all this in one loaf pan.  It took about 10 extra minutes for it to cook that way.  Overall this recipe was very easy, and I would certainly make this again.

My husband LOVED this!!!  I used 2-1/2 C chopped strawberries, 1 teaspoon each of vanilla, almond and strawberry extracts, and omitted the almonds and water (with all that fruit, no more liquid was required).  This is a delight!  As a matter of fact, I’m making another batch using blueberries (I’ll omit the strawberry extract this time) as soon as I finish this review.  Thanks for a great recipe!.

This cake was easy to make and tasted so good. The only thing I didn't have in the recipe was the ground almonds. I made it in a budnt cake pan and baked it for the time recommended. Turned out great!

It was amazing! I added 1 1/2 cups of strawberries instead of just 1 cup, and it worked out just right! I couldn't find my vanilla extract, so I substituted maple syrup, and in my opinion, it made it taste even better than it would've. I decided not to use almonds because my family isn't big on nuts, but it still tasted fine without them. It's an extremely easy recipe, so I had my younger siblings "help" me out, and they had a lot of fun. Can't wait to try more recipes!

I used sliced almonds (about a handful) and nearly doubled the strawberries. I used all milk instead of part water. Delicious! Defiantly will be making again!

I made this cake myself, as some had mentioned it's on the sweet side so I erred on the side of caution and just did one cup of sugar instead with an extra half cup of strawberries, still on the sugary side for me. If your berries are really ripe, you may want to hold back on the sugar a little more.  

It's a simple recipe, very easy to follow and it all fits into one pan. My loaf pan was occupied so I used a cake pan and it baked faster.  Oh yes, I also used unbleached flour.

So my daughter and I made this cake. It was awesome, except WAY too sweet. We doubled the amount of strawberries, because we're rebels that way, but next time we plan on cutting the sugar in half. Aside from the overpowering sweetness, it was moist, dense, and oh so good. With a few adjustments it will definitely be a keeper.

All batter could be placed into one loaf pan. Too sweet and not very flavorful.

Added 1/2 Tspn  baking powder

Did not add nuts.

I really liked this recipe. Changes....I used half whole wheat flour, only 1 c. sugar, 2 c. strawbrys, 2 c. rhubarb in a 8X8 glass dish, topped with cream cheese frosting. Very dense, very tastey. MMMMMM!

I doubled the recipe. Made it with half the sugar, crushed almonds, and put doubled mixture in 2 loaf pans. I think I would make it again but I would follow original recipe exact except add a little more strawberries and almonds.

This recipe is delicious!!! I didn't have two eggs, so I just added a bit more milk, soooooo good. I also added a touch more strawberries. I love that it is super sweet and has a shortbread taste to it. Would definately make this one again!!!

I found this recipe delicious as did the guests I had over who tried it.  I used a tablespoon instead of a teaspoon of ground almonds just because I love the flavor, but the strawberries made a delightful change to pound cake (which I love anyway!)

This has great flavor but their is no salt, baking soda or baking powder for levening. Kind of odd not to have one of those.

Tastes great. If you like the “sad streak” in regular pound cakes (which I do), you’ll love this. It doesn’t have any leavening ingredient so it makes a very short cake. (Doesn’t rise).  You could use 1 pan. We just made a simple glaze and stacked the two loaves and made a layer cake. It really is good though.

This tasted good,but the texture of the pound cake came out too soggy for me. I had to place it in the freezer to firm it up and  I followed the directions to a 'T' ,but in order to make this gluten free, ( I have an allergy to wheat),I used almond flour. Next time,I won't add the water or add 1/2 teaspoon of Xanthan gum powder to thicken the batter. I made lemon glaze to go on top that was tangy and sweet. This is a good way to use not as fresh strawberries from the fridge that aren't great to eat themselves,but bake up nice and in a pound cake such as this.

The taste was delicious. It made one large and a small loaf pan. The small one cook just fine. However the large one never really completely cooked. I took it out at about 65 min because the top was getting too brown.   So I put a powder sugar glaze on it and everyone loved it. Will definitely make it again using smaller pans.

I subbed buttermilk for the plain milk, and used enough to replace the water as well. Omitted the ground almonds, too, but otherwise followed all directions/amounts. The taste is great (I didn’t find it too sweet), but it is SO dense and has an odd gummy texture. This is way beyond regular poundcake density - if I had bought this from a bakery I’d want my money back. I’m sorry, I don’t like writing bad reviews.

Tell me how you get a pound cake using All Purpose flour.  I made this and the taste was great except the cake was about 3" thick.  No baking powder or soda. I don't see how anyone can have success.

I liked this recipe. I must admit that I  used a bit less sugar (1 1/3 c.) given that people were saying it was too sweet. Before reducing the sugar, I tasted my strawberries which were a bit bland. My recommendation is to determine how much sugar you will use depending on the sweetness of the strawberries. I then proceeded as the recipe said. My personal touch was adding 1/2 tsp. of almond extract and 1/2 tsp. of baking powder (as someone suggested for high altitude). I also added the baking powder as I feared my batter wouldn't raise enough. The outcome was a moist and fruity cake. Very tasty and not extremely sweet. I baked it in a couple of different molds and it yielded the following: 12 mini cupcakes, 6 regular cupcakes, and 6 mini bundt size cakes. This recipe could easily make 12 to 15 cupcakes or one loaf pan. If you go the route of cupcake and mini bundt sizes only bake them for about 30 minutes and add 5 extra minutes if you notice they need to brown a bit on the top. I will definitely make this recipe again!

Sounds really good... My star rating is based on that...
I would like to know if this can be made without the ground almonds, due to but allergy.

Excellent and so yummy!  I used 2 cups of thawed berries and reduced sugar and forgot the water (s/h used a bit). Served it with sauce made from the strawberry juice.
For a birthday cake and all enjoyed.

Wonderful!
This seems more like a loaf of bread than a cake but that could be the loaf pans throwing me off.

The batter seemed fine until I added the 1/4 cup of water at the end.  Afterwards, no matter how long I baked it (covered it with foil, an extra 10 minutes at a time) it just would not set.  Ended up throwing it out because the middle did not seem cooked through.   Anyone else have this problem?  I may try it again without the water.   I hate wasting ingredients.
