This was absolutely DELICIOUS!!!  I love that I didnt have to follow the recipe exactly but it still turned out great.  I hosted a party Saturday where I served this crusty garlic bread with herbed dipping oil.  Well, I had a lot of bread left over, as well as oil that had been sitting with the herbs in it.  So I substituted the bread and olive oil in this recipe for the bread and olive oil that I had.  I used a combination of sharp white chedder and colby jack cheeses.  I also just used 2% milk.  I didn't have cream, so I just used what I had.  I also used dried rosemary because I didn't have fresh rosemary.  I added bacon pieces just to give it a little meat.  Despite all my substitutions, the dish came out really well.  I will definitely be making this one again!

I will probably try it with 1-2 fewer eggs next time, as the consistency was closer to quiche than bread pudding.  The flavor was excellent, though, and it will be fun to experiment with different breads and cheeses!

Super.  I used whole milk instead of the more fattening stuff.  I also added kale and butternut squash (sauted before hand) and it was simply yummy.

Awesome.  Everyone's right, this could work with any bread and cheese. I used some 1.5 week old garlic-seasoned bread leftover from a party, and 2 cups of shredded Mexican blend cheeses. I omitted the onion since my guests aren't real fans of onions (I know, what?), and added in a 10 oz. package of frozen spinach (first tried to add it into the pan with the oil and rosemary, but I didn't thaw it ahead of time, so I ended up removing the spinach block and heating it in the microwave, then adding it to the bowl of bread cubes, olive oil, and rosemary). I also just used 2 cups of 1% milk, since that's what I had, and used all 6 eggs.  I loved the consistency, though I'm not familiar enough with either quiche or custard to say what it's more like.  It was definitely a substantial meal component, accompanied by Crispy Rosemary Chicken and Fries (without the fries) recipe here by Sandy Witek -- awesome.  Next time, I'll try to add in some mushrooms to see if this can be a complete meal in one dish!

Made this as 4 servings in a smaller dish, 30 minutes was perfect.  I had a sourdough baguette and some herbed goat cheese and it turned out gorgeous.  Such a great idea!  Thank you!

I loved this dish. My husband wasn't quite as crazy about it, but I suspect it was because I used it as a side dish and it seemed out of context with the pairing.  I would definitely make it again - it would be great for a brunch.  The flavors were great.

This recipe is very good indeed! A great way to use up leftover loaves of bread. I made it with whole wheat sandwich bread and a mix of mozzarella and parmesan cheeses. I also used a mix of fresh parsley,basil and oregano. It came out very good and crouton like as the submitter said.

A great non-traditional accompaniment to a dinner party.  I liked that I could put it together and then forget about it for the next hour while I worked on other things.

I love to serve this as a side dish for an Italian dinner. This wonderful recipe is great just as it is but I do add some things at different times. Add halved cherry tomatoes and toss with the bread. Really tastes good and looks beautiful. I have also added browned bulk sausage or chopped up bacon and serving as a savory breakfast dish. This is really good - and add whatever you have that you like to eat and that cooks well!

I found this very good with rustic bread.  I had made it 3 days prior, so it was stale, and it absorbed all the liquid correctly - was moist but not custard in the center.  It needed all two cups of milk/cream.  I added a half pound of finely sliced Black Forest ham and no seasoning.  I carmelized the onions instead of clarifying them, for added sweetness.  The white cheddar I used provided all the necessary salt, along with the ham.  The ham also helped balance the fresh rosemary.  I also added 6 toes of garlic, roasted.

Delicious. Granted, I used this recipe more as a general guide than hard-coded instructions; it turned out great, and I love the fact that this can be used loosely with leftovers. I had the better part of a rosemary potato loaf left over and used that along with some herbed cheese that had gone untouched for quite some time. I will definitely make this again!

We loved this! I used pre-sliced garlic and cheese baguette, which made it quick to break up for this. I used parmesan and cheddar and served it with smoked pork chops. Delicious!

The beauty of this recipe is the ability to customize it. I sautéed some apple chicken sausage with Onion and the rosemary. I also added about a half cup of mixed organic greens.  Did not have quite 4 cups of bread cubes but that was OK. Use one cup of half-and-half and one cup of condensed milk. Pretty in just a touch of Penzeys Arizona spice blend. It was amazing!

I only used 3 eggs and 1 cup 1/2 & 1/2. I used a cup of Gruyere cheese. The bread was left over from a dinner we had out last night. It was 1 cup torn up sour dough.  I topped with Parmesan cheese. Delicious with some tomato soup!

Really liked it.  I made it with day old onion challah bread, sweet Maui onion, dried rosemary and some Brie that was getting hard.  The challah puts it over the top.  It will get 5 stars from me when I make it next time because I am going to up the amount of dried rosemary.   So YES, I will make it again...and again. I'll use sweet pork sausage and sage one time as well.  Yum.

I made it for my husband. He said it tasted "strange." He could NOT define "strange."  I told him that the only unusual ingredient was the rosemary, which I plucked from my plant and smashed it into the concoction.  Didn't matter. Opposition reigned.  I gave this recipe 2 stars for my husband and 4 stars for myself, making a combined score of 3.  :(

Just what I was looking for to make use of a leftover loaf of rosemary sourdough.  I used half & half for both cups of dair and added bacon (used the bacon grease to saute the onions for a few minutes then added the bread chunks to that rather than using any olive oil, not the healthiest choice but very yummy!).  I also topped it with Trader Joe's Hollandaise and it was really delicious!  This is a great way to make use of leftover odds and ends.

This didn't work for me. Rosemary was overpowering. The consistency was great and the flavors besides the rosemary were excellent, but the rosemary just killed everything for me...
