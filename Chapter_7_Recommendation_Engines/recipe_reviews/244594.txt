Foolproof risotto that's a great base for experimentation. After following the recipe the first time to get a feel for the flavors, I added fresh basil, thyme, and pine nuts to it the second time around. The Tuscan broth brings a lot of different flavors to the recipe so there's no need to add much in the way of seasoning. NOTE: It's a myth that you must stir risotto non-stop. It can't be left unattended for long, but if you must do things while you prepare it (measure an ingredient, tend to another dish, etc.), you can.

I absolutely love this risotto. I was apprehensive at first, as I've never made a risotto before, but this was very simple and easy to make!! It takes a little while, but it's well worth it. It tasted wonderful, it wasn't too heavy, but had plenty of flavor. A new favorite of mine.

I do recommend using the 1/2 cup at a time method for adding the broth, it helped the risotto to cook very nicely and evenly. However, I would say that how much broth you use is more "season to taste". Using the entire carton of Swanson ended up being unnecessary, and I was left with about a fifth of the container. It turned out wonderfully, absolutely perfect in my opinion, so just be aware you don't necessarily have to use all of it!!

I haven't cooked in a while and decided to go with this recipe to start over. Very easy to prepare and the instructions allow for the rice to cook nicely and evenly while absorbing the flavor of the ingredients. If you can't serve it right away and it dries a  little, try adding some tomato juice from a tomato salad and it will make up for it amazingly.
My family absolutely loved it!

I followed this recipe except added extra onion and didn’t have the flavored broth so added Italian seasoning. Be careful not to over cook, I turned the burner off while waiting for the grill food finish and should’ve removed it from heat altogether. It was borderline mushy. I’m making it again tonight, very creamy, simple, few ingredients.

The recipe is pretty simple and straight forward. It was my first attempt at making risotto and I think it turned out well. I did not find the tuscan flavoured broth so I just used regular chicken broth, no extra spices. (I was serving it with steak and balsamic sautéed mushrooms so I figured I could afford not to.) 
I also made this with a metal pot and started getting some sticking to the bottom about halfway through the broth. I'll try a nonstick saucepan next time and see how it works out. 
I heated the broth to start but didn't clue in that I should probably have left it on a stove top constantly warming as that might have helped. I'll also try that next time around. 
My wife said she liked it so I guess it was a success. Thanks for sharing.

Made this recipe using turkey broth and Tuscany seasoning. Instead of parmesan I used cream cheese with chives. Small container found in store. I stirred for about 30 minutes using the method mentioned. Risotto came out creamy, delicious and full of flavor!

While this was tasty, it was a little TIME-intensive for me.  Note, it wasn't LABOR-intensive (there's nothing hard about stirring), but it did take a good 30 minutes of heating broth and stirring.  I couldn't find the Tuscan broth, so I added white pepper, pink salt, garlic, and some fresh basil to add some flavor.  Good stuff.

This was really good; however, despite my best effort and using an entire carton of broth, I found it still a tiny bit crunchy in spots. Risotto is tough and I think it just required a bit more patience. I also was unable to find the Tuscan broth so spiced it up a bit with some basil, salt, pepper and extra parmesan. For its ease and for the great broth taste, I give it four stars. Will try it again!

Easy and delicious. I wasn't able to find the Tuscan broth at three different store, so I used regular and added the Tuscan broth flavors.. rosemary, sage, thyme. Lemon, onion and garlic.
