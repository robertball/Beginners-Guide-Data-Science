After adjusting the recipe to 1 1/4 cups dry mix and 1 cup milk- they turned out wonderful.  This then makes 3 equal batches per jar (recipe given makes 2 1/2)  Someone suggested cinnamon chips- they were great!  We are putting the mix in zip lock bags and then in Christmas cloth bags tied with rafia.  Thanks for everyones ideas and suggestions- they were quite helpful.

This is the first time I made pancakes from scratch!  They were great!! Per previous reviews, I also used 5 tsp of cinnamon (one of my favorite spices) and 1 cup of milk.  Turned out wonderfully! I can't wait to make these as gifts!

These are by far the best pancakes I've ever made!  These are the fluffiest, just so good!  I plan on giving them as gifts for Christmas in crafty jars.  I put 5 tsp. of cinnamon instead of 4.  You might want to use a full cup of milk as suggested.  If not, they may not cook as well due to the fact that they are so fluffy!  Make these up and your family will love you for it!

I didn't bother making this for a jar, I just went ahead and made a batch of this for the family this morning. I made the whole thing so I could have enough pancakes for a couple days. I had to play with the recipe a bit because it dosen't really come out right. The whole dry mix makes three cups of mix but the measurement of adding wet to dry asks for 1 1/3 cups of the dry which comes out to more than the recipe makes. I make pancakes a lot so I kind of knew what to use for the whole dry mix ingredients (two eggs, two cups buttermilk, 1/4 cup melted butter/vegetable oil, two teaspoons vanilla). I used a mixture of whole wheat flour and AP flour, buttermilk instead of regular milk and melted butter instead of vegetable oil. I served these pancakes with homemade maple-vanilla syrup. We LOVED them. There's just enough leftover for a small two-boy breakfast tomorrow (or a midnight snack for the husband, if he so chooses) which is good enough for me. I'll make this pancake recipe again, using my changes. NOTE: Remember that this pancake batter will be thick--so don't panic and think you've messed up your pancakes. It's supposed to look like that.

Prior to making these into gifts, I decided to test the recipe myself, and I'm glad I did.  As other reviewers mentioned, the batter was extremely thick.  I did however, try making a pancake before altering the original recipe to give the recipe the beneift of the doubt.  It wasn't to my liking so I added approximately 1/4 cup of additional milk to the remaining batter.  I made another pancake and decided to add a little vanilla, approximately 1/2 teaspoon.   As others have mentioned, limiting the dry ingredients to 1 /4 cup to 1 cup milk would probably be the appropriate ratios for pancake batter.  This would have been a 5* recipe if the dry/wet ratios were accurate.  Otherwise, great tasting pancake with maple syrup.  My 4 year old came into the kitchen and asked if we were having cinnamon rolls.  They smelled delicious while cooking.  One more note:  Why would you layer everything if you only use part of the mix to make batter?  You force your gift recipient to use it all or mix it up themselves and put the remaining back in the jar.  I am not layering this recipe and mixing it up before packaging it.  Sure, it is probably prettier by layering but just not practical with this recipe unless you plan to use the whole jar at once.

Very good, after modifications.  I used 3 tbl. sugar, 5 tsp. cinnamon and added dried apples.  I too used 1 c milk.  The first reviewer was correct, this recipe doesn't measure out correctly.  I added 1/2 c wheat flour the first time, and that made it 3 equal batches.  The second time, however, I added 1/2 cup dried apples instead.  When I measured it out, I got 3 batches, using 1 1/4 cup mix.  You don't need a full cup of milk doing it that way.  I'm selling these for Christmas this year.  Hopefully they'll go like "hot cakes"!

Hey everybody there were only 2 of you that caught the problem with this recipe. I knew when I first read it that it can't be layered and then only use 1+1/3 cup of mix unless you empty the mix out and mix up the dry ingredients first. You need a recipe that uses the whole jar at one time or don't layer when you give it as a gift. Sorry Carla good idea but not thought all out.

Not bad, good flavor, and I added more milk as everyone else did. I might give some away for Christmas.

A much thicker pancake than I'm used to cooking. I freaked out about the thickness of the batter and added an extra egg, as it looked more like cookie dough. It tastes good. I may make this one again.

Pretty simple to make, and they taste pretty good, although not outstanding. I made up a few jars for christmas gifts for teachers.

This recipe is awesome.  I would like to state that I'm not doing the gift jar idea but merely as a premix for myself.  I went with 5 tsp of cinnamon as others have suggested as well as 1 1/4 flour and 1 and 1/4 cup of milk (as I felt the batter was still too thick for my tastes.)  All in all, it came out great! I have it ready for another day.  I am quite happy with this recipe and will make it again.

This made a fabulous gift!!  Definitely use 1 1/4 cups of mix to make the batter - otherwise it'd be way too thick!  And make sure to mix all the dry ingredients together instead of layering them because it's impossible to scoop out mix before mixing it.  Great flavor and a wonderful gift.

Wow.  I mean serously ... wow.  I was *not* expecting much from recipe after reading reviews, but I'm SO glad I tried.  4* for taste (they are a tad bit on the heavy side), 5* for ease of prep.  Made exactly as directed - only change in preparing was going with the 1 cup milk to 1 1/4 cup mix (but didn't use it all - shy about an 1/8th of a cup).  One "batch" gave me 8 nice size pancakes which we devoured.  Thanks so much for recipe!

I made these as gifts and never tried them myself so I can't attest for their flavor.  The mix smelled delicious.  I ended up mixing all the ingredients together.  If you layer them, your recipient is forced to mix it all together themselves and refill the jar or make the entire batch at once.  (Otherwise all the cinnamon will be on top.)  I bought cinnamon maple syrup and apple cinnamon tea to compliment it in a gift basket.

oh my gosh, these turned out so fluffy and just perfect!!!  i used rice milk because of dairy allergies with one kiddo and found i had to add a bit more than what the recipe calls for but that just might be due to a different consistency.  i will definately make these again and again!!  however, my 4 year old prefers little thin pancakes...but i presume it's so she can taste her chocolate chips better that i always add in.  oh and i also did half whole wheat flour and added pecans.  super super good!!!!

A great recipe, but I did make the following changes after reading all reviews and making them myself.  When making up the jar ingredients, I put 1 cup flour first, 5 t cinnamon, 2 cups flour & then the rest.  This made a pretty cinnamon layer which made the jar more attractive.  To Make Batter I used entire jar (mixed thoroughly with a whisk) added 3-3/8 cups milk, 3 eggs, 3 t vanilla, 6 T vegetable oil.  The pancakes were perfect!  I made this for Christmas neighbor gifts.  I bought country snowman fabric with hearts to put on the top of the jar, added red raffia bow, heart pancake mold and directions to each jar.  I called them Christmas Morning Cinnamon Pancakes.  Adorable & Different!

This is an excellent idea!! Others have said that it wasn't pretty enough to put in jars, but I changed a couple of things to fix that.  I used the extra cinnamon that others suggested, but I also added cinnamon chips.  You could use chocolate chips too.  Make sure that you put these last into the jars, so that the flour doesn't cove them up.  You could also use brown sugar in place of the white sugar. Use some festive cloth scraps and some ribbon or rafia, and they make beautiful jar gifts. You do need to add extra milk to make it more of a pancake pouring consistancy. But these were very rich and fluffy.  Wonderful holiday morning treats.

I gave these as Christmas presents, and they were a BIG HIT!  Would also make a nice housewarming/wedding gift basket (add a skillet and turner, some Maple Syrup, etc.)  I added a tag with ingredients/directions, and a cookie cutter to pour the batter into to make shaped pancakes.

I loved this recipe.  My only criticism is that there's left-over dry ingredients if you follow the instructions with the intent of only making pancakes and not making a gift jar.  Otherwise it's great!

These were good.  Definitely fluffy!!  I'm planning on making them for Christmas Morning Gift Baskets for friends and neighbors so wanted to try them first.  I had to add more cinnamon and milk.  I served them to my family with cinnamon applesauce and scrambled eggs!  The whole batch made about a dozen normal sized pancakes.

Good but could use more sugar. I use half white flour and half whole wheat flour. I used unsweetened almond milk (didn't have normal milk) and applesauce instead of the oil. Like other reviewers did, I used 1 cup milk and 5 t cinnamon.

These were just wonderful.  I made two batches for breakfast and only two remain.  The family loved them!  I did adjust the mix to 1 1/4 and the milk to 1 cup as another reviewer suggested and the consistency was much better.  I also added cinnamon chips.  I plan on making these as Christmas gifts this year.

I was impressed with this recipe. If you are craving cinnamon rolls try these, they are really good. Light and fluffy and full of flavor.

I'm reviewing this 2 ways: for the jar and for the recipe. Jar: There is a lot of white to this one and I think in-a-jar recipes look better in layers. To do this I used 2 c. all purpose and 1 c. whole wheat. 1 c of all purpose went first, then 1c. of wh. wheat, I put the cinnamon around the edges of the jar only, which gave it a thicker layer. Then the baking powder, etc. directly on top of the cinnamon, also around the edges. That kept the cinnamon from spreading and being whispy-looking.  As for the recipe: It is pretty good, but it is very thick. Thicker than cake batter. I put an extra 1/4 c. of milk in at least. So make sure the person you are giving this to, knows what pancake batter is supposed to look like. Otherwise they will have muffins. Overall, this is a really good recipe. You won't got wrong! Oh, and we ate this with the Cinnamon Cream Syrup from this site (also as a part of our Christmas in a jar baskets) and it was delicious!

Haven't actually tried these myself but I made up a bunch of jars to go in my Christmas baskets.  As stated before me, if you plan on using this recipe at different sittings, you really can't layer it in the jar.  So I mixed it all up together and added chocolte chips to the mix, and now my family will each of their own Chocolate Chip Pancake mix for Christmas!  I sure hope it tastes good and not justs look pretty!!!

I've not made these pancakes but on principle, I wouldn't make pancakes with veggie oil as this doesn't usually yield the fluffy, easy to swallow results most want.

This was a nice idea and tasted pretty good, but the pancakes were thin and heavy rather than light and fluffy like with Bisquick.  May have to try an adaptation.  The flavor was great, though!

Very good. I did make some modifications as other suggested- more cinnamon, 1c milk per 1 1/4c mix. I also cut back on the baking powder to make them less dense. Much better that way. Have made them for my son without the sugar & really couldn't tell the difference.

This was a great creative gift idea!  I enjoyed making these for family this Christmas.  I did though discover that some things might be hard to fix, like the fact that if a person does not want to use the whole jar at once, if you do not mix it up before hand it would be hard to use.  In that case, I premixed all the major ingredients and at the very top put chopped dried apple pieces and attached a clear plastic bag with cinnamon chips.  I heard good things from the recipients who whipped these up!!

I am 7 weeks pregnant and crave pancakes every Sunday morning. This morning, my husband would not take me to get them, so I searched the internet for a recipe that I had all the fixin's for. This is a wonderfully easy recipe and can be made with the common things in your cupboards. My 2 year old loved them too! I hadn't planned on doing the jar gift thing when I first read the recipe, but now that I know how good they are, I just may do it for Christmas with some homemade maple syrup. These would be really good with a fruit syrup of some kind too. 

The only thing I did change was adding the extra milk, I sifted all the dry ingredients together and added some pure vanilla extract. 

Since I didn't make the whole jar recipe, I just halved the dry ingredients and kept the egg and oil the same, adding the extra 3/4 C milk.

I wanted to try these to see if I wanted to give them as gifts.  They are so good, they now have their own cannister on my counter!  Even the kids loved them. I did add 1 cup of milk like everyone else.  I highly recommend them for yourself or for a gift.

I liked this recipe and it was easy. I was going to use it as a Christmas gift this season. But I didn't find it's eye appeal in the jar that high. But as an overall recipe we enjoyed it and will make it again

These are the only pancakes my 2 y/o eats!  Extremely easy to make, but I use 1 cup of milk for a thinner batter. They come out light and fluffy and smell out of this world! Try it someday,you won't regret it!

I would have liked more cinnamon/spice flavor. I'm still experimenting with it - it's a good base. I used 1 1/4 c. mix with 1 c. milk as others recommended.

Overall easy and quite yummy! I made the dry mix and presented in a mason jar as a stocking stuffer for my boyfriend who loves breakfast. The recipe is quite thick; I tend to use a little extra milk than called for.

I often give my family "food in a jar" gifts for Christmas but like to change it up from year to year, so I thought this would be a great recipe. I always try the recipe before giving as a a gift, and I am glad I did with this. They were OK pancakes, but I did not find them to be light enough or sweet enough, although they did have a nice cinnamon taste. I am thinking that I might be able to adapt a different pancake recipe to put in a jar, though, so this is certainly a great idea!

This is the first time I've made pancakes from scratch.  They had a good taste and I followed the other reviewers advice about adding 1 cup milk and 1 1/4 cup batter.  Next time I think I will add a bit more cinnamon.  I will definitely make these again.

I'm giving these out as Christmas gifts this year, so I wanted to try out the mix myself.  I followed everyone's advice of adding 1 cup milk instead and they were wonderful!  I will also be mixing all the ingredients instead of layering, because most people won't make the entire jar at once.

I did not make this to give as a gift.  I just mixed all the dry ingredients together and placed in a Tupperware container to have on hand for busy mornings.  The pancakes were pretty good and had a nice cinnamon taste.  They were a bit on the dense side, though; we prefer a lighter, fluffier style pancake.

I made a mistake and tried to combine the whole amount of dry mix with the wet ingredients.  I had a lot of things going on while I was making these.  I didn't realize, until the batter looked like cookie batter, that the recipe said to combine 1 1/3 cups dry mix with the wet ingredients.  I added a lot of milk to try and thin it out.  It got sticky and was very thick.  It made thick pancakes.  The flavor was good though.  I'm giving it four stars because I think the liquid ingredients should correspond with the dry ingredients. I also added 1 teaspoon of vanilla and I think it added a lot more flavor than the pancakes would have had.

AWESOME! YUMMY! Everyone loved them! I made these for my family this morning. I think they are the best I've ever had. I also used one cup milk as suggested in past reveiws. I used gold medal Wondra Quick-Mixing all purpose flour (in box).  I like it because it is so fine. I would suggest sifting the dry ingredients so the baking powder gets mixed in well. These are awesome and would make a yummy gift with some real maple surup. Thanks for posting it.

This recipe was okay though I was disappointed after all the rave reviews.  The batter was too thick as noted in previous reviews so I followed the suggestion to add 1 - 1 1/4 cups of milk.  However, the pancakes weren't that fluffy and turned rubbery after the first few bites (when they'd begun to cool).  This recipe isn't awful but I'll keep looking for a really great pancake recipe.

These pancakes are delicious! Perfect amount of cinnamon. My 2 year old loooves them. This replaces our box pancake mix, way better from scratch.

I made this, I like it but I can't taste the cinnamon very much.  I really like cinnamon, so next time I will probably add more cinnamon to the mix, (or add some cinnamon to the syrup).  The first time I made it, I had mixed up some powdered milk and used the amount called for.  Since I was not using whole milk, the batter I thought was too thin, so the next time I used a bit less milk and it was better.
