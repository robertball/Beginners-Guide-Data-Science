First time baking with Splenda, they turned out great. Fooled my boyfriend who doesn't like "diet food". We loved them!

I used 1/3 cup sugar, whole wheat flour instead of white, and added 1 cup of oats.  They're a little dry, so next time I'll cut back on the flour; however, my family loved them.  The cherries and almond flavoring are a great mix.  Also, unlike traditional scones (which are great), I enjoyed being able to make and bake these at the same time.

I made them without the sugar and everyone raved about them.
