Yeah! This dish rocks. It is great fall weather food and goes even better with a good wheat beer. It was much sweeter than I expected so I hope I think to use a different brand of corn bread mix next time to tone the sweetness down some.

Another recipe my Mom made when I was little, but I didn't have the recipe...until now!  Thank you so much.  Now my kids love this too.  Instead of tomato paste, I use a packet of dry spaghetti sauce seasoning and some garlic powder.

I made this for dinner tonight with a few preemptive strikes against the over sweetness that other people mentioned.  In addition to the bell pepper and onion I minced fine 1 small habanero pepper.  I left out the tomato paste since I didn't have any on hand and didn't want to go out and purchase some.  I added 1 tsp each ground cumin, BBQ seasoning, and taco seasoning.  This made the dish both sweet and a little spicy.  It was really good with those additions.  And 1 small package of corn bread mix was just enough for a thin layer on top that cooked just right.  The cornbread was my favorite part.

wow, I have to say, I joined this yesterday, and I found the Bush's casserole, I tried it last night for dinner, it was delish!! My husband and daughter went crazy over it, it has a good flavor and cornbread tops it off!!

This was a really simple recipe and I enjoyed making it. Easy clean up, and everything came out perfectly. I loved it, my husband however was less than thrilled. He said it was too sweet, and after a couple more bites I noticed what he meant. Not sure how to off set the sweetness which came from the beans, maybe try a different brand than normal Bush's Baked Beans, maybe try the grillin beans or something. Either way, I probably wont make it more than once or twice a winter. 4 stars.

Fantastic. This was awesome. I used bar-b-que sauce instead of the tomato paste. I think next time I will just serve the corn bread separate, it got too done on top but was runny underneath.

Not a fan....the beans were way too overwhelming for the other taste.  I followed the recipe exactly and was bummed out when my family didn't care for it after reading all the other positive reviews.
