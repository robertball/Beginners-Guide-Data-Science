Very light and tasty. I didn't change anything.  Just added lime slices.

I thought I had imitation crabmeat in the freezer, but it turns out I had run out, so I substituted some Japanese fish cake sliced thin and halved.  I also eyeballed the ingredient amounts rather than measuring everything out.  It turned out delicious.  Next time I'll try it with jumbo lump crab meat!

Husband didn't care for it very much.  I didn't mind it, but it might have been because I added a variety of greenage.

This was a fast, tasty, healthy lunch. I made it with canned chicken of the sea pink salmon and it tasted very good and refreshing. I will make this again.

This salad is great for a light dinner on a summer night.  The only thing I added was red pepper flakes to give it a little "kick".  I would defiently make it again.

I made this today. I didn't have green onion, so added some onion powder to the dressing. I added half an avocado to it, chopped, to help make up for the fact that I didn't have enough imitation crab. My family liked it, and I now want to get more watercress and make this again. Makes a great side dish to a summer meal!
