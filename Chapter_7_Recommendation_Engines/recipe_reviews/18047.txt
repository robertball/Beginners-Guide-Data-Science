wow! i still can't get over the fact how a box of date quick bread was the base for such a tasty fruitcake! my candied fruit selection consisted of 8 oz. each: cherries, pineapple & a mixed variety. the fruitcake baked up perfectly in a 10" tube pan & was done in 85 minutes. thanks diane, i made your yummy recipe 5 days ago & we're still nibbling away.....

Quick, easy, and good!  I've never made fruitcake before because of the time involved with other recipes!  Next time I will dredge my raisins in flour first as they seemed to sink when it baked.  I made it in 2 loaf pans lined with parchment paper, and cut the baking time to about 50 minutes- worked great!

To me, this is a ringer for Claxton's brand! For the fruit I used 8 oz pineapple, 8 oz cherries and 8 oz classic mixed candied fruit. I also added walnuts. I split it between 4 prepared loaf pans and pressed down to fill the corners. Baked for about 50 min. Delightful!

I give this recipe 4 stars only because it gave me ideas.  I could not follow it as written, because I couldn't find the date bread mix - the stores were sold out due to the holiday.  What I ended up using was JIFFY Bran-Date Muffin Mix.  I followed the recipe for the Bran-n-date bread on the back of the box.  Using 3 boxes of mix,  6 eggs, 6 Tbs. brown sugar, 1 cup milk.  I added 1 cup of chopped candied cherries, 1 cup chopped dried pinepapple, 1/2 cup chopped dired appricots, 1 cup raisins and 1 cup chopped walnuts.  I only dredged the raisins in flour -- but next time I would do all of them (the fruit sinks).   I divided the dough into 3 small alluminum loaf pans and baked them for 50-55 minutes at 350.  They turned out great.  I would like to thry them the original way - but if I can't find the date bread I would make them again this way.  It's a much lighter fruitcake than the traditional one.  Much better too.....

Made this for Christmas and it was a big hit.  Couldn't find the date nut bread, and used some other kind. I soaked the nuts, and  dried fruit in rum, and replaced 1/2 the water with rum.  Wrapped it up tight in saran wrap, and foil.  Totally recommend.
