My husband absolutely loves this cake!  We took one of the reviewers suggestions on keeping it in the fridge and that makes it even better.  Thanks!

I loved the recipe with a few alterations.
instead of one cup of water i added a cup of buttermilk, to enhance the sourdough flavor and make it richer. adding half unsweetened chocolate and half chocolate instant jello powder made it stick together better and made it a little sweeter, both good things. all in all, a big hit

I made some changes to try to avoid a dry cake. I used a whole cup of shortening (trans fat-free) and added a half cup of half and half. There is surprisingly little liquid in the original recipe, which is probably why people found it dry. My changes did make it moist, but this cake has a very fine crumb which makes it fall apart easily. I think next time I will add some instant chocolate pudding to deepend the chocolate flavor and see if it helps the crumbs hold together.
The flavor was great and I frosted it with chocolate cream cheese frosting for Valentines Day. I will use this recipe again, but continue to tweek it until I get exactly what I want. A great start though, thanks Sally!

People complained of a dry cake and not enough chocolate flavor, so to remedy that I substitued canola oil for the shortening, used approximately a whole cup of baking cocoa, added a package of chocolate pudding, added 1-2 T (or more, not sure how much I put in) of instant coffee granuales to enhance the chocolate flavor.  Cake was EXCELLENT.  Was very moist and good chocolately flavor.

This is such good cake,the only thing it needed was 1/2 cup sour cream to make it moist and I also keep it in the fridge.

I didn't even know you could make cake with a sourdough starter until this recipe! This turned out good. I did follow others advice and added a small package of chocolate pudding. This was plenty chocolaty for us and did not see dry. I topped it with cream cheese frosting and that made it almost perfect! I will make this again. Thanks for sharing!

I make this using oil rather than shortening, to help retain moistness, increase the cocoa to 1 cup for a richer chocolate taste, and used milk rather than water, for taste. I add 1 tsp of instant coffee granules to really help the flavor develop further.   Due to the variance in sourdough starters, it is best to use the 1 3/4 cups of flour as a guideline; add the full amount if your starter is more liquid than solid, and less otherwise. You should aim for a batter that is like slightly thin pancake batter for this cake. I serve it to my family as is, but it is very tasty sprinkled with powdered sugar. It comes out very pretty if baked in a bundt pan, which takes approximately 50 minutes to bake.

Per other reviews, I used canola oil, decreased flour a tad, added more cocoa, used buttermilk in place of water.  This makes a nice tall cake... and the batter tastes tangy and amazing!

I worried about the other reviewers' comments about being dry, so I did the following:
*I used 1 FULL cup shortening (I used butter flavored Crisco)
*I added about 1/4+cup more water than called for
I cooked it in a bundt pan and topped with cream cheese frosting...wow!  I would send a photo, but it has already been polished off by my children.  Can't even tell that it is made with sourdough!  I will make this one again.  Especially pretty as a gift or for a luncheon...

I'm not a huge fan of chocolate cake, but this is delicious!!! It's hard to find sourdough recipes that actually taste not like sourdough, and this one gets two thumbs up from this family. I know people dislike when a recipe is changed and then rated, but we use honey instead of sugar. used 2/3 c honey in place of sugar. and only 4 TBS of cocoa powder. 2/3 c. softened butter instead of shortening. have used both milk or buttermilk in place of water. cooked 350 for 18-25 mins, check often and honey cooks faster than sugar. unlike other reviewers we did NOT find this cake dry (b/c honey I'm assuming
), completely opposite!! I call this a pudding cake as it's not dense at all but very very moist and wonderful!! Thankyou for the recipe.

I have made this cake a few times and have never had a problem with it being too dry.  It's not a very sweet chocolate cake so I feel that's probably where most people find the disappointment.  But I find it's best with some cream cheese icing drizzled over it (I use a Bundt pan for a pretty cake).  Even my young kids love this cake.

Mine turned out a bit spongy, not very fluffy. However, it tastes good and has a pleasant aftertaste.

This is a nice, basic chocolate cake. I think it needs something--icing, ice cream, whatever--on top to really make it. I followed another reviewer's suggestion and added 1/2 cup of plain yogurt (in lieu of their recommended sour cream) to the batter.

This is the best cake ever.... my husband requested it 6 months before his birthday to make sure I got the sourdough starter started in time! :)

To keep it from becoming too dry, be sure to not over bake it. I do 17 minutes on the middle rack and 17 minutes on the top rack of the oven, and then check it and only bake in 5 min increments on the top rack, if need be.

I top it with cream cheese frosting and store it in the refrigerator.

The cake turned out really good. I made some changes that were recommended to help keep the cake moist. I used a little bit more starter than the recipe calls for. I iced the cake with vanilla icing. It was not too sweet, moist and the sourdough gave a nice aftertaste.

Good cake- used 1 c. milk, 1 c. butter flavored crisco, and a package of pudding- to compensate for other reviewers saying it was too dry... the cake was tasty!  I used a dusting of  powdered sugar on top (I was in a hurry).. but after tasting I wish I would have made an icing.  This cake isn't very sweet and does need some extra sweetness on top....

For a couple of years a dear friend has offered her sourdough starter & been after me  to try making bread.  My bread making experience 30 years ago had traumatized me so, I had not tried since.  She finally convinced me and I'm having pretty good results so far.  Like a kid with a new toy, I'm researching sourdough and using it a lot of different ways.  I had started a cake recipe using 2 cups flour and 1 3/4 cup sugar combined but had misread the directions..add starter and let it rise for 2 to 3 hrs.  I didn't have 2 to 3 hrs. so looked up this recipe I had saved.  Having combined the 2 c. flour and sugar already, I calculated the servings to 21. 
I also subbed canola oil for shortening and buttermilk for water (per other reviews).  Used just enough warm water to dissolve a singles packet of Taster's Choice instant coffee to strengthen the chocolate taste (I like dark chocolate).
Wonderful texture and flavor!!!!  Wonderful without frosting or glaze!!  I'm sure this is a 5 star but since I made a few changes, will give 4.

was quite dry even though I added a little oil in since i'd read other people's reviews.  i'd probably try subbing milk in for the water and maybe halfing the butter and replacing the rest with oil

I did not care for this cake.  I used canola oil instead of shortening, added chocolate pudding, increased the cocoa powder, used buttermilk instead of water - all which were suggested by other reviews, but it still didn't have much flavor, in my opinion.  I probably won't make this recipe again.

From other comments, I adapted by using canola oil instead of solid shortening and replacing half the cocoa with  pudding.  Also made it in the bundt pan.  It made a moist, solid very tasty cake.  Did not get the sourdough tang, but it was still delicious.

I have taken another reviewers advice an added chocolate pudding and using canola oil for shortening.  It's baking now has about 5 minutes left on it.  It smells wonderful.  I also cheated and had a taste of the better, and it is GREAT!!!!  I will be icing with cream cheese icing.  Will let you know the final results.  Okay Have tasted the cake and I must say it is awesome!!!!!!  It was baked in a bundt pan.  I heated up the cream cheese icing and used maybe half the container icing the cake.  The icing gives it just enough more sweetness....  This I will make again and again and again.

I was not fond of this recipe at all.  I made this for my son's birthday (4 year old), and he would only eat a few bites before walking away, and he will eat just about anything.  My husband didn't like it either, and he loves chocolate cake.  The chocolate flavor was very minimal.  Not going to make this one again!

Great base recipe. I added 1/2 sour cream for moisture and chocolate chunks for extra crunch. It needs a little more sweetness, so I'd recommend icing it or adding some sugar to the recipe (or chocolate sauce and ice cream works too!).

One of the best scratch cakes I have made!  After reading some of the other reviews I was concerned about this turning out dry.  I wonder of the differences are with everyone's different starter.  Mine turned out very moist and rich.  I used 3/4 c of olive oil and added a generous scoop of sour cream.  I didn't have pudding, so didn't use it.  I also used closer to 1c of cocoa, substituted buttermilk for the water  and added the instant coffee others recommended.   Great cake will definitely make again.

Add apple puree/sauce!

So I pureed 1 green apple and used 1 1/4 c buttermilk, 1 cup shortening, and 3/4 c cocoa.
Bake just until knifes comes out moderately clean.
FABULOUS. WOA.

This was amazing!!! I used oil instead of shortening and added a small box of pudding. It was sooo moist and chocolatey! It didn't even need frosting! I left it covered on the counter since I had no room in the fridge and it stayed fresh & moist for a day & a half, until it my husband & 5 kids devoured it. I like to buy seasonal pudding flavors when they go on clearance. I used Mounds pudding and it was great! I am thinking of what flavors would go with chocolate for next time, or maybe just omit the cocoa and use a flavor like pumpkin spice pudding. I'll update when I try it!
*Update* Okay, it's official. This is an awesome versatile recipe! I just made it using the pumpkin spice pudding, adding 1tsp. cinnamon and 1/2tsp. allspice, with a hint (1/8tsp. each) of ginger & nutmeg. It tastes just like a moist decadent pumpkin cake! I didn't have anything to frost it with, but it surely didn't need it. My kids want me to make this for the family 4th of July get-together, using whipped cream to top. I can't wait to try other pudding flavors! If I could give this recipe more than 5 stars, I would! *Update* Pudding flavors tried...butterscotch-yum!...

This cake is moist, chewy yet has a crumbly texture that's hard to beat.  The starter I have is in a 1.5 l jar so I can only make this once/ week at most, which according to hubby, "just isn't enough!"  Definitely is a make again and again and again recipe!

I cut this recipe in half and baked in a 8 x 8 pan.  

Very very dry ... unlike the recipe I have used in the pass that also calls for sourdough & chocolate.

My husband didn't think this recipe had enough chocolate taste.

I will continue to use the recipe I have been relying on for years & years.

I made this as a sheet cake. Delish! It rose up beautifully. Very light and airy. It does have the slightly heavy(?) flavor that one would expect, and enjoy, from a sourdough recipe. Topped with a chocolate buttercream frosting it was fantastic.

I substituted Canola for shortening & Xylo for sugar, a little sanding sugar on top.  I made 6 giant cup cakes & 1 mini loaf.  I did reduce the cooking time to 30  minutes.  Came out super moist and not too sweet, delicious.

Excellent!   Rich and thick!  I made cupcakes (26 cupcakes, 20 minutes @ 350). Only change was substituted coffee for water.  Great use of sourdough starter!

I didn't have enough white sugar, so 1 cup of dark brown sugar was substituted along with 2/3 cup white. I used 2/3 cup salted cream butter for shortening. Cake turned out flavorful, moist and rose nicely in the glass baking dish. Next time I'll try some vegan exchanges on the dairy ingredients.

So I think I need to play and tweek this recipe a bit more and become a more seasoned expert at the sourdough starter. But....for the first recipe I've made and go at it, I was pleasantly pleased with it. Based on others reviews with it being dry and having to accommodate all recipes for allergies I made the following adjustments. Subbed the eggs with Egg Replacer, subbed some of the sugar with applesauce, added in a half cup of non dairy sour cream and cooked about 10 mins longer. Put a vanilla frosting on it and it was delicious. Might add in non-dairy chocolate chips next time and attempt an espresso frosting. Thanks for the share :)

quite a good, basic cake, which has a lot of possibilities and helps you use the extra sourdough starter you end up with when you are messing around with natural leavening and so on. I made it twice, once as described and yesterday with instant coffee powder instead of cocoa and the result is still good. You can also add apples, pears or any fruit, and chips of any kind.

This is something fun and different to do with sourdough.  After reading previous reviews about it being dry I did add a small box of instant chocolate pudding, a half bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips and baked in 2 loaf pans.  I didn't use any icing and it was wonderful!  It could make good muffins, too.  I'll make this again and again.  A good way to use up sourdough starter.
