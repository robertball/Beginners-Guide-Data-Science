I used white chocolate and cut the corn syrup to 1/2 c. since white chocolate is softer then regular or dark chocolate and it came out perfect!!! I used to make my daughters birthday cake and got sooo many compliments on it. I pinched off a few peices before rolling it out and used liquid food color to make other colors for decorating. This was really easy to work with, easier then fondant if you ask me and it tastes so much better too. It tasted like a white chocolate tootsie roll (my fav. candy). Yummy. This will be my new way of making covered cakes and decorations. Thank you so very much for posting!

Wow! This is a great recipe for a moldable chocolate. My friend and I made 30 white and regular chocolate roses and 60 assorted leaves to place on a full sheetcake for an anniversary party. Just let it set out a room temperature overnight, otherwise its too sticky to work with. We had to dust our hands only occasionally while working with it. We dusted our hands with a little cocoa powder for the dark chocolate ones, and a little vanilla protein powder for the white chocolate. Didn't think to try oiling our hands with a little vegetable oil! Thanks Emily B.

This is great!  I made about 85 white roses for my mom's 85th birthday.(I used confectioners sugar instead of cocoa mix---but vegetabale oil sounds like a good alternative too!).  They covered the top of my mom's birthday 4 tier chocolate birthday cake.

It was gorgeous.  A real show stopper.  Everyone wanted a picture!!!  I have 2 requests for this birthday cake for next year!

I've been experimenting with the plastic and used it to mold bowling pins and bowling balls for my 7 y.o. birthday cake; I made a school bus for the teachers when they started school this year.   It's a long time to learn how to manipulate the plastic chocolate but it is sooooooo worth  it!

I found this recipe really good for mouldable chocolate, however while I left it at room temperature, it's currently winter here and it got down to -9degrees celcius overnight.  When I got to it in the morning, it was too hard to do anything with.

I found putting it in the microwave for 30seconds helped.
The roses also looked a bit dull after I made them so microwaved them slightly which brought out a real shine.

This stuff is pretty awesome, I'm very pleased. I made a chocolate cake for my mother in laws birthday, and used this to make roses for the top. The roses themselves nearly made me pull my hair out, but I found that a tiny heart cookie cutter makes the perfect petal to wrap with. They were a hit, thanks!

I found this recipe very easy to make and very easy to work with.  I put the plastic wrap on a cookie sheet and then poured the chocolate on so that I could take it off the counter while it set, but I wish I had rolled it a little thinner.  It was probably almost a quarter inch thick, mostly because I was afraid it would tear if too thin.  I used a melon baller to cut circles and half circles to use as petals. 

The downside to this recipe is that the final product was not delicious.  In fact, I found it completely inedible. As my fiance put it, "It's as if you came across a tootsie roll from Halloween at Easter."

I would give this more stars if you had 'um!!  I've never worked with anything but icing for decorating a cake with, but thought this looked easy enough. Used white chocolate chips and the mixture separated a bit when poured onto the plastic wrap, but that didn't bother me a bit!  My daughter wanted a "big sub sandwich" instead of a cake for her 15th birthday, but made her a cake-sub.  I used the "Plastic chocolate" to make the pickles, lettuce and tomatoes... WONDERFUL!!!    TIP:  Instead of using oil or powdered anything to roll this out, I rolled it out between a silicone mat and a piece of parchment paper -NO STICKING!  Also, when it started to get a bit sticky from working with it, I wrapped it in plastic and popped it in the frig for a few minutes... Perfection!  :-)

LOVE this recipe. I tried a much fussier one from a cookbook and it was awful (grainy and gooey) but this is so simple and a nice consistancy. I found a few minutes in the fridge help if it gets too soft. This recipe made enough to cover a two layer 10" cake with leftover for a few roses. I'm using it in place of marzipan under the royal icing on a mint, chocolate cake for a bridal shower.

I used this to decorate a wedding cake and it was just what I needed.  Everyone raved about it.  It does not harden or dry out overnight but may over a longer time period.  I used Bernard Callebaut chips and it was delish although it was difficult to cut the cake

For the novice, like me, I found this challenging.  I'm sure I just don't know the tricks of the trade.  I didn't expect miracles, just cut-outs, but it was hard to roll out without it sticking (and I did use the cocoa). So, I wanted to say that it's hard for the novice, since the reviewers mostly rave about it.  I suspect they know a lot more than I do and I'm sure it's easier to work with than other recipes.  Just a heads up from a novice!

I think its a great base... again, like someone else had stated... white chocolate gets a little less corn syrup. 

I have noticed, at least with white chocolate (i did that one first to decorate a chocolate cheesecake with red roses) it can be a bit hard to work with if your hands are warm... so i will periodically set it aside and work after my hands cool off. If it gets a little hard from sitting out (i made it, and worked so much I couldnt mold it for about two days) just work it, like you would clay, making it more pliable with warmth. I find the peices just on the outside, the most "dry" are the most moldable, because it will not slide back into a round ball as easily. 

Oh, and rose petals? I find it helps to make a ball, and squish it down with a finger in the middle... then shape it into a teardrop. In general, I get really nice petals that way. I make about ten and then start to shape, peicing them together.

Loved how this turned out. If you add the corn syrup while the chocolate is still to hot, it will turn into a huge oily mess. Just let it sit and cool before kneading again, cause you need the oil to stay in. If it is to stiff, you can add more corn syrup. When it set, I had to knead a bit to get it plyable, but kneaded it with mm fondant and made chocolate fondant..... So, so good!!! Will use white chocolate next time and combine with mm fondant so I can use different colors. Need to try to make roses with this too!

Great, easy to deal with. Needed several colors si I prepared it with withe chocolate. When it was cooled I put in the different colors by rewarming the pieces a few seconds in the microwave, so it became smooth but still hard enough to handle with! Will definitively make this again!

Wow so easy! Don`t do what I did and wrap in a napkin to absorb tha greasiness I had fun picking the napkin back off! I found it easier to work with when left overnight to `set` the microwaved for 10 to 15 seconds to make it workable again.

I used this recipe to make white chocolate for a replica of an AA chip for a cake.  It worked out just great.  I have a lot to learn about writing on chocolate (a LOT to learn).  This was a first attempt at this.  Because I didn't need very much, I used 4 ounces of white chocolate chips and 2 tablespoons of corn syrup.  It really does get easy to handle as you knead it.

Love this recipe!!!  It is tougher to work with than fondant but you actually want to eat these decorations!  I will use it now instead of fondant!  Easy to make too!  I use white candy melts and then after it is set and ready to use just add color and shape, mold, play as much as you want!!

Easy. Easy. EASY!!! I didn't mind the grease since it separates itself from the chocolate. I used my trusty little dipper crock pot to melt the chocolate (enough to hold a pound of it) and pour in half cup of corn syrup. Stir until well blended, tip over the sink to drain the grease, be mindful that none of the plastic chocolate goes with it. This will be my first choice now for decorating cakes. I hate the messiness of marshmallow fondant! This turns out a lot cheaper too. Thanks for the post  :)

This recipe was a life saver, although I actually had to change it all. I live in Australia and couldn't find corn syrup, so decided to go with honey instead. I also used dark chocolate (72% cocoa), because I wanted to have a very dark color to my decoration. The taste was just fine. Honey will crystalize the sugar a bit, so after leaving it set overnight you need to work the dough a bit to get rid of any lumps. Since this was my first time, I struggled a lot until I realized that, for this version of mine, it is much better to refrigerate the dough as I work with small amounts at the time. For instance, I opened it flat with a rolling pin (between sheets of wax paper) and refrigerated the flat pieces prior to cutting letters or shaping things. Then I refrigerated again, and just then placed on my cake, which was covered with white fondant. Anyway, it turned out great. Highly recommended :)

I found this mix very greasy when I first started working with it (it might have been the chocolate i worked with) - to the point of having to squeeze it out and blot it with paper towel. After I did that - it was soooo easy to work with. I will never use gumpaste again!

I seemed to have the opposite problem that everyone else had. Mine came out so stiff that I am not sure how I will roll it out. I made a batch of semi-sweet chocolate as well as a batch of white chocolate (used melting wafers). I carefully measured and followed all directions. The only thing I can think of, is that perhaps the corn syrup was too thick. I will try again and am open to suggestions.

I have used this recipe with both semisweet and white chocolate and it turns out perfect every time!  I don't even use fondant anymore, this stuff turns out and tastes amazing!  Also works great in the Cricut Cake cutter.

Fantastic! Easy to make, easy to use, very tasty (I'm not a fan of marzipan or fondant when it comes to the taste). I made this with white chocolate and added a few drops of red food coloring to achieve a cherry blossom pink and make little cherry blossoms to top cookies with. Came out perfect!

I made this with white chocolate and was able to sculpt some pretty detailed items (jack in pulpit, dragon neck and head) very easily. This keeps amazingly well and is nice to work with. LOVE it! Definitely let it sit, wrapped in plastic, over night BEFORE trying to work with it.  Much better that way.

It was a fun experiance. I'm having trouble with it because it is chocolate and the warmth from my hands melts it before i can mold it. If I were molding something big and thick it would be a different story I think.The recipe is a good one though and will definately use it more like fondant.

I couldn't get this to work properly - the white chocolate version was far too runny and the dark one was too solid! Found it very difficult to work with - I did perservere and it turned out ok in the end but I was afraid of the chocolate roses melting on the cake.

OMG This recipe is amazing! I've used it 2 times already. I've used it to cover cake balls and truffles, I also used some with my niece's birthday cake. I'll be using this one forever!

I think this is a great recipe. Soo easy to make. However, after two days, it was still a bit too soft. Don't know if it was maybe because of the warm weather here. Sooooo messy to work with that way. I made roses to decorate a cake, but had to refrigereate every half hour to an hour so it can be workable. I made all the little balls for the roses first, then refrigerated them before shaping. Maybe next time, I'll add less corn syrup, might work better. thanks!

Wonderful!  We made this to cover a Playstation birthday cake for my 10 year old grandson.  (The cake was a thin 3 layer devils food with a whipped frosting as the filling.)  He was overheard saying to a friend "Yeah, my cake is really cool." and four people attending his party said "this is the cake I want for my birthday"!

Easy and fun cake topping.  I used this in two ways when making decorated cupcakes.  Firstly, I shaped it into chocolate roses.  Temperature is extremely important in handling.  Making the petals first and letting them rest at room temperature ~10 mins before joining them into a flower eliminated wilting.  Additionally I rolled it thin ~1/8" and layered it over peanut butter frosting on chocolate cupcakes.  It was a huge hit especially with children.  Thanks for the recipe!

I used this instead of fondant to cover my son's birthday cake because I don't like the taste of fondant. I will say, the flavor was better than fondant (taste and texture is just like that of a soft tootsie roll) but this stuff was incredibly hard for me to work with. It was sticky and gooey and I had to use a LOT of cocoa powder to get it to roll out and not stick to the rolling pin and my hands and the counter. And in the end, it ripped and came apart across one side of the cake and just looked a mess. My son is 1 so he didn't notice but next time, I will stick to fondant.

Does anybody have an tips for rolling this chocolate. I want to use it to cover a cake for my friends wedding and I am finding it sticks to everything including the rolling pin. I have tried using Trex and using cocoa but have had no success with either.

I made exactly and it did harden over night but it becomes very hard to work with due to the chocolate melting while working with it. I am going to try working with it after chilling or maybe adding less corn syrup.

Great, Wonderfull.  I used it perfectly to make some really freaky monster like features for some food photography.  I also managed to do it with some butter scotch chips for some added color. i did take the idea of one of the others as well and left it at room temp to make it less sticky ((Needed for the butter scotch)).  Adding some color to white chocolate can really make the cake...Ummm...Well it made it look like it was bleeding.  Food Photos turned out super.

This worked well to make decorations for a beaver cake I made! Tip though: after melting the chocolate, allow it to cool down to about 90-91 degrees before stirring in the corn syrup. That'll help avoid separation. I used about 1/3 cup corn syrup for 8 oz white chocolate, and about 1/2 cup corn syrup for 16 oz dark chocolate. Was relatively easy to work with and holds shapes well! Will definitely use again!

I tried twice with white chocolate and got a crumbly oily mess. Thinking I overheated it the first time, I was careful to just get the chocolate warm enough to melt smoothly the second time.  Still, the instant I added the karo light corn syrup I got a crumbly mess.

I tried this recipe last weekend with white chocolate... fantastic! I will use this instead of fondant. I wonder if I could add flavors to the white or chocolate?

Followed recipe exactly and it's too sticky and soft to form roses or leaves.  Don't know what to do with this lump of gooey stuff now.  I ended up purchasing real roses to decorate my cake.
