I have to agree with another reviewer, this lemonade is pretty tart.  The flavor didn't really meld together well, so one sip was too sour and the next too sweet.  It was okay for a quick recipe, but I think next time I will make a syrup with the water and sugar like you are supposed to.  This one had weird results.

This recipe was perfect!  My 7 and 5 year old girls and I made it for their "lemonade stand."  I cheated and bought frozen lemonjuice since I didn't have a juicer.  Everyone was surprised when it was REAL lemonade and not Koolade!  They did great on sales!

I chose this recipe bacause it was quick and I was looking for an afternoon activity to do with the kids.  The kids loved it; I would reduce the sugar by at least 1/2c to make it a little less sweet for the adults.  Nice and tasty though.

This is a great lemonade, but if you are using lemons off a tree, like I am, this may be too sweet.  My wife drinks a ton of a major brand of lemonade and we both found this to be way too sweet.  But our lemons are pretty sweet from our tree (for a lemon anyway).

We've made this a few times already, I wasn't too sure at first b/c it's so sweet, but it ends up being super addicting.  This is so yummy!  Perfect with a summer dinner.

This is wonderful - I used medium-large organic lemons and natural sugar (not white) for this and it is some of the best lemonade we've ever tasted!

Yum, tasty & easy. I will have to admit I used Splenda. I had lemons left-over from a big family fish boil. This was a great way to use them. Thanks!

This was sooo refreshing!  The only thing I did different was to use raw sugar, and I simmered it in 2 Cups of the water till it dissolved.  Just perfect!
