This was my first attempt at a tart and I cheated with a pre-bought pastry case from Sainsbury's which was very nice!  The tart was easy to make and I substituted the brandy with vanilla vodka which complements the delicate flavours of the apples and almonds perfectly.  This tart looks very impressive and also tastes lovely so I will definately be making it again.

This was a beautiful addition to my Thanksgiving dinner, and was perfect for those who didn't care for pumpkin pie!  I have made this several times, each time trying to make adjustments to keep it from being so buttery.  Final tweaks to the dough:  1 1/2 cup flour (instead of 1 1/3 cup), 1/4 tsp salt (instead of a pinch), 1/4 cup sugar (if you want it a little sweeter), 1 egg (instead of 1 egg yolk), and NO water.  Refrigerate for at least 1 hour in the plastic wrap.  Tweaks to the frangipane:  add 1/2 tsp. almond extract, and toast the almonds before grinding.  Roll out the pastry dough, fit into the pan, then refrigerate 30 minutes.  Add the frangipane, then the apples (use small apples - makes fitting them in the pan MUCH easier), then refrigerate for 30 minutes.  Bake on the oven rack, not on a baking sheet.  Perfection!  Thanks for the recipe!

I have a solution to a lot of bakers who felt that the frangipane (almond filling) was not almondy enough. Toast the almond before grinding them. The flavors of the almonds will reveal themselves.

I was very excited to make this tart for a photo project my partner was working on. I chose it based on the reviews I had read here. I'm lucky it came out looking as good as it did ,because  the flavor was just not there. I followed the recipe to the letter aside from cooking an additional 20 minutes. I wish the frangipane had more almond flavor and the crust was less greasy. Its a good start and with a few revisions I think it would be fantastic.

For those that noted that the tart turned out too greasy, its because the pastry crust was allowed to go to room temperature. As the recipe states, it needs to be chilled - otherwise the fats in the crust sweat a little, making it greasy. I actually let the pastry (in the pie tins) chill in the freezer while I prepare the apples and frangipane. 

As for the frangipane, I substituted the apple brandy with amaretto (Disorono to be specific). It gave it a much more almondy taste (which some reviewers commented was missing) with the special richness that only liquor can give =). Substituting with almond extract, I feel would not be as interesting (though I haven't tried it). As per other reviewers, toasting the almonds before combining in the frangipane is a must! Great recipe - turned out beautiful and was extremely impressive! Love it!

This tart really looked nice with the apples spiraled together and the browned sugar on top. I didn't have any apple brandy so I omited that and added just a touch of apple juice instead. The almonds and the apples were delicious together, and the pastry was nice and flaky. I did have to bake this longer than suggested, probably about 15 to 20 minutes longer. My only complaint was that it seemed a little greasy. Other than that, a really tasty tart.

I had a problem with this recipe. Let it be said I am not a good pie/tart baker to begin with though. I used premade pie crust, and splenda instad of sugar. Maybe that could have been why but after baking the tart it was VERY VERY greasy. I had to actually drain the tart while it was still warm, if I hadnt have done that it would have been ruined! 
After I drained the tart is was pretty good. Could use more flavor, maybe almond liquor or extract?

Loved this easy to prepare, show stopping gorgeous dessert. I did toast the almonds prior to grinding them in the frangipane. I also didn't happen to have any apple brandy on hand but I did have some Orgeat (almond syrup) to use instead. For the topping, I didn't have the apricot jam and instead used orange marmalade mixed with a couple of TBSP of the orgeat to brush on the top. Also used raw sugar to sprinkle on top instead of regular white sugar. This was a huge hit with everyone in my family and guests. Wonderful recipe and easy dough to work with.

My friends and I made this tart for a french project. we couldn't use nuts so instead we put in imitation almond extract.I don't know what it is like with just almonds but it was AMAZING! it was so good tasting. we had to make three tarts and we discovered that make sure you cream together the butter and the sugar together before you add the egg in step 2 or else it turns out like liquid

I was tired of the usual apple pies and tarts and so I made this recipe instead. I had to cook it 15 minutes longer than what the recipe called for (maybe my oven is not as strong). I also added in 1-2 tablespoon of almond extract to bring out the almond flavor and left out the brandy since I didn't have it on hand. It tasted amazing, a very unique flavor that you can't find at a bakery. The tenderness of the apples, combined with the crispness of the pastry crust and the sweetness of the almond filling was to die for.

Always get tons of compliments on this one. I have yet to add the apricot brandy, which I will at some point, but it works well without it. And I skip the pie tin and use a cookie sheet for jelly roll pan for a free form round crust.

I can never find apply brandy, so I usually replace that with either grated apples or apple juice/cider. I also add extra chunks of apple . . . which is why my baking time is always off (it usually takes me more than 30 minutes - even an hour - of baking). Therefore, my crust is always browner or drier than it should, and the center of my pie can be mushy. I also never added almonds . . . 

That being said, every time a friend tries this dish I always receive praise. Maybe it's the extra honey (which I use instead of white sugar) that I add into the batter. Maybe it's how beautiful the apple slices are on top. Or maybe it's my friends who don't normally bake so thankfully have nothing to compare my baking skills with. Regardless, this is always my go-to recipe if I want to bake anything with apple. Absolutely love it and been using this recipe for over 3 years now.

If you're like me, who never follows the recipes to the tee, I'd recommend trying this out! Maybe one day I will follow this recipe to the tee (I was so close today until I added 2 extra tbs of cider + apple chunks) . . .

Made this, this weekend for a French Film Night.  Everyone agrees, definitely needs made again.  Crust is VERY buttery and fine textured. I used Empire apples - they held their texture very well, and gave nice tangy flavour.

Love it! Made it for my friends and they absolutely loved it . The pie was gone in 20 min.  It didn't come out as golden as it is on the picture and I don't know why. I kept it longer in the oven than I was supposed to hoping to get that gold color but it still came out pale . Other than that absolutely delicious !

Made this as one of many for a Thanksgiving crowd, and it was the hands-down favorite. We had to use a different pastry because we had to have it gluten-free, but we made everything else as close to the recipe as possible. We didn't have the tablespoon of apple brandy so we substituted a teaspoon of regular brandy plus two teaspoons of almond extract. The almond filling and apricot jelly glaze really "made" this!

This recipe is delicious. I've made it several times. The only thing I've changed is to use apple jelly rather than apricot preserves because my family finds it too sour. I've also added dried cranberries to the jelly and that is not only a beautiful presenttion but also& a nice flavor combo.

I've always loved the frangipane filling but had no idea what it was!  For the crust I used silly rabbit's shortbread crust.  Made the frangipane as stated except to replace the apple brandy with 1/2 teaspoon almond extract.  I tossed the apple slices in some cinnamon sugar before arranging on top.  Sprinkled sliced almonds on top of the apples and baked at 350 for about 35mins.  Used apple jelly instead of apricot jam.  Also made this with pears.  Everyone (including me) was awed by the taste and presentation.  Thank you for sharing this!!!

Thank you for this amazing recipe! This is a true classic and hugely successful. I did how ever replace the alcohol with our local South African brands and result was delicious, maybe a little on the tipsy side.

I thought it was just perfect. The crust was lovely and remained crisp. I used a canned almond paste and a hazelnut liqueur and baked it quite a lot longer than directed, until the apples were soft to a fork. Yummy and beautiful.

This was my first time making a tart of any kind. (I wanted to try out my new tart pan!) It was absolutely delicious and tasted just like the tarts I had while visiting England recently. The only change I made was adding 1/4 teaspoon of Almond Extract to the frangipane as some of the other reviewers suggested. I will certainly be making this again and plan on baking it to take to Christmas parties this year. Not only does it taste lovely, but it's lovely to look at as well.

This is a classic recipe. I've been making these since before I came to the States (over 25 years). Among the comments about it are that it seems surprisingly "light" (no-one checked the calories!) and not over sweet. It tastes great and very nearly always looks impressive. Keep the frangipane though.

Delicious! I made it for a dinner party and everyone loved it. They weren't just being polite, either.  The pastry is so tastely. I ususally do not like pie crust, but this one almost tastes like a soft shortbread. It was yummy. It was incredibly easy and fun to make.  I made some additions, however.   1. I toasted slivered almonds with some cinnamon, then ground it in a food preocesser. 2. I added two  TBS of good French brandy to the final Frangipane mixture.  MMMM 3. I soaked the apples in some brandy and sugar (I used small red sweet and sour apples from a coworker's tree) as I made everything else.  ****I may add lcourser grounded toasted almonds to the pastry part next time.  I recommend this tart.

This was so easy to make for such an amazing dessert! Instead of brandy I used the same amount of Amaretto Liqueur, gave  lots of almond flavor! I also used brown sugar instead and mixed in some tart apples for a really interesting flavor! I was surprised it came out so well!

Very yummy tart. This my first time making a tart, and it turn out great. I didn't use brandy, I used 3/4 tsp of almond extract instead. I kinda over worked the dough, so it was slightly chewier then I think it was supposed to be. I also didn't have a tart/pie pan, so i used a spring form pan instead and crimped the sides. Served with vanilla ice cream and the flavors exploded!

This tart made me look like a professional! I cheated and used store bought puff pastry, omitted the brandy altogether and added raspeberries as a garnish to add color. Fabulous!

Great recipe.  Switched out the pommes for pears.  I also had to increase baking time slightly.  Melted some crabapple jelly for topping.  Devoured by the family in 20 minutes!

This is wonderful! And have made it twice so far. Used Solo Almond Paste, then added vanilla, eggs and less sugar (paste is sweetened a bit).  Would never know the difference.  Slice the apples thinly (but not paper thin) for easier layering and presentation.  Will use this recipe for a Pear Tart for a Chanukah dinner.

I do not bake too often and I do not make pastry, but this was such a delight to make and not that time consuming.  Just follow the "chill" pastry and chill the frangipane before adding to pastry; they are important. It turned out wonderfully with flaky crust and a wonderful apple filling.  Everyone loved it; something different from a regular pie

Absolutely delicious.  To make it easier, I bought the frozen pie crust at Trader Joes, and I  made the frangipane with Odense Almond Paste( in the baking aisle of most supermarket) and butter, I skipped the sugar since the paste is already sweet.

It's my first time making a tart and it turned out beautifully! We have a CSA with our local farmer's market and I really wanted to make a dessert with the beautiful mountain apples we got.  I definitely recommend using different kinds of apples in the same pastry for added interest (I think I used three different kinds of apples!).

This is my husband's new favorite pie crust and he loved the tart (we're not apple pie fans, but this was great). I did not need all four apples, so you may want to peel and slice three and go from there as needed... I had to pull my apples off and start over with the placement. Start by really stacking them like cd's on a shelf - slightly tilted, almost on end...really squeeze them in together somewhat upright. The apricot preserve gave it the beautiful brown color and kept the apples moist. PS - first time i ever made a pie crust and it turned out great (beginners luck or great recipe??)

This was a little bland for my taste and needed a little more apple flavor. I will make it again because I definitely think it is a "workable" recipe, but next time perhaps I'll cook down some apple juice and add that to the filling. Also, be sure to refrigerate the filling if it is ready before the dough is chilled! I didn't, which I think is what caused some of the butter to melt out through the crust. Thank, Wurzeltree!

This tart is absolutely beautiful to look at, but unfortunately, it didn't live up to it's looks!!  I have been baking for over 45 years and have never put so much work into a recipe and had it disappoint me this much. I didn't care for the consistency of the almond filling (and I LOVE almond flavoring).  The guests were appreciative of the beauty of this tart, but I fear they too were more than a little let down when eating it!!  I wouldn't go to all this trouble again.  Sorry:-(  If it weren't so pretty, I'd only give it 2 stars!!

Yes, I cheated with a box mix for the crust (I have yet to master the art of a good crust), but otherwise this was an amazingly easy recipe to follow. I substituted 1/2 teaspoon Almond Extract for the Apple Brandy and added a dash of Nutmeg. My husband loves Apple pie and was a little upset I wasn't making one, but he was pleasantly surprised by this tart. He said it reminded him of a breakfast Bear Crawl with Apples. Excellent Recipe! Thank you.

Very good -my first try at making a tart.   However I did not have any apply brandy so I used whiskey instead.  I don't think I used quite enough because it did not have much flavor.  Also, my husband took it out of the oven and I forgot to do the sugar and apircots on top, but I still thought that it was very good.

Some minor  tweaks done to the original recipe, thanks to the previous reviews  & f2 trials. I went easy on the butter as indeed following  the original recipe the pastry got a bit drippy. For the seemingly muted almond flavor, I used the blanched/slivered almond instead  of the toasted nuts.  The identifiably almond essence, I would come to know, is actually from the raw nuts and is lost by toasting.

Everbody in my famly LOVED this tart. I thought it was pretty good but my tart didn't come out as brown as the one in the picture. Also, many people commented on this already, but it really was very very greasy. When I took it out of the oven to sprinkly sugar on it, the apples were drenched in the grease....I didn't do anything though and it came out fine after cooling for a bit. Overall, the recipe was easy to follow, the tarte normande looked beautiful, and impressed my family; I give this a thumbs up.

This was amazing! My extremely picky brother devoured two pieces, and I already had requests to make it for Thanksgiving!  Used 1/4 tsp. almond extract in lieu of almonds (since I found out as I was baking that we were out of almonds!), and while it probably didn't taste as good as with the real almonds, but having never made this before, we all thought it was lovely! (And it definitely had an almond-y taste to it!).

THANK YOU FOR THIS WONDERFUL RECIPE!  DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING IN THIS RECIPE.  IT IS ABSOLUTELY PERFECT.  DO NOT USE ANY VANILLA OR ALMOND EXTRACTS - BUY A SMALL BOTTLE OF GOOD QUALITY APPLE BRANDY.  I USED GOLDEN DELICIOUS APPLES AND COOKED 5 MINUTES LONGER.   MY HUSBAND WANTS THIS EVERY WEEK NOW!  THIS IS A VERY VERY SPECIAL TART - 5 STARS++++

Easy and delicious. It looks like an elegant dessert, yet it can be made with ingredients on hand. I used a frozen crust to make it even easier.

This tart was outstanding!  I cheated and bought frozen piecrust to save time... but it came out delisious.  I substituted 1 tsp of almond extract for the brandy.  I think maybe I would use 3/4 tsp next time as it was a little strong... but for anyone who was saying this recipe was a little bland I recommend using almond extract.

I made two of these for a co-worker's birthday.  I did not want to purchase apple brandy, so I substituted 1 tsp. almond extract to enhance the almond flavor.  Also, instead of apples on one, I used fresh halved cherries.  Both were excellent.  I did not put the apricot glaze on the cherry tart, but dusted it with powdered sugar instead, and served both with fresh whipped cream.  Well worth the effort.

I made this tart and it was excellent. The directions was easy to follow and the tart came out perfect. Not to sweet and a fantastic almond and apple aroma. However I found the part where you have to put the sugar on to caramalise not required.

This was spectacular.  I also toasted the almonds for the frangipane, skipped the extra egg yolk, and used rum instead of apple brandy.  I didn't have any apricot jelly for the glaze, so I just sprinkled some left over ground almonds. You couldn't  see the beautiful apples, which was just as well, because mine weren't so pretty.  I also baked it about 15 minutes longer than recommended.

I just made this apple tart today... the frangipane is so delicious! My boyfriend isn't a huge apple fan, so he put those on my plate... I could totally see using some other sort of fruit instead of the apples too, just not sure what yet. I also used 3/4 c. ground almonds and marsala wine instead of apple brandy. I will definitely make this again!

Perfect recipe- less sugar than others I saw on the web; also the ingredient quantities were in cups not weight which made life much easier. I use spelt flour and expeller expressed canola oil for the crust- increased the flour to 2 cups. Just pressed it in and stuck it in the freezer while I prepared the frangipane. No need to chill, roll, chill... Came out yummy. I didn't even do the apricot glaze, because I was serving it to guests who have to watch their sugar. The drop of sugar sprinkled on top made it finished looking enough. I use a European oven with double turbo so I reduced the temperatures by 10 degrees Celsius- the cooking times were exactly right.

I have to give this 4 stars since I had to do some tweaking with my on-hand ingredients and I had to bake it for an additional 15 min.  Instead of almonds, I chopped up pecans and instead of apple brandy, I used 1 tsp butterscotch flavoring.  That being said, it was fabulous and received rave reviews from my inlaws.  I will def. make again. Thanks!

This tart wasn't bad, but it wasn't good enough to make again.  I took reveiwers' advice and toasted the almonds before grinding them and added 1/4 tsp. almond extract to the frangipane.  The result was not bland, but just not great.  Thanks anways.

I made this with apples just around the edge, and put fresh kiwi and gold and red raspberries in the center for my husband's 35th birthday. It was BEAutiful, and very much a labor of love. I made the crust IN my tart pan because I was struggling with the dough. That worked just fine and was very easy. Fred Meyer, here in the northwest, has bulk almond-butter, which I used. It was perfect. The apricot glaze really adds to the street appeal, so be sure to use it if you have a special occasion or company.

this was awesome. this was a big HIT at all of my parties. people even said it was there favorate!!! I tried using different apple to see which ones were the best and found out that gala apples are the best thus far.. I have also tried using an amaretto liquor  which enhanced the the almond flavor.

This recipe turned out awesome! It was my first time baking a pie and/or tart. People couldn't get over how pretty it looked and it tasted great. I cheated and bought store-bought crust....  Used the apple brandy...  For my apricot glaze I put a teaspoon of rum and reduced it.

I've made this many times for now, it's always the favourite for my family and friends! Lately I've tried using both Red and Green apple together, and that's actually nice, as the Green apples bring up the freshness of the tart. For people who doesn't like too sweet, I would definitely advise you to mix green apple in it. It's Fresh!

I thought the frangipane could have had more of an almond taste to it.  Next time I think I'll add some almond extract to it.  The sugar on top never carmelized, either.  I ended up sprinkling on some brown sugar to add some more color.

This is a beautiful and tasty tart. I just used my own pie crust recipe, and like others used the almond extract because i didn't have the brandy. I sliced my apples very thin- turned out delicious and served with vanilla bean ice cream.

I made this for Thanksgiving and heard a lot of "Oohh's" and "Ahhh's". Everyone thought it was beautiful, and said it tasted wonderful. One person even told me that I should open up a bakery :). I did as others suggested and added almond and vanilla extract instead of the apple brandy. The aroma of this tart was lovely! I did notice the grease that others were talking about that rose to the top of the tart while baking. This came from the frangipane, and I believe it may have been because I let it get very warm before I baked it (I let it sit out while I prepared the apples and crust). I added extra sugar on top to soak up some of the butter, and then I broiled it to achieve a crusty "brûlée" like top. This made the extra "grease" end up looking wonderful! My first time trying tart crust, and it was extremely easy to work with (and this is coming from someone that absolutely ruins pie crust every time I try to bake with it!) Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe, I will keep this one in my holiday go-to's!

Made this recipe last night and it came out perfect! I did not have Apple Brandy and didn't replace it with anything although I did put 1/8tsp of pure almond extract which helped bring out the almond taste very nicely. Having read the other reviews I did chill the dough quite a bit and had no greasy issues. This one is a keeper!

I made this with gluten-free flour in the pastry and frangipane. The crust was not greasy, and turned out flaky and delicious--just slightly crumbly and a bit more difficult to roll than I am used to, but could've been because of the GF-flour. Per previous reviews, I toasted the almonds and substituted apple juice for brandy. I also used less sugar on top. I received lots of compliments on this tart; it is lightly sweet, has a nice presentation, and is overall very tasty. I did have to bake for longer, as other reviewers also stated. Another thing I would do next time is perhaps use an egg wash to make the crust a little more brown. Make sure that you keep the frangipane and the pastry cool before/while assembling the tart; otherwise, the butter could melt out while you're doing other things. I recommend slicing the apples first and keeping them in a bowl of water to prevent browning.

I used a pastry dough I bought at Whole Foods and this was pretty easy.  Tastes delicious, I may try less butter next time.

Tasty recipe! I used apple jelly with a little of the apple brandy for the glaze. I put some on before baking and again half way through. Other recommendations have noted that the crust is greasy. The way to avoid this is to BLIND BAKE THE CRUST! It keeps the frangipane from making the crust soggy, too. 

PS - it should be tarte AUX pommes not tarte de pommes

My first attempt to do a french apple tart. Actually first time i made a pastry! I ve followed the recipe by the letter and the result was WOW! We all loved it! Like the idea of the apricot jelly at the end. Served tart with a vanilla cream.

I made this recipe was told by a guest that it was "the best dessert" they had ever had. :) I did have to bake it longer though I did multiply the recipe about a dozen times. A little time consuming, but well worth it.

great recipe--exactly what i was looking for! alterations included using a pillsbury pre-made crust (sorry), 2 large apples sliced thin, 3/4 c. ground almonds, only 1 egg, a 1 T. of vanilla vodka. i found that, in order to get a nice golden brown top, the baking time was closer to 40 minutes in my oven. will definitely make this again.

To give this recipe the credit it deserves, it looked beautiful and the crust was amazing (I'll be using it again). I did not realize however, how sweet it would be (much too sweet!) Also, the almond flavor was very strong, so if you don't really like marzipan (like my husband), you probably won't like the filling.

I altered this recipe a little bit. I'm allergic to gluten, so I made the crust and the filling with gluten free flour. And I also am not a huge fan of walnuts...so I substituted ground ginger cookies (yum!) 

It came out awesome!

This was very good and I will definitely be making it again. Next time I'll add some almond extract to the frangipane because it really didn't have the almond flavor I was expecting. I was disappointed that the sugar on top of mine never carmelized for some reason. I ended up sprinkling it with brown sugar and letting that melt over the tart to give it some color.

This was amazing! My husband thought it was one of the best desserts he's ever had. I didn't have any brandy, so used 1 tsp of almond extract instead. The crust was unbelievably light, flaky and delicious. A real keeper!!

Saved a little time and used pre-made pastry, that I rolled out onto pie plate and then followed the recipe almost exactly.  I don't believe it took away from the original recipe and just makes it slightly easier for those of us short on time! Only change was to use Amaretto instead of the Calvados, because that is what I had, and I thought it would add to the almond flavor, and maybe an additional splash of almond essence. Oh and I didnt have apricot jam, so used strawberry instead- no problem!
Needless to say my family (who can be very suspicious of new recipes) absolutely devoured it, This was a huge hit and I will be making it again very soon with no other changes.

I made this as is.  After making this a couple of times, I modified the technique. ... I made the dough in the mixer (paddle attachment, don't mix too much).  Once combined, I dropped the dough into my pie pan (deep dish) and pushed it into place - NO rolling).  Refrigerate for 30 minutes.  prick and continue as directed.  Holy cow!  Easy, yummy and fit for a party or company (maybe even the queen).  I now use this crust recipe for other recipes as well, since it's so easy and turns out great!

Bake this amazing apple pie at 400º for 45 minutes. Sprinkle the sugar over the top and continue to bake 10to 15 minutes. I did not have apricot jelly so I mixed an apricot spread with Raspberry All Fruit. It was to die for!

A winner!  Made for July 4th party; used 2 Honey Crisp & 2 Granny Smith’s; toasted almonds prior to grinding & added 1 tsp almond extract to the frangipane mixture based on previous reviews.   This was a beautiful dessert and equally as tasty. Thrre wasn’t a crumb left!

For Valentine's dinner, I cooked this for two of us. It was amazing. I will definitely do this agin and again. By reading the other people's review, I made sure the crust is frozen hard before I put apples in, also, I added a little nature almond flavour. Good tart.
I also agree with many of other reviewers that the cooking time need more. I added 30 minutes more than the original receipt suggested. I add 10 minutes each time and check the doneness, then add another 10, then another 10 minutes.

I followed the recipe. It is delicious. For the ground almonds I ground whole almonds in the food processor. It was good. Tasted the tart before putting on the apricot jam and it was not so sweet. Make sure to glaze the tart with the jam. Next time I make it though I will grind blanched whole almonds because I find almond peeling to be slightly bitter. I will be making this apple tart again. And again.

While the flavor was good and the family ate it all, should the base have been cooked first?  The base had an uncooked flavor to it.   Instead of apple brandy, I used apple juice. I chose Envy apples for the fruit.

I made a variation on this recipe using pears and apples - also using cut up apple in the frangipane and sliced almonds to top to complement the ground almond. Was GREAT. I think maybe better than the stock recipe. Though I found the cooking time with all the fruit on top was probably twice what was suggested.

The pastry - Follow it to the letter! it's a good one! I had some problems with it while working the dough and was kind of worried that it might be too dry or something - as the 'wet' consistency was difficult - but it worked out great in the end. Just dont' leave much exposed or it will likely burn with all the heat required to cook the fruit in this recipe. 

Oh  - i nearly forgot! I used vanilla bean extract in the frangipane as well as crushed almond. It was great.

Hopefully my picture of this is visible (?)

Amazing recipe - easy to follow. I've tweaked it a little as I didn't have ground almond - so used ground nutmeg mixed with some cinnamon instead and it tastes fantastic. Also, once the pie is almost ready, I would drizzle some honey (after having already added some sugar on top of the pie) and pop it back in the oven for 5 minutes, it really helps the sugar caramelise faster. Made it for my partner and he loved it straight away.

I love this recipe! Some adjustments I made which I liked better second time around. For the dough, I bought pre-made puff pastry dough which is way better than regular pie dough I had used in the past. Me personally I'm not a fan of the almondy taste so I didn't add any almonds. I also found the Frangipane to taste too buttery and too sweet so I used only 1/4 butter for frangipane and 2/3 sugar instead or I've used raw sugar which definitely makes it less sweet and is probably healthier. I also had to cook it longer than recipe calls for about 20 more minutes. All in all great tasty tart!!

Everyone I served this to loved it but I thought it needed a little kick with flavoring. Would add cinnamon next time or almond flavoring to the crushed almonds.. overall a very good recipe.

I double the amount of Apple Brandy, and add a Table Spoon of Almond Extract. I always have, and it turns out wonderful. Make sure to 'dry' some of the apples if you do though, or it could end up just a bit too liquid-y to set right.

I originally made this some years ago when I was researching Normandy for French class, brought it in as a project and easily got a 110% (She gave 10 % to her favorite project of the class whenever we did them). It also showed me how amazing Apricot Jam is.

I must say that the almond frangipane didn't set completely and too much sugary as for my liking... I would put a bit less sugar and more apples , and a bit of cinammon...

The crust is ok, but is a lot of butter and runny.

Wonderful flavor.  I used calvados instead of apple brandy cause that is what I had on hand.  Easy to make and a real crowd pleaser.  I even made it more simple by using pizza dough I bought at grocery store; real time  saver and delicious.  Great with the apricot jam.  I also have used lemon pear marmalade which is great.  I did sprinkle apple slices with lemon juice to keep them from turning brown.  Using the honey crisp apples is perfect!

Very nice, used apple schnapps instead because the brandy available was too expensive.

Mon Dieu! I really felt like I was eating something from a little French patisserie (and trust me, I ate most of it myself!)! I baked this in an oven which, as it turned out, bakes at 20 degrees lower than it's set to. Despite that, I just kept it in longer, and while the sugar didn't carmelize and the apples were a bit stiff, it was still amaaaazing! The crust is precisely perfect in every way. I can't wait to bake it in an accurate oven!!

I made this for a dinner party and it was a huge hit.  I served it nice and warm right out of the oven. Mmm... it was soo  sweet and tasty.   I did use about 2teaspoons of almond extract after reading the other reviews, i think it really enhanced the flavors.  This was soo good I am making it for Thanksgiving.
