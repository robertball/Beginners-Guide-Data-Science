I had good results substituting some of the miracle whip with Greek yogurt to cut back on the fat. Not the most amazing enchilada recipe, but nice to keep on hand since it uses all ingredients I normally have around.

I made this the other day, although I added onion, and much more cheese, and served with sour cream and homemade taco bell hot sauce!  It was loved by all, and I will make it again, often!  Very easy to make too.

I have celiacs disease so I've modified this to fit my lifestyle but I use it all the time. of course for the flour I use a GF substitute. I use this as a dip for parties. After it's all together I bake it in a casseroll dish with some more cheese on top and serve with lime flavoured tostitos and it's a huge hit!

Great recipe. Really easy and tasty. Next time I'm adding green onions, and/or bacon. I made some smothered in the cheese sauce and some without (the latter having just grated cheese on top). Both were delicious.

Very good and easy to make.  Did add onion, garlic, cayenne, and oregano to chicken.  Only used about half the amount of cheese, to make a little lighter.

Been using this recipe for awhile but always add some green onion, more cheese, and more spices.  But the basic recipe is perfect as a starter.

Loved it! Added alot more cheese and garnished with diced onions and sour cream. I usually make my Mexican dishes on the spicy side, and everyone loved it(without the spice)..lol
