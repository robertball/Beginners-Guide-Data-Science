I really liked the spices used in this recipe.  I did add toasted pine nuts and raisins to mine because that's how I remember it being made by the father and his family

Can't beat the flavour of this sauce. I added some capers and olives to keep it close to the traditional recipe. This is a rich sauce which is even better the next day. This is also a nice side dish for a burrata or fresh mozzarella. Thank you for the recipe.
