I just made this recipe and it is delicious!  I used leftover pork should roast for this and left out the liver.  I had seen on other reviews that it was left out and that made me happy.  Other than that, I followed the recipe as written.  It is delicious and I will make this again for sure :-)

This recipe was easy, and I had all the ingredients on hand. I followed the recipe to the tee, and it was delicious. Everyone in my house loved it even my picky boyfriend. I will definitely be making this often. Thanks for the recipe!

I make this dish. My way; hold the liver!
And I add red bells and peas as well, just like my Auntie Betty. And instead of the tomatoes I use Mama Sita's achuete. It was yummy in my tummy.
Mines was perfect..like Auntie Betty's

Awesome.  Left out the liver.  Added extra garlic and onions and red bell peppers.  Used a 14.5 ounce can of diced tomatoes.  May try next time with fajitas.

I had left over pork roast. Cubed up meat and added to vegetables. Substitute red bell pepper as green bells are gassy. They would add a nice color. Flavor is so good. 

Sprinkled lemon pepper at serving time. Served over Brown rice.

I am looking forward to trying this with pork chops marinade in soy sauce and lemon juice.

Thanks!!! I will definitely make again as I am always looking for a way to use leftover pork roast.

Delicious - my familyâ€™s favorite dish now.  I omit the pork liver and use two or three 14.5 cans of diced tomatoes instead of fresh, makes it more moist, which we prefer.

I use beef (cut in dice) without the liver. So deliciously good!
