This is a really easy and quick meal. Instead of using cream cheese, I used Neufchatel Cheese as it has 1/3 less fat than cream cheese. I also didn't have ground turkey so I used ground chicken. Very tasty. The family loved in...even the picky 3yr old. Thanks for sharing!  I will be making this again.

Fabulous casserole.  I only made two minor changes.  I cooked the minced garlic with the turkey and onion and baked it at 350 degrees for 25 minutes.  I felt that 375 was going to burn the cheese before it was heated through.

When I read about not having much spices, I decided to add my own to the meat. 1 tsp of mustard, 1 tsp of worcester sauce, 2 cloves of garlic, half onion chopped, and add salt and pepper to taste. First put the chopped onion with oil on sauce pan, when golden add the ground turkey. than add the salt and pepper, garlic, mustard and sauce and still add the italian seasoning. cook till no longer pink. and voila! Awesome...I give my recipe 5 stars. Hope u enjoy also

With a few changes, 5 stars!  Great meal for families with little kids.  I sauteed a few crushed garlic cloves in with the onions and ground turkey.  I added more like a tablespoon of italian seasoning to the meat too. In addition to the tomato sauce, I added a can of italian style stewed tomatoes and more dried basil, italian seasoning and onion powder (the added tomatoes made it really yummy!)  I think that if I'd made it as written it may have been a bit bland.  Our 7-year-old loved it, my Hubby had 3 helpings!

I made this tonight but changed it quite a bit because it didn't sound super flavorful as-is.  First I added equal parts sweet onion and green pepper, salt and pepper to begin to sweat them down.  I increased the garlic to 3 cloves (about 1 1/2 tsp minced garlic) which I then added to the onion and peppers after about 6 minutes and cooked about 30 seconds.  I then added 2 heaping T of tomato paste to the onion, peppers and garlic and cooked for a couple of minutes.  I added the ground turkey and cooked just through and then added 3/4 can of 28oz tomato sauce.  I didn't drain the turkey cause I used very lean turkey.  I then added about 1/2 tsp ground oregano and a heaping tsp of basil, salt and pepper to taste instead of the Italian seasoning.  I used 1 1/3 boxes of tri-colored rotini, cooked about 6 minutes which I added to a bowl with 4oz chive cream cheese and parsley and blended until coated.  I then added the turkey mixture to the bowl, 1 1/2 cups mozarella and mixed.  I poured them into a sprayed 13x9 dish and topped with 1/3 cup Parmesan cheese and baked for 20 minutes at 375. It was a big hit with the family.

With the addition of some extra Italian spices and garlic to the ground turkey, this recipe would get 5 stars. I did not have mozzarella, so I used grated Colby jack and it was delicious! A new favorite at my house. My husband said, "It's everything Hamburger Helper wishes it could be." Thanks for the recipe!

I love this one. It was like a super easy Lasagna. Didn't have Tomato Sauce so I used hunts spegetti sauce and bowtie pasta. My husband and three kids loved it! My husband even said "this is the best lasagna you've made yet" HAHA you mean "ground turkey noodle bake"

This was really good! My husband actually enjoyed having leftovers the next night, which is rare. I'd say it tastes a lot like lasagna but it was much easier/quicker to make. Yum!

Was very family friendly and delicious! Even my toddler loved it! I think next time I may use the philadelphia cooking cream in place of the milk, cream cheese, and garlic!

This was a good recipe but a little bland for our tastes.  Next time I'll probably add a little garlic slat to the meat and put some mozzarella in with the noodles because the bottom falls apart really easily and it's hard to get out of the pan in one piece.

My husband and I love this recipe.  I make it exactly as directed, with the exception of using about double the amount of mozzarella cheese on top. I use ground turkey from our local Amish market, as well as Amish whole wheat wide noodles.  Delicious!

I thought this was good and different. It came up under the search for ingredients I had on hand. I like that the cream cheese mixture made the pasta not dry or hard in the oven. Leaving the mozzarella for the top created a nice cheesy layer too. I used lean ground turkey, lite whipped cream cheese, and reduced fat mozzarella and milk. I only had corn pasta, in the house, so I had to use that. Although, I found the taste mixture of it not the best and it was a little heavy. I definitely recommend the pasta suggested. I didn't bother to heat the cream cheese mixture to save on dishes. I just dumped the hot drained pasta, into that bowl, and stirred. I did calculate the calories, and not sure if it was the change in pasta type, however I got 467 calories per serving. Probably not a repeat dish, but it used what I had in the house and for that I am greatful. ty

Made this over the weekend with a few tweaks.  I used onion & chive cream cheese and Half & Half instead of milk.  I used 2 5.5 oz Hot & Spicy V8 and Campbells tomoato soup instead of tomato sauce.  I cooked the ground turkey in vegetable broth, garlic powder and a dry zesty italian dressing mix.  Added dried parsley to both sauces.  Salt & pepper to taste when done.  It was pretty good!

Made this for my family last night. They all enjoyed it!  I used lite cream cheese and skim milk, worked fine.  I did not have Italian  seasoning so I used some garlic powder, oregano, and basil.  Truly comfort food that sticks to your ribs.  Yummy!

This was a nice, simple supper.  We only had about 2C of noodles, but that worked out fine.  Used a frozen 'seasoning blend' of onions, peppers, celery and parsley (mostly onion), an extra clove of garlic for the turkey, a minced stalk of celery with the turkey, and a mozz/parm blend cheese (only about 3/4C to cut down on fat).
Very tasty use for ground turkey.

My husband really liked this.  It reminded me of hamburger helper.  The noodles in the cheese sauce were really tasty.  It was the turkey mixture that was not very flavorful.  Maybe next time I will try this with marinara sauce and not regular tomato sauce.  It definitely needs more spices but it is a good base recipe to make your own.  Thanks for sharing!

I would a little less of the noodles. I did add a pinch of salt & pepper.  It probably would be tasty to add artichoke hearts to the noodle mixture.

Made this almost exactly as the recipe stated. Changed pasta from egg noodles to bow tie and put garlic in both the meat and the sauce (I never measure garlic because I used jarred pre-minced, but it was probably just a little over 2 TBSP or so). I also added some (Lawry’s) seasoning salt, a little sea salt, and black pepper to the meat. I was probably more liberal with the Italian seasoning than the recipe called for. In short though, it was delicious! This will be going on our rotation!

I made this dish and it was delicious!  I did make a few changes.  Because I didn't have mozzarella cheese, I used parmesan cheese for the topping.  I also added a few red and orange bell peppers.  I will pass this recipe along to my friends.  It's a good one!

disappointing.  I had my doubts about the cream cheese and they were ultimately well-founded--the cream cheese made this dish peculiar.

Absolutely delicious! It's basically an easier/faster way home-made lasagna. I didn't alter the recipe in anyway and when I make this, there are never any leftovers.

This was SUPER good! I love the combination of the garlicky cream sauce and the tomato sauce together. I followed the recipe as written, except for adding more like a tablespoon of minced garlic (we love our garlic!) to the cream cheese and milk mixture. I also added two teaspoons of Italian seasoning, instead of one. I did measure out the three cups of egg noodles and wished I would have added another cup or two to have a larger portion of noodles. My husband and I loved it so much we ate the entire dish, except for a little extra that my husband took for lunch the next day! FYI: I made this the night before so I could just pop it in to bake when I got home from work. I had it baking at 375 for about 45 minutes (30 minutes covered ; 15 minutes uncovered) and it still wasn't hot in the middle (cheese wasn't fully melted either), so if you make ahead and refrigerate, then bake - plan on baking it for at least a hour.

This recipe, even with some added peppers, tomato and extra spices was very bland.  Not sure I will attempt again.  Maybe just for a meal for the toddler.

My family enjoyed this, but we felt it need more flavor.  Maybe more garlic, oregano, basil, thyme, etc. would have helped?  All in all, a nice dinner that would make a great meal to take to a new Mom or neighbor.  Thank you for the recipe.

This was so delicious!  I thought it tasted a lot like lasagna but easier to prepare. My son said it tasted like hamburger helper but a hundred times better! Either way it was a winner at my house.  Thanks for submitting this recipe!

My husband loved this dish.  I did add some hot pepper flakes to zest it up a bit.  And I lowered the calories by using low fat milk and cream cheese.

I made this with chopped Turkey left over from Thanksgiving instead of Ground Turkey. We liked it and I will definitely make it again. It was a lot going on at once, but overall it was easy and very good.

Quick and simple dish for a busy day.  If needed, you can easily adapt  based on  what is on hand in your fridge.

One hint is do not  too much cream cheese.  To my liking it would be very rich.

Hearty and very good—a big hit with the husband! I made it as written and it was delicious. It’s not only family-friendly and easy enough for a week night, but it would work for company too. Delighted to find another way to use ground turkey. There are ways to use this noodle bake as a base too and take off from here...next time I might try making it spicey, adding bacon, or using hamburger instead of turkey.  Thanks for this one—it’s a new fav.

I have made this a couple of times. Everyone in the family really enjoys it. After the first time I made it I thought the pasta was a little dry so I doubled the cream sauce. Still wonderful!

This turned out good.  Next time I think I will double the cream mixture  to make the pasta a little more creamy.

I just made this recipe and it was delicious and filling.  All my kids liked it too which is a rarity.  I wasn't sure what to expect, but trusted the good reviews and wasn't disappointed.

So easy and yummy! Husband doesn't like ground Turkey so instead used beef. To kick  the flavor up a notch next time I plan to add more seasoning to the meat sauce mixture. With using beef it kinda tasted like lasagna. We discussed about naming the recipe either poor man's lasagna or lazy lasagna. Will definitely keep making it!

I made as written.  The only change was I mixed the ground turkey with the noodles then sprinkled with cheese and baked it.  One reviewer said the noodles did get hard in the oven.  Very true.  Fantastic.  Will  make again and again.  Thanks.

I made this exactly as directed except I added some red pepper flakes and a jar of mushrooms I happened to have on hand. It was great and made an entire 9x13 pan. I took some to my neighbor and still had enough for 2 meals. It was easy and quite flavorful! I will make this again.

I followed the recipe exactly as written. The consistency was good but we felt it needed to be a little more flavorful. Next time I think I will use spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce and add some red pepper flakes and other spices.

It was delicious & my husband loved it. For the Italian seasoning, I used fresh rosemary and thyme, and dried marjoram and basil. I love onions and garlic, so in addition to what the recipe called for, I bought the canned tomatoes that included garlic and onion. Also, I opted for the shredded Italian 5 cheese mix, as opposed to just mozzarella. The flavors were enhanced nicely when I added sea salt to the meat and cream mixtures. Great dish!

This has become a staple in our house. My picky husband has not accepted any lasagna-like dishes until this. A little heavy (not a diet dish). Quite tasty with mushrooms.

After reading comments I used less spaghetti and more sauce and will continue to do so.  I did add 2 cloves of garlic to onion and ground beef.  Rather than 2 cups of cottage cheese I used  1 cup cottage cheese, 1/2 cup ricotta, 1/2 cup sour cream and added parsley.  I increased Parmesan to 2/3 cup and used garlic butter vs plain.  I substituted the Mozzarella with Monterey Jack and Tex Mex.  Mixing the egg mixture into the spaghetti really makes the dish!

It came out amazing!!! I used Prego Pasta sauce with veggies, so I didn’t need the Italian seasoning. Also, I used only half an onion and since I only had about 2.5 ounces of cream cheese, I put a tablespoon of butter. I am definitely making this again!

The flavor of this recipe was great. I did add a little extra Italian seasoning and salt and pepper. I found the 5 minutes to cook the noodles was a bit too much. Next time I make it I’ll only cook them for 4 minutes. It’s a hit with my family though! :-)

A lot of work since there are three separate pots you're using.  I added peas to the noodle part, and added mushrooms to the ground turkey part.  I wouldn't go to the trouble to make again.

This was ok.  It made a lot so it was great for a full house week  night dinner. The problem is it’s severely under seasoned.  Add more spices.

Great! My 15 year old loves this one. No changes!! But for ease, i made a whole box of noodles, didn't use all sauce on casserole and instead threw it together with extra noodles for leftovers.

This recipe was quick, easy and tasty! I also had everything already on hand so it was perfect for after work. My finicky kid who refuses to eat casseroles and most meat only complained once, and my husband had seconds and then finished it the next morning for breakfast. It was a bit on the bland side but that made it perfect for picky eaters, and the copious amount of cheese helped a lot. Will be making again... and again... and again!

This was a nice dish but I think next time I'm going to use less noodles.  The recipe said 3 cups so we used 2 12oz packages of noodles.  My kids say they love the amount of noodles but my husband and I felt the noodles vs. turkey was a bit disproportionate.  We are thinking maybe next time we try this with either 1 12 oz package or 16 oz (2 cups) of noodles at most.

Similar to lasagne but not as tasty. I added fresh herbs after reading comments saying that it was bland. Water content wss too high in mine—likely because of the herbs but also because it calls for an entire onion with only a pound of meat. I’d rather spend the extra time and make lasagne.

We made this exactly as the recipe states.  My husband and 10 and 7 year olds loved it.  I, along with my 5 year old, liked it, but wasn't blown away by it.  I may try adding some more garlic next time.  We will make it again for sure.

Excellent recipe.  My family liked it a lot.  I didn’t have egg noodles so I used penne pasta otherwise I made it exactly like the recipe.  It was easy to make and tasty.  I will definitely be making it this again.

Very easy recipe with a good “comfort food” feel to it. I didn’t change a thing. Made it for Mom who doesn’t like a lot of spice, but would add more for my husband & me... perhaps use Rotel.  Made a huge dish, big enough for company.

I really enjoyed this. Next time I would add a can of chopped tomatoes along with the tomato sauce. I did add more seasoning and also garlic to the turkey and onion. Seems like a lot of steps but it’s very quick to make. This is the first ground turkey turkey meal that I actually like!

I’ve made this a few times. It has good flavour but it’s pretty heavy. It’s a good Sunday night dinner though. Pretty easy to throw together.

I used semolina twisty noodles (625g) and doubled the cream cheese and milk.  The family loved it! I was hoping to have left-overs, but no luck there!  I served it with simple carrots sticks and red pepper strips.

Easy Peasy sort of recipe with plenty of leftovers.  Only issue I had was with the cream cheese & milk part of the recipe.  Seemed to be enough to thinly coat the noodles, but not enough to get much of a taste other than from the garlic.  

Doubling up that recipe would be better.

I used what I had on hand, which was dried parsley and sharp cheddar cheese rather than mozzarella.  Think I would like to try it with the suggested items next time.  Family said it was "okay".  I will try it at least one more time and take a look at any suggestions from others who have tried the recipe.

Combined cooked noodles, turkey sauce, and cheese mixture together in a large pot (like goulash) for a quick meal without baking. Family loved the flavor.

This was a very tasty meal. I made one alteration, instead of using ground turkey I used chopped up turkey leftover from Thanksgiving. It was easy to make and everyone enjoyed it.

We found this ok, but we won't be making it again. We're not too big on cream cheese, so that might have something to do with it. And we just didn't like the meat sauce. Maybe if we had used regular spaghetti sauce instead if making it...

I substituted an egg for the tomato sauce.  I also used dried herbs and left out the rosemary.  These had wonderful flavor and just the perfect amount of spice.

This was okay, but kind of bland. It needs a little something to spice it up (more than just the Italian seasoning). I added some sliced zucchini to make it more of a complete meal but I'm not sure if I'm going to make it again.

I used whole grain penne pasta instead of egg noodles, and added a layer of fresh spinach on bottom of pan and another layer between pasta and turkey mixture! Got the big thumbs up here at home

This is a fantastic recipie, you don't even realize you're eating ground turkey.  Only thing I changed was I did not have mozzarella cheese so I used shredded tex mex cheese, still tasted great.  Will make again.

This dish is OK - not great.  I probably won't make it again.  I did like the idea of adding cream cheese to the egg noodles.

Great recipe. Added a few mushrooms and the garlic while sautéing the turkey.   I didn't have quite 4 ounces of cream cheese so added a couple dollops of sour cream, Yum.   I used a package blend of 4 Italian cheeses  and topped  with a few diced olives.   Will be making again!

It was very good, recipe didn't call for salt and pepper which it needs.  Of course we added it to our plates, next time I'll double up the recipe so we can have leftovers.

This was disappointing.  Against my better judgment, I followed the directions and put the sauce on top of the noodles, instead of mixing it with the noodles.  It was bland, a bit dry, and nobody cared for it.  We ended up throwing the leftovers away.  What a shame.

This was pretty good!  I do have to agree with some posts that the cream cheese part is rather bland.  Perhaps sautéing the garlic first would help.  I will certainly make again.

This was a very tasty dish, similar to lasagne but lighter. I made it as directed, except I  used 1 tablespoon of Italian seasoning and some salt to the meat mixture because it tasted a little bland.

Delicious!  I made changes, based on reviews, but not many.  
I seasoned the turkey as I cooked it (with "onion, onion!" instead of a real onion, salt, garlic, & Italian seasoning).  I used the full 8oz of sour cream & a full jar of tomato sauce.  Oh!  And also cut up some fresh mushrooms and cooked with the meat/sauce mixture.
Note to self for next time I make this: I didn't measure any of the spices - seasoned to taste.
We loved this meal!  Even my 1-year-old ate it (including the turkey!)!  I'll make this again & again.
Thanks for the recipe!!

I only stock 28oz cans of tomato puree for my sauces so I blended up a small can of tomato paste and a 15oz can of diced tomatoes to make my own tomato sauce. That was the only change, if you can call it that, I made. Very tasty! Hubby said it was a keeper! I agree with another reviewer that using Philadelphia cooking cream would work great in place of the cream cheese/garlic part of the dish and would take less time and one less pot to clean but that's probably the only veering from the original recipe that I would try.

Great recipe.  I didn't use any mozzarella cheese. I thought the cream cheese was plenty rich & was a nice balance of fat, carbs & protein. The recipe lacks vegetables so I also added 2 cans of diced tomatoes & mushrooms. Next time I'll try frozen spinach. I cooked the whole bag of noodles (you can use any noodles you want) & we had a lot of leftovers.  Just have a glass of milk with dinner & add some veggies and this is a delicious balanced meal!

This meal was very good tasting. Honestly I wish I could give it 3 1/2 stars because while I did like it, it wasn't anything amazing. The issue, I think, is the lack of cheese. I will make it again however and boost the amount of cheese going into the sauce. Overall, a good dish but just missed a little something.

I didn't find that this dish had flavor.  It was plain and I would suggest adding onion soup mix to the meat or a ranch packet because it was too bland for my taste.

I used spaghetti sauce instead of tom. and It seasoning;  ricotta instead of cream cheese with milk; and romano instead of mozzarella.
I also added some fresh mushrooms to the meat mixture just before adding it to the dish.

Did my own interpretation of this. Used spaghetti sauce, cream cheese, mozzarella cheese, and ground turkey as the sauce. Made that in one pan and boiled the egg noodles and just poured sauce over.  - I have a very picky two year old and five year old that both went back for seconds!

Four pans to clean but worth it. Easy to make, the whole family loved it. Followed the recipe and enjoyed it, but will probably add diced tomato next time. Delicious!

Easy enough for a delicious and quick weeknight dinner.  Could use more seasonings the next time, but it's not a deal breaker. This was definitely enjoyed by all in the house and they requested I add this to the dinner rotation!

Love, so yummy. I did double the tomato sauce and seasoned the meat to my liking with pepper and tapatio and more herbs, and truffle oil in the pan. I think when repeating the meal I would double the cream cheese sauce medley section, because it could always be creamier. Also I just sprinkled mozzarella on top until the whole thing was covered (never a bad thing)!

This was good, but I thought it could have used more italian seasoning and garlic.  I used a jar of pasta sauce.  I think the 15 ounces of tomato sauce would not have been enough liquid.  Next time I think I will try adding diced tomatoes, an extra clove of garlic and more italian seasoning.

I will definitely do this again as it has good flavor and the creamy sauce in the noodles with the tomato and ground turkey on top gives it dimension.

Awesome dish! Needed a quick dinner, and this was it. Added a few extra spices and extra cheese. Also added some frozen mixed veggies to the meat mixture for something different. It turned out great. Hubby had 2 big bowls and plenty of leftovers.

Made the recipe as-is.  My kids (boys 5 and 9) loved it.  My 9 year old took left-overs to school for lunch every day until it was gone.  I agree with others that it's not a riot of flavors, BUT sometimes simple is what you need.  Super easy to make, and I will be adding to rotation knowing even my fussy 5 year old will ask for seconds.

I tried this recipe. My husband and mom loved this one. My daughter thought though the noodles were a little dry. Well I had more noodles and meat that the recipe called for. So next time I will adjust the cream cheese sauce. But I loved it also. Will be making that a lot more often!

Good enough that I'll make it again.  Not so great that I'll rave about it to others.  It IS a good dish for kids - mine can be pretty picky and both cleaned their plates.  Nice to have in the menu stash for an easy dinner I know they'll eat, doesn't take a lot of time and typically have pretty much everything on hand to make it in a pinch.  Thanks!

My son (age 6) LOVED LOVED LOVED this. I used two cloves of garlic in the noodles.  I didn't have tomato sauce, so I used undrained tomatoes.  Also, I only had cheddar cheese.  It was really good, but it needed salt.  Seems like this would be easily adaptable to Mexican style, or a stroganoff (beef and mushroom instead of turkey and tomato).  Can hardly wait to try!

I wanted to do something with my ground turkey and cream cheese and I found this recipe.  I used no salt tomato sauce but I added salt to the ground chicken, and the mixture and the noddles.   I also combined the mixture and the ground turkey and backed it liked that. My very very picky daugher loved it she said this is very good you should make this again.  the normal response is this needs more favor.  This is a dish I would prepare ahead of time and freeze it or take this on vacation with me. 

oh yea I used greek cream cheese and greek yogurt.

So easy to make. I did add an additional teaspoon of Italian seasoning to the meat mixture along with some crushed red pepper flakes. I would make this again. *Update* This recipes is a comfort food that the family loves in the fall. I had some Johnsonville® All Natural Mild Italian Sausage on hand and decided to substitute it for the ground turkey. I kept all of the other ingredients the same except for cutting back on the Italian seasoning to 1/2 teaspoon. Either way you make this, ground turkey or Italian sausage, this recipes is a winner.

Great dish!  Kids didn't even know it was Turkey!  I used Italian Seasoned Ground Turkey.  I also didn't have egg noodles so I used Ziti.  I will make this again!

Easy, tasty and cheesy! Loved the way everything blended together. At first, I thought it might be too bland--so I use Vodka Sause instead of tomato sauce and skipped out on the cream cheese. I also modifed the onion amount down to 1/2 onion and it was plenty for this pregnant mummy. Will definately use this recipe again.

So delicious I couldn't stop eating it! I substituted bowties for the egg noddles, which was a nice touch! My only concern was the thinckness of the cream cheese. Perhaps this could be substituted with something healthier and lighter.

I tried this last night. Some reviews were right. It was a little bland and dry so maybe I would add more milk. Over all it was good and easy to make and will try again with soem of the otehr suggestions on additions.

I followed the recipe as written, and I thought it was pretty bland. Weird, since you use a lot of fresh ingredients. I'm a picky eater but I tried it and didn't really care for it. My husband on the other hand thought it was good. He described it as "simple, but good". He ate his portion, mine and another. I felt that it got soupy once it was baked and I think that's where a lot of the flavor was lost. But at least it was something different!

This dish was surprisingly tasty!  My husband loved it.  Our family of 4 finished the whole dish and 2 of the eaters were under age 3.  You may want to double if you have a larger family.    We will make again.  If you're a tastefully simple person - you can make great use of their spice mixes with this dish.

We are eating it right now and it's really good, even the kids like it. I made one change, I didn't have any mozzarella cheese for the top so I used shredded mild cheddar.  Oh yeah, I didn't have any egg noodles so I used Angel Hair pasta and it worked just great.

This recipe tasted much better than expected.  I made slight changes due to what I had on hand.  I used whole wheat spaghetti noodles in place of wide egg noodles and reduced the amount to two cups; neufchatel cheese in place of cream cheese; doubled the amount of sauce using chunky Ragu; added a diced portabella mushroom and a hint more garlic with a sprinkle of pepper.  I replaced the 1/4 cup of mozzarella cheese with hard grated parmesan cheese for added flavor.  I eliminated the Italian seasoning as there was none in the cupboard and didn't miss it.  The result was a very tasty dish that the family enjoyed. 
I will definitely make this again. 
Cooking again

Totally tasty recipe for left-over turkey. I thought it was just a pinch dry on the bottom half. Next time I will increase the cream cheese/milk coating for the noodles. Will definitely make again.

This was very quick to put together and had a great taste!  My family all likes spice so I added some red pepper flakes and it hit the spot.  I am making up another batch to freeze in oven safe containers for those nights when nobody has time to cook.

Yumm!  I used a can of Recipe Starters Fire-Roasted Tomato since I didn't have tomato sauce.  We all thought this dish was great.  Only 4 people...no left overs.  I think that says it all. :)
