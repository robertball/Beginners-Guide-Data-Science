My only change was to bake them longer than the 5 minutes in the recipe.... I think they need 10-15 minutes in the oven, turned once

I used real butter in place of margerine, and onion powder in place of onion soup mix.  This is a twist on a classic buffalo wing recipe.  The basil is necessary!

Zero changes!   Personally, I don't eat hot wings but some in this family unit do.  Based on their reaction, I would say this one is an absolute winner.  I made no changes and the recipe is exceptionally simple.  The other ones that I saved and tried have now been given the heave ho and this is the only hot wing recipe that will stay put.

Made these twice in one week... NBA playoffs!  They are cheap, easy and delicious!!  I did not vary the recipe at all- no need to!  These are my new favorite wings, and I will continue to make them for future parties, sporting events and gatherings.

Finally found a sure-fire way to make wings. Baking at the end glazes the wings nicely. I'm going to finish them quickly on the grill next time for a little char. Great recipe!

Amazing recipe!  My husband has declared himself WING KING and he just named these wings as the best he's ever had!  I used real butter instead of margarine. That's the only change I made. They were gone within minutes!

I used butter instead of margarine and garlic from a jar, but otherwise followed the recipe. The flavor mix of this combination of spices was great, and I liked it better than the typical spicy buffalo wings we get all the time here in upstate NY.

Awesome recipe I only used 3 cloves of garlic, and lime instead of lemon juice. They turned out great the cooking time in my fryer is 12 minutes at 350 degrees spot on. With 3 cloves of garlic it was still a lil strong for my taste Iâ€™ll try 1 next time, but hands down a awesome recipe!

A better title for these wings might be "Garlic Wings" because they were VERY garlicky. If you want to make Garlic Wings, use this recipe as written and you won't be disappointed. I might skip the onion soup mix and use some onion powder next time, as I thought it the wings were a bit over-spiced.

these are fantastic!! I made them for my husband and asked him what he thought. He said they were the best chicken wings he ever had. I told him that happened to be the name of the recipe, how funny.

This recipe was awesome! My husband and daughter were raving over how wonderful and crispy these were! I did add real butter instead of margarine. Thank you for sharing!! :)
