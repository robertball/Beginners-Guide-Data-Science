This definitely is a "Fabulous Spinach Salad"! I doesn't take a lot of ingredients to put together and it looks great on the plate so its very pleasing to the eye. I used a red onion, very thinly sliced into rings (not a lot) along with baby portabella mushrooms. It needed a little "something", so I added some crumbled bacon and shredded cheese. The dressing was light, refreshing and didn't overpower the ingredients. I topped it off with a bit of cracked black pepper - YUM!

My husband made this the other night for dinner (in fact, our entire meal was made from allrecipes.com recipes!).  I especially liked the dressing as it's not too tart.  He used the bagged spinach, which saved a bit of prep time.  He added jarred bacon bits, though I'd have used real bacon, and it only enhanced the delicious flavor of this salad.  I had the leftovers with ranch dressing and that was just as yummy.

This was excellent!  I changed the proportions some, for instance the only onion I added was some chopped green onion scattered on top.  I also added some cucumber and avocado slices.  I didn't expect to like the dressing but gave it a try-- my husband and I BOTH loved it!  For a really nice presentation, lay the spinach on plates, put the tomatoes on top, and arrange each topping (eggs, mushrooms, avocado, cucumber slices, etc) in its own pile around the edge of each plate.  Sprinkle onions on top.  I will definitely be making this again.  Thank you Uleta!

Wow! This was really delicious.  I didn't use the eggs (didn't have any made and was in a hurry) and I added a little bit of crumbled bacon.  My 16 yr old son, who I usually have to nag to eat his vegetables  had 4 helpings!!!  This will definitely become a staple at our house.

I appreciated the light, simple dressing and the colorful and nutritious ingredients.  Beautiful.  (But some crumbled bacon would have made this even better!)

This was great!  I added 1/2 onion and will add less next time as we prefer less onion.  I also added feta cheese.  This is definitely a keeper!

This salad needs more and still will not compete with the meal; perhaps, ham or pine nuts.

The combination of ingredients is very tasty and easy to put together, but the dressing is extremely bland.

Delicious and easy to make. I added black olives, bell peppers and black beans with a vinaigrette dressing because I had them on hand.

I had gotten a good deal on baby spinach at the farmer's market so to this was perfect to use up some of it.  I made it for a side to go with grilled steaks.  Very good.  Hubby kept commenting that it really hit the spot.  I'll make it again for sure!

I use White Wine Vinegar instead of Rice Vinegar, also since I didn't have mushrooms I used sweet red pepper. Delicious!

This salad had no taste (the only change was adding chicken). The dressing needs to be more flavorful or other ingredients need to be added. Very disappointed.
