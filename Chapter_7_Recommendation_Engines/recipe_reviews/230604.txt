One of my favorite smoothies--one packet of Splenda is plenty sweet for me, especially if my bananas are really ripe. I like to add a touch of vanilla extract and a pinch each of ground cinnamon and nutmeg.

I seriously believe, there must be a misprint on this recipe! I just can't imagine using 5 packets of a non sugar sweetener. I made a 1/2 recipe and used a sliced frozen banana as it was what I had. I normally wouldn't put anymore than 1/2 packet of Truvia in something like this I upped it up to one packet in-case it really should be this sweet. However, I will stick to what I normally do next time. I had similar drinks from Allrecipes. Bananas and milk is always a good combination. I tried another one with cinnamon and that was tasty too.

This is a good base recipe to tweak to one's choosing. You could use frozen bananas and change the type and amount of sweetener. One packet of Splenda was plenty for me.

The 5 sugar substitute packets really ruin this for me. I suppose you might need that many if you have green bananas. I use very ripe bananas, and no sweetner is needed at all. As another reviewer stated, frozen bananas are great in this too and give it more of a smoothie texture.

Oh my gosh, this was SO good. I added a spoonful of peanut butter for an extra protein boost and a dash of cinnamon. Next time I'm going to cut the amount of packets of sweetner to about 2, which will be just as good. Try this recipe, it's delicious.

I used 2 bananas and raw cane sugar.  I've even made it with vanilla protein/nutritional shake powder.  Absolutely delicious!  Thank you for this recipe!  I love it!
Update 10/29/15: I've made this smoothie a gazillion times now. I now use 2 fresh ripe or frozen bananas, milk, vanilla yogurt and/or vanilla protein powder. No need for sugar. It's absolutely delicious!

Love it I have been drinking this  all my life. First of all I don’t add sugar only banana, milk, a dash or two of cinnamon and a bit of vanilla in it. It’s really good and sweet enough without the sugar.

I didn't use any sweetener, let along 5 pkts of it.  Just the banana and the milk was good enough on its own

I make this with only ONE packet Splenda. Sometimes I add pb, or a Tbsp of oats, or cinnamon, or dark choc chips! Such an easy quick healthy snack!!

Substituted Vanilla  Bean Ice Cream for the milk, no sweeteners were added.  Used one very ripe banana and a frozen chocolate covered frozen banana.  SO good!

Delicious!!! I haven't made many smoothies, believe or not! Now that I see how easy and delicious they can be I will be experimenting a lot. I am pleased it fits almost any weight loss program, Lord knows most of us are trying to lose weight. I thought 5 packs!! no way. I used 2 frozen bananas and 4 packs but I thing 2 or 3 might do it.

I used Agave instead of sweet and low/Splenda, and added two strawberry Actvia. It was delicious! Healthy not to mention I wasnt hungry for hours.
