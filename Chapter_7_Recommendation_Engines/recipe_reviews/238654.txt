I thought it was an interesting combination and the result was excellent. Brought it at the office and it was gobbled up in no time!
My tip: Don't mix the chocolate chips in the cookie dough. Spread the dough into the 9 x 13 dish with a metal spatula, THEN sprinkle the chocolate chips on top of it and press them with the spatula - much easier to do.
This is definitely joining my stack of favorite recipes!

It was very good, but I think it could've been better. This is what I'll do when I'll make it again: 1) Use only 1 egg in the brownie batter. Two eggs makes it too cakey. 2) I made the recipes exactly as directed, but in reverse. I put the brownie layer on the bottom and dropped little spoonfuls of the cookie dough all over the top until it was covered. I think this works much better because it removes the spreading problems referred to by other reviewers, it's easier to tell when it's done because you can judge the color of the cookie layer, and it just looks prettier in my opinion! I had to bake it for 30 minutes. The cookie layer was dark tan  when it was done, almost brown.

EXCELLENT RECIPE!  Not overly sweet, either....I've seen some recipes that I know would just be too sweet (seriously, it is a brownie on top of a cookie!) but this recipe has a good balance of sugars. My two "issues:" 1.) the cookie dough layer is VERY DIFFICULT to spread over the bottom of a 13 by 9 inch pan. It's like this recipe needed just a little more "dough." 2.)  You seriously have to let this recipe cool completely...like maybe even put it in the fridge (I did) before trying to cut it.  The bottom cookie layer is definitely softer, so it needs to be cooled completely before cutting otherwise it is a big mess.  So...just don't think you can make this and eat it soon after!

These are very yummy. Rich :) Based on what the other reviews said about not having enough cookie dough, I increased the recipe by half and I had a perfect amount of cookie dough to cover the 9x13 pan. I could have left the brownie recipe as is but it made a nice thick treat! I used parchment paper instead of greasing the pan, edges overhung the pan so I was able to lift it out prior to cutting. It took about 45 to bake in my oven. I will make it again!

I halved this recipe and baked it in a 9x9 pan, 25 minutes was perfect in my oven. My son took this to a friend's house, I liked that it used pantry ingredients and came together fast. I think I would try a chocolate glaze next time to dress it up a bit.

Very good, yummy recipe.  I'm not sure why, but this took about 40 minutes to finish baking rather than the time specified.

I've made a similar recipe for years, and everyone raves about it.  I used a boxed brownie mix for the top layer; however, this brownie recipe is much much better!  I always reduce sugar in recipes (reduced from 1/4 c to just over 1/8 c white sugar for cookie layer and from 1 c to 3/4 c in brownie layer).  Only used 1 egg in brownie layer for a fudgier texture.  Found the cookie layer difficult to cover bottom of 13x9 pan, so 2nd time I made recipe I used 11x7 pan.  I'll also try to increase the cookie layer by 50% next time to fit the 13x9, since more of these would be appreciated in my house!!!!
Great recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was exactly what I was looking for. Didn't change anything except holding off on mixing the chips which was recommended by another reviewer. It was a bit difficult to spread the cookie dough in the pan so I suggest using your hands with plastic wrap to press dough into place then put the chips on top and push into the dough. Used 13x9 pan, perfect!

This is a 5-star recipe alright but it took forever to cook through. At leasat 40 minutes before the cookie part looked reasonably cooked.   I think I'd be inclined to pre-bake the cookie layer 10-15 minutes before adding the brownie layer next time.  I followed the recipe exactly, except for substituting half the sugar with a sugar substitute in the brownie layer.  These Brookies are incredibly rich.

Have this recipe in the oven, and it is baking over the sides of the jelly-roll pan(13 1/2  x 15) and burning on the bottom of the oven .

My daughter wanted an ice cream cake with cookies and brownies in it for her birthday cake.  This recipe worked out perfect!  I split the batch into two 9” round pans.  I froze softened vanilla ice cream in a third pan.  After a couple of hours I flipped the ice cream onto one 9” brookie and then flipped the second brookie on top of the ice cream.  It was like a large ice cream sandwich and then used icing to write on the top.  She and her friends were so excited!  Thanks for the recipe!  I scored major “Mom” points!

Yum! What an innovative and delicious combo of two classics. I needed to bake mine much longer than 25 minutes, though the edges were more than crisp by that point. I covered the edges in foil after about 25 minutes because the center was still liquid-y and had a long way to go. Next time, I'll add about 1/4 oil to the brownie mixture to increase the gooey factor. I'll also place a pan of water under the dish as it bakes. I've found this makes for an evenly moist loaf of bread so I might as well try it for the brookies, too! Thanks for such a tasty sweet recipe!

we loved it: it's easy and turns out amazing. The bars are well defined, no sloppy cuts but precise squares packed with the goodness of brownies and cookies. It took longer than stated to cook, about 40 mins. Also, don't know if it's a change Worth mentioning, but I spread the cookie batter and then I realised I had forgotten the chocolate. So I just dumped it on top of the batter; and not chocolate drops at that, but whole squares. My kids enjoyed it so very much, and it keeps relatively well.

It was very good! Delicious and the chocolate lovers in my house loved it! The only thing is the cookie dough is very difficult to spread, and there doesn't seem to be enough of it to cover the bottom in a good layer. As for the cooking time, my oven needed 35 minutes. But it was overall very good and I'll make it again!

I made these yesterday. This is the first time I've baked something homemade since I was a kid. It was a great experience. The house smelled wonderful. The recipe came together in the oven in 25 mins as stated. I did modify it a bit. In the cookie mixture I added coconut. And in the brownie mixture I added chopped pecans. Really nice combination. Tasted great! The consistency of the cookie and brownie together was more cake like I thought, rather than tasting like a traditional cookie or brownie. Instead of using regular White American sugar as the recipe called for, I used British Organic Caster sugar. A baking sugar the British use. It wasn't as sweet as the American white sugar. It was my first time using this type of sugar. And instead of light brown sugar, I used what I have and added dark brown sugar. I cut the recipe in half and used a 9x9 pan. I used Macadamia Nut oil to grease my pan. I have Wilton professional non stick pans, so no problem. If you want true non stick issues to happen when baking, use Wilton Professional baking pans.  You never have to worry about your food sticking again and clean up is a breeze! Just make sure you use non scratching devices with the pans and you'll have them forever! I spread the dough for the cookies and the brownies very thin in the pan to cover everything.  At first I thought I didn't have enough dough but you must spread it thin! It will work out. And when you bake it, everything collects and rises. it was good!

These are simply amazing. In future I'll half again the cookie dough layer for a 9x13 (doesn't quite need doubled but is just about 6 tbsp shy of filling the pan bottom properly as written) but leave the brownie part the same and these will be even more amazing. Mine baked closer to 35 minutes - I started sticking them at 21 mins then resetting 3 more mins at a time til the brownie layer was perfect. I had to make a crust shield out of tinfoil - tear off a 9x13 sized piece, fold in half longways, then use scissors to cut out a rectangular wedge. Unfold and drape over the pan to give the middle time to bake without overtaking the edges. This is a definite keeper, thanks for sharing!

What a great idea!!  Brownies and chocolate chip cookies are our favorite desserts. When I saw this recipe, I just had to make it.  The brookies were moist and not overly sweet.  My husband and nephews loved them as did I! Thank you!!

Followed recipe as stated. Had an issue spreading cookie dough but used parchment paper on top and used my hand to spread across the pan. Much easier than trying to use a spatula and no stickiness. 
First time making this recipe. Family enjoyed it very much. I'm not much of a sweet eater. Also it did take longer than specified to cook. About 40 min.

SO GOOD. EASY FAST  Really is both a cookie and brownie.
Crisp cookie bottom and chewy brownie top.  Made exactly except sprinkling the chocolate chips on top of cookie batter.
That is easy. I did not double batter and found it to be plenty and easy to spread.. I will make again.

I decided to do this for a meeting, so I was in hurry and afraid wont be able to finish on time as it requires to actually do 2 recipes, but it took only 1.15 h, it was a big hit .. for the first time someone do this combination in my country or maybe in the region .. I was glad for receiving it. I only reduced the salt in the cookies to half as I've never added this amount for cookies. thanks for sharing

Great concept! I found there was a bit of a contrast between the sweetness of the cookie and the slight bitterness of the chocolate in the brownie- a good thing!!

I'm very interested in trying a gluten-free version of this recipe, so anyone out there who's tried it, please contact me at clayton01746@yahoo.com.

I might make it again. It needs more cookie batter. Do a 1 to 1.5 ratio of the brownie to the cookie batter. There was too much brownie. I tried to bake it for 35 minutes and it burnt. When the toothpick comes out clean TAKE IT OUT! 20-25 minutes would be best like the recipe says.

This is by far one of the best dessert recipes I’ve ever baked. I made it exactly as instructed and ran into no issues having enough cookie dough to cover the 9 x 13 pan. Since the cookie dough was wetter than most recipes it spread quite easily. I would recommend whipping up the butter and sugar until it’s extremely fluffy to help with the spreading problem. The balance of brownie to cookie was perfect and not overly sweet. I usually tinker with recipes the second go round but I wouldn’t change a thing with this one. Excellent to take to work or a party. I did end up having to bake mine for 30 minutes instead of the suggested time. I originally made these for my husband to take to work but they were so delicious they never made it out of the house!

I made these once, & they were a lot of work! Now I make awesome 'brownie' cookies like this....... 1 box fudge brownie mix, 1/2 cup A/P flour, 2 lg. eggs, 5 Tbsp.veg. oil, 1 Tbsp.water, 1/2 cup mini ch. chips & a handful of chopped pecans.  Mix well, drop in heaping tsp's full on cookie sheet (use parch.paper) & bake at 350F for 8-10 min.  Cool on pan for a couple minutes then on a rack.  Wonderful, fudgy cookies!! & so easy!  Great for a 'chocolate fix'. *dough will be 'sticky'!!

I nixed the extra egg in the brownie mix...it definitely made a difference. Also, because I was making it for my coworkers, I put them in mini cupcake holders instead to stretch the recipe for more people. I placed 2 little chocolate chips in each of them. They were a hit in the office!

My nine-yr old son made these this afternoon.  We followed the recipe to the letter.  We did bake them about 10 minutes longer....this to be expected because all ovens are different.  Wow!!!!  We loved them!  The cookie layer was nice and thick to support the brownie; the brownie was moist and flavorful.  This is a keeper!

Very good treat.  I will make it again, with the following change.  I would double the cookie dough part as it was difficult to spread as is.  Also,  for those baking this for the first time, watch the time carefully.  It took longer than anticipated.
  I did follow another's suggestion to drop chips in and press them down into dough.  I would do that again.
  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I love this recipe! It's perfect every time. I've made it many times in both a 9x13 (whole recipe) and an 8x8 (half recipe, using half of a beaten egg in cookie). In both pans I needed to up the baking time to at least 40 minutes.
It's a great pantry staple recipe! Comes together quickly, and tastes great both warm and cool. I do prefer these completely cooled off or the next day. The cookie isn't as gooey and has a cakey texture compared to the fudgy brownie.

These are good..a bit on the cakey side opposed to the cookie/brownie side. I baked mine in an 8X8 pan keeping the full amount as i wanted thick pieces. I used all cocount sugar instead of the white and brown and used only 1/2 cup in both the cookie and brownie part. I found that to be plenty sweet enough. While i was preparing the brownie mix i stuck the cookie mix in the oven for 5 minutes and then poured brownie mix over top and continued to cook for another 35 . I had no problems spreading the cookie dough..i just wet my hands a bit and pressed down, it was super simple. Although this is definitely not part of my clean eating diet i did sneak a taste to review. I will be taking the rest over to my neighbours tonight. My only suggestion would be to not add all the sugar unless you enjoy super sweet. These would be cute baked in mini cupcake pans.

Quirky recipe title... caught my attention.  I had to try and we are really glad I did.  The recipe was easy to follow, but I did take 1 1/2 times the cookie layer to make the bottom section easy to spread.  It  did take 40 minutes to bake, but turned out deliciously yummy.  Will make again.

It took about 10-15 minutes longer then the recipe said too, I cooked it in a 8 by 8 inch pan. It turned out great though and tastes awesome. If you want to make a chocolate chip brownie you should use this recipe!!!!

OMG, so GOOD! Allthough, it took 40 minutes to bake, not 20. And the chocolate chip batter is supposed to be that thick (just an fyi, I thought I messed it up, but it all turned out correctly)

I made this recipe and divided the mixtures in half then cooked it in 2 slice tins.  It made the perfect thickness!  Once cooled, I cut it into triangles and dusted them with sifted icing sugar...looked like Christmas ;)  .  I took it with us for dessert on a public holiday outing and served it with Bulla Dollop Cream and fresh whole strawberries, YUMMO!  The best bit is that it is not at all too sweet as you would expect it to be from its looks.  Thanks for sharing this beautiful recipe, I had thumbs up and positive comments from the family members that I shared it with!!

I followed others by making 1 and 1/2 cookie batter (2 eggs) and used only one egg in brownies. Baked about 30 minutes. 
My husband liked a lot.

When my dad warmed up the first time in the oven, he did a total of 33 minutes. When I brought them into my orcheatra rehearsal last week, most people said that it was burnt on the bottom. So, when me and my dad had our second try at it, the brownie part wasn't all that runny and it was a better success. It actually tastes like a brownie and a cookie at the same time. And he even warmed it up for 25 minutes too!

I substituted all the sugar with brown cane sugar. It was still delicious but they seemed a bit dry and dense. It could be a simple baker's error.

This is AMAZINGLY GOOD! The only change I made was I used dark chocolate chips instead of milk chocolate, and instead of whisking the dry ingredients together I sifted them. I did have to cut these while they were really hot so my husband could take some to work. They still cut just fine and are superb nice and warm. I am most assuredly making these again!

This is a delicious recipe. However, the next time I make it I will make the cookie portion  a recipe and a half. The recipe as written is VERY skimpy for the bottom and hard to spread. Also, I needed to bake 40 minutes before the toothpick came out clean. At 25 minutes it was still in liquid form.

Super easy to whip together.   I took the advice of several others and pressed the cookie dough into the pan first, then added the chocolate chips.  I used organic cane sugar, it's less refined and still has some of the molasses in it.  I also used Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa, made the brownies a little richer. I used an 11x7 pan, it took about 40 minutes to bake.  I will definitely be making these again!

Delicious! When I saw this recipe I knew I had to make it. It's a brownie AND a cookie. How could I refuse? It took a while to finish baking. Not 25 minutes. But it was definitely worth it. I will absolutely make it again. And even though the cookie dough doesn't seem like a lot it rises well. Just letting you know ;). Because I was worried about the amount of it. You won't be disappointed if you follow the recipe! :D

I used part grated chocolate and part cocoa powder in the brownies; it does taste wonderful, but is less firm than brownies normally are. 
I'm going to try baking the cookie layer for 5 minutes before adding the brownie layer to firm up that layer.

PERFECT portions of both brownie and cookie layers for a 9x13 pan. I accidentally added a full tsp of salt to the brownie batter but I would gladly make the mistake again as it offsets the sweetness! Also used milk chocolate chips in the cookie layer, baked for 25 mins and it cooked just until done. quick and easy!

Really did love this recipe! 

I did substitute Crisco buttered flavored shortening for the butter (my late mother-in-law used it in her chocolate chip cookie recipe!)  

Will definitely be adding this recipe to my cooking file!

These are a family favorite! They are rich, so I cut them into smal squares and perfect for chocolate cravings!  I also find that these are best if you once and a half the cookie dough recipe, but keep the ingredients the same for the brownie layer. I bake these for 28 minutes and then turn the oven down to 325 degrees and bake for 7-10 minutes longer.

Great idea Melanie. I made this recipe and it was a big hit. Goes together easy in two steps. I used walnuts instead of chocolate chips for the bottom b/c I don't care for chocolate chips. Turned out great! Thank you for sharing it.

Made the brookies with my 9 yr old niece and it came out great.  It was sweet but not as tooth shattering as I thought it might be.  We didn't have trouble with spreading the cookie layer out.  I think the trick is to make sure your cream the butter and sugar well.  Thanks for the recipe, Melanie B!

This was perfect! Just what a snowy day called for, but definitely an anytime treat! Made this with my 12 yr old daughter.  WE used boxed brownies and the cookie recipe attached. Added an extra egg to the boxed brownies to make  them less dense. Served with vanilla ice cream to increase the sinfulness!This treat was a winner!

Absolutely delicious--you get the fudge brownie on top and the Toll House bar-style cookie on the bottom. You can't go wrong. 

I doubled the recipes, so mine did take longer to bake, but I didn't worry too much about knife sticking and whatnot--after about ten extra minutes, I turned off the oven and let the cookies sit inside for a bit before removing them to the cooling rack. The brownie layer was nice and fudgy. 

Incidentally, I think I overbeat the brownie batter with my Kitchen Aid--but the result was this amazing, hard "coating" on top that looked, felt, and tasted like chocolate fortune cookie. As accidents go, I'll take it.

I changed it a little, and instead of putting the chocolate chip cookie on the bottom, I spread it out like pie dough on the pan, then added the brownie layer into it. Even though making the brownie layer one time was not enough(I had to make the brownie layer two times to have enough mixture), it turned out great and tastes amazing.

I followed the recipe to the T, and I didnt have enough cookie batter to cover even a 9 x 9 pan.

It isnt explained how the cookie layer should be layed out.  Overall I'm not impressed I'll try again, taste was mediocre and cook time was longer. I'll retry and adjust from my next attempt

Can use store-bought cookie dough and your own brownie recipe. Layer in reverse. Put the brownie layer on the bottom and drop little spoonfuls of the cookie dough all over the top until covered. Works much better because it removes the spreading problems referred to by other reviewers, it's easier to tell when it's done because you can judge the color of the cookie layer, and it just looks prettier in my opinion! I had to bake it for 30 minutes. The cookie layer was dark tan when it was done, almost brown.

Family loved it!  Rather than white flour in bottom layer substituted 1 c whole wheat and 1/4 c garbanzo bean flour.  In brownie layer substituted white flour with 1/4 c almond meal and 1/4 c brown rice flour.  Also used 1/2 coconut oil for the butter in brownie layer.  Moist and delicious!

I made this for my family and everybody loved it! While making the cookie layer, I used only 1 bowl instead of combining the flour, salt, and baking soda separately. I had to bake this for about 45 minutes, and then it was a little dry. I would make this again, though.

The brownie layer turned out VERY sugary so I would definitely tone down the amount of sugar. It was so sugary, others didn't like it and I even thought it was hard to eat, and I have a huge sweet tooth!

I agree with the others that is the best brownie ever! I was a bit short on the cocoa powder so I dumped some extra chocolate chips on top. I always bake with whole wheat flour & brown sugar but it still turned out moist, rich & super yummy. Family wanted seconds :).Thank you so much for sharing this.

What a great idea and thanks for sharing.  Turned out great, I  used moreno pure cane sugar for both the white and the brown sugars.  Everything else the same. No problems. :)

Followed other suggestions and pressed the cookie dough down and put the chocolate chips on top instead of mixing them in the batter.  Also used a 8 X 12 pan and it was the perfect size. I otherwise followed exactly and my family loved them! Will make again.

These were really good!  As others have said, they take longer to bake than what is stated in the recipe. I baked them for 55 minutes at 350 degrees and they were done perfectly.  I used 2 tubes of refrigerator section Toll House cookie dough and cut them into slices for the bottom of the pan after reading reviews saying that the dough was hard to spread.  This made it easy.  I used a box brownie mix for the top.  They were quick and easy to prepare, and delicious!

I followed the recipe ingredients exactly but I cooked it in a 9" square pan.  I cooked it for 33 minutes and it was wonderful.  Not too sweet.  My granddaughter had made it the day before in a Pampered Chef 9" dish (stoneware) and it was much chewier than mine.  Next time I won't cook it longer than 30 minutes.  Flavour was fabulous.

This was a good recipe, but I personally, I will make my own version of this dessert before I make it again. I also as others had noted barely had enough cookie dough to cover my 9" x 13" baking dish, but the brownie mix filled in the empty or thin spots. I think I'd like to reverse this recipe and make the cookie the greater part of the bar and the brownie a thinner top layer. The bars were nicely moist and chewy like a brownie with a cookie crust., but it took 50 minutes to bake in my convection oven set at 350° F.

Wow!  Wow!  Wow!  I think I have to say that this is my new favorite dessert!  I actually saw these at my local grocery store and thought...what the heck is a brookie?  Well, after paying $5 for 4 tiny brookies, I thought...I could make these myself!  And sure enough, there was a recipe here on All Recipes.  I must say that I took the SUPER LAZY way out!  I bought a boxed brownie mix and a bagged chocolate chip cookie mix and took it from there!  They came out AMAZING!  Everyone in the family was in awe!    Next time, I will try to make them from scratch as directed in this recipe and I am sure they will come out even more incredible!

Halved the ingredients and baked for 25min. in a 9x9 pan. Came out perfect! I was a little bit worried that I didn't make enough cookie dough but it's ok if it doesn't fully cover the bottom.

Have made these many times and they are always a big hit. I usually have to bake longer than stated. Sometimes, I put a layer of peanut butter atop the chocolate chip cookie layer for an added touch.

This is a great combination of flavour, and very delicious.  I cooked it for 25 minutes, that was perfect. I did make a couple of changes- I added one tsp instead of two of vanilla and 1/2 a tsp of baking powder and salt on the brownie side. This recipe is a keeper!

My goodness these take forever to bake! I made these for a potluck. Thank goodness the start time got bumped back - these needed 40 minutes in the oven!! Started to burn on the edges while the middle remained gooey. I think I'll find a different recipe next time.

My family loves these! I put the brownie layer on the bottom and the cookie layer on top and this worked out perfectly. Also, I used one egg in the brownie like other reviewers suggested. Took 30 min to bake.

It was pretty good in the end, but i would suggest using a smaller dish size. although it may be a bit thicker, i couldn’t see the cookie in the end.

This was fantastic - brought these to a holiday party and they were gone in 15 minutes! I did a 1.5 ratio of the cookie recipe (per another review), but that was the only modification I made.

I made this as written but baked it in a 9x9. The brownie layer was really dry and crumbly. I’m assuming it was baked too long (my fault). Next time I’ll bake it in the 9x13 and see how it comes out.

So I made this....I did modify...one egg only in the brownie mix, to make them a little more fudgier...to spread the cookie dough a little easier, I sprayed a spatula with some pam so it wouldn’t stick. Perfect amount of ingredients. ( I also added some mint chocolate chips for the holidays) To make them easier to cut, I allowed time to cool and finished them off in the refrigerator to harden up a bit...cut perfectly.

I really liked them. I baked them for my friends and they were a hit. I put the cookie batter in the fridge while I made the brownies batter, therefore when I put the cookie layer down on the pan it was not sticky. It worked perfectly!

I’ve made this twice. Second time made a huge mistake but it tasted BETTER with my mistake. I mistakenly mixed the first ingredients for the brownie layer, but only up to the chocolate powder (I also melted 1/2 c of chocolate chips and added that). When the timer went off, the chocolate part was wet and I realized I completely forgot the flour and remaining brownie ingredients. Turned the oven down to 300 degrees and baked 15 minutes longer. Yum yum yum, my husband LOVED the mistake version better... and so do I!! Removes the cakey texture and more like a creamy soft chocolaty brownie on top. Mmmmm!!!

It turned out really good! I baked it for 40-45 minutes though, because even at the right temperature, it just wasn't cooked well enough. All my friends loved them when I brought them to school! These are one of my favorites.

Awesome. Made it in a 9 by 9, baked the cookie dough 5 minutes before adding brownie batter. Baked until toothpick came out clean. Love them!

I'm an experienced baker and have no idea how this recipe has so many good ratings. This recipe was horrible. Half way through the cooking time, I knew it wouldn't turn out, when the cookie layer was bubbling out the sides while the brownie layer sank. I should have trusted my gut when I saw one half cup of flour per layer. I thought this ratio of flour to wet ingredients looked off, and it is. In a huge way! It should be more like 1.5 or 2 cups of flour per layer! These turned out like a gloppy, inedible, sweet congealed goo in my pan. If I could give 0 stars, that would seem more appropriate.

I made these as a birthday gift to send to my sister, and they almost didn't make it out of the house. My husband, who cites as his favorite almost anything that comes from a box or a can, said twice within the first bite that these were insanely good, my daughter agreed with him, and the other couldn't say a word because she was too busy eating it. My only suggestion would be to bake it in a smaller size pan. Mine didn't have a clear separation between brownie/cookie, and if I hadn't told my family what they were, I'm not sure they would have realized it.

They recipe was succesful but I don't think it was a very good desert, the flavour from the cookie and brownie don't mesh well in my opionion. You don't really get a strong flavour from either one of them because they don't compliment eachother. Cool idea but I wouldn't make again. Would rather just make cookies or brownies

OMG!!  What a terrific, easy and delicious recipe!  I was trying to figure out what to bake for a Labor Day BBQ neighborhood party--I saw the latest issue and found this recipe.  Yes, the bottom layer is stiff (cookie dough usually is!) so just dust your fingers with a little flour and press it in with your hands.  Make sure to get to the corners and there IS enough to fit the pan.  In any case, everyone loved them and I have now saved this recipe for a future birthday event at work--I know they will love it too!!

Nice combo. I followed the advice of others and shouldn't have!! I increased the cooking time to 40-min (which is how long it took for a toothpick to come out clean) but when the brookies cooled they were dry and crumbly. I think cooking for the time stated by the recipe submitter (20-25 min) is accurate if you want a chewy bar (which I what I was hoping for). The toothpick doesn't need to come out clean with brownies or cookies - underbaking is the secret to chewiness!! I also omitted the salt and increased the chocolate chips in the cookie dough (1.5 cups, and used 1/2 semisweet, 1/2 milk chocolate). Baked in an 11x15 dish at 325 (convection). Will try again with the reduced cooking time and update this afterwards ;)

The brookies are delicious-I suppose- since they went to fast I didn't get even a crumb. My rating is regarding the measurements. WAY OFF. Totally inaccurate if you exceed the 20 serving setting.

Not the best brownie or chocolate chip cookies I have ever made, but they do work well together. Wished it was more a mabled than layered approach. Texture was more a brownie and the cookie taste takes a backseat for sure. Still, worth making and will keep this recipe handy in case I want a change.

This was super easy to make and was a hit with my in laws. I originally made it as the recipe instructs then followed another reviewers advice of spreading the cookie dough in the pan, then adding the chocolate chips. Personally, I liked the original recipe better. The chocolate chips are mixed into the dough that way instead of just sort of between the cookie and brownie layers. I do find the cookie dough slightly difficult to spread that way though so perhaps next time I will double the cookie dough to make it easier. It also took about 30-32 minutes to bake. Overall a great recipe!

This was a complete disaster.  The directions were confusing because in the ingredients it asks for 1 cup sugar but in the directions it says 1/4 cup. I didn't know which to follow. I'm very disappointed in how this turned out because the reviews looked good. Also the brownie batter sank into the cookie dough. This was so bizarre. I would be willing to try this again if the directions were more clear!!

when i made these it took about 45-50 minutes to Bake (i believe it is due to the oven as all ovens cook differently) and about 15-25 minutes to cool (without them being in the fridge). they turned out great for my first time baking an all day snack on my own with little to no help. though i may not be a pro cook or someone who is always cooking but i found out that if the chocolate chips are added to the top of the dough after the dough is spread in the pan they can't be tasted and the cookie part tastes like brownies (not a bad thing just not what i thought it would taste like) so i suggest you mix the chocolate chips into the dough before putting it in the pan (might be alittle harder to spread might not but it will taste a little better in my option.) also expect for the edges to possibly be a little crunchy they turned out that way for me (might not be the same with you when you try though). all-in-all this was a great treat and i plan to make it again sometime.

My son picked these to make and bring to school for a class project.  They were easy for kids to make and they were fantastic to eat.  For a little flair he added Hershey's Drops in between the layers.  OMG they were yummy.

They were delicious but pretty flat.  I'm thinking a slightly smaller pan would be easier to spread them out on.  Maybe my baking powder wasn't new enough but it hadn't expired.  If  I do use a smaller pan, they would need to cook a little longer.   I really like separate brownies and separate cookies better.

I will make this again, but will follow the advice of the reviewer who said make half again as much dough for the cookie part. it was hard to get it to spread over the bottom of the pan. but we all thought it was great!!

Made these during a recent snowstorm. They are delicious! Note: As others have mentioned, the bake time is off. I would say minimum is 30 minutes before checking with a toothpick. Others said 40, mine would've been burned at 40. Otherwise, don't change a thing about this recipe. Big hit with the family.

These came out great! I substituted the cocoa powder with a little less than a half cup of melted chocolate chips. The brownie was fudgy and awesome with a flaky sweet top. the cookie was perfectly crispy on the bottom. I will most likely use less chocolate chips in the cookie part next time.

This was a very easy to make recipe. I will definitely make this a lot. However I did have to bake it for 15 minutes extra before it was done. Also there isn't really a distinct cookie or brownie flavor it all just kinda blends together.

These were really greasy!!!!, I do a lot of baking and it just wasn't right. the pan size is totally wrong I did a 9x7 and they were still kind of thin I would say cut the butter back on both cookie and brownie but honestly I'm taking it off my favorites and just using my own cookie recipe and brownie recipe.

They were pretty good. I think I prefer cookies and brownies seperate though.  I would suggest giving it a try for yourself though.

I loved this idea! The first time I made it, the top became a real crust, and it wasn't to my liking, so the second time I baked it for less time and they were much fudgier. I also put a little more cocoa in the brownies because we're a chocolate loving house ! 
Also, for fun at Christmas, instead of chocolate chips in the cookies, I crushed up peppermint chocolates and mixed them in. It gave it a really festive minty kick! 
Love this recipe, will do it again and again.

Very rich. Followed directions but took advice to just add one egg only to brownie mix making it more gooey than cake-like. Was very good.

A little disappointed and here's why:
When I made the cookie layer to spread over the pan, it barely covered 1/2 the pan.  I decided I had to double it, which I didn't feel like doing but had no choice at this point.  Because I doubled the cookie layer, I decided to double the brownie layer.  The brownie layer would NOT cook and still tasted like batter.  I keep cooking in 5 minute increments.  I was late going to my Grandmother's, so I had to finish them there.  They tasted fine, but were a little dry.  These should have been amazing.  Unless I missed something, this was too much work without the reward.

These were ok. They turned out like regular brownies, except with a load of chocolate chips at the bottom. The batter mixed with the cookie dough and didn't stay in the 2 layers they were separated in. I am not making these again. It was a chocolate overload.

I have made a similar treat in the past using brownie mix, but this brownie tastes so much better. I've made it twice so far. First time I followed directions fully, but took the advice of a review and put the chips in after cookie batter was in pan. Second time I cut the sugar but now weeks later I can't remember where. I think I did 1/4 c brown sugar. I plan on experimenting with the goal of reducing the sugar but keeping the great taste.

Though I planned on using the easier method of a bagged version of each the cookie and brownie mixes and putting together, I thought I'd give this recipe a try.  It was good and everyone enjoyed.  We like things on the gooeyier side, but they didn't seem done, so I ended up baking for about 26 minutes.  They were still good, but I'll probably shoot for the shorter end of the time listed next time as they firmed up after taking them out.  I also opted to add the chocolate chips after spreading the bottom layer (it was a bit of a booger).  For time sake, I might still try to go the easy route and compare, but I will be hanging onto this recipe as well.

I've made it a dozen times now - the first time exactly as the recipe said, which was amazing. The second time onwards, I've always doubled the batch - because there's so much demand for it! The only change I make is to keep the eggs at 2 for the brownie part, so it doesn't get cakey. Many thanks for such a simple recipe that makes a star baker out of me!

I liked the idea of combining two classic desserts. I cut the amounts of sugar in half, and the brookies had the perfect level of sweetness. The cookie dough was definitely a bear to spread into the pan (perhaps refrigerating it for a little while would help?), and it did seem as if there wouldn't enough dough to cover the bottom.  It turned out to be a very thin layer, but after baking, the cookie part was the right thickness; I don't feel there's a need to increase that part of the recipe. The brownie part was cakey, so next time I'll either make it with one egg or use a different brownie recipe. My brookies were slightly overdone after 15 minutes, but then my oven runs hot.

It's a good recipe but the cooking time is wrong .  I baked mine for 45 mins.  If it still giggles then it should be longer.  My family loves these.

Made just like the instructions and it was fantastic! I did add the chips after spreading the cookie dough which was much easier. My kids loved it so much that my daughter wants it as her birthday dessert!

My grandkids love this recipe! And I make it from scratch as presented here, or you can use the frozen chocolate chip cookies instead, but her recipe is so easy that I preferred to do it from scratch! It never lasts more than a meal; that's how yummy it is!

This was the perfect recipe. Perfect portions and it tastes absolutely fantastic! The only thing I did different at the suggestion of another review on here was not mix the chocolate chips in the dough, I layered them between the cookie dough and brownie batter.

This did come out delicious, but my brownie ran into my cookie so I basically have chocolate chip brownies. I'm not saying that's a bad thing but they definitely aren't two different layers.

I halved this recipe, and also baked in a 9x9 pan, but mine came out cakey. It was like a chocolate cake, i still enjoyed it very much, it satisfied my sweet tooth. Can anyone tell me what i mightve done wrong for the texture to come out like a cake?

These were a little extra work, but worth the effort! The cookie part is a little more cakey than I prefer. It took about 40 minutes to bake.

i madr this exactly as instructed, except that i baked it for 45 min. still, the cookie part was undercooked and totally oily. perhaps that was due to the glass dish i used - i don't know, but either way a lot of effort was wasted. apart from the undercooked dough part, the taste was great.

It was ok.  It looks really neat and is more interesting than a regular bar cookie or brownie.  I think the cookie part could have been better, though.  Maybe I'm a purist, but I think I prefer each separately.

These were good. However, I wish I'd read a few more of the reviews before trying this.  The next time I make these, I will definitely increase the amount of cookie batter.  I may also try mini chocolate chips; the batter may spread easier.

I  I felt like my bottom layer browned too much; it was nowhere near as pale as the photo.  I also had to bake closer to 40 minutes, for them to test done.  I reduced the amount of sugar in the brownie layer, to about 3/4 - 7/8 cup.

I will definitely make again, but with modifications.

This recipe didn't turn out as I hoped, the brownie part was perfect but I think I might change the cookie dough recipe next time, it was too plain.

Made it exactly as written. It was perrrrrrrfect!!! I've made it 3 times in 1 week That's how awesome it is!
Took it to school the first time and it was gone in less than 5 mins. The second one was gobbled up by my 3 nieces,  my brother and sister in law. The third one was just for me ?? Love, love, love it! Observation: it's better the day after I baked it because when it's newly baked, it's kinda too soft to handle, but when you rest it overnight then it becomes manageable - somewhat chewie and creamy and just perfect.

Great idea so I followed the recipe exactly.  Unfortunately the cookie part of this recipe is cake-like which really killed it for me.   

I'll try the concept again using my favorite box brownie mix and my cookie dough recipe.

Heads up:  the description says the author used a jelly roll pan, but a jelly roll pan is actually one with very low sides, so do not use that since that's probably not what she meant to say and you'll end up with a mess.

Really good!!!  I followed the recipe except I substituted the flour for gluten free all purpose flour.  In a 9 x 13 pan, my baking time was more like 30 - 35 minutes.

I made these last night for my husband to take away for a weekend golf trip with the guys. I doubled the recipe but followed it exactly otherwise. They are fabulous!! I had to hide them from my husband so he wouldn't eat them before he leaves. I doubt they will make it uneaten during the 3 hour road trip.

Very good - but cooking time is WAY too short, took 45 to 50 minutes to complete in a glass 13 x 9 dish.

Not too sweet - tasted great!

This recipe is alright. I found that you couldn't taste the cookie much at all and neither the cookie recipe nor the brownie recipe was as good as it could be.

I have bought these and they put the brownie on the bottom and cookie on top - might give that a try.  Parchment paper works great for getting out of pan.

They were delightful.  I even gave my Pastor a plateful of the Brookies for his birthday!  I would definitely make them again.

Excellent chocolate dessert.  The brownie flavor dominates, but you can definitely taste the chocolate chip cookie flavor as well.  There is no way it will cook in 20 minutes, it was not done at 30 and was definitely done at 35 minutes.  34 minutes may be the best cooking time.  I followed the recipe exactly and other than the cooking time, don't change a thing.
