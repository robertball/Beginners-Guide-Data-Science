I decided to try this recipe because I happened to have cooked chicken 3 cups of leftover white sauce (same recipe but flavored with 2 chicken bouillon cubes) and a day-old loaf of french bread on hand all which needed to be used up. I was out of cheddar cheese though and used shredded parmesan instead. I ended up using about 6 cups of bread with about 5 tablespoons of butter and 1/2 cup parmesan cheese (I wanted more bread on top). It smelled wonderful baking and tasted just as good. I think the toasty topping really added a lot--I would definitely recommend french bread. My husband and kids thought it was good but the kids don't like peas so I'm not going to hold that against the recipe. Very palatable!

Fairly quick & easy all common ingredients could use a lil spicing up though. The flavours are simple and bland.

Very good! I only had 2 c. milk so I used 1/2 cup water and 1/2 cup mayonaisse to make up the called for 3 cups. I think this added just the right amount of "zing".

I really liked this recipe alot. My boyfriend did as well but he made a good suggestion. There is an awful lot of cream sauce and not much with it. So we thought if we made some egg noodles to add with it it would be delicious. I will try that next time. But the dish was declicious as is!

Very quick for me! I had frozen chicken I cooked last week ready frozen green beans(not pea fans around here) and frozen rolls from last week. I had everything ready in the time it took to preheat the oven. This casserole was AMAZINGLY yummy we all loved it!

This was good. My boyfriend didn't like the texture. Too soggy. But overall it wasn't bad.

Tried this tonight after reading through the directions I tweeked it a tad by using up some baguette slices I had toasted and frozen. I cubed them up after defrosting and I used frozen spinach (thawed/drained). I did add additional spices as other reviews suggested. I found the ratio of butter to flour far to thick and had to add more milk and butter and whisk for quite awhile to break down the flour I should've used equal amounts to start with as it still turned out very thick after cooking I am however glad I used "toasted" bread as it would've been very gummy and too mucky. All in all it was worth trying and next time I'll stick to my own method of cooking white sauce instead.

I halved the recipe and baked in a 9x9" pan. I used rosemary bread and added chopped onions to the cream sauce. I think without the rosemary and the onions it would have been very bland. DH really liked it but I wasn't a fan.

This was a great start but I think it would do well with some tinkering. I used WAY too little bread (4 slices) so next time I will double the amount to 8 slices (I was too lazy to shred and measure - my fault). This really had a LOT of peas and DH isn't a big fan of them so next time we're going to try 16 oz. of broccoli. Lastly I think next time I'll try making the roux with half milk and half chicken broth to boost the flavor a bit.

I didn't have canned chicken or cream of mushroom soup so I used chicken thighs cooked and then chopped and cream of chicken and herbs. Not the exact recipe but it was Super duper yummy!

Excellent! Follows the recipe as written. Recommend adding more cheese and perhaps diced pimentos for color. Love the toasted bread and cheese that bakes on top!

Despite looking pretty bland this is actually good stuff! I needed a "can sit for awhile" sort of recipe since everyone comes home at a different time tongiht and this worked perfectly. I LOVED that it calls for making a simple sauce rather than opening yet another can of "cream-of-something" soup. I did make a few tweaks like other reviewers.....I had to use a bit more bread since I think my pan was a bit larger and I added cheese to the layers and the top----I DO live in Wisconsin after all. Next time will definitely change the bread to croutons I think and perhaps add just a bit of onion powder to the sauce but otherwise this is a quick easy "most people will like it" sort of recipe that is perfect at my house!
