These are very close  to the original recipe.  The only thing I would do would use matzo meal instead of flour.  It really does make a big difference

Very excellent recipe! Worked wonderfully, turned out very tasty & crisp. Only thing I will say is I had to use a LOT more than 2 tablespoons of flour- though that could just be my preference. I was very pleased with how this turned out, they taste just like I remember them. :)

I thought theses were delicious.  I used a gluten free flour mix, but it took way more than two tbsp of flour to make the potatoes stick together.  Also, before adding the other ingredients, I rinsed the potatoes and onions in water and let drain, so some of the the starch was removed.   I used to see both my grandmothers do this.

This is the best latke recipe I've tried and it's the easiest too.  I took others' advice and used matzo meal, as I had some on hand, and just added it until I had the consistency I wanted.  I usually drain the potatoes and onions, but decided not to.  It left the mix really soupy, but I just grabbed a bunch of mix and squeezed the excess liquid out.  By keeping it all in the liquid, it actually kept the mixture from turning that ugly brown that it usually does.  Needless to say, I've found my new recipe that I will use from here on out!  My husband tasted and said they are the best I've ever made!

Way too much egg for the amount of potatoes,  I tried again using 1 egg and they turned out great.

Fantastic! My husband and I really enjoyed dinner tonight :) I altered the recipe to adjust to my flavor craving taste buds :) I used 2 cups total grated veggie--1.5 cups potato and half a cup of grated zucchini, only used two eggs, didn't bother to dry off the grated mix (added just a touch more flour instead), added a bit of nutmeg to the mix as well as some pepper and onion powder. Reduced the salt to 1 tsp. served with nonfat plain yogurt instead of sour cream as it was what I had in the fridge. I can highly recommend this dish!

EXCELLANT  I make this recipe with one tweak...
I do not drain my potatoes,  result: crisp, crispy thin patties, so crunchy & when eaten with catsup are ALMOST as good as served traditionally!

Sorry but we thought that these were bland.  If I make them again I would probably tweak them and them and add some parmesan or maybe some jalapeno.  Thanks for posting the recipe

I love this recipe! It always pleases a crowd, I usually make the recipe as is but on occasion I add shredded cheddar to it. It's amazing!

Great recipe!  They were easy to make, and turned out just like the latkes I used to eat as a kid. I did add extra flour though.

The pancakes ended up to be more of a hash brown patty.  I grated the potatoes and followed all other instructions.  Maybe I missed something? The recipe fell below my expectations.

Followed the directions but found these were tasteless. No flavor. Would use a different recipe next time.

I liked it and used more potatoes and only 2 eggs and 1/2 cup of flour and blended until proper consistency.  My family loved it

Added personalized seasonings, didn't catch on to the 1/2 inch if oil part until I had pan fried them normally. So some were a bit undone in the middle but still pretty good.

I think we could have gotten away with 2 eggs but yummy as is.   The last batch was more egg then potato because I didn't remix the batter for each pancake and the egg settled in the bottom of the bowl.
