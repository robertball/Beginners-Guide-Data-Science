I made the fajitas and I also made it into a bowl. The ro-tel adds so much flavor. It was really good

Followed the recipe,,,,,,with the exception of the chili powder and cumin (I used a package of McCormick fajita mix.....which is basically the same ingredients) and then we also added a little dash of sharp cheddar cheese to the tortilla (which I heated on the tortilla shells both to soften the tortilla shell and to melt the cheese) prior to adding a spoonful of the Fajita mix.....very easy & absolutely delicious!! Will def make again! :)

Wife said these were the best fajitas I've ever made.  I let the chicken, peppers and onions sit in the marinade in the fridge for several hours.  My, they were delicious!

This was fast and easy to make. And, it was delicious!  I did not have Ro Tel brand so I used regular diced tomatoes and added the minced jalapenos. Served with homemade guacamole and sour cream. Will make this again.

This was very good. I just cut the recipe in half because I didn't need a lot.  It was quick to make and very tasty.  I have shared this recipe with 2 friends already.

I made this tonight and added a little garlic. Didn't have Rotel so I used 1 jalapeno pepper and fresh tomatoe. It was really good.
