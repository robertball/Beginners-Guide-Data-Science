LOVE this recipe.  For the sake of my ears I omitted the chives (didn't want to hear little ones complaining there was green stuff in their crackers).  I also upped the garlic powder to 1/2 tsp and instead of the hot sauce I used 1/4 tsp cayenne powder which gave it a slight kick at the end, if you want some noticeable heat I'd use 1/2 tsp.  It is fantastic and will definitely make this again.  It turned out better than expected (I've tried a few of these types of recipes before and this one wins).  Next time I will add some whole wheat flour. **I rolled the mixture in some plastic wrap, just put a pile on the plastic and close the wrap so none will escape, then shape it into a log - don't be afraid so smush the mixture together, it needs to hold together well in the fridge.  When you slice it don't use a serated knife and don't saw the log, just slice straight down, some pieces may crumble but if you pack the mixture together well before you refridgerate it should be just fine.

Really good, and a great alternative to hydrogenated store-bought Cheez-its. I used fresh chives, chopped in the food pro, which was quick & easy, but a little slimy- made no difference in taste, though, so I'll do this again. I baked the first two rolls after refrigerating for 1 hour. I had to slice them thick but even then they kept crumbling apart. Make sure you squeeze the rolls tightly to compressed the mixture in the plastic wrap. I sprayed my sheet with Olive Oil, and flattened with my hand as others suggested. I spinkled them with coarsely ground sea salt just before baking. They weren't even completely cooled before most of them were gone, with my husband and kids around! What we did have leftover, he said were even better and more like store bought the next day, after the flavors settled. The next two rolls I sliced and baked after a couple days of refrigeration. With a sharp knife, this made the slicing 10x easier because the rolls were so much more firm, and I could slice them thinner, like 1/8" or less. And I'm sure I got more than 9 dozen. Thanks so much for this-- this was the first cracker recipe I tried, but I don't need to search any further!  :)

OMG....YUM! I'm taking these to a party later today and I must have eaten twenty of them already! Based on everyone elses reviews (and thank you btw), I used a lot more hot sauce than called for, added about a half tsp. of cayenne, in addition to the two cups of cheddarI threw in a half cup or so of parm and only used half of the chives. These are really amazing and I thank you Nikki!!

I recently went to a party where cheese crisps were served, they were so delicious I couldn't stop eating them, and had to have the recipe. I was hoping this was it, but it's not. The chives are too overpowering, and these don't have the spicy kick the ones at the party had. I even doubled the hot sauce and garlic to suit our tastes, but all you can taste is cheese and chives. Needs a bit more salt too. My first batch stuck to the pan, so I sprayed the pan after that. These are ok, not great, not terrible. A good jumping off point, with a little tweaking this could be 5 stars.

I have been making crackers similar to these since I was a teenager decades ago. The hints that I have to make it easier is to: A. Use finely shredded extremely sharp WHITE cheddar cheese (I have to buy blocks and shred by hand). B. Melt the butter C. Sift the flour  D. and lastly, I don't form into a roll or refridgerate. The dough is warm from the melted butter, and I've found it best to just squeeze it into 1" balls in my hand, and then press it down on a cookie sheet with the bottom of a flat cup. Make sure the bottom is completely flat and not dished. I also dip the cup into flour between crackers so it doesn't stick. I never have leftovers...

This is a really good recipe. I gave it a try to add to my spread for the holidays. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the recipe calls for the dough to be chilled then sliced but I found it didn't really help to chill it. Its still an awkward dough to work with. I just rolled it out to 1/4 thickness and used small cookie cutters.

Delicious and easy...simply rolled into small balls & used fork to press tops and baked rather than refrigerating first. Would have liked a little more crunch. Otherwise flavorful and yummy.

These were just okay to me. Nothing great. I really had high hopes for these! I made them exactly as written. Maybe I should have made changes that other members suggested in their reviews...(2 hours later)...Okay,I just got some great suggestions from other members on this site on how to make these better! I added more salt, garlic powder, grated parmesan cheese and cayenne pepper.I also baked it til they were very brown.This was so much better!!! These spread out a little while baking, so leave a little room on the sheet. I baked these on parchment paper.They taste similar to the boxed name brand cheese crackers!So now I changed it from 3 stars to 4 stars!

Great recipe thanks for sharing.  Next time I will add more hot sauce though.  I left them in the fridge overnight in tight little rolls and used an electric carving knife to slice them in the morning.  Worked like a dream.

I've made these a few times now and they are always a hit. I have a 2 y/o and a 3 y/o so I omit the hot sauce and chives, and double the garlic powder and salt. I also ran out of sharp Cheddar so I subbed in a cup of finely grated mozz. Fantastic! Here are my hints: do not make these by hand! Use your mixmaster. My Kitchen Aid gets the dough so tightly packed that I never have problems cutting through it (no crumbling, etc.). I also pop the four sections in the freezer for about 15 minutes and that's always sufficient for me. (I wrap them tightly in press and seal.) Lastly, I try to square off my four rolls. I then cut them (post freezer) SUPER thin and cut those slices in half (think Cheez-It style). It makes WAY more tahn 54 servings but they come out light and crispy. Delicious! Thanks, Nikki! This one's a keeper. :)

For me, this recipe was just OK.  I hosted a wine tasting party and was serving savory snacks.  These were left behind, people did not seem interested in them.  Would not make these again. Very dry and crumbly, I followed the recipe to a "T".

My son found this recipe and wanted to try it with his first harvest of chives. We love it and have been using it at all of our dinner parties this summer. I do use a tablespoon of whatever hot sauce I have on hand for a little extra zing. Thanks for sharing this great appetizer!

These were absolutely great!  I changed a couple things.  
1)Added Dried instead of fresh chives
2)When I sliced the crackers I flattened them with my hand to make them thinner
3)I did like Kimikomi said and greased the bottom 
- and these turned out excellent!  They turned out double as good as store bought cheese crackers/crisps.

Yum! I made these for my kids' school lunches.  I omitted the hot sauce and chives, and used 1 teaspoon of green herb stock instead of the garlic powder. I also was short of rice cereal by 1/2 cup, so I crushed some cornflakes. I melted the butter and rolled into balls and flattened them to bake. They are crispy and the kids love them! Will definitely make again

Loved this recipe!   All of my friends just had to have it.  I kept some in the frid for about a week before I cooked them up and they were still crunchy.

These were pretty tasty little snacks.  My only complaint is that the first day they seemed to have a bit of a floury texture.  The next couple days either they really grew on me or it went away a bit.  Hmmm.  Not really sure.  I did not have trouble slicing the roll at all.  However, it did sit in the fridge overnight before I sliced and cooked them.  Pretty good and different little crackers.  Thanks.

These are a good snack.  I thought I didn't like them cold, but I keep eating them, can't stop!  I had a problem with dry crumbly mix, therefore only 4 stars.  I pressed them together very well, refrigerated them like recipe states, and still had a problem slicing them thin enough without them just falling apart.  I might try melting the butter next time, instead of just softening.  I had to use dried chives, since that is what I had.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe.

These were delicious.  I made them for a card party and everyone liked them.  I increased the amount of hot sauce to 1 tablespoon and used 2 1/2 cups of cheddar and 1/2 cup of freshly grated Parmesan.  I also added a bobble of Worchestershire sauce, just because I like it in cheese dishes.  My cat is in love with these, too.  With all the cheese and butter, he thinks they are the perfect kitty treat, and I can't keep him away from them.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this recipe without the hot sauce. They were very delicious and crispy, as promised. For extra flavor, I use half cheddar and half Parmesan Reggiano. For nutrition, I add flax seed, poppy seeds or sesame seeds. Whatever I happen to have when I'm baking. This is a keeper. Thanks for sharing.

However, I substituted Herbes de Provence for the chives and also baked them on parchment paper.

Everyone enjoyed these crisps, but I found them a little bland. I'd triple the hot sauce to add some kick, and I had to add extra butter to make the dough a little more managable. It was a little crumbly without the extra butter. I'd make it again, but it still needs more kick.

These were awesome! I was in a hurry, so I omitted the chives (didn’t have any) and instead of rolling logs and refrigerating, I just made balls and squished them flat with a fork. Only cooked for 15 min since they weren’t refrigerated. They were perfect!

I have made this recipe numerous times.  Love it!  The only things I do differently sometimes is use different cheeses or combinations of cheeses when I don't happen to have enough cheddar on hand.  I've actually never made it with chives.  I use the tops of green onions instead and they work just fine diced up small.  I often bake half and put the other two rolls of dough into the freezer to do at another time.
