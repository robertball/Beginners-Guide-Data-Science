Rather than serving this as a side I made it the main course of a dinner for my partner and I. It was very good. The flavors melded perfectly with nothing overpowering anything else. Next time I make it I might add a bit more poblano or use something hotter like serrano or jalapeno. I don't think that many people here in NM would think this tastes like the southwest since it is quite mild. It would be a great dish for a dinner party or even a brunch. One could make the mixture refrigerate it and bake it later in the day. Thanks Christine for a wonderful elegant dish!

Yummy! I used a casserole dish so I had to cook it longer. It was a big hit with my family.

Not as great as I had hoped. Generally my family of 6 didn't like it that much.
