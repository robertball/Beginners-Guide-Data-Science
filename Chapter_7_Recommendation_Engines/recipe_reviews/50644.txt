We love this recipe and I keep finding new ways to modify it (I feel I have to, since I make it at LEAST once a week)This is how we like it: I use celery seed rather than celery salt and usually have parmesan-romano cheese blend on hand so I use that. I also add 1/2 tsp. paprika, 1/4 tsp. garlic powder and 1/4 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes.  I don't add any lemon juice anymore (I used to just reduce it by half) but now use low-fat mayo that I find to be quite tangy.  I also double the amount of pepper and add about 1/2 c. of bread crumbs to the cheese mixture, which creates a nice texture and keeps the topping in place. Seasoning the fish with a bit of Old Bay seasoning, as others have done, really adds to the flavor as well. Thank you for helping us eat fish on a regular basis, Phoebe!

I made some changes to this recipe to lower some of the fat content but I still think it was delicious and deserved five stars.  Instead of using regular mayo and butter, I substituted fat free mayo and light butter.  I also sprayed the fillets with olive oil cooking spray before placing them under the broiler.  Since tilapia cooks quickly, I didn't turn them at all.  I let them cook 3 or 4 minutes (oven rack on second slot from the top), added the cheese mixture, and removed them when the cheese started to brown.

I've made this several times and this is absolutely the easiest and best tilapia, or any fish, dish I have ever made. Everyone I make it for wants the recipe.  I do line a broiler pan with foil and spray the foil with cooking spray.  The only other thing I do differently is to sprinkle the fish with Old Bay Seasoning before putting under the broiler for the first time and then again before topping with the parmesan mix while it is out of the oven.  I also make sure that I start with the side of the fish that has the dark vein running through the center facing up starting out then it should end up on the bottom when finished.  Low fat mayo makes it even more healthy than it already is without making a big difference.  I've found it best to follow the cooking time closely. It's quick. It's tasty. Try it!

Excellent!  Hubby declared, "best fish ever, let's have it next week"...

Only thing I did differently was to add 1/4 tsp garlic powder (because we love garlic) and 1/4 tsp paprika.  The paprika really gave it a nice flavor and added a wonderful color to the cheese sauce.  We will definitely be making this often.

I scaled this recipe in half and went with some of the suggestions of reviewer, Shannon:) (click on "most helpful" and you'll see her review).  I've only had tilapia once and wasn't that impressed with that fresh-water, farmed fish, so I went with rockfish (aka: red snapper in warmer waters; rockfish in colder northern waters).  I added to the parmesan mixture:  some garlic powder, paprika, a touch of cayenne pepper & some panko bread crumbs.  This cheese mixture is really what makes the dish; it was excellent and I liked the way the bread crumbs/cheese browned lightly under the broiler.  I only had to broil the fish 2 minutes on each side, plus 2 minutes with the cheese mixture.  Served with steamed broccoli.  Talk about an easy, quick-prep meal!  Thanks, Phoebe!

I was really desperate for something to do with some recently defrosted tilapia fillets and spotted this recipe and it looked interesting.

My husband loved it.  Loved the texture, the zing of the parmesan and spice was just perfect.  Will definitely make again for family & friends.  Only issue was I made the spread and put it in the fridge for 1/2 hr. early and it melted way too fast in the broiler.  Lost 1/2 the topping.  My error.  Don't recommend chilling spread 1st.

Have made this on several occasions trying to find the right balance of cheese mixture to fish.  The first time I made the recipe exactly as stated (as a courteous nod to the submitter) and it swam in butter so I rated this at three stars (wonderful but loaded with calories).  The second time, I reduced the butter again to an 1/8 cup and it was still overpowered by the butter, so try, try again to one tablespoon of butter for the perfect mixture.  Wonderful flavor!!!

We're fish lovers, so maybe that's what influenced our opinion of this dish. The sauce is pungent and overpowers the delicate tilapia. It would work better on a fish with more substance and flavor to it. Tilapia is best served by lightly dressing it with olive oil, real butter and lemon juice, lightly salted and broiled. We won't want this again.

I've made this twice and it is awesome and sooo easy. I would make it any day for my picky seafood eating freinds. The second time I used sour cream because we were out of mayo and it was as good if not better.

Very easy and flavorful. Makes plenty of topping, I actually used about 1-1/2 times the amount of tilapia called for with no problems.

This recipe is great--I've already made it twice! I put each piece of fish in a foil packet (make sure you spray your foil first so the fish doesn't stick!) and then spread the topping on. Fold up the packet and grill for about 20 minutes...turns out perfectly and doesn't make the kitchen smell like fish!

What a quick and tasty recipe! Tried this tonight, and dealing with my 3 year old "trying to help" me in the kitchen took me longer than the actual prep and cook...I read a lot of the reviews, and changed this about the recipe. Added 1/2 tsp of garlic powder, a 1/4 of paprika and 1/2 cup of panko crumbs. I didn't have non stick spray or olive oil, so I just spritzed the foil covered cookie sheet with some butter spray, and lightly seasoned the fillets with some old bay seasoning. I broiled vein side down for 4 minutes, topped with cheese/crumb mix, and broiled for another 3...came out great and the family inhaled it! 
Now warning, if you don't like parmesan cheese, then don't use this recipe, it's a predominant flavor..And tilapia is a mild, somewhat delicate fish, that benefited from the stronger taste of the topping. And although I did change the origianl recipe to suit my tastes, I still give it a deserved 5 stars, for without the basis of the original recipe, I wouldn't have anything to build off of...

This recipe is similar to a halibut recipe that I make. I omitted celery salt since I didnt have any but other than that I followed recipe. Baked at 375 for 15 minutes. Perfect.

This is a delicious tilapia recipe.  I seasoned the filets on both sides with garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, basil, and seasoned salt before putting the topping on them.  No need for all the mayo and butter--adjust however you want.  I also added some bread crumbs to get a crispier topping.

I have similar version of this recipe that will knock your socks off!  You line the bottom of a baking dish with sliced tomatoes, sprinkle about 1/2 cup of chopped Kalamata olives, add some lemon zest and squeeze lemon juice over the top and add salt and pepper.  Then lay the tilapia pieces over the top and spread the mayo-parmesean mix over the fish and bake at 450 for 20 to 30 minutes or until golden brown.  It is AWESOME!

This is definitely a winning recipe to try!!!

  A recent tilapia purchase brought me to allrecipes.com for a good recipe.  A 5-star rating and the fact that I happened to have all ingredients required prompted me to try this recipe.  Only thing I omitted was the celery salt (not a fan).  ADDED BONUS:  TAKES VERY LITTLE TIME TO PREPARE!! 

This recipe came out so good, I went back to the store and loaded up on tilapia for the freezer- and I'm cooking it again tonite!  Try!!!

This is an excellent recipe. I had no celery salt, so subbed a bit of garlic salt, and used Smart Balance instead of butter. It turned out fine. Next time I will try low-fat mayo. I only had a pound of fish because there are just two of us, but made the full amount of topping -- which was great on cooked cauliflower.

I've made this recipe at least a dozen times since I first found it. It's excellent and family and friends are crazy about it! One snowy day last year, I wanted to make it but had no tilapia. I used chicken cutlets instead and it was just as good.

As if this recipe needed any more reviews.  It was great.  I subbed dill for basil and used garlic salt instead of celery salt and added a little old bay.  My husband and I both enjoyed it.  2 year old not so much, but that is expected. update 12/14/06:I changed up a bit the second time and added a few bread crumbs on top. Much better this way and 2 yr old loved it.

This is a wonderful base recipe! As I am a cook who does not always use exact measurements I made the following adjustments: Banged up some garlic crotons, Parmesan/Romano shredded cheese blend, Tony Chachere's Seasoning, Old Bay, Miracle Whip, and a little extra butter than called for (made extra topping). Topped the fish with that magical combo (most important do not over broil) and it was delectable. In the words of the infamous Rachael Ray...YUM-O!!! Served with egg noodles tossed with the extra topping and steamed broccoli. People could not get enough of this; so now I make it all the time!

This recipe is awesome. My son loved it and so did I.  I made this with about a pound of tilapia, therefore I had extra sauce.  I used the extra sauce in my rice pilaf.  Dinner was a wonderful eating experience.

After over a 100 sterling reviews of this tilapia my two cents doesn't seem necessary, but for the doubters I would have to agree this is pretty darn tasty.  So simple.  I followed the recipe exactly and didn't alter any of the ingredients.  I did add a pinch extra parmesan, but really, can you ever have too much parmesan?  The flavor was excellent, prep time a breeze and all diners at my house were pleased and cleaned their plates.  I will make this again and recommend others try it too!  Tilapia can taste so boring, but this recipe added the punch it needs without an overpowering flavor.  Yummy.

I have made this three times and will make it again tonight. I used 1lb. of tilapia and added a little more lemon juice. I think I will add lump crab meat to the mixture the next time.

I'm not a big fish eater, but the wife & kids are, so as the cook in the family I make at least one fish recipe a week. This is probably THE only way I actually ENJOY eating the fish! I make the topping as stated, but add a little extra Parmigiano-Reggiano on top of mine (I'm a huge parm fan)

This is one of the best broiled fish dishes I have had.  Every Lenten Season I struggle with how to cook fish.  (We don't really eat it the rest of the year. I like fish, I just don't know what to do with it.)  This recipe is very fast and easy.  The only thing I think it needed extra was a little more salt.  The 1/8 tsp. celery salt wasn't enough for our tastes.  This recipe is definately a keeper not only for Lent, but for the rest of the year as well.  Thank you for submitting this recipe.

Loved it!  I am doing Weight Watchers so I made the following modifications:  sprinkled garlic salt directly on the tilapia and gave it a squeeze of lemon before broiling.  Broiled 2 min per side, then added a lighter version of the topping:  sprayed each filet with with a few shots of "I Can't Believe it's not Butter" spray, dabbed each piece with a bit of MIracle Whip, tossed on a scant sprinkle of fresh parmesan, added a little fresh-ground pepper and another squeeze of lemon.  Broiled 2 more min for a delicious, quick, and very healthy dinner!

OH MY..this was delicious.  My picky husband, who's not a big fish fan had 2 servings..and I had 2-1/2.  I absolutely loved the parmesan topping.  Since tilapia is a mild flavored fish, the cheese topping really came through.  Will definitely be adding this into my seafood rotation.  Thanks so much Phoebe.

My oven was being replaced, so I had to adjust the directions.  I pan-seared the fish in a very small amt. of butter...cooked on both sides just a few minutes, then added the sauce over the fish.  I then cooked only long enough for the sauce to be gently heated.  My husband's comment "this is company good!"

Modified Review.  We loved this seasoning blend so much that I had to try frying the Tilapia.  In a large, deep, skillet over medium heat, melt the butter and mayonnaise. Beat together one egg plus one tablespoon of water and 1/8 tsp salt.  Dredge filets in egg wash, then bread/cheese mixture and place in skillet and fry, uncovered, for approximately 4 minutes per side (until fish flakes easily with fork).  Remove to paper towel lined plate for a moment before placing on a platter.  YUM!   Original Review: Add 1/4 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp paprika, 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper flakes, 1/8 tsp Old Bay Seasoning, and use celery seed instead of celery salt. If you want to prepare and refrigerate the seasoning/cheese/breading mixture ahead of time, it cuts your “Ready” time – start to finish – to 10 minutes!  Size of the filets will affect broil time; I used very small (2 ounce) tilapia filets, and found the perfect broil time was 6 minutes.

WoW!!!! The reviews are true, this was very very good, so good I had it sat and sun. I cooked as stated with the exception of celery salt, I used garlic powder and it work out fine. I did lightly season my fish with old bay and I did not use as much mayo as called for
and it was just enough. Whatever you do cook as time states DO NOT BE TEMPTED TO COOK LONGER!!!. Oh yea I almost forgot I also lightly top my dish with Italian bread crumbs YUM!!!! DON'T PASS THIS ONE UP. UPDATE!!!! I CAN'T STOP MAKING THIS, REALLY GOOD FOLKS.

Holy smokes! Just made this tonight and it was absolutely fantastic! My husband has been indifferent to tilapia in the past while my son and I have always loved it BUT tonight we ALL loved it. Hubby is now a fan and son thinks we should have it 6 nights a week. The only changes I made were to season with Jonny's seafood seasoning before broiling, ditched the mayo in favor of non fat yogurt and cut the butter amount in half. This dish DID NOT suffer for the changes. It honestly taste like something you would get at a nice seafood restaurant.  Thanks for sharing such a special recipe. It is now in permanent rotation at our house!

This was my first try at making tilapia and it was delicious! I left out the celery salt as Parmesan is salty enough already and used a bit of garlic powder instead. I served with plain egg noodles for all that extra sauce. Yum! Thank you for this great recipe!

Wow...My whole family loved this dish.  My son told me I didn't make enough sauce since we used the extra to spread all over the fish and rice.  This is a simple easy recipe that I will use again and again.  I didn't have celery salt on hand so I substituded with celery seed and kosher salt.  Very yummy!!!!

This is great. I spared the spices with salt, added some smashed capers and used fresh herbs from my garden. Served over a bed of basmati rice, it looked and tasted delicious! **** Later addition to review: I've also had great success adding quartered or chopped artichoke hearts to the topping mixture. Can't get enough!

We have made this once a week for the past month! You can use lime juice in a bottle if you don't have fresh lemons and Parmesan in a can if you don't have fresh grated. They're perfect any way! Thanks for the AMAZING recipe!

The parm sauce has a wonderful flavor. I wouldn't change a thing about it. I was worried my fish wasn't cooked and ended up over-cooking it. That was my mistake. I'm not a fish loved but I loved this recipe.

Tasted great, But added so much fat to this receipie made me feel guilty about eating this seafood dish.  Next time I made this I would cut the butter and mayo in half.

I cannot remember when I liked a recipe as much as this Broiled Tilapia Parmesan. Like other reviewers, I did not have celery salt on hand, so I substituted with a dollop of cream of celery soup. From start to finish this recipe took 10 minutes and was mouthwatering delicious. A definite keeper!

I have used this topping recipe on several different kinds of fish - it works well with tilapia because tilapia can overcook easily and this topping protects the fish as well as adding a moisturizing factor to it - so the fish will hold well. It is also very good on salmon as it helps balance the "fishy" taste - and adds a bit of brightness to the overall taste. I like to zest the lemon and sprinkle a bit of it over the topping when it comes out of the oven for presentation. I've used this in several restaurants and it's always been a house favorite.

This recipe is hard for me to rate. My husband did not like it. I thought it was very good, wonderful flavor, and I loved the ease of preparation (very gourmet taste but simple ingred. & super easy to put together!). I probably won't make it again since I would be the only one eating it, but thanks for letting me try something different! PS Followed Shannon(:'s advice and used celery seed instead of celery salt, the only change I made to this recipe.

I can't say enough good things about this recipe. I came home tonight late with nothing to cook, no time to thaw anything, then remembered that I had added this to my shopping list & had the ingredients on hand. It was so easy 
(and I am afraid of the broiler) super delicious and the fish turned out flaky & perfect! I will add almonds & bread crumbs next time for fish almondine like Luby's. Thank you! I will be making this often!

We make this all the time, it's one of our weekly favorites.  We followed some of the advice by mixing different cheeses and adding the paprika gives it a nice flavor and extra color.  We serve it over white rice, excellent as leftovers too!

Phenomenal.  

I bought 10 pieces of Tilapia (which ended up being just over 1.5 lbs.).  After making a batch of the topping, I realized it wouldn't be enough, so I made another.  I then broiled the fish for 2:30 on each side on the second-to-highest oven rack position, added gracious amounts of the topping to each piece, then broiled for about another 2:30 (until the topping was a little browned).  

Easy and wonderful.

This is an amazing way to enjoy tilapia! Now one of our family favorites. 2 of the kids dont like fish, I make chicken for them and fish for us cooked together with the same ingredients. They love it too!

I used flounder and it tasted great. Read reviews before I started and added 1/2 tsp. paprika, 1/4 tsp. garlic powder, and a small amount of crushed red pepper flakes. Sprinkled the flounder with Old Bay seasoning on both sides, omitting the celery salt because the Old Bay has it in it.. Also used Low Fat Mayo. Delicious!!

This was excellent, not to mention easy!  I used Monkfish because it is what we had and is similar in 'meatiness' to tilapia, and it came out great.  I not a huge fish fan and we are trying to eat more fish, so this is a keeper.  I'm eager to try it on some other types of fish as well.

I had to add an edit because my fish-averse hubby got up for seconds tonight with the exclamation: "I was wrong - I like tilapia!" Thanks again for this little gem!
This is easy, delicious, and quick - mix up the topping before you start the fish under the broiler or you'll end up overcooking it. This is a forgiving recipe - after making it a couple of times, I don't measure the ingredients any more, and I can substitute seasonings depending on what I have on hand or am in the mood for. Thanks for a great weeknight family pleaser!

Delicious- we thought the fish was very moist and favorful this way. I  did add some old bays seasoning to  the cheese mixture and  It took longer to cook -maybe our fish was thicker? I will be making this again. I scaled the recipe to 2 servings.  I also added 1 T. of  breadcrumbs and a dash of red pepper. I make this almost every week now and I served it  with rice,a vegetable and salad --  its very easy to make. My husband really likes it.

I made this for the first time 2 weeks ago, and have made it again recently.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception on adding 2T of bread crumbs, per others suggestions.  This was easy, came out perfectly, and it was the first time I ever made any kind of fish!

My boyfriend loved loved loved it!!!! I did make a few changes to suit his taste and some comments from some previous reviewers. I omitted the celery salt but added garlic powder in its place, about a 1/4 - 1/2 a tsp. I also added a palm full of toasted unseasoned breadcrumbs. Other reviewers said it helped hold the sauce together better and it seemed to do just that. This is going to be a staple of our weekly diet. There are other spices and herb combos that I can't wait to try. Thanks for the great recipe!!

Holy Moly, this was the best fish recipe I have had.  Even my 13 year-old non fish eater loved it.  The asked me to make it again tomorrow.  I think I'll wait until maybe next week.  The only thing I changed was I cut down the pepper to 1/8 teaspoon and I also sprinkled it with Old Bay seasoning before I broiled it.  Thanks Phoebe for this recipe.

This is the best recipe I have ever tried off of allrecipes! It is amazing! My husband could not stop raving about it, he described it as recipe quality. The best part is it is so quick and easy! It took about 10 min to prepare and in that time I was able steam some asparagus and toss a 90 sec rice bag in the microwave and have a great dinner in less than 15 min flat! Definitly a new regular at our house!

The sauce was very good, will make again. I might try it with another white fish though, I didn't care much for the tilapia.

I've been making a variation of this recipe for years.  Instead of the spices, mix in some Dijon mustard to taste, maybe 2-3 Tbl., along with the cheese and mayo.  Really perks it up.

Great flavors. I put everything in a bowl except the butter and coated the fish. I laid a base of rice, butter, and green beans on parchment paper then topped with the fish and closed the paper up in a packet. 425 for 10 mins. Yum-O!!

By far one of the best breaded fish recipes that I have found. It was very tangy and spicy. I added 1/3 cup of Panko bread crumbs for consistency.

This recipe was really good. My family really liked it. I was kinda leary about the topping because it didn't look much like cheese when I first put it on the fish, but it turned out great, like the photos. I will make this again.

Super Fast! Super Easy!! Super Delicious!!!  After reading the reviews I cut the butter in half & added 1/4 cup of panko to the topping, I also used Old Bay on the fish as many suggested.  Will make again, as many said if you change up the seasonings you can give it a whole new taste.  I also think I might try using crumbled Ritz crackers in place of the panko.  Really good versatile base recipe that you can twist to meet your tastes.

I've made this recipe a couple of times. The first time, it was good but not great. This time, I seasoned the fish prior to cooking it. One complaint the first time I made it was the topping seemed to thin out too much when placed under the broiler. I followed another reviewers recommendation and added breadcrumbs to the mixture to thicken it up a little during cooking. It was great and my family loved it.

I purchased a box of frozen Tilapia from Walmart and tried one the other night. It was very fishy and I didn't like it at all. There are tons of individually wrapped fillets in the box so I figured I didn't want them to go to waste and searched for some recipes. Based on the many many positive reviews I thought this would be the one to try since I didn't even need to get ingredients from the store. I am HOOKED! This has to be one of the best recipes I have tried. My mods: I added some freeze dried onions, a dash of cayenne pepper, took away the celery salt (didn't have any), reduced the butter to well under a teaspoon (added more light mayo to make up for it), to finish off, I added panko breadcrumbs to each side and didn't even flip the fish. I baked at 370. The panko breadcrumbs keep the fish crispy. Yummy and NO MORE fishy taste at all. A+++ on this recipe. Who would have thought mayo and fish would go together so well?

I know how everyone loves this and I've made it twice, but the topping just doesn't stay on the fish.  I use Basa filet or Flounder since I don't care for Tilapia.  Any suggestions?

Wow!  Not only did I love this but so did my "non-fish eating" husband!  I did add ½ cup of cracker crumbs and will absolutely make this regularly.  Update: this has been a standing favorite in our house.  I did find that I can fancy it up by adding crabmeat (when it's on sale) and serving it using crab bisque as a sauce on the plate.  (Buy the frozen crab bisque on sale too and heat in saucepan before serving.)

This is very good! The only thing that I would recommend is to not cook it on foil. Cook it on a broiler pan or punch holes in the foil to let the fish drain out. It was a little mushy.

Usually I have to ask my husband what he thinks when I make something new.  This time I didnt.  He couldnt stop saying how good it was.  I too, thought it was really good.  That is the first time I made tilapia and I would definately make it again.

Very flavorful and easy. I cooked the fish a little longer than the recipe called for because I used tilapia loins which are a little thicker than the filets. I did not include the basil when I fixed it but I'm sure it would add to the flavor. The coating/sauce was very good.

This was outstanding and so easy and super quick to make.  How great is that?  My husband's comment was that it was good enough to serve to guests!!!  It really took no time at all and had such flavor!  I was shocked that my 2 1/2 year little girl loved it.  She gobbled down every morsel.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was done in less than 10 minutes.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!  We wil definitely make this one again!

Delicious!! Very easy and quick.  The whole family loved it.  Followed recipe exactly except: 1)didn't have onion powder so I finely chopped/minced a little bit of onion, 2)didn't have reg.mayo so I used Miracle Whip Light-reduced the amount a little just to cut calories, 3)sprinkled both sides of fish with fish/chicken grill seasoning.  Great dish if you're having company over.

This recipe was fantastic! All my family raved about it, including my brother who HATES anything seafood. (He even asked for another piece!)I was a little worried at first as it took a little longer that the specified time to cook the fish in the grill (i'm from Australia we don't call it a broiler), but in the end it turned out perfectly. I doubled the sauce and used the rest to serve over the vegies, and will probably do the same next time. A couple of things i changed: I have never heard of the fish used in the recipe(tilipa), - maybe we don't have it in Australia - so i just used a white fish from the supermarket. I did not add the lemon to the sauce but served the fish with a slice of lemon to squeeze over for each individual's taste. I also didn't add celery salt, but used garlic flakes and garlic salt, as my family love garlic. 
I will definitely use this recipe again... Thanks!

This was my first attempt ever at trying to cook fish, I can't beleive how easy this was!!!  My boyfriend couldn't stop thanking me for making it!  I followed the recipe exactly, I did line the broiler pan with foil, and sprayed the foil, no problems with sticking.  The cooking time was perfect, the fish came out flakey and moist.  A super recipe that I will be making often!!!  Thank you!

this recipe has very nice flavor.  i think that its a little greasy and could maybe take less butter or mayo to cut down the oil.  i didnt have celery salt so i just used garlic salt and i put fresh ground pepper and salt on the fish before i placed in the broiler.  also i think maybe this recipe would work better on a more hearty fish.  i really love the flavor of the ingredients i just think that perhaps the fish is a little too delicate for all that cheese and oils.

DELICIOUS!!  Didn't have onion powder, celery salt or basil, but used salt free all purpose seasoning instead.  Seasoned fish and topped with MOST IMPORTANT parmesan topping.  Served with lemon rice and sliced tomatoes.  For the lemon rice use 1 C jasmine rice, 1 1/3 C chicken broth, 2 T lemon juice, 1-2 t lemon rind, 2 sliced up scallions and 2 T butter.  Cover and bake in preheated 350 oven for 40-45 minute--FANTASTIC.

Made this last night with white rice and fresh asparagus roasted with a little olive oil salt and pepper then sprinkled with  parmesan cheese before serving.  It was delicious and love quick fresh meals ... especially after a long day when I really don't feel like cooking. Definitely will make again.

The mayonnaise was the prominent taste in the sauce. I ended up scraping the sauce off the top of the fish before I ate it. If I were to try this again, I would cut out the mayo completely.

Changed nothing, but cooking times by a few minutes here and there. Seasoned the fish with Old Bay first.

I followed this recipe verbatim- I don't know if it's fair of me to rate this because I do not like fish, but I've been trying very hard to incorporate it into my diet.  That being said, the cheese mixture was very tasty, well-balanced, and had a nice tang that went very well with the tilapia.  I only had 3 bites, too weirded out at the thought of eating fish, but that's my issue, not the recipe's ;)  Everyone else (normal peoeple who can eat fish) enjoyed, and agreed that it deserved 4 out of 5 stars (my boyfriend prefers fried tilapia, my sister likes tilapia simple, with just lemon/butter, etc.) Thank you for providing me with this recipe to try!

Very good. Agree with most that it is way too much butter. Made twice so far and used half the butter the second time around. Very good.

Haven't rated a dish in quite a while, but this one was really praiseworthy!!!  Absolutely loved this!!!  So easy and delicious, and perfect for my Atkins lifestyle!!!  Didn't have celery salt, but didn't miss it in the flavor of the dish.  May try a sprinkle of Old Bay and/or paprika next time as others have suggested.  Thank you for sharing this recipe, Phoebe!!!

This dish is highly popular on the AR buzz, but I don't get the hype. It's fine, but nothing especially intriguing or interesting. I actually prefer just simply broiled fish with a splash of lemon juice.

Okay recipe.  I halved the recipe for 1 pound of fish.  Next time I will decrease the amount of buter and mayonaise, wanted more of the melty cheese than a sauce.  Also used celery seed, didn't have celery salt.  Parmesan is salty enough.

When hubby says "You should make this again!", it means it is good.  And that is what he said.  I didn't have any onion powder or celery salt so I just made it with out it and it was still delicious.  Also didn't bother to flip it.  So, so easy.  Will make this again and again.

This was very good.  There was something I didn't quite like about it...I think maybe the celery salt so will try next time with less of that.  My husband really liked it.  It was very quick to make.

This may be a good dish for people who don't like fish. My ex-husband didn't like fish, and he really liked this dish because of the topping, which is very strong and savoury.  My kids, who like fish, love this dish. It's a fast, easy dinner. Note that if the fillets are significantly different in size (thickness), some may be fully cooked while others are still raw in the middle. Just keep an eye on them as they cook.

I've been making this recipe for about a year and can't believe I haven't reviewed it yet.  Anybody who knows me knows that I would rather gouge out my own eyeballs with a fish hook than actually eat a fish, but this recipe is incredible!  I love it!!  The topping melts into this crust that is deeeeeeee-li-cious!  I could eat this every week!  I do use peccorino-romano cheese in place of parmesan, and leave out the celery salt (personal preferences). I usually pair this with a garlic butter rice and sauteed asparagus.

Really liked this!  My son fixed this and liked it so sent it to me. Used olive oil instead of butter (I used a full 1/4 cup but would cut back next time to a little more than 1/8 cup)to bring down the calories.  Loved the crunchy crust!  Seasoned the actual fish prior to broiling with all the herbs and spices, plus added a little cayanne for a bite!  YUMMMMMM!

Why bother adding ANOTHER five star rating? For all of you into LOWFAT cooking, I subbed naturally lowfat buttermilk instead of mayo. Came out great. (According to South Beach, fat-free mayo should be avoided due to carbs.)

Original 5/3/2017 review: Made this for my husband and myself tonight.  Fish was moist and topping was good.  I would definitely add breadcrumbs on top next time to make it crunchy.  I omitted the lemon juice and basil.  Used garlic powder and seasoned salt instead of onion salt and celery seed.  Keep an eye on the fish as the topping turns brown very quickly once the butter melts.

Updated 7/10/17
Ten years later and I am still making this recipe. I now use garlic and onion powder and a little sprinkling of Old Bay.

Delicious!  I used red snapper fillets because the store I went to didn't have Tilapia.  I also used garlic powder and seasoning salt instead of onion powder and celery salt.  This recipe makes me want to eat fish more often!  Thanks!

This is the best fish I've ever eaten.  I omitted the basil and celery salt and added dill instead.  I also substituted lite mayo and lite butter.  I'm on the weight watcher's flex point program and was amazed that a serving of this is only 5 points when using the lite butter and mayo.

This recipe was amazing.  I did alter it a tiny bit.  I thought that something was missing from it the first time I made it so I seasoned the tilapia before cooking with a *little* bit of sea salt and pepper the second time .  That made the dish perfect.  I didn't alter the topping at all and I think it was the perfect blend of flavors without overpowering the fish.

What a great recipe! I'm not crazy about tilapia, but since it's inexpensive, I thought I'd try this recpe out. I'd recommend it even for those who aren't "fish" people. My fiance raved about it too.

Very, very good.  I don't even really like fish.  I followed the directions exactly and it came out perfect.  Pretty presentation too - better than the picture.  Thank you!

UPDATE: I made this last night with Dover filets.  I rolled thin pieces of asparagus and strips of red roasted red peppers in the fish filets and then put the sauce on top.  Served over wheat cous cous.  It was amazing!!

Great Recipe!  I modified a bit.  I didnt use the celery salt.  I added bread crumbs to some of the fillets.  I prefered the fillets with & without the bread crumbs, hubby liked both.  I preferred the breadcrumbs.  Even my 4 & 6 year olds tried this and had more than one bite!  I will definately share this recipe & use it again.  Yummie!

This turned out delicious!  1/2 the recipe and tweaked a little of the measurements.  You can cut down on the butter a lot.  I added chopped artichokes to the mixture then topped it off with panko breadcrumbs.  Tasted delicious!  Broiling really makes the panko extra crispy with each bite.  You can edit the recipe by using low fat mayo and cut down on the butter.  I was too lazy and just used garlic powder, salt and ground pepper to spice it up.  Turned out way too good.  Served it with lemon orzo and it was a hit with my hubby!  Will serve this again soon!

It's pretty good!  Although I have to agree, not "five stars" good, it's a bit overrated.  It definitely needs more kick, and it's obvious from the reviews that you can cater this to your own specific tastes. I think I will try increasing the amount of onion powder and celery salt and possibly consider adding garlic to the topping to give it a bit more "kick".  Otherwise, good, easy recipe, I will certainly make it again.

My husband and I tried this for the first time tonight and loved it.  Though I cooked it in a pan with a little bit of butter like a previous reviewer did, because I don't have a broiler pan in my oven.  It turned out great.

I tried this recipe on my non fish loving family and they loved it.  It does taste great, but I wish it were a little more healthy.  I want to feed my family fish they like without all the mayo, butter and cheese.

Wow that is a great recipe ans so easy. Great flavor as is but next time I think I will add the extras like garlic, red pepper flakes, and some bread crumbs as the topping did slide off a bit.  I was also thinking to add some chopped spinach next time too. Yummy, thank you!

This is an AWESOME recipe!  I have made it twice already - once for my parents and once for my husband.  All RAVED about it.  It tastes like something you would pay top dollar for in a nice restaurant.  The best part is that it is so quick and simple.  I didn't have any celery salt on hand, so I used garlic salt.  VERY GOOD AND WORTH EVERY STAR!!!

I used low fat versions of the mayo and butter, and it was excellent.  It was pretty easy to make, too. I made little "boats" out of tinfoil for each fish fillet, and transferred it to the plate in the boat.  It kept the sauce from running all over the place. I’m going to try it on chicken next time.

This is my stand-by fish recipe that I LOVE to make now.  It's AWESOME and deserves all the excellent reviews it is getting.  Even an anti-fish lover would appreciate this dish. Not fishy at all.  It's fattening but oh so good.  And super easy to make and super fast to cook. You can't go wrong with this recipe.

I thought this was easy and fairly tasty but it didn't go over very well with my family.  I used the website's calculator to scale down the recipe for 3 people and did not have enough of the cheese coating to cover all the filets. My 8 year old didn't care for it even with plenty of sauce on it.

This is a wonderful recipe.  Tilapia is such a mild fish that it is hard to go wrong with it but this sends it to the moon!

Very, very good. Didn't brown enough to my liking, I removed it early because it was smoking up my oven with all that butter. I will try to get it browned better the next time. Or clean my oven first, LOL. Great recipe, thanks.

This is a wonderful recipe.  Only thing I did different was to only use 3 fillets of Tilapia.  I would double the topping if I used 2lbs of fish.  Has a great taste to it.  Even my fiance who doesn't like parmesan loved it!!

Ok.. The first time I tried this recipe, I gave it three stars. But today, it tasted sooo good. I'm not sure what was exactly that I did wrong the first time, but today me and my husband just loved it. Next time, I'm not gonna add any celery seeds. I think their taste was overpowering and irrelevant. Other wise, it's a good recipe to keep.

This recipe had great flavor- not too salty or greasy.  My husband had never had tilapia and loved it.  The only problem I had was the fish fell apart before I even put the sauce on- any suggestions?  Definitely a keeper.

This talapia is pretty darn good.  The flavors all complement each other very well.  I do wish I had put in some bread crumbs for a little more texture, and to tone down the parmesan which was a little overpowering for me.  I love the flavors though - especially with the flaky texture of the talapia.  I didn't use any mayo, so that may have caused the extra-intenseness of the topping.  Wonderful.

I omitted the celery salt and used garlic salt instead...this is a keeper!
I served the tilapia with spinach.
I took butter and garlic and lightly sauteed the spinach until warm but not soggy.  The fish was great, I've made it twice already!

WOW, great one!!!!  I cut butter in 1/2 and used light mayo, otherwise followed exactly.  It was soooo good, very rich & flavorful.  I served it for the first time on company, and it looked good and tasted even better!  Very quick/easy to prepare.  I served it with rice pilaf and fresh green beans pan fried, and crusty bread.  Will definately make again & again.

OMG so incredibly excellent!!!! We love tilapia and this recipe just enhanced what is already a good piece of fish. If you need to use celery seed, powder, etc., that's fine (I didn't), but trust me, you won't need to use celery salt as the parm has PLENTY of salt already in it. We all went nuts over this Phoebe and I'll plan to make this great dish again very soon. Thanks so much!

I usually bomb big time with fish but i wanted to try one more time...it paid off with this wonderful recipe! I did one minor change, or rather addition which i would recommend...i added buttered italian bread crumbs after i broiled the topping for 2 minutes and then i broiled it again for another minute or so until the crumbs were brown. The lemon flavor comes out beautifully and the texture is fabulous! I cannot wait to try this again and serve it to guests to impress them! Great with wild rice and a salad!

I was delighted to find this recipe, we had some Tilapia in the freezer and needed to use it up. My husband and I both hate fish usually and we both LOVED it!! I didnt have basil, but I used Dill and it was spectacular, I give it a 5 star, he rates it a "strong 4" very impressive for him and for fish in my house!! :)

This is amazing recipe, I used whole lemon and still needed some more after the fish was done, so don't worry about measuring lemon juice. No need to flip the fish over when you first put it under the broiler.

This is a fabulous recipe. I added some salt and pepper to the mixture and before server I put chopped parsley and green onions on top. I absolutely loved this.

You can’t go wrong with this dish!!!  I've made it several times but last night I tried it without carefully reading the directions.  I put on the topping BEFORE the 1st broil - Wrong. When I realized what I'd done, I scrapped it off.  Then after turning the fish the 1st time, I put on the topping again - wrong again. I let it cook for 2 minutes then turned it over quickly so the topping wouldn't burn.  All in all by the final broil I sprinkled it with Old Bay (as suggested by Sheila in Texas) AND sprinkled bread crumbs and parsley before the final broil (as suggested by pjoy222).  No one knew the difference.  It's always great!!!

It's only 5 stars if you modify it. I took the others' advice and added garlic powder and paprika; I lessened the lemon; and added panko crumbs. I doubled the mixture a tad bit because I wanted to add it to both sides of the fish instead of just one side. Instead of broiling the fish and then adding the mixture, I spread half the mixture on, baked it for about 10 mins, and then broiled it for 5 minutes. Then I flipped it around and spread some more and did the same. It's delicious! If you want a spicy kick, add some crush pepper too.

The fish itself turned out great but I found the topping overwhelming. I ended up scraping it off just to eat the fish, which was cooked perfectly.

Terrific!  This will be a weekly meal at my house from now on, by request.  I followed the recipe (halved) exactly, but added some garlic powder, onion powder and paprika (for color) to the compound butter mixture.  I also sprinkled some Panko crumbs mixed with a little parsley flakes on top of the butter/cheese mixture just prior to the final broiling.  I cannot say how excellent this was.  Thanks very much!

So ridiculously easy, and so ridiculously tasty!  My husband isn't big on fish (he likes red meat more), and anytime he does have fish, he swears he has to have it with tartar sauce.  No tartar sauce with this one, and he was sad there wasn't any left!  I've never seen him so enthused about fish!  As with anything broiled, keep a close eye on it.  I cooked for 2 min on one side, 2 min on the other, and 2 min with the cheese mixture.

Parmesan crusted Tilapia, sauteed spinach and mushrooms, and home made fresh sweet potato chips.   Added two cloves of fresh Garlic to the mixture.  Excellent recipe.

Loved this!  I seasoned the tilapia with a bit of Old Bay seasoning, red pepper flakes, and black pepper.  I only used 1 tbsp of butter and 3 tbsp of mayo for 4 people.  Delicious, flavorful, and filling.

Omg amazing! This is an awesome recipe just as it is! The only thing I do differently is I sprinkle the fillets with old bay seasoning on both sides. And I put a little in the mayo mix. Such a delicious tasty way to make tilapia! My mouth is watering thinking about it!!

A KEEPER for sure!! I made it healthy by substituting greek yogurt for the mayo, and cut down Parmesean cheese by 1/4 c. (only because I ran out) I added 1/2 c. Panko bread crumbs ( to keep the topping on top) 1/4 tsp garlic, 1/4 tsp paprika. My husband normally doesn't care for Tilapia, but loved this dish and all 3 children...11y, 4y, 2y, ate it with pleasure. I will be making this again and will keep basic recipe and tweak it a little every now and then to keep it interesting. delicious, fast, and very easy.

Loved the flavor of the parmesan coating. I also loved how simple and quick this was. I added a little bit of ranch and bread crumbs to my mix because we are really big ranch fans. It was wonderful. Even my picky 2 year old gobbled it right up. Thank you.

With over a 5500 great reviews, I am a little late to the party, but this fish is fantastic!  

I sprinkled a little breadcrumbs and parsley over the top before the final broil to make it more aesthetically pleasing, everyone loved "my" fish!  Thanks.

I thought this dish was good. My kids and husband thought it was the best :) It was easy to make but did come off a little too salty for me. But, it wasn't inedible. I will make this again.

This turned out delicious, even though I didn't really like the topping by itself. It came together nicely. I left out the celery salt because I didn't have any.

I have made this maybe 3 times in the past 2 weeks.. I didn't want to broil it because I wanted time to make sides so I baked it on 400 degrees for 15-20 minutes.  I also had a little left over parmesan miz so I tossed some shrimp in it and put them on the same pan... both absolutely wonderful... a fav for hubby and 2 1/2 year old son! I made it with mashed potatoes, crescent rolls and rice.

Very good and simple.   I didn't have lemon juice, so I used lime juice and it turned out great.  I sprinkled fresh cilantro and 1 chopped roma tomato over it before serving.   My husband really enjoyed it and stated so several times during our meal.       Thanks for the recipe.

my sister showed me this recipe but she makes it even easier.  no butter just the parm, lemon(we use lime) juice and garlic powder. sprinkle the fish with the garlic powder, make a paste of the cheese and juice and spread it on the fish. then bake at 350 for 8 min.  delicious!!

this is the EASIEST thing to make and you'd never know, because it tastes so good!!  I typically make it with a little less fish (1-1.5 lbs), because I like the extra sauce.

This is one of my most loved recipes. I now have it memorized. I add about a quarter tsp of crushed red pepper and use olive oil mayonnaise. Delicious. My mouth is watering just thinking about it.

Loved this!  So easy and quick...here are my adjustments.  In a small skillet, I simmered chopped garlic and fresh chopped basil (instead of dried basil) in 1 tablespoon butter for about 5-6 minutes.  After letting it cool a little, I added this to the mayonnaise mixture.  Didn't feel like going to the store, so I omitted the celery salt, and didn't miss it.  I added a bit more Parmesan, but this is just a personal preference.  I think the original amounts were fine, though some will prefer more or less lemon.  I think the mayo mixture would even be great on a fish sandwich.   This will be my new "go-to" dish when I need something quick and impressive for company!

This was a great recipe! My two year old proclaimed that he loves fish! I will make this again. It doesn't need any changing. It is great the way it is written! The foil also makes for an easy clean up!

this is really good.  we are not big fish eaters, but trying to be. When it was done, I sprinkled some buttered panko on top and put it back under the broiler for added crispiness.  Thanks, i will def. make again.

This recipe really masks the flavor of the fish and does so poorly. I highly recommend many people ditch this recipe and instead season their tilapia with some old bay or lemon pepper, then dredge in flour, then place on foiled pan with tabs of butter on each fish fillet. Bake at 350 for 20 mins. Once done, remove fish to a plate, foil it, and pour the melted butter/fish sauce into a pan, add 1 T butter, 1 T flour, mix on medium heat, add in splash of white wine, juice of 1/2 a lemon, chopped fresh italian parsley and pour over fish. That will knock this recipe out of the water.....forever.

I made this for the first time tonight and was really impressed. I omitted the lime juice, seasoned the fish with old bay seasoning and added 1/2 C. of bread crumbs to the parmesean topping as suggested. I made this with garlic angel hair pasta and cheddar bay buscuits which are also from this site. Great meal!

AWESOME....and I'm not really a seafood eater!!  This was quick, easy, great tasting and economical.  A special thanks to the recipe exchange foodies who suggested I give this recipe a try!  Even my very picky 12 year old ate this!  Looks like Tilapia will become a regular here.

Wow. I can't believe I'm writing this bad review after over 2900 reviewers gave this such a great review. I made two batches of this recipe yesterday. I was so worried that my non-fish eating husnband would like this so I made one batch yesterday for lunch using reviewer "Shannon's" recommendations. I was sorry to say this batch had a very dry consistency and was tough to apply to the fish. With the bread crumbs you had to somehow spoon it on and even then it wouldn't stick to the fish. And the taste was just "ok". So later that night I made another batch and didn't make any modifications to the original recipe. Made it exactly according to the recipe. And I ended up cooking the three filets I had almost tripple the time suggested. The mayo/butter/lemon was sooooo moist it never seemed to get a nice crispyness to it. And the flavor was very mayo-ish. I was sooo hoping for a flaky fish which I know Tilapia can be. I broil it all the time with just a tiny bit of lemon and butter and garlic salt. Or sometimes just with Old Bay Seasoning. I was just hoping to cover up the fish with something my non-fish eating husband would like. He forced it down (for my sake) but later said don't bother with this recipe again. sigh. Sorry but I have to agree with him.

This is always a hit and very yummy, even for my friends who say they don't care for fish. I do add 1/2 c. plain bread crumbs to the topping as one user had suggested & the topping stays on fine when broiling. I serve with a lemon wedge on top & it looks very appealing.

This was incredible.  The best fish I have ever. I used fresh grated parmesan cheese and maybe only 1/4 cup instead of 1/2 plus I used dill instead of basil. Then let it sit in the fridge to firm up. And topped it w/ crushed croutons. It was amazing... My husband told me to make it once a week from now on.

It was good, but too greasy for me.  Maybe a light mayo would have been more to my taste.  The flavor was great, though.

I've never been a fish person at all -- made this recipe for my husband's sake.  Was I ever pleasantly surprised -- it's absolutely delicious (and not "fishy" tasting at all)!  I followed the recipe exactly (except for using celery salt...didn't have any).  I used a jelly roll pan lined with foil (and sprayed with Pam) and started with the vein side up so that it would be right-side up after coating.  My husband was thrilled with this fish and said it was better than a similar tilapia recipe he'd recently had at a nice restaurant.  Served with cole slaw and bowtie pasta (over which we drizzled a little of the sauce from the pan...so yummy).  Thank you very much for this fabulous recipe -- it's going into regular rotation in our household! :-)

What can I say?  There is a reason why this is a top rated recipe...it is delicious!  I used non-fat mayo, fresh basil, and fresh parmesan cheese shreds.  The sauce was a little to runny so I might use less lemon juice next time.  Cooking times were right on.

Fantastic!!  I was out of a few of the seasonings so I used a steak blend (garlic salt, pepper, onion etc) and a bit of cajun seasoning.  It was awesome.  My picky kids really enjoyed it and my husband was blown away by it!  Per my husbands request we will be having this again.

I have to give this 4 stars only because my family loved it so much.  My picky eater husband really liked it, my stepson also loved it.  I thought it was a little salty, but was decent tasting overall.  Quick and easy dinner for sure, throw a few potatoes in the microwave and the fish in the oven and you have a great meal.  Don't forget the salad!

Definitely will try again.

Haven't figured out why the bad reviews. This is great. So easy and fast. Did add a little olive oil and garlic to the fish before initial cooking but took longer possibly because of the type of oven doesn't broil the way you would think. Loved the topping. Used salt and celery seed in place of celery salt. Could def. still tast the fish in a good way. Though if you wanted to mask the fish taste it would be possible.

I have two nephews, ages 5 and 7, who are as picky as they come.  They both loved this recipe, finished all their dinner and asked for seconds.  I highly recommend this for any picky eater.

This was wonderful.  I sprinkled both sides of the fish with Old Bay prior to broiling.  I used Krafts Italian Blends for the cheese. Problems I ran into: My oven has low and high settings on the broiler. Wasn't sure which to use, I went with Low and it turned out to be the right choice. I broiled both sides for 3 minutes.  When I put the cheese on top, the fish was already fully cooked before the cheese had properly melted.  Next time I will decrease the cooking time to 2 minutes per side.  Also, I misread the recipe and use the whole mixture for 2 fillets instead of 4.  Since I served it with Butter & Herb rice, it was a little too buttery tasting after the fact. Next time I will half recipe.  I'm excited to try this again next week, with what I've learned I know it will be even more delicious!

Excellent, quick and easy to make! Needs a kick so I added the following: Start with the dark vein side up, season with Old Bay on both sides. Add the following to the Parmesan mix - 1/2 tsp paprika, 1/4 tsp minced garlic, 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes, 1/2 cup bread crumbs.

This is the tilapia standard in my home.  After using the recipe as-is a few times I decided I didn't like the runniness of the parmesan mixture and took several other reviewers' suggestions and a few of my own:

1/8 t garlic salt instead of celery salt

1/4 t paprika

1/4 t crushed red pepper flakes (slightly under 1/4 due to my finicky family)

1/2 c Italian bread crumbs

Dash of Tabasco sauce

My aunt said it tasted cajun, I say it just tastes good.  If you have sensitive tongues I would reduce the red pepper flakes and omit the Tabasco.  I  am going to substitute the lemon juice with lime next time too and see how it turns out.

This recipe is absolutely delicious and very flavorful! Even my 6 year old who's a picky eater loves it. I also tried this recipe using chicken and it's as equally great. Although I did modify it a little by seasoning the meat first with season all, garlic powder as well as the other seasonings used in the recipe. I also bake the meat vs broiling it. I took some of the other reviewers advice by adding bread crumbs and garlic powder to the cheese mixture, and when time to add it, I turned the oven on broil just to melt the mixture until it starts to turn bubbly golden brown. I love the flavor of the cheese mixture so much that I double up on it. This will be on the menu every week in my home.

I am always leery when it comes to making fish, but this was awesome.  My kids loved it as well.  When I put all 2 lbs of fish in the pan, I thought the amount of sauce that I made was not enough so I doubled it, then after the fish cooked on both sides, it REALLY shrunk, so I was left with a lot of leftover sauce ~ moral of the story, just follow the recipe there is plenty there.  This recipe is super easy and tastes great

Everyone in our family loved this even the picky 13 year old and 9 year old boys.  We used Basa and Tilapia both were good.  Made a very quick, easy and delicious meal.  Paired with instant brown rice, broccoli steamers, and orange slices. GREAT!

This recipe was great. My boyfriend (who is very critical) was so impressed, he actually called his mother to tell her how good it was. I followed the recipe exactly. The fish was flaky and the parmesan topping was  so flavorful. Will definitely make this again.

This was very tasty, quick and a keeper!  I seasoned my fish with Morton's Nature Seasoning first, however.  I would probably use a little less butter next time.  Other than that, I was very pleased.  The sauce would taste good on some vegetables (i.e. broccoli florets).

This is a great recipe. Even my finicky son liked it! I did tweak it a little to add more flavor, I added salt and pepper to the fillets prior to broiling, nonetheless, the whole recipe was a hit in my house.

The best home prepared fish recipe I've ever tried. This is a once per week meal at our house now! It is so cheap and so easy to make compared to most seafood. My husband hates mayonaise and can taste it in anything but he loves this as is.

This is excellent. The sauce goes perfectly with the fish & I like to serve it with veggies (broccoli, cauliflower & carrots) with a little extra sauce. We cook this often. Hubby loves it, I love it.  Years later, I am still making this! We now have 2 boys (ages 3 & 1) who gobble it up! I like to add dill instead of basil. Yum!

This was FABULOUS! Truly a wonderful recipe!  It's so easy and quick to prepare, this will be my new go to recipe when we have company over!  I made this on Sat. night for the first time, my husband said he wished I had made more b/c it was soooo good!  Needless to say, guess what he requested we have for dinner on Monday?  Yup, tilapia again!  Many thanks for such a delicious recipe.  BTW, for those that don't like fish, make it anyway, it doesn't even taste like fish!  :)

We loved this!  Especially my husband.  Better than a restaurant.  Would definitely make it for company.  Used Romano cheese, margarine instead of butter, and Dover sole fillets (I think any white fish would do).  My only regret is that I did not try this sooner!

I have been wanting to try this recipe for some time now!  Hubby and I thought this was great for such a quick meal.  If your tilapia is defrosted this can be on your table in 15 minutes, for that and also being somewhat healthy, and tasty, this is a winner.  I halved the recipe since I only had 1 lb. of filets and it was just the two of us eating, but I think I could have kept the topping amount the same because it spread a little thin.  I did everything that reviewer Shannon;) said to do (she's the first one under most helpful reviews) except I did keep the lemon juice.  We are trying to rotate more fish into our diet to eat healthier, and served this with baked potatoes and steamed green beans, and we felt healthier already! ;)
With 1500+ reviews, you really should try this dish, even if you hate it, its not an expensive or hard dish to prepare.

This was pretty good, but not anything special.  It turned out looking kind of unappetizing.  Maybe I did something wrong.

I usually blacken tilapia, but tried this for a change of pace.  I mixed in some bread crumbs as one reviewer suggested and while my husband thought it was ok...I loved it.  I sent some to my in-laws who thought it was wonderful!!  I thought it would be something you might want to make to impress company...and it's quick, easy...no fuss.  I think I'm going to try it with chicken next.

Delicious.  I didn't have tilapia but sole on hand, still turned out very good. The kids were asking for more!
Will definitely do again, even for company.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This is the best tilapia recipe I have came across! Nothing needs changed it is perfect and take so little time. It has a great parmesan taste and slight tangy flavor. My kids gobbled it up and it is my husbands new favorite!

I made this years ago and then forgot about it. Made it again tonight and am sorry that I dropped it from our rotation- it is delicious! Tilapia is really affordable and the rest of the ingredients are things that I always have on hand. Since the fish cooks so quickly, it was even do-able for a work night.

This was terrific! The only thing I wish I could change would be to have the mixture stick to the fish instead of sliding off.  Taste is wonderful!

As many as have reviewed this I don't have much to add. This is fantastic is about all I can say. They mayo keeps the fish so moist and the blend of cheese and spices is out of this world.

If I could kiss you Phoebe, I would. My husband loves tilapia and he always wants me to get it at the store. I never knew what to do with it UNTIL NOW!!! HOLY MOLY GIRL! This is awesome! To "STEPHERS below, did you broil both sides of the fish first? when you broil it it gets dryer and the mixture should stay in place. Also was your cheese/mayo mixture sort of thick? Try that next time.

Following the recommendations of some here, I did this with chicken for my wife and stuck with the Tilapia for me. I just pounded the chicken breast thin so that it would cook as quickly as the fish. Wonderful!

I'm sorry, but I'm giving this 3*s because the parmesan cheese was too pungent for the delicate fish. My kids don't really like seafood but I can get them to eat it if I devise a nice recipe ( which I have with both crab and prawn) and both of them wouldn't eat past the second mouthfull. It is even too strong for my adult palate. The two flavours didn't merge, but conflicted.

avoid all the fat, and brush the filets with olive oil and mix the cheese and onion powder and the rest of the spices and sprinkle that over the fish

I will definately make this one again - its easy and delicious. My husband hates mayo so I scaled it back a little in fear he would detect the flavor. He loved it and even asked me to make it again.

My husband grew up on the coast and knows his seafood. This is one of his all-time favorite recipes that I've made. It's really easy, too. I've used Grouper and Cod, as that's what we have locally, and always use low fat mayo. I've made it twice for company and they rave. Fantastic!!

This was a great recipe.  Very quick and easy to make.  I brushed olive oil and some lime juice on the filets prior to broiling, and used freshly grated parmesan cheese instead of the canned.  It was wonderful!  Even my 7 year old, who hates fish enjoyed this dish.  Will definitely make again.

This will be my second time making this dish, I lost the recipe and came back to look it up again. My boyfriend LOVED it last time...and when he found out I bought Tilapia today the first thing he said was "Are you gonna make it with the parmesan cheese again?" Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!!!

I must admit that I was very skeptical about this recipe, but with all of the great reviews, I had to try it.  It was absolutely delicious.  I don't think I'll tell people what's on the ingredient list, because it is super-fattening, but the flavor is great.  I'm going to try some of the low-fat versions that some of the other reviewers have written about.  Thanks for the recipe!

Never saw tilapia in the market before today. It looked like beautiful little thin white filets. The butcher said that it was very mild and not fishy. Remembered seeing this recipe so I bought a little piece and tested it on myself for lunch. This was very good and similar to something you'd get in a fancy restaurant. Scaled down the topping and cooked 3 minutes on each side under the broiler and 3 minutes to brown the topping.  This fish really doesn't have much flavor on its own but takes on what is in the topping.  Don't skimp on the topping. If you like garlic (we don't) I can see where so many reviewers added some. I might try a splash of Tabasco next time. If you're not wild about fish but think you should be eating some... I'd recommend this recipe... so easy  and ready in 10 minutes. Thank you Phoebe.

What an awesome culinary delight!  My family loves this dish, especially when we remember to DOUBLE the topping recipe and separate out half of it to use as dipping sauce later.  To cut some of the fat (important when we're using more of the topping!), I use only about half the butter, substitute Miracle Whip Light for the mayo, and add more lemon juice for extra punch!  Only slightly less sumptuous, but still a rich and wonderful combination of flavors.  We've used the same method with other kinds of fish, too, and it always comes out great.  Thanks for sharing this recipe - it's a winner!

DELICIOUS! I used "Just 2 Good" mayo, light margarine, and fresh Parmesan (grated it on a box grater, then chopped it fine in my food processor); cut the recipe in half for 4 fillets...my husband had 2, I shared 1 with my 23-month-old (who wasn't feeling well, but had no trouble eating lots!), and I now have some for my lunch tomorrow! Served it with rice pilaf and a tossed salad. Seasonings were nice & light, didn't overpower the delicate flavor of the fish. A new staple in the ol' recipe box...thanks!

Absolutely fantastic!!  This was one of the easiest, tastiest fish dishes I have come across!  I was over a friend's house who didn't have all the spices called for in the recipe, so I used his All Purpose Italian seasoning, along with the parmesan, mayo, butter, and fresh squeezed lemon.  Delicious!  In 6 minutes, you have a mouth-watering entree!  Be sure to cook extra fish - - people will go back for seconds, thirds!

This was absolutely terrific.  My husband and I loved it and I will make it often.  This would definitely rate as a company dinner.

This was our first attempt cooking tilapia and it was an awesome recipe!  Thank you!  Even my daughter (the fish hater) loved it.

Very easy to make and very tasty, although the topping is a tad on the strong side.  We all enjoyed it very much, however.

Delicious and so easy.  My sister, who is a self-proclaimed fish-hater, built up the courage to try this and ended up eating 2 fillets.  I highly recommend it, though the flavor of the topping might be a little too much for "little ones".

This is an entree you could expect to be served at a five star restaurant! My husband and I loved it.  My young son (who actually likes fish) thought it was a bit too lemony - but his taste buds aren't really mature yet!  Highly recommended!

We really liked it.  To be fair we were out of lemons so we substituted various vinegar: Apple white and rice.  Let the oven heat up for awhile so the cheese browned very quickly.  Next time I would try cutting the butter in half or less a third.

It was awesome! I did not have any celery salt so I used garlic powder and paprika. Also seasoned the filets with Mrs. Dash prior to cooking. Served with Angel Hair Parmesan pasta. Loved it.

Yummy- I substituted in about 1/2 the amount of olive oil for the butter. I only had about 1/2 the required cheese as well. With both changes the sauce was thin but very tasty.

So quick, easy and yummy!  I followed the recipe, but did not add the basil.  Next time I will probably cut down the butter used.  My husband really enjoyed it as well, I definitely recommend!

I applied the batter to both sides BEFORE it went into the oven. I didn't feel like taking the fish out three times in 10 mins since I was cooking quite a few other things and I was broiling on a grate. I only flipped the fish once and put a bit more batter onto the new side. I was very happy with the results. I was worried when I smelled the batter that the lemon was going to be too strong; I'm not a huge fan of lemon. However, to my surprise, it was delicious and the lemon flavor was not necessarily subtle but very smooth and the rich creamy texture was amazing.

Made it with Pollock fish.  I altered mixture by using one avocado instead of mayo, garlic salt instead of equal amounts of celery salt & onion powder.
Broiled on high mostly thawed 5 min on each side.  Then added mixture broiled 5 min turned over, repeated.    
It was so good & family asked for it again the next night!

This is so delicious.  I use cod instead of tilapia because I try to avoid farmed fish.  I think this recipe would work with any flaky white fish, though.  It's very quick and easy.  Definitely a keeper!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  It was a quick and easy after work dinner.  I followed the spirit of the recipe but I exchanged the seasonings to Old Bay, which is what I had on hand.  I served it with some sautéed zucchini and a salad.  Very tasty and quick.

This is an amazing 5 star tilapia recipe that was super easy to make. My husband who dislikes fish really enjoyed this recipe and that says a lot. The topping was super flavorful and went wonderfully with the tilapia. I only added a little garlic powder and paprika as someone else suggested. Regular mayonnaise worked here just as well. This was marvelous and will be added to my recipes hall of fame. Thanks for sharing.

My fiance loves this dish. I am pretty sure she is marrying me for the tilapia! I make this once a week now, on what is now dubbed Tilapia Tuesdays. The Parmesan sauce is just awesome. I normally double this recipe.

I am novice when it comes to Tilapia, not sure why because I cook salmon all the time, I guess other fish intimidate me lol. Which is really silly. Anyways, bought some tilapia, needed something to make it tasty. This was it! The combination of parmesan and herbs plus lemon juice, is really very good. I was really surprised how fast and easy this was, as I used the broiler for the first time in my entire life. (our broiler has a bottom drawer, it's a gas oven and I have never used it, we're renting so I never thought of using it especially when most normal broilers are IN the oven on the top, above the shelf) I definitely will use this recipe again and the broiler!

Excellent!  I threw this together for my son with some tilapia I had n the freezer, when the rest of us were having homemade pizza (he is the only person in the world that I know who doesn't like pizza).  It was really good!  He ate the entire pan (and he's 8 years old)!

The whole family love it. Its only downside is that it does not keep as well as when its freshly baked.

3.5 stars for me. 
So here is the deal...I personally like fried fish much better, im sort of the classic fish and chips kind of a person. I did make this several times though for my ex wife as she does not like fried. I have to say it was pretty darn good. It's quick and easy and I think most people that are not die hard fried fish fans like myself will really enjoy it. I think the author made a good choice in fish for the dish but any of the cold water white fishes will certainly do well also.

Perfect. Just season fish with Old Bay prior to broiling like the other reviewers suggest. I added some garlic powder and used miracle whip instead of mayo. I also doubled the seasoning.

Great Recipe.  My only addition was to sprinkle plain Panko crumbs on at the end and broil for 2-3 additional minutes.

Good and simple.  My only criticism is that the topping runs off the fish.  But it makes a simple meal delicious.

From the mouth of the pickiest eater on the planet whom I have not seen eat fish since fish sticks when he was a toddler (he is 22 now) "you should cook fish all the time."  What???  I have to admit, this is the ONLY way I'll cook tilapia from now on!  I followed the suggestions by adding: garlic salt, paprika, celery seeds, Old  Bay to the fillets and panko bread crumbs at the lat minute to the topping mixture.  Veery thin filets, 2 mins on each side and then added topping until brown and so appetising looking!

Amazing recipe. Pretty easy and fast. Additional tips: (1) Have fun mashing the mixture with your hands, which will warm it up and make it easier to spread on the fish. (2) Watch the fish under the broiler because it's easy to overcook it. If the fish is very close to the element, two minutes tops each side before adding the topping. (3) Not too much mayonnaise or it will come out too sour. (4) Don't take it out of the broiler until the topping has a nice golden color with some brown spots.

I don't mind when people give reviews of a recipe they made changes to as long as they are fair about it. "I boiled my grilled cheese sandwich instead of grilling it and it was terrible, so I gave this recipe 1 star". Ok, not cool. But advice from people who have tried the recipe many times and added to it is great. I have come to my best ideas based on not just the recipes, but the thoughts and ideas of reviewers on this site. I made the topping for this recipe exactly as specified and tasted it before putting it on my tilapia. It was really good! Then I took some of Shannon's suggestions and made it even better. Kept everything like the recipe, but added 1/4 teaspoon each of garlic powder and paprika. This took the recipe from over 4 stars to a 5. Ether way it was delicious, but to be fair I am giving the original recipe a 4.75. Would definitely make it that way again but love it even more with the slight changes. Thanks to both Phoebe and Shannon for making me a movie star tonight. This is my absolute favorite fish dish ever. Everyone loved it!

Restaurant quality fish. I lightly sprinkled both side with Old bay too. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. Didn't have a problem with the topping coming off. Very pretty results too.  I'm going to try fresh trout sometime with this recipe. I know they say no cheese with fish...but this works folks. Tip: Spray pan with pan coating.

Love this recipe! It is so easy and delicious. I have made it a couple of times and it's always a crowd pleaser. The only variation I use is to sub sour cream for the mayo and I season the fish prior to broiling on both sides. Very yummy! Both times I did have pools of butter on my pan so I'll be cutting the the butter down a tablespoon or two.

Delicious!  We love fish, but tilapia has usually left me cold - it's a little too mild-flavored.  This topping adds a lot of flavor.  I took the suggestions of adding onion and garlic powder, also panko (less than 1/2 cup), and sprinkled on a little bit of Old Bay while broiling the fish before putting on the topping.  We'll be having this again!

Recipe as-is 4 stars. Simply adding panko to the topping takes this to 5 stars and up! Will probably make it without lemon juice next time, or maybe a little less. All in all, this is very good and I'm thankful for delicious fish recipes like this!

This was GREAT for a night that I didn't want to spend too much time fussing about with dinner. Tastes amazing. The only alteration I made was to sprinkle just a bit of garlic & herb Old Bay on the fish as it broiled. This goes in the monthly dinner rotation for sure! Thank you!

this was so easy and flavorful.  I didn't have any talapia so I made it with cod and it was perfect.  The cod was thicker so it had to cook longer but came out wonderful.  other than that followed the recipe exact! thanks for sharing

My family loved the combination of herbs and Parmesan cheese. Make sure you really blend the mayonnaise and softened butter so it is easy to spread on the fish.  Next time, I think I will just try the herbs, Parmesan cheese, and mayo.

It good, would I say it's great no, but I would make it again. It's a good recipe for those that aren't crazy about fish becaues the sauce overpowers the fish taste.  Personally I like fish but still enjoyed the sauce.  I made it exactly as called for and don't understand the rantings of some of the other review of calories or butter flavor.  It's not something I would make every week but I would definitely make again.

this is a great way to eat Talapia, its fast & so delicious...Since I am on a low fat diet , I cut out the mayo & used a little olive oil instead, I didn't use any basil.. After I broiled the Talapia , I added the Parmesan spread mix cooked it for 5 more minutes... took it out put it over whole wheat spaghetti noodles.. MMMMMMMMMMMMMM it was delicious...

I make this dish fairly often and leave the butter out altogether.  Regular mayo has enough fat in it already.  I also use fresh basil and leave out the celery salt.  I've never flipped the fillets either and each time they have turned perfectly. The original recipe is a fantastic base!!!

My husband and I LOVE this recipe! We've even used it on chicken (pan searing the chicken first) and it was great. Paired with whole wheat pasta and some good veggies, this makes a great meal!

I loved this recipe, I've made it twice now and there have never been any leftovers! 
I didn't use 2 lbs of tilapia, but I did use the original measurements of all the other ingredients so that I had extra topping for my tilapia. YUM!

I gave this recipe a 3 because I was the only one in my family who liked it.  Everyone else scraped the topping off.  I followed the recipe as written.  Update:  I tried this again and decreased the amount of mayo and cheese and everyone liked it.

My husband and I love this recipe!  It's surprisingly quick and easy to prepare.  My supermarket didn't have tilapia so I used flounder instead and it came out wonderful.  I added another 2 tbs of parm because I didn't think I'd have enough to cover the fish and I'm glad I did.  I broiled them exactly 2m-2m-2m and the parm came out perfect, a little burnt.  I will definitely be making this often.

This was awesome. I added 1/4 tsp Garlic powder and Paprika.  I did not use any garlic celery. Before broiling the tilapia I sprinkled Old Bay on each side after flipping.  I did not use any cheese.

A bit too much sauce, which also needed to cook longer once applied. Overall, a good dish that I paired with rice and brussel spouts.

4.5 stars; I did not use celery salt or lemon juice.  I added 1/4 bread crumbs, 1/4 tsp paprika, and 1/4 garlic powder.  Sauce was very strong.  Next time I wouldn't use as many bread crumbs, would not add the paprika, and would add lemon juice.  VERY EASY TO MAKE.  I did not flip the fish.  I broiled (hi) about 4 mintues without sauce and 1 minute with the sauce.  TRIED IT A SECOND TIME: 5 STARS now- I added 1/8 cup of bread crumbs and 1/4 tsp garlic powder.  Added the lemon juice and didn't use the paprika.  Will make this frequently!

Awesome, awesome recipe. I like it as written, but when I make this now I apply the following changes. I skip the butter, use olive oil mayo, add 3 cloves of minced fresh garlic, double the lemon juice and skip the celery salt which I think has an odd flavor in this dish. Any way you jazz it up to your taste you got try it!

Best tilapia ever, used shredded parmessan cheese because that's what I had and it turn out really good.  If you are going to use shredded instead of grated make sure to double the recipe.  Thanks!

I just made this last night, and loved it! I followed the recipe exactly, making 4 servings. I did think it was just a touch salty, so if you want to reduce that you could probably try celery seed instead of the salt, like other reviewers have mentioned. Oh, and I used the dry grated parmesan from a can, even though I wasn't sure if that was correct. It does cover up the flavor of the fish, so if you like the taste of fish it may not be for you. Luckily, I like the texture of fish a lot more than the taste, so this was wonderful.

I thought that this was awesome! I cut back on the butter after reading another review and it worked out wonderfully. I also added old bay seasoning and used garlic powder instead of celery salt. I added some cayenne pepper in there because at my house we like the heat =)

Just amazing!! I've tried (and failed) to cook fish many times. Typically, either the flavor overpowers the fish, or the flavor is overly fishy and I haven't been able to find the perfect balance...until NOW! I didn't change one thing in this recipe and have shared it with many of my friends. Thank you!

Very good! I grilled these and instead of the Parmesan setting up into a crust, it stayed as a really delicious butter. Thanks! I even used some of the extra butter on asparagus as a side.

This was excellent, I did make some changes due to the fact that we watch our fat and calorie intake. I seasoned the fish with a small amount of Sazon on both sides and broiled for 3 minutes. I then flipped the filets and topped with a small amount of chipotle mayo (fat free mayo mixed with chipotle and adobo) some garlic and onion powders and then just sprinkled some parm on top and returned to the broiler. I used very little mayo and skipped the butter all together, it was very good.

I've made this several times now and can't get enough! I usually cut the lemon juice in half or don't add it all because it usually comes out too sour. Adding bread crumbs makes the dish perfect because all the topping stays on top and gives it a very attractive browned look.

This is my fav! I make it so much I don't even need to look at the recipe anymore. I have also shared this recipe so many times and everyone I make it for loves it.  Even had a dinner guest that didn't eat fish (didn't know this until after dinner) and she liked it! I switch out the spices just depending on how I feel that day.  It's a great recipe and great to play with after you have made it the 'right' way a few times! If you are looking for a tilapia recipe, YOU HAVE FOUND IT!

Love this recipe! Very flavorful & not 'fishy' at all as long as you cook it long enough.  Added bread crumbs since the sauce tends to run off as it heats up. Have made this every other week or so for the past year, with Lemon Rice Pilaf also from this site. Yum!

Update:I got over it and made this as is and it is wonderful. I still have to use real onion! Very good! Before I I subbed lite sour cream for the butter. I also minced about a tablespoon of onion instead of using powder. Hubs really liked it and he's not a big fish eater, said he's like to have it again! Thank you!!

Awesome recipe!  Want to eat more fish and didn't have a clue how to cook it.  Made it just like it says except didn't have time to flip, it was very thinly sliced and cooked so fast!  It was good and crispy around the edges after 7 min.  Will make it again although I will try to cut out some fat with low fat mayo and maybe no butter because the butter was just left in the pan anyway. Delish fish!

LOVE THIS RECIPE!!! I love how it was VERY easy to make and it only takes a few mins to cook the fish. I didn't have onion powder on hand so I used garlic powder instead. I would take some people's advice and add bread crumbs on top to give it a crisp.

Delicious!!! This is amazing and so easy! The only thing I changed was I left out all the spices and added Old Bay seasoning and Garlic, I also added some Panko bread crumbs and sprayed it with Pam to give it a yummy crunch! We will be making this over and over again! I paired this with Lemon Pasta Sauce from this site. It tasted like a restraunt!

I made the original recipe and it was a bit too acidic for my husband and son. I didn't care for the celery seed seasoning. So the next time I only used 1 1/2 tsp lemon juice and substituted garlic powder for the celery seasoning and it was a consensus- delicious. Also, my broiler has two settings; I did mine on high for about 3 mins, flipped, ~3 mins, put parmesan sauce on, in for about 2 mins and it was perfect. My filets were about 1" thick. Will definitely make again with the few alterations. Thank you for a great recipe.

Absolutely delicious! Was a great hit at dinner time. As suggested added a little paprika and crushed red peppers and it was delicious. This is a recipe that we now eat quite often. : ) I like to serve it with a simple pasta and biscuits to absorb the remaining sauce.

I have made the dish twice, the first time I followed the directions exactly and the second time I followed other reviewers recommendations and added paprika, red pepper, garlic powder, and breadcrumbs (gluten free) and I really like the kick that it gives to the recipe.

I made this for the second time, I forgot that I had made it before.  I only gave it 3 stars the first time and I have no idea why.  I found it delicious and followed the recipe almost exactly (I didn't have celery salt and used seasoned salt instead).

This is super easy and takes close to no effort! I add a little extra parmesan because I'm a cheese addict!

I've made this recipe a dozen times before attempting to write a review.  In a word - awesome!!    Ingredients are readily available in your kitchen.  Dish preparation time is minimal and the taste, oh the taste, phenomenal.  I've deviated from the recipe by adding 1/4 teaspoon of Sneaky Pete hot sauce to the Parmesan cheese toping.    Tilapia prepared this way is much tastier than breading & frying.  Better for you too I suspect.

My husband is NOT a tilapia fan.  I found this wonderful recipe and made it for dinner tonight.  It was fantastic!  Thank you so much for sharing this delicious recipe.  I used light mayo and celery seeds because I didn't have celery salt.

This fish was delicious!!  I was in a pickle as to what to make for dinner and figured fish cooks fast so chose my tilapia. Then I found this recipe. 1st, since my oven was broken, I could not broil it. I cooked it in my roaster on 350 for 20 minutes. 2nd, I did not have celery salt so I used regular salt.  The only reason I gave it a four is because I prefer stronger flavors in my food and this was more mild. Maybe the celery salt would have made a difference and, when I make this again, I'll try it. If it makes the difference, I'll change my rating.

Very good. This recipe is simple to make and even better...quick! For some reason my Parmesan mixture slid right off my fish. I probably missed something...I just folded up the foil. Made sure that dressing wasn't going anywhere  :P

My husband liked the flavor, but I modified it.  I actually left the mayo out completely simply because I don't keep any in the house.  I added a little olive oil to the mixture.  I actually divided the recipe by 4 (so as to serve 2 people) and spread it over 4 tilapia fillets.  Next time, I will make a little more topping because I didn't have quite enough to spread evenly.

Best meal I've made in a while.  Quick and delicious and pretty healthy.  Made it with the greek salad recipe and sweet potato fries.  We inhaled it.  Wasn't pretty to watch but it's the truth!

This was a super fast and delicious recipe even for a non-fish eater like myself and my three year old son. Next time I'll decrease the amount of butter as I found a lot of butter left over in the pan.

This was very good.  The fish stayed moist and the topping was a nice compliment to the tilapia.  I made exactly as the recipe states, but, I seasoned the fish with salt and pepper and added some cayenne to the parmesan topping.

We love this in our house! I read reviews and added bread crumbs to the cheese mixture, cut the lemon juice in half and added red pepper flakes. So delicious and you can modify it in so many ways! Thanks for the recipe!!

What a great alternative to fried fish!!  We have recently began to eat fish about twice a month because of recipes like yours.  I broiled 3 minutes per side, and 2 1/2 minutes after putting the topping on these, and they turned out perfect!!  Will be using this recipe often,Thanks for sharing!!

Easy, cheap and quick!  Adding some toasted bread crumbs or Italian bread crumbs to the parmesan mixture really thickens up the topping and adds texture.

We just ate this for dinner and it was AWESOME!  I made it healthier by using Smart Balance Lite instead of butter, and Kraft Olive Oil Mayo, I omitted the onion salt and used garlic powder in it's place and used fresh basil.  I only had Kraft Parm Cheese and used that, along with the other ingrediants.  Served with green beans & almonds and orzo on the side.  I will make this again and again.  Next time I'll try freshly grated parm cheese.

Good recipe.  I am amazed at how many diners want mild-tasting fish that "doesn't taste like fish".  I love fish and enjoy the varying tastes of different types of fish.  Tilipia is a mild fish whose taste could get masked under too much or too overpowering ingredients.  This is a good recipe because it doesn't 'drown' the tilapia's mildness.

I really enjoyed this and will definitely be making again.  The only thing I changed was that I dredged the fish in Parmesan (the kind in the shaker bottle) prior to cooking so that it would have a crispy "crust".

Amazingly excellent. I cut the mayo and butter down by half as others have suggested (just to cut down on the calories) and used light mayo. This is such a quick dinner, but tastes like something you'd order at your favorite seafood place. Served it with pesto pasta on the side.  My husband said it melts in your mouth.  I agree!

Wonderful!  My mother (who hates seafood) marked this dinner as one for the records, as it was her FIRST time ever voluntarily going back for a second helping of fish!  I made some minor changes based on what was in the cubbard and previous reviews.  Because of what I had on hand, I omited the celery salt and halved the lemon juice.  I added a few tablespoons of bread crumbs (1/4 of a piece of dried bread - crushed), because of previous reviews.  It was a wonderful addition to the texture.  I only had 1.5 lbs. fish, so the extra sauce I poured around the fish (on the aluminum foil) and it browned beautifully.   I used margerine instead of butter and light mayo made with olive oil, as it was what I had.  Results still excellent.  This was my first time making fish, and it was a hit!  Thank you so much.

I made this last night. DH and I are on the Mediterranean Diet so I made some substitutions for the butter (olive oil) and the Mayo (Miracle Whip lite). Incorporating fish 2x a week into our diet has been a challenge since we are not big fish eaters but this recipe is a keeper!!  The substitutions worked great!  Super easy to make also.  A keeper for sure!

This recipe was delicious!! I will definitely be making this again! I halved the recipe, because of my small family and I used reduced fat mayonnaise and Promise butter to save on the calories and omitted the celery salt (I didn't have any), and it was still wonderful! Excellent flavor!

Holy Guacamole.....this is so delicious!  Wonderful taste and delicate texture.  I am a fish lover, while my wife normally hates fish.  Consequently (as you may guess), getting a fish entree in our home during our 35 year marriage has been a super rare occasion.  Now, she LOVES this recipe too, and I am one happy guy!

We loved this dish!  The cheese mixture was a perfect touch without overpowering the flavor of the fish.  I made 4 fillets for 3 of us and we were sad that we needed to split that last one 3 ways.  Could have easily made more and we wouldn't have had any leftovers.  I thing the fresh parmesan was the key.

What a beautiful recipe!  My husband loved it, and my kids (8, 6, 2, and 1) ate it, but it wasn't their favorite.  I'm happy that they ate fish, though!  I used sour cream instead of mayo, and that was good. I thought for sure the topping was going to slide right off of the fish, but it didn't.  It was a very pretty dish to serve!

A friend gave me a copy of this recipe. I told her I am an allrecipes subscriber so I would try it. I am a big fish lover. I made it last evening and was pleased with the tasty, moist results. hubby does not like parmesan, but did enjoy the sauce after all. I served it with buttered, parslied egg noodles, corn bread and steamed sugar snap peas. a deniate keeper! Oh yes, I did buy some fresh Old Bay seasoning and used a bit of Lawry's seasoned salt and garlic powder. 2 die for.

WOW! This is an excellent recipe! Just a few minor change-ups. I did sprinkle the fish with Old Bay seasoning, added the 1/2 t each of paprika and garlic powder, used shredded Parm vs grated shaker type, a pinch of cayenne and 1/3 cup Panko bread  crumbs stirred into the topping mixture as other reviewers suggested. These were to die for! The topping gave the tender moist fish a nice light crispy texture. I will definitely use this many times! Thanks for sharing!

This was such an easy, delicious way to cook fish!  I could eat this once a week.  I did take add panko bread crumbs as suggested by others, but made no other changes.

I absolutly love this recipe!  Since I've discovered I've made it at least once a week because it is so quick easy and delicious.  I took other reviewers advice and dust both sides of the tilapia with Old Bay seasoning and always use the butter / mayo combo and use whatever spices I'm feeling that night, garlic, onion, celery salt, basil, parsley - really whatever I grab first.  I've also found that adding just a a teaspoon or so of breadcrubs helps the sauce stay on the fish better.  Thanks for such a great and versatle recipe.

My husband and I both thought this dish was delicious!  I did use a bit of old bay, husband's favorite spice with fish, just a dash of paprika and a dash of bread crumbs on the top of the parm mix to help hold it on the fish.  Awesome, we will be making this one again and again!

I cooked this last night and my husband and I LOVED it. NOTE: Look at Shannon's review under 'most helpful'. I took others advice and used her changes and it made the world of difference. I will definitely be making this again. Best tilapia recipe I have ever used.

Sooooooo good.....I mixed up the topping ingredients, and threw in about 1/4 c breadcrumbs...once on the fish, I sprinkled about a tsp on each fillet just for crunch...the cooking time was perfect, and the taste was amazing.

Awesome! To keep with our low fat/low cal way of life I made a few changes. I didn't mix the topping ahead of time, just spread a dab of FF mayo on each filet and then sprinkled the spices (lemon pepper instead of lemon). Topped with fresh grated parmesan and spritzed with spray butter! I will make this one often, everyone loved it!

OH MY!!! This was soooo freakin good!!!  I only use 1 tbls. lemon juice and my broiler isnt working so I put it at 450 for 10 mins. I Also made this 2 ways bcuz I was curious how each would taste. I sprincled some Italian breadcrumbs on the first 2 fillets. The other 2 I mixed in some imatation crab meat with the sauce. OMG I couldnt choose which one I liked better. They both were amazing!! There are alot of diff possiblities with this recipe BUT Ive found mine!! Thank you soo much.

Updated Rating April 12th, 2009  I made this about 10 times since my first rating.  I have to change my rating to 5 stars!! the first time was my first time making fish and I didn't do a good job.  When I made this I put the topping on the raw fish and popped it in the oven.  I didn't broil it or nothing.  It came out just "ok" but the second time I made it I read the recipe more throughly.       Okay, so I made this tonight and I made a mistake- I used miracle whip this time thinking I could change it up a bit.  NO! don't use miracle whip! It completely takes away from the taste of the fish and parmesan cheese.  You already add in lemon juice for "tang" so the miracle whip doubles the "tang" way to much.  It was hard to enjoy this fish tonight.  Just thought i'd give all you cookers out there a heads up...:)

I was looking for the perfect tilapia recipe today and now I've found it.  This was an outstanding recipe.  It was tangy and absolutely delicious.  I didn't have any celery salt on hand, but I used the rest of the ingredients mentioned.  I also used an Italian cheese blend because I didn't have any parmesean cheese alone.  In addition, I lightly seasoned both sides of the tilapia with Old Bay Lemon & Herb Seasoning.  I will definitely make this again.

Great Recipe, added 1/2 cup breadcrumbs, and replaced the butter with olive oil. Came out terrific and because you only spread it on one side it doesn't overpower the taste of the tilapia (i like tasting what food i'm eating)

This was great! I made some replacements in the recipe because I didn't have some of the ingrediants. Added garlic salt and omitted celery salt. Used 1 TBSP Malt viniger and omitted lemon juice. The acids can change as long as one keeps in mind the strength and retains the correct ratios. WAY GOOD! YUMM!.

Yummy, Yummy, Yummy! I've now made this SEVERAl times and I've done it with a variety of fish - Tilapia, Catfish, and now Redfish. I do season w/ Old Bay or Tony's first and just adjust the time as needed for the thickness of the fish. Usually I also throw in a handful of breadcrumbs, BUT this weekend I decided to use Panko crumbs instead - OH MY! Perfection!!!! It really added a nice crispiness to the coating! Try it!! Mmmmm Mmmm Mmm!!!!

Pretty good recipe.  I added some finely chopped almond to the topping and marinated the tilapia in some lemon pepper sauce and spices to make sure it didn't taste fishy.    It was great.  I had problems with the timing of broiling, because I didn't move the fish close enough to the broiler heat, but once I did that, it cooked faster.

Absolutely delicious are the only two words I can think to discribe this dish.  We're not a "fish eating" family, so to find a recipe that everyone liked was a miracle.  My mother-in-law who lives with us is recovering from open heart surgery and fish is recommended for her to eat weekly.  I modified this recipe to make it more "heart friendly" by using low fat mayonnaise and Promise spread instead of the butter.  It was received so well at our dinner table last evening that I sent a copy of the recipe with her to her cardiac rehab classes to share with the dietitian, nurses, and other patients in her class.

This was SO good!  
I used light mayo and Bremmel & Brown in place of the butter.  The only other change I made was garlic powder instead of the onion powder because I didn't have onion.  I can't believe how easy and wonderful this was!!  I will make this again.

Quick, easy, and absolutely yummy!  I have made this at least 10 times and every time I make it I always get compliments. I have tried it using margarine and low fat mayo and it's still tasty!  I even tried salmon once and it was delicious!

Yum! Let me just say that they only real reason this is getting a 4 out of 5 is because I think it's a crime to not use dill for seafood, especially if you are using a citrus element. That said, though, this was a fantastic recipe and easily a 5 star with dill replacing the basil. It melts in your mouth, it's rich, delicious and easy.

Very Good. First time I had Tilapia. Just made a few changes, added Italian bread crumbs, light mayo and light butter and left out the lemon juice. I also used my own seasonings in the parmesan mixture. It was delicious will be making it again!

This was so easy and so good. TIP: If you find your fish ever has a slight "metal" taste to it, try using parchment paper instead of foil.

This was delicious! My husband said this was the best fish I've ever made! I added extra butter and crushed up some garlic flavored triscuits into the topping. It was wonderful that way! I served it with some microwaved rice with some butter, salt & pepper on top and roasted asparagus spears with garlic. I leave the fish in until the topping is a little golden. It comes out a little crispy and we love it that way.

I absolutely love this recipe. I did alter it based on some of the other reviewers comments per below:

Use celery seed rather than celery salt. Add 1/2 tsp. paprika, 1/4 tsp. garlic powder and 1/4 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes. I use the Olive Oil Mayo that's better for you. Add some panko bread crumbs to the cheese mixture. 

And I double the entire sauce mixture just because I like more toppings. This is restaurant quality fish!

The recipe was okay... Seeing how highly rated the recipe was, I actually expected it to come out better.

I cooked the fish a couple minutes less than the time called for in the recipe, but it still came out overcooked.

Thankfully it was just overcooked, and not burned. It was still edible. The spread that went on the fish could've been more flavorful. It came out rather bland. Not sure if I'll use this recipe again. Not that it was horrible - it was just nothing impressive.

Just tried this last night with only 2 Tilapia loins.  I scaled back the sauce  without measuring but used the ingredients listed (used celery seed instead of celery salt).  Fantastic 
flavor. The parmesan gives it wonderful flavor. Make sure you use REAL parmesan cheese, not the stuff in the green can.  I will be using this recipe over and over again.

mmmmm.. Yummy. Followed the recipe as written and it was delicious.  15-20 minutes of work.  Very simple.  The tilapia was moist and the parmesan toasted a nice golden-brown. Definately will repeat this one.

Fantastic for my husband, who eats fish because he should, not because he actually likes it.  I made this, a side of steamed broccoli, and some buttered egg noodles and it looked really pretty and fancy for all the ease of preparation.  I used really fresh Parmesan and basil, used celery seed instead of celery salt because the cheese is salty enough.  I sprinkled a bit of paprika at the end for color, but that was totally unnecessary as the fish was really tangy and flavorful as is.

I did not intentionally set out to spruce up this recipe. I thought I had all of the ingredients that the recipe called for, but I barely had any of them!!! So I kept improvising...I did not have tilapia, I had whiting. I did not have lemon juice, I used apple cider vinegar. No Basil, I used dried parsley. No celery salt, I used a dash of celery seed. The only ingredients that matched the recipe were Mayo, butter(unsalted), and parmesan cheese. I followed the broiling instructions and placed the "paste" on the fish...I decided to sprinkle a scant coating of Italian bread crumbs and sesame seeds on top. The fish tased great! The bread crumbs made a light crunchy crust. Every bite I ate , I was pleasantly surprised. It seems to me, that the basic broiling instructions paired with your own paste concoction, can make a really nice fish dinner.

This is an awsome recipe. The best fish i've ever made. But beware! If the filets are thin, skip the second step. after cooking the fish for 3 minuts, flip them and dont cook them for "another few minuts" flip them and immediatly put the seasoning on. Cook the for 3 more minuts and serve. They will be juicy and PERRRRFECT!

This is a delicious fish recipe! You can really make it with any kind of white flaky fish there is. If you want to make the topping a little more fancy, mix in fresh crab meat it will taste like a million bucks. Also if you have a hard time getting fresh fish, soak your fish fillets in milk for a couple of hours in the refrigerator, this helps reduce the fishy taste/smell.

This is the only tilapia recipe I have tried...and, quite honestly, I have no desire to try any other.  How can you improve on perfection?  I am looking forward to trying it on other fish varieties and will include this recipe in our monthly menu!  In the words of my dh - "IT'S THE BOMB!"

Delicious.  Rave reviews all around. I used Smart Balance Light instead of butter, and light mayo; added 1/2 c. Italian flavor bread crumbs, 1/2 tsp. garlic powder, and sprinkled Old Bay on each side of the fish before broiling.  Even my fish-hating husband likes this one!

VERY tasty tilapia!  I didn't have celery salt, so I substituted garlic salt.  Also used reduced fat mayo and freshly grated parmesan reggiano.  The end result was amazing.  So much (non-fishy) flavor!

Update:  Switch to 5 stars.  My husband now loves this dish and asks for it, which is rare.  Very tasty!

Very tasty and simple recipe.  Uses ingredients that I usually have in the kitchen.  Even my husband, who HATES mayo thought it was wonderful. Oh, and I also seasoned the fillets beforehand with some garlic and herb Old Bay seasoning. Mmmmm, delicious... And so low carb too! Thanks for this recipe, I'm sure I'll make it often!

This was delicious, I used Cod and added more Basil, I actually used the basil that comes in a tube, I used 1 tbsp of Basil and added 3 tablespoons of Italian Bread Crumbs.  Excellent, my husband loved it.  I am putting this one in the favorites file.

I made this for dinner last night and my bf and I both LOVED it. I've never liked tilapia any other way than fried but this is my new favorite. For those who hated it I think maybe they used the parmesan that you sprinkle on pizza or spaghetti. If you use the "shredded" it makes a delicious topping. I used fresh basil (just double) and was wishing I had made more than one filet each. This will definitely go in to my rotation. Plus, it's so quick. Asian coleslaw on the side and we had a taste bud extravaganza going on. Delicious!!

This was wonderful!!  I decreased the Mayo to 1.5 Tbs (used Light) and the butter to 2 Tbs (used I can't believe it's not butter Light).  This made it a little healthier and it was soooo good.

The flavor was lovely, the topping was a little runny so we'll add breadcrumbs next time, even so . . . excellent taste and I had 2 servings.  My 18 month old liked it and mostly eats veggies (doesn't like meat). We served with Garlic/Marsala/Red Pepper couscous.  Easy and quick.  Thanks for the recipe!

I guess I'll add my 5-star rating to the host of others for this exceptional dish. This is my first time preparing tilapia, and my hubby only likes fried fish, so I was a little apprehensive about what he would think. He declared it a winner! I was impressed with the taste of the topping with the delicate flavor and firm yet buttery texture of the fish. Loved it!

This was awful - I made it twice, with the same bad results.

The sauce overppowered the fish.

I made this recipe tonight for the first time, and my husband and I absolutely loved it. I've tried tilapia a number of different ways, and it's always bland. This is by far the best tilapia recipe I've ever made. I used Miracle Whip Light instead of mayo, and I left out the celery salt because I didn't have any. I will be making this again soon!

Pretty Good! as a rule, I can't stand the flavor of cooked mayo on fish. So to get around this, I subsituted. Instead of 3 tablespoons of mayo, I used 1 tablespoon of mayo and two tablespoons of sourcream. Excellent! I also sprinkled some paparika on the fish before the final broiling for added color and apeal. Next time I do this recipe I will add some garlic powder to the party and after broiling, I will toss some chives or green onions on top for a perfect garnish.

I have to add that I made this again since my mom and daughter loved it so much, my dad who is super picky about my cooking raved about how moist the fish was and loved the flavor! Thanks again for such a wonderful recipe, I would give it 10 stars if I could!

This was delicious.  My husband hates for me to cook fish. He is just not a 'fish' person.  Tilapia was on sale & I had seen this recipe so I bought some.  He LOVED IT and asked me to BUY MORE FISH!  Can you believe it??? I did as others suggested and sprinkled the fillets with a little Old Bay before broiling.  I also added some breadcrumbs to the topping and then lightly sprinkled some on top.  Amazing.  This was a truly quick & easy weeknight recipe that looked & tasted like it was from a restaurant.  You've got to try it!!

Finally got around to trying this tonight (had to see what all the fuss was about!), and it was really incredible! I'm not a big fish fan (I'll eat it for the health value, but don't love it), but the topping made this a new family favorite...even my 3 yr. old ate it up! I modified a little by cutting the butter by about half, seasoning the fish itself before broiling with coarse salt/cracked pepper, and adding a little thyme to the topping mixture instead of the basil/celery salt. Served with multi-grain rice and steamed broccoli/cauliflower so I wouldn't feel so guilty about the mayo and the butter. lol We'll definitely be making this again...thanks for the recipe!

A little suggestion for this wonderful revipe: I think in order to not overcook the fish it would be better to flip it only once and cover with parmesan mixture.  I would also take less butter.

I followed Shannon's suggestion and added bread crumbs (I used roasted garlic, all I had on hand), paprika, garlic powder and red pepper flakes.  I also sprinkled the filets with Old Bay on each side as suggested.  This was one of the best fish dishes I have ever had, let alone prepared myself.  I don't have very many fish dishes in my repertoire that I feel comfortable with, but this was so easy and as long as you watch your times for the broiler, a no-fail dish.  This will definitely be added to our regular rotation.  I can't wait to make it again!

This was great!  Kids loved it too.  It even turned out without the parmesan in the sauce (food allergies)-- though with it was much better!  The first time I tried this was with fresh tilapia.  Liked it so much, I bought a bag of frozen individually-wrapped fillets.  There was a huge difference in quality and flavor.  Next time, I will only buy fresh.

Just had this for dinner tonight.  I'd never prepared tilapia before - thanks to this recipe it'll definitely become a staple meal in our home.  It was so easy to make, just follow the recipe.  I cut the recipe in half and it worked great.  I'll probably try it with a touch less mayo and butter next time just for fun.  This is a restaurant quality meal.  Thanks for a fantastic treat.

This is the BEST fish recipe I have ever had.  We absolutely love it & I make it often.  I season the tilapia with lemon pepper, Old Bay seasoning & garlic.  No salt.....the cheese & other ingredients add enough salt.  Serve over seasoned rice....delicious.

Now I understand why this recipe has received so many rave reviews. This meal is delicious. I used some of the suggestions from Shannon. Next time, I will try her suggestion of using some bread crumbs to hold the Parmesan mixer together. I love the suggestion of seasoning the fish with a bit of Old Bay seasoning. I did not use the celery salt or crushed red pepper flakes, I can't wait to try it. I was so impressed with my outcome that I took a picture. Thanks for sharing!

OMG!  This was an amazing recipe!  After 10 years of cooking, my husband said it was the BEST thing I have ever made or that he's ever even tasted!  I paired it with brown rice and green beans almondine.  I will make again and again!!!

The thought of putting mayo in the oven kind of turned me off from trying this recipe, but after the rave reviews I had to make it.  It was the best fish I have ever had!  I didn't use celery salt or lemon, and added garlic powder.  Wonderful!

Really good. I used 1/8 tsp. garlic powder instead of onion powder. I also halved the recipe and made only 2 fillets. It was the perfect amount of topping. My husband loved it!

DH loved this! I substituted Italian bread crumbs for half of the Parmesan cheese.  It thickened up the coating and added a different flavor.  I will be making again.

I thought this was just ok.  It was very simple to make and prepare, which always rates high in my book, but I think it was the sauce that didn't do it for me.  My boyfriend really enjoyed it, however.  I may try again and give it another shot.

I bought tilapia yesterday and went online to find a recipe. This was fast, easy and delicious. It was so good my husband is still thanking me! I didn't have a couple of the ingredients (fresh lemon juice, celery salt) so I substituted bottled lemon and celery seed. Also added bread crumbs to the topping. Can't wait to make it again.

Wow!!! This was a wonderful recipe! I gave four stars instead of five, just because I am not too crazy about fish, but since it was what I had on hand, I tried this recipe, and it is really good! Thanks!

This dish is awesome. It looked like somethng you'd see at a nice restaurant, and the taste was even better. I served it with a box of Uncle Ben's Rice, which was easy and the tastes went together very well. Plus, I did notice yesterday that Applebee's serves their Tilapia with Almond Rice.

I really wanted to like this dish.  It sounded great and obviously gets rave reviews; however, my husband and I didn'lt like it.  Something about hot mayonnaise on fish.......On the bright side, my mom and dad loved it and it was very easy to prepare.

If I could give this 10 stars, I would. It was awesome! I added bread crumbs and cayenne pepper as others have suggested.  I will definitely make this again.

This was fabulous!  I tried it on our guests and they raved about it.  It is light and so tasty.  The only thing I changed was I used celery seed in place of celery salt.  I would make this one again and again. ENJOY!

this is a quick and easy recipe. I did add garlic powder as some others suggested and instead of broiling, I baked it at 375 for 35min.  I served over noodles...makes plenty of sauce.

This recipe is a staple in our house.  My kids (2 & 4) cannot get enough of it.  Make sure your parmesan cheese is not old and dried out or else it will really affect the flavor of the recipie.  I usually cook the fish a bit longer on each side, before adding the cheese mixture and have been known to increase the mayonaise to 1/4 cup.

My roommate and I love this recipe, followed it exactly, only used low fat helmanns (b/c that's the best mayo) and didn't use all the sauce on the fish b/c a little goes a long way.  Great with lemon/almond steamed rice

WOW! This is WONDERFUL!! I sprinkled some bread crumbs on top of the cheese mixture and used freshly chopped celery intstead of celery salt. I can see why others have this once a week. We will be too!

This was outstanding. I did not have celery salt, so I liberally sprinkled Old Bay Seasoning on the fish before I cooked it. Other than that, I followed the recipe as written. Even my 17 yr old self-proclaimed fish hater ate it! Will definitely be making this again.

New to making fish.. this was Easy to make and I enjoyed the flavor....my husband and two year old couldn't get enough of it (if my son eats it....it is a winner)!  My husband rescued the extra parmesan/mayo spread and put it on bread.

Great recipe!  Did everything as stated - just added crushed red pepper on top of the topping.  Left one without to taste the difference - both were very good.  The red pepper did give it a more colorful look.  A keeper!

Awesome! My hubby loves tilapia but I have never cooked it for him before, then I found this recipe.  He LOVED this!  Said it was like something he would get at a restaurant.  I added white pepper, used coarsely grated parmesan, and used light miracle whip - this gave it a lot of flavor and a little tang too.  I will definitely be making this again and again!

This recipe is a great, quick recipe that tastes great! A few things that I did to make it my own was replace Basil with Parsley (mainly because I was out of Basil), and I also added some crumbled bacon to sprinkle on top of the fish. This recipe even "as is" is still a great tasting and filling meal!

This recipe is absolutely wonderful!  I used the coarsly grated Parmesan cheese rather than the finely grated and liked it that way better.  This will be filed with my "favorites".

I cut back on the mayo just a tad. Then seasoned the tilapia itself just a little.  I have made this several times, a real keeper!

I thought the recipe was fantastic. My fiance doesn't care much for fish and he finished this. I did make a couple changes which didn't add any time, but I am sure added in flavor. I put slightly soften butter in the mini-chopper with 1/4 c white onion, 1 stalk of celery and a tbsp of minced garlic. I ommited the celery and oinion powders. Otherwise the recipe was the same and was terrific. I did not find it runny- however I cooked the fish on a lower rack and then popped in in the top rack after adding the topping which may have helped keep it together.

My family isn't big into fish, but based on the review's I thought I'd try it.  The fish smell and taste was still very fishy and the topping didn't add a whole lot of flavor.  I'm not picky, but I couldn't even finish it! I think the reviews talked it up too much.

This was a total home-run with all the family. Even my mother, who hates fish, thought it was excellent. Just be sure to get fresh fish and not over-cook it. The parmesan topping is wonderful and I plan on trying it on chicken, too.

I made this tonight in my countertop convection oven which has a "convection/broil" setting. I was trying to figure out how to get it to brown nicely and then I placed an empty cake pan under it and it browned nicely. This is a very flavorful recipe. I think I might use it on shrimp too. Thanks for sharing.

I tried this out on company and it was a big hit.  I didn't have some of the spices so I used what I had: garlic powder, kosher salt, Mrs. Dash.  This will definately go into my favorites cookbook.

Last night was my second night making this dish.  It's absolutely delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly.  However for more flavor I think I'm going to try Sheila and Shannons suggestions next time.  Check their comments out on "most helpful".  Happy Cooking!

This is a keeper recipe! I used it on mahi mahi. You definitely want to use a shredded parmesan cheese (not like Kraft grated), much more flavor.

This was good, but a little cheesy / creamy for our tastes.  This may be because we tend to like recipes that put together light flavors with fish (ie lemon, ginger, etc).  Definitely easy to make.

This recipe was AWESOME!!!  I absolutely love to eat seafood, but am terrified to cook it.  Well not any more!  This fish was so easy to make, and my husband really liked it.  I took another readers advice and added a little bread crumbs to hold the cheese sauce on the fish.  I also added a little garlic and instead of using onion powder I used onion flakes.  (that's all I had) Oh and I used the fresh shredded parmesan.  Bake until the cheese is golden brown.  
The BEST!!!  Thank you for this recipe!!

I saw this recipe and decided I wanted to make it for dinner however I had all the ingredients except for fish, so I decided to try it with chicken instead. Excellent, although next time I may decrease the lemon juice by half. I poached my chicken breasts in chicken stock till fully cooked then I topped in off with the sauce and slipped it under the broiler for a few minutes till brown. Very good, will make again.

This recipe was just as good and just as simple as it sounded.  I substituted quite a bit because I did not have a few of the ingredients.  I used fresh squeezed lime juice, garlic powder, and tarragon.  It was great.  My husband loved it as well.

We love this recipe - so fast and easy.  Goes well with Parmesan Couscous (which also cooks fast) and a salad.  

Two tips from my experience: (1) make sure the butter is softened but not melted to help keep it on top of the fish, and (2) turn on your kitchen fan because the butter that melts down off the fish tends to burn

Didn't have tilapia on hand, so I used mahi-mahi filets I got from Costco the other day.  

I, like many of the others, tweaked a bit.
I didn't want the sauce to slide off as many had complained about, so I added about 1/3 cup of breadcrumbs to the Parm/butter mix.  I also added about a clove of minced garlic, a dash of crushed red pepper, and some dried basil/oregano.  
I also VERY lightly sprinkled the fish with Blackening seasoning on each side, prior to broiling the fish.

My husband has begged me to make this often, and he hates fish. So you know it had to be good!

This was a really, really good tilapia recipe! I omited the celery salt (didn't have any), but noticed no differenece. One thing I have noticed about tilapia - it tastes much better fresh. Don't buy it frozen (too chewy). The parmesan cheese was a great compliment to the lemon juice (which was not strong at all). Don't forget to keep your oven door cracked a bit while broiling, or you'll burn your fish!

Wow, Really easy and very tasty! I added capers to the parmesan topping which really brought something unique to the flavor. Quickly became a family favorite.

Moist, flavorful, easy, and perfect...the best compliments I can give! This is definitely moving up into regular rotation, as it was the quickest meal I've made in a long time. I could have made it even quicker, but I can't bring myself to use the parmesan in the can. Even with grating my own parm, it was a 15 minute dinner. I served this with "Real Poutine" from this site for a fun (artery-clogging!) take on fish and chips. Excellent meal! I'll be trying this again with other fish...I bet the topping would be killer on salmon!

My family really loved this recipe. The sauce was awesome. I made it exactly as the recipe stated and it turned out perfectly! Definitely restaurant quality. Thanks for sharing!

Update: I've made this recipe many times and have a couple of modifications that we really like. I add 1/2 cup Panko breadcrumbs to the topping mixture. I also saute the fish in a with a little oil and butter on the stove, instead of putting it under the broiler. It gives it a bit of a crunchier taste. I then add the topping and broil it for 2 minutes. Yummy!

If you want a good, simple fish recipe for dinner that is extremely fast to make then look no further. This recipe has rightfully gained ALL of the positive responses because it's truly that great. Follow it exactly how is or or add a little mustard to the mixture to taste for an extra flavor. Truly amazing!

Absolutely divine!  Perfect flavoring.  I'm not usually one for sauces, or, rather, I don't dislike sauces but prefer when food can stand on its own and a sauce complements it instead of overpowering it.  This did the trick.

It has been all said before, this dish is easy and delicious!! I did as other reviewer's said and cut back on the mayo, it helps keep the fat content down on this dish.
Thanks for the recipe!! This is a keeper!

First bite--and overall reaction:  OH MY GOODNESS!  The flavor and texture of this fish dish is exquisite!  My husband, who is basically 'neutral' on seafood, said before I did that "this is really good!"  People pay lots of money in fine restaurants for fish prepared so delectably.  I lined a baking sheet/small jelly roll pan with Reynolds Non-Stick Aluminum Foil.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I would not change a thing, and I will most definitely make this easy-to-prepare and delicious recipe again and again.  Thank you so very much for this marvel!

Delicious!  (Those of you who said it was bland - bear in mind that tilapia is a very mild fish!)  Nice blend of flavors, and the broiled cheese lends a slight hint of crispness. Also very tasty with some Italian seasoning sprinkled on top.  Definitely will make this one again.

I followed the recipe exactly and the topping just melted and slid off the fish onto the pan. It needs to be mixed with breadcrumbs or possibly more cheese, less lemon juice so it is a more solid mixture. Furthermore the taste of the mayo overwhelms the fish. It will be good with improvements. It's perfect for non-fish lovers as you can hardly taste the fish!

Hi! This dish was INCREDIBLY quick to make. It tasted bland, though, and the flavor that stood out was the onion salt. I would make this with more lemon and add breadcrumbs to make the topping crunchy.

My boyfriend and I really like this recipe.  We have used it several times since we found it.  I use fat free mayo and I also add an 1/8 tsp garlic powder.  We usually have it with spinach and northern beans.

Good and quick recipe also very healthy. Great if paired with angel hair pasta or mashed potatoes. Only thing is the mayo has a strong taste. Next time I will try substituting with cream of mushroom soup.

I really didn't know what to expect from this dish - the ingredients seem a little strange.  (mayonnaise on broiled fish???)  I even omitted the lemon juice because my fiance doesn't really like lemons, even on seafood, and it turned out great!  The flavors are such a wonderful combination and it was a great new way to serve tilapia, which is the reason I tried this recipe in the first place.  I've already printed it out and it's in my book of keepers!

This recipe is an absolute keeper!! The topping could almost be eaten as a dip for corn chips it is so delicious. I added 1/2 tsp of garlic powder. Ihe sauce is a great compliment to the tilapia (though it would work well on any firm white fish). Both my children and my husband asked for seconds!

This recipe is pretty good, but not deserving of 5 stars.  I tried it with lime juice instead of lemon and it was a nice twist.  I do recommend it and I would make it again if I happen to have all of the ingredients on hand.  I would not make a special trip the store for this one!

This has become my favorite recipie for tilapa. It's so quick and easy to make. It's great for dinner parties and fairly healthy too. I've substuted yogert for the mayo and I can't believe it's not butter light for the real butter and it's good that way too.

I made this for my husband, and he loved it so much he requested it for his birthday dinner.  My father, who does not like fish, loved the tilapia, and was delightfully surprised at how good it was.  It is quite easy, and you can make it ahead to the broiling point and just do that at the last minute.  Definately a "keeper".

Fabulous!  I actually grill mine in foil packets and it turns out delicious. I just pour the sauce over the fish and wrap it tightly in the foil and grill it for maybe 10 mins or until it is done.  Yummy!

Great fish recipe! I substituted romano for the parmesan and it was delicious.

TIP: I found that I hadn't broiled it long enough at the beginning and ended up with my cheese topping nice and brown but the thickest part of the fish was undercooked.  So I turned off the broiler element, moved the fish to the lowest rack and let it bake at 350 degrees for another 4-5 minutes.  The middle cooked through without further browning the top.

This is a great recipe. You can change it just a little bit here and there to suit whatever you're making. For the Tilapia, we used grated cheese, added a little extra pepper, and some garlic. I also sprinkled a little cajun on the filets before putting them in the oven. Folks need to make sure the fish is close enough to the broiler if they're having a problem with the texture. It's only 2-3 inches away.

Incredibly good!  Make it for your guests -- they'll love it!  You can leave the butter out completely and still get delicious, moist fish without the extra calories and saturated fat.  This is a must-have again and again!

I am a fish lover but I've never had tilapia.  I bought some at the store and came on this site to find a good recipe for it.  This was definitely IT!  My whole family ate every last bit...even my 4 year old who doesn't usually like fish.  Very easy and extremely good.  I would highly recommend!

This recipe was excellent.  The parmesan was not overpowering and was better than I expected.  My whole family really liked it, even my finiky one.

YUM! I used lowfat mayo and yogurt blended margerine to cut the fat - and it was delicious! Both my hubby and I loved it and agreed it would be an easy weeknight dinner choice in the future.

A different spin on tilapia..... I don't know if I would make this again but it was tasty. If you're not a big seafood fan this is probably the recipe for you because it really doesn't taste like fish. Definitely worth a try.

WOW this is awesome!  I broiled salmon instead of tilapia and it was yummy!  I won't cook fish any other way.  I have also cut the butter in half, added garlic, italian seasonings and spread on french bread and popped in the toaster oven.  Served with tomato sauce for a snack. This recipe is a keeper!

This is very simple but delicious.  The tilapia is delicate and the sharpness of the parmesan and mayo really carries it.  If you use a cookie sheet rather than a broiler pan, make sure that it's strong enough that it won't buckle under the heat of the broiler.  I made that mistake the first time I tried this. BTW, the picture is very accurate.  I've made this 3 times now and will continue to do so.

I love this, my whole family loves this, and I have 2 fussy eaters!  I usually add some fresh minced garlic instead of onion powder, and add Italian seasoning in place of dried basil.  I serve this for company and I pair it with the Grilled Asparagus with Orange Wasabi Dressing from this site. I round out the meal with some brown rice. What a wonderful recipe!  My family is coming to visit next weekend, and asked for this specifically!

Very good recipe.  I did reduce the amount of mayo (just a little bit)...saw some of the reviews that said it was a bit overpowering.  I also added some minced garlic.  Other than that...I followed the recipe to a T.  Thanks for the post.  Will definately make again.

I'm not a big fish fan, but I love this recipe, and my husband loves it too!  I usually use light mayonnaise and margerine, to lower the fat content, and I don't think the flavor suffers at all.  I also play with the seasonings, depending on what I have on hand.  This is a pretty forgiving recipe.

Great and easy recipe! I had some frozen tilapia filets and needed a quick & easy recipe. My favorite thing about this recipe is that it was so easy. Fish was nice and moist. My husband loved the topping (next time I'll make extra)and I even used LITE mayo! (hellmans is the best). This would really work with almost any kind of fish. Thanks!

This has to be one of my favorite recipes out there.  5 stars for Non-fish lovers too.  Kids like it and it's simple/ easy to make.   Just remember as with any recipe- use FRESH ingrediants.  Get the fish fresh if you can- stay away from Frozen. Use fresh Parmesan cheese and you will notice the difference.   Buy it freshly grated at your local grocer's cheese section.    I've also used this topping on other fish and chicken-  it's mouth watering!

Enjoy!!

This was nice.  I had never tried Tilapia before last night.  The fish was flaky and tender.  Not at all dry.  I did not have any celery salt, so I left that out.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe and was pleased with the result.  We served this with rice and salad and it was delicious and incredibly FAST!!  Thank you Phoebe.  I will make this again.  My BF called this one "a definite keeper"

This is a great dish to entertain with - seems labor intensive, but it very easy.  

I always double the topping and add garlic powder and lemon pepper.  I serve it with wild rice, fresh steamed broccoli with fresh lemon & a cold white wine.  Big hit, thank you!

Very nice - a little too caloric for an everyday meal, but very satisfying. I used chopped fresh basil from my garden, went heavy on the lemon juice, and served it with some risotto. Yummy!

This is wonderful! I didn't change a thing. My husband took one bite, and said, "Oh..WOW! What IS this?!" I dislike fish, but he was so effusive, I tried a bite; I then regretted that I hadn't made enough for both of us. This is definitely a keeper--on a very short list. "Heaven on a plate"--like something you'd get in a fine restaurant (if you were lucky!). Thanks!!

Wow did this ever taste good! My broiler is not working, so I baked the fish for 30 minutes and it came out perfectly. I served with steamed fresh asparagus. My 2 year old gobbled it all down and my husband had seconds (which just doesn't happen!) Thank You for a delicious recipe!

Wow!  This was absolutely delicious!  I messed up and used 1/3 cup mayo instead of 3 tbs...BUT, it was just more similar to baked cod, and the sauce came out yummy and creamy.  I did not use onion powder, and doubled the fresh squeezed lemon juice (love lemon with fish).  I also lighly buttered, salted and peppered during the initial broiling.  I cooked it 2 1/2 minutes on each side, and 4 minutes in the end.  The fish was mouth-watering moist and the parmesian sauce was a beautiful light-golden bubbly brown.  I would recommend the 1/3 mayo as I used, to create a creamy cheesy sauce (if you don't mind the calories)!  Thanks for the recipe - everyone raved!

Yum. I used brummel and brown spread, light mayo, freshly grated parmesan and fresh basil in this recipe. This tasted really good. Was very fast. I've made this a couple of times now and it is a tasty way to eat fish.

This recipe was extremely quick and easy and a pleasure to eat.  I cut the butter in half and used low fat mayonaise to make the recipe lower in fat and it still tasted amazing.  I am my worst critic when it comes to cooking and I have to say this was an awesome dish!!  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

In a word......WOW! This is absolutely some of the best fish that I've made at home.  It truly does taste like a restaurant dish, one that I'd order again and again.  My husband loved it as did my children (at least the one that likes seafood).  I made it "healthier" yet by using "Just 2 Good" Hellman's mayo and Land of Lakes "Light Butter".  Other than that, I wouldn't chane a thing!  WONDERFUL........

Since I discovered this delicate,mild tasting inexpensive fish 6 months ago, I buy it almost weekly. There is not a lot of recipes out there for this kind of fish. This was good but none of us thought it to be outstanding. I used 1.47 pounds of fish,not 2 and didn't have any extra sauce for serving on top of rice. I would double the sauce next time. I didn't have celery salt, so I used a pinch of celery seed and 1/8 tsp. salt. I think next time I will add some garlic powder, and try using dill weed in place of basil. I will definately experiment with this. Maybe I was expecting more from all the great reviews but it was a nice way to prepare this and fast and easy. I would try this sauce on tomato slices(broiled) and even chicken. Thanks Phoebe!

Very easy and very tasty.  I'll definitely make this again.  Also, my cat went crazy while I was eating, and kept trying to steal it from me.  He was very disappointed that there were so few scraps.

Great recipe! It was the easiest fish recipe I've ever made and my husband loved it too. I also added bread crumbs, and also a dollop of (Smart Balance) margarine.
I used an Italian Parmesan that is already seasoned, with an extra dash of garlic powder and black pepper, none of the other herbs. I substitued smart Balance for butter, and it worked fine!
Thanks for this recipe!

I loved this!!!  What a nice change from fried fish.  Most importantly, it was quick and easy!  2 minutes was plenty of time for each side.  I served this with rice and parmesan asparagus.

Amazingly tasty recipe. I used fresh parmesan instead of the jar variety. My husband said it was the best fish recipe I've prepared. Served it with Calypso Rice and steamed broccoli for a great meal.

I was worried this would be a heavy coating but it was actually quite light.  I cut down a little on the mayo but otherwise followed the recipe as written.  Very good!

My family loved this recipe. However I did make a few changes. Only used 1 Tbsp dried Parmesan cheese. Did not use celery salt, onion powder or lemon juice.

Excellent as it!  Thanks for a great recipe.  I didn't know how to cook fish and probably cooked it a bit longer than stated - but I imagine everyone will figure that out on their own.  Flavor was awesome!

This is a really delicious recipe, and super easy and affordable to make since you'll always have the ingredients on hand. I made it as is, and like one reviewer, I seasoned the tilapia with Old Bay before boiling to give a slight bit more flavor. Will be making this again.

This was super easy and quick - plus you can modify it as you like it. I stuck to the recipe but eyeballed the seasonings to add more of what we like and less of what we don't like. I also used garlic salt instead of celery salt but I think either would be great. Really amazing dish and would be good to serve to company. Five stars definitely!

One of our family all time favorites! And, we aren't even big fish fans! I saute both sides of the tilapia w/ the sauce. A little more calories but the taste is well worth it. Good to pair w/ rice pilaf and a suateed aspargus.

This "sauce" for the Tilapia is just fantastic!  I'd put that on almost any fish!  It's very easy and the ingredients are things most everyone has on hand I think.

I have made this three times and have enjoyed it every time.  It is very simple.  I substituted Miracle Whip for Mayo once and it wasn't as good. Stick to the mayo. I have made it with more cheese sauce and with less sauce.  It just depended on what I felt like eating.  We love fish so less sauce is better for us because we want more of a fishy taste.  When we had company over we would use more of the cheese sauce.  Excellent either way.

This was so easy - a perfect thing to make on a week/school night, because I could prep the sauce in advance.  Of course, it solidified a bit by the time I was broiling the fish.  So, I just warmed it up a bit, and I was good to go.  Even my non-fish-eating husband said, "You're right - it doesn't taste like other fish." Ha!  I'll take that as he likes it! :)

Delicious recipe.  The only things we changed were we put in half the amount of butter and added a little cayenne pepper, garclic powder and a few bread crumbs.

It was very good!! The only thing I would do different is double the cheese and ingredients. Not quite enough to coat as I would like.

I was looking for a non-summery recipe for tilapia and found this one. I took some of the other reviewers advice: added breadcrumbs, sprinkled the fillets with seasoned salt, left out the celery salt because my husband doesn't like it. It was delicious, fairly easy, and quick. I'll be coming back to this recipe.

The cheese mixture meled on contact with the hot fish, flowed off the fish onto the broiler pan, and after cooking it burns on the pan. There is nothing left on the fish!

I make this at least once a month. I'm not a huge fish lover but this recipe's flavor is amazing. I always go overboard on the parmesan because that's where all the flavor is at. So if you like parmesan don't be scared to sprinkle more ;). This is great with a side of butter and herb rice and a glass of white wine.

This is a tasty and quick way to prepare fish. Catfish could be used in place of tilapia as the flavor and texture are similar. Would be a good dish for the first time fish cook to make since it's hard to mess up. Also, this recipe pleases the palates of people who don't normally like fish. Tilapia should have a light, fresh taste, not fishy and strong. Most of the time when fish is fishy tasting it's from overcooking it.

I made it exactly as written, and also added some breadcrumbs to the mixture. I didn't broil, just baked. My family loved it, though I didn't, but I think it's just because I'm not a fan of parmesan.

Made 4 servings, which was enough for around 5 fillets. I added the recommended paprika, bread crumbs, and garlic power (also had no onion powder) and it turned out great.

Everyone who ate it fell in love! I made a few changes. First, when making the mix, I eliminated the mayo. I've been running and I don't need that in my diet plus my boyfriend hates mayo. Instead of lemon juice I used lime juice and i eliminated the basil and replaced it with dried parsley and used regular salt instead of celery salt because I didn't have any. I added garlic powder, cayenne pepper, and paprika to the mix. I added just a little water to not make it so thick but just a little. I also had some rolls on hand so i broke it up into crumbs and added it to the mix. Seasoning the tilapia is key. I used old bay from a suggestion from another user and seasoned both sides but not heavy. Make sure you watch the fish so to not overcook it. I broiled 2 1/2 minutes on one side and 2 minutes on the other. Then I added the mix which was like a paste and put it back in for 2 1/2 minutes until it browned a little and got crispy. The butter melted on the fish a little which made it tasty. I served it with lightly seasoned white rice and bell peppers that I sauteed and added in when i broiled the fish. Everyone gobbled it down!

Was amazing!!!  Next time I will eliminate the butter and less mayo. It also created a delicous sauce. I eat tilpia at least 3 days out of the week and this is the best recipe hands down I have tried.

Just made this tonight.  Followed recipe to the letter except left out the lemon and added some dried chive.  It made the tilapia 100 times better than just baked.

I don't like fish but I could eat this because it's not fishy. It's also super quick and easy! It also tastes delicious with a homemade rice pilaf!

i have done this recipe several times,but baked...not broiled.the flavor is only spotty and does not hit all the fillets.so i started with each one fillet, and ,one at a time,just laid in the mix both sides and then put to the oven..better results.

Made the recipe without changing anything and it was really good! The fact that it's broiled means it doesn't take as long as baking. Great for me since I didn't have much time! Thank you :)

Excellent flavour.  Used this on pickeral because didn't have tilapia.  Will be doing this recipe on fish on a weekly basis now.  Reason for giving it a 4 and not a 5 is that after coming out of the oven the topping melts and runs all over the pan - have to experiment a bit with the butter and the lemon juice (I think) to help the topping stay on the fish when broiled.  Thanks for an awesome dish!

Delicious.
I did, however, sub Greek yogurt for the butter.
I baked it first and then put it under the broiler at the end after adding the topping, as to not curdle the yogurt.

I was disappointed.  When I put the cheese, butter, mayo mixture on the fish the heat of the fish melted it and it all ran off the fish onto the pan.  Tasted ok but how do you get the topping to stay on the fish and brown?

This recipe definitely surprised me with how awesome it turned out... I've become sort of a skeptic when it comes to "4/5 star" recipes because they almost never live up to the hype but I was pleasantly surprised with this dish! I will be making it again!

This was so easy and quick. I used less lemon juice and more basil and it tasted a little better to me. My picky sister loved it and asked for more. Taste better when it was cooked longer and had a crunchy outer layer. Overall I would definitely recommend this dish.

This is absolutely delicious and so incredibly easy to make! I followed the recipe, made no changes, and we all loved it.  Even my son told me to keep the recipe so I can make it again and often (that's saying something). I'd been looking to add more fish to our meals - this one's a keeper.  Thank you Phoebe! YUM!

Tilapia is a very mild fish and the sauce overpowered the taste of the fish.  It was also kind of a bother to broil, pull out, turn, remove completely from oven to add the topping which didn't really spread on evenly once it came in contact with the hot fish, and then broil again.

I don't like lemon juice, so I omit that. However, I make this once a week and it is FANTASTIC!!  You can easy lower the fat content by simply using light butter and light mayo. I have shared this recipe with others as well, and they have raved about it as well.

WOW this recipe is fabulous!!! I'm a head chef for a Sorority house and I just made this tonight for my girls. They absolutely went CRAZY over this. Only change I made is using celery seed instead of salt as the Parm we use is quite salty.  Thank You Thank  You for giving me another regular on our menu.

This was great! I followed it for the most part. I didn't use the celery salt or basil because I didn't have any. I also added breadcrumb to the mixture, which complimented nicely. My mixture came out like a paste (I didn't measure anything, just eye balled it!), but i think that was due to the breadcrumb. It had a very nice flavor, will definitely be making again. Plus, it was very easy and fast to make!!

Love this recipe.  The topping is very tasty.  Sometimes I add garlic powder and a dash of paprika.  I also use this topping when making salmon.  So yum!!

I loved it. I liked the Parmesan/lemony taste. It goes really well with Tilapia, I cooked 2 pieces of fish with this mix, so it could be that the mix was a bit much, it was quite buttery, but I enjoyed it anyway. It's a first time I buy Tilapia. When I searched on the Internet for making a tasty fish, I stumbled into this Recipe, it looked simple and quick to make, so I went with this one. From now on, I will be eating more fish.

I liked this recipe very much. The only issue I had with it was the broiler. I let it broil for about three minutes, but I feel that it should have been left for a longer time to broil.

My husband buys tilapia, and now that he is deployed, I'm stuck with it in the freezer. I didn't know what to make with it, as I can't seem to find a recipe that makes this fish tasty or filling. I found this recipe and decided to try it since I had fresh Parmesan cheese and all the other ingredients on hand. I loved that it was quick, easy and delicious and can be served on top of rice. This is definitely a keeper and I will continue to grate fresh Parmesan into the mix, as it really packs flavor into this dish. Thank you for this recipe. I finally have a quick go-to for tilapia. :)

Better than I could have thought. My 6 year old who never touched fish before in his life ate two whole fillets! I sprinkled a bit of old bay on before initial broiling. The timing on the recipe was absolutely perfect. As suggested by another reviewer I did add a small amount of parm break crumbs to the mixture so it would all brown nicely. If you do this, make double the topping mixture. Other than that small add on, I wouldn't change a thing. This will become a regular on the meal rotation! Awesome flavor, not too overwhelming. Great texture (esp w the added splash of bread crumbs) and for once, perfect cooking times on the original recipe. Give it a whirl!!!!

I'll be honest, I loved the way this recipe sounded so I wanted and did try it.  I am trying to cook more healthy so I made my own changes just for my benefit.  I omitted the butter and mayo and used non fat Greek yogurt for the topping. I kept the herb mixture the same.  I added an 1/8 cup of bread crumbs to hold it together and it worked very well. The flavor of the fish was there and the topping was a nice compliment to it.  I will make this again for sure.

Like all other reviewers, I LOVED this! I am a terrible cook and can mess up the easiest of recipes. I thought for sure I'd either burn the fish or mess up the cheese topping. It came out GREAT! I followed the recipe exactly, save for the celery salt I left out and the addition of some paprika, garlic powder and some bread crumbs on top for the last two minutes of broiling. It was delicious! My boyfriend who typically doesn't trust my cooking looked it over with a suspicious eye but ate every morsel. Highly recommend for even the worst of cooks! The only change I would make is I loved the cheese sauce so much I'll double it next time.

My whole family loves this broiled tilapia. Even my 3 & 6 year old picky children will eat this without one complaint.  Yum! 

After making several times, I have made the following adjustments-- half the butter and use plain yogurt.  Then leave out the lemon juice.  It is just as good with less fat.

I just made this, and did not change anything. I made it exactly the way I saw it in the recipe. It was perfect. A very delicious fish sauce, and very quick and easy. Everybody said they liked it, and there wasn't anything left by the end. Good recipe.

Yum! My whole family loves this recipe. I made it again tonight with 3 pounds of Swai fillets and it was still plenty enough sauce for all of the fish without changing the ingredient amounts. After making several times, I now use a little less mayo (I don't measure it, just guess), use sea salt instead of celery salt(don't have any) and leave out the pepper (don't like) and get rave reviews every time I make it!

Made ths tonite, using mahi-mahi, which is what I had on hand - followed the rest of the recipe with the exception of using paprika instead of black pepper, which is a family preference.  My entire family LOVED this!!  So delicious!!  Next time I going to add a crumb topping for crunchiness . . . thanks for the recipe!

I love this recipe!  I always double the topping/sauce. I also use "Old Bay" seasoning on the fish for the first round of broiling.
This is also a perfect recipe for a low carb diet.
This is one that the whole family enjoys and is on our regular rotation.

I'm not a fish fan....but this recipe could certainly make me one! I have made this several times now and just can't get enough! I always make the sauce an hour or so beforehand and let it all "hang out" together in the fridge. I also chopped up some fresh dill and added garlic powder to the mixture.

Very good.  Can vary the spices to suit your tastes.  Definitely needs more salt (& I rarely salt things -- but fish, in general, needs a good bit of salt to give it flavor) -- I used 1/2 t. garlic salt.  Also, I bake at 375 for 15-18 minutes, rather than broil (as I don't like the spattering, sizzling in my oven!)

This recipe is DELISH!! The tilapia is so moist! I made a couple of substitutions: garlic powder for the onion & celery salt, small amount olive oil for the butter and Marie's Asiago Peppercorn dressing for the mayo. I also added 1/2 panko bread crumbs. I have NEVER had such flavorful tilapia!!!! Will definately use this recipe often!

This is fantastic!  After reading a lot of the reviews I made the following changes:

1.  Instead of celery salt, I used celery seed and than added a little additional salt.
2.  I added the same amount of panko crumbs as I did Parmesan cheese.  (1/2 cup parmesan cheese, 1/2 cup panko crumbs)
3.  I added 1/2 tsp paprika

This is DELICIOUS!!!

I made it exactly as indicated. Nice, easy, good flavor. Next time I will use half of the butter required, as there was a lot of unneeded fat left in the broiler pan. Goes well with fresh steamed veggies or salad and herbed rice.

I eyeballed the quantities to serve for two and it still worked. I also substituted the spices listed for oregano (that is all I had). Great flavours. I have added this recipe to my go-to list.

My family loved this recipe.  It was easy and flavorful.  Followed the many recommendations: adding 1/2 tsp paprika, 1/4 tsp garlic powder and 1/2 cup bread crumbs.  And,  sprinkling fish with Old Bay Seasoning.
Would eliminate lemon juice next time--too tangy.  Would add 2 T of white wine maybe.  Found it hard to spread evenly on fish.  Will try warming mixture in microwave to soften it more.

This is melt in your mouth delicious. I was worried the fish would get dry, since you initially cook it with absolutely nothing on it. But it was so moist and flavorful. Excellent recipe, thank you for sharing!

My husband and I love this recipe.  It's so easy and so delicious.  I just buy frozen tilapia filets from Kroger.  Then take out 3-4 pieces and put in the 'fridge the night before to thaw out.  It's quick and easy to make after a long day's work.  I serve it with rice and asparagus.  Great recipe!

Just made it and my husband loved it.  Used unsalted butter, garlic powder,basil and onion salt and it took longer to cook.  Reduced the amount for only two.

Added 5 pressed garlic (love love love garlic!); a pinch of pepper flakes to give it a zing.
I didn't have to flip the fillets. I baked the fillets for 4 minutes, then topped them with the Parmesan mixture and baked them for a 4 more minutes. 
Fantastico!

We loved this recipe!  I added some garlic powder and since my market didn't have celery salt, I put in a few pinches of celery seed.  I used parchment paper, along with someone's suggestion to start with the veined side up.  Can't wait to eat this again!

This was declared "DELICIOUS" by even my pickiest eaters who don't usually care for fish. My husband says it's the best I've ever fixed. I brushed the fish with the parmesan coating before putting it in the oven, then with a second coating when I turned it over. Fabulous! Definitely a keeper.

Loved this!  Super easy, quick and yummy! I added breadcrumbs to  the topping.  For a quick side veggie I used leftover topping to coat some asparagus that also went under the broiler for a few minutes.

Very easy and quick meal. Husband and stepson liked it a lot.  Only reason it's not a five star recipe is that my topping never really "browned" so it was kind of an "ugly" dish.  Will definitely make it again as a quick  week night meal.

This was really great. I was surprised that parmesan would taste so good on fish (and so was my boyfriend)! I did add a little bit of bread crumbs to the cheese mixture, to help out the texture, but in the end, it didn't really matter because the topping doesn't stay under the broiler long enough to really crisp up anyway. So, although a bit on the mushy side, the result was a delicious creamy topping. I recommend broiling on LOW, as when I turned up to high for this last step, the topping quickly started to blacken, but did not get crispy. Delicious!

This was delicious, I am not exaggerating. I made a few adjustments based on other reviewers suggestions, and a few of my own tweaks. I added garlic power, instead of onion powder. I skipped the basil and added fresh thyme, and baby dill to the mayonnaise mixture, this gave it a very fresh taste, that cut back slightly on the richness of the mayonnaise and butter. I also added paprika, and red [pepper flakes, and I sprinkled the fillets with old bay before broiling, as suggested by reviewer. The best addition was that of bread crumbs suggested by another person. I used panko breadcrumbs in with the mixture, and it gave it wonderful crispy crunch. I am definitely going to make this again. The fish was a perfect translucent color, and flaked beautifully. I recommend this recipe to anyone looking for something quick, easy, and tasty. If you want a truly superb meal, however, follow the suggestions of other reviewers.

I made this tonight for dinner & everyone loved it! I didn't have any lemons, so I used lemon pepper seasoning, which worked great. For the mayo, I always use the olive oil mayo, which gives it a great flavor & creaminess~ I also cut the recipe in half for our family of 4.

So easy and quick with awesome flavor.  I did use a little less butter and mayo and increased the parmesan and lemon a smidge.  Also I didn't have basil, so I used Italian seasoning.

This is delicious. As per the other reviews, I lined the pan with foil and lightly seasoned the fish with Old Bay before broiling. Added just a dash of garlic powder to the mayo mixture. Served with mushroom risotto (used recipe from this site "Gourmet Mushroom Risotto") It came out great! Was a huge hit with my BF too!

This was so easy and delicious. I broiled on high and added the old bay seasoning and paprika along with garlic salt because I didn't have celery salt and it was so good.  My fish wasn't thawed yet so I put in plastic bag with water (they were individually wrapped) and they defrosted pretty quick. The whole family enjoyed them.  Thank you!

This fish was ok. I added Old Bay and some Tony's and it was still a little bland for me. Maybe is I had the celery salt it would be better. My husband liked it though. We both LOVED the Ranchy Tilapia recipe here  on Allrecipes though.

Husband and boys loved this.  Eyeballed ingredients...EASY!  Broiled it on a bed of spinach which became tasty as well.  Didn't bother with aluminum foil and used a heavy ceramic-on-cast iron baking pan...easy wipe-out with the spinach.  Will make again, and again,....

It was okay, but needed a bit more seasoning for complexity.  Recommend real shredded parm, not the dried stuff.  I prefer fish with more textural and color variety than this produced but it was edible.

Loved this one, we only had a couple of fish to serve but needed a new idea.  I added garlic powder, more basil, some bread crumbs and it was perfect except maybe needed to reduce the lemon juice for the serving size I had.

This is an easy, delicious recipe that has lends itself to a host of variation.  When I first went to make it, I realized I was out of Parmesan cheese, so I decided to go for more of an herb recipe.  I minced up some garlic and fresh thyme and mixed it in with the mayo, lemon, salt and pepper.  Once I laid the fish out on the broiler pan, I sprinkled them with Italian breadcrumbs.  I like the Parmesan as well when I have it, but won't fret.  Next time I will try it fresh basil and oregano, and definitely the garlic.  Awesome recipe!

I have finally made fish that my family wants to eat.  This was very good, easy to prepare, and quick to throw together.  I did add 1/2 cup of panko crumbs, double pepper, and added some garlic powder.  So HAPPY, but ate too much.

Tasted pretty good but I felt that the topping was a little too rich for such a mild fish. Next time I think I will just use a a sprinkling of the parmesan cheese instead

I must start off by saying I was apprehensive about tilapia to begin with. So last night I was running behind and I needed something quick and easy for a last minute dinner!  I didn't have high hopes.  Found this recipe and I'm SO glad I did.  I didn't change anything except replacing the Parmesan with Dubliner cheese. It was a HUGE hit with my entire family!  The flavor was incredible!  My kids (2&4) gobbled it up and my husband raved about it!  Served it with some brown rice and tangy coleslaw.  Thanks for a great & (easy) recipe. Can't wait to make it again!

This recipe was delicious!  We aren't big fans of seafood but this recipe was a hit with EVERYONE!  We will be doubling the recipe next time for sure!  I might try reducing the amount of butter, as suggested by other reviewers, in an effort to keep this dish as healthy as possible.  I've already shared this recipe with some of my friends.  Thank you Phoebe!

This is the best recipe!!!  I didn't have any celery salt, so used Dill Weed in place of.  Also, as a another reviewer suggested, I sprinkled Old Bay Seasoning on both sides before broiling.  Very yummy!!!!  Thanks!

This has become our Friday night standard.  Trying to be a good little weight watcher, so I reduced the butter to 2 Tblsp and used light mayo.  I also use Swai or Basa because cheaper here in MO than tilapia.  Thicker than tiliapiea, so broiled each side 3-4 minutes.  Even my picky kids like this!   LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe.  Thanks Phoebe!

"This is just out of this world!," remarks from my husband.  

Not sure if it's because I substituted the parmesan cheese with Tête de Moine (Monk Head) cheese, but this was awesome.

I add a bit of fresh garlic as well and always buy the inexpensive Swai fillets. The broiling directions are spot on. Flavorful, juicy and delicious!

Very delicious. Lacked a little seasoning and was a little salty, but very yummy.

The toppings were perfect, wasn't over powering at all. I liked how fast it cooked and there was no need for frying.  I added some bread crumbs to the mix and served it with some rice.  Everyone loved it!

Wow what can I say, this was fantastic.  Turned out flakey and moist.  The butter with the Parmesan cheese and mayo gives it a fabulous taste!  Thanks for sharing, I'll be making this lots :)

DEE-Lish!! Love this recipe! I added Panko bread crumbs on the top of the spread to give a nice golden crust. Always looking for new ways to make tilapia. Thank you!

This was good.  I didn't have lemon juice, so I seasoned the fish with lemon pepper seasoning.  I would just recommend not putting too much of the topping on the fish.  Just a thin layer is enough.

We just LOVE this recipe!  I've made it a few times now and will be making it quite often.  One of the most important steps is not to over cook your fish.  It is so moist and tender and very flavorful.

I LOVED this with my changes.  As is, I would give 3.5 stars.  I soaked fillets in milk, seasoned, and prebaked 3 minutes pulling out and flipping over.  I combined mixture, sans lemon juice and basil, added cayenne, parsley and panko crumbs and coated the top portion of filets only.  Baked at 400 for another 5 minutes and let filets sit for 1-2 minutes.  Served over rice and with a green bean and tomato medley sprinkled with parmesan cheese.  The fish was so JUICY AND TENDER and the panko added a nice crunch!

This was good, I would just like a thicker crust. I was trying sor it to be similar to Mgraths parmesan halibut, while this was still tasty, it was not close to that. I will probably make it again, but tweak it some.

I've made this recipe several times, each time a little bit differently depending on what ingredients I have on hand - it's very versatile and ALWAYS FAST AND DELICIOUS. 

Reducing the mayo and/or butter doesn't sacrifice any flavor and can even help brown the topping since you get a less runny mixture and proportionately more cheese. Also, I often exchange the celery salt/onion powder for garlic salt. Yum =)

Tilapia is cheap, almost always sustainably farmed, and very healthy! If possible try to buy tilapia from your local farmers' market - the more local (and thereby the fresher) the fish, the less "fishy" the taste. Tilapia is a quite mild white fish which is the main reason that people who normally don't like fish or seafood often like it; however, it can get unpleasantly fishy if you don't freeze or cook it within a couple days. 

Bon Apetit!

It was very good.  I tried it with both tilipia and salmon and it was delicious on both. I used the leftover (only a little bit) to dip artichoke in - and it was awesome.  I did follow other reviewers and added some bread crumbs to help the dressing slip.

This was yummy! I didn't give it 5 stars because I did a lot of tweaking, basically using all of Shannon :)'s tips except I did end up leaving the lemon juice in. I imagine it wouldn't have been as flavorful without the tweaks. Still a great recipe, will definitely add this to my rotation!

Family loved it. Kinda got runny wondering if there's a way to thicken to make it more like a crusted top like the kind I get from Lunardis. Maybe bread crumbs? Nevertheless we all loved it

I modified the recipe just a little bit, using garlic instead of basil and a 3 cheese italian blend instead of the regular grated parmesan. Hours after dinner my husband was still talking about how good it was!

This was easy and delicious.  I changed it up a little bit by adding paprika and garlic powder to the mayo mixture.  I also tried to make it a little healthier by using margarine and low fat mayo.  I seasoned the fish with old bay seasoning before broiling.  So yummy.

I made this while on vacation for my extended family.  They LOVED it and they are NOT fish eaters!  We were at a time share so we didn't have all of the ingredients.  We used low fat mayo but real  butter, salt substitute, black pepper, Old Bay, & lime instead of lemon juice.  No basil or celery salt, we didn't even have onion left by the time I made it!  They still loved it!  I mixed fresh bread crumbs, because that's what we had, with the topping ingredients and the topping still turned out great!  I suggest bread crumbs every time, they hold a bit of the cheese flavor in!  We had an electric oven so I cooked the fish without the topping further away from the heat, then after adding the topping, cooked it close to the heat.  Texture was perfect, still juicy but firm and perfectly done!  I have gas at home so I'll have to see how it'll work at home but all in all, great recipe!!!  You can modify it to suit your tastes like all recipes so give it a shot!

This is a very tasty, very easy preparation for tilapia!  I took other reviewers' advice and sprinkled the fillets with Old Bay before broiling (Tony Chachere's would be good too) and I added a few Tbs. of panko to the butter mixture, which gave the topping a really nice texture once it was broiled.  Subbed garlic powder for onion since that's what I had on hand.  Delicious, fast, and my kids loved it!

Very good.  Had not broiled anything before, so I was nervous.  Also afraid that the parmesan mixture would over power the fish.  I followed the directions exactly, and it came out very, very good.  Will definitely make again.

Who knew making Tilapia could be easy and delicious! Had guests over for dinner last night and they loved it! Since there was only 4 of us I used 4 fillets (no idea how much they weighed) and same amount for everything else and it turned out just great! Ill will make this again for sure.

Excellent!  My husband and I both agree this is the best tilapia we've ever had.  I love how simple it is too!  I did season the tilapia filets with salt and onion powder first, then dipped them in plain bread crumbs as a personal preference and to help the sauce stay on.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  I can't wait to make this again!

WHOOPS!  I forgot to turn over the fillets.  Put the butter mixture (with added panko) on top after the 1st broiling.  Guess what!  Perfect!  With lemon/green onion angel hair pastat & roasted asparagus it was excellent!

This was probably the best fish I have ever had!  I really only made a few changes.  1) I hate mayo so I substituted sour cream 2) Used celery seed instead of salt 3) Added 1/8 tsp. garlic powder 4) I lined a baking sheet with foil and sprayed the foil with nonstick spray 5) Broiled with the rack as close to the broiler as I could for 5 minutes.  I did not turn the fish over 6) Put the mixture on the fish and broiled two more minutes

Perfect flavor for tilapia! I cooked it exactly as stated and it came out perfect. The time was right on also, it was perfectly juicy. My butter wasn't really soft enough, next time I think melting it more would help, but it didn't make a difference for the final result.

This was really, really good. I brushed the fish with a mixture of olive oil and garlic powder before broiling - didn't have celery salt so added a little garlic powder to the mixture as well. Like another reviewer, I didn't bother to flip the fish - broiled for 5 minutes, removed from oven, put mixture on top and then broiled for 2 more. The topping was slightly browned and bubbling. It was SO GOOD! What a great recipe!

This has become a staple in our household!  I usually 1/2 the butter, use low fat mayo, and add some bread crumbs and fresh minced garlic.  I also use the topping on 1/2 of the fish in the recipe - so usually for a pound of tilapia.  DELICIOUS!

Tasty. Our topping separated a bit. I'm thinking perhaps the mayo is the culprit? Will have to experiment with leaving it out next time.

Breading was very good but I did modify the recipe a bit.  I added a little garlic and 1/4 cup of bread crumbs for an added crunch.  I would town down the lemon juice a bit, it became an overpowering flavor.

This was amazing! The whole family enjoyed it, along with the picky eaters. Definetly a keeper. I do not care for celery salt, and did not put it in. Will make again and again!

I do the recipe to the T but I add a little more Parmesan cheese to the top of them after the mixture browns a bit cause you really just can't have too much cheese. Boyfriend, boyfriend's Mom and I love this recipe! Will definitely keep making.

Best tilapia I have made and my 8-year-old son said "This is so good!  The best fish I've ever had."   I didn't even have lemon juice and I don't like celery salt but this was still delicious.  When adding cheese mixture I sprinkled panko crumbs over the top and this is really the key.  It made the fish light and crispy instead of soggy which can sometimes happen with a butter/mayo mixture.  I would not make recipe without the panko because it's that good!  You could make this lower calorie by omitting the mayo which I will try next time-I don't think I will notice the difference.  I actually felt bad that my husband was working because we didn't leave him any leftovers. :)

ADD FRESH BASIL AND TOMATO: This was one of the best white fish recipies I've ever had.  I just added my own twist by laying fresh basil leaves and tomato slices on top.  It was delicious! I sprinkled Old Bay on the fish like others suggested, and I didn't add dried basil to the sauce.  I cooked as suggested, but once the sauce on the fish stated to brown (about 1 minute) I took it out and laid fresh basil leaves on top (about 3-4 leaves per filet, just to cover a good portion of the surface area with a single layer).  Then I dabbed a tiny bit of sauce on each leaf to act as a glue and laid a round thin tomato slice over that (one tomatoe slice per basil leaf).  I sprinkled a little salt and a pinch of sugar on the tomato to caramelize in the broiler and put the fish back in for another minute.  The fresh basil added so much more flavor than dried basil and the soft tomato and fresh herb cut the super cheesy richness.  It was a perfect compliment to the sauce and also looked beautiful.  My boyfriend loved this dish.  It's like a tilapia bruschetta!

I bought an uncooked pecan crusted tilapia filet from the fish section at Whole Foods and used this recipe on it. It was oh so yummy and better than any fish I've ever had! I made it with parmeson risotto which went really well with it.  I highly reccomend this recipe!

Excellent dish.  The topping compliments the fish superbly.  Make sure the butter is very soft, though, so it can be spread evenly over the fish.

Fish can't get much better than this.
I did follow all the recommendations by
(Reviewed on Oct. 30, 2006 by Shannon)  and was thrilled with the results.  As were the entire family.  There were no leftovers, even from the children who always have leftovers when it comes to fish.  Thank you for the recipe.  We will make again.

This was good, don't get me wrong.  But as an avid fish cooker, I just didn't find it as insanely amazing as most people rated it.  It was a bit messy, as well.  I ended up adding garlic and old bay, and squeezing extra lemon on this when done, because it just needed a bit more kick.  When it comes down to it, nothing can beat simply marinating fish in some lemon and olive oil with a ton of fresh garlic and a bit of salt and pepper for an hour or so, then sauteeing it on a hot stove for a few minutes (painless, fast, and less clean up).  I like to try new things, nonetheless.  Thanks, it was enjoyable.

In the summertime, we like to BBQ salmon, but other than that, I really don't know how to cook fish!  So, in trying to incorporate fish into our diets for good health, I decided to buy Tilapia.  I had no idea how to prepare it, so I looked for the easiest and best-reviewed recipe I could find.  And here it was!  This Broiled Tilapia Permesan was absolutely DEE-LISH!!  I sprinkled a little bit of garlic pepper on the fish before cooking, and it was heavenly.  In the creamy topping, I used low-fat sour cream in place of the mayo, and about half the Parmesan cheese.  Excellent Tilapia, and it couldn't have been easier to prepare!  Served it with fresh-steamed broccoli and whole wheat cous-cous.  This one's a keeper!! :)

I'm very impressed.  My wife is allergic to most fish, so I don't get it often.  I made a few adjustments, some out of necessity.  I followed other reviews and added old bay directly on the fish, and garlic in the sauce.  I also used dried lemon peel in lieu of the juice, and subbed celery seed for celery salt.  When it came time to get the parm, I realized I had none.  So I finely shredded some whole milk mozzarella, and it worked out just fine.  I will try this again with the mozz, parm, romano and possibly a little asiago.  Thanks!

This is the BEST fish recipe I have ever tried.  It is so quick, easy, and absolutely delicious!  I do not agree at all with one reviewer who said this sauce is too pungent for a mild fish like tilapia.  I think this sauce complements tilapia wonderfully.  Everyone in my home loved it, and that's saying a lot, since my youngest son is such a picky eater.  

I only made a couple slight changes (only because I was using what I had on hand).  I didn't have onion powder, so I used garlic powder.  Also, I didn't have FRESH parmesan cheese, so I combined grated parmesan cheese from a plastic canister I had and fresh mozzarella.  Other than that, I followed directions.

This recipe definitely makes you want to add more fish to your diet.  Thanks for sharing!

I tried this for my husband, a faithful fish lover, and he LOVED it! I followed the suggestions and added some breadcrumbs for texture because the topping will slide right off as it melts. I serve it on a bed of rice with some steamed veggies, and now he requests it often. Thanks for the great recipe!

Oh, so yummy!  I used lingcod.  Following the advice of other reviewers, I omitted the lemon juice and added bread crumbs (Italian bread crumbs was what I had on hand).  I loved the taste of this topping and that little bit of gooey goodness from the cheese.

This was very good. It sounds like a weird combination of ingredients but was awesome. I didn't use any celery salt since I didn't have any and I just used a small pinch of salt or you could use Old Bay in place of it. Don't go too salt happy though! This was YUMMY!

Delicious flavor! Absolutely loved it! I did season it with old bay while broiling first 4 min... added a nice flavor.  I also used celery seeds vs salt... definitely a keeper.

This is excellent and I've had to make it twice this week due to requests! I did make one slight change and omitted the pepper, onion powder, and celery salt. I used 1 tsp. old bay seasoning and a dash of garlic powder. It turned out great!

I loved this! I did take a few of the other reviewers suggestion and seasoned the fish first, I used Chesapeake bay seasoning, but old bay any other would be good also.  I also used a little less butter. Very good, will definitely make this again.  So easy!

This was good.  The next time i would cut back on the cheese.  It was a bit overwhelming.

Perfect! I've made this twice already first for my mother and then for my boyfriend, they both Loved it!! My favorite part about it was that they couldnt figure out what was on it? The taste was soo good, but very unique!   Going into my recipe box!!

yummy! I just ended up baking them. If you broil use fresh fish,not frozen filets. I added just a skinch of ranch dressing to help stretch it. Just barely had enough to cover 2 pounds of fish. Worked out good!

I am NOT an avid fish lover but I'm trying to eat better and feed my family healthier meals. I decided to give this recipe a shot and I have to say I was suprised at how delicious this turned out! At first it smelled a little 'fishy' and I knew I wouldn't be able to get past the slightest fishy smell or taste. Believe me, I tasted NONE. I forgot to buy lite mayo so I cut it in half and used about a tablespoon and a half of Kraft Light 3 Cheese Ranch dressing and I used garlic powder instead of onion. I can not stress how good this was. THANK YOU! (oh, I did sprinkle a little Ol Bay on each piece during baking)

My husband said it was the BEST meal I have ever made!  I didn't have the specific herbs and spices, so I just used Old Bay seasoning as another user recommended.  Paired it with Brown Rice and Steamed Broccoli.  SO EASY!!!

This was delicious!  I sprinkled fish with salt, pepper and garlic powder, then baked in a lemon/ butter/ white wine/ck. broth mixture first, just enough to almost cover the fish (350 for 20 mins).  Then topped with parm mixture and broiled until bubbly.  The kids when crazy for this!!  We loved it too!

Another highly-rated and reviewed allrecipes.com recipe that didn't disappoint!  The fish was mild and flaky and the topping added a nice flavor.  I used Old Bay to season the filets and then added about 1/4 cups of panko breadcrumbs to the topping to give it a little more body.  Yum!

This is a great recipe, I have been making it for a long time.  Everything is great with the recipe, however I usually double the sauce.  That is my personal preference, as the parmesan sauce makes the dish and the original recipe doesn't yield quite enough for my taste.  All in all, great recipe!

I was studying for finals and needed a quick and easy recipe for Talapia and luckily I found this recipe. I didn't have all the ingredients so I had to improvise. I pulled out my food processor and I dumped in the parmesan cheese, frozen margarine and mayo. Whiz it up to break down the margarine and then I added salt, pepper, onion powder, old bay seasoning, celery seed, paprika, and dried parsley. It was really thick so I included some half-n-half and water. I folded some shredded cheese into the mix. I put the Talapia in a glass baking dish and dumped the mix on top then wrapped it in foil. OMG it was amazing and it’s fantastic with brown rice!!! Thanks for posting this recipe.

I have used this recipe for over a year now, and it is by far my favorite tilapia recipe.  I sometimes add more parmesan.  Sometimes I also double the parmesan sauce.  When I do this, I have to take the fish out after broiling it with the sauce, transfer to another dish and broil it until it's as brown as I like it.  If I don't transfer the fish when I double the sauce, it ends to kind of mushy and never sets up.  This is no fault of the recipe or the author of the recipe; it's just because sometimes I like extra sauce on top and need to adjust for that.

this recipe is so "off the hook" no pun intended :O)... anyhow, I have used it on several different types of white fish.  I also like to sprinkle the fish with Old Bay and about 1/2 a cup of bread crumbs before doing anything, then I also add paprika, garlic poweder and a smidge of crushed red pepper to the mayo mixture, as for the cheese, I use whatever I have on hand.  I have used cheddar, mozzarella, mexican mix cheese and italian mix cheese.  I like the cheddar the best but that is just me.  This recipe my children request and they hate white fish, now when I say white fish for dinner they say "is the mayo one" if I say yes, they stay home for dinner and nobody mysteriously comes down with an ill tummy before dinner ;O)

This was the first time I ever made tilapia and only the second time I had ever eaten it!  After having tilapia in a seafood dish while on vacation, I thought I'd try to make it when I got home.  After looking for a recipe, this one was intriguing and I was really glad I tried it.  I made several modifications only because I was trying to make it lower in WW points!  :)   I mixed together (approximate amounts) 2T. reduced fat mayo, 2T. romano cheese, 2T. butter, 1/2 tsp. garlic powder, and black pepper.  I also seasoned both sides of the filet with Old Bay, broiled for 3 minutes on the dark vein side, flipped and spread on the mix and broiled for an additional 4 minutes and it was done!  Super easy, super fast, and OH SO TASTY!

I'm not always a big fan of fish, but I love this one!  I scaled to 4 servings for the ingredients and would always make 3 or 4 pieces of tilapia I got from Costco (individually wrapped filets).  This way I could put a lot of topping on each piece.  This fish went over well in our house too.  Quick meal.

This is the best fish recipe.  I took the advice of past reviews and added 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper, 1/2 cup of Panko bread crumbs, and 1/8 teaspoon of garlic powder. Some omit the lemon juice in the recipe but I kept it and like the flavor it adds.  Also, I dusted the fish with Old Bay prior to broiling.    My kids loved it and my husband said in any restaurant one would pay $28 for such a dish!

Very good, followed the directions with no modifications (well, technically I did...used low fat mayo).  Delicious and easy...will definitely make again.

WOW!  My husband made this tonight.  We didn't have celery salt so he just left it out. It doesn't need it because the parmesan has enough saltiness to it.    I NEVER eat fish so I had planned something else for me.  I tasted this and OMG, it was AMAZING.  Really yummy!  My 3 boys (1 didn't like fish before this) gobbled it up!!  We are planning on trying this coating on butterflied chicken breasts also.  THANK you for the recipe!

With almost 5000 reviews, I wasn't going to add my 2 cents, but here it is anyway. Followed the recipe to the letter, very good, quick and simple. This recipe is all about the crust, which tilapia is the perfect carrier for, and it was divine. As the recipe says, just make sure you don't overcook your fish. It really does take only minutes to put this delicious dish on the table.

This is an awesome recipe. I got my G/F to eat fish FINALLY and she LOVED it!!! She would always say, "I'm not eating fish, fish is nasty!" Well I got her to eat salmon patties last week and now this awesome recipe and it's changed her tune about fish!! If you have someone who's scared to eat fish make them try this it may change their tune as well. Thank You, Phoebe!!

This is the only way my picky kids will eat fish (besides fish sticks of course)!  It doesn't need to brown on the top for them, they love it either way as do I.  It's perfect for summer dish when you don't want to stand over the hot stove cooking.  We served with a cold pasta salad loaded with veggies!

I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and added 1/2 cup of bread crumbs to the topping. This was soooo good. People who weren't fish lovers really enjoyed it too.

So easy, healthy (use low fat mayo, less butter), and tasty.  The sauce has as a rich flavor that goes well with the fish.  I have made this a couple of times and plan on keeping it in my rotation.

Other than substituting regular salt for the celery salt (I didn't have any on hand), I followed the recipe exactly and the results were disappointing. The taste of the mayonnaise overpowered everything, and not in a good way. I won't be making this again.

I'm giving this 3 stars because I didn't like it at all but my husband did. I did a couple of things differently, I used a garlic and herb mayo and added salt and pepper and old bay before broiling, like a previous poster had suggested. I also used 1/4 c of parmesan and 1/4 c of cheddar because that's what I had at home. I won't be making this again.

My husband that can't stand the taste or smell of fish LOVED this meal and my almost 4 yr old ate a whole piece too. The only change I made was using mayo with olive oil because thats all I had. I would definitely make this again, its super easy to make and to clean up.

What an awesome recipe!!  I'm always on the lookout for different ways to prepare tilapia.  I had to change the recipe a bit and I think I will prepare it that way from now on.  I used fresh basil and an actual onion and celery stalk.  I threw all ingredients into a food processor and it made a nice mixture.  Turned out awesome!  I'm passing this recipe on to many others.

Fast, easy and yummy!  I only used 1 lb. tilapia, but kept the amount of topping the same.  It was a little greasy, so next time I might reduce the butter.  I love how quick this recipe is, perfect for a weeknight meal after work!****Update 8/17/11: I still love this recipe. I use 1 lb. tilapia, but keep the same amount of topping. However, I use only 2 Tbsp. butter.

This recipe was great!  My fiance is not a huge fan of fish but will tolerate it on occasion.  He LOVED this dish!  Also easy to make quickly!  This recipe will be made on a regular basis!

This was fantastic!  I used salmon and had to broil 4 mins on each side.  I sprinkled salt, garlic powder, and sweet basil on salmon before broiling.  Mixed together butter, mayo, cheese, and added 5 crushed up ritz crackers to mixture.  Spread mixture over broiled salmon and put back under broiler for another minute.  This was great.

My boyfriend liked the dish but I wasnt a big fan.  I was so paranoid about over cooking the fish that I under cooked it. (my fault)  But apart from that the topping just wasnt that great.  It didnt get brown for me and the parm. tasted really grainy.

The perfect last minute meal. Healthy, tastes amazing, fast and easy to make. It even looks impressive enough to trick guests into thinking it's a fancy dish. LOVED IT!

My kids really hate fish.  Seriously.  Hate.  Fish.  I served this for dinner and now my kids still hate fish, but they LOVE tilapia! :)  My only problem?  Getting that yucky smell out of my house ASAP.  Any tips or tricks?

This was awazing. I know all the chef's say DO NOT put fish and cheese together but this was delicious. I absolutely loved it. It ads something nice to a boring fish night. Will do again

Okay, seriously, I was super impressed. This tasted like fish coming out of a restaurant! And it was unbelievably easy to make! Also, all of the ingredients are usually at hand, so it makes this recipe more than perfect. I actually didn't use tilapia fish, I used white basa fish fillets, but I think any fish fillet would work here. Don't hesitate to try this recipe out. If there were more than 5 stars, I would give it more! Thanks Phoebe for this excellent and easy recipe! :)

It was a total hit!!! I love seafood but never really learned any recipies as my mother HATES it!! I always had to go out to eat if I wanted any. But yea, ABSOLUTE HIT!! I reccomend this to someone who wants a super quick and easy meal that everyone will love. I did a few tweaks to it as well though: Instead of onion powder in the mix I put onion salt straight on the fillets (both sides) to broil before the mix was added. Also used celery seeds because I had no celery salt. I doubt that'll make a huge differance though. Added garlic!!! Other than that, I have to say, this recipie made me feel like a 5 star chef and everyone loved it. Served with a ceasar salad, raspberry italian dressing, garlic bread and blackberry merlot... Which I dont suggest lol Thanks Phoebe!!!

I loved it but the family did not.  It was so easy and very moist.  I was surprised by the simplicity and big  flavor from such few ingredients.  I had everything on hand which made it nice.

This was my first and last time having tilapia. It had way too much lemon, and the fish itself is very bland.

I think my butter mixture was too soft when I spread it on the fish because most of dripped right off as soon as it went into the oven and the fish didn't retain a ton of flavor. I like the idea, but I think I'll add a little extra seasoning next time around.

We loved this recipe.  It's super easy & fast.  I cut the recipe for the topping in half b/c I only had one pound of fish.  Next time, I'll make the full recipe for the topping b/c we loved it so much.  Thanks!

This is one of our favorite dinner recipes, not to mention my absolute favorite way to eat fish. It was so flavorful and very easy. I did not have celery salt so I used some celery seed and regular table salt. I have also used canned parmesan and fresh and both are delicious. Also, there were times I was without lemon juice and  a splash of white vinegar did the trick.

SO EASY and SO delicious. WOW. I added a ton of lemon, just because we love that flavor with fish... served it with/over instant broccoli cheddar rice... it hit the spot and was so good. We had a fresh green crunchy salad with it. Perfect.

This recipe is delicious. I did use a little less lemon juice than the recipe called for because I didn't want the fish to taste too tangy. I also added old bay To the fish as others suggested and that made the dish exceptional. This is definately a recipe worth giving a try.

This was pretty tasty; I do have a few picky eaters and one who doesn't like fish but he tried it at least.  Hubby liked it quite a bit.  :)

I normally find Tilapia just ok, and have never found a recipe that wowed me. Well... this was amazing and gets a WOW!  The coating is so good and the dish is so easy.  I added bread crumbs as suggested, and sprinkled the fish with a Parmesian Herb seasoning that I found in my spice cabinet, really yummy.  Otherwise, kept the recipe as is.  This one is a keeper!

This was VERY easy and quick. Per previous suggestions, I added garlic powder, paprika and bread crumbs to the mixture (which I would highly recommend for a bit of a crust/crunch to it). I sprinkled the fish with a little old bay as well.  My boyfriend was very impressed and my 10 year old daughter who refuses to eat fish LOVED it and requested it for next week! Thank you for posting... this will be a regular in our home!

I made this according to the recipe with the addition of garlic and paprika to the topping.  I grilled the tilapia fillets vein side up for the first two minutes, flipped them and grilled for another two, then finished them with the topping for three. Perfect!!

What a simple and tasty way to make fish.  I omitted the celery salt since I didn't have any, and added Old Bay to each side as others have done.  Next time I might add some bread crumbs or panko for a little crunch.  But, it's wonderful as it is!

Super Good! I cook it in a deeper, smaller dish so that all the fish filets are touching. This makes seems to make more sauce, guess it doesn't cook off this way. So yummy!

I just LOVE this recipe and have made it so many times for my husband who especially loves it and would eat it every night if I would make it that often! I've introduced it to my family (sister, mom, inlaws) and they have adored it as well. It's just the perfect combo of lemon and parmesan, a hint of basil etc. I must say though, that I do use less butter and am generous with the fresh lemon juice. It's such a versatile recipe. This is what I do: I line a baking sheet (cookie sheet) with foil and spray with Pam, then sprinkle salt and pepper over what I have just sprayed. Then I place the Tilapia down. I usually get 3 filets which equal 1 lb of fish. (I adjust the sauce ingredient amounts according to how much fish I have). I broil the fillets for about 4 min, then flip, and broil for 4 min more, then cover with the lemony cheese sauce and broil again for about 4 min. Granted, I don't like my fish undercooked, but don't like it overcooked either. I always have such great success with this recipe. This will be in my recipe box for years to come and will be most definitely passed on! It's fantastic!

This was incredible!  I would suggest not varying the recipe too much.  I did, however, make it even easier by shaking Tones Salmon & Seafood seasoning on both sides before broiling.  That added lemon and dill, among other flavors to the fish.  Then I spread the butter/mayo/parmesan mixture on top and broiled a couple more minutes until brown and bubbly.  I served this with rice, steamed broccoli, and sliced tomatoes.  My husband said that this fish has replaced steak as his favorite meal...how about that?!

What do I say?!  This dish was simply OUTSTANDING!!! My husband loved it.  He was sure there was crab somewhere (now that's a thought). I think it was the parmesan taste.  I must say, I found this dish 20 minutes before I was to begin cooking and what a treasure it was.  I included some of the suggestions (garlic powder, old bay, paprika) and it was just delicious.  I will definitely, w/o a doubt, make this dish again.  And maybe add a little crab.  Yum!

YUMMY!!! My husband and 5-year-old loved it. I added a few ingredients after reading reviews. Lightly sprinkled fillets with Old Bay. Added 1/8 ts salt, 1/8 ts garlic powder, 1/16 ts Smoked paprika and cayenne pepper. Also I only used half of the butter and parmesan. Came out PERFECT and will DEFINITELY make again!!!

WOW!!!!I used garlic powder and seasoned salt in place of the onion powder and celery salt and it was still wonderful. My wife isn't big on seafood, but she could'nt get enough of this dish. Added fresh basil the second time I made it and It Was to Die For!! Great recipe!!

This is incredible.  I eat a lot of tilapia, and this is my favorite variation.  I don't actually measure any of the ingredients, and don't use the celery salt, but it is still ridiculously good.  I made it for a dinner, and my guests all enjoyed it as well. Thanks!

I cut down on the lemon juice a little and added garlic powder and old bay seasoning. I broiled the fish for 4 minutes, added sauce and then put it back in for 1-2 minutes (til brown). Next time I make this I am going to cut down on the celery salt a little and use fresh garlic instead of powdered.

I've been making this recipe (as written) for a while and my family loves it. Tonight I had to throw something together quickly without running to the store. I had no Tilapia on hand but had some Orange Roughy in the freezer. It has a little more moisture than the tilapia so it fell apart much easier when transferring to a serving dish, but the flavor was still delicious. I use fresh grated parmesan, which I think makes it more flavorful than the "powdered" stuff, and tonight I used fresh basil from my garden and I think it enhanced the flavor even more! Highly recommend for even the pickiest eaters.

I have been making this recipe for a year now, and just realized I never rated it.  This is one of my favorite fish recipes of all time.  I add about 1/4 cup of Italian flavored breadcrumbs, and I also find that if you put the mixture in the refrigerator for about 15-20 minutes prior, it seems to spread on better to the hot fish.  My husband gobbles this down and he doesn't care for white fish at all. You will not be disappointed with this recipe.

I wish I would have tried the suggestion of refrigerating the topping beforehand, because my attempt was quite sloppy. The taste was okay though.

Made this for supper the other night and loved it. My husband ate it without complaint which is great!!  I doubled the sauce and served some of the sauce over rice.  Will make this again!

My 4 year old and 20 month old who don't usually like fish very much gobbled up the whole tray and not much was left for the parents.  I used fat free tub butter and fat free mayo and it was still wonderful.

My family really enjoyed this recipe, even my picky toddler. I felt all the seasonings worked very well, but next time I plan on reducing the amount of butter. 1/4 C. butter is a bit much, and I ended up with a bit more grease at the bottom of the pan than I generally like. This one is going into my "to make for guests" file!

This would probably be a good dish for someone who didn't particularly like fish, but we felt like the topping overpowered the delicate tilapia.

I was unsure about the Parmesan flavor being in this but nothing ventured nothing gained. This was surely worth the risk. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect. Not only that but it was a nice quick and simple meal to make. Best part was, I had everything I needed in my cabinet and fridge already so I didn't need to even run to the store. That don't happen often. Loved it!

This is not only super fast to prepare, but my family LOVED it!  My husband made me make it three days later.  The parmesan melts on top of the fish to form a nice crust and really "traps" in the rest of the flavors.  This is definitely the best way I've found to prepare Tilapia.

Very good! The Parmesan topping gives the fish an excellent flavor.  I also like that this dish can be made in minutes.  I served it with couscous (another very quick dish to cook) and a broccoli. Yum!

This was amazing!  I used the "bag o Tilapia" from WalMart and the little lemon shaped lemon juice dispenser.  It was VERY good!  It came to a nice crispy brown color and was to die for.  It's definitely a staple in the collection as far as cooking Tilapia is concerned.  YAY!

Very easy, quick, and yummy recipe.  The parmesan really makes it!  I only had 1 pound of fish but still made the same amount of sauce.  I think if I do that next time I'll cut the butter in half but keep everything else the same.  Maybe I'd even add more parmesan because that really made the dish.  Could use a little garlic too.  Great meal for a busy weeknight!

This was delicious so easy.  I had never used the broiler on my oven before, and in my attempting to learn how, I accidentally locked my oven closed.  So instead, I used the broiler on my toaster oven and it worked perfectly--much easier than working with the big oven, especially when I'm just cooking for myself!

Excellent flavor, but WAY too much fat!!! I recommend significantly cutting down on the fatty ingredients because the topping is VERY greasy. I'll try this recipe again for the wonderful flavor, but I'll hack out most of the fat.

I think the cheese was a little overpowering. I'd make this again but I'd use less of the sauce on my fish. My wife loved it so I'll put more on hers and less on mine.

Yummy!  I read several reviews (including the very few bad ones) and have to agree that this is a keeper.  It was so easy to make.  The sauce was delicious after broiling as it browned the Parmesan cheese giving it an almost nutty flavor, and yet the herbs and lemon juice kept it perfectly tart.  I followed the recipe almost as written except I reduced the mayonaise a bit (based on a recommendation) and used a combo of ground celery seed and salt instead of the celery salt.  This would indeed be a good choice for company.

I used this mixture on extra large shrimp and it was devine. Just coated the shrimp, broiled for about 5 minutes and that's all. We cook a lot of shrimp so I was really happy to find this recipe for fish which I thought looked really good for shrimp. 

Also used tilapia the same meal with the same recipe. Did a little seafood night. 

If ya all try my suggestion of the shrimp  variation, please keep in mind that you should use shrimp with the shell off. Other wise all the yummy is getting thrown away with the shell. And you will not need to flip the shrimp over. They will cook in zoom time. 

I will also try this again on other fish.

In fairness to the recipe, I have to add that this recipe made me realize that I just plain don't like Tilapia.  It may be a thin fish, but it's not a light fish...so, if you like Tilapia, you might like this recipe more than we did.

My husband said this tasted "gourmet, like I could only get it on a cruise ship!" We really enjoyed this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly the first time and the topping melted all over the pan. The second time I didn't add the parmesan to the topping mixture until right before putting it on the fish and it worked like a charm and it stayed on the fish!

Yummy recipe.  I made it with gluten free rice parmesean cheese, and my friends and I really enjoyed it. I also did what someone suggested and added some breadcrumbs (gluten free)to the mixture; it made it extra crispy.

Very good recipe!  The flavor of the parmesan & lemon stood out and are a great combination for this type of fish.  The texture was nice too.  We served this with the All Recipes Grilled Soy-Sesame Asparagus and garlic rice pilaf.

I tried this recipe twice using fresh lemon juice the first time and bottled lemon juice the second time.  It definitely tasted better with the fresh lemon juice.  FYI.

Made as recipe states except I didn't have any celery salt so I omitted it, and I used a dash of onion flakes instead of onion powder (I didn't have any of that either).  They are both present in such small quantities I don't think it mattered.  My husband said it was really good, my little kid said it was okay, and my older kid didn't like it at all, and she generally gobbles up fish.  I hate fish, so I didn't even try it.  What I liked was that it was easy to make and didn't stink up the house, but all the butter in the topping made a pool of grease on the foil.  Ick.  FAR too much butter in this recipe.  And despite my husband liking the taste, none of us liked how it looked.  My kids saw it after I pulled it out of the oven and said "Gross!  What IS that?"  Sorry, but I won't be making this one again.

I HATE fish, but my husband loves Tilapia. So, I set out on a quest to find a fish recipe that I could tolerate. To my surprise, this is really good! I've been using this recipe for a couple of years now. It's an easy recipe and can be made quickly, which is awesome. This tends to be our "we have to eat quick" meal. The only thing I did differently is substitute celery seed for the celery salt and add a bit of garlic. Other than that, it's awesome!

The sauce is to die for here, the tilapia is just a lucky recipient of such yummy sauce. I always add a little paprika and use celery seed instead of celery salt when I make it. Oh, and lite mayo to knock off a couple calories. 

This sauce is so good that I've used it with a few drops of oil to thin it down as a salad dressing or in pitas. We're talking, "I want to lick the bowl clean" good!

Very simple and good taste. Instead of salt and pepper, I add OLD BAY seasoning. I like paring it with rice and asparagus.

This was EXTREMELY good!!  I followed previous suggestions and added 1/3 cup Panko Bread crumbs (although im not sure they made a huge difference).  Instead of using all butter for the 1/4 cup called, I melted 2 tablespoons of butter, then added enough Olive Oil to make the 1/4 cup then added 1/4 tsp of Old Bay.  Well certainly be making again!

Great and I am not a fish fan.  Use fresh lemon juice for best taste.  Easy, cheap and tasty.

No butter added, but lots of spinach to make a good size pile on top of the fish which browns nicely.  I use this recipe often and for guests.

Wow!  What a great recipe!  My picky eaters gobbled it up and my 5-year-old asked for it for breakfast!!  I forgot to pick up lemons and had to use orange juice in a pinch and it turned out just fine.  Yummmmmm....!!!

Warning: while broiling, this dish smells AWFUL! but tastes GREAT! My family was making fun of me for making a dish they were gagging over, but then their expressions turned to wonder when they tasted it! I didn't use anywhere near the entire amount of sauce/glaze that the recipe made for 4 tilapia filets. Be careful how close your filets are to the broiler... 4-5 inches is plenty close!

I ran out of Parmesan and used Feta, instead. Let me tell you what my husband said (and I agree):

"Sweetheart, if Heaven had a taste to it, this is what I imagine it would taste like"

WOW! High praise...wonderful dish!

Excellent and quick!!!  My husband and I loved this meal.  I wasn't sure what to do with the tilapia I bought but this was great.  Just made a few changes:
I used fresh basil instead of dried.  I used garlic powder not celery salt.  I baked it for 20 minutes at 450 degrees.  I also put Old Bay on the fish and in the mixture I added a pinch of paprika and 1/2 cup of bread crumbs.  I will add this to my regular recipe collection.

Very tasty!  I thought the celery salt was a little overbearing, so I used less the next time I made it & it was perfect.  I also just put the topping on the fish & baked it, rather than the broil method.  Great recipe, I've been making it every week!

The topping was a bit too heavy-handed on the lemon.  I think it could be improved by using some of the lemon juice in a marinade for the fillets.  I'll try tweaking the recipe on the next go round.  *Update - Sprinkling the fillets with garlic powder before cooking improves the flavor.  The topping  more easily remains on the tilapia while cooking if it is made in advance & chilled before using.

Not much left to say after almost 3,000 reviews.  This was so good!  Wonderful flavor for an otherwise flavorless fish.  Super easy and super fast, will definitely be making this one again and again and again...  Served with Brazilian White Rice from this site.

Fantastic recipe. The slight change I make is I add a little bit of bread crumbs to the mix to stiffen it up because when you put it on the hot filets it thins out quickly. I also sprinkle a little bit of bread crumbs on top to give it a little crunch. This is just personal taste though, the recipe is excellent just the way it is.

This recipe is amazing! I use thawed frozen tilapia loins. Used light mayo and a small amount of butter. I had asparagus in the oven, so I sauteed the fish in EVOO for a few minutes on each side (like other reviewers I sprinkled both sides with Old Bay). Then I put it under the broiler with the mixture. Tasted like something that would come from an expensive seafood restaurant. A++

We loved it! It's so easy and quick to make. I also added some panko, garlic pwdr, dash of cayenne and paprika. I also used lowfat mayo (which I am NOT a fan of!) and u couldn't tell the difference! My 2 year old loved it (woohooo) I'll make this often.

This was wonderful!! My husband loved it. I made recommended changes: using old bay on each side before broiling and after I put the topping on, I added panko breadcrumbs that I made to the topping, and I added a little bit of shredded cheese to the topping as well. Tasted great, and I will definitely make it again.

First off, I am not in anyway a seafood eater.  I want to be, but I can't get past the fishiness.  This recipe is perfect!  I actually loved it, and made it exactly as written.  It is rare you find a recipe that doesn't need tweaking, this is the one!  I will make this often.

TASTY TASTY TASTY!!! My husband and I both really loved this.  

I did make a few changes: I used half of a shredded romano parmesan and half the fine parmesan cheese to make up the 1/2 cup required.  I added, as suggested by another reviewer, a 1/2 cup of seasoned bread crumbs as well.  I half melted some I Can't Believe... spread in place of the butter and used light miracle whip in place of the mayo to reduce calories and fat. I also minced a large clove of garlic and mixed it in with the mayo/butter/seasoning mix.  

I didn't have any celery salt, but figured with the bread crumbs being seasoned I really didn't need to add anything in place of it.  I did sprinkle a dash of salmon seasoning in with the basil, though.

It turned out great even without using real butter or mayo, which I was worried about. I used a previously frozen tilapia from a bag, so I think that caused a little bit of watery consistency under the fish.  But the fish was moist and flaky, and the topping was tangy and delish so it was still five stars for me.

I have been a lurker on this site for quite some time but this recipe is amazing!  I just had to rate it!  The only thing I did different was to take the advice of some other reviewers and add some Old Bay seasoning to the fish prior to broiling.  This will definitely be a regular meal in our home.

This was fantastic, even my 2 year old daughter loved it.  I did add bread crumbs to the mixture, about 1/3 cup, because I used shredded parmesan cheese so it was a little runny.

I love this recipe.  My husband doesn't normally like fish unless it is deep fried so it doesn't have the "fishy" taste.  He said this recipe eliminates any of the "fishyness", so we love it, and it is so fast and easy, you can put this together very last minute!

Tried this recipe to the 't' and it was increadible.  I doubled the recipe with 4 fillets over a bed of rice and made a great lunch for work the next day as well!  
Thanks!

this recipe was okay.  I think if you don't like fish then this is for you however I love fish.  The topping was good but it really masked the taste of the fish.

I substituted flounder for the tilapia and it was great. The topping was much more delicately flavored than I expected and it worked with the flounder perfectly. I suspect the topping would also work well on shrimp, chicken or pork and would be great mixed into white rice as the base for a dish. Thanks & well done Phoebe!

This was wonderful and so quick and easy.  Will definitely be putting this on the regular rotation.  I made only the following changes - added some fresh parsley to the topping and sprinkled some bread crumbs over the topping to create more crust (as recommended by other reviewers.)  I might try substituting different white fish next time depending on what's on sale at my supermarket.  Really a wonderful recipe!  Thanks for sending it in!

Very good & super easy!! I added Panko bread crumbs to the topping and it came out perfectly. My boyfriend was worried he wouldn't like this because it was fish but he ate it up anyway and said he would eat it again. I thought it even reheated well. I will definitely make this again. Delish!

It was good.  I seasoned with Old Bay Seasoning and added Italian bread crumbs to the mixture.  Next time I make this, I think I'll add garlic and cut down on the lemon juice.

We love this recipe.  It's so fast to make and the fish is moist and light.  I don't normally have celery salt so I don't bother putting it in.  
But then the one time I made this, I accidentally grabbed the garlic powder instead of onion powered...so I ended up using both.  It turned out really good.  So I add garlic powder all the time now.

Love it!  I followed the recipe as is and WOW - another dinner to add to my rotation.  Also tried with Cod and it too was terrific.  Next time I'll try some of the reviewers suggestions - but this will do just fine without any changes.

For best results- add 1 tablespoon of bread crumbs- it help topping stay together and not slide off fish.  Aso season fish with seasoning salt to tast or fish will be very bland.

Very tasty!  I made the sauce and was thinking that it sounded a little fatty but decided at the last minute to throw it on the fish and it was incredible!  My husband has requested that I make it a second time this week and he's not a big fish eater.  Great recipe!

This was just okay for me.  It was difficult to get the topping on the fish since it was hot coming out of the oven.  I would make it again, but I need to figure out what was missing from the recipe that made it just okay.  I have used this topping on slices of tomatos from the garden.  I just spread a dollop on a thick slice of tom and bake until browned. I enjoyed it that way more!

This is super yum! Since it's just me, I cut it to 2 servings. I'm not big on Parmesan, so I just sprinkled dried Parmesan in the bowl and used Mozzarella cheese instead. I used celery bits instead of salt and added Panko bread crumbs. I think next time I will let the fish sit in lemon juice since I enjoy the lemon taste.

Delicious. I wish I'd have added bread crumbs per other reviews, as the topping runs off. Next time I will also add some garlic powder, as well as some cayenne. Far from having TOO much lemon, we loved it with EXTRA squeezed on!

I love Tilapia cause I don't like a fishy taste but since it's a mild fish it needs a little more then what this has to offer.    This is a good recipe and I will be trying it again but next time I will be seasoning the fish before broiling it then adding the mixture.  
As for the Mayo taste.  I didn't have that.  I never measure but to me if yours does I would just add more lemon juice also I used lemon pepper which is great on fish.

This recipe is perfect!  I've used it on multiple kinds of fish and my kids eat it every time!  

I usually double the topping and sometimes I add breadcrumbs and bake instead of broil, but it really doesn't need any modifications.

We LOVE this recipe and eat it often.  I have modified it to a slightly healthier version because I am on Weight Watchers.  I use low fat mayo and omit the butter. I do use just enough olive oil to get the texture to "spreadable".  It still tastes fabulous!

I have made this so many times.  It is one of my most favorite recipes.  Quick, easy, and delicious!  My husband and toddler love it.  Actually my toddler always wants 2nds!  Goes great on top a bed of rice.  We rarely have leftovers from this recipe. Excellent!!!

I substitued fresh basil for the dried and added a little more salt. Even my 7 year old cleaned his plate. This was quick and very good. Will cook again (and again).

Yummy!  I make extra of the topping to make sure I have enough. My husband said he didn't like tilapia.  I made this dish, he said he loved it, then I told him it was tilapia. He still wants more. My picky son even wanted seconds. The second time I made it I followed some of the reviewers suggestions and used a little old bay seasoning on the fish. This made it even better.

Came out perfect!~I followed other reviewer's advice and also added in some breadcrumbs, think that is what helped to keep it all together and give it just a tad crispness~yum, yum, yummy! I used light mayo, but real butter for the flavor, just cut down the amount a tad.

The first time we tried this on the grill and then the next time on the broiler - the broiler made a HUGE difference. I made the directions per Shannon's review, and it was absolutely delicious! My husband kept telling me that he doesn't eat fish and probably wouldn't even try it - but he ate two huge fillets and probably would have eaten more if there would have been anymore left! Thank you so much!

This was absolutely delightful!! My husband loved it and so did I! I modified it slightly by adding bread crumbs (1/2 cup) and a little paparika. The fish cooks really fast so be careful not to over cook!!! I will definately make again.

Use the most-expensive, fresh parmesan that your budget allows and you will not be disappointed when the flavors of this dish collide!  This is a regular in our household and I pair it with fresh greens and wild rice.  YUM!

Wow -who would have thought this could be so good? I modified as follows: seasoned raw fish with Old Bay before broiling; used fresh basil in the topping and served with basil chiffonade on a bed of rice; used panko in the topping which made it hold together better and brown really nicely. I had fresh walleye instead of tilapia, but this would work well with any flat, whitefish that's too thin to grill! Everybody raved and there wasn't a speck of food left. Easy AND a crowd pleaser, it doesn't get much better!

Extremely easy to make and it tasted very nice.  It's much lighter than your usual chicken parmesan, since tilapia is such a mild fish.  Gets kind of pricey when tilapia is $4.99/lb., but it's a light, healthy meal.

This is my FAVORITE tilapia recipe. I make it all the time.  I always use Old Bay but like many reviewers I've modified it many different ways with spices. If I'm in the mood for heat, I'll turn up the paprika and red pepper. Sometimes I make it extra cheesy. It seems like  no matter what you do with this base recipe, it will be great!

Finally a recipe that makes tilapia actually taste good!  I have never been a fan of tilapia - I prefer more flavorful varieties like haddock, mahi mahi, sea bass, salmon... haddock (my favorite) is overfished so I try to avoid it.  This was very tasty and so quick and easy!  I used fresh filets (which I found to be VERY economical, btw!), fresh grated parmesan cheese and since I was too lazy to soften butter in the microwave I unscrewed the top of my butter flavor spray and poured out the right amount.  Also added garlic powder.   Very tasty, although with the parmesan it did have a salty aftertaste, so I'm thinking the celery salt is optional next time.  I will definitely make this again!

The first time I made this for my family it was gone in minutes - everyone loved it!  I followed the recipe exactly.  The next time I made it I wanted to mix it up a bit, so before adding the butter-cheese-herb mixture on top of the fish I mixed in a handful of small scallops (since they are my hubby's favorite seafood) before spreading it on the fish - I didn't change the cooking times at all, and with just the 2-3 minutes under the broiler the last time it cooked the scallops perfectly, now they are a must everytime I make this!  (You could probably do it with baby shrimp as well...)

Wow! What a great way to get my 4-year-old and my 2-year-old boys to eat fish! I only had 1 lb of Tilapia, but I made the full amount of topping mixture. I only used half of it for the fish. The other half? I boiled some angel hair pasta and tossed the hot pasta with the warmed mixture! YUM! I also mixed a bunch of diced green onion into the pasta and fish which not only made the dish pop with color, but flavor as well. This is one of my favorite recipes! thank you!

Wow!  Definitely on the repeat list!  I made a lower fat version with non-fat yogurt instead of mayo and Olivia instead of butter and it still turned out wonderful.   My 10 year old, who loves fish, said we should have it every night and my 14 year old said it was actually OK (high praise, since she won't eat fish!!)

AWESOME!!!  Finally a fish recipe that BOTH of my kids will eat!!  My 8yo daughter kept saying "mmmmm... I like this chicken".  LOL  So that says quite a bit for it's mildness.  :)  The thing to remember w/ tilapia (that I learned the hard way) is to make sure that none of your fish overlaps or touches the other pieces or it will have a very strong fishy taste -- at least that's what happened to some of mine the first time I ever cooked tilapia.  Only the parts that were touching or overlapping tasted that way, though.  The rest was the normal, yummy, mild tilapia.  GREAT RECIPE!!!!!!  A definite family fave!!!

Ok, if this wasn't the easiest, cheesiest, tastiest fish I have ever made. Superb!!

I did add garlic powder instead of onion powder. I also added 1/4 c. Italian  seasoned bread crumbs as other users suggested. Perfect! Can give this more than five stars? :)

This was a perfect recipe!  I don't think my boyfriend really likes fish as much as I do but he has asked when we are having this again!

Add a bit of mustard to the topping to kick it up a bit.  I used Boars Head Country Dijon the last time I made this and it was delicious, just don't go overboard!

Another fabulous review!  I have tried a lot of tilapia recipes and this one is the best!  I would definitely recommend the broiler pan as a method for cooking, because a lot of liquid came out of the fish - and I don't enjoy the juices running on my plate. Yummy!

WOW!! This was simply DELICIOUS!! I was looking for a good tilapia recipe, besides the same old battered fried version. I scaled the recipe down to one so I could try it for lunch, I didn't have any lemon juice, onion powder, or celery salt, so I used my favorite lemon pepper, and a little italian herbs, and probably a little bit more butter because I was cooking it alongside some frozen broccoli pieces. It turned out very juicy, the buttery juice in the pan seasoned my broccoli, and served it with a piece of garlic bread. I also didn't have any parmesan cheese, so I used a little bit of 5 cheese italian. My husband, who hates fish, but makes the best fish I know, LOVED this recipe when I made it again for dinner! This time, I added some italian style bread crumbs, and some garlic powder. I will never eat tilapia any other way. Great job!

I don't like fish and I loved this.  Also I don't typically like Parmesan cheese, but I think it really went well with the fish.  By the way, my oven has two broiling settings (low and high) and I used the low setting.

This basically tasted like boiled fish with mayo on top.  My family didn't like it.  I wouldn't know how to spice this up either.

I use different kinds of cheeses and switch the spices with different Ms. Dash blends.  I also halve tbhe butter and add bread or cracker crumbs.  This has never turned out anything but fabulous.  I frequently invite people over for dinner and they are always impressed and are surprised that it takes 15 minutes from start to finish.  If my company doesn't care for fish I have used the topping on chicken breasts also.

I just made this Tilapia for dinner, and it was awesome!  I am very picky about fish, and I usually don't like any recipe I try, but this one was really good!  I only made half the recipe for my husband and myself, and he was disappointed that he couldn't have seconds :)  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Yet another 5 star review!  I'm not much of a fish person (fish sticks are more my speed), but this was WONDERFUL!  I did cut the butter and mayo in half to save some calories and it still tasted divine.

Fast, super easy and probably the best fish I've ever had at home or in a restaurant.  My fiancé is a real meat and potatoes guy and only eats fish when I beg.  He loved this recipe so much that he is taking all of the leftovers to work for lunch.

This sauce is so easy and super tasty. A bit on the fatty side, but it's worth it once in awhile. Next time I will try a thicker/heavier fish like sea bass or halibut. The sauce is so simple and easy to use, it could work with any other fish, even salmon.

Delicious!  My kids and husband loved it and they are not big fans of fish unless it is deep fried.  This recipe is simple and quick.  Didn't have the celery salt but put some red pepper flakes on my filet to spice it up.  Yum!

Delicious and very flavorful.  I had been looking for a new idea on Talapia preperation.  When I found this recipe, and saw how many times it had been reviewed.  I knew I had to try it.  I am glad I did, as it was probably the best I have ever tasted.  My boyfriend at two helpings and he doesn't really like fish.  I didn't have any onion powder, so I used dry minced onion.  I will definately make this again.  Thanks for the post.

Delicious! I actually put the spread on salmon instead, and it was great! Can't wait to try it on white fish.

Wow...what can I say??  So quick, so easy, and really delicious.  It was a hit with my whole family, even the picky 3-year-old.  Made it just as the recipe directs except sprinkled just a bit of bread crumbs over the cheese mix before I put it in the broiler that last time.  Yummy!!

Very, very good! I do not care for fish and have always shied away from making it in the past but in as effort to eat healthier I decided to give it a try. My kids and I enjoyed this dish immensely. I used 'lite' mayo because that's what I have plus I substituted garlic powder for celery salt & onion powder for the same reason. It still turned out fantastic. Next time I may cut back or eliminate the butter to make it even more healthy. My son actually asked his sister if he could have hers! Served with steamed broccoli and salad. Excellent meal. Thanks for the recipe.

This was truly delicious.  The last 2 minutes I broiled the fish once the topping was on was too long, and they burned.  Will have to watch them carefully next time!

This recipe is awesome - however I substitute the mayo with hummus.  I personally don't like mayo and the hummus is healthier too.  I've made it several times this way and am always told it is excellent.

8-year old son- YUM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
10-year old daughter-it was the best meal I've had in a while!
6-year old son-I didn't like it, and it smelt really bad!
Husband-Excellent, would recommend sprinkling fish with a little bit of salt before broiling.
Wife-I will absolutely make this again!

Fantastic. I didn't use all of the Parmesan mixture and the fish was still very rich. I chose Halibut and plan to try this out on a few different type's of fish.

Wow, BELIEVE THE HYPE!  How could this be bad?  Parmesan, mayo and butter?!?!  SOOO delicious.  As the other reviews seem to say, this is a great base that you can season to your liking.  Like other users, I added 3 tablespoons of breadcrumbs and ended up not using celery salt.  I added dried parsley, garlic powder and a dash of hot sauce.  And I also seasoned the tilapia with seasoning salt before adding the topping.  I hate cooking fish because I’m always afraid of over/under cooking it, but I followed the instructions exactly and it was so yummy.  Thanks, Phoebe!

Hands down the best tilapia I've ever had.  It's so easy and it's my family's favorite dinner.  I make it once a week.  I followed the other reviewer's tips and added bread crumbs.  Also, it can be a little difficult to spread so I put a little olive oil on my finger and it actually makes a world of difference!

I thought this was very tasty for a quick dinner. I scaled for two servings, but my way-I halfed the cheese and butter, used only 1 tbs. of lemon juice, but left the mayo (used lite) and seasonings the same. This was very good!

This got great reviews, but my family didn't enjoy it.  I used frozen fillets which I thawed, but they got watery.  The parmesan was very salty.  It looked great but no one enjoyed eatting it.

I made this due to the enormous amount of reviews. FANTASTIC!!! Thank you so much. I am going to try this by doubling the sauce recipe and using shrimp. I think after baking I can use the sauce over linguine.

This has really terrific flavor and comes out nicely browned on top.  I may add a little sprinkle of bread crumbs next time, though it doesn't need anything.  I did cut down on some of the butter since mayo has quite a bit of fat.  Didn't have celery salt.  I seasoned the fish and squirted with spray butter before 1st round of broiling. Didn't need to flip, cooked fine.

This was great!  I cut the amount of lemon in half like others suggested.  Served over rice cooked in chicken stock.  I used disposable broiler pans and the whole meal from start to cleaning up after dinner took 40 min.

Didn't have basil on hand so used italian herb blend.  Still very tasty.  I would suggest seasoning the filets a bit prior to broiling so the filets can absorb more of the flavor.

If I could give this recipe 10 stars I would.  The only thing I changed was I didn't have lemon juice so I used orange juice. If figured 2 tablespoons wouldn't change the recipe much and I don't think it did. We will be having tilapia many more times fixed this way.  This is a keeper.

Great recipe!!! Made this tonight for my husband and my two kids ages 3 and 6. Everyone loved it. The only change I made was adding 1/2tsp of Ms Dash lemon pepper seasoning instead of the lemon juice.  Very yummy!! Thanks.

With such high reviews, I had to give this a try!  It wasn't as great as I was expecting, BUT, the kids & adults still liked it & because it was so quick and easy, I'll be making it again.  I was expecting the 'cheese' topping to crisp up, but, it comes out kind of mushy.  We like eating fish here, so, finding a quick & easy recipe everyone likes is always good!

so yummy!...this was super easy & fast to make...my roomie loved it, but i think i was expecting too much after reading the reviews...i omitted the lemon juice, used reduced-fat mayo, used celery seed instead of celery salt, fresh onion instead of onion powder, doubled the pepper, added a dash of garlice salt and a teaspoon of paprika...

I decided to try something new one night for me and my husband , and I found this recipe.  It was only my second time to ever cook fish, and my husband kept raving about how delicious it was.  Now he asks me to make it at least once a week!

Absolutely wonderful and very easy. I served it with a parmesan risotto that really complimented it. I used orange roughy instead of tilapia because I like it better than tilapia. The entire family (including my 15 and 11 year old boys) wants it to be included in the regular meal rotation. Very fast and easy, especially if you remember to thaw the fish ahead of time (which I did not).

I thought the topping was really interesting but completely overpowered the fish.  I wish I had tried the Old Bay with it.  Still pretty good though. Very quick.

Just didn't love the flavor of the parmesan with the fish. However, I used shark instead of tilapia because it was what I had in the freezer.

One of the finest fish recipes I have had, and extremely easy. The family loved it unanimously, and none of them are big on fish. I substituted Nature's Seasonings for the celery salt, onion powder and pepper and used light butter and light mayo to cut some calories off, still awesome. An outstanding recipe overall.

Yummy, and easy to make!  I followed the recipe exactly (well, minus the celery salt, as we didn't have any) and it was very good.  I might try it with some bread crumbs next time as some have suggested, just for something different.

My new favorite way to cook tilapia! I only used 1 lb. of tilapia, but followed the exact recipe for the topping, and it was just enough! I would double up on the topping for 2 lbs. tilapia!

This was a great recipe I tried a couple of months ago.  My boyfriend showed up last night with the exact same recipe (great minds think alike!) We made a few modifications - adding lemon zest and fresh basil which really lightened it up.  If you like fresh herbs it really brightens the dish.  I like it better when it is broiled a little more so the parmesan cheese browns even more on top.  I may try adding more cheese to the top after adding the mixture on it.  Spectacular base recipe to play with - thanks!

I love this recipe! Usually I make my tilapia pecan-crusted, and then follow this recipe, and it is absolutely delicious. Everyone I have made it for has loved it! We like it so much that we are having it tonight for our Christmas dinner. I lost my original copy of this recipe, so I had to print it out again. Time to go cook!

FABULOUS. I followed the recipe exactly for 4 servings (minus onion powder, which I couldn't scare up) and it was absolutely the best fish I've ever made. My boyfriend is still raving about it three days later. Will definitely become a weekly staple. Thanks!!

The broiled tilapia was excellent.  I used a little too much lemon juice - still with the 2TB. I still thought it needed something - minced garlic, maybe?  Will definitely use this recipe again and experiment.

This is SO good & so easy to prepare! I have made it a few times and I have to say that I think it came the best with the 1/2 c added breadcrumbs. Delicious! I haven't had a more tasty piece of tilapia in any restaurant!

If you're deliberating over whether or not to try this dish, TRY IT!!! It's absolutely delicious and so simple to make.  Made recipe just as stated, and it turned out so flavorful.  Hubby loved this dish as well, and since he feels that he has a "gourmet" palate, it's a great compliment!

I made this for dinner a while back and now everytime we have fish my kids ask, "is it the kind with all the melty cheese on top?"  They loved it and so did I.

This recipe is one of the best fish recipes I have ever tried!  I followed the recipe exactly and would make it again!  Even my kids who aren't big fans of fish said it was yummy and smelled delicious!

Loved this recipe - would be proud to serve it to guests and would not be disappointed to be served this in a restaurant.  I didn't use lemon juice because I didn't have any and I substituted garlic powder for celery salt because I didn't have that either.  My husband devoured his in about two minutes and was sad when he learned there was no more. Thanks for a new favorite recipe!

Okay - I'm new to the whole fish scene.  I don't care for strong tasting fish and have NEVER cooked it myself until recently.  This was my second recipe.  I could not have been more pleased!  I actually had seconds.  The toping is easy to make and talk about a time saver.  This will become a standard in our house.

This recipe was extremely easy to make, and the results were fantastic!  I prepared the recipe without the celery salt (because I didn't have any) and my family really enjoyed it!  Great taste, low cal, very easy, this recipe has it all.

This is a very delightful dish.  I was not sure if we would like the fish with the sauce on top so I made some with the sauce and some without. Of course, the fish with the sauce was gobbled up and the fish without the sauce stayed in the pan.  This is a recommended recipe for any fish lover.

this recipe is amazing with any fillet of fish or even chicken breast.  I use chicken breast with shrimp on top.  We have even used the cheese mixture on veggies in the oven. You have tp try this recipe, you will love it.

This is quite good and the kids really like it.  My only 'complaint' (if you want to call it that) is that it covers up the flavor of the fish too much.  But it does have a good different flavor.

Works well with sole too if you can't find any tilapia. I disagree with modifying the recipe by adding breadcrumbs, I find it takes away from the parmesan, and gives it a slightly harder texture.

My husband and I love this recipe. I had not cooked Tilapia before, and was a little nervous about the outcome. Now this is something we are always looking forward to. We add a little parmesan, because it tastes best with more toppings. This recipe is so easy!

So easy, and So Good!!! Absolutely no leftovers in this house, the only cheese I had on hand was an italian mix - parmesan- mozzarella-provolone- asiago mix and it was great. Will try again with a good quality parmesan.

A vert easy dish to prepare. I added 2 gloves of chopped garlic and used freshly grated parmesan cheese. Sprinkled extra cheese on top just before serving. Very good, will make again.

Simple dish with lots of great flavors. Got rave reviews from my husband. My sister enjoyed it as well and she's not a big fish eater. I added a little garlic powder since I didn't have any celery salt on hand. Also used onion flakes instead of onion powder. Easy to prepare which was a big plus for me. Would definitely make again. Delicious!

This is great!  I used low fat mayo, I don't believe it made any difference.  I omitted lemon juice and celery salt as a personal preference.  And I added garlic because I add it to everything.  The timing was perfect.  Thanks so much!

OMG this dish is AWESOME!!!!  I have a three-year-old and a six-year-old son and they both gave it 5 stars!!  I kind of took some liberties with the recipe.  I sprinkled a "meat tenderiser" on first and broiled for long enough to dig out the rest of the ingredients.  I combined the recommended amount of parmesan with a Tbs of store bought minced garlic and some basil and Italian spices and the mayo (which was fat free), and Promise fat free spread intead of butter. This mixture would be amazing on any fish but is especially delicious on the delicately flavored tilapia.  PLEASE TRY!

I can’t say enough about this recipe.  My 5 year old daughter loved it, I had all of the ingredients already in stock, and it took less than 30 min. to prepare and cook.  You can’t beat that.  
This one will definitely go into my rotation.

This was great! The whole family loved it. I did add about 1/4 cup of bread crumbs as suggested in another review and it was good. I also cut the lemon juice in half as I am not a big fan of lemon flavor anything and it was just right.

My husband calls this "chicken fish" because to him, it tastes like chicken, so if you have a non-fish eater in the house, this might be a good way to introduce something new as it is not very "fishy" tasting

My hubby and I thought it was GREAT, but for the kids ages 7,5,& 2 I had to take off some of the topping and then they loved it, so then it wasnt so strong for them, my sauce was a bit lemony and alot of Parm. cheese for them, but like I said Mom and Dad LOVED it. I use to always make fish the same old boring way with some onion slices and lemon slices and black pepper and broil it, boy! not anymore. THANK YOU

I made this a few weeks ago with chicken (as mentioned in the reviews) and everybody in my family gobbled it up. I believe my husband said that he has never had so much flavour in his mouth. Awesome!

This recipe is delicious though I made a few changes.  I used low fat butter and low fat mayo.  I added minced garlic, cayenne pepper and paprika to the butter mixture.  I served the fish with tomato bruschetta as a topping.

I am giving this 4 stars.  My boyfriend gave it 5 stars as he loves fish.  I like fish but I don't like it like this so I would give it 3 stars. I guess I prefer fish with more of a breading on it and I will try it next time with bread crumbs.

This was pretty good and very healthy – seemed like maybe it was missing something?  I didn’t have celery salt so maybe that was it.  I will try it again and in addition to including celery salt I will season with Old Bay before putting under the broiler and will add a little garlic salt or powder to the topping.  I served with Zucchini Saute from this site and boxed parmesan couscous.

well as the other reviews have showed, is a great recipe. I have never had tilapia before but it was really good and simple to make, I didnt have onion powder but used garlic powder. was still good. And there is litlle prep work for this and you can have a whole meal done in no time at all. Will for sure make this again. And some have said this is fishy, if so you bought bad fish. very mild white fish

I enjoyed this recipe very much - I'm not much of a "fish person", but my husband, who loves fish, has been urging me to try more. We decided to try this one based on the rates and reviews - we were not disappointed!

This was fabulous.  My fiancee loves fish, and I hate it, but even I adored this recipe.  Didn't have any mayonaise so I used Miracle Whip.  The sauce would also be great on chicken.

This recipe was perfect! It was SO easy and fast! The fish was incredibly flavorful with a nice light crunch on top. I served this with rice and steamed broccoli. I also added some chopped fresh chives and crushed red pepper to the parmesean mixture which gave it a little more color and a kick! I will definitly be making this again.

I have made this several times already.  One thing that I did differently was instead of using onion powder I grated about 1-2 TBS of white onion into the topping mixture.  It tasted great!

Cut the recipe down since there were only two of us! Restaurant quality taste! Will make again and may try on other fish as well.  Might try on Salmon.

Yum Yum!! My hubby & I loved it! Tons of flavor, which we like, becuase we dont like to taste the fishy taste of fish.  I also added a little bread crumbs, red pepper flakes, minced garlic, and more parmesan.  It was delish! Also, if your broiler has 2 settings..USE LOW.  This worked fine.

This is a delicious way to broil tilapia! My husband did add some salt though, probably because I didn't have the celery salt, and didn't think to add other salt. I didn't change the recipe in any other way. I served it on a bed of fresh, green spinach with some lemon wedges surrounding the platter and it was not only healthy but it looked good too. Thank you for a super recipe.

We made this and didn't subsitute anything and it was great. We love seafood and fish but Tilapia was one fish I would cook and would never taste right. However this made me love tilapia. Great recipe.

Good recipe - very flavorful.  I think next time I may substitute dill for the basil.  Basil is kind of an unusual spice with fish.  But overall, very good.  Also, I added some fresh diced Roma tomatoes for color, texture and a hint of flavor.  Additional additions and substitutions: lowfat mayo for regular, added just a pinch of dill, substituted seasoning salt for celery salt, added a bit more garlic powder.  (As I said before though, I think I'll leave the basil out altogether and use the dill.)  I served this with corn on the cob, garlic butter bread and fresh green beans.

This is one of the most delicious ways I've ever had tilapia!  We subsitute plain yogurt for the mayo (I dont like mayo) and I grate my own parmesan cheese which makes it soooooo good!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This recipe is a hit at my house!  We are always looking for ways to make fish popular in our home...my husband does not like fish.  Well today we had it for the second time, my 11 year old son made the meal this time, and my non-fish eating hubby gave the meal a 10!  We left out the onion powder and lemon juice this time, and I couldn't tell it by the reviews!  We are going to be enjoying this often!

1/3/12 yum, need to make sure gets a bit crispy.

Wow!  This was awesome.  We added some bread crumbs to the topping, as was suggested, and seasoned the fish as it was broiling.  Used some Rosemary Garlic seasoning.  Wow!

Delicious! This was very good, I just had a little trouble with the Parmesan mixture since I added a bit more of all the ingrediants, and therefore it slid off the fish.  Still, I will definitly make it again cause it had great, mild flavor!

This was good but it didn't "WOW" me. I added some red pepper flakes which helped spice it up a little bit.  I also tried it on Mahi Mahi as well as the tilapia and I think I actually preferred it on the mahi mahi.  Thanks for the recipe.

I have been using this recipe for quite some time but was too busy eating to rate it before!  It is awesome!  The only change I made is to sprinkle the fish w/lemon pepper prior to broiling.  I get tons of compliments on this dish & have never had anyone not like it.

Simply delicious.  Made this for my sister-in-law who swears she cannot stand fish...ANY KIND...but she was willing to give it the ol' college try to see if her tastes had changed.  She loved it so much she went back for 2nds.  This is the 3rd time I have made this, and it turns out great every time.
Thanks for a great recipe.

This is wonderful especially for people who don't LOVE fish...I only eat very mild fish and loved this dish!  My kids and husband (who does love fish) loved it too, even my very picky 3 year old!

I made this fish for dinner tonight and followed the recipe exactly and in the end, we thought it was just ok.  The plus side is that it was a very quick dish to throw together with a very quick cook time.  The minus is that the parmesan "spread" overpowers the flavour of the fish.  The bottom line for us is that if you like the flavour of fish, try a little less topping.

Absolutely delicious .. I had never tried Tilapia before, and have already made this recipe twice in the last three weeks.  I didn't have onion powder or celery salt, so I used celery seed, fresh minced onion and a little salt.

Made this tonight and everyone loved it, even my recently picky 5 year old son. My one year old daughter gobbled it up and my husband kept going on and on about how delicious. I didn't have onion salt or celery salt so I left them out. Added just a little garlic powder in and only a little salt on the fish itself. I didn't measure the parmesan just kept grating until it seemed right...always put more in for my cheesy husband :-)
So quick and easy too! I just love this site!!

YES, IT WAS THAT GOOD! I WILL MAKE THIS OVER & OVER AGAIN... I DID IT LAST NIGHT WITH GROUPER, BUT I THINK IT WOULD WORK OUT GREAT WITH ANY TYPE OF WHITE FISH. IT WAS EASY, IT WAS QUICK AND IT WAS ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!! A RESTAURANT QUALITY RECIPE... THANKS SO MUCH FOR SUBMITTING THIS ONE!

This was the best fish I ever had!!!  My daughter who is 7, said it was the best fish she had in her whole life..(heehee).  My husband said he was blown away, he couldnt believe how good it was.  I would have gave this 10 stars if I could.  I also wrapped in tin foil and put it on the grill for about 10 min. Put it on top of shrimp and linguini!!!

I used Smart Balance for the butter and less mayo.  Plus I substitued Cavender's Greek seasoning for the salts.  This was EXCELLENT!  A definite keeper.

Very Good!  Very easy and delicious.  I served it over Wild Rice.  Beautiful presentation!  I only had one pound of Tilapia and so I cut the recipe in half and it still made 4 very nice sized servings.  Like others have said, even those that aren't fond of fish will probably like this recipe.  I have been sharing it.  Will make this often because of the easy, flavor and presentation.  Simply elegant!

The first time I made this, I didn't understand what all the fuss was about this recipe, but I made a few changes this time.  Now, I understand.  I recommend seasoning the fish a little even if it's just salt and pepper.  Also, I used fresh grated parmesan cheese & fresh basil instead of the dried.  It turned out fabulous!!

This is outstanding!  I am not a big fish eater,so I really tried this for my husband.  This is not a fishy fish:)Recipe is perfect , but as always I like to personalize it a little. I used fresh basil and sprinkled Cavender's Greek Seasoning lightly on the fish. I believe next time I will use a little less margarine to lighten it a tad. This is a super fast meal and we sauteed Bird's Eye Squash and Zucchini mix to accompany the fish. Thank you for an incredible posting!!  My husband thanks you too!

Quite Tasty!  I HATE fish but bought some tilapia because I know it's good for you.  This recipe was just what I needed!  I cut the recipe to 2 servings and used most of the sauce on one tilapia filet.  I used canned parmesan (sprinkle cheese) and bottled lemon juice because that's what I had on hand.  I also subbed garlic powder for the celery salt because I don't like celery and it didn't need any additional salt.  I served it with couscous and a green salad.  Thanks for helping me eat quick and healthy!

EDIT: 01/28/2009:  This is one of my most frequently used recipes from this site.  I have done all kinds of variations on this recipe.  Our fave so far was to add a dash or two of cayenne for kick.  Thanks again for a great recipe!

Delicious! Very quick and easy to make too. I halved the recipe and skipped the celery salt.

This is just plain yummy! My secret is to grate my own cheese from a block of parmesan rather than use that sawdust stuff in the green can or preshedded cheese.  I also use reduced fat mayo to make it a little more figure friendly.
My whole family loves this!

YUM!!  Quick and easy and delicious!  What more could a working mom ask for?!?  It's not 'fishy' so anyone will like this.  I subbed garlic powder for the celery salt (personal preference) and this was 'rock my socks' good!  Thanks!! UPDATE!  6/4/07  I used some old bay seasoning on the filets before I broiled them.  I also added some (a little dash) cayenne pepper and about 1/8 cup of panko bread crumbs.  Next time, I'm going to cut the lemon juice a little and add about 1/4 cup panko - oh yeah, I added a little paprika for color.  This is a recipe I'd serve to my mom- certified fish hater (except for classic fish n chips) and think she'd like.  Thanks for a classic!!

Oh my goodness !!  This recipe sure lives up to its rating.  I have been wanting to try this for a long time and my only regret is I didn't try it sooner.  I sprinkled the fish with little bit of Old Bay before putting on the spread (as another person suggested).  I served it with herb/butter rice and steamed broccoli.  It is delicious!!

good topping, not outstanding.  Would be better on top of mahi mahi, so the fishy taste wouldn't take away from the topping.

This is a really, really good recipe. I was a little nervous to try because I thought it may be a little strong for tilapia. I am so glad I listened to the reviews and tried it anyway! It was delicious! I added garlic powder,cajun seasoning and low fat everything. It was a little soggy in one or two places. I may use less mayo next time. So good!
Thank you!

This is my new favorite recipe for fish! :)  So quick, easy, and delicious.  Even my picky 4-year-old likes it.  At first I was a little skeptical about having mayo in the sauce mixture; but after broiling it, the resulting sauce is VERY good.  This goes well with baked asparagus (asparagus seasoned with butter/olive oil, salt & pepper, then baked at 400 F oven for about 15 minutes).  Yummy! :)

Absolutely fantastic.  This dish rivals what you'd get at any high end seafood restaurant.  I used garlic powder and a dash of cajun seasoning in place of celery salt, but that was the only change I made.

Tilapia is a great lightly textured & flavored fish. This recipe was great as is. Also tried w/butter sub & added a bit of Old Bay seasoning for some extra flavor. Really good!

Okay... this is soo unexplainably delicious.  So simple, so tasty... it honestly left me speechless.  I was kind of skeptical (mayo??), and was even a bit worried when I mixed the toppings, because it looked quite dodgy...  It came out of the oven smelling delicious, and the crispy edges... sooo good.  This is the kind of dish that makes you want to have people over, just so you can show them what a chef you are.

I'm not a lover of fish but trying to add more to our family's diet.  This was really delicious.  I made this with all low/no fat substitutions - FF parmesan, only 1 Tbsp of Light butter with canola, and reduced  fat mayo.  I never tried it the full fat way but this was really good.  I made the topping in the morning and kept it in the fridge.  I would make this for company.

Tried this for the first time tonight for a quick dinner after exercising.  Liked the light flavor, however instead of mayonnaise (b/c I don't like it) I used miracle whip, which caused a little more sweetness, so next time I may add a pinch or two of salt to deter that sweeter taste.  Still good, layed it all out on some sauteed spinach and the presentation looked wonderful.  Good eats!

This recipe is such a hit with the family I cook for - they request that I make it at least once a week. (Even the fussy 9-year-old likes it!) I usually double the amount of the parmesan/spice mixture to make sure all the talapia gets covered.

Delicious recipe! Very easy to make, although it required a bit of attentive monitoring/timing. The fish came out very tender and juicy and the parmesan (I used the shredded kind) added texture to the fish. I served it with roasted herbed potatoes and it made for a very satisfying meal.

This is truly a great tasting recipe that doesn't take long to cook. If you love or if you like fish you will not be disappointed. Also easy to prepare and cook. I've made it several times. My wife often ask me when am I going to cook it again.

WOW!!  This recipe really is wonderful and easy to prepare.  Please try this one...you won't be disappointed.  I didn't have celery salt on hand, so I omitted that ingredient...still yummy!  Even my 2-year-old gobbled this dish right up!  Will definitely add to my recipe rotation!

Absolutely fantastic!  Super easy to make, very tasty!  I used low fat versions of the butter, mayo, and parmesean - no problems with the substitution.  I made it with wheat pasta with olive oil, a touch of butter and the same spices as the topping of the tilapia.  I have to make additional portions of it because my kids and husband eat 2-3 filets a piece!

After I made this for dinner, my 5 year old daughter said "Mom, when are you going to make the yummy fish again?"  That alone says alot.  This recipe was excellent and I wouldn't change a thing.  I made the sauce several weeks ahead and froze it in a ziploc placed in another freezer bag with the fish.  Prep was very easy on a weeknight after work with very little clean-up since everything was prepared ahead of schedule.

WOW!  Quick and good!  Even for the child that claims she doesn't like fish.  I did substitute garlic powder instead of the onion power and omitted the celary salt (didn't have any). No leftovers remained after this meal for our family of four.

Hubby made me promise to make this again.  I have made baked parmesan chicken.  20 minutes before chicken is ready you spread it with a mayo and parm mixture.  The seasonings in this recipe make it even tastier.  I will use this topping on my baked chicken as well as tilapia.  Thanks for the great recipe.

First of all my whole family HATES baked fish of any kind.  We are southern bred and fry all fish.  I saw this recipe and all the rave reviews and since tilapia was on sale, I decided to give it a try.  Boy, am I ever glad I did.  Everyone loved this dish.  The only thing I would do differently would be to make more of the topping.  Absolutely fantastic recipe!

Awesome!  Similar to another reviewer, I minced 1 clove garlic, a little green onion and fresh basil  (in my garlic crusher)and added to the lemon juice, before adding the other ingredients.  This definately added a rich, gourmet complexity to the dish.  Easy to make and fabulous.  Thanks

Delicious and sooooooo easy!!! It took only moments and was very flavorful.  I poured the extra sauce on the plate for dipping and I also sauteed some shrimp in it.  Very yummy!  Thank you for another way to cook up tilapia filets!

This is delicious!  Changes:  baked for a bit in 400F oven, then added topping and broiled until golden and bubbly.  Added garlic salt and lemon zest.  Hubby didn't even ask for tartar sauce (a first!!!)***Made again last nite--frozen fillets on foil-lined cookie sheet, seasoned with lemon-pepper seasoning, then spread with topping, baked 20min, broiled until golden.  Family raved--said it tasted like an expensive seafood restaurant dish!!!!

What's left to say?  My family requests it once a week.  Like others, I substituted garlic power for the celery salt and used fresh basil.  I increase the topping ingredients by 1/2 and mix it with hot rotini; serve with a salad and garlic bread.  So easy, and impressive enough for company.  Thanks, Phoebe!

This was an incredibly easy meal to prepare and it had outstanding results--I am not normally a seafood eater and I even enjoyed this mild fish--the only change I made was to use lite mayo--otherwise followed it to a "T" will be making this again--Thanks!

This recipe is wonderful! My husband's unit brought us groceries after we had our baby and someone gave us a bag of frozen tilapia filets. I had never even heard of it before so logged on to the allrecipes website and found this recipe. It was SO easy to make and took us about 10 minutes to have a great dinner on the table. We don't really like fish but we will be eating a lot more of it now with this recipe. Thanks for submitting it!

this is so flavorful and delicious.  I used cod instead of tilapia and garlic instead of onion powder, a little extra fresh ground black pepper, and no celery salt.  I can't believe how good this is and so low in carbs.

OMG!  This is the BEST recipe I've gotten from this site, and I've found tons of good ones here! I didn't have onion powder, so I used garlic powder and I substituted romano cheese instead of parmesan.  It turned out like something I would have gotten in a nice restaurant.  I will SO make this again!

This was really good.  I loved the sauce.  I think maybe I'm just not a huge Tilapia fan.
I double the sauce based on a few other reviews but found that I really didn't need too.  Now I have lots leftover.  Thanks for the recipe!

Wow!  I don't need to say much more.  This is a superb recipe.  Since I was only making the tilapia for two of us, I cut the recipe back a bit; boy did I wish I had more topping!  Way to go Phoebe!  Thanks.

IF YOU HATE MAYO: I substituted a little more butter and some olive oil in place of the mayo because I can't stand the taste of it. This waa terrific!!! I sprinkled some cajun seasonings on top for some color and a little kick. This will be a fish mainstay in my house!!

This recipe is tasty and the fish stays very moist. However, it completely overpowers the delicate flavor of the tilapia. My son really likes this one so it's going into my recipe box.

I will be a sophomore in college this year and thus spent all summer learning to cook.  This recipe was easy and delicious.  My entire family had only compliments for this dish, which is something since my dad is a commercial fisherman and we can be quite picky about fish recipes.  I subbed celery flakes for the celery salt, since we didn't have any.  Cooking required a few more minutes longer also.  My mom asked for the recipe- the ultimate compliment.  Try this.

Excellent!  Fresh and smooth flavor.  I needed to extend the broil time (after adding topping) an additional 3 minutes to get fillets "flakey".  Total was about 6 minutes (after topping is added).  I will definitely make this one often.  Thanks Phoebe!

So, so, so good.  I recommend using about half butter and half olive oil for a slightly healthier version.

I am not much of a fish eater and I really enjoyed this recipe.  I did change it some.  I cut the butter and mayonnaise in half to help cut some calories and I replaced the celery salt with garlic powder.  Our family loved it and for once we didn't have left overs.

Very easy and tasty!  I melted the butter as someone else had suggested.  I was surprised that so many recent reviews said they had leftover sauce because I did not.  In fact, next time I'll probably double the sauce to have enough for the rice and vegetable sides I made.

The fish came out nice and tender but it's way too cheesy for my and my husband's taste.  We prefer just a little lemon and pepper so you can taste the flavor of the fish.  
Probably won't make it again.

I am definitely not a big fan of fish, but this recipe has made eating fish enjoyable.  My husband, who does like fish, said this was the best fish he ever had.  The parmesan coating gave the fish lots of good flavor although I will probably use less butter and mayo next time to make it a little more healthy (we also ended up not using all of the parmesan coating).  This was the first time that we ever used our broiler, and besides setting off the fire alarm in our kitchen (we like things well done), I am planning on cooking with this recipe again.

This was a tasty and quick way to cook this fish! It was my first tilapia cooking experience, and I will be doing it again. The flavors didn't quite penetrate all the way into the flesh, but the speed of the recipe made up for that! Next time I might salt and pepper the whole fillet before cooking, or brush with butter and lemon juice.

This was delicious!!  Very quick, easy and all of the ingredients (except the fish!) were readily on hand. (I love when I don't have to shop for special ingredients!)   It was the first time I cooked Tilapia (I used fresh), and my husband says this is now is most favorite fish dish, and he especially loved the flavor of the sauce.  I, too, used garlic salt instead of celery salt, as I thought I'd like the flavor better.  And, since I usually don't take the time to measure quantities, I suspect I used a little more of the spices than called for.  I did not have any lemons on hand for "fresh" lemon juice, so I used reconstituted lemon juice.  Also, I spread 1 tablespoon of the 3 tablespoons of mayo called for on top of the fish before putting it under the broiler, and then just mixed the remaining 2 TBLSP in with the cheese mixture.  The fish was sooooo moist and yummy.

Absolutely fantastic!  Like another reviewer we tried this because we had some tilapia and all the ingredients necessary.  This may be the best fish I've ever tasted.  The parmesan "sauce" was much thinker than I would have expected and a little difficult to spread on the fish but the end result was outstanding.  I will be making this again and again.

Can I rate this 10 stars? I don't like fish, but I love this recipe! I used walleye and some perch. I also doubled the sauce (I always do to any recipe) and served over rice. Yum, yum, yum. I'm so glad I found this. I finally can cook our Minnesotan fish and like it! **********

I have made a lot of Talapia recipes, but this one was the best so far!  I used only 1 tsp. of the butter and fat free mayo.  It was really healthy and very delicious.  We will make this again.

I knew this was going to be good, but who knew it was going to GREAT!  One of the best tasting fish recipes I've come across - really tastes like you're eating at a fancy restaurant.  YUM!!  Will definitely be making over and over.

Whoever said this was restaurant quality was wrong!  This is better than any restaurant could ever make - use fresh parmesan and fresh basil and this is even better :)

My 6 year old inhaled this fish.  I didn't make nearly enough.  My grandmother was soooo impressed with the gourmet meal I made.  This is insanely easy as another review said.  I'll be serving this to my Dad and his wife for their birthday dinner.  Thank you so much!!

I used a low-fat imitation butter spread and Miracle Whip and all other listed ingredients. The tilapia was delicious - very rich but not overwhelming. Be sure to watch the broiler as you cook - the time goes by very quickly and you don't want to overcook the fish.

I'm not a particularly big fish fan, but my husband has asked me to put more fish in our diet so I tried this recipe. It was very good. Not "fishy" at all. Even our 3 1/2 year old son enjoyed it. I will definitely make it again and would serve it to guests.

This is absolutely delicious!!! I also did not have celery salt and don't too much like the taste of celery, I did add parsley, lemon pepper and garlic powder and it was excellent!! It was fast (about 10 mins total) and very simple to make...will definately make again.

SO GOOD! Money saver tip: Substitute dill for celery salt since you can use dill in so many more things; use grated parmesan cheese- it doesn't separate when melting.

wow.  I can't believe something that easy tastes so good.  Will definately do again.  I didn't feel like cooking dinner tonight, so I was looking for something quick, and this was.  Usually quick doesn't taste so good, but this was superb.

I didn't have a broiler pan, so made it on a baking sheet with a silpat.  Maybe needed an extra minute under my broiler.  Super fast and easy.  Nice change of base from my usual fish recipes.

This is tasty and my husband approved!  I deleted the celery salt, cut butter in half and my helper child went a little overboard with adding the pepper,using a course setting on the grinder.  I broiled on low and it took more than 2 min per side but still super fast.  All else was just as the recipe states.  I love this for our weeknight rotation and am looking forward to experimenting with additional spices.

This is an excellent recipe for the Costco fresh tilapia!  Followed other's suggestions and decreased butter to 1 tbsp. Sprinkled Old Bay before the first broil. Added granulated garlic and paprika to the cheese mix. Fish was so tender and tasted fresh-caught. This is absolutely a keeper! Thank you!

I liked this recipe a lot! Although, 2 pounds of tilapia is a lot. I just used four tilapia and it was perfect for me and my spouse. The sauce is so yummy! But if you use the sauce from the recipe and only 4 little tilapia slices....you end up with extra sauce. Lol

Family loved it! I added paprika and a lot of garlic and I also sprinkled blackened seasoning on fish before I put in oven and before topping and I added French’s fried onions on top with a sprinkle of breadcrumb for crunch- even my kids loved it- served with rice and French cut green beans

Super yummy! I was out of tilapia, so I just did it with chicken. My uber picky children loved it. Every body had seconds.

I used Fat Free Mayo, only 2 T. Butter.  I added 1/8 t. Paprika, 1/8 t. Garlic Powder, 1/8 t. Celery Seed instead of Celery Salt and 1/4 C Bread Crumbs. I also sprinkled Tilapia Loins with Old Bay seasoning before broiling as others have suggested.  Fish was very moist and delicious.  Will definitely make this again.

My wife and I both really enjoyed this, as it brings some unique (good) flavor combinations to our table.  It's also a pretty quick meal when nothing has been taken out and doesn't require much prep time with frozen tilapia fillets thawed in a water bath.

We love this way of preparing tilapia! It's moist and flavorful with a nice top crust.  I use lemon grass instead of basil but that's the only change.

Thought this was delicious. I made it as the recipe states except that I did add 1/2 cup of italian bread crumbs for a little crispier texture. Even my picky eater gave it a thumbs up. Will definitely be making this throughout the summer when we eat a lot more fish.

Delicious as is but I made a few changes. I cut the recipe in half for 3 fillets. It made enough to coat both front and back of the fish. I added a 1/4 cup seasoned bread crumbs, 1 1/2 tablespoon mascarpone cheese (because I had it in the fridge) basil pesto for the dried basil (also because I had it in the fridge) 1/4 tsp smoked paprika, 1/8 tsp garlic powder, a pinch of red pepper flakes, 1/8 tsp salt, 1/8 tsp celery seed, a light sprinkle of poultry seasoning and a light squeeze of fresh lemon juice! I seasoned the tilapia with seasoned salt and freshly ground pepper and a light squeeze of fresh lemon juice over the fillets. Followed the rest of the recipe on broiling it and that's it! It was DELICIOUS!! My family raved! Both my husband and mother in law's first expressing was, "this is delicious!" and even my 3 year old gobbled this up! Served this with coconut rice and Parmesean broccoli.

I grew up never eating fish, ever. We ate a lot of take in my house growing up. As I've gotten older I've really tried to bring some new things into my home for my family, so my kids won't have the same eating problems I do. This was my very first fish dish. I was nervous and I'd never ever worked with fish or even thought I could cook it. This came out so great everyone cleaned their plates! No leftovers which means mission accomplished mom! The only thing I would say is handle the fish with care because it falls apart pretty easy, I'm sure everyone else already knows that though.  The flavor on it was kind of tangy and cheesy which everyone really loved. Thanks so much for this great recipe I'm adding it to my dinner arsenal. It was super easy for me, a beginner, to make and the end result made me feel really good. Thanks again!

Wonderful as is.  I really hate when people completely change the recipe in their review.  Just post your own recipe. I understand a minor tweak here or there based on what is in your pantry or your preference. But when you change every ingredient, it becomes another recipe.

This is a good tilapia recipe and I would make it again. I probably added more lemon than called for (juice of 2 small lemons) and I added Old Bay Seasoning. This is very quick and easy and I served it with fresh broccoli. In fact, the fish cooked quicker than the broccoli did!

This is a wonderful recipe!!  My husband and I have a hard time getting around to preparing fish on a routine basis, but after trying and enjoying this dish, we are going to have it as often as we can!!  It was so super easy (one of my requirements) and we absolutely loved the taste and texture, as well as the beautiful presentation, of this broiled tilapia parmesan.

I made this for the first time tonight for hubby and company. HUGE hit! I was asked for the recipe. The only change I made to the recipe was coating the fish in Old Bay before putting them in the broiler oven. I even had the notes written down to add bread crumbs/crackers and to reduce the butter, but I forgot to do either one and it was still fantastic! Thank you for making me look awesome.

This is a recipe I've made quite a few times but never gave a review. I made this today but didn't have any lemon juice. It still turned out great, everyone loved it including my kid nephew who asked for seconds. This is definitely a keeper.

This was a big hit at family dinner! I followed a couple of the other reviews and did cook the fish with old bay then added the mix at the end and coated the fish with a small amount of oil. Fish had great flavor!

I loved this recipe,  it's quick and easy and tastes amazing. I added onion powder and I put the mixture on both sides.
I kept everything else the same. I'll definitely be making this again.

My boyfriend and I really enjoyed this. It was my first time broiling fish and first time cooking tilapia - and I will definitely be making this again! I rarely am satisfied with something the first time cooking it, and this was perfect as is. I followed the recipe exactly except added a little paprika as others suggested. I was making it for 2 so I cut the cheese mixture in half which made enough to smother two large fillets. I broiled on the highest rack in my oven - 2 minutes, flipped, 2 minutes, removed to add topping and cooked 3.5 more minutes. The top was a nice golden brown color when finished.

Served with Mushroom Orzo (on this site) and pan-fried okra (just cook with olive oil and season liberally with Tony Chachere's for about 15 minutes on medium-high heat).

Wouldn't change a thing, except to make more of the topping next time because it didn't cover all of the fish fillets completely. Tangy enough for the adults, and mild enough for the kids. Easy and will definitely make this again

I used this recipe on swai fish. I left out the celery salt and used some seasoning salt instead. I marinated it with the seasonings for about 1/2 hour and then baked at 450 for about 20-25 minutes. It came out delicious. Will definitely do this again.

This is quick and easy.  Served the fish with white rice and veggies. Although I was skeptical that the Tilapia would work well with the parmesan cheese - it was very flavorful; my husband really enjoyed it.

This is really deliciously and can be easily made much lower in calories with low fat mayonnaise. (I like Best Foods version).   I also agree with the other reviewers that some Old Bay seasoning or your favorite seasoning is a must.   Somewhat bland without it.   I didn't bother with flipping the fillets at all.   Just pulled them a little further away from the broiler burner and let this cook for 5-6 minutes on one side before adding the mayo/butter/cheese mix.   Overall, this recipe is fast, it's easy, it can be low cal -- I LOVE IT!

I really enjoyed this recipe. So easy and quick and tastes great.  I like the suggestion of adding bread crumbs to hold the cheese in place and seasoning fish with Old Bay.

This was a fantastic recipe!  I wasn't quite sure how to spread the cheese mixture on top so I just melted it a little more and sprinkled panko bread crumbs on top.  Fish was perfect after 6min total!

I love this easy recipe and make it several times a month.  My changes are replacing the butter with 2 T of olive oil and topping the parm/mayo mixture with 1/2 C panko on the final broil which gives the fish a nice crunch.  Yum!

Love this recipe - have made it several times and family loves it.  I like to let the sauce brown on top of the fish for a nice finish and a little crunch - doesn't overcook the fish at all.

This has been in my recipe box for more than a year. We have made it many times with tilapia and w/ chicken, it is one of my family's favorite dishes. Enjoy

Left the cast iron pan in while preheating broiler on LOW, worked great! 2 mins on first side; 3 on the other with topping. I didn't have mayo, onion powder or celery salt, so sub'd Parmesan & Peppercorn salad dressing instead. Worked deliciously. Sorry, no photo - devoured right out of the pan.

Fantastic! I cut the mayo and instead of butter I used a small amount of olive oil. Instead of using celery salt, i shredded real celery, got rid of the stringy stuff, and used the rest in this recipe. It added a great texture and enhanced the flavor. This recipe is inspiration to eat fish more often. Thank you!

So easy and so yummy! I mixed it up pretty much like the recipe said (although I never really measure spices). It came out so perfectly flaky and cheesy. Thank you for posting this recipe.

This tilapia preparation was amazing!  It was easy and quick to prepare and cook.  And the ingredients were something I usually have on hand.  The fish was tender and flavorful.  Everyone in the family wished I had made a double batch.  Definitely going to be a regular on our rotation.

I was looking for an easy recipe, and wow, this recipe exceeded my expectations! I didn't use the celery salt and used garlic versus onion powder. I also took the advice off another user and added Panko bread crumbs to keep the topping in place. A bit more parmesan cheese was used since I had more than 2lbs of fish. Used fresh basil versus dry, and it was the best tilapia my whole family ever had! So glad and happy this website exists! Thanks for a delicious meal!

My 17 year old grandson does not eat fish.  I made this for myself but saved 1 filet for him to try.  He really loved it and asked to have it again.  I did add the garlic powder and Panko bread crumbs.  Loved the crunch it gave it.  Will be having this again and again.

We didn't like this recipe at all.  It overpowered the flavor of the fish and was way too salty and mushy (husband had to scrape it off the fish).  Will not make again.  I can't believe this recipe is rated so high!

Fantastic dish! Went over very well with my girlfriend, and her parents dug the leftovers.  Fish isn't the cheapest food, but tilapia isn't the most expensive fish.  This was a relatively quick and very delicious dinner.  I served it with broiled asparagus and spinach and feta pita bakes.

I've made this recipe twice now. The only change I made was leaving out the celery salt, because I didn't have it on hand.  I added a little garlic powder instead.  I also added a 2 tablespoons of panko breadcrumbs to the mixture the 2nd time and it turned out great! Everyone loved it!

This was very good.  I had some Tilapia in freezer and was loping for something quick.  I did make the changes that Shannon suggested.  Be sure to read her review and see what you think.  Good, Different and Easy.  Three of my favorite things. Thank you Phoebe!!!

I was skeptical when I saw cheese and fish, but I was very pleasantly surprised at how amazing this tasted! I make a smaller version for one filet at a time. I added about 1/4 cup pano bread crumbs to the cheese mixture and then sprinkled some on top of the filet covered in the cheese mixture. The filet is soft so this gave it the perfect amount of crunch. Depending on your oven, you may want to stay on the short side of the 2-3 minute per side range.

Wow!!  I was not a fish lover at all but since I was diagnosed with diabetes in March I have been trying new recipes. Mostly from this site, but I have to say this was the BEST so far. Fish browned nicely with a bit of a crunch. I will be making this often!!  Thanks

This was SO easy to make! I completely followed the directions and my S/O loved it. The only change he requested I make is to double the topping next time. I liked it overall and will definitely make it again.

This was delicious. I used what I had - mayo, butter, lemon juice, Old Bay Seasoning, pepper, and I added a few tablespoons of bread crumbs (and a little water to loosen it up after that!). Broiled fish for 2 minutes, put topping on, broiled again. Hubby and I loved this. Tilapia is such a beautiful fish and this topping complemented it.

Delicious! Followed recipe exactly and it was so tasty. I'm thinking this topping would taste great on any fish or maybe even chicken breasts. I would like to try with bread crumbs next time though, so that the topping will stay better on the top.

I was kind of disappointed with this recipe. I made it as stated and thought that the Parmesan cheese was overpowering in the sauce. I also thought that the butter made it a little too greasy and the sauce separated a little bit when broiling. It wasn't bad but i definitely think it is a little overrated. I did like the idea of broiling the tilapia which I had never tried before and I thought this method of cooking the fish was pretty good.

Cut recipe in half and made it strictly in accordance with recipe.  My wife and I thought it was very bland.  If we were to make it again we might "doctor" it up some, using suggestions shown in some of the other reviews.  Billnick

I really loved this sinful version of tilapia.  I used cod because thats what I had on hand.  Also subbed the mayo with low fat extra protein greek yogurt for a healthier twist and it turned out great!  Will definitely be on the weekly rotation.

Taste and flavor are amazing.... I will certainly cook again but with a few changes that will make it less greasy... I recommend removing the butter entirely.

I don't like fish.  I loved this! Every Friday night I force myself to cook and eat fish just because it's healthy and hubby loves it.  I've been dreading Friday nights lately but no more! I made this exactly as written and it turned out brilliantly. I ate every bite and wished I had more. Unfortunately, hubby scarfed up all of it.  Easy and relatively inexpensive so adding this to regular rotation for Friday nights. Thanks for posting it.

Yummy and easy to make. I added more cheese for more flavour and toasted it a bit more for a nice yellowish color so its not as pale looking.

Satisfied 8 of the pickiest eaters, from 7 yrs old to 76 yrs young. Everyone cleaned their plates & even asked for me to make it again. Recipe is little light on the lemon juice for some so I just put a bowl on the table & folks added as they pleased. I put mixture on both sides of fish. We doubled recipe for 6 large pieces of fish, and was enough for both sides. Don't judge sauce before you taste it w/ fish, then it really comes to life.

Great mid-week family meal, although my kids only take a few bites (7 & 10 year old). Reminds me of those quick meals mom used to make way back when - healthy fish topped with the stuff that isn't good for you, but makes it tastes so much better.

I love fish & thought with all these great reviews it would be a hit but my daughter nor I could eat this at all. I followed recipe exactly & it's just gross. The only thing that may make the big difference is I didn't use fresh parmesan. Wasted fish :-/

Outstanding method for preparing tilapia!!  Even my kids loved it.  I did add 1/2 cup cracker crumbs for structure to keep the cheese on the fish.  Very, very good!!

Reduced butter to 2 tablespoons. Good flavor. Used shredded parmesan. Wish the sauce was a bit thicker to stand up to the heat, as some of it ran off the fish during broil.

First Time I followed exactly.  It was awesome!  Tonight I'll try it with a HINT of Old Bay.  But this is a killer dish.

Fantastic flavour!

I made this with Basa fish, since that is what I had on hand, and the butter, parmesan, and lemon mixture was wonderful!

I did have to pretty much double the cooking times, since my fish was still half frozen, and I think my Basa filets may be thicker than the Tilapia would have been. However, it still came out beautifully!

I have a feeling I'm going to be eating fish more often!

This was such an awesome recipe! I haven't cooked much fish, didn't really know how, but this was so easy, the directions were great. My husband who doesn't care for fish at all even liked it! I will definitely make it again and I do recommend it! Yummmm! :)

I'm not a big fish eater but this recipe is excellent.  Only change I made was garlic salt in place of celery salt.  I used olive oil mayo and a Light Olive Oil based butter to make it somewhat more healthy. I was hoping that it would taste good enough for me to eat just one.  I ended up eating three.  I have never made fish at home that I wanted to make again.  This recipe will be a regular in the rotation for me.

Love this recipe.  Makes trying to eat more fish easy (for non-fish lovers).  I cut the recipe in half for just 2 filets and it was perfect.  Will definitely make again.

I have made tilapia many ways and this is by far the best tasting recipe. Only change was I breaded the fish with italian bread crumbs and added a bit of garlic powder to the cheese mix. I use the breading so my fish doesn't stick to pan. I've tryed cooking spray but my fish still flakes too much and falla apart without the crumbs.

Made this tonight and everyone loved it! Said it tasted better than a restaurant dish. The only things I did differently was rubbed the fish with a little oil and sprinkled a little lemon pepper seasoning on the tilapia before I broiled it. Also, I omitted the lemon juice from topping since I added the lemon pepper seasoning and instead of basil, onion powder and celery salt I used salt, pepper and garlic powder in the topping.  I can't believe how quick and easy this was and it tasted so good! This will added to our regular rotation.

Very good! I agree that it may take away from the taste of the fish itself, but tilapia is pretty mild anyway. Good recipe if you aren't big on fish. We love all kinds of fish, and this recipe was a different and tasty new way to prepare it! Think this might work on other fish, maybe even shrimp or chicken...Will try it out sometime!

I am in love with this recipe. The original recipe is delicious. I would definitely recommend making it as stated at least the first time. I have made it and have done my own tweaks, but give the original recipe a shot before you go messing around. My tweaks - I don't use the whole amount of butter, just out of personal preference. I also added panko bread crumbs for a little crunch and color, again, personal preference. I also added a little salt to the mixture.

FANTASTIC!  I did add a bit of garlic, red pepper flakes and smoked paprika, but it's the butter in the topping and the broiling (I used a convection toaster oven) that really makes this, thank you for making my weekly tilapia no longer boring!

I make this recipe about twice a week, and everyone who has tried it has requested the recipe! I follow SHEILA IN TEXAS' tips to cook the bottom side up first and sprinkle it with Old Bay seasoning. I also add about 1/4 cup of Panko bread crumbs to help the mixture hold. This recipe on its own is 5 stars... Sometimes you just find little ways to make it your own when you've cooked it 100 times! :)

It was good. Too much of a lemon taste for me. Overpowered the delicate fish. But I will do it again and omit the lemon all together. Maybe just put some lemon zest on top at the same time as the cheese topping.

We love this recipe!  My four year old requests fish anytime I ask her what we should have for dinner and it's this fish recipe she wants!  I haven't modified it at all except now I just make the sauce by taste instead of really looking at the measurements.

I loved this! I used celery seed instead of salt as I had it on hand.  My mayo is light. After reading other reviews, I added 1/2 c  breadcrumbs to mixture. It stayed on nicely. The whole baking time was 6 min and was just perfect. I will be making this a lot. My husband really only tolerates fish if it is fried, but he liked this. Mikey liked it! His name really IS Mike!

It was really good - has tons of possibilities for customization.  I didn't have lemons, but used lemon pepper. Didn't have onion powder, but added garlic powder.  I do recommend seasoning the fish first though (some reviewers mention Old Bay), as the fish without the topping was kind of bland. I also only had one tilapia filet, so I added a pile of frozen shrimp next to the fish and topped that with the Parmesan topping.  It was really good too. I can imagine putting it on scallops or any seafood would work just as well.

I really liked this recipe. My family enjoyed it too. I did add bread crumbs and garlic salt to the mix. Definitely will make this again.

I gave this recipe 4 stars because I made a couple of small modifications to it. Instead of mayo I used 1/2 cup plain Fage Greek yogurt, a tbsp of butter, and the juice of one whole lemon. We don't use mayo at our house and plain Greek yogurt is MUCH healthier. I also opted for garlic salt instead of celery salt. I kept all other ingredients and amounts the same. I broil on second rack from the top for the first few minutes then after topping with the mixture I move the broiling pan to the first rack to brown the topping. Serve with a wild/brown rice mixture and some steamed veggies. This makes one healthier, delicious, and easy meal.

Finally decided to try this.  Despite living at the NJ shore I had no desire to battle our 5th NorEaster of the season and tried Aldi's  frozen Tilapia.  It did not smell fish y but I soaked it in fresh milk before broiling it.  Loved it.  Served it with roasted red skin potatoes and sauteed zucchini.  A definite repeat dinner.  Easy, tasty and inexpensive.

Average recipe, probably better on chicken breast (bone in). Proves anything with butter and Parmesan can taste good.

Whoa! I was not expecting this dish to be as delicious as it was. It was really fast and just delicious. My fish kind of fell apart as I was flipping them over, maybe next time i'll let it broil a little longer. But other that than 1 tiny problem, this is a definitely a must.

So I don't like fish.  I never have.  I don't know why, I just don't.  But I know it's really good for you so I'm trying to eat it more.  I liked this recipe.  I love Parmesan so I figured it would make the fish tolerable.  It all tasted very good!  I gave this recipe 4 stars, though, because all the mayo, butter, and cheese....it kinda defeats the purpose of eating  a healthy fish dish.  I did cut the amount of mayo and butter in an attempt to make it more healthy.

This recipe was perfect after I changed one thing. The butter is totally not needed, otherwise the sauce slides right off the tilapia. I make the sauce and store it in a jar in my fridge and spoon out what I need as I need it. The flavor is absolutely beautiful My husband and I love to serve this over a bed of rice so we can savor every last bit of sauce. You can totally get away with using a lite or olive oil mayonnaise in this because there is so much other flavor it will not be noticed.

Wonderful! Very flavorful meal served. Served with baked asparagus and the two complimented each other well. Tilapia is an inexpensive fish and this simple recipe makes it taste like much more. This recipe would really be great with any type of fish preferred. Thank you!

I just made this tonight and LOVED it!! It was so very easy (the fish was even frozen when I started and it cooked just fine)! I have 5 picky kiddos ranging from 2-11 and they all loved it too!! The only thing I did different was half the black pepper so it wasn't spicy for my little ones and omit the celery salt. I also cooked just a couple minutes longer since the fish started out frozen and not thawed. Excellent, excellent recipe! :D

I enjoyed this, but we had thinner filets and I think the coating overpowered the fish a little. I would use a little less of the topping to fish next time, but would definitely make it again. We used light mayo and a little less butter to make it healthier and it was very good.

I love fish but never buy tilapia because it basically has no flavor. I bought some for this recipe and it is delicious! The topping really makes this dish. Super easy and super fast. I used reduced fat sour cream in place of the mayonnaise and sprinkled with Old Bay seasoning prior to broiling. I'll definitely be buying tilapia from now on but the topping would be great on other white fish also.

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this recipe!  It's quick, it's easy and it tastes awesome!  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of lightly sprinkling the fillets with garlic salt on both sides but next time will only sprinkle one side or use just garlic powder.  Also, I broiled 3 minutes on each side (instead of 2 minutes) plus another 3 minutes after putting on the topping and the fish was not at all overcooked; it was tender and moist.  I served with steamed broccoli florets and Hidden Valley Ranch roasted potatoes.  When I was preparing this meal I wasn't too sure if the ranch flavor of the potatoes and the flavors from the cheese coating would go together but it did...everyone loved the entire meal!

this recipe was so good. I used haddock and broiled it a little longer then two minutes on each side but the topping is amazing. I even used light butter and light mayo and it still had a great taste

I don't usually make fish because I end up over cooking or under seasoning it but this dish was super easy to make. I am not a mayonnaise fan at all but it was more cheesy than mayo so I enjoyed it. 

Obviously you can substitute out any white flaky fish that is on sale for the tilapia.

This is a great topping for fish. My husband raved about it. I can't wait to make it again. It was so easy, and it is ingredients I usually have on hand.

Good recipe, but the amounts of ingredients need to be doubled at least to give a decent amount of topping to put on.  Also, I only use 1lb of talapia for double the ingredients, that's more than enough to feel two people, with leftovers.

Absolutely amazing and saves any frozen fish that on it's own would be unpalatable.   I pan fried this and it still tasted amazing.

For those low carbing, I have used coconut flour and would likely have been more successful if I used more oil and fried it longer.  As is though this is delicious and smells absolutely amazing.

Loved this. I added a few more seasonings (garlic powder, paprika, red pepper flakes) and seasoned the tilapia with old bay seasoning. I also added 1/2cup bread crumbs to the Parmesan cheese mixture.  Will definitely make again.

This is really good. I used Swai fish instead of Tilapia and it was excellent. I used miracle whip instead of mayo. I also added celery seed and some salt because I didn't have celery salt. I sprayed my fish with some olive oil spay on both sides before I broiled it.  I paired mine with broccoli and sweet potatoes. I will make this again.

I made this tonight for my fiance and I.  He is not a Tilapia lover, but he loved it!  I lined the broiler pan with foil and sprayed the top with olive oil spray and clean up was a cinch.  We paired this with Broccoli Cheese Rice and Mixed Vegetables.  This one is a keeper for sure!

This recipe is so good.  "It hits the spot" - as my Honey said - when I cooked this meal for my family tonight.  He asked me to make it a regular dish for our family since it's THAT good and easy to make.  Thank you for making me a good cook :-).

Loved this recipe but you have to be careful broiling.  It really does cook fast.  I used shredded parmesan vs grated and I liked that better.

Do I really need to add one more positive review to the 5000+? Yes..I do. "BEST Fish you ever made" is what my hubby said. Fish was still light and very tasty. Will make again.

This was a great recipe.  Because I live in West Palm Beach, Florida, Yellowtail Snapper is in abundance; so that is what I used.  I also made the parmesan baster for six and not four even though I was only cooking enough fish for four.  I served it atop a raspberry vinegarette salad

Amazing!! I made this for my mom and she absolutely loved it!! I did make a few changes based on what I had on hand. I used lime in place of the lemon, and cuajado cheese in place of the parmesan. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. Even with these adjustments, the recipe still turned out wonderful. Perfect with rice pilaf and sauteed fresh green beans. Thank you so much for sharing!!

Awesome. My wife made this tonight and I wanted to eat the whole plate. She omitted the celery salt, as we were out of it, but I am not sure I would have liked it as much with the celery salt.  Yum!

Cooking directions are perfect. This was so delicious. My three boys; 12, 14 and 16 loved it, and my husband too. Served with white rice and succotash (lima beans, corn and cherry tomatoes.) The tomatoes added a nice burst of flavor to the more mellow flavor of the fish. Next time I will add a bit more of the spices to the Parmesan mixture.

Incredible restaurant quality meal.  I cooked the Tilapia 4 minutes per side before finishing up the final 2 minutes per this recipe.  All else I left as is...Andi was delicious.

This is an easy recipe and REALLY good too.

The second time I made this dish I doubled the quantity and put it in a dish instead of on a pan and omitted the tilapia all together(took about 5 minutes to brown). I then mixed it with 12oz of cooked bow tie pasta. it is delicious!

The reason I did not add the fish is my girlfriend is pregnant, and the smell of fish makes her sick. next time I will add chicken to it... I can't wait to try that!

Cut this down to just two servings and sprinkled panko bread crumbs in the butter mixture for texture.  The cooking time was perfect and the fish came out perfect!  Pretty good flavor.  Might punch it up next time, but will add it to my various ways of preparing tilapia.

Taste really good. I usually skip the dried basil and add fresh parsley. Be sure not to overcook it.

Excellent!  I seasoned with Old Bay per some other reviews and it was wonderful.  Served over whole wheat pasta with wilted spinach and tomatoes.

We love this meal at my house. I make it frequently when we have guests. I make it as is but will often substitute garlic powder instead of onion powder. I like the taste better but my husband says he can't tell the difference! I never add my review to these recipes, but I thought this one was worthy of it.

Absolutely tasty!  I was afraid to use up all of the sauce on the fish because it seemed to have made quite a lot.  No worries now.  Next time I make this, & I will real soon, I will use all the sauce.  Excellent flavor!  Thank you.

The whole family loved this one. Never been a huge tilapia fan but the topping made this dish. I did add some garlic powder and next time I think some bread crumbs would be a great addition. This one we will definitely be eating again. :-)

Absolutely Delicious!!!!! Very first time trying Tilapia any other way besides baked in butter. I was apprehensive because of the Mayo, but my family loved it. I used what I had(which was grated Parm) and for the cheesy affect, topped it with shredded cheddar and Mozeralla. YUM! Will make again! Thanx Phoebe

This was so good and super easy. I did as one of the other reviewers mentioned and added about 1/3 c. bread crumbs, 1/2 tsp. paprika and 1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes. I also seasoned both sides of filets with Old Bay and I can tell that made a huge difference. I broiled the topping closer to 5 min. but the fish was still very moist. My 8 yr. old, a picky eater, also liked this and my husband and I loved it. Definitely a keeper and even company worthy.

I love this recipe!  It's easy-breezy and tastes so good!  I sometimes use sour cream instead of the mayo.  I never use butter or celery salt.  I add cooking wine, dill, and white ground pepper (rather than black).  I've made this recipe using cod as well.  Awesome tasting & easy...just how I like it!

My husband and I love this fish recipe. The only change I made, was I used Mayo w/Olive oil (low calorie) and lime juice instead of lemon. I also added Lemon Pepper.I will be making this recipe often.

This recipe is simple, fast and so delicious! Made it exactly as is and it was perfect. Cook  time was faster- so I had to watch that. Flavor was on point. Next time I think we will add some Old Bay. This will be a new family fave at our house.

I LOVED this! I didn't have onion powder or celery salt, so used garlic powder and onion salt instead. My hubby thought there was too much parmesan, but I realized later that I only used 1 pound of tilapia--oops! I'll make it again, with the correct amount of fish. Thanks for sharing!

I am always afraid of cooking fish, but this recipe was quick, easy and rich, like you ordered it in a restaurant. It is low carb and made for a very filling entree. I made a couple changes based on what I had: I used sour cream instead of mayo, cause it needed to be used up. Green onions instead of onion powder. Fresh basil instead of dried (twice as much) and chopped garlic scapes. 15 min of cook and prep time? This recipe will be used again - lots! ^_^

Delicious!  Sprinkle with panko before last broiling and omit butter.  It just separates out and makes the dish greasy.

This was amazing...the topping is SO tasty, I think it would also be great on chicken. I followed the original recipe but added a little bit of bread crumbs. I will definitely be making this again.

Awesome Recipe - It deserves 10 stars and should be in the top 20 recipes, if they didn't put it there already. My husband said he wants to shake the hand of whoever created it. He loved it and said this is the way he wants me to make tilapia from now on. I did everything exactly the way the recipe was written. I did make sure to use good parmesean from Alescis, an Italian Import Store close by, I think that makes all the difference in the taste. Thank YOU so much for sharing this recipe!!!

This was fantastic, all my kids loved it too (even the ones who don't like fish)! I used olive oil to lightly coat the fish before broiling. I also added a bit of cayenne and dill to the parmesan mixture, and topped with some panko breadcrumbs. Yummy!

This recipe should be rated 6 stars!! It's the best fish dish I've ever made and probably eaten.  It appears to be fool proof.  I didn't use lemon juice or celery salt as I didn't have any.  I combined the remaining ingredients added extra basil and bread crumbs to help bind all the items as mentioned by another reviewer.  It helped the mixture to stay on the fish.  I'm probably going to eat this once a week until I tire of it.  Delicious!!!

This was a great dish.  Both my kids and myself loved it.  My son can be a picky eater and he wolfed down two in less than 5 minutes.  Will definitely be making this again.

I made this for dinner tonight and everyone loved it including my "picky picky" kiddos!! I did add 1/4 C panko to the butter mix and it gave it a nice crunch. Will make this again :)

This is soooo delicious! I didn't have any lemon juice, so I just did without, and it was still wonderful. Also I didn't have any onion powder, so I used dried, minced onion. This is seriously an amazing recipe, and it's so quick and easy. I will definitely be making this again!

Just fabulous!  My family, including the kids, can't eat enough of this recipe.  My husband said it's the best recipe I've tried in the last 3 months.  Definitely a keeper!

I was searching for a different way (instead of pan fried in lemon butter) to serve Tilapia and this was a total success. The whole family loved it. Definite keeper! Thanks for sharing.

SOOO GOOD! Melted in my mouth. I bought 4 frozen tilapia fillets from whole foods. Worked perfectly. Be sure to keep an eye on them while broiling as they could be easily over broiled. A great example of appreciating quality over quantity!

Love this recipe. Always great, even when I changed the celery salt for garlic salt. I have used tilapia, swai and flounder with this recipe. Thanks for the recipe.

I used regular salt because I didn't have celery salt, and only made enough for one serving (I premake my lunches and dinners for the day due to my work schedule.) When it came out of the oven it looked and smelt delicious, but I didn't eat it until 8 hours later after I reheated it in the microwave from the fridge. 
It did NOT taste good when reheat. I want to try to make this again, but eat it right away next time, perhaps it will be better. I think I over cooked the fish accidently, so this warning "Be careful not to over cook the fish." from step 3, VERY IMPORTANT!

Our family had this delicious recipe last night. Very tasty and had lots of flavor; I substituted the butter with olive oil as I am not a big fan of my food dripping with butter. Added extra dashes of seasoning and other than than this was a hit in my house.

My picky eaters both loved this. They thought it lacked a little crunch so I will use bread crumbs the next time I make it as other reviewers recommended. Great, easy dish and will definitely be making again!

Easy and wonderful! The whole family loved it. I followed the directions completely and I thought it was great. I do agree with one other person who said they made it with bread crumbs and I may try that next time, but not because there was anything wrong with the original recipe.

This is honestly the best thing I could do to fish that isn't fried.  I'm not a seafood person, per se, and what seafood I do like, I like fried.  This was scrumptious!  I wanted more than my usually desired one small piece.  Further, my beau asked me to make it 2 days later and its on the menu for tonight!

I'd have to say this is a recipe for people who don't like fish and feel a need to disguise its flavor: the coating was much too strong for such a delicate fish.  I won't be making it again.

Excellent!  Absolutely moist-watering delicious.  Even my meat-eater of a husband loved it, "best cooked fish ever".  We did make one slight alteration- instead of the basil, pepper, onion powder and celery salt, I substituted 1 tsp of Old Bay.  Even my twin 26-month olds ate it!

I used Swai fish.  The only changes that I made to the recipe was I added 3/4c. Panko crumbs to the mixture.  I cooked the fish without flipping it.  I broiled mine until completely done, and then, pressed the crumb mixture onto each fish, and returned it to the broiler.  At this point, watch it very closely!  It gets brown very quickly; less than 3 mins.  Hubby and son liked it and said they would eat it again.  I think next time, I will try the tilapia or even an orange roughy.  Yummo!

I had high hopes but didn't like it too much.  I thought it would get a bit crispy in the broiler but the edges burned before the top was done.  Also, thought the lemon made it sour. Might try again but would leave out the lemon (serve with wedges) and add breadcrumbs or panko like others suggested.  I was disappointed but my kids seemed to like it a lot.

I chose this recipe because it had very little ingredients and I jump at any chance to bake over stove top cooking. It was really good. I'll keep it in my arsenal and maybe play around with it in future to cater it more to my families likes.
Update - when I tried this a second time, I realized that I had forgotten to add butter! duh, but so so good, a keeper for sure! I even used some of the remaining mix on chicken breast and it was delicious.

Love this recipe!  I use low fat mayo and put a 1/2 cup of panko bread crumbs in, which gives it great texture.  When making tilapia, this is the recipe I reach for.

This dish was excellent! I made it last night for my boyfriend and I last night and he raved over it! I did not have a broiler so I baked the fish at 450 degrees and it turned out nicely as well. Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

I teach a cooking class after school for high school students and they get to choose their recipes then make them. They choose this one and made it with a lemon parmesan rice. There were mixed reviews about the sauce ontop. Some of them loved the creamy texture and taste while others found it "bland" and having a weird taste. The teachers and principals we carted it to loved it, but they may have been biased :)

This was awful.  I had to toss the first batch because the parmesan was much too overpowering.  If you majorly alter the recipe it is pretty good, but I won't be using this again.

If you can't grill tonight, give this broiler recipe a try.  This GREAT recipe with fresh fish and a few staples is VERY EASY to prepare, flavorful and still pretty healthy.

This was excellent - my picky teen daughter even liked it.  I'm not usually a fan of mild white fish - I tend to make salmon dishes.  But this was very good - of course the topping is what made it!  I took the suggestions of others & only used 2T butter, substituted garlic salt for celery salt, and added a little mozarella and 1/4 cup panko bread crumbs to the topping.  Very good!

The sauce is excellent.  Next time double the amount of it.

My husband and I really enjoyed this!  I love how quick and easy it was to make.  
Followed it to a T except that I used cod since my husband isn't a fan of tilapia and I didn't have any celery seed.  I love the topping...will make again.  Thanks ;-)

I thought this was very good! I reduced the butter by half, and I think it could be reduced even more or omitted completely. I added some paprika, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, and dusted the tilapia lightly with a blackening seasoning before broiling. I love the versatility of this recipe. Spices can be added or changed based on what you like and what you have available. I've seen similar recipes for chicken breast... bet they're good too!

Loved this.  I'm always tryng to find ways to make fish because I'm not a big fan of the taste.  I liked how quick and easy it was to make.  And there was no strong fish taste.  I do not have a broiler pan, so I pan fried the fish in a little olive oil first instead of broiling.  My husband and two year old devoured it.

This is a simple, quick and delicious take on one of our staple fish meals. We sauté tilapia or cod at least twice a week. This is the first recipe that I've found that made me want to cook it in the oven. So good, so fast! I did sprinkle a bit of Old Bay on the fish prior to broiling, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Thanks, Phoebe, for expanding my horizons.

This fish came out really good, but I can only give it four stars because I changed it so much. I seasoned the fish with what it called for but added some garlic powder and replaced black pepper with lemon pepper. from there I broiled as it said. I added apex. 3/4 c of bread crumbs to the cheese and melted the butter before adding it to crumb mixture. I brushed the fish with the Mayo. Adding the crumb mixture on top and broiling it again to brown the topping. Entire family enjoyed it. And it was not soggy like other reviews stated it would get.

This is an excellent recipe and quick and easy for a busy night. The first time I made it I totally forgot the mayo-it was still great and even better with the mayo the second time. Big hit with the whole family.

This was really, really good. My husband loved it. So, 5 stars for taste, but 4 stars as written. I reduced the butter by half and it was still too buttery and runny. I am not even sure this needs the butter - maybe 1 tablespoon? I will make again but with little or no butter.

We really enjoyed this - loved the topping! I did read reviews and added some garlic powder, panko, and seasoned the fish with old bay before broiling. I did only use a couple tablespoons of butter and it was plenty.

This was delicious. I did not have lemon juice so i used lemon pepper as well as garlic salt because i did not have celery salt. Then i substituted onion flakes for onion powder. I had a little bit of parmesan and mozzarella. cheese so i added grated parmesan. Used the mozzarella like a few said to do as well as seasoning the fish with old bay. It was good, even with the substitutions. My dad gave me a no way and said he only eats fried fish, but then he tasted it and was silent so I knew he liked it.

I hate fish but can so do this....and I did and I'd wished I'd fixed more!  Loved it and so did the hubby and I even subbed olive oil instead of butter to get another healthy item in.  The topping is so awesome that you don'e NEED a lot, for those that are calorie counting. However, it IS SO good that you definitely WANT more....you wouldn't have to twist my arm to get me to put on EXTRA:)

This was delicious! Haven't found a Tilapia recipe that has completely made me happy yet, till this. We love cheese, so my only suggestion is to add lots of Parmesan. Otherwise, amazing meal! Super easy!

This is a wonderful recipe.  My roomate, who does not particularly like fish, kept telling me how much she liked it and said I could make this any time!  
I did not have celery salt or basil.  Instead, added two cloves of crushed garlic and a bit of garlic salt, as well as two teaspoons of dried Italian seasing. I also did not have plain parmesan so used a four cheese Italian blend.   Followed another reviewer's advice and added bread brumbs to the mixture after the original mixture started to slide from the hot fish.  This is a keeper!

Awesome recipe for you fish lovers out there! The sauce is slightly tangy, sweet, and blends well with the flavor of the tilapia. A new house favorite!

Really awesome! I have tried a couple Parm Tilapia recipes, and this was the easiest and most flavorful, by far! I left out the butter, and would make again the same. Perfect!

This was delicious! I didn't have any celery salt so I omitted it, but still very mouth watering.

Sooooo yummy. Made the recpe as specified (with addition of Old Bay on the actual fish.)
My 2.5 yr old and almost 6 year old nommed this down like they hadn't eaten all day. Oh, also? It was so easy that my 2.5 year old helped make it. 
This might be a weekly habit.

I have made this half a dozen times now and it's just as good as the first time.  I love this recipe and my picky (fish hating) husband just gobbles it down.  It's perfect for fish lovers and haters alike.

The family (husband and two kids, 11 and 13) loved it.  Some minor changes per other reviewers gave the recipe some real flavor without too much spice:  cut the lemon juice in half, added 1/4 tsp. garlic powder, 1/4 tsp. paprika, and a dash of cayenne.   Sprinkled panko crumbs on top which toasted nicely and gave a bit of crunch. Thank you!

Delicious! Super easy! May use less mayo next time, it was a little rich for DH. I added red pepper flakes, garlic powder, paprika and bread crumbs to the recipe per other reviews. I did not have any celery seed so I just left it out. Turned out great!

I and my family also loved this recipe. I left out the lemon zest and substituted old bay rub for the sazon and used miracle whip instead of mayo. I also used this mixture to recreate a Parmesan shrimp topped sirloin I ordered at a restaurant once. Yummy! thank you

Very good!!! I used the sauce on chicken breasts, but followed the cooking directions for tilapia. I'll use some panko crumbs to keep it from sliding off while broiling, but the flavor was wonderful. Thanks!

OMG! This was SOOO good!  I can't believe I made it myself.  I'm a novice and I've never used my broiler before.  I used the old bay seasoning as others suggested.  Loved it! Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious! Even my 3, 5, and 6 year old loved it. I didn't have parmesan on hand, so I used mozzerella and cheddar. I followed another reviewers suggestion and added paprika and breadcrumbs. I also used a lemon & herb spice mix instead of lemon juice. It was delicious and super-fast!

My husband and I both really enjoyed this recipe, making it exactly as stated with the exception of margarine instead of butter for the sake of cutting back some fat.  Very tasty, we'll be making this regularly!

Loved it. Just made it, and did a chef's taste. Loved how all of the flavors complemented each other. I used half EVO and half butter. I expect the family to enjoy.

This is incredible AS IS - it does not need any additional seasoning.  I fried in butter for 3 mins each side then put in the broiler for 3 mins.  I made the 4 serving version and it had just enough topping for 2 large tilapias.  Incredible taste.

This makes my family's Top 5.  I make this all the time bc it is so fast and GOOD.  you can cut back on the mayo a bit if you prefer a lighter taste & texture...it still tastes great!

Love this because I can mix the sauce and take it with the individually packaged tilapia to make at work (we have a small convection/broiler/toaster).  Great flavor, quick and easy...my favorite :)

My family and I love this recipe. The only downside is that it keeps setting off my smoke detector! Has anybody tried just baking it with any success? Maybe I should move my smoke detecter farther away from my oven!

So simple to make and ohhhh so delicious!  I used low fat or fat free ingredients and "over" measured the seasonings.  I covered the filets with the cheese mixture on the first side as it faced the heat.  When I flipped the filets,  I crushed about 4 whole wheat Ritz crackers and sprinkled on top of the cheese mixture.  Good enough for a restaurant.

There is a reason this is the number one tilapia recipe! I am usually not a huge fan of fish, but this was delicious. The dressing was light and tangy, with good parmesan flavor. Definitely will be making this again!

Our family loves this! I found that we prefer the fish seasoned with Old Bay and cooked slightly longer. I also double the topping /suace and serve with french bread.

Outstanding, Just added some panko bread crumbs for some texture and a little crunch. I was told it was the best dish I have made. We love fish and I believe this is close if not restaurant quality,

Awesome.  Best recipe I have tried off this site, and I have tried a lot.  Only customized a little to use what was in my kitchen.  Used half the butter and fresh basil.  Did not have celery salt, so used a little Adobo seasoning and celery seed.  Used pecorino romano instead of parmesan. Will use less mayo, less butter and will add a tad olive oil next time.

This was absolutely DELICIOUS!!!  My very, VERY, VERY picky 7 year old daughter told me it was so good and she felt like she was in a restaurant :-) and it looked like restaurant food.  I have to say I was impressed with the way it came out as well.  I did read a lot of the reviews an received a lot of helpful tips such as....spray the pan and the fish with vegetable cooking spray, I used EVOO in place of the butter, I didn't have celery salt so I used garlic salt, and I added bread crumbs on top of the cheese mixture. I saw a lot of ppl changed the lemon juice and used limes instead, but I actually loved the taste of the lemon juice.  This will definitely be added into my meal rotation!!  Thanks for a great recipe!!

I loved this recipe! I am a true cooking newbie and I generally don't like fish, but my boyfriend has been craving fish lately so I decided to make this dish for him (he doesn't know how much a cooking rookie I am!).  I substituted garlic powder for the celery salt since I didn't have any, and I also added 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper for a little kick.  It was super fast and easy and DELICIOUS! I ate two fillets by myself and my boyfriend told me what an awesome cook I was! Thanks for this great recipe!

Very good recipe. I didn't have the herbs, so I used dry parsley and tarragon instead, and garlic salt instead of celery salt. The lemon gave it a really nice kick and the creamy texture on top made it yummy. Thanks!

Very good, I just added a couple more seasonings as suggested by other users. The topping is very similar to something my family uses on french bread. Next time I'll make more topping & use it on the bread as a complement to the meal.

This was so easy and so tasty! I took the advice of others and sprinkled the fish with a bit of Old Bay before starting to cook it and it was wonderful! This is definitely a keeper!!!

Very good & easy to make. The only thing I would like to say is it takes more than 2 minutes to broil the fish, maybe 4-5, i just kept an eye on the fish so it won't over cook. This dish is super. I added about 1/8 tsp of salt & 2 T of Japanese Panko for an extra crunch, other than that, I followed everyhting exactly as is. It's hard not to deviate from the recipe but this one does not need it. It's a keeper

Hands down THE most delicious Parmesan topping base on the planet! We put it on EVERY protein, not just fish, and it is totally delicious! So far we've put it on steak, salmon, chicken, and of course tilapia. Sometimes we add other spices and it gets better each time! Two YUMS way up! :D

My husband loved it, and so did my 3 yr old. The hubby even said if I keep cooking things like that he wouldn't take me out to eat anymore. Added some items that I took from the reviews: added about 3 tbsp of panko flakes/japanese breadcrumbs and about a tsp of bottled minced garlic. 
Restaurant Quality, and smells heavenly while broiling the topping.

I cut the recipe down to serve 2 and it was fantastic.  Felt like I was eating at a restaurant.  Didn't use celery salt bc I didn't have any and used extra virgin olive oil instead of butter.  Going to try it on chicken tonight.  Thanks for sharing this!  Daughter loved it too!

We savored this dish that was served on hot Basmati rice covered with fresh basil and Butternut squash as a side. Luscious! I'm a bit slow in the kitchen but peeling the squash, finding ingredients, etc. probably took me an hour from scratch to the table. Yummy!

Easy and tasty. Had no celery salt, so substituted garlic salt. I wish I had sprayed the aluminum foil with oil first since some of the fish stuck to the foil.

Great recipe! This was my first attempt at fish, and it was surprisingly good.  I cooked it in a pan rather than broiled, and I changed the spices a bit, but not much.  I served with couscous, which we felt made the fish taste even creamier.  The sauce would be just as good on chicken. Definitely a keeper!

This recipe was AMAZING! We are trying to eat more fish in our household and this was definitely a keeper of a recipe! I added paprika, bread crumbs, garlic powder, red pepper flakes and Old Bay Spice to the recipe, as well as a splash of soy sauce... I will definitely be making this recipe again and I even passed it along to others! Thank you for sharing!

Absolutely fabulous! I made this recipe tonight and followed the instructions exactly it was soooo good. My family loved it! Next time I will double the recipe because there was nothing left. I cooked this with Rachel Ray's Sweet Onion Potatoes Au Gratin and trust me the two complemented each other very well. I WILL DEFINITELY BE MAKING THIS AGAIN!!!!!

This recipe is good. The fish was tasty, but did not have the crunchy coating I was hoping for. I will continue to search for that recipe, but would prepare this again, possibly cutting the amount of mayo by a tablespoon, or so, to improve the coating texture.

I'm not much of a fish eater, but this recipe was amazing! My husband HATES mayo, but he loved this. There were definitely no left overs!

I loved it and one of my kids, hubby and other child didn't like it though.  I loved the tang of the mayo and will actually add a little more next time.  LOVED how fast it cooked!

WOW!  Absolutely delicious, thank you so much for this recipe.  I made it tonight for the first time.  Will definitely make it again.  The combination of mayo, lemon and parmesan excellent base for adding favorite seasonings.  So yummy as is though!

This is by far the BEST fish I have ever made.  I followed the recipe exact, under broil in the oven (I left the door closed during cooking).  Very tasty and flaky.

We really love this recipe and have made it many times, even our friends like it. I have made a few changes and additions, instead of onion powder or celery salt, I chop up very fine onion and celery. I also changed the mayonnaise from regular to the Olive Oil mayo.

My dad doesn't normally eat fish and everyone including him raved about this dish. I love parmesan so I put some extra on but it would've been just as great with the recommended amount.

Hands down, one of my favorite recipes EVER!  I modified the recipe only slightly by adding 1/8 tsp. garlic powder and 1/8 tsp. paprika.  Also, I cook the fish in 3-minute intervals, for a total of 9 minutes cooking time.

What I love about this recipe is the very short prep time (no chopping of anything) and the rapid cook time.  Best of all, I am love with the incredible flavor!  In my opinion, it is a restaurant-quality flavor.  Absolutely delicious!  Never any leftovers with this dish!  Enjoy!

Great Recipe.  Love the cheesy flavor. I'll cut back on the butter in next recipe. Used only a little over 1lb tilapia. This should work with chicken.  Served with stir fry veggies.

Made this tonight, everyone loved it!  I read the reviews and made a few adjustments based on the recommendations.  I sprinkled the fillets with Old Bay on both sides before cooking, and also cut the amount of butter to just less than half (about two tablespoons), and it was plenty.  I didn't have a problem with the cheese mixture sliding off...there was a reviewer who mentioned that, but I left my mixture at room temperature until using it, so maybe that makes the difference.  My husband has already asked me to make it again soon, thanks for the great recipe!

I am a seafood lover.  I have been looking for recipes that can vary the taste of seafood.  This recipe is very good.  I always have tilapia on hand. It is a quick and easy recipe for any day of the week.  This dish will be part of my weekly menu.

Hubby wants some Tilapia therefore I tried out this recipe seeing the good ratings. It is indeed a very easy prepared meal and it is tasty! 

I added 3 tablespoon of crumb bread into the mix as well a teaspoon of paprika. 

Will definitely make this again and will reduce the butter to half of what the recipe calls for.

This is an AMAZING recipe! I followed some of the others advice-I added garlic powder and a little spice, and broiled on one side, then when flipping, added the mixture on top. It's even better when it is a bit browned, and tilapia cooks so fast. I don't like mayo, but wanted to follow the recipe straight the first time, but you don't taste the mayo at all. It acts as more of a "moisturizer' for the fish. I am interested trying a little cream cheese instead next time. EXCELLENT-try this!

This is a fantastic recipe with one modification: add Panko bread crumbs to the topping mixture; it gives the fish a nice crunch and beefs up the topping so it doesn't run off the fish when broiled. I made it the first time as written; husband said it had good flavor but didn't like the mouthfeel. Made it a second time with the addition of Panko and it put this one over the top. We LOVED it. I think this would be good with the addition of chopped artichoke hearts as another reviewer suggested. Next time!

This was an amazing recipe.  I did not have celery salt so I substituted garlic salt.  My family finished this dish and asked for more next time I will cook double the amount, it is that good.  You must be a Parmesan cheese fan, Big Flavor!

it was good, but I found the cheese flavor to overpower the fish. Next time I make it, I'll sub out most of the cheese with italian style breadcrumbs.

I've made this recipe twice now and my picky eater toddler seems to eat tilapia only if it is cooked this way.  A few modifications I made the second time around:  I used light ranch instead of mayonaise and thus, removed fresh lemon juice from the original recipe.  I also added 1/4 teaspoon of paprika and garlic powder.  Instead of celery salt I use soul food seasoning salt and I also add 2 teaspoons of balsamic vinegar.  It came out very tasty the second time around.

I don't know if I would have tried this had I not been desperate to find a new way to cook tilapia FAST. With all the reviews, why not. Wow, why not? Really. My picky husband and I were both pleasantly surprised and pleased with this forgiving recipe. I thought it was a lot of fat with the butter AND mayo but threw it together anyway. Tasty. Definitely recommend you try it. (Another reviewer put artichokes in it, which I think would be excellent with this sauce. Something for next time.)

For a quick and easy weeknight dish, this is simply amazing! The best fish my husband says he has ever had. Would be even more delicious with panko-breaded tilapia, as the breading would soak up the sauce nicely. Will be making this one again soon.

This was excellent.  What a way to kick up tilapia.  Perfect flavor and so QUICK under the broiler.  I made with rice pilaf and steamed zucchini.  Will make again and again.

AWESOME. Very simple, and VERY tasty. I used salmon instead of tilapia, because it's what I had, and I used finely-crushed celery flakes instead of salt (same reason), but other than that I followed the recipe to the letter and this is the first thing I've done that I thought came out "restaurant quality." THANK YOU for this recipe!!!

This was a real change to our normal way of preparing fish! As another reviewer suggested, I added some bread crumbs to the mixer to help it stay on top of the fish. I also added some Old Bay seasoning and garlic powder and omitted the celery salt. It was delicious!

Oh my....I've eaten alot of fish, alot of different ways and this was WONDERFUL.  Followed the recipe to the letter and was not disappointed.   I think the "sauce" would be good on just about any fish and if you left out the lemon juice would be a great topping for french bread.

We all liked this recipe.  I came home from work late and was pressed for time to make something.  I had this whipped up and on the table in 20 minutes.  

I would add garlic to the sauce.  Not that it wasn't tasty, I'm just a garlic nut and think garlic would have made the sauce a bit more tasty.

The Sauce seperated and the fish tasted like cleaner. When remaining sauce was scrapped off, it was a ok. I dont think I will try this again... I was really hoping for a good out come as all the reviews were good.

Very, very tasty!  I did as some have mentioned and added paprika for color, also did coat the top side of the fish with olive oil, cooked for 4 minutes and then flipped and added the cheese mixture and cooked an additional 3 minutes.  It was scrumptuous!!

Excellent fish recipe!!!  The parmesan sauce makes the recipe.  I didn't change too much, I cut the lemon juice down to 1 TBSP and added 1/4 tsp of garlic powder and paprika and a dash of Italian Dressing.

This recipe was delicious and so easy- worth passing along! I did not have mayonnaise, but instead used horseradish sauce- it was amazing! I also added a 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne to spice it up a bit.

The topping for the talipa was probably the best I have ever had! I halved the servings, and was a little short on the toping, so next time I will just make a full batch. Definitely leftovers that will get eaten!! And my husband and daughter (age 2) loved this recipe too!

We love this recipe. I made 2 small changes: Because I prefer fresh ingredients I used minced garlic instead of onion powder and I also minced some pieces of celery in my garlic press -- it works very well but you need more than the tiny bit of the celery salt the recipe calls for..

Great flavor and texture -- I made half a recipe.  I loved this recipe and would make it again as written.  My family and I  thought it tasted better fresh the first evening than as leftovers the next day, so try to finish it up when you make it, if possible.

I cooked this tonight for my family, and we all loved it! I should have scooped the topping that slid off back onto the fish when serving, but it still tasted amazing. Will definitely be making this again (probably for lunch tomorrow), and my husband suggested trying this in a sandwich... :)

I made it just as the directions suggested, but without the celery salt as I didn't have any on hand. I think next time I'll be trying it with the bread crumbs. :)

This was pretty good...I followed the recipe without changing.  The only complaint I had was that the topping tasted a little 'heavy' if that makes any sense.  I eat fish to have a light meal and with the richness of the topping...it didn't feel as if I was eating light.  I guess I should have expected that with butter and mayonnaise in the topping, but so it goes.  I think I will try and find a different tilapia recipe with a lighter flavor.

Wow, this was delicious, and the whole family agreed! We just had this for the first time tonight, and the only thing I changed was replacing onion powder with garlic powder (we are not totally fond of oniony flavors). The results were wonderful and we will be having this easy and yummy dish many times more. Thank you for the great recipe!

Recipe is great and easy as is. I only gave it four stars because Tilapia tastes like dirt? Maybe I am just not a fan of Tilapia but I have more in the freezer and am not thrilled to use it. I would use this recipe again with a different kind of fish.

I made this last night for my husband, and I was shocked at how well it turned out. Neither of us are big fans of fish, and I'd never successfully broiled anything before, but I was feeling adventurous and wanted to give it a try. The topping was creamy, flavorful, and had the right amount of tang to it, and the fish was very pleasant. My only change was halving the recipe, since I only had 1 lb of fillets.

This recipe is wonderful.  I had almost given up on Tilapia, as it was too bland.  I was seeking out something different.  We don't eat Mayo so used olive oil instead and skipped the butter.  Didn't have lemons, but had a lime. Doubled the spices, as we always do!  Everyone, even my picky 6 year old loved it.  BIG Thumbs up.

It was basically ok, but never again would I add celery salt, or any salt for that matter. Combined with the saltiness of the parmesan, it was just too overpowering. It definitely could use a little less parmesan also. Other than that, I would definitely modify it and make it again.

This recipe is absolutely delicious! I've made it just as it's called for and have changed it up a little. I prefer the original way. It's quick, easy and VERY delicious. Even my 12y/o son loves it!

Wow, this was seriously fantastic! I splashed a little extra lemon juice on the tops of the fillets just before adding the mixture so that it spread easier. It's probably the best way I've ever had fish! We made it lower sodium with unsalted butter and celery seed instead of salt. Will definitely be in our usual rotation.

Great recipe! I used olive oil instead of butter and garlic powder and regular salt instead of the onion powder and celery salt.

I love fish, and my husband doesn't eat it' so I look for recipes to make small servings.  I cut the recipe into 2 portions.  I devoured the first delicious fillet and put the other in a tupper for the next days.  Heats perfectly in the microwave.  I sprinkled with Hungarian paprika and squeezed extra lemon over them.  What YUM!

This was so easy to make and so delicious, my kids don't like fish and came back for seconds, I added extra parmesan but other than that followed it exactly.

Absolutely delicious! I did alter the  recipe a bit due to not liking actual mayonnaise, so I substituted sour cream instead and it was a hit. The baby loved it too!

This is AMAZING, as is - no changes.  Very easy, and VERY quick.  6 minutes total cooking time - who can beat that???  I love how tilapia is not very fishy, and in this recipe, it is full of flavor and very tender.  I will make this again in a heartbeat!  And very low carb is a plus (0.6g per serving!

Wow, even I loved this, and I don't like fish!  I made exactly as stated.  I had bought a bag of frozen tilapia from Costco.  Each piece of fish is individually wrapped.  I didn't thaw the fish. I put the frozen fish on the broiler pan, which I had covered with tin foil and nonstick spray. I did salt the fish a bit with kosher salt before using the parmesan mixture. It had to broil a few minutes longer because of it being frozen. The fish was flaky and mild and delicious!

Excellent recipe! I made this last night for the first time and the family loved it so much, it is getting saved for frequent use. I basically followed it, except I didn't measure out the basil, pepper and onion powder. I also didn't use celery salt, but celery seed instead. I just sprinkled the seasoning over each fillet, flipped them and sprinkled it again. I think doing it that way I used more than what the recipe called for, but it was VERY tasty and salt free, except for the mayo I suppose. The Parmesan sauce was excellent and I followed that exact. It smelled amazing when I took it out. We don't like fish, so this says a lot. Finally a fish recipe that we can all enjoy! Thanks for sharing Phoebe.

Very good!  It is a nice flavorful topping.  Tilapia is a delicate fish so this does overpower it a bit, but I sitll eat every last bite!  It would also go well on a more substantial fish.

Used Cod (what I had) in place of Tilapia, wonderful!! Even my "it's ok,but not too often" fish eating husband and pickey-eater sister  enjoyed it and remarked we should have that again! Served it with mashed potatoes and the steamed asparagus. 
Thank you for this fabulous recipe.

So easy, so pretty and so yummy. My husband said this may be his favorite way that I've ever made fish and he LOVES fish. It was perfectly cooked after 2 minutes on each side and then 1-2 minutes under the broiler.

My roommate had made this and I tried a bite & loved it. This recipe it great as is! We did not have celery salt, so we used celery seed. I served it with Rice A Roni's parmesan/romano rice with a side of steamed broccoli..yum! I will try adding garlic powder, old bay, and panko breadcrumbs next time to see how that tastes as well. My boyfriend LOVED this and ate it up 2 days in a row! Great for a light meal!

I love tilapia and I love basil and lemon. They all just go so well together. I'm not a big fan of mayonnaise so instead of using mayo I added panko bread crumbs and olive oil. I also prefer fresh basil instead of dried basil. Other than that it's a perfect combination of flavors.

This was delicious!  Very flavorful for a relatively bland fish.  Before I broiled it I seasoned the filets with a little onion and garlic powder as well as salt and pepper.  I also added a little lemon zest to the Parmesan mixture.  It turned out fantastic.

Great Recipe. Even my kids ate it! I did add 1/4 tsp of Garlic Powder, and 1/4 tsp of paprika as other reviews suggested. The only thing I will do differently is to leave it under the broiler a bit longer to brown the topping more. This is the new family favorite!

I make this all the time except instead of the basil, pepper, onion, and celery salt, I use creole seasoning.  I serve with rice & steamed broccoli.  My husband was skeptical when it comes to eating fish any other way than fried.  I finally convinced him to try, and he loved it so much that we eat it about once a week now.  lol

... What a great recipe ..... I just made this for our dinner .... more specifically, I read this to my 16 year old and had him make it as I sat in my easy chair  ..... this was started from scratch and out on the table, with side dishes, in less than 30 minutes .... great taste as is, don't change a thing ..... save this for last minute company; it tastes and looks as though you put much more effort into it than you really did ....... 4 (nothing is perfect) out of 5 stars ....

I'm not a fish eater at all, but have been trying to eat 'healthier' and I've eaten this twice in 6 days! I took some advice and used 1/2c. of bread crumbs both times..AMAZING! also the 2nd time I cut out the 2 tbs. of lemon and just gave a TINY bit because the lemon was too over-powering ...it was DELICIOUS without so much. over all GREAT RECIPE!! ( the 2nd time I also didnt have mayo. so instead used sour cream..less fattening and it tasted better!)

Have made this twice in the last couple of weeks. Needless to say, it was a big hit at my house. Really yummy. I followed the recipe as written, but it would be easy to play with if one wanted. I especially liked how quick this is to prepare.

Wow, what a great dinner I just had.  I have had mixed luck with recipes from the internet, but this is a keeper and I am going straight to Costco for another bag of frozen talapia filets. Everyone in the family loved it.  Used low fat mayo.  Wife got out some leftover crushed tomato pasta sauce which was a nice addition with the strong parmesan flavor.  Quick and easy just way I like to make dinner!

Awesome!  My whole family ate this, the 3 kids and even DH who said "I hope this is good because I don't like this kind of fish".  He even took the leftovers to work the next day!  I'm not sure what I love most, the fact that everyone ate it or that it only took me 15 minutes to make!

What a great recipe. Simple, quick but packing a ton of taste!   I prepared this exactly per the directions, the first time.  After that, I used less mayo and added more Parmesan cheese... Company worthy!

This was delicious and so easy...but only giving 4 stars because when broiled as directed, the fish was not cooked!  Maybe because the fillets were still partly frozen...anyway I turned the oven up to 400 and put them back in for 15 minutes and they were thoroughly cooked.  Next time I make this, i will bake the fillets first and then broil with the topping.  I also added some extra seasonings (paprika, garlic powder, red pepper flakes), panko bread crumbs and seasoned the fillets with Old Bay.  I loved how easy this recipe was!

This has become my new standard way of making tilapia. I use seasoned salt on top of the mayo mix. I just sprinkle it on top. I don't even worry about mixing it into the mayo mix. Also, start by placing the side you want up, face down so that after you flip, you have most presentable side showing.

Very easy to make and flavourful.   Added Italian bread crumbs to the topping, as another reviewer suggested adding bread crumbs, and put a little less Parmesan cheese.  Turned out great.  Will make again.

One of the best Tilapia recipes we've tried!  Cut recipe in half for 1lb of fish.  Followed the recipe closely but used 1TBS of butter and then olive oil, celery seed and garlic salt plus the other recommended seasonings, then added about 1/4C Panko bread crumbs which kept the sauce on the fish.  Sprayed fish with a little olive oil when I turned them over.  Delicious recipe for the regular rotation!

This was awesome!  I was delightfully surprised!  It tastes better than some of the expensive tilapia dinners I had out.  Very moist on the inside and crispy, but not overdone on the outside.  I made two revisions.  I used a mixture of tarragon and salt as I didn't have any celery salt and used only a tbs of county crock...superb.  I don't think this recipe could ever be bad.  My 5 year old loved it!

I looooo-ved this!  Flavor is wonderful and my picky hubby gave it score of 8 out of 10!  The only thing I will change next time is the amount of butter...I will try cutting in half to keep it healthier and not so oily.  Can't wait to make it again!

I love this recipe.  We make it all the time (for just me and my husband).  It is such an easy recipe, especially after you've made it once before!  You can go start to finish easily within twenty minutes!  A lot of people who even don't love fish like this because of its taste!

I've never been good at cooking fish and decided to go online and find a recipe. After I saw the amount of great reviews this recipe had I decided to try it and I had all the ingredients in my kitchen. Amazing is all I can say, my hubby scored it a Grandslam out of the park(I usually get home runs) which he does give out very often. Thank you AllRecipes for making me look like a pro!!!!!

Kids loved it. Wife hates fish and even she loved it. Only change I made was since I didn't have celery salt I used garlic powder. Turned out great!

This was pretty good for a baked/broiled fish. I used the calculate button on the recipe page and changed the recipe to 4 servings instead of 8, because there was just 2 of us eating. The recommended broiling times per side is 2-3 minutes. My fillets were a little thick and I did 5 minutes per side. Next time I might change that to 6 minutes. I would just keep an eye on it. I also used lite mayo, because it was what I had on hand. The fish tastes pretty good out of the oven. But, I found that it does not re-heat well the next day in the microwave. It gets a little dry and the sauce basically disappears. It also gets very fishy tasting re-heated. So, I would make only what you need the night you make it.

My fish was only one pound so I cut everything in half except for the cheese.  That was an Italian blend of cheese, and my mayo was lite.  This was very yummy.  I kept a close eye on it, with the help of the timer and it turned out perfect.  You could add this or that but it doesnt need it.  Save those ingredients and your time for another day.  Will add to the rotation.  Thank you for sharing.

I have never and I mean never been able to cook fish that is good and tasty.  Well not now!  This is an awesome recipe.  Have cooked it twice and first time no lemon juice(didn't have) added water instead.  Second time forgot celery salt and each time delicious!  I added Old Bay each time though.  Yummy!!!

this was SO delicious! i only made small variations... i used parsley instead of basil, and added garlic and onion into the mix before i put it on the fish. i broiled it at 400 for 10 min and it was perfect! one of my guests had said he didnt like fish but HE even liked it! in his words... i 'freaked it'. we'll be makin it again for sure!!! thanks phoebe! :-)

The sauce is delicious, although a little strong! Made it with halibut because I couldn't find tilapia and baked rather than broiled because of the thicker fish.

This dish was very salty in our opinion.  Parmesean is a salty variety of cheese to begin with, and I think the addition of celery salt puts this recipe in the "too salty" category.  I'm not sure I'll try it again, but if I do, I'll use a bit of celery seed instead of celery salt.  I would also suggest using unsalted butter.  If you are going to use Old Bay as recommended by others, use sparingly because it adds to the salty factor!  The cooking time on the fish was perfect as written.

Love this recipe! To add just a bit more flavor I sprinkle the tilapia fillets with Paul Prudhomme's Magic Salmon Seasoning on both sides before broiling. My two very picky boys love this and ask for it often.

AWESOME! This is super quick and easy, perfect for a quick and healthy supper.  A ton of flavor from a small amount of ingredients.  I don't care for tilapia that you buy in the large bags, so I use a package from the seafood department.  Just the right amount of fish for a family of four.  Pair it with a salad and some couscous, and BAM! You'll look like a rockstar!  :-)

I'm not a fish person, but this is one recipe that I will gladly fix.  The combo of lemon and parmesan is SO GOOD!  I always make extra sauce so I can put it over rice and serve.  I highly recommend this recipe.  One of the best I've tried off of allrecipes!

So good. I was a little wary at first about the sauce, but it turned out delicious. I love new ways to cook fish, and I absolutely would recommend this.

WOW!  Delicious.  I just made some homemade pesto, so I added a tbs of that and omitted the various herbs. Thanks for this recipe!

Great Great GREAT! I don't like fish. Haven't attempted to eat it in years, because I KNOW how I'll hate it. Decided one day to give it a try one day... and this was awesome!

I've made this recipe three times now and its definitely a keeper. My only thing is -Make sure you cook the fish before putting the sauce on. I accidently put the sauce on the fish before cooking last time and had to make the sauce again to put on the other side of the fish after I turned it. I also use frozen fish that I thaw right before cooking so I had to cook a little longer than suggested to get the right done-ness.

Had this last night with rice and broccoli just as written and it was wonderful!!! This would be good on another type of fish (even salmon).  The sauce is rich and delicious.  This will be used quite a bit in our household.

This fish dish has become a weekly staple for my house. It is fast and easy, my two fav criteria. Great alone, often tho, I add an additional fresh  topping mix of diced tomato, basil and Gorgonzola,with a tablespoon of garlic  flavored OVOO to fancy it up a bit. Thanks for this awesome recipe!!!

I made this dish tonight for my husband who usually hates fish.  He ate it all up and asked for more!  I cut the recipe in half and only broiled the fish on each side for 2 mins.  It was delicioius!  I felt like I was at a fancy restaurant...will definately do again and again.

Mmmmm Amazing flavor and perfectly cooked fish. I used the other suggestions and also added paprika, garlic salt and bread crumbs, but think I will leave out the bread crumbs next time. I will definitely be making this again. Thank you for sharing this recipe!!

One of my favorites - easy and delicious!  Goes well on fish and chicken, and probably anything else.  Tonight I accidentally poured way too much basil into the mix, and it turned into this amazing creamy pesto-type sauce.

This was just okay.  The lemon juice and mayo made the sauce a bit too tangy for our tastes.  My husband thought it was good but my kids didn't care for it.  I probably would not make it again without substituting different ingredients for the mayo and lemon juice.

I gave it 4 stars only because it was a little heavy. Other than that it was delicious. I have a 1 year old and a 4 year old who both loved it. I added 1/2 tsp of paprika and a 1/4 tsp of garlic powder just as another review had stated. Very tasty, will make again.

This was a pretty decent recipe. I made some minor changes--used sour cream instead of mayo because I hate mayo; used garlic powder and regular salt instead of celery salt, per some reviews; and sprinkled a bit of old bay seasoning on the fillets before broiling, also per some reviews. The taste was pleasing, but not particularly strong, but I think that's my fault. I will definitely try this again, next time adding more garlic powder, and adding more than a "sprinkle" of old bay seasoning right into the parm mix. I think those small adjustments could kick my rating to a 4 or even a 5. FYI, i served with spinach-ricotta tortellini as a side dish--made a great combo!

I stumbled upon this website, decided to try this recipe and I loved it! I didn't have the dried basil, onion powder, and celery salt but even without them it was delicious. I recommend this to anyone who wants to try something that is out of the usual and simple tilapia dish.

I tried this tonight but used rockfish instead b/c it was on sale and it's my favorite fish.  The ONLY thing I did differently was to sprinkle the fish with Old Bay while broiling.  I also did use low fat butter and mayo.  This was the BEST fish recipe I have ever tasted.  My hubby and one of my daughters even commented how delicious it was.

Something different for tilapia.  It had a great flavor and I will fix again.  Make sure you use a pan with a lip  I did not and when I put the mayo mixture on the fish, it dripped all in my oven.  No fun and smelly.  But, the fish was great!

This recipe was very tasty.  I rated it four stars rather than five simply because it is just so very salty. I would highly recommend omitting the celery salt altogether and even using unsalted butter to cut back on the salt, since Parmesan is already so very, very salty. Other than that, we really enjoyed this nice strong flavor to accompany a mild fish.

OMG this is wonderful.  My new favorite recipe for Tilapia.  I substitued 1 T. fresh basil for the dried, I added 1 T. fresh thyme, and I used Old Bay Seasoning for the onion pwd & celery salt. I sprinkled Old Bay on fillets before broiling and I did everything else the same way as printed. Great! Enjoy!

Delicious!!  We'll be making this one again for sure!  I did make some changes suggested by others.  I skipped the lemon juice and the celery salt and I added garlic powder, a little paprika, and some panko bread crumbs.  A lot of the Parmesan cheese mixture melts off the fish as it's broiling, so I think next time I'll try to contain it with foil and drizzle it over the fish when serving.

Super easy even for someone worried about cooking fish.  My husband could not stop raving about the taste.  I used Shannon's suggestion from 10/30/06 and added paprika, garlic powder, and panko break crumbs.  Seriously the easiest fish dish I have ever made and quite a good reaction from the family.  From start to finish in under 10 minutes!

This is a great meal and easy!  Prior to broiling, I personally put a light coat of olive oil on the fish with salt and pepper to season the fish up.  Then I coat them with the mixture.  Everyone loves this in my family.

I have never been able to cook great fish, but this was easy and awesome!  It was ready in no time, but next time I'll use a little less lemon juice.

Super simple and Super delicious. I'm a college student so quick and easy rules my weekday dining in between classes and study hall. I used frozen Tilapia fillets and for a side just the steam fresh frozen veggies and ABSOLUTELY AMAZING now I know how I'm going to cook the rest of the Tilapia and probably what I will be eating for the next week straight, it really is that good I was actually licking the plate the sauce was delicious. I love garlic so I did add just a dash of garlic powder but really easy to build this sauce to your own tastes.

FANTASTIC recipe. Many recipes are delicious but this one is also quick, easy, ingredients are readily available and picky eaters like it too. The recipe is perfect as-is but I also like to add some break crumbs and pepper flakes.

I received this recipe on my daily RSS feed from Allrecipes and it looked really good and Tilapia was on sale at the local store. This recipe turned out really well and I followed it as written. I do not suggest that any changes be made to the recipe as written. My wife and son declared this a keeper.

This was delicious. I have been looking for new ways to make fish and this recipe will be used frequently! The fish turned out so tender and flavorful! I used lime juice because I didn't have lemon and added a bit of garlic powder, but no huge adjustments. Awesome!

This dish was easy and tasted GREAT! My husband loved it and I was glad I found something different to do with tilapia,.  The lemon flavor was great and I added the seasoning directly on the fish and added Old Bay to it and it worked out well.

Outstanding!!!  I also substituted breadcrumbs for half the parmesan cheese as well as sprinkled Old Bay Seasoning on the fish before broiling.  This was amazing and will certainly become a favorite go-to recipe.  Thanks, Phoebe, for sharing this!

Excellent meal! Quick and easy. I was worried about the timing of the fillet in the oven but it turned out perfect! I think I added a bit too much celery salt but none the less a great recipe.

I have made this recipe several times and it's always a hit.  Although we prefer it made with the fish, if you are not a fish lover, you can substitue skinless, boneless, chicken breasts.  They will take a little longer to broil, depending on the thickness.  I sliced the breasts into thinner slices to help them broil more evenly.

This reciepe I have made millions of times as it is very easy and quick. I make it for all my friends and they love it every time.  I dont even measure the ingredients anymore. I edit the basil and celery salt and use regular salt and lemon peper instead.

I seasoned the filets with Old Bay, which I may not do next time as I felt like there was too much of an herb-y taste to the fish.  Still edible, just a little much.  The fish had a great melt-in-your-mouth consistency though which was really good.

Now that baseball season is over I’m back in the kitchen, I made this for an after work out dinner (with a couple of modifications) and it turned out great, I used Smart Balance instead of butter, I also used a lite mayo, I lightly seasoned the fish before broiling with salt, paper, garlic and paprika, The cheese mixture is going to be fun to work with I added a little red pepper flake to mine and I think next time I’m going to sub the mayo with yogurt, Nice recipe two thumbs up

This recipe is great.  I tried it with Mahi fish and tilapia and they both came out great.  I did add on some tips from Sharon since everyone says its better that way and I couldn't agree more.  Will be making this dish again

My husband and two very picky teenagers LOVED this dish!  I reduced the parmesan cheese slightly and added crushed Tuscan flavor pita chips for a little crispiness.  It was so easy, fast, and delicious.  My husband said he would order this in a restaurant.  This will be a keeper!!

Love this. This is such a quick and simple twist on traditional broiled fish! I subsitute garlic salt for celery salt and it complements the parmesan nicely. Love it!

Made this for the hubby for dinner and it was yummy!  I broiled the fish 3 min on one side and then a total of 7 min on the other side.  The fish came out perfectly flaky but the topping never browned.  I think because I reduced the recipe to just 2 servings, it didn't translate very well.  Next time I will reduce the mayo by at least half and see how that works because the topping seemed runny.  I'll also try what some other reviewers did and broil it with the topping on it from the beginning and not worry about flipping.  But no matter what  troubles I had, this will definitely be something I'll make again.  The combination of flavors was fantastic!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I followed a another reviewer in subsituting celery salt for celery seed and added a small handful of bread crumbs.  Garlic is a must in my family so that was added.  This will be added to my rotation of recipes.

This was an OK dish. The mixture is a bit strong for the tilapia flavor but my family did really like it. It would have been better with less butter and maybe some panko mixed in like another reviewer used.

I love this recipe.  It's delicious, but it's also healthy and so easy that my 11 year old son can make it and feel awesome because he cooked supper.  That said, we do make some changes to suit our tastes:  we cut way back on the mayo and use fresh basil instead of dried if we've got it.  We also don't use celery salt.  I think next time I make it, I'm going to use pecorino cheese instead of parmesan.  One last thing- we always sprinkle the filets lightly with Old Bay or cayenne before we toss them in the oven.  If you haven't tried this yet, you really should.

I normally never review, but this tilapia was absolutely phenomenal! My sister described it as tasting like something that would be at Olive Garden (and no wonder, it's so rich) but absolutely worth it. I did add the breadcrumbs, and substituted lime for lemon which we didn't have on hand, and added some other spices (dill, cayenne, garlic powder) and it came out phenomenally. Even if I didn't I have a feeling this recipe is rather forgiving, so I will definitely experiment next time!

This was really good, but I had problems with the topping staying on the tilapia. With the tilapia being hot when adding it, it melted. I think next time I'll try putting the topping on the tilapia before broiling.

I loved this.  I have made it without the butter and half the mayo and it was still great if not better.

YUM!  thanks so much for the recipe.  Did not have celery salt but still tasted great.  Also added bread crumbs.  Definitely a keeper. :)

I made a slight adjustment to the recipe to hopefully get my very picky son to eat it.  He loved it!  I melted the butter w/the lemon juice, mixed in the mayo and added the seasonings and cheese to 1 1/2 of bread crumbs.  dipped fish in butter mixture, rolled in bread crumb mixture, baked at 350 for 15 minutes and broiled until browned.  It was a hit!

Not exactly a low-calorie/fat dish, but oh so good! It was a nice change to have a rich sauce atop the tilapia (which we normally just add spices to rather than cheese, butter, etc.). The time-saving element of this dish was a definite plus! We will likely cook this one again.

Great, easy meal.  I used catfish because that's what I had on hand.  I'm eager to try it with tilapia next time.  Loved the sauce, too...perfect complement to the fish.

What a quick and simple way to serve a healthy meal.  I added finely chopped spinach and didn't have a lot of Parmesan, so I opted for some mozzarella as well.  It was a bit more creamy (and added extra fat of course) but admittedly; IT WAS GREAT!!!  The kids loved this and it was the quickest fish recipe I have tried yet!

Perfect.  We all really enjoyed this.  With the exception of adding 1/8 tsp garlic powder, I followed the recipe exactly, even the cooking times worked just right.  Will definitely be making this again.  Used the pre-frozen fillets in a bag at Save-A-Lot (instead of purchasing from the fish counter at the store where they would cost twice as much) and they worked beautifully in this.

I was looking for a recipe to use up some tilapia filets we had bought from Walmart and came across this. I had everything but the lemon juice and it was fine without it. I just baked mine in the oven at 350 for about 15 minutes and they were awesome. I also put a little garlic powder in with the other spices and I sprinkle some Old Bay over the filets before adding the topping. This dish is company worthy and it only takes a short time to prepare! Thanks Phoebe!

Tried this tonight and my husband who only like fried fish loved it! My 4 year old ate every bite too. It was so easy. I did change some of the seasonings. Didn't have any basil so instead i used Mrs. Dash Garlic and herb, lemon pepper, celery seed, and paprika.  Kept everything else the same.  Will try on some fresh fish my husband catches!

Pulled some tilapia out of the freezer tonite, and this was the first recipe I looked at.  I made the recipe exactly as stated.  My 3 kids and I ate every bit of this and they were asking before dinner was over when I was going to make it again!  Served it with confetti rice...I cook any leftover veggies (I like celery, onion, shredded carrots, peas, corn or whatever) with a tiny amount of oil and garlic...then add chicken broth and brown rice and cook it all together.  My husband does not care for fish at all, so this will become a meal that we will eat whenever he is traveling!  THANK YOU!

Excellent dish.  The key is to cook the tilapia just before the coating is about to burn.  I followed the step to a T, and then popped it back in the oven at 1 minute intervals about 4 or 5 times, checking the flakiness each time.  The dark brown (near burnt) coating coincided with the fish being cooked perfectly.

I added some fine bread crumbs to mine because the sauce looked a little too thin. It was delicious. The best thing about this recipe is that you can make it from scratch faster than you can get in your car and drive to a fast food restaurant!

My family was not excited about fish and cheese, in fact I had to make some fish plain.  But after tasting this recipe they want me to make all the tilapia this way the next time.

Very tasty.  I used the leftover parmesan sauce on chicken and broiled that also.  Definitely tastes best on tilapia though!

Easy and delicious! I love that I always have all the ingredients on hand. I grilled the tilapia instead of broiling and it was perfect.

This recipe is a keeper!  Modifications:  * instead of onion powder, I used garlic powder * instead of celery salt, I used seasoned salt * also used Old Bay on the fish as well as in the mixture * added cayenne pepper to the fish * squeezed the remaining lemon onto the fish prior to putting the cheese mixture on  As other reviewers have mentioned, the cheese mixture makes more than enough for 2 pounds of fish. (Not that I'm complaining!)  It took about 8 minutes to cook and get the cheese nice & bubbly.  I served this tilapia with home fried potatoes and steamed broccoli.

This is my family's all time FAVOURITE way to eat fish! It is extremely fast and easy. I make the cheese mixture earlier, and let the flavours 'set' in the fridge for the day. The cheese mixture starts to melt when you put it on the fish, so I remove it from the fridge just before putting it on the fish. This helps to keep it 'on' the fish, and not running onto the baking pan (although if any does run onto the pan, we make sure to scrape it up and put it back on the fish just before serving... it's THAT good!). Thanks Phoebe!

Wow!! Very simple receipe & ingrdients. I'm not really a fan of Parmesan cheese so I mixed in Mozerella. It came out great and my family loved it so much they don't want Talapia any other way.

This is my absolute favorite Tilapia recipe.  It's crazy quick and has the most scrumptious flavor.  I love the taste of the Parmesan cheese and fresh lemon juice atop these fillets.  And since grilling is my favorite way to prepare fish, broiling this Tilapia gives it that almost "seared" flavor.  Superb!!

This was delicious. I got "the look" from my husband when he took his first bite! As others had advised, I added a touch of Old Bay and bread crumbs. I broiled on low for two minutes on one side (I had VERY thin fillets), and two minutes on the other, then added topping for three or until it was good and browned. It took longer to make the side dishes than the fish!

This was the first time I had ever cooked fish.  I love most seafood but my husband doesnt like it if it's too fishy tasting.  I was worried he wouldn't like it (he's a very good cook and I am just learning).  He thought it was very good.  I would suggest using juice from a real lemon and not from the bottle, as I did.  I should bring out more parmesan and less fish

My 8 year old daughter is crazy about this fish!  It simply is delicious - we usually pair it with penne pasta tossed with herbs, olive oil, and parm cheese and a simple fresh green vegie side.  Thank you, Phoebe!

I loved this. But my husband, who hates fish still hated it with the topping. And my teenagers who love fish scraped off the topping. They probably all would give it a 2 or 3. but I loved it.

Excellent and easy. For extra crunch on top I smashed up some garlic croutons and sprinkled it over the cheese at the end. Or you could use panko and dot with butter!

Did not use mayo and celery salt.  Replaced butter with olive oil.  Used lime juice instead of lemon.  Used frozen Tilapia filets and broiled them 15-20 minutes. Served with a side of couscous and a tossed salad. Turned out great.  Family wants this dish again soon!

This was delicious and like a dish in a fine-dining restaurant.  I didn't have celery salt, so I used some Old Bay Seasoning & Adobo Seasoning, and I sprinkled garlic powder as well, and used lite mayo.  I soaked the fish in milk to take away any fishiness.  Great flavor!

I love Tilapia and searched for a different way to prepare it.  This recipe is flavorful, quick and easy. I have made it several times.  If you dont have celery salt, you can substitute it for seasoned salt.  This is an excellent way to prepare tilapia or any type of white fish.

I followed the recipe exactly except instead of the basil and celery salt, I used powdered garlic and an onion/pepper/parsley seasoning blend.  These came out great.  The other thing I think I will try is to soak the fish in milk before broiling to take a little more of the "fishy" flavor out of it.  I don't mind it, but I have two little kids and they would prefer it that way (or at least fight me less, I think).

With all of the great reviews, I was excited to make this and I expected it to be great. Honestly it was just ok. I've had a lot of different tilapia sauces, and I won't be making this again. It was kind of bland.

A new favorite! I used frozen fillets staight from the freezer. Fast and Easy! Put a little old bay and lemon juice on top and cooked for about 18 min at 350. Then put the sauce on and broiled for the last few min. Came out perfect and delicious!

GREAT!  I use the same amount of toppings called for here with 1 lb. tilapia.  This dish, wild rice and a vegetable is probably the quickest meal I can make that I would definintly serve to company.

I hate fish. However, my husband does not, and I love him so much I was willing to take one for the team and try this recipe out. The outcome...I still hate fish. BUT, if I did like fish, I would eat it like this. The cheese dressing was delicious. My husband really liked it. I think anyone who enjoys eating fish will like this recipe. And anyone who does not, will enjoy scrapping off the topping like I did. I did omit the lemon juice and I added garlic powder as I would put that on ice cream if I could. All in all, this is easy, quick, and worth a shot. The only down side is...it's fish.

I found this recipe over a year ago when i was trying to find something to make my tilapia taste better. Well i found it! we have probably ate this atleast once a month since we found the recipe and i'm making it tonight. the only thing i dont do is the celery salt because i dont have it i just us a little sea salt. and if i dont have fresh parmesan i use motz. cheese and its wonderful that way too!!!

Awesome recipe!!!  I followed someones advice to add bread crumbs to the topping and it was a great idea.  I made it the first time with the bread crumbs and the topping stayed on top perfectly but the second time I forgot them and it all melted off the fish.  It took me a minute to figure out what happened.  I will always use the bread crumbs from now on.  I also added about 1/4 tsp. paprika and everything was wonderful!!  This is a keeper!!

I did this recipe just as written and really liked it. It was easy and quick, with basic, simple ingredients. As per many of the reviews there are many ways you could 'tweek' this with what sounds like still great results. This is a keeper for sure.

I am not a fish person, but I actually liked this a lot. I reduced the lemon juice and added breadcrumbs, as suggested by others. The cooking time was perfect as is and the sauce on top was great!

I skipped the lemon (didn't have any) and celery salt, but even without these it was delicious. I also added bay seasoning. Mayo is the secret here as that's how I always cook my fish in the oven whether it's tilapia, salmon, cod, etc. It helps get rid of some of the really fishy taste that comes with store bought fish, even if you spread just a thin layer on. Loved the taste of the parmesan with it. Will definitely be making this often since tilapia is one of my favorites.

Delicious!!!  Didn't have all the spices the recipe asked for, so I only added onion powder, garlic powder, lemon-pepper seasoning.  I also don't usually buy lemons but I substituted with lime juice.  And because we like the taste of it we did a half Romano and half Parmesan cheese.  Wonderful!  Served with broiled asparagus spears and garlicky-white rice with diced carrots and peas.

It's really good.  Try it!!  You can't go wrong with the ingredients either.  A little more of one thing, a little less of another.  I didn't have onion powder or celery salt, but it still turned out great.  EASY, FAST, HEALTHY.

This recipe is absolutely wonderful!!  I will definitely be making it again.  I made it exactly the way it said to but I took the fish out when it had one minute left and topped it with pecans then put it under the broiler for one more minute.  My husband said he thinks this is my best meal yet!!  Kids all loved it as well.

This was delicious! I used 3 tilapia fillets, and used 2 T smart balance/reduced fat butter, about 1/3 C parmesan, and added some garlic powder and about 1/4 C flavored bread crumbs. I skipped the celery salt.  I broiled the fillets for about 8 minutes on one side before adding the topping, which was on for about another 5 minutes.  I didn't flip the fish.  This was great, Thanks Phoebe!

This is surprisingly good, my family liked it so much I made it twice! I eye balled the amounts, used fat free sour cream one time & plain yogurt the other time and about the same spices plus paprika and it came out well both times. I only did 5 min one side, flipped and spread the topping and broiled another 5. I disagree with the person who said it was too pungent. I think the creamyness of the spread compliments the buttery tilapia and the aged parmesan. I'm going to try this with other whitefish.

I found this dish quick and easy, nice for a weeknight meal with a vegetable and potato. The taste is delicious and my family enjoys it very much.

Wow!  I tried to make this lower in fat by using low fat mayo and less low fat butter.  The seasonings make this so great!  I use Old Bay seasoning and have used just a number of different spices, just to make it different.  My husband and I love this and make it bi-weekly.

Very good fish dish!  My boyfriend liked it and he's not even a fan of fish.  I did add old bay seasoning and it didn't come out too salty.  Will make again

My husband and I love this recipes.... I do a few things differently...I use light mayo and add about a teaspoon of breadcrumbs to the mix and sprinkle some over the top before cooking.  I also use Mrs. Dash's italian seasoning instead of the spices it calls for...delicious!!!

This recipe is awesome.  I followed other reviews and added bread crumbs to the mixture, and use celery seeds instread of the celery salt.  When trying to eat healthy i will omitt the butter and use light mayo and still tastes delicious.  This recipe is so quick and easy , on busy nights I will make the topping ahead of time.

This is my favorite way to cook tilapia.  I omit the celery salt because I never have any, and add garlic powder and paprika.  It's so simple and fast.

This was very good.  I used Halibut because that's what I had but its a mild fish like tilapia.  Besides that I made a few other changes, I used garlic powder instead of onion powder (I typically don't like onion powder), I added a 1/4 cup of panko bread crumbs and added 1/8 tsp. of paprika.  My fiance who says he doesn't like fish, liked this.  Yummy.

Everytime I make this it is WONDERFUL.  I've adjusted some of the seasoning and it doesn't seem to matter what you do.  Tweak it a little bit to suit your tastes for the night, but in the end I have never been able to make this recipe end up with less than 5 star taste.  This is one of the very few dishes my husband actually requests!

This was very good! I only did 1 serving for myself, but it was easy to cut the recipe down to 1. I only made a few adjustments... I brushed the tilapia with a small amount of melted butter and coated it with italian bread crumbs. While the fish was broiling I made the cheese mixture - instead of mayo I used goat cheese. I didn't use the celery salt or onion powder - I just used salt. Everything else I did according to the recipe. It came out very well!

It was a bit on the salty side for my taste.  Must have been the onion salt??  Also took longer than it called for.. but that's just fish.

I really loved the playing around people did with this wonderful base recipe.  I broiled my fish with a very light dusting of lemon pepper seasoning and extra freshly ground pepper.  My cheese mixture consisted of light mayo, fresh grated parm and panko bread crumbs.

Awesome! I was a bit skeptical, but it turned out wonderful. It reminded me of something you would get in a restaurant. To be honest I had never broiled fish before and I was amazed at how quick it cooked. THANK YOU so much for posting. I didn't have the lemon juice but was still delicious!!! My teenage son doesn't care much for cheesy recipes, so I may take other's suggestions and half the parmesan and substitue bread crumbs for him, but the rest of us loved it as is.

Delicious! Here is what I did. I always have frozen tilapia fillets in the freezer (fish is actually a better quality when it is frozen). I had 5 fillets and I put them on a foil lined pan.  Sprinkled the frozen fillets with old bay and put them under the broiler until they were no longer frozen.  To the spread I added a handful of breadcrumbs, olive oil mayo, old bay, garlic salt, and dried chopped onion.  I did not use the lemon, basil, onion powder, or celery salt.  The cheese I used was a blend of asiago, parmesan, and romano. I spread a heaping tsp of that on the fillets then sprinkled a little bit more cheese and breadcrumbs for a crust.  Then put it under the broiler until it was nice and golden brown.  I knew I would have extra spread so I bought white mushrooms (about 12) and stuffed those with the spread and put those under the broiler.  The stuffed mushroom idea came from another reviewer. This was an amazing recipe.  The stuffed mushrooms and fish tasted like they were from the restaurant.

The topping makes the dish delicious. I double the amount of topping like others suggested, but I realized I should not double the butter. I also sprinkled so extra parmesan on top. It was very tasty, and my son loved it.

I actually give it 4.5 stars.  I added a bit more onion powder, some garlic powder, and Old Bay Seasoning.  I had to bake the fish a little longer because I think I added a little too much topping and it took a little longer to brown.  I also topped off with a little more parmesan.  Otherwise, my husband and I loved it.  He loved it so much that I ended up buying a bulk package of frozen tilapia so we can enjoy it again and again :)  I served it with some white rice with basil and garlic and blanched broccoli with freshly ground black pepper.  Very tasty!

I made this recipe and it is fantastic! The only thing I added was 1/8 tsp of garlic and I only used 3 filets. Made some rice pilaf and green beans. Dinner is ready in 30 minutes! We're having it for dinner again tonight. Thanks for the great recipe. It's definitely a keeper.

The sauce was super fantastic! Everybody in my family loved it. I added a 1/4 tsp. of Paprika and thats all I changed. I also used frozen fillets so I just followed the directions on the back of the package and I put the sauce on the fillets with around 10-15 mins left and it was just perfect.

This has a unique, delicious flavor that complements any flaky, white fish. I used tilapia, and I also tried it with turbot. Both were excellent!!!

I really enjoyed this one. I added garlic croutons and celery seed as other have suggested and used. This turned out good. I didn't use real lemon juice. I will decrease the amount of lemon next time.

Very Flavorful recipe! I added garlic powder and paprika per some of the other suggestions, plus I altered the cooking directions. Instead of broiling the fish, I made a foil packet, sprayed it to prevent sticking, and covered the fillet with the cheese topping. It took about 15-20 min on 350 degrees.

This is a great recipe. I followed the recipe except for a few small changes: celery seed and dried onion flakes because I didn't have celery salt or onion powder. My hubby is not a big fish lover unless it's fried and covered in tartar sauce...and he ate four pieces!

Wow!  Thank you for a great recipe.  Who would have thought that you would ever see the words "fish" and "my family loves" in the same sentence.  I made this exactly as written....don't change a thing.

I'll rate it a 4, it's a good and fair dish, I could really taste the Parmesan cheese, especially after a few bites but it never did get like crusty like they say to let it get. It makes a boring dish step up.

I love this recipe...My Dad used to grill all kinds of different fish when i was a kid, and would make this topping but he'd put chopped green onions in it.20 some odd years later I asked him how he use to make it and he had forgot,or only remember the parmesan, butter, green onoins, and mayo but couldn't remember how much.So thank you very much for the recipe.Now my kids get to enjoy it and bring back some good memories for myself.

Great recipe!  I have been trying to make fish that the family likes.  Tonight I got the first thumbs up from the family!  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  I didnt' have lemon juice and I used low fat mayo and it came out great.

I don't normally change recipes but fish should cook with seasonings already on it so I put all the seasonings on the fish with a few pieces of butter on top and added the parmesan/butter.mayo on top. I didn't care for the topping but the fish was good.

Absolutely amazing! I cooked the fish according to the package at 350f for 20 minutes, then spread the parmesan mixture over it and broiled it for 2 more minutes. SO GOOD!! I received many compliments, and I quote: "Like something that you would get at a restaurant."

It was delicious! It made frozen tilapia taste incredible and completely hides that fishy taste from frozen seafood. I used miracle whip instead of mayo and rubbed the filets in magic's seafood seasoning before broiling.

i followed the recipe exactly, yummy but the sauce overpowered the fish - maybe too much lemon like others posted.  Otherwise quick and delicious, would make again.

Very tasty and fairly simple. I've never attempted any fish before and I found this very easy. I used frozen Tilapia and just let thaw out for a few hours and it was good to go. Tasted just as good as fresh and made it very easy.

2 words. Deeeeee Lishhhh! I usually leave the fish cooking to my husband so I don't screw it up, but this was simple enough for me to accomplish on my own. Since tilapia is my go to fish, this is my go to recipe. The only thing i did differently was, i used a little kosher salt and celery seed since i had no celery salt. Just beware, fresh parmesan is salty, so go easy. You can always add more later. Thanks for the simple recipe.

Wonderful!  I only changed one thing...I added Old Bay directly to the fish per other suggestions.  Thanks!

This was incredibly easy and incredibly good.  It's the first recipe I grab when I don't want to cook!  Steam some veggies and you've got a meal.

We do not like mayo so I used 3 tablespoons of 1/3 less fat cream cheese (microwaved for 20 seconds to soften it) instead.  Didn't have celery salt or lemon juice and it was still great! Delicious! My husband and I really liked it!

This recipe was very easy to prepare and had wonderful flavor. Definitely a repeat. Like others, I made a few modifications: 1) to lighten the fat a bit, I used light mayonnaise and Smart Balance. Also, I used fresh basil rather than dried. 2) spray the foil and the Tilapia with olive oil. 2) sprinkle fish with garlic and pepper 3) broil 3 minutes (vein side down). 4) spread Parmesan/mayo/butter/basil mixture over fish. 5) broil 3 more minutes, watching closely until topping is lightly browned.

Very, Very Tasty! The whole family enjoyed this fish (even the very picky 5 year old)! I changed this just a little.  I didn't have celery salt so I used garlic salt and I added a couple of dashes of cayenne to the mix.  Will most definately will make this again! Thanks for the recipe.

This fish is AMAZING! Unfortunately, I did not have a broiling pan, or celery salt. I reduced the serving size down to 2, and added 1/8th tsp garlic, and red pepper flakes.  I then followed directions except I heated a pan on the stove at medium heat with spray canola oil lightly covering the pan. I cooked the fish for approx. 3 min on each side until it was white and almost completely cooked.   I then applied the ingredient paste over the fish, cooked for 1 minute, then flipped the fish, reapplied ingredient paste, and cooked for another minute.   BEST MEAL IN YEARS! BEST PARMESAN EVER!  I may have slightly overcooked the fish, but I couldn't tell a difference.

My boyfriend and I both really, really liked this, and I used the leftover fillet for a caesar salad topping the following day!  I used half of the topping mixture on the tilapia, and mixed the rest into brown rice I had prepared as a side dish.  With a little added garlic powder, it complemented the fish perfectly!

This recipe was DELICIOUS! I altered it some just because I didn't have a couple of the ingredients, but it was yummy anyways. Instead of onion powder I added garlic powder, and used fresh basil instead of dried. I left out the celery salt for lack of having any. I served my fish over wild rice with a side of broccoli. I'll definitely be making this again. Thanks so much!

Use real parm, not the cheapy kraft in a shaker! Makes a huge difference. Also subb'd the onion powder for 1 clove minced garlic, used concentrate lemon juice(I never have real ones on hand) and used celery seed instead of salt since I didn't have that, either. After putting the mix on the fish I dusted the tops with bread crumbs. Absolutely delicious.

Over 3000 reviews drew my attention, and I'd like to add another thank you for this simple yet delicious recipe. I'm a 25 year old bachelor with minimal cooking experience and this was a cinch. I followed the directions as stated, sprayed a generous amount of cooking spray on the foil (which I put on a pizza pan) and served with steamed cheesy brocoli and rice pilaf. I highly reccomend trying; it was a fun and easy way to learn how to use my oven's broiler. It's like an upside down grill... flip, flip, serve!

Just got done eating this and made a few tweeks of my own. I didn't have celery salt or onion powder, but I did add the garlic powder, red pepper flakes, bread crumbs and paprika that another user suggested. I also used low fat mayo and margarine. The only thing that didn't work for me was coating the fish in the breading. I found that after broiling the fish for three minutes, the mixture would not stick to the fish so I didn't get an all over crispy topping as I was hoping for. It did taste great, though!

This is awesome! We have made it so many times and we love it every time. Our favorite fish to make it with is Orange Roughy. It is flavorful with out being over powering. Perfect topping for fish and great preparation method!

Excellant fish. I only made 3 sev. so the ingredients were just fine. This is a keeper. Next time I will add the paprika as someone else suggested. That sounds like a good idea. This is a quick dish.

This was wonderful! Easy, quick, and decadent. Definitely a keeper. I added some garlic due to personal preferences and placed the fish over slices of lemon in the pan in order to steam some juice into them. The result was flaky flavorful fish with an interesting texture due to the Parmesan! Thanks for the excellent recipe!

I used reduced fat parmesan, light mayo, and Brummel and Brown for the butter and only 1 T lemon juice. I didn't have any celery salt, increased the black pepper to probably 1 t, and used 1/4 t seasoned salt. After I sprinkled the herbs on the fish, I sprayed each fillet with cooking spray.  Broiled for 4 minutes and didn't flip it. Added the coating on top of each fillet (I had 3 fillets, but there was enough coating for at least 4 more) and broiled on second rack from the top for 2 minutes on high.  The fish was perfectly moist. The flavor was great. I will use this many more times and will try it on other white fish fillets!

I really liked this recipe.  I am not a fish/seafood lover but we are trying to do better.  My six year old son absolutely loved it, he asked if he could have my husbands portion (he wasn't able to get home in time for dinner) or if we could have it again tomorrow. Next time I may omit the celery salt or try something that doesn't add any more salt to it.  Other than that, very good recipe.  I never follow a recipe twice, so nice time may be even better.

My husband and I both loved this recipe! I followed it exactly, with the exception of adding a sprinkle of Old Bay in with the parmesan cheese mixture. I'll definitely be making it again!

Delicious! I used shredded swiss/gruyere cheeses; minced garlic; sweet home grown lemon; "no-salt;" home grown basil and chives; and melted the butter. Thanks for sharing your great recipe!

I make this fairly often -- very easy and quick. It's a little rich with the butter and mayo, which is why I only gave it four stars. But a nice weekday meal!

We had some tilapia in the freezer that we were loathe to eat because our first experience with it was so awful.  This recipe is amazing!  Even my five picky sons gobbled it up!  I highly recommend this, it is sooo easy and remarkably yummy.

Made this for dinner last night and hubby really liked it.  I made it exactly as written exacpt I cut it down to two servings and used the toaster-oven broiler instead of heating up the whole house with the regular oven.  We had some frozen tilapia filets that were of mediocre quality and have been putting off using them becaus of that so I searched for something flavorful to dress them up, this did it, those filets will now be gone in no time.  Thanks!

Great flavor! The parmesan, mayo, and vinegar make a wonderful tangy topping for the fish. This amount of sauce is too much for the fish it calls for, so I just put a dollop on each fillet and toss the rest.

This is a great recipe! I make it frequently...it's super simple!  I do change the mayo, butter and parm. cheese to the lower fat versions to help reduce the fat in the recipe...and it still comes out great!

I have gotten into quite the habit of relying on this site for all of my meals, very convenient for every meal.  I made this dish last week because the tilapia was on sale for a great deal.  My husband literally freaked out saying, "This is the absolute best thing you have made from allrecipes.com! This is bleeping amazing!" All of course, with his mouth full. :) Since then he's asked for it 3 times, so off to the store I go... Thanks Phoebe for an amazing recipe!

Delish! I was looking for something fast, easy and delicious for my tilapia and this recipe had it all. The only substitutions I made were romano for the parmesan and garlic powder for the onion powder since that's what I had on hand. I didn't get the cheesy looking crust like in the photo that I was expecting. Mine came out more like a sauce. So I think next time I make this (and I will definitely make this again) I will either add more cheese or maybe some breadcrumbs to keep it on top of the fish.

Since I have found this recipe, I haven't made tilapia any other way!  However, I have made the following alterations to achieve the best-tasting dish:  reduce lemon juice to one tablespoon, reduce margarine to 1/8 cup and add one tablespoon red pepper flakes.  Thanks for the great base recipe!  Who would've ever thought those ingredients would go so well together?!

I have made this recipe twice now since first acquiring it. It is one of the easiest fish recipe which turns out the best results. The only reccomendation I have is for those who prefer a bit more depth of flavor, such as myself. I added Cajun seasoning to the cheese mixture in the same quantity as the black pepper.

This is an easy recipe, if you like tilapia, go for it.  The best part is that the ingredients are likley already in your pantry. You only have to shop for fresh tilapia and lemon juice.

This is the first "fish" recipe I have tried that my whole family has loved - and with four children as part of the mix that's quite an accomplishment to find something they can all agree is yummy. I did follow the recommendations on other reviews to use the old bay seasoning and I also added fresh garlic and onion.  This is definitely going to be a regular menu item in our home.

I love the simplicity of this dish. I would rate the cheese topping 5 stars it was delicious. I did sprinkle old bay season on both sides of the fish before putting it in the broiler. I wish there was a way to infuse the topping flavor more into the fish. My boyfriend really like this dish so this will be in heavy rotation at our house. A quick and easy recipe that tasty good. Can't go wrong with that!

I surprised my wife tonight and made this for dinner.  I added some bread crumbs and garlic and it tasted great.  Also used lime juice instead of lemon.  When I started broiling it I just used a greased cookie sheet.  Not a good idea, it bent and bowed, so I moved the tilapia into more sturdy pans and everything came out ok :)  Great great recipe.  I also served it with asparagus and cous cous.

Excellent - we'll have it again soon. (DH suggested adding just a touch of horseradish to the sauce next time.) Thanks so much for the recipe!!

Sometimes I buy tilapia frozen and in a bag, and when bought this way, it can be a little bland, so this sauce is an excellent way to make extra delicious those frozen, mild fish filets you keep in the freezer. So easy and the family enjoys it.

Not that this recipe needs another 5-star review, but wanted to add my thanks for this delicious and easy recipe.  We love it.  I've cut back on the volume of butter and it's still fantastic.

Oh my gosh..our whole family loves this! I tried tilapia a few years ago and did not like it. Thanks Phoebe for this awesome recipe and turning me onto this fish. My father-in-law who is so picky tried a little piece and asked if we could make it for him some night. Just a hint..the topping is great, you might want to make xtra to coat it well. Honestly, you don't really need to change a thing. Thanks again!

This may be one of the best things I've ever made.  We didn't change a thing & it was absolutely perfect.  It's a constant request from my husband.  My non-fishloving mother in law was still talking about it the next day.  Just looking at the picture is making me starving!!

Let me start by saying that trying this recipe was an adventure for my niece and I.  Neither one of us cares for fish.  My son told me to try tilapia because he thought I would like it.  So while my niece was visiting last weekend, we decided to try it.  We found this recipe and all I can say is we are hooked!  This was so delicious I couldn't believe I was eating fish.  The topping was fabulous especially where it browned the most.  Thanks Phoebe for making fish a part of my diet!

This recipe is absolutely excellent! Even my 3 year old adored it. I did however add 1/4 tsp of paprika,1/4 garlic powder,1/4 crushed red pepper, and 1/4 cup bread crumbs! The sauce was great!

This recipe is simply incredible!!! My husband and brother inlaw told me that it was the best fish they have EVER had. I feel the same way. I usually throw on some scallions or fresh green onions for some extra fresh flavor. Perfection!

This recipe was insanely awesome!! I'm not very creative when it comes to modifications so I did it just like the recipe stated. I use Brummel and Brown spread for everything because it is healthier and it worked out great. Also, I didn't have celery seed on hand so I didn't use it! This is quick, simple, and cost worthy in my book!

Wow this was really good and different from how I usually fix tilapia!!!  Instead of basil, I used fresh dill and did sprinkle filets with Old Bay as suggested.  It was just wonderful!

This was great. I am not sure how closely I followed the recipe, since I was scaling it for just two pieces of fish.  I did use all the ingredients, just probably not in the right amounts. I was apprehensive about using too much mayo, so I only used a little bit but I really couldn't taste it at all and I probably could have spread the topping more easily with more in there. I served it atop the Orzo Alfredo recipe from this site, with roasted garlic and a baguette on the side. I also managed to use my broiler without burning the food, so that was a major success. I think next time though I will put some dry seasonings on both sides of the fish before adding the topping to give it a little more flavor. Very easy meal and I'm looking forward to having it again. Boyfriend liked it too.

This was delicious.  I had inadvertantly mixed some crumbled gorgonzola in - it was in with my parmesan from a previous recipe.  There probably wasn't much in there but it's so strong, and it tasted great.  I also added a few tablespoons of breadcrumbs as someone suggested.  I cut back on the butter and substituted some olive oil.  The topping was slightly crispy and went beautifully with the fish.

Oh yay!  I was sooo sick of tilapia, and had been avoiding the last two fillets in my freezer for - a while.  I just couldn't stomach another bland flaky fish with lemon wedge... and this recipe saved me.  I sprinkled a little Old Bay on the fish before going in to the broiler... and added paprika, salt vs. celery salt (because I was out), a little flake red pepper, and some old crusty bread crumbs.  No measuring - I just eye-balled it, and it turned out awesome.

So good and so easy. Didn't have enough parmesan so I used 1/4 cup mozzarella and it was still good. Added garlic because I add garlic to everything. My 4 year old ate it and she doesn't eat many things I make.

Absolutely delicious! Even my husband and kids ate it which is saying something. I did tweak it a little with the spices. I used blackened seasoning instead of those listed. And I broiled it in a little chardonnay. I will definitely be making this one again!

Just average. Good flavor but the looks and texture weren't fabulous. I'll try panco bread crumbs next time to try and help the texture.

Love this recipe!  My hubby was the only one who ate fish before, now we all enjoy it!  This recipe I found makes too much sauce, so I cut it in half.  Excellent and REALLY fast to put together!

Perfect as-is!    When i told my mom what we were having for dinner, she was disappointed, saying she did not like tilapia.  She tried it though and absolutely LOVED it.  She realized she likes tilapia, but just never had it prepared well. This recipe is really delicious and very quick to make.

Another winner! I had six fillets I wanted to cook, so I used this recipe and Grilled Tilapia with Mango Salsa also from this site.  I did three fillets under each recipe and had them side by side. The cheese spread for this was very tasty.  I should have left it longer under the broiler to brown it and get kind of a crust on the fish.  I don't like fish, but this makes it actually taste good!!  Nice job Phoebe!

This was okay, but I feel like something was missing - though I don't know what. I'll play around with it and when I figure it out, I'll let you know. I still gave it a four though because it was good, but what I really like is all the ingredients called for were readily available (no having to substitute or run to the store) and it was fast to prepare. It's a great recipe for a week night when you're tired.

This was delicious! I was trying to find something that would compare to a parmesan crusted fish I had at the beach last summer, and this was very close. I used flounder b/c that is what i had in the freezer. I think this recipe is so versatile it would be good with quite a few types of fish. I also had no lemon juice, but it was fine without it in our opinion. Hubby absolutely loved this recipe so I think it will be a keeper in our house. I served it with parmesan noodles and steamed broccoli. Awesome, thanks for sharing!

I've made this recipe so many times, and my fiance routinely asks for it for dinner!  It is wonderful as is, or substituting some different herbs and spices to make it your own.  This recipe is a staple in our house, and so quick and easy to prepare.

Great flavors - blend well together for a tasty dish. Didn't WOW me though. Also, I used some walleye a coworker gave me (similiar to walleye in taste/texture). I will keep looking for another recipe though for the rest of the walleye... (would you believe there isn't a single walleye recipe on here?! haha)

This tilapia was a big hit with my fiance. It has a very  nice flavor.  My only complaint is that the sauce was not very thick and  and ran off the fish as it cooked.  It worked out ok in the end when I just poured the sauce over the fish on the plate.

We love this.  My four yr. old daughter calls it the "yummy fish."  It was the first recipe I tried on Allrecipes.com, so I gave it a four star, but after cooking it over and over, I had to come back and change the rating to a five.  Family fave!

Obviously, this recipe does not need one more star. But, I can`t help it. This was so delicious! I used the help from Sharon on this one, and added the bread crumbs to the cheese mix. Panko to be exact. And, it turned into a really nice cheesey crust.  My husband ranted and raved over this. Definately an addition to our usual recipe rotation. Made with sweet dinner rolls from this site. Can`t wait to have again!

This was much better than I thought it would be!  I'm not a fan of white fish, but I ate every bite, and my husband just went on and on about how much he loved it.  I changed the parmesan cheese to almond motzarella and the butter to Earth Balance because we don't eat dairy, but those were the only changes.  The sauce was melty and delicious.  I'll be adding this to our regular recipe rotation.

This is a great recipe for tilapia.  I used another reviewers suggestion and replaced the mayonaise with fat free sour cream.  I also used only 2 T of butter, and I added some fresh breadcrumbs.  I squeezed a little bit of fresh lemon juice on it before serving. My family loved it...even my picky 3 and 6 year olds.

We eat alot of fish, and this is by far the tasiest tilapia recipe I have found, while being the easiest. I made this exactly as written. Even my picky 3 year old (who doesn't like fish) asked for seconds.  Very flavorful, wonderful with steamed asparagus.

This was so easy to make and it was wonderful.  The whole family enjoyed it.  I was really unsure when I was making it because the butter parmesian mix was not the consistancy I thought it should have been but it turned out great.

One word OUTSTANDING!!! This is so easy. I put mayo on the fish and sprinkle carribean seasoning on the top, broil, put parm cheese on it, broil a little more, and where done. Squeeze fresh lemon juice on top, and serve with rice pilalf. YUM..

This is one of our all time FAVORITES! I have had this recipe for several years and we never get tired of it. I did recently try it with fresh parmesan instead of the grated shelf variety and I have to say we prefer the shelf parmesan. So if that's all you have on hand, go for it!

This was really good but I am rating based on the recipe. Its a 5 star with the modifications. I seasoned my filets with some cajun seasoning and added about 1/4 cup of seasoned bread crumbs to the topping mixture. I dont think it needed so much butter. I will try reducing that next time. Yumm!!

The Broiled Tilapia Parmesan was delicious.  I substituted the celery salt with southwest mrs. dash about 1/8tsp.  I recommend this dish to any who loves tilapia nd is trying to find another way to cook it.

This recipe is really good! I always lightly season my fish with old bay. I have tried this with orange roughy and it tasted just as good.

OK, well I have to say that this was AWESOME!!!  I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and added breadcrumbs (which made it nice and crunchy), paprika (gave it a nice touch of flavor and color) and actually added some olive oil to the mix with all the ingredients so that it wasn't so thick.  It was DELICIOUS!!!  My husband almost licked his plate clean and my 3 year old picky eater who hates fish, at EVERY BITE. A+++++++++

Absolutely the most delicious fish preparation ever! Foolproof, too. I found this recipe the way I do a lot of excellent recipes on this site: I searched under the food I wanted to prepare (tilapia) then sorted the hundreds of results by rating, and read the top rated ones. This was extremely highly rated, and after making it several times, I know why. Not only is it delicious, it is extremely accomodating in terms of the exact quantities/proportions of the mayo, butter and parm you put in. It cooks quickly, so definitely watch it and don't let it overcook! Even my non fish-loving 9 and 12 year old sons loved this recipe.

Made this exactly(almost) as it calls for - just didn't have any lemon juice, so left that out, otherwise followed recipe and used about 4 heaping tsp of mayo instead of what it calls for. Everyone loved it, including picky daughter. Out of 2 pounds, there are like 2 small filets left!!! Also made Baked Sweet Potatoes from this site as a side dish. Awesome recipe, will use again, and try haddock and cod too!!!

I just made this tonight for dinner and it was great.  I don't make fish often, because it never turns out, but this was easy peasy and yummy.  My 5 yr old dd asked if we could have it again tomorrow night!  I didn't have celery salt on hand, so I used celery seed and added a dash of sea salt, I also mixed parmesan and romano cheese, added a dash of garlic powder, used LF mayo and like other reviewers suggested, sprinkled the fish w/ a bit of old bay.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.  Thank you!!

this was really, really good! I followed the recipe exactly except that I used frozen tilapia from Costco. I cooked for 25 minutes at 400 degrees, then I added the topping and broiled for 5 minutes. I will be adding this to our rotation.

simply amazing! I didnt have basil but i decieded to be creative and added some bay leaf instead. i also used miricle whip in place of mayo and the lemon juice. it wasnt as liquidy and had to be smashed down out of ball shapes so i  wouldnt reccomend doing that substitution, but the recipe as written was very good!

My family didn’t care for this recipe. I honestly think it was simply a personal preference; not a bad recipe. We felt there was too much parmesan and it was overwhelming rather than enhancing to the fish. I prefer fish to be lightly seasoned, not covered up by the coating. The recipe was quick and the directions were easy to follow.

Awesome, idiot proof, works every time.
I've made this a million times and every says it's the best tilapia they've ever had.
I usually add garlic and purreed roasted red pepper to the mayo mix and it really brings it to a new level.

This recipe was delicious! I am not a fish lover, but I'm trying to incorporate more fish into my diet. My 2 year old daughter loves fish, so that's my true motivation to find and try new fish recipes. This one is a winner. It's fast, easy and tastes great! I even used Helman's Light mayo and Smart Balance butter in the recipe and it still turned out very well. I seasoned my tilapia with lemon pepper and let it marinate overnight. I also used Mrs. Dash in place of the individual seasonings. Nice!

I made this exactly like the recipe except I sprayed the aluminum with cooking spray. My husband really enjoyed it even though he's not a big fish person. It had lots of flavor, but not that strong fish taste. One of my favorite fish recipes.

Let's face it, tilapia gets boring.  This is a sure way to make it interesting.  Great recipe, I wouldn't change a thing.  Also, no clean up!

Simply delicious!  I've made this a couple times.  Once I grilled the fish on my indoor grill, but I preferred it broiled in the oven.

Absolutely perfect as-is!  If you want to add a few more spices you can, but it really is incredible as is.  Very, very delicious!  Not overly cheesy, just the right amount of flavor, and a little crunchy on the edges!

This was really great. I loved the crust it formed on top. I used lemon pepper seasoning salt because I didn't have lemon juice. I learned so much, too. I had never had Tilapia or cooked fish in the broiler before this. I would  make this again. I want to try it with orange roughy or salmon and maybe even veal.

This was a huge hit with my entire family, especially my children (who hate fish).  I had to make some substitutions (I used lime juice because I didn't have lemons, and I used garlic salt in place of the celery salt), and I also used low-fat mayo.  It was delicious!

This is delicious as written.  I made no changes whatsoever, and my family loved it.  I now have to make a double batch as everyone wants seconds!  I have shared this recipe with several friends, and they loved it too.  I love the simplicity, and love the short time required to prepare this fabulous dish.

Super easy and delicious. I was a little thrown off at first by the mayo but if you don't try this recipe you are nuts! I did sub garlic powder for the onion powder. My wife was like- OMG this is great...what's in it? We eat a lot of fish and seafood and this will become one we use again for sure.

Awesome! ...especially when adding 1/2 cup bread crumbs to the parmesan mixture. I also sprinkled a little garlic powder and paprika on the fish prior to broiling.

I made this with lime juice instead of lemon since that is all I had on hand. It was fabulous! I also left out the celery salt since I did not have any on hand. Fantastic, quick recipe for a weeknight! My children loved it!

Don't send a mob after me, but I didn't care for this. I think my husband put to much parm in it, b/c it tasted salty. Hubby pulled off the topping half way of eating it. But my mom-in-law liked it.

This was a wonderful way to enjoy fish. I just baked it in the oven instead of using the broiler, but it would be really good on the grill.

This was a wonderful recipe!  It tastes great cooked on the stove top too. My broiler stopped working so I had to cook it on the stove. I just put a little butter and spices in the pan then cooked the fish on each side for s few minutes then added the cheese mixture and put a lid on it. It wasn't crunchy but my husband still ate it up and he comes from a family that hates fish...lol. I also ran out of onion powder so used garlic powder instead and it was still great.

Added:
I broiled it this time, with the extra butter and spices, and it was awesome!

I thought this recipe was good, just not "the best".  My family liked it.  I did add Panko like another reviewer suggested.  I will make it again using a bit less lemon juice, more panko, and a bit of garlic salt.

I made this last night for dinner and it came out really good.  I changed the recipe a little bit.  I used the fat free squeeze butter instead of real butter, used low fat parm cheese and used regular salt instead of the celery salt.  The sauce came out great and was even good as leftovers.  I made with mashed potatoes and green beans.

This was ok but I just wasn't too excited about it.  All the topping ran off of the fish and onto the pan and it didn't really brown so it didn't look all that appetizing.  The taste was not bad though.

I prepared this tonight and my kids just loved it. My 13-year old son who is not fond of fish said that I was an amazing cook. thanks to this recipe. Since I don't have onion powder I put minced onion and added garlic powder. When fish is done, I drizzled bits of fried garlic (you can buy this in small bottle in chinese supermarkets and you can use this in fried rice as well). And you can't ignore this simple recipe. It's super delicious!!!

Very very good! I prepared as is with one exception. Accidentally used onion salt instead of onion powder. Oops. A little salty, but my bad. Also halved the recipe. Will use again.

Wow.  This recipe was so simple and quick I wasn't sure how it would be.  The fish was still moist.  By far, one of the best dishes (seafood or none) that I have EVER had.  This is a 2x a week meal for me.  I have it with broccoli or asparagus.  

Doesn't get much better than this.

Everyone loved this recipe.  Even my picky pint sized eaters.  Didn't have any basil so, sub'd tarragon and still came out good!  We'll be making this recipe from now on.

This was the best fish recipe that I have had ever. This is restaurant quality. This took minutes to make and I even didn't have a few of the ingredients on hand like the celery salt and onion powder so I just left them out. Quick - easy and very delicious.

Easy last-minute entree. Flavor and presentation are sophisticated enough to serve to company. 

I followed the recipe except that I used Miracle Whip instead of mayo and eliminated the lemon juice. I also added a few other spices as suggested by other reviewers. Served with baked potatoes and frozen peas. My young, somewhat-picky son ate every bite of his fish! I'll be making this one again.

This tilipia is so good, we have it at least once a week or every other week. I omit the lemon juice b/c I don't always have lemon in hand. And I always add panko for a little crispness.

Easy, fast, great. The only thing I did extra was to add a very light topping of seasoned bread crumbs on top.(based on other suggestions).

We are very picky eater and my husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. I didn't have many of the seasonings and it still came out good. I used some lemon shreds before broiling to add some extra flavor and I did not turn the fish. It came out firm and tasty! The sauce really made the fish taste WOW!

This recipe is excellent - IF you are not looking for a big fishy taste.  We make it quite often as it's a great way to prepare fish for those who are not huge fish fans.  I add bread crumbs to the top (helps hold the topping in place) and usually pair with garlic mashed potatoes.  You can save the left over hopping and put on top of plain mashed potatoes to give them a creamy, garlicky taste.  Huge hit in my family!

This was very good...I am not much of a recipe follower so just kind of dumped all the ingredients in and whipped it up, but if you like parmesan cheese this is delicious...even my 2 year old ate it, even if she did call it chicken!

I really wanted to like this recipe given all the amazing reviews, but I honestly didn't. I was looking for a parmesan tilapia recipe that didn't involve a super creamy topping, as my SO can't really deal with creamy sauces. He loved it, so I guess all in all - mission accomplished! I did add breadcrumbs to thicken it up a bit, as well as minced garlic since it needed a little something.

Excellent.  My family loved this, even my 5 and 10 year old.  A lot of the topping did slid off when I cooked it the first time.  The second time I chilled the topping in the fridge and that helped a little.  Planning on making this again and again.

The topping taste wonderful but blah I am so not a fish eater and was hoping this would make me like fish more.  It didn't.  I think I will use this on chicken next time and see how it tastes :)  Thank you for the recipe as it is perfect.  My husband liked it as well as the kids.  I just am not a lover of any fish I guess.

I've been making this for over seven years now and LOVE it! I double the topping, add 2tsp of dill relish, and 1/4c of crushed butter crackers to the mixture right before spreading on the fish. It gives it texture and color as it broils. I also put the topping on raw fish and broil on low for about 5-7 minutes. Easier than flipping partially cooked fish and trying to spread on it. I serve this with orzo with fresh spinach, chopped tomatoes and cheese mixed in and a side of broccoli.

You need to season the fish well before broiling with some seasoning salt first - otherwise it is very bland.

This recipe was so much easier than breading the fish and frying it. Better yet, my husband and my daughter both loved it. I subbed garlic powder for the onion powder and celery seed for the celery salt and added a little cayenne pepper. Great recipe!

This recipe is FANTASTIC!! I worried it would be too heavy for such a light fish but it was perfect. I only made one change--I seasoned the fillets with paprika and garlic powder on each side; I was out of Old Bay or I would have used that. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and it was melt in your mouth delicious! Even my two year old said "More 'lapia pease!!!"

I dont know that I will ever make tilapia another way. I wish I could give it 10 stars!!!!

One of my favorite fish recipes. It is SO quick and simple. It's perfect with the sauteed garlic asparagus on this site. This meal tastes like something you'd get at a fancy restaurant and they both take a VERY short time.

I didn't have onion powder or celery salt, so i replaced those with garlic salt and very finely chopped celery( which added a nice crunch). I also added creole seasoning  as per another recipe review. It was delicious! I've made it a few times since.
Very quick and easy!

I've always been timid about broiling--perhaps because of the high heat and it cooks so fast, but tried this and WOW, how easy!  The fish was cooked perfectly!  We liked the topping too, but quite fattening.  I will try to make it lighter next time.

This was FAB for the parmesan and fish lover.  Myself and my fiance loved it.  I baked mine a little longer and just poured the sauce right over the top to bake with it, then did a broil.  I acutally did it in my toaster oven the first time.  Served over flavored rice and a veggie on the side. I have used Tilapia and Flounder Fillets.   Super easy and super flavor.  No changes will be made to this.  It is perfect just the way it is.

Wow, that is the best way to describe this recipe.  Very good and they do cook really fast so be careful not to overcook.  The fish melted in your mouth and the spices did not overpower the dish.

Like some of the others, I feel kind of silly "reviewing" this recipe after so many kudos.  But don't you just LOVE it?!  You can tweak it any way you want within those ingredients.  Talk about easy and ever so tasty!  With Pan Fried Asparagus from this site, how can you get better than that!

great, simple recipe. i used "i can't believe it's not butter" to cut the fat out. after turning the fish i top it with a slice of tomato sprinkled with parmesan cheese and let that brown in the oven. it was great!

My husband loved it, my kids ate the fish before the glazed carrots so that must mean that they liked it..lol. We used frozen tilapia filets.. I think that next time I would use fresh fish so it has more of a less watery texture. Overall if my husband raves about it I will definately give it a 5 star status.

Very tasty but looked a little strange at first. I only made half the recipe and added some cayenne and bread crumbs. The bread crumbs helped the cheese mixture stay on the fish and it was yummy.

Really good and really fast.  Everyone in my house liked this recipe.  I used a foil lined sheet pan to broil the fish which I wouldn't recommend because you end up with slightly soggy fish.  Next time I will use a broiler pan to drain away excess liquid.

Good recipe.  I cut back on the fat by using 3 tablespoons butter instead of 1/4 cup... I also used 1 generous tablespoon mayo and 2 tablespoons plain yogurt instead.  This was a tasty, quick fix recipe.

Awesome EASY recipe!! My husband usually turns his nose up to fish, but with this recipe he ate 3 pieces!!! By the way, the fish was SUPER tender and flaky - not anywhere near the texture of tilapia I've cooked before. I would recommend this recipe to anyone looking for a quick and cost-effective way of preparing fish, especially for picky eaters!! :)

I was reluctant when we were making these because the mixture looked pretty gross prior to placing it on the fish. However, when all is said and done these were awesome! I think that I would follow others and add a little bit of bread crumbs to give it more hold. Also, probably add some cayenne pepper to give a little spice. Really easy to prep and cooks quick.

This earned rave reviews from my dinner companion!  I did have to make a couple of changes: I had fresh lime, but no lemon juice, so I squeezed some lime into the mix instead of measuring. I also cut the butter in half (next time, I may omit it since Tilapia is so naturally greasy), and I didn't have any celery salt, so I added a dash of table salt.  I'll make this again and stick with lime instead of lemon. It's a good fast & fancy main course.

Surprisingly good! I didn't have celery salt on hand so I didn't use that, but it was still delicious. I tried the sauce after I made it and questioned it, but once it's baked and the sauce gets slightly browned, the parmesan flavor pops, and it gives it such a wonderful flavor. I'll make this again for sure.

I really wished it turned out better.  I was kinda turned off by all that mayo, so I subbed ranch dressing instead (hey...I figured that it'd be ok because it's still white and creamy!), along with adding in the breadcrumbs.  I seasoned the sides of the fish with garlic salt and paprika before slathering on the cheese and breadcrumb mixture for the third broil.  My fiance said that the flavor was good, but there was too much topping so he ended up scraping some of it off his fish.  I might try this one again with the mayo, but I think I'll stick to panfrying my tilapia seasoned with adobo and paprika.

I am just learning how to make fish recipes and my daughter told me about this one.  I make it every week now.  I read the reviews, and sprinkled Old Bay Seasoning on the fish before broiling.  Also added a little garlic powder, paprika and cayenne pepper to the mix, and sprinkled with panko bread crumbs before final broiling.  I really love it with cod.

I tried this recipe tonight and let me tell you it was soooooooo good! My three boys loved it and my husband who always groans whenever he sees me making fish for dinner even liked it.  It is a must try recipe.  I had 2 big servings of it. I sprinkled old bay seasoning onto the fillets before I put the cheese topping on.

Soo good! I added probably 1/4 c. of whole wheat breadcrumbs to the topping, and used olive oil instead of butter. Next time I won't cook the fish on the 1st side before putting the topping on. Tilapia is usually so thin that it really doesn't need the extra cooking time. Thanks so much!!

Here are my changes...I reduced the butter by half, added 2 T. of light Ranch dressing, 1 tsp. red pepper,1 tsp. paprika and 2 T. fresh parsley, doubled the black pepper and chopped up 2 T. of red onion as I didn't have onion powder.  I also added 2 pressed garlic cloves.  I omitted the basil..just didn't have it on hand and added 1/4 C. of italian bread crumbs.  I followed the baking directions exactly.  This was out of the world delicious...tender, rich and tasty.  Be sure not to overcook the fish...it melts right in your mouth when cooked correctly!  I don't think you can go wrong with this recipe as long as you keep the base...mayo, butter, parm cheese and some seasonings.  SO quick and so easy.

Great recipe for tilapia!  I took the suggestions of others and added 1/4 cup seasoned bread crumbs, cut the lemon in half to just 1 TB, and use light mayo.  The broiling times were perfect--this fish cooked very quickly and tasted fantasic.  I served it alongside asparagus, broccoli, and seasoned brown rice.  Everyone loved it; thanks for the great recipe!!

This was the best tilapia that I have ever tastes. Most of the time it has a fishy taste to it, but this was wonderful. My roommates requested it again the next day!  There is nothing that I would change about this recipe.  I read the reviews insisting on adding bread crumbs to thicken the mixture so it wouldn't fall off of the fish, but I didn't use bread crumbs nor did my mixture fall off of the fish.  I'm assuming the bread crumbs are for cosmetic reasons so that it can have that browning affect.

Again, BEST TILAPIA!!!!!

Thank you so much !! Our daughter has not requested fish since she ate fish sticks many years ago. It will be nice not having to cook two meals when my hubby & I want fish....which will be more often now !! I didn't change a thing with this recipe.

I use this recipe all the time. It's my favorite way to cook tilapia! I add 1/2 cup bread crumbs and pile the topping on the fish (about 3-4 tablespoons on each piece). It's the best with creamy risotto and roasted asparagus!

This was by far the best tilapia I've ever cooked myself.  I did add some breadcrumbs, as others suggested, and light miracle whip gave it a nice tang.  Parm-Reg added a bit of flavor, as did garlic powder, a tiny bit of cayenne, and some sweet paprika.  The timing was perfect.  Lovely flavor!  This will become a regular in our rotation, definitely.

Yum, Yum!! Made this for the family tonight and they absolutely loved it! 10's all around. I didn't have celery salt, so I used garlic salt instead and it was still yummy. Also substituted parmesan with parmesan reggiano because it's what I had on hand. LOVE IT

I loved how quick and easy this was to prep and I had everything on hand!  I will definitely be making it again, but will add more spices and halve the mayo.    My husband liked it more with some hot sauce.

Tilapia is such a mild fish that I am always looking for ways to jazz it up. This was a pretty good recipe that has plenty of room for adjustments or additions. Instead of mayo I used a vidalia onion cucumber-dill salad dressing that I discovered in the produce aisle. I also threw in some lemon juice and parmesan cheese but nothing else since the dressing is seasoned. Yummy!! Next time I would do the same but add bread crumbs for a little crunch. No more boring tilapia!

My husband said to give it a 5 star.  I think I put too much Parmesan cheese on...my bad.  He really loved it.  I also baked it instead of broil...next time I'll do on grill as my broiler doesn't broil evenly.

This was good, I would say make alomst double to parmasian mix. it just didnt seem like that much and i used 5 tilapia steaks. also if you dont care for tilapia i would suggest another white fish becuase it definatly still has that tilapia taste.

This recipe was so easy.  The fish was cooked perfectly and so tender.  I did feel it the taste was a little bland.  Maybe I need to sprinkle some seasoning on the fish before adding the parm mixture.  Still a keeper.

This is a family favorite in our house.  I've made it so many times - impossible to count how many!  I find it's easier to add the parmesan cheese AFTER mixing the mayo, butter, lemon juice and seasonings, but that may be my preference.  We use light Mayo and it works out fine.  Delicious!

This was a very quick & easy recipe.  The overall taste is good, but like others suggested adding some breadcrumbs and fresh chopped parsley really helps bring up a notch.  Also I highly recommend seasoning the fish before broiling.  I just sprinkled on some S&P, but even then it was slightly bland.  So I sprinkled on some cajun seasoning at the table and it made for a delicious fish dish!  I think I'll make this again, but definitely will season the fish liberally before cooking.

I used garlic salt instead of celery salt and pressed Panko crumbs into the cheese mixture before broiling.  It's oily after broiling - I think I will cut back next time on the butter and mayo a little bit.

Easily one of our fave ways to make tilapia.  Even my boyfriend gets into this one, he made it on Christmas for his parents (and he does not cook, EVER).  So good.

This is some seriously good tilapia! I had to scale it all the way back to 2 servings and it was just delicious. I followed the recipe exactly other than that. The cooking times are right on, which is always nice to find! :) In closing... one word: DELISH!

One word...  DELICIOUS!  I also used on chicken.  My family loves it. We are not fish eaters, but I decided we needed it in our diet.  So glad I found this recipe. Great for Fridays during lent.

This topping is very easy and good. My family actually prefers it on boneless skinless chicken breast (I just cook the chicken breast first until just almost cooked through then add the topping and broil just long enough to crisp and brown the topping ). Give it a try, it's really worth it. Thanks for the recipe. UPDATE: tried it with lime juice, cilantro and garlic pepper instead and it was really wonderful.

This recipe is delicious.  After making many times, I started using 1/4 cup parmesan and 1/4 cup panko crumbs.  The panko crumbs help the coating to brown and crisp up a bit more.  We love it!

I didn't have bread crumbs on hand, so I crumbled vegetable-flavored Ritz crackers and used that with the topping and it turned out fine. The parmesan is a nice touch and doesn't taste too cheesy....the flavor lends something subtle that's unplaceable but needed. I put a little bit of soy sauce in the bottom of the pan before broiling. If you're using large, thick filets, it can be difficult to flip them, especially without breaking the fish.

This was overall a decent recipe, but if you use full-fat mayo, beware: you'll only be able to eat half of your portion before it gets too rich. I might make it again, but overall, my household's impression was that it was just okay.

This is the best fish I have ever had.  I norally don't like fish but this was very tasty and not fishy at all.  Half of my 4 kids loved it as well.

This is a simple, tasty recipe.  I make it a lot using Smart Balance butter and low fat mayo.  If we don't have mayo, sour cream is a good substitute.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

This is a super easy, majorly delicious dish.  This will be a weekly meal at our house.  Our children LOVED it & I loved that they were getting their Omega 3's! I did reduced the butter, mayo and cheese by half, it was more than enough!

Absolutely delicious!  My only suggestion is to increase the parmesaen cheese just slightly to help the topping stay in place while bubbling under the broiler.  Thank you for such a delicious recipe!

This is one our all time favorites! If you can find " Basa " fillets, they are even better than Tilapia. I also increase the coating mix by 50% because we love it so. A+ keeper recipe!!

Taste good, but honestly think the mayo is a bit much.  All it really needs is parm, lemon and a little bit of garlic.

This sounded really good but all I had on hand was flounder. I tried it anyway. It was terrific.  I grated my own parmesan cheese. Will definately make this again.  I think it would work on any type of fish. The hubby and kids said it's a keeper.  Thanks for sharing.

Wow! This has got to be the best fish recipe I've come across. I left out the celery salt and lemon juice, added the garlic powder and paprika like others suggested, and used about 1/8 cup of olive oil instead of the butter. This was absolutely delicious. This is definitely now my favorite fish recipe. Thanks!

THE BEST!  I have been making this for a few years now and I am just now leaving a review.  I add Old Bay to the fish and to the topping.  I have also just baked this instead of broiling.  I do not like tilapia, but I can not resist this when I make it! I would give it more stars if I could!!

I didnt like tilapia much before until I tried this recipe! what makes it so tasty is when you broil it with the parmesan on top, it adds a crispy texture and tastes great! I added lots of garlic, sea salt and pepper and extra virgin olive oil. will def make this again, its super easy and healthy (since its baked not fried) *****!

This is the quickest most delicious way I have ever made Tilapia.  The whole family - including two young children loved it.  I go the light mayo and less butter route - still delicious!

Make sure your parmesan mix is well blended and soft or it will be difficult to spread on the fillets. YUM!!! This is a great recipe to get non-fish eaters to eat fish! Delicious.

Not that this recipe needs anymore 5 stars, but i'm contributing mine anyway. My entire family absolutely loves this recipe and none of us are very big fish eaters. Light mayo and a light margarine help reduce some of the fat. thanks for a delicious recipe that's become a staple in our home!

This is the BEST fish I EVER ate!!!  I made it as suggested but with Old Bay Seasoning while broiling, light mayo, and light butter.  Each piece is only about 3 points on Weight Watchers!!  AMAZING.  Thanks for the great recipe!

My husband and I made this once and we were hooked! I love a meal that is healthy, cheap and quick to make. We now make this on a weekly basis (Tilapia Tuesday!)and have made it for friends and family many times. The only change we make is (on the advice of others) to add 1/2 cup of bread crumbs, garlic, paprika and a good amount of red pepper flakes for bite! Thanks for this recipe, Caroline!

Delicious!  I actually used some mahi mahi I was keeping in the freezer instead of tilapia, and it turned out very well.  Following some other reviewers' suggestions, I too added panko crumbs (used same amount of panko as I did parmesan), which formed a lovely crust on the fillets.  Next time, though, I'll cut down on the amount of mayonnaise and probably use just enough to moisten the cheese and breadcrumb mixture.

Absolutely love this recipe! I added red pepper flakes, garlic powder, and paprika (as suggested by other reviewers). Also, I omitted the celery salt since I didn't have that on hand. Decreased the lemon juice to 1 tablespoon and subbed butter for 1 tablespoon of olive oil. This is a excellent recipe for fish! Too good!

So GOOD! I *hate* fish, but I loved this so much! I added some Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning before baking and added a small pressed garlic clove to the topping mixture along with some bread crumbs and chopped fresh basil (I didn't have dried) and also skipped the onion powder, celery salt and black pepper (also didn't have any). I saved some parm and fresh basil for garnish. It was superb, a little tart, but perfect in my opinion to make it taste less "fishy". My BIL of few words even said "Nice!" when he ate it!

My husband is a little skeptical everytime I try something new, but think I might have won him over on this one!  I took some suggestions from other reviewers and added about 1/4 cup bread crumbs and omitted the celery salt, used my mixture of salt, pepper and garlic powder that I always have on hand instead.  Thought it tasted a little too buttery, so will decrease that and will try some of the suggestions made by other reviewers to reduce the fat in this recipe.  I have never made much fish at home, but will definitely be making this again!

This is a great recipe, especially for those who aren't too fond of fish.  I love that it's simle and easy to make, yet it doesn't taste like it.  I've also made this recipe using boneless, skinless chicken breasts and it was wonderful.

My husband, whom I convinced to eat more fish this year, hesitated when I had him pick out a fish at the store.  After I prepared this recipe he said it's really good.  This is amazing as he never compliments any food, and now it's a compliment for fish recipe!!!  Definitely a keeper; the this recipe that is ;-)

This is a superb recipe and I too followed the advise of others by sprinking Old Bay (seam side up first-thanks) and the 1/2 cup of bread crumbs.  I almost burnt this after I added the parmesan topping so for other beginners - don't move away from the oven until you take it out...it's a quick 2min..LOL!

We love it, but I have changed it a little bit.  I don't use celery salt and I use parmesan-romano cheese. I cut the lemon juice by half. I use low-fat mayonase and I also double the amount of onion powder.

I don't the the "fishy" taste of fish, and this topping has helped to make fish tastier for me. Very simple to make and the topping has a very complimentary flavour to tilapia. I'm eager to try it with other types of fish!

This tilapia was SUPER YUMMY! And very easy. I've used mozzarella instead of parmesan cheese and it's very good. The best tilapia I've had.

I give this 4 stars only because it seemed a little frantic to me trying to get everything done without burning/overcooking the fish.  Next time I will make sure I have everything laid out in a more organized fashion before I start.  The end result was quite delicious.

This recipe is a family favorite for fish.  It's good enough as written to have once a week.  Sometimes I like to change it up but I mostly stick with the original.  It''s such a light tasting and flavorful dish.  Very quick to make on a hectic busy night.  I always have leftover mixture, so I store it in my fridge in a vacuumed-sealed half-pint jar making it an even faster weeknight meal.  I line my pan with foil for easy cleanup and broil on high for the recommended time.  I serve it with flavored rice and roasted asparagus. Yummy! Yummy! Yummy!

My husband and I loved this dish!  I followed a tip from another review and sprinkled Italian Flavored Breadcrumbs on top before broiling...YUMMY!!!!  I also threw a bit of garlic salt in and used a bit less celery salt.  Lovely!  A must try!

The flavor of the celery salt/seed (we use seed) goes wonderfully with the tilapia.  Be sure to only soften the butter, not melt it.  (melted butter will cause the sauce to be runnier than you want).  Also, grated parmesan is actually better than shredded for consistency and flavor in this dish.

This is a wonderful and easy to make dish. I am not a traditional fan of fish but I could not wait to make this again. I recommend like some others before to rub the fish with a light coating of olive oil and sprinkle with Old Bay while broiling before the topping.

1/2 C Garlic & Herb Bread Crumbs
1/4 C Butter Softened
3 T Lite Mayo
That's It!  Fantastic
I've tried this recipe the original way and this way with bread crumbs.  Definately like better with bread crumbs.

What can I say?  This is the best recipe I have had for Tilapia.  I cooked it for my family and wow was it good.  I didn't make changes but I did use some of my own techniques. I added some Cajun to it, seasoning salt.  I also added more butter, a little less mayonnaise.  Also I used more paramesean cheese, maybe 1/4 cup more.  More butter to get it thinner of a sauce.  When I cooked the fish I put a dab of oil on the bottom of the pan, (GOOD OLIVE OIL).  3 MINUTES ON EACH SIDE IT GOOD ENOUGH.  Then another 3 minutes, with the sauce at the end.  I also pre seasoned the fish with Seasoning Salt before cooking it.  The flavor on this fish just erupted in the pan.  MMM MMM Good.

UNBELIEVABLE!!! Perfect recipe.  We have never liked fish unless its fried, but were trying to go healthy.  I couldn't believe it when my husband asked, when will we have it again?  I didn't have celery salt so used celery flakes-delicious.

Really exceptionally easy and tasty. Used the old bay seasoning and bread crumbs like the other reviewers. And might also try this recipe with a different type of fish for variety too!

Some in my family are not big fish eaters but everyone loves this recipe.  Easy enough to make on a week night.  Good enough to serve to guests.  I used fresh basil and it was great.

This recipe was so easy.  We have tilapia at least once a week.  It thaws out quickly and my family likes it.  This recipe was a big hit!!  It cooked very quickly and clean up was a snap, because I put foil over my broiler pan.  Yummy!!  I also sprinkled Old Bay Seasoning on the fish prior to broiling.

So quick and easy, and absolutely delicious! I didn't have lemon juice on hand, so I went without, and I added extra Parmesan cheese, but otherwise kept the recipe the same! Tasted even better the next day reheated! I will definitely be making this recipe again!

EXCELLENT!!!!  It is super easy to make!  It is quick to prepare!  No big mess to clean up!  The best part is that it is delicious.  My husband is a fish hater but loved this!!!!  And an extra bonus that my 5 year old and 2 year old ate it all.  A new main staple dish at our home:)

This was really a winner.  I changed and added bread crumbs and then added light sour creme instead of mayo.  I also seasoned the fish prior too cooking.  I have found it is extremely important to season food prior to putting it in the oven.  I also add cayenne pepper, and fresh basil. It was awesome.

This recipe deserves each and every one of these five star ratings! I was really nervous to try this recipe at first (I've never been much of a pro at using the broiler....) but I'm so glad I did. Definately follow shannon:)'s advice when you make this recipe. I paired this with the spaghetti squash I recipe from this site and it makes a delicious, low cal and unique dinner. Give it a try!

I also added lemon juice and substituted rosemary for the basil - much better flavor that was a great accent for the fish.  I used low-cal/fat mayo and butter.  this was wonderful and very easy!

I would give this 10 stars if I could!!!  Fantastic!!  Per other reviewers I did add garlic salt and paprika to the mix.  I also  lightly seasoned the fish with old bay prior to broiling.

YUMMO!  I now fix this regularly, on any type of mild, white fish. You can leave the butter out and use lowfat mayo, and it's still great with way less fat.  Play with the seasonings to get just what you like.  We leave out the celery salt.

It was OK..for fish, which I do not like at all.  My husband didn't care for it because of the parmesan.  Daughter liked it.

I wonder how the topping would be on chicken?

A great dish. Easy to make, done in minutes, delicious and somewhat healthy. I didn't have celery salt so I omitted that but I used all the other ingredients and took other suggestions and sprinkled a bit of Old Bay on both sides of the filets and then added some bread crumbs to the sauce. Paired it up with a parmesan risotto and steamed veggies - Perfect!

I was cooking for myself, and making a pretty thin filet, so I just dumped the sauce on top of the fish and broiled it two or three minutes. It came out great.

This is almost the exact same recipe that I have in an old Mammoth Hospital Auxillary Cookbook, except this one is incomplete.  I tried it as written, but wasn't very tasty compared to the Hospital recipe which includes thinly sliced onions and a dash of worcestershire sauce.

My hunny is not a big fish fan. I made this for him last night and he absolutely loved it! In fact he told me that he would like to have this once a week. I didn't change a thing to this recipe. I only doubled the amount of sauce. IT WAS GREAT!!!!

I just made this dish for dinner and it was great.  It reminded me of something I would get at a restaurant.  My husband (who can be picky) gave it two thumbs up.  Unlike some dishes that look easy but take more time than expected, this one  really is fast.  One modification might be to add some fresh herbs on top as a garnish, just to brighten it up a bit.

Very easy to make for such a tasty result! There's plenty of flavor and it's not a very expensive dinner, either. There was barely enough topping to go around, though, so I'd probably put a little extra of everything in next time so I can generously cover each filet. Careful when broiling, too, one of my filets was pretty thick and didn't cook through the first round, so I left it in for another couple minutes and it started smoking pretty badly. Still tasted good, though.

Awesome variation of a fish that tastes great normally.  Just make sure that you put all of the sauce on top so that you get the full flavor.

This recipe is absolutely wonderful. I am not a huge fan of fish, but I know of its health benefits, so I'm trying to eat it more often.  This recipe was very easy, and takes no time at all to prepare.  I think this is the solution to eating more fish for me and my boyfriend loved it as well!

The flavor is outstanding!  I wanted to make this recipe because of its terrific appeal on this site.  My husand won't eat fish, so, I substituted chicken breast.  I pounded the chicken breast to about 1/4" - 1/2" so it would broil quickly.  The chicken took about 3-4 minutes per side depending on where you live.  We enjoyed this very much, I will be making this again.  Thank You for the recipe.

Very easy and tasty. I pretty much follow the recipe exact. Having read some of the other reviews I do add a touch of bread crumb to make the topping slightly thicker and that helps keep it in place. Once it starts cooking the topping has a tendency to "slip" off. So that helps. I have made this numerous times and it turns out great each time. Very good.

My whole family LOVES this!  I've made it a dozen times using grouper.  I also add the breadcrumbs to the mixture. I omit the basil and add garlic salt instead. YUM! I also make little boats out of aluminum foil to cook the fish in.  This helps keep the topping with the fish.

Very good and will make again but will use a little less of the topping next time.  The (albeit mild) taste of the fish was almost completely lost.

Delicious!  I used fat free mayo and light margarine to lower the fat and calories.  This is a new favorite that I will cook often.

fantastic! I made this dish in a flash one night. I got my veggies ready as the fish baked and served it all up. I was wonderful.

Perfect, tasty & yummy!  I make this often- my toddlers like it as well & also dip their veggies in the sauce.

used less lemon juice, added dash garlic, paprika, bread crumbs & red pepper flakes.

Just OK.  I had huge expectations for this and it wasn't what I was hoping for.  I followed the  recipe exactly and didn't change anything.  Probably would make it again, just not often.  I did try this recipe again with Hake and the family loved it. Perhaps it is Talapia that isn't our thing.

My husband, as expected, peeked over my shoulder and wrinkled his nose.  "Mayonnaise? You're ruining the fish."  I thwapped him with a wooden spoon and chased him out of the kitchen, because I knew he'd like it, and he did.  This is going to become a family favorite, I can tell already, and we're not all that big on fish.  The topping is absolutely fantastic, and tilapia is unfishy enough that it's just delicious, even for people who don't like any fishy flavor.  Try it.  Oh.. we added a touch of white wine to the topping and the bottom of the pan while the fish broiled, and some garlic instead of celery salt.

OMG!!! 
This was SOOOOO delicious. The fish came out moist and flaky and the added dressing on tape was tres, tres delicious. The dish was full of flavors. I am definately making more next time (for extra). I would suggest anyone to make this delicious, simple meal.

This was absolutely delicious.  I used fresh striped bass instead of the tilapia.  And as others recommended, I added 1/2 cup of Panko bread crumbs to the topping.  It was soooo tasty.  My husband loved it and he can be a real pain in the butt when I try new recipes.  Will definately make it again.

Very delicious, VERY QUICK AND EASY.
My changes: I seasoned the fish with garlic salt and oregno when broiling them for the first time.  I also didn't have a broiling pan handy and an aluminum foil covered shallow metal dish worked perfectly.  I would make a little extra sauce next time, if you actually are using 2 lbs of fillets (which we were).

So good! I loved the combination flavor of the parm cheese, celery salt and tilapia. When I want spruced up tilapia I always use this recipe. My husband loved it and couldn't believe it was fish. Thank you.

First time I tasted tilapia.  Wasn't crazy about the fish's taste but the parmesan mixture on top did help the taste.  I think I will try it on another kind of fish.

I wasn't going to rate this because it has SOO many already, but I don't understand wht it is so high!  I made this for dinner last night and it was... there is no other word - disgusting!  I am a HUGE seafood fan, and was very disappointed.  We ended up scraping the "creamy sauce" off and just eating the fish.  Another reviewer put it perfectly - it tastes like funky mayo slathered on perfectly good fish.  Sorry - wasn't a fan.

Glad to find a recipe for my favorite fish.  This is an excellent dish.  Flavours are incredible. Plated the fish with Lemon risotto and a stuffed broiled tomato which made an elegant presentation.  My guests were very pleased with this dinner.  Will not hesitate to serve this fish anytime.

This was good. My husband does not like fish. I made this recipe and then I made a salmon. He said the salmon was too "fishy" but said this recipe he could eat and he does not like fish.

I added 1/4 cup crushed butter crackers to the topping. I think you could have gone a bit less on the cheese. Other then that it was great. Everyone liked it, my 11 year old brother went back for seconds...and thirds before bed time!!

Excellent and super easy. Definitely needs the breads crumbs and garlic powder though. It's a keeper and we'll defintely make it again.

This was awesome!  The only thing that I would do different next time is warm up the sauce before putting it on the fish.  Other than that - perfectomundo!

This recipe is EXCELLENT~My 4 yr old daughter loved it!  It is extremely easy to make and doesn't take much time to cook in the broiler.  Like some of the other readers-I also added 1/4 tsp garlic salt and red cayenne pepper.  I did not have celery salt, but used celery seed instead.  It was perfect.  Rich,creamy,filling and not "fishy" tasting! Will definetly make again for my family! A++++!!!

I have never cooked fish before, too nervous to under or overcook.  This dish came out so delicious I was upset I hadn't bought more tilapia!  Two minutes flip, two minutes flip, top with sauce and broil two more minutes - what could be easier?  I will cook this for everyone I know!

My husband, who was a restaurant manager, told me that this dish reminded him of one of the restaurant dishes. Now THAT's a compliment! What I really love about this recipe is that you get restaurant class flavor in so little time. Thank You

With this many reviews, mine isn't required but I did want to say that I have made this numerous times and what I like about it is that you can switch up the type of spices you use and it always turns out great! It is super quick and super easy.

This is a very good recipe.  The first time I made it, I did not make any changes.  After that time, I have added a little more seasoning, but the recipe as posted is good.

Excellent!  I used cod instead.  Be really really careful when broiling with the sauce on the fish.  It can burn very quickly.  This is a delicious recipe!

I found this recipe and gave it to my mom for us to try. This was the first time we've ever had tilapia.  OMG This recipe is to die for!  My parents and I drooled over it.  The fish was so wonderfully moist and full of flavor.  I can't wait til she makes this again.  I can imagine it will taste good on salmon and chicken as well.  AWESOME!

This was delicious and so easy to make.  I hate mayo, so I was scared to try this, but I did.  You couldn't really even taste it, but it fused the flavors together perfectly.  I didn't use lemon because I had none on hand, and it still came out great!

This was wonderful.  I fixed it just as she said and it was great.  I prepared it for my Mother and Father.  They are tough critics and they thought it was great.  My four and five year olds loved it to.  Reheated well, brought it to work the next day and co-workers were begging for the recipe.  Thanks!!

Absolutely delicious and easy.  I seasoned the fish with Old Bay and started with vein side up like some others recommended.  I also added bread crumbs to the mix and it added a nice texture.  Very moist, not dry at all.  I have a 3 year old and 5 month old and this is quick and easy, the oldest even helped make the mix!  Oh, I also used light mayo and margerine to make a little healthier.  YUMMY!

Very yummy!  I changed the spices around a little to accomodate what I had and had to omit the lemon, but I can't wait to try it as written.  I loved the mayo/butter/parmesan cheese that browned around the edges, mmm.  I think this would be good with some heat, so next time I'll add some red pepper flakes. Thanks for sharing!

Fantastic flavor and so easy.  Next time I will use a bit less fresh lemon juice and double the spices.  I topped with Panko Bread Crumbs for extra crunch.  Thanks for sharing.

I did add some bread crumbs to the cheese mixture.

What a great way to serve fish.   I used haddock instead of tilapia and it worked out perfectly.

Thanks for sharing your recipe....I would definitely make this again.

This recipe was okay. I used fresh parmesan and didn't cut down on the amount so the parmesan was a little overpowering. The fish was nice and moist, though. I took some to my neighbor and she said she loved it so much that she inhaled it.

This was kind of a let down (because of all the good reviews).  I love fish and cook it a lot, but this wasn't very good!  I won't cook this recipe again.

This is sooo good!  My family loves this dish.  The only thing I do differently is add a bit of Old Bay Seasoning to the fish before baking as others have suggested.  Delicious!

HUGE hit at our last dinner party even from people who weren't big fish eaters.  I have even had friends call and ask when we will be having them over for fish again!!!  I didn't make any changes to the recipe - great the way it is.  I highly recommend to any especially if you don't like the "fishy" taste of other fish you will love this.

Easy and delicious.  Everyone (3 adults and 4 picky kids ages 3-11) gobbled it up.  Easy too!  I did omit the celery salt and used about 1 tsp. Old Bay.  I also added about 1/8 c. bread crumbs.  I wrapped them in individual foil packets and cooked on a med-hi grill for 12 minutes (no turning) and it turned out perfect.  About 30 minutes from start to serve.    I wanted a good recipe to wean the kids off fish sticks  and this one was just what I needed.

This recipe rocks!  It is so yummy!!!  BUT, one caveat though.  Too much butter.  It would taste just as good w/ less guilt if you cut the butter amount in half or by a third.  Try it , you won't be disappointed.

This was incredible.  I don't cook very much fish, but will be cooking this more often.  The next time I plan on making more of the sauce and putting extra on the fish because it tasted too good!

Do not change a thing!  This recipe is fantastic just the way it is.  You can however choose to sub Hellman's half-fat mayonnaise & margarine and get the same awesome flavour with a fraction of the calories.

This recipe was easy to make and taste great!  I tried to get a little creative by adding spinich.  I chopped about 1 or 2 cups of spinich, I added it to the sauce.  I then place a bed of spinich under the fish.  This  dish is a keeper.

This was a top-notch recipe.  Even if you're not a big fish lover, like myself, you should definitely try this one.  The rich sauce made this fish spectacular.  Of course, you must love parmesan cheese or this won't work for you.  I used frozen tilapia fillets, defrosted them in the microwave, then cooked them according to the directions for a total of six minutes. Everything else was fixed according to the recipe. Remember that if you're only fixing two pieces of fish, you'll want to make a quarter of the sauce that the recipe calls for. The two pounds listed under the ingredients is equal to eight frozen fillets.

This fish is so good. I can't wait to make this for my husband when he comes back from Iraq. I only used one pound of fish, and sprinkled both sides with some Old Bay seasoning. I kept the parmesan sauce the same as for the two pounds of fish though so we could have it over the brown rice and broccoli that I served with it. I did sprinkle a little paprika over the top of the fish for some color. This is a dish to impress company with though, it tastes like it should be much harder to make.

Excellent recipe for tilapia in a pinch! I had to make several substitutions because I didn't have certain things on hand. Replaced onion salt with garlic powder, dried basil with an herbes de provence mix, and it still turned out great! The next time, I'll try it true to the original and see how it goes. It was moist and delicious! :-)

I don't care much for fish, but my boyfriend loves it, so I try to make it every now and then. This is a great recipe even for people who don't care much for fish. I've made this a few times and would definitely pass it on.

Wow! This made our whitefish and shrimp like restaurant fare! I look forward to trying it on chicken and other fish. I'm not a big fan of fish and shrimp, and this makes it a favorite.I used half shredded parm/romano mix and half powder parm...nice texture.

Yummy!  My husband loves this dish.  Every time I tell him I'm making fish, he asks "Is it tilapia parmesan?"

I thought this was very good, but the fish needs to be lightly seasoned before broiling.

Loved it! I used the combination cheeses mentioned by a previous review, and just watched the "browning" to get the prettiest result. And it was really good.

awesome.  simply awesome and easy!  I've made this a couple times and love it.  I would recommend using a broiler pan so the butter from the sauce doesn't stay on the fish.  Love it!

My girls think this is the best.  They ask me to make it at least once a week.  At first I thought it had to much Lemon, so I tried putting in less.  It just wasn't the same.  The recicip[i is great just the way it is.

My husband and I cooked dinner for my parents and I had the main menu.  This was an absolute HIT!!!  They were bragging about it to their friends for days.  I added backfin crabmeat to the sauce (although lump might have been better) before placing on top of the fish.  They loved it.

This recipe was awesome and I am not a fan of boiled fish, but I love Tilapia. The topping gives it a taste you would expect in a fine restaurant.  I added 3 tbsp of plain breadcrumbs to the topping mixture to prevent it from sliding off the fish while it cooked.

I can see this being a great recipe, I will have to try making it again. I definately used too much parmesan topping. Will try again with a thinner coating of the parmesan.

Okay, my husband loves my cooking - but this is the FIRST time he's wanted to lick the plate!  He LOVED the sauce for the tilapia and was willing to fight the kids for the last piece!  The kids (15-8) liked it too!  Thank you for posting this recipe - it was a definite hit in this household!  The only thing I did differently in this recipe was add some parmesan to the top and broiled until bubbly.

Amazing flavor. Definately make more sauce and add a bit of Italian bread crumbs so it isn't quite so juicy.

used parm, dried parsley, garlic powder,mayo, I can't believe it's not butter light and pepper for the sauce. Lightly sprinkled adobo on both sides of fillets about an hour before cooking. We LOVED it! Hubby suggested the same sauce be used with crab for a dip, trying that next. YUM-O

This was EXCELLENT. I don't make fish very often because I'm afraid of overcooking. I followed the cooking time exactly and fish was moist and tender. I didn't use the measurements exactly as I "eyeball". I did use less butter and added some seasoned breadcrumbs to the mixture. Also seasoned the fish with Old Bay before broiling.

Everytime I've made this, I've had nothing but raves from friends and family. I eyeball the seasonings, always try to use fresh instead of dried basil and add lots more black pepper. I have used this recipe for tilapia, basa, sole and cod. Definitely a great, slightly cheesy, flavorful recipe for any white fish!

Very Good.  A little of my topping melted off but it was still fantastic.  Added a little extra salt and added cayenne pepper for a nice kick.

This was a wonderful recipe!  I didn't make any changes (but I did season the fish first) and it was delicious.  The only thing I will change next time is to add some bread crumbs like suggested to keep the topping from melting off.  This is definitely a keeper!

I found this to be pretty good. I doubled the sauce and used a little less lemon juice. I think the Tilapia could use some seasoning, but of what seasoning I am not sure. This recipe is good and it has even greater potential.

My husband raved about this recipe for days!!  I think it is a new favorite for him.  I have made it many times and the first I felt it was too parmy.  I have played around with it and found that I love adding paprika to the mixture and instead of lemon juice I sometimes add lime juice.  I generally make it with long grain rice and there are never any leftovers!!

My husband and I HATED this.  We had never had tilapia, but like mahi mahi, sea bass, and grouper, so we gave tilapia a try.
We took 2 bites, and refused to eat anymore, which rarely happens with us.
I ate a bowl of cereal instead.

This recipe is awesome!! I didn't change a thing.  My husband said it was some of the best fish he has ever tasted. Since my fillets were slightly frozen, I did have to broil lower for a few extra minutes. It still turned out nice and flakey.

MY SISTER STOPPED BY ON HER WAY HOME FROM EATING OUT AND HAD SOME, SHE LOVED IT TOO! JUST A GREAT WAY TO MAKE FISH! NOT MUCH TIME SPENT MAKING IT, FROM START TO FINISH WAS ABOUT 20 MINUTES WHILE PREPARING THE REST OF THE MEAL AS WELL! GOOOOD!!!

My husband LOVED this recipe.  I thought it was good but would not use so much mayo next time.  My kids liked it OK but would rather have lemon/butter tilapia.

I hate fish...that was until I tried this recipe.  I used orange roughy instead of the tilapia, and it was fantastic.  I followed the suggestions about seasoning the fillets with Old Bay, but I don't think it needed it.  The parmesan gave enough salt flavoring on it's own.  This recipe has definitely found a spot in my recipe box.  I can't wait to make it again!!

As other reviews have suggested, I doubled the sauce to use on vegetables
eaten with the fish.  I’d definitely make this again except I wouldn’t double
to amount of parmesan cheese.  We found doubling the cheese a bit too rich.
The recipe is very easy to follow and make.

This was awesome! I love sauces and if you do too you will love this dish! I used low-fat mayo to cut down calories and fat. On the side I had a simple arugula salad with evoo and lemon. Delicious. Enjoy!

Made these for Christmas Eve dinner. This was my first time making any kind of fish (I love fish, just never made it!) and it came out great. I had to broil it a little longer on both sides though. The cheesy topping was awesome. I'll definitely make this again!

really good flavor.  I was roasting veggies in the oven so I cooked the fish in a pan sprayed with oil to reduce fat first.  Cook a couple minutes each side and then I broiled it with the cheese mixture.  I didn't measure anything but I put all the ingredients in and added some flavored breadcrumbs.  I may try it without the butter next time, I don't know if its really necessary for the flavor because of the cheese.

This is a wonderful dish I have made it several times. The only changes I made were using garlic powder instead of celery salt and I season my fish before broiling on each side with Emeril's Fish Seasoning. This is such a pretty dish and so good!! My 2 year old, 7 year old and 12 year old gobble it up, I have made it for several dinner parties and EVERYONE (even anti fish people) DEVOURED IT!!!!!!

this was an excellent recipe. the sauce was great. i only used 2TBS of mayo instead of 3 and the results were still tasty. i didn't have any tilapia fillets on hand so i used whiting. it tasted great with this fish too.

I had this recipe printed out for 2 weeks. Every time my husband asked what was for dinner and I said "Broiled Tilapia Parmesean" he would beg me not to make it and end up buying pizza or something else to avoid it. 

Finally one evening I convinced him to give it a chance. (He's not big on fish if you haven't figured that out!) He ended up really liking it. When I make tilapia from now on I plan to use this recipe. 

My 8 year old and 5 year old both ate it, too.

Note: If you have a gas oven like I do, you may not exactly get that nice browned and broiled look. Don't worry - it still tastes good.

Went well with fresh steamed green beans.

Made this for dinner last night.  I enjoyed it very much; my husband could take it or leave it.  I omitted the celery salt and added paprika.  I also added some garlic powder as well as minced garlic.  Next time, I would also cut back on the butter. I would certainly make this for company!

I wanted to try this recipe because I live near the coast where the fish is great, and there were so many good reviews.  I'm not sure what I did wrong, but the topping on my fish slid down the sides while under the broiler.  The taste was incredible, but the sauce didn't adhere to the fish they way it probably should have...I will definitely try this again!

This is the first time I have rated a dish but my family loved it so much I felt I should.  Added bread crumbs otherwise followed the directions.  I'm not a fish eater but loved this dish.  My 10 and 14yr olds want it every week. Excellent!

Like everybody else said.....it's AWESOME!!!  I didn't make any changes and it turned out great.  I know whenever we make fish again, this is the way we will go.
Thanks for the great recipe!

This was awsome. My husband said "that's a keeper"  This was simple to prepare and wonderful with white jasmine rice and mix veggies. Hats off to the chef.

I made this for my family and everyone absolutely loved it.  Being that we all love lemon flavor, I added an extra tablespoon of lemon juice, but everything else I did as directed and it was wonderful!  Definitely a keeper and a family favorite!

GREAT recipe! DH and I already love tilapia, so it was nice to find a new way to make it. I added garlic powder to the sauce and I probably need to get it closer to the broiler (didn't come out brown/crispy), but I will DEFINITELY make this again.

I love Tilapia, and I am aways excited to find new ways to prepare it. I am from the south, so they think everything should be fried to have any flavor.  I do love fried foods, but I like expanding my horizons, this was simple and delicious....

Absolutely wonderful!  I've never found a fish recipe that my fish-hating husband would eat, but he actually LOVED this one!  The topping really was a hit. Next time we're going to add some crushed red pepper to give it some heat.  Thanks for a great keeper!

This was very good!   Very easy to make.  The only thing I did different was I added a little cayenne pepper. My 10-yr old is very picky and he even had seconds so I will definitely make this again.

This was really easy and quick to make.  My 10 year old loved it and was unhappy that I had only made half the recipe for the 4 of us.  The recipe didn't specify exactly what type of parmesan cheese so I used some shredded that I had on hand because it's not quite as "pungent" and the canned, grated kind.  Other than that I made the recipe exactly as printed (except that I halfed it) and it turned out just right.

Mmmmm...was so good. Used freshly grated parmesan and garlic powder because I did not have any onion powder or celery salt and it still came out flavorful. Will make it again soon!

Fantastic and so easy. No prepping, really quick to make - followed the recipe exactly as is. Perfect. My very picky husband who doesn't eat fish loved it too - thank you so much, I'll make this again and again! Went great with the spinach saute receipe w/portobello mushrooms -also on this site.

I am only giving this a 3 because my husband liked it. I personally do not care for fish, but, in an effort to eat healthier, I gave it a shot. Not only did I not like the fish (not surprising), I thought the sauce was over spiced and had a wierd texture.

Yum Yum Yum .. the best fish I've ever made!  I'm a bit sensitive to the flavor of mayonnaise, so I think I'll use 2T instead of 3T (yeild 8).  I was cooking 6 fillets for my boyfriend and myself, I thought it was a bit much, but he raved and raved over it and is looking forward to tonights leftovers.  THANKS!

I make tilapia all the time, so when I saw this popular recipe, I had to see what the buzz is all about.  This recipe is fast, easy, tasty and looks gorgeous on a bed of rice or pasta.  There's also a lot of room to play around with the spices.  I almost don't want to go back to the other ways I used to make tilapia!

One more review......I just had to get on the list. My family loved this recipe. I have been preparing Tilapia for a few years now,it's a mild fish that all 5 of my kids will eat. This recipe made it even easier. Fast and fabulous. Thanks.

I read the reviews, and was still skeptical, however, one bite of this dish proved me sooooo wrong!!! My husband was also skeptical because he just had food poisoning from fish not too long ago, but this really was as easy and as tastey as it said!!!

I have found a good fish recipe, at long last!  This was terrific.  I didn't have onion powder, so I used Garlic Powder, and I also used low fat mayo, and I don't think it made a bit of difference.  Don't skimp on FRESH lemon juice, I think it makes it.  We had NO leftovers.

Tasty & Easy.  I added garlic powder, paprika and red pepper to the recipe as others had suggested.  Next time will cut the lemon in half, it was a bit too tart.  Also, added a little bit of bread crumbs which helped the mixture stay in place.  It's important to resist the urge to put the topping on super thick, otherwise it really overwhelms the fish.

I hate fish, but decided to try this because fish is healthy food for you.  It was so quick and simple to make and I actually liked it.  Not a very fishy taste at all.  The topping really added flavor.  I would add some salt or some kind of seasoning to the fish before broiling.  My husband and 9 year old daughter LOVED it and said they would absolutely eat it again.  As a fish hater, I thought it was good and would eat it again.

Absolutely fantastic & so easy. Have made twice now. 2nd time I doubled the mixture on top and broiled fish on individual fajita pans so as it cooked and slid off a bit it wasn't lost.

This was delicious.  My family does not particularly like fish and they all loved this and asked for seconds.  The only substitution I made was garlic salt for the celery salt.  It was outstanding!

Made this last night and it will become a staple in my home. I didn't have Celery Salt so I used Old Bay Seasoning instead. Also prior to broiling the fish I seasoned it with Adobo w/Cumin and fresh ground black pepper and as was suggested by another memeber broiled the darker side first - seasoned it the same on the other. I broiled it for 3 minutes on each side then 2.5 minutes once I added the parmesan mixture. Quick, easy, taste's good - nuff said!

I was pleasantly surprised with this recipe.  It was incredibly easy and DELICIOUS!!  I am not a fish lover but I know it is good for me.  The topping gave it a great flavor and it did not taste fishy at all.  I made just the lemon juice and dry seasonings for my husband and he loved it too.  I will definitely make this again!

Excellent use of talapia, the sauce sorta dripped off but I scraped it off the pan and placed it back on the fish.  My husband even liked this and he hates "baked" fish.

This recipe was fantastic! The texture of the fish was perfect; the flavor was impecable, (although I suggest that you add a pinch of salt or two); and the preparation was quick and easy. The only other thing I might suggest is that you double the sauce recipe because there was not enough to suit my tastes; but other than that, this tilapia was wonderful!

This is a fantastic tilapia recipe!  I don't love fish, so adding parmesan and butter makes it much tastier for me.  This one cooks quickly, so keep an eye on it.  This is good with a light pasta dish...very elegant.

This was very good. It was easy to make, and even though we did not have celery salt, and not exactly enough cheese, it still turned out great. Most tilapia recipies have stuff on them that is really overpowering, but this goes great with the mild flavor of tilapia.

Yum! This is the best recipe for tilapia. It tastes great and is filling without making you feel like you overate. Our family loves it!

Great and easy recipe. My daughter who doen't like fish ate and liked it. I used fresh parmesan cheese and maybe a little less butter as the sauce was a little to runny to stay on the fish.

I made this for dinner last night, and completely screwed it up.  I didn't cook the tilapia for long enough before I added the sauce, and then I didn't have enough sauce anyway.  Needless to say, we ordered pizza.  However, I saved the fish, and rebroiled it after scraping the sauce off.  I remade the sauce and did everything correctly.  DELICIOUS!!!  I LOVED IT!!  I hate fish so much, but this is delicious.  I added garlic salt, and used celery seed, instead of celery salt.  Definitely in my rotation, thank you for not making fish so intimidating!

Absolutely delicious and so quick and easy - will definitely make again. One small change, didn't have any celery salt so used organic garlic salt instead - worked beautifully. Thanks for the recipe!

I baked this one Sunday for myself and my 4yr old and 2yr old. This was an excellent recipe! We all love Tilapia, but have never eaten it any other way than fried. Even after it was all gone, they both kept asking for more. We loved it. I will definitely be trying this one again and again and again!

WOW!!!  I have tried several recipes lately with phenomenal reviews and ended up slightly disappointed with good meals but not exceptional.  Well, this one lives up to all the wonderful reviews.  My husband stated that if this were on a menu at a restaurant, he would order it.  This is the highest compliment b/c when we go out to dinner he is a steak and potato guy.

Maybe my tilapia fillets were too thin, but I followed the recipe exactly & it came out a tad dry.  It cooked a lot faster than the recipe called for, & I had my broiler on "low."  I may try again with a different, meatier fish.

Terrific fish recipe!  I didn't have onion powder or celery salt, so I substituted with a bit of season salt.  I followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  Turned out beautifully!!

This is a wonderful recipe. I changed the celery salt with celery seed. I didn't have mayo, so I used light miracle whip instead. It still tasted incredible.

I made this last night and it was fabulous!  My husband wasn't expecting much but he loved it.  I had only 4 filets so I have extra cheese mixture left over and saved it so I can make this again.  I didn't change a thing.  Very good!

Yummy recipe! Neither my husband nor I are huge fish lovers. In fact, we tried Salmon a few weeks ago and didn't like it all, so I was really hesitant to try another fish. However, we both really enjoyed it, and I know we'll make it again.

I love how I have most everything on hand, and it's especially fast and easy if you have frozen tilapia on hand as well. I didn't have onion powder, and I only had celery seed, so I used garlic salt as a compromise...it still was yummy. I quartered the recipe and just make 2 fillets, and they turned out fine.

We served it with honey glazed carrots and crescent rolls.

If I could give this 10 stars, I would. It is absolutely the best way to make tilapia and the easiest!! Thx for sharing the recipe -- it is wonderfully delicious and something I can throw together at the last minute with ingredients on hand if I have tilapia in the freezer.

I'll never make tilapia any other way again. So creamy and flavorful... yum! Easy and so quick to prepare and the results taste like an expensive seafood dinner. The topping reminds me of tartar sauce. Delicious!

Yum-ee.  This is the best fish I've made in a while.  I added a little more lemon juice, a dash of cayenne pepper and a bit of white wine.  The fish is very delicate and doesn't need to be cooked long which is awesome when you have a hungry family waiting.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

Great.  It can be made very quickly.  Didn't have any celery salt so I just threw in a sprinkle of kosher salt.  I'll pick up some celery salt and try it next time.  Also sprinkled some bread crumbs on top of the mexture.  Tastes good.

I used this on haddock instead of tilapia (not overly adventurous when it comes to fish!) and it was GREAT!!! Husband and teenager deemed it a keeper - made exactly as recipe stated (with the change of fish) and wouldn't change a thing. Except for trying to find a lower salt parmesan - do they make it?!

This recipe has become a favorite at our house. I cook the fish on a rimmed cookie sheet (lined with foil) instead of a broiler pan - works much better!

Awesome recipe! I also substituted the celery salt with celery seed and added about a quarter teaspoon of ground red pepper as well. It was quick to prepare and quick to cook and it made for a great lunch today! Thanks!

Tasty!  The only change I would make is to wrap the pan with aluminum foil so that the cheese won't melt to the bottom of the broiler pan.  Next time I will serve this with fettucini alfredo.

I could not find a fish that was mild enough for me with good taste and this recipe has surely done that for me!  I didnt have celery seed so just added some garlic powder per previous reviews.  I also didnt read all the directions and put the sauce on before broiling on both side.  NOt as nice presentations as it should have been but SO tasty!  Will be making everytime I have fish!

This recipe is awesome! It was actually the first time I attempted to make fish and it came out perfect. I did end up accidentally having double the amount of sauce because I only had a lb of fish... but I think that made it even better. Definitely a keeper.

This was good, but to me, nothing special.  It was surprising that the fish was a bit on the bland side.  I guess I prefer to cook tilapia with butter mixed with fresh roasted garlic and sundried tomatoes and I don't broil it.  Guess I will go back to doing it that way.  This is still a good, easy recipe, but I probably won't make it again.

This was very very delicious! The only thing is that I had to move the rack down a little bit because I put it close to the broiler as stated and everything began to smoke rather badly and set off the smoke detector...probably because my oven is brand-new.  Will definitely be making this again!

I tried it with Miracle Whip; I think mayonnaise would work better, as the Miracle Whip flavor dominates.  To the toppings, I recommend adding garlic powder, lemon pepper, bread crumbs.  Also, I found the topping to be too thick to spread easily over the fish, so I would also add a little milk for smoothness. I think I would also use 1/2 the broiling time instead of 1/3 at the end to get the cheese/bread crumb mixture crunchier.

This was excellent - restaurant quality.  It was very rich (butter and mayo), and I made several unanticipated modifications that really made this depart from the original (but still fabulous).  Once I committed myself to the recipe I realized 1) I didn't have Parmesan, and 2) I had some imitation crab I needed to use up.  So I got creative - I whipped up a mayo/butter/seasoning mixture based on the recipe (favored toward Cajun/Old Bay Seasoning, plus pepper, garlic, and celery seed) and mixed it in with the imitation crab.  I then layered sliced Havarti over the crab mixture over the tilapia, and convection baked.  I served with roasted cubed baby reds flavored with olive oil, rosemary and dill, and sprinkled with bleu cheese crumbles; plus a side of broccoli.  

What a fantastic meal!  I look forward to making this recipe as set forth (plus the bread crumbs - that will make a welcome addition to the texture), but it was a great foundation to modify when I realized I didn't have everything!

This is very good and easy to make.  I lighten it up by using non fat Miracle Whip instead of mayo.  My Mother-in-Law gave me a rare compliment about this dish.  I make it quite frequently in the winter.

I don't think this recipe needs anyone else to talk about how great it was.. but oh my goodness was this great!  My boyfriend isn't crazy about fish but LOVED this dish and was begging for more!  I'd love to try this dressing on chicken too - it seems versatile enough.  Thx again!

This has got to be one of the best recipes I have ever tried.  My husband was still raving about it this morning.  Thank you so much!  I think next time I will make extra of the sauce to have over noodles as well.  I served it with tossed salad and instant Four Cheese Mashed Potatoes.  Quick and very easy to prepare.

Incredible!  I made this recipe exactly as given and to say it was a hit would be an understatement.  Where I live, tilapia is a very reasonably priced fish, this recipe really turns it into a delightful main dish.  I have also used the mixture with chicken breasts, baked in the oven, they were a huge hit as well.  I have also added frozen drained spinach and sauted mushrooms, then added to the tilapia or the chicken it makes a nice addition and a bit of a change is nice when a dish is in "heavy demand".

this was amazing! it was incredibly easy to do, and i think you could mess with the ingredients a little and it would still be good. we followed the recipe exactly but used low fat versions of everything, and it was perfect. can't wait to make it again!

My first try with tilapia and probably my last... I don't like the idea of a farm-raised fish but decided to buy some because I really wanted to try this recipe. I guess tilapia is just not my cup of tea! However, the parmesan topping is simply TERRIFIC! Will use it on cod, hake or even chicken!

My husband loved this.I thought this was good but it seemed like something was missing. Maybe adding a little bread crumbs would give the fish a nice,little crust. Nothing to to steal the really good flavor it already has. I think I didn't put this fish close enough to the broiler,which took a few minuetes longer to cook,which you definetly don't want to do. Overcooking the fish will definetly kill this recipe. Will try this again soon.

AMAZING!  Neither my husband or I are big fish eaters, but are trying to add some in due to the nutritional value.  When I served this, he said, "This is better than chicken"...  I will definitely be making this gain.  I cut the sauce in half, which was just about perfect for 2 fillets.

I loved the salty and sour flavors of the parmesan and lemon juice - my kids did not.  My fish was very thin so next time I'll cook on one side, flip, spread coating, and finish broiling on the other side.

Love this recipe - a definate keeper.  It received a BIG happy face sticker!  I sized the recipe down because it was just my husband and me and after the first bite I wished I would have done more than 2 filets. The only thing I will do different next time is to check the doneness before putting on the cheese mixture for the final couple of minutes of broiling.  My filets were a little different in thickness and one needed a bit more time to get flakey so the Parmesan cheese mixture got browner than it probably should have - but it was still yummy.

OMG this was the best fish I have ever had. I broiled it in a pyrex dish so when the cheese melted it would stay on the fish. I also added garlic powder and Mrs. Dash. I doubled the cheese sauce because I ended up with a bunch of little pieces of fish and wanted to make sure I had enough. Use shredded cheese. Seriously the best fish I have ever had.

the fish came out nice and moist. i expected the parmesan topping to come out a bit crispier but i figured it didn't because i baked it, not broil it. the mixture was great though. i think it would go well with chix or pork, too. would use again-but broil it, not bake.

WOW!! Followed the recipe to a tee. This was awesome! Very rich and creamy which paired well with the light, delicate fish. The cooking time was perfect. Sprinkled a little parmesan right on top before broiling. Served with wild rice and sauteed yellow squash. Will make this easy and inexpensive recipe again and again.

Wow wee! This is very good and very, very quick and easy. I even broiled the fish partially frozen and it worked out great. This is a good, mild fish dish that won't stink up the house. I will definately make again.

My family finds tilapia a bit bland but because it is reasonably priced and good for us, I buy it anyhow.  So this recipe was great because it added a nice pungent flavor to the fish.  Cooks up in a jiffy and gets nice and crusty on top.

Great yet simple!  Exactly what I was looking for.  In place of the celery salt and onion powder, I used garlic salt...which also worked.  I have added this to my "favorite recipe's" book.

This is one of our favorite tilapia recipes.  I use less butter, more lemon juice and light mayo and it still tastes great.  My fiancee has only been eating fish for a year or two and he regularly requests this dish.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was a delicious topping for talapia.  I didn't add the butter to the topping, just because I used butter in my other dishes and didn't want to use too much overall, and I added Mrs Dash Italian blend seasoning instead of just basil.  I also baked mine, because with 3 little kids running around I didn't want to be opening and closing the oven door with the broiler on.  It had a great flavor, and next time I'll use the broil method to get it all nice and crispy.  Thanks!

Both thumbs up from the family!  I didn't have quite enough parmesan so I substituted some bread crumbs for half of parmesan.  Also, I used "Tones" Salmon & Seafood Seasoning (heavily, love the stuff) because I didn't have the individual seasonings called for in the recipe.  Very tasty!  Will use on other fish also.

AWESOME!! A friend recommended this to me--I had never cooked fresh fish before so I was nervous.  Very fast, easy & an incredible flavor.  I think I will make a bit more of the parm. mixture next time, just because it is so good.  (Husband loved it too!)

Very good, family loved it.  I didn't use Tilapia, and I'm not really sure what type of fish I did used.  I am living in France and don't know the French names for fish yet.  However, I picked out a white fish that looked similar to Tilapia.  Bottom line, if you don't have Tilapia, any delicate white fish will work great in this recipe!  Thanks.

This had everyone at my dinner table going "mmmm," and "mmm hmm!" all throughout dinner. I never measure ingredients and was missing the celery salt. Just throwing the basic ingredients together it was great, and hard to screw up. I served it with the Cauliflower and Broccoli Bake submitted by Rachael (and wild rice) which complimented it perfectly in case you are trying to please picky kids. My 7, 3 and 19 month old all cleaned they're plates which is rare. Hubby loved it too, who was skeptical about the tilapia at first.

Wow, this is fabulous!  I have always fried Tilapia and am trying to eat healthier so I was very nervous to try a new recipe.  This is wonderful.  All the flavor without the calories and fat!  Thank you so much!

It is not that exciting of a recipe however I got my kids to eat it (4 stars).  You have to be willing to take a completly healthy piece of fish and turn it fatty. It's like making baked chicken into fried chicken.

WOW!!! What can I say about this recipe that hasn't already been said?!?!? It was great....I mean, people licking their plates great! It was also very forgiving. I did not have any onion powder or celery salt, so I finely grated some fresh onion and celery and used regular salt...OUTSTANDING!!! You can't go wrong with this recipe. The only thing I may do differently next time is to lightly season the tilapia maybe with a little seasoned salt and pepper. This recipe is absolutely wonderful! Kudos to Caroline C for sharing....This one's a keeper! WHOOOO HOOOO!!!

I hate cooking fish because I always tend to overcook it.  But this was a snap and perfect in the broiler. My boyfriend and I loved this and it was so quick and easy to make!  I didn't have parmesean on hand so I used some shredded romano cheese and it was divine!  I look forward to making this again.

I started making this recipe quite a while back when there were less than 100 reviews. Look at it now! It's fantastic, beyond words. The absolute best fish recipe around. My 12 year old asks for it, my 4 year old gobbles it up, and my husband complains that it "never makes enough"! We are going to try it now with another type of fish, since many frozen tilapia filets are quite thin. My suggestion, do not alter this recipe until you have tried it in its original form!

Me and a group of guys made this for a cooking competition and I think the ladies all fell in love with us.  We didn't change a thing.  It was sooo tender and juicy.  It serves really well with the Orzo with Parmesan and Basil by Dodie Pajer (on this site).  Thanks for this recipe Phoebe!!

Unbelievably easy and quick, with such outstanding flavour! This recipe took my kids off fish sticks for good. I have made this twice; once cooking it exactly as recipe states (perfection!) and once by placing the tilapia filets in a baking dish, spreading the parmesan coating on top, then baking at 350 for about 20 minutes and it was just as delicious. The broiled method is quicker, though, and gives the dish a beautiful golden colour. Serve this to all fish-haters, and they will be converted forever! The best, Phoebe! Thank-you!

I tasted the sauce before adding it to the fish and thought it was too tangy... but something magical happened in the oven because this turned out soooo good!  Very quick and easy.

This was so good!  I've been wanting to try this recipe forever but was waiting until I found some good fresh tilapia.  I used light mayo and fresh basil.  When I broiled this, some of the topping melted off, but it could have been my fault because I prepared it about an hour before I needed it, and stuck it in the fridge.  It was still yummy though!  Make sure to grease your foil, because I didn't, and the delicate fish broke apart a little when I tried to flip it.  Served this with Oven Roasted Potatoes (from this site) and steamed broccoli.  This is a very good, easy recipe I will make often!

This is so easy and tastes so good!  It is really quick too, preperation time and cook time.  I generally cook the fish almost all the way by baking it for about 8 minutes at 425, then broil it for 2 minutes.  I always serve it with parmesan noodles and a salad.

I'm not sure what went wrong in making this, but all of the cheese topping melted off of the fish while under the broiler.  Had it stayed on, I'm sure it would've been better.  Not sure if I should've used something other than grated parmesan cheese.

Just look at the number of people who rated/reviewed this recipe.  That alone should tell you something.  This is one of the easiest, tastiest fish dishes I've ever had. It's great on top of some salad greens, on rice, or just by itself. It's great after work when I don't have a lot of time and it uses ingredients commonly found in the kitchen so there are no last minute special trips to the store.  Great stuff!  I'm having it tonight!

I can't believe how good this was. The combination of food sounded weird to me but since it had gotton so many rave reviews I thought I'd give it a try. DELICIOUS!!!!
Oh, I didn't have celery salt so I used a little table salt instead.

This recipe was quick and easy.  I had a fish seasoning that seemed to contain all of the spices together, but I added extra basil on my own.  I also salted the Broiler before I put the fish on to add a little crispiness to it.  It turned out perfectly!

My husband was a drooling maniac, he enjoyed every bite and complimented me a lot!!!  He'll certainly want me to make this again and again.  I definately will.

What a fantastic recipe and it was so simple. I made this last night and my husband kept saying that it tasted like something he would order at a restaurant. Very pleased. Great presentation too - I'll have to take a picture next time. I may try some white wine in the sauce next time or perhaps add some small capers. I will definitely make this again and again.

I followed this recipe exactly and it came out absolutely marvelous.  Everyone in my family loves this dish and we've had it often.  It is so very easy and I love that I can whip this up in a matter of minutes.  It is wonderful served with fresh steamed asparagus and a buttery rice pilaf.  I've also served it on a bed of fresh sautéed spinach and it was delicious.  Thank you Pheobe!

We just finished our dinner and it was wonderful! Used red snapper instead of tilapia and it turned out great! I omitted the celery salt (since I didn't have any) and added one clove of minced garlic.  I seasoned the fish with salt and pepper before broiling the first side. Served it with pan seared new potatoes, seasoned green beans, and fresh sliced tomatoes.  YUMMY!  Thank you Phoebe; I will be using this often!

This has become one of our favorite fish recipes! I marinate the fish in a little lemon juice for a couple of hours before broiling. I omit the celery salt, and use garlic powder instead of onion powder.

This was fast and excellent.  I served it with the Vegetable Couscous and a spinach & strawberry salad.  I used less than a pound of tilapia though, so if I make it with the full 2 pounds of tilapia, I would double the parmesian mixture.

I haven't been compelled to write a review until now, but this is a fantastic recipe.  It's virtually goof-proof, makes a great presentation, and is the most family-friendly non-fried fish dish we've ever had.

I love it because it's super quick and easy, and we all love it because it's delicious.  Wish I had more recipes of this caliber!

Tried this recipe for the first time, substituting grated onion, crushed garlic,lime juice and chopped basil leaves which had been frozen. Allowed the mixture to sit for a while before using and the flavour was truly remarkable. Will be making this recipe till my dying day!

This recipe was awesome!!!  I did the fish on the grill instead of the broiler and it turned out GREAT!!!  My boyfriend, who never really raves about anything, took one bite and said how wonderful it tasted.  He requested that I make it again this week!  It tasted like something you would get in a resturant.

Outstanding.  My husband said it something his mother would never be able to cook (but if she had this recipe, she could!)  That, my friends, is the ultimate compliment.  I served the fish over three-cheese ravioli, and used fresh basil instead of dried.

What can I say that hasn't already been said about this recipe? It really is as good as everyone says. I used about 1 tsp of chopped fresh basil instead of dried, and garlic powder for celery salt (like many others), and it came out fantastic. I had about half a pound of tilapia and half a pound perch, so I just used both, and I actually thought the perch tasted even better...it practically melted in my mouth. I think I might melt the butter completely next time when making the sauce, as it seemed a bit "thick" and difficult to spread evenly over the filets. I also made a full recipe of sauce, even though I only had a pound of fish, and it left just enough to mix in excellently with some steamed rice as a side dish. The sauce is fantastic - you definitely won't mind having extra if you make more than the recommended amount.

VERY quick and VERY tasty. The kids even liked it since the tilapia isn't overly "fishy" and they love cheese.
I did use fresh basil and 1 clove of garlic, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.

Because I don't like 90% of the fish recipes I try, I made this just for my husband. What a mistake! It was DELICIOUS! The cheesy topping is so tasty, and the tilapia isn't overwhelmingly fishy. I will definitely make this again - for both of us! I think the topping would work with cod too. Great recipe! Thanks, Phoebe!

Tilapia is a nice fish, but this recipe doesn't enhance it in any way if you ask me.  I've used much better recipes.  I found the consistency of the topping a bit odd, not to mention difficult to apply to already hot fish.  The flavor is okay, but nothing special.  I might make this again for a really quick, simple meal for myself, but I would never make this for guests.

This was great!  The Tilapia came out really good and I believe my boyfriend really enjoyed it.  I really liked the way the sauce was creamy and cheesy.  The only thing I would change is next time I will season the fish more before I place it in the oven to give it an even better taste!

SUPERB!  I followed the recipe totally, but I added 1 tablespoon chopped garlic to the mixture.  We all LOVED this recipe and will DEFINITELY make this again!  NEXT time, I think I will try adding 2 tablespoons of minced garlic, the juice of one whole lemon and maybe even slice up a fresh jalapeno to add to the mixture.  All of this AND a low carb diet friendly dish!

This has to be one of the most outstanding tasting dinner!  It actually tasted as if I were dining in a 5 star seafood restaurant and it was so easy to make.  Instead of using the dried basil I used fresh basil and also used freshly grated parmesan cheese.  I was so thrilled with this recipe I had to call my mom and tell her to come over one night so she can taste it!

A friend recommended this to me and it was SOOOOO delicious!! I cant rave enough about it and I'm not a huge fish person!  My kids even ate it!  I used fresh grated parmesan and it gave the fish a crusty cheesy outer layer.  This will be a regular for us!

This was excellent.  I didn't have any onion powder, but that didn't seem to make a difference.  I used a pinch of celery salt instead of the recommended 1/8 teaspoon, and I added a pinch of garlic.  It had a wonderful flavor.

This is the most awesome fish recipe I have ever tried!  I like a little more spice so I added 1 t basil, 1 t pepper, 1 t onion powder and 1/4 t celery salt.  Also, I used frozen filets so I added an extra two minutes to broil--turned out perfect!  Thank you for an exceptional recipe, Phoebe!

We eat a lot of fish so I am always looking for recipes that call for different ingredient combinations so that our fish dinners while frequent taste different but yummmy.  This is a great recipe that requires very little work and the result is fantastic. Thanks Phoebe.

I love this recipe! Great flavor, easy, and fast. Just make sure you use aluminum foil in your broiler for the fish and turn up the sides of the foil to make a well so the butter mixture does not drip off the edges. This makes for extremely fast clean up. I used alakan cod instead of tilapia, and it was great!! I served it with Linguini with Broccoli and Red Peppers (from this site), a loaf of crusty Italian bread, and a green salad.

This was pretty good.  The topping needed a little 'zing' to it though.  It also could use some breadcrumbs to make it stick to the fish a little better.

This is a great recipe.  I baked the fish first because I tend to burn food when I broil it.  Then I added the topping and turned the oven up to broil for the last couple of minutes.  Excellent!  We loved it.

I have made this awsome recipe three times now and it is easy and delicious. Can't get any better than that. I didn't have enought parmesan cheese, so I used Asiago to fill in and it was wonderful either way. I make extra, it even tastes good the next day for lunch. Thanks Phoebe for a wonderful easy recipe. I'm going to try it with Salmon and chicken next...

This is absolutely delicious! Had some frozen tilapia, ran it under cold water for a few minutes to thaw and in under 15 minutes had a gourmet meal! Used less butter to save some calories and it was awesome.

I do a variation on this recipe and this is the only way my husband will eat fish. I bake mine in aluminum foil and then take it off to brown the top at the last minute, sometimes using sour cream in the mix as well..

First let me say that we "loved" the sauce.  Very yummy.  I have never been a fan of broiled meat or fish but we went ahead and tried this receipe.  The sauce did not brown - it just ran off and down the sides of the fish and all wound up on the pan.  Also, the texture of the fish made us unsure as to whether it was fully cooked or not - so we ended up throwing it in the microwave to make sure it was cooked through.  I will make this again, but I think I would try breading the fish and baking and then broiling when the sauce is placed on last.  I'll let you know how it goes.

This dish is sooo good!  I use lowfat mayo but you wouldn't know it!  The sauce is so rich and creamy.  The sauce is also delicious on salmon.

It is easy to prepare and the ingredients are usually on hand. My whole family loved this,even my two very picky daughters. The parmasian gives it a unique qnd welcome flavor.

I thought this was outstanding. I did add some onion powder and garlic powder. I had keylime juice on hand and used it instead to rave reviews. I actually was made to make it again the very next night because my husband loved it so much! We've tried it with Basa also and enjoyed it as much. I've made it four times now with consistant results and you won't believe how easy and quick it is. Thank You Phoebe!

Really good.  I use yogurt instead of mayo as I hate mayo.  Turns out great everytime, although it is slightly oily.

My husband liked this one, the kids said they didn't like the fish.  I am just funny about fish with cheese, I guess and it was very salty.  Will probably not make again.  It was very easy to do though - I had never cooked tilapia and didn't have any trouble.

TO DIE FOR!!  I also made the sauce without the lemon - put it in a pan with 2 pounded chicken breasts - and sauteed on medium low - 5-10 minutes then flipped the breasts for another 5-10 minutes...AWESOME!   The only thing I would changed slightly is to cut the butter in half - 1/4 cup is too much!

This coating was delicous. Can be used on different kinds of fish. I used lime juice-didn't have lemon. My 8 year old son who is ever so picky ate a piece-so that's saying a lot!

This was really good and a nice change of pace for ways to cook fish. I was skeptical about the taste of the combined ingredients but the sauce tasted great once the flavors blended and it broiled to a golden brown on the fish.  I think I will add some sliced or slivered almonds because we like our food to be very textured.  I will definitely make this again.

I made this recipe exactly as written, except used bottled lemon juice because I did not have a lemon on hand (used about 1 1/2 tbsp), and had only 1.5 pounds of fish - it was EXCELLENT! Makes me hungry for it just writing this!

Simple and excellent.  Watch the broiler closely, because the topping will burn quickly.

I made this for dinner tonight, and it really is very good, and very easy, but the cheese sauce is a bit gooey and overpowering.  I'll make this again but add maybe 1/3 of the parmesan cheese blend.  Five stars for the ease, though.  I had dinner on the table in 15 minutes!

Very good and so easy to make.  I did not make any changes to recipe and was very pleased.  I did have quite a bit of the topping leftover - but can use it on cooked broccoli, mixed veggies or pasta.

I make this recipe all the time now. My kids LOVE it! I usually add a little garlic powder to it, and it's GREAT! For a REAL quick dinner, I serve it with broccoli salad and rice. My kids who hate fish, love this when I serve it, it's the only way I can get them to eat fish.

I tried this recipe last night and OMG it is EXCELLENT!!!! Very flavorful and quick to make. I made a few adjustments based off the reviews I read. I used only 1 tablespoon of the lemon juice, I didn't have any celery salt, so I used garlic powder instead. The other thing I did was to season my Tilapia with Old Bay seasoning and coat with olive oil spray as others suggested. Also, I used fresh Parmesan cheese for my cheese mixture. The fish was succulent and juicy and it only took a minute to melt the sauce on the top. I laid the fish on a bed of butter noodles with a side of mixed veggies and me and my boyfriend tore it to pieces. I will definitely use this recipe again and again!!!! THANKS Phoebe

I am totally impressed.  This fish was excellent!  It is hard to believe something so simple could have so much flavor.  I will be making this again and again, possibly with chicken cutlets or veal as well as fish.

I make Tilapia often, and try different recipes each time. This one was a real winner with my family -- they said the best to date! I was in a hurry, and the "no marinating process" made it super quick and easy! I didn't even bother with the 2 step process of broiling first before spreading the sauce -- I coated both sides with the sauce and simply broiled for about 5 minutes on each side.  Thanks!

Made this one twice in one week it was so good.  My husband, a fish lover thought it was delicious.  I, on the other hand, do not really like fish and yet I also loved this recipe.  Really quick and easy to make too...thanks!

this was pretty tasty. It was a little difficult to spread the butter/cheese mixture over the hot fish, and then my broiler was a little smoky too. but it turned out okay. Used the leftover butter/cheese mixture the next night on some bread I put in the toaster oven and it was delicious too.

I never had tilapia before this recipe.  I really enjoyed this a lot.  I cooked the fish on the stove top on my cuisinart skillet with oil and butter then added the topping and put under the broiler for about 2 mintutes until brown.   I will definitely try this recipe on all types of fish.

This is FANTASTIC!! I "tolerate" fish because I know it's good for me--but I absolutely loved this. I even ate the leftovers when they were cold. I did add a little garlic  baked it.

Not only did the fish come out perfect, but the sauce was a huge hit. I also made the sauce the next night and put over chicken breasts. Heavenly!

Wonderful dish - 10 minutes from door to plate!  I have my routine down...mix up topping with whatever spices I have on hand, throw fish under broiler, throw cups of baby spinach in a pan with garlic and red pepper flakes for an equally quick sidedish, flip and slap the topping on the fish, and there's STILL time to pour myself a nice glass of wine.  Plus it's cheap, and makes the roommates come out of their rooms when they smell it!

Had to add my comments as well. As another reviewer wrote, I had 1 lb. of tilapia on hand (in the freezer), and wasn't sure how to prepare it. Came to Allrecipes.com and as usual, was rewarded with another great dish! Tasty, easy to prepare and I had all ingredients on hand. Used fresh parmesan. My husband, who is NOT a fish lover, said it was the best he'd had and went back for seconds. My 4 year old daughter, while not bowled over, ate it without complaint. Now I know what to do with tilapia or other fresh fish. Delicious! Thanks Phoebe!

Great recipe! I had sea bass & porgy's - no idea what to do with the porgy's. Both types of fish came out excellent!I also put a little fresh garlic on fillets & brushed on butter & lemon before broiling. Will use over & over again!! Can't wait to try on tilapia! Thank you!!

My family loves this recipe. They expect me to make it every time we have tilapia or any other fish. I used fresh grated parmesan, I think that makes a huge difference in the creamy texture of the sauce. It smells so good when its cooking. Yummy Yummy

I thought this was just okay and my husband did not care for it.  I did not use celery salt, but otherwise I followed the recipe.  The recipe sounds so good, we really like fish and this dish has so many rave reviews that I am really surprised that my results were not so good. Not something I will make again.

Two words...Yummy and easy!!!!!

I am not much of a fish fan, but this was great!!!  It was very quick and easy and a good recipe to make with what is on hand.  Next time I think I'll try it with fresh basil.

We used some fresh grouper instead of tilapia.  FH thought it was very tasty.  I was not as impressed.  I did do some substituting which may have affected the taste..I used Miracle Whip instead of mayo and garlic salt instead of celery salt (didn't have it).  I thought that with the mayo, lemon juice, and parmasean, it was awfully tangy.  It was edible though.

Tilapia is not our favorite fish in this household, but I am giving this recipe five stars because of the ease of preparation, as well as the tasty parmesan topping that made this meal quite good.  Thanks Phoebe!

Delicious! This was my first time having tilapia but it was on sale 2 for 1 so I bought some. I added about a tablespoon of honey mustard to mine and my boyfriend LOVED it as did I. No leftovers...nuf said!

Hi Phoebe,  This was the best Tilapia recipe I have ever tried and it is THE BEST.  The only thing I did was to add more freshly grated Parmesan cheese, otherwise, I did not change a thing.  I will definitely make this often. Thanks for sharing your recipe.  Iret

Easy and delicious.  I made the whole sauce recipe for less than a pound of tilapia (4 fillets) and it was more than enough.  This recipe will be a weeknight staple.  It is also very low carb for those low-carb dieters.

Between my DH and myself, we give this 4.5 stars.
We liked it very much, although our kids scraped the sauce off of theirs!  (They don't know what's good for them!)  I subbed fresh dill for the basil, and the taste was wonderful.  I can't wait to try with different fish and with fresh basil.
Thanks Phoebe!

Family-friendly fish! Even my kids ate it. My only concern is that it was a little high in fat -- I cut back a little on the butter and used light mayonnaise  and it was still delicious. Also made it once using dill and garlic salt in place of the other seasonings. Will definitely try it on other types of fish, as well.

Easy to make!! I had dinner ready in 15 minutes! My daughter always balks when we have fish, but she actually liked this and even commented that it was pretty good.  My husband and I both like it.  I've made it 4 times so far and haven't deviated from the recipe - it's perfect the way it is (actually I didn't have any onion powder so I just left it out).  Not sure my family will eat broiled fish any other way now!!

I reviewed the ingredients and was a little sceptical about making this but all the other reviews convinced me to give it a try.  I had a dinner party for six and EVERYONE just raved about the dish.  It comes out extremely tasty and tender.  This is a must try that is a good alternative to Salmon.

I changed this a bit.  I omitted the butter and added a bit more light mayo.  I also added finely chopped sun dried tomatoes (in oil, drained).  I spread it on the fish and bake at 400.  Fast, easy, delicious.  A weeknight staple.

Absolutely delicious! I was amazed by the simplicity of the recipe. Very easy to prepare and very quick. My 4 and 3 year-old kids really like this dish.

The flavor turned out great.  I added a few things like paprika and onion powder. I didn't have basil so I used oregano.  I also used a good amount of Old Bay. I followed another reviewer's suggestion and added a 1/2 cup bread crumbs.  It made the mixture really thick. Was it supposed to? Another reviewer said hers ended up swimming in butter....hmm.  My fish themselves were not dry, but the breading(?) was very dry. The flavor saved it and my family ate it, so I guess it's a win!

Very good, thank you for this recipe! I love all things seafood and am always looking for fun new fish recipes. The only thing I changed is garlic powder instead of celery salt because I didn't have it. :)

The only change I made was to cut all the quantities down to make it for just me - and it was fabulous!   The fish just melted in my mouth and the blend of flavors was incredible.   Too bad I couldn't give it more than 5 stars!

I made this last night. I went through reviews and decided to make some changes. I replaced butter and mayo with olive oil only just a little bit and I added garlic and onion powder as well as paprika. The Mayo ended up not being necessary and the whole family loved this recipe. I will make again.

This is a quick and fabulous topping. It lets the great flavor of the fish come through but, at the same time, adds a rich cheesy flavor. They pair perfectly. I put about 3-4 teaspoons on each fillet. Didn’t have mayo. Miracle Whip worked great.

Not terrible, but there are definitely tastier, healthier, and simpler recipes for parmesan tilapia.  All the mayonnaise, butter, and cheese seemed like more of a mask than a compliment.

This is my go-to recipe for Talapia (thank you)!!!  The only note I would add is that under my broiler, this takes a few minutes less to cook...so keep an eye on it.  Absolutely delicious!

As written it is good, but too mayonnaise-y tasting. For our tastes, we cut the mayo down to 1 tbsp and fill in with plain Greek yogurt.

used 1/3 bread crumbs and 2/3 Parmesan, used smoked paprika instead of celery salt, lime juice instead or lemon. only broil 2 min per side at 500 degree broil, then add topping and broil 2 min more
2nd version-  used half bread crumbs and half Parmesan , used lemon juice,equal parts light mayo and smart balance margarine. cooked it in the toaster oven/air fryer. very tasty!

My husband whined every time I mentioned the tilapia in the freezer. I made this recipe and he loved it! Great mix of flavor! I only used celery seed because I didn’t have salt and Miracle Whip because I didn’t have mayo. Delicious!! It’s a keeper!

I have used plain yogurt in place of the mayo, but either way it comes out delish and my family eats it up every time, either way.  Its such a quick and easy dish!  It is a week night staple in our house with some quick rice and a steamed veggie.

This recipe was great - one of my favorite tilapia dishes. I should note that if you are dealing with thicker filets, you should add about 2mins to the final broil (assuming it is not burning). When we reheated the leftovers under the broiler, it was even more delicious/better texture than the first night.

COMBINED this recipe with Lemon Panko Crusted Salmon . The bread crumbs and extra seasoning greatly enhanced the flavor and texture.
8 servings- Parsley 2t, Thyme 2t, Lem Pepper 2t, garlic pdr 1/2t, lemon zest 1/2t
I prefer broiling for speed and browning.
served over rice with salad on side and canned peaches
Family loved it!

Very good base for a recipe.  I wanted to make it as written the first time, but I will kick up the seasoning a bit the next time I make it.  At the very least it could use some garlic.

Possibly my favorite recipe. So simple, so quick, easy cleanup and hands down one of the best fish recipes I’ve had anywhere - even my pickiest eater finishes it, and the others all want seconds even if not usual fish fans.

So easy and delicious. Two of my favourite things. I didn’t have butter but margarine was very good too. I also added Old Bay Seasoning.

very tasty - a nice moisture layer on the fish ( I used halibut) with a crunch on top. I made close to recipe except I blended abt. 1 TBS of soft butter with the mayo parm mixture.  I baked for 15 mins at 400, then just quickly, 2 mins, broiled to crisp panko I used for the topping.

Since I was only cooking for two I cut the recipe in half and half again.  I added additional seasonings (seasoned salt, Mrs. Dashs, etc., my own special blend). It was absolutely delicious! Will make the complete recipe for a family dinner, I'm sure they're going to love it. Going to try different types of fish and other seafood and see how it works out.

Didn't have tilapia, so I made with Swai and added garlic powder. Had parmesan asparagus and white rice for sides. Dinner was amazing. Can't wait to make recipe again, but with chicken. Yummy!!

My husband LOVED this recipe.  I didn't change a thing - did it exactly as directed and it was fabulous.  In fact, he liked it so much, a few days later I did the exact same thing, only with chicken breasts instead of the fish.  He raved about that, too.  Bravo, Phoebe - you have a real hit on your hands!

I started with the original recipe, and added 1/2 cup bread crumbs, paprika, and red pepper flakes per Shannon's review :)...also used fresh garlic and fresh basil in the mixture.  My fillets were quite thick, so I broiled them about twice as long as recommended, but they were moist and flavorful!  I will definitely keep this recipe on hand.

This was delicious!  I am always tentative cooking fish but this was EASY!  I followed other suggestions and seasoned with Old Bay before broiling, and added the breadcrumbs to the topping.  I did 4 inches from top on HI broil, 2-1/2 minutes on the first side, 2 mins second side, 2 mins after topping.  WOW this was good.  Topping was crunchy,  not creamy though, maybe due to the added breadcrumbs, but we liked the contrasting texture.

I followed so many previous reviewers' advice and went with Shannon's advice, in addition to the original recipe. I added Tony's Garlic and Parmesan seasoning along with some paprika, parsley, and gluten free panko crumbs. Because I know my kids, I doubled the amount and really created a crust for the top that they loved. The tilapia itself came out perfectly with the 6 minutes for almost all of the fillets. Just one was a little bigger and took an additional 30 seconds.

I have not made this yet but I am familiar with the recipe. BUT. Why does the cook time say 10 minutes,  when the recipe comes to 6 to 8 minutes. Then it states to not overcook.????

We really liked this dish. The only thing I didn’t differently was to season the filets w creole seasoning before baking (I didn’t have Old Bay), and I added Panko to the mixture and then sprinkled more on top. The Panko gave the topping a little more of a brown, crispy crust.

I might mix in bread crumbs the next time to add a bit more crunch.  The flavor was quite good however.  these are ingredients I always have on hand.

O-m-g for such a simple recipe this was surprisingly flavourful! Using mayo on fish isn't exactly a new idea but with the addition of Parmesan this was amazing. Made exactly as written and will absolutely make it again.

I fixed this, but because I do not like cooking quick/fast, I baked it at 400 degrees for 12 minutes, then I did High Broil for 3 minutes. Came out perfect . The seasoning compliment each other great.

Basic meal, but so incredibly fattening.  I don't think the flavor was worth all of the calories.  Served with rice and broccoli.  Family liked it, but since I knew what was in it, it made me cringe knowing how much fat was involved.

Tilapia is worse than carp.  For years we enjoyed this recipe, until we learned where the fish came from.  In fairness to the recipe, it is truly tasty.  A true testimony that if you cover any food with parmesan cheese it is delicious. 

If you investigate what farmed tilapia eat, you will step away from this vegetarian fish species. Most farmed tilapia come from a tank below a bunch of farmed chickens.  The chickens  in the water, the vegan tilapia are glad to eat the by-product.  They grow big enough on chicken excrement and then they are sent to your local grocery store.  Fun fact, you are eating a fish made of chicken .  Yum!  Cover a piece of dog  in enough parmesan cheese it might be edible.  But for our family, no thanks.  We prefer fish that eat other fish.  Farm raised tilapia is gross.

Unfortunately, I don't know much about my stove's broiler.  I do not have a broiler pan.  Therefore, I baked it for 5 min on each side at 375 degrees and then put the topping and baked until brown.  Totally fie.

It's very good, quick, and easy. Next time I make it, I'll cut down on the parmesan cheese. Too heavy of that flavor for such a light fish.

I used 2 Tbsp butter, but otherwise the same.  Each tilapia filet ended up being 2.5 WW smartpoints.  Definitely a win!  This is my family's favorite meal!  My girls ask me to make it even when we have guests!  (they're 6, 4 and 1).

This was okay.  The topping helped the Tilapia but it still tasted pretty fishy.  I added breadcrumbs and some additional spices (per Shannon's review) and would recommend following her advice.

I had frozen tilapia so broiled them from frozen. 2 minutes each side flipping twice until cooked.  Then I spread a thin layer of the Parmesan mix and browned as directed. The leftover Parmesan sauce became a delicious dip for the fish!

Our family loves this recipe! And it makes for a quick weeknight dinner. Sometimes I just partially cook the tilapia in advance and cover with the cheese mixture and keep in the fridge until dinner time. Then I just broil it real quick and dinner is ready!

This was really, really good! I cut the recipe in half and made as stated except I didn't have any onion powder or celery salt (now on my grocery list for next time) so I used garlic powder and some Lawry's Season Salt. And I used fresh chopped basil. I guess I should have had the rack closer to the top of the oven toward the top coils because it didn't brown but still was awesome. My husband and I both scraped everything off our plates and he said how tender and flakey it was.  Will definitely make again and again. Thanks Phoebe!

My daughter and I really liked this.  I think it's actually my favorite way to cook cod (I didn't have tilapia).  However, my husband and son both hated it.  Mostly rating it a 3 so that I remember not to fix it again.  But my honest, personal review is that it's great and if it were just me, I'd rate it 5 stars.

Tilapia can be pretty bland, but this is one of the better recipes I’ve ever had for it. We substitute the mayonnaise or Greek yogurt, and it taste just as good.

This was the best tilapia I've had (and my husband loved it too)! It was tender and flavorful but also quick and easy! The only thing I added to the parmesan mixture was dill weed & garlic powder. Made Italian peas and dilled rice on the side. Definitely will make again!

I quartered all of the topping ingredients, and used 1/2 lb. of swai (similar to tilapia in texture and taste). Absolutely delicious! This will be one of my go-to fish recipes.

This was pretty good.  I thought it was a little salty when finished and would limit adding salt to the filets before broiling.  Also, my finished topping did not crust as expected and the final outcome was not as expected, a little messy.  But i will try again. Thanks for recipe!

Sprinkle fish with Old Bay before broiling and to the topping add some garlic powder, paprika and dried onion flakes for crunch. Still gluten free and delicious.

I have not yet made it.  I am writing to say that an acid, such as the citric acid from the lemon juice, will dissolve some of the aluminum.  Thus, you will ingesting some aluminum if it is used.  Parchment paper is a better choice since this is not an issue.

Tried this bc if the reviews.. tasted much better than expected! Even used the shaker Parmesan bc I forgot to buy fresh. Not big into fish yet very satisfying, great recipe for a less/ lighter fishy taste.. Very easy, usually have all these ingredients on hand, and quick! The whole family liked it. Will def make again.

The whole family loved it - so easy and flavorful!
Didn't have celery salt so salted the fillets before I broiled them; used celery seed instead in the mixture.  Didn't have onion powder so substituted garlic powder.  This recipe will definitely be in our meal rotation now since we have fish a couple times a week...

Great recipe!  I only used a pound of tilapia (instead of rhe recommended two pounds) but did not cut the cheese sauce ingredients in half (totally my bad!)  Sauce wasn't as crispy / firm as I had hoped.  Will try cutting cheese sauce ingredients in half next time and adding a few bread crumbs to make the sauce a little firmer,  crispy. Can't wait to make it again!

Simple enough for the kids to enjoy, flavorful enough to make the husband happy. We don't love mayo, so I substituted ranch and it turned out fabulously. Erred on the side of 3 minutes per "round" in the oven and wasn't overdone at all. 2 minutes each probably wouldn't have been cooked through. Will definitely make this recipe again. It's tough to beat a 15

My husband really enjoyed the dish. The flavor was good but I may try it with Mahi instead since the tilapia was a bit too soft for my taste.

I think this needed a bit more seasonings. Other than that it was good.

Excellent! I have a favorite tilapia recipe that I make all the time, but decided to change things up tonight.  This one is a definite winner and will be part of my regular rotation! Lots of flavor, and easy to make.  My filet was on the large side, so I cooked it 4 mins per side before adding the topping. Came out super juicy and delicious!

We've made this recipe sooo much that we've literally overdone it and can't make it again for a while. I like to cook it for a bit longer because I don't like a "wet" texture of fish. Really good to eat with white rice and I put sirraccha  hot sauce all over it.

Next time I make it, maybe I will be able to get a picture but it disappeared too quickly! This recipe is super simple and delicious! I used some slightly different seasonings to my family's preference but other than that, I followed the recipe. I will probably put this dish into my rotation of regular meals. Definitely recommend it.

This is so delicious! And really easy to make. Its a fast recipe if your short on time. I'm definitely adding this to my favorites. The only thing I did different was that I used a garlic salt free herb mix instead of the onion and celery seasoning.

Thank you for this recipe  This was such a wonderful dish!  My family said over and over 'this is so good'!  I did read through reviews. I made four adjustments. I used cooking spray on the tin foil, used celery seed instead of celery salt, added garlic powder, and salted both sides of tilapia and sprinkled them with old bay (lightly).  Next time I will add more parmesan cheese and I think that it will be even better.

This was great& easy! I followed reviewers& added more seasoning. I found the 2.5 min on each side & then the 2 min after adding the topping was perfect. This was moist. I followed the suggestion to spray oil on each side & on the foil so it did not stick at all. I had one pound of tilapia & used only 1 tbsp of butter& I added a small amount of panko bread crumbs. Delicious! The presentation was lovely!

Very good. Lisa, Riley and Jake liked it.  Thicker pieces so took a bit longer under the broiler.  Did flip no do on both sides before adding the topping.  Used Old Bay seasoning before adding the topping.

I enjoyed how quickly this cooked up. I keep frozen tilapia on hand and can defrost it in 20 minutes running warm water on it. Then broiling it for 6-9 minutes total, that's my kind of fast dinner. I enjoyed it with some roasted potatoes, I have found cheese sauces go great with potatoes or rice. Easy and flavorful.

This was soooooo good and EASY!   I added the bread crumbs and did a quick dusting of the seafood seasoning before I put it in the oven, per the reviews....    This is going to be a weekly dish this summer!!!  Thanks!

I used sesame seeds and sesame salt together and 3/4 of my family loved it. We've been having the Tilapia Scampi once a week for a while and I decided to change it up a bit. Glad I landed on this recipe. It was a good, relatively quick supper!

I use celery seed rather than celery salt and half the amt of butter. Also use light mayo. I also add 1/2 tsp. paprika, 1/4 tsp. garlic powder  And seasoned fish with old bay before adding topping. Also added 1/8 cup of breadcrumbs in the mix. Yummy

First time to ever review a recipe.. this is SO good!  I've prepared this fish in a variety of ways  but my husband loved this recipe... he actually asked if there were leftovers the next night. :) Will definitely make it again.

This was so delicious!  My husband and teenagers all loved it too.  Many compliments.  Based on other people's recommendations,  I cut the lemon in half and added some breadcrumbs to the topping. It came out flaky, crispy and savory. I did 2 minutes on each side and I think it would have been overdone if I did it any longer. Served it with spinach tortellini and a Caesar salad. I highly recommend it even if you don't like fish that much.

Quick. Easy. Full of flavor. Delicious!!! My type of recipe. The only "changes" I made to the recipe was I added Tony Chachere's Creole seasoning, didn't use the celery salt (didn't have any), and I added a tad bit of grated Parmesan cheese into my mixture. I will definitely make this again!

Didn't have the celery salt.  Husband was hungry for Spanish rice, so used Pampered Chef Sun Dried Tomato Seasoning in place.  It was perfect!  Highly recommend.  Went very well with the rice, too.

No changes at all. This is one of the fastest meals to get on the table and my kids absolutely love it! Which is something because they have never really liked fish that much.  If I tell them we are having parmesan tilapia they are like, "YEAH!"

The kids were unsuccessful when they tried to dislike it. It was a hit. We used tilapia and the topping somewhat slid off when cooking. I haven't looked at all the reviews, but I'm wondering about using cod, or shredding the fish in a 9 in. pan and covering it with the sauce. We'll try it again.

I made a few adjustments - used cod instead of tilapia. I cut back on the cheese and added seasoned breadcrumbs to the parmesan mixture with more breadcrumbs on top.  Very good! Will make again

My husband really liked this fish. This was the first time I had made any kind of fish besides fish sticks for my family. I am not a huge fan of fish but this tasted pretty good. The cheese sauce really enhanced the fish. We used light mayo with olive oil and a parmesean romano cheese mix

I love this recipe!

The first time that I made it I used tilapia and followed the directions to a tee and it was delicious!

Over the years, I have made it my own by substituting local Cod, fresh basil and cayenne pepper.  It's on the menu tonight.

This was amazingly flavorful and very easy to make. I served it with rice, fried green tomatoes, and homemade coleslaw.

The only change I made was substituting hummus for mayo.

I didn't have quite enough mayo so I used about a healthy teaspoonful (the eating kind, not the measuring kind) of tartar sauce. I was using squeeze mayo and measuring with a metal serving? spoon (the one bigger than the teaspoon). Like many folks, I often just guesstimate when measuring many recipes.

I kept everything else the same. OMG, this is so much better than any other way I've made tilapia. A KEEPER!!!!

I love making this dish. I use just about any seasoning. I have found the best to be a little old bay and red pepper  on the fish and Mediterranean blend in the mayo mix above. That was so good even my family that doesn't like tilapia ate it and I cooked it for myself!

We loved it...hubby said it is a keeper!  I did add a bit of dill to sauce, and sprinkled some fine bread crumbs for final broil.  Sauce would be great for chicken, pork, veggies too!

This recipe is truly amazing!  My husband and I love tilapia, and I love to try new sauces for it.  This one is by far our favorite.   Once I add the sauce, I bake it a little longer than suggested because we both like things browned and a bit crispy.  This is once for my permanent recipe book for sure!

I know it's a fish recipe, but I made it w/chicken and it was AMAZING! I pounded the breasts flat & baked with the mixture on each at 425 degrees for 20 min. Not even a bite leftover.

Great texture and creamy goodness. Little prep time, and simpLe.  I went a little light on the fresh basil for fear of a strong taste.  Next time, I will use what the recipe recommends.  Even with my mistake, it was still a very good dish. My husband loved it, too.

It's really good, just be sure not to bake it on tinfoil, because that makes it taste metallic.

I enjoyed making this dish and will definitely be making it again. I made it for my family this summer. I have to say that it is now one of my favorite ways to make tilapia.  I added one thing to the recipe... finely chopped onions. I knew that there was already onion powder in the recipe, but I love the flavor and crunch onions can add to any dish.

We loved it! I added 1/4 tsp garlic powder and parsley and sprinkled the fish with Old Bay first.  I added 1/4 tsp Cayenne and red pepper to my husband's and my portions. It was very good. We all loved it!

This was my first attempt at broiling, and it turned out pretty good.  I used a large cod fillet, I was barely able to turn it once and didn't attempt a second turn, just put the sauce over the second side. I added more seasonings as other reviewers recommend: Old Bay, paprika, garlic powder, and crushed red pepper, and the flavor with all of this was very good. I did also add in some panko bread crumbs because the mixture was so runny it wouldn't have stayed on the fish. The fish was perfectly cooked and moist, I'll definitely do this again.

This I a great recipe.  It was easy to make, ingredients on hand and just the right amount of seasoning to be flavorful.   I'm not a huge fan of tilapia however this recipe made it delicious.  I did not alter any steps.

I followed the recipe but added breadcrumbs as one reviewer mentioned as well as some paprika and garlic powder. I also used a lot less butter (a tablespoon).
It came out great-my husband devoured it. Served it over some arugula with wild rice and yams with walnuts. I would definitely make this again. Thanks for the recipe!

I've made this twice now and both times I didn't have mayo so I used a little heavy whipping cream. It made it super fluffy and creamy! Other than that I made it as the recipe suggested and each time has been delicious! Very quick dinner but yummy all the same. I make it with asparagus as the side  with honey and garlic powder drizzled on top. Delicious!

My picky daughter would give this 10 stars! I didn't make enough fish the first time that I made this and had to make a second batch. It is so quick to prepare that it was not an issue. I did not have celery salt and it did not matter.  I added garlic salt the next time I prepared this but it really did not matter. Great either way

The first time I made this I followed the recipe to a "tee". Hubby and 21yr old liked it. Second time I "tweeked " it. Used orange roughy instead of tilapia and sprinkled old bay on both sides before broiling. Also added a "pinch" of fresh parmigiana on top. Hubby and son raved! Now they want me to try this sauce on chicken.The orange roughy was a better fish, was firmer and not as watery as tilapia.

I usually buy the Frozen prepared Tilapia from Costco but this time bought the plain Tilapia to save a little money.  I wanted to make something special but not much trouble. 
Oh my Goodness!!!  What a pleasant surprise!  Did not take much time to make and delicious!  Will make again and again and again, I am sure.

I wasn't a fan of the lemon.  But the Tilapia was great cooked under the broiler!  I could see doing this with other sauces!

I seasoned more, s&p old bay & garlic powder, because I like
A lot of flavor and this fish can be bland.  It was easy and a nice 
Week night dinner.  Not special, but not bad.  I will make it again, throw on some capers maybe.

First time I made this. Just the two of us so I only used three pieces of Tilapia, so obviously I downsized the ingredients.  the fish was done to perfection.

Great recipe IF (and only if) you use a fish other than Tilapia.  I've used Drum, Redfish,  Sea Bream, etc.  I just despise Tilapia.  Just about any other fish (except salmon) would work.

Oh. My. GOSH!! Let me just start by saying- I really dislike seafood. I have tried different recipes for years in hopes of just stomaching the stuff. THIS recipe was outstanding. Almost tasted like fried chicken on the edges that were crispy. My husband is more than thrilled that I finally found a fish recipe that I like- the kiddos gobbled it down, too! A++

The original recipe was too fatty for my family, so I reduced the butter to 2 Tbsp, subbed the mayo for 1/4 cup of plain Greek yogurt, cut the lemon juice to 1 Tbsp, and kept the rest of the spices the same.  It was sooooo yummy!  I didn't want to stop eating it!

I have made this twice and will be making it again tonight.  I am not much of a Mayo person, so I use Franks Sweet Vidalia Onion Salad Dressing.  It offers a great taste and it is always a hit with my lady.

This recipe was so easy and fast! Definitely a keeper. I served it with sautéed asparagus and a simple orzo and rice dish with Parmesan cheese. Totally doable as a weeknight dinner.

What a great way to make tilapia.  My daughter, who doesn't care for fish, absolutely loves this dish.  Thanks for the recipe!

Loved this idea, I HATE FISH, this actually tasted good. Hubby liked it too. The only thing I added was a sprinkle of bread crumbs on top of the cheese sauce before it went in the oven to thicken up the coating a bit! This will now be a weekly meal in our home!

I substituted Miracle Whip for the mayo, and didn't add the celery salt or the onion powder. I added dill instead, and it was fantastic!

This is a wonderful recipe, just about perfect.  It's easy, tastes great, doesn't overwhelm the fish.  Thanks so much. I made it exactly to the recipe and don't regret it.  Would not change a thing.

I'm surprised I liked this! I don't usually make anything that calls for mayonnaise but I wanted to try something different. This was very tasty and a nice change from our usual fish marinades. I will be making this again.

This recipe is awesome. Made it and it was scrumptious!! I did as one reviewer had suggested, and put some breadcrumbs into the mixture to help it hold. It worked. The flavors were amazing and great aroma too. Definitely making this part of our home menu.

This recipe is exquisite !!! Our whole family thoroughly enjoyed it. I am not very good at preparing fish, but this recipe made it extremely easy, so much so it's almost impossible to mess it up. The only thing it needs is more sauce...mmm. I doubled the sauce, and everyone agreed that it was so good I should triple it next time! I served it over jasmine rice with a mixed greens salad. I made this EXACTLY as stated in the recipe, and it was amazing, I can say with certainty.

I dont even like fish but this made my mouth water. So flavourful and delicious. I followed some of the other reviews and sprinkled old bay before broiling then sprinkled some more on the other side before returning it to the oven. Thank you for the recipe.

We love this recipe. And so easy! The only problem I've run into is if I soften the butter too much, the parmesan mixture on top kind of all melts off and becomes too runny. But if the ratios are right, it comes out perfect. Thank you!

I've been making this several times a month for years .  I always make the topping as written for a perfectly seasoned piece of fish and found it holds up with light mayo just as well as full fat.   I generally use frozen cod instead of tilapia  so I generally bake for about 15-20 minutes depending on the size and thickness of the filet then take it out to add the topping and switch the oven to broil.   Two minutes later, a delicious fish dinner for six or for one.  Truly a 30 minute easy peasy dinner .   Line your sheet pan with foil and the only dish you will have to wash is the bowl used to mix the cheese topping.

I haven't tried this recipe with the celery salt, most of the time replacing it with seasoned salt. I've been making a healthier version of this with 1 1/2 tbsp Miracle Whip instead of mayo, and I've also added a nice twist! Add a bit more lemon to the bowl and don't add the parm cheese to the mixture. Cover the fish with the sauce after broiling and then cover the fish in parmesan cheese and Panko breadcrumbs!! Adds wonderful texture and a crispier fish!

I used snapper , had that in the freezer as I don't eat tilapia or farmed raised fish, but other than that I kept to the recipe. I also used the foil which made the cleanup very easy, plus I kept the leftovers in it and just heated it back up in the foil pouch.  The only thing to remember is if you are using thicker filets than tilapia, like I did, make sure you have enough sauce made. The sauce is very tasty and so easy to make.

Just follow the directions, don't ad-lib ( I usually do). I did use Asiago cheese instead of Parmesan but that's because I've always understood that they can be swapped for each other.

This recipe was delicious! My kids even raved about it. I used fresh parmesan cheese which I think made the topping, I also added some Italian bread crumbs to help hold the topping together. Will definitely make again.

Made this on a whim because I'm new to tilapia and had all the ingredients. It was great, and the topping is very tasty. Because of my current diet, I took out the butter altogether. I didn't feel like it needed it. 

A little suggestion if you like a little kick is to add Sriracha. It's my favorite combination with mayo and usually add it to anything that calls for a mayo-based topping. Just really good with fish too!

OK so I made this exact recipe but used it on Cod fish. My husband and I are not fans of Tilapia but love Cod and Haddock. We are always looking for something different to do with it other than the usual baking with bread crumb or seafood stuffing as a topping. So I greased a large glass baking dish, placed the Cod in the dish, covered tightly with tin foil and baked at 375 for approx. 20 minutes. I then uncovered the fish and spread the sauce on top of the fillets and broiled until done.

I'm not a fan of fish at all. My nine year old decided to become health happy so I was looking for new things to cook and came across this... Well all I can say is this was amazing.  I will be cooking this more often.

Really great recipe, highly recommended.  This has become a regular in our house hold and is an easy way to impress guests without too much time and effort.  It is 4 instead of 5 starts because a few modifications are needed, especially, about half as much butter.  I don't like my fish dripping with butter, plus it makes the sauce runny.  Like other reviewers mentioned, adding bread crumbs is a big improvement and helps the sauce stay in place.  Some cayenne pepper also adds a bit of kick that we prefer.  Yummy recipe!

If you are a mom looking for a quick easy and extremely delicious meal to make for your family, or simply a young man trying to impress a girl on a dinner date night!   This will simply WOW everyone with very very little effort.  Follow the recipe and you should have no problems.  And like the recipe says.. Don't over cook the fish …. because fish doesn't take long to cook.  I am a mom of a 12 year old daughter and this is one of her most favorite dinners that I make.  if only she knew how easy it was!!  The BEST fish recipe EVER!!! No Joke .

This turned out great!  I read Shannon :)'s review and made a few adjustments of my own.  I seasoned my fish but I seasoned it with mango lime seafood seasoning.  I added garlic powder and paprika in the cheese mixture.  And I also used sour cream in the mixture instead of mayo because I didn't have any mayo.  And I used lime juice instead of lemon juice.  My daughter loved it.

My husband and I often cook tilapia, so it was wonderful to find such a flavorful dish that is super easy to prepare. It is now, by far, my favorite way to fix the fish.

This was excellent! I skipped the lemon juice and added lemon pepper, garlic salt, and Old Bay. I crushed up 3 Ritz crackers and added to the mix which gave the topping a bit of crunch. So good!

No complaints here. I'd probably make a little more of the topping to put on top of the fish (and maybe a little more Parmesan in it), but very tasty fish.

Versatile Tasty recipe.  I cut down on the butter to 2 tablespoons and I substituted Fage Greek yogurt for the mayo, otherwise, followed the recipe. I made with a barley/mushroom side dish and a nice green salad that had Kalamata olives in it which really complimented the fish. I think it would be tasty to incorporate the olives in the Parmesan/mayo mixture. I will try it out next time I make the dish.

This recipe is really good! I served it with sautéed zucchini and baked sweet potato...delish! 
I made the recipe as directed because I think it's weird when people review a recipe that they didn't follow. Especially when the experimenters post a bad review.  Who do they think they're insulting? They made a good recipe bad, and instead of shuffling away  in quiet embarrassment, they post a bad review of their own cooking....haha!
This  recipe is going into the rotation for sure!

The recipe as is needs some work. A little heavy on lemon and not enough earthy flavors or spice. Will keep experimenting with it until I find the right balance.

I looked at comments and sprinkled ole bay on both sides before broiling. I added  some Panko to the topping and a 1/4 teas of pepper seeds to half recipe, and 1/4 teas of paprika.  Also added a little garlic powder 1/8 teas because there again I halved everything.  I'm not a big fish eatter  but I would eat this again .  Thanks everyone for your comments! I made the recipe as was and added the above.

Very good! I have some personal issues with farm raised fish so I made this with good and fresh Maryland rockfish! Delicious! My entire family loved it! I added a half teaspoon of minced garlic and a dash of paprika to the sauce based on another review. Also seasoned the fish with old bay before broiling. Did I say delicious???

I have made this so many times, and it always turns out great.  Simple, fast - it's definitely a go to recipe when I don't have much time in the evening.  I often substitute Swai fillets for the Tilapia.  It's a larger filet with very similar cooking characteristics.  Just remember to dry the fillets thoroughly before cooking.  I place them between layers of paper towels which seems to work great!

I keep this one in my arsenal of recipes that I pull out regularly. It works well with almost any mild fish. I like to use flounder, as flounder doesn't have the "muddy" aftertaste that tilapia can have.  I absolutely love the flavors the topping imparts. I have used this a few times for my eight course meals as the fish course, using a half of a filet per person with fresh green beans.  A lot of times, I will pan fry the fish on top of the stove in a non-stick pan, then put the topping on and broil it. It works well that way, too. Everyone raves about the taste. If I could give it more stars I would.

My husband loves this way of serving any type of mild fish.  I often use flounder or catfish.  In one variation I use a dash of Tabasco mixed into the cheese blend instead of the herbal and sprinkle the lemon juice over the fish before broiling .

We made steamed  cinnamon honey carrots, southwest chipotle cabbage, and Caribbean broccoli with it, and the whole meal was phenomenal.

This is by far the best recipe for fish I have ever come across! My grandmother, who is the real cook in the family, even asked me for the recipe. I have made this recipe many times. Sometimes I even play with the ingredients a little. I have put this on different kinds of fish and had great results! I will continue to make this recipe for years to come! To bad I can only give it 5 stars!

This was my second time making this recipe. The first time I made it, I followed it to a T...4 stars (but that's probably only because I am not a fish person, and to me, it was still too fishy). I made it again for Christmas Eve, this time following some of Shannon's tips (see "most helpful" comment), and it was a hit! 5 stars, hands down best fish recipe I've made thus far. I followed the rest of the directions/broiling time exactly...just added 1/4 tsp garlic powder, 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper flakes, 1/2 tsp paprika, and 1/2 cup bread crumbs to the cheese mixture. (The bread crumbs is what really makes it a 5 star dish...the first time I omitted it and a lot of the cheese mixture melted off the tilapia). Not only did it keep the topping on the fish, but it also gave it a nice, crispy texture. So good that I've been asked to make it again on New Year's :-) Definitely going into seafood rotation.

I love this recipe. I added some bread crumbs and seasoned the fish with old bay before topping it with the mixture.

This was excellent, and just as easy as was promised.  I will be making this again!  I followed the recipe exactly save for using celery seed instead of celery salt.  
--3rd time making this: I still don't own celery salt, so I've been subbing in celery flakes instead and I FORGOT the lemon juice entirely, yet it still tastes great.  On tilapia and catfish, this recipe is wonderful.  On cod it was just so-so though.  Definitely pile on the topping; the one request I get for changing this is more topping!

I genuinely liked this fish recipe. It is very smooth and flavorful. It's tasty and pairs well..

The one thing I would be careful and suggest is to lightly coat the mixture on top to a fine layer. I made the mistake of plopping on a thick layer and the textures clashed. It being too soft with the soft mixture on top makes it too squishy if that makes sense!

I made this for a couple from church that was busy with medical issues with a foster child. I got an email from them later raving about how good it was, and asking for my secret. I had saved a filet back for myself too, and I must say, it was really good! Followed the recipe exactly, and I wouldn't change a thing.

Wonderful flavor.  I did not use the broiler but cooked in my frying pan.  I also add 1/2 tsp. paprika, 1/4 tsp. garlic powder and 1/4 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes, as suggested. Delicious.

Getting me to eat mayonnaise (or creamy sauces at all, for that matter) is a feat in itself but this recipe is absolutely delicious and I don't think twice about it! Our broiler has a temperature setting and we set it to 490F, that cooked it perfectly. We'll make this again!

The dish is delicious. I changed the basil and seasoned with oregano o parsley. Also, a used orange juice instead of lemon juice. Taste very good.

We've made this recipe several times and love it.  It's quick, easy, and delicious!  Tonight I added capers to the parmesan mix and it added a great pop of flavor.  Sometimes we add rosemary too.  Yum!

Fantastically simple way to make tilapia. I started by salt/peppering the fish before broiling and that made it just a tad too salty. But the cook time and parmesan sauce were perfect!

I cook most days for my husband, son-in-law, daughter and their 2 year old boy.  All of them loved this recipe-even the two year old, who ate an entire filet himself.  I almost stood up and cheered!

I didn't have celery salt and onion powder on hand, so I used celery seed and finely chopped red onion.  I will make this again and again.

it was delicious! My husband was shocked that it was mayo and butter. I didn't read the amount of fish very well, I only had 4 filets so the fish definitely swam in the sauce, but still good. next time I'll certainly half it.

Only a couple of changes in the seasoning which worked for me.  I  was out of celery salt & replaced with a pinch of celery flakes and old bay.  The old bay in particular gave it a nice zest - Thank you so much for sharing, I'll be following it as written next time.

Tasty and easy! Used celery seed instead of celery salt and added garlic powder and paprika. As some have said, it is a really strong flavor for white fish but that didn't bother me.

My boyfriend, who admits to not even liking fish, has requested I make this again for the second time in two weeks. Followed the recipe exactly, except I used swai which was on sale at the time. Tasted like something you would order at Carabba's. Incredibly easy but awesome flavor.

It was good and very easy. The sauce tasted a lot like Parmesan peppercorn salad dressing. I added a tiny bit of garlic powder, because I'm Italian and can't help it, and a touch of old bay, per other reviewers' suggestions.also, didn't have any lemons so I easily subbed rice vinegar.
Will make it again.

I have made this on several occasions and it is always enjoyed by all. I varied the recipe and used catfish, it was still wonderful, just had to broil longer.  I mixed the Kraft grated parm and some fresh shaved parm this last time and always season the fish with blackened seasoning and a little seasoning salt.  I added lemon pepper, cayenne and black pepper to the original mix.  This is one of our favorites! I have been broiling in a lined pan, I think I may try a broil pan so that the excess juice drains, especially with catfish.  The flavor is wonderful.

I'm not one to alter a recipe the first time around. This one is not one to alter. However, when you change the servings not all the ingredients decreased in the amount to use, such as celery salt. But if I noticed that, I would have cut it back. This is a definite keeper and I will pass it on to other family members that like this type of fish.

I made this and my family LOVED it!  It has become a staple recipe in my house. The only changes I have made are that I use about half of the mayo to cut the tartness. I also top the fish with a layer of panko bread crumbs. The fish comes out with a crispy top layer that way. Overall very yummy!

Great basic recipe that appears to allow for lots of personal variation. I reduced the butter to 1 Tbsp and subbed plain Greek yogurt for the sour cream, also reduced the parm cheese to a generous 1/4 cup. I used celery seed instead of celery salt, and if you do that you may want to add a bit of salt. My tilapia fillets were small and I wish I'd reduced the cook time a bit, as they were a little dry. Not the fault of the submitter, of course. Thanks Phoebe!

This is a great recipe!  The only thing I would might be to use less butter.  It tasted awesome!

My family loves this! Very simple and easy to make! I skip the lemon since the mayonnaise gives the dish enough zest.

Real easy recipe, but used 1/2 the butter.  Made with Swai (vietnamese light white fish) showing you can use with any white light fish.  The trick is to be sure not to over cook.  Family loved it and I will definitely make again!!!

I tried this on my anniversary and was simply not impressed. The mayonnaise curdled which caused me to have to start over, after omitting the mayo, and completing the dish; it was than overpowered by butter and lemon. If you're going to make this recipe, I suggest altering significantly.

Very nice as is. My kids and I all loved it. The basil fit this mixture very well, but many combinations of herbs and/or seasonings w/various cheeses would work as well.  Thanks for the great idea!

I loved this recipe! Fast, easy to make, flavorful. It looks great, too. I had extra parmesan mixture, spread it on a split dinner roll and put it under the broiler when I coated the tilapia with the mixture--that, too, was good. This is now my go-to recipe for whitefish.

Fabulous.  The only thing different I did was add a 1/4 tsp garlic powder and a 1/4 tsp paprika as one of the other reviewers suggested.  Oh my!!! is all I can say...TRY IT!!!

I was low on Parmesan so I added asiago bread crumbs to the mix. Topped with another sprinkle of bread crumbs for a nice crunch.  Delicious!

This was amazing. And I spread the topping on chicken breast too.  I did not even have lemon juice. I substituted celery salt with celery seed. But to be honest, it was all about the butter, mayo, parmesan combo.

Good fish recipe, although I may go lighter on amount of Parmasean and lemon. Husband said good as a fish recipe, but he isn't into eating fish often. Nice and flaky.

I used shredded Parmesan vs. the powdery stuff; maybe that's why it turned out so mushy/yucky?

I made this for the first time last week & I am making it again tonight. I did make a few adjustments like others suggested. I did not use the celery salt because I didn't have any.I added 1/8 tsp of paprika & 1/8 tsp garlic powder plus extra black pepper, as well as another tablespoon of Parmesan cheese. I also put it in the broiler with the dark vein side facing up for about 3 minutes while still frozen then flipped it for another 3 minutes (the filet I used were smaller than normal). Added the topping and cooked about 5 mins or less. Turned out great, the hubby loved it as well! Super fast & delish...can't go wrong!

This was so simple and tasted absolutely wonderful.  I'm always looking for quick meals that don't require marinating and this one was perfect!  My family said they want me to make it again! I did add the Old Bay seasoning as suggested by Sheila in Texas.

This was simple and delicious! I used only about 1 pound (2 fillets) therefore it had about twice the amount of Parmesan goodness and it was great! I will definitely make this again and again!

Great fish dish in 15 minutes flat! Greased the bottom of the pan with coconut oil/butter to give it a slight sweetness. Added in the 1/2 cup of bread crumbs as recommended by previous reviewers. Served on top of a bed of spinach, chopped onions, and chopped carrots tossed in a mixture of ranch and chipotle ranch dressing. Delightful!

We loved this recipe.  I'm always looking for ways to make fish appealing in my household, since I have one pescatarian and some enthusiastic carnivores.  Next time I would ease up on the lemon juice, which was a little overpowering for our taste.  I had to use canned Parmesan cheese, but I'd bet it would be even better with freshly grated Parm.

This was a wonderful recipe.  The first time I made it I followed the recipe but found it was too salty for my taste.  I omitted the butter and celery salt (replaced with a dash of celery seed) and sprinkled with panko before baking.

I really enjoyed this flavor and texture. My 3 year old thought it could have been more crunchy but he is 3 after all. Just having the technique and base ingredients mayo, parm and butter is valuable because you can flavor any way you want and still have yummy fish in 10 minutes!

I followed the recipe exactly ,except it was a little difficult to flip the fish over the last time so I just ignored that part.  The mixture was a bit difficult to spread but it turned out pretty good!  My wife was not a fan of the "chalky" texture though, so if we make this a second time we will use shredded parmesan instead of grated.

This was such a hit with everyone.  I followed the suggestions of others and added a few bread crumbs, garlic salt and cayenne pepper.  I made the mistake of adding lemon juice and lemon pepper to the fish first and it was too lemony

Great recipe! Has worked great with any firm, mild sweet flavor fish such as grouper, red snapper, orange roughy, or halibut. After making this over and over I too recommend using a tad less butter. I always pair this with Allrecipes: roasted vegetable orzo, but most of the time sub quinoa for orzo. My husband and very picky 4 yr old love this every time!

This was delicious!!! Took advice of other reviewers and seasoned the fish a little with old bay-- but don't overdo it. Added seasoned Italian bread crumbs to the topping, but I'm sure it would still be delicious without them. Try it! You will love it.

Made this for the family dinner tonight and was told it was like it was from a restaurant.  Even the picky teenager loved it.  I made it according to the recipe and wouldn't change anything.  Just have your butter softened, not melted.  I made it too warm and some of the topping melted off the fish, which you won't want to happen because it is so delicious.  I served it with Sarah's Rice Pilaf from allrecipes as well. My boyfriend has already requested to have it again.  This is a keeper!

This is the best Tilapia and so easy to make! I omit the celery salt because I never have any and don't feel it is missing any flavor. My family always raves about this recipe. I pair it with the Parmesian Basil Orzo recipe I found on this site as well. Perfect combo!

This recipe was lovely !!!  My husband is usually not fond of fish fillets unless they are crispy, but he couldn't get enough of these.  I followed the recipe exactly and the end result was the most flavorful, savory fish fillets ever !  Thank you so much for sharing :)

The flavor of the sauce was too strong for this delicate fish. And the texture of the sauce was rather mushy - neither crunchy nor saucy.

Quick & easy.  Cheesy & creamy. Can knock off a few calories by using low fat mayo and less cheese.

The first time I made this my husband and kids absolutely loved it;  so simple, and so delicious.  The only thing I altered when I made this later is the amount of parmesan cheese, it is a very rich dish so I cut some of that out and my family still loved it.  Highly recommend this dish!

I have been trying to find a way to incorporate fish into my diet (I eat horribly) and this recipe was great. My husband and 6 year old daughter agree. We will be eating this often.

As other have stated, I found the cheese mixture too strong that it took away from the fish.  In a family of five, one loved it,one didn't like it and the others thought it was ok.

I used Shannon :)'s modifications except I didn't have breadcrumbs to I used 1/2 cup of crushed corn tortilla chips. My family loved it. We eat tilapia all the time and my husband says this is his favorite recipe by far. It's so easy and quick and we always have the ingredients on hand. Great job.

This fish was really simple and tasteful. I did this for my son's dedication and it surely was a hit! I tried it before with the panko crumbs that someone suggested and I think it added great consistency to the top of the fish.. I did forget to put it in for the dedication but everyone still found it was great.. I didn't add the lemon juice though.. But I also added Cayanne and paprika

I cheated... Used tartar sauce instead of mayonnaise and omitted the onion powder and such and used salmon instead as that is what I had. Love it! Great flavour and so easy to make.

Absolutely amazing! I try to make a new dish each week, and based on the reviews of others, I thought I would give this a good Tuesday Night try. Wow, how easy to make with and all day prep taste. I have two boy's ages 10 and 11, and a wonderful husband, let's just say, we were fighting over the last filet. I won of course lol :)

Fish was tender sauce was creamy, my teenage son loved it!  I used Sour Cream instead of mayo and fresh basil not dried, and 1 tbl lemon.  It was just right.

This is the second time I made this, and I have to say this is way too greasy.  It's probably better to sprinkle the fish with the parmesan and some breadcrumbs, along with the spices, without any of the mayo or butter.  As it is, it's not good at all.

I thought it had to much lemon and needed more spices. Plus my house stunk awful for a couple of days. Overall it's edible but I will not be making it again.

This was awesome! My husband couldn't even say how good it was because he didn't want to stop stuffing his face! I didn't alter it at all, I'm sure you could though if you've had it 1,000 times, which I'm sure I will

This recipe was delicious...I used different spices (paprika, black peeper, chipotle and garlic seasoning) because I didnt have the ones mentioned in the recipe. I also added panko (better than bread crumbs!). This will probably be made at least every other month now for dinner. This is the first dinner-type recipe that I made from this site that I am completely satisfied with so far. I make a similar recipe but with fettuccine sauce, panko crumbs and fresh parmesan cheese that is just as good as this one.

this is the first thing I have ever reviewed....so to me, that's saying a lot! I had Talapia I was looking for a good recipe for....I was SHOCKED at how EASY and DELICIOUS this recipe was....especially since i do NOT like mayonnaise. A few ofmy children are very picky eaters and they LOVED it and were fighting over the leftovers! I highly recommend this recipe! It gets 5 stars from my family!

My brother bought some frozen tilapia and normally don't like frozen fish nor tilapia. After using this recipe I absolutely love it! I didn't have celery salt nor onion powder so I switched it with garlic salt and garlic powder. Its like fish you eat at a fancy restaurant with a glass of wine.

Smashing success. I made it with flounder instead tilapia, dinner was done in 5 minute in my broiler toaster oven. This is great for low carb diet.

This recipe turned out well, but I did make many adjustments as usual. I don't generally use measuring spoons, so my descriptions may be a little more general. I made 2 tilapia filets. I cut out the celery salt completely.  I added a couple dashes of paprika and garlic powder. I still added the lemon even though many reviewers cut this out. I used the olive oil mayo since it is lower in fat. I added much more pepper than what the recipe stated, but this should be done by your taste. I added some herb bread crumbs to the mixture and I also seasoned the fish on both sides before putting it in the broiler. I didn't notice any comments about the broiler, but I put it on low and just checked up on it after 2 minutes to see how cooked it was. This worked well for me.

My husband and I love this recipe, its been in my rotation for years now.
My only hint of wisdom is I find pre-ground packaged parmesan to work best as opposed to freshly grated (which I would generally prefer) but that may just be my preference.

The flavor was nice, but when I tried to add the Parmesan mixture it just melted and ran through the grates of the broiler pan.. A bit disappointing.

This turned out great. I had polluck and tilapia and it worked wonderfully. I over-salted the fish but the fresh steamed veggies along with the coconut rice that I made, my wife is from Belize, went well with the savoriness of this dish. I was well pleased, especially since my 13 old picky son ate it all. Thanks for this dish. I keeper for sure.

Amazing! Used low cal mayo, light butter, and added old bay seasoning and panko to the ingredients. Husband said it is the best fish I have ever made.  My parents are having cod tonight and I convinced them to let me use this topping vs. cooking on the grill.  Can't wait for them to try.

This was EXCELLENT!  I'm not big on fish and usually when I make it I only eat about half of the serving... but when I make this I eat the whole filet.  I really dislike mayo so I substituted low fat sour cream.  I also added paprika and rubbed the fish with spicy seafood seasoning (similar to old bay) before cooking it.  Best fish I've ever had.

Quick, easy, healthy and bonus: kids love it.  I have made this recipe hundres times, never change anything except perhaps for the variety of fish.  Marvelous, 5 stars, what else can I say.

I scaled the recipe for 2 peices of talapia. We thought this was a nice change. I sprinkled a little Old Bay on both sides before broiling. Three minutes on each side - the thickest parts of our filets were about 3/4 inch thick.

Very delicious recipe.  My kids are very picky.... and they started out eating spaghetti instead, but finished dinner by eating some of the fish.

I tried this tonight and the only thing I changed  was to add was a couple of crushed Ritz crackers to the topping . I only made two servings for my husband and myself , my husband asked me to make more servings the next time I make it.  He is a picky eater and he liked this

I took the suggestion of adding the Old Bay seasoning to the fish and used shredded Parmesan cheese but other than that I followed the recipe. It was quick, easy, and I dare say it was the best fish dish I've ever had!

We enjoy the tang of the parmesan on the mild fish. Cooking time can be tricky because fish is quite varied in thickness, I will sometimes overlap the thinner portions of two pieces to get a more consistent thickness.  I line my grilling pan with tin foil.

Fantastic! Based on some of the reviews, I cut the butter down to 2 TBSP and added some paprika. I also sprinkled a little salt, pepper & garlic powder on the fish before broiling. I think you could easily make it even healthier just by decreasing the amount of cheese mixture per fish - it's thick and flavorful, and I found a little goes a long way.

Watch the broiler carefully, this cooks FAST

How can something so easy be so good!? My dad, sister, and I have a cooking competition every two weeks to see who can make the best dinner, and this recipe won it for me! It is not a lie that this takes 15 minutes, and the 4 1/2 star review is not an exaggeration. It is important to note that you must mind your oven's variation on cooking times only for the sake of browner, more crispy mixture on top, not because the fish will not be cooked through. 
Also, I bought 3 tilapia filets, which I believe came to less than one pound (and the ingredients list says 2 pounds) but I still made the sauce like I was following the portion size on the recipe. I did not use the cheese-mayo-spice mixture lightly, either; I smothered it on those filets like they were some Waffle House hash browns. The sauce didn't overpower the fish; in fact, it was a perfect combination.
I served the fish with some sauteed mushrooms, and BOOM, victory was mine, and it is glorious! :D

Great recipe - Tastes great and easy to fix.  I used celery seed and table salt for celery salt.  I broiled these as directed in the recipe.  Until now, my attempts at fish have always come out way to fishy.  I'm guessing now I should always use fresh fish and not thawed from frozen?  Changed my life.

Tasted the sauce and thought it was very bland so I upped all the spices except for the pepper.  Still thought the taste was really odd, but went ahead and baked it anyway.  It was fantastic and everybody's only complaint was that we hadn't made more!!

Made this for my husband & I. We don't prepare fish often...although we're trying to introduce more into our weekly eating & I thought this would be a good place to start since it seemed very simple. I thought right! The even better is that they were delicious too. We have added this to our recipe box & will be making it again.

Love it. It is on a weekly rotation in our house. I like changing up the ingredients with the suggestions by other cooks here. That way it doesn't get tiresome. The breadcrumbs are key every time, though because they keep the sauce in place.

This was deliciously simple! I love an easy, tasty weeknight recipe and this is it! I loved the sauce so much I'm contemplating what other recipes I can add it too. It was that good! I added old bay seasoning like others suggested and substituted garlic salt for celery salt because I despise celery. Definitely adding this to the rotation

My husband and I liked the sauce, but it was a bit strong for my personal taste. Next time, I'll decrease the butter and cheese a bit to offer a more mild flavor. Overall, it was very good and my husband is not much of a fish eater, but he had two servings.

Really quite good, but I'm betting it would be just as good (and spreadable) with less butter. I would also like to try adding some corn meal for a crunchier topping and some hot sauce for some kick. (In my non-kid batch.) All in all, my family had seconds!

WOW! I wish I could give this more than 5 stars. I only had a small amount of parmesean cheese and added alittle panko crumbs and it turned out great! It is very fast and easy and what flavor! Thanks for the recipe!!

Not only is it quick and easy it is really good. I only used 2 tablespoons of butter and that was fine. I 'nuked' the sauce to make it runnier before spreading on fish. We bought about .7 ounces/3 fillets of tilapia for 2 of us and I should have halved the sauce. I served it with rice and sauteed garlic spinach.

This is a family favorite for us.  I have made a few adjustments that we really enjoy. I cut back on the lemon juice by half and added 2 TBLS of sour cream and an additional TBSP of Mayo, omitted the celery salt and butter. After I cooked the tilapia and added the sauce I sprinkled some panko bread crumbs on top and placed back under the broiled until the crumbs were a nice and toasty.

We enjoyed this immensely. We aren't big fish eaters, coming from a ranch, but this is going to be my go to recipe from here on out. I didn't change anything the first time I made this and it was very good. The second time I dusted the fish with old bay, and substituted dill for the basil. We liked the dill flavor better than the basil, but that's just personal preference.

It was amazing.  Followed the recipe exactly and found the fish moist, the sauce flavorful but delicate.  It was even a hit with my two small boys "the best 'chicken' ever, mom!"  I just smiled.

I have been making this for my family for a few months now and it is a hit every single time!! My 7 yr old wants to eat this every single night of the week. I make it exactly as directed and it turns out perfect every time! I serve it with angel hair pasta with a butter garlic sauce or just the fish with steamed asparagus.

This was one of the best marinades I have ever had. It really covers the fishy taste and a great combination that goes well with Tilapia. I will be saving this one to make again. Thanks!

I'm quite fond of this recipe, especially with Shannon's alterations. Bread crumbs give it a nice texture, and the cheese, mayo, and spice mixture give it a great flavor. 

I recommend setting your broiler to lo because it is very easy to burn this fish if you aren't constantly keeping an eye on it.

Made this last week and it went fast.  Really fast.  It was also easy, and used ingredients that are usually on hand in my kitchen.  I happened to have fresh basil so I substituted it for the dried and it added a very fresh taste to the dish.  It is also important to use a quality parm for this dish to taste its best, but it will still be excellent if you use something like Kraft.  I also seasoned the fillets with Slap Ya Mama seasoning blend before sliding them under the broiler.  So good!

The first time I made this, I followed the recipe; my husband said it was the best fish he'd ever had!  I made it again this evening, and made a few changes I saw in the reviews.  I added some bread crumbs, decreased the mayo (hubby is not fond of it) and added the paprika.  It was even better than the first time!  This recipe is a keeper.

The topping completely overpowers the tilapia.  If you don't like tilapia, this is probably a good thing but I like the mild taste of tilapia so the recipe was a huge disappointment.  I would certainly cut the butter way down - it just pooled around the fish.  The amount of topping is probably enough for about 5 lbs of fish to give you and idea.

I needed somehting new for tilapia and this got rave reviews.  I followed recipe as stated, but used light mayo and a little less butter. It was great! I served with a lemon orzo side dish for something different.  Very quick and easy. I suppose I could have baked in toaster oven, but since I doubled the recipe I used the oven.

Tried this recipe tonight and we loved it! My husband and son said it was delicious. I followed recipe exactly ,I had no onion powder or celery salt so I used garlic powder and added smoked paprika for color. I will make it again. The thing I loved about it was that is was quick and easy, yet tasted so elegant and was beautiful. I would add Paprika for the color.

Great easy recipe. I also started with the fish upside down, broiled for 3 minutes, turned, added the sauce and broiled for 3 more minutes. That was all it needed. I had some Romano Cheese so i did half and half, it you like the flavor of Romano then try it out.

So simple to make and it tasted AMAZING!!!  We also tried it on chicken and again it was AMAZING!!!  I modified it a little by using low fat mayo and the olive oil I Can't Believe it's Not Butter.  I also sprinkled a little extra parm on the top to make sure I got that nice crunchy brown top.  LOVE LOVE LOVE and will make again!!!

Tried this recipe tonight with only a few changes. As others did, used garlic salt instead of celery salt. I'm not a fan of mayo so I used a plain Greek yogurt. It turned out so yummy! Definitely will be keeping this one around!

I really liked the flavor of this but it seemed too runny...I now see the suggestions recommend adding panko, I'll have to try that next time

This recipe is amazing. It's delicious and quick. As a reference, I usually make half the recipe and have the right amount of cheese mix for approximately 4 medium-sized fillets.

Wow! is all I can say for this recipe. I read about 25-30 reviews before I try any recipe, but on this one, in the first 17 they were all raving about this fabulous recipe.  I had to try it for sure, and glad I did.  You really outdid yourself Phoebe, it's excellent and if I could give you 8 stars I would, you certainly deserve it! Thank you for sharing.

So easy and on-hand ingredients. I like the idea of adding a little paprika. This sauce was so good we were dipping our bread in it! A keeper.

I really liked this! I am definitely going to try it again...I am going to adapt the recipe slightly to my boyfriend's and my tastes, but very easy and yummy! I am going to use a couple of Shannon's ideas in the reviews. Thanks for the suggestions!

My boyfriend is not a fan of tilapia but Loved this dish.  Didn't change a thing.  Next time I might try a few of the changes other people wrote about but it's so good it doesn't really need any changes.

I had to scale back the Parmesan to 1/4c. Even then, it seemed a little thick. It went well though, my husband hates Parmesan, but wanted more. He asked me to make it the next night too.

Like others, I add my own touches to this. Use just a dash of lemon juice, and add some garlic  powder. @ hokiefan, to make mine more crispy, I add a sprinkle of breadcrumbs on top (along with a little extra parmesan) after it cooks the requisite time and then put it under the broiler for a minute or so. Hubby says he could eat this at least once a week, it's my go to white fish recipe.

I always do my corned beef in a crock pot.I have never done it with the cabbage. When I saw this recipe. I desided to try it. It went well. Next time I will not put my potatoes in so early. 7 Hours is a long time to do the potatoes. I will add them with the cabbage. Otherwise it was a great receipe. Richard

It was late and needed something fast for dinner. I came across this recipe and decided to give it a try along with the Indian-style rice also from this site.  The fish was outstanding! I cooked it as written as I didn't really have time to improvise here and there. I WILL make this recipe again.  Thank you!

Great base recipe!  We eat tilapia a lot and I'm always looking for new recipes.  This one is a keeper.  I used about 3/4 c. of unflavored Panko in the mixture as well as some sweet smoky paprika, dried parsley flakes and garlic paste.  I mixed it all ahead of time so the flavors would "get together".  The mayo doesn't seem to do anything for the taste, maybe it's just to help hold the mixture together.  Next time I may not use it.  There was plenty of topping for 2 pounds.  I will definitely make this again, my husband and son loved it as did I. Thanks to Phoebe for the recipe and the other contributors for their comments and suggestions.

This was wonderful!!!!! The only change I made was to add some panko bread crumbs, and I couldn't find my celery salt to save my life. With the Lenten Season here and the fact that my local store had Tilapia on sale for $2 a pound I bought quite a bit and and was looking for ways to cook it. Usually I make tacos. My husband would not try it because he "HATES" tilapia (He's never tried it LOL) but he does like snapper so I'm going to try it on snapper. I also think it would be great to add some small salad shrimp, or crab to the topping to make really fancy. I also think you could lower the fat using lowfat mayo and butter without taking away from the flavor. Love the fact that it takes all of 10 minutes to make a wonderful meal. Have the rice cooker set to start cooking automatically toss some vegis in the steamer and your done!

in my opinion, fish is too delicate for the mayo/butter/parm mixture.  Tasty but not my ideal way to enjoy tilapia.

This is so simple and so good.  Tweak it if you like, but it's so good and healthy (we use olive oil mayo) as is.

This time I broiled the fish 2 minutes at 500 degrees on the very top rack, turned it over and broiled another 2 minutes, added the topping and broiled until browned. It turned out perfectly.   2-1-2013 I'm still learning to broil, so the fact that I couldn't get the topping to brown is my fault, I'm sure. I followed directions and broiled the first side 3 minutes. Then I turned it over and broiled it for 2 more minutes. I added the topping and continued cooking for 3 minutes. I was afraid to keep broiling the fish for fear it would be tough, dry, and overcooked. It turned out delicious, even though it didn't get crusty brown. I'll definitely try this again.

Tried this recipe tonight and it was wonderful! Used greek yogurt in place of mayo, a little less butter (mixed with olive oil) and used 1/2 Asiago freshly shredded and 1/2 parm cheese. Hubby is not a fish lover, but he loved this! Served with veggie birds nest, broccoli and rosemary potatoes! Will make this again for sure! Thanks!

This is a great recipe that you must try!  Even if your not too crazy about fish, but will eat it, you would have no problem eating this!  My daughter loved it as well!  The only thing I added was garlice powder instead of the onion powder.

This fish was utterly delicious!  I followed the directions almost exactly.  One small substitution: because I didn't have any onion powder, I used paprika instead.  Similar to suggested by other reviewers, I also rinsed the fish first, patted it dry, then dusted it with Season All Salt.  I will definitely be making this recipe again!

Wow!  I have a new favorite seafood recipe!  Normally I would follow a recipe exactly the first time, but I realized I was out of lemon juice and celery salt, so I substituted lime juice and Old Bay.  Also, since I'm not a huge talapia fan, I used cod.  This was so delicious, husband loved it too, and it would be impressive enough for company.

I'm a college student with little time to cook, and this recipe was quick and easy. I didn't even bother with measuring, just put in what looked like the amount listed (I changed the serving size to one) and viola! Even though I kinda forgot about it for two or three minutes in the oven, it still tasted amazing! I also made some buttery spinach with salt in a pan while it cooked and toasted some bread and topped that with butter and garlic powder. Great meal and it only took a total of 15 minutes to make! Definitely adding this to my go-to recipe box.

Wow, thanks for this recipe Phoebe!!  This was actually my first time trying tilapia and it's now my favorite fish!  The parmesan mixture on top was just delicious.  I served it with asparagus and rosemary potatoes from this site.  I can't wait to make again.

I made this twice now,and it is a good recipe.
But its not a great, way to much butter,there is enough oil in the 
mayo so reduce the butter to 1 tbsp.The onion powder overpowers the parmesan,the second time i left it out and it was better.

This was a great Tilapia recipe. I changed some of the proportions of the ingredients, and took some suggestions from other reviewers. My biggest change was to reduce the butter and increase the mayo and cheese (used reduced fat mayo too). So for a serving of 8, my way came out to this: 8 Tilapia fillets, 1/2 cup reduced-fat mayo, 1 cup grated parmesan, 2 tb and 2 tsp butter (so that works out to 1 tbsp mayo, 2 tbsp parm, and 1 tsp butter per fillet). I kept the recommended seasonings (except I had no onion powder on hand), but took some suggestions and added 1/4 tsp garlic powder and 1/2 tsp Paprika. I also sprinkled the tops with a light coating of whole wheat breadcrumbs, and after broiling they came out with a nice, crispy crust on top of the cheesy layer. They different textures made it really nice.

We used tilapia fillets from Market Day, skipped the pepper, and used seasoning salt instead of celery salt. Can I say this was absolutely amazing! I generally do not like fish, but this was delicious!!

This was easy and delicious. I subbed seasoned pepper and oregano for the basil and other seasonings; next time I'm trying it with olive oil instead of butter.

I have never written a review before but this tilapia was great!!  All 3 of my kids ate it and asked for more (age 7, 5, 3).  I followed the recipe mostly.  A few changes.  I did half cheese and half itallian seasoned panko bread crumbs.  Added garlic salt.  And, sprinkled lawry's seasoned salt on tilapia before I broiled it the first time.  Thank you for this great recipe!!!

I made this recipe for my husband and myself after a long day of work. We were both ecstatic to find a dish that is quick and easy to make but that tastes like it took hours to cook! It has become one of our favorite fish recipes. I only made one modification: I made extra topping to coat the fish more after it cooked to make it a bit more rich tasting.

I have never been a fan of any kind of fish, however this recipe had me, acutally, LOVING fish! The parmesan is so surprising in your mouth with the tilapia. we added a bit of bread crumbs to the crust for a little more crunch. This will be the only way we make tilapia in our house from now on!

This fish was excellent! I sprinkled Emeril's Fish seasoning on both sides of the fish before broiling. My boyfriend loved it and has requested it again asap! Definitley a keeper!

Great, and easy.  Made a few changes, only because I didn't have all the original ingredients!
- Used EVOO instead of butter
- A touch less mayo
- didn't have basil, so used a mix of oregano + parsley 
- used a pear vinegarette (will use LESS than 2 tbsp next time)
- NO onion powder, and NO celery salt
- fresh grated parmesan cheese I think made the dish!

Based on the many reviews, we tweaked the recipe to our liking, and it was delicious.  Definately a keeper, as we are trying to do meatless Fridays.  Thank you for all the great ideas.

My husband LOVED this!!! The couple bites I had were delicious then hubby asked for seconds so I gave him mine. The next day he texted me from work saying he was thinking about dinner last night and can we have it again. That same evening he asked if there was any more. So next time we're making at least a double recipe! We used fat free sour cream instead of mayo, and added a couple dashes of hot sauce (for hubby).

I made this on Christmas Eve and it was a huge hit. The only thing I varied slightly is i let the fish marinate with some fresh lemon for a few hours in the fridge. I also made the parmesan mixture a few hours ahead of time and kept it in the fridge until I needed it. I think it really helped the flavors fuse together. Will definitely be making it again.

My husband came home unexpectedly with tilapia and I did not have the ingredients for my usual recipe. I found this recipe and it was so easy and quick to prepare. The family loved it.  I think I will try adding garlic next time.

My children hate fish but absolutely love this recipe. This has become a frequent meal in our house. I did make a few changes. I use low fat mayo and I use shredded parmesan not the powdered stuff.I also add a 1/4 cup of italian blend cheese to the mix. Turns out great!!

My family loves this recipe. We are not big fish eaters and it is a good way to get some fish in our diet. I have made the recipe as written it we like it that way. I have also added the half a cup of breadcrumbs to the topping and it does make it stick to the fish better. I have made this with both tilapia and swai.

Great flavor! Sett off the fire alarm twice because of the broiling. I truly hate broiling food for this reason but it was worth it.

This is our new favorite way to prepare Tilapia - I followed the recipe to the letter (unusual for me!) and we LOVE it.  I did use fresh grated paremesan, not the detested green can, and our mayonnaise is made from olive oil.  I served this with another Allrecipe, Simmered Italian Rice.  They were delicious together.  :)

Very good! The amount of lemon asked for turned out to be too much, so I added more of the other ingredients to calm down the lemon flavor.

Easy to make.  I pan fryed the fish in a drizzle of EVOO with some Old Bay as others suggested.  I put the fish on a ceramic plate, spooned and spread the parmesian on top and the broiled on Low for 5-10 minutes until lightly golden on top.  Superb!

This recipe was excellent! I made it for my husband and father-in-law and they raved about it. The only thing I changed is that I used Garlic and Herb Perfect Pinch seasoning from McCormick instead of the celery salt and onion powder. Thanks for this recipe.

I love this recipe!  The only change I made was substitute cottage cheese for the mayo(I have a soy allergy...mayo has soybean oil in it). I mix the ingredients for the topping in my mini food processor so it's smooth and well blended. I also squeezed lemon juice over the fish and let it sit while I prepared the topping.  I think the people that had negative reviews needed to start with a fresh fillet. The tilapia that I get doesn't smell fishy even raw!

I have only used this recipe scaled down for two. My husband never eats mayo, this was a long shot and turned out to be our favorite. I used as little mayo as I could and added more cheese. Perfect for a quick meal. Thank you Phoebe.

This was surprisingly delicious. I was a bit skeptical at first because of the mayo, but it was delicious. My husband and my son both loved it. Some changes: I halved it, replaced celery salt with celery seed, added a bit more parmesan, and broiled without flipping it over for 4 minutes before adding the topping. It took roughly 2 minutes for the topping to brown and sizzle. And it was FAST! Cheap and easy--definitely making again.

This was absolutly wonderful! My whole family loves it. Even the 14 month old I care for was hogging it down. We went to a no pork/or red meat diet and I am always lookinh for different recipes. This one hit the spot!Instead of using the onion powder and celery salt( didnt have in house) I used garlic sea salt in the're place. Was great tasting.

Eating this right now. I didn't have fresh lemon juice so I used lemon pepper seasoning and left out the black pepper. I also added a little cayenne pepper. Yummy. I've tried something like this before and added a little bit of bread crumbs to the top.

Super tasty and EASY! What more could you ask for in a main dish? Be careful with the celery salt--I accidentally added more than the recipe called for and the end result was a tad salty. Still really good, though.

This recipe was delicious. I used light mayo and bottled lemon juice rather than fresh. This was super easy to make, healthy, and tasty.

I have made this recipe several times and I still love it. Typically I make it with Swai instead of Tilapia because it's a much milder fish.

Great recipe! next time i would only add half the butter, and make sure the butter is at room temp, my mixture completely fell apart as it hit the hot fish. also use low fat mayo (I felt so guilty using reg mayo on such a healthy fish!!)

I add a dash of paprika for color and 1/4 a teaspoon of garlic powder. This is a family favorite. Even my picky 4 year old eats it. Add a bag of steam in the microwave veggies and you have the perfect meal for after a long day at work because it is quick and easy with very little clean up.

I love that this dish is so quick and easy to make and that I didn't have to go out and buy special ingredients to do so. I thought it was quite tasty and would be happy to have it again, though it wasn't my all time favorite. My husband said it was just okay, but he's picky so who knows. I made it with Miracle Whip and found it was a little overly tangy so next time I would like to try it with the actual Mayo the recipe calls for or even sour cream or plain yogurt. The combo of ease of preparation, quick cooking time and good flavor means I will definitely be making this again!

I wanted a different flavor for my fish, not the boring lemon and parsley.  So I tried this recipe and loved it.  My wife also loves it.  It's easy to make, has a delicious flavor and it comes out the same every time.  What more could you ask for?

A fantastic recipe which I made exactly as directed. It does make a good amount of "sauce". It's certainly plenty for 4 fillets. I've used this on trout too and it turned out wonderful. My kids beg and fight for seconds. This one's a keeper (pun intended).

I used Old Bay instead of celery salt, and fresh basil instead of dried basil.  The fish was perfectly cooked.  Served it with raw zucchini pasta with cherry tomatoes, parmesan, and a little pesto, for a light, healthy, delicious dinner.

Outstanding! Followed recipe exactly and it was YUMMY! Kids, hubby, we all loved it. Its all gone. Was hoping for left overs for lunch tomorrow but its gone gone gone. The only mistake I made was not putting it close enough to the broiler recipe says put it few inches away and it meant it. Next time I will put the pan closer to start. I got my filets at Costco, it was so good. Had enough sauce for 5 filets. Thank you!

This was delicious and easy, but I only gave it four stars because I broiled the fish as directed and it still ended up filling my house with smoke & setting off my smoke alarm. Since I was only making this for two people, I used only two tilapia filets. I used the amounts listed for all other ingredients because I like lots of sauce. (This could have been the cause of all the smoke...) It tasted great though!

I was really looking foreward to this recipe, however it was not very good.. The lemon really overpowered the fish and I think it has to do with the type of fish used. Will not make again.

Love this and it's so easy.  In addition to the spices listed I add pepper flakes, garlic and paprika and drop the celery salt.  I use fat free mayo, a few Tbls of low fat butter, and add panko bread crumbs and sometimes Italian breadcumbs.  I actually increase the mayo since I'm adding the crumbs, it gives more to mix.  The cooking times are perfect.  I rub a little olive oil on the fish and start w/ the bottom side up so when you finish flipping, it's on the bottom.  Great recipe to invent more versions of it.  :)

This is one of our favorite recipes. Over the past few servings of this, however, the recipe has evolved. We sprinkle the fish with garlic salt first. Then, I use 1 cup parm and 4 ounces of softened cream cheese, about 1 tablespoon lemon juice with zest and it's much richer. I also add 1-2 cloves of garlic. Save the cream cheese for less calories, but not as filling. This recipes topping amount usually isn't enough for us.  So glad to have found this! Thank you.

Fantastic recipe and easy to make.  I did follow some other suggestions and added garlic powder and paprika, I also added some lemon zest.  I pared down on the recipe to make a single serving, and pan fried the tilapia in a small amount of olive oil after lightly dusting the filets in flour (it was just easier to do with a single serving).  After both sides were lightly browned, I topped the filets with the cheese sauce and let it melt over the tops.  Tasted fantastic and will definitely use this recipe again.

great recipe-I will try to reduce the calories next time-maybe reduce the butter and use light mayo and I added a spicy rub to the fish before cooking-it was delicious.

Love, Love, LOVE this recipe.  There are times that the mayo mixture seems to leave a greasiness behind but it just TASTES SO DELICIOUS.  You don't even have to like fish to enjoy this dish - try it, you will not be disappointed.  Thanks for sharing!

HOLY COW!!  This recipe is restaurant quality and takes minutes to prepare and cook.  My son is notoriously picky and especially so with fish.  He raved about this and actually requested seconds.  He never requests seconds.  I can't rave enough about this fish.  Even my 2 year old was picking the crumbs on his plate and pointing for seconds.  This will def be a recurring meal in our house!

I'm not a big fan of tilapia - I usually find it to be bland and sort of boring.  Not my go-to fish.  But this preparation is wonderful! No more boring tilapia!  I made this once and then ran out and bought another bag of tilapia so I could make it again!

Fast, healthy, easy, delicious, and tilapia is not an expensive fish to buy especially if you buy it frozen and thaw in the fridge overnight. I couldn't ask for more.

YUMMY!! My husband hates any seafood but I prepared this for lent.  He gave it a try and he went back for seconds!!  Both my 4 yr old and 2 yr old ate it (2 yr old is a picky eater, so I was suprised).  This is now a year round keeper for my family.

Definately a keeper.  The only change I made was I had no celery salt so I used a pinch of celery seed and some salt.  My parm cheese was shaved.  It was so good we were talking about it the next day.

OMG! This was amazing. I applied it heavily and it bubbled and browned to perfection. I recommend using fresh never frozen Tilapia for the best results.

Yum! I am not a fish person... in fact, I dare say I hate fish! However, this was really good! It was very easy, and the results were great! 

5/5, I'll be making it again!

I am not much of a cook.  This recipe is quick, foolproof and delicious.  We use heart healthy substitutes for butter and mayo, making this recipe great for my friend with heart failure.  He is very picky and doesn't like fish but he eats this!

Cooked exactly to recipe and will definitely make again. A great way to cook fish without frying and I think even more delicious.

FANTASTIC!!!  I took someone else's suggestion and added bread crumbs and it really helped the cheese stick to the fish plus added a tiny crunchiness. It was so delicious and easy to make!!

This is a wonderful sauce and I have used it on other types of fish also. If you want to add another flavor try Old Bay Seasoning. But its great the way it is! Thank You!!!

This was awesome.  Followed the recipe exactly. By far one of the best fish recipes ever.  Did not have celery salt but that is the only thing that was not in there.  This is a keeper.  My 8 yr old daughter also loved it.

Okay, not a keeper. The cheese over powers the fish. Will not try this again. Too "gloppy" with the butter, cheese, and mayo. It's more like a cheese dip. Hides, rather than enhances the fish.

Absolutely fabulous!!!!!! Used homemade old bay seasoning on the fish before broiling like others suggested and played around with my cheese mixture by tasting till I felt it was just right.  Served with broccoli and potatoes!!!! Yummy!!!!!

Am trying to make this now - love that everyone loves it, but Step 2 is confusing! Season what? The stuff you just mixed all together or the fish that you're going to arrange in the pan in the next step???! Ambiguous!

Delish! I made it exactly as the recipe told me to and it was wonderful.  I used fresh basil instead of dried and it added amazing flavor.  The recipe was for 8 servings and there was plenty of marinade for eight.  I had some left over so I am going to see how it does in the fridge for a day and try it on salmon.

The basil in my opinion amped up the fishiness of the Tilapia.  The Parmesan really made the dish sing, but the basil/fishiness taste was not so good!!

Super easy and awesome!  I didn't have onion powder or celery salt so I just used onion salt. Came out great and on my table in 10 minutes. Hubby and 3 year old loved it too. Served with brown rice and broccoli.

This is amazing!!  I like using celery seed with it and will try the bread crumb idea next time.  I actually used halibut which was incredible.  Definitely a keeper!!!

This is my new favorite fish recipe. My 2 picky boys loved it. Thinking about trying the parmesan topping on top of a spring vegetalble mix of broccoli, cauliflower, squash and carrots and seving with chicken or beef. Yummy dish thanks Phoebe.

This fish tastes really good. I'm not a big fish eater! This is the second time that I've made it. The first time I did exactly what the recipe said. This time I made two changes... I don't like lemon so I halved the amount of lemon. I also added about a 1/4 cup of panko bread crumbs as suggested by another reviewer. It was very good! I forgot to take a picture :(

Fantastic -- husband said it was the best fish I've ever made.  I used "I can't believe it's not butter" and low-fat Mayo to lighten it up a bit.  Only thing I added was a little dried parsley to the butter mix. 

 One thing to note is that it's 2 lbs of Tilapia -- I had a lot of butter mix left over because I was only making 3 fillets and didn't look close enough and make the needed changes.  

  Seriously this is fantastic, quick, and easy!!

Modified ingredients slightly but pretty tasty. A twist on the usual baked talapia.

Awesome! Very tasty! My fish looked very plain when i initally broiled them...but once I put the Mixture on the fish.....ta-da!  They looked restaurant style and they looked breaded!  As if done by a professional chef...

I love baked fish and this was such a great recipe with so much flavor.  I followed Shannon's version also and topped it with green onions.  Perfect.  I WILL make again. Didn't even taste fishy.  LOVED IT.

I made this recipe twice using tilapia and hated it. I could not get past the fishy taste of the tilapia. The topping on the other hand was so good. I had to find a fish I could use it on, so I thought I would try it once more using cod. SO GLAD I DID!!! I made it  last night, and guess what were having for dinner tonight. That's how great it was!!!!

I thought this was an excellent recipe.  I made it as directed but added as many suggested a dash of garlic and onion powder and old bay seasoning.  I did use the full amount of fresh lemon juice and found it to be quite tasty.   This is a keeper.  Thank you for sharing.

Delicious!  Made it pretty much as is, adding just a sprinkle of old bay & garlic powder and it was SO GOOD!  8 year old loved it and he can be picky, and 2 year old wouldn't eat it at first, but later took a few mouthfuls. Suprised by the lemony-ness, in a good way.  Halved the recipe over 3 good size filets and it made plenty of extra sauce for the 3 of us.

Overall a good recipe. I added garlic to the cheese mix because I like alot of garlic with fish. I hardly ever eat fish because I hate the taste of fish so I usually make tilapia breaded and fried. That takes away the entire fishy taste and is still my favorite way. But the cheese mix was very good. A nice alternative.

THANK YOU for this recipe. I am not a fish lover, but was determined to cook some.  I have now tried 4 different recipes and all 4 times we ate something else.  This recipe is the greatest!! My husband and boys loved it.  I was so happy to find a recipe to keep.  Yeah!

OMG this was so good.  I never make fish because I've always screwed it up.  This was awesome.  Will make again for sure.  Next time I'll try to lower the fat but usually when you do that it doesn't taste as good:)

Great recipe, I only made 4 frozen tilapia so I cut the ingredients to 2 tblsp of mayonnaise and I used Tony's, cayenne, lemon pepper and garlic powder but followed everything else exact. Will definitely make many more times.

Delicious way to prepare tilapia!  My family devoured this meal.  Served with whole wheat pasta and sugar snap peas.  Will definitely be using this one again!

I did as some others said, lightly covered it in old bay before. Did not have onion powder, used garlic powder. Also added a four cheese mix that I had. I thought it was good, very easy to make and quick. Husband thought it was to salty. Thanks for posting!

This was an easy recipe!  I used Chef Paul's Salmon seasoning, salt, and pepper to season the fish.  Very good and I will be making this again!

This recipe is very flavorful and easy to make; I was always hesitant to mix fish with cheese, but this one came out really good. I skipped the butter though and used only two tablespoons of mayo, because i didn't want to much fat. Kept it under the broiler for 5 minutes. MMmmmmmm!

Excellent dish, better than what I expected. Quick cook time and prep time. Even people who normally don't eat fish will love this dish. I added some smoked paprika and planko bread crumbs, absolutely beautiful. Thank you Phoebe.

My family and I really enjoyed this fish. My husband said it was the best fish he has ever had. My 3 1/2 year old son ate it all. I loved the flavor and how it looked. I put our fish on a bed of baby spinach, and it was amazing.  I just loved the flavor of the topping. Can't wait to make it again!

This has been a standby recipe since I discovered it a year or so ago. My extended family has some "discerning" (read: picky) eaters, and they all will eat it. I usually make it as it's written, and have enjoyed it paired with Cafe Rio style cilantro rice.

I am totally addicted to this recipe!! I make it all the time and the whole family loves it. The only thing I omit is the celery salt, but that's a personal preference. This fish, baked beans, potatoes and rolls has become our favorite "go to" meal. Thank you!!

I DO NOT EAT FISH!! This was absolutely AMAZING!!! Made no changes at all to the recipe! My husband and I loved it as well as our sons best friend! My son said he liked the fish, but did not like the ingredients on top! He must have been sick tonight, because he should have loved it! LOL! Will definately make this again exactly the same for my husband and I, but will probably just drizzle a small amount of sauce on my son's fish. A+++ recipe!

My husband and I love fish! However, our 7 year old and (2) 4 year olds do not. I baked this the other night and was amazed with the rich creamy parmesan flavor. I used celery seed because I didn't have celery salt. This was by far the best fish recipe I've eaten (and I've cooked a ton of fish). Our three children loved the fish and asked for more. I think this sauce is really rich so serve with something it will compliment like a broccoli with dill weed or some other fresh vegetable.

Was tired of plain old fish. Glad I tried this recipe. All three kids ate it up. I didn't follow the recipe because, as usual, I didn't read through it first, but it still turned out. I added lemon pepper instead of celery salt.

This is the best way I have ever eaten Tilapia. I have a 3 year old and he LOVES this dish. I love the fact that he will ask me to make him fish (and this is the only way he will eat it)
It's so quick and good that we are not huge turkey lovers so his will be our Thanksgiving meal

Wow, was that good.  Very very tasty.  My wife hates both Mayo and Parm.  I made her try it.  She loved it but made me promise not to tell her what was in it.  If it passes *her* test, it is damned good.

This is a standby quick entertaining dish for me.  So easy and quick to prepare.  I am pretty relaxed with the ingredients so it's a little different every time but always excellent!  I alternate between tarragon and basil for the herbs... whatever I have on hand.

LOVE THIS! I added a sprinkle of Panko bread crumbs on top of the spread on the fillets and it gave it a nice little crust. GREAT variation on how to make tilapia. Family all loves it. Thank you!

This is the best Talapia EVER.  I love fish but getting the rest of my family to eat it is near impossible sometimes and coming up with a variety every Friday can be challenging.  Everyone in my family absolutely loved this!

I had to become a member just so I could rave about this recipe!  Absolutely the best--so quick & easy, & the kids loved it too.  I've had to be on a special diet, and for some reason I haven't liked any fish I've tried lately.  Thank you for bringing fish back into my life! :)

Really good cheesy and tangy recipe. I did add garlic powder, paprika, and dill weed seasoning. I had 4 Tilapias loins and a lot of the mixture left over so put the mixture on one side and broiled it until it was brown. I flipped the tilapias over and poured the rest of the mixture on them. They were delicious!

Great fish recipe!  We simplified the topping to just Parmesan Cheese, butter and mayonnaise with a few seasonings to taste.  We have made it twice now in the last month!  Great with a green veggie like broccoli!

I don't normally like fish unless it is fried, but this was delicious - and so easy!!!  I sprayed mine on both sides with cooking spray like another suggested and sprinkled both sides with Lawry's.  Also did half lite mayo and half plain greek yogurt in the parmesan mix and omitted the lemon.  We will definitely be having this again!

AMAZING!!!! If I could give this 20 stars I would!! It was so good.  I like other reviewers added 1/4 cup of bread crumbs, used becel light margarine and light mayo.  I added the spices to the mixture as well as sprinkling it on the fish and added garlic powder and paprika.  You must try this recipe! Thank you whoever you are that posted this recipe and I am going to try this on chicken and other types of fish to A+++++ Oh ya and I served this with the curried quinoa and asparagus sauted in olive oil and garlic powder yummy!!!

I really enjoy fish and other seafood.  My husband does not.  The only fish he will eat is haddock, so I decided to give this recipe a whirl with haddock instead of tilapia.   SUCCESS.  He literally licked his plate.  He has requested that I make it again in the future.  It was super easy to make, and we both really liked it.  I will definitely be making it again and again.  :)  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!

Okay recipe.  I think next time I'll omit the mayo and maybe use EVOO as it pretty much took over all the other flavors and I even added more seasonomg than originally called for.  Good starting point and now I know what to do with tilapia!

This recipe is fantastic, I too read the reviews first and went with the lower fat content I used becel light and light mayo, I also sprinkled in a few bread crumbs because I thought maybe it would melt on hot fish before broiling but I think either way would be good, I also added garlic & onion powder for more flavour, after I mixed it up I was was a little skeptical it really didn't look that good in the bowl but boy was I wrong, absolutel delicious

So I was a little nervous trying this recipe since I've never cooked any fish before but I took some of the advice from the other comments and added bread crumbs and old bay and I have to say that this was so good!!! We all loved it and this will definitely be something that I make again!!! Thanks

Great recipe! I served it with asparagus and Orzo pasta and a side of salad. My family loved it.

LOVE this recipe!  We first tried this at my husband's brother and wife's house.  We had to have the recipe.  When I make it, I don't have celery salt or onion powder.  Instead, I'll sprinkle a few onion flakes and garlic powder (or sometimes I even omit the garlic powder).  I also do not use the black pepper.  This is so easy and so quick.  We both work full time, so I'll mix this up in the am or sometimes even over lunch break, put mixture in fridge and cook the fish when we get home.  Love it with Uncle Ben's 90 sec rice and a steamed veggie!  Enjoy!

Wonderful tasty meal. I had mashed potato as side. First of all, I scaled the recipe down to 2 servings. I love spicy food, so doubled the spices, used less butter, added 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper, 1 teaspoon of black pepper, 1/2 tsp of garlic powder, 1/2 tsp of paprika and lots of crushed red pepper flakes. I marinated the fish in little bit of garlic powder, paprika, seasoning mixture (generic) and 2 teaspoons of buttermilk for 30 minutes (while the fish was defrosting). My roommate loved it. I will definitely make this again!!!!

Oh my goodness! How easy and wonderful. Even my super picky 10yr old LOVED this! Served this with the Garlic Parmesan Orzo(from this site) and fresh steamed broccoli. YUMM. I used 6 filets. Will reduce the butter and mayo slightly next time for the same amount of filets'. Also I used Cavenders to add seasoning.

I have made this twice and I can't get over how easy it is to make and how impressive the presentation is.  We recently had tilapia at a local fine dining restaurant and my husband told me this was better than the tilapia he had there.  That is a huge compliment!  This is my new "go to" recipes for tilapia.

this is one of the best recipes for fish I have even tried.  Besides it being delicious it is so simple to make!

The only thing I have done different from the instructions is that I first coat the bottom of the pan before I lay the fish on it.  I found that just by covering the top, the fish was bland on the bottom.  Now it comes out perfect.

Thanks to Phoebe for sharing!

Grill it! I've have made this several times using broiler and thought I would try it on grill. I put fish(brushed with veg oil) directly on grill using medium high heat for 2-3 min. flipped it for another 2 min. Put it on aluminum foil and topped with sauce. Put it back over fire and cover with lid til sauce melted. Delicious!!

This dish has been a staple in my home ever since I found this recipe about two years ago.  It's simple in an elegant way.  I think my favorite variation I've tried is to omit the lemon juice (just personal taste) and increase the celery salt a bit.  I think the celery salt flavor is really interesting and is what makes the dish stand out.  Also, this goes really well with some steamed broccoli.  Wonderful, wonderful recipe.

This makes the fastest and best fish.  Perfectly cooked, flaky tilapia was brilliant.  The parmesan mix is outstanding.  I didn't change a thing.

This is an awesome recipe that is low calorie, low carb, AND extremely flavorful.  We use the Costco vacuum sealed frozen tilapia loins which are a little thicker, so broil 4 minutes on each side - then top with parmesan mixture and broil 2 more minutes.  The parmesan gets nicely golden brown and crispy just on top - very tasty!!

This has become a favorite in our house!  Soooo good!  We leave out the onion powder and sometimes the celery salt if we don't have any..  But we've been following this recipe for over a year now and it never gets old!

I would give this 10 stars if it was available.   It was so good, I was picking off the pieces that were left on my broiler plate.  This really is finger lickin good!!  I didn't make any modifications.  I will certainly be making this again.  Yummmm!!

this is pretty much the only way that I do tilapia. it's delicious. I don't always have basil, so I substitute Italian seasoning. Just as good or better. This is easy to make, quick, with vry simple ingredients. My whole family loves it.

LOVED THIS FAST AND SIMPLE RECIPE!!  I made one modification: Upon the Tilapia coming out from under the broiler, I squeezed a quarter of a fresh lemon on to it.  DELICIOUS!

This was really good, my son even said it tasted like a restaurant meal   Made exactly as written, except celery salt, didn't have any and used a little less mayo, per other review, since hubby is not a big mayo fan.  Would love to adapt this recipe a little with less butter since I have to watch my caloric intake.
Thanks for posting it!

It was a bit bland for my taste. I had to add in some additional seasonings to get it to delicious.

I did NOT like this recipe at all. I followed the recipe exactly and I believe the mayo used in the sauce really ruins the recipe. It overpowers nearly every other ingredient and makes the fish taste bitter and like you've added sour cream instead of mayo. Unless you're a mayo fan then I would skip this recipe.

We made this tonight and were quite happy with how easy and delicious it was!  Our 1.5 year old even ate a couple bites, which is major victory.  We will definitely have this again.  We opted for the foil-lined pan, which made for fabulously easy cleanup!

Delicious!  This is one of my picky kids' favorite dinner rotations.  I substitue lite sour cream for the mayo because my son is allergic to eggs.  I use whatever seasonings I have on hand too.  Comes out perfect every time.

Had this for dinner tonight, and realized that I haven't rated it.  This is so good.  I add about 1/3 cup of italian bread crumbs to the topping, which we really like - gives it a cheesy, flavorful top crust.  It's ready so quick, and is a great dish for company!

I am a very picky eater, but I found this to be DELICIOUS!  I didn't have celery salt or dried basil so I added a little sprinkle of seasoning salt because I wasn't sure if the seasoning would be enough.

Great Recipe! Easy to follow. I scaled it down for 2. This was my first time cooking fish and it came out wonderful. I did add some garlic powder, salt and peppered to the fillets when I first put them in. I added some breadcrumbs to the topping as someone suggested. I'll definitely be making this often. Thanks for the recipe!

I love the flavors in this!  I stopped using butter because with the mayo it just made it way way too oily.  I like to add a little garlic powder to the mixture.

We loved it!  You can cut back a bit on the butter, and I don't like celery salt and onion powder so I used a pinch of cayenne and a teaspoon or so of hot curry powder.  Delicious and fast!

Quick and easy recipe, and of course delicious! It took about 5 minutes longer to cook than the recipe suggested. The sauce separated in the oven, so I would melt the butter, cheese and lemon juice together in the microwave first for about a minute, whisking every 15-20 seconds.

Really good... Slightly strong on the lemon, I like halving it and letting people add more if they wish. A little bit salty as well, so be sure to use unsalted butter if you don't want a saltier fish. While good on tilapia, I think this would work fantastic on a stronger white fish such as halibut.

I've made this recipe twice. My wife has food alergies and can't do the lemon juice and not really a fish person. The first time I substituted with EVOO. It was okay, but missing something. This time I added 1 tbs. EVOO and 1 tbs. balsamic vinegar. My wife loved it so much, she took fish off my plate and wanted me to thaw out more filets. This is an easy and quick recipe that I will definately share.

"This is the best fish I've ever eaten" are the words that came out of my fiance's mouth after trying this.  We scaled it down to just two fillets and I added a tsp or so of italian breadcrumbs to make the mixture stick on the fish better as per another reviewer's suggestion.  Also added a dash of paprika and red pepper flakes for zing.

AMAZING! Wouldn't change a thing. I didn't have celery salt or onion powder so used some garlic powder instead. Even my PICKY 3 year old was asking for seconds. My husband and 4 year old loved it, as did I. They were using the leftover topping as a dip for bagel chips.

My husband liked this a lot. I had to half the recipe because I didn't have 2 lbs of fish, and I didn't have celery salt. I don't think it needed that much butter a at all. I baked it at 350 for about 15 minutes. We enjoyed it but I'm not sure if I'd make it again.

I have been baking my tilapia for years since I try to be health conscious.  This is just the twist that my tilapia needed.  I used low fat miracle whip instead of mayo. I also used smart balance light instead of butter. I must say that it was delicious. I have already made this twice in one week. This will be a new staple.....

Turned out fabulous! Followed the recipe almost exactly. I only used 6 pieces of fish instead of 8 but kept all of the other ingredients the same. So I guess I ended up with a little more sauce than people that follow it exactly but I used it all. The hubby & I liked it.

This was delish!  The parmesan topping gave it a great flavor.  Next time, I will try adding some bread crumbs to prevent the topping from sliding off.  Definitely a quick meal that is very satisfying.

It was good but it was just a little too much.  I guess when I'm eating fish I like for it to taste somewhat healthy but it was too thick for our liking.  Not bad by any means...just probably won't make again...

So Yummy! Made it last night.  My picky eater 11 year old ate it all and my 13 year old said "can you make this again?"  My 4 year old wasn't interested but he tends to not like food with sauce unless its just pasta.  Served it on top of angle hair pasta with a steamed veggie.  So much flavor and kind of heavy so I didn't do anything to the other foods.  I used 5 lbs (5 fillets) for 5 people.  I doubled the sauce then realized it wasn't necessary.  Next time I won't double it.

So flavorful!  The parmesan flavor is brought out even more by the sauce it is in.  For the first time every I got a "really good" out of my husband and he nearly licked the plate clean!

it was alright. i feel it desperately needed salt, as it was lacking flavor. i couldn't taste the seasonings at all. i'll make it again, and bump up the seasonings and see how it goes that time, but right now as written it didn't wow me.

Made this for the first time and can't get over how easy and tasty this dish is. I left out the basil and added  some dill instead.  Even my teenage boys rated it five star!  My new favorite fish recipe- thank you for sharing. :)

I find that this is a very forgiving recipe, which is a good thing for me, since I tend to freestyle a lot of things because I hate going grocery shopping :)  The first time I made it, I didn't follow the directions very well, covering the bottom with half the parmesan/mayo mixture before broiling, and then flipping it over to cover the other side and broiling it.  It was delicious!

This last time, I didn't have lemon juice or the celery salt, so I substituted Old Bay and just went without on the lemon juice.  It made a really nice crispy thin crust on the outside of the fish.  I'm not sure if it would have done that, had I not overcooked it slightly, but either way - it was pretty good!

Delicious!!! 
I added about 3 tbs of flour for thickness and crunched up some Town House 'Italian Herb' crackers for breading. It was great!

We now use this recipe as a base for our fish.  We have altered it as many others have done and find it still to be delicious!  If you don't have the celery salt it will still turn out great! - try it and you will become a believer.

An easy great tasting recipe. My family loved it and it didn't require a lot of prep time. Will be making it again soon. I didn't have onion and celery powder; I used garlic powder instead. Tasted great!

Wow - this was good !! And I had to use grated cheese from a box not fresh so I didn't think it would be good. Even my hubby who HATES parmesan cheese said it tasted good :o) will defently make this again. Was sceptic to the mayonnaise never used it in hot dishes but it was tasty.

I usually do not write reviews but I had to say something!  My boyfriend never eats fish but decided he wanted to start broadenning his horizons.  I made this for him the other night and he loved it!! The only modification I made was I added a little bit of white wine to the sauce and reduced the amount of lemon juice.  It was great!  Thanks for an excellent recipe!

My husband really loved it. (me too!) I used some suggestions from other members ..... adding bread crumbs and garlic powder and I didn't add the lemon juice to the mixture. I did squeeze some over the fish before broiling. It came out so nice and browned.

This was quick, easy and pretty tasty but not mind blowing. We didn't put all of the cheese mixture on top thinking that it was enough, but it would have been better with all of it on, and if we would have cooked it a little longer to make the texture of the topping a little crispier. We will be making it again.

I substituted low fat mayo and reduced fat Parmesan & it still melted nicely and tasted great. I'm sure this would work for other white fish. I'm definitely trying it again :)

This recipe was easy to follow. It's a great starter recipe if you're learning how to cook fish.
We had no celery salt, so we didn't use it. Still tasted great. I cooked two fillets with sauce, and two with just some garlic and salt, just in case one of our sons didn't like the sauce.
This recipe was a smash hit with our five year olds, my husband, and a friend who joined us for dinner (and didn't mind trying a new recipe!).
This recipe also reheats well if done on low temperature.
The only things that I did differently (besides not having celery salt, thus, omitting it), was that I used less parmesan in the sauce, and put some on top after serving at the table. Yum!
Definitely a keeper! Thanks for sharing this recipe Phoebe!

All of the fish recipes we have tried in the past have been awful. My husband gave this one two thumbs up. I added paprika and garlic salt. This recipe has made the cut to be added in the rotation.

This was probably the best fish I've ever had. Amazing!!! I didn't add any celery salt though, and I think I broiled it for 5 minutes on each side instead of 2 or 3.

I was amazed at how easy, fast, and delicious this is.  I followed all the tweaks that "Shannon :)" made except I kept the lemon juice.  (Sort the reviews by Most Helpful and you'll find hers at the top.)  I don't know how many fillets make 2 pounds, but this made just enough topping for four loins.  I'm not sure which I'm more excited about: my husband, who normally doesn't like fish, proclaiming it a keeper, or my three-year old eating it, liking it, and asking for more!  Definitely adding this to our dinner menu rotation!

The only way my oldest son will eat this fish.  Yummy, creamy, and not fishy tasting at all.

This was really good. I cooked as the recipe stated and it was yummy. The only thing I didn't like was all the lemon juice. 2 tablespoons is a lot. That's just my preference though. Next time I will cut lemon juice in half. I will make again.

It came out really good!  I'm not a big fish fan at all but the sauce makes this dish.  It was beyond easy that even I, who had never made fish before, had no problem making it.  I think it could have used more pepper and salt but overall it was very good.  The recipe also didn't state if it was grated parmesan cheese or fresh so I just used the grated.  I think it might taste even better with maybe half fresh and half grated.

This recipe gave Tilapia a completely new meaning to eating fish.  I also made a slight change by adding a can of Bubble Bee Crab Meat on top of the fish before adding that awesome topping.  What a delightful meal.  My husband loved it and we can't wait to cook if again.  ******************************** that many stars and then some.

Quick, easy, and delicious recipe. My fiance and I just loved it. I made a few modifications to use what I had in the pantry. I used table cream instead of mayonnaise, garlic salt instead of celery salt, and didn't use onion powder. The result was phenomenal! I served it with steam broccoli and  garlic bread on the side. So yummy!

Simple, fast, and delicious! This was a great recipe, and the fish came out perfect - flaky, not too dry, and delicious. I used fresh basil instead of dry, and garlic salt and powder instead of celery salt and onion powder. Very easy, but complemented the fish well without overpowering it.

I think this would have been good if I hadn't taken the advice of a reviewer and added half a cup of bread crumbs... it made the topping into a paste that was still soggy after being broiled :(  Also, I used frozen tilapia from wal-mart. Make sure you drain it really well as it thaws. Mine got really mushy.   End result: Mushy fish with a soggy paste on top. Yuck. =(

Delicious.  I used light mayo.  Also, I didn't have any basil so I used some italian seasoning and I used regular salt instead of celery salt.  My husband loved it, and he is not usually a fan of fish night

I enjoyed this immensely however, this is really flavorful, if you're looking for a light fish recipe I don't recommend this.  We had to eat this with a ton of rice to level out the flavor, even though it was delicious.

Definitely keeping this one!  I didn't have onion powder, but I wanted the flavor, so I mixed in about 1 tbsp of grated onion instead.  It worked just fine.

This was so very good.  I did not add the lemon juice or any salt.  The topping stayed on the fish and looked so good when it was done.  This is my new favorite recipe!

WOW! This took something that can be so mundane and made it restaurant quality. My husband asked for seconds when i made this ( and he doesn't eve like fish) and my mother-in-law said she wanted to lick her plate!

It was certainly easy to prepare, however the flavor was reminiscent of the flavor pack in a box of Pasta-roni Fettucine Alfredo.

This was really good and pretty simple! I used less butter, mayo, and cheese and used more basil.  I also added a little garlic powder.  Served with broiled red potatoes from this site and some grilled zucchini.  Yummy!

Not like this recipe even needs more positive reviews, but I just had to add my 2 cents--OMG, delicious!!  I've been doing a low carb diet, so this was perfect.  I am NOT a fish eater, but I loved this.  The sauce is really what makes it so good.  This sauce would probably be good on anything.  I used some of it over the broccolli we had with dinner and it was fabulous. I love how it's so easy to make, but tastes so impressive!

This recipe was fabulous. My family raved over it. It is quick, easy and perfect for when you want to impress guests. I made the recipe exactly as it stated and it came out moist, flaky and with remarkable flavor. You will not be sorry trying this recipe. Even for people who don't like fish.

Incredible recipe! Quick and easy. I added a dash of garlic powder but the recipe is great as it is. I have also tried this with a Romano and Parmesan cheese mix for even more flavor. I managed to get the hubby to request this dish. A huge victory for a man who would only eat fish if it was battered and deep fried.

I really like this recipe. I added Italian bread crumbs, seasoned the fish as well, added some herb and garlic marinade to the mix, and used herb and garlic mayo (it was all I had). The crust was thicker than what I would have like (probably because of the bread crumbs). I'll have to find a way to make it smoother but otherwise it was great. Thanks!

Delicious recipe.  I had all of the ingredients on hand in my panrty except celery salt - substituted some onion powder instead and it was excellent.  My husband loved it too and took the leftovers with him to work the following day.

I thought the flavor of the topping was good, but very strong.  It definitely overpowered the fish.  My husband and I ate it, but the kids hated it and asked for straight butter/salt/pepper next time.  I won't make again.

We loved the topping for this tilapia.  I used margarine, but will use softened butter the next time.  A good bit of topping ran off the fish. I left out celery salt.

Followed the recipe exactly, only I omitted the celery salt b/c I didn't have any.  GREAT flavor!!  Both my 7 year old picky son & I loved it!

I loved this dish!  It turned out perfect and was very flavorful.   I had hoped that it might make my husband a fish eater.  The recipe that does that will get 6 stars.

This was a delicious and easy way to prepare fish.  My husband took one bite and declared it excellent!  I, like other readers, bumped up the spices a bit by adding about 1/4 tsp of garlic powder and 1/8 tsp paprika, plus I doubled the basil using a puree instead of dried.  This is definitely part of my repertoire now!

I've made this so many times. My family really likes it with rock fish even better than the talapia. Sometimes we add some chili flakes for a little kick. We don't add the basil. I add fresh minced garlic and even more parmesan cheese. I've even used grated Parmesan when I was out of grated.

Short answer - This recipe rocks! It is easy and quick, even for a novice like me. The flavors are wonderful and broiling the fish makes it wonderfully flakey and delicioso!   In case this helps anyone - I have not always been the biggest seafood fan, and am not a great chef. Due to health reasons I need to up my fish consumption (while lowering some other stuff I eat!) and tried this one. I have now made this twice in two weeks and may make it a weekly regular, everyone has loved it. First tmie I didn't even have all the proper ingredients, I subbed Nu-Salt substitute for the Celery salt and minced onion for onion powder and it still tasted very good. I think you could play around quite a bit with this recipe and it would be very forgiving. Wife said we could have this every night and she would be happy. ;-)

Loved it! I had some frozen Tilapias and had never cooked with it before. I tried this recipe and it was delicious. Can't wait to make it again. I didn't have celery salt nor onion powder so I added some Adobo and garlic powder instead and it was just fantastic. Also loved that it was ready in no time.

My picky "I don't do fish" husband has asked for that fish 'stuff' for dinner tonight. :) If he likes it, it is a sign that it is a GREAT dish! Very good, nice to pair with vegetables and a glass of wine.

This is the first time I've ever made fish, only because I just started eating fish a year ago. It was easy and turned out great! I'm saving this one and will definitely be making it again.

Delicious fish! I arrange fish and put the cheese topping on immediately without pre-cooking fish.  Cooked it until the cheese was browned and bubbly.  Quick and easy dish to fix even on a work night.

This was a definite hit in my home last night!!  I sprinkled some Chef Paul's Seafood Magic on the fish before broiling, added some panko bread crumbs as someone else suggested to the cheese mixture.  My hubby came back for seconds and also took the rest for lunch today!  Thanks for a easy and delicious recipe!!

This is amazing.  I don't like fish, so this dish is perfect for me.  the tangyness of the sause and t he creaminess are perfect.  Make sure you have a big enough pan to do the amount of fish it calls for.  I also double the sause.

I never made fish before period.  I attempted this and it was incredibly easy.  The fish came out juicy, flaky and had tones of flavor.  I can see myself making this about 3 to 4 times a week.

Loved this recipe.  Added Panko breadcrumbs, Italian Flavor, and would do it again next time, but use plain flavor.  I think the addition of that made it a bit salty.

My husband and I are not big fish lovers but we are trying to incorporate more fish into our diet because it's supposed to be healthier. We both liked this recipe and the only thing I did different was to use fresh basil from our garden. It was easy to make and I'll do it again.

Very good.  A little too greasy for me, but that's easily addressed by cutting down the mayo and butter or eliminating one of those ingredients.  Super simple, and a flavorful coating for tilapia.  I followed some reviewers suggestions and sprinkled with Old Bay--glad I did.  Thanks for the recipe!

What a great and easy recipe. we had it for dinner yesterday, and i am having the leftover for lunch today. Yummi. Both my 3yrs and 20 mnths daugters who are picky eaters especially when it comes to eating fish loved it. Used exactly the same recipe just little bit less mayo. will be doing again for sure. Thanks for sharing.

Very yummy!  I added bread crumbs.  Next time I'm going to try it without them (so more like the original recipe) because I ended up having to add a bunch of extra mayo to make it spreadable.

Absolutely delicious!  I did not have celery salt, but I used salt and celery seed instead.  The celery seed definitely added some dimension to the flavor.  I also kept the fish with the topping in the broiler an extra minute to give it a nice brown crust! My husband loved this recipe and I will be using it again!

My husband is a fish lover, but said this one had too much pepper. If I make again, I will do it without pepper and see how it goes. I only cooked a pound of tilapia, so I did halve all the ingredients (but used far less lemon juice as recommended by other reviewers). My 1 year old, however, devoured this fish and ate double the portion I originally gave her.

This was an absolutely delicious dish! I prepared it according to the original directions.  I know the butter & mayo lent to the richness of the tastes, but I'm going to see if I can tweak this into a bit healthier dish.

Even my father who is not a fish person liked this recipe.  Just make sure you put the mixture on after its cooked for a few minutes.  (Once I put the mixture on first by accident and ended up with a sloppy/soupy combination on top).  I will definitely be making this again.

I cooked this dish for the first time tonight. I followed the recipes directions with exception of the celery salt. (simply did not have it on hand). This was delicious. The flavor was very good. This is a recipe to keep close.

This was the first fish dish I have made and my entire family loved it, even all 3 kids. I think I would want to make the fish a  little thinner, as the flavor was not enough just on top. Will definitely have this again.

This was so so so good! Made this for a small group of people and they all loved it. As others suggested, I cut back to 2 tbsp. of mayo and I think that was perfect. Next time I may even cut back more and also lessen the amount of butter to cut back on calories. Be careful not to overcook the fish, it can be really easy to do that if you're broiling. My husband is requesting that this be a regular weekly dish in our household, he gobbled it up in a matter of seconds!

This recipe was alright - I think it calls for too much topping as I made slightly less than the recipe indicates and still it seemed a little gloppy.  The flavor was okay but I wouldn't make it again.

This came out perfect. My picky eating friend loved it. It had the right amount over flavor and the fish turned out perfectly. I was nervous about the fish being broiled (bad experiences with broiling) but it was wonderful. Thank you so much!!!

I personally have never tried this, as I don't like fish.  But, my husband loves this recipe.  I make it quite often for him because not only is it delicious, but it is also easy.  The sauce comes together in minutes, and then a few minutes in the oven, and you have a great dinner.  Thanks!

I made these for a crowd- and even the people who claimed they weren't fish eaters were asking for seconds. Very good way to dress up tilapia!

Another recipe to add to my favorites!  I made this a couple of weeks ago.  I used celery seed and onion flakes in stead of celery salt and onion powder (not too much of a stretch, but they were a bit chunky in the sauce) and I added paprika. After reading several reviews, I took the suggestion to halve the lemon juice as I am not a big fan of lots of lemon on fish.  I used a broiler pan and I had a hard time turning the tilapia and the fillets fell apart.  Even though they didn't present well, they still tasted great.  I went ahead and got the celery salt and onion powder at the grocery store this week and made it again. It made the sauce much smoother without the chunkier seeds and flakes and again I added paprika and halved the lemon juice. This time I baked them in a flat pan and the turning went much better.  They looked beautiful and tasted phenomenal with vegetable rice pilaf and broccoli.

This is a favorite for us. I cut the fat and calories by reducing (by half) the butter and mayo - you won't miss it in the finished product.

This recipe is yummy & easy!  There is always enough topping, although it never looks like there will be.  The fish is flaky and the Parmesan topping gives a perfectly delicious flavor.  Definitely recommend.  My mom and boyfriend LOVE this dish, and I love it because of it's ease and it's tastiness!!!!

I've also tried this topping on chicken, and it's delicious!  My mom can't get enough of it, and it's sooo easy!!

Always a great dish! We tend to like the Parmesan mixture, so we'll use the "8 servings" mixture for about 1 1/4 - 1 1/2 pounds fish.

I'm not much of a fish fan but this was good!  I seasoned both sides of the fillets with Old Bay Seasoning (before cooking and before adding the cheese) and added a little garlic powder to the cheese mixture.

The best recipe I have ever tried. Every person I make it for LOVES it, even fish haters love it. I changed it a little. Instead of Parmesan I use Parmigiana Regginaro and I use celery seed instead of celery salt. I HIGHLY recommend it!

I cut the recipe by a lot so it would be one serving, but it came out great! However, my filets were very thin so I only broiled them 1.5 minutes on each side. Also, I added more cheese, cut out a bit of butter, and added paprika. I also substituted garlic powder for onion powder. It was very tasty!

While serving the Tilapia, both of my daughters 5 & 14 said they didn't like fish, then after trying it they both said I like fish and had seconds.  I made no changes and it was Yummy.

all I can say is WOW - my husband has said the word phenomenal 3 times now :)  I broiled fresh lemon slices with the tilapia for flavor.  Served with roasted brocoli and cheesy potato casserole - Amaaaaazing recipe - thank you!

Absolutely delicious!  My husband and son were not keen we were having fish, but they were quick to compliment the dish and ate it all up.  Texture was better than most fish we've tried at home -- well cooked yet still "melt-in-your-mouth."  No changes will be made to this one!

This is an EXCELLENT dish.  I only recommend a little less lemon juice and I made it without the mayonnaise.  Tastes like it was made at a 5 star resturant.  Very easy to make.  Will be making it again!

Great recipe, very versatile. Made it according to directions the first time and then decided to cut the lemon juice and add a few other spices turn out fine. Thanks

In order to reduce the fat and the calories, I used fat free spray butter (poured) and low fat mayo instead of the full flavored options.  it turned out GREAT even with these 2 major changes and my husband had no idea that it wasnt the original recipe!

Like this recipe needs another 5 star review, but it's just so good and way too easy!  Fantastic out of the oven last night, great today cold for lunch.  Added a pinch of paprika and that's it.  Perfection!

I actually didn't read the recipe correctly and brushed the mix on before cooking and it was still DELISH!  I subed dill for basil and omitted the celery salt and it was wonderful.  I would recommend a little more of the mixture though as I didn't get to completely cover all of my filets with the mix but, I will be making this often.  Even my husband said it was tasty!

I thought this was very good. my kids kept asking for more and the hubby loved it! I think you can definitly scale back on the butter...I made it with low fat mayo and took the suggestion of someone else and added a little garlic powder and paprika. I didnt use the celery salt because i didnt have any. make sure when you put the parm paste on the fish, you let it get nice and toasty (so it gets a little crispy around the edges) .

It was great, even my husband who is not a fish lover enjoyed it, as did our company.  Will definitely make it again.  The only change I made was to add more cheese.

I don't like fish, but my husband and I are trying to eat less meat, and so I figured I'd give it a second (or  tenth) try.  While it still wasn't something I would choose as my favorite, I did thoroughly enjoy this tilapia!  And my husband, who does like fish, said it was melt in your mouth, better than any tilapia he'd had before.  So- thanks for the great recipe.  I altered it a bit, because I only cooked 2 filets, so I guessed at the appropriate amount.  Will definitely be making this again!

I had a similar recipe for my salmon and lost it, so I was very happy to find this one. It is great on both fish.

WOW!  I don't often leave reviews (I know, bad me!) BUT! When I come across something so exceptional, and EASY?! I have to!  It was one of the best meals I have ever made. Full stop!  If anyone hasn't tried this yet, DO IT. If you can get through all the other nearly 5000 RAVE reviews to read mine, that is! ;)

My husband and I LOVED this dish! It was so fast, easy and absolutely delicious!  I was just saying to him how I'm really not enjoying fish anymore, but after this, I wouldn't mind having it every week. I didn't have the onion powder, but it didn't seem to matter.  It makes plenty of sauce and even the next day as left over's was great. I served it on a bed of wild rice. I will definitely be passing this recipe on to my friends and family!

I have never written a review before but this was yum-o. I followed directions except I left out the lemon juice. Not a fan of lemon on food. Next time I will make a little extra sauce because it was great and i want to smother the fish next time.

This was really good, especially over rice.  It cooked perfectly and had a nice flavor.  My family prefers pan fried lemon tilapia, but this is a nice change to have occasionally.

The Parmesan flavor in this was just way too strong. If you're not a fan of fish this would be a good way to go, however if you do like fish the flavor is very overpowering.

Great recipe, super easy. My hubby doesn't care for fish at all, so I am trying to find recipes that will entice him to expand his horizons. He thought it was wonderful and said he would eat it again anytime. This is a definite keeper; my little ones loved it, too.

I loved this recipe! I left out the onion powder as I didn't have any on hand and used low fat mayo.  I also added some fresh crushed garlic.  I will be making this one often!

Made this last night and was great. Mostly used the recipe for the topping, had to bake instead of broil since the fish was still partially frozen. The topping didn't brown but may have been because of the lower temperature of baking vs broiling

This fish was amazing.  Even my 9 year old son asked for seconds.  I used light mayo and I Can't Believe It's Not Butter margarine and substituted regular salt for celery salt.  I also broiled the fish an extra 3-5 minutes to make sure it was cooked throughout.  It had a great cheesy flavor that was perfectly balanced with the delicate fish.  Very simple and delicious!

This was wonderful. We have a picky eater and he said, "I don't usually eat fish, but this is wonderful!" I would, however use a little less butter, it would still be wonderful.

I have a huge box of frozen tilapia that has been tasting awful, no matter what recipe I use.  This recipe was different!  I used the old bay seasoning as suggested and miracle whip(I can't stand the stuff, but we have some, so I wanted to get rid of it) which was a great choice.  I still added all the other ingredients as listed and it was so delicious.  Thank you for giving us a way to eat all this fish!

This was very good.......just needed a little "something".  Not sure what.  I will definitely make again since it's so hard to find kid-friendly fish dishes and this really fit the bill.  I will read over the reviews again and see what others did but this is a great weeknight dinner recipe.

Excellent dish that takes literally 15 - 20 minutes to prepare!  I mean from the fridge to the table ready to be enjoyed. You can add rice as a side dish and have both done at about the same time.

Very good! My partner made this for me and my family. Only change was he added grated Parmesan instead of shredded Parmesan. LOL. So our fish had a bit of a grainy taste to it but it was still very good! Thanks for the recipe!

Husband totally loved it. Very flavorful. Awesome recipe to say the least. Just a slight amendment to the recipe....I seasoned the tilapia with old bay prior to broiling.

Wow. Great flavor! Can't even tell your eating fish! I'm not a big fan of seafood and I have tried several ways and recipes to make with Tilapia and this is the one recipe that I will be keeping and making again! My husband and I both loved this recipe!

I followed this review to the letter and it was absolutely delicious. My best friend and I absolutely loved it. I had mashed potatoes and corn as sides. Mmm! Also, I noticed their was only enough sauce for 5 pieces of Tilapia, I might have put too much sauce on each fish, either way it was lovely!

This was good - wasn't great. If the kids and the husband enjoy it and I make it again I will try a lot less basil, more pepper and maybe some garlic salt.

Excellent, easy recipe!  I sprinkled paprika and garlic powder on the fish for extra flavor.  My husband said that the coating made it taste a little like lobster.

This is the best fish I have ever eaten!  I rarely cook fish at home but this is a restaurant quality recipe and incredibly easy!.  Even non-fish eaters will love it.  I followed recipe exactly but added fresh garlic and paprika as other reviewers had mentioned.  This one is a keeper!

Incredible. We actually sometimes double what is called for on the sauce :x. It's delicious and we always put more cheese than needed. (The advised real parm amount and a few shakes of an Italian blend powder to give it thickness)    We love, love, love it. It's so simple and fast and tastes sinful.

I LOVED this.  It is a great recipe and it is SOOOO EASY.   The fish is cooked to perfection - it is almost steamed and so moist.  I just cannot believe it.  Please try it YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY!

I personally did not like this, but my husband did. I am disappointed, cause I really WANTED to like it. However, I don't think it was because of the recipe itself. It is because I am picky with seafood, and hadn't had Tilapia before. Perhaps I will try something with Cod and Halibut, which I know I like.

Was good but didn't have a bold taste. I don't like mayo so I didn't add that.  Very easy to make and good for a late night quick dinner. Next time will add more ingredients to get a better taste.

Wow! Tastes amazing, it's quick, it's easy, and can be made relatively healthy too. We followed Shannon's slight modifications and weren't dissapointed.

This recipe was a hit, I have never been good at cooking fish and this recipe made it seamless! I will be trying the other reviewers alterations to make it lower fat.  Really like this recipe!

Can't think of anything to add to this--it's my favorite fish recipe EVER. I usually doctor up every single recipe I try, but this is one of the rare ones i follow to the letter and it comes out fabulous. Simple, yet so tasty!

I love this recipe! I cut back on the salt and butter, because it comes out kind of salty if followed to a tee, but otherwise, great, simple recipe to follow

This is a really easy and VERY good recipe!  I reduced the amount of mayo and butter by a bit.  We'll be making this one again and again.

Excellent! This is my favorite new recipe. I also added Panko bread crumbs and I will try it again using lowfat mayo and lite butter since I plan on cooking it often. Yum!

I really expected to love this recipe.  What's not to like? But I didn't.  I followed other reviewers suggestions and added some panko bread crumbs and garlic powder (both of which I love), but there was some flavor that I just didn't care for.  I'm wondering if it was the celery salt, a seasoning I rarely use. My husband really liked it so I'll probably try it again...and I'll leave out the celery salt and see if I like it better.  I'll rate it again after the next try.
5/3/10 Made the recipe again and left out the celery salt -MUCH better. I resized the recipe for 2 servings, but used 2 TBS butter and !/4 C cheese -had some leftover but used most of the topping.  I'd give it 4 stars this time

Made this the other night to rave reviews by adults and kids alike.  I used olive oil mayo and only needed half of the sauce...so I think the fat may even have been less.  Also, saved the sauce for next time...

This was an awesome recipe!  All my guests raved about it.  My good friend likes tilapia at the Olive Garden and this was pretty close to the same thing, but a lot cheaper!!  The only changes I made was adding 1/2 C. of bread crumbs with the parmesan cheese mixture.  This is a keeper.

My most favorite way to eat Tilapia!  Very tasty!  I added 1/4 tsp paprika & 1/4 tsp garlic powder to mixture.  I sprinkled the fillets with Lawry's seasoning salt before broiling for the first time.  Served with a side of steamed lemon garlic broccoli & it's a perfect AND healthy meal!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Family liked it but it was a little too much mixture on the fillets for my liking...next time I would reduce the amount a bit. I think I'd also reduce the amount of butter by 1-2 tablespooons

Delicious!  I modified this per some other suggestions by sprinkling some Old Bay onto it.  I'm from MD so it only seemed natural. :o)  Everyone in my family loved this fish.  Even my 7 yr. old who can be hit or miss when it comes to fish really liked this recipe.  It is so flavorful. I honestly could make this every week and no one would complain.

I followed this recipe exactly hoping I could alter it later to suit my families preferences. My husband liked it but I won't make it again. The fish taste was too strong and I was really looking for a recipe that would cover that up.

We followed the recipe exactly. A simple and easy to do spur of the moment recipe. Very tasty and highly recommended. Make sure to watch the fish in the broiler so you don't over cook it.

so delicious! I didn't have all items needed, so instead of the lemon juice I used italian salad dressing and it was wonderful. Didn't use celery salt. Added garlic powder and a little salt. Was wonderful, fast, and easily modified.

This is tasty, we have made it several times.  One caveat- it is a bit on the oily side, so this is one of those recipes that may benefit from using low-fat mayo.  Alas, I haven't tried it because I never have low-fat mayo on hand!  The dish is tangy and flavorful, and even my toddler like it!  I agree with another reviewer that you can take the dish and tweak it with good results- I often add a homemade "lawry's" style seasoning, and this improves the flavor and color.

This is the best fish recipe I have ever had! I only write another review just increase the rating so more pple will find the recipe. I did make some changes the second time I made it. I use light miracle whip, only use one tbls lemon juice, and instead of onion pwdr I use garlic, celery seed instead of salt, 1 tlbs parsley and 2 tlbs corn meal to thicken it up. Otherwise, it is really good as written, this just my prefrence.

It was okay.... I guess I am not a tilapia fan... it was a little fishier then I would have cared for but maybe it was my fish because my husband says it normally has no fish taste. I would next time cut the parmesean in half. It was a little bit much for me also. But the flavor was great and my husband and my sister in law who also came over that day loved it!!!

This recipe is wonderful!  My husband is not a fish eater and I've been trying for years to find a recipe that he likes.  Well I can look no further!!  He did not want to tell me how good it was for the sake of me making it more often!!  Even my two oldest picky eating kids ate it!!!  thank you so much for this wonderful recipe!!

This recipe is wonderful! It is not only delicious, but quick and easy as well!  I wasn't too sure about the mayonnaise, but boy does it add a wonderful flavor! I added chopped pecans to the mixture, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.

This is an awesome recipe!  I've made it 5 or 6 times already and my husband and I can't get enough of it.  It's really easy.  When I didn't have the exact herbs, I substituted others and it was just as good.  Thank you for sharing this delicious recipe.

This is a favorite of ours.  It is super-easy to make and I always have parmesean cheese stocked, so if I see some good tilapia at the store, I know I can make it.  It is also very quick, even for frozen tilapia.  While the fish is defosting, you can heat up the oven.  It can be on the table in about 15 min.  Fast, simple, and very tasty!

Our family is just learning to eat more fish due to health issues and this went over great... 7 yo son who normally won't touch fish asked for seconds and hubby had me make it 3 times in one week... Made it exactly as written and was definitely a keeper

The flavor of this dish is outstanding! However, we couldn't get past how wet the fish was although completely and thoroughly cooked. I will definitely make this again but will have to figure out how to "dry" it out a little without over cooking the fish.

I didn't care for the cheese/fish combination, but my husband liked it.  I think maybe without the cheese, it would be better.

Tasty.  Followed the advice of other reviewers & added bread crumbs to the topping mix. Used Romano instead of Parmesan cheese.  Added Old Bay seasoning & a pepper spice blend to the fish.  Overall very tasty.  But agree with another reviewer that it was very oily.

Made it exactly as written.  The cooking time was right on, and the recipe itself was very good. I used the powdered type Parmesan from the deli but I think it would have been better if freshly ground. I still prefer just lemon and butter, however.

My wife HATES meat and ALL fish.  I made her try this, and she loved it and asks me to make it all the time.  I am trying the mix out on other fish now, so we shall see if it only works with tipalia.

My family loves this dish! They wont eat any other kind but this even my EXTREMELY picky 14 year old daughter will eat it and even requests it at times! Thanks so much. And I would recommend adding a little garlic powder to it and I also add some milled flax seed for nutritional benefits. I will continue to use this recipe and will highly recommend it to everyone!

The kids loved it!  They asked for seconds, then for thirds!  Even though they asked for more "chicken" I was very impressed with how easy it was and how little time it took.  The thicker filets didn't get cooked all the way through (my guess is they weren't close enough to the broiler), but 15 seconds in the microwave fixed that right up.  5 stars, cooking it again soon.

My favorite recipe for tilapia!  Always perfect and such an easy way to prepare, but it tastes like you put a lot of effort into it!

This really turned out great. My wife does not eat fish at all. But, she decided to try this and although she only thought it was OKAY...for her, just the fact that she ate it all says a great deal about the qaulity of this recipe. It is a great recipe for Tilapia and I will definately make this again.

This was very good.  My husband said about 4 times how good it was.  The only thing I would do different next time is cut back on the Parmesan cheese a little.  I would only add about 1/4 cup, 1/2 was a little too much.  But I will be making this again.  I have more fish in the freezer, so my husband will probably want it again next week.

Not bad, and an excellent way to add about three billion calories to an otherwise healthy protein!  What with the butter and the mayo and the cheese, this is very, very rich.  I didn't have onion powder or celery salt, but the recipe called for such small amounts that they probably aren't key to the recipe.  I used about 1/4 tsp of garlic salt with herbs.

Excellent; used a splash of olive oil instead of the butter and the fish turned out excellent.  Definitely a hit with the whole family.

I make this about every other week and I love how quick and easy it is. I usually add panko breadcrumbs to the mix (instead of regular breadcrumbs) before putting it on top of the fish, and it makes it extra crunchy.

This was excellent, however, I omitted the butter & mayo, used olive oil & squeezed fresh lemon juice into that.  Dipped the fish in that, & added old bay - as suggested- & breadcrumbs to the rest of the spices. I also found I needed 4 min/side for it to be done, guess depends on size of the fillets.

The only change I did was add a little more lemon juice because we love lemon with our fish so it was purely a personal choice to suit our taste. I served with rice and veggie and everyone loved it.

Quick, easy & delicious! I'm not a big fish fan but have made this recipe on several occasions and LOVE it every time. I leave out the butter completely, use fat free mayo, low fat parmesan and substitute garlic salt for celery salt because that's what I have on hand.

Very good.  Followed other reviews with Old Bay and other seasonings.  Seems like a very flexible recipe.  The butter did seem hard to spread, but it melts properly in the oven.

I too altered the recipe. I seasoned the Tilapia with the Black Pepper (instead of including it in the mix,) Paprika, salt and Ground Cayenne Red Pepper. In the mix I added more Parmesan cheese (all freshly grated) and replaced the celery salt with garlic powder. I broiled the Tilapia at 525 degrees (4 filets) for a total of 6 minutes. 2, 2, and 2. My whole family (including my 3 and 5 yr olds) LOVED it! I paired it with steamed broccoli, cauliflower and cheese sauce. I will definitely make this Tilapia again!

I used small frozen tilapia and didn't even bother to defrost it.   My husband puts extra sauce on EVERYTHING - but none needed here.  Thanks for the delish recipe.

This was so quick and easy and, most importantly, delicious!!  I added a bit of hot paprika for a bit of kick.  Everyone loved it!

I didn't love the mayo taste on the fish.  I think if I try it again, it will be with less or no mayo.

I made this last weekend and it was one of the first times I ever made fish. It was easy and so delicious. I would compare it to what you would get in a restaurant. I added some red pepper flakes and paprika for spice as previous ratings suggested.

This is by far our FAVORITE tilapia recipe!!! My husband asks for it often and it never ceases to amaze us! I do not like basil so we use garlic and red pepper instead. It is a delicious and quick meal for any night of the week!

We love this and it's so easy.  And we've used it on other fish as well!  The key for us was to up the parmesan a little and let it broil just until the cheese starts to brown... YUM.

We LOVED this recipe. We used nonfat ingredients for the butter and mayo. My husband went on and on about the great flavor. It's perfect for any time of the year and the cheesy shell it makes on the top is divine!

LOVED this flavor with the tilapia!! It took me 15 minutes, start to finish- very easy to do(and it was the first time I have ever cooked fish!). Be sure to only broil for 2 minutes on each side- as others said- it can overcook very easily. Served with rice pilaf and sauteed asparagus. Will definitely serve again.

My husband liked it, but I didn't care for it. The parmesan was a little overwhelming, and it didn't seem to go very well with the fish...

This was amazing... and easy. I did the fish how it's recommended here, but also lightly pan fried some polenta as a base to place the fish on. Then I actually stacked everything. I swirled some of the sauce on the plate, then placed the polenta, then the tilapia... I added some sauteed asaparugus, baby portabella mushrooms, some fresh beans & sauteed shrimp. I lightly covered it with the sauce as well, and served it like that. I also added about a tblspoon of whipped cream cheese, then placed the whole sauce mix over low heat to help in mix together. It was so good that I actually had to write a review!

WOW! So good. This recipe is a keeper. I wish I would have made more. I didn't have onion powder or celery salt and still was excellent. Make sure you cook it long enough to get the fish nice and bubbly brown.

This was a wonderful, fast, and tasty dish.  My family loved it, including my 17-year old daughter who picks over everything.  I made no changes to the recipe, but I did sprinkle just a little shredded parm on top of the fish after I had spooned the sauce over it before I put it in for the final broil.  Delicious!  I will make this again and again.

This was my first attempt at cooking fish and I was very pleased. This recipe is very easy and has a GREAT flavor-not at all fishy. I used light mayo and a little less butter and could not tell that it was any different. I will definitely make this again. I think next time I will try adding bread crumbs like someone else mentioned for a crunchy coating.

Do NOT like fish! - but know how healthy they are for me & my family. This recipe makes the best of fish as I found the sauce to be full of wonderful flavour! The fish was perfectly cooked and the taste made it well worth while! Would easily do it again - even though I DON'T like fish....did I say that??

This one is a winner; my teenage son who likes most fish but doesn't generally like tilapia told me that if I always make it this way, he'll happily eat it.  Followed recipe almost as is (did sprinkle some Old Bay fish before coating - we're from Baltimore so we like the Old Bay!).

*Drool* I better buy stock in Tilapia because this recipe is going to be on my menu at least once a week. The only thing I changed was that I added a cup of Parmesan but only becasue my husband needs to belong to Parmesan Anonymous. I can't express enough how good this recipe is!

If I ordered this at a restaurant I would be very pleased. It was tasty! I don't measure, so I probably used a little extra red pepper and I thought the little extra spice was nice. The only adjustments I made were using celery salt and celery seed (sprinkles of each - I only made 2 filets), adding a bit of bread crumbs, and tossing in some garlic powder because we love garlic. Oh, and I rubbed the fish with Old Bay. I think I'm going to use it next time as a shrimp topping. Yum!

With a few modifications, this has become our all time favorite tilapia recipe. Per other reviewer suggestions I added 1/2 cup italian bread crumbs, and 1/4 tsp each of paprika and garlic powder to the cheese mixture and that made it perfect. Even my picky 3 yr old will eat this.  Thank you!

Okay i make this a lot! It's so quick and easy! It's so rich and flavorful...I don't modify a whole lot , but instead of the lemon juice, i use a liquid margarita mix. I had some left over and thought I'd give it a try...even better!

Delicious & in under 20 Min. I used Cholesterol Free butter, freshly squeezed lemon juice(didn't have other!) and I also added some garlic powder.

I was a little hesitant to make this recipe at first. I am not much of a cheese fan. However, this was one of the best fish recipes I have ever tried! Absolutely delicious!

Excellent recipe!  The majority of the flavor comes from the Parmesan, so the stronger the cheese the more potent the flavor.  I broiled .5 lb. of tilapia on high for 2 minutes, put on the cheese spread, then broiled for an additional 3 minutes.  The fish came out perfectly.

Never liked tilapia before I tried preparing it this way.  The whole family loved it.  This would be great with any fish.

OMG... so good!!  Had it with wild rice and grilled asparagus.  It totally made a plain fish not so plain anymore.  Hubby loved it and said for me to add it to the regular rotation.  Will also be trying it on grilled steak.

This recipe was SO easy and simple. My friends absolutely loved it and kept trying to scoop up more sauce! Pairs well with wild rice and some greens on the side to balance out the richness. I am definitely making this again!!

So quick, easy and delicious. We have this all the time. I think the topping would be good on other stuff, too. We're gonna try it on chicken, pork chops, hamburger patties and more.

Wonderful!  I made this just as the recipe suggests, using some frozen tilapia fillets.  The sauce gave the tilapia a great flavor and even my six year old asked for seconds.  I cooked 2 minutes, flipped for 2 minutes and then cooked 2 more after adding the sauce.  Perfect.  Beware, though, that if you put your pan too close to your oven's heating element that popping butter can cause quite a bit of smoke.  (I had this maybe 3-4 inches from the top as suggested.)

I loved this fish, my wife and teenage boys were not that impressed. I used lime instead of lemon. We used the leftover to make fish tacos that everyone enjoyed.

This is my favorite way to eat fish.  If the fish is fresh, you've got an amazing meal.  I usually only cook 1 pound of fish so I cut the recipe in half.  Yummy!

Served nearly once a week in my home.  Quick and easy meal- great dish to cook with little effort after a long hard day at work  .... and DELICIOUS!  (I add a sprinkle of Old Bay Blackening Seasoning to each side for a little extra something while broiling- recommended!)

This was tasty! Low cals but satisfying. I ended up only making 2 filets for my boyfriend and I so I had extra topping. Don't be discouraged if it falls off the edges and get's really brown in the pan, there is still enough on top of the fish!

Great recipe that works with other fish, too, including fresh water fish like perch.  One word of warning: Think of it like a special treat -- otherwise, instead of adding healthy fats to your diet, you'll be adding some really detrimental stuff that can make doughnuts look healthy by comparison.

I made this for dinner and it was a hit-even my 9 month old had some pieces.  I too used Old Bay to rub on the fish before putting on the cheese sauce.  Great and super fast recipe.  Thanks!!!!

This recipe is definite keeper. I'm move towards eating more seafood and chicken and staying away from red meat and pork. Recipes like this will make the transition a lot easier.

Hadn't prepared tilapia in quite awhile, so I was very happy to give this coating recipe a try. Very tasty. I made a few substitutions--omitting the onion powder and celery salt in favor of garlic powder and chilli powder--and added 1/2 cup of bread crumbs. Whole family loved it, including my very picky 12 year-old daughter. Will definitely use this again.

I added 1/4 teaspoon paprika, some garlic powder and about 1/3 cup bread crumbs to my mixture.  My fillets were thin, so there was no need to flip them. I broiled for about 2 minutes, then topped with my mixture and broiled until it was just browned.  With my additions, our family loved it and we'll definitely make this easy and FAST recipe again!

This is probably one of the best recipes I have ever gotten on this site (and there have been many).  I have passed this one on to everyone I know.  It is so delicious and sooo easy.  It is going to be my staple for tilapia for sure.

My 15 year old son is learning to cook. He enjoys trying new things. We bought fresh Tilapia at  our local Asian market. He filleted it and everything. He pulled this recipe off the internet and made this all on his own. WONDERFUL. It is an easy recipe that is very tasty and quick. He watched the fish like a hawk so it would not burn and it turned out great.  I even took picture of him with it. Nice presentation, mellow flavor. Will do again for sure.

My family loves the Tilapia prepared this way. Very tender and full of flavor with out overwhelming the fish. I use my toaster over to make these saves money on heating a conventional oven. I did substitute Simply Best butter substitute for the butter and the family cannot even tell. Thank you for the recipe. I plan on making it many times over.

I think this was very good. My husband and I will definitely be broiling fish more often. Cooked to perfection with the recommended times, The only thing I did differently was I added bread crumbs to the mix, because of a suggestion, and it made it too thick to spread. So I guess suggestions for spreading or applying the Parmesan to the fish for us newbies @ cooking.

This was delicious!!!  I served it on Christmas Eve and didn't have celery salt so I added a bit of Lawry's seasoned salt.  Even my kids liked it.  I always salt and pepper fish on both sides before I cook it so I recommend doing that in this recipe.

This was the first fish dish I ever cooked - and it turned out wonderful! This recipe has lots of flavor. I halved the recipe, and cooked the fish 2 minutes on each side, and 2 more minutes with cheese sauce. Delicious!

My husband and I have been making this for a while now.  It seemed only right to give it a review!  My only coment is to make sure you have a nice piece of fish.  We never use celerey salt since we don't own any.  We substitute garlic salt and it's very tasty.

Was very easy to make and had all ingredients on hand.  Found it to be far too salty for me, might try it again with more lemon and less parm.

Absolutely delicious.  I added some breadcrumbs to the butter and cheese mixture, which gave it a nice texture. Better than any I've had in restaurants.

We really enjoy this recipe! I found this while looking for something that might make my husband eat fish once in a while, and this did it. Just last night he said he'll keep eating it, if I keep making this recipe - works for me! His comment was that Tilapia (and most other fish) tastes too 'fishy', but that with this parmesan topping, it tasted great. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great variation for tilapia!  I don't believe that the cheese overpowered the fish at all, it complemented it very nicely.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was pretty awesome.  I just threw 3 frozen filets in a baking dish.  I mixed a smaller batch of the sauce, but went heavy on the parmesan, butter, and lemon juice.  After baking the filets at 425 for 20 minutes, I spooned the sauce on top, cranked the oven to 500 and baked it for another 10 minutes.  Everyone loved it - even the picky 12 year old!

DEEELIcious. My husband does not like tilapia and he couldn't get enough. It melted in our mouths. I did season it with old bay and garlic powder before putting in the oven. Everything else just as the recipe says. Yummy!

Delicious! Used horseradish sauce in place of the mayo and was great. Added more zip. We eat a ton of fish and this is by far our new favorite way to eat Tilapia.

Most of my family hates fish, but they all loved this and even we back for seconds. It was perfect, and the cooking times worked out great. it was moist and flakey. We will have this again with out a doubt.

The sauce has wonderful flavor that doesn't overpower the light fish.  I sometimes leave out ingredients like the celery salt, and still get success.

This is so easy and really flavorful.  I left out celery salt and replaced with garlic.  Also mixed a little panko before putting on fish and sprinkled a little more after spreading the mixture so it wouldn't melt off.

Really, really tasty. Only problem (and why only 4 and not 5 stars) is it's inconsistent. Don't know why, but it comes out different every time i make it. Think it may have something to do with the temperature of the butter.

YUMMY!  I make tilapia alot but usually just use dill or lemon or Old Bay.  This was more like what you would get at a fine restaurant!  I did decrease the amount of butter to 3 T. and would probably cut back even more.

This recipe was a very pleasant surpise!  My husband generally won't eat Tilapia, but after tasting this recipe he had a second piece and suggested that I keep this receipe.  The only changes I made were to add 1/2 cup of bread crumbs, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, and 1/4 tsp paprika.  I heated up the leftovers for lunch today and they were just as good the second day.  Thanks for such a great recipe.

We really liked this.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I may add just a touch of Old Bay, but otherwise wouldn't change a thing.  UPDATE: I've made this several times since my first review.  I cut calories by making this with Smart Balance butter and Smart Balance mayo.

This was my first time cooking tilapia and, although i really enjoyed the parmesan coating, i didn't care for the tilapia. I will make this again using a different fish, maybe cod or haddock.

Great recipe! As other suggested, I substituted half of the parm cheese with bread crumbs, also I didn't have any celery salt, so I substituted garlic salt and minced onion rather then onion powder. Also, a dash of paprika made the color nice.

So easy and so GOOD! I've made this several times... I definately suggest seasoning the fish with some sort of seafood seasoning first, it makes it even better! YUM.

I made this dish one night when I was cramped for time. I was Impressed with the ease of preparation and the finished product. Start to finish 30 minutes.  I don't know how healthy this meal is , I've heard Talapia is not the healthiest choice of fish. I guess the whole farm raised fish thing is a bad idea. I have to admit it was tasty. My wife was Impressed, and she is not very hard to please when it comes to experimenting with new recipes.

Amazing dish. I tried this with bread crumbs, paprika and garlic powder as recommended by one review, and it was so delicious, I couldn't stop eating. Excellent recipe. One of my favourites so far. I'll try it again soon.

This recipe was soooooo good.  I didn't have onion powder on hand so I grated a little onion, added a little garlic powder and only used 2 Tbsp of butter.  My husband raved about it and I will be using the topping to stuff mushrooms next.  Definitely a keeper!

I don't care for fish, but this was fabulous! Everyone in my family gobbled this down. I used the advise of others and seasoned the tilapia with old bay seasoning first and I also added garlic powder and paprika to the topping mix. The two people who don't even like fish felt that the topping was a bit overpowering, so we scraped some of it off. The rest who actually like fish said that it was terrific as is and don't change a thing. I would have thought that it would have been the other way around-lol. When I suggested that I might use less topping the next time, I was met with cries of "No way! It's perfect as it is!" My son-law is excited to try this recipe with other types of fish. I agree that this would be great on any fish. For me to enjoy this was incredible, but for my 10-year old daughter to like it was absolutely amazing! Thank you so very much for the perfect way to prepare fish that everyone can enjoy!

Awesome recipe! So easy. I am not very comfortable with cooking fish and now I can add this to our rotation. The only change I made was to add breadcrumbs to help bind the topping. Yummy!

This was very easy to make and super quick. I can imagine this recipe for different types of fish, too. I didn't have celery salt so I used lemon pepper and thought it was perfectly delicious. I'll definitely be making this one again! Very economical.

The mayo topping in this recipe gives some much-needed flavor to an otherwise rather bland fish.  I had difficulty turning the fish over and felt it could have benefited from another minute or two of cooking.  However, my husband loved it, so I'll definitely be making this again.  Be sure to use shredded parmesan cheese rather than the finely grated -- the texture and better flavor will improve the taste.

This was very good and tastey.  I am not a big fish eater but I cook it for my husband and eat it too when we have it.  I was very pleased with it and will have it again.  I made it as directed except to use celery seed instead of celery salt.

I made this last night for my husband and myself and it was AWESOME!!!  I have been looking for a great way to make Tilapia and this is IT! :)  Like other reviewers mentioned, I added Old Bay Seasoning to the fish before broiling it.  Next time I think i will add the bread crumbs to the mix so that it will stick better to the fish!  LOVE IT, LOVE IT!!!!!

I actually enjoyed this. I made a few changed though. I used lime, no celery salt or pepper. I used the parmesan cheese in the bottle for the mix and put cheddar jack mix on top. And it was lovely.

Mmmmm...this was a quick, easy dish that my husband and I loved.  The topping thinned out in the oven and browned and sizzled which made the dish look great.  The flavor kept us going back for more, I loved the tang!  On the advice of previous reviewers I substituted garlic powder for the celery salt.  I would have liked to have used fresh garlic and onion instead of powdered, but it would have burned under the broiler, so the powders ended up being the best.  The only drawback to this recipe is the amount of saturated fat in it.  Otherwise, lots of stars!

I've prepared this many times and have passed the recipe on to others.   It is absolutely delicous.  You can use almost any kind of fish.  I've made it with blue gills, crappies, salmon and more.   It is even better the next day when you re-heat it.  I'm happy to see that it's the recipe of the day as it made its first appearance years ago and is obviously VERY popular!

My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed this tilapia.  Definitely a keeper. I pretty much followed the recipe exactly and ended up with delicious fish.  I highly recommend this recipe.

This is the best new recipe that I have found in a long time!  I make it just the way it says.....sometimes adding paprika for color :)  and I dont do exact measurements....But I mean c'mon its a sauce....the more the better :).  Even people who claim to hate fish love this fish.  Try it......its great!

My husband thought this was really good while I thought it was just okay.  I thought the topping was too lemony for my tastes.  I will try it again, but will reduce or omit the lemon juice.  Very easy to make!

This was the best fish I've ever had hands down.  It has become a weekly staple meal.  Not only that, but it's also a very cheap supper.  Try lemon garlic steamed carrots and broccoli on the side to really finish the meal. The sauce and method of cooking is also delicious with ANY fish.  We've tried fresh rainbow trout, northern pike and walleye with this sauce.  All were delicious.  The pike tasting most like the tilapia, but only if caught in cold waters. 5/5 without question.  I VERY lightly rubbed the filets with Old Bay Seasoning before the first broil, 1 teaspoon for 3 filets.  It was just a subtle hint of spice that helps tone down the cheesiness a little bit.

I used the mayo, butter, celery salt and onion powder, but then I used the McCormick Lemon Pepper Herb mix instead of the ground pepper, lemon juice and dried basil.  My mom was visiting that night and asked for the recipe and the 8 year old said this was the best fish he ever had.  Kudos on posting a fantastic recipe!

Great flavor!  I took the advice of another reviewer and added some bread crumbs to thicken up the topping, as it seemed just a bit runny, but I think I added just a little bit too much so it ended up being a bit thicker than I had intended.  Absolutely delicious.

this recipe is great! the only thing I do differently is add a little bit of bread crumbs to the cheese mixture to give it a little crust.  made it once and it has since become a regular at our house.

This was very very tasty.  Only thing I might change is to reduce the amount of lemon by about half, it seemed to have a very strong lemony flavor which while very good may of been a bit too much.

My only regret...I didn't have more of it. :)  Yes, the sauce is VERY creamy, but it cooks into the fish and yet doesn't overcome the fish itself.  FANTASTIC!

I used most of the suggestions that the top reviewer, Shannon :), suggested and also substituted cayenne pepper for crushed red pepper flakes.  With those changes, we thought this was very tasty and would make a great fish sandwich.

This was so easy to prepare and delicious! I seasoned my fish before broiling with Old Bay, and added crab meat and a tablespoon of breadcrumbs to the cheese mixture. YUM! My husband asked if i had bought enough fish to make it again the next night. Definitly a keeper!

This recipe is amazing.  We took the recomendations of putting old bay on the tilapia before putting it in and then after flipping and also adding some paprika to the mixture.  Will have this again very soon.

This was phenomenal!  My husband (who's not a big fish eater) absolutely loved it and my 14 mo. old daughter kept asking for more as well.  Good job, Phoebe!

This Tilapia dish is easy and delicious. I sometimes add sliced almonds to the crust to change it up a bit.

Yum, I make this at least once a month, it's a perfectly easy recipe with so much flavor.  I use sour cream instead of mayo for a tangy flavor and the old bay seasoning as another reviewer suggested.  My kids actually request this dish and they are very picky!

Adding my top rating to the thousands of others!  Made this last nite and it was awesome, I followed the recipe exacty except for one thing and that was sprinkling about a T of plain breadcrumbs to last step of the broiling process.  My hubby absolutely loved it and asked me to please add this one to our dinner favorites!

This is a keeper! I have made this atleast 3 times since I found the recipe. My family is not huge on fish.  Actually they only eat shell fish.  I figured I would give it a shot(as I love fish). Tilapia is cheap enough, if they absolutely hated it, I wouldnt be wasting too much money.  But, they enjoyed it.  I loved it.  Thanks for getting my family to eat fish :)

review change = 2ND ATTEMPT:  my first attempt was two stars due to the topping overwhelming the fish.  My second attempt I adjusted the recipe due to others reviews.  I cut the butter and lemon juice in half.  I seasoned the fish with Old Bay.  Instead of onion powder and celery salt and used a garlic/pepper salt in the topping. I placed foil on broiler pan and used pam (rather than greasing with butter).  My family loved it.  I had just enough topping for 5 talapia filets.  Next time I will try a shredded parmesan. I had a fresh grinded parmesan and it was very strong.  I think a mild shredded parmesan would make this better.  On my second attempt even with the strong parmesan my family LOVED this recipe.  My husband and son both had 2 filets each.

I wasn't a fan of fish until I found this recipe.  It's really easy to make and the cooking times are spot on.  I didn't have celery salt so I used garlic salt instead.  Very yummy!

I thought this was pretty good, but very salty tasting. Next time I'll use celery seed instead of salt. I used fresh grated parmesan. I'd like to try it on other types of fish, tilapia is soooo mild it gets overpowered.

TO DIE FOR YUMMY, i have made this recipe at least 6 times now and everyone loves it.  My husband that does not care for  fish, our daughter also not so crazy for fish she is nine and our son that is 18 months old.  EVERY single person who has eaten it just closes there eyes and say MMMMMMMMMMMMMM.  I have also used the sauce on boneless skinless breasts and it is PERFECT.  I can not say enough how much we love this recipe.

WOW! So simple and so delicious.  I only cooked one pound (four fillets) of Tilapia so I halved the recipe and had just enough topping.  I also made the following changes: decreased the fat by using only one tbsp of light butter & light mayonnaise and sprinkled both sides with Old Bay seasoning, as others suggested.  The fresh, succulent taste completely livened up this otherwise dull fish.  I'll definitely make this one again!

AMAZING!  I made some changes to the recipe however that I found from other comments, but I knew my family liked it when my husband asked for more and my 2 year old started crying when we ran out!  I have never been able to get him to eat Tilapia before!  The flavor and cheese really covered up that fishy taste tilapia has!

We've used this twice. The 1st time I followed it, it was excellent, the 2nd time I used no butter, dash of olive oil instead, fresh basil chopped, fresh chopped parsley, and mix of lemon & lime juice, and it was even better! 5 star all the way. Served it with wheat noodles tossed with veggies, fresh parm cheese, basil and parsley -- delicious!

The recipe is good. However, I would suggest seasoning the tilapia lightly in addition to the mixture and yes the fresh parmesan would have made the dish better.

We love this recipe, as we love Tilapia!  I made the following adjustments and thus far we've stuck with the altered version.  I sub'd the celery salt w/celery seed, cut back to just under 1/4 cup butter, used real parm, freshly grated and added 1/4 tsp. adobe from the chipotle' can!  The family loves this version and it pairs well with anything!  It also makes a wonderful sammy w/cilantro mayo...YUM!!   :)..

I didn't think I liked tilapia, but I made this last night and it is very flavorful!  Next time I think I will add some red pepper flakes to spice it up even further.  The fish paired well with my mixed greens and feta salad.  Yum!

We loved this recipe.  We had 2 larger pieces and 3 smaller so I halfed the recipe.  The only other changes were to use lowfat Mayo; Smart Blend 50/50 butter; bottled lemon juice & no basil(did not have).  Excellent.  It's in our rotation (that's a biggie!)  We have a box of recipes that gets rotated once we've made the dish, it goes to the back of the index box. Next meal is the one in front. We never get bored that way.

This recipe is amazing! I don't like fish, but have made this over and over. So yummy! Just be sure to watch the Tilapia closely when it's in the oven. It browns quickly.

Awesome flavor! To bring down the fat, I used Miracle Whip low fat dressing instead of mayo and only 1/4 of lime juice since I didn't have lemon juice.  It took almost 10 min to cook but the cheese coating mixture made it so juicy and flavorful. I will add this to my recipe box. Yum!!

Very good and very easy. I always skip the onion powder since I never have it.  I sometimes substitute plain yogurt or part plain yogurt for the mayo.  Many have asked for this recipe, its a keeper for sure.

I LOVE this recipe.  It is simple and quick but very delicious.  I added a bit of bread crumbs to the cheese mixture and switched to low fat mayo like others recommended.  I felt that the amount of lemon was perfect.  The flavor mixed so well with the parmesan.  I'm a big lemon fan though so if you aren't I would recommend cutting it in half.

I had been looking for a new tilapia recipe for a while and when I saw this one I just had to try it; I am so glad that I did because it was wonderful! My husband told me it is "definitely a keeper." Not only was it good but it was easy and looks very nice when plated.

tastes great, cooks up perfectly and SO SO easy.  So why 4 and not 5 stars.. you can't taste the fish through it all.  It's good, but i love fish and would have enjoyed the taste.  It is really good though.  I would recommend you give it a try, maybe cut back on the lemon and the cheese just a bit.

This was my first time cooking fish ever and for my first time I must say it was really good. I added bread crumbs as Shannon said she adds. Next time I won't use as much bread crumbs but other than that it was GREAT =)

Wonderful!  I use this as a basic tilapia recipe and add topings (great with fresh salsa).

Easy to do but not as much flavor punch as I like with Tilapia.

I needed to reduce the cooking time as my fish was done after the second step but overall it was pretty good.  Looking forward to trying it again.

Didn't think fish and cheese would go but this one turned out good. didnt have celery salt so used regular salt. Cooked on grill mat over indirect heat on outdoor grill. Would make this again.

Absolutely LOVED this!  Did as some reviewers suggested, used low fat mayo (all I had on hand anyways!), added garlic, paprika and bread crumbs... was superb!  Even my incredibly picky husband ate it up.  Thanks for the recipe!

It was deliciouse!!!! Everyone LOVED it. I added extra parmesan (just a tad), a pinch of gralic salt, and a pinch of italian seasoning. The fish fell apart and everyone would have licked their plates clean if that was allowed! I will definatly be using this recipe in the future! Thank you so much Phoebe!!!!!!!!!

I have made this a few times over the past few months and the whole family loves it.  You really don't have to change anything and it is delicious.  Last time I made it I took a call and left the Tilapia in the oven a few extra minutes.  It was brown when I took it out and I thought it was ruined but it was actually even better than before!!

This was probably one of the best Tilapia dishes I've ever had. My boyfriend loved it and wanted more but I didn't make enough for seconds, I'll definitely make more in the future. Amazingly delicious.

Very tasty, I did omit the basil, celery salt and onion powder, since I didn't have any on hand. I did however add garlic powder, and used lime instead of lemon. Will make again. Thanks!

Amazing. I will have it again soon and many times after that. I made it for the first time last night and made it just like the recipe except I added breadcrumbs which changed the look to a topping that was much darker, kinda brown but still delicious.

AMAZING!!! I could eat this every day! My sister, who is a vegetarian requests this recipe every time she comes to visit. We have it on a bed of rice, which soaks up the juices from the fish and sauce.

This was really good. I followed just like it read. I love parmesan cheese (fresh) and so that may be why I liked this so much. My hubby said he was not thrilled about the sauce but me and my kids loved it. I made this with Risotto with Tomato, Corn and Basil from this site...that really helped make the meal

I followed the recipe exactly as it says, and I would say it is an acquired taste. You have to really like parmesan and not mind the smell.

My wife and I really enjoyed this when I made it.  Even my kids loved the sauce (what's not to like!) but they wouldn't touch the fish :(.     It went well with the grilled asparagus in sesame oil and mashed sweet potatoes I served.    Next time, I think I will make a few changes, maybe a bit of garlic? I'll have to read through more of the reviews to see what suggestions folks have.  Thanks for the post!

Phoebe, you genius! The sophisticated flavor of this dish belies how simple it is to make. Many, many dinner guests have been so impressed. It's my go-to main dish when I entertain after working an 8-hour day. I serve it with rice pilaf and parboiled green beans sauted with toasted almonds.

Delicious!  I used salt and garlic powder instead of the onion salt, and broiled the sauce onto both sides of the fish instead of just one.  I don't think it needs bread crumbs or anything because it's perfect already.  The butter sauce is really good on top of steamed rice too.

This is a wonderful recipe, very easy to follow and has very little room for mistake (in my opinion). I've made this twice and really enjoyed it. I used mint instead of the dried basil, which I did not have on hand. I also skipped on the mayonnaise. The first time I used orange juice and it was fine, the second time I used fresh lemon juice and it was perfect.

This is a great way to impress anyone with tilapia! Didn't use the onion powder and it was perfect. Will make again soon.

I loved this recipe. The only thing I changed was that I used a parmesan romano cheese because I already had it.  The flavor was great and it was so simple. I'll be making this again for sure.

This was fantastic.  I didn't have any onion powder so I just omitted it.  I did however sprinkle a bit of lemon pepper seasoning with garlic and onion on the fish before broiling.  My husband loved it!  Will make it again and again.

My husband said this fish was "amazing" and thought it was as good as fish prepared in some of his favorite restaurants. I love that kind of response. First time making it and I went straight for the adaptations of no lemon juice and adding bread crumbs. I am so thrilled to have this added to my repertoire!

I thought it was very flavorful made exactly as it was stated.  The only thing I had a problem with was having the "topping" actually stay on the fish!  I've made it several times and when I pull it out of the oven, the topping has slid off the fish, laying in a pool around it.  I just scoop it back up and it tastes great!!!

I really wish I could give this a higher rating, esp. w/ all the 5 * ratings on here.... Made this for my fiance & I 2night. While we both "liked" this, we didn't "like" it enough to make again (at least not w/o a few improvements). My fiance & I only tasted fish, no topping at all! As Carol Hammond did, I added paparika, red pepper flakes, Old Bay seasoning & garlic powder & used celery seed instead of celery salt. The only diff. is that I 1/2'd the amts. since I only had 1 lb. of tilapia avail. (I used sm. frozen (thawed) filets which only took a couple min. per side to cook thru). Oh, and I add. a little bit of panko bread crumbs just like LADYJAYPEE did for the mere sake of cleaning out my pantry. For fear of overcooking, the topping did not melt thoroughly. Extending the broiling time would have done the trick, but I didn't want to eat "rubbery" fish! For those of you who decide to give this a try, I have one suggest. - double the topping/spread or, if you 1/2 the recipe, make the ENTIRE amt. called for. Served w/ Basic Micro Risotto (Drasaid), a bagged Caesar salad & cheddar n' garlic biscuits, this was a nice meal. Thx. for sharing your idea, Phoebe :)

I hate tilapia, but it is cheap so I wanted to find a recipe I liked. This was fabulous! Next time I am going to try it without the butter to cut down on the calories.

I am NOT a lover of fish, in fact I wont eat any kind of seafood at all, but my husband came home with some the other night and I didn't want it to go to waste. So, I found this recipe and I can actually say that for the first time I enjoyed fish. Thank-you! ( My husband definately thanks you too! )

Very good dish.  I did as others suggested and added paprika and garlic powder.  I also peppered my filets before placing them in the broiler.  I doubled the cheese sauce and served the extra over steamed broccoli.

Made this tonight for the second time and it came out better than before.  While taking it out of the oven Hubby asked "who's coming to dinner?" it looked so fabulous.  There wasn't a morsel left.  Made it with rice and sugar snap peas with mint from this site.  Will definitely keep making this as it is any easy and tasty way to add more fish into our diet.

We really loved this, especially my 2 yr old who is quite picky.  We like our fish a bit "dryer" so after all of the broiling steps I baked it at 425 degrees for an additional 10 minutes. Also omitted the lemon because I didn't have it.

We really loved the texture and taste of this recipe. I made this recipe using haddock fillets as that is what I had on hand and it turned out great. I did not have any lemon juice and subbed in lemon pepper, left out black pepper, added seasoning salt in place of celery salt, and olive oil instead of butter. I did not flip the fish as my fillets were thin and not sure that this is necesary. Broiled on high only 3 minutes before spreading on the topping and back in oven for another 3 minutes. Perfect and delish! Thanks for sharing.

My son begged us to get Tilapia fish yesterday in the store. I am not a big fish fan but am willing to try new things. So I bought it and found this recipe. I have to say it was really good. I was pleasantly surprised. Everyone in my family enjoyed this. I did add 1/4 cup of bread crumbs to the recipe.

Absolutely fantastic; tasted like a fish dish from an upscale restaurant.  The second time we made this, I left the butter out, since it was a bit greasy the first time.  We really didn't miss the butter OR extra calories.   We will be making this often, as all five of my family members loved it.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good. I added the bread crumbs like Shannon advised. It made the spread a little too thick though. I will not add that next time.

This is the best tilapia I've had so far. It adds a wonderful flavor to a fish that does not have a whole lot of flavor on its own. It's quick, easy, healthy, and delicious!

This was a recipe where everything just came together perfectly. Aside from adding a little Italian breadcrumbs to the mixture I changed nothing and it was fantastic. At a time when I'm trying to add more fish to my diet this recipe showed up exactly when needed!

The cheese flavor is very strong, but the fish and cheese flavors compliment each other.

This was excellent and so easy to make. Use fresh parmesan for sure! I was out of celery salt so i used a mix of celery seed with salt. Fantastic. This will be a go to recipe to impress in the future!

I had some tilapia in the freezer and I wanted to try a new recipe.  This was good and I will definitely make again.  Next time I will be sure to measure the ingredients because I think I used to much mayonnaise this time so it was a little tangy.  No fault of the recipe....just the lazy cook who didn't feel like measuring.

I also added a little white wine and included the addition of bread crumbs. Everyone went nuts over it. Speaking of which, a light pecan dusting also worked.

This has become a family favorite.  My stepson requests it regularly.  We've even put the coating on chicken for my stepdaughter - who doesn't like fish.  We don't change a thing- it's perfect as is.

I made some substitutions based on what I had.  Fat-free miracle whip instead of mayo; tub margarine instead of butter; garlic powder and rosemary instead of onion powder and celery salt.  The fish was great! Tender, flaky and flavorful.  Served over rice w/ a little bit of parmesan cheese sprinkled on it as well.

This recipe is a keeper! So easy, so quick and so good. As other reviewers suggested, I sprinkled both sides of the tilapia with Old Bay seasoning. Loved the combination of flavors between the fish and the topping. It was even better the next day. I served the fish with homemade tartar sauce from this site,  baked potatoes and grilled asparagus. Marinate asparagus using a bottled italian dressing and sprinkle some garlic pepper blend on top (I let mine sit on the counter while I make the rest of the food I'm serving). Grill until desired tenderness. When you take it off the grill, put the hot asparagus in the same dish it marinated in. Toss again in the dressing and top with a touch of parmesan cheese while it's hot. And you've got yourself a mighty good meal!

I made this using sour cream in place of mayo and without celery salt (none on hand), and it came out perfect. Very fast, easy, and really tasty. My boyfriend asked me to make it again, he said it was really good.  Thanks Phoebe.

Very yummy!  My daughter said it is now her favorite fish recipe and that's saying a lot since I've tried many recipes on this site.  I might just add a little of old bay's seasoning to the fish next time to give it an extra kick.  My family wants me to make it again tonight!

The thing I love about this recipe (aside from the fact that it tastes WONDERFUL) is that it is so quick and easy. I had a made-from-scratch dinner ready in under 15 minutes.  Perfect for a busy night.  I did add a couple extra spices...paprika, garlic powder, and red pepper flakes.  I also only used 1 tablespoon of lemon juice.  Even my husband, who is very picky about the way his fish is cooked, loved it.  I'll definitely be making this again!

This recipe is delicious and sooo easy. I'm a grad student and I don't have time to make elaborate meals, but I can make this with some fettucine and it is wonderful. I actually used grouper instead of tilapia. So tasty!

LOVED this recipe!  We eat Tilapia a lot and I was looking for something a little different then how I usually cook it. My husband and I both really enjoyed this.  This recipe is a keeper!

I LOVED this recipe.  I used sour cream b/c I had it on hand.  Added some fresh garlic to the mix and old bay to the fish before broiling.  I had some of the topping leftover and made it again for lunch the next day :)

This was a great recipe! The only changes I made were seasoning the fish with Old Bay and not using the lemon juice - none on hand. This went well with rice and green beans. We will be making this again. Thanks Phoebe.

I don't even LIKE fish and I downed a whole fillet of this! I figure fish is good for me and I should eat it, plus I'm moving to Japan (seafood central), so I ought to learn to eat fish. This recipe made it easy to love fish! Not only that, but it's super easy with normal, everyday ingredients. And it takes less that 10mins to cook. So it's a win-win-win situation. It's amazing. Thank you so much!!

amAzing! This was super quick, super easy and super delicious. I did add in a little bit of store bought italian bread crumbs and it had perfect texture. The fish itself was bland (i.e. parts w/out crust) so I see why other people said to put some dry seasoning on the fish. However, the crust was so flavorful i think I will opt for more of the crust making sure I cover the entire top surface. Definite keeper.

This was really good! Both me and my husband liked it. I did as others suggested and sprinkled the fish with Old Bay before broiling. I did substitute the mayonaise with sour cream, and substituted the onion powder with 1 finely minced green onion. I also substituted the celery salt with celery seed since that is what I had on hand. I added a shake each of garlic powder, paprika and tabasco sauce. Also sprinkled with bread crumbs after adding the cheese mixture prior to the final broil. This tilapia turned out very good! Thank you! =)

This is super delicious, I made it and my entire family loved it. I did add some garlic salt and some adobo seasoning to the fish..very little. But it was great..oh i added a tad bit of crushed peppers as well. Great recipe!! Recommend it to everyone.

Excellent! My boyfriend and I loved this recipe. I did put the tilapia down with seasoned flour (made specifically for seafood) before baking for extra flavor. It also added a crispiness to the fish. A great unique dish that will be sure to please and impress friends!

Not a fan of this recipe!  I like the topping and like tilapia...but not these two flavors together.  And my kids would not eat it, not even the one who adores fish.

I followed Shannon's tips and added paprika, garlic powder and bread crumbs and this came out great. I am giving it four stars because I am not a seafood lover but I made this because my husband is. This is probably the only fish I've made that I would eat again.

OMG...this was absolutely the best fish I have ever made. The only changes I made were to add 1/4 tsp garlic powder and I sprinkled the fish lightly with Old Bay seasoning before broiling as others suggested. I think next time I'll add paprika to the mixture.  The cooking time is crucial to avoid overcooking. Broil 2 minutes on first side, turn fish, 2 minutes second side, then remove and top with parmesan cheese mixture, then broil for 2-3 minutes more until the top is light golden brown. Perfect! Thank you so much Phoebe for submitting this wonderful recipe. Fantastic!

It was a little greasy for me, but I think I went too heavy on the topping.  I'll go lighter next time. But it was delish and even my kids ate it.  Thanks for a simple, but good fish recipe!

Quick, easy, tastey!  I threw some old bay on the fish before broiling.  Added a touch of red pepper to give it a touch of a kick and a touch of garlic powder.  I broiled it on low for the first couple minutes.  Flipped them over, put the topping on and broiled them on high for the last minutes.

I had never had or cooked Tilapia before and was looking for an easy recipe to try. I found this one and it is an absolutely delicious recipe. My husband and my son now request this for dinner often. I do use garlic powder instead of the onion. For the celery salt, I used celery seed as that is what I had in my spice rack.

My husband and I are trying to eat healthier and less red meat, so I'm always looking for new fish recipes.  I made this last evening for my husband and it was a huge hit!  After reading the reviews I did as some of the others and sprinkled the fillets with Old Bay Season prior to broiling, and substituted garlic powder for celery salt.  This was super easy and delicious!  I will be making this again real soon!

This was terrific. I used olive oil instead of butter and Greek yogurt instead of mayo to make it healthier and it worked really well. I made a little extra and used it as a dipping sauce for baked sweet potato fries as a side.

One of the very first "real" recipes I ever made, and it turned our delicious! Now I make it fairly regularly, and it always gets a great reception. At the suggestions of other reviewers, I added bread crumbs to the mix and used low fact mayo and less butter, but I usually end up adding some milk to thin it out a little. A great dish, and super easy to put together with that's in your kitchen!

I don't like mayo so I took that out. It still tastes amazing without it, so save yourself the calories and try it. Also, I add a little garlic powder as well. My wife and I love this recipe!!

We LOVED this!! I have tried a dozen tilapia recipes from this site but this one blew them all away. My husband says he gives it a 4 since he's not a big mayonaise lover though he admits it didn't taste like mayo at all.

Incredibly easy recipe!! I added a couple shakes of paprika & red pepper flakes, sprinkled some toasted bread crumbs on top of the filets before broiling the last time and omitted the lemon juice. All else was as stated in the recipe.  This was far too good for something so easy to make!!  Next time I plan on using lo-fat mayo & less butter to lower the calories. I can't imagine it affecting the flavor whatsoever.  I think I may use this for chicken too

Easy and fast. Only my child who wants to live off hotdogs complained. And I'm pretty sure it was because of the lemon. Everyone else loved it. Will make again.

This was great!  I tried this on some crappy frozen fish we had to get rid of in our freezer and it even made them taste good!  You could totally use this spread to make parmesan-crusted anything!  (steak comes to mind...)  :)  This would also be great broiled on french bread.  Fantastic!

I enjoyed this dish!  I took the advice of other reviewers and added bread crumbs, crushed red pepper, garlic and onion powder, and paprika to the cheese mixutre.  I didn't have any Old Bay seasoning so I also added some creole seasoning to the mixture.  I also didn't have any celery salt so I just skipped it.  I followed the recipe fairly closely but I didn't measure anything exactly.  I may have added too much mayo but my mixture turned into a paste, which I brushed onto the fish.  I also sprayed the tilapia with Pam before broiling the first 3 minutes.  I didn't turn the fish, only covered it with the cheese mixture and waited for it to brown.  This only took like 4 minutes tops for a total of no more than 10 minutes!  Great weekday meal and very healthy!  Thanks!

Loved it!  Turned out flavorful, moist and flaky.  Used the changes that reviewer Sharon made.  Will definitely use this recipe again.

I did not have celery salt on hand, so I subbed it for garlic powder (can never have enough garlic). I only had the shaker can kind of Parm on hand, and I think that the real stuff would have been better. Regardless, I really liked how this turned out and will make it again!

I am not the biggest fish fan, but wanted to give this a try...it was excellent!  Made this recipe exactly as written & my boyfriend, his friend & I commented that the flavors were great.  Since I am not huge into fish I really, really cannot wait to try this with chicken.  This recipe earned all 5 of it's stars for not only taste, but also ease & the fact that dinner was on the table in less than 30 minutes.  :)

Wow!  I popped this in the broiler and had dinner on the table in 20 min.  A favorite for nights when my son has Tae Kwan Do until 8 p.m.  The only thing I didn't like was the amount of lemon.  It came out to tart for our tastes.  I reduced it to one Tbls.

This turned out ok. I'm surprised at the high reviews. I thought it would be amazing based on the reviews, but honestly I think it was boring. I don't think I would make it again.

We really enjoyed the tilapia cooked this way for a change.  I used a little dill instead of basil.  It came out very good.  I might use a little less mayo next time but other than that I wouldn't change a thing.

I loved this!  SO thought it was a bit too soft and would have enjoyed a firmer fish.  I did change a few things, I added breadcrumbs as another suggested and I didn't have any celery salt.  Both other than that I followed it pretty closely.

Made for a very good, flavorful fish.  I don't often think of doing fish with cheese... it just doesn't seem a good compliment, but this dish really brought a distinct rustic flavor to the fish that was very enjoyable.

This is a tasty and easy tilapia recipe.  I cook tilapia a lot and this is a nice variation.  I did add the spices and bread crumbs suggested by reviewer Shannon.  The red pepper flakes gave a subtle heat to the dish...if you like things on the hot side, I would say you can add even a little more to spice it up.  I will make again.

Ok, I'll be honest -- this recipe is fantastic! I've always been afraid of cooking fish at home (you can never seem to get rid of that "fishy" smell), but when I saw this recipe and tilapia was on sale at the store, I thought I'd try it and boy, am I glad I did! This was the best fish I've ever had and didn't cause that "fishy smell" I had expected. I will DEFINITELY be making this one again.

This was my first time working with tilapia and also with my broiler.  I liked the tilapia, but had a bit of trouble with my broiler.  Once I get the hang of it, I think the dish will be that much better.  The parmesan mixture added a very nice taste to the tilapia.  I am working hard to eat fish, even though I don't like it, but this would be something I would eat again!  And my picky husband liked it too!!!!

We as a rule do not eat fish but this was great.  I actually made it for my mother-in-law who is a fabulous cook and she loved it.  Used celery seed as per previous recommendation, reduced butter and garlic powder instead of onion.  Mixed topping minus lemon juice earlier in the day then added lemon juice before broiling.

Yummy, this was really tasty!  I have never made Tilapia before and it was so good. I followed the recipe exactly and had sauteed sugar snap peas/ red bell peppers on the side. I have a couple more tilapia recipes I want to try, but I will certainly make this one again.

This was good although I think the batter topping has too strong of a flavor for tilapia.

Delicious! I tried making it in a pan, which I won't do again because the batter sticks. Otherwise, the taste was perfect.

I have never cooked fish before (I guess I've always been a little afraid of screwing it up) but I took a chance on this recipe, and it was SO DELICIOUS!!!!! This is one of the simplest, yummiest, and healthiest dinners I've ever made; and now we eat it about once a week.

This recipe was so delicious! It turned my children, who are skeptical about eating fish, into tilapia lovers. It is very quick and easy to make. We will definitely be having this often. As suggested by other reviewers, however, I will cut back on the butter next time because it seemed like a little too much. Otherwise, perfect!

Easy, quick, and reasonably healthy. I added bread crumbs to my mixture, but followed the other directions exactly. Keep an eye on your fish using the broiler... Mine cooked in much less time than recommended.

I add 1/2 a cup of panko bread crumbs to the mix.  It ends up being more of a topping instead of a sauce but it is wonderful!  We have added this to our weekly recipe rotation. Great recipe!!!!!

The flavors of the cheese topping covered up the flavors of the fish and made the entire dish heavier then a traditional talapia.

This was awesome and super easy - even my 3 year old loved it.  I added some breadcrumbs to the cheese mixture, used fat free mayo, and about 3 tbs of Promise instead of butter.  Delish!

I'm making this again tonight. The family LOOOOVED it! It's easy and delicious. I did 2 minutes each side and then 2 minutes with the topping and it was puuuurfect. Enjoy! Oh, I omitted the lemon juice and took a few suggestions from others, like celery seeds instead of salt. It's an easy recipe to modify and it was delicious.

Tilapia prepared this way is wonderful.  I made a few modifications to the recipe.  I doubled the sauce and seasoning recipe to make more topping.  Cooked it four min. on each side and 3 min. after the sauce.  You still get the great taste of the fish.  It was quick and easy.  My husband loved it!  He said it was like a gourmet restaurant.  This recipe will definitely be one of our must have's!  You should try it!

Not a big fish lover, but the family and I really enjoyed the tilapia this way. Didn't have any mayo, so I left it out, and added 1/2 c plain bread crumbs as suggested by others - also sprinkled with Old Bay as suggested.

This is simply amazing and amazingly simple.  I like to serve it with rice pilaf and steamed veggies.  My boyfriend and I usually eat this at least every few weeks.  I accidentally left out the butter and it was still awesome.  A must try!

Great idea for a parmesan topping.  Even the picky 5 year old asked for more.  I followed the advice of others and added bread crumbs.  Leftovers were even good.  This will definitely be added to the rotation!

Incredibly delicious, easy and even pretty on the plate!  I'd proudly serve it to guests, but it's so simple and yummy we've had it twice in the past three weeks and would have had it more often if we hadn't run out of tilapia.  As the guy says on the soup commercial, "Num Yummy!"

Pretty good, although it's a little bland.  Needs some additional spice, maybe a pinch of cayenne.

This is definitely a keeper! I did add some Italian breadcrumbs and garlic powder based on some of the reviews. I also used low-fat mayo and light butter to make it a little healthier, and it was DELICIOUS. My husband who's not a fish eater even complimented me (again) the next morning!

Really tasty, even my wife who resists trying something new liked it. Try it without the celery salt & adding 1 cup of bread crumbs + 3 tablespoons olive oil or butter to cheese mayo topping, bulks it up & tones down the taste so it doesn't overpower the fish. Great fish dinner w/ rice at a budget cost.

I baked this the other night and it completely fell apart in the oven.. (but it was still delicious! I didn't have celery salt or crushed basil, so I just used paprika as others have suggested, garlic powder and regular salt. The paste the parmesan, mayo and lemon juice forms is really what makes this taste so phenomenal! After making it, I think I'll try it with breadcrumbs to make it more crispy. Great recipe!

I loved this recipe, although I would have made 50% more sauce to cover the tilapia.  I needed to increase the broiling time once the sauce was on the tilapia from 2 minutes to 5 minutes.  Once I did that, this turned out very well, and I thought it added quite a nice flavor to the fish.

EXCELLENT, quick and easy!  The only change I made is that I added a little italian bread crumbs to mixture.  My husband who doesn't really like fish too much went on and on about how delish this was!

We enjoyed this recipe and will definitely make again!  I recommend seasoning the fish with an all-purpose seasoning on both sides before broiling the first time.  I reduced the amount of mayo and lemon juice by half and also used garlic salt instead of celery salt.  Thank you for the great recipe.

Fantastic.  I did add some italian bread crumbs to the mixture before spooning on fish as noted by previous reviewers.  The flavor is terrific, suitable to serve for guests, but very quick and easy.

Very good and Very easy!!!!! I used sour cream instead of mayo. And added a bit more seasoning. My son who doesn't eat fish said he liked it. I served with orzo pasta and a veggie side. Very nice meal.

I didn't have celery salt, so I used garlic and parsley salt instead. The sauce was really good. I don't like fish that much, and the one I got tasted especially "fishy," but I was able to eat it thanks to the topping.

I made this for dinner tonight and this was Fantastic. I added a bit of mozzerella cheese to the mixture. My 14 year old loved it so much he scraping whatever he could that was left on the plate. This is a keeper for sure.

I usually don't eat fish, but thought this recipe sounded really good.  I took some suggestions from some of the other reviewers and added a few different ingredients like garlic powder, paprika, bread crumbs and romano cheese.  This recipe was so yummy! Everyone in the family enjoyed it, even my 2 yr. old.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Excellent flavor. I used light mayo to cut a little on the calories. I would love to try with red snapper or mahi-mahi.

Excellent recipe--made last week and my husband asked to make it again soon--had it again tonight and it was still a huge hit! It does make a large amount of sauce, so cut in half if you are just doing 2-3  filets...enjoy!

I copied the recipe exact! I liked the flavors of the topping on the tilapia and the texture was good! I thought it had a little too much of a lemon juice taste, kind of overpowering. But still worth making!

So much for the old adage about never mixing fish and cheese. This is a pleasant recipe, goes together quickly, and doesn't require any "tinkering" to be good stuff.

This is the best fish recipe I’ve found. The only thing I did differently is to add 1/4 teaspoon paprika and 1/8 teaspoon garlic powder. I have used this recipe on mahi mahi as well and it was great.

This was very tasty, quick and easy (budget friendly too).  I was able to make it even a little healthier by using Miracle Whip Lite instead of Mayo, also did not have celery salt, so used garlic salt instead, and it turned out great!  I would recommend this recipe as a great way to eat fish without so much the fishy taste.  All in all a good stand-by to make regularly!

This is an easy and delicious way to prepare fish. The BF loves it. I've used Greek yogurt in place of some of the mayo and I think it's a bit lighter that way. Someone else said you can use sour cream instead of the mayo- that completely DOES NOT WORK! It turns out terrible.

WOW!!!  The best fish ever!!!  So fast and easy.  I'm always intimidated when cooking fish, so usually I don't bother.  I will be making this again and again.  Hubby loved it!  I used "Kraft Mayo with Olive Oil", which saved cal & fat and used 1/2 grated parm & 1/2 shredded and omitted the celery seed.  Excellent!!!!

I am very picky when it comes to fish. My whole family loved this recipe. I did add 1 1/2 teaspoons of vinegar to the sauce mix. I also added some shredded cheddar cheese to the top after it was done cooking.

Awesome tilapia! I didnt have any onion powder or celery salt and it didnt seem to make a difference.  For calorie counters out there, I saved a few calories by using fat free mayo and light/reduced fat parmesan cheese. Highly recommend this recipe, it's so quick, easy and delicious!

We loved this recipe! I ended up using Garlic salt instead of basil, and I also used some dill as well. I think next time I might salt the fish a little bit more. I thought I put too much seasoning on it first, but I think I could have used more. I put lots of lemon juice everywhere too! We loved it!! Thank you for such a good recipe! (And healthy)

My husband doesn't like Parm cheese, so I substituted plain bread crumbs and cut the lemon juice in half.  Used Old Bay Seasoning...turned out great!

This was excellent and easy.  As with all of the 4 or 5 star All-Recipies I've made, my husband raved over it.  I followed the recipie exactly, except I didn't have the celery salt.  I broiled it 2 inches from the broiler set on "High" for 2 minutes per side plus two minutes for the topping to brown.  Fabulous.

I made this recipe to surprise my boyfriend after he came home from work and he and his roommates DEVOURED this fish. My bf said this was the best fish he'd ever eaten, and his roommate doesn't even eat seafood, but said this fish was delicious. It was my first time broiling and cooking fish so I wasn't too sure how this would turn out. Very happy with the results. Easy fish, great taste - will make again and again! GREAT recipe!! Thanks for submitting

I made this tonight for the first time. My whole family loved it and I am feeding a family of 7.  I doubled the sauce because I had to put the fish into 2 seperate pans and wanted to make sure each piece was coated. I added a dash more celery salt then called for but other than that, didn't change a thing. It was GREAT, this recipe is a keeper.

Delicious!  I used my toaster oven, so it took about 5 minutes per side.  So yummy!

We don't eat much fish, but I wanted to try something that was a little outside of our box.  This was a fabulous recipe and soooo easy for a mom of twin toddlers! I used catfish fillets, and as some others had reccommended, I sprinkled the fish with old Bay.  I too found that the topping melted off of the fish and will try mixing a little panko bread crumbs with the cheese mixture next time to help anchor the cheesy deliciousness to the fish.  A keeper in our recipe box!

AMAZING!! the only changes I made was I used miracle whip instead of mayo, since that is what I had on hand, I also sprinkled bread crumbs on the top, it was the best fish I have ever tasted!

Delicious & easy!  This is the best tilapia recipe.  The first few times I made this I followed the recipe, but have since tried to make healthier versions (with fat free mayo and low fat parmesan).  Although it is still good, it isn't as phenomenal as the original.  This is a must try recipe.  Very easy.  My 6 yr old didn't know it was fish.  I love to eat it with brown rice and veggies.

My family loved this recipe.  My wife, who does not eat fish, even enjoyed it.  My father claims it is better than any Tilapia that he has ordered at restaurants. Will definitely be making this again.

Thanks for the recipe!  I made it just as written, except that I had to use oregano instead of basil because that's all I had, and it turned out perfectly.

I thought this dish was great.  It is super simple to throw together and cooks in ten minutes or less.  My husband even loved it and he is super picky.  The kides loved it and so did our guests.  The only thing I changed was I did not bother with the celery salt.  I figured there was enough salt in the cheese so not need to add even a pinch more.

Yum. Before trying this recipe, I'd always shied away from cooking fish. I figured it'd be hard to get it just right, and fish is too pricey to play around with.  With this recipe in my collection, though, my husband and I will now be adding more fish to our diet! I varied some of the seasonings and, at the suggestion of other commenters, added some bread crumbs.  Delicious.

Delicious quick fish, I made a few changes. I didn't read the directions properly so I seasoned the fish with the stated seasonings plus I added dill. Glad I did. With the mayo/cheese mixture I left the butter out. I didn't think it would add anything except grease. I will make again.

Anyone who has not tried this recipe... slap yourself and go to the store buy the Tilapia and make it! I have been making this for about 7 months now. It is one of the quickest and tastiest meals i have ever made. Dont change a thing it is perfect as is.

This is my new favorite recipe for tilapia.  My husband and daughter who both hate fish even eat this, so that's saying a lot! I've made it 2 times and tonight will be my third. I haven't altered the recipe at all because I like it just the way it is!

This is by far the best recipe for Tilapia that I have sampled.  I changed the seasonings,, I used Mrs. Dash, Seasoning Salt, Chili powder, dill weed and Thyme.  I was also a little heavy handed on the lemon juice.  Sooooo good!

This was great. I followed the recipe exactly and it was the best tilapia we have had.

I love fish and I am used to eating it plain but this was amazing.  There are a few things I did not put in since I did not have it around the house like the celery salt and basil, Other than that I made it just as the original recipe and it was great. I will make again.  BTW my husband complains when I make fish and this time he went back for seconds.

I fixed this the other night. It was okay. Nothing like everyone is raving about. However I didn't fix it exactly like the recipe. I did it like the most rated reviewer did. It was very bland. My 18 year old couldn't eat it. I might try it again just like the recipe but I'm not sure.

This was great! Only modification is that I replaced full fat mayo and butter with light mayo and light butter. Perfect! Even my 3 year old ate it!

This was delicious!  My only change was to bake instead of broil, and then once I spread the topping on, I broiled for 2-3 minutes.  We all enjoyed this very much.  I already can't wait to make it again!  :)

This was very very good. I garlic salt, dried minced onion, and cilantro instead of basil, simply because it was more convenient for me. The entire idea of this dish shined through as a great comforting dish.

Oh my!  This was SO GOOD!  I didn't have all of the ingredients, but it still came out delicious!  I used pollock fillets instead if tilapia and used garlic powder, onion powder, ground black pepper and old bay seasoning as the dry spices.  I will definitely make this often.  Thanks! :)

My husband loves this recipe just as printed, but I made some changes for ease of preparation.  I omit the onion powder and celery salt and use lemon pepper seasoning salt.  I also add 1/4 cup cracker crumbs.  I use frozen individually wrapped filets in a single layer (do not thaw), sprinkle with lemon juice, add topping and bake in 400 degree oven for 15 minutes, or until almost done.  Then I broil for 2-3 minutes to finish.  The cracker crumbs add a crispy texture to the topping.

This recipe is incredible.  So good we are making it again tonight.  Being from northern Wisconsin fish fry Friday is a necessity.  With this recipe we can now eat at home and still have our fish fry Friday.

Holy effing cow!! My husband is absolutely stuck on this recipe. However, I just mix softened butter with Parmesan and spices, no mayo, and it is DA BOMB! With fresh lemon juice squeezed over this fish I am in heaven.

I just made this for dinner and it was delicious.  I even reduced the number of servings from 8 to 2, and it still turned out great!! I did not have any celery salt, so I used sea salt.  I'll make it when we have dinner guests as it is so yummy, quick, and super easy.

One reviewer mentioned that they didn't care for this recipe because the topping overwhelmed the flavor of the fish, but the reason I like this recipe is because I'm not the biggest fan of seafood or fish.  I use light mayo to cut out a little fat.

I made this Tilapia for friends yesterday and it was a huge success, they loved it. I paired it with fresh green beans and garlic butter rice. The bread crumbs that Shannon suggested were great. It gave the fish a flaky consistency. Loved it. Thanks Guys!

This fish dressing was delicious!  The broiling instructions were right on, I recommend following them to a 'T'. I did not have the herbs on hand so I used S&P, dill, & parsley.  The lemon juice cuts a tangy pop into a creamy parm coating.  Wonderful!

I thought this was excellent! I didn't have onion powder, but I added a bit of garlic powder and it tasted great. I also added a bit of Old Bay Seasoning during the first few minutes of broiling.

This was okay, but it has a very heavy mayonnaise taste to it.  Perhaps 3 tablespoons of mayo is too much?  Maybe I'm just not a fan of the mayo taste...based on the reviews, I was hoping this would be much better than it actually was!

I didn't cook this enough because I was afraid to burn it.  But that's my fault.  The sauce on top was delicious, my family loved it. Thanks for sharing it!

Very flavorful, takes away alot of any fishy taste you might usually have. Added more garlic parm cheese then called for.

This recipe is very tasty and gets 5 stars for how quick and easy it is.  I have made it for fish lovers and those that aren't (like me and everyone else in my house) and it always goes over big.  So yummy!

This recipe is very good.  I altered it some: added 1/2 cup bread crumbs, sprinkled garlic powdered and paprika, omitted lemon juice and celery salt.  Next time I think I will add some chili peppers or something spicy.

My family loved this.  Said it tasted like a restaurant dish.  I used haddock instead of tilapia and celery seed instead of celery salt.  We will add this to our regular rotation.

Just finished eating - delicious!

It's a recipe that is easy to modify. I halfed the recipe and put over about 3/4 lbs of tilapia. I took some pointers and added enough panko breadcrumbs to add texture. I also added garlic powder, paprika & some cayenne pepper. I substituted mayo for french vanilla yogurt (because of a soy allergy) and it was fab! My 9yo son suggested a little sprinkle of red pepper. 

One thing I'll do differently next time is make sure the butter is softer and easier to spread. I'll definitely make this again.

I love this recipe!  My kids liked it too which is a plus.  The best part is that my husband, who won't eat anything that has mayo in it, raved about it!  Of course I didn't tell him about the mayonaise!

I followed the recipe almost exactly. Only thing I did differently was I added bread crumbs like another reviewer suggested. I think that the breadcrumbs really make the dish (even though they aren't originally in the recipe). Try it, you'll love it!

I almost have it memorized - no changes to the recipe.

I detest fish, but really want to try and eat more of it because of it's health benefits.  Someone recommended that I try Tilapia as it is a very mild tasting fish.  I tried this recipe and to my suprise, it was pretty good.  I'm going to add it to my weekly grocery list. My only issue is that it was too salty for my taste.  The next time I make it, I'll leave out the celery salt and use unsalted butter.

Fabulous!  Quick, easy and delicious - seasoned with Old Bay as other reviewers suggested, and cut back on fat content by using Smart Balance light mayo.  This one goes right to the top of my list. Thanks!

Made this for dinner tonight and the family LOVED it!  My husband said to make sure and keep this receipe handy for the lent season.  A hit!  Easy and fast.  I barely had time to have my sides ready, when the fish was done.  Quick and easy and takes no time.

excellent fish.  Next time I'm going to reduce the amount of butter a little.  But my husband who is a very picky fish eater said that he'd be willing to have it once a week.

This is a keeper!   My entire family loved it, even my picky  teenagers who do not like fish (unless it's fried).  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of adding a spritz of fresh squeezed lemon juice, garlic powder and fresh ground black pepper to one side of the fish before broiling it the first time.   I also added a little crushed red pepper to the parmesan sauce.  Cooked it exactly as directed & it was superb.

I do not know how to cook fish!!!!I recently started dating a pecetarian (fish and vegies only) and was terrified to make dinner for him. This was the first dinner I have cooked for him and it was so easy and he LOVED it. PHEW!!! I broiled it on foil and sprayed the foil with cooking spray...other than that I didnt change a thing...YUMMY!

I normally don't like fish, but this recipe is delicious!  My 5 year old son eats every bite and asks for more.  This is a family favorite.

This was delicious, even my kids (3 and 6 years old) loved it and ate every bite. That's saying a lot! I did sprinkle the fish with some old bay before the first broil and that flavor really added to it. There was a lot of sauce and I think next time I will use more fillets and spread the sauce more thinly as it is a very strong, but yummy, taste!

It's very good as is I think but since I'm Latina I tend to add red chili flakes to almost anything even if it's a pinch just to give it some zest. It was even better second time around with the pepper flakes. Hubby loved it!

I love this recipe. I use it all the time. I do substitute Fat Free Hidden Valley Ranch Dressing instead of the mayo and it results in a perfect sauce to cover the tilapia and rice I always cook along with it.

This crust (with bread crumbs added) is so tasty and delicious.  I have only baked fish in the past with butter and onions, how boring compared to this dish!  It is now going to be a regular dinner at our house.

Great taste and pairs well with some Risotto.  I also seasoned my fish with salt, pepper, and fresh lemon juice before the initial broil.

This was so easy and so good! I made some jasmine rice to put it on and served with steamed brocoli. I love it when we can hit all the food groups! I bet the topping would even be good on chicken.

This is a great quick recipe for any fish! The only change I made was to add 1/4 teaspoon of seasoned salt to give it some flavor. The first time I made it, I didn't add the seasoned salt and it needed a little more seasoning so I added it next time and then it was perfecto.

i was so looking forward to a yummy dinner with all the great reviews...i was very upset when i tried it though. too salty, with all that parm, it was floating in butter, it took longer than stated to cook, and the fish was soggy. ick. if you like fish, this is not the recipe for you!! if you are trying to mask the taste of fish, perhaps you will like this. who knows. i enjoy fish, and this took away not only the flavour of the fish, but the health benefits of it as well. will not make again!!

This dish is simply awesome. I do add bread crumbs for texture and season my fish first with onion powder, pepper and either seasoned salt, old bay, or cajun seasoning depending on what I feel like having that day. I use less mayo and sometimes omit the lemon juice when I don't have any on hand. I love this because it is quick and seriously good. Even my picky fiance will eat it occasionally (he's not a cheese or mayo fan). I made it once for my soon-to-be in-laws and they absolutely loved it. Its like a restaurant meal made cheap and quickly at home!

Made per directions, but wasn't wowed by it. It is different enough that we'll make again, but with a couple of changes. Next time I'll use more cheese & less mayonnaise.  I think it was the mayo that turned me off since I don't like things with hot mayo taste. My husband thought it was a 4, but agreed it needed the changes. We couldn't taste anything besides the mayo. Easy to make & quick.

We thought it was very good and very quick.  Since I didn't have my measuring spoons, I think I may have put a little too much mayo as we ended up with a sauce rather than a crust. It seemed as though the parmesan cheese melted so there was no texture. Even still, it was very tasty and my husband loved it.

I am not fond of fish but I am trying to eat better.  This was the best Tilapia that I have ever tasted.  It was easy to make and it was eaten in record time.

Tastes great, but it's a little tangy and the cheese mixture tends to run off the fish.

Very delightful.  I cooked the fish 2 minutes on each flip.  Also took advice to put tin foil on buttered pan.  Perfect as is but I might try to make some adjustments next time around-like less lemon juice and experiment with spices.

I thought these were great.  Very quick to make and good enough to serve company.  I used walleye filets and fat free mayo.  The taste was awesome!  Would be good on any white fish.

My husband LOVES this.  I've made it several times and each time he raves about it. Tonight I made it with salmon.  The cooking time was longer, but it was just as good.  Next time with salmon, I will probably bake the salmon for about 10 minutes at 350 before broiling to avoid drying out.

This is a simple dish that boasts great results I used a shredded Parmesan,Romano, Asiago cheese mix and light mayonnaise. Next time I will reduce the amount of butter.

The was pretty good.  Maybe putting another king of cheese into it would make it a five.  Parmesean is a very powerful cheese. Overall it spiced up plain tilapia.

Ok, so first I'll explain what I did then why I only gave it three stars. 1) I only made 1/2 lb of fish but prepared enough topping for 1 lb so there would be plenty. 2) I didn't measure the ingredients, just kind of threw them together until it looked good. 3) I didn't have onion powder or celery salt so I added about 1-1 1/2 tablespoons of finely chopped onion with a little salt. 4) I baked the tilapia on each side for about five minutes at 400 degrees, then put the topping on and broiled it for about 5 minutes, until nicely browned and bubbly. It looked and smelled amazing! We loved the taste of the topping, but we realized we don't really care for tilapia. My husband suggested I try the topping on cod next time, so I may do that. So that's why so few stars...we didn't care for the recipe as is, but hopefully I'll try it again with some other type of fish and it will be better. Thanks!

Wow. This has become my go to fish recipe. So simple to prepare...you don't even need to measure really...just guesstimate and your good! I used Fage Total greek yogurt instead of mayo(I substitute that for just about everything calling for sour cream or mayo unless it is a cake recipe...good stuff!!). Also, I did not have celery salt so just used ground celery seed and that was great! I probably used a little bit more parmesan than called for and it was scrumptious! Family raved over it! Served with jasmine rice and grilled veggies with biscuits. Perfecto!

This was very good.  I did cut the topping in half for 1 pound of fish.  I added paprika and garlic powder also.  Just a shake of each.  I also added the bread crumbs and that made a nice crunch.  But if I had not been watching closely the crumbs would have burned.  Will definitely do this one again.

WOW. I would've never guessed that this would end up being SO GOOD! I have made this twice now and also tried it on chicken breasts and they turned out spectacular. I added extra Parmesan cheese to the top after putting the mixture on the meat and it melted and looked absolutely beautiful. This really smells up your kitchen with deliciousness. It was a hit!

We really liked the flavor of this recipe!  Will definitely be having again.  I found it best to cook the fish almost completely first, then put topping on and just brown topping.

I liked this but not sure if I did it quite right. I left out the butter and it was more like a paste. I baked it at 400 for 12 minutes and then broiled for 2. The cheese mixture didn't melt down much so it was kind of thick. Good flavor but I felt the topping was too thick. I will make some adjustments and try it again.

This was absolutely delicious, and very quick to prepare and broil.  My 18-month-old could not get enough of this fish, so I am sure I will be making this a lot.  My husband and I equally enjoyed this recipe, and I gave it to my mom who is gluten-free and who is always looking for new recipes that she can eat.

THIS is why I like the rating system. That many reviews with that many stars can't go wrong!

Like many, I made a couple of minor 'changes'. I used low fat mayo and parmesan and just a touch of butter. Honestly I don't think it even needs the butter.

Awesome, easy and tasty. My kids loved it too - bonus.

Thanks!!!

My husband likes fish. I HATE fish, but I can eat this without gagging. We loved the sauce and will make extra next time. I sprinkled the sauce with seasoned breadcrumbs before returning the fish to the broiler. I lightly blackened one side of the fish for an extra kick. The flavors were nice together.

This is a GREAT recipe.  My kids are not seafood eaters and they enjoy this one.  Great when served with a green salad and homemade bread.  I am adding to this comment as everyone I have made this for has asked for the recipe.  This is a family fave!

I made this and it was fantastic.  I was nervous about the mixture, but I had to try it because it's hard finding recipes for tilapia (at least for me) and it turned out delicous!!

I have been looking for a way to prepare Tilapia for my husband in a way that he will enjoy, and this was it! THe flavor of the cheese blend was excellent, my entire family ate it with WILD abandon! This is certainly a KEEPER, I may adjust it and try it on other meats.

Fantastic and quick.  I had this ready to go in twenty minutes and I started with frozen tilapia.  I just put the fish under the broiler a bit longer before putting the sauce on and it tunrrd out great. My kids who don't normally eat fish this way were fighting over the last piece.

Unbelievably easy to make and so quick too!  I used celery seed instead because that's what I had on hand and added a dash of paprika and served with a side of steamed zucchini.  I also used lite mayo.  Probably not the healthiest thing but it came out surprisingly tasty!  I made it in less than half an hour which is just great.

Hayley gives it a 3 or 4 she didn't really care for the sauce on top.  Make hers without it next time.

My 4 year old asked for seconds as did my 8 year old!  It was so good.  We served it with couscous.  I recomend extra topping to bake with the fish and then pour over the couscous.  I plan on having my extended family try this out tonight.

I love tilapia but didn't really like this recipe, I thought the sauce was a bit too tangy and too overpowering for me.  You couldn't really enjoy the flavor of the fish... next time, I'll just put less of the mixture on top and that should make it better.

So good, and SO EASY!!  I didn't have celery salt, so I didn't use it, and instead used garlic powder and dill (because we use dill on practically every fresh fish we make).  Also used low fat mayo.  An added bonus?  Dinner for 2 cost less than $6 (because I had to buy the fish and a lemon and everything else was on hand).  Thanks!

Absolutely the BEST tilapia I have ever made.  My husband said that a restaurant could serve this and people would pay good money for it. It was quick and easy to put together with most of the ingredients already in my cupboard.  There was some confusion over whether the parmesan was the powdered stuff or real grated.  I had both so I used both.  Great recipe!

Wonderful!  I don't especially like fish and I loved this.  I had just run out of some stuff, so I had to make a few substitutions. Used Tarragon instead of Basil, 1/4tsp garlic powder instead of onion powder, and celery seed instead of celery salt.  Sprinkled red pepper flakes.  I am looking forward to have this again!

Wow! So fast and easy. Husband and son LOVED it.  Only change was to use finely chopped fresh garlic instead of onion powder.

This is a very good recipe.  I just sauteed the garlic in the butter and mixed in the lemon to pour on top.  Same amount of ingredients.  Very good.  We have had 3 times in the last month.  Just have the fish with a salad.  Thanks!

I didn't have all the ingredients listed so instead of poke and hope I used 3 tbsp. of mayo, 3 tbsp of jarred pesto and about 1/2 cup of fresh grated parmesan cheese.  My hubby said it tasted gormet.  I served it with a homemade rice pilaf.  MMMM!

So good!  We loved the sauce on some whole wheat spaghetti as well.  Will be making this recipe often and using the sauce in its own right as well.  
An addition, I have also made this recipe with lowfat sour cream in lieu of mayo b/c we were out and it was also good. Not quite AS good, but it worked without having to run to the store.  Don't add as much lemon and a little extra parm.

Delicious, easy, fast - what more could you ask for?  Reduced fat mayonnaise, reduced fat parmesan cheese and a heart-healthy spread can lower the calories and fat without sacrificing taste.  This is a keeper recipe!

What a delicious meal!  Changed the recipe as I am allergic to basil.  Used the mayo, butter, parmesan, and lemon juice then added 1 tsp or lemon pepper.  Delicious!  A keeper for sure!

Yummerific!  My husband is not a fan of fish, but he loved this dish.  The rich, creamy sauce was the perfect complement to the tilapia.  Thank you!

Sorry, I can't give this recipe 5 stars.  It looked wonderful, smelled wonderful, and didn't taste too bad, but the parm made it taste too salty for my liking.  This is a good recipe for people who don't like the taste of fish.  Maybe next time I will reduce the parmesan and sub in another cheese that's less salty.

I made this just now for lunch, I paired it with rice and broccoli.  I cut the recipe for the sauce in half and used only 2 filets.  Absolutely superb!!!  Sauce runs off, but I just scooped it on top when done.  I only cooked it 2 min first side then 1 1/2 other two times.  Light enough for lunch but will make an awesome dinner!!!

This recipe was great!  I will certainly make it again.  Like other reviewers, I added additional spices (paprika, garlic powder, crushed red pepper)and only broiled for 1.5 minutes each time.  Since I only had enough shredded Parmesan chesse to make up half of the amount called for, I used grated Parmesan cheese to make up the difference.  It still turned out great!

My entire family loves this recipe.  My step daughter was just home from college and was offered one homemade meal while she was only here one night.  This is what she asked for.  I think whatever spices you choose are fine.  We like to use ground pepper and Old Bay.  Always a fav!!  Can't go wrong.

This recipe is a staple in our house. I always add about 1/2 cup of a mixture of Italian seasoned bread crumbs and panko to give it a little crunch. I never have celery salt, so I substitute garlic salt.

I cook the fish on an elevated baking rack in the oven at 350 degrees for about 15 minutes, then put the broiler on high (but don't put the fish near the broiler - leave it in the low-middle rack of the oven) and bake for another 3-5 minutes, or until it's golden and browned in spots. It gets nice and crispy on the edges and melts in your mouth!

Reviewers are correct when they say it's the sauce, not the fish, that makes this dish fantastic.  Still, I had to give it 5 because it's so quick and easy to make, fantastic flavor, and a nice digression from the usual citrus tang that comes with most fish dishes.

I absoloutely love this recipe! As a college student I am constantly trying to find something quick and easy. I came upon this recipe a few days ago after I picked up some tilapia at the grocery store and decided I needed a way to prepare it. I thought this looked tasty so I tried it.
I made a few of my own changes, however, because I was lacking some of the ingredients. I only used Mayo, butter, an Italian blend of cheeses (instead of just the parmesan), lemon juice, garlic salt, rosemary and tarragon. This recipe was quite a change from what I usely eat. (My mom is a very southern cook so I have decided I want to venture out.) 
I have already made this twice in the past few days. A great meal for one.. I actually just had some for lunch along with a ceasar salad and sauteed asparagus!

This recipe has a very nice flavor. My husband and I both enjoyed it. And, it is so easy to make. I followed the recipe as-is...except I went a little light on the parm. I will definitely make this again.

Personally I didn't much care for this recipe. It was very easy, but I prefer a stronger more spiced fish. I may try to tweek the recipe a bit and see what I can come up with.

I'm new here (and loving it I might add).  I read a lot of the reviews on this before making it and took the advice of the "pros".  I added extra spices and the bread crumbs.  The taste was extremely good.  I was worried that it wouldn't taste enough like fish for my husband...who is a major fish lover but it did.  However I think I might use less than 1/2 a cup of bread crumbs next time.  The topping was like a paste putting it on.  It tasted great but was really hard to spread on top and so I had to clump it on as to not tear the fish fillets.  All and all this will be a regular in this household.  Yum.

I tried this tonight but for chicken breasts (which were baked not broiled of course) and they turned out sooooo good.  I can't wait to try this with tilapia!  I added panko breadcrumbs like one reviewer suggested and I really liked the crunchy texture it added to the dish.  I will definitely be making this again.

Very tasty and SO easy to prepare! Defrosted some bulk frozen tilapia, prepped with what I had laying around and cooked it while commercials were playing during the Olympics. :) Cost me 95 cents per person and less than 10 minutes to make.

I am torn between three stars and four.  The sauce is really tasty, but it totally overpowers the fish.  I am a sauce person, but my fiance is not.  We both scraped most of it off.  I think this is a really great recipe if you are trying to introduce fish to someone, as it pretty much overpowers any fish flavor.

This is really good.  It took a while longer for the fish and the topping almost burned but it was delicious nonetheless.

LOVED IT!  My 17 yo son said it was "killer" and that "whoever thought this up was a genius".  I did add garlic and bread crumbs as some others suggested.  Also added 1/4 tsp. sweet and 1/4 tsp. hot Hungarian paprika (my daughter went to Hungary last year :-)).
I'm not a big fish eater but this is very very good! Thank you!

This is a pretty good recipe.  I read some other reviews, so I used the breadcrumbs in my cheese mixture, but I used 1/2 cup, and I think that was too much, as my crust didn't get crispy all the way down to the fish.  I also added some paprika and a little garlic powder. My precocious 4 year old who doesn't care for fish, told me "This fish actually isn't bad mom. I think you cooked it right this time."

This is my fish go-to recipe.  Both my husband and I absolutely love it.  I pretty much make the recipe exactly as listed.  I serve it with a dipping sauce made of 1/4 cup mayo, 1 Tablespoon sweet pickle relish, 1 teaspoon ketchup, and a squeeze of fresh lemon juice.  YUM

This was not for us.  The tastes just did not work.  There was nothing wrong with it I think my family just prefers a more buttery - herb fish..not parmesan.  And I am a huge parmesan fan.

Wow!  This recipe was fantastic.  We eat Tilapia a lot, and it is good to have a different way to eat it.  My husband loved it, and even my kids enjoyed it.  I took the advice from some of the other reviews and added the Old Bay.  Thank you for this quick and delicious recipe.

We thought this was wonderful! The only recommendation we have is to stick with broiling it like the recipes calls. We had limited resources for oven space and so we tried grilling it. The flavor was fabulous, but it never got crusty!

This is great!  Add old bay seasoning to filets before broiling.  I added bread crumbs, paprika, garlic salt, celery seed, and red pepper flakes to the cheese mixture.  Tilapia is pretty much the only fish I like and I'm always looking for new recipes to try out because we eat it at least once a week...this is by far the best I've found so far!

I cannot get over how simple and DELICIOUS this was! My boyfriend is not a huge fan of some fish, at all. But he was willing to try it... and the entire time he was eating it, he kept saying "wow" and.. "this is so good". I'll definitely be making this again.

This is one of the easiest and best tasting ways to make tilapia.  The kids even love it.  We have been making this for years and have used it on other types of fish, halibut, flounder, barramundi, salmon, and we have even used it to broil shrimp (remove shells first and adjust broiling time). Great recipe.  Oops, forgot to mention we only use 1 TBS of lemon juice to cut down on the tanginess.

This recipe is always a big hit.  The only change I make is that instead of the other spices (basil, pepper, onion, celery salt) I use herbs de provence.  I don't measure it, but it is probably about 1 tsp.  Herbs de provence is the perfect spice for this recipe.

This deserves more than five stars !! I used about 1/2 the butter and used lemon/pepper seasoning instead of the juice (because this is all that I had) and the taste was wonderful. The seasoning was not too overpowering - I was able to still taste the flavor of the tilapia itself. This will be made on a regular basis!! Thank you for sharing!

This was absolutely WONDERFUL.  For the LOW CARBERS out there, this is perfect!  Some modifications:  I omitted lemon juice. I did sprinkle the fish first with some Old Bay.  I used celery seed instead of celery salt, added (as reviewer Shannon suggested) 1/2 tsp paprika, 1/4 tsp garlic powder, and just a pinch of crushed red pepper and a pinch of seasoned salt.  I like my coating a bit blackened, so I broiled it to a little bit of a dark glaze - not too much.  The fish was perfectly cooked and had a a bit of a crunch to it without using bread crumbs!  Served it with a side caesar salad and also rice for my husband. I used more then 1/2 of the recipe on 4 filets and it gave it a very even taste.  Not too fishy and not too cheesy!

This is one of my favorite recipes!  Every time I make it I get rave reviews.  I make it when my parents come and visit and they fight over the pieces.

I was disappointed.   The parmesan topping was overpowering the fish and just didn't compliment the fish at all.   My boyfriend didn't even eat his.   I will not be making this again.

We're with everyone else on the 5 stars! We served this for Sunday dinner with Green Beans with Breadcrumbs and rice pilaf, and it was a hit with everyone but our two kids (not fish eaters). It took a little longer than 6 minutes in the broiler, but otherwise fast, easy, and delicious! Thanks for the recipe and change of pace.

My husband and sister love this! She doesnt even eat fish. I think it is a little heavy and takes away from the fish, but if you are not a huge fish lover, you will love this. I would have given 4.5 stars if I could have!

Flavorful, fast, low cal, cheap, and easy - an all around winner.  Yummy enough to serve company.  Fast and easy to make - can easily prep the sauce in advance and throw the fish under the broiler shortly before serving.  If you line the pan with tin foil brushed with olive oil - clean up is a snap.  Even with regular mayo and regular parmesan, still low in calories.  Tilapia and the other ingredients are pretty inexpensive (except for the cheese but you only use a little).  I didn't have celery salt - just used plain and didn't miss it one bit.  Otherwise followed directions to a T.

I make this dish once a week. It's so easy and so delicious. I rub the fish with Old Bay before broiling as suggested by another reviewer and I made it a few times without the celery salt because I didn't have any. The celery salt gives it more color and a nice flavor, but it is just as good without. Keeper!

I've made this recipe several times now and each time the combination of the tilapia with the Parmesan cheese mixture is heavenly. Everyone in my family loves it, and we prefer to eat it with baked potatoes and a light salad. 

I substitutes the onion powder with a finely chopped fresh onion, to give the sauce just a little bit more bite.

Excellent basic recipe!  I followed the reviews and lined the bottom of the baking dish with sliced tomatoes, then layered fish and put mayo/Parm mixture on top.  I then sprinkled w/ bread crumbs.  Instead of broiling, I baked at 450 for 20-30 minutes.  Very good and much easier to bake than broil.

I thought this was so easy and very good.  It was a little saltier than I usually like  which is why the 4 star rating.  But an excellent, quick meal when you don't have a lot of time for preparation.

I find the kraft parmesan chesse which is preshred works best due to its high salt content.  This recipe is a success each and every time.  It's quick too!

Loved this recipe.  Topping reminded me of a stuffing used in stuffed fish or seafood mushrooms.  Very good.  Took the bla out of the otherwise, more bland flavored Tilapia.  I followed some of the suggestions and will put this in our regular rotation.  Thanks!!!!

This was fantastic...I didn't have celery salt or onion powder, so I used garlic powder instead...It still tasted Great...not sure how it would taste with the correct ingredients, but I have no complaints...except that at the very end, my pan caught on fire! Maybe from the juices and butter and the high temp.  Will be trying it again. Thanks.

This recipe is excellent!  I do not use the celery salt, but I do add a few dashes or Old Bay seafood seasoning to spice it up a bit.  I recommend using fresh basil as it is so much better than dried.  You could use this recipe for any mild fish and it is really quick and easy!

This is a GREAT weeknight recipe... broiling the fish gets it cooked in no time flat.  We omit the lemon juice (personal preference) and add double the parm cheese... yummy.

We really liked this recipe. Easy to prepare. I used both frozen tiapia and fresh. They both came out well. I am a fish cooking novice and was skeptical about not overcooking it - I think I did - it does not take long at all for the fish to be done! I give it a 4 only because I liked it a lot but not as much as a traditional garlic lemon butter recipe. A keeper and will make again for variety.

This is so good and easy too.  Can't beat that!  Hubby and I really liked this dish.  I was concerned the fish wasn't cooked enough because it didn't really change color (darken much), but I tested with a fork and they were perfect!  The fillets were thin so it didn't take long; the cook time listed was great.  They were moist and juicy.  Thanks for sharing!

I made this recipe exactly as outlined, except omitted the mayo to make it a little healthier.  The tilapia was absolutely amazing and really tasted gourmet - I can't wait to cook this to impress company!

I added some spices that suit our tastes and we loved it! I've been trouble finding a good recipe that really gives tilapia that extra taste. I'm glad I gave this one a shot, my husband hates mayo and we had no problem with this. We will be making this on a regular basis!

I made this for dinner last night on top of some angel hair pasta with red & yellow peppers. Tossed the pasta with some olive oil, butter, salt and pepper. I topped the fish with a little panko and it added an awesome crunchiness.... It was so delicious. My fiance and I both really enjoyed it. Thank you!

This was excellent. The only things I did differently were : add bread crumbs to the mix, and omit the lemon juice since I used miracle whip instead of real mayo. My picky husband kept saying "this is so good" and mentioned that its so good it tastes like it's from a restuarant.

One of our family favourites. My husband is not crazy about fish, but my kids ask for it at least twice a week. My husband says that I can make this recipe every week. The kids (4 and 6) love it too.

This recipe was great!  I added extra lemon juice and substituted a bit of cilantro instead of basil.  Served with steamed cabbage and brown rice, it's the perfect light meal for summer evenings when you don't want to heat up the oven.  Although the fish came out perfectly cooked, I will brown the topping a little longer than two minutes next time I make it.  And that topping is so yummy, I thought about whipping some up to dollop on cauliflower for the kids!

LOVED this recipe!  Into the mayo I added bread crumb, cayenne pepper and I didn't have any fresh lemon juice so I just used the the bottled lemon juice and it gave it a nice tangy flavor.  I also omitted the butter as I thought it probably didn't need it with there already being fat from the mayo.  When broiling the fish before the mixture was put on I used old bay seasoning as others suggested and it really added a nice flavor.  I make a recipe very similar to this one using blue fish except I don't use the parmesan cheese.  

Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I made this for dinner tonite, and miscalculated - making too many fillets, however, it is GONE! My daughter who didn't even want to try it because "Fish is disgusting!" even had seconds once I got her to try it! I'll definitely be making this one again!

Great recipe! Added cumin, paprika, and garlic salt. I think I went a little crazy with the salt, but other than that it was great! Served with homemade mac and cheese and ceasar salad. YUM

This was a delicious recipe! I love buying frozen tilapia and am always looking for different ways to cook it. It was a very simple and quick recipe. I didn't have celery salt on hand, and I added some garlic powder, paprika, and salt. So yummy!

I agree that celery seed should be used instead of celery salt because it was a bit too salty for me, but this had a fabulous taste. I also added in the same amount of bread crumbs as parmesan to give it a more hearty covering. And I can't believe how easy it was! It took less time to cook this than any of the sides that went with it! Thanks so much for sharing this!! :)

We don't really like fish unless it's salmon but I thought I would try this recipe.  My family loved it, even the very picky 5 & 6 year olds!  I followed the recipe and only added a bit of Old Bay seasoning to the fish before I began broiling both sides (this was b/c I also made the Old Bay Potato & Green Bean Salad recipe found on this site and the spices were just there).  Besides the salad I made some garlic rolls and dinner was ready.  Kudos to a great simple recipe!  We will definitely be keeping this one.  So yummy!

I made this for my mom last mothers day ( a year ago) and she ranted and raved about it. It has become a weekly dinner staple at my house. It is so easy to make. My grandmother and aunt love it too. I dont put any salt in...just pepper. Very delicious...thank you :)

Very good flavor, I used slightly different spices-lemon pepper and Old Bay-since that is what I had on hand.  I also think I will use less butter next time since there was a lot in the pan when it was done.  Notice I said next time though LOL - I will definitely make this again.

I've been trying to incorporate more seafood into our diets, and this recipe has been an absolute hit with my husband.  Granted, it isn't the most healthy recipe in the world, but I tone down the mayo (use light) and butter (halve it) and it's still great.

We really liked this dish - I added Old Bay seasoning on both sides of the fish, as suggested, before broiling. I also added 1 1/2 T panko bread crumbs to the cheese mixture, and 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper. I didn't have celery salt, so i omitted it, and I didn't have dried basil so I used Italian seasoning instead. Also used lime juice instead of lemon juice. I served it with rice pilaf, but I think bread will be a better accompaniment. Thanks!

This recipe is SO good!  Everyone in my family LOVED it, even my fish-hating 9 year old daughter!  Everyone wanted more, but I made just enough for dinner with no leftovers!  I did sprinkle with Old Bay as some others had suggested, and I also added a heaping teaspoon of minced garlic to the parmesan topping.

This is so yummy!! Every time I make it I always get compliments. I also use the suggestions from Shannon 1/2 tsp paprika, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, bread crumbs, ect. I dont use lemon and the bread crumbs I use are italian seasoned. I love this recipe. And if your guests arent huge seafood fans its perfect because talapia doesnt taste realy fishy.

Very good.  I took another suggestion and added about 2 T breadcrumbs to the mixture (I was only making a 1/2 recipe.)  I also subsituted sweet white wine for the lemon juice b/c I didn't have lemon juice.

SOOO delicious!! I've had shrimp with mayo before so I knew this was going to be a hit. It's even better warmed up the next day because the flavors have seeped into the fish.

Very good.  This was the first time we've tried tilapia (I don't really like fish all that much) and it was pretty good.  I could see how people who like fish would enjoy this dish very much.

This is awesome the way it is!  (Although, now I want to try some of the reviewers' suggestions...)  It is so good, my husband (who hates fish) even likes it!  My mom liked it so much, she had us make it for our big family dinner on Christmas Eve!  I have to say fresh tilapia tastes the best (vs. frozen) - it's a texture thing for me.  Also, don't crowd your cookie sheet to its max capacity!

This recipe is so good and so easy that it prompted me to post my first review!  I have tried many tilapia recipes and this was by far the best and the easiest.  I didn't change anything.  It is amazing just as written.  I especially liked the fact that I didn't need to purchase any unusual ingredients that I would never use again if I didn't like the recipe.  I had everything I needed on hand.  I suppose if a person doesn't like parmesan cheese, he or she probably wouldn't care for this recipe.

This recipe is perfect as written and works deliciously with many kinds of white fish (we personally love tilapia). I highly recommend the aluminum foil - easy cleanup! We could eat this fish weekly!

Anything that gets my husband and two-year-old son to eat fish deserves five stars, trust me.  Very tasty reipe.  The only thing I did differently was to substitute a tsp. of lemon pepper for the lemon juice and black pepper, simply because I didn't have any lemons.  I doubt it affected the taste much.  This one is going in my collection!

People are always requesting this dish. It's always a nice change from just regular broiled fish with butter and lemon. The Parmesan topping is amazing on all kinds of fish

This was very good.  I didn't have the parmesan cheese so I used shredded mozarella.  It really was wonderful!  I will be making this again for sure.  Moist and very tasty!

YUM! i love this recipe! thought i have found that reducing the butter/margerine a bit and upping the ammount of parmesan cheese makes it browner and crispier. i make this recipe at least once a week :).

This is hands down my favorite fish recipe! I made it for dinner when Mom was over and it was a big hit. She immediately asked for the recipe and told me I was an excellent cook! I followed the recipe exactly and I would not change it one bit.

after buying frozen tilapia filets for the first time, i needed an idea of how to prepare them and decided to try this out. i loved it and so did my husband. i did not change the recipe unless you count the fact that i didn't measure.

This was not bad. I added a little garlic powder but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. It was a little tangier than I expected. I personally didn't think the topping tasted overwhelmingly of mayo, as I noticed most of the negative reviews said. It definitely overpowered the fish, though, so this would be a good way to prepare fish for someone who doesn't really like the taste of fish. I preferred it with less of the topping, so next time, I would either make less of the topping or not use all of the topping on the fish. The topping also didn't get as firm or as brown as I would have liked... I may experiment with adding the topping on immediately rather than cooking the fish first.

Thank you, to whoever submitted this recipe...now that I make this fish, there is no chance in hell that my husband will ever leave me! Haha just kidding...but seriously, this tilapia is killer. Next time I would make just a little more spread though so I could really coat all the fillets well. You only need just a titch more (i.e. a HEAPING tablespoon instead of a regular tablespoon)

This recipe is super quick and easy and not short on flavor!  I followed the recipe as is and wouldn't change a thing.  Be sure to let the cheese mixture brown - it really brings out the flavor.  This fish made a beautiful presentation alongside streamed broccoli and homemade rolls.

Really simple and good:-)

I followed the other suggestions and sprinkled on Old Bay seasoning prior the first broil.
I kept the rest of the recipe same except I used reduced fat mayo and added some whole wheat bread crumbs to the topping mixture. I am glad I did because it gives it a little substance to otherwise a runny topping. It was very tasty, my 4 young boys loved it. 
Very kid friendly !!!

I thought it had excellent flavor, but overall I thought it was too buttery and rich for such a mild fish.  I will probably make this again, but I will reduce the butter.

I'm very picky about how fish tastes and this was excellent!  I did add some bread crumbs as someone suggested to help keep the topping from all sliding off the fillets.  Turned out wonderfull.  Makes me want to eat fish more often.

This was awesome!!! As others suggested, I used Old Bay prior to broiling and added garlic powder, paprika, cayenne pepper, and panko crumbs to the cheese mixture. It was my first time using panko crumbs and the finish it gave the fish was fabulous!!! A really nice crunch!! I can't wait to make this again!!

INCREDIBLE!!!!!  We love the cheesy flavor on this fish.  My 4 yr old and 2 yr old sons ask for seconds every time I make it.  Also, I'm in a cooking co-op with 5 other friends.  I have made this meal twice because they like it so much.  It's super easy to freeze.  Just mix all of the ingredients together and store them in a freezer bag.  Once you thaw it, I just cut the corner off the bag and squeeze it over the tilapia fillets.  Seriously - it's delicious and an incredibly yummy way to serve fish to your family.  We make it again and again.

My four year old and my husband cleaned their plates.  Delicious, easy, and quick to clean up.  Thanks!  Oh, and I substituted dill for basil and sprinkled some break crumbs on top. mmmmmm.

So easy!  Iused a broiler pan.  No need to flip, I just broiled them until done and added the cheese misture the last 2 minutes.  My family loved this.

Loved It! It was easy and delicious...a wonderful combination. My kids absolutely loved it, and they normally don't enjoy fish. I will definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing! ***My husband and I had this for lunch the next day. The flavor was amazing..even better than the first time around!

Loved it! All of the flavors blended nicely together. Used a half of a lemon on this. Make sure you let it brown all over, the parts of my fish that weren't browned didn't taste as good as the parts that browned. Can't wait to make this again.

This recipe was very good, we added panko bread crumbs and put it under the broiler for a few min.  This added another layer of flavor to an already great recipe

Sometimes it's tough to make a memorable tilapia dish, but this recipe is wonderful.  Wanting to reduce excess fat and calories (as well as sodium), I followed the advice of previous reviewers and skipped the butter; I also used reduced-fat mayo.  Additionally, I used celery seeds instead of celery salt--the cheese really does provide all the salt that's necessary.  Being a bread crumb fan I also sprinkled those on top.  The result:  a relatively low-cal, low-fat, and incredibly tasty tilapia dish!

My family raved about this and requested I make it again and soon!  I reduced the amount of butter and added some bread crumbs as some has suggested. I didn't have celery salt and so used onion salt instead.  Fast, easy, delicious.  Will definitely be making this again.

Awesome!  Leave out/cut down on the butter.  It's still excellent without. I actually feel that the butter made it too greasy and oily, so, not needed.  The parm. has basically all the salt you're gonna need, so watch any sodium modifications you're going to make to this recipe.  Picky husband dug it also!

I followed this recipe exactly and found it to be just barely edible. Certainly nothing I would ever make again. The fish was slightly underdone (which I think many people will like, but it just creeped me out) and the flavors did not blend well together.

This was great! Not only is the recipe great exactly as it's written, but it's so versatile. Change out the spices, or the cheese! I've added minced garlic and garlic powder on separate occasions. Plus, I've added a bit of roquefort to the mixture with the parmesan... so wonderful and rich! The first time I made this, I followed the recipe exactly, and my family ate it up! Even my 6 year old! So easy and quick!

Easy to make.  Normal ingred.  Fast.  My family enjoyed this.  Husband wants to try it on other fish.  We all wanted more of the brown crispy cheese.  Very good, this will be in our normal meal rotation.

My BF and I made this lastnight, scaled down to 1/2 lb. and used Flounder instead of Tilapia. It was GOOOOOOOOD. The flounder was too fishy for me personally (I much prefer tilapia, which I'll DEFINITELY use next time) so he ate all 3 pieces himself! The flavor of the sauce was excellent! I don't think I'll ever wanna make fish any other way! Thanks!

The best thing I would say about this recipe is that it is incredibly easy. So easy that even the most inexperienced cook could make it without having to ponder some of the instructions. The taste was all right, but not great. Our household tends to focus on wholesome, fresh tasting foods and this didn't really fit the bill (mayo + butter + cheese does NOT = healthy), but I figured I'd give it a shot since so many others liked it so much. I followed the recipe almost exactly - used celery salt instead of celery seed and low fat mayo instead of regular - but it tasted uninspired and unexciting. The mayo and cheese combination taste like Midwest comfort food (not my thing). Probably a great recipe to introduce fish to non-fish eaters, though, as tilapia is a naturally mild fish and the spread is enough to mask any lingering fishy taste. I'd give the ease of preparation 5 stars and the taste 3 stars, so 4 stars overall.

This was terrific.  Even my very picky 3 year old--who refuses to eat fish--asked for seconds.  Feel free to cut back on the butter.  I make a recipe very similar (without butter) on chicken.  Thanks for sharing!

If I could give this more than 5 stars I would. I hate the taste of fish, but gladly ate seconds. Even my picky children asked for more. My seafood eating husband is excited that fish will be on the menu more often - thanks to this recipe.

I split this recipe in half, and then added the breadcrumbs like other's have suggested. I ended up with a thick breadcrumb spread....It browned up, but not sure where this went wrong. My husband ate it, but I couldnt finish mine.. I doubt I will be making this again.

WOW!!  Didn't have Tilapia on hand so I substituted with chicken breast.  Also, I used tomato paste instead of mayonaise, and blue cheese instead of parmesan.  I had no lemons in the house so I used white wine as a substitute.  Finally, a few strips of bacon to top this off and this was better than the broiled tilapia parmesan that's served at my favorite restaurant.  Bravo!

Wonderful! I was skeptical while mixing the parmesean topping but it turned out absolultey delicious. I used shredded Paremesean cheese, substituted garlic powder for the onion powder, substituted Italian seasoning for the basil, and added 1/8 t. cayenne pepper.

I've made this a couple of times and our family loves it. One thing I found last time I made it was that there was too much butter. I used trout instead of tilapia--I'm not sure if that was the reason why. IN any case, I would reduce the amount of butter a little bit. Otherwise, great recipe!

I used Basa fillets (couldn't get Tilapia), freeze dried basil and freshly grated parmesan.  I got worried when the topping melted almost immediately upon spreading it on the fish, with quite a bit of it running off.  I broiled it until it was browned and bubbly.  It was very moist and flavorful, not at all overpowering like others stated.  I didn't pack the parmesan to measure it, so it was very light.  I will probably make this again, but I will reduce the butter to 2 tbsp, or omit it all together.

Absolutely delicious!  After the final step of the instructions, I drizzled a little red sauce on top of the fish and added some mozzarella.  SOOOO good!

I made this tonight for my company and it was well received, although no one reached for seconds.  My only reason for giving it 4 and not 5 stars was that I found the topping to be too rich (I used full-fat mayo) and grease just pooled on my cookie pan (I don't have a broiler pan).  Next time, I think I'll try either using less mayo and butter or maybe use miracle whip.  Also, I did add a lot of additional seasonings per other reviewers advice: seasoned the fish with Old Bay, added about a 1/4 tsp of red pepper flakes, garlic powder (omitted onion powder), paprika, celery seed (omitted the celery salt) and 1/2 cup of Italian bread crumbs.  It definitely had a good flavor so I will try it again!

My topping never really browned, but it was still really yummy.  Great flavor!  My local grocer only had one tilapia fillet, so I substituted red snapper.  Came out pretty well.

Good recipe. I'll make it again. Maybe with less parm. cheese though. I added some lemon and dill to help with the parm cheese. The dill was a great addition. Just a couple of dashes.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  I will sprinkle on some bread crumbs next time and    will also season the fish with some salt and pepper before spreading on the sauce.  The only change I made was to use garlic powder instead of onion powder.  I do agree with another review that you could use less butter and mayo to cut back on the grease.  Very yummy!

I thought the sauce was the best part. The short amount of time it took to cook was really nice. We had never had tiapia before and though it was good, I think that another type of fish would be better. All in all it was good and the picky eaters said they'd try it again.

This recipe was soo easy to make and turned out wonderful.  The great part is how easy it is to modify the recipe and give it a bit more personalization.   We suggest parsley and maybe a bit more black pepper.

Delicious.  I immediately make this whenever I have tilapia on hand, and I've been using this recipe for 6-9 months now.  Instead of lemon juice, I use lemon pepper seasoning to reduce runniness.

Very good! I added crushed garlic from Trader joes to it and WOW! The garlic ties it all together. I also added about 5-6 crushed ritz crackers. My hubby who usually says my fish is "oh its fine" said it was really good. Very few seafood items I make get that approval from him. He is a fish snob. He fished in alaska for 3 years and has knows good seafood. Thanks for a winner recipe! Finally, something I can make to satisy that fussy  palate! Oh yeah, The kids ate it too!

I made this for dinner last night and it was great!  I did season the fish before broiling it with a little salt, pepper, garlic powder, and a bit of lemon pepper.  It was very flavorful!  (I added a bit too much Parmesan so the topping melted and looked messy, but I served it over steamed jasmine rice and it was wonderful).  My husband, who usually doesn't like Parmesan cheese, really enjoyed the fish!

I use tilapia loins straight out of the freezer and cook them in the toaster oven (mine has a broiler feature).  It only adds a few extra minutes to the overall cook time.  Can't beat that!

Loved it!  I used celery seed in lieu of celery salt (what I had on hand) and added garlic, paprika, and cayenne pepper.  I used the same measurement for the basil, pepper, onion powder, celery seed, paprika, and cayenne pepper.  I used double the amount of garlic powder in comparison to the other ingredients.  Also make it in a foil packet in my toaster oven.  So easy, so tasty, will defintely make again!  THANK YOU

The fish tasted fabulous and the recipe was very easy. I substituted lime juice for lemon. Plus, my fillets were frozen to start. I put them in the oven frozen, let them thaw, and then completed the recipe as directed. Very nice.

This was fabulous! The topping is very rich. I added some Old Bay Seasoning to the fish and also some breadcrumbs and red pepper flakes to the topping. It was amazing! I didn't have basil so I subbed paprika per suggestion. Thanks!

Wonderful!  I made exactly as stated, minus the celery salt (I didn't have any).  It turned out great, anyway - it was a huge hit with the whole family, and so easy!  I will definitely make this again - and I passed the recipe on to a bunch of friends, too!

This recipe was easy, quickly prepared and mostly importantly, very tasty! I purchased two pounds of tilapia and it was gone in no time. Even my two toddlers loved it since it was so cheesy. I do not use celery salt but it was still delicious. I added Old Bay Season and some paprika. Very good. There is not too many good fish dishes that I can find but this is definitely a great one!

This was a very good recipe. I fry and grill tilapia quite a bit and wanted something different. I did use about 1 teaspoon of Cavenders Greek seasoning and that really added flavor. I will be using this recipe again real soon. Thanks

We cannot get enough of this recipe!!  I did as another reviewer suggested and added italian breadcrumbs to the mixture to give it a little more substance.  I have even made this with frozen tilapia, just add a couple extra minutes to the broil time.  Awesome!!

This recipe is a true crowd pleaser!  It only took me 10 minutes to make and tasted like a gourmet chef came to my house to cook for our dinner party - we'll definitely be making this one again.  I accompanied this dish with angel hair pasta in a light garlic herb sauce.

Excellent! I work long hours and want something delicious and fast to make when my fiance comes over. (Still trying to hide my lack of cooking experience until I have the ring:)) 
This was fast and incredibly good! I am going to make it this weekend for my mother to prove that I "am not completely helpless in the kitchen and does your fiance know what he is getting into?"...

Well I found out we don't like Tilapia all too well.  It has a pugnet flavor and tastes kinda "gamey".  I'm rating the topping a 3 because it smothers the fish to an unrecognizable fish taste.  I may use this again but will need to tweek it to compliment the fish rather than cover the taste completely.  All though I'm glad it covered up the taste of Tilapia. 

I will definitely use a milder fish withought the "gamey" meat.

Outstanding!!! sprinkled the filet with Old Bay Seasoning before broiling.  Used shredded parmesan cheese instead.  Came out delicious!  Keep a close eye while broiling because the filets I had cooked very fast.

I was a a little disappointed with the flavor of the sauce, not what I expected.  I didn't touch my fish but my family  liked theirs.

My husband only gave this 4 stars.  I'm actually surprised, because of the great ratings on this site.  He really loves fish in any form, but he only gave this 4 stars.

I, personally, do not care for fish, but if I did, this would be the recipe that I would go for.  I tasted the sauce and it was VERY good!

This is very tasty and a nice alternative to frying.  We took the suggestion to adding red pepper flakes.  Also, sprinkled fish with seasoned salt before broiling.  Try it!

I LOVE THIS RECIPE.  I 1st had it at a friend's house who made it and she gave me the recipe later on, and it turns out to be this same one.  SO DELICIOUS!  I did not have any celery salt, so I just used some normal salt, and it was just fine.  Definitely makin' this again.

was a hit with the family, but what isn't if it includes Parmesan?  Used Miracle Whip salad dressing, but stuck to the recipe otherwise.  Very nice!  Will be a easy go-to recipe for me.

All I have to say is, "What a crowd pleasing recipe!"  This is great to make for your family or to impress dinner guests (they won't be disappointed).  Followed the directions to a "T" and it came out like perfection.  My compliments to the chef!

Good, quick and easy - everyone liked it. It was a little greasy/heavy for my liking, so next time I am going to use light mayo and less butter. I also added 1/2 tsp of minced garlic and that worked out very well. You can experiment widely with the spices used and have a unique dish every time, which is neat.

Per others suggestions I made the recipe as stated except I added panko breadcrumbs and old bay seasoning to the tilapia.  The panko made the top crunchy and gave a nice presentation.  I only gave 4 out of 5 stars because I am not a huge fish fan but this recipe made eating fish an option for me.

I couldn't find tilapia at the store, guess they were all out, so I found macadamia encrusted trout. Believe it or not, it was AWESOME. Easy to cook, and even made good leftovers for lunch the next day.

I've never cooked tilapia before, so this was a good recipe to start out with! It was very quick to make. I used the old bay seasoning that a lot of the reviewers had recommended. The fish turned out great. My husband had 3 servings, and then took 2 servings to work the next day for lunch! :D

Made this last night only substituting fresh grated Romano cheese for the Parmesan I was out of. Good flavor. Will add a little more seasoning and breadcrumbs in the topping next time.

OH MY GOSH! I thought this sounded good, but had no idea how INCREDIBLE it was going to be. Everyone in the family raved about it, and the biggest (and only) complaint was that there wasn't enough for everyone to have seconds! I did not have the basil on hand, so that didn't manage to get in - but honestly, we liked the recipe so much without it that I hesitate now to put it in. MAKE DOUBLE THE AMOUNT - YOU ARE GOING TO NEED IT!

Great Recipe! I used Snapper instead of Tilapia and like the others added the breadcrumbs and seasoned the fish before broiling.  It was a hit!

I know this is a big surprise, BUT... Absolutely a 5* recipe!  I used the recipe as is for 1/2 Lb tilapia (1/4 recipe) and used the dry ingredients as if I were putting pepper on a salad (I like pepper).  I served this with “Almond Wild Rice” and a garden salad.  GREAT!!!

My wife and I had this for dinner tonight, and it was excellent!  Made exactly as recipe stated, only cut back for 2 people.  Also, added Old Bay seasoning as recommended.  It enhanced the flavor.  Will definitely make again!  Thanks for the recipe.

I left out the celery salt but followed the rest of the recipe and it turned out to be very delicious!  The flavors worked together well and the fish was moist and flaky.  My whole family enjoyed this recipe.  It's a great recipe to introduce fish to a family who's skeptical about eating it.

I usually like tilapia a lot, and I was looking for another way to cook it.  I personally thought this recipe was disgusting.  My husband thought that it was pretty decent, so I'm giving it 4 stars for him, and 0 for me, for an average of 2.  I followed the recipe exactly, but it didn't taste anything like I thought it would.  The combination of textures was really weird.  If you have issues with textures, I would stay away from this recipe.

This is the BEST fish recipe I have tasted!  If you like a mild fish this is the recipe to try.  My kids and my husband love it!  The only thing that I do differently is to lightly drizzle the fish with olive oil and lightly season it with Pappy's seasoning before cooking.

This is soooo good! I used cod instead of tilapia, cooked for 10 min at 350, then broiled on high for 5 min before flipping. Put more dressing on top, sprinkled w/ Old Bay and Breadcrumbs, then broiled another 5 min. Used garlic powder instead of onion & celery. Even my "fish-snob" husband said it was delicious!

Wow! This was WONDERFUL! Last time I went to Olive Garden I had Parmesan Tilapia, and this recipe was 10 times better than theirs. Like another reviewer suggested, I  added bread crumbs and doubled the amount of pepper. I also seasoned each side of the fillets with Old Bay. I served alongside garlic mashed new potatoes and steamed green beans. A fabulous dinner...with out a doubt I will definitely make this again soon!

I thought this recipe was great. I cooked exactly from the directions adding some cooking spray to the foil of the pan (in my oven, fish tends to stick to the foil). Loved it! will definately make again... maybe vary a little with some the recommendations :) thanks for the great recipe!

This was delicious, I needed a great and easy recipe and this completely hit the mark. I followed the advice of one of the other reviewers and added some breadcrumbs and ground red pepper to the mix. This recipe is a permanent fixture in my collection. Thanks so much!

Very easy and surprisingly tasty (I'm not a huge cheese fan)... it's well complemented with lemon and other "fresh" sides.

Bachelor friendly.

so good, easy, and FAST!  I used fresh parmesan cheese, omitted the onion powder and celery salt (I didn't have them on hand), added garlic powder and wilted fresh shredded basil on top after the final 2 minutes.  Also liberally seasoned the filets with Old Bay.  I can't wait to make this again!

Excellent recipe.  I also added bread crumbs as some of the other previous reviews.  Added, red pepper for kick and only 1-tablespoon of lemon.  Will definitely serve again - very easy.  Thanks for sharing!

Yum!  This recipe is awesome!  I did make some substitutions because I didn't have all the ingredients.  I used lime juice instead of lemon.  I used 1/8 tsp garlic salt instead of the celery salt and onion powder.  And I used parmesan-romano instead of regular parmesan.  And it turned out great - everyone loved it.  I don't think I'd ever made fish that tasted so great!

This was good.  I would like to try it minus the butter next time.  I mixed in some Italian bread crumbs per the previous reviewers suggestion.  Since they are preseasoned I just omitted all of the spices in the recipe.  Turned out well.  My older 2 boys gobbled it up.

This certainly tastes good, but I don't like parmesan cheese w/fish so much.  It is easy to make

Wonderful! My fish-loving husband said this is was the best fish he'd ever eaten! Suprisingly quick and easy too.  Thanks for sharing!

An OK way to prepare fish.  Is very versatile otherwise, easy to cater to your own individual taste.  Overall not bad.

This is pretty good. Not the best fish dish I've ever had, but it's a great quick fix, especially for white fish. I also used low-fat mayo and added some bread crumbs, and I seasoned the fish with some salt, pepper and cayenne during its first broil. Definitely something I will be making again and adding to my regular recipes!

Good, but not gourmet. We could eat this regularly for weeknight fare (topping would work for a variety of mild, white fish), but I don't think it's something my family will necessarily request as a favorite.

This recipe is just wonderful. Very easy and very fast, too. I tried another new recipe the day before and stood in the kitchen for 2hrs. That was very disappointing. It took me 5min to prepair and 15min to make this tilapia dish and all I had to do is cook some rice while the fish was in the oven.... perfect dinner. We will have this every week now. We had tilapia every week before but this adds a great different taste to it. LOVE IT!!

Very delicious and satisfying. I did not have any celery salt or basil yet it still turned out delicious. I did add some bread crumbs and garlic powder like others suggested, I may have added too many as I had to add some water to loosen up the paste for spreading without ripping the fish apart. I cooked this on tin foil on a broiler pan. Next time I will salt and pepper the fish prior to adding the topping as the few parts that did not have topping were flavorless. I served this with broccoli and cheese. Next time I make this I may experiment with Morton Nature's Seasons seasoning blend. It lists the following ingredients: salt, black pepper, sugar, spices, onion flavor, garlic flavor, parsley, and celery seeds. This seasoning seems to cover the bases without having to measure out individually.

I did not like this even though I followed other suggestions. The fish taste was masked by the parm and it was greasy and too rich. I am used to fish being flavorful and light.

Everyone loved it. I will definately make this again. My son said it was the best fish he ever had. I made this a second time and realized as I was making it the 2nd time that I messed up the 1st time. My husband made the mayo mixture which means I know he did not measure correctly. So he did not put in enough cheese that was the 1st mistake. 2nd mistake was coating the fish with mayo mixture before it was cooked. With both of these mistakes the fish still turned out DELICIOUS!!! The 2nd time I made I followed the directions as it states and measured everything correctly and I still liked the fish the 1st time I made it. I think the next time I will use 1/4 cup of parmesean.

My husband doesn't do fish, but he ate this and thought it was ok.  We both agreed it didn't have a ton of flavor, it kinda melted off the fish.  Not sure what I would do different.  I'm sure I will try this again, especially to get my non-fish eaters to eat some fish now and again.

Fantastic recipe¡¡¡ I use Nayonnaise instead of mayonnaise because it is much healthier for you. It is a vegan soy based alternative to mayonnaise. You won't notice the difference. With the calories you save you can have desert!

So easy, soooo good.  I didn't really make any changes.  For super easy cleanup, I used a sheet pan lined with parchment. Just roll it up and pitch it.  A great way to quickly prepare tilapia.

I think this is a good recipe for people who don't like fish bc the parmesan masks the fishy flavor, but considering that it's my favorite food I wasn't very impressed.  The taste was prob 3.5 stars, but it was a fast/easy meal, so that's why I'm giving this 4 stars.

I love this recipe.  I was a little nervous about broiling fish as I never had, but it cooked very fast and was easy to tell when fish was done.  I had a couple over for dinner and they loved it also!  Fish is mild and sauce on top is perfect.  Thanks for sharing.  I will make again and again.

We paired it with some couscous and steamed vegetables (and of course a glass of white wine!) - from start to finish it took no more then 20 minutes for the whole meal.  I am sure you could make adjustments to the herbs and it would still taste wonderful.  Thanks!

Yummy and easy!  Have everything else ready before these go in the oven because they cook very quickly.

Very tasty! I especially liked the fact that I had everything except the fish on hand to make this. I followed some other reviewers' suggestions and was glad I did--particularly the suggestion to add breadcrumbs. That kept the topping on the hot fish as the butter melted. Very quick, very easy and delicious. Thanks for the recipe!

This was the best tilapia I have ever had!! I will use this recipe from now on for all fish. It's delicious-better than eating out at a retaurant.

This recipe is FANTASTIC! My husband and I don't really like the taste of fish, but want to get more fish in our diets.  This was wonderful and very, very easy. I even used frozen tilapia fillets! Ready in minutes and delicious.  We will be having this recipe much more often, and will try some of your suggestions. Thanks!

I am not a seafood lover, unless it is fried of course; this was wonderful!  I did add a squirt of djion mustard, garlic powder and some bread crumbs to the mix and sprinkled fish with blackened seasoning before broiling.  I also crushed a handful of potato chips and added to the top for a little crunch.  Chopped a bit of cilantro and green onion for garnish. GREAT RECIPE!

Good recipe.  Cheese sauce has to be REALLY think to stick to the tilapia when it cooks.  Add more bread crumbs.

I've made Tilapia many times before, baked.  The texture and the flavor were so much better.  I will definitely make this again.

I tried this recipe last night with my husband. The chesse mixture has a really nice taste to it and season's the entire piece of fish perfectly. We enjoyed ours with some garlic smashed red potatoes and green beans. We will definitley put this into our regular rotation.

This was very good. I followed the recipe pretty much exactly, only I rubbed the filets with olive oil before broiling them... this helped keep them from sticking to the bottom of the pan. But, very tasty!

I didn't care for this dish at all, but my husband liked it so I gave it a rating based on his opinion.  I must admit, I'm not a big fish lover so that could have a lot to with it.  I would like to incorporate more seafood into our diets so that is why I gave this a try.

I am not a fish lover, but this was quite good.  The topping really helped my family eat the fish.  I also halved roma tomatoes, spread with the topping mix, and broiled them.  They were a tasty and colorful accompaniment.

as everyone else has said this is a deliciously different way to serve tilapia.  my only problem was that it was still raw after the recommended cooking time - maybe i had thicker-than-average fillets?  anyway, this is a great recipe nonetheless!

A little bland for my taste, but a nice entree nevertheless.  I will try it again with the Old Bay and a Romano-Parm blend.

This is awesome! I have never put the celery salt and sometimes don't have the lemon and it still turns out great.

Very delicious and easy to make.  Different taste for Tilapia, but we really enjoyed it.  We will make it again and again.

Amazing recipe.  I usually add a touch more lemon juice and sometimes bake a little longer.  One of the best seafood dishes I've ever had.

Delicious.  I added the bread crumbs, and though I only used 1.25 lbs of tilapia, it was nice to have the extra topping.  Not fishy at all, just the way everyone at our house likes it!

LOVED IT!  I am not a big fish person, however I absolutely loved this.  It was delicious.  The only change I will make the next time I make it is make more of the sauce.

Wow!  I this recipe was wonderful, the whole family LOVED it!  I made it without any changes and even my picky 4 yr-old who hates fish had like 3 servings (we told him it was just "white meat"). Will definitely make again.

I made this last night.  After reading the reviews I omitted the lemon juice because I was using low fat mayo as well.  I also added breadcrumbs to the mix and it browned nicely and seemed to hold everything together on top of the fish.  My husband loved it and it was very simple.

WOW, DID I LUCK OUT FINDING THIS RECIPE!  I FEEL LIKE A GOURMET CHEF!  I'M REALLY JUST A BEGINNER, ALTHOUGH I HAVE ALWAYS LIKED TO BAKE.  ANYWAY, THIS RECIPE IS EASY AND TASTES AND LIKE SOMETHING YOU WOULD EAT AT A FINE RESTAURANT!  I DIDN'T HAVE THE OLD BAY SEASONING OR ONION POWDER, SO I OMITTED THE BAY SEASONING AND USED GARLIC POWDER INSTEAD.  I HALVED EVERYTHING ELSE BECAUSE I ONLY HAD LESS THAN A POUND OF TILAPIA.  EVERYONE LOVED IT...ME, MY HUSBAND, DAUGHTER AND HER FRIEND!!!  I CAN'T WAIT TO EAT IT AGAIN NEXT WEEK!!!  THANK YOU!!!!!!

This is an outstanding recipe.  I made it for my girlfriend who raves about her Mom's Tilapia.  She wants me to make it for her mom now.  Thanks, it really scored me points.  

Update, I made this for my girlfriends mom.  Outstanding!  Try substituting the mayonaise for Ranch dressing.  Wonderful recipe.  After making this for mother I received a huge welcome to the family.

I have to agree with everyone else who raved about this recipe, this was great.  I cut the recipe in 1/2 because I had only bought a pound of the tilapia and before putting the fillets into broil I added a dash of Old Bay and some fresh squeezed lemon juice and a tiny bit of olive oil.  They were moist and tasty.  Thanks for this quick and easy recipe that I know I will use again and again.  My husband already asked if we can use the parmesan topping with some of our other favorite fish.

WOW! Loved this recipe, so did my husband.  I was always of cooking fish because of not knowing if it was done or not.  This cooked up perfectly to the "T" as recommended by the recipe.  Didn't change a thing!

I was really pleased with how this recipe turned out.  I had my doubts as I was making it but the end result was wonderful.  It did come out a bit greasier than I like so I think in the future I may cut the butter in half or even find a way to eliminate it entirely.  But other than that, it was yumm.

I made this recipe with halibut, and it turned out great!  I pretty much followed the recipe as written, although I slightly overcooked the fish so monitor the time! I really enjoyed the leftover fish for lunch.  I broke it into pieces and put in a green salad with avocado, green onions, cilantro, cucumber and croutons.  I always try to plan a little extra for "leftover salad" when I make fish.

This was good, I gave it 4 stars because my boyfriend has a recipe with panko and parm that’s a little better although this is the best tilapia I ever made.  I ended up baking it instead of broiling because I wanted to cook some broccoli and cauliflower with it and wasnt sure how they would turn out under the broiler.  The sauce melted into the veggies and they tasted great.

This is my favorite broiled tilapia recipe!  I use lime juice, celery seed, and onion flakes as this is what I usually have in hand. I season the tilapia with cajun seasoning and add fresh garlic before broiling.  Finally, I add about 1/4 cup of seasoned breadcrumbs to mixture.  Cooking time is pretty accurate so follow closely.

I had to cut this recipe in half because I only had 1 lbs of tilapia.  I didn't think that there was enough flavor to the sauce.   Next time I will double the amount of sauce to give it more of a cheesy flavor.  Overall good though.  My husband loved it, and I thought it was "okay"

This is so, so good.  It gives the tilapia such great taste and a great variation!  My fiance and I don't like mayonnaise, so we used miracle whip.  I don't like celery salt nor have it available, so I used Lawry's seasoned salt instead.  Mm Mm good!  Thank you for sharing!

I made this for dinner.  I pretty much followed it to a T.  I did add about 1 tablespoon of freshly chopped dill into the mayo/cheese mixture and 1/4 tspn of garlic powder.   It turned out great.  Everyone in my family loved it.  This is a super super easy recipe to follow.  It's a great fast recipe for those days you don't feel like cooking !
I served this with zucchini boats.

My husband hates fish (as in he views eating fish as a fair trade for his not having to wash dishes or laundry for a week), but he really loved this one.  He kept saying "loved the chicken, err, I mean the fish" as if he couldn't believe it tasted so well.  I cooked it for a bit longer than recommended (and did the 2 tbls. of bread crumbs, treating the fish before hand with old bay suggestions)

This recipe is perfect as is.  Keep to the suggested cook times and you'll have a great meal.  I served this with the Spinach and Rice (Spanakorizo) recipe on this site.  By itself, the rice is just okay, but the dill makes it the perfect accompaniment to the cheese & lemon coating on the tilapia.

I followed this recipe exactly, except I used Kraft Three Cheese Blend (found right next to parmesan cheese in grocery stores) instead of parmesan cheese, and it turned out so SO delicious!  I'll also be trying this with other white fish in the future! THANK YOU!

My only comment is to make sure you use good quality parmesan cheese. The cheap stuff just doesn't work very well.

Excellent recipe with a few changes.  Add fresh Garlic, breadcrumbs, dried oregano and basil and cayenne pepper.  No celery salt.  Really mounded the fillets with the parmesan breadcrumb mixture. Very tasty!

This is a very good recipe and even better with the following additions... Juice of 1/2 a lemon, a few pats of butter and Old Bay seasoning, to taste on top the fish before baking it. Then decrease the lemon juice in the sauce to 1 Tablespoon and add 1 large (whisked) egg white to the sauce and the sauce will "Puff" up on the fish. The egg white makes the sauce look very "Elegant", sure to impress your guests.

The taste was wonderful.  My husband hated it.  But, then again, he hates fish.  I did have trouble with the paste.  It didn't want to stay ON the fish.  I think I will use the breadcrumb suggestion next time.  Still searching for that fish recipe that my hubby will like. . . .

My husband and I both thought this recipe was ok.  I didn't care for the topping.  My son really liked it though.  I had added the Old Bay Seasoning, and I felt it overpowered the fish.  Maybe I just put too much. I love Tilapia, but would not make this particular recipe again.

Yum!!! I will say I don't really care for alot of fish, but this was really good. The sauce masked any fishy tast there may hae been without overpowering it. I did take the other suggestions and added some paprika, garlic powder, a handfull of bread crumbs and omitted the celery salt. I also used light sour cream in place of the mayo. My hubby said it was k but, he better start thinking it's great because it will be going in the normal rotation!! Thanks for the great recipe!

This is a do-over.  I added some paprika and red pepper flakes.  I did not use the celery salt based on other reviews- I am glad I didnt it was salty enough without it! I did need to broil mine an extra 2 minutes than is stated on the recipe- this is very very easy and yummy!!

This recipe was good.  My husband loved it and I thought it was ok. Next time I will broil the tilapia longer before I put the cheese mixture on top. I had to broil the tilapia about 3 minutes longer than the recipe called for which made the topping get a little burnt.

This is really good! Definitely recommend putting on some red pepper flakes though to give it a little more zing.

I loved this recipe and Im not really a fish person. The only thing I changed was leaving the salt out the Parmesan makes it salty enough. I make this all the time.

Delicious and easy! I added breadcrumbs to the cheese mixture.  I learned the hard way - don't make the cheese mixture ahead of time and refrigerate - it will harden and make it difficult to spread.

It was alright, definitely easy to make. It was a bit bland to my taste unfortunately. However, I had some left over of the fish, and some rice the next day, so I made stir fry with them, by sauteeing some vegetables in a bit of oil, added the cold rice and the shredded fish from the day b4. I then stirred in a bit of soy sauce. Let me tell you, I make fried rice very often, but this was the best one by far! It might be the mayo, or something in the fish that made this stir fry extra special. And really fast and easy!

I have made this twice in the last two weeks.  I did not have celery salt so I just left it out and didn't use quite as much butter.  It did not seem to make a difference.  I also used a paremesan/romano blend.  Great recipe!

Really Great!  My mother-in-law has asked for the recipe twice... now that is good.  My kids think that Tilapia runs around in the barn, at the farm  because they don't eat fish.  Or so they think.  Thank you for one of the best recipes on All Recipes!  Superb!

Very good, very easy, very quick! Looks like you spent hours on this dish when you really just spent about 20 minutes from start to finish. I used paprika to give it more color.

This was really good. I didn't have any celery salt on hand but was still tasty without it. Next time I will put less  butter, it was too buttery for my taste. Will definetly do this again. Very easy for week nights dinner.

My family LOVES this recipe!  Even my husband who isn't crazy about fish.  I wondered how the mix of mayo and parmesian cheese would work, but after tasting it, I think it's perfect.  I mostly LOVE how quick it is to make.  My 2 yr old daughter LOVES this dish.Thanks.

This is a great reciepe!  The only thing I changed was a sprinkling of paprika over the top for color!  Next time I may try adding crushed Ritz Crackers into the mix!  Enjoy this recipe!  It is great!

Thanks so much Phoebe for posting this recipe.  I never cook fish and was quite intimidated, but this was very, very, very easy.  Made it exactly per the recipe and it was perfect.  Delicious!  In fact, I had to draw the line when my husband and little daughters requested it three times in one week.  Thanks again for sharing it!

Very nice recipe and so quick.  I cut back on the butter slightly, added 1 tsp fresh minced garlic, basil and red pepper flakes. Substituted celerey seed as per other reviewer. It was very good.  Served with broccoli rabe.

I had never used my broiler setting on my oven, nor had I ever cooked Tilapia...but this recipe was easy & actually very good for my first time!!
I will definitely be trying more fish recipes after such good luck with this one!  My BF thought I was crazy when I told him I was putting mayo on it, but it was really good.

My family is trying to add more fish to our diet and we have been looking for ways to cook it.  If my kids had ten thumbs, they would have given it ten thumbs up!

What a wonderful fish dish!  The salty topping with the sweet, juicy fish make for magic in your mouth.  And talk about easy - just mix the ingredients and broil up for a quick and delicious dinner your husband will think you slaved over ;)

we were fish newbies when my wife called and said she bought some fresh tilapia and didn't know what to do with it.  we previously had tried some tilapia that was cooked and frozen and liked it.  i googled it and found this recipe.  we love it and it is so easy!  still trying to get the kids to eat some.

This is a great recipe, easy and tasty! I actually used Mahi as it's my favorite. This was my first time preparing fish and it turned out great! Hubby loved it and my 11 and 9 year olds ate it too. I doubled the "sauce" and used light mayo for last 3 T. and used garlic salt instead of celery. Turned out really well. (we do like things salty though, so take that into account) Another tip, the rice I served with it took longer than I realized, so I took the fish out and had to wait 15 minutes...just waited for the last step of putting on the sauce and finishing. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

If I could give this more stars I would! This was one of the easiest and tastiest seafood recipes I have ever made!! I did double the sauce and added a little bit of minced garlic. I put the Tilapia in little foil boats to keep the sauce together. I also added a little more parmesan and topped with bread crumbs. The cooking time stated in this recipe was perfect!! This was so very wonderful! My only regret is that I did not try it sooner. Thanks for an easy and mouth watering recipe that I know we will make again and again!

AMAZING!!!! I used flounder instead of tilapia, but this is the kind of thing you could do with any fish I think. Made the recipe just as it is and I wouldn't change a thing. Absolutely loved it!

GREAT!!!  I added breadcrumbs and Old Bay seasoning into the mixture, as other members suggested.  Other than that, it's perfect.  So easy to make and is really wonderful to eat.  My brother has hated every type of fish we've made and he actually liked this one (it's the cheese!).

YUM!!  My boyfriend loves this, he requests it several times a month.  I usually only use 4 pieces of Tilapia and all of the "sauce".  My boyfriend likes the sauce on his rice, veggies & bread.  He would just eat it with a spoon if I would let him. So yes we love this!!

This was okay, but my topping didn't brown too well...I will try these again, because I probably did something wrong.  However, I don't know if this can substitute for the Easy Baked Tilapia recipe on this site.

This recipe was very tasty and so easy to make.  I'd been looking for a tilapia recipe so that I could finally bring myself to eat the fish and this did the trick.  My boyfriend thought it was great and even my brother (who does not eat tilapia) gave me a pat on the back.  I followed other reviewers suggestions and did not use the lemon juice, I only used 2 tablespoons of mayo.  I also added 1/2 teaspoon each of paprika, basil, and crushed red pepper flakes.  I did not have any celery salt on hand so I used a dash of garlic salt.  Also, I followed the cooking times exactly.  This was great and will make again...soon.

We aren't big fish eaters but loved this recipe.  We are attempting a more healthy eating lifestyle so we are bringing more fish into our diet.  This recipe made it easy  however, I wish it were lower in fat.

Great recipe, wish I could've had all the ingredients. I used dried tarragon instead and added some dry onion soup mix because I had no onion salt or celery salt. I really like the flavors and how it does not overpower the fish. I will use this again for a party and maybe try it on chicken breast. Thanks

This was really good and quick.  I cut it down to 4 servings which equals one bag of tilapia.  I sprinkled Mrs Dash on both sides before broiling and since I did not have onion powder I topped with fresh scallions.  This was the first time I ever tried this fish and will put this in my recipe drawer!

This recipe was a great start for a non-fish-eating family.  We discovered a fish-lover or two among us!  And I, who really do not like fish, managed to enjoy dinner as well... ;-)

This is such a nice change to pan-fried or grilled fish!  I used walleye filets but you could use any white fish.  It was easy to prepare and tasted like something you would order at a restaurant.  This is definately something I will prepare for guests.

We would not make this again. I dont know if it is because we are used to the fresh walleye out of the river or what, but we did not like this recipe at all.

I made this for dinner last night and my husband RAVED about it.  He doesn't usually enjoy fish so I was surprised at his reaction.  I made several changes due to my reading the instructions after putting the fillets in the oven.  I couldn't find my Parmesan cheese so substituted a provolone/mozzarella blend.  I also coated the fish prior to broiling.  They still came out fantastic.  I'm lucky this recipe is so forgiving.

This was a very good recipe. I am personally not a fan of mayonaise, so I used milk and a little extra butter. I forgot to half the recipe so I put the extra topping into some veggies I was frying up, it was delightful.

I practically followed this recipe exactly.  I didn't have any lemon and only used FF mayonaise since that's all I had.  The parmesan really compliments the fish and what a great mingling of flavors!  Quick to prepare and healthy!

Outstanding & so fast & easy.  I had never eaten or prepared Tilapia before.  Everyone loved it.  Excellent dish!  I will make this again.  Like other reviewers, I substituted approx. 1/2 of the butter called for w/ olive oil; Used about 1/2 of the mayo called for, added garlic powder, ommitted the celery salt but added Wildtree Herbs' Lemon Rosemary Blend.  I topped with a sprinkling of seasoned, dry breadcrumbs which gave it a nice finish.  Very, very impressive.  Thank you!

This was delicious!!!  My husband is a big fish lover and I am not such a fan, but he has been begging me to try out some new recipes.  I gave this one a shot and he said it was the best tilapia he has ever had!  I also LOVED it!  My feelings on fish have changed!

Broil fresh mushrooms at the same time as cooking the fish and at the end spoon on top for an added touch.  This dish is prefect every time! Love it!

Well, I didn't use the best fish in the world  (cheap frozen tilapia fillets) but this was still awesome.  The topping is that does it.  It is tricky to get the fish broiled just perfectly while also making sure to crisp the topping.  But this would work on just about any kind of fish.  We really enjoyed it.

Great recipe!  I don't like to change the original recipe on the 1st time, but I did season the fish a little before broiling, and I did add some bread crumbs as suggested by other reviewers and it came out fantastic.  Next time, though, I will cook for only about 1 1/2 min. on each side so that I can get a browner crust.  Very easy to overcook!

Made this last night- LOVED IT!!!! Will definitely make again. This recipe was so EASY and so QUICK- I recommend prebroiling the oven, making the mixture & setting aside, then cooking your sides first before concentrating on the fish because it simply only takes a few minutes! I used seafood seasoning instead of the celery salt, added a dash of regular salt, and left out the onion powder for personal preference, and this turned out beautiful & delicous. Very happy with this one- it's a keeper!

I make this quick recipe quite a bit.  Per one of the reviews I add breadcrumbs to the topping which helps it to stay on top of the fish as it broils.  I'm going to try it tonight with a brown rice pilaf.

Very good and couldn't be easier to make.  I made it for my son who isn't a huge fish fan, but likes tilapia and he said its "at least as good" as a local upscale restaurant he loves.  I didn't have celery salt so I just used fish seasoning and it was  great.

Super super super easy and a sure crowd pleaser.  DH had two helpings and the kids (3 and 6) gave it one thumbs up.  Hey... one thumbs up is a good thing when it comes to kids and fish right? LOL!  Will make again...

I made this for a friend of mine and she said it was the best food she'd had in months.  So easy and tasty.  I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing.

It was ok. I think I'd rather just have lemon juice and butter... My son loved it though. He thought it was "as good as McDonald's Filet O Fish"... ?!!

My husband and I have never really been fish eaters but because of the health benefits we wanted to give fish a try.  This recipe is absolutely amazing and it's soo easy and fast! I make this At Least once every two weeks! It is very yummy. Even my son (Very Picky eater) likes it.

OMGosh!!!!!!! This was beyond what I expected!  It was sooooooo very VERY tasty!  My fiance loved it and he is not one to rave about too many of my meals :-)  This is a keeper! I only made one changed and that was doubling the sauce.  No way would there have been enough if I would've followed the original.  Also, I didn't have celery salt so I used garlic salt.....yummy!!!!!!!!!! Thanks :-)

This was a very tasty and easy dish, and quick to whip up after a long day.  I used onion salt and celery seed because that is what I had on hand and I'm sure it didn't make a difference.  My husband is already asking for it again and he typically doesn't like fish.

I love it and shared the recipe with my friend.  She served it in her seafood restaurant as the special using flounder.  Everyone asked what was in it and raved about it.  She replied, "You know, a little of this and a little of that."  A definite keeper!

My whold family loved this recipe. I was worried that the fish would be dry from dry broiling it prior to adding the sauce but it was so moist! The herbs were lovely and this was just so easy. I will make this again!

I made this for my fiance and his mother. They both raved, but I like my fish topping to be crispy. It was very good and easy, though, and next time I'll just add some breadcrumbs to make it crispier.

I've never had tilapia before and chose this recipe because of the glowing reviews. I followed the directions exactly. It was okay, but I think the parmesan was a bit overpowering for this mild fish. I think next time, I'll try something milder. I do like this one well enough to try it again, though, and I wish there was an option to give it 3 1/2 stars.

excellent!  I always prefer to grill my fish, but this is a great oven recipe for a rainy or winter day.  It's attractive to serve, and delicious.  I cut back a little on the broiling time when my fillets are thin.  It doesn't take long to cook.  I also recommend fresh cheese as it gives extra flavor

I thought this was good but not great.  I cut the recipe in half as I only had about 1 lb of fish, but I wish I had made the full amount of sauce.  It was very quick and easy though.

I made this recipe again and I doubled the sauce and added 1 tsp of onion powder and 1 tsp of garlic powder and omitted the celery salt.  I loved it this time!

Oh my goodness this is delicious!! I was out of tilapia but had some small ocean perch fillets and used those instead. Followed the recipe to a T expect for fish substitution and will be making this again and again. So quick and easy...and did I mention delicious?

Just to add to the many other reviews, it was wonderful.  The first time I made it I used frozen filets, I don't recommend it, take the time to thaw, well worth the effort.  Plus I added some fresh dill.  Yum!  My husband loved it and I'm looking forward to making it for my mother.

I can't say enough about how good this is.  I don't like fish but I'm trying to eat healthier, so I tried this out (with BASA, though) and it blew me away.  Probably the only way I'll be cooking fish now.  I might even try it with chicken, too.

Very yummy! Next time I will cut back on the lemon juice because the kids thought it was too sour. I thought it was great. I did take others advice and use garlic instead of celery salt and I added bread crumbs. I am definately putting this recipe in our fish rotation.

Similar to other recipes on this site (slight variation).  We enjoyed it but I had a little more fish than required which therefore meant less sauce to cover the fish.  It was tasty but more sauce probably would have been slightly better.  I love the tangy flavour on this fish.

We always have Tilapia in the freezer. its a great fish, easy to cook, and not fishy tasting. So I am always looking for different ways to cook it. This was a BIG hit with me and my husband. Easy to cook and had great flavor.

SO good.  I did use butter subsitute and next time I'll probably place each fillet in its own foil boat as the topping does get sort of runny and everywhere.  Will also use less butter next time. Will make this again. Thanks.

I could not cook to save my life... however, I made this for dinner last night, and it was great!  It sure did get my boyfriend's approval (and HE'S the cook in the house!) The presentation was lacking (the Tilapia fell apart when I flipped it) but as I said, I am not a master chef, so this was fine with me. Tilapia in my opinion is a cheap, bland fish, but this recipe really brings out the best in it. I will definitely be making this for friends in the future!

This is a great and simple recipe.  I did add breadcrumbs and red pepper as well and it really made a difference.  Be sure to use fresh lemon juice as it gives the fish a great taste.  Also, be sure to season the fish first with Old Bay!

This was my first attempt at making a fish dish for my family.  It turned out great!  The topping is a little crumbly but practice will make perfect. My one suggestion is to make sure you cover the fish well with all the topping....where there was no topping, there was not much flavor.

In the minority here, but the entire family hated it. I made exactly according to recipe. I don't think the problem was so much with the topping and spices as it was with the "muddy" tasting fish. It might be better with a milder fish.

Awesome ! Subsituted Galic Salt for Celery Salt (Was out of Celery Salt). Helmans/Best Foods Mayo works the best! Use a real lemon ! 1/2 of a med Lemon will yield about 2 Tbs of juice. Very nice and easy.

This was really good even thought I messed it up a little. I used seasoned salt on the fish before I cooked it. I doubled the sauce. I used bread crumbs as other did. I just put 1 cup in...next time I will only put in 1/4 to 1/2 cup.

I don't think I did anything wrong so maybe it was just the fish, but my husband and I thought it was completely flavorless. I wasn't stingy with the sauce either and I added seasoning. Maybe it was just a bland flavor of fish. Sorry.

I love this recipe! I lightened it up a bit by using lite mayo, and margarine spread. I also didn't have lemon juice so I used lemon pepper (salt free). This is a quick and easy way to dress up tilapia!

One word:  Fantastic!  The first thing I thought when I saw the ingredient list is, how is this little dab of stuff going to end up as delicious as all of the reviews?  All I can say is majic!  I did coat the the filets with bread crumbs and I used 1 lb. of fish instead of two.  This was just the right amount of sauce.  My 3 yr. old gobbled it up, he thought it was chicken.  LOL  Perfect for a weeknight supper when your in a hurry, or an elegant dinner for company.

I make lots of fish and try many different recipes. This one is really good, but mine came out a little dry. Next time I may use a bit more dressing.

The flavor was pretty good but the sauce was so runny! Maybe the reduced fat mayo had something to do with the texture.

I hate baked fish but this is unbelievable.  The best I have ever had and literally takes 5 minutes to make.  I served with parmesan rice and steamed vegetables with garlic for a great meal.

This was amazing, it doesn't taste "fishy".  I'd never had tilapia before and I'm really glad I made this.  I actually made this with some steam fresh veggies & rice for 6 people it was amazing and the total cost was about $20!  I love good food that's affordable!  :)  The cheese sauce was soo good. Yummy.

10/13/18 - 

5/10/2007 - This was excellent!  So easy and quick to prepare and lots of flavor!  I did mine in the broiler and I never have luck broiling anything - next time I will do it in a baking pan with sides so I don't lose a drop of this delicious sauce and will just bake it - gives the same effect to me.  Even our two toddlers enjoyed it!  Delicious and highly recommended!

I was so excited to see the high ratings and high reviews for this recipe so I tried it. Unfortunately, my family and I didn't care for it.  The Parmesan cheese was too overwhelming (and I didn't use the full amount).

This was okay.  The kids liked it, my husband and I did not.  I used amberjack instead of tilapia, and it was really too thick.  The recipe would probably be better with a thinner, less meaty fish.  Very easy, though.

This is simply amazing!!!  The only change I make is adding breadcrumbs.  I'm inviting several people over this upcoming weekend and this is the dish I am going to make.  I live in FL and this beats any dish I've ever had, even in the expensive restaurants. Fantastic!!!!

This is such a wonderful recipe! it also has a wonderful "WOW" factor. I think this is as good if not better than any tilapia dish you get in a restaraunt. I do make one addition that is wonderful- I have started putting shrimp on top of sauce and it is awesome! I just sautee shrimp for a few minutes(not cooking all the way through) and add to fish to finish under broiler.

This was a great meal (had the tilapia with garlic mashed potatoes, broccoli and a few tomato wedges). Everything important was said already...all I can add to that is YOU MUST TRY IT.

My son who loves fish wouldn't finish his dinner he said he got bored of the flavour. I felt it just tasted like cesar dressing on the fish. I was very dissapointed that it didnt live up to its rating.

I made this once and it was good. I took some advice from other reviewers and added garlic powder to the parmesan mixture and sprinkled the fish with Old Bay. My broiler was broken at the time, so I baked the fish at 350 for 15 minutes. I would like to try broiling and adding bread crumbs.

Coming from a family of fish purists - tilapia being one of our favorites - I worried that this recipe would be gilding the lily. Instead, everyone felt that the topping really did enhance, rather than detract from, the naturally delicious flavor of the fish. This recipe is perfect for tweaking and experimentation and I look forward trying some different ingredients with it!! Thanks for the recipe!

Made this last night and the whole family loved it. Even my 11 year old, who hates fish and who won't even eat fried fish sticks, decided to try it and said, "This is really good, can I have some more."

This recipes is wonderful!  I can usually get more fish covered with the Parmesan mix that what is called for in the recipe - making it go even further.  My 9-year old daughter loves it so much she'll actually beg for fish for dinner!

I agree this would probably work very well on any fish. Since I'm a vegetarian and don't eat fish or meat, my boyfriend said this tasted very good for a farmed fish that usually tasted like mud!

I LOVED this recipe.  We went fishing and I made it with fresh fish-trout.  My family doesn't eat fish-only me-sad to say.  Topping was really great.  Perfect mix of flavors.  Reheated well.  Highly recommend!

Very good, did this for friends and even a fish hater thought it was delicious. Followed the reccomendations and added paprika and bread crumbs to the sauce. I do wish I would have made more sauce though as it didn't completely cover my pieces. I paired this with lemon asparagus and rissotto. For dessert I had made panna cotta. It was a great dinner that will be repeated many times over.

This recipe was awesome.  Both my husband and my 2 year-old loved it.  It definitely didn't need all the butter. I cut it in half and would maybe even use less next time.   Adding a little dill made it even better.  PS- This is now a standard in our house as well as my mom's and my sister's.  My kids love it and eat a whole piece each (ages 2 and 4).  It is a great way to get them to like fish.

Excellent flavor and quick to prepare.  Will make this again soon.  I didn't have celery salt so I used seasoned salt and dried italian seasoning instead of basil.

I made this last week and my son asked when I was making it again. So good, easy and fairly inexpensive. I had found tilapia fillets for 2.98/lb.  Will be a regular at our house.

This was really good -- even my 6 and 9 year olds ate it and they are PICKY eaters!!  I also added a littel breadcrumbs to the cheese mixture.  Watch it carefully so it doesn't burn.  Will definitely make this easy dinner dish again!

"Best Fish dish I've had in I don't know how long!" said my husband after his 3rd helping!  Even my daughter (who was not looking forward to eating this fish) quite liked it and that is saying a lot.  Needless to say, I can see why this recipe receives such rave reviews.  In addition to being wonderful, it is easy and calls for common ingredients.  A note:  I was out of dried basil (so I used some fresh) and out of onion powder so used the about 1-2 teaspoons dried onion pieces) and even without following the recipe to a "T", it was fantastic.  If you're reading this, stop and save this one to your recipe box ... right now!

Wow!! Excellent recipe. We loved it. Like others, I added paprika and Old Bay seasoning to the sauce. I am not usually a fan of mayonnaise, but I worried for nothing. The sauce was not over-powering, but a great compliment to the fish. My five filets were a little less than 2lbs. so we have a little sauce left over. I am freezing it to serve as a grilled shrimp dipping sauce later this week. Great recipe!

This came out perfect!  The sauce added to a mild fish.  This is a no brainer for folks who don't eat fish often.

This is a GREAT recipe!! I made it the other night and we both loved it!! You have to make sure that you don't cook the Tilapia too long because you still want it to be moist. But I seasoned the fish with Old Bay seasoning and that was about the only difference I did. GREAT GREAT recipe. Very easy to make and comes out great. Has been added to my frequent meal selections!

We don't eat a lot of fish in our household so when I suggested this for dinner, my husband was skeptical.  After a few bites he said, "This is a keeper!"  I love how fast this recipe is to prepare and cook!

DEFINITELY A KEEPER!  Followed previous suggestions of sprinkling with Old Bay, increasing the pepper, added bread crumbs and a pinch of garlic.  Not a crumb was left over.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

My husband made it with parmesan cheese that you normally sprinkle on pizza and without the onion powder... still great and quick. I can't wait to try it again with the proper ingredients!

The kids loved it. I'm not a big fish user, but they enjoy it. I substituted white fillets for tilapia because that is what I had available. I added extra ground pepper and used garlic salt instead of onion powder and celery salt.

Finally, a five star recipe that lives up to the hype! I loved this fish...it's so quick, easy, and flavorful. I just wish it was more healthy. At least it will get me eating more fish.I made it with frozen basa basa filets, used an italian four cheese blend, light mayo, margarine instead of butter, celery seed instead of salt, and omitted the onion powder because I didn't have any. I was cooking for one 
so I just kind of eyeballed the measurements, so I think this is a pretty forgiving recipe. I've made it twice already!

Oh my god this was the easiest and best fish I have ever made.  It literally took me all of 15 minutes to get it on the table. It made it even easier that I served it with some steamed broccoli.  The only way I differed from the recipe… I halved the fish but forgot to do the same for the topping, therefore it was very buttery.  
I didn’t use quite as much mayo as was called for and basically just squirted some lemon juice instead of measuring.
I didn’t really pay much attention to what spices it called for, I have been obsessed with garlic pepper lately, so of course that went on it.  I also put a little grated cheese on top before I stuck it in the oven.  Completely awesome, we will definitely be having this again!

This recipe was EXCELLENT.  I even used frozed tilapia that I thawed and didnt put in onion powder.  I used 1 tsp of sour cream in place of the mayo.  Will definately put this on my favorites list!  Another plus-- this was SO easy and quick to make.

I tried this recipe last night with a few small changes.  I used white pepper instead of black and omitted the onion powder and celery salt.  I added about a tablespoon of chopped fresh chives.  If you decide to use the celery salt, keep in mind the cheese contains a lot of salt itself.  This was a BIG hit and received rave reviews from all family memebers.  There was not so much as a crumb left!  Thank you for a delicious recipe that had definitely become a new favorite!

I thought that this was pretty good.  I really liked how it was very moist and it was cooked perfectly.  I think I'll decrease the mayo next time just because I'm not a huge fan in the first place.

My husband (who hates fish) absolutly loved this recipe.  I couldn't make enough!  The only changes I made was omitting the lemon as suggested (she was right, you don't need it) added bread crumbs and I had some baked garlic on hand, so I added that too.   YUM.  Thanks for this great recipe.

Gotta give this recipe 5 stars, it's just that good.  First dinner I made for my boyfriend, and he loved it.  :)  I'm a beginner cook, and in my opinion it's a simple dish.  Oh, and the sauce is SO delicious, you should make at least the portions described in the recipe, if not more.
In terms of modifications, I skipped the celery salt (didn't have any) and added bread crumbs to thicken the sauce as recommended by others.  Also followed broiling instructions provided by "Sheila in Texas" and fish came out fine.  Next time, I will try adding some cajun powder or cayenne pepper on the fish, just to experiment with adding some heat to the dish.
Paired the fish with Asparagus Cashew Rice Pilaf, which I also highly recommend!  Overall, it was a wonderful meal.  Will definitely make again.  :)

I am not a big fish fan, but this was delicious!  I cleaned my plate very quickly.  I used garlic powder instead of celery salt and sprinkled fish with Old Bay (as others suggested).  Also, I added breadcrumbs as others suggested but maybe too many as there wasn't really a "sauce" more like a coating on the fish--but YUMMY!

Absolutely delicious and super easy! I've served this twice at dinner parties and everyone loved it. The fish is done in literally minutes, so it also makes for a very quick weekday meal.

Delicious! Neither my husband nor I are big fish eaters, but we both agree that this is now part of our regular rotation. I didn't change a thing, and it turned out great! Thanks!

This is EXCELLENT! So easy and quick to make too. The only changes I made were to salt and pepper the fish before broiling them and I omitted the butter... it just doesn't need it. I served with steamed broccoli and brown rice. DELICIOUS!

I didn't particularly care for the "fishy" taste, but my fiance & daughter loved it.  The sauce part was yummy, but I wish it was thicker.  I'm just not a seafood lover, I guess!  Good thing they liked it!

I love this recipe!! You can adjust it to whatever you have on hand. I preseasoned the fish filets w/ blackened redfish seasoning (which gave it a nice kick), substituted the original ingeredients w/ whole celery seed, garlic salt, and sprinkled panko breadcrumbs over the top. My family gobbled this down.  My only tip would be to carefully watch the time. It's FAST!!

WOW - I am not a fish lover, can't stand a fishy taste, but this was excellent.  Have tried frozen talapia before and didn't like it, but found fresh farm raised talapia in my local HEB and now have a favorite fish dish...

What a great taste this adds to the fish. I just wish there were a way to omit or reduce the butter. Tasted delicious, but kept thinking of my waist growing!

I made this recipe this evening (almost)just as the recipe says (did sub celery seed for the celery salt)and LOVED it.  I was afraid that the parmesan would overpower the fish but it came out great and I will definitely make it again!  
I made a spur of the moment Pistachio Lemon Rice Pilaf to go with it and it went with it well.

I don't like fish and I really liked this!  I sprinkled breadcrumbs on the top as someone else suggested, next time I'll try adding some to the sauce to thicken it a little.  Unfortunately none of the rest of my family liked it, but I still give it 5 stars!

Awesome! This was the first time I have ever tried to cook fish. I became a seafood lover only a short time ago. My husband said it was the best fish he has ever had and my daughter, who has NEVER eaten fish, loved it. It is the best fish I have ever had, including all of the resturants I have eaten which include a 5 star seafood resturant. It was so easy! This is going to be on our weekly rotation.

I have made this recipe twice, and my husband licks the pan every time, LITERALLY!  It is the best way to cook Tilapia that I have ever used.  The sauce is so tasty, and the broiling times listed are ideal!  I serve mine with brown rice and asparagus.  The mixture broiled over the fish tastes great with the asparagus as well!!

Cut the recipe down to three servings and made it for my husband and I.  We both LOVED it!  I didn't have celery salt, so I just used Kosher salt and I used a splash more lemon than recommended.  It was perfect!!

Yum!  My husband really doesn't like fish but I insist on serving it every so often.  He will only eat it smothered in a fattening sauce.  He actually went out of his way to tell me he liked this.  I will be making it again!

So easy to make!  Loved that!  And the whole family loved it too.  I didn't have onion powder, so I used garlic powder....tasted great.  Made it with Mom's Brussel Sprouts that I found in the veggie section on All Recipes.com

Thanks for the great recipe.  Will definitely make again!

This was quick and easy.  I made mine w/o celery salt because I was out.  I also cut down the amounts (roughly - I estimated) because I was only cooking two filets, not 2 lbs.  My husband loved it, and my whole meal was done in 15 minutes start to finish!

Wonderful as the recipe calls for, although a bit runny, I'm certain that adding breadcrumbs would help a bit with the spreading.  I also did a big, huge modification by using shrimp I broiled with Old Bay Seasoning, I boiled up bow tie pasta, put it all in a bowl and made a double batch of the topping with too many breadcrumbs.  The topping melted down wonderfully in the pasta and the shrimp were just right.  It made a lovely crusty yummy along the top and we couldn't stop eating it.

Super fast and easy.  Did not use celery seed or onion powder, as I didn't have any.  seasoned w/salt and pepper, TrueLemon crystals.  Used Tastefully Simple Tomato Pesto blend instead of basil and EVOO.  Loved the flavor of the parm and lemon with this delicately flavored fish.  Very versatile recipe to use on any light flavored fish.

Very good and SUPER easy. I broiled it on a foiled lined pan then just threw the foil away - only one dish to wash! I added some extras in, as suggested by Shannon. (paprika, garlic powder, crushed red pepper, bread crumbs) I omitted the onion powder, as I didn't have any and used no-fat mayo. It was great, however next time I'll leave out or reduce the amount of garlic powder that I used. This is a once a week recipe!

DELICIOUS!  I followed the advice to season the fish before broiling and used Lemon Pepper and Garlic Salt.  The cheesy, lemon topping was the hit with this dish and we ate every bite.  I will definitely make this again.

I don't like fish particularly much but I tried this recipe and now I'm an extreme fan! The fish is very mild. I add a little more parmesan, and although the recipe didn't specify, grated and shredded work just fine. Served with wild rice and steamed veggies, FABULOUS! ***update*** I've made this many times and I followed the advice of others and sprinkled the fish with old bay seasoning and then put the parmesan mixture on top. It was really good!!

I think tilapia is better with a simple store bought teriyaki or sesame ginger marinade. It was OK, but sooo greasy and eeeh.

Easy to make and very good. Even DH liked it and he always eats fried fish. I served it with yellow rice, asparagus and a tossed salad. Next time I probably will use a little less butter.

Loved this recipe.  I put a layer of mushrooms on the tinfoil and broiled with seasonings for a few minutes first. It made a great broiling bed for the fish.  I was doubtful at first, but the sauce was delicious. I found myself scraping the leftovers off of the tinfoil at cleanup. Don't tell on me.

I have to be honest...I never got to try it.  I made it for my family while I went to a meeting.  It smelled really good while I was cooking it and when i got home it was gone!  My husband and my daughter loved it!  I will definately make it again.

Very easy and excellent flavor. I added pinko bread crumbs and red pepper as Shannon’s review suggested. Didn’t have lemon but was still very tasty.

Perhaps I made a mistake, but I found this to be too rich.  I guess it was the mayo/cheese combination.  It certainly wasn't awful, but I don't plan to have this again.

I tried this hoping to change my opinion on fish.  It was good as far as fish goes.  The topping was awesome.  I took the advice of adding bread crumbs.  If you're a fan of fish, this is the recipe to try!!

this was excellent and made my house smell excellent for hours. it's all very soft though, so if you like more of a crust on your fish, add breadcrumbs.

I'm pretty sure I must have done something wrong. There was too much butter for me.. and the topping didn't stay on. Maybe I took it out too soon?

My favorite recipe by far. Even my picky 17-year old loves this fish. I will be making this for years to come.

This was great and FAST!  I don't usually like fish but we all loved it!
I usually bake it in the oven for 30min at 350, covered in foil . Then I broil it for a few minutes to brown the cheese. MUCH moister that way.

I really liked this recipe and will for sure be making it again. Even my picky three year-old really liked it and asked for seconds. The cheese topping had a wonderfully rich flavor that didn't over power the natural flavor of the fish but rather complimented it very well. My only problem with this recipe (as others have mentioned) is that the cheese topping mixture didn't stay put very well once broiled. Of what did stay on top of the fish, was very delectable.

Very easy and delicious recipe. Even my husband who hates mayonnaise loves it! The only thing I like to add, like some other reviewers, is a little bit of italian bread crumbs.

We make tilapia once a week, and I'm always looking for new ways to try it.  This is definitely my favorite way so far!  Delicious.  My husband and 3 year old daughter loved it too.  We wished we had doubled the recipe because we were left wanting more!

This was ok. It was a tad too salty...I'm guessing from the Parmesan? But still pretty good. :)

Oh MY! This is wonderful!! I added a little bit of jalepeno, and served it with angel hair pasta. It was EASY, and tasted just like the restaurant Johnny Carino's Jalepeno Tilapia!! YUM YUM!!

this is by far the easiest and best fish recipe out there - vary the cheese topping with your favorite seasoning.  i chill it before spreading so I can dollop it on and let it melt down

I'm sure it's just my personal preference, but the thick cheesy sauce was too much for the fish :(... Of course, this may be a good recipe to trick kids and others that won't eat fish into liking it :)

Everyone in my family really enjoyed this recipe. I personally thought it was fine, but not outstanding...could have been the fish specimen. Served with risotto. It is VERY fast to make and quite easy. Make sure EVERYTHING else is ready before broiling the fish.

This was super easy, I loved the well-spelled out directions, and I will make it again, however, I'll cut in half (at the very least) the mayo and butter. The flavor is wonderful though!

It was okay.  Edible but not lovely.  I used fresh garlic and celery... and fresh parmesan cheese... but it was just okay.  I'll say one thing, though.  The sauce really covered up the taste of the fish... thanks for the recipe.

Delicious!! Eyeballed all the ingredients. Didn't have Onion powder. Used presesoned Tilapia...cajun flavor. Super Yummy! My boyfriends said definitely have to make again. I think I'll add crab and breadcrumbs and make this as a filling instead.

I was not particularly thrilled by this recipe. The topping was okay, but had a wierd texture and the fish was bland. My son liked it, but my husband and I were not impressed. I will not make it again.

Perfect as is! We'll do this one again and again. Sauce was perfectly light, delicious and complimentary to the fish. Fantastic in every way. Thanks for a great recipe!

My husband and I loved this recipe!  It was wonderful with fresh tilapia and as recommended by some other cooks I added some breadcrumbs (italian) and used garlic salt instead of celery salt (didn't have any)  My huby made me promise to make again regularly- he complained that I didn't make enough for him to have seconds!

AMAZING! I cant believe I got my husband to eat this who doesnt like fish! I didnt add the lemon because I didnt have any, nor did I have celery salt. However it was absolutely divine. I will make this forever! I am SO impressed with this recipe. Just taste it for yourself!

Wonderful.  I used the suggestion about the Old Bay seasoning and the breadcrumbs and the paprika,garlic powder, etc.  I didn't use the lemon juice and it was just perfect.

This was a very simple recipe to follow that didn't require too many ingredients that most people do not already have at home. Plus, it tasted wonderful. I did use the suggestions of other users and added paprika, garlic, and onion powder. I definatly will be making this again.

I think this recipe has great potential with a few modifications.. first off, next time I will cut down on the lemon juice (lemon flavor was a little much for us) and add some minced garlic/garlic salt in its place...and second off, I will try it with mahi fillets.. im not a huge tilapia fan to begin with but i think the fish was to delicate for the creamy topping.. other than that this was a great recipe..!

Incredibly wonderful!  It's a keeper, says my son.  I am going to be looking for ways to cut down a little on fat content. I will go back and read the reviews to see if anyone had any ideas to have something this good, but a tad bit healthier.  No complaints here, though.  This is fantastic!

This is the only fish recipe we use at our house now.  I make it a little less fattening with just 2 Tablespoons of Butter and 2 Tablespoons of Mayo.  Sometimes I change up Lemon Juice with Lime Juice.  I think that using fresh juice makes the fish extra good.  Other than that the recipe is DELICIOUS!

I guess we are just not fish people (unless coated in a batter). I thought the topping was nice enough, perhaps a bit salty in places. The fish underneath still tasted bland. The husband ate it politely but asked that I not make it again. I might try the topping on chicken, but for us this is a no.

This was pretty good.  I used too much sauce on the fish though.  Next time I will use a little less.

Easy, Delicious. I used no mayo, I can't believe its not butter, parmesean, and pepper, and dried thyme. We make it regularly.

Made this for dinner last night.  I used lite mayo and a little sea salt instead of the celery salt.  It was delicious.  I will definitely be making this again.

My entire family including all the kids loved this recipe.  It was the best fish recipe we ever tried.  I used fat free mayo and kow fat parmesan cheese since we are trying to eat healthier.  We ate baked asparagus as a side dish.  We will definitely be cooking this again.  Thanks for the GREAT recipe.

This tilipia was AMAZING! I loved every bite! The only change I made was that I used light mayo, and I topped it with some capers when it came out of the oven. I look forward to making it again!

This recipe was incredible! It was perfect for those who don't like "fishy" fish (like myself). Be careful not to overcook the fish.

This is one of the best fish recipes I have ever tasted.  My partner could not get enough.  I used some minced onions (instead of onion powder), a little garlic and added some Panko bread crumbs, in addition to the rest of the ingredients.  YUM

MMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!!! That's all I can say. Definitely a company worthy meal. Tastes like it took all day. No leftovers! Only thing I did differently was to double the recipe, add breadcrumbs and subbed celery salt for celery seed because I didn't have any. Otherwise followed to a "T".

This is an excellent way to prepare talapia! It is also great for low-carb dieting. I didn't have any basil, so I used oregano and parsley and it was still delicious. Thanks for the recipe!

This is the best fish I have ever made! I will definitely be making this regularly. I did use a few of the recommendations from  others. I used old bay seasoning and low fat mayo. I highly recommend this recipe to any new cook because it is very easy and delicious.

I made this last night with catfish. I liked the flavor but I don't think it went well with catfish. I went to two grocerie stores and a meat market looking for tilapia and everyone was out. The catfish was too thick and meaty and I think that took over the flavor. I need to try it again but this time using tilapia. I hope I get better results.

Very very good, very very easy!  My husband loves this and even asked for it for his birthday dinner.  The first time I made I followed the recipe exactly, but after that I have added breadcrumbs, because we like it better that way.  Also, I have tried this with other types of fish, and tilapia is the best.

This has been a hit w/my husband and my family.  I don't even use the butter, the topping is rich enough w/o it.  I do sometimes make a double batch of topping because we love it so much.  I also use Nature's Seasoning as  a substitute for the onion, celery salt and pepper spices.

I had to improvise a bit by using halibut instead of tilapia (I live in Spain and I've never seen tilapia here), but it turned out fine. My picky husband said it deserved five stars, so here they are. UPDATE: After making this many times with halibut, I finally found tilapia, so tried it in this recipe. What a disappointment...it wasn't nearly as good. I will stick to halibut in the future.

This was absolutely delicious!  It is probably the best thing I have ever made in my entire life.  I am not exaggerating.  Even my boyfriend loved it, and he hates seafood.  I will definitely be making this again.  Plus it was so quick and easy to make.  Thank you so much for this excellent recipe.

I hated farm fish before I tried this recipe and I still hate farm fish after. The topping couldn't cover the smell & taste, the tilapia I used must have been raised in a mud puddle. The topping was good, will use it on wild fish.

Yum! My husband & I LOVED it. Not low fat, unfortunately, but that is probably why it tastes so good. I halved the recipe, but wished I would have doubled it. Great recipe for company. Tastes like something from a pricey restaurant, but very easy to make. My husband said to "bookmark" this recipe. I will definitely make it again.

This was great!  We don't usually like to mix fish and cheese but it was very light and not over-powering at all.  I will definately make it again.  Plus there is a lot of room to "play" with the recipe to change it up a little!

This was good for a fish recipe. The talapia I had was a little too "fishy", but this sauce helped mask some of that.

This was excellent. I haven't cooked fish very often, but this was easy and had wonderful flavor. I broiled it exactly the time indicated and it was perfect. My husband absolutely loved it--said it tasted like something you would get at an upscale restaurant.  It even tasted good warmed up the next day. Definitely a keeper.

This was very good.  Freshly grated parmesan added great flavor.  The only thing I didn't like was the oiliness/greasiness.  I might skip the mayo next time.

This is a great and super easy recipe. My picky hubby even had seconds and told me to make it again. I made a little less fish b/c we like a lot of sauce and I think it would have been plenty even if I had made the full 2lbs.

This was so awesome.  I made it last night.  My husband also does not like fish but he loved this.  My 10 year-old son loved it too.  We were going to grill them but it started raining.  I had already wrapped them in foil, so I went ahead and broiled them in foil for about 7 or 8 minutes with the topping already on.  Then I opened the foil and let them broil for a few more minutes.  I checked them and when they were flaky with a fork I knew they were ready. A really awesome recipe!

This was excellent - always fried tilapia but this is much healthier, takes less time and does not smell up the kitchen and the bonus is that it tastes AMAZING

This was great. Couldn't get Tilapia so I used Catfish and it was wonderful. Hubby said this could probably work with boneless, skinless chicken breast also. It's a keeper!

Great recipe!  The only thing that I chaged was that I added 1/2 cup of italian bread crumbs the the cheese mixture to make it thicker!  I loved it and so did my dinner guest!

I give this one 4 stars instead of 5 only because of the fat content. Otherwise it was a great dish! We enjoyed the taste, although I wish I hadn't listened to another reviewer who suggested adding more lemon juice. I did and it was way too lemony. Very tasty recipe! Thanks!

Very Tasty.  Next time I will probably lightly bread the tilapia and then oven bake  a bit before adding the topping.  I will definately add this to our rotation.

Very tasty! I used parmigiana reggiano, so only used 1/4 cup since it's so strong. However, this caused the mixture to be too runny b/c it was mainly butter. This may be one instance where cheaper (regular parmesan) is better! Also, don't sub salad dressing for the mayo - the flavor is too strong.

I thought this dish was very tasty, but I did have a problem with it.  I put the fish on a broiler pan, and when I added the cheese/butter mixture it slid right off the fish, and into the bottom of the broiler pan!  I tried to get it back up onto the fish before it was totally lost...anyone have any tips?  The combination of the hot fish topped with the butter, which immediately began to melt, was not working for me.  I think my husband would've liked it better if it had been more cheesy.  If I make it again I may try some Jack cheese, as he is not a huge fan of Parmesan.

Really, really good.  Just pull our frozen talapia in the am and takes minutes to prepare the topping.  Delicious with salt,pepper and garlic seasoning on fish while broiling and do add the breadcrumbs.  Served with baked whole cauliflower from this site and rice.  Yummy!!!!!

Very yummy!  I added bread crumbs to the cheese mixture, which makes it nice and crunchy.  It is very rich, so I don't think I'd recommend it for those who don't like cheesy, buttery goodness, but my husband and I both loved it!

I've made this recipe at least ten times in the last year.  And every time I get compliments.  We love it, even my two young boys!  The only change is that I mince some onion, because I don't have onion powder.  We will continue to make this frequently.

My favorite thing to make for fish lovers and fish haters alike, and soooooo easy. This is a very stress free but impressive dinner to make for guests, or a nice, quick meal on the days when you get home late from work.  Everyone asks for this recipe!

This was my first time  making fish and it turned out great!  Quick, easy and very tasty!  My only problem was I used 1 pound of tilapia instead of two but I made the full amount of sauce. (Thinking it's better to have too much than too little.) And it turned out to be the perfect amount for 1 pound.  Thank you so much for the wonderful recipe!!

While I have never been a huge lover of fish now that im in my 30's a good diet is more important than ever. I made this for my family and they loved it. Will make it on a regular basis from now on. ps. Everytime I buy Tilapia now my husband knows what im going to make (since I don't make any other recipes with fish besides this one! Thanks again for a great delicious recipe!!!

My husband is not a big fish eater, so I have been trying a few recipes to see if I can get him to eat more of it.  He absolutely loves this one, as do I.  He has asked me to make it several times already.  It is very delicious.  I just have trouble with the cheese topping, it slips off of the fish, but other than that, fabulous recipe.

Easy and excellent!  I usually do not like fish, but this was exceptional!  No need to use all the butter as the low fat mayo has enough to work!  I bought the prepackaged tilapia at Costco.  Enjoy!

This is every bit as good as the other reviewers have said!  We had a little less than a pound of talapia, so I cut the recipe in half.  I also used onion salt and not celery salt, but the total flavor was wonderfil.  I found that margarine, low-fat Miracle Whip, and grated parmesan made a wonderful coating, and my husband and daughter requested more of this "yummy, non-fishy fish."  This one is a keeper!

Absolutely love this recipe. I love that it gets my family to eat fish and love it. I am requested to make this recipe at least once a week.

Very good and very kid friendly--mine wanted seconds!  I only gave it four stars because I felt there was too much topping.  This would be great over rice with some asparagus on top for some color.

This fish is great for people who aren't big seafood lovers. The topping was delicious!! Next time, maybe we'll double the topping so that there is a bit more to dip the fish into. The tilapia had a great flavor...not too fishy!

This is, as my friend Steph would say, superfablous.  I made 2 1/2 pounds and doubled the sauce.  My four kids were literally cleaning the pan with their fingers!!!

This is great.  The only trouble I had was keeping the mix on the fish.  As the butter melts it tends to slide off on to the pan.  It may have been the pieces I was using but I don't think so.  I may try just heating it up in a pan and drizzling over when served next time.

This is wonderful! I have made it several times now, following the recipe exactly as it appears. My whole family likes it, which is a miracle, since I am not the best chef when it comes to fish. I serve it with couscous. Thank You for this great recipe!

Excellent flavor! Me and my husband make our 7 year old son's plate and get him started before we make our own-he had eaten all of his fish by the time we got to the table! I seasoned the tilapia with old bay first- it conflicts with the parmesan. Next time I will use garlic instead, or maybe nothing at all. This was very easy and VERY GOOD!!

Excellent! I did not have the onion or celery salt, so I used salted butter and dried onion flakes and two small cloves of fresh garlic.  A 1/2 of a fresh squeezed lemon added the perfect zing and the scent of the creamy mixture was intoxicating and the fish was delish!  I can see why non-fish eaters would like this recipe too!  This recipe is super fast to prepare and broil, but, it is definitely not a "healthy" fish recipe - however, being so yummy, we really won't care in the future!

Very easy and satisfying. I used tartar sauce instead of mayonnaise and no celery salt and it still worked out great. I just think it needs a little bit less lemon juice than suggested. We will definately make often.

I made this recipe tonight.  Please understand that my husband and I are not big fish eaters, however this recipe was very easy, and the meal was great.  The side dish I used was chinese fried rice, which went very well with the Tilapia.  Both my husband and I agreed that this recipe is a keeper.

Probably my favorite recipe I've found here on Allrecipes.com.  I make this often. Lately I've added a couple of tablespoons of seasoned bread crumbs on top of the filets. They brown up nicely. Yummmm!!

This was quite good.  The cheese mixture was hard to spread on the fish- fingers seemed to work best!

I didn't change a thing on this recipe.  It was wonderful just like it is.  I plan to use the sauce in other ways - it would be delicious on chicken breasts!  Thank you, Phoebe:~)

I wanted to add a post script to this review:  I often send a sample of my newest recipes to a guy that works with my husband.  He called me after eating this and tried like he usually does to guess the ingredients.  He thought that since the sauce was kind of lumpy (because I used fresh grated parmeson) that perhaps the lumps were crabmeat.  He was very impressed when I shared how easy (and economical)this recipe actually was!

Awsome recipe! I served it over steamed spinach with rice on the side. The sauce with spinach is awesome! My daughter and husband loved it. Next time I may double the topping for extra sauce.

MMMMM!  This recipe was really good!  I subsitituted sour cream for mayo because I don't care for mayo.  Add a little lemon juice on top for an extra kick!

A nice change from the usual way I cook it (baked, with not a lot of flavor). Even my hubby, who's not a big fish fan liked it so much he had seconds! I accidentally used 1/2 c. butter so I had to double the recipe. (Had a LOT left over). Probably just as good on chicken breasts.

I was really looking forward to this recipe.  Cause I wanted to try different fish.  But I didn't like this one.  I didn't like the texture.  It was to gritty.  Maybe I don't mix it well.

Delicious!  I made this for one Lenten Friday and it was great!  Super easy and has a wonderful taste.  My husband enjoyed this different take on fish.  Even my 4 year old son loved it, and he doesn't do fish much!  I served it with 
French fries and coleslaw.  Will definately make again!

This was so good. The fish cooks up quickly and once you have added the parmesan sauce, broils to browned and bubbly fast. The sauce adheres well to the fish and makes a simple white fish very elegant. What a treat!

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe.  I will probably make it many more times.  I think the taste of tilapia is really bland, but this topping dressed it up so much that it was truly enjoyable, not to mention SUPER easy.

This is the most simple yet delicious recipe.  Serve it with a lettuce salad and some bread, and dinner is done in 15 minutes max.  Last time I made this my four year old asked for three helpings and keeps asking me to make it again!  I will gladly oblige!

This is a keeper for sure.  My fiance is the worst at trying new things,and requested that I make it again two days after trying it.  I know its a sure thing now.  The flavors are wonderful!

Very Good. We're on a Low Carb diet here and this was perfect. I may broil it longer with the cheese topping to get that brown crispy taste next time.

Absolutely easy and delicious!  Everyone in my family loved this dish.  I was afraid at first that it would end up greasy and overwhelm the fish, but the cheese mixture broiled into a light coating and beautiful presentation.  I will be making this one over and over again!  Thanks!

Probably the best fish recipe I have ever had.
I made the coating the night before.  Had dinner ready in about 8 minutes.

This was so FAST! I had the tilapia in the fridge and from fridge to table it took about 10 minutes. You have to like parmesan cheese for this one, but since we do, we loved it. It is especially wonderful served over long-grain rice. A definite "make-it-again" recipe.

I have been fixing tilapia for years and this is the best recipe I have found. The flavor of the cheese mixture is so good. I fixed it last night for dinner and my husband raved about it. I made just 2 fillets so I cut the cheese mixture in half and had just the right amount. Thanks for a wonderful, tasty recipe. It will difinitely be in my favorites box!

My husband and I liked it and he doesn't usually like fish unless it is deep fried. I didn't have lemon, so used lemon pepper instead. Used low-fat mayo and finely shredded parmesan. Waited till topping got a little brown; it was excellent.

This was our first time eating tilapia, and we thought it was good, but not great. I halved the recipe, and didn't feel like there was enough of the sauce. I did reduce the butter, so this may have been part of the reason for this. This was very easy and quick, and I may make again with extra sauce. The tilapia was cooked perfectly with the given times.

Wow!  I was impressed.  I didn't think it would turn out this well, as I don't even really like tilapia, but this was excellent!  Plus, it was super easy to make.  I made the recipe exactly as written.  The only thing I would change is to maybe broil the fish once it has the topping on it a little closer to the broiler so that it actually browns (I think ours was a bit too far away so it just got melty... we didn't want to overcook the fish).  But pretty much any fish would taste good in this recipe!

I love this recipe!  My only suggest is, if you can afford it, spring for the good grated parmesan cheese that you can usually find in the deli isle.  It greatly enhances the flavor.  This recipe works great with other meats and fish as well and is quick and easy!

This is fabulous. I made some simple changes such as using lime juice concentrate and dill instead of basil. Also added a crushed clove of garlic and some diced onions and tomatoes to the mix. My husband said it was the best fish  he had ever had. I'm passing it on to my friends and family.

My husband and I just love Talapia, and this recipe definately does it justice.  I did not have the celery salt, so I omitted that one ingredient.  (I have since tried it with the celery salt, but prefer the flavor without.)I have used key lime juice in place of lemon juice, and it adds an interesting twang to the meal. i have tried shaved parm from the chilled grocery section, but found this changed the texture too much, so i go back with the ground parm instead. This recipe has become my go to recipe when making tilapia.

Pretty good.  The texture is a bit different at first, kind of like scrambled eggs.  But, it is really good.  We had some tartar sauce with it.

This recipe is terrific. I can't believe the taste! Delicious! It is quick and easy to prepare, too. I scaled the recipe down to two servings, and it came out perfectly. I will be using this recipe again soon.

OMG, this is wonderful!  Made exactly as recipe calls and the whole family loved it.  Even my son who has never been fond of baked/broiled fish.  I think it would be equally good for broiling chicken breasts.  I'm going to try that soon.  A SUPER recipe!

very delish. i didnt have celery salt or onion powder so i omitted it. i used garlic powder and some italian breadcrumbs. i also didn't use as much parmesean as the receipe asked for. i thought the tilapia would be a little overcooked but it came out very,very good. i will definitely half the amt of butter next time.

This was so awesome!!! The first time I cooked it I used the exact recipe--very rich and wonderful. The second time, I lightened it up by using light mayo and light margarine.  It was still excellent!!

Awesome! A great recipe that can be followed without adjustments. Tilapia is a great mild tasting fish, and this recipe compliments it very well. I served it with steamed asparagus and rice.

Delish!!!!  I am NOT a seafood eater.  Never liked it, but my husband loves it and since it's been a couple of years since I've made any I thought it was time.  This recipe has changed my thinking completely.  The fish is so mild and the sauce is perfect.  My kids also told me to put it on our "favorites" list.

Broiling fish fillets is so quick, and the parmesan mix is a great complement to it.  Served with some potatoes and veggies it is an easy and delicious meal.

An amazing recipe!  This is good for seafood and even non seafood lovers as the sauce covers up any "fishy" taste!  A big hit with my husband!!  The fish was moist and delicious and melted in my mouth.  Will make again!

My husband and I did not really like the cheese mixture topping but the kids enjoyed and my husband did like the fish itself.  I was not thrilled overall with this recipe.  Not sure if I would make again.

This recipe is awesome! Actually, my version barely resembles the original. I use olive oil instead of mayo (DH doesn't like it), and italian seasoning and garlic salt instead of all of the other seasionings. I also used some lemon pepper. I don't measure, I jusr mash the ingredients together until they look, feel, and smell right. My DH hates fish, but asks for this all the time!

This was good but could use a little more seasoning. I did not have any dried basil so I used an Italian seasonings mix. I also did not use the celery salt but did everything else exactly. I liked the parmesan/mayo topping but will add more seasonings next time.

Didn't have regular mayo, so I used soy.  Fantastic flavor and tenderness.  Halfed the amount of topping and covered 3 tilapia fillets generously.  Might omit the butter next time--greased the pan generously with olive oil and then didn't need quite as much grease in the topping.  But still, wonderful flavor very fast.  I'd make this for guests.

Very easy to make.  Lots of flavor and very moist & tender.  I made this last week and my husband loved it! This is the best Tilapia recipe I've ever had!  I also added capers on top before it was done and this added a nice touch and flavor.  Thanks for a truly wonderful recipe!

The time on this recipe is certainly true!  I had dinner prepped and on the table in 20 minutes flat - that included some last minute thawing of my Tilapia!  Will definitely be keeping this one!

I had never heard of this fish before but I saw it at Costco and decided to give it a try. I actually tried two recipes last night and this one was definitely the winner. It's delicious! The other recipe was "healthier" but my three boys loved the parmesan cheese flavor (it's worth the extra calories every once in a while). It was flavorful, moist, and the presentation is impressive (the top turns golden brown).

I made this last night for dinner and my family loved it.  We have been looking for a way to add more fish to our diet and this recipe will help.  :)

I made this tonight and it was delicious! My husband loved it and so did I. I didn't have any basil so I used thyme, and I don't care for celery salt so I used garlic salt. The flavor is amazing. I will make this over and over and over again!

Everytime I cook fish my family will never eat it they all say they don't like fish.  When I made this recipie everyone wanted seconds and even thirds.  I was shocked I had to get up in the middle of dinner and prepare more, luckily the recipie is extreemly easy to make. Thanks Pheobe for this recipie it's awsome. Tay

This was sooooooooooo yummy and easy to make. I made it for my husband last night and he loved it, as did I.  I got the tilapia from Sam's Club/Costco so it's always on hand.

This is a marvellous recipe! so quick and easy, and SOOO creamy and cheesy, with a hint of spice & sour.  Perfect for those that don't particularly like fish.  Has taken some time for my 6 year old to warm up to it though.

This is absolutely the BEST and EASIEST recipe for fish!  We have made this over and over and it always comes out great!  Have used other fish with this recipe but tilapia is our favorite!  The only change I have made is to use a little salt instead of celery salt, simply because I did'nt have any and it tastes so good I didn't need to go buy some.  By far, this is the best recipe I have gotten from this website!

Quick and delicious.  Pairs well with Orzo with Parmesan and Basil by Dodie Pajer, as suggested by Junior.

I was out of onion powder, but the sauce was still very good. It definitely gives an extra something to the somewhat bland tilapia. We had this with rice but I feel that something was missing. Will try this next time with the Orzo recipe mentioned in another review here.

This was terrific! I was starting to prepare tilapia with just the Old Bay seasoning and checked to see how long to broil it, found this recipe, and made it! Absolutely fabulous, I used fat free parmesan, light butter, and fat free mayo. I think you could reduce the butter a bit. I put it over a bed of rice, with a side of steamed broccoli and we had a healthy low-cal meal.

Man this was soooooooo good!  My husband and I enjoyed it so much. I made two changes: 1. I substituted half of the mayo with low fat sour cream & 2. I didn't have celery salt so I sprinkled in some celery seed instead.  Can't wait to make it for the kiddos, I know they will love it cause it tastes nothing like fish!  Don't be afraid to try it.

Superb recipe! I susbstitute light or fat-free sour cream for the mayonnaise (because of egg allergies). The broiling directions have given me light and flaky fish every time. 
Thanks Phoebe!

This is one of the best fish recipes I have ever tasted!  I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect.  It is perfect the way it is, but, next time I will use "Old Bay" seasoning instead of the pepper and herbs the recipe calls for, just to try it. Thanks for sharing!

The recipe was scrumptious followed word for word! Unfortunately, the fish I had purchased tasted a bit "fishy" so next time I will buy fresh instead of previously frozen.

This is a super simple and tasty recipe. My only suggestion is -- instead of flipping and re-flipping the fish, turn once, add the topping and rotate the fish once or twice thereafter. The cooking time should be about 6-7 minutes total.

We loved this! I also had the same issue with some of the topping sliding off, but this didn't matter, because enough stayed on to give it a wonderful flavor.  Fast and very easy to make.  Will definitely make this again.  Thanks!

I love, love, love, LOVE this recipe!!! I am not a huge fish eater (The only fish I like is a fish that doesn't taste "fishy", lol). This recipe is a definate A+! I have made it twice now and both times it turned out marvelous - and even my 8 year-old, picky, non-fish eater loved this. We have decided it would make a great 'company's coming' dish, and plan on making it the next time we have dinner guests!

The sauce on this was incredible!!! The only problem I had was that the tilapia came out soggy, but I'm not sure if it was the way I prepped it or not. I will try this with grouper and Mahi to see if it's better with a sturdier fish. SOO yummy, though!! Tastes like Fresh Catch Pontchartrain from Harry's restaurant!!

I used cajun spice instead of basil 
and celery salt. It tasted wonderful.
This recipe was so easy and quick to
prepare.Clean up was a breeze. I
defintely will be making this again
and again.

I am not a fish eater, but, I will definitely make this recipe again.....My family loved the flavor and I loved the simplicity and lack of the "fishy" taste. I served with rice pilaf and vegetables.....Thanks!!!!! :o)

As usual, I was out of an ingredient right when I decide to try it. I had no Mayo. Being I do this so often, I just tried to think of what would be a good substitute. I used 1TBS Miracle Whip (light) + 1 TBS Deans French Onion Dip(fatFree) + 1TBS Sour Cream(lowFat). My hubby, who always makes a face at new things, absolutely LOVED the fish! So did I! It didn't actually leave a crunchy coating on it. It was more like a delicious melted cheese of a new sorts!  Fantastic!  Will make it again and again. So quick! So GOOD!!

I am just learning to cook and as I don't eat any meat beside fish I am really having a difficult time finding recipes that the whole family likes ( they are all carnivores).  This was a great meal, my husband thought it was flavorful (thats a big deal, he thinks everything is bland) and my girls, 41/2, 3 and 9 months loved it.  I thought it was really tasty too.  Thanks

This recipe is AMAZING!! I had a suprise visitor for dinner, and had taken some Tilapia out of the freezer earlier today. I had not a clue what I was going to do with it. I started cooking at 5:00 and we were eating by 5;20!! The flavor was to die for, and my whole family made me swear to make it again and again! Thanks so much Caroline C for sharing this awesome recipe!

This was good, but not as good as I expected.  I have never made tilapia before, and this recipe was quite easy.  The fish was somewhat moist when I placed the topping on, and it just slid right off.  Next time, I will dry the fillets off before putting on the topping--maybe that will help.

I definitely do not like fish, but Tilapia was recommended several times as it doesn't taste fishy, and it really doesn't. The recipe for the Tilapia is EXECELLENT!!! I wouldn't change a thing! If you're not a fish-eater, definitely try this recipe!

This was by far the best fish I have ever had. I bought the fish in separate packages and didn't realize I had enough. At least there was no leftovers. Definately will make again but with more fish.

This tasted amazing! My entire family ate it. My 16 year old son gave me a big hug and then griped because I'd only fixed him one fillet. Next time, I'll be making two for several of us! Mmm!

This isn't my favorite, but not bad either.  Not sure if I will make again.  My favorite part was the edges that got really crisp from broiling.

Great!  In Alaska we use halibut instead of tilapia.  You need to cut halibut thinner to make the fish match.  Used low fat mayo and processed cheese (sorry) but it still turned out great.  Thanks for the recipe.

Best fish recipe I have used from here.  I changed a few things due to not having some stuff.  I didnt have enough parm, so I used 2 T parm and 1/4 c shredded colby.  Also, I added 1 T honey and 1/4 tsp old bay.  Will share with all "cooks" I know.

I loved this recipe, very tasty and easy to make. I actually was looking for a recipe to  use on the grill and saw this. It sounded good so I grilled the fish and then before serving put on the coating and put under the broiler for a few minutes. Came out great! Will definitely make again. I didn't have celery salt but was fine without it. Thanks!

WOW!  This was GREAT!  I really had my doubts but it really turned out yummy.  Plus it was super quick to fix.  My husband doesn't like fish and loved this, and my picky two year old devoured it!  I will use this again and again.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Pretty good, but the mayo base makes it a little too heavy for my tastes.  Next time I will try working around that.

Excellent and easy. Even my kids loved it, lapped it up, and asked for more. I used just 3 T of butter and could probably have gotten away with less. I also used the low-fat mayo. Still delicious!

This recipe is definitely easy and fast, and looks like it was more effort than it really is.  The topping was a little too tangy for my taste, but it did go very well with the Basic Microwave Risotto from this site.

This is an awesome recipe.  It's full of flavor!  I cut fat by using light ingredients and a little less butter.  My husband was very impressed with this fish (and he is not a fish fan).

Excellent!  It was a little tricky getting the sauce to stay on the hot fish, but it tastes great and I'll definitely make it again.  I love the flavor of the celery salt and lemon in this dish.  I may even try this sauce on some pounded chicken breasts.

This was delicious!  I made it just like the recipe was written.  It was really easy too.  I also served it ontop of mashed sweet potatoes and the pan seared asparagus and it tasted like something I ate at Bahama Breezes!  I will make this again!

This was so easy and delicious. My 4 and 6 yeard old ate it all up and asked for more.. YUMMY I served it with Lemon Horseradish potatoes (on this site) and Broccoli. It was a big hit- thanks for the recipe...

First time I ever made tilapia.  Easy, excellent recipe.  I only used 2 filets so I decreased the amount of the sauce and still had extra.  Even my 3 and 6 year old loved it!  Will make again - thanks!

This was very easy to make.  I had never broiled fish before and was a little nervous, but it was great!  I will make this often.

This is probably the BEST recipe I have ever used for any fish.  It was perfect for a dinner party, taking little time away from my guests and ready so fast.  Even kids like this.

This was very good except I used shredded parmesan instead of grated.  Will try grated next time.  I was expecting more of a crunchy crust, so maybe the grated parm will make the difference.  Either way, it tastes delicious.

Great and easy recipe for those of us who are not so smooth in the kitchen!  My husband found this recipe very delicious and requested it again.  The flavors of the sauce definately covered a multitude of my fish broiling errors. Definately a great recipe for first time fish cookers. :-)

This recipe was excellent and very easy!  Had broad appeal to kids and adults and was interesting enough to be served to company.  I, too, added garlic and cut out the celery salt, substituting onion salt for the onion powder.

Absolutely delicious.  We didn't use celery salt or onion powder either, but used some garlic salt instead, since that is what we had on hand.  We will be making this many many more times.  Thanks Phoebe!

This recipe was so good it was CRAZY!  i had a small dinner party with some friends over and the room was completely quiet for about 20 minutes while we all devoured the fish.  I modified it a little with fresh garlic and some Old Bay seasoning on the fish itself, but other than that the recipe was awesome itself.

The most awesome fish dish I have ever eaten!  Better than any fish I have had in a restraunt.  I did not put in the celery salt or onion powder, and instead used a couple dashes of onion salt...it tasted AWESOME!

I also added a clove of minced garlic and used fresh basil leaves I chopped up in the food processor -- was just delicious!  I also broiled the fish on in a jellyroll pan lined with foil and spread a thin layer of olive oil onto the foil -- the flavor was great  - will definatelly pass this one on - and make it again for my family!

I too have fish but decided to try this one, since I'd like to like fish better.  It did do a good job of masking the fishy flavor and the slightly burnt and crunchy top was nice.  It is also incredibly quick, which is a bit plus.  The texture was not my favorite, but that is the fish's fault, not the recipes.

This was alright.  The sauce has a nice flavor, and altogether this was a good dish, although it wasn't that interesting.  I think I'll make it again.

Let me start by saying - I DO NOT LIKE FISH!!  With that being said, this recipe was SUPERB. For any of you "fish haters" out there, this is the perfect recipe to help you get those "healthy" omega 3 fatty acids, and you will not have to suffer through it.  I am eating this recipe 2 or 3 times per week for health reasons, but the big bonus is that it tastes delicious. Serve it with some grilled asparagus (all from this site) and a side of sugar free jello with fruit in it, and you have an extremely healthy meal.  Thanks so much for the "only" fish recipe I have ever liked.

Wow! What a great dish!  I made it exactly like it said and it turned out great.  If you use unsalted butter (like I did), I recommend you add some salt to it.  Otherwise, it's perfect like it is.  I served it over Spinich Fettucini (the sauce is excellent!).

I'm not a fish lover, but this recipe is awsome.  Like other viewers, I substituted garlic powder for onion powder....I'm sure that made little or no difference because this is a tasty dish.  Don't be afraid to make this for company.  Thanks Phoebe...this recipe is an absolute winner.

This quick and easy dish is yummy!  I'm always looking for new ways to cook fish, and this will be a permanent addition to my collection.  I just love the taste of slightly browned parmesan.

I didnt have celery salt or onion powder but used paul Prudhomme red fish seasoning in place of it and used powered garlic. I use this recipe on salmon too and it is wonderful. I use a heavier coating of finely grated parmesan on salmn though.

This was a big hit with my husband and my 15 mo old.  I made a few minor modifications - less butter, less mayo, garlic salt instead of celery salt, and dried minced onions instead of onion powder.  I also topped each filet with a slice of tomato.  It was a little hard to spread the butter on the fish but I found if I let it sit on the warm fish for a minute, then it was easier to spread.

Very yummy, an absolute winner!  Great served on brown rice.

A very nice combination of ingredients to complement a pretty tasteless fish. I used onion JUICE instead of salt since there was quite a bit of sodium in the other ingredients and the flavor was much more subtle. I also used WHITE pepper to tone down so many heavy flavors (lemon juice, paremsan), plus our family does not like black pepper too well. I found that there was a bit too much of the sauce, or perhaps my fish were too thin. I will try cutting the recipe by an eighth next time, or perhaps making more fish. This recipe was so very good that everyone could have eaten more! Thanks!

I liked this recipe and will probably make it again, but I didn't love it.  I will give it an extra star because it's easy and because the leftover sauce makes a great and easy side dish tossed with hot rotini pasta.  I think we like it better on the pasta than on the fish!

This is one of my family's favorite recipes.  I didn't have the Celery Salt or Onion Powder, so I just put in a little garlic salt instead and it was wonderful.  Even my 3 year old daughter loves it.  And it is so easy!

Thanks for the great recipe!  I really enjoyed this.  I did take the suggestion of adding garlic powder to the sauce and also salt & peppered the fillets before broiling.

If I could give it more stars, I would.  This was so simple and very tasty.  I will definitely make this again.  I may add a bit more lemon juice next time.  I might even use fresh basil instead of dried.  It was awesome as is though!

Oh, my goodness...what an easy, phenomenal dish.  Even my picky husband said, "This one's a keeper."  My six year old and 2 year old boys gobbled it up and clamoured for more.  

I kept things the same, only added a few dashes of garlic powder, as we love that spice.  I also seasoned the filets with a dab of kosher salt and pepper before putting the Parmesan mixture on top.  Thanks so much for an easy, great recipe.

Loved this recipe. Plenty of flavor. Easy. Husband enjoyed it too. One suggestion: I don't see the need for the butter when mayo has plenty of fat so will leave out butter next time. Also I did increase lemon jc. Just my personal preferrence. Thanks for sharing -great recipe.

I often broil fish with mayonnaise, lemon juice and seasonings so thought I would like this however the recipe really wasn't to our taste.  I don't think the cheese is complementary to the tilapia.

I love this recipe!  I have made it several times now. It's very easy to make and doesn't take alot of time.  The only thing I changed was I didn't use the basil.  I don't measure the pepper, onion powder, or celery salt, I just keep adding a little until it tastes the way I want it.  I also add a little garlic salt.

I made this last night. It was AWESOME!!! I did add some garlic powder, salt and dry chipolte seasoning to give it even more flavor.  Used real (you know the $15 a lb stuff) parmesan for real strong flavor. Will definately make it again.

you know, I was very excited about this recipe, at first since tilapia is popular in our house, and second since my mother in law makes an appetizer with grilled bread and this very sauce. But, after I tried it, I thought it didn't have much flavor. I didn't scimp on the parmesean either, using the real stuff. Anyways, my advice to someone else would be to season the fish first with salt and pepper, and apply the sauce liberally. Will try again and maybe experiment a bit.

This was excellent!  I used reduced fat parmesan and mayo - paying homage to the calorie monster! Both my husband and I really enjoyed this meal.

This was surprisingly good.  Very easy and uses ingredients on hand.  Fish stays very moist.  My fiance loved it too.  I'll definately make this again.

This recipe is delicious!  My husband is the one who makes it and he raves about how easy it is. (and he doesn't cook much at all!)  It would be a wonderful dish to make for company and it doesn't take long to make or make a big mess in the kitchen.  It's very tender and flavorful.  We've had this recipe 3 times so far and will definately make it often.

I have made this many times and every time is as delicious as the previous.  I have started using a no cholesterol butter substitute and low fat mayonaise and it does not affect the flavor or consistency.  I also use celery seed instead of salt.  I love this and it is the only Tilapia recipe I make.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I think this is a great recipe for those of us who want to make easy fish recipes. The one child of mine who hates fish had 3 helpings.  The one who loves fish scraped off the topping.

Simple and very good.  I used haddock and it came out great.  The only modification for next time would be to cut the amount of butter in half.

I cut the amount of topping by nearly half, which was still delicious.  My don't-like-baked-fish husband and my hate-mayonnaise-and-sauces-in-general son LOVED this.  THANK YOU for making it easier to eat the heart-healthy fish we are supposed to be eating!

This is glorious! I use a little less of the butter and mayo simply because I don't think this recipe really needs it. The idea of Parmesan with fish may not sound so great, but it really is delicious. I have made this for dinner parties and the guests asked me for the recipe after the first few bites.

The combination of great flavor, ease, and speed make this a five-star recipe. I used garlic powder instead of onion powder and celery salt, and I added chives on top before serving. FYI: Tilapia is one of the safer fishes as far as mercury levels are concerned.

I am giving this 3 stars because I felt the flavor of the sauce did not come through the way I was hoping.  My family, who I served this to, would give the recipe 4-5 stars because they loved it.  It was very quick and easy.  But I felt the flavor was lacking some.

This was my first time making tilapia and this recipe is fantastic.  I was amazed how FAST and EASY this was.  I bet the topping would be good on scallops too.  I'm definately making this a regular!!

just made this this evening.....super recipe.  my 10yr old who only eats fish sticks loved it.  asked for seconds.  I did flip the fish only once and then put the sauce on but my fillets were quite thin, so take this into consideration.

I'd never even attempted to cook fish before so I was a bit nervous about trying this and followed the recipe exactly (very unlike me).  This was honestly as good or better than anything I've had in a restaurant.  Even my picky 7 year old daughter was asking me when I would make it again before she had even finished her dinner.  

My oven has two broil settings so I cooked it on the low broil setting which was perfect.

This was good, but I didn't like the texture of the topping. Next time I will use freshly grated parmesan cheese instead of canned.

Yum!  Unbelievably fast and delicious!  Great dish for a busy weeknight.  May cut down on the parm just a smidge next time just because of the richness, but it was so good (even with the healthy substitutions suggested by others!).

Very tasty!  I really enjoyed this dish and I am usually not a "fish fan".  The taste was very mild and not fishy at all.  I used light miracle whip, and reduced fat parm.  I also followed some suggestions and used Old Bay instead of the herbs.  A very quick main dish to make.  I will be making this again.

This is an awesome, easy recipe!  We used only 3 filets (1 pound)of tilapia , omitted the lemon juice (because we don't use the wegde usually given with seafood in restaurants), and used Old Bay instead of celery salt and garlic powder instead of onion powder.  For those health conscious nuts, we used light mayo and also just poured in some parkay no cal. no fat butter spray... can't tell the difference!  The tilapia tasted amazing!! We'll definitely be having this again and will serve it to friends and family.

Perfect recipe for such a mild and delicate fish. My fillets were very small, so I only needed to broil once for about 5 minutes with the topping. Used Old Bay in place of celery salt, and added some parsley. Very tasty!

This recipe is FANTASTIC!  I've never liked fish before, but this recipe was so easy and delicious.  I've passed it on to all my coworkers.  I would recommend making at least twice the parmesan topping though.  Thanks!

Very easy, very good, fast and simple.
This would also work well with Sea Scallops or other types of mild fish.

This was excellent! I am not a big fish eater but I loved the texture of the fish and it wasn't dry at all.  I loved the flavor of the topping.  I didn't have any basil so I used italian seasoning (basil, oregano, marjoram, granular garlic) and I used lime juice instead of lemon.

Easy and excellent.  I made twice as much of the mix, heated it, and poured it over the rice I was serving with the fish.

This came out so great!  I added a little crushed red chile pepper to the mix and it added a little kick.  Will definately make this again!

I love Tilapia and I am always looking for a good recipe.  I used light parmesan alfredo sauce instead of the mayo and it turned out great.

This recipe was incredibly easy, and oh so tasty.  It seemed like something that would have been served at a nice restaurant.  Using just two good-sized fillets, I halved the recipe (eyeballed quantities) and made it in the toaster oven.  It turned out perfect!  The fish was moist, and the topping had a wonderful flavor.  A definite keeper.

Absolutely wonderful, my boyfriend loved it.  I baked it all in a 350 degree oven for about 30-35 minutes (fish was frozen) and then stuck it under the broiler. Definitely will make again!

This is AWESOME!  I was very tempted to not try it because I hate mayonaise, was glad I did.  We loved it.  Only change I made was used Old Bay Seasoning because I didn't have celery salt.  YUMMY!!

I'd like to rate this a 6!!  My husband and I are wishing we had more.  This is better than anything I've ever ordered from a seafood restaurant.  I subbed garlic for celery salt and had to microwave b/c oven broke.  Outstanding.

WOW- my first time to try Tilapia. I only like mild fish & the butcher assured me it was the BEST!!! Boy, was he right. Wish I'd tried it sooner. This recipe is to die for! And low carb & low cal to boot. Can't get any better than that! Thanks so much for submitting the recipe, Phoebs!

One of the best tilapia recipes ever! I didn't have any mayo or onion salt on hand, so I used tartar sauce and garlic powder. Tasted GREAT! Even my 1.5 and 3 year olds ate it!! Thanks for this one!!

Very fast, easy, and delicious recipe, especially handy for low-carb dieters.  I thought the lightly sweet taste of the tilapia was still noticable and complemented by the sauce.  I loved it.

This was a hit with my family! My parents are on Atkins and this was a great low carb option for them! I did have to broil the fish longer after I added the topping to get it browned, but it came out great!

One of the things that appealled to me about this recipe is all the ingredients are staples in our house.  While I really liked this recipe, I can't say this is my favorite way to eat Tilapia.  It's definately good for a change.  I will be making this again.

OMG!  This was the best tasting fish I have ever had.  And it was so simple I couldn't believe it.  So light and flavorful.  I am making it again tonight.  I did broil the fish 2 to 3 more minutes than instructed and it was perfect.  A definate winner.  Thanks Phoebe!  Any more winners??!!

This fish turned out really good.  The only change I made was to bake it until done at a lower temperature with the seasonings, then add the parmesean mixture and broil until brown.  It turned out really flavorful and smelled great while baking.  I will be saving this recipe.  Thanks!

Very good, but needs a little boost of flavor - cilantro or lime would be a great complement

Excellent dish!  Tilapia is inexpensive and a great fish for people like me who don't LOVE fish.  The next day I spooned extra sauce (followed suggestions to make extra, glad I did) over french bread and broiled it...mmmmmmmyummy...

My (picky)family rated this an enthusiastic 4 star.  I liked but somehow thought there was going to be a "sauce",which there isn't if you broil until lightly browned (like recipe instructs); leaving a very tasty topping. I thought the parmesan was a little "heavy" flavor for delicate fish but, it was still very good. I think I would like a little better on chicken, like some reviewers have made.

This was my first time making tilapia.  My husband liked this recipe a lot.  I thought it was a bit salty, but good.  I did have to change it a little.  I didn't have enough parm chz, so I added a little shredded mexican chz to it.  Also, I used a fish herb blend for the seasoning.  I only used a couple of teaspoons of lemon juice because my husband doesn't like it.
A nice, different way to prepare fish!

WOW! Great flavor, easy to prepare, and my KIDS ate this recipe!  I was looking for a low-fat dish so I subbed low-fat mayo, moove-over butter and reduced fat parmesan.  I ended up with a very flavorful dish and no one knew the wiser.  I was able to cut almost half the fat grams in the original recipe by substituting.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was delicious!  My husband said it tastes like something you would order at a fine restaurant.  It also looks great and is a very company suitable dish.  I used Alaskan pollock instead of tilapia.  Also, instead of butter I used 2 Tablespoons of olive oil.  Easy and quick dish!

This is not only delicious, but it is so easy and fast.  I just looked it up, printed it out, went out and turned on the broiler and within 10 minutes I had my meal.  I added some green beans and some applesauce and voila!  A delicious dinner.  I love it!!!!!!

Great way to cook tilapia!  My husband was very impressed!  I usually find tilapia too mild for my taste so this really kicked it up a notch for me.  I did add Old Bay seasoning to the cream mixture as well as changed the celery salt to garlic.  Very tasty.

I've only made this twice so far, but wow! I skip the celery salt (used garlic salt instead) and use Key Lime lemon juice to add a little "kick". Tastes good with a little Old Bay Seasoning too. Thanks!

Awesome! Like some other reviewers, I used 1 lb fish and same amt of sauce. Quick and super easy clean up if you use foil to line pan. I like more lemon taste so next time I may squeeze lemon directly on fish before cooking instead of in parmesan mixture.

TASTY! We simply loved this recipe. It's easy to fix and tastes wonderful! Didn't change a thing. Made exactly as listed. There were no leftovers! Since Tilapia fillets tend to be very thin (like pancakes), we each had two and that worked out just right! I was pleasantly surprised at the flavor! Just wonderful! I did use a little extra cheese (We love cheese)!!!

My 2 year old and husband loved this one, and he is not a seafood person. I thought it was ok, I prefer my fish with lemon only.  Very easy to make. Used 1 pound bag of frozen fish for same amount of sauce. Did not use salt, thought the parmesan already had enough of it. Also cut down on the butter. Will do it again.

Goodness!! I don't think I've ever made fish that was so fast, easy and good!! DH and I are doing the South Beach way of life and thought this recipe sounded appetizing, but it was even better than we'd hoped. We will make this again and again (and we've both agreed that this is "special" enough for company!)!!
I wouldn't change a single thing!

I have made this recipe many time for guests and it's always a hit! If I'm making two pounds of tilapia then I double the amount of sauce...it's so delicious and can be used as a topping on wild rice and veggies.

Outstanding recipe. Easy, fast and so good.  I served it on Mother's Day to a crowd of excellent cooks and everyone "loved it". Thanks for the recipe!!  Great for low carb meals

We loved this recipe.  Very easy to make, and incredibly tasty.  I read the reviews and based on some of them, made more of the sauce, which we ate on the side with the fish, and mixed in with our rice...yum!  Not a kid friendly dish, but hey, in my house, not much is.

This topping is excellent on grilled chicken. I used low fat mayonnaise and it was still very rich and delicious.

Great! I used a little less fish than called for and made the mayo sauce according to the recipe. Would have liked a little more, some of the filets had less cheese on them than I liked. Definately will make this one again.

Great recipe!  Didn't have celery salt so substitued garlic powder. Only broiled 1 pound of tilapia so put extra sauce in rice. Yum! Used the new ready rice in a pouch..cooks in the microwave in 60-90 seconds...Uncle Ben makes it and Zatarain. Easy fish, easier rice and salad out of a bag made a delicious Sunday dinner.

I've only made this recipe once, but it was very good.  As one reviewer recommnded, I did halve the fish, creating lots of extra sauce which was wonderful over rice!A definite addition to my fish roation!

This was the best fish I have ever cooked, and I have made a lot of fish!  Hubby who normally doesn't care for fish raved about this recipe.  My only complaint is that much of the tasty topping ran off the fish.  I may try to thicken the topping somehow next time...

Mmmm!!  Very flavorful & easy way to prepare fish. I do substitute plain yogurt for the mayo, & use light butter though...much healthier (and I am not a mayo person!).  Recipe is easily halved, too.  Also works with well Locatelli cheese & the reduced-fat parmesan cheese.

My boyfriend and I are really not fish eaters, but have been trying to find a good fish to incorporate into our meals.  We both agree, the coating was very good and helps drown out that fishy taste.  I however, was not crazy about the Tilapia.  I will continue to use the coating, but experiment with different types of fish.

The sauce on the fish was delightful.  It was really cheesy which was great.  I would recommend making a little bit more sauce than recommended, though.

EXCELLENT!  I just loved this recipe...and it is so easy and quick.  My kids don't usually like baked or broiled fish, but they even couldn't resist this one!  They were upset when there wasn't any more to eat.  We just loved the cheese coating.  I'm going to try it on some other types of fish too.

I liked it a lot!  I used minced garlic instead of celery salt and onion powder.  My husband thought the sauce was a little strong but I hope used 4 filets...so, it might have been a little strong for that amount.  But, I thought it was very tasty!

This turned out great! It was my first time making tilapia and I can't wait to make it again. Not only was it fast, it was easy. Minus setting off the smoke alarm due to the broiler (no big deal, it happens every time I broil anything), this is well worth making. This is one of my favorite fish recipes.

While I'm not a big fish fan, I found this very tasty.  My husband loved it and thought it was a great way to fix probably any fish.  The fish was flaky and tender and the topping was crusty and good.  Very easy to fix too!

Yummy, yummy.  What a nice change than the typical pan-fried tilapia.  My picky husband even likes this one.

Even my 2 yr old and 4 yr old ate this one.  I must admit I was thinking "what am a feeding to my family?" as I glopped the white stuff on the white fish.  But, somehow the strange combination does work.  The fish was not the least bit "fishy."  I also put the spices on top instead of combining it with the mayo mixture (only because I have problems following directions!).  It turned out fine.    I would definately make this again!  We even used light mayo and the Brummel and Brown yogurt spread and it was still good.   Enjoy!

This was very easy to make, but a bit too cheesy for our taste.  My husband ate it all and so did my 2 year old son.  He said he would not mind eating it again.  But I wont make it again, will have to search for a new fish recipe.  Plus I am not a big tilapia fan, too strong of a fish taste for me.

I just made this for myself & my son for lunch & oh my goodness, it was soooo good. I didnt have parmesan cheese though so made it w/ out & I never measure ingredients, just eye them. I cant give this recipe as many stars as it deserves. I am wondering how it would taste on chicken or steak.

Absolutely wonderful.  We never change the recipe, it is just perfect the way it is - my opinion of course.  A wonderful blend of flavors...tilapia is hard to find around here but when we find it - this is the only way we will cook it!!

As suggested by other reviewers, I doubled the sauce.  I melted the butter since it melts on contact with the hot fish anyhow; however, next time I will reduce the amount of butter.   I also had to make a few substitutions:  instead of onion powder and celery salt, I used onion salt and crushed celery seed.  Delicious!  My family doesn't like seafood, but my husband ate this recipe, and my kids really raved about it!

I've made this recipe twice now for my husband and I who are NOT big fish eaters and it is EXCELLENT. Both easy to prepare and tasty too. I added a little bit more lemon juice and substituted some herbes de provence for the herbs here. I also garnished with some lemon zest. I used cermaic ramekins for broiling to keep the broiler clean and ease in serving. Thanks!

My husband and I loved this! All that parmesan is a little bad for you, though, so I used the lower fat version.

Great recipe.  It's everything I look for in a recipe: tasty, fast, easy, cheap.  I've heard that combining cheese and seafood is usually a "no-no", but this recipe marries the two to great effect.  If you try it once, I bet your family will demand that you make it again.  Even my fussy 5 year old loves this dish.  It so easy to make that you won't mind adding it to your usual repertoire.  In short: this recipe is a KEEPER!

Very tasty, very easy to make with items commonly on hand. My broiler isn't quite as strong as the one the recipe writer used, I let it stay in a minute longer at least per side and it wasn't dried out or overdone at all.

I have never cooked this fish before and it was so easy!  If you have leftovers, I recomend heating it in the oven under the broiler, otherwise the mayonnaise can get a little rubbery. Definitely a keeper!

This is a five stars recipe. My husband used to only want tilapia deep fried (yuck!) but now he loves the way it is made on this recipe... I have made it many times and just did it again last night and it was a hit for my visitors. The only change that I did was put some salt and pepper on before broil it... everything else is just perfect. Very juicy not fishy at all. Love it!

This was fantastic!  I broiled the fish with some lemon and butter and pepper to start.  I also substituted regular mayo for miracle whip.  My husband loved it.  I will make this again.

My husband and I love this! It's easy to make and the topping mixes wonderfully with that light tilapia taste.

Tasted great and was very easy... will definitely make this again.  The only thing I had trouble with was getting the cheesy coating "spread" onto the fish.  I ended up kind of spooning it on in globs, so it wasn't as pretty as maybe it should have been.  Also, if your tilapia fillets are thin, you should forgo trying to brown the topping... just broil until the cheese melts.
