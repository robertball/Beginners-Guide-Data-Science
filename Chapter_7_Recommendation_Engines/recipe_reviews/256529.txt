1.15.17   When I roast vegetables, I always cook at a temperature higher than 350ºF.  What happened is that the chicken thighs cooked before the carrots.  What I ended up with was overcooked chicken and undercooked carrots (and I do love roasted carrots!).   What I would do in the future is cook the carrots at 400ºF for about ten minutes, then add the chicken thighs and the potatoes (which cooked fine at 350 in the recipe's timeframe).  The one thing that I forgot to add was the Roma tomato, but I think next time, I’d just use sun dried tomatoes anyway for additional flavor.  I stuffed the chicken breasts early in the day, wrapped in plastic wrap, and put in the fridge until dinner.  Enjoyed, but I will approach this differently in the future.  Robin5791 thanks for sharing.

I made it a second time because my companion -- who really doesn't like chicken -- really liked it.  It's too rich for me, so I made enough for him for several meals and I eat plain chicken thighs Now we're both happy!

Usually "stuffed" means complicated and long prep.  On the contrary, this recipe was easy and quick. I substituted a bag of frozen veggies and used grated cheddar cheese because I did not have mozzarella.   Good weeknight dinner for a busy family!

This was tasty, but I cooked the chicken too long & it got dry. I also cooked the vegetables separately from the meat as my daughter is a vegetarian, so I’m not sure if that was part of the problem. Additionally, we substituted the chicken thighs with chicken breasts for larger portions, so without the dark meat, that probably dried it out a little too. Next time, we will cover the meat with foil & put the temperature back at 350 degrees & not 375 degrees as others had suggested.

Made this dish today exactly as listed. Delicious!  The carrots weren’t as soft as I’d like, so they took a little longer getting done. Next time I’ll slice them in half lengthwise.

This recipe was delicious. It would have been even better with a little less cooking time. I cooked it for about 40 minutes and it was a kinda dry. Also, I am not a fan of  thigh meat. {it's something about the flavor) Next time I will try breast and shave a couple of minutes off the the cooking time.

I made it..Yea!!! My wife loved it. I'm not sure what I thought about it. The Carrots & Potatoes were a little hard, but the chicken and stuffing came out perfect. (Btw.. I'm not a real cook. This was my first)

This recipe is good but not great. It is a lot of work for a regular tasting dinner.  No real stand out taste in the stuffing but the one pan dinner concept is good for a working mom.

Loved this! I cut the recipe in half, because there is just two of us.  My husband ate 2 rolls  instead of his usual one piece of meat.  This could be a company dish!

For the Indian palate, a slightly spicier version could be prepared. I added some green chilli and garlic paste to the filling and drizzled any type of a hot sauce (I used a combination of Nando’s peri peri  and sriracha sauces in 2:1 ratio, with a little brown sugar mixed in ) over the dish before baking it.

Very yummy dish that all of my family enjoyed.  I substituted artichoke hearts for the olives for something a little different.  Next time I will use the olives.

Due to dietary reasons, I omitted tomatoes and onions.  I also only had chicken breast on hand.  My family loved this!  Even my picky husband said this was one to make again!

My family didn't love the filling, but I think removing the onions would fix that. I've I think it was good and will be great without the onion (or maybe sauteing the onio s first)
