Dust veal with flour, season with salt and pepper.  Sauté for just a couple  of minutes on each side, not eight  minutes!  Veal cooks quickly - do NOT overcook, the most important criteria, in my opinion, for Veal  Marsala, or any veal dish for that matter.  Set veal aside on a platter and keep warm.  Add a little more butter and olive oil to pan and sauté mushrooms, some shallots if you like, and minced garlic for 4-5 minutes, not ten!  Add  about a cup each of chicken broth and  REAL Marsala (NEVER cooking wine as directed, and certainly no water!) and cook until it is reduced  by about two-thirds.  Swirl in a dab of butter at the end, off heat, for a velvety rich, luxurious, glossy sauce.  Return the veal to the pan just for a minute or so to ensure everything is  heated through.  An easy to make and impressive, classic dish, but as written this recipe needs some work.   A dish is only as good as the ingredients you use and if it is cooked properly.

This is a keeper, you can fix this in 30 minutes.  Very easy to adjust to tastes,  nice and simple.  Low in fat and sodium, average protein intake just by itself.  And the vitamin D.

super simple recipe and it tasted good too.. i was looking for something simple for bf to make and found this.. i've never heard of the brand Holland House.. but i had Pompeian cooking wine and this came out much better than i expected.. used a portobello mushroom and chopped it up.. didn't want to bother with the dredging so we cut the chicken into chunks and salt and peppered before adding to the pan.. made sure to heat the cooking wine until the raw alcohol taste was gone.. used cilantro for parsley.. didn't add the water.. served over linguini and topped with some shredded parm.. ty for the easy recipe

Yum! Chicken pounded out thin should be no more than 2 min on each side. Loved the mushrooms.

I used this as a base recipe for my own version. I baked the chicken in the oven for 30 minutes and broiled on middle rack for 10 more minutes. I coated the chicken with olive oil and sea salt before baking. I used some chicken thighs and some boneless breasts.  I think the thighs are tastier.   For the sauce I used chicken broth and Marsala Wine.  I kept tasting it, because initially I used mostly Wine which is way too strong a taste.  I kept adding chicken broth till the wine taste became flavorful instead of overpowering. I would say the ratio was at least 60-70% broth to 40-30% wine. I also included butter, parsley, Rosemary, and sliced mushrooms. I thickened the mixture with cornstarch because we have gluten sensitive people in the family.  I know this is an in-exact recipe, but the sauce did come out good and I would make it again.

It was very good! The only change I made... I thickened the sauce a little with cornstarch. My husband and I loved it! For my little boys... Not so much. But they are little and like things simple, so they just ate the chicken by itself. Great recipe!

This Veal Marsala recipe was good. It was very quick to prepare, and the flavors came together nicely. I added some chopped red pepper to mine along with the mushrooms which made it look like a gourmet meal. Thank you Holland House® for sharing your recipe.

Made this for the first time last night. My husband loved it. His only complaint was that he wanted more mushrooms and sauce. He said that next time I should triple the sauce. The only change I made was to add corn starch for thickening the sauce.

I added salt pepper and garlic powder to the cutlets before flouring. I prefer to sauté the mushrooms after I’ve sauté the cutlets in butter and olive oil it gives the mushrooms/wine sauce a better flavor
