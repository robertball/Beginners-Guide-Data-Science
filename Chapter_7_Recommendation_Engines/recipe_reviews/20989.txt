These are so good!! Anyone who says these aren't like the fair has either went to a really weird fair or they messed up the recipe. I have made these several times and they always turn out perfect. And people PLEASE stop rating recipes you've never tried.

This was not quite like what you get at the fair.  All morning I played around with the recipe after semi-success on the first batch. For the best batch I did the following differently. I added about 3 Tbsp. of water to the dough to keep it from being tough.  The oil was extremely too hot and so I lowered it to about 275 and cooked it for a little less than a minute per side(this was with the dough rolled to about 1/8 in thick).  After frying it I brushed it with melted butter which enhanced the bread's flavor and helped the sugar to stick.  I also doubled the amount of sugar used for the toping.

This is it!!!!  I grew up in Indiana and at the state fair we ALWAYS had an elephant ear.  Only difference may have that they lightly brushed them with melted butter before dousing them with cinnamon sugar.  But surprisingly they taste fine without it and the sugar adheres well.  Plus it's much better for us without the added butter.  These fry up nicely with bubbles in the dough and everything.  I'd decrease the amount of oil used for frying (I did mine in the iron skillet) since it gets a little splattery.  Also, my frying time was about 10-15 seconds per side.  So delicious!

Great recipe! My Swiss father-in-law taught us a similar recipe his family used in Switzerland. Here, before Christmas, we would assemble grand kids in the kitchen. Set up the ironing board covered with several layers of paper towels, line three or four laundry baskets with paper towels, secure several long-handled wooden spoons, start a large pot of oil heating - Then mix this recipe. The children would gather around the kitchen table, each receiving a ball of dough about the size of a small fist, and pull, with their hands, the "Eiroili" until thin. there was a competition to get the dough as thin as possible without pulling a hole. They would playfully argue which one would look most like an elephant's ear when it came out of the pot. Opa would then push and hold each "cookie" into the pot of oil with a wooden spoon, leaving it   until bubbled and crispy. (Not long!) He would then put each cookie to drain on paper towels on the ironing board, the children sprinkling it with the mixture of sugar and cinnamon. It then went, carefully stacked, into the lined laundry baskets awaiting delivery to friends. What fun! Mmmm, good. Of course, we have repeated this ritual with a new generation. CLeeman

Simply wonderful!  When I was melting the shortening/milk/sugar mix I thought this was a huge mistake, but it really turned out perfect in the end.  I ended up with ~12 6" rounds and only made half the recipe.  The only thing I did differently was adjust the topping to the way I like (much more sugar, much less cinnamon).  BTW, 3/8c = 6 tablespoons.

This recipe was really good, especially freshly made:)I made it for my kids at the preschool I work for and my husbands hot rod shop. It was hot both places:)
The only heads up I give is the cinnamon sugar topping is way way off...in my opinion anyway so you may want to tweak with that(the cinnamon side of the ratio was too high!)
Thanks

I had a taste for these but didn't want to eat the whole batch so I took them into work and what a hit they were. And so easy to make. I made some with cinnamon-sugar and some with powdered sugar. Thanks!

If these are the same elephant ears that are served at fairs, then I am in love!  I buy at least 5-6 at each fair, so now I want to learn how to make them my self.  Thank you Amber

i guess i was disappointed in the end result. in canada we have something similar to elephant ears called beaver tails, more of a fried donut consistency, so i guess i was expecting it to be like that -  
will not be making this again.

Wow! This dough was divine! My advise - mix all the wet ingredients and start adding flour slowly. Keep adding only until your dough is no longer sticking to your fingers but is still very soft. You may use more or less flour than provided in the recipe. This way you get a beautiful fluffy and soft end product. Flours vary in their gluten levels, etc. so following the recipe exactly might not give you the best result. This dough would be wonderful for sopapillas, doughnuts, dumplings, paczkis, etc. Definitely a keeper!

loved them! i was craving elephant ears like you wouldnt believe. it was good to find this recipe. at first i rolled out the ears really really thin because it said to do it thin. these were good, but crape like. i tried rolling them out to different thicknesses and found i liked them best at maybe a little less then 1/4 inch. this made them puff up a bit more. liked it both ways.

I love this recipe. I usually use water instead of milk, oil instead of shortning and half whole wheat half unbleached white. I make a double batch the first half we cook on dry fry pans no oil and we call it flat bread we fill it, use like sandwiches or dip it in the gravey, sauces, or whatever we are eating. Then the other half is for desert after dinner. topped with jam, honey, cinnamon/sugar, syrup, delicious. and everyone thinks I did lots of work.

Every year we have a fair here in town, and every year I say "We have got to get some elephant ears this year!" but somehow it never happens. I tried this recipe tonight and they are delicious... 

OK... keep trying to leave the kitchen, keep trying to leave the kitchen... walking away, coming back...

Impossible to leave these alone! I wish I could substitute the shortening for oil, but the amount of shortening in this recipe is very minimal, and they sure are good!!!

THUMBS UP!!!

These were good but too much cinnamon in the topping, either cut the cinnamon in half or double the sugar. Also, they taste much better if you brush with melted butter before adding the topping. With the above changes I would rate five stars.

Taste just like the one's at the circus! Too good. Don't roll to thin, you'll get a cracker. I dusted with powdered sugar. Definitely a keeper.

I have used this recipe quite a few times now and it never fails me. Though I must say it's quite a big batch, I always forget to half it and it takes me a while to use all of the dough up. I also never use cinnamon, but either way it's great. Tasty!

Oh my, this is nearly the same as my favorite elephant ears that I love to get every year at the Fair. So super easy to make! I didn't have shortening, so used butter (1:1 ratio). I decreased the serving size to 5 servings (I didn't need to make 15 ears, as I'm just making for me and my husband), which gave me easy numbers to work with. For the cinnamon/sugar mix I increased the sugar by 1 TB. When frying, it's important that you don't have the oil too high, nor too low and to keep a constant eye on the ear. It fries up quick! Spread with butter, sprinkle with the cinnamon/sugar and enjoy!!! =)

I almost gave up because I took momtomany's advise on my 1st batch and added 3 TBS water to the dough- it make them doughnut like- mot like fair elephant ears at all. So then I tried one more time -while I still had the oil warm  in the cast iron skillet. This time I cut the recipe down and made them EXACTLY like the recipe said and they were pretty darn close to what you can get at the fair. I spread a bit of butter on them before the cinnamon and sugar like they always did at the Indiana state fairs. I recommend following the recipe EXACTLY to get that bit of chewiness that fair elephant ears. I may try buttermilk though at a future date to see how that goes.

This recipe makes A LOT of elephant ears (if you don not make them terribly large), so I used only half of the recipe . This recipe is fairly authentic; here are the changes that I made:  I used buttermilk and I omitted the cinnamon (I'm from Fort Wayne, IN and I have never seen them offered with cinnamon). I topped them off with  strawberries (soaked in sugar) or nutella. They are delicious and very filling. Great base recipe.

BIG SELLER!!!!  I do food at our 4H Horse shows about twice a month and sold these at one and they were a big hit and I sold out of them.  Made a double batch and enjoyed them a lot!!  I continue to make them at home and at more horse shows and they are always loved.

YUM! We made these after coming home from the fair, and the only difference was that these are with white flour and the true fair elephant ears are with whole wheat. Definitely delish. We brushed ours with butter before dusting them with cinny and sug.

Made these with 2 cups whole wheat flour and 2 cups of white, and they turned out great. The kids had fun making them.

Mine didn't come out crispy, but these were still fantastic! I only made a half batch to test the recipe, and I can honestly say I will always make a full batch (or two!) next time. I made a video as I attempted the recipe, giving full credit of course: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0AgWlSyqWw&feature=youtu.be

I used this dough recipe to make Utah scones- which are basically fried dough.  It turned out great!  I just rolled out the dough and then cut it into squares, let it rise slightly and then fried it in oil.  I made creamed butter and honey to put on top.  It was great.  Also, I used about 50% whole wheat flour which was also very tasty in the recipe.

Most all the recipes here for Elephant Ears are much the same...this one is pretty good. When I make mine, I start with a favorite cinnamon roll recipe. After cutting the rolls, I roll them out on a sugared counter top into 1/2 flat dough and then put them on oiled baking sheet and bake for 8-10 on one side and flip and bake another 8-10 minutes(add a bit of oil if needed to pan) or until golden brown.  THESE are just like you get at the fairs.

Tasted just like the elephant ears you get at the carnival.  Really delicious.  I followed the directions exactly and they turned out great!  The yeast never really foamed but they still turned out fine.

These were good.  But I really found nothing "special" about them.  They tasted like any other fried yeast dough...  I will keep looking for something else.

We used to make these when I was a kid and we called them German Scones.  We cut them in to triangles and coat them in powdered sugar.  They melt in you mouth.  :)

These were fantastic!! Just like at the summer festivals. I covered mine with icing sugar. I had to use 2 cups white flour and 2 cups whole wheat flour and they still tasted great. I'm from Canada and I haven't a clue what beaver tails are but this recipe is just like the elephant ears I get from the fairs.

I give this recipe 5 stars because it is agreat base recipe. The only thing I changed was to half the recipe and make the dough a bit sweeter by adding another teaspoon of sugar. The given ratio for the cinnamon sugar topping was off as well.(it should be about 1:3 instead 1:2.
The people who gave a low rating due to wrong texture, I suspect aren't used to working with yeast. Be sure to cool liquid mixture to baby bottle warm, otherwise YOU WILL KILL THE YEAST and dough won't rise. Also, allow dough to sit in a warm place to rise.
Brushing with butter before dusting with cinnamon sugar enhances flavor but isn't necessay.

Simply heavenly.  I haven't had one of these since I  was a little girl at the fair.  I also have not seen anyone making elephant ears in our area fairs, I see more funnel cakes than anything.  So, I tried this recipe out in the hopes that it would taste like the fair...it tasted better!

This was fantastic. Make sure you roll them nice and thin though, because the dough is kind of elastic and will "scrunch" up a bit. We ended up with elephant biscuits, which were still tasty. Not the recipe's fault, of course, but just a word of warning for people who sometimes cut corners!

I recently had a hankerin' for some fair food, I grew up in a small town that had the state fair every summer with all the delicious food vendors of all sorts...so I made this recipe exact only I cut it in half. I didn't have a rolling pin so it was tough trying to get the dough thin enough because it tends to thicken up a lot in the oil if you don't spread it out enough. Well, I was still very pleased, and the picky boyfriend loved it too. Obviously, this will be a rare delicacy but at least I can tell people I know how to make elephant ears! P.S. DO brush the elephant ear with melted butter as soon as possible after patting off the excess grease...THAT'S where a lot of the flavor was, besides the sugar and cinnamon:)

These were good, but not great!  They puff up too much so they don't evenly brown.  They aren't the same as what you get at fairs.  We found the cinnamon to sugar ratio off as well.  Way too much cinnamon and not enough sugar.  The dough itself needs to be sweeter as well.

We loved these.  They really tasted like the fair elephant ears we are used to.  Just make sure you roll out your dough very thin.

These were okay.  I definitely prefer the ones at the fair...and I personally don't really think these come close enough to that to make me want to make them again.  These were a little more dense and slightly less sweet than what my family is used to.  Thanks anyway for the idea.

I have been making this for my kids for about 5 years now and they LOVE it. They taste just like the carnivals. If your willing to to put the time and patience into the dough they will turn out perfect. make sure they are not to thick or to thin and the edges are a little thicker when rolling out your elephant ear and always be careful when placing in the oil they expand and puff up rather quickly.

I ended up heating the milk, sugar and salt in the microwave until it was warm, then adding melted butter instead of shortening.  I also found that I prefer them rolled a little thicker, but they turned out perfect.  My family thought they were better than the fair.

The first time i made these we scaled the recipe back to only make three....big mistake.Why one may ask? WE ALL WANTED MORE!!! Just like any fair or carnival if not better. Why anyone would ever spend 5 or 6 dollars again for just one, I don't know. Awesome!

Amazing! I made a half batch last night, just in case I screw up, but everyone was mad I didn't make more....absolutely delish! I did not put melted butter as others suggested, I did decrease cinnamon a bit and I also topped with powdered sugar for extra deliciousness! I was told to make again tonight,which I am in the process ofndoing! Thank for an amazing recipe!

I just tried this today. I had my husband and 6 kids try it.  They said it was better than the one they had the day prior at the fair.  I normally try a recipe properly and don't change anything important if I plan on rating, but we have only whole wheat flour. That is what I used.  I made only half the recipe and it made 8, 8x4in ears.  I omitted the last step of putting the sugar/cinnamon on top.  Which really isn't important since it is a personal thing what to put on it.  I just made a butter/powdered sugar/cinnamon mix and we put that on there.  They loved it.  Thanks for the recipe :)

The first attempt at making these turned out to be a mild disaster. I think I used a little bit too much oil when frying because they were more oily than anything else. Not in a hurry to make another go with the skillet and the oil, I pre-heated the oven to four hundred and baked two flattened balls for a little over ten minutes, spreading melted butter on both sides of each and sticking them back in the oven for an additional two minutes. I then coated each side with a mixture of sugar and cinnamon (significantly less than the recipe called for) and lastly a sprinkling of powdered sugar. They aren’t quite what one finds at our local waterfront (what I was hoping for) but they satisfied the craving for an elephant ear. 2.5 stars.
