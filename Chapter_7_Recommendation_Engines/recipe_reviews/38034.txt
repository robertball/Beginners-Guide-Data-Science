I love this recipe! It is very pretty and festive looking and goes great with hint of lime tortila chips...one tip...when seeding the pomegranate--place it in water, fully submerged. The seeds will sink, the rind will rise and make for stainless removal!
Enjoy!

I brought this to a party and it was a huge hit - people ask for it specifically now.  I did up the spice in the salsa by adding more peppers (I did 3 jalepenos and 3 serranos - gave it a really good kick).

Great salsa! Very unique, wonderful flavor combination and beautiful colors. Even better with a chopped cucumber! I use this for wraps and as a topping for burgers. So flavorful, healthy and fresh.

This is my favorite salsa recipe. I buy pomegranates on sale or discounted and I freeze the juicy seeds and save them to make this salsa with!

I like the recipe.  It tastes really good.  However, I am not sure I made it right.  I do not know what a "sprig" means or if "bunches" is what is sold at the store?  Thanks.

This recipe is fabulous, it is like a party in your mouth with all of the flavors. The lime Tortilla chips are the perfect accompaniment to go with it. I am not fond of Italian Parsley so I omitted it.

Wasn't sure how this was going to be, but I like salsa and I've been addicted to pomegranates the past few weeks... It was really good, and looks great, too.  Only thing is, my "bunches" must be bigger than the authors; I used one bunch of cilantro and one bunch of parsley, and the pomegranate seeds got lost, even with a large fruit.   Ended up using two fruits' worth of seeds, and added some more lime juice and mint.  People were a little skeptical, but those who tried it loved it!

Excellent recipe!  Not a spicy salsa, so if that's what you crave, you might need to kick up the peppers.  While I like mine spicy, but this was a nice change.  It is very fresh tasting and different from any other salsa I've tried.  My husband also loves it.  Takes some time to chop everything, but worth the effort.  Too bad pomegranate season is so short!  I usually didn't use all of the herbs called for, but like an earlier poster, am not sure whether I'm putting in the right amounts: sprig vs. bunch, etc.  Put the seeds in early so you can see whether the herbs are overtaking them.  I would think this would also taste good with strawberries in it if you can't find pomegranate seeds!  Thanks for the recipe!

A big round of applause to you, Dragonsbane! Delicious! I'm known for my salsas and always have to show up everywhere, to every event or gathering with some outstanding salsa. Making it more important that I amaze, my friends and I are in a cooking competition at every gathering. At least in my mind we are. (I'm quite competitive) I wanted something new to present at my recent holiday party. So I went on to my trusty All Recipes and found this gem. WOW! As always,with this dish on my "side"  I was the unofficial winner in our unofficial cooking contest. *I followed the recipe as closely as possible.

This salsa is a combination of interesting flavors. My family enjoyed it. I think it tastes better the longer the flavors have a chance to meld.

This is so good.  I used canned chilies instead of a fresh jalapeno because I didn't have one.

I wasn't crazy about the modified version of this recipe that I made, but my Thanksgiving company loved it.  Half of my company cannot tolerate anything spicy, so I used 2 regular red peppers instead of the spicy ones called for.  I measured 1/3 Cup each of the cilantro and parsley, and that was plenty.  i did not use mint, since I didn't have any.  I cut up a small red onion, but "small" is subjective and the onion overpowered the pomegranate seeds.  i would limit the onion to 1/4 C max.  I added a cucumber, as suggested by another reviewer.  i thought that balanced out the flavors nicely.   All in all, this was a very expensive recipes to make for the results I got.

I've now made this twice in one week (once for coworkers... FRI... and once for book club ladies... MON) . Both times everyone raved about how delicious and unusual it was. I agree!  Neither time did I put in the parsley... it's just not an ingredient that I care for.  I also added more tomato and more pomegranate seeds (as I have a pom bush and was looking for a way to use as much pom seeds as possible). This recipe is a nice balance between the red onion, the cilantro, the slight heat of the peppers, and the sweet/tart of the pom. A winner all the way around!

First off - yum! Not crazy about tons of herbs so only used about 12 grams of each, minus stems, which to me was plenty for one pomegranate. added everything else but the peppers. It was so delicious I almost didn't save any for my husband to try.

We loved it, but Hubby was confused about the large amount of cilantro & parsley. He  used 1  bunch of each and it came out fine. There seemed to be a little too much onion for the amount of herbs he used but we will know better next time! This was a hit at Thanksgiving dinner.

I have made this for a few parties and it is always  the first thing to go. People are pleasantly surprised by the pomegranate and how great all the flavors go together! Definitely a favorite!
