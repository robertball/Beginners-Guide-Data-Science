No doubt, this is a 5 star recipe!  I absolutely LOVED this dish. Here's what I did to make it extra special... and tasty.  I spread a bit of the soup mixture on the bottom of my casserole dish. So I wouldn't waste unused stuffing, I combined what was left with a little chicken broth (just enough to moisten the stuffing) and added it to the dish (after the soup layer). I then mixed the herb packet and stuffing called for in the recipe in a large zip-lock bag (I don't think the recipe directs to use the herb packet...). I think this really helps distribute the flavors. I topped with chicken breasts, Swiss cheese (I used Alpine Swiss) and more sauce. I melted the butter as directed and poured over the chicken, and also added a few extra pats (you can't have too much butter!) just to be sure that the casserole kept moist in the oven. This dish goes well with green beans, cold applesauce and milk. Thanks for sharing. This one's a definite keeper!

I make this recipe all the time... but one change makes a HUGE difference... my family has always used the "Traditional Sage" or "Savory Herb" variety of dry stuffing mix (Stouffers).  Melt the butter, mix in the stuffing THEN sprinkle over top before baking.  I guarantee this will take this recipe over the top.

I think the concept for this dish was really good. However for those of you who decide to use a ready made stuffing mix like "Stove Top" (which I did)I would HIGHLY recommend that you prepare the stuffing first, then added it to the top of the dish. I didn't do this as I followed the directions and it came out WAY TOO SALTY. I actually like salty food but the combination of the full strength stuffing and the cream of chicken was a SALTY combo. I also removed the tin foil half way through the cooking process to crisp up the the stuffing. One other note. If you chicken breast are really large and think I would recommend pounding them down a bit befor preparing. Mine were really think and took an additional 25 minutes in the oven.

Mmmmmmm.  :)  I made this for my husband, hoping that it was similar to one that I'd received from a kitchen business....and he loved it!  I changed it a wee little bit.  I put the cream of chicken in a bowl, and used the can to fill it up with 1/3 milk and 2/3 white wine.  I just used some leftover dry stuffing that I had on hand, so I don't know, it may have been more than 8 ounces, use your judgment on liquid depending on how much you use and how moist you want it.  I also put in some herb and garlic seasonings in the dish with the liquid.  I thought it would be sorta bland without it.  When I poured it over the dish, I pushed the stuffing down underneath the liquid, because I didn't want dry stuffing and I didn't use the butter (I just used a wee little bit on top instead of what the recipe recommended, I'm trying to cut out some fat from our recipes).  It was wonderful!  I only gave it four stars because I altered it.  Next time, I think I'll put fresh mushrooms in it as well.

A fairly salty casserole, but this is just my personal preference showing through. I have made it twice, the second time reducing the sodium by using Healthy request soup, plain stuffing, and asiago cheese, rather than swiss. I cut the chicken in bite-sized pieces and added large hunks of broccoli florets and asparagus. My family enjoyed it with the modifications. Thanks for a great starting point Melanie.

I've made a few changes.  Instead of 1/4 cup milk, I use a full soup can of liquid.  I fill the can about 3/4 of the way with milk and then add dry cooking sherry to fill the can the rest of the way.  This gives it a wonderful flavor and extra creamy sauce!  I also sautee onions and mushrooms in a little butter and put that over the cheese before I pour the sauce on.  It's a very good recipe and my family loves it!

Great recipe, with a few modifications.  I mix a can of cream of mushroom soup with 1/3 c. milk, add 2 1/2 cups stuffing, then spread this on bottom of pan, forming a sort of "crust".  Next layer is the chicken, which I cut into bite-size pieces.  Then a layer of swiss, followed by a can of cream of chicken soup mixed with 1/3 c. milk.  I put 3 cups of stuffing mix on top, then drizzle butter on top.  YUM!!

COLLECTION OF REVIEWS:  So many reviews, who to go with?!? I tried this many of the suggested ways, and this is what tastes best for the company I've served it to many times now... 1) definitely melt the UNSALTED butter (way too salty if salted butter is used) in a bowl and then add plain or my preference of any flavored uncooked stuffing.  2) Spray with PAM then add pounded chicken or thin breasts.  Add some seasoning on the chicken such as Mrs. Dash.  3) Add mozzerella chicken on top of each piece  4) Add the soup, 1/8C milk & 1/8C wine mixture (or all milk but the wine really does bring out the flavor) into the 13X9 pan.  5) Press the stuffing down with your fingers so all is covered is soup.  6)COVER with foil as directed and bake for 50 min uncovering the last 15 so stuffing isn't soggy!  This is great to make ahead of time and keep in the fridge.

Awesome meal! Like others said, it's a great base recipe. I cut the chicken into strips, layered with bacon (pre-cooked in microwave) and baby spinach. Then I added the cheese, soup, and stuffing mix. Huge hit, no left overs!

Wonderful! I was searching for my husband's late grandmother's recipe for a dish like this one...this was IT!  The only thing she (and I) did differently was to mix the soup with sherry (instead of milk), which really makes the dish. My husband was so excited...it was like a blast from his past!  Very good, quick & easy, economical and oh, sooo delicious!  This is going in my recipe box!

Swiss didn't go well.  I think mozzarella would be better.

This is excellent! I used wine instead of milk to add a little more flavor. One reviewer suggested using sherry and I think that would be better than just white wine. I also used Stove Top Cornbread stuffing (since I had one already in the house) and I melted the 1/2 cup butter and mixed it into the stuffing before sprinkling it in top. I didnt think there was going to be enough sauce, so I added about a half a can of cream of mushroom soup to the cream of chicken. My husband loved it--totally a keeper!

I really enjoyed this.  I did it in the crock pot as well.  Layered the raw chicken in the bottom and sprinked paprika and garlic salt.  I then put a slice of canadian bacon on top of each breast and then the sliced swiss cheese.  Poured the cream of chicken over that. Sauteed onion, garlic (lots) and mushrooms in olive oil and butter and added it to the stuffing Pepperidge farm mixture along with white wine and milk both.  Poured that on top of the chicken and cooked on low for three or four hours. Was very very tasty!  Served with cranberrys and green beans.  I will def make this again.

This was a hit with my family.  It can be made in a crock pot, too!  I combined the milk and soup in the bottom of a fairly large, oval crock pot.  Set chicken on top, then the cheese, ham, stuffing mix and butter.  Cook on low for about 5-6 hours, or on high for 2-3 hours.

Love this recipe! After reading through most of the reviews, though, I did find a few things that really make the difference. Definitely cut the chicken breasts in half. Use more cheese and cover the entire casserole with it. Make the stuffing ahead, before adding to casserole.  Remove foil for last 10 minutes of cook time to brown stuffing. Pepperidge Farms is the best stuffing mix choice!  Stovetop is a bit on the salty side.  With those changes in place, this is total comfort food that my entire family(including some picky teenagers) asks for again and again.

I kind of had my doubts when I saw how simple the ingredients were, but this is REALLY good! I only used 3 chicken breasts (there were only 3 of us eating), but made the rest of the recipe as written. I used Stove Top Stuffing. It turned out awesome! This will go into our regular rotation. Thanks!!!

Um...YUM! This was FABULOUS! 1. SIMPLE to make and 2. DELICIOUS. The only change (I know - I hate when people say that) is that I used Cream of Chicken with Herbs soup because that was all I could find in the store. Mom of two always looking for simple meals - adding this to my collection! THANK YOU!

My whole family as well as myself love this dish! It's a real treat whenever I make it. Although I do the chicken just a little different, I cut it up into pieces and add it in. It makes it more like a casserole, and you just have to spoon it out, it also gives you a chance to put more or less chicken in depending on your preference.

This recipe is a favorite in my home.  I have made it different ways now.  It is good just how it is.  I have added both bacon and  ham on top of chicken... before the cheese (delicious).  Also I have used swiss, provolone and cheddar.  Especially good with provolone!  Cover dish for first half hour then uncover for last 25 min.  I add fresh green beans or asparagus in a pile next to chicken, top it and cook the same.  Easy meal and wonderful reviews from the fam!

Huge hit in my house - even with my 4-year old who barely eats anything.  Seriously, this is the first casserole I've seen her truly enjoy.  I took the suggestions of a few others and added in my own recommendations.  I spread a bit of the condensed soup on the bottom of my baking dish and then placed the chicken.  Sprinkled it with garlic powder and pepper, then poured the liquid over.  I used shredded swiss along with a bit of mozz which I think added more flavor to the dish than I expected!  Mixed the melted butter with the stuffing (GREAT SUGGESTION) and then baked.  Delicious, moist and tasty.

Made this earlier tonight for dinner.  It was an immediate hit with everyone!  I served it over hot, buttered egg noodles with corn, a green salad and an oven-hot loaf of crusty ciabatta bread on the side.  This casserole is very easy to make and a definite palate-pleaser!  Will make again often.

Turned outpretty well.  I peeked under the foil after about 35 minutes and the stuffing looked a little dry so I sprinkled some water on top.  I'm glad otherwise it would have been too crunchy.  I also added a little sherry to one side so I could compare.  We will definately use sherry next time. Probably about 1/4 cup or more if we sub for milk.  My husband suggested adding some capers next time and I think we will try that.  Thanks for a good simple recipe that can be made in a jiffy with things I have on hand!

I've been making this for years. The only thing I do differently is to sprinkle a little poultry seasoning on the chicken - everything else is just as the recipe states.  The flavor is very good and easy to make for a week night supper.

Sometimes you wonder if you mix a few things if it will taste like chicken and cheese, or will it turn into something magical.  This tastes so good! Serious comfort food.  I see what people are saying about the saltiness (I used Stove Top Chicken).  This takes so much longer to cook than the recipe states, so I will probably cut the breasts in half from now on and cook at 400 for 50 minutes.

This was very quick and easy. I did make a few small changes though. I chopped the chicken into bite sized pieces, i used shredded swiss cheese and used cream of mushroom with roasted garlic soup to add a little more flavor. Even my kids loved this!

I mixed the milk, soup and stuffing then just poured over chicken breast with the sliced swiss cheese.  I put pats of butter over the top and baked.  I love to find easy dishes that taste good.  I think I will open a can of cranberry sauce the next time I make this.

A new family favorite! My one change: diced the chicken into bite-size pieces. Otherwise, good to go with original recipe. Perfect comfort food.

I find this dish to be tasty and re-heats well the next day as a left over.  I do make the stuffing first, as suggested in the reviews and then sprinkle it on the top.

This recipe is good to go just as it is.  You have baked chicken, stuffing and gravy with a hint of swiss.  The only change I make is that I add alittle bit more milk because we enjoy the gravy.  It's an easy, satisfying quick meal.  I'll never figure out why people on here give a poor rating when they've changed the recipe so much that it isn't even close to the original.  Follow this recipe and you'll have a quick tasty meal with tender chicken and stuffing with gravy.  What could be better?

I plan all meals and cook two days a week for a family in Los Angeles. We have tried hundreds of recipes, but only keep the A+'s. This recipe got an A+++. It is so easy, I feel slightly guilty when I make it, like I should be working harder. Another bonus: it is delicious the next day...maybe even more delish!

This is a really easy good recipe.  I added 1/2 cup white wine to it and it added a lot.  I think the chicken and mushroom soup tastes the best, but it makes it very rich.  You can use the low fat soups and cheeses and it still tastes good.  I think the type of stuffing that you chose makes a difference and my favorite is Pepperidge Farms' herb seasoned stuffing.  I think it compliments the chicken and sauce really well.  One tip is to mix the wet ingredients with the stuffing and then pour it on top.  That makes it really moist.  Also, I cut the butter in half and it was PLENTY!

This is one of my favorite recipes ever. It's a pretty common recipe (my mom had one passed down from her mom), but this variant is the closest to that.  I've tried both bite sized pieces as well as breasts, and they're both good.   The most important tip is to mix the butter with the stuffing ahead of time; otherwise the stuffing has a tendency to turn out dry.

This is such a quick and easy casserole for those weekday meals. I layer chicken, swiss cheese, ham (if I have it), cream of mushroom soup, and then the chicken stuffing with the butter. Then make a quick side of veggies and you have a fast dinner with little prep.

This recipe is very similar to one I used many years ago except for one thing...add 1/4 cup white wine to the soup instead of the milk, makes it real yummy!  The whole family enjoys this recipe and I will continue to make it through the years.

Oh my! This was soooo goooood! The only thing that I did different was that I bought a package of thick sliced Swiss and it came with 8 slices so I put 1 and 1/3 slice on top of each chicken breast. Then I sprinkled some black pepper on top of the cheese. I love my stuffing with a little crunch so I did pull off the foil half way through cooking. Sooooo awesome! We just loved it! I served it with baby Brussels sprouts covered with a slice of American cheese! Just a great meal! Thank you so much! I will make this again for sure!!!

Easy and everyone at the table loved it.  No left overs... I'm making a bigger portion next time.  I didn't use all the butter, just 2 tablespoons and added boiling water to make 1/2 cup.  Poured it over the stuffing and then covered the dish with aluminum foil.  I removed the foil for the last 10 minutes of cooking to let the top brown.  A winner.

If you make this with half a soup can of white wine and half a can of milk  like I did, this recipe is a 5 star.  Major comfort food.  I love cheese, so I doubled the swiss.  Because of the extra liquid, I cut the butter down to about 1/3 cup, which I sauteed fresh mushrooms with and poured it over the top.  Everyone raved!  Oh, and I used cream of mushroom rather than cream of chicken because, if you can't tell, I love mushrooms! Yummy!!!  This will become one of my regulars.

I made this casserole for a Sunday dinner and it was wonderful. Very easy to prepare. I used a can of cream if chicken mushroom soup. The swiss cheese gives it a great flavor. I served this with mashed potatoes and corn.It was a big hit. this recipe is a keeper.

I thought this was easy to prepare.  It was very good, I used FF cream of mushroom and plain stuffing so I didn't think it was salty at all as some reviewers had commented.  My husband and kids all thought it was great too!  Might cut down on the butter next time.

I was expecting dressing and chicken. The dressing, soup and cheese became very "gooey" and became more of a sauce. It would be great over rice or noodles. Although it didn't turn out how I imagined, it was very tasty and I will try it again.

Ver, very good. I wish I could give this a 4.5 rating because I reserve 5 stars for incredible dishes. I made this in the crock pot ( low heat for 2 hours, then high heat for about 45 minutes). The chicken was INCREDIBLY moist! I cut up the chicken before I added it to the crock pot.  I did add some sherry to the recipe as others suggested, but other than that I followed the recipe to a T.

Great and easy. Ingredients always on hand.  After reading other reviews, I spread a thin layer of soup and milk mixture-used Cream of chicken with herbs-on the bottom of casserole and sprinkled chicken with Mrs Dash, poultry seasoning, garlic powder and pepper.  
Placed 2 pieces of cheese on each breast-used swiss on half of the breasts and provolone on the other half-didn't have enough of 1 kind for all- spouse liked swiss, I prefered provolone.
Mixed the melted butter with grilled onions with Herb flavored Pepperidge farm stuffing. Did not uncover-some of the stuffing was crunchy and some was not- a good variety in my opinion.  I always use a meat thermometer-it reached temperature 5 minutes before suggested.  Husband loved it told me to add it to the menu.  
The suggestion of adding broccoli to casserole was a good one-think I will try that next time.  
I think this would be a 5 star recipe without any changes, but my husband and I prefer a little extra zing to our meals.

YUM!  My chicken came out perfectly moist and done after 50 mins.  I did find it salty, I used Stove Top, but I think that using unsalted butter on the top would fix that.  I'd also try to use less butter since it calls for a lot. Will definitely make this again though!!!

Super simple recipe.  Since I had LARGE chicken breasts, I cut them into smaller pieces and baked for 60 minutes.  Next time I prepare, I will use a lower sodium soup.  Wonderful recipe to serve at a Potluck or large gathering!

My family has been making this recipe since my mom was a girl. We have made a few changes over the years. We had a little wine (maybe 1/4 cup) to the soup mixture, as well as some parmesan cheese (about 1/4 cup.) I do not usually put the butter on top, and use healthy request type of soup.

To make this dish less salty, try Healthy Request soup and low sodium Stove Top.  If you're using real butter (I didn't - I used Smart Balance), use unsalted butter.  When you combine these ingredients with salty cheese, this dish still won't be lacking for salt, and you won't be craving large glasses of water afterward.

This was awesome! I used 1/4 cup milk and 1/4 cup white wine for extra flavor and I also prepared the stuffing mix in advance, following package instructions and then topped the casserole with it. So easy and so yummy! I'll definitely be remaking this one!

I thought this would have turned out better than it was, especially after reading all the great reviews.  I followed the recipe and subbed white wine for the milk.  It was ok, but nothing outstanding.  I guess I didn't like all the soup that seemed to "lay" on top.  On the positive, it WAS very easy to make.

This was really good and super easy!! I agree that it was a little salty, but nothing unbearable. I think next time I'll go with low sodium soup and look for low sodium stuffing also. But this is a great recipe for yummy baked chicken!

simple and I liked it. Though I browned the chicken first and put a chicken bouillon soup and heated it up. Why? Well, it takes out some of the fat intake.

We LOVED this! I used several more slices of swiss cheese than it called for. We used herb stuffing mix. Make sure you keep the dish covered or the stuffing will dry out. Great recipe - thanks!

This was ok... I added 1 pack of frozen chopped broccoli to the bottom. I think I should have cooked it less. I also would season my soup more. This was my first attempt using soup to cook.

Very quick! =) I used chicken tenderloins and added broken up fresh asparagus (the fat stalks worked great) and Healthy Request soup. Also a bit of cayenne. Baked about 40 minutes covered, then a few more without foil to crisp up the topping. Hubby said, "put this on the List!"

This was pretty good - definitely one of those homecooked winter meals, and a nice change from the chicken and rice.  I used Provolone on some of the chicken but I'm not sure we could tell the difference.

My husband and I love this recipe! I do make a few small changes. As per the suggestion of another I spread a small amount (1/4 cup) of the soup/milk and stuffing(1/2 cup premade) on the bottom and then lay the chicken on top. I like to use Provolone cheese as it best suits our tastes and then top with remaining stuffing mix. It was a big hit in our home and I hope that it works as well for everyone else too! Thanks for the recipe and suggestions.

This is very tastey!  My husband and daughter both enjoyed it.  Nothing healthy about this dish though so I would recommend pairing it with veggies instead of what the recipe suggests, and next time I think I will also try a low sodium soup, it was pretty salty.  Thanks for this very easy and quick recipe, will make again!!

Following another reviewers advice, I mix a can of cream of mushroom soup with 1/3 c. milk, add 2 1/2 cups stuffing, then spread this on bottom of pan, forming a sort of "crust". Next I layer the chicken, which I cut in half. Then a layer of swiss which I doubled, followed by a can of cream of chicken soup mixed with 1/3 c. milk. I mixed the stuffing and the butter and put on top. Next time, I want to try putting the dry stuffing and drizzling the butter on top like the recipe states to maybe retain some "crunch". By mixing the butter and the stuffing, it was a bit soggier than I like. I uncovered it the last 10 minutes to try to get the top crunchy. My hubby LOVED it b/c he likes dressing/stuffing so much.:-) YUM!!

This was a very yummy casserole. I put a bit of the chicken soup down first in dish. I also mixed the butter with the stuffing mix before I put on top of casserole. My husband thought it was even better reheated the next day. This is definitely a keeper.

Followed some other's suggestions and we enjoyed the heck outta this.  It's just the 2 of us, so I had two big chicken breasts, which I cut in 1/2.  Sprayed a glass 13 x 9 pan, then chicken, sliced portabella mushrooms, cream of mushroom with garlic mixed with chicken broth poured on top of that, mixed shredded cheeses on top of that, stuffing (sage flavored) on top of that, slices of butter on top of that.  Oh, and I stuck some leftover baby carrots in and around the chicken.  I covered with foil and baked for 1/2 the time, checked on it and poured the rest of the can of chicken broth on the stuffing and smushed the stuffing down to soak it up.  After full cooking time, I took the foil off, sprinkled a 'lil more shredded cheese on top and baked 10 minutes or so longer.  This was really very very good comfort food.

I found a very similar recipe a few years ago and this is my husband's favorite dish. The only difference is, I mix the can of soup with 1/2 cup white wine and a can of sliced mushrooms.  The wine REALLY adds to the flavor of this dish.

This was really good! I subbed the juice from half a lemon (it was a juicy lemon) for the milk to give it a little zip. I uncovered the dish halfway through cooking to brown the stuffing mix a bit & I let it rest for 10 minutes before serving it w/ wild rice & steamed broccoli w/ butter & lemon.

Excellent.  I made mixed cream of chicken and herbs with cream of mushroom and roasted garlic.  I also added onions for more flavor.  This was just yummy!  A great meal to serve for company.  It is sure to please everyone.  And it is very easy!

I have loved this recipe since a friend made it for me when I had my second child. It is easy to prepare and is just pure comfort. Makes for a great dish to take to someone who is getting out of the hospital or is sick. I am a bigger fan of this dish than my husband but he tends not to like chicken anyway. Definately cut the chicken up into little bites.

I really enjoyed this meal, my husband, however, said it was "alright". I added broccoli so that it was a complete meal within itself.  I also doubled the swiss cheese and thankgoodness I did, I found the cheese to be very subtle even with it doubled.  I also added an extra 1/4 cup of milk because I thought the sauce was going to end up too thick, and again I'm glad I did because it would of been.  The chicken was very moist and the stuffing was great, it did not get soggy at all.  Next time I will try it with wine and even more cheese.

Delicious and kid-friendly! The first time I made this recipe I thought it was too salty so I made note and used low-sodium soup the next time. It was perfect! This one freezes nicely too.

Moist,easy and delicous. I mixed soup with a half can of milk and white wine in equal parts. I used pepper jack cheese instead of swiss. Next time i'm going to add a can of green chili peppers to cream of chicken soup to add some kick. Hubby loved it.

WOW this dish is awesome!  My son is 39 and very picky about what he eats.  We had him over for dinner and he loved it.  He said that every time he comes to dinner he wants this dish with mashed potatoes.  My husband and I loved it also!   The only thing I change was to add two extra slices of swiss cheese, tje chicken breast were pretty big.  I can honestly say this will be a recipe on my menu often!  Easy, inexpensive and wonderful!

DELICIOUS!!!! It reminds me of Thanksgiving dinner all in one casserole! Made it as is. Then made it again without Swiss , used monterey instead , liked that a bit better but both ways are yummy. I make this every month as my family loves it.

Excellent dish!  The chicken was very tender.  The dish was a bit too salty for me, and I love love love salt.  Next time I may try to shake some of the salty flavoring out of the stuffing mix by putting it in a colander over the sink and letting it fall through the holes into the sink...I will make this again and often!

My whole family enjoyed this recipe!  Very easy to make and tastes great.  I really only had to make a veggie side to go with it since it has the chicken and stuffing.  Very good comfort type food.

This was very good.  I followed the recipe exactly except for adding 1/4 to 1/2 cup of cooking sherry along with the milk.  I didn't mix up the stuffing before placing it on top, I just dumped the box on top.  Thanks for an easy, tasty recipe.

I love this recipe.  I brown the chicken first to add more flavor, and I use 1 c Sour Cream instead of the milk.  I didn't put butter on the top, but rather poked the dry stuffing down into the soup/sour cream mixture.  Next time I'm adding sautéed mushrooms. Yum!

I make this at least once a month.  It's so easy, quick , and very filling.  I use chicken tenderloins, 98% fat free cream of chicken soup, and StoveTop Chicken Stuffing.  I make the stuffing ahead of time, put it on top, bake 30 minutes covered, 20 minutes uncovered.  Always comes out moist and very yummy!  :-)

I've made this recipe a few times and finally I read the other reviews and glad i did-with a few small changes this recipe was even better.  Keep in mind it does taste salty so make sure to use low sodium soup and unsalted butter...Here are the other changes i made-mix stuffing with 3/4 can of soup and a splash of white wine Sherry (if you have it) and milk, then spread it in your dish, then cut chicken into bite size pieces, then top with cheese, melt butter and mix with remaining soup and pour over top.  remove foil for last 10 minutes to brown the top-Perfecto!  (my husband who normally never raves about chicken could not stop talking about this dish!

Yum! Good and easy recipe. I did lightly salt, pepper and garlic powder the chicken before layering the cheese on it. I added a little chicken broth to it in the last 10 minutes of cooking  because my stuffing was chewy. This helped alot - i may not have measured the milk correctly resulting in not enough liquid for the stuffing to soften propperly. The stuffing on the chicken was actually a little crunchy- like a breading. and the rest of the stuffing was soft to eat on the side. This is a keeper!

This definitely deserves five stars. I followed the recipe except for two things: I cut the chicken into decent-sized strips (3 pieces per chicken breast) and I mixed the stuffing with butter before spreading it on top of the pan. Awesome :)

We loved the flavor of this but the stuffing was too dry.  I put foil over it and did not peek. I think next time I will mix the stuffing with some water first or better yet some chicken broth.

I have made this recipe for years, but I make it in the crock pot instead. Spray the crock pot with Pam, then layer the ingredients. Cook on low for 8-10 hours or high for 4-5. This is one of our family favorites, and the house smells great all day!

This is super easy to make and tastes fantastic!  It's just your basic chicken and stuffing recipe but what I like about it is that I can throw it together in no time when I get home for work.  It creates minimal clean-up and tastes great too.  I hightly recommend this one for those busy ladies out there.

This was pretty good, and enjoyed by my family quite a bit. I did make a few minor changes - I added a bit of white wine (Reisling, though not a whole lot) to the milk and soup mixture and used cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken. I also use a bit of water on my stuffing to make it moist (of which I used Stouffer's chicken stuffing mix) and then mixed it with the sauce before putting it on top of the chicken and cheese. (I didn't want to use the butter.) About the only thing I would do differently next time would be to actually prepare the stuffing before mixing it with the sauce (instead of just using a bit of water) - I think that would make it a bit better. Otherwise, I will definitely be making this recipe again!

Delish is the best way to describe this. I tried it for dinner last night and we really enjoyed the melding of flavors that went into the chicken. Made it just as the recipe states except I added basil, oregano and thyme to the sauce before pouring over the chicken.  A KEEPER!

Yum! Thank you for a great recipe. My husband, who doesn't typically like swiss chees, even LOVES this recipe. I've made it several times, with varying crusts, and it's a big hit every time.

DH likes this because it has chicken and swiss - his favorite combo.  I usually add a bag of frozen broccoli so we get some veggies too.  It's a good casserole.

Great! My husband wasn't thrilled, but he doesn't care for chicken. I thought it was really good. The chicken was so moist even after reheating in the microwave the next day for lunch! Great flavor and so easy to put together! It's something I can throw together for myself and make something different for him without a lot of extra work. I normally do this when I want chicken and it usually takes so much extra time that I don't do it too often. I'll definitely be making this for myself many times to come though! Thanks for a great recipe that allows me to curb chicken cravings at a moments notice!

Very good!  Pretty salty though, so I'd consider getting low sodium cream of chicken soup.

EXCELLENT!!  we all loved this dish. I added a little spice to the soup, garlic powder, pepper, & a pinch of curry. I used savory herb stove top stuffing mix,and I uncovered it the last 10 min. of baking. YUMMY!!

I used mozarella (didn't have Swiss on hand), and added 1/2 c. sour cream and 1/2 t. curry powder to the soup mix. My only issue was that we needed more stuffing. Would also be good without the stuffing and served over rice or noodles. Easy and good.

Very good recipe!  I used whole wheat croutons instead of a stuffing mix, and shredded Cheddar/mozzarella instead of the Swiss cheese, but it turned out fantastic.  I also added some curry to the mix to give it a little kick.  Great recipe!

I made this for my family and thought it was a for sure keeper. I added a few extra spices( white pepper, black pepper, table blend(Mrs. Dash), garlic powder, and some oregano)and a splach of white wine. I cooked it with tin foil on top, next time I will wait to add the bread topping until about half way through and then broil it for the last 10 minutes.

Pretty darn good. Followed the recipe mostly except I threw in a can of mushrooms and some spices. It is a little bland but I will definitely try it again with some extra spices. Worked great served with brown rice.

Thank you for a wonderful starting point for my casserole! I enjoyed the ease of this recipe, as I am not the world's best cook. So I rated it a 5 for simplicity.  I altered this recipe quite a bit, though.  Not b/c there was anything I thought was bad, it's just after I had gotten all revved up about making it, I found that I had no cream of chicken soup, or stuffing. So I sub. cream of mushroom soup, and a bagged broccoli chicken rice mix made 
by Li _ t_ n:-) I put the ckicken breasts in frozen, and I used only 4 b/c they were large.  Then I added a bag of frozen broccoli, and poured half the butter over it. ( maybe i used a bit more butter than called for- I just eyed the measurement). I Added italian bread crumbs, then the rest of butter and more swiss. Hopefully no one has a heart attack from the fat and cholesterol that must be in my version. :-)  Note:  I also had no milk, so I used a can of evaporated milk(the 12 oz) and mixed it w/ some water in the hopes it would ensure the rice was thoroughly cooked)
I am anxiously awaiting the results of my masterpiece, and I will write back after we eat it tonight. Looking forward to it!
NC Jen

OMG!!!! It was AWESOME!!!! Everyone loved it,(now I have to write down my changes so i can make it again)

Four stars for taste (very good) and five stars for how quick and easy this is. The recipe is VERY similar to that on the back of the Stove Top Turkey stuffing mix. I used frozen chicken breasts from Costco. Only five fit in the pan. I didn't even thaw them, just put them in with the rest of the ingredients and baked in the convection oven.  It took exactly 60 minutes to cook. I used mozzarella cheese as I don't like Swiss, and couldn't bring myself to using a full 1/2 cup of butter so I only used 1/3 cup and it was still very good. I also used Healthy Choice low sodium soup and it wasn't too salty. Will definitely add to my list of "regulars."  To avoid butter entirely, mix the stuffing mix (6 oz only) with 1 and 2/3 cup of hot water and top the entire thing with this mixture. You will need to use 3/4 cup milk instead of 1/4 cup.

Add a slice of deli ham on top of each chicken breast, put the Swiss on top of the ham, follow the rest of the recipe (remove foil for last 10 minutes of baking). This creates a Chicken Cordon Blue that is much easier than the traditional Cordon Blue recipe. Perfect with garlic mash, a veggie, and a glass of chardonnay. Your family will never guess how easy this was.

This is definitely one our favorites. I use cream of chicken/cream of mushroom soup, mix the stuffing with the butter and remove the foil the last 10 minutes. I've tried other cheeses and like swiss best. Deeelicious!

Very good, I added a slice of ham along with the Swiss and baked first half with foil cover and second half uncovered, had to broil just long enough to brown top at the end. Will make this easy recipe again.

I made this in the slow cooker and it turned out great. I used frozen chicken breasts and a low-sodium stuffing mix; it wasn't as salty. Cooked on high for 4 hours...really good.

Excellent! Used only 1 pound of chicken (4 chicken breasts) and only used 1/2 of a stick of butter. Everyone really enjoyed it. The Swiss cheese makes the dish.

It was bland and tasteless. I made it using an extra can of soup under the chicken and it didn't help at all. I won't be trying this again.I did not like the presentation at all. Definitely a huge disappointment.

I thought this was a simple and tasty recipe.  I like my food spicy so I did alter it quite a bit.  First, I marinated the chicken for a few hours in McCormick's mesquite grill mate seasoning.  Then I used two cans of soup (one cream of chicken and one cheddar).  I also added some paprika, cayenne pepper and mushrooms to the soup.  Pepper jack cheese was substituted for swiss.  I left out the butter on top of the stuffing and instead sprayed it with Pam cooking spray and a little bit of margine, then I topped it off with some of the extra soup.  The chicken (sliced thin) turned out very tender.  There was enough extra "gravy" for me to pour over the Slow Cooker Mashed Potatoes (from this site) I made to accompany the meal.  I will make this again but next time I will probably skip the stuffing.

Delicious!  Made a few small changes after reading previous reviews (used milk & white wine combination and pressed stuffing down in the pan so that it was covered with liquid).  This dish is the ultimate comfort food meal!  Will make over and over again!

Took the others' suggestions..mixed chicken soup with some milk, covered the bottom of the pan..browned the chicken first with my own spices then added the chicken. Poured the rest of the soup mix on top of the chicken. Put the Swiss and shredded cheese mix on top of that. Added stuffing that I cooked to the packages directions first. Finished by adding little chunks of butter on top of stuffing...cooked for 30 minutes, came out delicious!! Served with baked mashed potatoes..

This is a good basic recipe but it needed something to give it a little more flavor.  I took the suggestion of a previous reviewer and added a can of green chiles to the soup mixture and it was just what this recipe needed!  The best part was that it was better the next day!

Wanted to make something without grocery shopping preferably using one of our old boxes of stuffing, and this was the recipe I came across. I didn't have high expectations but was pleasantly surprised. 

I did make a few adjustments though. I added some  dried herbs (ground thyme, garlic salt and rosemary leaves), used cream of mushroom instead since we didnt have cream of chicken, and included a little white wine on the stuffing on top to add a little extra moisture/flavor. The wine and stuffing seemed to complement each other well. Very simple and tasty and the chicken was very moist.

Great recipe and easy too! I substituted 1/3 cup of dry white wine for the milk and used a package of garlic croutons (crushed) instead of the stuffing. Very good.

Super Super Easy and fast...Great Taste. My husband suggested that we use low sodium stuffing next time as it was a tad salty.  But it was realy good.

This wasn't horrible, but definately not a keeper. We just thought it was a little "blah".  Thanks, though!

It's been a while since I have come across such a great recipe.  What I really loved was the simplicity of it.  I put it together in 5 minutes.  I changed a few things.  I used chicken strips instead of the chicken breasts so it would cook a little more quickly.  Also, instead of the cream of chicken, I used cream of mushroom and added chopped mushrooms to the milk/soup mixture.  Other than those two changes, I left it as-is.  SO GOOD.  I honestly look forward to making this again soon.  Thanks.

This was an excellent recipe that took very little time with regards to prep work.  The only thing i was unsire of was whether to use the seasoning mix that is included in the box of stuffing.  So i sprinkled a bit it over the dry bread crumbs and it turned out great.  I will make this again.  We loved the swiss cheese too!!

I really like this recipe -- it's quick and easy and tastes great.  I love swiss cheese, but I was out and made it with cheddar once.  It's also really good with cream of celery soup.

Extremely easy to make! I used 1 pound of thin sliced chicken breast and cream of chicken and mushroom soup. It was really good. Next time I will add canned sliced mushrooms to the part where you mix the soup with the milk.

This is my favorite casserole! It's super yummy as is, but I've played around, too. I use thighs instead of breasts, since they're cheaper and we like them better. A splash of white wine adds a flavor to the sauce that makes it seem extra special. Sometimes, I add sliced mushrooms under the sauce. Since my oven is unusable, I make it in a crockpot now, with great results. Just layer everything in a lined or sprayed crockpot and cook on low for 5-7 hours or high for 3-4 hours.

Love this recipe! Been making it for 23 years. I do use cream of chicken soup and American cheese as that is what my family prefers. Quick to prepare and 50 minutes later you have a delicious dinner. I pair with some green beans and carrots. I've also prepared this in the morning and then popped it into the oven when I got home from work. One of my faves! Enjoy!

I greased the dish, placed 3 boneless skinless chicken breasts cut in half sprinkled with seasoned pepper, sprinkled thawed frozen green beans and corn on top, sprinkled with shredded cheddar and Swiss, spread a can of cream of mushroom mixed with half white wine and milk, topped with dry stuffing mixed with the melted butter and baked for 35 mins covered. When I took it out to uncover and bake another 15 mins I noticed the stuffing was crunchy looking so I took a spatula and pressed the stuffing mixture down to let the soup mixture seep up and moisten it. Covered and baked another 10 mins and uncovered and baked 15 mins. This was SO easy, inexpensive, and very little cleanup. Served with instant mashed potatoes for a throw together weeknight meal. I will try this in the slow cooker during the summer when I don't want to heat up the kitchen. I am pleasantly surprised by this dish, I wasn't expecting to like it at all.

add white wine instead of milk.  Add black pepper.  I rated this 4 stars before I had kids and now it is 5 because they ate it and didn't bitch.  (The wine burns off.)

This recipe is spectacular when prepared right. Double the soup and butter or else the cornbread stuffing will not soften. And cook 20 minutes long because mine came out still pink in the middle of the pan. I made it with 2 chicken breasts the first time and it came out as perfection. The next time I used 4 chicken breasts(each cut into 3 pieces and evenly laid out in pan) and had problems with the stuffing being too hard and had to drizzle water all over the top and stick in the oven for 5 minutes longer. My husband loves this and we had guests that night and both guests and my husband went back for seconds! Other than that all is well! Bon appetite! I love this recipe!

I have a recipe very similar to this that my mother in law shared with me. The difference is that instead of using Milk, you can use white wine or orange juice to mix with the soup. Sounds crazy, but it's incredibly good and brings some more flavor to the mix. I use an unseasoned stuffing mix so that it doesn't load us up with sodium and make the dish too salty. Really, this is a great Busy Night meal that everyone likes at our house.

Well it went over so well that I almost didn't get any.  It was gone so fast!!  I will be making this again very soon.  I did premix the butter with and used a box of stovetop chicken stuffing for the topping.  It was so good!!!

Was a little disappointed in this recipe- don't think I will make it again- the leftovers are not as good as when it is originally made- maybe it needed some rice or noodles to serve it over?

This is an easy meal to make.  Tasted good.  Not delicious --- but good.  My bf was satisfied.  I used Cream of Celery instead and alittle garlic salt on the breast before adding the other.  I will still make again sometime.

Fantastic! Easy! Delicious! Surprised! Followed recipe to a tee (almost).  Pounded chicken, used Savory Stove Top, used a bit less butter, & took cover off halfway through cooking for 50 mins. Will lightly season & butter egg noodles next time.

Yummmy!  The only downside is that it has more calories than I'd prefer.  I followed the recipe to a T.  Loved it!

This is pretty good, if you've never had chicken casserole before and have nothing to compare it to, you would say this is good!  However, I make chicken casserole that is considerably better, but it requires more effort.  For this amount of effort I would recommend monterey chicken or smothered chicken-it's simple to prepare like this dish is and way better. Thanks for the recipe, it was simple to make, baking time was actually 1 hour and 10 minutes to assure the chicken is done.  My husband said he would give it a 9 on scale 1-10 if he had not eaten my other cooking dishes, but with what he could have had instead of this on the same line it dropped this recipe to a 2 on scale of 1-10 for him.

Great recipe.  We eat baked chicken atleast once a week so I'm always looking for another way to prepare it.  I used chicken tenders because I had some in my fridge I needed to use.  Came out good, except I should have cut down the bake time a tad.  We will definately make these again.

I love this recipe and so does my hubby.  I use canned chicken and make my own crumb topping with soda crackers, italian seasoning and butter. Like others said it's also very good with provolone. Since I'm using chicken pieces instead of breast, I just smother it in cheese since that is what we like. Very good and easy!

I agree that the stuffing would have been better if mixed with the butter before putting it on the casserole. This was a good recipe, but not amazing. We'll make it again based on its simplicity and the on-hand ingredients that are always stocked in my pantry.

This was okay, nothing spectacular, just your run of the mill chicken casserole with cream of chicken soup.  I have made simlar casseroles however, never added cheese.  The addition of the cheese made the casserole a little creamier, which I liked.  However, I do agree this was very salty.

I kept to the ingredients listed. Only thing I did was take the advise for cooking it in the crock pot.  Glad I did it came out great.  My hubby loved it.  He was a little worried because of the swiss cheese but it didn't over power it and I even added 2 extra slices just to use it up.  The chicken was so moist we didnt even need a knife to cut it, was able it pull it apart with a fork.  If I have anything to change, next time I will season the chicken a little.  Chicken is a little bland if you don't have the some of the topping with it.  Great recipe!!

Maybe this is just not my type of dish, I did not like it very much. I followed the recipe- and it was OKAY at best. I ended up removing all the stuuffing/soup from the chicken and making chicken salad, we did not want to finish eating this!!

Very yummy, very easy! I added some hot sauce to the soup mixture and used shredded swiss. Next time will use low fat Cream of Chicken and more hot sauce.

Yum!  This was really an easy tasty dinner.  I only modified slightly.  Here's what I did: After placing the chicken breasts in my 9X13 glass pan, I sprinkles with grilled chicken seasoning (mostly garlic).  I then topped with the soup combined with the milk.  I didn't have Swiss cheese, so I used sharp cheddar, but I think Swiss might have been more flavorful, so stick with that.  Then I topped with  about 3 cups of the stuffing mix and a bit more melted butter than it said.  My breasts were pretty big so I baked about an hour.  It was really yummy.

A solid go-to meal after a long day.  One pan, no muss, no fuss.  I usually add a little white wine to the soup can to clean out the leftover, and add a little something more to the sauce.

My family absolutely loves this recipe! It's extremely simple to make and tastes amazing. Even the pickiest of the pickiest eaters have enjoyed this. The only changes I did when making this is to put some of the cream of chicken mixture on the bottom of the baking dish before placing the chicken in. I also use "pepperidge farms herb stuffing mix" instead of just any regular stuffing mixture. It truly does add a lot of taste to this recipe. I also mix the stuffing with the melted butter before placing it on top of the chicken. This makes sure that the stuffing won't turn out hard or dry when it is done cooking. GREAT RECIPE!!!!!!

I've been making this for years the exact same way.  My husband requests this at least once a week.  He prefers provolone to swiss.  But other than that, i wouldn't change a thing.  Super simple and really yummy!

I loved this!! I actually had a similar recipe my Mother gave me years ago and I didn't try it--wish I had!! So good! Didn't have swiss cheese and used mozarella. Will try swiss next time. Uncovered at end for 10 to "crisp" up the stuffing. Thank you!!!

So quick and easy to make on a weeknight.  I added frozen broccoli and it was a whole meal.  I think the stuffing brand I used was a little salty but it was still tasty.  After my husband finished his plate he asked if I would make it again tomorrow.

This recipe came to the rescue when I was trying to stretch my pantry until payday! I had a bag of frozen boneless skinless chicken breast strips, shredded swiss cheese (added after the cr. of chix soup), smart balance instead of butter, and cracker crumbs instead of stuffing--and it still turned out spectacular. The swiss cheese really made the recipe. So good!

I followed the recipe and i'm not sure what the rave was about. Perhaps because most changed the recipe.  Why does it get five stars if the recipe has to be changed? I give it 3 for being a good starting point.

This recipe was excellent! I seasoned the chicken as other reviewers had suggested and mixed the stuffing with the melted butter before putting it on the chicken/soup. The stuffing was still a little crunchy when we ate it, but I really didn't mind. It was nice to have a little crunch in there. If you don't want the crunch, then you should do as others suggested and try cooking the stuffing fully before adding to the dish (maybe we'll try that next time). I did as others suggested and removed the foil for the last 10 minutes. We really enjoyed this dish and there were no leftovers!

This was delicious!  Everyone loved it. I cut the chicken up into large chunks. Added frozen organic mixed veggies (carrots, zuchinni, brocolli, califlour) and used lite white Cheddar instead of 
Swiss. Took the suggestion of replacing  milk with Chardonnay with Healthy Request chicken soup. Added  garlic powder, pepper, oragno, and Spike seasoning, mixed it altogether and poured it over the chicken. Used Mrs. Cubbisons stuffing mix adding onions, butter and some water (would have used some chicken broth if I had it) to moisten the dressing and added it the last 20 minutes with foil still on. Removed the foil and put under broiler for about 10 minutes before serving. Will make it again!

My family liked this casserole. I made it just as the recipe states. The Swiss cheese did not stand out as much as I would have hoped. Next time I might try making this dish using a sharp Cheddar cheese instead!

Easy, Quick and Yummy.  I have made it several times. Usually just grab whatever "Cream of...soup" I have in the pantry to use, I even used Cream of Poblano soup once and that gave a nice bit of spice.

This recipe was delicious!  I have three sometimes very picky kids and a very picky husband that gobbled this right up. As to the person who said that this dish is too salty I love salty foods and I would consider this only mildly salty. Two thumbs way up!

Holy moly this was so good! Anyone can make this, seriously. I've made it twice and everybody was pleasantly surprised. I make garlic mashed potatoes with it and it's a perfect combination. Good to make when it's cold out.

Excellent recipe, I found it to be too salty. So the next time I will use healthy request soup and find a stuffing with lower sodium. I spread some soup mixture in bottom of pan, then added some of the stuffing, then added the remaining ingredients. Very TASTY!

Yummy! We loved this recipe. There was no way I could fit all 6 breast in a 13x9 though so I used a bigger pan. I also used Mozzerella cheese. I cut each slice of chesse in half so I could cover the whole breast. I used more then 1/4 cup of milk in the soup so I could cover the whole pan. I covered it all with the stuffing and butter and it was really good. Will put in my regular rotation. Thanks for the recipe!!!

This recipe was so simple and tasted phenominal! I had about 6 guests for dinner and everyone raved about how delicious it was. The only thing I would say it that it tasted a little salty but that's probably because of the stuffing I used. Next time I'll look for something with less sodium. Enjoy!

This is comfort food at its best and for such a basic recipe it's great! I make it for friends with new babies etc. I use Cheddar not Swiss. And 2 cups of stuff (not sure it that is 8 oz or not) and that is sufficient. I also add some dried minced onion to the soup mixutre as well as garlic salt.

Absolutely an Awesome and easy dish.  I have handed out this recipe to a couple people that have already tried it and loved it also.  It's a keeper.  A note: I used both swiss and provolone.  I filleted the chicken breast and made two layers of chicken, one with swiss on it and the second layer with provolone cheese.

We had this for dinner last night. It was fantastic, the only change I made was to use cream of mushroom soup instead of chicken simply because I was out of chicken. This is a great easy dinner. My husband doesnt care for chickenand he really liked this. This is a keeper. I'm looking forwerd to making it again.

This dish is delicious! I cut up the chicken into large bite sized pieces, & added some frozen broccoli. I love the flavor of the swiss cheese. I tore it into peices & layered it on top of the chicken & broccoli. My fiance said this is one of his top 2 favorite dished I've ever made!

I made this for my husband, who was pleasantly surprised, not being a fan of baked chicken. However, by the end of the meal, we were both "stuffinged" out. Since we cut the recipe in half, I might have still used too much stuffing mix, but other than that, the chicken was moist, tender, and flavorful.

I took the advice of another reviewer and added more chesse. Ugh!! It was awful. Next time I'll just grate a little jack onto it. I also baked it uncovered and everyone liked the crunch. Will make again.

This was soooo good.  However, mine didnt look anything like the picture and everyting slid off the chicken while baking.  I added an extra slice of swiss to each breast when done.  It didnt look very appetizing, but it was very very good.  My husband even liked it and he doesnt care for chicken much.  This is a recipe you will not be disappointed with.  It will be a regular in our house.

Very Tasteful and easy.

I seasoned the chicken with creole seasoning, black pepper, garlic powder, and cayenne.

Also, I forgot to put the foil on top, which made the stuffing crunchy. I enjoyed the crunchy stuffing.

I made this as is, except I only had chicken & herb soup around.  Wanting to know if it would make any drastic difference in the taste, I tasted the soup first and it really wasn't very herby.  So I think just the cream of chicken would turn out about the same.    I was a bit leary about the stuffing getting done, but it did.  I did stir it once during baking but that was it.  I also did not slice up the chicken and it got done fine.  But it did take a bit over 50 minutes -- but perhaps this time is necessary for the stuffing to get done and is the way it's *supposed* to be.  I also don't get many of the comments about the stuffing -- "stuffing" mix should include the herbs, otherwise it's a bag of bread crumbs and not stuffing mix.  The brand of course will make a difference and I just used the Stove Top scoopable stuff.  I've made several chicken 'n stuffing type recipes from this site and this is one of the better ones I've had.  It would make a great easy stand-by recipe, except I don't have Swiss cheese around much.  Oh, I also used fat free Swiss, low-fat milk and low-fat margarine, and it was all fine, but I'm also used to doing that.  (The soup was *not* low-fat.)

Not sure what I did wrong because I don't see this problem reading other reviews, but everything just slid off the chicken during baking.  Even with spooning it back on when serving, we found the taste to just be so-so.  Sorry.

This was good, but not something I'd make over and over.  I might make this again, but on a night I need a quick meal I can just stick in the oven and forget about it.

My whole family loved this recipe.  The kids gobbled it up and said it was one of the best dinners we have had.  I substituted half and half for the water and made it in a 11 X 7 with chicken tenders.  I doubled the stuffing and butter drizzled on it.  It was perfect.

This recipe was pretty good.  I used "cream of chicken with herbs" and enjoyed the taste better than with plain "cream of chicken".  I used the other suggestions and used seasoned stuffing and added the butter to the stuffing before I put it on the chicken.  I would make this again.  It was very easy, especially as a week-night meal.  My husband loved it and he usually only likes his chicken fried.

This dish was FANTASTIC and my kids loved it.  I followed all of the instructions except instead of using regular chicken breasts, I used the thinly sliced chicken breast by Purdue and cooked for 30 minutes instead of 50. The chicken was tender and juicy.

This recipe is great.  I can't get my boyfriend to eat vegatables, so I add  celery and carrots to the chicken.  I also added white wine and less butter.  We both love this one.

This dish was very good, considering that it took me less than 10 minutes to put everything together.  The only changes made were that I rubbed down the chicken w/some sea salt and garlic pepper on each side, then I used Campbell's lowfat cream of chicken soup, and added a bit more milk in order for all the stuffing to be absorbed w/moisture.  I also used shredded swiss cheese, since that's what I had on hand.  I enjoyed it, as did my husband.

Terrible recipe! Super salty and the stuffing mix stayed dry on top of the chicken and turned into crispy crumbles. At the very least, put the stuffing underneath the chicken and use low-sodium soup. This version was really awful.

This was excellent!  I hesitated because of the stuffing, but, it melded perfectly with everything else.  The only changes I made was to add a little spicy mustard on all the pieces of chicken before the swiss went on and top the swiss covered chicken with an entire carton of sliced mushrooms.  Then I followed the directions from there.  Excellent!  Will definitely make again.

I have made this for years. If you have thick boneless chicken it does take longer than 50 minutes. I bake at 60 mins then uncovered for 20. I have used different cream of' soups and they all taste great'!

I thought this recipe turned out pretty good.  My husband and kids really enjoyed it.  I brushed the chicken with dijon mustard before I put the cream of chicken soup on.  Also I cooked the stuffing according to the package directions first and then put it on top of the chicken.  I found it more moist that way.

This was good.  The only thing I had trouble with was that the stuffing was crunchy.  Next time I might add more butter or mix the dry stuffing with a little bit of the soup mixture to make it more moist.  Great flavor though and VERY EASY.

After making this a few times, I found that adding a small can of green chiles to the soup mixture gives it the "something" that it needs.  It's also great served over pasta noodles.

This recipe is amazing.  This is the only recipe that my roommate will specifically ask for.  We make it a lot, so we mix it up a bit.  It tastes great with just about any cream soup (we've tried broccoli cheese, cream of mushroom, and cream of celery just to name a few).  We've also added mushrooms and broccoli, and even tried peas once.  Super recipe!!!!!

This was really easy to prepare and my whole family loved it.  I added frozen broccoli florets and sliced mushrooms.  They were a wonderful addition.  I sliced the chicken breasts about a 1/2 inch thick pieces and baked for 40 min.  I did not find this salty at all per other reviewers.  I used the Healthy request brand.

This recipe was fantastic and a 10 on the easy-scale.  

I made a couple of minor changes - cut the chicken up into big pieces so it would be a bit more like a casserole.  Used shredded swiss just because of personal preference.  Also used white wine instead of milk based on other reviews.  Wonderful recipe.

It's fantastic and easy.  I added a handful of dried cranberries for a bit of sweetness.  It's something I could make once a week and the fam would love it every time.  Also, it's easy to make the night before and just throw it in the oven the next day.

My kids even like this! I use cooking sherry instead of milk though..1/3 can (the soup can).  I also add water chestnuts to it. My 7 yr. old daughter loves water chestnuts so I thought it would appeal to her. I great pot luck pleaser too.

Good, but you definitely need a side with it.  Would be nice if you could add extra stuffing mix and some water and have enough for the whole meal in one dish.  Not sure if that would work, though.

Excellent, easy recipe.  Hubby likes spicier food, so I sprinkled chicken with Meat Magic (Prudhomme's) prior to assembling casserole.  I used all lower-salt ingredients.

This dish was very salty to me.  I think it might be because I used a herb flavored stuffing mix.  Be certain to buy, a plain, dry stuffing mix for the top.

This recipe rocks!

I've tried several from allrecipes.com, but this one was excellent. I used breast tenders, and an extra can of mushrooms as well. Also additional garlic powder and white pepper. Simply, taste and fast.

Delicious!  I only made one change.  I cut the chicken up into bite size  pieces before adding the rest of the ingredients.  It was so good.  Everyone in my family liked it. And it was very easy to put together. I will be making this again and again.

I made this over the weekend.  I knew I wouldn't like the swiss cheese and I didn't.  Next time I will leave it off.  The chicken was very tender.  Also very quick and easy...I will make this again!

I used 4 pieces of chicken instead of 6, seasoned it with garlic powder & essence, and used 2 pieces of swiss cheese on each chicken breast.  I also added a splash of white wine to the soup/milk mixture.  It came out great, our only complaint was that it's a little salty.  Next time I'll cut down on the garlic powder & add a little more milk to the soup mixture.  The stuffing (I used herb-flavored stuffing) really makes the whole dish.

Overall this was a good dish.  The toppings were a bit dry and it was a bit watery, prob due to the chicken.  I'll make this again and play around with it a bit.  =)

This is a different way to prepare chicken breasts, since we have them every week, and it way so fast and easy.  I used 8 pieces instead of 6 and I even left off the cheese because I don't usually don't buy it, and the recipe still came out great. (P.S. It was so easy, I put it in the oven and forgot about it!  I left it in 20 minutes too long and it was OK!)

Very good. Quick and easy. I needed to use up some left over boiled chicken that I removed from the bones and used in place of the chicken breasts. I also used stove top stuffing (I would suggest using only half the seasoning packet). It turned out delicious!

This was probably the easiest dinner I have made in a long time.  It tasted fantastic and I was done in 1 hour from start to finish.  My wife loved it and actually took a couple of left overs to her work and her friends have asked for the recipe.  Definitely in my "once a month" I'm going to have it list.

I have made a variation of this for years.  I cut the chicken breasts in half, cover completely with swiss cheese, mix 2 cans of cream soup with white wine (just enough to make it spreadable), and cover with plain stuffing mixed with panko.  I use cream of celery soup, as my family doesn't care for mushrooms and I don't do cream of chicken. 
The extra soup makes the topping more moist.

I added broccoli and cauliflower along with some hot sauce.  Turned out better than I thought.

I actually cut the chicken breasts into chunks and added a crispy topping of crushed Ritz crackers in a butter sauce. It came out great!

Wow, so good!  It was a hit at my house.  I did take some reviewers advice and added a bit of white wine to the sauce and I'm so glad I did.  Not a whole lot I would change on this recipe, but it lends itself well to tweaking.  Well done.

I make this dish at least once a month. The only thing I do differently is I melt the butter and mix the stuffing mix right into it. This way all the stuffing gets moist. I also cover with foil for 40 mins and then uncover for the last 10.

I have to admit that when I read putting bread on liquid I figured it be soggy. Well I was right. The flavor was ok. I even seasoned the chicken before I poured the soup over it. Some people commented it was too salty were wrong. I added more salt to the finished product. I will make again but with changes. I wouldn’t add the stuffing till the end of the backing time. I would add more seasoning to the chicken. Some committed on cutting the chicken into bit sized pieces. I think that would help to distribute the flavor. I will try again.

I will make this again! I used unsalted butter and next time will use low sodium soup.  I also cut my chicken breast in half lengthwise as they were rather large. 
     I have an extended family so this year I agreed to have our Thanksgiving dinner a week early to free up my kids time for the in-laws on the actual day. I think I will make this casserole instead of turkey since they will probably all be eating turkey later in the week. It also will free up my time with family as I can do it in advance. Winner, winner chicken dinner!

I only gave it a 4 as I am modifying...using yogurt / milk combo..adding thyme and rosemary. Instead of butter, I'm using Spanish EVOO ...this looks really good as a deviation from my normal sauteed floured chicken with guyere and mushrooms....this recipe, sadly...was a bust for me. It came out very bland.

I mixed one can of cream of chicken and one can cream of celery with skim milk.  I used provolone (I've used Swiss before wasn't as tasty). I also used chicken tenderloin (about 6-8).  Next time i may salt and pepper the tenderloins but no big deal if I don't.  I served it with green beans. Very easy (Week day dinner) and comforting meal.

I made a few adjustments based on the reviews.  I used Mozzarella cheese  instead of  Swiss.  I also reduced the milk and used white wine by a half and half measure with the milk ( 1/8 cup milk 1/8 cup wine),  and made sure I added no additional salt.  I seasoned the chicken with Mrs. Dash garlic and herb and I covered it with foil for the first 40 minutes, I also added some broccoli to the sauce nestled in the breast area.  I let it brown over the last 10 minutes and it turned out great.  It was a savory delight  perfect for a cold fall evening.

This dish is very easy  to make and so delicious.  I've made it several times and my husband loves it.  It's rich and creamy.  You can sprinkle all the spices that you love on the chicken to give it a great flavor. I used pepper, sage, onion powder, garlic powder, parsley, and some paprika.  I also used less of the dry bread stuffing instead of the whole package. Great easy recipe!

This was great as is. I used chicken flavored stove top. It turned out really well! I can see how others would say it is salty, because it is. I might use a low sodium stove top next time. Might also try the white wine as suggested by other reviewers.

Yum yum yum! This is an amazing recipe! I made it the first time, exactly as written. It was fabulous! The 2nd time I made it, I used cream of mushroom since I didn't have cream of chicken, it was fabulous as well!!! I prefer mushroom over the chicken but regardless, this recipe as written, definitely deserves 5 stars! Delish!

We really like this recipe. I made it different. I cut up the chicken and mixed it with the soup then toped with cheese. The next time I make this I will double or even triple the cheese. If you cut up your chicken shredded cheese works best .

I used wine white in place of the milk - added a lot to the taste. I had to make this gluten free, so in place of the cream of chicken soup, I heated 1 cup milk, 1 T butter, 2 T corn starch and 1 cube chicken bouillon in a saucepan until thickened. It didn't seem like enough sauce so I actually doubled it.  Also used chicken tenders and grated swiss because that's what I had on hand. Oh yeah, instead of putting the dry mix on top and pouring melted butter over it, I made the stuffing according to package directions (added hot water & butter) and layered that on top. Baked for 30 min covered, then 20 uncovered. Topped with freshly grated black pepper & served. It was fabulous!

I made this just as recipe suggests, with no changes, and it was fantastic. I can see adding sauteed onions and mushrooms, and/ or using cream of mushroom soup with some white wine, but base recipe is great as is. i used Pepperidge farm stuffing, not cubed. Great flavor.

11/2015 Jeff loved it! I used 6 slices of American cheese instead of Swiss per his request. I put the soup on first then the cheese by accident still turned out great. I mixed the butter and stuffing together before putting it on

I used chicken broth instead of milk. I figured it had enough dairy with the cheese. I used cornbread stuffing. We loved it.
I think this would also work with pork chops maybe sub. the soup for cr of mushroom.  I can see playing with this one! Thanks.

This recipe is my go-to recipe if we need something to quickly cook for dinner. It's super simple and delicious! The only thing I would change about it is that, in my experience, more butter has been needed. Would recommend!

Great recipe! I used provolone since my kids don't like Swiss, even my picky eater liked it! I also mixed the soup with white wine instead of milk. It was tasty! I will cut back on the butter next time, it seemed like too much.

I made this dish as is and WOW! Amazing for those cold nights when you want some comfort food. The leftovers are delicious as well! It is so quick and simple! I made some garlic mashed potatoes on the side and microwaved some frozen peas as well. This is going to be a staple on our dinner table from now on!

I loved this recipe I am not a fan of croutons so I used French fried onions and it still worked out.

The food did not look exactly like the photo but it still tasted good. It the future I would add more cream and less French fried onions.

This is such a easy dish to make. I didn't have the milk, cream of chicken, or bread crumbs,  so I substituted w/low sodium chicken broth and chicken flavored stove top stuffing. It was so delicious!! First I layed the breasts in the baking pan and sprinkled black pepper and Italian seasoning generously. Then I placed the Swiss cheese over each piece of chicken, sprinkled the uncooked stove top stuffing, then poured the chicken broth over. The chicken breasts came out really juicy and tasty!

I made this tonight for dinner with ingredients I had on hand and it turned out really well. Using provolone cheese instead of swiss and cream of mushroom roasted garlic rather than cream of chicken made for a really nice blend of flavors. I followed suggestions from other reviews to prepare the stuffing beforehand and  uncover for the last 15 minutes. It was good, but next time I think I'll just sprinkle the stuffing mix on top for a nice crunch. All in all it was really yummy!

We love this recipe!! I make it all the time with home made cream of chicken soup. I make extra trays of it and freeze it. The ones I freeze don't put the stuffing & butter on until I'm making it since it gets soggy in the freezer & we like it crispy.

This is absolutely the best recipe! My husband loves this dish, it never disappoints. I used the healthy request cream of chicken soup and only had Gouda cheese on hand and it turned out wonderful. Thank you for the great recipe!

I was glad I doubled the recipe. Everyone asked for seconds even my picky kids. I did have to leave it in the oven for 30 min more for the chicken to be cooked all the way.

Very yummy!  I mixed cream of chicken & cream of mushroom & included the advice from other reviews as far as adding a lil soup to the bottom,  cutting the chicken in cubes & cooking the stuffing first. I will definitely make this meal again!

I thought this turned out great!  My husband even ate some, and he is a picky eater.  The only change I would make in the future. is to combine the butter and stuffing mixture before putting onto the chicken and Swiss cheese.

My family makes a similar recipe all the time!  We use chicken breast tenders, rather than full breasts, which reduces the cooking time to 30 - 40 minutes.  Also, we eliminate the milk.  Finally, we order the ingredients differently - first, pour in the cream of chicken soup, place chicken on top, place pads of butter over the chicken, then layer on the swiss cheese over the entire dish and cover with stuffing.  By ordering the ingredients differently, the stuffing stays crunchy, which makes all the difference for us.  This is definitely a house favorite!

Thank YOU Melanie for this recipe We LOVE it for a few reasons.
1. It TASTES GREAT
2. Very EASY to make 
3. My husband has been working at Campbell Soup Company for 33 years and I have never seen this recipe before now. 
" I think this recipe should be printed on their can"
Thank YOU so MUCH!!!
We have tried it with Cream of Chicken and Cream of Mushroom both with rave reviews.

I used 3 Tbs of milk with 2 Tbs of vinegar to give it some more flavor. Instead of stuffing, I crushed up croutons. It was delicious !

This was just ok for us.  I was looking for a good chicken and stuffing casserole recipe and this one wasn't it.  The cheese was just too much, making the stuffing too heavy and gooey.  I even upped the liquid in the recipe too.

Very easy and super yummy! Love the swiss cheese. The only thing I changed was I used low sodium Corn bread stuffing and Heart Healthy cream of Celery. Wonderful flavor, will defiantly make again and again!

This was real good!! I used three chicken breast instead of six. A box of reduced sodium stovetop dressing, added some mushrooms and broccoli. Added wine to the soup & milk mixture. This was even better on the 2nd day! husband loved it! I will make again.

This was excellent and I have four children who are pretty picky eaters.  They all loved it. The chicken was fork tender and the stuffing, delicious. Each week I try to make a new recipe and we decide if the new recipe is a "keeper" or not.  This was thumbs up all the way around.  Thanks for submitting this recipe!

I made this for dinner last night and my family loved it. I diced the chicken and added broccoli, used cream of celery soup with 1/3 cup of milk, I also added just a pinch ofHerbs de Provence. I mixed 1/2 of the bread cubes with the soup mixture and the remaining bread cubes mixed with the butter in a pan. It was really good.

A co-worker made this for a group of us at a dinner party at her house in the early 1990s and we all loved it. She wrote the recipe down for me and I only made it twice over the years. I was looking for a non-boring chicken breast recipe and was wishing I could find this one in my box of loose recipes. It hit me to do a Google search for the ingredients to see if I could come up with the recipe, after a search on www.campbells.com was unsuccessful. The Google search led me to this recipe, which is exactly what she made/gave me all those years ago. Made it, as is, but baked it uncovered because I like the crunchy bits of the stuffing. Only tweaks I made was that I used semi-frozen chicken breasts that were rather thick...so, I carefully sliced them in half, which worked out perfectly. I was worried it would be dry, but it was still very moist. Next time I might pound them out if they are not frozen, as others have suggested. Thank you to the person who originally posted this recipe. Easy and delicious. How can you beat that?  One last note: I used a box of Trader Joe's Cornbread Stuffing Mix, without the herb packet. I will use the herb packet some other day on homemade bread cubes.

Casseroles-- what's not to love? You throw it all into one dish and it cooks itself. This is a good and easy recipe. It's not a razzle dazzler but it's a good weeknight meal for monthly rotation. I liked the use of the stuffing- I used cornbread- it adds flavor and it's different.

I make this recipe all the time with only one change in the ingredients and my family loves it! Try using 1/2 cup apple juice instead of milk. I use Simply Apple. Trust me - you will not be unhappy with the results! :)

This is one of my go-to "gift casseroles" for people who are sick, just had a baby, etc. It is really easy, freezes well, and is yummy comfort food. I add chopped broccoli.

My 11 year old who had claimed for days that she didn't like chicken casserole had two servings! I think the Swiss cheese is what set it apart from a normal chicken casserole. Will make again.

Great, easy dinner. My husband requested this because he loves stuffing (I used chicken Stove Top, his favorite). This was a cinch to put together and came out well; hubby raved about it. I personally found the chicken a bit bland (although the sauce/stuffing mixture was terrific) which is why I rated it 4 stars. I would actually like to make this again into more of a casserole with the chicken cut up and everything mixed together. I think that would make it 5 stars for me.

This is a super easy weeknight meal that packs alot of flavor and is easy on the pocketbook. I now buy boxes of stuffing when it is on sale in anticipation of making this meal. No need for a starch with the stuffing on top..serve with a veggie for a complete "Homestyle" family meal.

This was very good and very easy to make.  I did mix up the stuffing first, but I think that next time I will leave it dry because it got  little "mushy" in the oven.

This recipe made a perfectly moist chicken. I used Cream of Mushroom soup instead of Cream of Chicken soup. I added an extra 8-10 minutes for cooking time. The aluminum foil was removed for the last 10 minutes of cooking time to give the dish a nice golden finish. I will definitely make this dish again.

This was a great recipe! The only thing i did differently is cube the chicken, add garlic powder to the chicken, add mushrooms and used chicken stove top stuffing!! I made it for a family gathering and everyone asked for the recipe!!

This is absolutely amazing. I have made it on many occasions from big family dinners to quiet nights at home. It is always a huge hit and everyone always asks for the recipe. It's not the healthiest way to prepare chicken, but it's so tasty!

When I made this recipe I accidently used a can of cream of mushroom soup instead of chicken. Also I used low sodium stuffing, after reading a few people saying it was salty. And I loved it! Very tasty, I already bought the ingrediants to make it again!

Super easy and good and creamy. I made it with 4 breasts and smaller pan but kept the other ingr. the same. This made it creamy enough to have the sauce over the chicken and the stuffing.

I first made this recipe for a family who had just brought their baby home from the hospital. The grandma emailed me asking for the recipe because her husband had loved it.

Since then, I have made it for my family, and it was such a huge success that we are serving it at my brother's rehearsal dinner.

I particularly love it because it's quick, easy, relatively cheap, and you can interchange ingredients to suit your taste.

I made this recipe to take to a friend who was taking care of a sick loved one and didn't have time to cook for her family...it went over big!  Actually, I made two -- one for our family, too.  Very easy and tasty.  This would be a great recipe to throw together in the morning before you go to work and then throw in the oven when you get home.  Didn't change a thing.

added 1/2 frozen spinach to the bottom of the pan, and replaced the milk with white wine. you would think this recipe was much more difficult based on how delicious it tastes!

We enjoyed this recipe, although everything on top of the chicken fell off since the cheese melted.  I used corn flakes instead of stuffing becuase I didn't have any stuffing - my sister in law uses that instead because he husband and daughter have celiac, and it was good.  Next time I will try cubing the chicken, doubling the sauce, and adding broccoli, and use the cornflakes again.

This is definitely a comfort food recipe! I only used 2 chicken breasts since I only have my husband and I to cook for, cubed them, and followed other readers advice and doubled the soup portion.  I found that the stuffing was a bit dry on top, so toward the end of the cooking time, I mixed it up a bit with the extra soup and re-covered and baked it for a little longer.  I had planned to use frozen broccoli but forgot to and it was still delicious.

Definitely good!! I added some green beans to the cream of chicken soup mix. It was tasty!! Next time I think that I would add some onion for a little extra flavor.

This is a great recipe. We use stove top chicken stuffing and cube up the chicken to cut down the cooking time but this is a hit with my whole family.

I make something very similar. Instead of the milk, I add 1/4 c chicken broth to the soup and then pour over the chicken. It's always a hit! Wonderful recipe!

Very good for a quick dinner.  I added a package of frozen broccoli and some extra Swiss, as well as a little white wine in addition to the milk.  What are all these reviews about using "seasoned" stuffing mix?  As another reviewer said, if it's not seasoned, it's just breadcrumbs, and not stuffing mix at all.  I don't understand what others are talking about.  All in all a very good, very quick, easy meal.

Wow!  This is a terrific - and easy - recipe.  My kids love it; we never have leftovers!  

I do make a couple of changes (as suggested by others):  (1)  I add the butter to the stuffing first (altho I don't really know if its necessary), (2)  I add a small jar of pimentos, (3) I use 2 cans of soup:  1 cheddar and 1 cream of chicken - mixing them together with 1/2 cup of milk.

The great thing about this recipe is that its very easy to add/change ingredients to taste.  Next time, I'll try cooking it with rice in the casserole dish with the chicken.

Excellent and easy recipe! My family loves it. I sprinkle some chicken seasoning on the chicken before putting the swiss cheese on there, and sprinkle a little more on the stuffing before covering it with the foil. This goes EXCELLENT with baked sweet potatoes, salad, and croissant rolls.

I really like this recipe. I change it just a little bit, I took some advice from previous comments. I added another can of the chicken soup to the bottom of the pan and I added some salt, pepper and garlic salt to the soup and milk mixture. I also used corn bread stuffing. It was great, I only gave it 4 stars because my husband thought it was just "ok".

I personally used mozzerella cheese instead of swiss. I also took the advice of others and added some white wine to the sauce. I did, however, forget to slice the chicken before baking and it took a long time to cook thoroughly. If you have large pieces of chicken I recommend that you do cut them into smaller pieces so it will bake faster. Overall though, it was quite tasty and the family enjoyed it.

This dish was easy and tasted great.  I did modify the recipe slightly.  I used 1 can of soup on the bottom of the pan mixed with about 3/4 c milk and a 2nd can of soup mixed with about 3/4 c milk over the chicken.  Even my picky 3 year old ate this one.

I am in the minority on this one but my family did not like this. Teenagers and husband did not care for the taste. I was the only one that liked it so I would not make it again. It was so easy to put together that it would be worth a try.

We all loved this recipe.  It's a very easy way to make a good, filling home cooked meal.  I served it with canned corn and rolls.

Great recipe!  Only change I made was I also added a can of cream of mushroom soup and used a 1/2 cup of milk. VERY easy and my entire family loved this. Thank you for sharing.

Excellent!  I used three large chicken breast halves and cut them into halves again.  Perfect amount for the three of us and leftovers for lunch the next day!

I like this recipe a lot, I used other users advice and made it with 1/3 milk and 2/3 white wine in the soup can.  I also added mushrooms, and did it in layers. Yummy!

It doesn't get much easier or tastier than this!  I followed the recipe with no add-ins (although my chicken breasts only came in a 4-pack, I will probably double it next time so we have some leftovers).  I eyeballed all the ingredients, and used cream of chicken with herbs (couldn't find regular).  This was FANTASTIC.  Added a side vegetable and it was a meal that took about 6 minutes to throw together and another 45 to cook...chicken came out tender and perfect.  This is great on a busy weeknight (I think I'll make it again on 'Lost Premier Night' so I spend next to no time in the kitchen, and very little doing the cleanup.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

Absolutely delicious!  The chicken was so tender!  I followed some advice from other reviewers and added sherry which gave it a great flavor and served it over egg noodles.  Tasted just as good the next day!  Definitely will be making this again for the family.  Thanks!

This was okay, another way to have chicken on the menu. But you almost get tired of eating it after half a serving. 
My husband would have rated it higher. And the children ate the chicken, not the stuffing. It just didn't look to appealing. Thanks anyway.

I guess I'm the odd man out here, but I thought this was awful!  The stuffing mixed with the cream of chicken soup was good, which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of only one, but the chicken tasted terrible!

This is an awesome dish. So easy and so tasty - although i usually add about 1/2 cup dry white wine to the mix before baking and it gives it a little kick:)

This recipe was good after I made some of the changes that previous reviews suggested. I would use less butter next time. My dish came out a little greasy. This a great base recipe to create and add your own special touch.

I was being lazy, so I held off on going to the grocery store for as many days possible and made do with what we had in the house.  Not a good idea. . .  This was just fair.  It had a very "pre-packaged" taste.  I really doubt I'll make this again.

So easy and delicious.  Great for when you don't want to spend a lot of time in the kitchen but still want something really yummy.  The first time I made it, I followed the recipe.  Second time, I added mushrooms under the swiss cheese and used cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken.

Pretty Good. Will try to use something other than the condensed chicken soup next time.  We thought it needed more Swiss Cheese.  Overall, a nice dinner even better leftovers.

Our whole family enjoys this casserole.  I even served it for Christmas dinner since it was so easy -- made my day much more enjoyable not to prepare a complex meal.

This is some good comfort food. My husband doesn't care too much for stuffing but he still ate it. I think it's good and it's very quick and easy- a no brainer!

Yumm!  Made this for dinner tonight and it was a hit!  When preparing, I acidentally opened a can of cream of mushroom (instead of chicken) soup and so I used that with a can of mushrooms too!  Was very tasty and will definately make this again.

Very good!  Before I knew it, my hubbie had cleaned his plate.  Slightly saltly, but enjoyable.  I added two extra pieces of cheese so it would cover the dish instead of just the chicken.
