I'm not really sure what I did wrong here. The flavor was good and it is definitely an easy mousse recipe, well if it works out its easy. When I added the chocolate pudding, it hardened the minute I added it into the cream. When I tried to mix it in as gently as I could it thickened up way to quickly and ended up looking a mess and not all of the pudding mixed in so it left little specks of dry pudding mix. I whipped some extra cream and folded that in to try and lighten it up. Could have been my pudding, maybe it was old or something? The flavor was nice but the texture was just off. I think it would be better to mix 1/2 cup of the cream with the pudding and whisk that together before trying to add it into the slightly thickened cream. Served it with sliced bananas and whipped cream on top. The family liked it.
