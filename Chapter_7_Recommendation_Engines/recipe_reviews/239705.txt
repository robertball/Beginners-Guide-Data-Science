This is NOT supposed to be "Hungarian" Goulash! It is an Americanized version as plainly stated in the recipe description.It is also the way I make mine, and it is very good! There are plenty of recipes on here for Hungarian Goulash if that is what you want. Sue...please don't review a recipe unless you have made it and tried it. If you have not done so, then your review is meaningless.

For my family, goulash has to have diced tomatoes and celery, with a squirt of yellow mustard and a little sugar to cut the acidity of the tomatoes, in addition to the ingredients listed here. Cut back on the paprika too. 3 TBS is a bit much. 1 - 2 TBS is better. Use 2 (15 oz) cans diced tomatoes and 1 (15 oz) can tomato sauce vs the 2 cans tomato sauce and 1 can tomato paste. The goulash will thicken once you add the macaroni. Add a TBS of yellow mustard to the hamburger while browning and a TBS of white sugar after you add the tomatoes.

My mom used to make it just like this and it was delicious and it's how I make it too. (although mine isn't as good, guess mine is missing the love momma put into it)  My dad used to say it wasn't goulash but "slumgullion".  Personally, I don't care what it's called, but if you make it, please call me to come over for supper!

This is a wonderful country goulash! I did add a can of diced tomatoes instead of two cans of tomato sauce. I wish I would have used a little less paprika, next time I plan on doing the same except seasoning to my liking at the end. We all have different tastes but I do think the paprika overwhelmed the wonderful meat. I will be making again, my whole family loves it!

I made this for dinner tonight, and the only thing I did differently was cut the recipe in half and used 2 teaspoons of paprika. It was very good and we will have it again. It was sort of like those one dish boxed meals with better ingredients. Quick, easy, one pan. Added a salad and dinner was ready in 40 minutes.  ~Colleen

This is ultimate comfort food in my family! My mom made it for us, and now I make it for my kids. 
In my family, we leave out paprika and use Louisiana style hot sauce to taste (we each add it at the table). I personally like to use V-8, stewed tomatoes and tomato sauce. 
Shredded cheese is also often added at my house!
And medium shells are there pasta of choice here. 
Honestly, I don't feel like there is a wrong way to make this!

I absolutely love goulash.  And I love trying all the different recipes for it.  This recipe is very good.  At least try it before judging it.  My husband isn't too keen on paprika, so I just used a little chilli powder instead.  Was not, by no means, trying to change up the recipe.  The recipe is fantastic.  Try it.  You'll love it.

This is a comfort food staple in my home. Everyone loves it. The only addition I make is to throw in frozen veggies, this last time I did frozen peas, corn and green beans. Yum!

I halved this recipe using one 15oz can of diced tomatoes and 6 oz tomatoe paste. Added some yellow mustard and 1 table spoon Paprika. It is definitely not bland. I put 2 teaspoons of beef better than bouillon in 2 cups of hot water before I added fresh noodles. I also browned the hamburger with celery, green pepper and onion. lots of flavor.

I used half the ground beef. The paprika put this over the top! I used 2 T of paprika.  I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes and 1 can of tomato sauce. I used 3 or 4 T of Kikoman. Also replaced water with beef broth. It did not need extra salt. I put a bay leaf in and let the mixture simmer for 30 minutes. The rest of the recipe remained the same. I used the garlic and pepper. Oh... I also added 1 t of sugar. Then added the macaroni. I topped it with a dollop of sour cream. Best goulash ever!

Really good recipe! Based on a few suggestions used 1 can each tomato sauce and diced tomatoes, 8 oz. sliced portobello mushrooms and added about 1/2 cup sour cream and chopped parsley at the end. Only used 1.5 pounds of ground beef and 2 tablespoons smoked Hungarian paprika and cooked in my Dutch oven. Big hit and will make again!

The flavor was pretty one-dimentionally overpowered with paprika. I wish I would have added to taste to I could still enjoy the paprika and taste the meat, onions, so forth.

I used the directions as a guide;  my modifications - half sweet Italian sausage and half ground beef with onion and garlic.  the seasonings I used:  1 1/2 teaspoons of paprika, Gourmet burger seasoning and six pepper seasoning blend. I had a 23 Oz jar of sweet pepper pepper and Portobello spaghetti sauce which I used in combination with the remainder of a tube of tomato paste maybe 2 or 3 oz. next I added a 16 oz bag of macaroni and a 32 oz box of beef. it was absolutely delicious!

Cut way back on paprika and I felt still too much. Also added celery and corn. Hubby loved it; me not so much. I only used one pound of hamburger. Makes a big batch.

We substituted a can of diced tomatoes for one of the cans of tomato sauce, added a diced green pepper, and used a whole 1-lb box of large macaroni. It's so amazing and I can't wait to have the leftovers because I know they'll be even better!

My husband loves this dish. I like that it's simple and one pot, and easy to customize/alter if I don't have all the listed ingredients on hand. But made just as written was fantastic.

I made alot of additions--green pepper, celery, mushrooms, 2 cans diced tomatoes instead of tomato paste, half the amount of paprika, chicken broth instead of water---but the basic recipe is a fine start. AND this is great left over, flavors really come out. Especially liked not having to cook the pasta seperately, and this method was perfect for the consistancy of the dish.

This was ok. It was very bland. I don't know enough about spices to be able to figure out what would make this taste better, but as it it's edible, but has potential.

Was very good but very thick-like chili-not sure if it’s suppposed to be that way? Had to add additional water while the pasta was cooking but other than that, didn’t change the recipe-oh, except also added shredded cheese at the end.

So because of some dietary choices, I used fresh tomatoes and just one 8 oz tomato sauce for the tomato “stuff.” I also only used half a TSB of paprika. I added a bay leaf for the last part of the cooking. It was VERY flavorful. My guys are happy and I will make this again!

This is by far my favorite goulash recipe that I have tried... except I leave out the basil leaves, it has an aftertaste we don't like :)

I made no substitutions and it was delicious. I did add quite a bit of water after the noodles were added. The portions were generous and I even had some left over to freeze. I will be making this again.

Minor changes. I added green pepper. I halved the recipe. Finally I added hot pepper flakes.

I found it was a touch bland. Not sure I’ll be adding this to my favorite meals. It was a easy meal, but nothing special.

This was very good!  I am rating it as a 5 since I did tweak  it just a little. I did as another reviewer and only used about 3/4 lb of hamburger. I added a green pepper in place of it. I also used a can of diced tomatoes in place of one of the cans of tomato sauce. We topped with shredded cheese and a little sour cream. Will definitely be making again.

I made this tonight but did a little change.  Added 2 tablespoons of sugar to cut down the acid bite of the tomatoes, added bay leaves and lessened the paprika to 2 tablespoons.  My husband loved it.

I made it as is and found it very overpowering with paprika. I should have read previous reviews where this was modified. My husband enjoyed it but unfortunately I found it inedible, even after adding mozzarella cheese & sour cream.
