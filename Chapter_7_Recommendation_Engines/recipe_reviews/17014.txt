THIS WAS FANTASTIC! I made it with fat free coolwhip and sugar free pudding and it was great.

This pie was easy to make and a big hit with my family.  I recommend adding chopped peanut butter cups to the whipped topping.

I used an Oreo cookie crumb crust. Followed the rest of the recipe and it was ok. If I make it again I will use chocolate ganache instead of the chocolate pudding.

Well, I did adjust this just a little. Instead of using a plain old pie crust, I used a basic peanut butter cookie recipe and used it as a crust. I baked the crust in a 9 x 9" glass dish. Then poured in the pudding mixes. I also added some peanut butter to the chocolate batter and then swirled the two together to make a marble like topping. Then I sprinkled the top with crushed peanuts. Mine came out a bit watery, so I put it in the freezer for a couple hours. Wow! It came out like an amazing ice cream cake. I think next time though, if I want to make it w/o freezing it, I would simply stir in a pack of plain gelatin. I skipped the whipped topping.

This didn't do it for me at all. I absolutely LOVE peanut butter & chocolate, but this was too much peanut butter (which I never thought would be possible.)  I used only about 1 cup of chunky peanut butter and it made the vanilla pudding way too thick and dense in the pie.  I absolutely must have done something wrong but for the life of me I can't figure out what it is...
