Absolutely delicious.  I couldn't stop eating it!  The only change I made was apple cider vinegar instead of lemon because I didn't have lemons at the time.  So good.  This is a keeper!!!  Not a dessert; perfect as a side dish.

I prepared this recipe exactly as written. It looked and smelled wonderful. But both my husband and I did not care for it.

I wasn't sure if this recipe was a side dish or a dessert...now that I've made it, I'll call it an elegant side dish!  It is definitely worth the time it requires to make it...slightly sweet, but savory enough...it would be wonderful for Thanksgiving fare.  Will save this one and use often!

This is such a special recipe. It turned out great and looked beautiful. I found it because i had some coconut flour to use up. It takes a lot of time to make and mine should have cooked longer. I took it out after 45 minutes even though the center looked jiggly because everyone was waiting for it. I think it needed the 60 minutes. It has a sweet taste without a lot of sugar. I will defiantly make this one again and try it with sweet potatoes.

we did not enjoy this. my souffle turned out but it was too off for us, and we eat healthy food. this recipe was basically a pumpkin pie without any sweetener. we will not be making this again.

I have made this wonderful side many times with multiple variations.  Making it tonight with added spiral cut zucchini.  I would suggest tenting with foil for at least the first half hour in the oven to prevent overbrowning.  Enjoy!

This was delightful!  The aroma while baking was driving me crazy!    Airy and light., delicious.  It needed the entire 60 minutes to be thoroughly done.   Recipe was perfect..  Served with roasted chicken and jasmine rice.  

Thank you for sharing this!

Initially thought this was a bit bland, but then as leftovers found I ate every last bit, so guess I liked it more than I thought I did.  Made it for a Paleo food swap (gym food challenge) and it got rave reviews from everyone else.

I hate to be a party pooper since everyone else liked it so much, but I only thought it was so so. I'll probably never make this again because I have another carrot souffl√© recipe that I like much better than this one.
