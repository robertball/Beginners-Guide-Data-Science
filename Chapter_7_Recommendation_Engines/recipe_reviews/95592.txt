This was great!  My boyfriend loved it.  I used panko breadcrumbs, then added Italian type herbs to them.  (Basil, parsley, oregano, etc.)  This is a definite keeper!

I followed this recipe exactly and used regular (unseasoned) breadcrumbs.  The chicken lacked flavor.  Next time I will use seasoned breadcrumbs or add more seasonings to the regular breadcrumbs.

I love this recipe!  It was so, so, so easy!  The results were a delicious meal that you would think someone spent hours on.  The only change we made was putting Italian Seasoning in the bread crumbs instead of just dried basil.  We will DEFINITELY make this again.

Very easy and very tasty! I added a pinch of oregano to the bread crumb mix in mine. Everyone was getting seconds and thirds. Definitely a hit!

This recipe is great!!  I followed the instructions exactly, and it was perfect.  Only one thing I almost messed up, so I would suggest that you be sure to keep an eye on the chicken while it is frying in the pan because I fried for 5-6 minutes without really checking it and almost burned one before I realized it.  I will definitely make this one again!  It was delicious!!

This was soooo yummy. I just undercooked the pasta slightly, topped with sauce then baked as directed. Oh, and I used a blend of shredded italian cheeses. Everyone loved it, and for my nieces and nephews, that's saying a lot!!

I was very easy to make, but I just did not think it had alot of flavor.  I think I will add more seasonings next time.  My son liked it but it was just so-so for my husband and I

My family loved the chicken and said it was resturant quality. I did use seasonsed breadcrumbs. That always helps, along with extra cheese!

Excellent recipe and didn't change a thing except did use italian bread crumbs. Very user friendly and prep time was kept to a minimum. My kids absolutely loved this dish and asked for seconds!  Thanks for the recipe Pam!

Absolutely wonderful! My husband loved it! Followed the recipe, except I was out of basil. And, i used 1/4 of a pkg of McCormick's chicken Scallopine seasoning in my bread crumbs. We will definitely have this often.

Loved this recipe, like another member suggested, I used Panko crumbs. Also my boyfriend if allergic to marinara sauce. So instead i warmed some garlic in olive oil, and then lightly sauteed fresh tomatoes, and sprinkled a tiny bit of sugar, which cuts the acidity of the tomatoes.And used that instead of the marinara sauce. My bf and i loved it!

This was so easy and turned out wonderful!  I used fresh bread crumbs (buns grated in my food chopper) and seasoned w/ basil, garlic, salt & pepper.  I also made my own marinara sauce, which makes this much better homemade.  Will definitely keep this one, thank you!

I just made this last night for dinner and it was fabulous. I just used more olive oil, because the way my pan is, and used italian bread crumbs. This was a big hit in my family. I just served it with spaggetti and some italian bread. Very filling and very Easy to make. Definetly a keeper!

This was a very good meal, but it wasn't easy.  Well, if "easy" means "quick," that is.

My man loved it. The recipe was very easy and it looked great. Leftovers were good too. We like a little more sauce with our pasta so I added a whole jar of sauce...

This recipe is a definite winner!  I hadn't made chicken parm before, but this recipe looked easy and it really was.  It was delicious!  I used italian seasoned bread crumbs and shredded parmesan instead of the stuff in the green jar.  My family loved it and it is definitely going to be a regular for us.  I would highly recommend this recipe if you're trying this dish for the first time.  Yummy!!
