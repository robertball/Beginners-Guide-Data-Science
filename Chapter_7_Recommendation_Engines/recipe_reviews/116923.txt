SO SO good!! Here are the changes I made:
Fried up 3 pieces of bacon with lots of onion and garlic and celery. (1C onion, 3 large garlic cloves, minced, and one large celery stalk). Added the chicken broth after the onions were transluscent and the bacon was cooked. I cut the bacon up into small pieces and put it back into the pan. Added 8 smallish potatoes, cubed, with the skin on (healthier that way). Two carrots. 1C. frozen peas, 1C frozen sweet corn. 

For the milk mixture, I used 1/2 c. of half and half, and the rest whole milk. I added 1C. sharp cheddar AND 5 slices of baby swiss cheese from the deli.

For spices, I added salt and pepper and chicken spices, (rosemary, thyme, etc.) I added quite a bit of spice, and kept trying it till it tasted right.

Ate it with bread bowls.

SO good. Couldn't stop saying "mmmm!" when we were eating it.

This is a very good and easy potato soup recipe.  I did not have any Swiss cheese on hand so I substituted sharp cheddar and it was still very good.  I am looking forward to trying it with the Swiss.  My 4 year old daughter and husband loved this soup also!

Fabulous!  I doubled the recipe so we could have it all week.  I didn't have swiss but I did have sharp and med cheddar cheese.  I  added a few more of the veggies.  This was so easy.

Great flavor, texture and thickness.  
A cheater shortcut: use frozen hashbrowns instead of potatoes.

I tried this one out several weeks ago. very delicious, warm, comfort food. I didn't add any cheese. I felt that cheese of any kind would ruin it. I guess you could put cheese on the side and let people add it if they want. My only alteration to this recipe was to use half & half in place of milk and I added more veggies! I'm making this tonight!!!

This is a wonderful soup! I made it while snowed in during a blizzard - perfect warm comfort food! The few changes I made were: Chicken boulion cubes to make broth, I did not have celery on hand so I used celery seed, dried parsley instead of fresh and omitted the swiss cheese and used lots of fresh cracked pepper. The color and texture were wonderful! The color from the chicken boulion cubes made the color great.

Simple & yummy - this is a keeper. My husband loves soups and now this is his favorite. I did stir in 1/2 clove of garlic as mentioned by earlier reviewer, it gave that cannot-wait-to-eat-this aroma. Will put in sweet corn next time (I didn't have any at the time). Thank you for the recipe.

This soup is delicious! My 6 year old daughter commented that "this was the best dinner EVER" (and thats not easy to get out of her!) 

I did add 1 clove of pressed garlic to the milk mixture while it was thickening. Gave it a nice depth of flavor!!! YUMMY! Will be making this frequently.

Great recipe, a couple of tweaks:

Added 1 tsp. of mushroom bouillion when prepping the base, and 4-5 chopped 'shrooms with the veggies, and about 6 strips of crumbled bacon at the end.

Like another reviewer, didn't have any Swiss around, so subbed a med-sharp cheddar, worked fine. Do want to try it with Swiss, tho.

Really easy to prep, good and thick and hearty, nice flavors.  Thanks.

Awesome soup. You can see in my photo, I added a dried tomato garnish. Gave it an extra flavor I like. I also included a sweet potato I needed to use, but I added it once the rest was boiling so the texture remained. Amazing flavor. Totally 5 stars.

Easy to make! For mine I cooked up half a pound of breakfast sausage with the onions and I also made a batch of drop dumplings to go in it. Superb! Hint: For an even creamier texture, mash the potatoes a bit before you put in the gravy mixture! Fantastic and will use again!

The taste is good, however, we all really need to be realistic on how long it takes to prepare a recipe.  By the time I cut everything up, and cooked it, etc. it was way closer to an hour and a half than the "5 minutes" prep and 25 minute cook time. I'm actually fairly efficient in the kitchen, but come on -- just looking at the recipe, and the amount of ingredients one has to cut, chop, measure and peel, there is NO WAY ITS FIVE MINUTES OF PREP.

We are huge fans of potato soup, and I have tried many of the potato soup recipes on this site.  We really enjoyed this one, but I did make a few changes.  I decreased the onion to about 1/4 cup and omitted the celery.  I also used shredded cheddar cheese instead of Swiss and added in a can of corn.  The kids loved this and it was perfect with a side of cheddar garlic biscuits.

Excellent even without the cheese. I had cheese but forgot to add it. I didn't have celery but I added some celery seeds and that worked perfectly too add that celery flavor to the soup. I used skim milk and it was perfect. Thanks!

I didn't alter the recipe but had add a little more broth to cover the potatoes, didn't have any celery so I had to substitute w/celery salt and used cheddar since I didn't have Swiss cheese.

I had to change the recipe up just a little bit because I didn't have Swiss cheese so I just used cheddar. I also added peas and carrot mixture. I made this using my crockpot so I doubled the recipe except for the amount of milk. I had to add more flour to make it thicker. Overall I really did enjoy and will make again. I will try swiss cheese next time.

I followed the suggestion of adding in more garlic and cooking up the onion and garlic before adding the rest of the veggies with broth.  I'm a vegetarian so I used a veggie broth and added Morningstar Bacon as a last step.    In the future I'd like to substitute the recipe with a little bit of dill instead of parsley and see how that turns out.  My 19 month old son and husband just loved this stick to your ribs soup!

This is a great recipe. I did one cup of onion, one cup of celery, three large voices of garlic - sauteed prior to adding taters and veg broth. I also did two tablespoons of whole wheat flour in a tablespoon of butter. I added three tablespoons of fresh choppeddill and a few generous shakes of paprika and vegeta. A spoonful of sour cream in the bowl finished it.

This was one of the best soups I have ever made! I did make some changes. I added 2 pieces of American cheese, seasoned with onion powder, nutmeg, celery salt, fresh chives, and garlic (3 cloves) and used half-and-half and skim milk. I made two batches of the cream and cheese mixture to make the soup extra thick. I also used baby redskins (yellow flesh) and russet potatoes. Excellent, will make again!

I just made this recipe and it was great.  The additional vegetables allowed for extra nutrition and flavor.  We live somewhere where we don't have easy access to bacon or swiss cheese; the recipe still worked well.  I added a few extra spices to help make up the flavor difference.

This soup turned out AMAZING the first time I made it - I will definitely be making this more often!  I highly recommend this!  I did not even have to add cheese at the end because it was extremely tasteful and was thick enough without!  (If you are looking for a healthier option;)

My husband and I love this soup! I've made it now over a dozen times, and each time it gets better. Here are a few more ingredients I have added:

1 turnip
2 tsp dill
1 tsp season salt
1 whole bay leaf (dry or fresh)
1 whole mint leaf (fresh)
1/2 heavy cream (pref. 40%)

I love playing w/ recipes and this was has proven to be fantastic!

This was sooooo good my husband and 1 1/2 year old loved it too.  I added some bacon and 4 slices of pepper jack cheese and 4 cloves of garlic, but I cant make anything exactly to the recipe, I always have to change stuff up a little!  This one will get made often!  so creamy and good!  I served it in bread bowls from the italian bread bowls recipe on allrecipes.  They went together very well!

Pretty good base recipe.  I mashed my vegetables after cooking, added ham, substituted seafood magic for the salt and pepper and smoked gouda for the cheedar cheese.  Good with these changes.

I used turkey bacon and fat free half and half and we found the soup to still be rich and creamy.  We have fixed this soup several times now.

This was so good and tasty had to make a few adjustments but turned out wonderful. Add minced garlic, bacon and used cheddar cheese instead of swiss. I also doubled the recipe to have left overs. I will make this from now on!

This is SO SO good and thick and creamy! I added a clove of garlic and used Gouda instead of Swiss, because I lovvvvvve Gouda . Didn't change anything else but sauteed the onion, garlic and celery until tender in a tbsp of oil before adding the broth and potatoes. But that's just because it's how I start all my soups. This one is a HUGE hit and a definite keeper. Easy too!

VERY good. As I try to always do, I followed the recipe exactly the first time. Next time I will add large sliced fresh mushrooms (8oz) and either cubed ham, chopped crispy bacon, or crispy chopped pancetta ...and it needed a little more ZING for me so I will add hot paprika. But a good foundation.

I added broccoli, used pepperjack cheese instead of swiss, and also added rosemary, thyme and garlic.  I used one cup of heavy cream (just because I needed to get rid of it) and one cup of skim milk.  Not sure if that made any difference, but it was still very good.

Just made this for my husband who is sick with a bug.  It was awesome!  Ran out of milk, so i substituted last half cup with heavy cream.  Also used cheddar cheese instead bc I did not have swiss.  Great recipe!  Thanks.

Excellent soup!  I love potato soup and I think this is the best.  Since my family likes chunky but I like smooth potato soup I did a in-between thing and I half way mashed the potatoes right before I served it.
So it had a smooth texture but you still got a few chuncks. It came out great. This one is in my recipe box for good.

LOVED this soup!  I used vegetable broth and cheddar because that is what I had on hand.  This was so easy and delicious!  Husband said:  "This is a keeper!"  Thanks for a great winter warmer!  FIVE STARS!

My boys were sure I could not sneak them a meatless meal without them noticing, and this is the recipe that won me the bet! Perfect for a cold winter day and doesn't need tweaking like so many other recipes (tho I used veggie broth, hey I had to win!). I think this would also be perfect to modify, make your own masterpiece!

Has never made a soup from scratch before and I will say this was a great 1st experience! I would say people who like flavor (me) will definately need to add quite a bit of salt, pepper and some garlic at the end, but that's no big deal. I added more celery and onion to increase the flavor as well. But cooking times were spot on. The base was creamy, not milky and it all was very easy to make! Delious result.

This soup was delicious!  My grandmother used to make potato soup just like this and I devoured it, now that I'm older, this makes a great soup for a cold winter night for my husband and I.  
  I added some extra flavor to the soup by adding an extra chicken bullion cube, subbed 1 1/2 C cheddar cheese (like grandma used to use) for the Swiss, garlic powder and some Italian seasoning to make it just a bit more savory.  All and all this WILL be my go-to potato soup recipe

this was the right taste I was looking for.I used chicken boullion,and instead of mashing potatoes I use potato flakes to thicken and give potato flavor leaving the chucky that I wanted to have. Very good thank you

Excellent soup, just what the doctor ordered when my wife was feeling under the weather! Followed the recipe except no celery on hand so used a good amount of celery salt, added dried basil and chives for flavor along with diced ham. Nice creamy texture! As a few reviews suggested using cheddar and not having swiss, I used Co-Jack which worked very well. Ham used was sandwich ham, this will be great for leftover Easter or Christmas ham! Might add bacon next time as well.

Absolutely delicious! I'm a vegetarian, used soy milk instead of milk and organic vegetable broth instead of chicken broth. Also added a shallot, an extra carrot, and 3 cloves of garlic, fresh cilantro instead of parsley. The soup is thick and creamy, very filling! I'm sure will be a favorite soup in our house. Thank You!

Great dish, especially good in crockpot.  I simmered the bacon, garlic, onions, and celery on stovetop with about a tbsp or two of olive oil first.  put rest of veggies and ingredients in the crockpot. (minus potatoes and flour.)  
simmered onions, celery, bacon and garlic until onions were transparent then added that to the crockpot.  Cooked all day then an hour before eating added brown rice (instant) and swiss cheese.  I probably added about three cups swiss cheese instead of one.  We really love cheese in our family!  it was absolutely delicious.  My six year old and my husband loved it.  And they are really hard to please!

This is a very delicious soup.  It reminds me of the Sommaborscht that my mom makes.  I added a bit of garlic to the milk and also added Dill but I left out the celery.  I also put farmer(pork) sausage i the soup at the same time as the veggies.

The family liked this very much.  Had to use cheddar, because it's what I had.  Doubled the recipe, but had to add more broth to cover the veggies.

This recipe was AWESOME!!! However, I did not include any swiss cheese. My family LOVEDthe soup. Very hearty on a cold day, and does not take long to make!   I will be making it again in the near future.

This soup was a great change to the plain potato soup I'm used to.  I usually don't like potato soup because most recipes are so bland.  This recipe added flavor so our whole family can enjoy it!  I did add bacon and use some half and half with the milk and a little garlic too. Very yummy!

This was a huge hit at our house. It didn't last for leftovers! Easy to make and really good! My only tip would be to make sure to keep a CLOSE eye on the cheese/milk mixture as it never really boils but gets foamy on top. I made the mistake of not realizing that was what I was looking for and it went up and over the sides of my pan in the blink of an eye! Even cleaning up my stove was worth it! This soup is WONDERFUL!

This soup is AMAZING.    I've made it twice- the first time I had to use onion soup mix/water instead of broth (had no broth).  Obviously it was a more genuine flavor the second time, but even with the onion soup substitution it was still very good.    The second time I had no carrots/celery so I used some frozen broccoli.   Both times I used different cheeses- cheddar, cojack and/or mozzarella- depending on what I had on hand.  All that to say this recipe is EXCELLENT and easily adaptable.  It is also fairly quick and easy to make as long as you know how to make a good roux of course. (I also have a hand blender making it especially simple to mash up...and I do only mash about half of it.)  This recipe immediately became a favorite and has a permanent place in my recipe box...er...software.  lol  Thanks for sharing Stephanie!!!

This was so good.  I used chedder cheese since I didn't have swiss cheese.  I also added way more broth than the required amount. It tasted just like a soap I had at a tea shop once. I will be making this again.  Everyone enjoyed it.

Delicious! Where the recipe says to "lightly mash", I used a hand-held mixer instead; I guess I didn't want it to be quite so chunky. Also, I used water instead of chicken broth, and mozzarella instead of swiss. We grated some parmesan on the top at the table, too! Creamy and flavorful, with some great texture too!

Very tasty and filling, but needs more zing.  Added sharp cheddar cheese and lots of garlic, which helped.  Also added corn to make it a complete meal.

Wow.  A really easy recipe.  It's a very pretty and tasty outcome.  I didn't have swiss, so used cheddar. Next time we'll try the swiss:  Bet it's great.  UPDATE:  Yup, the swiss rocks....my favorite potato soup recipe.

This is a great recipe! I used red potatoes, left out the onion and celery, and I added some onion powder. Also, I did not have fresh parsley so I used some dried and added dill weed and cayenne. I used swiss cheese, but substituted some with cheddar. This would be great with bacon on top. Thank you for this recipe!

This soup is outstanding.  All of my potato soup recipes are built around ham or applewood bacon, so when my Dad kept asking for potato soup without meat, I was stumped.  I tried this recipe, and it is so much better than my fancier recipes, I have pretty much replaced them in favor of making this one, and I have made it again and again and again.  It is rich and creamy.  I use half and half instead of milk, and I don't bother with parsley because I am not a fan.

I used red potatoes because they were all I had. Had to cook them longer to get them tender. This was very good soup. Like mama used to make!

One night I forgot to thaw out dinner and ran across this gem. I don't buy chicken broth so I added 3 cups of water and simmered it longer. I also used half and half and the end of any cheeses I had which were havarti, cheddar and mozzarella. Excellent basic recipe with room to substitute.

I LOVE this recipe! It was exactly what I was looking for. The only changes that I made were: I wanted more vegetables, so I chopped up five long carrots, five celery stalks, and four large potatoes. Because of this I doubled the amount of chicken stock to three cups. I used the same amount of the butter/flour/milk concoction and the soup still turned out great. I used mild chedder cheese instead of swiss because I didn't have any swiss. Next time I plan on adding even more vegetables, mainly corn, green beans, caulifour, etc.

The best potato soup I ever had. Simple but great. I didn't use cheese. Thank you for the recipe.

Delicious! I used a little more potato and a sprinkle of celery seed instead of celery (husband hates it). I also used 2% milk and fat free half and half instead of all milk.  Go with a 50/50 there or the half and half makes it too thick (per the teenager). Dried parsley and cheddar is what I had on hand. Truly delicious. Definitely serve a bread. I used popovers.

This soup was delicious! I omitted onions due to allergies. I added 4 slices of chopped, cooked bacon for extra flavor but didn't need to. I added this to my recipe box permanently!

I made this potato soup tonight, the only thing I changed were a few ingredients that I didn't have at the house. Instead of parsley I used Italian Seasoning and I substituted in mozzarella cheese. I also had no celery. Recipe still turned out good.

Everyone loved it. The addition of bacon and galic made it even better. (cause you can't go wrong with bacon.)Try this one, the swiss cheese gave it "somethin' special". You won't be disappointed. But you will make a mess..have fun.

My husband's favorite kind of soup is potato. He said this was delicious! He asked me to make it again. I loved it! I added leaks and crumbled some crisp bacon in it. I also added lots of granulated onion because I didn't have any fresh onion. I omitted the carrots and celery only because I didn't have it. The Swiss is so good in it. Cheddar would be good too!

YUMMMMMMMMMMMMM!!!!!!!  Needed to get rid of some potatoes and this was the perfect recipe.  Only changes I made:  used non-fat milk, 2 cups chicken broth, 1/2 cup smoked gouda, and 1/2 cup extra sharp cheddar (didn't have swiss).  I tasted it before adding salt and found that it didn't need any.  AWESOME recipe.  Thanks!

Wonderful! This was my attempt at making potato soup without bacon since becoming a pescatarian and I was a bit worried about not having enough flavor. Not a problem. I used veg broth, sharp cheddar and added quinoa and lentils to boost protein (1/4 c each). Once the potatoes were soft, I hand mashed some of them. Next time I will increase the carrots, quinoa and lentils. Had 3 bowls for dinner and look forward to more for lunch :-)

Super Yummy! All 4 of my kids and my husband loved this. Did make a few changes though-I doubled the recipe and used about 1/2tsp celery salt instead of celery, used chedder cheese sauce in place of the chicken broth, and threw in some chicken cubes to add in the chicken flavor called for, and did not use flour since the cheese sauce thickens and skipped the shredded cheese. Loved this and will make again!

I really like the swiss cheese flavor!  Just make sure it's shredded!  The only thing I changed was decreased butter by about half and substituted it with cornstarch.  I also added a bag of mixed veggies, Turkey Bacon, Italian Seasoning and a little Basil.  Delicious and the kids loved it!
Second time around, omitted milk, flour & butter.  Added 1/2 & 1/2 and cornstarch.  I also added Basil & ham.  SOOO good!

Loved this! It was my first time making potato soup and was it ever yummy! I didn't have swiss cheese and used some kind of Italian 5 cheese blend and it was still delicious. Next time I will definitly try the swiss! Thanks!

It was good.  I give 5 stars if I don't change anything, but, since I did modify it a bit I'll give it 4 stars.  I exchanged swiss cheese for cheddar.  And then I added a can of cream corn, makes it really creamy and very good.

Absolutely delicious!! We used cheddar cheese instead of Swiss and it was great this way, too. Adding bacon would make it better. The only thing I'd change is a little less pepper, but that's a personal taste.

Love this soup. I doubled the recipe and sent some to in-laws. Harty, but nothing is overpowering. I omitted the cheese, used celery flakes because I was out of celery. I also added about 3/4 cup of mashed potato flakes. I couldn't seem to get it as thick as I like, could be due to doubling the recipe; but followed the recipe otherwise. I will be making this again.

AWESOME!!! I didn't have fresh parsley or carrots, so I left that out. I added some red cabbage (just boiled with the rest of the veggies) just to use it up. I also added leftover ham. It was awesome! My husband raved about it!!! This is our new favorite!! Thanks so much for sharing!!!

This was a very good soup but it needed a little extra flavor so as to not turn out too bland. Afterwards, it was a definate 5 star soup!  Here is what I did:  chopped & sauteed one whole leek, garlic & celery in butter a few minutes before adding the broth.  I had to use 4 cups of broth since I doubled the potatos (to 8 and used 2 carrots). While this was simmering, I fried 4 strips of bacon, set aside, then used one tablespoon of the bacon grease instead of butter for the roux.   Used 6 tablespoons of flour & 2 cups of milk & 2 cups of half in half. Then I took half the veggies & blended in a food processer for a creamy texture and added back to pot with remaing veggies.  Poured the roux in, added salt and black pepper and a pinch of crushed red pepper (this does not make the soup spicy hot but gives it a nice flavor).  Added dried parsley and garnished in bowls with shredded cheddar and crumbled bacon.  If the soup seems too thick, you can thin it out with milk.  Delicious!

This soup turned out great!! However, I did make a bunch of changes.     I used some butternut squash instead of carrot, and added more.  I left out celery and chicken broth.   I started by frying up a few chopped up porkchops in oil with garlic powder, and the onion , and I added about a teaspoon of chili powder and a tsp of curry powder.  I let that simmer together for a little while until the onions were brown, then I added about 2-3 cups of water.  The rest was the same except that I added some salt, pepper and some dried cilantro.  Also for flavour I added some sweet chili sauce which just gave it the right amount of pep.   So delicous, thick, and just right!!!  Also served it with biscuits.

Fantastic soup!  I took advice of other reviews to cook bacon first and then added veggies and broth.  Great soup to make on a week night for a hearty meal.  Will definitely make again and would even do for company!

I loved this recipe! Had to modify bc my boys are lactose intolerant, replaced milk with coconut milk and made "not beef bullion stock" hubby is vegan, added frozen broccoli and cauliflower at the end.  Left it to them to add cheese or soy shreds and imitation bacon bits to top it off.  My 12 year old said "How?' How what i asked "How'd you get so much flavor in such a small bowl?" Gotta love that kid gonna make a smooth politician one day I hope not!

Okay...all of my other potato soup recipes are gone. This is fantastic! I did not alter it in any way except to double the recipe and use dried parsley. The whole family loves this as well. Thanks Stephanie for this wonderful soup recipe!

Used small red potatoes with skin on.  Also added a bag of thawed corn the next day to the leftover soup - very tasty.

Good - better with the addition of Italian sausage.  I sauteed four links and diced them and added them at the end.  Also added some thyme at the end.  Instead of boiling the veggies, I sauteed the carrots, celery and onions and then deglazed the pan with some white wine.  It turned out thick, hearty, a little spicy from the sausage and totally delicious.  My husband who does not like potato soup said that he loved it!

Excellent soup! My only changes were 2, 14oz cans of broth, 1/4 cup heavy cream, +2xtra TBsp butter & flour and more of the veggies. Also I didnt do the swiss cheese. Have been looking for a hearty, thick & creamy but not too thick soup that was close to something I made for my grandfather as a teenager, this is awesome, thanks for sharing it!

Wow. Great soup. I used the red russet potatos - I needed 5 of them. I probably underestimated the onions, and would have loved to try it with the cheese, but didn't have any. I am so happy with the result! Perfect comfort food. I also added dill.

This soup was easy to make and full of Flavor, I did mix milk and chicken broth together for an even balance. You can add any vegetable you like and I dont see how it could turn out bad. My husband loves this soup and he is not fond of potato at all!  This would also be a great soup to freeze and serve later. I found my left overs the next day were more flavorul then when first made. If reheating just add milk if it is to thick!

I liked it; the girls (10 and 13) ate it all, but gave me their opinions which weren't rave reviews.  I will definitely make it again.  Next time without cheese and not so thick.

We made this for a church supper--it was a hit and much appreciated for it's homey-ness. Only differene we made was not adding the roux. By the time the potatos and other veggies were cooked down and slightly mashed, it wasn't necessary to add the roux. We heated the milk and cheese togetherr seperately, adding about 4 cups of the potato mixture, mixing well, then stirring it all into the main soup. This soup is fabulous, very easy to make and very enjoyable on a cold night.

This soup is absolutely delicious.  Everyone raved about this for days. I made this at least once a week throughout the winter.  I substituted the Swiss cheese for chedder when I first made this because it was the only cheese I had on hand at the time.

Very good. I served it in bread bowls and it was the perfect meal on a cold night. I used minced cilantro instead of parsley because I had it on hand and red skin potatoes. Yummy! Mash less if you like your soup really chunky. The Swiss gives it a phenomenal texture and taste. My mom loved it and she doesn't like Swiss cheese at all!

This is a great starter recipe for potato soup. We didn't care for the swiss cheese and like many others I added more onion, garlic, and bacon. We will definitely be cooking this again just with our own little twists.

I had only 3 potatoes, so I thickened the soup up a bit at the end with instant potato flakes.  I prefer potato chunks, so I didn't mash them.  I substituted cheddar cheese for the Swiss.  Good basic soup.

I made this for dinner tonight, but my hubby was running late so I thought I could just simmer it until he got home...bad idea.  It was so thick we could have eaten it with a fork.  I could have thinned it out but didn't want to risk losing any flavor.  I will definitely try this again...on a weekend when I don't have to worry about my hubby being late.

Awesome!! Made it last night and had to portion it into individual serverings, b/c my husband wants to take it to work this week.   I put in 1/2 cup of swiss, instead of the full cup, and it still seemed to be to chessy. Added a pinch of garlic. And used Slim milk.

Wow  that was awesome!  I did not measure anything. I added extra of everything. I didn't have butter so I used vergetable oil. I was afraid It would taste oily, so I added about1/4 cup sour cream to compensate for the absence of buttery flavor. I also dodn't have suisse cheese, so I added mozza-cheddar cheese. The kids absolutely looooved it, and so did I! Thank so much for that fabulous, delicious and easy recipe!

Great tasting! The vegetable mix needs to be simmered longer or they need to be boiled for about five extra minutes so they are tender enough. This is a favorite potato soup recipe.

Excellent potato soup!  I followed the directions exactly except I left out the pepper and cheese.  (The last time I made soup, I put in the recommended amount of pepper and was told it was too much, so I left the pepper up to each person's taste.)  This soup is good enough without the cheese, but I will try it with the swiss cheese and also with cheddar.    Next time, I'll also cut the onion in bigger chunks as the smaller pieces I cut this time dissolved completely.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!  =^..^=

Recommend to anyone looking for a new "comfort" dish. Easy to make and GOOD! The only thing I did different was substitute corn for the carrots(hubby doesn't like them) and added some crumbled bacon and topped with cheddar cheese. I would recommend anyone who tried this without the swiss to try it again with as it added an amazing flavor. Thanks for the recipe!

Wonderful! A new favorite! I made the following alterations to make it vegetarian/healthier: Vegetable broth instead of chicken, used plain soymilk instead of regular milk, omitted butter & cheese. Added 6 Tbsp fresh chopped parsley, dash of hot cayenne powder, 1 tsp fresh chopped thyme, 1 bay leaf, 2 small cloves garlic (minced). Next time I'm going to add 1/4 to 1/2 cup chopped red pepper and maybe some chopped spinach. Can't wait to make this again!

Delicious soup!  I added 2 sausage links which I had leftover from breakfast, chopped into very small pieces.  The sausage gave it a slightly smoky flavor.  Next time I'll add bacon bits because I don't normally have sausage on hand.  Also, i used shredded colby cheese, which worked fine, though I'm excited to try it w/ swiss next time.  I also added ~1/2 tsp of rosemary.  Excellent texture and flavor of this soup!

Maybe like a 3 1/2.  It didnt seem thick enough but that could have been our fault and the cheese added a gritty texture we thought.  We have had better for sure.  It was'nt really favorful for all the stuff in it.

Thanks, I prefer potato soup not blended.  The recipe did'nt say how much water to put in.  I used a recipe for 6 and added 8 cups.  I only had low fat milk, so I added a tad more flour to the mixture.  Then it did thicken up.  Nice flavor and texture.  Will be saving this in my recipe box.

This is the best potato soup I ever made. I made it for my church dinner for about 40 people and they kept coming back for more. Everyone loved it!!!  Have made it for my family and they always want more.

I've made this many times over the years.  When they were little, my kids didn't like the celery and carrots, so I just left them out and it still tasted good.  I usually omit the cheese, and have cheese at the table to sprinkle on top instead. Good with bits of ham and green onions to put on top, too.  I like this soup because it's tasty and filling and because I often have the ingredients on hand even when I haven't planned ahead!  Also, it has less fat/calories than most potato soup recipes.

This recipe is really good but a bit watery, I like a thick soup.  I add a can of Campbell's cream of potato for thickness delicious!  Today I plan on switching it with cream of celery.

This is my favorite potato soup recipe (don't tell my mom!). I don't add the carrot usually, and I've never tried it with the swiss, but the case recipe is great! Creamier and more flavorful than other recipes I've made. It is one of our winter staples!

Simply a great Recipe.  My mother was under the weather with the flu and requested some potato soup, and of course I looked on Allrecipes for a great recipe. I wasn't disappointed at all. I am not a fan of celery so I didn't add it. I didn't have swiss cheese so I substituted that for some sharp cheddar.  It was really good.It was a Hit with my mom, who asked for the recipe.   Thanks for this recipe!!!

This soup was delicious!! Even my 8 month old had some and loved it!! I did make a few changes...added garlic (3-4 cloves) and fresh thyme to the veggies and crunchy bacon and green onion on the top of each serving.  I found that the 1 1/2 cups of stock was not enough to cover my veggies so I doubled it and increased the butter, flour, and milk as needed.  Served it with crunchy French Bread on the side.  Next time I think I will add mushrooms...although my husband might protest!! My 3 year old and I will LOVE it!!  Will make this more often for sure!!

Really good. I didn´t have onions but it didn´t matter. I added mushrooms and I used Queso Manchego instead of swiss cheese, but just a slice. Came out great! Not sure on the portions. I made it for my husband and I and there is a little left over, but we ate it as a meal.

I had lots of potatoes and was looking for a soup recipe. This was absolutely wonderful! I made lots of minor changes and was afraid it wouldn't be as good as the reviews but it was. I used vanilla Silk instead of milk because that was all I had. I also added chicken bouillon with a little butter to water because I didn't have enough chicken broth. Even though I was short of some critical ingredients, you can see I was determined to make soup.  Glad I did. Will definitely make it again. Maybe next time I'll follow the recipe more closely.

My husband exclaimed this to be THE best potato soup I've ever made.  I did very little to change the original, tho I admit I don't measure very closely.  I think I did put in more veggies than called for.  I used fat free half and half for a lot of the milk because I needed to use it.  I was surprised that the swiss cheese was not a dominant flavor...this will be our permenant potato soup recipe in our house

My husband and I really liked this soup. I did not have celery, so we left that out. I also did not measure the salt, pepper, or parsley but just added it to taste. I had trouble getting the milk mixture to thicken, but once I added it to the potatoes it got thick right away. I used medium cheddar cheese because we did not have swiss. I would say sharp cheddar would also be good. You could add bacon and make it a baked potato soup as well.

Great recipe!  I substituted vegetable broth for the chicken broth because that's what I had on hand, but it would make it a great vegetarian recipe that way.  I omitted parsley and celery - just a personal preference.  I added another carrot and used 2 cups of half and half and 1/2 a cup of milk.  I didn't stir in the cheese, but garnished with cheese and bacon bits.  Served with cornbread.  So yummy!!!

I only made 1/2 batch to try, this was SO tasty!  I did add a little more butter, flour and by accident, melted the butter till it started turning brown, but still used it and it made it kinda a nutty flavor, which was good.  YUM!  Will make again, in a larger batch!

This recipe turned out wonderful. It was the potato soup I remember from my childhood. I added a cup extra chicken broth and an extra carrot and a teaspoon pepper for a bit of spice.

This is so delicious!  I'm not usually a fan of soup but the entire family is and I'm so glad I tried this!  Like others I fry 8oz of bacon then saute celery and onions in the fat before I add the potatoes.  I also add rosemary, thyme and lots of salt and pepper as well as garlic to the potato mixture.  Since we eat is so quickly around here I double the batch and add a couple extra cups of water to thin it out; mine always seemed very thick and this works.  Tonight's batch got 2 cups of diced ham from the leftover Christmas ham.  This is a weekly dish around here!

Loved this!! I followed the directions exactly and maybe would cut back on the parsley.  Actually I have a cold, and have been having a hard time smelling or tasting so was concerned. The aroma of this while cooking is fantastic.  Tasted good, but looking forward to having some when I am better.  My husband isn't a fan of soup, and scarfed it all down!

This soup was good but not perfect! I used white potatoes and the soup seems to have a slightly gritty texture. I would cube the potatoes smaller and not mash them next time. It was incredibly bland before the salt and cheese. I think bacon would make it awesome.

The only ingredient I didn't have on hand was the swiss chesse, so I made a point of getting some.  It made ALL the difference.  I also mashed the potatoes some (aside from the veggies) because I like a creamier soup. I can't tell you enough how delicious this is!

Wonderful soup!  My whole family loved this recipe.  I had everything on hand except for the swiss cheese so I just used cheddar and it was a huge hit with everyone.

Wonderful Soup!!!  I have tried many "homemade" potato soups looking for one that I could really add to my list of recipies.  I never knew how many contained condensed soups as part of the ingredients.  I'm so glad this one does not and tastes great!!

Super Yummy!! The only change I made was to add 2 strips of cut up bacon to the soup. My hubby and kids ate the whole batch in one sitting. I made this with Cheddar Rolls and it was delicious for an autumn dinner!

Oh. My. God. Sooooo good. Perfect comfort food for the first cool day of the season. I've never made soup from scratch before and this was easier than I expected. Took a little while, but totally worth it. Reheats well too!

Yummy! I added more of all vegtables and potatos to make it chunky. Will probably take the suggestion to add a little garlic next time. Also needed to add additional salt and pepper for my taste, but it was great and will be making it again!

Used "not chicken" broth, being a vegetarian, and it was AWESOME! Doubled and saved, perfect fall meal. You can skimp on the butter for sure, but everything else was perfect. Had green onions, shredded cheese, and oyster crackers to go with it, and we were all thrilled. Left out celery and carrot for my picky husband, who added bacon and loved it!

This has great flavor. I didn't have parsley or swiss cheese, still tasty without them. I did add 3 cloves of minced garlic. Will make again, Thanks for posting.

I omitted the carrot, used skim milk, added 6 pieces of bacon, and used sharp cheddar instead. It was exactly what I've been looking for. The best potato soup we've ever eaten.

Chunky potato soup was the family's favorite soup/snack of all time. We used to make it from the ready to make soup mix that has all dehydrated ingredients. And this recipe has the same taste but made with fresh ingredients. When I made it it felt like a dream come true. I called the family members and told them I found the recipe. And my husband said make it everyday. It's sooooo good. Thank you.

This soup was fantastic!!!  I loved how easy it was to make!  I added some ham which added a nice flavor and used cheddar cheese instead of swiss and it still tasted great!  I would definitely make this soup again and recommend it to others.

I have tried a few recipes from this site, and this potato soup is awesome! I added some bacon to it and the family went crazy over it. One of my daughters will not eat onions but in this soup she said it was great! I will be cooking this again.

I've searched high and low for a good potato soup recipe and until now they've always fallen short. This recipe rocks! I have to say though that I've tried it several different times and my favorite version (although the Swiss is very good) is made with a combination of extra sharp cheddar and Gouda cheeses. Thanks for the great recipe!

This is a very good, hearty soup.  I was making this one day when unexpected company showed up.  I added some extra milk and put in a can of cream style corn.  This was also a hit with everyone.

Excellent soup. I cooked and reserved 2 more potatoes and added them when the soup was done. It made it chunkier. I also added some Franks Hot Sauce--nice flavour and about 3 cups of chopped leeks. I love to experiment with any recipe to make it my own.

Amazing soup! Leftovers were great the next day by adding milk and popping it in the microwave. I put bacon in it, next time I think we'll try ham.

Loved it!  Added some corn and smoked sausage to it, plus a few dashes of hot sauce!  Yummy!  Instead of just the milk/flour mixture, I used one can of evaporated milk.  Quick and delicious comfort food.  Will make again.

This is the best potato soup I've ever had. The Swiss cheese is a nice addition. I didn't have celery or onion, but it didn't need it.

I made this on the first cold day of the season and my family loved it!  I left out the butter the cheese and added some sausage and frozen corn.  Slightly healthier but still yummy!!!

Delicious.  Made mostly as is, but didn't mash the potatoes any and was out of carrots, but I usually always put carrots in my potato soup.  Everyone loved it and several asked for the recipe.  I took it to work on a cold autumn day.

Loved it! I used a mixture of red & white potatoes cause that's what I had. I was out of celery and used cheddar instead of swiss because it's what I had on hand. The flavour was great and the soup was very easy to prepare...my favorite kind of recipe!

I thought this soup was rather tasty and definitely comfort food.  I left out the onions due to allergies and kept the skins on my potatoes for added nutrition.  I also had to add more broth to cover all the potatoes but I probably had too many.  I also used a mexican blend cheese since I needed to use it up, although I'm sure it would be great with the swiss.  I'll definitely be making this one again!

This soup is excellent!  I've already made it several times!   I did make a few adjustments to the recipe: added frozen corn; more carrots (2-3 worth); added fresh or powdered garlic; also I used two strips of bacon which I chopped up and cooked, and then added to the soup.  I've also never used Swiss cheese; usually I use either cheddar or a 3 cheese blend.  Always tastes fabulous!

Really creamy and flavorful soup!  I did a few things differently. I sauteed my onion and celery in a little butter for extra softness before adding to the potatoes and broth.  I also shredded my carrots for a little different texture.  I also added real bacon bits.  The only cheese I had was a couple of Kraft cheese slices so that's what I threw in along with some sour cream right before taking it off the heat.

Great soup.  Used whatever cheese I had in the fridge and it turned out great anyway!  Good for cold winter evenings.  Made this soup for a second time now. I used red potatoes with the skins on because I hate to peel potatoes!  Turned out great again.  Used a little more potatoes and a little more cheese than recipe calls for.  Also used just swiss cheese.  Very hearty recipe.

I just made this soup for the first time and what a HIT it made at the dinner table...I added cheddar cheese instead of Swiss because it was all I had, but boy I'll try it with Swiss the next time. Thanks!!! This one is a keeper!!!

This is the BEST Potato Soup that I've ever made or eaten! I did two things differently. I added Celery Salt to taste. It really adds to the flavor. I also used Cheddar Cheese instead of Swiss because it was all I had on hand. I don't think it mattered - this soup is out of this world!!! I gave this recipe to my Mom, whom has a great family Potato Soup recipe that we use, and she was very impressed! You will love it!

Fantastic.  My kids love it, my husband and I love it.  And my kids don't usually like soup.  If I told them there was Swiss cheese in it, they'd claim to hate it.  But they ask for it all the time.  Thanks! 
Update: My family asks for this a lot...I am making it for company tomorrow. I re-read some of the reviews and see that a lot of people omit the swiss cheese...I really encourage you to try it-it doesn't taste like Swiss cheese in the soup, but it adds complexity and a subtle new flavor.

This was great!  I'd never made a cream soup before so I was a bit wary but it was so easy!  The only things I did different was "simmer" the veggies for much longer and added more salt, pepper, and cheese.

I really liked it.  I added a little more broth because I think I had a few more potatoes and then a pinch of corn starch to help it get thicker.  It was very yummy.  I'll make it again.

Good Recipe, hard to scale down as it makes and odd number of servings...  I didn't use celery or carrots, but used bacon, 4 strips, and corn, 1 can.  added 2 cloves of garlic with the potato while it was cooking.

This is a great, super easy recipe!  I was craving some bacon-like flavor but didn't have any, so we added in a few chopped hot dogs, it was so good.  I also left the skins on the potatoes (I used french fingerlings) - it added a nice color to it.  Tossed in some peas as well - fabulous recipe, very adjustable.

This was a very easy and delicious recipe. The chicken broth gave it extra flavor, and the swiss cheese was a nice change from American and cheddar that I've had in potato soups before.

I have never made potato soup before. This was pretty easy. I had a can of chicken broth and it did not measure up to 1 1/2 cups. It came to a little over a cup, so i had to add water. But 1 1/2 cups of water was not enough to cover my potatoes, celery, carrots, and onions to simmer. So I had to add an additional cup and a half of water. To compensate, I had to use salt, so it wouldn't be bland. I added Thyme, garlic powder, parsley flakes, and a bit of cayenne pepper. The result was great. I loved it. Right before serving i used cheddar and some bacon bits. I would make again!

Awsome winter soup. Even the little one liked it. This is stick to your ribs kind of food. And so easy to make. Just as good when reheated in microwave. Great for lunch at work.

I don't consider myself an expert cook and this recipe worked out perfectly for me.  After 30 minutes and a slightly modified ingredient list (no cheese), I had a great tasting soup.  I will definitely be making this again.

I used cream cheese instead of swiss and it was very good!  Also added more carrot/celery.

This soup was a hit! It was really creamy. I added dried parsley flakes instead of fresh parsley. I also added 2 cloves of garlic. The first time I made this, I forgot to add the cheese. Than I had a small bowl of it and it was really good. Than I remembered the cheese and added it to the soup. It tasted a lot better.

I used vegetable broth to keep it "kosher" and opted for sharp cheddar instead of swiss cheese. Very simple and easy to make. Tried 1/2 percent milk and was still creamy.  We had no leftovers!
