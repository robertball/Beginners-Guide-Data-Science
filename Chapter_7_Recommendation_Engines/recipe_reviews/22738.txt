Alot of my guest thought it would be better with salt around the rim instead of the sugar...myself I liked the sugar on the rim!!  Great drink...that really does sneak up on you!

These were interesting but my husband thought there would be more banana flavor. I ended up using many more bananas than the recipe called for and kept tweaking until we liked it. I can say I have had a banana margarita now but doubt I will ever go to the trouble to make another except if we were having a theme party or something along those lines where this would go well.

WOW.  I don't even like margaritas, but these were amazing.  The banana really makes it creamy and delicious--try this recipe if you like tropical drinks!  I was thinking of adding some orange juice next time and experimenting with the frozen concentrate.

I had to try this one being an avid margarita drinker.  However, you MUST like the taste of triple sec to like this drink, and unfortunatly, we dont.  Also, my bananas weren't very ripe and could barely taste banana.  I would suggest using very ripes ones, and minimal triple sec according to your tastes.

Excellent!!  I made these for Superbowl and everyone loved them.  Even my non-sweet drinking/beer only friend!  I did use 4 large bananas and reduced Triple Sec slightly to give them more banana flavor.  They were great....creamy and delicious.  I may try adding a little banana liqueur next time to see if it makes any difference...but we love them!  Thank you!

Unbelievably great.  The concept of bananas in my mararita was so odd, I had to try it.  Actually, I was entertaining an annoying guest and was looking for a distraction.  I certainly was not prepared to actually like this recipe.  Now it is requested often in my home and I certainly enjoy them.

All I have to say is that I won a margarita contest with this recipe!  Thanks for sharing.  I didn't have the limeade so I substituted some apricot liqueur and lime juice.

Excellent.  Mostly lime flavored, but the banana adds a smooth texture and back note.

It's alright. Need to add a lot of Banana's to get that shweet banana flavor. One cool thing though, it get's a neat smooth texture that I rather liked, and that was with only a few bananas. It's definitely worth trying. But make sure you test it out before serving to handful of guests.

Didn't taste like Margarita. Weird combination, salt on the rim doesn't go well with banana flavor.

I halved this recipe and used slightly less triple sec.  I used one very ripe banana.  I really liked the taste and texture of this drink.  I agree with some of the reviewers that a small amounto of banana liqeur would realy pump up the banana flavor, but I really enjoyed the mild taste of this drink.  It was tangy and sweet, with a bit of creaminess from the banana and a subtle and yummy banana taste.  thanks for this idea!

Thsese were pretty good but a little tart. I added an extra banana for more banana flavor but still thought it was lacking so I added a cap of banana flavoring....much improved! You are going to get wayy more than 4 servings out of this....more like 8. Thansk Todd these were good!

These were just o.k.  Nothing I would make again.  Not a lot of banana flavor.  This was also the first time I've made a margarita using fz. limeade and I didn't care for the limeade.

YUM!! The only alterations I made were: less ice (4 cups) and more bananas (3 or 4, depending on the size). I also did not have Triple Sec, but the drink didn't need it! They were smooth, creamy and delish! But beware, they will sneak up on you! What a nice change from the standard lime margarita. You rock Todd!

I had a nice ripe banana and so my mind immediately leapt to MARGARITAS!  I found this recipe and did a couple of things differently.  1.  I added the one fresh banana and about 2 frozen bananas which had started to discolor a bit from the freezer (which is why I threw them in).  There was some delicious syrup and such in the ziploc that also ended up in the blender.  2.  I filled a pint glass full about 1 and 1/2 times with crushed ice and dumped that in--not 6 cups worth but perfect.  The 6 oz of tequila was mixed 1/2 silver and 1/2 gold.  I did sprinkle the sugar in but I will omit for the next batch--didn't need it as it was plenty sweet from the limeade.  Very Good!

This recipe is a winner!  Really, really good...I will definately make this again and again.  Triple Sec can be altered to taste.  I halfed the suggested amount and found it more to my liking.

Mmmm! Very good! The only thing I might try next time is to add 1 more banana and/or maybe try changing it to 2oz triple sec and 2oz banana liquer to increase the banana flavor. It was quite subtle as is.

This turned into a 4th of July hit.  We did add more triple sec and a bit of sweetener brought out the banana flavor.  My BF really doesn't like margaritas becuase of the sour mix, but happily enjoyed these with me.

excellent recipe. I would only add some criticism. If you are LACKING tripple sec and Lime concentrate, but are only left with standard Jose mix...Just add 2 banananas, 8 ounces mix, 5 ounces tequilla, and after blending 6 ouces of ice, top off margaita with Kaluha. Take my word for it, it will enhance your banana flavor and creat the most unique margarita you have ever tasted.
6 cups ice
5 ounces tequilla
1.5 ounces Kaluh
8 ounces standard lime margarita mix
