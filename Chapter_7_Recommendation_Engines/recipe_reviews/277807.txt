1.16.20  Very good, wouldnâ€™t change anything, but I would recommend you start checking for doneness sooner than 40 minutes.  I checked at 30, and mine already were crisp and cooked through.  In addition to a tasty side dish, these wedges really would be a great game day snack.  Sprinkled on some sea salt flakes right before serving.
