Boy, were these good!  I pulled the skin back before I made the slits - then pulled it back over after they were stuffed.  Awesome blend of flavors.  Definitely worth the time.  Beaufiful once browned, too.  For an inexpensive meal, it's definitely something you wouldn't be afraid to serve to guests.  Thank you!  What a great tribute to "Dad" to share.

The previous reviewer states that they followed the recipe "exactly" and the meat was dry and chewy.  If you follow the recipe exactly, if the meat is getting dry while cooking you do what the recipe says and add some water and turn the burner down.  Previous reviewers suggesting slow cookers or simmering in a liquid also have good ideas if you are worried about dry tough meat.

I tried this recipe, as directed, to the T. I enjoyed the smoky, tender result of the meat. However, the unnecessary amount of salt and oil the recipe calls for made me ill. Simply skip it. There’s no need to "stuff" the legs, either. Just poke them all around (or create slits) and the seasoning will penetrate them. Brown them in oil with a few drops of teriyaki. Put them in a pot. Add a can of Tomato Paste, a can of Tomato Sauce, then the bacon, onion and peppers. Also, instead of simply using Oregano and Pepper, the following seasonings result in a wonderful flavor: Cilantro, Garlic, Bay Leaves, Cumin, Coriander and/or an Italian Seasoning mix (consisting of: Marjoram, Thyme, Rosemary, Savory, Sage, Oregano and Basil.) Also, give it a splash of White Cooking Wine and Bitter Orange. Have it all simmer together for the approx. cooking time of 1½ hrs.

The flavor was really good.  The recipe, however, did not say where to marinate. 
(My refrigerator solidified the olive oil.)  It should also have said approximately 
how many slits to make per leg.  I had too many left over onions/peppers/ and 
bacon pieces.  It did not say what to do with thoset.  The cooking time indicated 
was about half of what I needed (1 hr 20 minutes) until the juices ran clear.  But
it was worth the work and my husband liked the results.

We eat a lot of turkey and I wanted a new recipe.  This was a nice change of flavor!  If you check my other recipe reviews, I am always one for simplifying whenever possible and needless to say, I did so here.  I seasoned my (three) legs with S, P, and oregano.  Then wrapped two pieces of bacon around each leg and fried it in a pan just like you would regular bacon.  Turning carefully so the bacon doesn't fall off.  Then I placed the legs in the crockpot.  Poured 1Tb. of Hoisin sauce over each leg and cooked on low for 6-8 hours.  It was delicious and easy!

These didn't knock my socks off, but they were very tasty for a weeknight dinner..  Like others have said: Cut the oil in half and the salt to 1 tsp or less. To make it easy, I just sauted and stewed everything together in a close fitting pot with cover, and on top of the stove. Skip the stuffing business too. I'll make this again.

My husband went and bought 4 packages of turkey legs after eating this meal. I didn't cut slits and stuff the legs.  Just chopped everything up and threw it in the pot with corriander seeds. I didnt have the soy sauce but I didn't miss it. I did add water as suggested.  I removed the bacon towards the end and cooked it fully in the microwave. Served with rice covered in the sauce with bacon on top.  Big hit with kids too.

I was looking for something different and found the recipe.  It was really easy to prepare and it turned out great.  I used precooked bacon and it still gave it a great flavor.  I will try this one again:)

I wanted to take a break from eating red meat and thought of using this turkey recipe for my husband.  The first time we had it, my husband was not only surprised by the size of the turkey legs, he was also extremely pleased with how it tasted.  I cooked it again when a couple of friends came for dinner and they found it also delicious!  It has become a favorite dish whenever we expect relatives and friends for dinner.  But to improve its taste, I marinated the turkey without the olive oil for at least 2 hours or better yet overnight in the refrigerator then an hour before cooking, I mixed the olive oil into the marinade and let it sip through. Yummy!

Pretty and easy to make, this recipe is certainly quite salty. I would halve the salt.  It was helpful to pull the skin down, stuff the turkey legs and then replace the skin. It made the turkey quite juicy. Definitely worth making.

I made this dish for my first Thanksgiving dinner-- or the first time I cooked rather.  It was simply delicious.  I also stuffed some traditional stuffing in the legs.  I did both smoked turkey and regular turkey legs.

My family liked this recipe. I used 1/2 cup olive oil to marinate the turkey and 1 tsp salt. Tender and delicious.

It was hard to keep the stuffing in the leg cuts, but it was delicious.  Next time I might stuff only bacon and then do the veggies underneath them just to ensure the bacon fat seeps into the meat.

Good. I used the recommendation of cooking it in the slow cooker like so many others suggested. I will also ditto that you don't need so much salt as the bacon does a good job of adding sufficient salt. This reminded me of Stewed Turkey Legs that my grandmother use to make for Sunday Dinner.

While this is not a terrible recipe it was honestly not as good as I hoped they would be. I love turkey & was salivating at the thought of trying this out & it just didn't compare to the way I usually make them. It was kind of upsetting.

This was a lot of work, but absolutely great.  I was afraid it was going to be too salty, but it was just right.  I used turkey thighs, instead of legs, because that was what I had.  That may have been why I had some trouble with stuffing the ingredients into the slits I made.  I'll try it again when I find turkey legs on sale.

This was a great way to cook turkey! The meat was really moist, but a little greasy, I'll be cutting back the oil next time (I only had 3 turkey legs, though).

Worth the wait!  Excellent - and I don't even like Turkey legs very much.
