the baking temp is too low and time too short!
Bake at 450F for 20min, then at 350F for 20min.

Happy baking!

I hate to be harsh as the first reviewer of a new recipe, but I also want to be honest.  Unfortunately, these were a total failure.  Not only did they not look like a popover, but the texture was very heavy and dense, very unlike a popover.  Not sure what happened because I followed the recipe to the letter, didn't change a thing or substitute anything.  And even if the appearance and the texture had been good, they simply needed more pumpkin flavor.  Sam Nemati, sorry for the unfavorable review, I had high hopes, but these pumpkin popovers were a huge disappointment.

I had some extra pumpkin puree in the refrigerator from another recipe and needed to put it to use. I decided to try this recipe and it turned out great. I followed the revised instructions by Sam to cook at 450 degrees F for 20, but then I only cooked at about 10 minutes at 350 F after that because they seemed to be about done. I didn't have custard tins or large muffin tins, so my popovers are a bit on the small side, but they have that great eggy taste mixed with pumpkin. I didn't have pumpkin pie spice so I used two dashes cinnamon, 1 dash nutmeg, 1 dash cloves, and 1 dash ginger. These ended up being the perfect on-the-go breakfast. Thanks Sam!

I made it to the recipe and they were good but not as flavorful as I expected.  Next time I use more spices and maybe a tad more surgir.

These tasted good, but the consistency was definitely not a popover.  I used an actual popover pan, but still didn't work.  I was so looking forward to them, but they just didn't deliver.
