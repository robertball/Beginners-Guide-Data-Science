My daughter and I have made these 3 times and really enjoy them. They are easy, fun and make a great treat for children, bake sales or family functions.

I made these cookies for Valentines Day for my grandchildren. They were extremely salty. Overall the recipe was easy and they looked wonderful. I even tinted them with red food coloring. I tasted them a few days after baking and they were still too salty. I asked a couple of friends to try them and they agreed there was a definite salty aftertaste. I finally ended up not giving them to my grandchildren and throwing out the cookies. There is definitely something wrong with the use of 1/2 teasp of baking soda and 1/2 teasp of salt. Next time I would definitely reduce those amounts. I wish I had read the other review where someone also thought them too salty before I went to all the work of baking them and decorating them.

Melt in your mouth delicious!  I rolleed the cookie dough balls in sugar sprinkles before baking and they were fabulous!  Also used regular lollipop sticks instead of popsicle sticks.  Thanks!

I tried these in a cookie boquet using green- colored popsicle sticks to creat a flower illusion as opposed to a lollipop.

I added a 1/2 butter (real butter) and it make such a difference in texture and it made the cookie chewy instead of crunchy.

Excellent Cookie Recipe!! I made Heart Shaped Lollipop Cookies for my daughters class and this recipe was perfect. I did take the advise of others and used Butter Shortening. I will definetley use this again. (Tip: Roll into balls and refridgerate for an hour or so. Keep them in the Fridge in until ready to use).

This makes a yummy, soft cookie, though a little salty.  I flattened the dough slightly to use cookie cutters.  My favorite was a flower shaped cookie, with a thumbprint hole in the middle where I added raspberry jam.  Perfect for a flower cookie boquet.

These cookies were perfect for this sweet-tooth prego momma! I had very few ingredients in the house and did a search. This came up and it was AWESOME! I actually had changed a few things too. I used Wheat Flour and I packed my brown sugar (not too sure if it was to be packed). I also added more than listed pure vanilla extract (I do with most cookie recipes). I didn't have sticks but they were eaten too fast for that! Thanks!

I've tried making these cookies for the fund raising.Unfortunately,the dough turns out to be too flaky and difficult to shape.I've to add more four to stable it.Its so frustrating and the taste is just so normal.

This is a GREAT cookie!  I halved the salt after reading reviews and the taste was perfect! I made these for a bake sale at my son's school and wrapped them in cellophane and tied them with ribbon.  They came out great!

Made these for my little guy's second birthday and they were a big success. The dough was a little crumbly to work with, but eventually I got the hang of it and they turned out swell. I used coloured craft sticks and wrote names on the handles which then served as nametags on the lootbags I stuffed them into. I used the idea of rolling them in coloured sugar and they really were cute--and pretty delicious.

These cookies were delicious! I made them for my son's class as a treat and they were a big hit. I rolled them in colored sugar prior to baking (red and green for Christmas)and I used butter flavored crisco in place of regular shortening. I also used lollipop sticks instead of craft sticks.

These were great. I used them to make cookie bouquets for valentine's day. I used cookie molds to make heart shapes, I sprinkled red sugar on before putting in the oven. They looked great!!! They taste great and the kids loved them!

I would give this recipe more than 5 stars if I could. I have done this recipe several times now, and I do it with cookie cutters and pipe on the icing after the cookies have cooled. I use this icing recipe: http://cookie.allrecipes.com/az/SugarCookieIcing.asp which is on this site as well called sugar cookie icing. They look like the cookies that you buy for cookie boquets! The taste is great, as well!! My friends thought I bought these cookies already made! Oh, and they're really tasty with some brown sugar sprinkled on them while baking. yummy!

I give it five stars. I used this recipe for christmas cookies last week- without the popstick or circle shape. The ingredients made a lot of cookies! They've lasted all week. I shared them with friends and family and everyone loved them!   For frosting I used another recipe found on the site and it was amazing!

Not a bad cookie but not what I needed.  I did not care for the odd taste from the shortening, I did use the butter flavored shortening.  My 2 young sons and their friends did not like them either.  I also found the bamboo skewer I used as the stick did not stay in the cookie and the cookie broke when stood upright.  I think this recipe would work better w/ butter/marg. and as drop cookies w/o the craft stick.

They were really good.I DIDN'T notice a salty aftertase at all.Although, I did frost them.Also, my only complaint was that the dough was VERY flaky.I had a hard time forming it into balls.And my only other wish was that I could of somehow formed them into other shapes, not just circles.

This is a really fun and cute idea especially for a school party. Mine turned out better using a non-insulated cookie sheet.  Even with unsalted butter, they seemed a bit salty to me too.

i had to give this cookie 4 outta 5 stars bc i kinda customized this recipe a little but all in all, this cookie had a really great flavor. i took the advice of some of the other people and watched out for the salt. i sustituted half the shortening with 1 stick of butter, doubled the vanilla, reduced the salt to 1/8 tsp, and used 1 tsp of baking powder instead of baking soda.

This is a delicious sugar cookie recipe. I've tried MANY but this one is at the top. I always reduce any vanilla extract and add almond extract and this made this recipe even more HEAVENLY.
