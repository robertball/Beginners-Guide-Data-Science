Very good banana bread recipe.  I used chocolate chips instead of baking chocolate and it turned out fine.

The chocolate chunks far overpower the delicate banana flavor of this recipe.  Not that that's a bad thing; just don't expect a classic banana bread flavor with chocolate added.

Not too sweet and I was even able to pull it off at 6,035 FT! (had to bake and extra 10+ mins.)

This recipe turned out excellent for me!  I  substituted with brown sugar, and added some almond extract for a strong nutty flavor.  It was great.

I doubled this recipe, the one I put in walnuts and topped it with almonds and the other I put in just chocolate chunks, they were both ssoooo moist and very good. Best banana bread recipe that I've found so far.

I used chocolate chips.  VERY good.  Very moist. We loved it warm with butter on it.

My whole family loved this recipe.  With rice milk and dairy free chocolate chips, it served our dietary needs perfectly.

What a moist banana bread. I reduced the amount of chocolate in the recipe to 3oz. as I prefer the chocolate to compliment the banana, not overpower it. I also added 1/3 cup of extra banana (2 bananas in total) and a splash of vanilla.  Baked for 50 minutes and ended up with perfect results. Deeeelicious.

Best banana bread recipe I've come across. Very simple and quick to make.  Each time I have to put it back in for 15 mins (foil on top), but then it is absolutely perfect.   Last time I made it I added cinnamon to the ingredients and it was a really nice touch (not to mention smell in the house!)

Absolutely delicious. I'm not the greatest baker, but this was easy to make and even easier to eat. Very rich--more like cake than bread.

I love love love this recipe!  I've  made it several times for the family, and never ever have to toss a single piece.  It has the perfect blend of banana and chocolate (not too much of either), and it always turns out very moist.

Nice and easy to throw together. I used Pecans and had my husband run out to get chocolate chips but he came home with chocolate bars but it turned out just great.

Very basic recipe that can be improvised easily.  I used peanut butter chips along with some chocolate chunks. I was in heaven!!
