Followed the recipe just as it was written,  These came out of the fryer raw in the center.  I put them in the oven to slow cook to get the center done, but that made the crust tough.   They were very spicy. Want be making these again.

Made them today with my own seasonings and they turned out perfectly delicious. I used Accent, garlic powder, garlic pepper, onion powder, salt, and a little hickory liquid smoke. I marinated the 3 slabs over night and fried them in all purpose flour and vegetable oil. Hubby loves them
