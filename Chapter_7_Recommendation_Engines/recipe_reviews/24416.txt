Yum!  I used less water and pureed the carrots along with the cauliflower, and it couldn't be any better.

good! As an avid cooker I can highly recommend this to anybody! What I changed a bit: I used good chicken stock (Knorr brand is the best!) instead of water and I also added Cayenne pepper like some other reviewer suggested - only if you like spicy. A permanent recipe in my collection. You can serve this with a sprinkle of cheddar cheese and a drop of half-and half for presentation.

I simmered the vegetables in 3 cups of water, pureed them in the blender, then stirred in 2 cups of low-fat milk.  The results were delicious!

This is a wonderful recipe.  I had another recipe for cauliflower soup...and knowing that I was going to make it tonight, decided to check in here to see if anyone elses sounded better.  This one did.  I put it together in a snap.  Took the advice of a previous reviewer and used 4.5 cups of water.  I also added a tad more salt.  This is indeed smooth and creamy.  It goes into my permanent file.

Excellent soup! I followed other readers' advice and used half broccoli, half cauliflower, handful of baby carrots and only 4.5 cups of water. Added some cayenne pepper to give it some kick. I cheated and used cutup veggies in a bag, so it couldn't have been easier.

Yum!  I have made this twice and the second time omitted the parsley (I thought it was a bit too strong with it).  Top it off with a bit of cheese and serve with a salad and some bread and you have yourself a very nice winter meal :)

This is very good.  I made it because it was low fat!  Most creamy soups call for heavy cream or milk and lots of butter!!!!!  I should of used more broccoli or cauliflower because the soup was a bit watery.  I also added diced red pepper, along with the carrot and onion.  I would make this again!

I love that this soup is so filling and very calorie friendly! I wouldn't change a thing.  I'll stick with the recipe as is...I only added a 1/4 tsp. of Thyme, perfect! Cooked and pureed carrots together. Pureed in blender adding soup water as I went to achieve my desired consistancy.  So low cal/fat that you can top your cup with cheddar cheese...YUM!

Great way to use up leftover broccoli stems!  I sauted 2 minced garlic cloves in 2 T butter, added the nutmeg and 1/2 t salt.  Chopped the broccoli, cauliflower and carrot and put in pressure cooker for 10 minutes w/ the garlic, 4 1/2 c water and 1 cube vegi bouillon.  Even my 4 and 6 hear olds had seconds!  Beware using stems; they must be well peeled or will need to use a blender instead of a Braun.  DELICIOUS!!!

This soup was very healing for me.  The only changes I made were: used one veggie broth cube, flavored the cauliflower with my home made salt (lemon juice and zest,garlic,oregano,rosemary blended in hawaiian rock salt then dried in warm oven). I pencil shaved the carrots, cooked them separate and added after puree with immersion blender.  I wanted to share it with everyone I know so put some in the freezer for later.  Will make a double batch next time. I see that it is a good base for creative cooks to add their own flare.

Excellent soup - I was quite bored of the regular soups I've been making recently - this was quick and easy with a few minor adjustments. I had no nutmeg (I'm going to try it next time with it) I sauteed the onion first then added the garlic - I used 1 bag of frozen cauliflower and 1 bag frozen broccoli - I didn't do the carrot separately - I just tossed it in and pureed it together with the soup. The soup was creamy and real smooth. Water works just fine - I found I didn't need to add milk or chicken stock the flavor and texture came out great! (My husband took seconds)

I recently started a healthy living program and found this soup , with the low calories it is perfect for my diet. I love it! I followed the advice of others and added cayenne and used chicken broth rather than water. A definite keeper and nobody suspects it is low calorie.

Very good.  I veganized this soup by using homemade vegetable broth which I watered down to produce the amount of cups I needed.  After blending it, I added a touch of soy milk for more creaminess.  This is a 5 star recipe.

This is amazing!!  This is my first cauliflower soup and I absolutely love it!  I used chicken broth (4 cups), like another reviewer recommended but it made it a little salty, so I added some heavy whipping cream at the end to calm it down a bit.  I also omitted the carrots to keep it low carb and it's delicious!!

I didn't have any nutmeg so used pumpkin pie spice instead and added 1/4 tsp of tumeric.  It was lovely and fragrant.  I whirred it all up and then added the green onion, a can of creamed corn for a bit of sweetness and texture, and mashed potato flakes to thicken it up....spicy and slightly sweet and very hardy this winter evening.

Loved it! Made a few modifications. Used chicken stock instead of water and used up some leftover half n half.

Don't forget the nutmeg. It's a must!

It seemed more of a great broth than a soup. I added 1 cup of cream, and 2 cups of bacon to give it more consistancy. Tastes great... just not a very "thick" soup.

this is a great soup, i tried it with a cup of soy milk, but i think that's what made it not as good as it could have been. otherwise, i love the fact that the soup was CREAMY without milk. i boiled the cauliflower and the other vegetables all together. i removed the cauliflower, pureed it, then i just added it back to the rest of the pot. (drain out a bit of water, tad bit). the water you used to boil with has a nice flavor to it, and adding it with the pureed cauliflower makes it taste good.

Made exactly as printed but added mixed vegetables. Soup had no favor and looked terrible. I had one bowl as I took it for my lunch. My husband had one taste. This one went down the drain. Not worth doctoring up and trying again.

My husband made this with a few additions.  He roasted the califlower and carrots first.  Added  1 tsp curry powder and 2 tbsp of chicken boullion when saute the garlic.  Added 1 cup of cooked rice before he pureed the califlower.  Yummy!

Yum! I made this for our family right after my husband had braces put on his teeth, so I cooked the carrots in with the cauliflower and pureed the whole thing. The kids also love to drink soups like this through a straw! I think 1Tbsp flat leaf parsley is plenty.

Very smooth and very easy recipe.  Tastes too good to be a low fat, low calerie soup. I only used 4 cups of water and  I also added 1 tsp. of green curry paste which gave it some heat and added flavor.

I customized it to just grind up everything. I also added green onions, brocolli, carrots and celery in addition to the cauliflower. I threw in some additional spices like paprika, seasoning salt and turmeric in addition to the garlic, nutmeg and parsley. It was great!.

What a great little soup!  I didn't have carrots, so I sauted garlic, 1/4 c. onion & a stalk of celery then followed the recipe.  I loved it!

Very easy to make, but very bland. I added some curry for flavor.

This was great!  I used just about 5 cups water, and the consistency was perfect.  I sauteed a shallot w/the garlic, and left out the carrot and parsley, since I did not have any.  We added grated cheddar to each serving.

Pretty bland even though I used chicken broth instead of water.  After I added some mango chicken sausage, it was decent.

I agree with most of the other reviews.  Use less water, add some veggie boullion and feel free to add more seasonings:  I added summer savory and celery and also put in some powdered milk when blending for extra protein and creaminess.

Wonderful soup but it was too thin... just watch as you are making it & add only enough water to make it the consistancy you want it. Anyway... worth the shot, I will make it again but use less water or more cauliflower!

Great base. I made it with less liquid and I used chicken stock instead of the cubes of seasoning. I added cayenne - actually too much - so I boiled some potatoes and blended them into the soup with my heavy duty blender. I also added some parsley. As others have said, I cooked the carrots with the cauliflower and blending it all. It came out so thick and luscious- I would have sworn there was cream in it if I hadn’t made it myself.

This is a great base recipe, and like others, I made changes base on what I had on hand. I had most of a head of cauliflower, about a cup of broccoli, part of a leek, carrots and an onion. I added twice as much garlic to my taste, and used 2 c. vegetable stock and 4 c. no sodium chicken stock. I  found it a bit bland after pureeing the mixture, so I added a bit more salt (I used only about half to begin with) and 1/2 tsp curry powder. Delicious!

I don' t usually review with so many modifications, but truly this is a great jumping off point or to be made as written.

I was in the mood for soup and had some cauliflower in the fridge. This is a super-delicuous healthful soup. I made no adjustments and it turned out perfect.

I really liked this soup. I added some broccoli and celery to give it a little more crunch, but I tasted very nice. However, I will say that more salt was needed, and it is definitely not for anyone who likes thick soup. Overall, I would make it again.

On a side note, unlike some other reviewers, I would suggest cooking the onions and carrots separately like the recipe says. Not puréeing the carrots and onions gives the soup some color, and allows the flavor of the carrots to really pop.

Great soup! I also used 4 cups of water, but added some Greek yogurt which made it richer, and thyme for taste. I will definitely use this again!

I made this for my son.  He had his wisdom teeth removed and can't chew so I pureed everything.  It doesn't look very appetizing blended this way but it tastes pretty good.  Not amazing but it is good.

I took the advice of other reviewers and added only 4.5 cups of water and then a bit of chicken bouillon.  I also added white onions to the carrots and boiled until soft. (I didn't have any green onions) I love my soups smooth, so I pureed it all together.    This was delicious!  A healthy, yummy way to eat your veggies.

Really good basic recipe. I added 1/4 tsp. of tumeric and cayenne pepper and couple of teaspoons of powdered vegetable stock for more flavour. Used garlic powder instead of fresh garlic and added canned peas and carrots to the cauliflower puree. I also didn't add any green onions. The soup turned out really yummy!

Instead of salt, I added about a tablespoon of chicken bouillon and reduced the water to 4 cups for a 1.5 pound cauliflower head.  Skipped out on the parsley, but don't think I missed much - thought it tasted great!  Will probably add more carrot next time though.

As written this recipe is pretty bland.  I used about double the nutmeg, 1/8 tsp white pepper, 1/4 tsp tyme and blended with a hand blender when cooked. It was pretty tasty.  My 8 yr old said "  Mom, this is nice and light tasting" - ( I put a little shredded cheddar on top of hers)
