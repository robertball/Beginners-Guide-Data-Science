My family thought this was really good.  I did make a couple of changes - I substituted a jar of salsa for the diced tomatoes and added about 1/4 cup chopped green pepper.  I mixed the taco seasoning packet and about 3/4 cup water with the beef mixture (and heated it according to the taco seasoning directions) prior to adding the soup, salsa, and pasta in order to really get the seasoning flavor into the beef.  I also used shredded Mexican blend cheese, and mixed about half of the total amount of cheese I used (about 1 cup) into the beef mixture before spooning it into the casserole dish and topping with the remaining cheese.  I didn't feel the need to bake it for much longer than 10 to 15 minutes because all you really need to do at that point is melt the cheese since everything is already cooked.  Finally, I added crushed tortilla chips just prior to serving to ensure they remained crispy.

Made this for a girls weekend and although good, it wasn't spectacular.  So I tried, tried again....  2nd time around, added kidney beans for more fiber and cooked the meat in a combination of regular and hot taco seasoning with 3/4 cup minced onion, 2 tsp minced garlic and 2 tsp cumin, added a small can of chopped ortega chilis and 1/2 a small can of minced olives. Tried 1/2 soup and 1/2 salsa in place of whole can of soup to make it less sweet (much better).  Used 1 can Del Monte fire roasted tomatoes with garlic to give the casserole an extra boost.  Tripled the cheese and then divided it.  Took 2/3's of the cheese and melted it into the pasta and meat mixture and then assembled the remainder as written.  NOTE:  Do Not overcook the pasta - cook al dente as the oven will finish it off.  3 stars based on the recipe.  4 stars with the modifications....

Very good,with modifications!*LOL* I didn't have tomato soup on hand, so I added a cup of salsa and 2 diced roma tomatoes.I also added dashes of red pepper to add more spice! Instead of tortilla chips, I added chili and lime flavored Fritoes, YUM! I,too,sprinkled cheese before the layer of chips, then more cheese after the chips.  Baking time should be reduced to 15-20 minutes. Thank you!!

Thanks for a great recipe!  The macaroni gave it a fabulous twist.  My family of "expert" food critics LOVED it, particularly my finicky nine-year-old, who had two helpings.  I used a little more cheese and enough tortilla chips on top to cover the casserole.
NOTE:  After making this a few times, I've decided to heat the tortilla chips separately and put them on top of each individual portion.  This dish leaves lots of leftovers and soggy tortilla chips are not good.

Super good and super easy!  Just be sure and drain the cooked beef before adding the other ingredients.  I made my casserole as lowfat as possible by using very lean beef, lowfat tomato soup, and very little cheese.  The second time I made this, I added 3/4 cup chopped bell pepper, and what a difference it made in the color - turned out so pretty.  You don't need to bake it more than 15 minutes, or it tends to dry out.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

I chose this recipe because I had everything on hand and wanted something different for supper.  I made it per the instructions only adding some garlic and used a 28oz can of tomatoes as others said it tended to be dry.  We enjoyed it but these are the changes I will do the next time I make it.  I will cut the macaroni in half and add a layer of refried beans on the bottom, per another review.  I will use 2 pkgs of season mix, put in a layer of cheese and use salsa in place of tomato soup. I think the soup made it too sweet. It definately is a keeper and I would like to thank Debi for sharing it.

This is tasty and easy.  I made some changes:  I browned ground turkey and seasoned it with the taco mix and moved it to a big bowl.  In the same pan I sweat the onion until translucent and put it in the bowl with the meat.  I skipped the condensed tomato soup but to the bowl I added 1 can of Rotel Original diced tomatoes and green chilies and 1 can of southwestern jalapeno black beans with lime juice and only 4oz of cooked macaroni.  Mixed it all together - put in in the baking dish and topped it with cheese.  Just before it was done I added the tortilla chips and a sprinkle of some more cheese.  YUM.  This has a great kick - but isn't too spicy.

I'm a sucker for most casserole dishes, and I really liked this one. I used medium salsa in place of the tomatoes, and added a can of chili beans.  The chips don't stay crisp long after it comes out of the oven, but they are a nice crunch when first served. I also added a few shakes of hot taco sauce, because I like it.

Very good!  To give this a veggie boost, I added some canned kernal corn, and for spice, a couple of chopped jalepeno slices.  I reduced the cheese as well.  This is very good and I will most definitely make again.  Thanks.

As always, I read the most helpful reviews and then modify the recipe with the suggestions I like.  This was really good with some modifications of my own.  First, I used Tostitos Hint of Lime corn chips.  I crushed some in the bottom of the casserole dish and covered it with most of a can of nonfat refried beans to make a sort of crust.  Then I put in a layer of chopped cilantro - this really added to the flavor and color.  I fried the onion along with the beef, drained the fat, then added the taco seas. with water per packet directions.  I replaced the tomato soup with a can of Rotel.  I also added a can of pinto beans, can of corn, and small can of chopped green chilies. This way, it was really colorful, but it made a ton of filling.  I'll be using what didn't fit into the casserole as "taco soup".  I should have drained the cans first, because it came out really soupy, and I had to strain it anyway before I put it in the casserole.  I left the chips off the top until serving.  Baked it for only about 20 min. Topped with more crushed chips and sour cream, and Ole'!  Husband really liked it, and I had two servings.

I did season the ground beef with salt and pepper.  I also used Ro-tel instead of the diced tomatoes.  The can is smaller, so I added some salsa.  I also added corn and drained and rinsed black beans.  I always add lime juice, lime zest, sea salt, chopped cilantro and cumin to sour cream to make a sour cream dressing, so this was excellent on top of the servings! My 15 year old loves this!  I did top with Mexiblend cheese, baked and then topped with the crushed tortillas and a little bit more cheese and baked about 8 minutes.  will make it again soon!

I rated this recipe 5 stars however I made a few changes and added a couple of things. I'm sure someone will get angry because I didn't make it as described however that's the value of reading the reviews and customizing the recipe.  I didn't use tomato soup or the onions.  I cooked the ground beef just like the taco seasoning package suggested, then added 1 10 oz can of Rotel diced tomatoes and green chilis, chopped up 10 fresh cherry tomatoes, chopped cilantro and corn.  I tried to keep it mild for my children but flavorful for my wife and I. Also, I put a can of re-fried beans on the bottom of the baking dish followed by a layer of cheese. I put another layer of cheese on top, baked for 20 minutes and served with hot tortilla chips on top, lettuce, fresh tomatoes and olives.  Both kids actually had two helpings. It tasted like an upside down tostada. Definitely added to the dinner rotation.

Well when I first made this, I thought it was very good, and very quick.  I tried to stay as close to the original recipe as possible.  The only change was the crush chips, I did add them to each persons helping after cooking.   I have some picky eaters.  This was great and I have made it again and really you can adapt this based on what you have on hand, ex: Doritos for tortilla chips, Salsa for tomatoes etc, still great. My best comment is - this is a meal I love better as leftovers, I don't know if it is the flavors blending overnight , but super yummy the next day. Thanks!

Oh wow, this is amazing!  It's easy to make and so versatile, you can easily add the things that your family likes.  After reading some of the reviews and finding some things that I know we would love I made just a few changes. I spread a can of refried beans on the bottom of the pan before adding the beef mixture.  I used 2 pkgs. of taco seasoning mix, used our favorite salsa in place of the tomato soup, and put a couple of spoonfuls of cream cheese in the meat mixture once it was done browning.  I used mexican cheese and used more of it.  Instead of putting the chips in with the casserole, we just crushed fritos on top of the casserole on our own individual plates.  Casseroles with chips in them make the chips soggy for leftovers and this way we didn't have to worry about that.  We will be making this often!

This was really good and super easy.  I added a can of black beans and then a layer of sweet kernel corn on the bottom for added taste/color/nutrition. I also added a can of sliced jalapenos on top and used salsa instead of soup as previous reviewers suggested because my boyfriend likes things really spicy.. and I used blue corn chips for color.  It was delicious and made so much food we were eating on it for 3 days!

Made just as recipe stated, and everyone enjoyed it. Topped servings with shredded lettuce, sour cream and taco sauce. My husband said he'd prefer to put the chips on after the casserole was baked, so I'll do that next time. Easy, tasty and liked by everyone - a good weeknight meal.

This is a five star meal with the following modifications: 1. Cook the meat with the taco seasoning and 3/4 cup of water. Let the meat simmer and absorb the seasoning for five minutes or so.  2. After this I added the onion and additional ingredients.  3. I used a jar of salsa instead of the can of tomatoes.  I have four, young children and they loved this.

This is a fabulous casserole, and I'm always fascinated by simple ingredients coming together easily to create something the whole family loves.  I did make a few changes to the recipe--some are similar to suggestions made by other readers.  I doubled the recipe to fit comfortably in our large lasagna pan, but I'll use proportions here to reflect the original recipe.  I added 1/4 C. chopped cilantro (we love it, but it may not be to everybody's taste), plus 1 can of drained black beans to sneak in some veggies and wonderful texture.  I also added 1/2 C. mild taco sauce.  I found that crushing tostada shells to mix with the cheese worked great for the topping---and it wasn't too salty, as tortilla chips can be.  One tip, as with any pasta-based casserole, is to truly cook the macaroni to just the beginning stage of al dente--don't overcook it, as it can easily become mushy after baking.  This is a terrific recipe, easily adaptable to ingredients you have on hand, and it will be a family favorite for years!

I did change a few things as per previous reviews    Layered refried beans on bottom, added 1 can drained kernel corn, substituted rotel tomatoes for regular ones and I added 1/2 container of fresh salsa.   Served it with fresh broken tortilla chips on bottom of bowl when I served it with toppings of choice...sour cream, green onions, fresh guacamole and fresh salsa.  It was fabulous

Easy, filling and fast! The greatest plus, is my kids loved it!! This is definitely a keeper. Only thing I added to recipe is black beans, salsa instead of tomato soup. Crushed tortilla chips are better to me once dish is finished cooking, and you can add on top of individual servings instead of entire casserole. That way the dish always has that crunch. Sour cream topped it off. Yummy-yum.

Very good and quick to make! I think in the future I would only change one step: I cooked this for only my husband and me (intending to use leftovers for lunches). The tortilla chips were very good the first night we ate it. But by the time we ate it for leftovers, the tortilla chips were obviously soggy. Next time I will probably just put tortilla chips on the portions on our plate (it doesn't make a huge difference if you put them on the casserole as you're baking it the oven; when I eat leftovers, I just reheat a portion, and then add tortilla chips to the top).  A friend of mine suggested adding corn and kidney beans. I think I will try this next time.

Simple and tasty meal that the kids loved. I added a can of black beans and some corn to the meat. I did not use tomato soup, instead I added a can of diced tomatos with green chillies and 1/4 cup of salsa. Served with jalapeños and sour cream.  It will be one of those dishes I make to freeze ahead for a quick and easy meal.

Easy and tasted great. Of course I couldn't follow the recipe---cooked garlic with the burger and onions, used about 3 cups of macaroni, and used salsa instead of tomato soup. Also, brilliant idea from another review: crunch up the tortilla chips and nuke them, then sprinkle them on each serving. Only cooked this dish about 10 mins. Husband said I better make again!

We really didn't like this at all. It tasted like beef-a-roni with a little spice and it was not good. We ended up throwing most of it away. But we do not like beef-a-roni. Maybe this would be good withbeans instead of macaroni noodles.

Always read the reviews & they will help you adjust the recipe to your own taste.  This was very tasty!! Everything was in the pantry. NO  shopping. I used ground tky, 1 sm. onion chopped, med. shell pasta, 1 jar pace med salsa, 1 can med chilies, 1 can rotel tomatoes with peppers, taco seas. & threw a handful  of taco cheese in mixture while it simmered. Put it in a casserole with more taco cheese on top.  Baked only long enough for cheese to melt. 10 min.  Almost forgot.  Many complained how dry it was so I added about 1/2 cup water while it simmered on stove. Took it for lunch today & it was nice & moist. Thanks Debi!!! I will make this again & probably add corn

Yummy "as given"  but tweaked it just a tad:  added garlic, added cumin, added more cheese,  added canned corn, added kidney beans, omitted the chips, and  only used cheddar cheese, but still a wonderful recipe!!!  I used GF noodles.  It made a lot so we can use the sensational leftovers, which only get better with time.  Thanks a bunch!!

This was a good casserole dish.  My 15 month old devoured it; it was the quietest dinner we've had in a while!  I put a layer of chili beans mixed with rice on the bottom and topped that with some frozen corn before putting the meat/pasta mixture on top.  I used salsa in place of the diced tomatoes and mixed one cup of cheese into the meat and used one cup of cheese on top of the meat.  I sprinkled the chips on top after baking so as to avoid them getting soggy.

Big hit with family. I would do less tortilla chips on top next time, a bit too much taste with recommended amount.

The only changes I made were adding a drained can of whole kernel corn and 2 packs of taco seasoning.  It was great!  My husband and I looked forward to the leftovers.  Thanks for sharing.

I made this for 30 "starving" EMT's  in my daughters' rescue squad. Naturally, I tripled the recipe. I did add 2 cans of green chilies and one of the 3 taco seasoning packets was the "hot" variety. I am now their favorite cook and I've had 19 requests for this recipe. The aroma, alone, is to die for.  It was easy, super delicious and VERY well received!!  I'm making it tonight for DH and me and freezing half.  Thank you Debi!!

Yum!  As per some reviews I cooked the meat with onion and added green pepper, then added the taco seasoning with water as per directions to thicken.  I also used salsa instead of diced tomatoes and tossed in a can of black beans for an extra punch of fibre.  I baked with cheese on top and put the crushed chips on a cookie sheet for the last 3 minutes to toast then added them to each portion.  AWESOME!!  Even my 3 year old loved it!!  This is definitely being added to my regular dinner rotation.  I may toss in a can of corn next time for a bit more veg and a touch of sweetness.

Very good! A homemade Hamburger Helper of sorts!
Will probably use more ground beef next time just because we like a lot of meat. Used 3/4 can of tomato sauce rather than tomato soup and used 2 packets of taco seasoning. I also used 2 cups of taco blend cheese on the top. Topped serving with additional crushed chips, dallop of sour cream and scallions. Served with salad and rolls. Would be great potluck dish as an alternative to goulash.

This recipe was SO easy and SO delicious and made really great leftovers.  I did 2x the meat and 1.5x the pasta, added an extra taco seasoning packet and added 1 15 oz can of tomato sauce since it got a bit thicker.  It turned out WONDERFUL.  The only thing I would change next time is to do just cheese on the top, and scoop it up with fresh tortilla chips after it's cooked.  The tortilla chips baked on top turned a bit stale seeming when reheated.

I'm tweaking this tonigh by using shredded chicken and chicken taco seasoning.  I'm also using less sodium tortilla chips and an extra can of diced tomatoes while reserving the juice to add as needed.  I also used seasoned diced tomatoes with garlic, basil & oregano.  The other one was roasted garlic.  I think they're both by Hunt's. I used whole wheat macaroni and did the whole box to use whatever was left over for another meal.  For the cheese, I had Mexican shredded cheese on hand and it blended perfectly.  Some of us tossed it with sour cream, salsa, Tapatio and green onions.  This has become another family favorite!  :D Healthy & delish!  ;)

Delicious! I love casseroles (who doesn't? lol) I changed this ever so slightly to suit our tastes (left out the onions and used medium chunky salsa instead of diced tomatoes). Turned out delicious! For serving, I drizzled taco sauce along with sour cream. Yum yum yum!

My husband loved this casserole! He ate it three days in a row while I was out of town. I made it a little healthier using ground turkey and hand-shredding low-fat cheese - both sharp cheddar and monterey jack. I also added one can of drained black beans.

I made this recipe for my daughter's b-day party and everyone loved it and wanted the recipe.  Even my Aunt who doesn't like tacos had 3 helpings!  I will definitely be making this again.  The only thing I changed is that I tripled the serving and instead of 3 cans of diced tomatoes, I used 2 cans and then 1 can diced tomatoes with green chiles.  Gave it just a little kick!  Yum!

Not half bad.  I thought it would be like hamburger helper but it tasted better.  I used all cheddar which I mixed into the casserole before baking plus topped it with extra.  I didn't put the crushed tortilla chips on until it was out of the oven and I used the sour cream & drizzled hot salsa over the whole thing.  Pretty easy & hubby thought it was decent.

this recipe was pretty good, and definitely earns points for easy.  i did not bake it as a casserole, but topped the meat mixture in the skillet with the chips and cheese and just served it from the pan (which worked just fine).  i also subbed ground turkey but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  it tastes good, there's just nothing "out of this world good" about this recipe.  thanks!

This was absolutly fantastic!!! I did as some others and omitted the diced tomatoes and used about 3/4 jar of salsa instead.  I also mixed the soup, salsa, 2/3 cup of water and the taco seasoning into the meat as well as 1/2 the cheese and about a tbs of garlic salt and a bell pepper.  Then I mixed it all together and baked for about 15-20 minutes instead of 30...I topped with the cheese only and served lettuce, sour cream and crushed tortilla chips on the side.  My kids LOVED it...will DEFINATELY keep this one and make again! Thanks so much!

Surprisingly good with a few alterations.  I omitted the tomato soup and like others, added a jar of salsa instead.  Also used 2 cans of diced tomatoes.  The topping was crunchy and delicious.  My husband loved it.

This is a fabulous recipe.  I did, however, make two changes.  Instead of tomato soup I used salsa.  Also, I used diced tomatoes with green chilles.  This added an added spice to the dish.  Once reheating one may want to add more chips because they do not reheat well.  Really good choice for dinner.

LOVED IT!! This is such an easy and quick dinner for weeknights! I usually try to follow the recipe to a T, especially when it's my first time making it, however I did stray a bit...I used ground turkey instead of ground beef and added a can of Goya black beans for extra protein. I also took the advice of one reviewer and put a cup of the crushed tortillas on the bottom w/some cheese and baked it for 5 minutes, added everything else in, and then about a 1/2 cup on top with a little more cheese. I will definitely make this again! Thanks Debi Van Name!!

This was a great meal, but I made changes/additions after reading the comments.  I added a can of Rotel, added half a can of black beans, used fire roasted diced tomatoes, used a lot more cheese, and used Fritos instead of tortilla chips.  My teenaged son loved it!!!! Nice, hearty, and easy to make!

This recipe is fantastic! I make this about every 1-2 weeks. I add a layer of refried beans to the bottom of the casserole dish before adding everything on top and baking. It's so good!

I followed the advice of others and used some green chilis to liven the flavor up a bit.  Rotel but no tomato soup. It was okay.

This was really delicious.  I took it to a church luncheon so added some things to stretch it further -- green peppers, as others have suggested, and a can of black beans.  I skipped the tomato soup and used the diced tomatoes the recipe calls for plus a large jar of Newman's Own medium-spicy salsa with pineapple.  Everyone loved it.

I LOVE this casserole!  I am vegetarian and I use MorningStar ground beef and it has been very well-reviewed by meat lovers!  As others have said, the meat:macaroni ratio is off, so I use less pasta for each pound of meat.  I like things a little spicy so here are some things I've changed:  I use my own blended taco seasoning mix to cut the salt and add extra spice, I use salsa instead of canned tomatoes, and I throw in some fresh hot peppers from the garden or canned green chilis or jalapenos (whatever I have on hand).  I also like to serve this over a bed of lettuce to make it more like a hot taco salad.  YUM!

This recipe is reminiscent of Hamburger Helper nights when I was a kid.  If you love Hamburger Halper (like I do), you'll love this.  I definitely wouldn't serve it to company though, since it's pretty sloppy-looking.  I can not imagine it tasting as good without substituting the tomatoes for salsa.  The salsa adds a good depth of flavor and a little bit of heat.  While I love sour cream, this is much better without it.

I did alter this recipe a little by adding more cheese to the overall recipe (about 2 cups in all). I mixed 1/2 the cheese directly into the meat and noodle mixture and melted the rest on top of the crumbles chips. I also added some sliced black olives and sliced jalapeno peppers on top along with the green onions. The family LOVED it!

This recipe is a good base.  I couldn't bring myself to follow it exactly, however.  I used fresh tomatoes and not canned.  The four ounces of cheese wasn't enough to cover the dish.  Roughly ended up using 3.5 cups of cheese total.  And I also cooked the meat with the taco seasoning before adding anything else in.  I can't stand when the meat isn't seasoned properly.  Like I said, it was a good base, and overall wouldn't be bad as is.

This was pretty good and easy to make. Like someone else said, if you like hamburger helper you will like this. I find HH very salty, but this wasn't so I think this is better. It was good for leftovers as well.

Kid approved.  I used salsa instead of the can of tomatoes.  Both kids and husband liked it...so it considered a hit!  I used whole wheat pasta and low fat cheese and noone new the difference.  Thanks!

Very tasty. The only change I made was subbing the diced tomatoes with salsa. Added the chips the last 5 minutes but may add them sooner next time. Definitely will make again.

My husband loved this and even asked if he could take the leftovers to work for lunch the next day! Usually he just goes out to eat! I did make a few changes to the recipe after reading the reviews. I cooked the ground beef in the taco seasoning and onions like making tacos, and I used a can of diced tomatoes with chilies and peppers to add a little more flavor. I also added some black beans and olives to the top of the casserole with the tomatoes and onions to give it more of a nachos presentation. It looked superb and tasted amazing! Thanks for the recipe!

This is really good. Havent sat down to eat any of it yet, but took a bite and its yummy! :) Dont have any green onions, but will be using some sour cream and some shredded lettuce. Will be sending some with my hubby for lunch and some tortilla chips on the side so he can eat them like nachos. Thanks for this CHEAP and YUMMY meal!

UPDATE: My husband made me make this for him 2 nights in a row! Just wanted to share :)

Because I already have taco meat w/kidney beans prepared and frozen, this was super fast and easy to throw together.  
I added about a cup of taco cheese into the mix and then added about another cup on top.  I also had about a cup of leftover prepared macaroni and cheese I threw in there. 
It was really good and the whole family liked it.  It's a keeper.

This was Very Yummy, what a good idea for Taco lovers!!  My whole family LOVED it!  Super easy too.  I did NOT use the tomato soup or diced tomatoes as I didn't think it would be the right flavor for tacos, so I used a jar of salsa and 2 packets of taco sauce.  And I did not bake with the taco chips, I topped each serving with them (so they wouldn't get soggy).  Will definately make this again!!

Great recipe!  I subbed salsa for diced tomatoes and added a yellow bell pepper to the skillet with the ground beef and onion.  This smelled so good after everything was combined in the skillet that I had a hard time not eating it right then instead of baking it, lol!

I was disapointed in the crusty layer that forms on the top from the chips and cheese I think it would be much better with the chiips and cheese stired in.

Good entertaining recipe.  Tastes MUCH better the second day than the first (it was pretty bland the first day, actually).  Taco seasoning was too spicy for me, so I used a blend of that and paprika, which worked well.  As other reviews suggest, I added the tortilla chips only when serving.

Good recipe, I like the macaroni which adds another level of texture and gives it that extra something.  This recipe can be changed up by adding ingredients such as green chillies like I did, bravo

I made this recipe just as is and I thought it was very, very bland.  I even added salsa when I served it and it was still bland.  I would suggest adding other stuff as suggested by other reviewers if you want flavor.

Very tasty! We added sweet corn and black beans as two bottom layers like other comments suggested. Also used vegetable substitute meat instead of real ground beef. Overall that made it a very light, healthy and tasty dish! We only had to cook it about 15 minutes in the oven with those changes as well.

This was very tasty. My picky 4 year old kept telling me he loved it and ate a whole plate with no whining. I will definitely use this again!

We enjoyed this recipe. I agree with previous reviewers : you don't need to bake it for the full time. I think we baked for 20 minutes, just long enough to brown the cheese. I almost skipped the crushed chips on top, but I am glad I didn't since they add a great corn crunch that really works well with this casserole. We will keep this as a dinner option for busy nights. Oh, and I used ground chicken breast instead of beef. If you are used to ground chicken in other recipes, you will love it here. This is an easy, quick and tasty dinner. Thanks for the recipe Debi!

This was good.  The only change I made was that I used more cheese, and didn't add the chips.  I also only baked it for about 15-20 minutes.  My kids LOVED it and asked when I would make it again.  My husband liked it too, and he's not a big fan of tacos.  I'll definitely make it again.

When making this, we took MRSDAVIS' advice of switching salsa for the tomatoes.  Definitely an upgrade.  We also used 8oz of mexican cheese instead of the recommended 4oz.  Bake time was also pared down to about 15 minutes.  Great dish, but receives a four star rating because of our modifications.  Next time I plan on halving the amount of soup and adding enchilada sauce.

Easy recipe to make.  I didnt have macaroni noodles on hand, so I used egg noodles and it worked out well.

I wouldnt add the chips until right before serving as well.  That way their still crispy.

Overall a great recipe!

Super easy.  Everyone went back for seconds.  I cooked the meat according to the directions on the taco seasoning packet, adding a little more mexican seasoning, and used the diced tomatoes with green chiles.

This was so good.  I was on here looking for a good mac and cheese recipe(didn't find what I'm looking for yet)but I did find this one! In 3 weeks I fixed this one twice but I added a layer of refried beans. And then I thought why not chile.  so I use chile seasons and chile beans  Loved it.  Great recipe  Thanks

This was requested by my mexican food loving husband.  I was dubious at first (mexican with pasta - never heard of that before) but this was amazing and so easy (not to mention cheap!) a real winner in my books. This will go on to my meal rotation card file for sure!! p.s. did add a can of kidney beans for extra fibre and protien

This is one of those great recipes that calls for ingredients you probably already have on hand. And its one of those that you can add extras to as well (black beans, corn, etc.).

My family loved it. I omitted the tortilla chips on the top and instead crushed them into bowls and then put the casserole on top.

added lots of extras, corn, black beans, little bit of minced garlic and green chilis.  I substituted ground beef for lean turkey.  Topped with sliced avocado, sour cream, celantro and black olives.  Husband ate two servings, and even the kids enjoyed.

My grandson and I loved this recipe but I made a few changes after reading the other interviews. I used a bit less than 8 oz. of pasta and increased the Taco Mix to 1 1/2 packages to make the casserole less bland. In addition, I used Fritos rather than tortillia chips to add more variety.

This tasted really good.  I made a couple of modifications; I am vegetarian, so substituted a package of griller crumbles for the beef, and also added a can of corn to the mix.  I didn't give this 5 stars because I had some difficulty with the measurements in the recipe.  For instance, I had taco seasoning in a can (had to take extra effort and time to figure out how much is 1.25 oz?  would have been easier to read X number of teaspoons or tablespoons). It would have been easier as well to just be told 1/2 cup of grated cheese, instead of 2 oz, for those who don't have a measuring scale and who don't use the grated cheese out of a bag (thankfully, I had the bag to help do the measurements, as there were 12 oz in the bag).  Also I had this question - are the tomatoes supposed to be drained or undrained? (I drained them).  Overall, because it was a great tasting casserole, I will definitely make this again.

Extra cheese was a nice addition.  Might try chunky salsa in lieu of chopped tomatoes for added zip, but this is a great dish for potluck dinners!

My husband absolutely loved this.  I added a can of refried beans to the bottom of the baking dish, then layered the other stuff over it.  I'll be making this again soon, with a lot more chips on top, per the hubby's request.  Thanks for this recipe.

Very tasty!  But if you want the cheese to be melty and gooey, I would wait to sprinkle it on until the last 10 minutes or so.

Made it tonight first time for family - such a big hit - thank you!
Just looked over some changes from other cooks and just might try a few like salsa and not cooking in oven that long and the Mexican cheese blend - but it was simply yummy we all had seconds!!!!

Just made this recipe tonight and it was fabulous! We used about 1.25 lb. of deer meat and just increased everything else just a little to accommodate. We actually used the Taco Seasoning I that is on this site and it was REALLY good. This recipe is truly amazing JUST like it is written, but it's also a recipe that sparks some ideas like adding black beans or refried beans, maybe using Doritos if you're making for kids or teens, or adding some guacamole just before you serve. We took it out of the oven, added a little more shredded cheese, poured on some salsa, a spoonful of sour cream, then the green onions. (Wish I'd taken a picture.) We will definitely make this again! So easy and yummy! :) Hubby and kids loved it, too!

As a senior citizen, living alone, I am always looking for simple recipes.  Casseroles are good because I freeze in individual servings.

That said, DID NOT like this recipe at all.
I am not a fan of using canned soups in recipes because they contain too much sodium.  
The tomato soup doesn't work.  It's too sweet.

I would not recommend this recipe.
However, I am a good cook.
This is probably a good recipe for people who are learning to cook and is pretty fail-safe.
So....that's my story and I'm stickin' to it.   Happy eating.  ;-)

OMG SOO TASTY!!! This is probably the most flavourful casserole I have ever made! .... But I did a few things different. I added old El Paso taco sauce (about 1/2 cup) in the beef while frying, that gave it a little spice. I also switched the tortilla chips for BBQ flavoured corn chips, the face the casserole a zest bite. Made this

This is sooo good. Instead of cheddar cheese, I used a fiesta blend with many different Mexican cheeses. Its really good if you mix it up with sour cream and scoop it as a dip on tortilla chips instead of eating it with a fork. Next time I will try and add black olives to it.

This is a good "starter" recipe in my opinion, meaning it might be better if you add a few additional items you like in your tacos! I liked it, my husband liked it, but in the end it just seemed like it was missing something. I keep looking at the ingredients to see if I skipped something. I did substitute fresh diced tomatoes for canned, but that's it.

Very good, followed suggestions from others and a few of my own.  I drained the ground meat and onion mixture after browning.  I added the taco seasoning and 3/4 cup of water to the meat and onion mixture.  I substituted a 16 oz jar of mild salsa for the diced tomatoes.  I used 1 3/4 cup  ditalini pasta.  I didn't have elbow macaroni.  I mixed it all together, placed it in a 9x13 baking dish, and  topped it with 3/4 cup shredded cheddar cheese.  I baked it for 15 minutes.  I added broken pita chips to each serving.  They gave it a nice crunch on top.  It tasted like a taco!  I will make this again.

I thought pasta and chips in a casserole were a strange combination, and I was right.  We will not be making this again.  We only ate the tortilla chips with the casserole after baking, but it was just too weird.  A lot of carbs in a small amount of food, too!  I think the tomato soup made it too much like a box or dinner, and probably contributed to an overall mellow flavor.  I used diced tomatoes with green chiles,  but it was still not very flavorful.

This was okay, but probably not a recipe I'll make again.  I believe it was the tomato soup that threw it off for us.  And even with the taco seasoning in the meat mixture....still was missing something.  Thanks for sharing the recipe, though.

I thought this was pretty good! I would add a little bit more taco seasoning I didn't get much of that taco flavor. I also nixed the tomatoes and onions and green peppers. I also added cheese in the actual casserole itself and on top, i used the mexican fiesta blend. As many others said I put the chips on last but on INDIVIDUAL servings. I would love to add black beans but my hubby was not feeling it. Those of you with kids, my step daughter who hardly eats LOVED it!

Made this last night only doubled the recipe so my retired hubby could have plenty of leftovers.  I made as is except I used a cup of extra sharp cheddar and 1 cup of colby/monterey cheese shredded...store didn't have monterey shredded...Perfect otherwise...I didn't add sour cream either but added plenty of green onions.  This one's a keeper!

A little spicy for kids, but good flavor overall.  I think I would use a little less of the seasoning packet next time.

Lovedit, with a few minor alterations. I substituted ground turkey. Only added 3/4 the can of tomato soup, and I added 3/4 of a 16 oz. jar of mild salsa. I also added about 7 ounces of water. In addition, I mixed 4 oz. of Colby jack cheese into the meat and pasta mixture on the stove, as well as a small amount of fennel seeds and cumin. After pouring into the baking dish, I mixed the crushed chips with another 4 oz. of Colby jack and topped the dish with that.baked for 20 minutes, then turned on the boiler for one minute for extra crispness on top. Will probably try Fritos in place of tortilla chips next time.

Update: I made it again, better this time. I cooked the pasta just short of al dente. I omitted the tomato soup and substituted 16 oz of mild salsa. I mixed one package of taco seasoning with 3/4 cup water per the directions on the package and let thicken. Then I added in the tomatoes and salsa, plus a bag of frozen mixed vegetables (corn, peas, carrots, green beans). I then added in a bit of cumin and an additional half packet of taco seasoning (low sodium). Then I mixed all of that with the pasta and 1 cup cheese. Poured into dish, topped with another cup of cheese, and baked for 20 minutes. Each person topped their own with crushed low sodium fritos. Next time I'll use the full 2 packets of seasoning but other than that it was great.

My husband LOVED this!  I omitted the pasta because I had some left over Mexican rice.  I did as others had suggested and added minced garlic to the meat and onions as it was browning.  Then, I added the taco seasoning and 1/4 cup of water.  I used drained Rotel and drained corn as well, heated it through.  Taste at this point; you can add seasoning here if you want: salt, red pepper flakes, cayenne....  I added 1/2 c. cheese that other reviewers suggested then went into a casserole dish.  I sprinkled some cilantro and chives from my garden, the crushed taco shells and 1 c. shredded cheese.  My husband couldn't stop raving about it!

I used a jar of sauce instead of tomato soup, otherwise I stuck to the recipe.  It was such a hit with my 9 yr old that he asked to eat the leftovers the next day and asked for me to make it again a couple of days later.

This is okay at best.  It is pretty much Hamburger Helper without the box.  I made no variations to the recipe at all and if I ever decided to try to make it again, it would need a serious flavor overhaul.  I would suggest a can of Rotel or salsa instead of the plain diced tomatoes. And maybe plain tomato sauce instead of the tomato soup.  (The soup makes it a little sweet for my taste.) And I would also recommend either adding more cheese to the top or to cover with aluminum foil before baking.  The cheese melted to the tortilla chips creating a crunchy shell on the top that did not mix into the rest of the casserole. The plus side, though, was that my kids seemed to enjoy it.  Despite that fact, this won't be in our regular meal rotation again any time soon.

This recipe was very good.  My picky kids loved it.  It says it serves 10 but the 7 of us -  2 adults and 5 kids ate almost the whole pan.  I will definately make this again.  I also added a clove of garlic, salt and pepper to the ground beef mixture.

I changed this up a bit (surprise, surpise)... I used ground chicken instead of beef, and used a can of tomato sauce instead of tomato soup. I also added about 6 oz of cream cheese to the mixture to make it creamy. I decided to serve the tortilla chips on the side instead of crushed on top - and put 2 cups of colby jack cheese over the pasta/meat/sauce mixture. Basically, when I was done, it resembled chili mac, but it was really really good.

Very tasty and a big hit with the kids.  I subbed ground turkey for the beef and used only cheddar, but added more than the recipe called (about 2 cups).  Also used more than 1 cup of crushed chips.

I also added my own "flair" as some other reviewers.  I cooked the meat with taco seasoning from the beginning.  Once drained I added green peppers, corn and 1/2 can of green chili's into the meat mixture (on top of what the recipe stated), but  used salsa instead of tomato sauce.  I put a can of chili beans on the bottom of the casserole dish and then added the mixture on top.  VERY yummy :)  My honey is going back for 3rd's as we speak!

I absolutely love this recipe!  My family and friends really enjoyed it.  Normally I have tons of left over when it comes to food in general but I found my daughter asking for seconds.  My bfs friend was over and could of just ate the whole thing on his own.  I did add the cheese and chips at the very end so that the chips wouldnt get soggy.  It gave the dish the crunch it needed.  A total hit.

This recipe is a delicious base to a taco casserole! My family likes to add two cans of kidney or refried beans and use to top a salad. We use more ground beef with out a problem; and we add the chips at the end so that they remain crispy and don't seem stale.

We enjoyed this casserole. However I used beans instead of tomatoes and would omit the chips on top. I revised the recipe in Taco Mac Casserole with adding beans and using tortillas as a layered casserole.

Very good!  Made exactly as shown.  I think next time I'd use diced tomatoes with green chilies, and mix cheese and chips throughout and then top with more cheese.

This casserole reminded me of my "fiesta macaroni" I like to make, which is essentially macaroni and cheese with salsa and beef.
I follow the directions except added 2 taco seasoning packages instead of just 1, and black beans as well as Mexicorn.  I think next time I will use my own seasoning mix, which is why I gave 4 stars instead of 5.
However, my husband who was licking the plate clean, thought this was definitely a 5 star meal!

We loved this! I used suggestions from other reviews, using salsa instead of soup & tomatoes, adding a can of corn for some veggies. I layered the cheese and chips twice, starting with the cheese. Baked for 15 minutes. Crunchy chips and cheesy goodness makes for a great meal.

EXCELLENT! We loved it. 
Instead of beef I used ground turkey which didn't make any difference at all (except maybe less calories). The recipe says it's 10 servings. Well if you're going to have 10 guests, you better double the recipe because everyone will want seconds, or even thirds. And did I say it was EXCELLENT?

The cheese bacho crust of top was almost uneat able. The meat mixture it self was tastless. Would have had to add at least three taco packs to give it a kick. Won't even bother messing with it.

I doubled the recipe and used 1 can tomatoes(slightly drained) and some salsa. Also 1lb beef and 1 can chili beans. I used 2 cups of cheese which I put half on top of the noodles and the other half on top of the chips as directed in the recipe. The cheese on top of the chips turned extremely hard and crunchy(didn't care for that). Overall it was good and would probably make again. Good w/ sour cream.

My family is a big fan of tacos, but I was getting tired of the same old thing. Everyone really enjoyed this recipe. Next time I make this I will mix the cheese into the casserole instead of putting the cheese on top because it got a bit hard. I also used taco cheese and used 2 cups. I was afraid the chips would be too crunchy as i am feeding a 3 year old but they blended really well, and never noticed them except for the taste! Thanks for sharing!

My husband and I both LOVE. this. I added a can of corn and nixed the onions, though. Also I don't bake the chips on top, as there are always plenty of leftovers and I don't want to eat it with soggy chips the next day. Instead I serve it on top of or with fresh chips. Overall I was surprised with how such a simple dish could taste so great!

It is so good. It isnt very taco-ie but it is like an amped up goulash. It is delicious. I would recommend not adding the chips and adding the sour cream after its cooked. And it says 30-35 minutes but it was done at about 20. Just keep a watchful eye. It is delicious!!!

My husband and son's liked this dish, but I wasn't as crazy about as they were. The guys spent the next day using it like a dip for the remaining chips we had. I may like it a little better with rice instead of macaroni....

We really liked this one.  I prepared the casserole during the kids' nap time and put it in the refrigerator until my husband was on his way home. It worked out great and it was very tasty. Didn't change anything.

Fantastic.  I made a few changes: Rotel chili and lime tomatos + 1/2 cup of salsa in place of the diced canned tomatoes.  I also used grated Mexican cotija cheese in place of the Monterrey Jack.  My husband, who generally doesn't like Mexican food, ate three bowls and suggested this would be a great casserole to take to family functions.

I am giving it 4 stars because I did modify the recipe, but not much.  I used salsa instead of the tomatoes and added corn and black beans.  I also topped it with fritos. This was really good!!  My family really enjoyed it and I am sure that it will be a new favorite.

Great casserole.  I was a bit skeptical at first but this came together very nice.  I took advice from a few reviewers and added a can of kidney beans and some cheese to the beef mixture.  Also, sauteed a green pepper in addition to the onion with the beef.  Also, added about a tsp of cumin and peprika to the beef mixture.  Baked for about 30 minutes (covered in foil for majority of baking).  Add crushed Tostitos Hint of lime and sour cream.  Delicious!!

Super easy to make!!! Next time I will make it with ground turkey burger, and add corn and black beans and add the chesse throughout the casserole instead of on top. I haven't eaten it yet and I already know it is going to be delicious, my mouth is watering as we speak!

I was skeptical to try this recipe, but it is very tasty. My husband and I went to town on this one! I took the advice from another review and cooked the meat with the taco seasoning and water, then added the tomato concentrate and diced tomatoes. Very good - we kept going back for more.

I only baked it for 15 minutes because everything was already cooked. I thought this was yummy dish that the whole family liked. Next time though, I think I will mix some cheese in with the meat mixture. Instead of just on top.

FANTABULOUS! I added 2 packets of seasoning instead of one, used the mexican/taco blend cheese and didn't put the corn chips on the casserole; instead used them for 'scoopers'.  We will definitely be making this again...and again...and again. Pretty quick and easy. Thank you Debi Van Name for the recipe!!!!

I made a few changes so I can't comment on the original recipe but what I did turned out great.  Instead of tomato soup, I used half a jar of medium salsa.  In place of canned tomatoes (I hate how slimy they are), I diced two fresh vine tomatoes.  I browned the meat with the onions, drained the grease, added a little bit of water and the taco seasoning packet and let it simmer for a couple of minutes.  Then I stirred in the salsa and the pasta and let it all simmer together for about 3 minutes.  Then in went the fresh tomatoes for about another minute and I threw in a handful of cheese and cooked until it melted.  From there I followed the directions for putting it into the casserole dish but only cooked it for 20 minutes.  In the future, I think I will actually stop short of making it a casserole.  The meat mixture with the cheese was great on it's own right from the stove.

MMMM!   This was awesome!  The entire family loved it, the only thing I added was in the diced tomatoes I bought they had jalepeno peppers in the tomatoes.  Plus the green onions, it had some kick to it!  LOVED this recipe.  Thank you.

This recipe is excellent, I made a couple of changes i added salsa instead of tomatoes, and a pack of taco seasoning to meat, and the best idea i had was to not use tortilla chips and instead use frito lays scoops, they dont get soggy and taste great. Enjoy!!

This was delicious.  I doubled the recipe, and it was just as good reheated.  I used shredded shard cheddar with the monterey jack.  This recipe is perfect in our opinion and I will make it again and again. Thank youn for sharing it.

This worked pretty well, it was really kid-friendly as well! (except for the tomato chunks). We even had to make our own taco-seasoning from scratch...

Made this on a cold night when I had no idea what to have for dinner.  I used a can of Rotel instead of diced tomatoes because that is what I had on hand.  I also added a few spoonfuls of picante sauce and some black olives.  I used a taco seasoning from this site and cooked it with the meat like I would for tacos.  Mixed some cheese in the mixture.  Did not put chips on top but did serve with chips.  The whole family liked it.  Will make it again.

My family LOVED this. I added a can of corn and a can of black beans to the recipe and I think nex time I will add a can of diced chilis or maybe use diced tomatos with chilis included for a little extra spice.

I used another person's suggestion and used a 16-oz. jar of salsa in place of the canned tomatoes and omitted the onion. The salsa gave it just the right kick! [I also omitted the crushed tortilla chips & green onion.]

I just made this again, and didn't have a can of diced tomatoes, so I used diced tomatoes w/chipotle. It was a hit!

We didn't care for this one.  I think it was the noodles.  I guess we prefer a taco casserole with tortillas instead of pasta.  Something about the taco seasoning taste with the noodles was a little odd.

Pretty good casserole if you're bored with the typical mexican food. I had left over macaroni and taco meat, so this worked out well! I didn't have any tomato soup, so I used salsa and skipped the tomatoes also. Instead of regular taco seasoning, I suggest taco seasoning1 from this site.

Really good! Really quick! Really easy! And I did it just like the recipe said (but I did use Mexican style diced tomatoes since I didn't have the other and I did put chips as I was serving it since I'm NOT a fan of soggy chips! )! Even my SUPER picky 3 year old niece ate it and half the time she chooses NOT to eat. She kept saying yum! yum! yum! and This is super delicious!! This is a keeper.

This was really quick and good and I had most of the ingredients on hand.  I used whole wheat pasta, one can of tomato soup, and one can of rotel.   I used frozen onion, and one package of taco seasoning.  As an extra kick, I added black and red pepper (we like it spicy) and extra cheese.  I used 12 oz of Mexican Blend cheese.  I stirred half of the cheese in the beef mixture, with the remaining 6 oz on top.   I baked this in the oven for 20 minutes and added the crushed chips as I served my family, with extra chips and salsa on the side.

This was EXCEPTIONAL. But, I did not have taco seasoning so I used a bunch of spices at home instead, it worked, and I did not put the chips on at the end. I also used whole wheat penne pasta instead of macaroni. I used salsa instead of tomatoes like others did. But when all was said and done this was soooo good.

As one of the reviewers said, I was also pretty skeptical of this dish -- pasta with Mexican?  But because of all the great reviews -- especially by all those folks who said their picky kids like it, I tried it.  And guess what?  My husband, me and both kids (ages 5 and 3) really loved it!  I took the advice of others and added a cup of salsa and 1/2 cup of water, and baked for only 15 minutes.  It was great!  I'll definitely make it again.

I really enjoyed this recipe and my family thought it was good.  Next time, I may add another 1/2 packet of taco seasoning and I added more cheese than called for.  I'm glad I did.  Any less would have been too little.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  Think of it as gourmet Hamburger Helper.  The sour cream and green onions really topped it off.  It would have been missing something without it.  I will definitely be making this again.

Well,I made some changes but the concept is there.  I used ground turkey breast instead of beef. Cream of mushroom soup and salsa, brown rice intead of macaroni. Served it with crisp tortillas. Also i added corn and jalopenos I used the concept. It's really good known the less and i'll make again.

Based on the reviews I read, I had altered mine a little and used crushed Fritos instead of tortilla chips and I also did thin layers on the top w/ fritos, cheese, fritos, cheese. I didn't use the green onions and I served w/ a jar of El Paso Taco Sauce to drizzle over the top.

Very good, and so easy.  Even hubby liked it...and he isn't easy to please!  I did add 1/2 can water to tomato soup and it wasn't dry at all.

I'll spice this up a little next time, and add the cheese in the last 5 minutes of cooking, as it burned onto the chips.  Other than that an easy fix for those nights when you just don't feel like cooking.

I loved this, hubby was indifferent, so 5 stars from me...by the end of the meal he said it was growing on him.  I added 1 cup frozen corn and 1 can black beans and it was great.  I also used lean ground turkey (98% lean) instead of ground beef to make it healthier, and used 2% milk cheese.  We didn't have any sour cream so I added some fat free cottage cheese to mine to cool down the spice a little.  Makes a ton!  Enough for at least 4 meals for 2 people.  Very goulash-like in consistency.

This recipe was ok.  We call it Taco Goulash at our house.  I would make this recipe again in a pinch, since most of the ingrediants I usually have in the pantry.  I didn't seem to have any problems with it being too dry, and I did not use the chips on top.  It makes quite a bit for just two people, and chips to not heat back up well.

Great, easy recipe!  I have picky eaters and they ate it too, including myself!  I used the DelMonte Petite Cut Tomatoes with Jalapenos and it wasn't too hot for the kids.  Actually, I didn't think it was hot at all.  I also put some cheese under the chips and some on top.  And I only baked it for 20 mins which was plenty of time for melting cheese.  I think 30 mins would be too long and maybe that's why some turn out dry.

Delicious! I read other reviews and added a few items. I added a cup of corn kernels, 2 tbsps of jalapenos, a handful of cheese, and a tbsp of fresh garlic. Very good! I didn't add the crushed chips because my man comes home late at night and the other reviews said the chips didn't reheat well.

I am a vegetarian, my husband is a big meat eater... I substituted Boca burger for the meat and until I told him, my Husband said he couldnt tell the difference :) (this may be because of all the extras I added)

EXTRAS:
*instead of diced tomatoes I used diced tomatoes with jalepenos

*instead of 1 can of soup, I used 1/2 soup 1/2 salsa ( a little extra of either wont hurt :)

* I added cheese to the mixture as well, 4 oz was not enough

* I only cooked it for 12 minutes, then added the chips only on the portion I thought we would eat and then cooked for another 5 minutes 
(I froze the rest and it easily reheated)

* if I had cooked for 30 minutes like the recipe said it would have been very dry

I was very surprised at how easy this  recipe was
when I reheated it I did add corn, put it in taco shells and my husband loved it

This one is a keeper. My family loved it! I made a few changes and used ground turkey instead of beef and added some jalapeno peppers to spice it up a bit. I was really leary about this one but they love it. And the leftovers are just as awesome. To freshen up the leftovers we've just added a few more crushed chips. This will definately be on the menu when tacos aren't exactly what we're looking for.

This is a perfect weeknight dinner with a salad.  My kids (ages 5 and 1) and my husband all loved it!  
It made a good amount which I love for leftovers, I thought it reheated well.  
I have used both the tomoto soup and tomato sauce (depending on what I had on hand at the time) and both tasted great.

This was just what I needed for a quick meal when my son brought a friend home for dinner.  I didn't have tortilla chips so crushed taco shells on the top and it was great.  Also used only about 6 oz. macaroni.  Everyone loved it.

This recipe is definitely a "keeper"!  Two out of three boys ate this and liked it.  I added a can of mild Rotel diced tomatoes instead of plain, and it added just enough kick to satisfy my crowd of eaters.  The youngest thought it was too much kick though, so if you have really young ones, stick to the recipe.  I also only had to heat in the oven for about 15 minutes instead of 30.  This kept the casserole from drying out, and was long enough to melt the cheese.  Thanks for adding something to my recipe file!

My fiance and I are both college students, buying a house and busy packing things, and we don't have much time to grocery shop lately! We wanted something besides frozen pizza or hot dogs, plain Mac and Cheese! But-the only things I had available to cook with were: half a box of elbow macaroni (about 8 oz) 1 lb of ground beef,1 can of tomato soup, and taco seasoning, no shredded cheese, so I improvised used a can of Frito Lay Mild Cheddar cheese chip dip, and crushed up some taco shells for the topping! My fiance loved it! Thanks for a simple easy recipe!

Really enjoyed this dish. Did not have tomato soup on hand so I used a  small can of tomato sauce and rotel Tomatos. 
Also just saw pioneer woman add a little cream to a similar dish so I did that too-added richness. As other reviewers suggested I added cheese before the chips and on top too! 15 minutes was perfect!

I think that is does taste good, I think that it would taste better with rice instead of the noodles. I am gonna try it again with a yellow rice.

Being that I didn't have tomato soup or can tomatoes in the house, I used a jar of thick and chunky salsa instead. It came out perfect!  This is definitely a keeper recipe for my family.

I used Rotel instead of diced tomatoes. I also used extra cheese and only baked for 15 minutes. It was a big hit with my family. Great week night meal.

I made quite a few a alterations due to previous suggestions.  I swapped the soup and tomatoes for salsa and so I only used half a packet of taco mix.  I added corn and black beans and black olives.  I also layered the cheese and chips (love cheese).  Since the pasta was done and my corn thawed it only needed 20 or so minutes in the oven.  Turned out great!  My daughter and I love it!  Add a little sour cream and taco sauce if you prefer, but it is delicious on it's own.

This was a very simple recipe to make, my 9 and 5 year old did most of the work.  The only changes I made to the recipe is I used the taco seasoning recipe that can be found on this site vs the package mix. Also, I didn't move the mixture to a 9x13 as I hate doing dishes.  I turned this into a 1 pot meal by cooking everything in my deep oven safe skillet.  I think next time I shall try adding kidney or pinto beans and possibly some corn to make it a true one pot meal.  Thank you  for the recipe it is going into our Taco Tuesday rotation.

You know, sometimes you just want a quick, easy, bellyful of comfort food - and this fits the bill perfectly. I always cook a new recipe exactly the first time so I know how the base dish is supposed to taste. I was skeptical about the tomato soup, but used it anyway. I thought the recipe is really good even  without much tweaking. So, I'm giving this recipe 5 stars - not because it's the most delicious gourmet dish I've ever tasted, but because it delivers exactly what it intends to: a tasty, flavorful, quick, easy, satisfying, inexpensive meal. Most of the ingredients are pantry staples, and the dish is extremely flexible. Can't wait to try some of the other reviewers' recommendations. Crushed Fritos on top? Yes please!

Made this tonight with my own twist. Browned 2 lbs of ground beef.  While that was draining I sautéed 1/2 of a diced onion then added the ground beef back to it. I then used 2 packets of taco seasoning and 1 cup of water and let it simmer for a minute. When the beef mixture was hot I added 1 15.5 oz jar of salsa and one regular can of diced tomatoes with green chiles. I warmed that up a bit and added 8 oz of cooked elbow macaroni then spread it in a 13 x 9 pan. I mixed in a bit of shredded cheese and topped it with chopped black olives and more cheese. Baked at 400 for about 20 min and it was perfect! Serves with salsa, sour cream and tortilla chips on the side. Hubby loved it!!!!

As written, I would give it 2 stars...very pasty and bland for our taste. The next time I traded the salsa for the tomato soup, and substituted crushed corn chips and Doritos' for the macaroni and added 1 cup of frozen corn along with extra seasonings, (cumin/chili powder/garlic) to the hamburger and layered it all. Added a side salad for the greens/veggies and it was a hit all around. More snap, not as sweet or pasty this way.

Great recipe! I made a few minor modifications to fit what I had on hand, but stuck pretty much to the core recipe. First I added a can of Rotel instead of tomatoes...gave it a bit more of a kick. Second, I added the crushed tortilla chips to the bottom of the dish and covered them with a layer of shredded cheese, before spooning the meat and sauce on top. Baked for about 15 minutes to melt the cheese and it turned out great! Just enough spice and tons of flavor! Will definitely make again!

A solid recipe. Next time I will cook the beef in the taco seasoning - to get the flavors to blend a bit more. It was really good reheated as well.

You can modify it if you want, but we isn't, and it was excellent as is. There's really no need to modify, unless you want to for your tastes. It is tasty an easy. My two favorite things!

Very good recipe and would definitely make again.   I added some cumin, garlic powder, black beans, and mild green chiles to the mix.  It doesn't need the whole 30 min to bake.  Next time I will add the crushed tortilla chips on top at the end after the dish is done for more of a fresh crunch.

We really like this recipe.  I also took the opportunity add extra veggies.  I chopped up celery and added some corn in with the onions.  It had a nice little kick to it you didn't expect.

I used a half jar of taco sauce, rather than tomato soup, which added some extra flavor and a bit of a kick. Serving sour cream helped to tame the very mild kick for my kiddos, so it was perfect for the whole family.

This was a very simple recipe that I really enjoyed.  I did make a few adjustments as others have recommended.  I made the hamburger with taco seasoning as directed on the seasoning package.  I didn't use tomato soup, rather a can of mexi corn and Rotel.  I also chopped up fresh cilantro in the dish and added double the cheese to the top.  I baked for about 15-20 minutes and then added a some torilla chips with a hint of lime, sour cream, and a touch of fresh salsa.  Yummy!  I will definitely make this easy dish again and look forward to leftovers tomorrow!

This was pretty good. my changes: I added a lb. of sausage with the gr. beef.I added cans 1 each of pinto & bl. beans. used 15oz. tomato sauce and can diced tomatoes with mild chilies. hubby said he liked the macaroni, but not the chips, but he likes noodles. I only did the chips cause I had them. I read the reviews after so I might make other changes. I did use 16oz. of macaroni. this is how I usually make things. thanks

This is a decent recipe. Overall the taste was good. 

Some changes I made: more seasoning. The condensed tomato soup is fairly plain, it is in desperate need of seasoning. If I had salsa I probably would have used it. I added a can of pinto beans to pump up the recipe. Beef, cheese and pasta sounded far to plain alone. I substituted fresh chopped tomatoes over the canned diced. I also browned onions and green peppers in olive oil on the stove top before adding it to the mix. I feel there is no need for 2 different types of cheeses. A taco cheese blend will work just fine. After draining the pasta I returned it into my large pot and added the sauce mixture on top of it and mixed all the ingredients together (including the cheese) before putting it in the 9x13 inch pan. As others have suggested I added only some chips to the top with more cheese. I added more fresh chips right before serving so they would maintain their crunch.

In the end after trying it this once I would add some type of spicy ingredient (this recipe is severely lacking in that department) and switching from the pasta to rice. The macaroni did not mesh well with the crunch of the chips in my opinion.

I am a busy dad learning to cook. This came out great.  Mother-in-law took home extra for Lunch the next day.  I had no tortilla chips but found 4C Chipotle bread crumbs in the cabinet.  Tried that and it was a home run.

Its a good recipe, because it's quick and filling. After making it a couple times I decided I needed to change the diced tomatoes out for a can of rotel - to give it some more zip. Other than that its a great go to when im short on time and want some comfort food. Thanks!

Loved it! I substituted the taco shells for nacho cheese Doritos though. And I crushed them and put a layer on the bottom and on the top. Would definitely make again, but I plan on adding refried beans.

I am giving this 5 stars because it is a good dish as written, but if you want something that tastes like tacos, this isn't the dish you want or you would have to make some adjustments.  However, it was very tasty even though it had very little in common with tacos as far as taste goes.

Excellent and family friendly recipe.  I have a house full of teens, so I pretty much doubled it in a huge casserole dish, and it didn't last long. The kids told me it was one of the best things EVER. 
I agree, I loved it too.  

I went by the advice not to cook the macaroni past el denté, (6 min or so) and it was perfect.

It goes on the list of regulars now.

This was good, but I would not count on leftovers. It was not good re-heated. I even left the chips off of the portion that was not going to be eaten right away to avoid soggy chips. My husband doesn't usually like casseroles, but he liked this one!!

It was VERY EASY and Good. My son had seconds. I cooked the meat, onion, seasoning, tomato soup & diced tomatoes together. When it was time to add the pasta my pan was to small. I spread the pasta in the 13 X 9 dish took the meat mixture poured it over the pasta and mixed it in the 13X 9 pan topped with cheese & chips. Next time will add more cheese. There will be a next time.

My daughter and I made this and based on other reviews altered it from the start. We cooked the onion with the hamburger, drained it, added salsa and some taco sauce in lieu of diced tomatoes and soup before mixing in the taco seasoning. Then when the pasta was done (we used less) and mixed in we layered it in a casserole dish as follows: casserole mix, tortilla shells, pepper jack and cheddar cheese; repeat. My family loved it and the tortilla shells added a nice texture.

I really enjoyed this dish.  Only thing I changed was add another can of diced tomatoes and add small can of diced green chillis.  I also cut in crumbled chips into casserole rather than lay on top so it gave texture more enchillada feel..more cheese and baked 17 mins.  VERY GOOD

excellent receipe!  only modifications were to accomodate what I had on hand.  Used chix in place of beef.  used salsa as part of tomatos. Did not use soup as it was plenty tomatoe enough once I put in 2 cans of diced tomatoes w/ its juice. Yummy.

We loved this recipe. Can be an appetizer or dinner. I used tortilla chips for on top and after ward as a spoon. Used hot sauce and added a little salsa too. We almost always leave out onions and use onion powder with the meat in stead. On the bottom we used a can of refried beans. probably extra cheese on top- uncovered 20 mins. Sour cream on the side. We loved this and will be making again.

Very yummy! I substituted the beef for half a bag of veggie crumbles and a drained can of black beans to make it vegetarian. I think next time I'll add a drained can of corn and maybe some hot peppers to give it some kick!

This is very good and I am making it for the second time tonight.  I read the other reviews and I made the following adjustments:  omit tomato soup, add a chopped green pepper, a can of drained black beans, a can of drained corn, a can of undrained diced tomatoes with mild green chiles, and a 16 oz. jar of medium salsa.  The first time I made it with elbow macaroni but tonight I am putting in a package of taco rice.  I also add the crushed tortilla shells after the dish comes out of the oven and I bake it for only 15 minutes, covered.  It is very easy and tasty.  My 2 kids, ages 12 and 9 1/2, really enjoyed it!

Mix and match with different ingredients like you would a pizza.  The pepperoni tends to stick together, I cut them in quarters to stir them in better.  Wonderfully tasty dish.

Very good!  My 17 month old grandson even enjoyed it.  I made some changes, people always seem to, right?  I used Rotel, I used jar nacho cheese in the mix and then used cheddar on top to make it extra cheesy.  I also added green pepper and made my own taco mix found on all recipes.  I will make this again.

The toppings of sour cream and green onions are a must!  No worries about anything bland or disappointing.  I have to admit we doubled the cheese (1 part mixed in then 1 part on top) and we mixed in a small can of mild green chiles with the meat and pasta.  I know, I shouldn't rate a recipe unless I do it EXACTLY as written, but I'll blame the changes on my husband's taste buds :)  We'll defintely make this again!

I took the some of the tips of other reviews when I made this.  I replaced the diced tomatoes with salsa (half fresh from local market and other half jarred) and added frozen corn and a can of black beans (drained and rinsed).  And less noodles. I also used some fresh tortilla and cut them in triangles and fried them in tablespoon oil.  When I put it together I laired ½ mix on the bottom and then some tortillas and the rest of the mix and some more tortillas and cheese.  I may have used more cheese than the recipe said.

Wow!  My family gobbled this up.  It was easy to make and the ingredients were all things I keep on hand.  The only change I made was to use tomato bisque soup instead of regular tomato soup.  This has quickly become a family favorite.

I made it as it is written and loved it.  I like my food a little more spicy so next time, I will likely use enchilada sauce instead of tomato soup, and maybe add some jalapeno to it.

I made this dish exactly the way it tells you to. I thought it was great. It has great texture and lots of flavors to pick up. It was cheap to make and pretty easy. I am a 'beginner cook' so I have been looking for the easiest dishes to try. The only thing that I would do differently next time is add a little more spice or maybe even by the 'hot' taco seasoning. If your family loves tacos but you're sick of the same old soft taco, then definitely try this.

A great "quick fix meal".......I did change it up a bit..... I added tomato sauce instead of the soup and you must put cheese in the meat and pasta mix as well as on top of the cheese for a better sauce.....

I love this casserole. I do sub the diced tomatoes with Rotel and skip the chips and green onions since I don't have them on hand normally. It is my husbands favorite and it tastes a lot like a mexican manicotti dish my mom makes but without all the hassle.

Very good recipe.  I did tweak it just a little.   I added a can of Mexicorn and a can of kidney beans.  I also added some roasted annahiem peppers I froze from our garden.  I didn't have any tortilla chips but I'm sure that would have given it an extra crunch.  My husband is a very picky eater and he loved this as well.  It's a keeper!

The first time we made this we followed the recipe exactly, but found that the macaroni got too soft in the oven, even though we undercooked it beforehand. The second time, we used rotini noodles instead of macaroni, and taco shells crushed up instead of chips (which held up better than the chips and kept their crunch). We also used ground turkey instead of lean ground beef.

Loved this recipe! Modified a few things but in all very good. To those of you who commented that the recipe was dry, cook for 30 minutes with foil on top. Comes out moist and very good!

My 17 yr old step son really liked this. The recipe tasted similar to a taco hamburger helper which is tasty and a change. Very much like the cheesy home made version of hamburger helper I make. But I think I will substitute salsa next time to spice it up, maybe mix in some of the cheese w the mixture before topping, and eliminate the chips. It was quick and easy to make too.

This was good. I used Fritos instead of tortilla chips which made it look better. Next time that I make this I think I won't use as much onion.

Wish I would have read previous reviews first.  30 minutes is WAY too long to cook this thing and it dries out.  Also, the chips and cheese on top come out tasting like stale old chips and overcooked cheese.  Will try again because the filling actually tasted really good before I baked it.  Next time I will cook for 10-15 min, will add cheese the last 5 min and will just serve it with tortilla chips so they stay crisp.  Probably would be a 4-5 star that way.

For someone just learning to cook this is a great recipe. For the experienced cook at home, your family may be a little disappointed. Very easy to make and a good compliment of flavors but just not what our family is used to. No harm in trying new things!

I have to give this a 5 because it was easy and turned out great. I actually followed the recipe pretty closely. The only changes I made were ground turkey instead of ground beef (it's healthier), more cheese (which balances out the healthiness of the ground turkey with the unhealthiness of alot of cheese) and got a can of diced tomatoes with green chilis. I tried some black bean and garlic flavored tortilla chips (they were new at my store) and it turned out great. I think the cook time might be a little too long. I think you can pull it out after about 20 minutes.   This is a great base recipe, and I can't wait to get more creative and add different things in as I go!

Subbed the diced tomatoes and tomato soup with salsa and it was too dry.  Next time will do salsa + diced tomatoes.  Used taco seasoning from Taste of Home recipe.  Used tri-color rotini, instead of macaroni.

for my taste, 5 stars with the following changes.  I omitted the canned tomatoes and taco chips.  I only used cheddar cheese.  Also added another half packet of taco seasoning as I had one on hand.  I put about 3/4 c sour cream on top of mixture then topped all with cheese. This made it very similar to any hamburger/past casserole but with the mexican twist.  I will make this again as a quick simple meal.  Good for pot lucks too!

Its lacking taste, very bland, and the tomatoes favor the most in this recipe. the whole recipe is a great a creative Idea however; it can use some work..  next time i make it I'm going to double up on the taco seasoning and see if that helps.  Overall its a great starters recipe.  not hard to make at all!!

I added some corn, black beans, skipped the tomatoes as I never had any and replaced with salsa, added only about 1/2can tomato soup and some sauteed orange bell pepper. I don't generally have tortilla chips in my house so I improvised and used some organic wraps and just baked them in the oven until crisp and then crunched them up. I think next time I will do the tortilla thing although I will probably serve them on the side to just dip into. The only downfall is my daughter couldn't eat this as it has some bite to it but that was my fault. Play around with this one and see what you get. Thanx for posting.

I seem to be using up my excess cans of canned soup in the back of my pantry lately. This is a quick, cheap recipe that sure pleased my boys. I did make a few small changes to health it up a bit. I used ground turkey, whole wheat pasta, organic diced tomatoes, homemade taco seasoning mix (without salt) and because I don't keep them on hand, I did NOT add crushed chips. I didn't bake it more than 20 minutes, just enough to melt the cheese. It's almost like a taco goulash. I'll tell you, my boys made quick work of this casserole. Gone, baby, gone. I served this with homemade cornbread. NOTE: My husband seems to think this would be good cold, as like a pasta salad. I might try that some time. I might also cut back on some of the meat and sub in black beans.

This was a great recipe!  I added a little bit of tomato soup (not the whole can) as well as some salsa.  I also used ground turkey instead of beef.  I added the seasoning to the turkey first and let it brown.  Then i added the onions and let it simmer.  Finally I added the tomato soup/salsa mix.  My husband LOVED it and went for seconds.  Definitely a keeper in my house!

I made this for a party, and there was none left to take home! It's a great recipe. Following the suggestions of other reviewers, I substituted a jar of medium salsa instead of the tomato soup. I also added a handful of black olives because I like them with my tacos. Next time I may add some green peppers, too! Delicious recipe, easy to alter for taste, and makes great leftovers if you don't mind the chips being slightly soggy!

This was fantastic!  I made it as stated, with one small change...I had left over taco meat (ground beef with taco seasoning) made, which is why I wanted a recipe to use it.  I served it with salsa, sour cream, and homemade guacamole on the side.  Both the family and the guests for dinner really liked it, and all went back for 2nds.  Thanks for submitting.  This is definitely going to be made again!  Oh, I didn't use the green onion, only 'cuz we are not fans.

Very yummy! I did use salsa instead of the tomato soup and did not use green onions, onions, or the tomatoes and I waited to add the chips until the last five minuets in the oven. It was very good and we will make this again soon.

ABSOLUTELY DELISH!! everyone from my 16yr  old and her bf down to our 4yr old loved this...I used a jar of salsa ONLY because I use it in place for every dish that calls for tomatoes, and added SUMMER CRISP CORN by Del Monte (the best stay crunchy canned corn, try it!) again ONLY because I add it to almost all my casseroles~~I never like to change and rate a recipe w/ out having the original tried 1st but adding the corn of course doesn't change the taste...salsa, we just don't care for chunks of tomato and the girls wouldn't eat if it was used so it was a must. I used a suggestion to add a 1/2 of another pkg. of taco seasoning and it was enough to have the flavor desired. Thank you Debi, it was great! the comment below... it already does say corn chips in this recipe (Fritos) I've always known "corn chips" meaning Fritos...otherwise it would have said Tortilla chips, you pick white or yellow lol which yeah, it is a type of corn chip~~but corn chips refers to Fritos if anyone didn't realize that :)

I just tried this recipe for a gathering of twelve people.  It went over fantastic! People were coming back for seconds.  I personally love how the moistness of the macaroni and the ground beef/tomato filling contrasts the crunchy topping.

I ended up putting this recipe together except for the chips and cheese. Because I had planned for my boyfriend to do that when he got home from work(I work nights) Well he hadn't so by the time I got home he was starving! I just dished some up in a bowl and microwaved it for a few minutes with the cheese on top. He dipped the chips in it like a dip and said it was amazing! Don't really know if it was that great or if he was just that hungry! haha!

I made two of these- one to freeze for my dad to eat, and one for my husband and some friends.  We almost didn't give the other away because it was so delicious!  Everything was tasty!  We added the tortilla chips on the side, and everyone seemed to like it that way.  Yum!

I loved this recipe!! We did change the diced tomatoes to salsa and do not add the chips until your plating. Besides that my husband and I really enjoyed this and will make it again.

Quick, easy and delicious.  All of these items are in my pantry all the time so I anticipate making it often.  Like many other reviewers, I did make a few sustitutions; I omitted the sour cream, used more taco seasoning and cheese and used Rotel with diced chiles instead of plain diced tomatoes.  My family absolutely loved it!

Loved this.  I added salsa and 2 cans of rotel instead of tomato soup.  I then cooked it for 15 minutes and took it out and added the crushed tortilla chips and a bit more shredded cheese and baked for about 5 more minutes.  The chips were then crispy.  Will definitely make this again and maybe add some corn and black olives.

very easy and tastes pretty good.  I switched out the can of tomatoes for salsa, but would recomend not using the taco seasoning with the salsa, it was a bit too much. I served the chips seperately, the sour cream on top was a must, it made the meal.

I can't believe I haven't rated this recipe yet...I've only been making it for 3 years. I use Rotel and 1-1/2 to 2 pkgs of seasoning.  I only use 1-1/4 cups of macaroni because we like a lot more sauce and meat than pasta.  I put the chips on after baking and I've used all cheddar when I'm out of Monterey Jack. I make taco meat in big batches and freeze it, which makes this one of my favorite go-to recipes when I'm short on time.  Since there's only 2 of us, I divide it between 2 round cake pans and freeze one for later.

Very good 5 stars all the way!! My family demands this often. I did a couple changes not much but i use 2 packages of taco seasoning mix and of couse i dont measure 8oz of the noodles just eyeball it and i added a chopped green pepper from the garden, my self i add extra chips before its finished cooking with a little extra cheese just enough to melt it, I like the crunch... and there is never any left overs my husband always makes a second helping. Thanks Debi for a one dish meal that is so tasty!!!!

This was edible, but not enjoyable. Mixing noodles and tex-mex is not a good idea. This recipe is having an identity crisis.

Loved it! The whole family chowed down! I did substitute Salsa instead of the soup, but put some of the rotella diced tomatoes and green peppers to bulk it up. And the extra cheese helped! Amazing recipe, everyone asks where I got it from. Thank you so much for sharing this!

This recipe turned out good, was easy to prepare, and is flexible with the ingredients.  I added black beans, about a cup or so of frozen corn, and replaced the tomato soup with a jar of salsa.  Next time I plan to add a little Velveeta into the mixture.  I also placed the cheese on top THEN added crused tortilla chips.  My husband said more cheese and chips next time!  What a great way to use up any leftover taco meat!

This was very good.  I would recommend putting the cheese on top first, then the chips, cause it kind of 'glommed' together and got chewy instead of crunchy.  I baked it for 25 min and I still think that was a little too long, I agree with others that 15 min should be plenty (should have read the reviews first) ;)  Served with corn as a side and 6 and 8 year old grandsons LOVED this and couldn't get enough!

Abosolutely delicious! I am a beginner cook and found this really easy. I did change the tomoto soup to salsa. To make it easier for me I crushed the torilla chips and added the cheese per plate and melted the cheese in the microwave. Only 2 of ate so it wasn't an inconvience. Also I cut the recipe in half and still had enough for 2.5 meals. Again for 2 poeople.

I think this recipe is a good starter or basic recipe that allows for lots of changes if you want.  I totally omitted the tomato soup and just added an extra can of diced tomatoes.  I also omitted the macaroni and sour cream and instead, I had some corn tortillas I needed to use up, so I cut them up in place of the macaroni.  I added a can of black beans as well.  When it came out of the oven, I piled on lettuce, sour cream, guacamole, onion, chopped tomato. Yummy!  It was a nice change from tacos, and it tasted like a restaurant dish when it was all pulled together like that.

This recepie was really good!! It was a hit for my husband. I just change a couple of things.. I used petite dice tomatos (thats just what i like to use) and I added some garlic to the ground beef. Also I had in hand a sweet bell pepper so I toss that in as well. Yummy!! And last I mixed the taco seasoning with 1/3 cup of water. (it's better that way bc It just might get to dry when you put it in the oven).

This is super easy and a great meal. I used a jar of homemade salsa instead of the tomatoes and used a lot more cheese. I let everyone add their own chips so they would be crunchy, and so are the leftovers that way. I loved the tomato soup in it, and I was pretty skeptical at first. Thanks so much for sharing!

Husband and 13-yr old loved it; 10 yr old did not.  I thought tortilla chips AND macaroni was a bit too much starch so I cut back on the tortilla chips.  It was great served with salsa, too!

This was pretty good. I agree with others that the tomato soup made it way too sweet. Next time I will definitely use salsa instead. CHANGES: I used veggie crumbles instead of meat, I put a thin layer of refried beans at the bottom of the pan (which was really fantastic and cut the 'sweet' a lot), I mixed about 1/2 cup of cheese into the pan and then put more cheese on top (but less than what was called for), and I sprinkled additional taco seasoning over the cheese before baking because I thought it needed more flavor.

This is a great recipe. I made a few alterations based on the reviews if others. I added 2 cloves minced garlic and a 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes while browning the ground beef.  It wasn't quite spicy enough for me, so I may up the amount of red pepper or even add some jalapeño next time. I also doubled the amount of cheese (I used colby jack) and only baked it for 15 minutes. It was great the first time around and even better as leftovers!

I made this tonight, and really liked it. My husband and MIL thought it was a little too bland. Next time I may add salt/pepper or other spices, but I thought it was pretty good as is. I followed the recipe exactly, except made with sharp cheddar cheese. I will definitely make this again.

Pretty easy and quick to make. I found it kind of bland but we like our food a bit spicey (esp mex dishes). May spice it up a bit more next time but we will most likely make this again in the future.

My boyfriend loved it!

Very good!  I made a few substitutions to what I had on hand.  NO PASTA--I shredded about 4 small flour tortillas, dipped them in chicken broth, then mixed them with the meat.  NO DICED TOMATOES- I used extra hot rotel, that really spiced it up and made it hot.  ADDED BELL PEPPER AND GARLIC to the meat mix.  Very very very good. ADDED CHILI BEANS with juice to the bottom of the casserole.  Would have used refried beans, but gosh darn I didn't have those either!  Will keep this recipe and make again.  I like serving it with sour cream on top.

Easy quick recipe that tended to be a little bland. I added garlic, onion, red, yellow, and green bellpeppers, jalapeno, carrot, and celery to the beef mixture as well as a can of ranch style beans and frozen corn. If you do this don't forget to compensate with extra seasoning or an extra can of tomato sauce. Also, its a bad idea to use lowfat cheese for the top, it doesn't melt well.

I was trying to get rid of some tomato soup and leftover macaroni and found this recipe.  I used the amount of tomatoes called for, plus the same amount of salsa.  This made a lot and we were eating leftovers for days.  Surprisingly good.

This was a fairly good recipe. I didn't like the idea of macaroni, so I used brown rice instead. I also didn't use any soup/tomatoes, I just used some homemade salsa instead. I'm from Texas and eat a lot of mexican food, so I added plenty of spice to the dish. My boyfriend and I loved it! I also added black beans for me, and refried beans for him on the side.

My family loved this..I did not use the diced tomato because my boyfriend is not a tomato eater. I used a jar of picante sauce instead (mild). The pasta didnt dry out at all. I do not think this recipe needs any extra taco seasoning as other reviewers suggested . Very good recipe!

It was okay... Not much flavor. I doubled the cheese. I wasnt very fond of the noodles in it. I dont think I'll be making this one again anytime soon.

Mmmmm.  I had nothing planned for dinner and looked up something simple using things on hand and found this.  Didn't have the chips only had cheddar cheese and added a few drops of hot sauce, otherwise made as described.  We all loved it and I will definitely make this again.

We LOVED this, and will make it again.  We did make some changes.  We did not use tomato soup as we don't keep it on hand.  We substituted Fiesta Nacho soup. We only baked it for about 6 minutes - just long enough to melt the cheese.  And we added the chips to each plate after serving to keep them crisp.  Wonderful!

This recipe was perfect for me and my friends.  I love pasta and I Love mexican food.  If you are like me then you will really enjoy this.  Plus it is so simple.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  Also, I used salsa instead of diced tomatoes and fritos on top.  I have made it twice in the past week for friends.

An alright very basic casserole recipe.  I did top the casserole with sour cream and black olives after baking and did not use green onions.  I used Fritos instead of tortilla chips.

This was great - my family loved it.  I did change it up a bit - I forgot to buy the pasta so I cooked one cup of rice "firm" and added it to the meat mixture, my clan ate it up!

This is an awesome, easy recipe.  Even my 3 year old gobbled up two servings, not just at dinner, but also for lunch the next day.  Next time I will add another can of tomato soup because it dries out a little in the refrigerator.  This will be a regular in our house!

Great recipe.  I added the crushed chips and tomatoes after placing on the plates.  I didn't have any taco seasoning so I used chili instead and it turned out great.  I also substituted salso for the tomato soup.

Very good recipe! It's easy to make and quite surprising when you eat it. We hosted a dinner party and everyone raved. I suggest using sour cream and green onions on side - nice touch.

FANTASTIC!!! I had my 4 and 6 year olds help make this.  They LOVED it, even the pickiest 4 year old.  Thanks for sharing.  I also tried this again using Chili seasoning instead of taco, I prefer the taco much better.  Thanks a ton!!!

I followed this recipe exactly and it was so very good. I used reduced sodium taco seasoning as hubby doesn't like the regular. Next time, just to spice it up a little, I will use chopped tomatoes with jalepeno's. Great recipe!

When making this casserole I made several changes:  used ground turkey instead of beef, added minced garlic, cilantro, whole kernel corn, black beans 
(rinsed/drained) & little green chiles.  Reduced fat varieties with the sour cream & cheeses.  I used the tri-color tortilla strips to top off with.  My husband likes the Blue Corn Baked Tortilla Chips better.

This was quite good.  My whole family liked it, which is saying something.  The only change I made was to add a little water and cut back on baking time.  When I reheated the leftovers, I added a few extra chips and a little more cheese.  Thanks for the recipe!

Enjoyed this recipe so much!  My boyfriend is vegan, so no meat or cheese for him....didn't matter, it was just as great with soy beef and no cheese!  I added cheese on my side and it was just perfect.
We will definitely make this again!

This was a wonderful dish. It's a little cheaper than making hamburger helper and the taste is awsome. I personally omitted the tortilla chips and served it as a sidedish with some Southern Fried Chicken.  My entire family loved it.

This was excellent. I made only two changes. I didn't have any macaroni on hand, so I used a package of Lipton Taco Rice instead. I also added a can of Campbell's Southwest Style Pepper Jack soup. This spiced it up a little bit. Definitely top it off with sour cream. I would also suggest cutting the baking time to 15-20 minutes or the cheese will get too hard. Very easy and delicious!!

I'm a vegetarian, so I omitted the beef, and since I'm not into green onions, I omitted those as well.  However, the rest of my family does eat meat, and with this recipe, they didn't even miss the beef.  It was an absolute hit, and the left overs were eaten up like crazy.

I thought this was a pretty good recipe - it was easy to make and I had all of the ingredients on hand.  I did take the advice of some other reviewers and used salsa instead of tomato soup - and I used alot of salsa (probably about 1 1/2 jars).  I also added some sharp cheddar cheese to the mixture before I cooked it.  It was yummy!!

Great recipe! I like to mix things up most times so instead of plain diced tomatoes I used a can of diced tomatoes with mild chilies and I used shredded taco cheese.  Bought the wrong kind of macaroni but that did not matter.  I also used about a can and a half of tomato soup, since other reviewers said it was alittle dry.  Very good recipe, boyfriend liked it and had three helpings!  Will make again!

Great family meal.  After making it I would make a minor changes.  I would not add the cheese and let people put as much or as little as they wanted on their own plates.  I would also add some salsa for a little more flavor.  This is a recipe that I will make often.

I love this recipe.  I use the HOT taco seasoning and also add about a 1/4 cup of water. Doesn't reheat well so I'll take the advise of another and add the chips after baking. Thanks!!

My thirteen year old daughter made this, skipping the crushed tortilla chips, using rotel tomatoes with chiles, and substituting an 8 ounce package of taco cheese for the individual cheeses.  We always use low sodium taco seasoning mix.  I thought it was a tad dry, I would probably use an extra can of tomato soup, but she thought it was perfect.  A winner for keeping teens fed and happy.

This was really good. I took the advice from others and added more taco seasoning and water. I also added peppers and I used taco shells crumbled up because they are thicker then chips. My family loved it.

Very Tasty! I left out the tomatoes, we're not big fans, and served it with sour cream and salsa.  My fiancee called it "Goulash with a taco twist."  This dish was a big hit in my house, will def make it again!!

What a breeze to make!  I added fresh tomatoes (instead of the can), olives, garlic, chili pepper flakes and more cheese.  Next time I will add corn, chopped cilantro and more chips.  Definitely serve with the sour cream and green onion.  I can't wait to make this again!

This recipe was extremely bland in flavor. It needed some other heavier spices to give it some flavor. It was also too dry. Maybe some more tomato sauce or a flavored tomato sauce. Not enough taco seasoning.

Awesome!  Hubby had seconds and said "this one's a keeper!" I even used whole wheat elbows and couldn't tell the difference.  I also chopped the green onions and put them on the casserole before cooking...great color and flavor.

This recipe was very good. However, it makes a lot. I suggest using to small square pans instead becuase the chips on top get soggy when reheated. It also makes it easier to cook one pan and freeze the rest for a later date.

The sour cream makes the dish! To make it low fat I used extra lean ground beef, 1/2 the cheese (just enough for taste)and light sour cream.

My Family really liked this recipe. I do too. It's quick, easy and tasty. I didn't have tomato soup on hand so I substituted an 8-oz. can of tomato sauce with a little water to make up for the soup. I also added some minced garlic with the onion.  I'll be adding this to my list of favorites. Thanks for the recipe!

This casserole was just okay.  It was pretty good the first time around, but didn't reheat well.  Got real dry the second time around.  Probably will not make again.

My whole family really enjoyed this...especially my 12 year old. He must have told me 50 times that he "just loved" that "taco stuff.!" He wolfed it down and came back for more!!! Even Grammie and Grampie loved it!

Read many reviews and used what sounded like the best tweaks. 
14 oz can of diced tomatoes with green chiles (reserved the liquid to use for the taco seasoning mix)
4 oz can of diced green chiles (reserved the liquid to use for the taco seasoning mix)
14 oz can of black beans (well drained)
1 cup of salsa
omitted the tomato soup but used the onion, ground beef and pasta as stated.  Was AMAZING! Our 14 year old turned his nose up at it but then devoured 3 helpings! Definitely a new favorite for us!

My family loved this tonight.  I did make a few changes, I added minced garlic to the meat along with some cumin.  Then I used a can of Rotel because I don't have any tomato soup in the house, and a small can of diced green chilies and a can of red beans.  I also mixed cheese into the mixture and sprinkled cheese to the top and then topped it off with crumbled tortilla chips.  It was really good and a big hit with my teenage boys.

I used a can of Rotel (tomatoes with diced chiles) instead of just diced tomatoes. It was tasty...good heat. 
I also used 2 lbs hamburger and cooked it as I would taco meat before adding the tomato soup, etc. 
The chips and cheese were a bit too chewy. maybe skip chips

This wasn't that great.  I made a lot of changes to the recipe.  We do NOT used canned soups in this house so I just added tomato sauce, for one thing.  I added some colorful chopped peppers, as well.

Delicious! I used Mexican shredded cheese blend and added half of the cheese to the beef mixture before putting it in the pan. I also added about half a jar of spaghetti sauce to the beef mixture since we like our sauce.

It’s was good with my modifications. The serving amount I thought was way off I’m from Texas, one pound of hamburger is not enough meat for 10 servings. So I doubled this for my family of 5 adults & a couple plates of leftovers for lunch tomorrow.

I used medium shell noodles because that's what I had on hand and topped it with chopped cilantro instead of green onions. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly (which rarely happens). Very good, and fairly easy!

Made it twice now just so good! Made a few changes,

1) instead of the nacho chips on top I ripped up tortillas and layered it like a casserole.

2) I substituted cream cheese for the shredded jack cheese and just mixed it in with the beef and pasta mixture.

3) I used a jar of pace salsa instead of diced tomatoes for more flavor.

I enjoyed it, though I think it could have used a little more kick to it.  I tried to add a couple jalepeno slices chopped up, but I added so few that it didn't make a difference (especially since I made about 1.5 x the regular size).  I did add some garlic to the beef and onions while cooking it, cause I'm a sucker for garlic.  The kids loved it, so that much alone should give it a 5-star rating, especially with how finicky my oldest can be (she's 3).  Overall a very good recipe, and I loved how I had all the ingredients at hand to make it.  Simple to put together, but I think I will make a few more changes to it to try to give it a little more kick.

I made with ingredients listed - except left out green onions on top. The only change is I added half the cheese in the mixture. 
It was pretty tasty. My kids and hubby enjoyed it. I served it with a batch of cornbread and crisp green salad. Recommend for a quick dinner, a casserole dish for a neighbor, or a frozen prep meal. 
*Next time, I'll try adding some sour cream, green chilies, and salsa in the mixture and see how that tastes!

Superb - we added diced peppers, diced garden fresh tomatoes, cut back the sour cream by half and served with salsa on the side.

Awesome - will be making this again!!!

My wife and I enjoyed this recipe, though the final product was a little dry. The lack of moisture was probably my own fault. I drained the can of tomatoes, but I was guessing, since the recipe did not specify. If I prepare this recipe again, I'll try it without draining the tomatoes, which should increase the moisture content. If results warrant it, I'll move it up to five stars. Thanks for a nice comfort food supper, Debi.

I didn't have enough ground beef, so I combined what I had with Hormel Chili.  I really like this recipe because I already had everything (or mostly everything!) in my kitchen!

My husband adores this recipe. I usually double it and only make minor changes to accommodate food allergies (Tinkyada pasta and tomato sauce instead of soup to cut out wheat). My only major diversion from the recipe is assembly - I layer the noodle/sauce mixture and cheeses  in at least 3 layers before baking it. The cheese is distributed throughout and creates a much better flavor and consistency. I also skip the chips on top and just serve them on the side. The kids  gobble it up and company raves about it!

I found this to be very bland. It tasted like pasta and burger in tomato soup without any kick to it whatsoever.  It was edible and I won't be making it again.

Very good and makes a lot. Once the chips and cheese were on I couldn't keep it in the oven for 30 minutes to bake. Since everything was already got, I put it in long enough for the chips to get crispy and the cheese melted. I will make half as much for my family if 4 next time.

To cut the artificial aspects, I used the taco seasoning recipe by Bill Echols. Use that for all taco things now.

I've been making this Taco Casserole for three years and down to every ingredients that is added. You have to have it just right , cheesy and the right amount of condense soup. You don't want one thing to overpower the other. It has to be just right. It is so delicious and the family is always excited about it.

This was a great fast casserole for dinner.  I did add a few additions and substitutions to the recipe.  I added in a few extra seasonings while sauteing the meat, 2 cloves of minced garlic, 4 oz. of cream cheese, and double the shredded cheese to add some into the mixture along with the topping, to make it extra cheesy.  Instead of tomato soup, I used tomato sauce and rotel for the chopped tomatoes.  While baking, I left off the chips until the last 5 minutes, and covered the casserole dish to keep everything from drying out while baking.  We topped with the sour cream and green onion and really liked it.  It would be great paired with a salad.  Thank you for the recipe!  I will have to make again sometime.

This is the second time I've made this and it's already a family favorite!!  The first time I put the broken chips under the cheese, this time I put the chips in top, mainly because I forgot to put them first!!  I top it with green onions and sour cream to make a super delicious meal!!

I was disappointed in this dish. I had higher expectations I guess. But the rest of my family liked it. It seemed a little bland to me and just didn't taste that great. I made it just how to recipe says.

Will make again. Used the seasoning mix directions, sauce, and diced tomatoes.  Added pinto beans and corn and olives.  Will not add tortilla next time.  Only put in oven for 15 min until cheese melted.

I've made it several times. Depending on the ingredients on hand, I've made it as written and also with appropriate substitutions (i.e. tomato sauce instead of tomato soup; homemade taco seasoning instead of pre packaged) but I've always doubled the cheese. The recipe really needs more cheese than what is indicated. Having said that, It's always good. As written  the "fire" level is pretty low which is appropriate for feeding younger kids. Adjust as necessary for your own taste.

My husband and I loved this dish!  I made a few modifications based on others' feedback - I used only half of the macaroni the recipe called for, I added a layer of refried beans, I used chunky salsa instead of tomato soup and chopped tomatoes, I drained the hamburger meat after cooking, before adding other ingredients, and I served with sour cream.  Just made it last night and my husband has already asked me to make it again!

I thought this recipe was just ok so would not make it again. One thing I didn't like was macaroni noodles in a Mexican flavored dish.

I didn't have tomato soup so I used a can of tomato sauce instead and added green peppers, corn, pinto beans, cumin, garlic powder and garlic sauce. I also used 2 cups of cheese, mixing half into the beef pasta mix and sprinkling the rest on top of the tortilla chips. I also suggest cutting bake time in half so it doesn't get too dry.

I followed the recipe to a tee to make this. In saying that, it should not have the word taco in it. That insinuates Mexican food, which my family loves. This tastes more like Italian food. It also seemed like it was lacking something but I couldn't figure it out. If I make it again I'll play with the recipe.

The recipe turned out great. My Wife loved it and did not add anything to her serving(s)! I like more seasoning so I added some Toney's to my serving(s)! I will make it again and will not change a thing. Very Good!

I made a few changes only because lack of ingredients and family preferences. I doubled the onions and cut the diced tomatoes. With the tomato soup I also added 1/3 of a can of tomato sauce to make up for some of the moisture lost. I didn't have corn chips on hand so I decimated some Doritos to sprinkle on top. The FAM loved it! Thanks so much for the recipe!

Wonderful casserole. It was easy. I added beans which I wouldn't do again.  I think it made it dry. I didn't have tomatoes on hand so I use a 16 oz. jar of salsa and I used my own taco seasoning. My husband loves Mexican food and he like this. Sour cream isn't an option for me when the food is spicy. Next time I would cover it with aluminum foil to keep it moist.

I made this recipe for the first time today EXACTLY AS IT IS .  As is, the recipe is fairly good (which is the reason for 3 stars).  I would say that next time the only changes that it needs is that I will add some corn as others have done and it definitely needs way more cheese than the 4 ounces it calls for.  I would also either eat it with Doritos or some other cheese flavored chip rather than tortilla chips.   It could also stand for a little more than one packet of taco seasoning, but less than 2 packs.  It only needs to stay in the oven for about 15 minutes.

I had high hopes for this, but I couldn't get a consensus from the family. My husband rated it a 1, my daughter a 3, and I rated it a 4. It's somewhat Hamburger Helperish, so if you like that, it'll be fine. I added olives and fresh tomatoes to the top to give it a fresher taste. I really liked the chips and cheese, but the tomato soup and diced tomatoes made this somewhat of an italian/mexican dish and I don't like to mix cuisines. Will likely not make again. So sorry. :(

My 6 year old liked it so that means it's good! We used Doritos instead of tortilla chips and ground turkey instead of beef. Will add green peppers next time. Oh, and I cut the macaroni in half and it still made 8 good size portions.

So yummy!!! I agree with everyone else about the cook time though, 15 minutes is about ideal, mine came out so dry on top because I waited the 30 minutes. Other than that it was delicious! Next time I'm adding corn :)

I never tried one of these Taco Casseroles before, but WOW. For such a small list of ingredients, it packs alot of flavor. I will make substitutions if the reviews call for it, so I did. Mixed beef and Taco mix with water first, saved some taco mix for tomato sauce, also used gracious amounts of salsa and tomato sauce, used "salad toppers tortillas" multi-colored tortilla shreads after baking.. My goodness.

I thought this was a very good casserole. I used lean ground turkey and a regular (not condensed) tomato soup, which made it very moist. I also, instead of taco seasoning, used 2 tablespoon of Chili powder, 1 tablespoon of cumin, paprika and oregano and a few dashes on cayenne. It turned out great!

This was easy and quick to make.  I added 5 garlic cloves to my boiling pasta and then chopped them up into the meat mixture.  I also added a can of black beans and some chopped red and orange peppers because I had them on hand and they go with the taco theme of the dish.  The overall result was good and I will do this again because the whole family liked it.

Added extra cheese and a can of red beans for extra fiber.  Followed the suggestion to add the taco seasoning to the meat before adding the other ingredients and combining half the cheese into the casserole before placing in the casserole dish.

I made this last night with a few changes and it was excellent. Along with the macaroni I also added about a half cup of rice, about a fist full of Masa and some jalapenos to the beef mixture. I also added a layer of refried beans to the bottom of the casserole dish.

LOVE LOVE THIS CASSEROLE! I love reading suggestions to what others do to that's why I love then reviews. I fried my hamburger w/ onion and garlic or course! At just at end of that I added my packet of Taco seasoning, but I used the juice of the dice tomatoes first to help with the moisture to cook it in. Then a couple minutes I added the tomatoes and 3/4 of a jar of Mild Salsa and a dash of crushed pepper. I used small SHELL pasta only about 12 Ounces/ measured dry. AND SHOEPEG NIBBLETS CORN. THAT MADE IT!!! That bit of crunch and sweet was a good balance. It liked the taco chips crunched on top ,and didn't fear them being soft like some said. I knew it would just be a nice flavor and texture like it was. I used a 8oz bag of my favorite shredded flavor Sargento TACO CHEESE. I only baked about 20/25 minutes cuz it is fully cooked but just needed  to melt cheese and get real hot.! THIS IS GOING TO BE A REGULAR GO TO  Casserole.

I halved the recipe for the 2 of us and used ground turkey and egg noodles which I had on hand.   My taco-loving husband asked that it be put on the "regular menu".

I actually forgot to put the crushed tortilla chips before the cheese, so I topped the cheese with the chips. It was awesome. Kids loved it.

This is a keeper recipe!  I changed it slightly by using suggestions posted previously.  Added a bottom layer of refried beans, used whole wheat elbow noodles (but less than recipe called for), used 1 can Rotel diced tomatoes & chilies and 1 can tomato soup, and cooked beef & onions with taco seasoning for 5 minutes together before adding other ingredients.  Had the perfect kick.  Crumbled tortilla chips on just before serving.  I split this recipe into (2) dishes.  1 (8x8) and 1 (7x9) so I can freeze half for later as our family is only 3 people.  Also great with homemade guacamole!

Easy dinner idea. I stirred in enchilada sauce because I could tell there wasn't going to be a ton of flavor and it would turn out dry.   I added olives, green chilies,  and corn.  After baking it for a bit I stirred the cheese throughout and topped it with cheese and baked it for a few minutes just to get that cheesy effect.  Topped with sour cream, Fritos and shredded lettuce.

I made the recipe exactly as stated and found that the cheese and tortilla chips made an inedible shell on the top. Next time we will use salsa instead of diced tomatoes, mix the cheese in, and serve tortillas on the side.

My review won't be very helpful because I didn't really follow the recipe Good for a quick dinner. 
I didn't have taco chips or tomato soup.
I used 1 can stewed tomatoes and 3/4 cup salsa. Added the macaroni and baked as suggested.

Easy and tasty weeknight meal. For convenience, I used 16oz macaroni since it came in that size and omitted the tortilla chips. I serve with guacamole on the side.

I have to give this one 5 stars because my very picky 13 year old actually went back for thirds!   I won't tell him it had onions in it and he must not have noticed the tomatoes either, lol.  I made it almost as directed,  but had to make the following changes because I didn't have everything on hand:  Mexican style stewed tomatoes and all monterrey jack cheese - also didn't have any sour cream to add later but I bet that is a good addition.  Although others indicated they thought the  tomato soup added sweetness, I didn't notice it.   I was informed this will become part of the regular rotation which is fine be me because it was a super easy midweek dinner with ingredients I typically have on hand.

I  didn't  have  many noodles so I used a cup  of rice instead.  I also  used a small  can of tomato  sauce  instead of soup.  I  also  added a can of red beans.  It would  be good minus the chips and put in a tortilla.

This is going on the regular rotation.  I used ground turkey (healthier and cheaper) and "Taco seasoning (without chili power)"from this site.  Next time we'll add more more crushed chips on top - that was really good, and even better for lunch the next day!

This was really good with some changes.  Added taco mix to hamburger and followed direction on packet.  Add some cheese to meat mixture, sliced olives, salsa (no soup) and added 8 oz sour cream to make creamy.  Next time I will add corn.

Made this for my two roommates, and they adored it. So did I, especially because it was so easy. 

I made it in a pan, stovetop, because my oven wasn't working. Following other reviews, I used tomato sauce instead of soup. And because I didn't have tortilla chips, I used crushed Sweet Chilli Heat doritos. Any college kid's dream, really. Turned out sweet and spicy, and the crunchy chips really gave the pasta dish a good texture. Really enjoyed this!

Everyone in the family liked it  I made a couple of changes first I used some homemade spaguetti sauce and a can of regular tomato soup vs condensed since. I did not have this. I added two tablespoon of cooking cream to obtain the creamy effect I upped the cheese since my family loves cheese and used it both to mix with the pasta and to put on top. All in all a good dish , will be making again. I paired it with a kale , avocado and cilantro salad to give it that Mexican kick.

Don't know what I did wrong but this dish turned out very dry.  I did change or add any thing to the recipe.  Probably won't be making this again.

A little dry, but good with sour cream and guacamole.

Loved it!  Tried it out for a church social tonight where we were supposed to bring a dish we had never made before. This one sounded great.  It was very well received, so I will definitely make it for my family.  I may try reducing the amount of macaroni some time, but this is an easy dish that I'm saving in my favorites.

I just made this a second time with a few modifications.  The first time I made it, it tasted a little bland (mind you, I had to cut out all of the onion because of my stomach issues). However, I really enjoyed it after making it again with some simple substitutions. I used ground chicken instead of beef; cumin, smoked paprika, and cayenne pepper instead of taco seasoning; added about 1/2 cup frozen corn; 1 cup diced fresh tomatoes instead of canned; added 1/4 cup sliced pickled jalapeños; and added one can of rinsed, no salt added black beans. I also used plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream. It was amazing! I mean, I know I altered quite a but, but I'm thankful for the initial recipe because it provided such a great foundational recipe--so thanks! I'll definitely be making this again and again!

My family loves this recipe but 30 minutes is way too long to cook it unless you want charred cheese and chips! I recommend 25 minutes max.

excellent starter recipe.
I substituted cooked chicken for the ground beef
used the taco seasoning without chili powder from this site.
for tomato soup  used my canned stewed and my salsa for the diced tomatoes.  I diced fresh tomatoes for the canned. also with salsa
For the cheese I used bagged and shredded Mexican four cheese.

I make this every 2-3 weeks in fact there is one in the oven now.
for the tortilla chips, I take whatever chip I have in the pantry and
smash some with a rolling pin.  thank you for this recipe.  another note I am using tri-colored Rotini for the noodles it absorbs the sauce better I think but what does that matter.  great recipe Thanks again

I made this a few nights ago. First off, I did NOT make it according to original posted recipe. I read many reviews before making. Essentially, I made my own 'recipe' using the original as a base to jump from. It was a good meal. Taking suggestions from other reviewers I made the following changes: Used a jar of thick & chunky salsa instead of tomatoes; lined the bottom of the casserole dish with re-fried beans and some cheese before adding meat mixture; added black beans into the meat mixture for color and flavor; used medium sized shell pasta instead of elbow macaroni; used taco seasoning according to package, NOTE: if you do that, be sure to add another seasoning pack as directed in original recipe ('taco' flavoring was 'lost' in the mix of everything else); did NOT add tortilla chips before baking, added them after cooking to keep crunchy; added some black olives on top with shredded MEXICAN flavored cheese; only cooked in oven for about 15 minutes; topped with shredded lettuce, sour cream, & taco sauce before eating. Essentially, almost an entirely different recipe. It was good and filling. Even our three year old ate it. Will make again, but will assuredly add that second taco seasoning pack in the mix for more flavor.

Very good.  I think I would add some black beans and corn for little more texture, variety and fiber, but overall very good recipe.

Great recipe.  A great variation to "taco night".  My wife and daughter really enjoyed this dish, and we didn't have any left-overs.  Lots of room for variety in this dish to add anything that you like to tacos, and lots of room for "garnishes" to make this the perfect taco alternative.

Very good.  I used rotel instead of tomatoes and pepper jack instead of Monterey Jack cheese.  This made it plenty spicy.  It is a yummy recipe.  My son had seconds...

Great recipe.  Everyone loved it.  I modified it slightly by using a can of Rotel diced tomatoes with green chilis instead of plain diced tomatoes to add a little extra zip.  This recipe is going into my rotation of favorites.

This was easy to cook and good but not great. We added black olives to the toppings which helped. This recipe has potential and would be better if you kick it up a bit with a couple of diced jalapeno peppers cooked with the beef mixture. We may try this again using fritos style corn chips instead of the tortilla chips.

This was a great recipe. Easy too!!. I modified it as well. I am on weigthe watchers so I cut back on the tortilla chips, used fat free cheese. I also cooked the beef and the added the taco seasonino before the tomatoes. But the best part was adding half a can of fat free refried beans. My son is a picky eater and had 2 helpings of this. It came to 6 pts a serving. Great meal!!!

The only thing I changed was the pasta was GF pasta but I'm used to that. This recipe tasted too tomato soup-y. . I offered the left overs to DH for lunch today- he said no thanks.

I should have read all of the reviews before following the recipe. Cooking it for 35 minutes was too long. It was too dry on top. Salsa in place of the soup sounds better. We put salsa and guacamole on top to help with the dryness and added banana peppers to help with the blandness. The family ate it but I don't think I'll make it again.

I thought this recipe was good. Made few little tweaks. I added green chili instead of tomatoes & some hot sauce. But over all it was good. I don't know why people have to put down or make the person feel bad for just having a recipe they made. Just say "it was not for me but thanks anyway" & leave it at that. You don't need to be mean about it. Make your tweaks if needed. We all have different tastes just be nice about it. Thanks Debi... Tim

My family is not typically casserole eaters, but we all loved it. Nice simple way to feed a large family. I did add a dash of hot sauce to the meat.

I found the cook time to long to melt the cheese. But all in all a really good recipe. I will be making it again.

Very good, followed Andreas's suggestions and added a few more ingredients. Topped with a dollop of sour cream, avocado slices and salsa. Wife is not a big fan of Mexican food but she enjoyed this. I will use SPICY taco seasoning next time, not mild.

I thought this was pretty bland and unimpressive. I will probably
Try a different recipe next time instead of making this again.

if I could, I would have given this three and a half stars.This was good, but not as the phenomenonal as I thought considering the ratings. Pretty much your basic taco   casserole.I followed the recommendations of   MRSDAVIS810, and I will most likely make it again.

Made this last weekend for dinner for the grandsons - 4 and 5.  Easy to prepare, simple ingredients, but no one liked it.  I think it was the tomato soup.  Should have substituted salsa or something.

I love Mexican and equally love pasta so I couldn't see why other reviewers had problems mixing them together. I now apologize - for some reason the two of them together just didn't work for us either. The flavor of the meat and tomatoes was very good (hence the 3 stars), but we won't do this again.

I am sure this would be a great recipe based on reviews. I substituted mild salsa for tomatoes, but used Trader Joes taco seasoning, OMG its very hot!! And its not labeled as such... even my husband who likes spicy thought it was too much. Will make again- but will carefully choose my seasoning next time. ;-)

My husband really liked it, and he is not a fan of casseroles.  He told me to make it again, so must be good.  I had a bad cold and could not taste it at all, bummer.  Will make again.  Followed the recipe as called for.

I made this for dinner and my family of 5 loved it! Even my oldest son who is very picky, wanted seconds and that never happens! So happy I found this easy recipes with ingredients I normally have on hand. However next time I'll bake in the oven only for 15 instead of 30 "OR" I might just mix the tortilla chips with meat mixture altogether then layer on the cheese. Either way its a "keeper" and I'm saving the recipe.

My opinion is add more tomatoes, corn, peppers, beans, cheese, etc. As is, it is mostly meat and pasta. But my family all ate it, so that's a win to me.

It wasn't as good as I initially thought it would be, but better than I expected after it was made. Of course, I made some modifications, so that could be my own fault! I used shredded chicken instead of beef, then cooked the taco seasoning into the chicken as directed on the package. I also used about a cup of salsa instead of tomato soup--next time I'll probably use the whole jar. I also left off the chips and just heated them for a few minutes in the oven afterwards to crumble onto individual servings. It was still pretty good, just a bit dry. The roomie liked it better than I, although he also dumped some  cheese sauce into his.

This recipe was fantastic and simple. If my husband licks the dish clean, it gets at least a 4!!! He added salsa along with the sour cream, for those salsa lovers. (I stuck to my large scoop of sour cream!)

This recipe was pretty good! It was easy and quick to make, which is great for a weeknight meal. My whole family liked it for the most part, except my five year old not eating the tomatoes in it, but besides that it was liked by all! I didn't end up baking in the oven for the full amount of time, probably only about 15 minutes, at least enough to get the cheese melted. This will be made again at our house! Thank you for the recipe, Debi!

Very good and simple dish! The elbow macaroni and tomato soup initially threw me off but tried it anyhow. Glad I did! Even my picky 4 y/o enjoyed this. I followed the advice of other reviewers and sub the canned tom and used fresh mild salsa. We will do this again without the little one and use meduim salsa for a bit more heat!

Awesome & forgiving...I didn't have the tomato soup & I used a can of Rotel tomatoes...and I put Ranch beans (10.5 oz can). It was amazing! Whoever said to put the chips on each individual plate instead of on the whole casserole (to avoid soggy chips in leftovers) was SO right, that's the way to go....because there are a ton of leftovers...yay!

With modifications.  I took others advice on some things. I used my own salsa instead of tomato soup and diced tomatoes. I added a can of pinto beans. I cut the amount of pasta in half. I used home made taco seasoning also found on this site. Extra cilantro because I love it. It was incredible. The kids loved it, I will keep this one! Btw, don't forget the sour cream and guacamole and this would even be great with fresh lettuce as a topper! ( I did put the chips on each serving after the fact.)

Even big kids love casseroles, especially hubs.  Preferring a little spank in the flavor, I added a small can of diced jalapenos.  Instead of using the two types of cheeses, I used Colby/Jack cheese which I always have on hand. Since I didn't have any green onions for garnish, I opted for chopped black olives. This is a super easy dish to put together.

This recipe was EXCELLENT, the only thing I did different was added a large can of pinto beans to the 90% hamburger mixture. Once it was done cut up the green onions on top and let set for about 8 minutes while we ate our salads. Topped it off with lite sour cream and served it with a side of fat free refried beans. Everyone loved it!!

My wife and I like this recipe.  It is very easy to make, and preparation is easy.  The amount of pasta in the recipe can make the dish a little bland on the whole.  I added some jalapeno peppers to the bake to spice it up.  Salsa, sour cream, black olives, and lettuce make a nice taco salad-like dish as well.

I omit the pasta, use salsa instead of diced tomatoes.  Just prior to serving, I add chopped lettuce. It's great even without the pasta.

Not my favorite. It was sort of like a nicer version of hamburger helper. The leftovers did eventually get eaten and I am glad I tried it once, but I won't be making it again

Was real easy to put together but family thought it could have used two pkgs of taco seasoning . I probably had 1 1/2 - 2# of beef. Maybe even next time try on bed of lettuce. Would make again for sure.

MAN OH MAN!!! This was FANTASTIC!!!  I added a little more chips and cheese to the top and topped with green onions and sour cream.  DEEELISH!!! All the goodness of tacos without the expense or hassle. Only difference I will do next time is 1. Make more and 2. add some fresh shredded lettuce just before eating!  So good!!

This was pretty good for this type of dish, and most importantly, very easy.  I made it easier by using what I had on hand - canned chili (without beans) instead of the ground beef and soup, and salsa instead of diced tomatoes.  I'd make it again - it's nice for a hot meal in a pinch!

I used ground pork and like other reviewers, cooked the meat with the taco seasoning.  I used a can of Ro*Tel for my diced tomatoes and used tomato paste instead of the soup.  I didn't have any onions but added a can of black beans.  I added olives to the top along with the greeen onions.  The dish looked beautiful and was very tasty!

I liked it, hubby hated it.  Made as written with the exception of adding green bell pepper to the mix.  If I make it again, next time I would add cheese INTO the meat/sauce mix to make it ooey gooey and top with chips AFTER it comes out of the oven.  Added a splash of taco sauce to my own plate - I thought it was decent and easy.

We all loved this recipe.  I even made my own taco seasoning from a recipe on this site which meant that I could control the amount of salt and chilli in it as my 3 children are not fans of burning mouths!!  I added more tortilla chips on the top which gave a wonderful crispy topping.  Definitely a recipe I will try again perhaps with some of the variations suggested by other reviewers.  Thanks for the recipe.

I wanted to love this because I love casseroles and tacos. The only change was to add corn and use rotel in place of the tomatoes. The dish was way too sweet. I was skeptical about the tomato soup, and that was the problem. If I make ut again, I will sub the tomato soup for something else, add black beans, and only use half of the seasoning packet. My 3 year old did seem to like it though.

I did it with mild salsa, instead of the tomatoes, as well as refried beans on the side!  Really good and simple recipe!!  I also added garlic when browning the hamburger.

I followed another reviewers suggestion and used salsa instead of diced tomatoes. We only had medium salsa, and that with the taco seasoning made it a bit spicy, especially for the kids. Next time I will either use mild salsa or omit the taco seasoning. Easy to make this dairy free by not baking it and just putting the cheese on top when serving. UPDATE: used diced tomatoes and 2T fajita seasoning. Way too spicy. Will try only 2t next time.

Really tasty. I would be very careful about which Taco Spice packet you use. I used the one from Trader Joe's and it was much too hot. We ate it anyway, of course; but I think in the future I'll make my own spice mixture. (or use the Taco Seasoning Mix from Costco that is not nearly as hot).

Delicious!  I would add more ground beef to this recipe and maybe some olives...but a great recipe that you can make your own...it was gone the next day and makes for a great reheat meal ;)

This was more of a baked chili than a casserole to me.  Good flavor but nothing special.

This one is a crowd pleaser. I made it for a family football get together and everyone loved it.  Used a mexican blend of cheeses and did as one reviewer suggested and added a little cheese to the mixture and the rest on top. Used the chips, tomatoes, chopped lettuce, sour cream, hot sauce, black olives and cheese as toppings for folkes to add to their on taste. I may use rice instead of noodles next time and see how that turns out.

Yummy, easy and I had all of the ingredients. The only thing I did different is I mashed up the chips, heated them and put them on each individual serving so that the chips woudln't get soggy later.

Love this dish, my daughter is learning how to cook. We picked this dish for easy measurments and for her to get familiar around the kitchen. She is planning on making this dish again for her Bible study girl friends.

Great tasting casserole and easy to make.  Based on other reviews used chips for plating, topped with sour cream and green onion.   Family loved it and would definately make it again.

This was really good!  The only thing I did to alter the recipe was to use fresh roma tomatoes instead of canned tomatoes.  The only other change I might make is to leave off the chips until the dish comes out of the oven.  They were a little chewy, not crunchy, and the cheese made them stick together so it was hard to get the taste of them in every bite.  3/11/12 - UPDATE:  I have made this several times now and each time I have used roma tomatoes, but I had a can of diced tomatoes that I wanted to use before it went bad so I used them (like the recipe calls for), and I must say that this dish comes out even better with them.  I was surprised...I like to use fresh whenever possible, but something about the canned made it so much better so I will make it this way from now on.

Simply and tasty. I used the tomatoes with diced chile for an extra kick, and of course extra chesse.

I made this with the suggested changes, like adding black beans and no pasta. I added olives and salsa. Family raved about it, even though it's such a simple dish. In fact, I plan on making 2 of them to take on a trip to the mountains for 13 people.

This was OK, but it would be much better with rice instead of noodles.  I added a can of corn and black beans, but did everything else the same.  Think next time, if I try it again, I will use rice, then maybe put that into burritos or something.

This was very good.  I did add an extra half a packet of Taco seasoning for more spice, and cut the meat in half.  I also threw in some zucchini, bell pepper, corn, and a can of black beans for a little more nutrition.  I opted out of the tomato soup, and substituted with salsa.  If you are pressed on time, you don't need to bake.  I just left the ingredients in the skillet, added the cheese and chips, and stirred until the cheese melted.   Super good!

I loved that this is so versatile. I noticed some people said the noodle thing was odd, try subbing for tortillas or maybe even mexican rice! I added tortillas on the bottom of the pan, spread a salsa refried bean to that, topped with ground turkey (which i added onions and garlic too), salsa, olives, and continued till the top! Baked 20 min and topped with fresh shreded lettuce and sour cream! Delish :) Thanks

I would have only given a 3 but my kids loved it so I bumped it to 4.  I found it quite bland, especially considering the sodium level.  I guess I'm just not sure that macaroni goes with taco seasoning.  I added a green bell pepper to get a little more nutrition in it.  Make sure to drain your beef (pour boiling water over it if it's high fat) so you don't have lots of grease in the bottom.  Overall it's a nice easy meal but I wouldn't serve it to guests or anything.

My new favorite casserole! I add some garlic while browning the turkey (I pretty much never use ground beef, ground turkey is healthier).  I probably don't use a full 8 oz of pasta (I often make it with leftover cooked pasta, so who knows how much it is) and use whatever cheese I have on hand.  I also like to add a layer of refried beans between the meat and cheese layers.  And I don't think it needs to bake more than 15 or 20 minutes.  Yum!

This was an over all great recipe thought next time I think I may make a few changes. You definitely do not want to bake it for the full 30 minutes because the cheese will be hard and burnt. Probably about 15 minutes will work, or just long enough to melt the cheese. Though my boyfriend said it wasn't too sweet, I thought it was. Next time I will either substitute the diced tomatoes for spicy rotel or substitute the soup for salsa.

What an awesome casserole.  This was liked by everyone at the dinner table.  My father-in-law actually called it "delicious". I used ground turkey, Barilla Plus noodles, low fat cheese, a can of Rotel, can of corn and keep everything else the same.  I may add black beans next time.  The spiciness was just right.  Some people added sour cream and salsa on top.  The leftovers  were just as good if not even better.  Thanks, Debi, for the great recipe!!

Great recipe! I added a can of corn and used a larger can of sliced stewed tomatoes as opposed to the diced tomatoes. I also added cheese to the mixture. I made one small pan with the tortilla chip topping and one without because I was afraid after reading some negative reviews, however, my family loved the tortilla topping - my parents both went back for seconds. I only baked it for about 17 minutes. They will try the dish without the tortilla topping another time but they definitely enjoyed it with so you can't go wrong either way I don't think! :) Thanks for a delicious recipe.

Great family meal. I changed it like some of the other reviews in here. I added corn and a cheese dip sauce in the mix that I had. It all worked out great and my husband said he would eat it again!! So thats a keeper in my book!!

Very easy, very good! Next time I might try adding some black beans or a few handfuls of frozen corn for some added flavor! This is a great recipe because you can pretty much put in whatever you want!

This is good, but a little disappointing. My husband really liked but I guess I had higher expectations! Wasn't bad at all, just not fantastic.

It is good, but for our family, we will only use about half of the macaroni that is listed. Thank you for the recipe.

Incrediby versatile recipe!  I was out of both salsa and tomato soup.  Used 3/4 of a 29oz can of petite diced tomatoes and 1/2 C taco sauce.  Even had to substitute egg noodles for macaroni.  My entire family loved it- my 5 yr old had 2nds!  THANKS!

Super easy and had all the ingredients at home except the sour cream.  I didn't make any alterations to the recipe, and it came out great!!  Maybe next time I'll add refried beans to the bottom, but ONLY because my son likes refried beans.  Thanks Debi for such an easy and yummy dinner!!!

ho-hum.  The kids liked it, but it didn't impress me.  I probably wouldn't make it again.

Awesome way to use up left over pasta when you cook too much.
I made it without the meat and it got rave reviews even that way.

This recipe is very easy and tastes great. I topped it with sliced black olives but had to skip the sour cream since I had none on hand. My family really enjoyed it. Thanks!

This recipe was great. I made it for my research team and they enjoyed it.  I would add more taco seasoning next time.

A big hit with my family! I've given this recipe to many people and the verdict is the same in all cases:  one of the best casseroles they've ever had.

No thanks.  I was okay, but turned out a little dry and just wasn't my family's thing.

This was okay.  Not a lot of flavor.  It was better with hot sauce, sourcream and green onion.  I would not make this again.

Very good recipe.  Everyone liked it - only suggestion: Only bake for approx. 15-20 minutes, add more cheese in the last 5 minutes.

This was very good and my 4 picky grandchildren loved it!  So from them you get 5 stars, or should that be 20!
