Tasty recipe! I think next time I would follow Buckwheat Queen's suggestion and use apple cider vinegar. We definitely enjoyed!

This is so good and super easy. I love the fact that it doesn t use pineapple juice- great for anyone with allergies. I used apple cider vinegar instead of red. I also used homemade dark brown sugar which gave this a rich flavor and color. It was a nice balance between sweet and sour. I served it with some spicy meatballs and my kids ate the sauce just with a spoon. Thank you for the recipe.
