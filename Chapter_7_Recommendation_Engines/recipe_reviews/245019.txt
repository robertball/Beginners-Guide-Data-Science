This was the first time I've ever made jam (or ever canning anything ). It came out not quite fully set but i didn't use the lemon juice not knowing it had pectin in to help it set as the grapes were pretty sour. I had gotten some wine grapes from a friend so decided to try this. It's easy and even though not set quite right tastes wonderful.  I am looking forward to trying again next year.

Very  nice recipe.  I have been making jam with honey instead of sugar for several years now.  Taste wonderful.  Note:  Cooking times vary.  Boil down process took 40 to 60 minutes

This jam is certainly delicious- but I think it's important for everyone to know that honey has different qualities from sugar when you are cooking it down.  It has to boil down much longer, it creates so much foam that overflowing is a strong possibility, and it did not set up until I made the second batch.  I'm sure there are a lot of scientific reasons for this but it would be nice to be forewarned.  Thanks for such a great tasting recipe!

This never did set for me, and I used raw, local honey and fresh lemon juice. It boiled and boiled it away but couldn't pass the plate test (whose instructions I didn't fully understand). I jarred it anyway, let it sit a week, and then ended up dumping back into the pot, adding pectin and trying again. But flavor wise, it is wonderful and would have made a perfect pancake syrup the first go round.

Delicious. The honey definitely contributes to the flavor. Perfect consistency.
