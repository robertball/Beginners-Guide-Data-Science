Three words...Cute, Easy, Delicious! I loved the almond flavoring mixed with the chocolate and banana. (Banana extract in my case but you can mix and match whatever flavorings you have on hand that you think will taste good together. Lots of room for creativity here.) You only need to make one dough which was very easy, and then divide it into 3 equal parts to color and flavor as you wish. For the pink layer I used maraschino cherry juice, a couple drops of red food color, almond extract and finely chopped maraschino cherries in the dough - tasted great! For the chocolate layer I mixed in 3 Tblsp. of cocoa to the melted chocolate for a richer, darker color and flavor. I just added the banana extract to the white layer, easy as could be. Very versatile for different occasions and easily assembled in a  loaf pan for surprisingly impressive results. Refrigerated for 4 hours and easily removed from the loaf pan, I cut the dough into 4 rows for smaller cookies as others suggested and very pleased with the size of the finished product. I baked the cookies for 8 minutes and loved the chewy, soft texture/results. They were the 'Belle of the Ball' on my cookie tray and the first to disappear! Thank you Missy for sharing and this one is a keeper for sure~

very easy to make. Looks and tastes great. I omitted the nuts and used cocoa for the chocolate.I used plastic wrap and used a big enough piece that I could wrap it for the frig and then just lift the dough out. thanks missy!

I found this recipe delicious!! I did change a few minor things.In the chocolate layer I put the nuts,in the vanilla layer I put packaged coconut, and left the red layer plain.Plastic wrap was used instead of waxed paper which made it easier to pull out of the pan for cutting into slices.

Made the following substitutions for Christmas:  no chocolate layer, instead add chopped red candied cherries to one layer with red food coloring, and green candied cherries to another layer with green food coloring.  For the white layer I used chopped blanched almonds, instead of walnuts, and the almond extract.  Made a batch as soon as they were frozen and then another two weeks later - the flavor really intensified over time and the texture was better too!

Deserving of all five stars, great texture, delicious taste and not as difficult to prepare as I originally thought. I did not add the nuts and the cookies were stil wonderful.  Instead of melted chocolate, I used bakers cocoa and still had great results.
Thanks Missy, these are a treat.

These cookies were great - just like the ones my Grandma used to make for Christmas. I added chopped marchino cherries to the 'red' and a little cocoa to the chocolate to get more chocolate flavor.

WOW! these are sooooo good and pretty simple to make. next time i make them, i may cut a bit of the sugar out as i found them a tad too sweet. i froze the cookie dough as other reviewers suggested and this worked out well. at christmas i will use this recipe with red and green food colouring and marachino cherries and green glace cherries to make a festive cookie. Can't wait! oh, by the way i made these cookies last night and took them to get together and came back empty handed :)

A great cookie. I've been eyeing this for awhile and finally made it and it was easy and turned out a light crunchy cookie with a great flavor. I added the almond to the white dough, added 1/2 tsp strawberry extract with the red food coloring to the other dough and for the third mixed in the 1 oz melted chocolate as stated, but also added three tablespoons Hershey's cocoa powder when it wasn't as dark looking as I wanted. 
I only chilled for two hours and it was easy to cut. The only thing I would do different is take the suggestion of another reviewer and cut the dough lengthwise into three sections instead of two as the cookies would be good a bit smaller.
A fun cookie that the kids love..a keeper.

Gosh these are good! Instead of layering them like the recipe calls for I placed the three different dough flavors in the bread pan side by side, so it resembled a neapolitan ice cream pattern more, plus it divided up the flavor. Really good!

Good recipe. Almond flavor is nice. Better when pulled out of the oven when just barely starting to brown around the edges. A definite keeper.

Very delicious and tastes just like the ice cream, if you use 1/2 tsp strawberry flavoring (extract) in the red side.  I did that, and used the almond flavoring in the white.  Use Ghirardelli 100% cacao unsweetened chocolate and it is a very good, strong flavor.  Not real sweet obviously, so the kids don't care for that side too much.  But I think it does resemble chocolate ice cream.  A keeper!  This would look great as little mexican, italian, or french flags with a toothpick!

YUM!  This is a family favorite.  For the first time this Christmas I made them with a green colored dough in place of the chocolate - very festive for holiday cookie platters.  Used strawberry extract with the red dough and put the almond extract in the green - delicious.

These cookies were gone as soon as they had cooled off enough to eat!  Very tasty, and everyone will be amazed at your baking skills (even though they are super-easy).  These particular flavors (almond and chocolate) blend quite well, but it's easy to experiment with different flavors and colors.  Make them red, white, and green for christmas, make them red, white and blue for 4th of July, you get the idea!

Yuuuuuum!  I've had my eye on these for awhile but never wanted to wait 4 hours for them to freeze when I found myself in the cookie-making mood.  I finally just did it, with a few changes I read from other reviews.  I mixed red food coloring and several tablespoons of maraschino cherry juice for the pink section.  (I had to thicken it a little with a bit more flour.)  For the white section all I had on hand was coconut extract, so I added a teaspoon or so.  A GREAT combo with the chocolate and cherry flavors!  For the chocolate section I just added about 2 tablespoons of cocoa powder.  Then, in my impatience, I took them out of the freezer after 1 1/2 hours and they cut PERFECTLY!  I cut the block of dough into thirds and they made perfect size cookies.  My only issue with these cookies is that we can't stop eating them!  A fun addition to our usual cookie recipies!  So glad I finally tried it!

Sliced just a little thicker than 1/4" and baked these guys for only 9 min at 350F, and they were not hard at all. They kept soft in a Ziplock for the next day as well. They didn't last past 24 hrs, so I can't tell if they keep longer than that!
I left the nuts out. I also doubled the chocolate, used vanilla and almond extract for the white layer, and strawberry extract for the pink. They taste sort of like a sugar cookie, but you can distinguish each individual flavor. Yummy. Cute as a button too.

I made these exactly as the recipe was written. It was easy, but I should have cut the loaf  into 3rds like people have suggested, because I only  got about 26 cookies, and they are rather big. I was surprised at how good they tasted!  Make sure you press the layers firmly together before you chill so they don't  separate while you are slicing them.  I am eating them all myself.

These were much easier than I expected. I used 3 TBL cocoa + 1 TBL butter to substitue the 1oz unsweetened chocolate, but otherwise followed exactly. My husband that "claims" he doesn't like nuts, gobbled these up. I had used really ground walnuts, so he didn't notice them right away. LOL. They are going to be added to my yearly Christmas baking list of stuff to make. And I just may make these for my yearly 4th of July summer party, as they would look so yummy at any time of year..summer or winter!!

Great cookie - looks nice and tastes good.  I did these with green and red for xmas.  I will definitely try other flavor and color combinations.  Very easy.  I used plastic wrap instead of wax paper.  I recommend cutting it in 3 strips lengthwise before slicing the cookies.   Great for holiday cookie trays.

This recipe turned out pretty well and the cookies were very cute. I substituted strawberry extract for the almond in the pink layer. I think there might be a little too much baking powder, though (it definitely added a flavor that detracted from the cookies). If you look at the other neopolitan/spumoni cookie recipes, none of them have *any* baking powder in them!

They were ok.  They came out looking perfect but taste wise they were ok.  I didn't find them amazing in taste.  For looks they would get a 5. For taste, to me like an average butter/sugar cookie.

Good cookies, a little hard to mix near the end, not sure if it's because of the changes I made. I used whole wheat flour instead of white, not as great of a contrast but still turned out well. Also used shortening instead of butter and cocoa instead of chocolate. Other than the dough being a bit stiff, love the recipe! Thanks!

I am in love with these cookies!! They're so different, and not too sweet - and the recipe makes a lot too.  I read a lot of reviews and decided to be creative as well using ideas that I read.  I chopped marichino cherries and added them to the pink part; I added the almond extract and some coconut to the white part; I used the chocolate square as stated in the recipe and added the nuts to the brown part. I find these addictively delicious and they were fun to make too!

This was SO EASY!! I wish I had made a double-batch (or more!) - I am making these for a bake sale, and I think this will be my go-to recipe for all future sales. For the layers I used cocoa powder for the chocolate layer, almond flavor for the white layer, and the juice from marischino cherries to make the pink - YUM!!! SO EASY AND GOOD!!!

I have been making these cookies for years as part of my Christmas gift tins.  In the chocolate dough I add a tsp instant coffee - makes the chocolate more pronounced, in the white dough I add poppy seeds and in the red dough i add chopped maraschino cherries (1/4 cup no juice)

These are the cutest cookies! And they smell and taste just like neapolitan ice cream. For the pink layer I used 1.5 tsp strawberry extract and left out the almond, for the chocolate layer I used 2 oz dark chocolate, and for the vanilla layer I omitted the nuts. I chilled the dough for only two hours, and cut it lengthwise into thirds. 12 minutes in my oven was too long - about 8 or 9 minutes and they were perfect.

I made these cookies solely for looks, but was pleasantly surprised by their flavor.  I added 12 chopped maraschino cherries and 2 teaspoons of the juice to the pink portion, an additional 1.5 ounces of unsweetened chocolate to the brown portion, and an additional teaspoon of vanilla extract to the white portion.  My favorite thing about this dough is that it freezes exceptionally well when wrapped in plastic and stored in a ziplock freezer bag.

These look super cute, and are pretty easy to make. Everyone was quite impressed with them.  THe only problem I had was getting the dough out of the pan, so I could cut it. But that could be because I let it chill overnight in the fridge, instead of 4 hours.  I would definitely not do that next time.  I also left out the chopped nuts.  I will be making this recipe again.

Very good cookie.  Nice & rich.  I substituted the red food coloring with marachino cherry juice.  Gives the pink layer a subtle hint of cherry that blends well with the other two layers.

These are fun and not nearly as difficult to make as I had anticipated.  Next time, I will pay more attention to making the dough more square in the pan before refrigerating so that they bake up more squared.  I did not use the nuts because I made these for kids, but even the adults at the party loved the taste and thought that they were "cute" cookies.

These cookies taste great.  I would have liked a little more chocolate taste, but they are great!  Everyone loved how they looked.  I refrigerated the dough over night and next time will definitely freeze.  It seemed to get soft quickly.  I will also probably make 2 slices lengthwise then cut across just to get more of a bite size cookie.  I certainly did not get 72 servings as the recipe said.  The recipe says to bake 10-12 minutes until lightly browned but mine never got light brown.  I cooked for 12 minutes and I feel because of that it made them very hard.  Next time I will bake them for only 10 minutes.

FREEZE THIS DOUGH BEFORE YOU TRY TO CUT IT!  These were pretty good, but more importantly, people are very impressed at seeing a cookie that looks like a slice of neopolitan ice cream! I would love to find a way to make these softer.

It was very difficult to cut these evenly. So some came out very thin and hard and others came out thicker and very nice. The flavor was good but just very difficult to get a consistent thickness/quality and not worth the time/trouble.

This cookie is fabulous!! Yes, there are extra dishes, but the cookies are worth it. The first time I made these, I could not taste the chocolate at all, but the second time, I used chocolate bark (we didn't have any baking chocolate and I was too lazy to go buy some). I think they taste so much better with the sweetened chocolate, but I do enjoy slightly sweeter cookies and I did cut back on the added sugar by a few teaspoons. What I got was an amazing chocolate-almond flavor with a great texture. Great, great recipe!!

Fabulous cookies!!! They have wonderful texture and a really delicious flavor. And they weren't hard to make at all. A few extra dishes don't matter. I left mine in the fridge overnight, too, and they were a bit hard to get out of the pan. But I ran a bit of warm water over the bottom of the pan, and they popped right out. Very impressive cookie. I will make these many times. Yummy.

These are very pretty little cookies, and are really easy to make. I added a tablespoon or two of extra cocoa to add more of a chocolate flavor, and added just a few more drops of red coloring to get a darker pink. I stuck the cookies on parchment paper and baked them for 13 minutes before they were perfect. Don't wait for them to get brown...by then they'll be a little overdone. Bake them just only enough so that they're somewhat firm to the touch and when they cool you'll end up with soft, chewy cookies. I plan on adding these to my Christmas baskets of cookies.

Cookies had a good taste and looked very pretty.  They were also easy to make.  My cookies turned out to be kind of crispy/hard but tasted great when dipped into coffee like a biscotti cookie.

To be honest, these looked very fancy and I was very unconfident and didn't think that I could make them. However, they turned out great and my family loved them. I even made them again to bring them to school for the open house we were having and put it on the snack table. Everyone loved them. The only problem: they turn out very small. I suggest doubling the recipe if you want big cookies. That's all. 5 stars.

I love this recipie. It is one of my fav to make and my family loves it.  I do a little bit of tweaking as my family it not a nut kinda  of cookie person. I use 2 tablespoons of chopped marcchino cherries for the the red part of the cookie and I use the multi colored parcellis instead of the nuts.   Its always comes out the same everytime and they do not last long.   Thank you for the reicipe. I love this.

Too much trouble for a simple butter cookie!  Cute idea, but the taste wasn't there to make this a "5"!

I finally tried these cookies and while not entirely blown away by them, I think they have great potential. I did as another baker suggested and used banana extract on the white layer (yum); I also chopped in my mini food processor 4 maraschino cherries and added to the pink layer (yum). I found these cookies to be rather large so next time I will add a bit more flour so that they don't spread so much, chill the whole cookie tray before baking and cut into 3 bars instead of 2. I also think they need a some sort of finish- I'll try melting white chocolate wafers, and drizzling over the top.

I have been making these for years. It is a staple at Christmas. This recipe was published in a Southern Living magazine back in the late 80's or early 90's. Easier to make than it looks and it has a high yield. Great with coffee or hot chocolate.

It's a very neat and attractive cookie, but generally lacking in flavor.  It is sort of bland. Since I was making them to add to a sampler of cookies to deliver to friends for Christmas, I appreciated the appearance and ease of stacking, and hoped the uniqueness would make up for the flavor. Next time, I will add some cherry syrup to the pink dough, and a bit more chocolate to the chocolate dough. I think the almond flavoring and nuts in the white part worked fine.  Excellent idea that just needs a little personal taste boost.

I used strawberry extract for the pink, left out almond and used crushed walnuts and cashews. The kids love it, but I found it a bit too sweet for my taste. Will make again because of popular demand!

I made these with all-purpose gluten-free flour and 1/2 the sugar.  The results were very good but pretty fragile--I had to let them cool completely on the baking sheet and then they were easier to handle. Next time I will use 1/2 the salt if I leave out that much sugar. Also I will add 1 t. xanthan gum to help it hold together. To spread the dough in the pan, I wet my hands and formed it into a flattened oblong shape, then laid in in the pan and pressed it to the edges. Like others, I used cocoa. For the white layer I just added 2 T ground almonds. For the pink layer I used 1 T strawberry jam & 2 drops red food coloring. Very good & fun recipe!

They came out too sweet for me. Tried not to overmix, didn't expect that chewy a texture for this type of a cookie. Maybe something else I did.

For those of you who like to bake using a scale, each of the three different layers weighs approx. 301 g. Instead of using different flavors, I chose to make them with three colors that matched the party's color theme. Very cute.

Made these today and wow they were easy. They turned out ready well. I added double the red coloring just because, and I used minced almonds instead.  Husband really enjoyed them and now waiting for the real test tomorrow when the grand kids come for a visit.

Boy did I have a problem with sticky dough! I must have added a 1/2 cup more of flour to each bowl.  In the pink section I put cut up bits of maraschino cherries. I put the 3 layers of dough in an old ice cube tray to get the squarish shape. 5 stars for appearance, 4 because it was time consuming.

Awesome cookie! Buttery, delightful, and beautiful to look at. I made them bite-sized and it only increased its cuteness factor. I had no baking chocolate on hand so I kneaded 3 liberal tablespoons of cocao powder into a third of the dough and it still came out delicious. I would suggest cutting the dough only portions at a time because the dough gets soft quickly once outside the fridge and therefore messier to cut. Thanks!

This recipe taste nice but mine didn't turn out pretty. It was difficult to work with and the dough kinda soft. My cookies came out big and flat and doubled the size from what i have cut out,even though i freeze it over night before baking. Maybe its just me.

These cookies are really cute, definately different.  I made a bunch of these (forgot to count - nearly 100) "bite size" by slicing width-wise off the loaf and then making 8 sections from that.  I pureed my walnuts - I think maybe next time I will leave them out because it seemed to make the dough harder to compress.  I used about twice as much chocolate.  My white layer was more on the beige side than other photos, maybe because my flour was unbleached, maybe because of the nuts.  The cookies tasted fine, my only complaint is that it was difficult to work the dough evenly and smoothly into the pan.

I have made these cookies for probably about 20 years now.  I got the exact recipe from our newspaper that many years ago.  They always turn out great.  The only thing I changed, was that I used double the amount of almond extract.  Very good cookies and easy to make.

This was a super easy recipe!  Used plastic wrap instead of waxed paper.  Only had to refrigerate for two hours and came out of the pan beautifully.  I had to grease the baking sheets as they were a bit difficult without greasing them.  I also sprinkled with white sugar crystals. This gave it the extra "kick" it needed.  Perfect recipe.  Thanks!! You can also find this recipe on Taste of Home website.

I cut up marischino cherries and added the pieces plus red food coloring to one ball of dough, melted chocolate to another ball of dough, and almond extract to the remaining (white) dough. Cookies were easy to make. I learned to take them out of the oven sooner though, they were ready in a very short time.

Very good, and great presentation.  Instead of a pink layer, I used green food coloring and added drained chopped marischino cherries to that green layer.

Great crunchy cookie!  I used more unsweetened chocolate (2 oz.) and instead of using nuts, I added mini chocolate chips to the white dough.

EXCELLENT recipe!  I make a lot of cookies and this will be in my permanent file.  I did not add the walnuts.  The cookies was light and looks great.  Thanks for the receipe.

I made these for a cookie sale and they were a big hit. They are a very attractive cookie and the kids really loved them.  I cut the cookies in half again before baking for a nice size, and plan to repeat this recipe many times.
