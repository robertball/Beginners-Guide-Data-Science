I made this for my husband who was coming down with a cold. My only complaint is that one batch wasn’t enough for the two of us! This recipe is so delicious. My only unintentional change was I used primarily vegetable broth because I thought I had enough chicken broth and didn’t. Not sure how much of a difference that makes, but this soup is perfect, for a cold, a cold winter night, or anything else!

I made a few changes. Used Asian noodles but added zucchini any way.  I cooked the noodles in the stock.  It was delicious.

Great soup! We did half chicken broth and half vegitable broth, but next time I will omit the lime juice and use all chicken broth for a more savory taste. We also added about 2 Tbs of soy sauce instead of salt. 

Best part was my kids are it! Definitely recommend for a quick healthy dish.

I love this recipe. I followed it as written except I doubled it, substituted half the chicken broth with vegetable broth & omitted the mushrooms. It’s delicious & I appreciate the low-carb substitution of zucchini noodles.

This was nice.  I added two boneless skinless chicken thighs when the boil started for the carrots.  I shredded them and added back in at the end.  I used long shreds on the box grater for the zucchini noodles so I added them just briefly at the end.  My son the 'foodie' and I both thoroughly enjoyed this for dinner.
Update 4/27/19
Just had the frozen soup leftovers and it is still wonderful!

Excellent!! I always try to follow a recipe but ended up adding more broth, kale, top ramen noodle pkt and topping with green onions. Have 8 servings. But that’s just me!

So good.. I don't have my veggie spiralizer yet so I made it with udon noodles, omitted the celery, added baby bok choy and a dash of a very high quality Caribbean soy sauce. The possibilities are endless. This is a very good base recipe to experiment with!

Zucchini was a good substitute for noodle.

Delicious and pretty quick to put together. The flavours are quite enjoyable and the soup is filling. Thank you for the recipe.
