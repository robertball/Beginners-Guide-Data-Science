I love all the ingredients this recipe called for and had to give it a try.  The recipe prep is easy and straight forward. We made it exactly as called for with the optional capers.  In the end it was just too lemony, a bite of the spaghetti without Brussels Sprouts was just too tangy and the mellowness of the tahini was hard to find. The juice of the medium sized lemon I used produced 1/4 cup.  In the future I will try to make this using a maximum of 1 Tablespoon of lemon juice and see if I'd like to ramp it up from there.  I also would at least halve the Brussel Sprouts, and quarter them if they are large.   I also had to prepare a little corn starch and water to thicken up the sauce which was not a problem at all.  All the cook times were very accurate.
