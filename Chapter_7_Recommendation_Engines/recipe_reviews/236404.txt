What a great idea!  My kids loved these!  I used the packages of Oscar Myer cooked bacon chips and didn't use tomato (my kids won't eat tomatoes).  Will make again!!!

What a great idea using kettle cooked potato chips instead of tortilla chips. Great flavor, simple, versatile and easy to make. This went over big with guests. Thank you Cat Hill!

AWESOME! I used a whole bag of kettle cooked sea salt and cracked pepper chips, so I didn't measure any of the other ingredients, but I did use them all, including some shredded mozzarella that I had to use up, and aside from the sour cream b/c I served these w/ Semigourmet's personal recipe for 'buttermilk ranch', which was fantastic w/ these. We literally licked the plate clean, lol. We already can't wait to make these again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)
