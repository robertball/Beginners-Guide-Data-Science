Everyone at my house loved this pie last year at Christmas. I was disappointed though, it was extremely runny. I am going to make it again this year, I am just going to cut back on the liquids. Even with it being runny though, it was very good!
UPDATE: after a few more years I think I have it perfected. Here's some of my hints: mix the apples you use (I use granny smith and jonathan apples- granny smith is important to control the sweetness).  Cut down on the sugar and butter.  Add an extra tbl or so of flour. With these changes the pie is no longer runny... Its just YUMMY

This pie was incredibly delicious!...the filling was PERFECT..it didnt run out of the pie and definitly was perfect thickness. I did do a few things different considering reviews bout it being doughy/runny and i found that..its better to add 1 extra tablespoon of flour to that 3 tbsp of flour...just to thicken up the caramel. If your worried bout the pie getting doughy..prick forkholes all over pie and pre-bake in the oven for about 10-12 minutes. I also didnt use caramels...i used caramel dip and poured half the apples into the pie..then half of the caramel..then the apples and caramel again. I reduced the white sugar by half so the pie wasnt overkill on the sweet side and it was perfect. Also if you like ALOT of apples in your pie..use a cup more of apples. Instead of the top being a pastry (i thought would be a little bland) i used a great streusle topping ive been using on apple pies for years..heres the recipe if you want to use it too. make Streusel Topping: In a medium bowl combine 3/4 cup flour, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon,1/4 teaspoon ground cloves, 1/2 c brown sugar, 3/4 c oats, and 1 tea lemon peel. Mix thoroughly, then cut in 1/2 cup butter or margarine until mixture is crumbly. 
pour over pie before baking and pat to seal ..make sure there are no openings where filling can seep through. bake, halfway till pies done..put tin foil on top and over edges of crust.

This recipe has become a family favorite. I've been making this for several years and have tweaked the recipe with the following adjustments: I use six cups of Granny Smith apples (usually seven apples) and 1/4 cup of flour. As for the caramels, I highly recommend Abdallah Vanilla Cream Caramels. These caramels are much softer than most caramels and are easy to cut into small pieces. I also sprinkle the top crust with sugar after brushing with milk. Bake the pie in a preheated 425 degree oven for 15 minutes and then lower the temperature to 375 degrees and bake for 10 minutes. Remove the foil and bake another 30-35 minutes until golden brown. As a result of these changes, the pie is not too sweet and not runny.

This Pie has become my Favorite Apple Pie to make.  I made it for a pre Christmas get together the other night of 4 women (figured they never eat much so a apple pie would be perfect) Before they were gone the entire pie was gone (and all I got was a tiny sliver to say that I actually know what it tastes like) Everyone loved it and wanted 2nds and a couple even 3rds. I was like WOW.  I am always afraid people are just being polite but when they left I knew they loved the pie because they didn't stop talking about it (even called the next day to get the recipe) The only thing I did different this time around was I used the 6 cups of Apples as suggested by other users. I also used the T. Marzetti's Caramel Apple Dip instead of caramels (I am handicapped and anything that makes baking easier I will do so using the Apple Dip for me was easier) I also put a bit of sugar on the top of my pie crust after the milk just for decorative purposes (because a apple pie is not a apple pie unless it looks beautiful....although the first one I made I forgot the sugar that I always put on pies and it came out really golden brown and pretty without it but I personally just prefer the extra flair of sugar on Pie Crusts. Oh and I added  a little bit of Cinnamon/sugar my Pie Crust Recipe ....it makes this Pie to die for. I had a recipe years ago that had cinnamon/sugar in the Pie crust...I lost it now but I always just add a bit to my pie crust and it makes all the difference in Apple Pies.

This was the best apple pie I ever made!  I usually don't like apple pie but this pie with its added caramel and taffy mixture made it great.  One tip I thought I would share is to add premade caramel dip instead of caramel pieces.  You don't have to worry about the caramel pieces melting completely this way.  I just spoon it over the apples.  If its too thick, a few seconds in the microwave will thin it enough to drizzle. I use about half of a 16 oz. carton.

I only used granny smith apples, increased the flour to 4 Tablspoons, to make it less runny. I made 10 of these pies in 1 week, because I wanted to enter it into a contest. I did not win first place, but the reviews I got were all very good. Some thought the pie was too sweet. I did make one pie with 1/2 the amount of caramels, and then dropped some of the caramel dip over the top of the pie before adding the top crust. I also quartered the caramels.  Any way I made this pie, it got rave reviews. Thank you for such a good recipe, it is a keeper, and will now be one I make each Thanksgiving.

OOOOHHH MMMMYYYY!!!! How delicious.  I love apple season and this is by far my favorite pie I've made so far.  I did mix 3tbsp lemon juice and 1 tbsp cornstarch in saucepan and simmered the cut up apples in that for 15 min until warmed.  I did use only 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup flour for the apple mixture and I added a few squirts of vanilla and a few pats of butter on top of the apples as well.  I skipped using caramels for all the reviews of the caramel not melting well-so I used the caramel apple dip that is next to all the apples in every store during this apple season and put dollops of that evrywhere.  I can't say enough how delicious.  Mine wasn't watery or soggy in the least-but beware- don't forget to seal pie because it does leak  and don't forget the cookie sheet underneath.  I also needed to bake mine for more like 1 hour to 1 hour 10 minutes.

This was fabulous & I've made apple pie several times several different ways. The only things I did different were I added 6 cups of sliced apples, & sprinkled a tiny bit of sugar on the crust after brushing it with milk. The reason for more apples is the apples flatten about an inch or so during baking, and I was always left with a flat looking pie before I started adding an extra cup. The sugar on the crust was just to add a pretty finish. Great recipe. Thanks for sharing.

I cannot give this recipe anything but 5 stars as it just won first place in an apple pie contest and the grand prize for the entire pie contest. Many thanks. My ribbons are beautiful!

This is one of those recipes that I’ve made several times over the years, but just haven’t gotten around to reviewing yet.  This pie always gets rave reviews, but I’ve never been quite satisfied with it because 1) The filling is too soupy and 2) the bottom crust is soggy.  My sister-in-law requested I make this pie again for the holidays this year, but I was determined to improve an already yummy pie.  After doing some research, I decided to precook the apples, that way I could have control over the amount of liquid in the pie.  I gently cooked the apples and sugar on low heat, just until the apples started to soften.  I then drained the juice (reserving it) and then added the flour, cinnamon and lemon juice.  I then added just enough of the juice back into the mixture to moisten it.  I got a little over ½ cup juice from the apples and added about half of it back.  Then I just followed the recipe as written.  The only other change I made was to put the baking sheet on the oven rack below the pie, not directly under it.  This directs the heat to the bottom of the pie, baking it thoroughly, instead of insulating it from the heat.  I could actually slice it into pieces, the filling wasn’t soupy and running all over, and the bottom crust was not soggy.  I think it’s one of my proudest baking achievements yet!  (I’ve written a blog about this pie, which you can find a link to in my profile information.)

Yum yum!  You must have a sweet tooth for this one.  It was very delicious.  I did not find it to be runny and it was gobbled up quickly.

I made this pie last night. I loved the flavor but it was too runny.  I let it cool about 40 minutes before we ate it.  It was still warm but not hot.  It was still runny when it was room temperature.  If I make it again, I will cut the sugar in half so hopefully it will not be so runny.

The hardest part is cutting up the apples!  HELPFUL TIP: Skip the caramel meltdown as suggested in the recipe and buy the bottled caramel sundae sauce (such as Smucker's).  Much easier and honestly the same outcome.  Makes for fewer ingredients, too.  The recipe does not mention it, but always peel the apples before cutting.  Sounds obvious to an experienced baker, but it's not and should be mentioned.

I found Fuji apples turnout best and I have baked 6 of these since I first made three months ago (because the entire extended family is demanding them at each gathering).  Frozen pie shells are easy, too.

Yummy! Instead of using two crusts, I put crumble on the top (from an apple crumble recipe). I cooked the pie halfway before adding the crumble. Worked out great! I used a mixture of apples and omitted the lemon juice and didn't have any problem with it being watery. I'm planning on making this again for Thanksgiving!

Wow, this pie certainly didn't last long at work!  My boss took extras home for his wife and kids!  The only changes I made were to halve the white sugar and use 4 tablespoons flour.  I also skipped the top crust and instead used a crumble topping suggested by another reviewer: Mix 3/4 cup flour, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp ground cloves, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 3/4 cups oats, 1 tsp lemon peel.  Cut in 1/2 cup butter until everything is crumbly, pour onto pie and pat down.  At halfway point of baking, cover to with foil.

i made a few alterations to this recipe: first, i quartered rather than halved the caramels because some other reviewers said the caramels didn't melt entirely.  second, i added a few more spices - nutmeg, allspice, and just a pinch of cloves and ginger.  the flavor was wonderful but the pie was very runny.  i believe the cooking time is too short - next time i will start at a higher temp (then reduce to 375) and also will cook it a tad longer.  i will definitely be making it again, though!

My family and my church love this one.  My daughter and I have enteredit into pie contests on two occassions and placed first both times!  I do decrease the sugar but the most significant changes that I make are the addition of chopped walnuts, and the use of a dutch apple pie topping instead of a top crust

This was good, but not quite what I was expecting. It tasted very similar to our traditional apple pie, even with the caramel. Not sure I would make it again, even though it was good.

This is a fantastic recipe. The caramel is a great addition to the pie. I read a lot of reviews that others were having trouble with the filling being to runny. I took the advice of others and I added an extra tbsp of flour. The pie turned out great,Thank God! Thanks for a great recipe :)

I’ve been making this pie as is since I first stumbled on the recipe years ago.  It was an instant classic.  I make it every year for Thanksgiving and it is hands down the most popular dessert.  As our family grows, I’ve had to make MORE pies: not a problem.  The recipe couldn’t be easier.  It’s perfectly delicious and gooey the day after, too - IF there’s any left!

Flavor was good but I don't suggest heating it up. Got all runny. It was better next day after coming out of the fridge.

I made this pie for Thanksgiving this year and it didn't turn out very well. It tasted great, but after taking it out of the oven it pretty much looked like a soupy mess. The caramels also didn't melt even though I halved them all. I followed the directions, but the granny smith apples I used must have been too fresh. If I make this again I will use a different type of apple.

This was AWESOME! I made 3 in one weekend cause I wanted all my friends to try it! I tried it with both regular caramels and also the caramel dip. Both tasted great but the dip was smoother...especially after it was refrigerated. I have made with a crumb topping too and it was also delish!!! Thanks for sharing.

Neither my son, nor my hubby like ANY kind of fruit pies.....but I had a 'hankerin' and wanted a good old fashioned apple pie (all the more for ME, right?!?)  So I hopped online and searched by 'review' and this recipe came up.  Caramel apple pie....hmmm....interesting and I just HAPPENED to have all the ingredients on hand if I used Smuckers ice cream topping!  You people really don't need to hear my rave review because there have been so many before me....but TOUGH!  I'm here to tell ya that this is THE best apple pie on EARTH and remember the non-fruit pie lovers?  Well, THEY had two generous slices topped with Bryers Vanilla and couldn't believe they not only 'liked it' but 'LOVED IT'!  (so much for the 'more for me' thing, I guess!)  I will try the crumble topping next time just so I can use the second crust in the Pillsbury box for a SECOND pie!!!  Make this pie!  Dab some flour onto your face to show how 'hard' you worked on it (it's really very easy!)  and serve it warm!!  You will be a HERO!  I used: Apple-peeler-corer (a MUST have kitchen gadget if you don't already own one!).  Pillsbury Ready Pie Crust in the cooler section of the grocery store.  Doubled the cinnamon (just because I like lots!).  Most of the jar of Smucker's Caramel Topping and I sprinkled top crust with a dash of cinnamon sugar for looks!  I'm heading to the farmer's market tomorrow for more apples!  :)

Delicious!  My husband loves sweets, but thought the caramel was a little too much.  The 2nd time I made it, I cut the number of caramel pieces by half and he said it was perfect.

After I went apple picking, I found this recipe. It was very tasty. I took it to work and it was gone before lunch. It was a bit sweet for me though. I made it again and decreased the sugar to 1/2 cup and icrease the flour to 4 table spoons. I loved it.

This pie is delicious and has been loved by everyone I have served it to. I also had some problems with the caramels melting, so I melted them down in a saucepan ahead of time and added spoonfuls throughout as I was adding the apples. I would also increase the amount of flour, as mine have been a bit runny as well.

PARTIALLY BAKE, FREEZE,COMPLETE BAKING, SERVE.  Thanks to other reviewers' input, I used Granny Smith apples and half the sugar, it was not too sweet, just right.  I did not find this runny at all, in fact, I added a splash of milk to the taffy mixture to make it more spreadable. I think what keeps this pie from being runny is not serving it hot out of the oven.  It stays warm for a considerable amount of time after removing it, so it can be taken out of the oven and left to cool for probably 45 minutes and it slices up perfectly, but still warm enough to combine perfectly with the low-fat caramel frozen yogurt sprinkled with cinnamon that I scooped on each piece.  I made this ahead of time by baking covered at 425 for 25 minutes, removing from oven, lowering temp to 375, then baking covered for another 25 minutes, allowed it to cool, then froze it.  A week later I thawed it, baked it (still cold but thawed) uncovered for 15 minutes at 375, then covered only the fluting (I have those aluminum rings, they work great) and baked an additional 10 minutes until golden. I used 25 carmels, quartered.  I might use 30 next time, but any more would be too sweet.  GREAT recipe.

this was very good.  I only used 1/3 cup sugar with Granny Smith apples.  Next time I would add even more carmels.  I also baked about 10 minutes longer with the foil on.  The left overs were even better the next day.

My husband won't let me make any other kind of pie now. Per the advice of other reviewers, I cut the white sugar in half. I also cut the caramels in quarters instead of halves, so it would distribute more evenly through the pie. Really yummy stuff.

This recipe was very tasty.  I omitted all of the white sugar and it was definitely sweet enough without it.  The only thing I will do differently next time is chop the caramels in quarters instead of halves.  There were some chunks of unmelted caramels even though I baked it the maximum time.  Overall, a very good recipe I will try again.

This was a really good pie, but it was almost just a bit too much.  The first couple of bites were great, but I couldn't even finish a whole slice because it was so rich.  If I make it again, I think that I will leave out the caramel pieces, as I think that the taffy would be more than enough sweetness.  I might also add some more flour because mine was pretty runny.  Otherwise really tasty though!

My husband about died when he tasted this. I made it exactly as the recipe instructed, except I cut the caramels into 4ths instead of halves since the caramels were a little hard. Served with vanilla ice cream and it was perfect!!

So good! I did not make the caramel sauce I followed the pastry and apple steps and used a squeeze bottle of caramel. I drizzledvover apples about 1/4 of bottle and then drizzled over vanilla ice cream as garnish.

BEST PIE I'VE EVER MADE!  Followed the recipe down below that said to use less sugar and butter and up the flour by a smidgen!   Also, I used caramel sauce I had in the fridge (ice cream topping) instead of buying the mini caramels.  AMAZINGLY delicious!

This pie went so fast at our family's Christmas party that I never got a chance to taste it!  Based on that fact alone, it gets five stars from me.  Next time, I'm keeping it at home with me!  Thanks for a great recipe.

Delicious! Followed the recipe to the letter and it turned out great, not too runny at all. 
I'd recommend letting it sit out for at least half an hour before serving it warm. I kinda think it's better cold, though! 

Will definitely be making this again and again, thanks so much for the recipe!

Delicious! I used granny smith apples and a pie crust recipe from this website. I did not alter the recipe at all.  Make sure you peel the apples (it doesn't say so in the recipe). This is a keeper. Enjoy!

Mmmmm, I love this apple pie. I love apple pie in general, but this one is the best one I have had the pleasure of making.  I made a few adjustments, I added apple pie spice and I didn't skin the apples, but everything else was the same.

This is one of the best apple pies that I have ever tried.  I only used 10 caramels and 4 TBSP of flour in the taffy mixture.  It had perfect consistency. The only thing that I might change for next time is to decrease the sugar a bit.

The bottom crust didn't cook all the way through, even though I cooked it longer than suggested.  Next time, I will follow my own tried-and-true recipe that is MUCH BETTER!  So much for trying something different!

I was making this pie for my family because we went apple picking.  I do not like apple pie.  HOWEVER, this recipes changed my mind.  It was so good that I ate almost all of it myself.  It was my first apple pie and I will never use another recipe.

Very very good.  I prefer my apple pie a little sweeter so the "taffy" and the caramel was excellent.  I used a deep dish pie pan and could have used 6 cups of apples.

Easy to make and got rave reviews.  Used a food processor to slice the apples.  Next time will probably add some all spice to spice it up a little more.  Putting the foil under the pie is key or it will get everywhere!

The first time I made this pie was two weeks ago and it was only the 2nd pie I've ever made in my life.  I made it exactly as indicated in the recipe.  The clear step-by-step instructions were easy to follow and understand.  This pie was requested special for an early family Thanksgiving gathering we had yesterday and it's oooey, gooey goodness was enjoyed by all!

My family thought this was too sweet and I had already greatly reduced the sugar...hard to taste the apples.  I was also disappointed because I thought it was hard to taste the caramel too. Usually my pies are gone by day 2 and this sat in my frig for a week.

Absolutely delicious!!!!  I used the caramel nibs instead.  They are little balls of caramel and i layered them.  Little layer of apples then nibs then more apples then more nibs.  Awesome.

The apples didn't cook enough, and it was way too sweet for our taste - some of my guests said it was the best apple pie they ever had, but I would say it is similar to a chain restaurant dessert - overly sweet and decadent. If you like that sort of thing, then this is a great pie for you. Make sure to put a pan under it when you bake it, even if you think the crust is completely sealed.

This was GREAT! The only downside would be that it is VERY rich-- I like sweets. Definately a crowd pleaser- will make again. Used a little less sugar as recommended and a little more lemon juice, and did bake it a good 15 minutes longer to get the crust golden. I did not find it to be runny at all- just good!

Yum is all I have to say, easy to make. I made it for a bake sale, it was the first pie to go and sold for 12.00. Thank you very much! I am going to make many more times.

This pie tasted great especially with ice cream! I found it to be a little runny and when I tried to re-heat it in the oven it sogged the crust. Any suggestions on how to reheat with out that happening?

Awesome. One tip: Make the apple mix a bit ahead of time and let it drain so you don't have a soggy mess.

Well... I might be the only one, but I had problems with this recipe. In my opinion, it was way too sweet. I cut into it while it was still warm and the inside was so liquidy that it completely seeped out from the rest of the pie. I thought it would firm up overnight as it cooled, but it was still very liquidy this morning. The caramel was a nice addition. If I make this again, I will omit the taffy step and add more flour to the apple mixture.

After all the reviews of runniness and hard caramels, I was a bit wary but this recipe turned out perfect. I had no problem with either. I did use 7 granny smith apples (overpacked the pie), used half the sugar and sealed very well. I think mixing well and cooking longer helps with the runny problem. I also brushed with milk and sprinkled sugar on top, and cut out a few fall leaves out of extra dough to make it pretty and fall-ish. I think it is too sweet to serve with ice cream - we used a dollop of fresh whipped cream that had barely any sugar added, and a sprinkle of nutmeg on that.

This has been the best apple pie I have ever tasted. It is so good that my boyfriend's mother is jealous and wants the recipe! The only suggestion is to use maybe 5-10 caramels instead of the full 20. I did and it wasn't so sweet but still just as good!

This was good, but despite my best efforts, was pretty runny. I used roma and fuji apples, maybe granny smiths give off less water? I don't know! But it was good none the less. Apple pie is not my favorite, but this was enjoyed by those who like it.

OH GOODNESS!  I've NEVER made a pie before myself.  Boy, was this easy to understand and do.  It was FABULOUS.  I took the advice of some other reviews and cut the white sugar down to 1/3 cup.  It was perfect.  My in-laws raved about it.  My mother in law even wants the recipe (what???? really????)  YEA for an EXCELLENT, yummy pie.

Whoa Baby, was this pie GOOD! I made it last night for my family, and it is COMPLETELY GONE! The only thing that I did different was cook the apples until they were slightly soft, as another reviewer suggested. (I hate it when the apples aren't cooked enough.)One IMPORTANT thing to remember when doing that is to DRAIN the apples before making the filling- the apples give off a lot of water! Other than that, I didn't change anything, and it was a great pie!

Last year was the first time I used this recipe and this year I have several requests for a repeat performance.  I use Granny Smith apples and increase the baking time by 20 minutes (425 degrees for the first 20 to 25 minustes).  Also I prefer using the "Hershy's Classic Caramels" for an extra goooy sweet taste!

This pie was amazing! It was very delicious, and a definite make-again recipe, with only a few changes.
I was concerned about the pie being runny, so I added a tablespoon of flour to the 3 tablespoons of flour in the apple mixture. I also added a couple extra apples. It came out perfectly.
I poked holes in the crust and pre-baked it 10-12 minutes before I layered the taffy, apple, and caramels.
Next time, I would probably use a caramel dip that was pre-made, but only for convenience. The caramel candies worked fine. They melted really well, when I cut them into quarters. 
Definitely seal the top of the pie well so that the caramels don't seep out. 
I would definitely recommend this recipe. The caramel flavor is not super strong, but it adds a delicious twist to the typical apple pie.

Delicious.  The first time I made it I used the  caramel squares but I didn't feel like they melted around enough so I used the jar caramel that is for ice cream.  I have made it that way ever since.  It is a sweet pie but I like sweet and my husband is grateful I found the recipe as he was missing his mom's apple pie.

This is an outstanding recipe. It really is like eating chopped up caramel apples in a pie. A bit labor-intensive but worth all the trouble in the end. I even make this with my 5th-8th graders in the after-school culinary program where I teach. Delicious with a scoop of ice cream on top!

My husband said it was the best apple pie he's ever had.  I used half of the white sugar it called for, and used a large spoonful of jarred caramel just smeared in between.  Not runny at all.

This pie turned out amazing! I added a little bit of nutmeg along with the cinnamon, as well as some chopped pecans with the toffee layer. I used granny smith and braeburn apples along with an apple peeler/corer for even, thin slices. I'm not sure if the lattice top changes the bake time, but this is how I prepared the pie and ended up baking it for about 30-35 minutes after removing the foil. I will definitely bake this again and again!

use cortland apples in this recipe and increase the flour by 2 tablespoons. Found it to be very runny the first time. Cortland apples are the perfect apple , they keep their shape well and not overly sweet. Found the granny smith very bitter /tart.

Delicious, Delicious, Delicious!! I normally detest apple pie but after making this - I love apple pie!

What I did differently:
1. Instead of using caramel candy I used Smuckers brand fat free caramel topping, I drizzled it between two layers of the apples. 
2. I used store brand 'just roll out and bake' pie crusts. 
3. I brushed the crust and top of pie with slightly beaten egg. 
4. Completely avoided using foil and came out with a nicely golden and crispy dough. 

Note: I crumbled the 'taffy mixture' between layers of apples
I will definitely be making more of these pies during Christmas!

This was one of the pies I made for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. The caramel melted throughout the entire pie, it was amazing. I added the extra tablespoon of flour to the apple filling, which I am really glad I did otherwise it would have been too runny. I made my own crust and sprinkled sugar on the top. I made the pie the night before Thanksgiving and put it in the oven right before we sat down for dinner. The timing was perfect and I didn't have to worry about it interfering with the other cooking. I found it super easy and I plan on making it again next year.

I have made this every year for Thanksgiving and it has always been a huge hit! I used caramel apple dip instead of caramel candies this year, and it was INCREDIBLE. I definitely recommend increasing the flour. Best recipe ever!!

This was great, I left out the caramels and cut down the sugar, also used a bit more flour but it wasn't necessary, next time will stick to recipe's flour quantity.  I used a cornmeal crust that went really well with the sweetness of this recipe.

I made this last year for thanksgiving and it was great! Everyone loved it. It was the first pie gone. I did take some other user's advice though, i used a little more flour and its turned out nicely - not runny at all. I recommend this to everyone for a sweet, desert.

"better than my mom's" Need I say more! As with many other reviewers, I cut the white sugar to 1/3 cup and upped the flour to 5T. I also baked at 425 for first 15 minutes, then 375 for 30 minutes. I used pink ladys which really hold their texture well. I only had a 10.5" pie dish and I think that eliminated the spill issue many others had. It was perfect fit and sweetness. See photo 15.The "French Pastry Pie Crust" was perfectly flaky and baked to a nice golden brown even without an egg/milk wash (which I forgot to do). Happy baking!

We loved this, only change was as advised to double flour and 6 cups of apples.  The first time I did caramels as directed, but when pie cools then so the caramels and they are hard when you bite into them. The 2nd I actually melted them in microwave and poured half on of apples and other half on last part of apples, much better in our opinion. It does get hard as well, but not in big junks, so much easier to eat...  This is a great recipe and we love it

This recipe was delicious but needed a few adjustments.  The caramel didn't really melt into the pie filling, so next time I will either use caramel from the jar or melt caramels and mix into the butter/brown sugar/flour mixture.  Also, I omitted the 2/3 cup white sugar and we still thought it was plenty sweet.  I added 1 tsp. nutmeg and just mixed all the ingredients together in a bowl and then put in crust.  With these adjustments, this pie was devoured!

This pie is absolutely delicious!!!  We added 5T flour to the apples as well as nutmeg and cloves.  It is so good and so easy to make!  We also used a combination of empire, liberty and macintosh apples.

This was wonderful- rich and delicious, and not too caramel-y.   Following the advice of reviews here, I made a few changes: used only 1/2 cup of sugar and 1/4 cup of flour in the filling, used 6 cups of Granny Smith apples, and substituted about 1/2 bag of Kraft Caramel Nibs (the little round caramels in the baking aisle) for the regular caramels.   Made it with a vodka-based crust from Cooks Illustrated, and it was amazing!   This will be my standard apple pie from now on.

Couldn't think of a way to make this any better, except maybe to take out all the calories!  Holy cow, this was good.  Hubby and I ate 2/3 of the pie the first night.

I've made this pie 3 times now and everyone has raved about it every single time!  The only thing I did different from the recipe, like many others did, I increased the 3 tbsp of flour to 6 tbsp and used 6 apples instead of 5.  At the rate of requests I'm getting, I will be making this pie MANY more times!

This was the first pie I have ever made.  It was a BIG hit on fourth of July.  Next time I will make 2, there wasn't enough to go around!!  I did quarter the caramels and my total cooking time was about 1 hour and 10 minutes.  Super sweet, so be ready for a sugar rush!

So far I have made this twice and it's been wonderful BOTH times.  The 1st time I made it I followed the recipe to a T and unfortunately the caramel didn't melt so we ended up having chunks of caramels in our pie.  The 2nd time I 1/4 the caramel and cooked the pie for an additional 10 minutes being careful not to burn the crust and still there were chunks.  Don't know what i'm doing wrong but I think i'll 1/2 the caramel next time.  Wonderful recipe, THANKS!

I love love love this recipe. I made a smaller pie without so much apples and stuff in it since it was just me and my man eating thanksgiving alone. It turned out wonderful and didn't have a problem with it overflowing with caramel. I loved it and will make again very very very soon!!!

Delish! I am a fan! The caramels provide some extra yumminess to the traditional apple pie. To save time, I used a Marie Callendar's ready made defrosted pie crust and a streusel topping. The streusel topping I used was: 3/4 c flour, 1/2 t. cinammon, 1/2 c brown sugar, 3/4 c oats (cut in 1/2 c butter till crumbly). I also used 3 granny smith apples & 3 jonathan apples per another reviewer and it was great! My pie needed 1 hour & 10 min. to cook.

I made this pie for the first time for Thanksgiving and also gave it to another friend to make as well. Both of the pies were delicious and received RAVE reviews!!!   I followed the advice of other reviewers and used 6 tbs of flour and 6 cups of apples. It was not watery at all. I did have to bake it for about 1 hr 15 min to be sure the crust was done. I made a crumb topping and it so AMAZING! I also used THREE different types of apples (fuji, granny smiths, Jonagold) and caramel creams divided into thirds.    Great recipe and easy to make!

I use granny smith apples, and omit the 2/3 cup white sugar (the taffy is sweet enough).  This recipe is fantastic!!!!!  It's my go-to apple pie recipe, and I get many requests for it.  Delicious!!

I gave this recipe 5 stars because 10 wasn't available.  We could never eat a plain ol'apple pie again after having this!  The only changes I made were 6 tablespoons of flour instead of 3.  It was not runny at all.  I had made it several times now and 6 is the magic number!  I also use 4 large granny smith and 2 large golden delicous apples.  I also use 3/4 of a bag of Kraft caramels.  This pie is truly decadent and sinful.  Also, when baking I suggest (depending on how well your oven works of course) a half hour baking with the foil and almost another half hour without.  This way the crust is flaky like it should be top & bottom.

A good recipe for caramel apple pie is almost impossible to find.  This one exceeded my expectations.  After reading reviews of it being too liquidy, I simply omitted the milk.  It came out with just enough moisture.  I did a lattice top and had no problems with the caramel overflowing, probably because my apples were so thinly sliced, about 1/8 of an inch.  They were also layered neatly so the surface remained relatively flat.  I added 4 more caramel squares and I think I would probably use more next time, about 30 in all.  I really wanted the caramel to shine in this recipe.  I think the lattice top pie makes it so much better, because some of the caramel is exposed at the surface and hardens a bit more than if it was covered up by crust.  I will make this again and again!

I made this for my family today and they LOVED it!  My son has been asking for an apple pie and I thought I would try this version for a change...so glad I did.  I cut the sugar in the filling a bit and added 4 tablespoons flour instead of 3 and the consistency was perfect.

This pie was gone in a blink this Thanksgiving. I used caramel dip from the fruit section at the market instead of the caramels, and it came out so wonderful. Perfect consistency, and tasted so good! I will make it again for Christmas, and as often as pie is called for!

Wonderful pie!  I used refrigerated Pillsbury pie crust, and made the pie exactly as instructed.  I didn't find it to be too runny, but I did make it the night before we ate it, so it may have had time to set up.  My hubby, who is not the biggest sweets-person in the world, raved about it!

Let me start by saying I've never made an apple pie before. I made this recipe for an Apple Pie Throw down (think Bobby Flay) in my office and I WON hands down. It came out PERFECT and sweet and delicious. I went apple picking and used GALA apples. I added a bit of a twist to it. I like Pecans, so I lined the edges with pecans to make it pretty. 
Thank you. Awesome recipe. This is now my apple pie of choice. So much so that I came home and made another one the same night with the rest of my apples.

I've been making this pie for years now, and it's always excellent. Tastes just like a caramel apple baked in a pie. As others have suggested, I reduce the white sugar to 1/3 of a cup. Also, to avoid having to peel caramels and cutting them to make them smaller, I just buy caramel topping in a jar and drizzle it generously over both layers of apples. I prefer the all natural mexican cajeta made with goats milk. You can find it at most latin grocers.

This is always the first pie to be eaten at all my family events.  I have been baking it for a couple years now and it is one my most requested list.  Everyone loves it from my 4 year old neice to my grandpa!  We typically add more caramels, and more taffy, but we are sweet-aholics!  Great recipe!

I have made this pie 3 times so far and it has turned out great each time!  I quarter the caramels instead of halving them and I use 2 Fuju, 2 Granny Smith and 2 Golden Delicious apples.  I have been using the Pillsbury crust, although I plan to try my hand at making a crust the next time I make this pie!  It is delicious!

I made this for a holiday Halloween party and it was amazing. I have made it several times since then, including Christmas day and will be sure to make it a staple of my holiday season. I added about 1.5cups of apples to the recipe and tossed the apples in pecan meel as well as the lemon juice and sugar mixture. Add nutmeg and you can't go wrong. a great recipe all around.

Yummy!   I omitted making the taffy, reduced the white sugar to 1/3 cup, increased flour to 4 T. and added 1 tsp. vanilla.  I also made my own caramel sauce rather than using caramels from the store.  Baked with a homemade buttermilk pie crust.  This was a huge hit in my family.

This is the best pie ever!  I read all the other reviews and made some adjustments, I used 7 granny smith apples, reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup, increased the flour to 4 tbs, cut the caramels in qtrs, and added some chopped walnuts.  It turned out perfect, I had no trouble with it being runny nor was it too sweet.  I will make this pie for parties and special dinners from now on.

Very good even without the taffy filling. I also used six cups of apples and mixed granny smith with jonathan.  It wasn't runny at all.

Haven't tasted it yet but have just prepared it ready to cook just before dinner tomorrow and wow how easy is this to prepare. It was so simple. I just hope it is going to taste as good as it looks and smells. I'll get back will the results after feeding the hungry hoards at new years dinner.
Thats us tried it . It was great and every one enjoyed. I was a little wary of all the 'too sweet' comments so I used four large cooking apples instead as they are more bitter it worked fine and cooking it 24hrs in advance then reheating individual portions slightly seems to bannish the too runny problem as I found the consistency perfect. Just enough liquid this way to miw great with ice-cream as it melts over the top.  FANTASTIC-Go on everyone give it a go it is sooooo easy!

After reading reviews, I too added some extra flour to thicken up the inside.  I got wonderful comments from everyone who ate this pie! I made a rustic looking pie. Instead of using two crusts, I found a crumb topping recipe on Allrecipes and folded over the first crust onto the crumb topping. It must've need a little more butter cut into the crumb topping because it didn't melt and get crunchy.  So, about 5 minutes before being done baking, I squirted the caramel apple sundae topping all over the crumb topping and it made it SOOO yummy!  Will definitly be making again...also have handed out the recipe a TON!  :)

This pie is so good; I made it in a rectangular 9x13 pan with one of my favorite pie crust recipes.  After my first bite, I was a convert (I don't normally go for apple pie, but the caramel  made this one great.)  Thanks for a great recipe that I will be making for years!

I whipped this pie up for a Fourth of July party at my boyfriends house last year.  I was really nervous that wouldn't like my cooking and thought the taffy mixture would make it too sweet so I left it out.  The boys loved it so much they ate the whole pie and put a note on the bottom of the pan to "Make another one next time you come over"  To this day I make this pie everytime there is something special going on.  I love this one!

The flavor of the apples were pretty good. Did not care for the texture of the caramel. Next time if I add caramel to the pie it will be the ice cream topping kind.

Wow!! I’m not an apple pie fan but this was SPECTACULAR!  I made it my own. I cooked my Granny Smith apples, added walnuts, melted the caramel and used a crumb crust on top with the nuts and caramel drizzled over the top.  It looks and taste amazing!  This has become my family’s favorite pie.  Be sure to let it cool for an hour and the second day is even better.

Suppostedly this is great!!!!  I made this pie and my ol' pumpkin for a large family get together.  I guess us women didn't eat fast enough (we didn't shovel the food in our mouths), because the guys had every bit of this pie devoured before we got to the dessert table.  They all raved and raved.  I even heard a few of them tell their wives to GET the recipe from me.

If you like traditional apple pie this is not the pie for you.  My husband has been asking me to make apple pie for years and I finally did yesterday.  I was expecting a much different reaction after all of the wonderful reviews for this pie.  He said caramel does not belong in apple pie.  So if your family is more conservative, do not choose this one.  Not being an apple pie lover myself, this pie did nothing for me either.

WOW! I just made this pie using granny smith apples from one of my trees.  I did reduce the sugar by half as suggested by another rater. (Thanks so much!) I drove it to my husband's place of work and within 15 minutes I got a call and "it was a "BIG HIT".  So much that they wanted seconds but there was only one pie, oh well.  Thanks Emtmom for sharing such a fantastic recipe with all of us!  This is definitely a keeper!

I used honey instead of white sugar, and it made  for a very soft flavor. I also had to bake for about 25 minutes longer. This was the first pie I ever made, and brought it to a dinner party and everyone really enjoyed it.

The pie was good but there was way to much liquid. I had to pour some out. I also had to put the pie in for another 10mins cause the carmels didn't melt all the way and the apples weren't cooked.

Great and Easy!  I did however cut the amount of white sugar way back - next time (and there will be a next time) I will omit it all together, it was more then sweet enough.

I followed the directions exactly, and while it was definitely gobbled up quickly, I thought it was very messy and too sweet (rarely is something too sweet for my liking) ... next time I will half the sugar and the caramels; I think this way the pie will be firmer and the apples won't be completely overpowered by the caramel.

I made this for the office pie contest and took home 1st prize out of 10+ entries.  I took note of the reviews, and added 2 tbsp of flour to keep it from being runny.  I used only Granny Smith apples and took advice to use the caramel dip as opposed to caramel candies.  I used about a 1/2 tub of dip per pie (made two).  I did not alter the sugar content since I was using the green apples.  It turned out perfect.  I’m glad I didn’t alter the sugar content since it was on the tart side, but it was perfect for us.  It is now a family and office favorite!

We have made this a few times.  The first time we made it exactly like the recipe says.  Our caramels didn't melt.  So the next time used caramel syrup.  Turned out excellent.

This is a delicious pie! I've made 3 different apple pie recipes in the last week. This one is definitely the best. Reminds me a tiny bit of McDonald's apple pies but better. I used half a container of Marzettis carmel apple dip instead of the candies. I used 4 Tblsp Flour in the taffy mixture as well. 6 large granny Smith apples was a great amount of apples for me. Came out perfect! Not going to bother with the other apple pie recipes after this!

This filling is DELICIOUS! However, instead of topping with a second pie crust, I add a homemade crumble on top - 1/3c sugar 3/4c flour & 6tbsp cold butter pulsed together in a food processor and spread on top.

This was delicious! I cut the sugar in half for the apple filling. I also added 4 Tbs of flour instead of the 3. The pie wasn't runny at all! I will probably use caramel apple dip instead of individual caramels because they didn't melt like I wanted. There were bites of just apple pie and then you'd randomly get a bite of still chewy caramel. I'd like the caramel to be mixed in more with the apples. Overall, great recipe!

I love apple pie and have tried many different recipes over the years. I will never try another. I have found my perfect apple pie!

I read the other reviews before making this pie. Although I did increase the apples to 6 cups (because I like a really full pie) and I cut the white sugar back to 1/4 cup (because I don't like overly sweet desserts), I think the main reason people had problems with the pie being mushy or runny was because of the cooking time. I baked mine covered for 20 minutes and then uncovered for almost 40 minutes - until it was golden brown like the picture. The pie filling was set up perfectly and didn't run a bit. Also, the caramels, which I had cut into fourths, were completely melted. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Loved this recipe! My husbands favorite kind if pie and he really liked this. He thoughr the botton crust needed a few more minutes so I may prebake the bottom crust for a bit next time. Easy recipe and beats unwrapping individual caramels!

Everyone that has tried this loved it.  The carmel was kind of tough to work with.  I tried squares, cut up into smaller chunks.  That was a lot of work!  Next time I'll buy the carmel apple wraps and use them.  Thanks for submitting.

I make this a couple times a year and make 4 pies and freeze three. Everyone loves this pie! I increased flour to about 1/3 cup to keep it from being runny. I also brush top with caramel coffee creamer instead of plain milk. I am not much of a baker, but this pie always turns out great! I also use store bought crust, seems to work fine!

This pie was fantastic! I followed the recipe exactly, except for adding a couple extra tbsp of flour to try and help with the runniness. I've tried other caramel apple recipes, this one is definitely the carameliest! Everyone loved it, will make it again, thanks :)

This was the first pie I've ever made so I carefully read through most reviews.  I did make some changes, I cut the sugar content to 1/3 cup instead of 2/3. I added 4 Tablespoons of flour instead of 3. I bought the caramel in the container instead of the squares. I used 6 cups of apples instead of 5.  I also precooked the apples with the sugar to soften before following the rest of the recipe.  This pie looked beautiful, but it's very rich!!  I am not a sweet tooth by any means, however my husband is and we both agreed that using only granny smith apples is not the way to go, it made the pie a little tart.  So maybe mixing up different kinds of apples along with granny smith might be better next time.  I don't think it's b/c I cut the sugar, the tartness was tasted as we bit into the apple pieces.  Also, I drizzled the caramel over the apples, next time I will make sure the pie is covered with a thin layer of caramel, so we could taste more of it. I used this recipe with another recipe called "Ruth's Grandma's Pie Crust"...it was awesome!!!!  I also used the Struessel Pie Topping someone else posted about, very good! Next time I will try a regular crust top for this pie, only adding different apples and more caramel!  I also had to cook it all for 1 hour and 10 minutes.  Great recipe and a very rich pie, I just wish I had different apples in it, it would have been PERFECT!!

An extra tablespoon of flour in both the taffy and filling mixes greatly helped to cut down on the runny-ness in the pie. I would also recommend cooking at 400 degrees to fully melt the caramels. That said, this is a near perfect pie in my opinion.

We made 8 of these pies with a streussel topping for Thanksgiving gifts for our friends/family..made exactly how recipe called..let them cool over night and wrapped in the morning. Didn't cut into our pie until dinner the next day, and found it to be very runny/slimy (more like a cobbler) we scooped the "pie" into bowls and topped w/vanilla ice cream, and it was FANTASTIC! everyone loved them! I am making another few tonight and an going to experiment a little trying to make them less runny. Am thinking about increasing the flour and decreasing the caramels-based on other's reviews...

Absolutely delicious! I love that you used halved candy caramels instead of making your own, just a simple shortcut. Taste was great, and the consistency of the sauce was perfect.

Very tasty and easy to make (of course even easier for me since I used store-bought pie crust)!  It was a little too sweet for my taste, but I knew that would probably be the case going into it (considering the description and ingredients).  But my husband loved it and said it wasn't too sweet at all.  When I make it again, I think I'll cut the taffy and caramel amounts in half. I also used 6 cups of apples, as previous reviewers mentioned. Already looking forward to my second piece!

If you like caramel apples, and you like apple pie, try this recipe.  I love fall season because of the plentiful (delicious) apples.  We went apple picking at a local orchard, and I have been making every apple dish that I can find!  This one was a HUGE hit with my boyfriend and I.  I did add an extra tablespoon of flour, and I used three different varieties of apples (golden delicious, macintosh, and johnathan).  Yummy!

A wonderful recipe! Easy as pie!
My family and friends went completely wild over this pie. My father told me that it was even better than his mother's apple pie and that I absolutely had to make it on holidays or else! I served it warm with homemade vanilla ice cream. I promise it will be a hit.

I had been looking for a comparable recipe to the restaurant apple "desserts" offered.  So, my expectations were high and boy, I wasn't disappointed!  My husband has not stopped talking about this dessert!  I made it exactly as directed and it was a huge hit - I'm making another one this week (by popular demand)!  Thanks a bunch!

Wonderful, tasty pie!  I might suggest to reduce brown sugar to 1/3 cup as this was a bit sweet for me. However, none of my family had any problems with it. It was delicious and eaten in record time. Nothing left to take home and rave reviews!

Great concept for those that like a variation from standard apple pie. definitely need to increase amount of carmel. I doubled and still could have put more in to get a true carmel taste.

YUMMIE! if i could give this 100 starts i would! it IS really sweet, but omgosh, so yummie! you gotta at least TRY IT! the only thing i did diffrent is i ADDED MORE flour to the APPLE mIX by about double what it calls for b/c everytime i make apple pie it turns out runny, and i wanted a good pie this time round! OH AND I ADDED ABOUT 6 caramels and made a CRIPSPY CrUMB topping instead of the regular pie crust top, AND you HAVE TO have a over flow CATCHER for this! 
HAVE FUN!

I made this for my son's preschool Thanksgiving feast and no one really liked it.  It got a little watery.  I used the caramel dip like was suggested maybe I should have used regular caramels.  Will try again but not for a while.

Have made this recipe two years in a row now for Thanksgiving and everyone loves it. With the caramels it can be a little too sweet so I usually cut back on the sugar. I usually make the pie the night before, then just put it in the oven right before we sit down for dinner, turn the oven off and let the residual heat warm up the pie. Perfect.

For those that don't "taste" the caramel:Do not halve the caramels, plus add more caramel candies. Also add almost a cup of the brown sugar (I used Splenda blended brown sugar), half cup flour  snd 3/4 stick of butter. I used Granny Smiths. The tartness of the apple contrasts well with caramel. Finally, if you have Torani Caramel flavoring, drizzle just a little bit on the top.

This turned out okay, I had to use carmel topping because I couldn't find carmels at my grocery store.  After baking the pie filling was a little runny but not bad.  Probably because of the carmel sauce.  It was gone in 2 days so it must have been good, I just wasn't impressed with it myself.

This pie was awsome! I followed others' suggestions, and used caramel dip, and added more apples. I also put a crumble topping on the crust top. It was a big hit! I actually won a contest with it!

I made this in my stoneware deep dish baker and used a boughten crust, and it was so delicious!  I only had 14 caramels, but it didn't matter because it turned out fabulous.

It turned out a little too soupy the first time I made it.  The second time I added a little extra flour to the apples and I used a whole bag of kraft caramel bits found in the baking aisle instead of 20 halved caramels. It was a big hit, everyone asked for the recipe!

This pie is very good. My husband is a very traditional pie person, but he was like, man, this is good. I had to bake it about 20 minutes longer to get the apples cooked all the way. I added 1 extra Tablespoon of flour to the apples and cut the sugar in half and it was not runny at all. Turned out extra special for a nice fall day.

This is the best pie I have ever made - and I get rave reviews every time I make it. It is a little extra work, but it is worth it. My husband requests it instead of a birthday cake every year. I also (like some others) increase the number of apples. I use 6-7 cups and bake in a deep dish pie plate. I also found it is really good with a combined butter/shortening pie crust. Serve it warm with vanilla ice cream, and it is to die for!

Ok I did change it. I used my regular apple pie recipe, decreased the sugar, no taffy mix and 1/2 a container carmel dip. I only used less sugar because so many people comment on how "too sweet" it was, I wish I would have done the full sugar,I felt it should have been sweeter.

This was awsome. I had never thought to add carmels to a pie. Great idea! It turned out great and was not too hard. A bit time consuming, but well worth it. I used the "Miracle Baking Powder Pie Crust" recipe from this site. It is the best.

Excellent apple filling; close to the one I currently use. Tried sarahnadine's topping for a different kind and didn't care for it, so will go back to my own standard struesel topping that everyone seems to like; I will continue to use my own apple pie recipe, but will be slipping some caramel dip into my recipe! Thanks for the post.

This pie is awesome!  Everyone in my family loved it.  I cut the caramels into fourths rather than halves, and they melted perfectly.  I also used a few less caramels than the recipe called for.  This pie is good when hot - but yes it's runny and messy.  It's a better idea to wait until it cools and becomes the perfect consistency - I think it tastes even better then, if that's possible!

I have to say I really wary of making this only because my baking is not the best and after reading the reviews was afraid it wouldn't turn out, but it turned out great, I had no problems with it being runny.  Sold them at a non for profit bake sale.  I did make one to test one the family of course and they loved it. Thanks for the post.

This was really tastey, and sweet. I think I may have served it to hot because the carmel was too liquidy, and made it hard to slice and scopp the pieces.  I will make this again, but I will serve it luke warm instead of reheating.

I confess!  I've been passing this recipe off as my own for a few years now.  I've had marriage proposals over it, the family insists on it every holiday, and last year a fight almost broke out over it at our Christmas party (true!).  This recipe rocks!

The flavor of this pie is incredible!  I had the same problem with it being a bit runny, so next time will reduce the sugar and try it with only granny smith apples (as others have suggested, thanks for the tips!)

Very delicious pie, and the only reason it gets 5 stars is because mine came out very runny, no matter what temperature.  Next time I'll half the sugar to try to ammend, and I'll cut the caramels in 1/4's cause they didn't all melt during baking so some were a bit hard and chewy.  Otherwise a treat to eat!!

Absolutely delicious!!  It came out perfect the first time I made and have made it many times since.  It is always gone in one day.  I gave it as a gift to my daughter's Mother's Day Out teacher and she said her family fought over it.  Will continue to make this for a long time to come.

I made this pie for my daddy for father's day.  I really did not like the taste of this pie and neither did my father, but everybody else in my family did. They ate the whole thing.  I took the advice of another reviewer and halved the sugar in the apples and it did NOTHING for this pie.  Next time I will use the correct amount of sugar, half of the flour and twice the cinnamon. I sliced the apple on my v-slicer and they were perfect.

The caramels made the apples taste even better.  This is a wonderful recipe.  I will be looking for a better pie crust recipe next time.

Just made this pie tonight for a dinner party and it was a huge success.  One of my guest said that he didn't think he liked apple pie until he had tasted mine.  It was the hit of the meal.  I halved the amount of sugar and used all granny smith for my apples and it turned out perfectly.  Try this recipe, you won't be disappointed.

This had great flavor, but it was really runny.  It had bits of carmel which were yummy I thought.  Just have to figure out why so runny.

This was a great recipe.  I took the advice of some of the other people that reviewed this pie.
First, I cut out the white sugar totally and used granny smith apples (to keep it from being too sweet.)  Second, I was afraid of it being runny so I cut the butter back a tablespoon and added another tablespoon of flour.  I also used a crust I got from allrecipes.  3C flour, 1 1/4C shortening, 1 egg, 1T Vinager, 1t salt and 4T H20

I like the flavor of this pie, but way to much liquid and the apples weren't done.  I've tried it twice thinking I'd done something wrong.  I will probably try one more time and either bake it at a higher temp. or for about 15 more minutes.

If you enjoy sweet pies this is the one for you! My family loved it - I just felt it was too sweet. A great one to make because they loved it and I won't eat it.  Overall great pie.

YUMMY!  I had never made a pie before, so I was very nervous about the outcome.  But my neighbor kids didn't even come up for air as they gobbled it down.  I brought the leftovers into work the next day and got rave reviews.
It tastes good cold, and scrumdiddlylicious warm!
