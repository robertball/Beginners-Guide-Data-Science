Want to influence relatives and win friends?  This recipe was excellent!  However, I used what I had available.  Coors Lite beer, chicken stock w/ one beef bullion cube and a course mustard with horseradish.  Wow! This was good.  Potato's and carrots were perfect and I did not cook them as long on top of the stove as suggested prior to putting the roast into the oven.  First meal made with my new Tromintina brand 6.5qt Dutch Oven -red (WALMART Web ordered $54.00 Nice!).

Performed all of the steps prior to placing the roast on top in a skillet and stockpot, transferred everything to a slow cooker and finished it there. my 3lb roast was at 145 degrees after about 3 hours on high. Delicious!

This was perfect for this cold fall day! Made the house smell like a yeast feast and I hope the neighbors were green with envy all afternoon! I love this and the family ate it up! I found a 6pk of Fall brew in the bargain bin and used my chuck roast I got on sale, for this outstanding dinner! I roasted some brussel sprouts and tossed them in to the hot tub as well! I started this at 12:30pm and by 3:30, it was fork tender and just waiting for us to catch up. I served this with buttered hoggie rolls from the bakery down the street. Delicious! Thank You Pam:) I am a happy wife tonight!! Patty

I can't even say how many pot roast's I have made in my lifetime, but this recipe takes the cake. I cooked this on high in my crockpot for about 7 hours. The meat had tons of flavor and was very tender. I cut the veggies a little on the large side and they cooked perfectly. They didn't get mushy and held their shape. Thanks for sharing an awesome recipe.

This was an awesome roast recipe! We totally enjoyed this, this is comfort food at it's Best! Thank You for this recipe.I will be using this one regularly. I added 2 stalks of celery to the vegetables. I love recipes that make their own gravy too!

This is a fairly good roast and it cooked quickly in the oven, which was nice.  I personally didn't love the tomato paste.  It gave it a bit of an odd flavor.  And the veggies got too soft, which for some reason doesn't seem to happen in my crock pot.

Very tasty! Made this in a crock pot (on low for 10 hours or so) and everything was tender and delicious.

Would have been even better poured over mashed potatoes instead of having potatoes in with it, however, that's just me being picky :-)

The only changes I made were to add some chopped up green beans (they were about to go bad, had to put them to good use!)

Left out tomato paste (didn't want to buy a can of it for one TBSP). Veggies got too soft. I used Karelian pot roast, which is actually chunks of pork and beef instead of a whole roast. It ended up more like a beef stew than a roast. However, the flavor was excellent. I dont think the flour quite thickend it enough. Will have to try this again cooking veggies less on stove. Or maybe not cook them on the stove at all, and just saute onion and garlic and then pour stock and beer and flour in to make the 'gravy' part. Then put veggies in, and meat, and put it in the oven.

Roast was fantastic.  I did have the same vegetable problem as the above reviewer.  I ended up mashing it all up and having some "rustic" mashed potatoes with the meat and they were delicious.

Delicious! Just added about a 1/4 cup of Bullseye BBQ sauce with Guinness - took it over the top. Great recipe.

Flavorless.  Cooking the roast in beer had the same effect as cooking brats/dogs in beer - it reduces the saltiness of the meat and adds a beer flavor.  Unfortunately, that's just not what a good roast needed.  Veggies were equally unimpressive.  I will not attempt again.  Although, it did inspire me to add some stout to my corn beef and cabbage recipe and that was delish!

So. Darn. Good. I made a few minor adjustments, but kept it mostly the same.  I omitted the flour just because I prefer it that way and used Squirt soda instead of beer (that's what I had, but it made it so tender good).  I also added a little celery salt and rosemary.  I baked it in my dutch oven for 5.5  hours at 250 and added the veggies for the last hour so they weren't all mushy.  When the veggies became tender, I pulled out the meat and gravy, turned my oven to broil, put the dutch oven with veggies back into the oven with the top off and took them out when they were golden-brown.  Gorgeous.  Husband and I have decided that we're going to be making a lot more meals in our dutch oven and will definitely be doing this one again (and again and again).

This was delicious! I subbed ketchup for tomato paste. Could maybe back off on the garlic and broth a little bit next time. There was quite a bit of liquid left. Also, make sure to cut the carrots and potatoes into big chunks, otherwise they will cook too fast and turn to mush.

Surprisingly my first roast to make in the oven (I've only done slow cooker)!  Very good!  My dutch oven was barely big enough to hold all of this, I really had to pack it down!  Great flavor and don't be afraid to use the whole beer, I was a stopped at about 3/4 of the bottle, and with I would have done it all.   I left out the tomato paste cause I didn't have it.  We really enjoyed this!  Thanks!

This was great! Time constraints had me, brown meat and then put in crock pot. I didn't have dark beer, but the results were still moist and yummy. I'm looking forward to eating the leftovers.
31 May  2012 Still don't own a dutch oven, but I did buy porter for the recipe. Worked great in the crockpot after searing the roast in a fry pan. Still fabulous.

Pot roast came out nice and tender, but the mustard flavor was a little bit too strong for my taste. Will try this again with some modifications next time.

So yummy!  I used potato flour instead of the white wheat flour in order to keep the meal gluten free.  Also, pureeing the mushrooms with some of the beer allowed my family to thoroughly enjoy the flavor they add without ever knowing they were even there!  And what a perfect, smooth gravy is created as it cooks.  It was delicious and we'll be eating this again!

I used Harpoon Oktoberfest, omitted the brown sugar, dijon mustard, and tomato paste. Browned veggies over stovetop but transferred everything to the Crockpot for 3 hours on high. Very tasty! The onion soup mix recipe seems so boring now.

Pretty darned tasty. Differences from recipe as written: I used a 1.5 lb eye of round roast, an Oatmeal Stout, dried thyme, 1/2 Vidalia onion, unpeeled potatoes, and Grey Poupon mustard. I suggest using less thyme. 3 tablespoons was a little overwhelming. And perhaps if you added more flour, you'd have a thicker gravy. This was fairly runny. I found I needed to salt the roast liberally.

Roast was amazing! I only had Bud Lite, which worked fine.  Roasted it longer at 250 and all the veggies were great. Definately addiding this to my file.

Cooked a 3 lb chuck roast from frozen for 1 hour in a pressure cooker using this recipe. I added some Worcestershire sauce and omitted the veggies except some onion. It was wonderful. What can go wrong when you use beer, garlic, and Dijon mustard??? Thanks for the recipe.

I used this for venison roast. It turned out really well! Very tender and that is no easy feat when you're working with venison! I skipped the tomato paste too. I added in some rosemary and used veggie stock with beef bullion.

We made this pot roast in the crock pot. We cooked it all day one Sunday and the meat just fell apart. It was wonderful! The only things I'd change about this recipe was maybe add a little less beer, there was a too strong beer flavor for our tastes.

We just got a dutch oven and this is the first recipe we've tried. It was SOOOO delicious. Much more flavorful and tender than using my crock pot for roasts. I thought the flavors of the sauce went well together and really didn't taste like beer (I don't like beer). We also cook up some whole wheat egg noddles and stirred them into the vegetables/broth. Made an amazing meal!

Wonderful recipe, even without the beer!  (Didn't have any, so just substituted more beef broth for the liquid.)  My family loved it and I'll definitely be making this again and again!

My family enjoyed this recipe. I added some celery, used honey mustard instead of the dijon and used a Octoberfest beer. It was very flavorful and a new must have in my house!

Was absolutely the best pot roast I have had in a long time. Omitted the tomato paste, used spicey brown instead of Dijon mustard and used a black lager definitely will make this again!!!

5 star recipe!  I omitted the beer and made up the difference in liquid with extra beef broth but thats the only change i made.  It was tender like it had been been cooked in teh crockpot, but the meat kept its strucural integrity so it could still be sliced.  I don't think i'll ever make roast beef in a crockpot again!!  (Oh i guess i didn't precook the veggies either)  In the future i will make extra gravy.  For all the liquid that was in the pot, there was not enough for leftovrs the next day =(

I've made this a few times now and we all loved it. I made small changes only because we didn't want potatoes and wanted buttered egg noodles on the side. I did mess up 1 time I cut the carrots too small they almost disappeared which in our house is a good thing, as my better half hates them. This is a recipe I'll keep forever, thank you for sharing it with us on this site.

This has to be the best roast I have ever made. It was so tender and moist, you could cut it with a fork.
I don't think you could ruine this recipe no matter what you did to it because I tried lol. !st of all my roast was a very small one about 2 pounds and when I decided to cook it, I realized that it was 4 pm and I had not even started anything yet, so to hurry things up I browned the roast in one pan and did all the rest in another pan just to hurry things up, then combined it all in one cast iron dutch oven and threw it in the oven.
When dinner time arrived I opened up the oven and stuck in the probe to see if it was getting anywhere close to 160 degrees and nearly died when it read 222 degrees, I told my hubby I ruined another roast.
Well, I could not believe how yummy the whole dinner was, the veggies and the gravy  was like eating a thick stew and the roast was so tender and moist.
Now I have to try it again and watch the roast closer to get it right this time and see if it can get even better than this was. It was the best roast that I have ever tasted.

The prep time on this is the only thing I take issue with. Maybe I peel/chop slower than others, but this took me like 45 minutes to prep. I used Guiness beer and added a flavor shot.

Nice flavors, but I think it is better without the sugar.  I also would recommen that you saute the paste with the vegs, adds to the complexity of the flavor profile.

Nice pot roast recipe.  Had to tweak it a bit (used regular mustard and had only one can of beef broth on hand) but it still came out good.  Roast was flavorful and tender.

This recipe was simple and delicious. I read some of the other comments about the vegetables being soggy so I didn't brown the vegetables first (I just threw them in). The meal was a big hit!

I used 1/2 tablespoon of dried thyme, no mustard, no tomato paste, and lots of seasoned pepper and seasoned salt to fit my family's tastes--it could have used a bit more salt, but was tasty.

This was a great recipe. I was surprised at how good it was. I browned the roast, and used the crock pot with large cut vegetables. I used Guinness stout for the beer.

I followed the ingredients list and directions almost exactly. The only difference was that my roast was only 2-1/4 lbs. I used Guinness 200th Anniversary Export Stout for the beer. This is one of the best pot roast recipes, if not the best, I've ever cooked. It also lends itself to experimentation with other ingredients. Horseradish would probably taste good in it. I can also see myself trying a Tex-Mex version with chipotles and other ingredients. Great recipe!

Fabulous recipe.  I re-hydrated a dry "gourmet" mushroom mix (from Costco), using about 1 1/2 cups mushrooms and 2 cups very hot water. Also used unpeeled fingerling potatoes. Covered for about one hour. The brine was beautiful, dark, and aromatic, and I added that to the pot along with the mushrooms.  I baked it in a cast iron enamel crock pot in the oven at 350F for about 4 hours.  The flavor was amazing, and the meat was so tender, you didn't even need a knife.  This is a keeper. Not sure why someone would say it tasted like beer. I used dark beer, and it just added a great wholesome flavor to the whole dish. Frankly, I think it's better than using red wine.

Oh my gosh!! I swear this is the best pot roast I've ever made!! I went looking for a method of cooking pot roast, not so much for the ingredients, so the beer wasn't the attracting feature. I have cooked many pot roasts over the years, with varying results. Sometimes the meat is just chewy and tough. But this recipe....WOW! Very moist. Very tender. I used just carrots and parsnips. And here's the really weird thing, I didn't have any beef broth, beer or tomato paste. I used about a cup of white wine and the rest was water and I used catsup in place of the tomato paste. Even with all these changes it was so awesome I'm still thinking about how good it was. Sometime I want to try it with beef or chicken broth and tomato paste. My roast was done about 15 minutes before the indicated time. Thanks so much for your recipe. It's a keeper for sure!!

Great dinner. I used Consommé soup with 1/2 can of water in place of beef stock. Also, just squirted some ketchup instead of tomato paste (a trick I use in chicken soup to give a golden color).

I have made many pot roasts recipes but the hubby really liked this one.I used my slow cooker on low for 8 hrs. I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't precook the carrots or potatotes and used the only beer I had which was Kokonee . I put everything cooked into the crock pot stirred in the potatoes and carrots and placed the pot roast on top. It came out perfectly. We don't eat gravey but if i had wanted some I would have have to add more flour as the juices were not thickened.Thanks for the recipe.

Best pot roast I can remember. I don't  like overstated flavors and this  recipe balances all the elements quite tastefully. Naturally you want to start with good meat, and searing is essential. The only change was leaving out mushrooms, only because I forgot to buy them. I'm certain it would be even better had I included them.

My first try at a pot roast and it came out very well. I used a slow cooker rather than a dutch oven in the oven but it was fine. My wife loved it. For the dark beer I used a very nice Mendocino stout which made the sauce somewhat bitter, so I had to adjust it with a bit of brown sugar. I suggest that others use a milder dark beer.

I definitely would make it again. My husband loved it and the gravy is luscious. Not a quickie dinner. Takes some preparation and a long cook time. Worth the trouble

This was a very tender beef pot roast. The only change I made was that I didn't use mushrooms but instead I added some cut up potato. The roast was very moist and the liquid made an excellent gravy. I will make this again.

I made this last night with a "London Broil" roast, so it was small for 2 people.  And very lean.  I should have cut down on the salty broth some more.  It was very good, the meat was TOO lean almost NO fat, so flavor was wanting there.  The rest of the ingredients were awesome, even tho I forgot to add tomato paste and thyme.  duh.  And used garlic powder.  Also used rosemary and bay leaf and IPA beer.  "Indian Pale Ale" so it was not a strong beer flavor.  I like mine with dark red wine most of the time.  This was fun to try something different.  I cooked it on 325 degrees half the time.  Maybe over cooked it since it was so small.  Hence  not as tender as would have liked.  Will surely try again and make proper changes.  Oh, did not use flour, but instead after cooking thickened the broth and juices with a bit of corn starch instead.  I will use the leftover bit of meat and gravy today to make a nice beef barley soup with fresh veggies.  YUM.

This came out great, but I modified it. I didn't have dark beer,(I only like Belgium White), so I used two cups of Merlot Wine instead.

Also, I made a roux with the flour,  2tbs flour and 2tbs butter. 

It was a hit!

This was fantastic, and it will be made again and again.  I did make some adjustments based on what I had and other suggestions.  I left out the potatoes and made mashed potatoes to serve with instead.  I also seasoned the meat with salt and pepper before browning.  I used two beef bouillon cubes in water, substituted some garlic chile mustard that needed used, used about 1 tsp of ground thyme, added the flour after I added the liquid (that one was a total oops), and used a porter for my beer.  Cooked as directed, then removed the meat and vegetables and cooked down the liquid into a lovely sauce on the stove which I poured over the mashed potatoes, meat, and veggies.  OHMIGOD this was good.

This was the first pot roast I ever made and it was AMAZING! I liberally salted and peppered the roast before searing, and then made a gravy from the juice/sauce after it was done. No extra seasoning needed! A 4.3 pound roast was cooked perfectly in 2.5 hours in the oven. My boyfriend liked it so much he thought he could handle seconds ;)

It hasn't finished cooking yet but looks yummy; however, whoever decided it takes 20 minutes prep on this recipe works lots faster than me.  It took me 45 minutes to chop, measure, brown, add, etc.  I also substituted wine for beer as I'm not a beer lover.

AFor a different taste try using hard cider instead of beer which can sometimes be a little bitter.

Excellent and easy recipe.   I did add in some celery and I subbed in a little ketchup for the tomato paste out of necessity.   It still gave me the subtleness that the paste offers, so I was pleased with that.   I did not have a dark beer, so I used just a standard light beer, which worked fine.   I only had a 2 pound roast and after 2 hours, this was done perfectly.   I let rest for 15 minutes and sliced up and it was fork tender and the veggies perfect.   I will use this recipe again.  Thanks!

I make this recipe with a Bottle of Founders Breakfast Stout. The stout is brewed with "flaked oats, bitter and sweetened imported chocolates, Sumatra and Kona coffee" and it adds a complexity and richness that has astounded those who I have made it for.

Great recipe. Didn't change a thing.
