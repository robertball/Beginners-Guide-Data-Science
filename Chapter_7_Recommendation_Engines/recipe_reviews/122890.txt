Very good and easy to make. Smells wonderful when it is cooking and tastes even better. I made both loaves and froze them. Pulled one out tonight and defrosted on the counter. Works perfectly!! FYI: there is not a fresh baked bread alive that will not get stale a WEEK after being baked.

I followed this recipe and the bread turned out great fresh out of the oven! However, given the bread didn't have preservatives (like I'm used to) after a week it started to get stale. Good bread for soups dipping or sandwichs.

Very Yummy!! Next time I am going to use 2 packets of onion soup mix to give it a more oniony flavor. I was wondering, can this be frozen after it is baked?

Great Bread, followed recipe minus no onion soup in the house so used 1 Tbs of Onion Powder and 2 Tbs of dried onion flakes. Came out great, great color, texture, and crust. Added a little butter on and everyone loved it! This recipe Rocks, :)

I halved this recipe except for the onion soup mix and it turned out to be very, very good, it tasted kinda like a really good onion bagel. Next time I won't half the recipe but maybe double it. Yumm! Thanks for a great recipe!

I only made 1/2 the recipe and needed to make a few changes to accomodate what I had on hand.  I replaced 1/4 cup of water with milk instead of using the powdered and I made my own onion soup mix (recipe from another site.)  The dough was a bit sticky to work with but made a nice loaf, with a good crumb.  We really enjoyed the leftover bread as a base for fried egg sandwiches today at lunch.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This was fabulous! The onion french bread was full of flavour and was just so great. We used Lipton Onion Soup and the taste was great. I would strongly suggest pairing this with the Real Welsh Rarebit, for a great snack. Bon Appetit!
