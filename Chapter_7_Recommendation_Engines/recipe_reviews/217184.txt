I pretty much followed the recipe and found it to be quite delicious.  The only changes were the addition of salt (curiously missing from the recipe) and garlic/hot sauce substitute because I didn't have Thai garlic chile paste.  The mixture before the addition of the noodles was quite soupy but it thickened beautifully with them.  Because the dish is so rich, a side of broccoli or a nice tossed salad would go nicely too.  I will definitely make this one again!  Thanks rhapsody!

I love thai food and this recipe blends my childhood favourite with a little thai twist. I changed things a bit by adding 2 cups of chicken stock and 1 cup of water and also added lemon grass and cilantro to the broth. And I would only cook it for 3 hours and add the noodles at the last 5- 10 minutes as my noodles were a little over done for my liking. All and all an amazing, hardy thai soup.

My whole family from my picky 6 year old to my husband who considers himself a food snob all loved it. The only change i made was to use rice instead of ramen noodles and added mushrooms....Delicious!!!!

I cut the chicken and noodles in half, but upped the peanut butter and thai chili paste to taste. I didn't use the seasoning packet from the ramen noodles at all and used one can of chicken stock and one can of water. I may use two cans of chicken stock next time to get more juice. This was wonderful and will be a staple in my house

I do not add the seasoning packet because it has a lot of sodium and calories so I just added salt as the replacement

Really easy to make for a night when you know you won't be home to cook.  I threw all the ingredients in (I used frozen chicken thighs) and let cook on low for about 6 hours.  When I got home, I added the ramen noodles for about 10 minutes and served immediately after.  It's very hearty, great with a salad (and all the toppings of course).  Wonderful with sriracha sauce added for some kick.  My whole family loved it (the kids without the sriracha).  I'm adding it to my monthly rotation.

The flavor of this recipe was good.  The only modification that I made was to add 1 jalapeno pepper in place of 1 green pepper. I only regret was that I had not read the reviews prior to making this dish.  The ramen noodles only needed 5-10 minutes to cook.  Any longer and the noodles overcook (as mine did). So thank goodness the flavor was there as the consistency was a bit starchy.

Followed this recipe exactly. Not good at all. Total waste of time and money.

I cooked this on stovetop by bringing coconut milk and peanut butter to a low boil then added noodles. i sauteed garlic, ginger, onions and peppers in a second pan, removed pepper mixture and browned the chicken. then added the peppers and chicken to noodle mixture. Made a quick lunch.  A little too much peanut butter for me but my daughter wanted to add more

Have to say this was bland and had a grainy texture.
