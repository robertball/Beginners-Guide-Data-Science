Very quick and delicious pie recipe.  The only thing I did different was I drained the pineapple and mixed the juice with the pudding until the pudding was well mixed, then added the sour cream until blended.  I then added the pineapple.  I let set up an hour before cutting.   Will be making this one again.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I used a whole pineapple instead of canned and I made a pie crust made of graham cracker crumbs and finely chopped walnuts mixed w/ butter. I also used sugar free pudding. Everyone liked it. Thanks!

Made this for my mother and she loved it. Not an easy feat because she is very picky. I will make this again.

It was just okay.  I tried to add some cherries for color & a little coconut for texture.  It helped but not something I would make often.

This had a good taste....but was disappointed that it didnt set very good.  Im sure it was something I did...  I will surely make again though... and probably mix it a little longer...
