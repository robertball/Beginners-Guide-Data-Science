I was looking for a custard sauce like the ones I had in the pubs of London, and this fits the bill! I like that it's pourable and not too sweet, as well as easy to make. I thought that it needed 2 Tbsp. of cornstarch; I thought it was too thin with only one. This is a keeper!

Fantastic. I'm Swedish, and we usually serve apple pie with vanilla sauce rather than ice cream. You can find boxed vanilla sauce easily in Sweden at the supermarket, but not in the US. I've been looking for a recipe, and this is it. 

It is wonderful cold and poured over any kind of pie, berries, bread pudding, or even brownies, and any warm, sweet dessert. Thanks to the recipe submitter for adding very valuable and specific notes --- I wish everyone did that.

Didn’t have any whole milk on hand, so I used a combination of  skim milk and fat-free half-and-half.  I did add a bit more cornstarch as I wanted it more like a light cream rather than a runny sauce, but keep in mind that it will thicken somewhat as it chills.  This had no lumps, was very smooth and creamy, so I didn’t feel the necessity to pour it through a sieve. Today, just spooned it over some fresh strawberries, and it was simply divine!  Thanks, Northstar, this is a nice alternative to whipped cream, and it really does add a touch of elegance to sliced fresh fruit served in a martini glass!

I tried this because others said it tasted like the custard they'd had in England. I agree! And might even say better because I used half of a vanilla bean instead of extract.  I also added a pat of butter at the end. I served it with warm apple cobbler.  Then guiltily ate the leftover from the carton the next day!  Can't wait to make it again!

Definite hit as a vanilla flavored sauce. The second time I made it I made a lemon flavored version. I substituted pure lemon extract for the vanilla and added 1 tablespoon of lemon zest to the milk as it was heated. The zest was strained out of the final sauce. Great over pound cake and blueberries!

This is a very easy sauce to make and would work well with any dessert.  I tempered the egg mixture before adding it back into the pan to thicken.

Very good! Made exactly as written and my family loved it.  You do need to strain it to get all the chunks out but it was creamy, simple and delicious!

The next time I make this I will definitely use more cornstarch, 2Tbsp. was not enough to suit me, it was too thin. I will also amp up the flavor with extra vanilla.

It's a nice start however... although I followed the suggestion of 2 Tbls of cornstarch, the final result was still too liquid for my liking.  I also found it to be rather bland.  If I made this again, I'd add more sugar & more vanilla.  Perhaps it's my sweet tooth.

Followed this recipe exactly,  except added 2 Tbsp of corn starch, as others had suggested, but I didn't have the same taste experience as others.  The sauce was quite bland, even after adding additional vanilla.  In retrospect, I should of added some additional sugar and approximately 1 tbsp of vanilla, but that's to my "sweet tooth" liking.  If you like a light sauce with a small hint of vanilla and sweetness, then this recipe is for you..

I made this sauce to put on bread pudding.  I made the bread pudding with canned peaches in light syrup instead of raisins.  I saved the syrup and added it to the vanilla cream sauce.  It was delicious!  Next time I will add a little more corn starch as suggested.

Good recipe. The notes on how to alter the recipe to an individual's taste are very helpful too. I added a pinch of salt to the recipe and finished the sauce with a pat of butter at the end. Served hot and garnished with wild blueberries.
