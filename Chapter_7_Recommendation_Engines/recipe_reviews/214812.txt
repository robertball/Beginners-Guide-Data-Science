This was an easy Christmas morning breakfast that Ill probably have year round.   My only substitution was to use pop open refrigerated cinnamon buns (without the icing).  You have to smash down the sandwich real good before putting in egg and milk mixture.   OH.......if youre looking for Brie at WalMart, try the deli section where the cheeseballs and Bonnie Bell cheeses are. This was very tasty indeed.

This was indeed an ultimate sandwich. I use cinnamon-sugar crullers sliced horizontally in half as my "bread". I let it soak a few minutes in the egg mixture and fried those up alone (french-toast style) before topping with the rest of the ingredients, then I just waited for the cheeses to melt. Those were indeed some long minutes to wait. I hesitated even adding the cheddar, but I did and it is necessary! This is sweet, salty, creamy, yumminess. Certainly not an every day breakfast but it was a treat!

This wasn't as good as I thought it might be, won't make again.
