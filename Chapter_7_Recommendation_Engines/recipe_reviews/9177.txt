Excellent taste and very easy to make!  I was a little worried because they did get a little hard around the edges and it overflowed into my oven when I baked them...but I read in previous reviews that it had happened to other people so that was a relief!  I baked them then let them cool, then covered them and cut them the next day.  They were so great! Rave reviews from everyone at my party! When you're pouring the filling over the crust, it looks like it will be too much, but it works just great!  Will use a disposable pan next time because of the overflow.  GREAT RECIPE!!!

So, so good. I use all butter, as I refuse to cook with, bake with, or even eat the disgusting concoction known as margarine. I've made this twice already, and it is so good. I'm a southern girl, so I love me some pecan pie, and this is just sinfully good. I use 2 1/2 cups pecan halves, and I don't bother to chop them. I bake this in a 13x9 and reduce the temp just a little to 325. Also, I don't cook the crust quite as long (15 min), and also, the second round of bake time needs to be increased significantly. It is NOT done after just 25 minutes!

These are excellent - this is the third year I've made these for our annual choir party potluck, and people were WAITING for them.  A couple of things...

I made 1/2 recipe which fit very nicely into my 8 x 11 pyrex pan.  Made 24 nice large bars.  I cooked for about 33-35 minutes unstead of 20 and allowed them to set up and cool before cutting - they were not at all runny.  If making the recipe as called for in the large pan I'd do 40 minutes.  Also, I found that putting each bar on a  small cupcake liner paper was very nice for serving them as they can be crumbly.

I'm baking this recipe again this year for the holidays.  Thought I had rated it, but I hadn't.  It's wonderful!
I do bake it 15-20 minutes longer than stated and check it every five minutes.
Also, I use parchment paper on the bottom of the pan.

The amount of flour in this recipe should be 2 cups, not 3.  Several recipes I have for this type of recipe only call for 2 cups.  After incorporating that change the bars turned out delicious.

I have been making this recipe for years! Always a big hit anywhere I take them! I started lining my pan with foil and after they cool, slide it out of the pan onto the counter and use a pizza cutter to slice.

After reading reviews of these being too sweet and the dough not forming properly, I made some changes to the original recipe and they came out really good in the end.

I added a few drops of water to the crust ingredients, which allowed it to form a dough. 

For the filling I also used 2/3 cup light corn syrup, a little less than one cup of brown sugar, and an ounce of unsweetened chocolate. Since I didn't have all of the pecans on hand, I used a mixture of walnuts and almonds along with the pecans. The pan size requested in the recipe should have been slightly bigger, as there was a small amount of crust and filling that remained, which I ended up throwing away.

OUTSTANDING!  I've had distrous results while trying to bake a pecan pie, but these turned out to be incredible!  Didn't have all the corn syrup I needed, so substituted honey and maple syrup to make up the additional 3/4 cup and that substitute didn't seem to do anything to the recipe, but perhaps make it more flavorful.  The crust on these are to die for...buttery and sinful.  I actually cooked the end product about 12 - 15 more and that didn't seem to do any damage either (I was paranoid about it "setting" due to my past pecan pie disasters!), though it did make the crust on the rim a little more chewy and crunchy (caramelized it a bit more--I actually liked that part better...).  All in all, a definite winner.  One of the best dessert recipes I've used from allrecipes.....yum!

After reading the reviews, and doing a bit of experimenting, I think I have the final "tweaks" to make this the perfect recipe. Begin by using a bigger pan!  The half sheet cake pan with sides is the perfect size...about 13" x 17" x 1 1/4"...no run over!  You do have to press down the crust before baking, but there seem to be just the rightr amount of crust for us. I traded out some of the white sugar for brown.  1 cup white sugar plus 1/2 cup dark sugar seems to work well. And one last change, the cooking time.  It is way off.  I did mine for 45 minutes.  It was just starting to bubble around the edges when I took it out, this was also the time it started to brown up a bit. I was worried about how much this recipe yielded, and if it would freeze well.  I never got a chance to find out it went so quick!  None of the problems of pecan pie, and a protable size.  I think this is going to be added to my Thanksgiving menu to cut and send home to sweeten up the leftovers! Excellent recipe - Thanks Marietta for sharing!

These were wonderful!  Next time I'm going to use brown sugar for white, and cut back a little on the Karyo... the bars ooozed long after cooling and cutting.  Messy and totally worth the calories!

These are wonderful!  I lined the pan with parchment paper, but think the suggestion to line with foil and use a pizza cutter to slice sounds much better. To prevent them getting hard around the edges and undercooked in the middle, I altered the baking instructions:  Toast the pecans for 5-8 minutes in the oven before baking the crust. Mix the crust as directed and place in oven.  While the crust is cooking, melt 4 T butter (not 3 T margarine) in a heavy pan.  Stir in sugar and salt.  Mix together the beaten egg and corn syrup and stir into the hot sugar mixture.  Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture is hot but not thickened.  Stir in vanilla and pecans and pour immediately over hot crust.  Bake 15-20 minutes, until set in the middle.

I made these for Thanksgiving and they were gone the same day!  Very delicious, just like pecan pie.  However, I made it in a pan bigger than recommended and it still ran over in my oven.  Next time I'm going to use a bigger pan.  They're yummy!

Yummy Pecan Bars!  I wanted a thicker bar so I made in an 9" x 13" pan and allowed more baking time - just make sure the filling only jiggles slightly before removal from oven and allow to cool completely.  I used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar plus 1 T. of bourbon. If you love pecan pie, you would enjoy this. Thanks for sharing!

These are EXCELLENT!!! Made them for my SIL's family and they were a hit. Have made them a number of times since and everyone LOVES them. I use my large sided jelly roll pan and they come out very uniformly done. Smell delicious too! These are the best!

I made this last year and people liked it, but, for some reason, this year I made it for work and people are addicted to it.  I think I let it cook a little bit longer this year so it had a harder consistancy. I definitly recommend this recipe.  It's just like pecan pie but easier and less messy.

These were a big hit at Thanksgiving.  Everyone preferred these over a traditional pecan pie.  I used all butter.  The only thing is that these definitely took longer than 25 minutes for them to set with my oven.

Made w/ brown sugar instead of white sugar and cut the recipe in half (using an 8X8 pyrex dish). Also baked 35 minutes instead of what it called for. Oh YUM!

These were pretty good and were a quick fix for a pecan pie craving.  The problem was that so many reviewers said to keep them in the oven longer, so I did...and the outsides came out completely crunchy.  While you don't want it runny, you don't want to be eating toffee either...so my recommendation is to cook until bubbling and just starting to brown on top and around the edges.  I think it's better when it's a little gooey...that is, after all, how pecan pie is supposed to be.

I just made these bars and they are delicious!  I read the reviews especially about the crust might stick to pan.  I used the 15X10 glass dish, sprayed it with Pam before I pressed the cookie dough.  I raised the crust up on all sides and baked it.  I did reduce the syrup to one cup.  The bars baked for the full 30 minutes.  Let them cool and then cut them up.  Since the filling didn't go over the crust, none got stuck to the dish.  They lift off easily.  My husband loved these bars.  I am having to make another batch because we had friends come over and they really helped themselves to these delicious bars.  My rating of these bars- 5 Stars.

Awesome!  Im sure these are great as is but I used unsalted butter instead of margarine and added 1 cup mini chocolate chips. SOOOOO GOOD!  I bake cookies, cakes, and brownies all the time but finding the right timing for a pecan pie type filling is new to me.  I have over cooked these and under cooked them at times (still ate them both ways!) but usually just 4 or 5 minutes longer than called for is safe.

These are wonderful and turn out perfect every time. Anyone who comes within a foot of these bars demands the recipe. I do substitute turbinado sugar (demerara sugar or raw sugar) which adds a bit of cane flavor and is a little sweeter than white sugar. I use a bit less than what is called for but not much. It adds an extra hint of richness to the pecan flavor. Thank you for sharing!

I love these!! So delicious and pretty easy. I made a half batch as Soprano39 had done and that was the perfect amount. I did cook it longer too as many had commented about, and I'm glad I did - they weren't runny at all. I made this because my son in the air force requested them, and he & I are the only ones in the house that like pecan pie, so I was able to get most of these sent off to him leaving me with a few to enjoy too.  I'll definitely make these again!

THESE ARE AMAZING!! I made them for Thanksgiving and had so many requests to make them again I made them for Christmas -- this is definitely a new family favorite.  I followed the recipe exact with a few recommendations from others.  I only used 2 cups of flour, I baked it in a pampered chef baking stone (this helped because I didn't have any spills when it was baking) AND I used parchment paper. This is a must because any little bit that baked to the pan was stuck there pretty well.  These are almost as good as pecan pie, but much easier!

This is my 4th year making this and my family craves it!  I'm expected to bring it for both Thanksgiving and Christmas!  I decrease the flour to 2.5 cups,  mix my sugar half brown and half white,  and same with the Karo syrup (half dark,  half light), also increase cooking time on second round maybe 15 minutes.  Love it!

Great recipe! I made it as stated except I only had 1 cup of light corn syrup, so I used dark corn syrup for the other 1/2 cup. I looked through every pan I had, and I don't know how common a 10X15 inch pan is, but I didn't have one. I used a 11X17 inch cookie sheet and lined it with wax paper. It worked out great! It filled to the brim and had a couple drips in the oven bottom, but the end result looked fantastic! I'll definitely make this again, maybe trying 1/4 cup white and a 1/4 cup brown sugar next time.

Outstanding! Just like pecan pie in a cookie form! I made it exactly as stated (which I always do the first time I make a recipe).  I wouldn't change a thing.  I didn't have the jelly roll pan so I made the amount for a 9x13 pan and it worked out well.  My oven might be a little warm; I baked it for 50 minutes and I think next time (and there will be a next time) I'll bake a little less time.  Thank you for sharing this awesome recipe!!

Delicious!  Used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar and brown sugar in the crust as suggested by others.  I used a 10x15 jelly roll pan with baking paper and it didn't spill over or stick. I had a little less than 1.5 cups of corn syrup so that probably helped it not to spill over.  Would make again definitely but I don't think that it will stop me making pecan pies altogether!

I used the amounts in the recipie,  however, I did change it up a little. I toasted my pecans while I mixed the crust. I also lined my pan with aluminum foil.  While the crust baked (20 min), I mixed the filling ingredients in a pan and heated them just until they started to thicken then poured it over the crust and put it back in until it started to set (17 minutes in my oven). I pulled it out and let it cool for about 20 minutes. The foil allowed me to pull the whole thing off the pan and I pulled the edges away from the foil. I let it set about another 30 minutes and cut it with a pizza cutter. It is excellent and tastes just like a pecan pie!

I was first introduced to these bars at a cookie exchange. Since I love pecan pie these were a hit. A hint when ever making a crumbly crust and or sticky, gooey filling: I use nonstick aluminum foil. This is the best invention since post-it-notes. It causes the crust to come together. The gooey part releases after browning. The added bonus is lifting the whole thing out of the pan using the foil. It is so much easier to cut into bars and there is no damage to pan.

I made this yesterday for Thanksgiving dinner. I did make a couple of changes though. I used 1 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white sugar. I also used all butter, no margarine. The bars turned out really good. These need an extra 5 minutes to bake. I line my pan with Parchment paper and after letting them cool for a bit they will come out nicely.

The best ever! As other people stated, these did need to be baked for approx. 15-20 mins longer than suggested (for the final cook time). I simply set my timer for 10 more mins, then another 5, then another 5...checking the bars in between each time adjustment. My husband raved and basically ate 3/4 of a full batch! Saying, "don't make these again any time soon, or I'll eat the whole batch next time" :-) Good enough for me! (3 year old son's take? "too many nuts, Mommy")

These were a big hit! Second year I've made them for the holidays.  Everyone that tried them loved them (especially my husband who is already a big pecan pie fan).  I did adjust the recipe to 2 cups flour like others suggested.

I made these last night to serve as one of my desserts today and I'm thinking I may have to run make another batch. It's all I can do to keep my family out of them! I have one word about this recipe....DELICIOUS! and I didnt change a thing except used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar instead of the 1 1/2 sugar white sugar.

These are dynamite. Made these for Christmas and they were the first to be eaten.  I substituted 3/4 c. of canola oil for the butter and 3 Tbsp. canola oil for the 3 Tbsp. of melted margarine, and 1 c. Egg Beaters for the eggs, a much healthier option all around. The crust came out nice and flaky. I'll be making these for my daughters wedding.

I gave some of these to my neighbor and she came over the next day raving about them.  She said, "These are the best pecan pie I've ever had, and I'm 83 years old"!  They are delicious!!  I think I cooked them a little too long because they weren't very moist inside but still out of this world.

These were very good and easy to make.  I used a 9x13 pan and changed the recipe to 24 servings.  I did not have a problem with the bars sticking at all.  I love chocolate bourbon pecan pie, but wanted to have it in smaller portions.  I added 1/4 cup bourbon and 6 ounces (half bag) of semisweet chocolate chips to the filling mixture.  It turned out really good! This is a great easy recipe!

These delicious, gooey bars are even better than the best pecan pie!  The crust is delicious!  We used white sugar and white corn syrup for scrumptious results!

This was good, however it was a little too sweet the first time I made it. The second time I used  light brown sugar instead of white, I left out the vanilla, and I added a teaspoon of almond extract to the crust. It was much better the second time!

OMG - These are AWESOME!  The only thing I did differently was I used brown sugar instead of white  for the topping.  Be sure to use a large "jelly roll" pan and you will have no problems with it baking over.  The bake time was perfect.  As another reviewer stated, I have never made a successful pecan pie, not for lack of trying.  This is my new go-to recipe when I am craving pecan pie!  I can't stay out of them!

The only changes I made was the halve the recipe and I used a 9x13 since I didn't have a jelly roll pan and I lightly dusted it with a bit of powder sugar to make it pretty. Some tips. Use real butter for the filling part, this is one recipe that the flavor depends on it, grease the pan well, and while the pan is still warm loosen the filling from the edge of the pan, I waited 10 minutes, but the thickness of the filling will dictate this, and then you will not have an issue with sticking. Finally, these are rich so don't make the pieces too big when you cut them.

This is great.   I used 5 eggs.   Used 1/2 brown sugar in filling.  Baked at 340 degrees in convection oven.  Then refrigerated before cutting.  Its disapearing.

I made these for Thanksgiving rather than a  traditional pecan pie. Everyone raved and said they liked it better than pie. The only thing I'll do differently when I make them this week for Christmas is cook the base a little less, maybe 15 minutes, as it was a little darker than I liked, and slightly dry. It could just be my oven. These were also much better the next few days after baking when the filling had time to seep into the crust. Delicious! UPDATE 2019: I added a 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon to the base. It wasn't a strong flavor, just gave it a little extra hint of flavor.

These were soooo good!  Made them for Thanksgiving and they were really well received by our guests.  Made exactly as stated only I made in an 11x9 pan since that's what I had.  I thought this size pan made them the perfect thickness.

Liked this but I must not have let it cook long enough because it was still very runny in the middle. Threw it back in the oven for another 15 and it came out better. I think i'll cut the flour down next time and definitely let it cook longer next time. It was very tasty though. My husband and the kids loved it!!

I love nuts and chocolate so I sprinkle dark chocolate chips on top as soon as they come out of the oven.  Leave them whole to sit on top and melt into the pecans, or once they start to soften, swirl the chocolate around with a knife.  YUM

These bars are AMAZING!  The recipe was so easy and took very little prep time.  I used a 9x13 pan instead and baked the ingredients for about 5 minutes more than the recommended amount just to make the pecans nice and roasted on the top.  I also put a dash of almond in the crust just for a little extra flavor.  These will be going in my recipe box for sure!!

Very good! We made for home because we wanted 2 desserts for our Thanksgiving, but ended up sending the leftovers to wirk with my fiancee. We could have eaten the whole pan at home but it was a little much for the 3 of us.

My family liked these but I found them a little runny and sticky the next day. It was like the topping ingredients started separating while it sat over night.

Something is definitely off with this recipe. I followed it to the T and it tasted strange. One tip - the pecans should definitely be coated with honey or another sweet coating.

These came out perfect with lots of positive feedback. I didn't have a problem with the crust as others have noted.  If it was too thick or crumbly your pan may be too small &/or you did not pack the crust down enough before adding the filling. I cooked mine longer- but that was the only change I made!

This recipe is delicious! I do use a larger pan because I like the crust a little thinner.  When I take this anywhere friends ask me for the recipe!  Thanks, Marietta!

These are awesome....def even BETTER with age.  The pecan juices soak through the crust in about 2 days and they are to die for.  I used butter (as opposed to margerine).  Thanks for posting!

Made it exactly like the recipe except for less sugar, half of it brown, in the body of the recipe.  Used parchment paper and a 15 x 10 pan.  Did not run over and set-up just right.  Crust with 3 cups of flour melts in your mouth.

Outstanding recipe.  Everyone loved them.  I made a pecan pie after making these bars and I won't be making the pie again.  This recipe is a keeper.  The only change for next time is reducing the crust by 25%.  Thanks for the great recipe!

The crust was very dry but that may have worked out once the filling was placed in it and cooked except that the filling did not bake up well and remained too runny to eat.  The top firmed up nicely but underneath that was a very thick liquid that had no shape.  I even extended the cooking time a second time by another 15 minutes to see if that would help but it did not and, of course, the crust was overcooked as a result.

Nice alternative to the traditional pie.  I only had 1/2 a cup of corn syrup so I made up the rest with Lyle's Golden Syrup.  It made my filling a little dark but didn't effect the taste. Mine did get a little hard around the edges..but it could be that my oven temp is a little off.  Very much enjoyed this recipe Marietta.

These bring back memories.  Years ago while living in N.C. we used to get something called "Pecan Short Bars" at a grocery store bakery.  They were so yummy and have never seen them since.  These taste just like them....so yummy!! Thanks for sharing.

I love this dessert so much! I followed another reviewer's suggestion and used only 2 cups of flour instead of 3 and the crust came out great. I split the batter into 2 9"x11" foil pans, added more pecans, and baked for an additional 10 min. I'll be sure to be making this again for Christmas.

These are crazy delicious! It was extremely hard for my husband and I to not gobble them up! Contemplating making more this week just we can have them all to ourselves! As far as making the bars go I halved recipe doing half of the pecans, and the crust mixture (adding a 1/2 tsp of cinnamon AMAZING!), but made 3/4 of the filling, and baked in a 9x13 glass dish. They came out perfectly and I will be making these over and over forever!

This is a quick and easy recipe.  I substiuted splenda for the sugar and added some extra vanilla  .I also added an extra cup of pecans and used a 9x13 pan.  They were a little thicker and had more of a pecan pie filling layer.  I cooked them for about 5 mins extra.  They were delicious.

Absolutely delicious! I used 2 cups of flour instead of 3, but that is the only change I made. I have never had much luck making pecan pie, but this turned out perfectly.

AMAZING!  I just made these for Thanksgiving and they are great!  I cut the recipe in half, used a 13x9 glass baking dish, and kept the temperature and baking time the same.  I also used only butter and used half white sugar and half light brown sugar for the pecan topping.  Already cut them up for the holiday, but left the crispy edges for snacking before!

These were just OK for us.  Nothing spectacular.  I don't know that I would make again, but if I did, I probably wouldn't make any deeper than the depth of a cookie sheet.

I would not make these again. They took forever too cook, much longer than the recipe stated for the filling. The filling never set up and the crust was overcooked and tasted burned. It was an expensive recipe to not be able to eat.

Rave reviews at the annual cookie party this year!  I followed some of the advice posted and toasted the pecans before making them.  I'm not a big fan of nuts, but my husband loved them!  I would definitely make these again!

I really liked the flavor of these - they really do taste just like pecan pie! The only thing I would do differently is to lessen the crust a bit. I prefer a thinner crust.

I didn't use jelly roll pan mine were too large so put in a 13x9.  A bit more crust than I would like and rather crumbly.  Filling is quite tasty will try and get proper pan next time.

I made this for my companies thanksgiving feast and everyone just loved it. They all thought that I had bought at the store. They couldn't believe that I had made this. I made it exactly like it said to do and it came out perfect. I made it the night before and put it the refrigator over night to let it set more. But over all the people at my job raved about how good it was. I would definitely try this recipe out.

Absolutely divine! I cut the recipe in half and bake in a 9 x 9 or 8 x 10 dish for about 30-35 mns, until center no longer 'jiggles'.

I used a 9x13 pan and that seemed to be perfect for me. Nice thin bars with no mess, and they were really quick and easy to throw together :)

Awesome recipe!  I've made them several times for student group things to rave reviews!  Per suggestions, I add 1 tsp almond extract to the crust and mix dark and light corn syrup.  Have sometimes substituted walnuts (cheaper)...someone who doesn't like walnuts even loved them!  I also just sent the link to a friend who's now making them for Thanksgiving.  Thanks!

WOW!  These are really good!  I used dark corn syrup because that is all that I.  I made half the recipe and cooked the bars for 35 minutes and they were not runny at all.  Great recipe, I will be making these again!

Mmm.  I love pecan pie and it doesn't get any closer to the original unless you go to the effort of making pie crust.  I really enjoyed how simple, quick, and tasty these bar cookies were.  I did not find it at all runny.  You just need to make sure it is set before removing it from the oven.  I halfed the recipe both times I have made this and it has turned out great.  They are less crumbly the next day.

They tasted good but did not firm up the way other Pecan Pie bars have that I have made in the past.  They were way too soft even after I tried overcooking them and freezing them to firm them up.  I ended up having to throw half away sadly because they were just not done well.  I have other recipes I like much better for this dessert.

Got rave reviews from this recipe; my wife absolutely loved it.  To me, however, the crust was a little too thick, particularly around the edge of the pan.  I realize that's my fault, however, so I'm going to cut back slightly next time I make it.

I changed these slightly to resemble my pecan pie recipe by substituting Dark corn syrup for light and using part brown sugar. They were fabulous! I took them to a huge Tailgate party and they were tremendous hit! just right dessert for a Tailgate function! thanks for a decent base crust recipe!

They are quite sticky...do not attempt to cut them until they are completely cool.

I will save this recipes for future use.

Awesome, I was concerned about how the recipe would work in such a shallow pan but it was fine. I halved the recipe and put baked it in a disposable "toaster over" pan fit perfectly, no overflow.  Everyone loved them!!

Four stars only because of the light corn syrup, I try to stay away from it.  It was an indulgence!

So good! Easy to make and delicious. Tastes just like pecan pie. I like that the crust is made  with butter. It tastes like a shortbread crust. I’ll probably add a bit more pecans next time. I like my pecan pie loaded with pecans. Mmmmm

This is fabulous.  Someone asks for the recipe every time I take these somewhere.
I butter the pan, line with parchment paper, and butter the parchment paper, make sure the sides come up over the edge of the pan.  I make the crust in my food processor.  The finished bars usually bake for 35 minutes after adding the filling.

Yummy crust tasted like Walker shortbread cookies.
Replaced the vanilla with 43 liquor .
Will make this instead of pecan pie.

I made it according to recipe but turned out Soupy. Even after cooking a second time for another 15 minutes equaling a total of 45 minutes. Too much flour for crust as one review said as well as too much Karo syrup. Really frustrated that I used all those ingredients and had to pitch it out.

This was an excellent dessert. Definitely one I will make again. Took it to a potluck dinner at church and came back with an empty pan. So easy to make. The only change I made was making my own brown sugar (because I thought I had some but didn’t. ) using white sugar and molasses. Other than that, everything was the same! Wonderful!

Very very good bar recipe. I like it better than a traditional pecan pie which I find too sweet and rich to eat a whole piece. 
I read some reviews before baking and made some changes. Some reviewers baked as is and some reduced the flour to 2 cups. Well, I reduced to 2 1/2 cups and the crust is delicious and tender. In the filling I used 1 cup of sugar and 1/2 cup brown suger. I used a disposable foil pan sprayed with nonstick spray and they came out easily. 
In my pan it ended up being about 50/50 crust to filling which I think is absolutely perfect to keep it from being to rich and gooey. Some other reviewers also noted the edges cooking too much before the middle and having to extend cooking time. I did extend the cooking time by about 20 minutes and my edges are definately more cooked and firm (one person described it as toffee-like which is an excellent description). I love the edges and think the soft middle with a chewier and caramel-like edge is very yummy. I will make these again for Thanksgiving!

Made these for office luncheon, everyone raved and wanted seconds. Cookie bottom has buttery flavor. Pecan topping was a little soft and runny and cookies were sticky by second day but the taste deserves 5 stars.

I made this with a gluten free all purpose flour mix  (Bob's Red Mill) and it was delicious!  I didn't modify anything else.  The whole family raved!

People really liked this. I found the base too crumbly, would adjust. Also thought it could have more topping.  I'd make it again with adjustments.  I did use more nuts and toasted them lightly beforehand.

I made these bars for Thanksgiving in place of pecan pie.  Everyone loved them. I was worried because I didn't have the correct size pan, so I just eye-balled the thickness of the crust and filling for a 9x13 pan, and threw out the excess. I don't think you can go wrong with this recipe.

Definitely a favorite at our Thanksgiving feast! I substituted unsalted butter for the margarine, for a richer flavor.  I also lined the pan with heavy weight foil for easy removal. Cut into bite-size pieces and watch them disappear !

I have made this at least 30x and I've only ever had one person complain about it and I think that person didn't like me more than he didn't like the bars :) The only thing I change is i sub half the white sugar for brown sugar (gives it more of a caramel taste) But just as it is it's still a 5 star recipe. 
Side Note: My family and I like it when we substitute the butter in the crust for coconut oil Yummy! it's worth a try!!!

I have tried several of the (maple) pecan bar recipes listed and this one is excellent. Easy and quick to make - try using 1/2 cup maple syrup and 1 cup golden syrup plus grating of salt to taste..far better flavor.  Melt the butter, sugar & syrups on stove top until blended. beat eggs separately and mix into the batter when cool - do not let the eggs clump. spread enough nuts to evenly cover the crust, then pour cooled batter over it before baking - it will not be runny or overflow.  Bake at 325F so top do not burn. Line with baking paper, less messy, easier to remove. instead of pressing, use rolling pin to flatten dough evenly into the baking pan - children sized roller fits.

This is a great recipe.  I have a different recipe for Pecan Pie bars that I have used over the years but this one baked up better and came out of the pan so much easier.  Will definitely replace my old recipe with this one.  A wonderful taste of pecan pie without the large piece!

This is so amazing! For the crust I made a batch and a half because it wasn't covering the whole pan. However, maybe because of this I didn't have the overflow that everyone else has mentioned. The only problem with the recipe is that I'm having issues letting it fully set before I nibble on it!

These are sooo good and easy to make. I love pecan pie and I had a craving but didn't want to have to deal with making crust... I found this and it is AMAZING!! Must try recipe mmm.. One more thing, I did'nt have Kayro syrup so I substituted it with maple syrup , it also did NOT over flow yay (others said it did but it didn't) It didn't cook right away but I kept adding time until it was set, (about 35 minutes)

These tasted just like pecan pie. Probably because they have the same ingriedients just spread out in a bigger pan. We all liked them, but we all like pecan pie to.

I made my bars exactly to the recipe and even baked for a couple extra minutes, but for some reason it didn't set correctly. The hard thing about this recipe was unlike a cake, you can't stick a knife in it to see if it was done, so when mine cooled, it was still very watery.  I scooped out some of the extra filling and had a piece and it was ok. Just would have been better if it held up instead of being so watery.

My husband loves pecan pie, and I thought this "portable" version would be a nifty idea.  I halved the ingredients and baked in a 9x13 pan.  They were quite caramely around 2 edges of the pan, but I just cut that portion away. (didn't want to lose a tooth! (-;)  My husband and I thought they really did taste like pecan pie.  They were rich, buttery, and loaded with nuts!  Will definitely make these again.

These bars are wonderful. I needed to add a bit of ice water to my crust as it was too crumbly for me to handle without it. I used the recommended size pan, which i lined with parchment paper for easy lift out and cutting. Will definately make again.

My co-worker (with little baking experience)made this recipe for a work contest. He brought it in right out of the oven. It was still warm and had to be eaten with a fork. He won FIRST place. They were even great the next day.

These were good in their own right, but not really what I had wanted. I was looking for a recipe similar to one that a girlfriend had made for a dinner party at her house. These ended up being quite different. I later found out that her recipe does not have corn syrup in it. But anyway, like I said, very tasty in a different way then what I was expecting.

This turned out wonderfully. There was a comment about it being runny but I did not experience that at all. They were a little mushy until they finished cooling completely but that was to be expected. Once they were cooled, they were easy to slice. 

They were slightly too sweet for my taste but everyone else thought they were perfect. Many rave reviews from the recipe guinea pigs!

Everyone loved these. However, the crust was powder when I put it in the jelly roll pan. I remembered from making these before that they stuck terribly. This year I greased the pan, layer down parchment and greased again. Worked great. Next time I’ll change the proportions of the recipe. Maybe increase the butter by a third in the crust. The filling was delicious, but I might double the filling to make it more gooey. Or at least increase it by half. Lastly, I think I over baked it. It was really crunchy on the edges, but wonderfully chewy in the middle. All in all a winner!

This recipe is better than any pecan pie I have ever had!!! A definate do-over recipe. I didn't use as many chopped pecans as it called for, but it was still delicious. My family ate it up.

Excellent taste.  Could use some help on the crust, though.

What a hit!! I'm lucky if they last 2 days. I have been requested to make them for my Christmas Party!  Sprinkling chopped red and green m&m's on top half way through cooking time for that holiday kick is a great little trick!!
