I'm pretty picky about chocolate fondue because it seems like most of them have such an intense flavor that it covers the flavor of the fruit you dip in it.  This one, however, complimented the flavor of the fruit PERFECTLY and had a great chocolate flavor on it's own, too.  I thought the consistency was perfect.  We dipped pound cake, bananas, marshmallows, strawberries, clementine oranges, cinnamon graham crackers and pineapple in it (my favorites were the strawberries and pineapple).  I will definitely make it again, it was so much fun, so easy and so good!

This is a really good chocolate fondue recipe!  It is so thick and creamy!  I did add extra chocolate chips to make it more chocolately, then I added just a little bit more water.  It is absolutely delicious!

Very easy to prepare and VERY good.  It isn't super rich and has the perfect texture and consistency for fondue!  Love it!  You must try!

This was great. I served it at a teen party and the girls loved it. My take on the recipe: I used 1 cup milk chocolate chips and 2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips. I took 6 oz. of white chocolate (not vanilla chips) and melted it with maybe a teaspoon of shortening (not butter; butter contains water). I swirled the white chocolate in to make the fondue pretty. My dippers: strawberries, fresh pineapple, grapes, apples (soaked in lime juice and dried), and angel food cake.

Can't say I would give this to my family every day, as it's very rich (the description suggests "for after school snacks"!)... but My oh my! It's YUMMY! A bit too thick, I had to thin it down with milk too, next time I will cook it for less time (I think I was waiting for it to boil, and cooked it for more than 5 minutes... I'm glad it never boiled as the other recipe I tried, I burnt!). I will definitely make this again, for a special occasion!

This chocolate fondue was fantastic.  Just be sure to watch it and stir it all the time.  My first batch was a bust but the second time was very good.  We usually just melt chocolate bars but I decided to try this and I'm so glad I did.

I added an extra half-cup of chocolate chips for a thicker consistency, and a more chocolate-y flavor.  This is super easy and yummy!

Very easy and tasty. Especially when made with high quality Giardelli chips. I made this recipe and another from another site "chocolate raspberry fondue" for a party of 25. This fondue pot was empty at the end - the other one was practically untouched.

I was worried this would be too sweet, but it wasn't. I dumped the exact ingredients in my fondue pot, turned it to a low setting (2/10), and stirred often. It was delicious!  The consistency was very smooth. We dipped pound cake, large marshmallows, rice krispy treats, bananas, and strawberries. It held well on the various foods with a nice, even coating after a slow spin of the fondue fork. It's also delicious drizzled on sliced pears and on ice cream.  It easily makes enough for 5 people to enjoy with leftovers for at least 2-3 more times (at 5 servings each time).

I made this for a party along with the Ghiradelli Ultimate Fondue on this site.  I used 1/2 bittersweet Ghiradelli chocolate chips and 1/2 milk chocolate Ghiradelli chocolate chips and I added 2 tbl. of Godiva chocolate liqueur to both and 2 tbl. of Ameretto to this recipe and 2 tbl. of Chambord to the Ghiradelli recipe.  While they were both wonderful and there wasn't any left of either, after polling everyone which they like the best, this was the hands-down winner.  Incredible!

Excellent! I used baking chocolate instead of chips, and I added 2 extra Tbsp water because it was very thick.

This was SO easy & delicious! Made chocolate fondue for my daughters 6th birthday.
I used a Cuisinart electric, non-stick fondue set , so I only had to clean one pan & it was really easy.
I followed the recipe *almost* exactly, except we used a full 12oz bag of milk chocolate chips instead of semi sweet. Also followed another recommendation I read: I cut up a pineapple as one of the things to dip, but one cut, I let it sit in a strainer for 30 minutes to get rid of the extra juice.
Other items we dipped were, pretzels, potato chips, twix bars, and of course apples & strawberries. This was so easy & kids & adults both liked it. Will do it again for sure!

WOW. Super simple and so delicious. We don't have a fondue pot but wanted a fondue-type dip for fresh fruit. We thought this would be a good way to give our kids a really fun dessert after eating a meal that was a challenge to their picky palettes. This did not disappoint! So easy to make and absolutely delicious. It stayed dippable even after cooling completely, wasn't too thick or too runny and just the right amount of sweetness/bitterness to pair with fresh fruits. I know it sounds an unusual choice, but please do not miss dipping green apples in this yummy concoction! The strawberries were good too, but the green apples?! AMAZING! :)

Great fondue, I liked being able to use sweetened condensed milk instead of having to worry about heavy cream or half & half. It tastes great with fruit!

This was easy to prepare and delicious. I served it in a small crockpot made for hot dips, I wouldn't recommend this unless you have one with a very low setting or can monitor the heat some other way. Got a little overcooked in mine.

Yummy. I chose this fondue because it sounded like I could melt it ahead of time and then just reheat when it came time to serve - the consistency was a little off - I probably should have added a little milk or cream to loosen it up, because it was a bit thick, like warm frosting, but very tasty. Mini cream puffs are the favorite thing to dip in our house..

It was my first time making a chocolate fondue and it turned out too thick than I expected.  However, it tasted awesome and was a hit at the party.  I plan to use less condensed milk next time.

This has a great chocolate flavor and went well with the pound cake, strawberries and Twinkies. I may add a little more butter or water next time to thin it out a little.

I made this for Valentine's Day dessert and everybody loved it! Well, whats not to love about dipping yummy treats in to melted chocolate? But this recipe is more than just melted chocolate. My husband watched me make it and wasn't 100% sure it was going to be chocolatey enough but when he tasted it, he couldn't get over the flavor. It had a richer flavor,almost like a chocolate caramel. The kids loved it but that goes without saying. The next day we were thinking what else could we use the recipe for? I followed the recipe except I didn't have vanilla extract but I had a vanilla bean. DELCIOUS!

Not sure the butter is necessary...but then again, why not?  Watch it carefully; the sterno I used in my fondue set made it too hot and it scorched.

Made this fondue exactly as written for a get-together of our wine club, and it was perfect! Kept it warm in one section of our buffet crock pot, and it stayed at the right consistency the whole evening. We served with a variety of fruit (bananas, strawberries, pineapple), marshmallows, mini pretzel rods and small Rice Krispie Treat squares. It was a big hit!

Absolutely awesome. I used 6 oz. Dove dark chocolate because that's what I had on hand. It turned out wonderfully and was delicious with strawberries and angel food cake for Valentine's Day. It also makes a fabulous fudge sauce for ice cream sundaes!

So simple, yet so delicious.  Everyone that I have served this to really likes it.  Just watch out for burning the chocolate chips at first when they are melting.  Also, keep the heat on after everything is melted because otherwise the chocolate will start to get thicker! 
YUM! :)

Very yummy.  Have made as written in the past, but for Christmas I subbed a Tbsp of Kaluha for the vanilla flavoring.  I like it that way even better!

Super yummy!  I made this in my Little Dipper CrockPot, stirring every 15 minutes, for a little over an hour while I was doing party prep in the kitchen.  I omitted the vanilla, simply because the kids were already eating it before I added it in.  Once cooked, be sure to take the lid off to prevent the addition of extra water.  The crockpot holds its temp for quite awhile, so I just wound the cord up with a twist tie and put the crockpot directly on the table. Served it with apples, bananas, cookies, Rice Krispies treat cut into fourths, mini marshmallows, pretzels, graham crackers, 2 kinds of wafer cookies, and 2 other types of cookies.  So easy!  Definitely a keeper!

great base recipe. I will change up the extract depending on the event. Rum extract is really nice. I also use it as a base for smores dip. Put in the bottom of a medium baker with marshmallows on top. Broil till just brown and use graham wafers to dip. Really easy decadent mix and freezes well too.

This was the fabulous.  I used an extra half cup of chocolate chips because my family are chocolate fanatics and closer to 3Tbsp of butter.  The dip is nice and thick and sticks to fruit beautifully!

Perfect recipe! The consistency was dead on.  The flavor depends on the quality of chocolate you use.  I used Bakers Squares and it was okay.  I might splurge for a better chocolate next time especially after seeing how inexpensive a fondue dinner is to make.

I love how easy this is. With the exception of making sure you have the EAGLE Condensed Milk it's all easy ingredients and can be made on a moments notice. Great for those sleepover nights my daughter has. :)

DELICIOUS...and sooooo easy!  I was looking for a simple recipe to make for my kids (I didnt think they would like liquer flavorings or anything "fancy")...this was perfect!  I doubled the recipe and used Ghirardelli choc chips.  Will definitely make again.

This was really easy and tasted good. I think i was hoping for a more complex chocolate flavor so next time I might try a recipe that has a twist or has more depth. but this was delicious for sure and I could not stop eating it!!

This is another of our favorite fondue recipes...so GOOD! The last time I made this recipe, I substituted dark chocolate chips for the semi-sweet. Decadent, especially with strawberry pound cake, marshmallows and bananas.

Easy to make, and perfect texture.  Sticks to dippers easily.  The chocolate taste is rich, but not overpowering.  Complements other flavors very nicely.  Will definately use again.

Very smooth and very easy. I left out the vanilla and added cognac instead. It made for a more festive flavour.

This was really very good. We had it for a New Years Eve dessert. I served it with bananas, strawberries and pretzels. It was very tasty, I can't wait to put it over icecream!

SOOOO simple to make, and tasted great! I loved that it didn't get too thick or congeal when cool. We loved it with pineapple slices, marshmallows and pound cake.

This is an awesome recipe! I made it for a large group of friends to enjoy after our cheese fondue and everyone loved it. The canned milk makes it very creamy. I put everything in a crock pot as we sat down to dinner and it was ready when we were. Will definitely make again.

This was so easy and stress free, and came out perfectly! Had no issues with clumping or anything. Only word of caution is that it is INCREDIBLY sweet! Don't recommend dipping anything super sweet in here (we dipped a donut in, big mistake), but fruit and other things were perfect.

I did not like to consistency for dipping- fondue. Too thick  and gooey,  and did not stick well to the stuff  we were dipping , had to scoop and hold it on the fruit. Just slid off. It was more like a warm fudge and not a sauce. It’s chocoate, and the taste is very good, but need some suggestions on how to make this a sauce.

While this was delicious, it was entirely too thick (think the consistency of cold pudding even while hot)! I substituted milk for the water because I was honestly afraid of seizing up my chocolate, but next time I’d add even more to thin it out! Don’t forget the vanilla, it adds a whole other depth of flavor!

Very easy as written.  Also can be easily adapted - different types of chips or flavorings. We used ghiardelli semi sweet chips ( about 1 1/2 cups).  Did have to add a little milk as it got a little thick while we were dipping.  Used wafer cookies, angel food, strawberries, bananas and graham crackers.

Excellent recipe that melts to perfection and has great flavor. I added about a 1/4 cup of dark chocolate to the semi sweet for added richness, and melted everything in a fondue pot. We dipped in pretzels, bananas, strawberries, marshmallows, graham crackers and a few potato chips for fun. Crushed peppermint was a fun garnish as well. Enjoy!

So simple and so delicious. Don't over think this one.  I accidently bought chocolate mint mini chips. But 25 teens were on their way for a progressive dinner so we wnt with it.  Dumped in 2 bags of chips (is a bag a cup??? Oh well!) And doubled all the other ingredients. Finished with a little extra water to get a good dipping consistency.  It wasn't the only thing I served but it was completely gone in 40 minutes. True winner!

My husband and I have made it a tradition to have cheese and chocolate fondue for Valentine's Day. Every year I end up trying a new chocolate one. This year we tried this one. It was the best ever. We used it with bananas, strawberries, apples, pound cake, wafer vanilla cookies, pretzels, and marshmellows. Each and everyone was delicious. I refrigerated the leftover and take small portions out and microwave, so I have had dessert for several nights. I have been spreading the recipe to my friends.

This was so easy and delicious.  The only thing was, being somewhat lactose intolerant I found it upset my stomach afterwards.  But everyone else loved it.

I make this every New Year’s Eve and serve with fruit and pound cake. I use a bar of Swiss chocolate instead of chocolate chips. Makes the perfect amount and is easy and no-fuss.

This recipe couldn't be any easier. ...and it's delicious! We enjoyed this with friends on Christmas eve. A very fun dessert. A definite repeat. I made it as written using strawberries, bananas, and apples  for dipping.

Wonderful Choc Fondue!!I did a mix of bittersweet and semi sweet and it was perfect!!  I added a little bit of baileys too. ( I just love that flavor with choc) My family loved it and we will be making it again for sure!! Creamy, smooth, and amazing with pound cake, bananas, pretzels, or anything your heart desires!!

I made this during the Christmas holidays and loved it so much that I made it again for New Year's Eve!  It is simple and quick and delicious.  I made it exactly as outlined in a small pot on the stove (starting at a med-low heat).  Then I transferred it to my fondue pot and dipped it with various fruits and a new supermarket discovery - Chinese doughnuts.

Quick, easy, and delicious! Great recipe or just base for a fancier chocolate fondue. I'm sure you could add some walnuts and caramel and turn this into a wonderful turtle fondue!

Made this for my daughter and a bunch of her friends for the last day of school. It was a hit. Made in a crockpot. Used evap instead of water. Took about 40 minutes - halfway through I stirred it. They have requested it for the next get together.

I never take time to write reviews, but I HAD to for this recipe. I tripled the recipe for my 50 person office and everyone absolutely loved it. I actually made the recipe in my crock pot. I left it on high while the chocolate chips melted and continually stirred, and once they were melted turned it on warm so everyone could enjoy. Maybe the best chocolate I've ever had. A must make for any party!

Toppings: Bananas, Strawberries, Store bought angel food cake, graham crackers, and marshmallows.

This was really excellent.  I thought it would be a nice Valentine's treat and it was.  We had strawberries, little oranges (like cuties), and angel food cake.  It was so easy and delish.  I don't have a fondue pot but I'm going to get one to make it more festive.  What the heck, I've wanted to get a fondue pot for a while, so this is a good excuse.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was very good and easy, although I had an issue with the consistency.  Once you have everything melted, do not let it cool off.  It will solidify and then not return to the same consistency when it is re-heated.

While this was very easy to make, the consistency was too thick for my taste.  My family said it tasted fine, but I would not make it again.

Will make again, not too sweet, just right.  Very creamy and you just have to mix it really well.  Make it all in a fondue pot if you have one.??

I made this for New Year's Eve.  It is absolutely the best chocolate fondue I have ever eaten!  We all loved it.  We used it with fruit.  It is just the right consistently to adhere to the fruit without being too thin or too thick.  This recipe is a keeper!

This was a very easy recipe.  Good, but a little thick.
