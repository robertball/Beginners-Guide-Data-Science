This was a no for me... sorry. The spices just did not taste good to me. It wasn't too spicy, but something about the blend was too harsh. I had to add a lot of salt and some Greek yogurt to be able to enjoy this

Too spicy, cannot seem to fix with sour cream, yogurt or honey. Cut down on ginger.

Too spicey and too thick. Next time I'll leave out the cayenne pepper and add more broth.

SO Easy to make and very tasty.  I love the way the spices combine in a mild yet surprisingly spicy way.  Next time I will omit the cayenne as it was just too much for me.
