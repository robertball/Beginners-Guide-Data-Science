I saw this dip last week for the Conference championship games and made it on a whim.  It was well liked and i found it to be very nicely done!  I think the only improvement might be some sliced olives (green & black) on the side that people can add as they please.  Really enjoyed making and eating this one.

I did double this recipe. Because I'm low on mayonnaise, I used half mayonnaise/half sour cream. The boys inhaled this and kept going "mmmmmm" while they were eating it.

This was a great recipe! Everyone in my house loved it. It was pretty salty with the pickled pepperocinis I used, and the summer sausage I subbed for the salami since I had three of them from Christmas! Also subbed chicken for turkey. I omitted the red pepper, used some black pepper and think the summer sausage and pepperocinis gave it some "fire". Maybe use crackers that aren't heavily salted like the flipsides are? It was great though and I would make it again!

I made this as written first....eyeballed it & thought that it would be gone is 10 seconds with my house of men. Tasted it. It was very good. 5 stars! The only sub I made on the original recipe was to use the package of mini heirloom tomatoes (I cut them in big pieces) because that was what I had on hand.

Tweaked it because after I made it - it would not feed 15, which seems to be how many I cook for. Doubled everything except the mayo & added 1/2 cup (chopped them) fire roasted peppers (Trader Joe's Jar), Red Onion (chopped) Granulated Garlic - 2 heaping teaspoons) 1 tsp. Italian Seasoning, 1 can chopped stewed tomatoes with liquid (lower fat than adding more mayo). Let the whole thing sit in the fridge for an hour before the Menfolk found it & started eating it. Let's just say it should have fed 15 when made. Huge Bowl! There is about 1 1/2 cups left 3 hours later. Good Man Food & I liked it too!

I have been making a similar recipe for years.  I use 1/4 lb each of ham, bologna, slicing pepperoni, mozzarella and American cheese. I put all ingredients in a food processor and serve with sliced hoagie/sub/torpedo rolls.  Addictive.

This was a yummy treat.  It was a little heavy on the mayo for me, so I will reduce it next time.  A nice flavor combo!!

This was REALLY good!  I had the deli slice the meat and cheese about 1/4 inch thick and next time I would go smaller because it seemed as though it would stay on the cracker better if it was smaller.  The spread is not "wet" so you can actually put it on the crackers in advance without ending up with soggy crackers (I left one on a cracker for two hours and it was fine).

Great recipe if altered:  I use a little mayo, italian dressing, and italian seasonings.  I used pepperoni and salami, american and swiss, tomatoes, black olives, diced onions, and banana pepper rings.  I served it with sliced italian baguette.  A hit everytime!

This was a nice change at our tailgate party. This is a unique appetizer that does taste like hoagies.

I made this for a party based on all the good reviews and I'm not sure if my deli's quality of meat wasn't up to par or what but I didn't get the "fantastic-ness" of this recipe.  Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad by any means but for me, I'm not sure I'll make it again.  I did use low fat mayo so maybe that is what did it?  Also I didn't see any benefit of adding the tomatoes.  If I make this again I do think what I'll do is spread in between some good italian bread, let it sit for a while to blend flavors and cut serving as finger sandwiches.

consider more jalapeno or red pepper if you want to spice it up a bit

It was excellent.  It can be used as a 'hoagie' spread, a cracker spread or on top of a salad.  Great change of flavor and pace for an appetizer.

Made this for a party, most people liked it well enough to make it again.  As written, I felt the onions were too strong after it sat for a while.  I think I will cut down on onions and perhaps use ham in lieu of turkey.  Needs a little bit more taste for me.

I have made this multiple time now and it is always the first thing gone on a buffet table!! I am planning to make it for a camping weekend, we don't do lunch, we snack instead and this will be perfect!! Very hearty, love it as it is submitted, but sometimes I use whatever I have on hand as far as meat and cheese, it never disappoints!!!

This was delicious!!!!! Very easy to prepare. I thought it might be to much mayo but it wasn't. I did add chopped olives. Next time I will add marinated artichokes. I will definitely be making this again.

Yummmmmy, of course we all adapt and use what we have on hand. I used assorted meats, Italian blend cheese, a touch of Dijon, a plop of sour cream, ok pay attention to this SUN DRIED TOMATOES  YUMMMY. I need to put this away or I will eat it before the party. I will definitely   make this again.

I've made this recipe many times.  I always follow the directions as written and add about 1/4 lb. pepperoni, cut up like the other deli meats.  I always use Boarshead cold cuts.  Every time I make it, I get asked for the recipe.  I usually serve it with flipside crackers, but i've also used cocktail rye and I think that works best.  Great recipe!

Delicious!  I asked the deli to thick, thick slice the turkey and salami.  I then used my chopper to get a fine dice...excellent!! Personal preference used sharp cheddar and no onions.  The Flipsides are a must.  Sturdy and delicious!
