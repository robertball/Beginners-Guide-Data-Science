This is my recipe. If you do not have access to coconut milk, you can use 1 1/2 cup pineapple juice, and add 2 tsp coconut extract.  
Also...for those who called the icing at "hot mess", you clearly didn't read my instrcutions all the way through, which stated: "continue to add confectioners sugar, until desired consistency is reached".  Perhaps, you should try it again, after thoroughly reading the recipe.

Happy baking!

I made the icing first. It turned out a hot mess because it was just pure butter with pineapple flavoring (from the juice). Luckily I was able to whip it into shape by adding MORE confectioners sugar (1 1/2 c), whipped w/ hand mixer 1cup of heavy whipping cream. I did not make the cake.

Followed recipe exactly.  The only change I made was to bake it in a 9x13" glass baking dish,  coconut on top and crushed pineapple spread over that.  OMG, this is one of the best cakes ever!

No access to coconut milk here in Mexico, but did find Cream of Coconut, which I used half cup this & half milk. Cake is very grainy-I would advise using parchment paper on bottom of cake pans-I lost about a third in removal. Very difficult to frost also. 2-9" pans took 42 minutes to bake.Threw in pineapple & flaked coconut in batter. Wont make again, texture wasnt good.

This is the best dag on pineapple coconut cake I’ve ever had! I made it exactly as directed and it turned out perfect. Even had a request to bake one for a coworker. Absolutely love this recipe! Definitely a keeper!

I made this cake and my family loved it.  The only thing was there was too much butter for my icing, so I added cream cheese to it, otherwise I will be making this case again and again and again.  LOVED IT!!! THANK YOU FOR SHARING!

This is the best cake I have ever made, hands down. It’s now the family favorite for birthdays and celebrations. It has a very light texture but a wonderful flavor. I’ve made a lot of cakes over the years and I could have thrown out half of my other recipes after finding this one.
