I cut this recipe in half. I "ground" my oats down in my mini-food processor before soaking them in "soured" milk, which is used in place of the buttermilk. I added one teaspoon of vanilla extract. This pancake recipe was SO GOOD. Hearty? YES! Very filling. The kids had theirs with peanut butter and jam, I had mine with organic applesauce on top. This may be our new favorite pancake recipe! NOTE: Because I cut this recipe in half, I had to figure out what to do about the half egg the recipe called for. I just used two full eggs and cut back on the extra milk called for. Wa-la, problem solved.

Just as the name suggests, this is a very hearty pancake, plus it has wonderful flavor and is healthy to boot - A perfect breakfast.  Definitely soak the oats to soften them, however if you don’t have time to soak the oats, you can grind the oats in the blender before adding in the additional ingredients.  I made the recipe exactly as written with the exception of halving the recipe and wouldn’t make any additional changes.  Two pancakes per person worked for us.

I really got excited about a pancake recipe without added oil, so I wanted my kids to try this one.  For starters, I had to make a substitution, the buttermilk-I did the old standby of adding a teaspoon of lemon juice for each cup of milk.  Because I keep a container of blended oatmeal, I wasn't too worried about soaking the oats.  These were the only changes I made to the original recipe before tasting them.  It is a HUGE recipe and pretty easy to fix with ingredients normally on hand, (sans buttermilk) so that's a plus.  They mixed up nicely and I supposed the cinnamon would be a flavor boost.  I used Pam to spray my griddle with good success-no sticking.  The pancakes when finished were cracked and dry on the outside.  I attributed this to the lack of oil with the recipe.  The texture inside was ok, but the taste was on the bland side.  We couldn't even taste the cinnamon, so that measurement could easily be doubled.  After my first 2 batches of pancakes were made, I added 3 TBSP. of vegetable oil for a more tender pancake.  That was so much better!  Then I added frozen blueberries to the pancakes and that made these AWESOME, and still kept with the hearty and healthy bent to them!  The blueberries brought flavor to them and my kids and I liked these so much more after these 2 additions.  So, a 5 star with the changes of blueberries or chopped apples, the oil and you have a great, hearty and healthy breakfast.

These are delicious and filling.  I"ll definitely make these again but since I was not a fan of the cinnamon, I'll leave that out next time and add some vanilla extract instead.

This pancake is tasty by itself AND flexible to match your tastebuds, which makes it the perfect oatmeal recipe for me! I've made this twice now and sub'd it according to my tastes (and lower caloric preferences): 1) 1% milk + vinegar for buttermilk 2) white whole wheat flour for all flour 3) Splenda sugar blend for sugar 4) 1 tbsp of vanilla for cinnamon 5) egg substitute for eggs 6) Threw in 3 tbsp chia seeds at the very last minute for texture. Using 1/4 cup, I came out with 23 pancakes the first time, and after adding in 1/4 cup milk my second round came out with 22 flatter (but still yummy) pancakes.  EXTRA NOTE: Be sure to spray the pan really good - and I mean REALLY good, as these will stick otherwise. Thanks for the wonderful recipe, jpandmary!

These were so fluffy and delicious! Loved having the oatmeal and whole wheat flour in there to make a pancake a little healthier. Will make again. Followed recipe exactly.

Flavorful and healthy.  For a finer texture, I ran the oats and buttermilk in the blender before the soak time. Yum!

This is a really great recipe and stands up to its name! Now I had a hard time deciding between 4 and 5 stars, but picked 4 for these reasons: I made it as written and it was good. But I liked it better after I added some applesauce, more milk, apple pie spice, and even mini chocolate chips to some and raisins to some. I think I might like the texture (more like traditional buttermilk) if grinding the oats first. But I encourage you to try it and make it your own. Top it with syrup, nutella, etc. You wont be sorry!

These were really very good.  Great consistency and moistness. Great taste and since I could only use the white flour for the recipe as opposed to the part whole wheat (opened the bag and it had bugs!), I can't wait to make them again with the whole wheat addition as I know it will make them taste even more awesome!  This will be my pancake recipe (with the whole wheat!) from now on though I will keep trying other buttermilk recipes until I find buttermilk pancake nirvana!

I've made these pancakes a couple times using this recipe both times with great success. I generally quarter the recipe for my family of three and still have a couple leftovers. I've always just used 2% milk as we never keep buttermilk, I suppose I will have to try with buttermilk to taste the difference. We also generally don't keep rolled oats around so I've been using steel cut scotch oats soaking for 5 - 10 minutes longer with a little more milk.

I just made this recipe, with some modifications, and I LOVED it!  I used Vanilla Almond Milk instead of buttermilk/milk.  I used white wheat flour instead of the two separate types.  I added almond extract, and used brown sugar instead of white sugar (3x amount listed).  They tasted like almond cookie pancakes!  No syrup necessary :)

These are our new family go-to for pancakes.  They are so hearty that they actually stick with you.  Our kids eat 6-7 each, but my husband and I can only handle 3 apiece.  I triple the batch, fry them all up, and freeze the extras.

For buttermilk, I use a combination of kefir and soured milk (milk with vinegar).  This last time I accidentally left out the sugar and the pancakes were still delicious - we didn't even miss the sweetness by the time we added homemade applesauce on top.

This recipe was so good. Made it as is. The only thing I did was to increase the cinnamon and add chopped apple to the uncooked top of the pancake. Delicious! Would also be great with blueberries, rasberries etc.

I was after a hearty pancake recipe with oatmeal. This is a fantastic recipe that fit the bill! I made a few changes based on personal preference. I cut the recipe in half (this amount makes 10 pancakes), added 1/4 c. walnuts, and 3/4 c. frozen blueberries. They were wonderful!!!

For high altitude I decreased baking soda and powder to 1 tsp each and sugar to 1/4 cup. I used soured milk and added vanilla and cinnamon. I used 1/3 cup scoop when putting them in the griddle and yielded 20 hearty pancakes. These fill you up so they're great for a crowd! I might decrease the baking powder a bit more next time as I'm sensitive to the taste of it. Great recipe! This will definitely be replacing my old oatmeal pancake recipe!

Yummy but a little labor intensive.  I like the idea of making them ahead of time and reheating them in the morning.

Made as per recipe. They weren't fluffy and light at all. In fact they were heavy. Love the oatmeal in the recipe but taste were pretty bland. Won't be making these again.

This is our new pancake recipe...we like that they are more like dessert when we put blueberries and syrup on them.  
The only changes were to adjust for the half recipe...I put a full tsp of baking soda and baking powder in and a full 2 eggs.  Also I like cinnamon so I put a little extra and a full tsp of vanilla.  The batter was a little thick so I added extra milk about 1/4 cup more I think...I am more of and eye type cook! :)

P.S. If you forget to soak the oats just let the batter sit for a little while before you start cooking.  And if you grind up the oats first they don't need to soak as long!   Good Luck!
