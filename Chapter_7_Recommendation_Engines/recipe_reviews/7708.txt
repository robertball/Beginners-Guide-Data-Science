The easy way to get an even layer of butter so that all the cake mix gets some is to grate a very cold stick of butter evenly over the top.  Use the butter wrapper to hold the stick as you grate.  You may also use frozen butter. When the dry cake is covered evenly, it is crisp and buttery in the finished product (which is NOT supposed to be cake-like, but more of a fruit crisp.) Delicious!

What did I do wrong?  Perhaps I don't know what a dump cake is suppose to look like, but I thought it was a mess, not only to look at, but overly sweet.  Was something left out of the recipe?  The cake mix just sat on the top, uncooked.  Why was it baked?  It looked the same as it went into the oven.  What an expensive waste if ingredients!

I love this recipe - I used a caramel flavored cake mix and apple pie filling.  Wonderful!  Be sure to use all the juice in the pineapple - do not drain.  I even used a sugar-free vanilla pudding mix and it turned out great.  A keeper!

I immediately see a couple of problems with the recipe...too much dry ingredient and not enough butter.  The pudding mix is unnecessary, as most cake mixes already have pudding in the mix.  By adding more DRY pudding, one may end up with a gelatinous type substance.  Coconut will also make sometimes make things a bit on the dry side.(ever put coconut in a sweetbread of some sort?).  Most dump cakes call for AT LEAST 3/4 cup butter.  When you add it all up, it is no wonder that most reviewers end up with dry cake mix on top that does not go anywhere (but perhaps in the garbage).

I didn't care for the pudding mix in the cake.  There were areas that had almost a gel-like texture.  I made this recipe without the pudding all the time and I will continue to do so.  We did really like the addition of coconut to the recipe.  That was a new one for us and will be a future variation for this recipe.  I have also made this recipe with white or yellow cake mix and it was very good as well.

This recipe bombed! It's not worth your time or expense. I would suggest use choose a different recipe whether than trying this one.  It sounded as though it would be really good.  It's NOT. It might be easy to make but it's NOT GOOD!

it was a little dry, but after it has set on the counter for a few days it is more moist.  i had to use 1 cup of butter for the top or it would have been really dry.  I would only use maybe 3 oz of coconut and 2 cans of cherry pie filling.  There was not enough pie filling and pineapple but too much coconut.

I used 1 cup butter as suggested by other reviewers and still had some dry cake mix that didn't melt after baking this.  My guests thought it was yummy--the parts where the butter/cake mix did incorporate tasted like a brownie and the chocolate and cherry combo was good.  Next time I would omit the walnuts--too many tastes going on.  Not sure if I'd make this one again.

This Recipe was just what I was looking for! I only had choc. cake mix and had everything else. I usually make a similar recipe w/ yellow cake mix and canned peaches..However, I did not add the pudding mix as it is not needed.  I also do not like coconut so I left that out as well.  To avoid a dry crumble make sure your butter is spread evenly across the entire dessert.  This is a must for it to turn out correctly!  Someone suggested grating frozen butter.  I've not tried this, but sounds like a wonderful idea.  I will definately be trying!!  Would make things alot easier.  Another combo that I love is crushed pineapple, blue berries, and yellow cake mix.

If I were to make it again, I would use some of the tips from others and use more butter and melt it first then pour it over the top.

I loved everything BUT the pineapple in this. It didn't blend in with the other flavors. Texture and acidity was just wrong with the pineapple. I used the "cook" kind of pudding and it set up great.

I just made this for my children. I would suggest that the quantity of butter be increased as the ratio of dry ingredients to wet ingredients is too great. The flavor was very processed and benign. I would make it again but with flavor alterations, apple and caramel, suggested by another reviewer, sounds wonderful.

I made this ages ago, and just realized that I'd never written a review. Anyway, I don't really know about it... It was pretty strange. No one really ate much of it. It tasted too "processed" or something to me. I'm usually not a big fan of cake mixes, and this just confirms that all over again for me. Sorry, just not crazy about it :(

The hit of the party.  We can't go back to the original dump cake now.  This was just as easy but with CHOCOLATE!  The pudding mix really is a compliment.

This was so dry, I thought maybe it should have been baked covered or maybe there was a cup of water omitted from the recipe.  It didn't stop my guys from eathing it though!
** Afterthought:  I made sure I used a 9X13 pan.  After reading the other reviews and some seeming like they turned out right, I am wondering if a 9X11 pan was used by those who had good results????

Simply AWESOME!  I used raspberry pie filling and red velvet cake! I cut my butter stick length wise to get even coverage...much easier than shredding. I make diff variations all the time! Such a versatile easy recipe!

I took this to a neighborhood picnic, everyone loved it.  My husband was disappointed that there were no leftovers to bring home. Will have to make again. I used softened margarine in a plastic bag with a small hole cut in the corner,like a pastry bag,then made a lattice pattern across the top of the cake mix. Turned out great.

I actually used this recipe this past summer on a camping trip in a dutch oven. All of my extended family loved it! My husband doesn't like cherry, so I used blackberry filling instead- very yummy. I put whipped cream on top for a nice treat around the campfire. The pineapple and coconut are great complimentary flavors with the berry filling. Thanks for a great recipe!

It was ok,  I used Chocolate pudding and a yellow cake mix, it was all I had on hand. Same principle just switched the flavors. Since it was the first time I made this, I wasn't too sure if I should have put it back in the oven or take it out the way it was. It was too gooey.  I was kinda expecting a "cake like" substance. It sat and sat my kids wouldn't even eat it. Sorry not for me.

Everyone loved it and my husband said 'Don't lose the recipe'. Left out the pudding and used low sugar everything. Do make sure the butter is evenly distributed across the top or you'll have dry spots.

my husband loved it - real sweet.

My husband has a "thing" about soggy cakes and why he won't eat them, so I was positive I would have to polish off the dump cake myself. I was pleasantly surprised that this had more of the texture of cobbler, and he gobbled it right up! Definitely will be making again, and with different variations!
