These were a bit more labor intensive than I expected - but well worth the work.  I bought hazelnuts still in the shell and had to shell them.  Then I roasted them in a 350 oven for 10 minutes and rubbed them in a clean dish towel to remove the brown skin.  Then I had to ground them for the recipe.  Two pounds of hazelnuts in the shell made about 2 1/4 cups of ground hazelnuts.  After all that, the recipe was a snap!  I would definitely make these again but will probably look for hazelnuts already shelled and peeled.

Pretty Good.  My husband loves these.  Very pretty and uncommon taste.  HINT: Buy Hazelnuts all ready shelled and grind them in a mini food processor.  Also mix white and milk CHoclate morsels for the filling and swirl them.  Another thing, don't make them too big, or the choclate center is worthless.

Although the dough was hard to work with and it was more labor intensive than I expected, it was worth the work.  It is one of the best cookies I've ever tatsted.

Excellent recipe! The only problem I came across was the texture of the dough. It was a little difficult to work with. However, they taste great once they are finished!

I modified this recipe to make hazelnut cookies for Passover.  They turned out delicious!  I used 3/4 cup oil instead of the butter, added 1/2 teaspoon salt, increased the hazelnuts to 2 1/2 cups (I had bags of already ground hazelnuts), used 1 1/2 cups potato starch (no flour, of course), and used one whole egg.  I also used raw honey rather than sugar, but I'm sure my modified recipe would work fine with sugar too.  I did not make a filling, as I just wanted plain hazelnut cookies.  The cookies spread out a lot, so if you make them this way, leave plenty of room between them.  They came out beautifully, and everyone loved them!  They tasted like gourmet cookies rather than Passover cookies.  I will definitely make these again!

This is one of the few times I have rated a recipe five stars. This is excellent. I have just taken a batch out of the oven and one happened to topple over as I was moving the cookies to the cooling rack. Too bad, I had too eat it. OMG! These are divine. Thanks for sharing this will become a family favourite for sure!

Great recipe. But the dough is on the dry side. I had to add a bit of milk to get the dough to stick together better to create balls. I also used melted milk chocolate instead of semisweet.

I've made these cookies twice and the whole family enjoys the crumbly texture and hazelnut/choc flavour combo. The kids can't wait to eat them! The dough was a little bit dry the first time around, but I think it might be because the butter I used wasn't softened enough. I was fortunate enough to find a 200g bag of ground hazelnuts (exactly the right quantity required for the recipe) so I didn't have to spend as much time on preparation as some of the other reviewers. Thanks for posting this recipe. I'll definitely be making these cookies again. :)

Very good recipe although, as other reviewers have mentioned, very labor-intensive.  Luckily, I had a cup of toasted ground hazelnuts leftover from another recipe, so I supplemented it with 1/2 cup of pecans.  Pecans make an acceptable substitution for those not willing to spend the time cracking open hazelnuts.  To further simplify, I'm going to experiment with pressing chocolate wafers or Ghiradelli mint chocolate drops into the cookie prior to baking rather than making thumbprints and filling with melted chocolate chips.  I also used the Pampered Chef small scoop and didn't have a problem with the crumbly dough.

I just made these, and am very pleased. They're exactly what I was looking for. A few tips: this is a basic thumbprint dough. The addition of the hazelnuts makes it dry enough that you can use a whole egg, not just the yolk. This saves time and waste, and had no ill effect on the cookies. Also, there's no need to completely melt the chips. If you put a few into each indentation while still on the pan, they will melt and you can then smooth them a bit with a spoon. Simpler this way. Overall, a very satisfying way to use up hazelnuts.

I thought this recipe was really good, will make again, no doubt.  Getting Christmas plates made and this made a great centerpiece with the beautiful chocolate filled cavity.  Yumm.

Instead of chocolate chips, use a high-quality dark chocolate, and add 1 tsp of vegetable oil to it after you have melted it.  Chocolate chips don't have the best texture after they are melted.  These are one of the first cookies to disappear from my cookie trays.

This was a wonderful little cookie! The nutty flavor of the cookie went so well with the chocolate center. Many reviewers commented that the dough was difficult to work with. So, I made sure my butter was super soft by leaving it on the counter for several hours and had no problems working with the dough. I think soft butter really is key. Also, instead of using a spoon, I put my melted chocolate in a baggie and snipped the corner to make a makeshift pastry bag. This made filling the cookies much faster and cleaner. Awesome recipe. My 3-year-old would have eaten them all if I let him :)

really good taste like nuttela , a good recipe to do with the kids esp when pouring the choco into the middle bet they will love to clean the rest of the chocolate. at first i kinda worry at if will be very brittle but after putting on the top of the oven for a few minutes to cool they harden up nicely. i like them more as they are, without any choco since i'm not a choco lover.

These were absolutely fantastic! A huge hit.I must agree with the other reviews - be sure to buy preroasted/peeled hazelnuts, and just use a food processor. Hand "grinding" with a meat cleaver is not recommended. Also, I think I would use less chocolate next time - I feel it detracts from the delicate, melting flavour of the cookie.  Divine! This is an instant favourite.

Probably my own fault.  I used unsalted butter.  These cookies were missing the salt.  Still I think they would be an excellent cookie and very easy to make.

This is a great recipe.  Like other reviewers, I had some chopped hazelnuts on hand, did an allrecipes ingredient search and VOILA!  For those who worry about difficult dough, I made sure my butter was super soft, and I only used 2 cups of flour.  I used some white chocolate drizzle and some semi-sweet.  I only dusted the semi-sweets with powdered sugar since the white was pretty sweet.  These remind me of pecan sandies.  I hope you try this recipe, they do sort of melt in your mouth.

These cookies were pretty good. I didn't have any problem with crumbly dough as some other users have, but I did chill mine overnight (I was making a variety of cookies for a cookie tray and made the dough ahead of time.) They do look very nice on a cookie tray and add variety.

This was a very good recipe, however, the dough was very difficult to work with.  It was very dry and crumbly (similar to graham cracker crust) and hard to mold.  I think I will try adding milk or something to make it a little more maleable.  I also added a 1/4 teaspoon of milk and 1/2 teaspon of chocolate hazelnut oil to the chocolate mix and it made for a very good texture and flavor.
