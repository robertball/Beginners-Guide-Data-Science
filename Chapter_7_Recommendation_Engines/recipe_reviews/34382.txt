Used Swiss instead of American and added minced, sauteed onions to the corned beef. Really good! The sauteed onions made this so much better (tried it without and was less impressed). Easy to make and a great alternative to grilled cheese or a tuna melt.

I made this 'double decker' style.  Using a little more mayonnaise, I layered with a slice of corned beef, a slice of Swiss cheese, another slice of corned beef, a slice of sharp cheddar, and then topped with saut√©ed onions.  I loved it!  Thanks Lena!

Great tasty sandwich.I used Montreal smoked meat with some mozzarella and extra old cheddar slices in between the layer of meat.Also fried up one of my small sized walla walla onions and  added it in the grilled sandwich.They were very tasty that way.
