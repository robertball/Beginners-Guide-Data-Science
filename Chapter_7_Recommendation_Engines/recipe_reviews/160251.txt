Wow!  I had a pot luck Super Bowl party at my house, and made these wings.  They were by far the best dish in our spread. I made 8lbs. and they were gone before the coin flip.  This is recipe for the front of the cook book!

I cut back the water to a half cup. I also added some minced garlic. This works well on de-skinned chicken legs, for those of you who don't make wings. (My husband does....but he's partial to Frank's Hot Sauce wings.) Very nice. This would go well with Sesame Noodles from this site. I didn't think of that until after I made the No-Fuss Potato Salad. Anyway, good recipe. I'd make this again, only next time I'd use brown sugar for a sweet taste but only deeper.

I made these with chicken legs instead of wings. The sauce was good, the meat was very tender.

I like these wings, but do NOT like John Fitzgerald.  He once spit on me at a Metallica concert and his dog impregnated my dog.  You just can't give away American bulldog/jack Russell puppies.

I was really excited about these wings. Unfortunately we just really didn't like the flavor!

It was great!  I used brown sugar instead of white.  I baked it instead of barbecuing it.

This recipe is simply superb!  I did make a few changes, but 1) I don't think they are necessary and they won't suit all people, and 2) One of the changes was due to laziness and the marinade would have been better, not worse, if I had followed instructions.  In other words, I give 5 stars for the recipe *as written* despite my changes.  First, I decided to bake the wings rather than grill them since it's winter and I don't have a grill.  I lined a baking sheet with foil and cooking spray and baked the wings at 350 degrees for 35 minutes.  Second, I got lazy and used dry ginger instead of fresh (big mistake).  Third, after tasting the marinade, it seemed a little bland, so after laying the wings out on the baking sheet, I sprinkled them with a little black pepper and cayenne pepper (actually Penzeys' Black and Red seasoning).  I also used less sugar.  I'm glad I made both of those changes.  I happen to really like strong flavors, so in the future, I plan to replace the water with increased amounts of the liquid ingredients.  The best part about these wings was that even though I baked them in the oven, they still came out extremely tender AND crispy without having to use the broiler.  This is definitely a keeper!

I tried this for my brother and sister in law's family this weekend and everyone loved it! The marinade was easy and very flavorful. We used it on chicken legs the 13 year old ate 4 legs. Thanks!

I found this recipe on AllRecipes.com and have used it for tailgating ever since. Now cooking these wigs for Super Bowl. I change nothing and they are the best. Everyone asks for the recipe and they are the first thing folks go for. The flavor is mmmmmmmm.

Very good - I used brown sugar and added two cloves of garlic, grated.  I also used a bit less Worcestershire - maybe 2 tablespoons.  Baked these in a foil-lined baking dish at 425 degrees for about 35 minutes, turning occasionally.  Great flavor!
