Butternut Squash with Grapes Haiku: "Interesting dish! Wish that I'd had the pine nuts, followed recipe." What a tasty and unusual approach to butternut squash, those little purple bursting orbs of grapes made this really fun to eat, and I'm glad that it wasn't roasted w/ brown sugar and cinnamon as so many winter squashes are. Didn't have the pine nuts although I can only imagine how wonderful of an addition they would be. Sad to say that the rest of my family didn't share my enthusiasm about this though. They were probably still scared of me from all the swearing I did while cutting peeling and cubing the squash to begin w/. Those suckers are a B!

Followed the recipe to the letter, and I wouldn't change a thing (well, I might add a few more grapes).  Of course, the squash caramelizes when roasted, but oh my, those grapes were an incredible partner in this dish. I forgot to put the pine nuts on for the photo, but added them later.  The recipe author says they're "optional," but if you have them, by all means include them because they are the absolute perfect garnish on this side dish.  Jess2011, seriously LOVED your recipe, and this would be a good addition to the Thanksgiving dinner table.

Loved this recipe! Followed the instructions exactly and used 1 pound of grapes instead of the 1/2 pound the dish called for. It was excellent!

This recipe was a big hit at recent dinner party. The squash really cooks down so consider doubling recipe.

We liked this and will probably make it again, but do not think it warranted to the rave reviews others have given it.  I made no changes.

This was amazing! We had an abundance of winter squash from our garden so I used a delicata this time. It not only looks beautiful, it tastes great. The grapes added so much to this dish. Other than substituting the squash I mades it exactly as written.

Made this tonight, and although I have to admit I added some ingredients, it was delicious! I also added mushrooms, honey, ground thyme and a little cayenne pepper. I also melted some butter and poured on at the end.

Delicious! I didn't know roasted grapes could be so good. Definitely double the grapes.  Great easy recipe. Thank you!

I only used the squash, onion and grapes, along with salt and pepper. The only thing I didn't like was the fact that it didn't specify whether a serving was 1 cup or 1/2.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit with even the picky eaters. I used Craisins instead of grapes because I didn’t have grapes on hand, otherwise followed the recipe. It was delicious and I will be using this recipe again for sure

I'll make this again for sure.  I didn't have pine nuts, but I'm sure that would add even more yummy.  Next time...

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe very much! I was surprised he liked it because he generally doesn’t like fruit in savory dishes, but he said “the grapes make this dish”!  I actually forgot to add the pine nuts so when I ate the leftovers I added them then and they added a lot! I will make again! They were even delicious as leftovers! Great recipe, thank you!

It was just ok.  I was excited for the recipe & expected more outstanding results because of the ingredients.  I love butternut squash & am always looking for something new to do with it.  Just average in flavor; nothing outstanding & kind of bland.  Would not make again.

No changes.  Easy prep  (next time pre-cut squash).  Will make it again.  It was a hit with my guests.
