Very nice cake recipe. This was my first try at chiffon cake and I was very pleased with how it turned out. It came easily out of the pan after being loosened just a bit. I couldn't really taste a significant amount of coffee flavor, so I glazed it with an orange glaze so that even if there was a hint of coffee, it would still blend well with the kick of orange. I then topped it with hazelnuts. :) It looks lovely. Thanks for the recipe!

I've made this cake three times already and it always comes out well. This is a great Philippine style mocha chiffon cake recipe. Tip: Use mocha whipped cream as a frosting.

We found this cake heavy and tasteless. The only flavoring is the 2/3 c. of coffee. Maybe if I had used espresso there would have been that coffee flavor I was looking for. I won't be making this one again.
