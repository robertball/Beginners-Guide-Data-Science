We know ricotta and spinach gnocchi as "strangled priest".  Some name. Huh?  LOL.  The gnocchi won't be tough if you don't work the dough too much.  Also, just like with baking bread, you have to take into account the humidity.  You'll use more flour Summertime in FL than you will in the dead of Winter in ND.
As for taste... my own tastebuds prefer this without the brandy extract, but each to his own.  The gorgonzola cream sauce is decadent, though  :-)

Gnocchi takes a soft hand, you have to know the feel of the dough. I have done this with potato and it comes out great. instant mashed or even frozen potato will work. and do not forget to drain you spinach and Ricotta cheese. it has to be DRY or you over work the dough

this is very easy to make in a kitchen aid with  dough hook or food processor with the plastic dough blade.  very tasty.  i add some parmesan to my sauce but that is my preference.

This recipe was absolutely wonderful. I did not add the brandy extract to the sauce, but I made everything else to the recipe. I recommend looking up Strozzapreti on Wikipedia to get the history on this dish. Do not overwork or undercook your pasta, because it will not come out well. This recipe is possibly not for cooks new to working with pasta doughs. Wow!!

This was good but not worth all the effort. It took alot more flour than stated. Was still sticky after adding more and more!

I don't think I made the gnocchi quiet right. I've never made it before but...the sauce is amazing!!!! AMAZING! I've used this sauce on regular pasta many times. It is a nice change of pace.

Great gnocchi recipe. The dough was perfect. I modified the recipe to serve six. Taste and texture was still perfect and cooked up nicely. The cream sauce was great, but made more than enough for even the increased amount of gnocchi. Gorgonzola was a very mild taste and very, very rich. Enjoyed by all!

I didn't make the gorgonzola sauce (I used Julia child's cheese enriched sauce bechamel instead), but these gnocchi were still fantastic. They didn't fall apart when I boiled them, which is something that I've had happen before, and they were nice and soft. These gnocchi have a great flavor, and are even better than the those made from the spinach gnocchi recipe in the vegetarian epicure! I'll definately make these again.

ours ended up a little soupy and the gnocchi a little too chewy.

Sorry that I can't rate the sauce.  We just wanted the gnocchi recipie.  It was delicious.  As stated in another review, go by the "feel" of the dough when it comes to how much flour you will or will not need to add.  If you have made bread this would be obvious.  Thanks for the recipie!

This was absolutely terrible!  I followed the recipe to a T and I couldn't eat them.  On the bright side, the sauce was pretty good :)

I used a squash gnocchi I had already and served over fresh spinach.  Unfortunately I followed the directions exactly for the Gorgonzola cream sauce, when I should have reduced the cream before taking off heat.  My "sauce" tasted ok but was not much more than cream over gnocchi.  Next time I will reduce cream by half then add Gorgonzola.

This was just wonderful! We had to add a little more flour to make the dough work just because it is so humid here right now. Plus, our spinach took about two squeezes to get close to being dry. One tip- measure the wine carefully. 3 Tablespoons is about 1/4 cup- we figured wrong and added almost a half cup so our sauce was thin. This was our fault but we added more gorg. cheese and it was fine. What a great recipe.. thank you so much!!
