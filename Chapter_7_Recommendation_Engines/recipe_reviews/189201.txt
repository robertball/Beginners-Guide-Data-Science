My husband and his friends found this stuffed pepper recipe to go fantasticly over a steak. With a little adjusting you could grill them for a great addition to any outdoor dinner.

LOVED THIS! Made exactly, but used a slightly spicier pepper. Don't overbake if you like the pepper a little crispy. TIP: Microwave your bacon for 5 minutes before you wrap the peppers....it'll crisp up faster in the oven!  If your feta is really crumbly, add a tablespoon or two of cream cheese to the filling...it holds it together easier while you wrap the bacon.
Definitely would make this again!
