These were delicious! I only made a couple of adjustments to the recipe . . . once the brats were cooked in the beer/water, I threw them on the outdoor grill for a few minutes to brown them up and give them come grill marks. The only other change I made was that I skipped the red cabbage, and only used green cabbage. I really liked the cabbage mixture, and it really added a nice flavor the the bratwurst. Since moving to Georgia from Wisconsin, I had a hard time finding "brat buns" here in GA. I'm so glad that Ballpark finally has them down here in the south, because using a hot dog bun for a bratwurst is just NOT the same!

Made this for dinner for the family and it turned out amazing.  I did however make a few alterations.  In the cooking recipe I did not add any beer.  I am allergic to hops so instead I added Worcestershire, mustard seeds, chili flakes, S&P.  The brats were flavorful and very juicy.  I cooked mine in a VERY slow simmer for 10 min on each side.  The slaw was acidic with just a hint of sweetness from the brown sugar.  I also added a mayo/sriracha mixture to the buns after I toasted them.  Since the slaw was acid based I felt it needed a creamy fat to balance it.  

All in all it was excellent and something I plan to make again.

This was a fast and delicious summer dinner!  We really enjoyed it with the cabbage from the garden.

7.29.18  Always have struggled trying to find a bun to fit a bratwurst.  It took me five trips to different grocery stores, but I found the Tailgaters buns, and that’s what I’ll  now use every time that I cook a bratwurst.  This bun held up incredibly well to a big, white, grilled German bratwurst bought at a German meat market in Sarasota.  Even though the recipe didn’t say to grill, it is called “Grilled Brats…” so I tossed both the buns and brats on the grill…delicious!  Served with Oktoberfest Potato Salad on this site.

What an easy change up from sauerkraut!  The cabbage still had a little crunch and also had a nice tang with bite from the spices.  I loved these, make sure you use a German mustard too!

Husband and I loved it. Used hoagie rolls, otherwise, made exactly by the recipe.

We loved this Brat recipe. The quick cooked cabbage added both flavor and color.  We really liked the mustard with the cabbage and onion mixture.   The toasted Tailgater buns by Ballpark held up too.  Next time I will try grilling the brats then put them on the stove in the "Beer bath" and serve it with that good cabbage mixture.

These were delicious!  The quick braised cabbage/onion mixture is a great flavor compliment to the brats.  The recipe makes quite a bit of cabbage mixture and for us could have probably been reduced by half.  We had a lot leftover.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This was even better than I expected!! We typically grill our brats, but were pleasantly surprised by how delicious they were after stove-top cooking. The cabbage and some deli mustard were perfect on top.
I'll definitely make this one again!!

Made as written minus the allspice because I overlooked it and these were great! The cabbage is tart which is just the way we like it. It is also colorful which makes a much prettier presentation than sauerkraut. The next time rain ruins your cookout, bust out your skillet and make these instead!
