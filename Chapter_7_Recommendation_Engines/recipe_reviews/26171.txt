Thanks for the recipe. I've made something similar to this in the past but couldn't quite remember it. Try putting chocolate chips and butterscotch chips on the top melt in oven and then spread swirling the chocolate and butterscotch together.

VERY easy to make. I made with the recipe for homemade Caramel (look it up it is a must) and I added chocoalte all over it not just the top, like the candy bar itself. MY family loved it better then the store bought candy bar! Great x-mas gifts

Not bad flavour I covered the whole top with chocolate chips let them melt and then spread them around to make a chocolate covering because otherwise they are not very attractive. Also very very chewy! Hard to eat because of the texture!

I experimented trying to recreate the Heydey cookies that were available when I was younger. I added sugar wafer cookies with the cream scraped off and they were incredible. This is a keeper! The next time I might double or triple the amount of caramels since I don't think there is such a thing as too much caramel. I remember my mom making this and I never could find her recipe I am so glad I found it here
