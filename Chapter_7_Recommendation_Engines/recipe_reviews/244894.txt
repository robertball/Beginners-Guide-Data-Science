I didn't make any changes to the  recipe.  So the good: the pear mixture tasted great we had leftover and  loved getting to snack on it.  The bad: my dough literally melted down in the oven, it was awful.  I think the dough needs to remain cold.  And each step needs to be done quickly and I think my dough warmed up too much. But without trying again that's my best guess.
