Great recipe.  To lower the calorie count I used a vegetable spray to saute instead of butter, used half of the cheese and blended 1/3 of the soup in my blender rather than thickening with the flour and milk. Still tastes great and is healthier as I try to drop post holiday pounds!

My family and I really liked this chowder~!  I did follow the suggestions and used a cup more water than called for, and it was still thick, but good.  I used all 3 cups cheese because we absolutely love cheese. However, it did make it a little more like a dip and less like a soup, so I will only use 2 cups next time as other reviewers suggested. What I LOVE about this recipe is you can literally use whatever veggies and whatever cheese your family likes most.  You can't mess it up!  I used frozen and fresh veggies, but I think next time I will add more.  I will also not simmer for 20 minutes, but only about 10 minutes until crisp tender, as the veggies get even softer when the chowder has to boil again. I look forward to experimenting with this recipe in the future as this will be a regular for us!

I recommend this recipe highly.  I followed other recommendations to go light on the cheese and had to add the rest of the cheese later.  I'm learning to take suggestions through the context of the reviewers own personal preference.  If you like thick soup, as I do--by all means leave the cheese in.  In my opinion, it's not overwhelming and tastes great.  The soup tastes delicious without cheese too, so let common sense lead you to what tastes best to YOU!

Really wonderful!  I wondered how it could be so good, so decided to try it.  I added a whole red pepper, and a whole chopped onion and a 1/2 head of chopped cabbage because I had it on hand. My secret ingedient in all soups is using a cup of juice rendered from caramelizing 10 sliced onions in the crockpot with one cube of butter for about 18 hours. I strain, and pkg the onions and the juice each in 1 cup baggies, and freeze.  The onions go on meat, and the juice into soups.  With this addition this chowder should go to a 10 star rating!

In my opinion I destroyed this recipe the first time I made it by mixing the cheese into the soup.  At most, I suggest serving the soup with cheese sprinkled on top - I also enjoy it with no cheese at all - but there is no need to enrich the soup further by mixing in the cheese, ESPECIALLY in the quantity suggested.

I love this recipe.  It is easy and flexible.  Don't be afraid of it if you don't think you like cauliflower, which acts to make it "potato soup-like".  Do what others suggest with chicken broth.  Do not overly chop up the brocoli and cauliflower.  One can vary the recipe and use up vegetables one has on hand.  The next day it thickens, and my mom thins it with more broth.

What a great simple nutrient dense soup!  I didn't have/don't like all of the ingredients, so I just used the veggies I had on hand (2 red bell peppers, 1 orange bell pepper, 4-5 carrots-some chopped/some shaved, 1/2 a red onion, 2 broccoli crowns, about 1/2 bag of frozen white shoepeg corn, and 1 box of frozen peas) and didn't measure anything.  I sauteed the onion and peppers in a dash of EVOO and 2 healthy spoons of minced garlic, then added a carton of chicken broth and the remaining veggies and simmered for about 10 minutes.  I added a can of skim evaporated milk w/a dash of flour mixed in.  Then, I lightly blended some of the soup w/my immersion blender and added about 2/3 a 2 cup bag of 2% shredded cheddar.  Good stuff!  Even Mr. LTH said "Tell them Mr. "L""T""H" like this"....

Good chowder.  I didn't use any peppers because I didn't have any; also substituted soy milk instead of real milk, and reduced flour to 1/4 cup. 
Thanks!

If you like thick chowder, this is it. Very, very good. I used frozen veggies instead of chopping for hours and it was still excellent. Bacon would've been a nice addition and maybe a handful of fresh diced tomatoes to top it off. I'll definitely make this again.

I have been looking for a good cheesy soup and this was it!  SO good.  Maybe a little to much cheese though I think that next time I will use only 2 cups.

I fixed this last Thanksgiving using vegetable bouillon so that my vegetarian friends could enjoy it.  I used butter and only 1/4 cup of flour, because we wanted a creamy rather than a thick chowder.  I put the shredded cheese in a bowl and let folks put their own over the top when they served themselves in our buffet.  Everyone liked it so much I ended up fixing it again for Christmas...and we'll definitely have it as the "keep us going till dinner" soup this Thanksgiving, too!

A thick, rich, and delicious soup.  You won't miss the meat!  Of course, a few tweaks: I used a 16oz bag of frozen broccoli and cauliflower along with the other fresh veggies.  I added 32 oz chicken broth, and less flour, about 1/3 cup.  This yeilded an incredibly thick chowder.  Perfect on a cold winters day.  Thank you for your submission, well done indeed!

i couldn't believe this was so good considering how fast this was to put together; even with having to chop lots of fresh produce (used food processor). Used 2 bouillon cubes instead of 3 and a little less cheese and this tasted VERY good - even my 2 year old ate it!

Very, very good!!! I used a frozen vegi mix of the same vegetables and it was even faster to put together.  So good that our 17 y/o who has no interest in broccoli/cauliflower had 2 bowls and asked me to make more! Thank you!

I love this soup! I did make a couple of changes, though. I sauteed some bacon, removed it when crisp, and used the drippings for the veggies. I also pureed the soup before adding the cheese (only 2 cups rather than 3), then crumbled the bacon into it once the cheese was melted. Yummmy!

This recipe turned out pretty well.  It was a pretty "heavy" soup; I would recommend adding some lemon juice at the table, but then I put lemon juice on almost everything.

Using up broccoli and cauliflower from holidays.  Omitted celery, red pepper.  Doubled broc., caulif., and onion.  Decreased carrots to handfull for color, and substituted cheese with velveeta to be able to reheat at work.  Tastes wonderful - even with all the changes.  Only suggestion:  decrease simmer time from 20 to 10 min or so so veggies don't turn to mush when reheating.

3/18/2007:  Made again using up veggie tray from last night.  Used pre-shreaded cheddar.  AWFUL! The powder it was packaged with to keep shreads from sticking together kept the soup from being creamy. Gritty tasting.  Should have used my own advice and gone with the velveeta!

At last a recipe that 'disguises' the veggies. I have a 16 year old who will only eat 3 vegetables, so when I came across this recipe I thought I'd died and gone to heaven! I made it just 'as is' EXCEPT I add more milk to thin it out and give the 'kid' a little more nutrients. After cooking it for the 2 minutes, I just added more milk until I was satisfied with the consistency. I also added all the cheese. The 'kid' needs every nutrient I can get into him. It worked! I had half a pot of the soup in the fridge and between him and a friend they had it for a late supper AND for breakfast! I had to make another batch (this time I doubled it, just to be safe) My oldest son said he liked the soup even before I added the milk mixture and cheese and my husband had 2 large bowls. Everyone loves it. So..... this one is definitely a 'KEEPER'.  I hate to chop veggies but this recipe was well worth the effort and the second time I made it the chopping didn't seem so bad. Thanks for a great and easy recipe !

This was a really good recipe.  I don't eat carrots, so I substituted asparagus instead.  You could use any veggies and it would be great.  I used all the cheese, and found it to be perfect, but I really like cheesy soups.  Thanks for sharing.

This chowder is great!  I used all the recommended vegetables and added peas corn and green beans proportionately because I wanted to use them up while they were fresh.  I cut the cheese in half because of the calories, but it still turned out *****.  Thanks.

Delicious! Just used 1/4 cup of flour which I added to the butter, onions and pepper to make a roux. Then substituted vegetable boullion for chicken to make it vegetarian for my picky vegetarian daughter. Only cooked vegetables 10 minutes as another reviewer recommended because we like a little crunch left, Otherwise followed directions. Creamy and delicious, very hearty. Whole family loved it. Even my carnivorous husband and son went back for seconds!

This soup was so good! I feel like celery does not add much, and I would have had too much left over if I'd bought the bunches my store had, so instead I just put in 2 red peppers. Confession: I definitely used WAY more than 1 C of each vegetable, I wanted a big pot of soup. I have this problem with buying vegetables in equal quantities and then realizing at home that they are like 3x what the recipe calls for. I used 3 of what my store labeled 'broccoli crowns' and only 1 cauliflower head which was kind of smallish, could've added two IMO. A medium/large onion, 2 cans of corn because I LOVE corn in soup, and 3 or 4 carrots. My fiancee requested THICK soup so I added a little more flour/milk on top of the around-3x ingredients I used and it thickened amazingly, especially the next day. HOWEVER: I did not add ANY cheese to this. I see no point. The red peppers, butter, and onions you cook at first gives this incredible, sweet aftertaste that would be totally lost with cheese IMHO. I did not triple the bouillon though and I used dried parsley instead of fresh. Never would've put broccoli and cauliflower in chowder otherwise. Thanks very much for the recipe.

You'll be lickin' your bowls clean! My meat junkie boyfriend even liked this! I omitted the margarine, broccoli and salt (the chicken bouillon has enough salt). I chopped 1/2 an onion in my 'mini prep' which released enough juices to saute it in along w/ 1T of EVOO. I added 1C of frozen corn, used 1% milk, only 1/3 cup of cheese and 1T of cornstarch in place of the flour, as it's only purpose is to thicken the soup. I also added 1t of red pepper flakes. This is my new favorite soup!

Delicious!  I used vegetable bullion to make this vegetarian and it was a big hit.  I chopped the veggies up really small - but next time I think I'll leave them a bit more "chunky" for better texture.  This one's a keeper!

Really yummy, easy and fast, a great combination!  I used zucchini instead of cauliflour and some chopped fresh basil instead of parsely, also some harvarti mixed with the cheddar; all worked really well.

I doubled the recipe and cut way back on the cheese as others suggested. Instead I kept some on the side so that ewach can add it as they like. Just as good re-heated the next day.

We made this as a Girl Scouts group for a dinner at a Ronald McDonald house--it is SO SO good.  Very easy too, once you get the vegetables chopped.  We did add one extra cup of water after the milk/flour mixture, and only 1 1/2 cups of the cheese.  Really really good!

This was an excellent recipe. I used frozen chinese vegetables that I had in the freezer so it was very quick to make. I did find it really thick so I added a little more broth and the end

I would add another one cup of water to make the soup a little less dense, 
also I only used 2 cups of cheese instead of 3 to cut down on calories.

Made this recipe tonight and it was wonderful! However, did add some bacon and used the fat rendered from the bacon too so decreased the amount of margarine. Would have prefered it with half the amount of cheese but will definately make again.

I added boneless, skinless chicken breasts cut into bite-size pieces to sauted pepper, onions, and chicken broth. Simmered until chicken almost done, then continued recipe.

I loved this! I cooked 2 pieces of chopped bacon 1st, for that smokey taste, then added a splash of olive oil & sauteed my onion and then sprinkled 1/2 cup of flour to cook out any flour taste, added broth instead of water/bouillon and then tossed in my veggies & herbes de provence along with a bay leaf. Once cooked I blended 1/2 of the mixture for added creaminess, then added half & half and cheese. YUM!

I have to say that this was a great change of pace from my normal bean soups.  Loved the richness but even though I cut down the cheese to two cups (and I LOVE cheese), I still thought it was a little too cheesy and will use less next time.  Just used the veggies I had on hand, bell pepper, onion, zucchini, summer squash and asparagus and added some dried thyme.  Garnished with a sprinkle of cheese and the aspragus heads.  Will definitely make again.

Wow, I can't believe how well this turned out considering I didn't have a lot of the ingredients on hand. I wanted to use up a lot of veggies before they went bad, and this is an incredibly versatile recipe.  I used onion, garlic, carrots, celery, & broccoli, with a box of chicken broth (4 cups), then evaporated milk, a little flour, 2c cheese, some cilantro & green onions at the end. My husband and I had thirds, my 6-yr old had seconds, and my picky 3-yr old ate some of it.  This will definitely be a stand-by recipe for us. Thanks!

What a delight.  I used 12 oz. bottle of Michelob Ultra and water to total 1 1/2 C.  I am not a beer drinker but recipe turned out yummy.  Great way to use up beer.  Would NOT make the recipe w/o beer.  Husband agrees (and he is not a beer drinker either).  I used 2 1/2 C. of cheese.  The consistancy was perfect.  Can't wait for the leftovers.  Will make again and again and again.  Thanks.

really good!!!  i didn't really follow the recipe, i didn't measure anything, but i used the basic idea to make a really good stew type of soup.  i put corn, potatoes, green beans, and garlic.  more onion. added my own spices.  didn't use the flour to thicken, instead used 1 can of white beans along with soup in blender.  used vegetable broth instead of chicken cubes.  let it stew on low on the stove for a couple of hours.  really really good!

This recipe ROCKS! I doubled the liquids and used a load of fresh veggies, whatever I had on hand. I eliminated the margarine (unnecessary calories) and just sauteed the onion in a generous dollop of olive oil. I also added a few cans of corn and diced potatoes to bulk it out--wonderful! I used evaporated milk and cut the amount of cheese by a third; otherwise it is just too rich. For a more full-bodied soup, try using vegetable broth or stock instead of bouillon and water. White pepper also worked nicely in this. I made a huge double batch and brought it in to work and they were licking the bowls and clamoring for more!

THIS IS A GREAT RECIPE!  Rated superior by me, my husband and my 30 something son!  Suggestion - if you have good eaters, I doubled this recipe and it only served the three of us, and had just enough for 3 lunches the next day.  Perfect.  My husband added a splash of tobasco to his and raved about it!  I did use all half-n-half, and real butter, as I like real food.  I used all the sharp cheddar cheese called for - not too cheesy for any of us!  I also used 6c (doubled recipe)natural chicken broth instead of water and boullion cubes. (don't like the msg in bouillon).  Thanks for a great recipe - just needs to be doubled for a family.

Probably one of the best cream soups I have had in ages.  I made this recipe exactly as indicated except used homemade chicken broth instead of the water and bouillon cubes.  Do not skimp on the cheese as some reviewers said - it is absolutely perfect and tastes like something you would have in any good restaurant.  Try this and you won't be disappointed.  5 Stars for me.

5 stars with a few changes - I added another cup water and bullion; 1 cup heavy cream instead of milk, omitted the cauliflower and celery, added 1 can green beans, and various leftover meats (half a meatloaf, half lb sausage, 6 slices bacon). Turned out delish!

Very good hearty soup!  Doubled veggies and added about 1 1/2 c. more water.  I also halved the margarine and did 2 c. cheese.  Delicious!

Very yummy! A big hit with the kids. I added potatoes which helped thicken the soup so the flour wasn't necessary. We have a gluten sensitivity in the family and potatoes are an easy way to make a soup gluten free. Thanks for the recipe it's become a staple for us during the winter months.

this was too thick and cheesy for me, even with using only 2 cups of cheese and an extra cup of water.  next time i will use 1 cup cheese and still add even another cup of water.  but it is a good base recipe -- using whatever veggies i had (red peppers, onions, broccoli, cauliflower and carrots), plus some minced garlic.  i might add a can of corn and can of black beans or even some rice next time and make it super hearty.

This recipe is such a wonderful recipe. I made it last night for our dinner together with “Crayfish and Prawn Salad with Butterbeans” and “Bass escalope with pine nuts and black olives” that I discovered at and , the recipes in the site was really amazing take a glance at those site for more exciting and nutritious recipes. Have fun!!

Loved, loved, loved this chowder. Using others suggestion, I increased the water another cup and cut back on the cheese. I also added a can of corn which added some sweetness. Excellent and as stated by others I'm sure most any veggie would work...

We loved this! I changed a few things, just based on what I had on hand. First, I sauteed the onion, bell pepper with 1/3 pound of bacon until the veggies were done and the bacon was crisp. Then I threw in carrots, celery, zucchini, summer squash, cauliflower, broccoli and mushrooms. I let that simmer for about 20 minutes then mixed in the milk/flour mixture (I used half & half). Added about 1 1/2 cups of a cheddar cheese blend. The whole thing came out fantastic! Might add corn next time.

This soup is very easy, simple, and great! For a creamy chowder soup it isn't high in fat like most others. I did make a few changes...
- I used just a little bit of olive oil instead of the margarine
- I added 2 extra cups of water/bouillon
- I added squash, zucchini, and corn

I will definitely be making this again. It was an excellent recipe for getting my little one to eat her vegetables.

This was fabulous! The only changes I made were to sub fresh corn for the cauliflower, and to reduce the cheese to about 2 cups. My husband asked me to add this to our regular rotation.

I love this recipe, and have made it 10 times at least.  It has been a great way to get veggies into little tikes, even though they hate broccoli in every other form.  I love it with the red pepper, but omit it most of the time, as it presents a texture and taste they don't go for.  I also put their portions through one or two pulses in the food processor so they don't see all the chunky vegetables they are gobbling up.  This recipe is very adaptive, and you can double up or omit just about any of the vegetables.  I use vegetable stock instead of bouillon.

A great baseline soup for anything you might have on hand!  I used potatoes, frozen vegetables, and leftover beef kielbasa. A little less cheese, but then used some to top with.  AND instead of water and bouillon, I used equivalent broth.  My personal touch? A little celery seed sprinkled into the simmering broth.  YUM!

This is much better than it looks. I did as another reviewer and omitted the flour and used my immersion blender to blend about half the soup, but leaving it chunky. I added the cup of milk, using 1/2 cream and 1/2 1% fat milk, and only 1 cup of Cheddar cheese. I also used dry parsley instead of fresh. What a great way to get your veggies!

Oh Wow! This is awesome. I followed the recipe exactly except I only put two cups of cheese in the soup and left the extra cup for a garnish. I also pureed the soup because I have a toddler and if she saw the veggies she would never try it. We all LOVED it.

I love this recipie.  This was recpie was great. I used frozen veggies and it turned out great. I used frozen corn, brocoli, fresh carrots, fresh red peppers, etc. I love the flexibility to add whatever vegatables that you like/have available. I like to sprinkle a little bit of chedder on top when served.  The next time I make, I will have this as a side dish to the Bacon Pepper Jack Chicken sandwich (on this site).

Great base for a creamy soup.  I used onions, garlic, carrots, celery and broccoli.  Left out the cheese entirely.  Turned out delicious and I would definitely make it again.

...I started out making House Fried Rice and discovered I was out of rice!? (heat must be getting to me)..so..with my veggies semi-stir fried I decided to make soup.  Threw my veggies (onion, broc, carrots and celery) in a stock pot added some frozen corn and roasted red pepper and garlic and proceeded with this recipe.  I didn't have to boil the veggies just brought the chicken broth to a simmer, added the milk and flour..stirred..added the parsley, lots of ground black pepper and sharp cheddar.  Good soup!  Served with Tomato Bruschetta. Thanks R.A...you saved the day.

The kids loved this! My kids will never knowingly tough a bell pepper or onion, but ate all of this.

I found this recipe when looking for something to use up a drawer full of veggies in the refrigerator; it was perfect!  I didn't have any cauliflower, but lots of broccoli so I doubled it.  Tossed in a clove of pressed garlic.  And we only had to cook for 15 minutes (I suspect since the veggies were a week old in the fridge), but it turned out great!  

The only thing I might change if I make again is to add a little more spice- maybe some chili powder or an herb blend.

It's a good thing it turned out well... the recipe only used up about half of the veggies, so I might make again this week!

Love it.  I made it with veggie bouillon and only 2 cups of cheese, and it turned out great.  I think you could use even less cheese with great results.  This is a good recipe for using up all of the odds and ends of vegetables in your refrigerator.

This turned out really well. (I usually have bad luck w/ cream chowders.) If you are making this as 1 course of a larger meal this recipe will suffice for a small party. Double it if you are using it as a meal. Thick enough to be poured over rice or a pasta. I made this w/ 1% milk. Lowered the fat content withoout sacrificing taste.

Very good recipe. You can practically use any veggies you have on hand. I found the chowder too thick and will cut down flour to 1/4 cup next time. Used a can of fat-free evaporated milk. Served with cheese sprinkled on top. Delish - this is going into my six-week meal plan!

Absolutely great! This turned out perfect! I used chicken stock, rather than water and then added one boullion cube. I also did not use as much cheese. I used my dad's technique of shaking the flower and milk in a small closed tupperware container, before adding it to the soup. I added a clove of garlic to the veggies while they were simmering (then removed it before adding the flower/milk) to add a little more flavor. My husband doesn't like strong onion/garlic flavors, so this is one way I sneak in a bit of garlic. This recipe made it into my recipe binder, so 5 stars for this one!

Great recipe - easy, fast and nutritous!  I double the recipe to have leftovers.  Here's what I changed: I pureed a 15 oz. can of cannellini beans instead of using the milk/flour combo to thicken the soup (use any light colored beans - pinto, garbanzo) and also took a few ladles full of soup and pureed that.  Added a bit of half & half for the creamy look/taste (maybe added 6-8 oz). You also really don't need all that much cheese - I used 2C the first time I made it and only 1C the second time (even though I doubled everything else). IT WAS AWESOME!

Great soup. I made a mistake when I pureed half of it. It turned orange in color..It still tasted great though. Will make again and with a cup less cheese. Cheers!

One of the best recipes on here. So delicious I put it on my 6 week family menu. I followed the recipe to a tee except that I chop the veggies with a food processor until they're in coarse chunks. You can reduce the calories by sautéing the veggies in Pam, eliminating the flour/water step like previous posters and processing half the soup until pureed, putting it back in the mix and eliminating the cheese altogether. The soup is so goo it's not even needed. Do yourself a favour and try this!

Can't say how much I loved it!  Like others mentioned, I used an immersion blender near the end to puree some of the veggies.  It turned out like a chunky cream soup.  Added about half the amount of cheese and couldn't believe how wonderful it was.  My family went on and on about it.  Restaurant quailty soup.  Will definitely make many more times!  Could use the same basic recipe and technique to make whatever kind of veggie soup you like:  broccoli cheese, creamy cauliflower, etc. Thanks for a great addition to my recipe box!!

I have made this a few times and it always turns out great! I usually follow the recipe, but add a dash of curry & nutmeg with the milk. I'm not a bit fan of curry, but it seems to work in this recipe.

I made this a few nights ago and it was fabulous! I am glad that I read the reviews regarding the cheese. Once the flour and water is added it is already quite thick and that was even after me adding a cup more water. I did not add cheese at all except for on top when I served it and it was perfect. Even the next day...my son and I had leftovers and without the cheese being in it...before I heated it...I still added extra milk as it was very thick. I can't imagine just how thick it would be if I had added the amount of cheese it suggested. I will be making this one again and again...just as I did and it will be perfect. Oh...I did add about a half teaspoon of paprika and basil to it and I do think it added a little something. Try this one...without the amount of cheese suggested and you will love it too.

I just loved this soup.  Because i have to watch my vitamin K intake, I didn't use the broccoli, or caulifower.  Instead I used a can of mixed veges, plus corn, green beans, and peas. Used 2 cups of half and half, and one cup of 2% milk with the flour.  Turned out great.

I modified this recipe for Atkins by adding more water, replacing the carrots with green pepper, eliminating the flour and putting in a half a cup of cream instead of milk. Came out thinner without the flour, but still was very tasty

Very good!  I substited with frozen vegetables (but then I simmered for the 20 minutes and that was not necessary, my veggies were over cooked).  I also used a can of beer and one cup of water.  Will definately make again!

Great recipe. To make it more of a meal, I added some chicken strips and potato. I also used Manchego cheese instead of cheddar. It turned out great and was just the right thickness. I added some ground nutmeg, Cayenne pepper, and paprika to zip it up a bit. I would definitely make it again.

Delicious and nutritious! I used a whole head of cauliflower and a whole bushel of broccoli so I added 2 cups of water to compensate.  It turned out perfect.  I would definitely go with the 3 cups of cheese, too.  This will be a regular for me.

Wonderful chowder!  I used butter to saute the pepper and onions; about 4 cups of homemade chicken broth instead of the bouillon/water.  Took the advise of some of the reviewers to use half of the suggested amount of cheese.  This turned out to be a great meal served with some fresh French Bread.  Thank you for sharing, TALL MOM.  This is a keeper and will definitely be making again.

This was a very quick simple soup to make for a busy night. I didn't have cauliflower, so added in a whole bell pepper and onion. I used my own chicken broth instead of water and bouillon cubes. We don't ever have margarine, so I used butter. I did add in some minced garlic along with the other vegetables. You may want to add in some more spices, it is a bit on the bland side, but that is just us, we like flavoring from herbs. This is a pretty flexible recipe to use what you have on hand.

Very good, just the taste I was looking for.  Used homemade chicken stock, non fat milk, 2 tbls. butter.  Did not have red pepper and husband doesn't like cook carrots so doubled the brocolli and cauliflower.  Had to add a bit more milk as it was too thick.  Used 1 1/2 c. sharp cheddar.  Before adding cheese I used my submersible hand blended and blened it about half way.  Wow, it is excellent.  Will make again.

Shoulda doubled the recipe!
We loved it! I followed almost exactly but omitted the flour for a little corn starch in cold water. I think I used at least 2 cups of cheese and was very pleased. Next time Ill leave out the red pepper and maybe add some zucchini or cabbage.

Great recipe! Thanks!

Didn't have any celery on hand so left that out, and didn't have any fresh parsley so just used dried.  Other than that followed exactly.  Turned out delicious and would make again.

I used the frozen mirepoix mix for the chopped parts and the frozen vegetable mix (italian) for the veggies. I also substituted soy mix for milk and chicken broth (3 c) for the bouillon, added seasoned salt and it was delicious!!

Delicious! It's a great way to empty your refrigerator of leftover bits and pieces of veggies. I prepared it right up to the time you're to add milk and cheese and froze it, adding them when I was ready to serve it.  I used homemade chicken broth rather than boullion cubes, to cut down on sodium. Thanks for a great recipe.

4.5 stars. It'd be 5 stars with additional spices. I'm sure I'll make this again, and I'll try adding garlic and thyme, and add jalapenos to my vegetable list. I used evaporated milk for 1 cup of the milk because it needed to be used up; I think it helped make the soup thick & rich. I pureed my vegetables after the 20 minute boil (husband has texture issues). I didn't measure my vegetables at all, because I'm a rebel like that, and I overdid it on the carrots, which made it too sweet. 2 carrots was 1 too many for us. Thanks for the recipe, I'll definitely make this one again, as it's so easy to modify with what you have on hand!

I made this for dinner the other night and served it with some homemade crusty bread.  The end result was good, satisfying soup - but it was very basic, so I probably won't make it again (there are other recipes out there that are better, and just as easy to make).

I double the entire recipe, but still use only 3-4 cups of cheese. This is a winter time regular, and it's a great way to get in some veggies.

I just served this to a crowd the other night, and what a huge hit it was!  There were several requests for the recipe.  It was super easy, and I only made a couple of small changes--used cream instead of milk (although it was so rich, I probably could have stuck with milk)and reduced the cheese to two cups (it was still incredibly cheesy).  Oh, yes, and I also added mushrooms and a couple of shakes of red pepper flakes. I know I'll use this recipe many times.

Fantastic recipe! I used only a small pat of butter and a little olive oil to saute the onions/peppers, added mushrooms and corn, and reduced the cheese to about 1/2 cup sharp cheddar, with a little sprinkled on top of each bowl. I also blended the soup just a little bit with my handheld mixer to give it a smoother consistency (but still let some veggie chunks remain). I thought the recipe was absolutely delicious. I am definitely adding it to my meal rotation. Thank you!!

This is my all-time favourite vegetable soup -- I usually don't change a thing, except once in a while I throw in some potatoes and I usually add a bit of roasted red pepper seasoning -- yummy! Thanks for this great recipe!

I just came back from a baby shower and made this chowder.  Everyone absolutely loved it.  The thick and richness of it made everyone go back for seconds.  In fact, half of them took some hope with them.  I'm sure glad I doubled the recipe.  Thanks for not embarrassing me with a new recipe that had never been tested by me first.

This was a good recipe.  The fresh parsley I would omit next time.  It overpowered the dish.  I realized our family isn't big on dairy, which is probably why it didn't get eaten entirely like I had hoped.  Of course, this has nothing to do with the quality of the recipe.  It's my family that has a persional dislike for recipes that call for too much dairy.  Thank you and God Bless You for sharing.

This recipe made a lovely, thick, heart-warming soup. I doubled the recipe, so cutting up all the veggies was labour intensive, but it was worth the effort. Even my 7-year-old son, who doesn't care for vegetables, ate a whole bowl of it and said it was good. My husband loved it and asked me to make it again. One note: even with a doubled recipe I only used 2 cups of grated cheese and it was yummy. I noticed that a lot of the recipes on this site have a very high fat or sugar content and quite often I cut down on the fat or sugar. In this case, I think 3 cups of cheese for 6-8 servings would have been too much. I think next time I will also use a bit less flour because it had a very thick consistency. Thanks for a great recipe!

this soup was well liked by my family.  I did alter it a bit after reading other reviews.  I will make this many times.  I have used frozen vegetables, cooked them and then put them in the food processer for just a few seconds to chop the vegetables up.

YUMMY! This is such an easy and delicious recipe - I have made it the past 3 weekends and it is well worth the time spent at the cutting board.  The first time I made the batch as noted and the next 2 times I doubled it so we would have leftovers.  I used canned chicken broth instead of bouillon cubes and seasoned with seasoning salt instead of salt & pepper (personal preference).  I have also added diced potatoes and sliced fresh mushrooms to it. I cut back the cheese to 2 cups (4 cups doubled) just to try to be a little health conscience.  If you like creamy cheesy soups, you will probably love this recipe!

This recipe was good. If I really wanted it to be quick I would use frozen veggies. Before adding the milk I used a handheld blender on some of the veggie chunks. I also used about 1/2 tsp of Italian seasoning along with the parsley. I thought the recipe called for too much flour. I will use less next time. The soup got too thick for my tastes. Overall a good recipe.

This was a very good recipe, but it seemed to lack a little "zip".  Next time I think I will try adding a little Worcester Sauce to give it a little pick up.  Also I found that there was a bit of a floury aftertaste, so I think that I will either cut down on the flour or substitute corn starch.

Great recipe and you can play with some of the ingredients. Cauliflower was too $$ this week so I doubled up on the broccoli. I also added a bit more red pepper for color.

I use this basic recipe all the time and it's great. I usually mix 1/2 chicken broth with the bouillon and water. I mash the veggies in the pot with a potato masher for a chunkier soup and we really like it that way. Most of the time I just use a big bag of frozen broccoli & cauliflower, great when the fresh veg is getting low. Right now we have a lot of zucchini in the garden, so I used that and worked great. Added shredded chicken and cooked rice at the very end, it was very hearty! I serve with cheddar biscuits. Yummo.

This soup was good, and it reminded me of some of the broccoli and cheese soups on this site that I've made and prefer more. The difference is the extra veggies added here. I did not have cauliflower so I left that out. Since I scaled this down a bit, I sauteed a good handful of frozen mixed peppers and onions. I also added some jarred garlic. Many reviews mentioned cutting the amount of cheese in half, which I did, and that was a good call. I used evaporated milk, and it worked well. I thought it needed extra flavor, so I gave it a few shakes of hot sauce.

Yum, of course I made some adjustments because I can't leave well enough alone.  I added potato, cause it isn't chowder without spuds, no red pepper as I didn't have any and used broth instead of bouillon.  It was a bit bland so I added garlic.  Yum, great base recipe, will make again.

I’ve had to double the amount that I make of this soup. I am begged regularly to make this soup and it is always gone before I can save any for leftovers and lunch. I make this as an entirely vegetarian soup by changing the broth and the bullion. And it’s perfect.

Like several others I cleaned out the fridge. I added book Chou too. I also added garlic, increased the water, used broth vs cubes and a little hot sauce. Excellent Sunday supper!      Another Tall Mom

Made it as written except I only used about half of the cheese and I didn't have any parsley. I actually needed to thin it a bit after adding the cheese.  Lovely texture, hearty & comforting soup.

This is pretty good and very easy.  I halved the recipe and made a few changes. The most important is that I reduced the amount of cheese by half or more and put some on the table to sprinkle on at the end. With less cheese, the flavor of the vegetables is nice (I also added some frozen green beans, corn, and peas) but the soup is rather bland. I added some basil while sautéing the onion and pepper but it definitely needed more of something. I recommend putting in a lot less flour (half?) and boiling the vegetables for 10 minutes or less (I did 10 min and my bite-sized broccoli was mush).

My hubby said "This is good".  I almost fell off my chair as he never says "good", everything usually gets an "OK".  We added shredded cooked chicken and hubby wanted less chees put in it so I only put about a cup.

Excellent! Doubled all veggies , added mushrooms and one additional cup broth. Cut cheese to 2 cups. Was delicious and comforting. Also I used low-fat milk to lighten it up.

This was so amazing!!!  I didn’t have bell pepper, celery or parsley so I did not have them in the soup; however, I used leftover broccoli, carrots & cauliflower that already had a little butter on it, so I didn’t add margarine to the soup.  I used 1/3 cup flour & blended it with the broth using an immersion blender.  I puréed half the veggies with the flour/broth mixture and added a tsp of garlic powder to the purée before dumping it in my crock pot with the remaining vegetables.  I added 3 TBSP minced onion, pepper, milk and 2 cups cheddar (instead of 3 cups, as it was plenty cheesy already) to the broth mixture and stirred until ingredients were evenly mixed.  I cooked on low for 4 hours ...this was absolutely fantastic on a very cold day!

This was a great,  satisfying dinner. The only thing I would suggest is adding some crushed garlic at the end of the vegetable saute, but overall it is a wonderful soup that can tolerate a lot of variations in vegetables, which means I can use whatever I have in my fridge! Thanks for the recipe!  It will become a staple in our house.

I wish I had read the reviews first but I was in a hurry, so I made as written.  WAY too much cheese, and I really like cheese!  I would cut in half, or just leave it out and sprinkle the cheese on top.

Great!  Broccoli was not looking so great today at the store so I used more green cauliflower and some cabbage.  I also put the cheese on the top at the end it didn't need much. We added some spice.  Yum a keeper!

Used 2 diced red potatoes and 1/4 c flour instead of 1/2 c flour.   Because of this it could have used a bit more water or broth.  Didn't have cauliflower.  No complaints from the diners!

It was great! Even my vegetable loather ate it. 
I didn't have broccoli so I used more cauliflower. I also added a dash of nutmeg because I like nutmeg on cauliflower. A very hearty vegetable soup.

I make this a lot.. at least once a month. it's so delicious. I add extra of everything so there are a lot of left overs. I follow everything exactly other than using canned broth and adding a couple small potatoes and a little extra broth for them. Mmmm!

Loved this soup and have shared it with three other people who also loved it.  I made some changes as suggested by other reviews;   Used 61 ounces of chicken broth ( 1 quart & 2 cans), only used 1/4 cup flour added with the milk and 2 cups shredded cheddar cheese.  I did not want a really thick soup (personal preference), however if you love cheese, 3 cups would not thicken it that much.  I also added some asparagus tips.  I will add a few strips of bacon next time.  The beauty of this recipe is that you can add any vegetable you like, although keep the broccoli and cauliflower as this the heart of soup!

Really loved it! Served the cheese on the side for those who wanted it, as some family members don't care for cheese cooked in this manner. Cooked mushrooms on the side, and added them at the end of cooking. Varied the veggies a little in accordance with what I had on hand, but I think that any veggies would be good. I added a little dried thyme, but think that spices could be as desired.

My family loves veggies, but this didn't go over well at all. The veggies turned out mushy and it was way too much cheese.

I love this recipe as does my family. I made it tonight and tripled it to give some away to a sick friend. You can adjust the vegetables to your family's tastes but do not omit the red bell pepper as it really makes the soup.

I've made this about 8 times now, and it couldn't be easier. Great for throwing in any veggies that are wasting away in the refrigerator. Celery root and parsnips are a favorite of ours, along with quite a bit of cauliflower. This soup always turns out great. We think it would be good with cubed ham, but haven't tried it. A healthy, hearty meal in a bowl!

omitted the cheese as it was creamy enough without the cheese. Used double the carrots and broccoli as I didn't have celery or cauliflower on hand. added a little bit of bacon.

Great weeknight supper! I followed other reviewers' suggestions and halved the cheese; it worked great, but you should only add it a handful at a time, stir until it melts, and add another handful,... I sauteed the celery with the onion/pepper mixture since I don't like crunchy celery in soup.

I thought this was just alright. I ended up having to add italian spices and pasta to give it something. Also, despite making a double recipe and adding pasta, it only fed 4 ppl as a main dish.

This is a great recipe! I love hot, tasty dishes that also give you a heaping helping of vegetables. This dish tasted great and the chowder had an excellent consistency. For my three cups of cheese I used a cup of regular cheddar and two cups of extra sharp cheddar. Note that the quality of the cheese that you use will have a big effect on the taste of the finished product. I use a decent quality Cabot sharp cheddar and the results are fantastic. My prep time was substantially more than the 15 minutes estimated by the recipe, but the results were so good that this recipe will definitely be repeated!

This was so good! Very rich. I used homemade vegetable broth instead of the bouillon cubes, and I also substituted corn (frozen) and zucchini for the celery and cauliflower, as I just didn't have those on hand. Great cold weather meal! Thanks :-)

This was so good.  I used 2 cups of chicken broth instead of the water and boullion.  I also didn't have any broccoli on hand so I added extra cauliflower.  I cut the cheese back to 2 cups and it was perfect.  My husband suggested adding crab meat to it next time.  I may have to try it.

I love this chowder. The first time I made it I followed the exact recipe, but now instead of cutting up vegetables I use different Trader Joe organic frozen veggies-whatever combo I have-even asparagus. I only use 2 cups of cheese.

Good recipe!  I was working with what I had in my fridge, and so omitted the pepper and cauliflower, but added some shredded cabbage and frozen corn.  I also reduced the cheese by half.  Very yummy!

Delicious!   I followed the recipe pretty closely.  But I used a yellow bell pepper instead of red, and since I didn't have any celery, I just added extra broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots to compensate.   I actually used a pre-packaged bag of broccoli & cauliflower florets from Trader Joe's, so it was really easy.  Based on other reviews, I didn't even chop them smaller and they cooked down great (I did poke them a bit with a spoon towards the end to "help" them integrate more with the soup).   I forgot to add parsley, and I just eyeballed the cheese (shredded a big pile of it and threw it in at the end).   It tasted pretty good without the cheese too, so I like that flexibility of the recipe.   My husband and I both loved it.  The kids (they are 4 1/2 and 2) only ate a few bites, so that's why I only gave it 4 stars and not 5.  My son actually said he liked it, so there's still hope (maybe he just wasn't very hungry tonight!).

Great soup!  I cut the broccoli and cauliflower fairly coarse because I like chunky soup, and they still cooked down to almost nothing... next time I will chop even coarser.  Soup tasted great and was the right consistency without using a blender!

This was a nice, simple chowder. Not bursting with flavor, but a quick meal when you want to make something quick and healthy. I did take the suggestion of others and add corn. I can't imagine the soup without it! I also used less broth and milk than required to make the soup thicker.

Fantastic recipe! I followed the standard recipe and added two jalapeno peppers and a bunch of green onions and simmered only for 15 minutes so that the vegetables wouldn't get too soft and man, oh, man it's GOOOOD!

I love this chowder!  I have made it every Sunday for several weeks.  My husband and I take it took work for lunch all week long.
It is so easy and really delicious.  My hubby thought it tasted like "restaurant quality" soup.  I mix in lots of different veggies and it is always great!

This was absolutely incredible.  I passed it on to my sister who made it for all the teachers at her school, they couldn't stop raving about.  All the teachers now use this website!

This soup is excellent!   The hardest part was cutting up the vegetables:)

Great chowder!

I made some substitutions to lower the fat/calories, for personal preference, and in honor of my grandmother.

Light butter, 1% milk, 2 cups of 2% cheddar to lighten it.

2 cans of fat-free chicken stock in place of the boullion cubes and water--that's just personal preference.

And I always use white pepper in cream sauces because that is what my grandmother taught me to do.  It's just a little bit hotter, not much, and I don't get black specks.

Thanks, R.A.  We'll make this often.

Excellent recipe!  Before adding the cheese we blended the soup with a hand blender until it was smooth and the vegetables were pureed.  Then added the cheese until melted and voila!  Amazing!

I made this recipe and my family just loved it.  It was really delicious and I will definitely make it again.  I did alter one thing - I used olive oil instead of margarine.

AWESOME!  Wonderful flavor and texture.  I followed the recipe as listed except I added a can of whole kernel corn (drained) and we all thought it was great.  Thanks!!

What a great recipe!  Of course, I had to tinker with it a bit... used reduced-fat shredded cheddar cheese and skim milk.  Also used the veggie broth option instead of chicken.  We had a pound of Seafood Mix (Trader Joe's brand) defrosted so I microwaved that, let it cool overnight, rinsed and drained.  Added to chowder near the end of the cooking time.  Ended up with a Seafood Chowder, of course, but the basic recipe was such a great way to start.  We had the leftovers for lunch the next day and I believe it was even better the second day!

Awe-sommmmme!  I altered it a bit by using 2 cans of chicken broth instead of boullion, omit salt, and use 1/2 milk and 1/2 light cream for the milk.  Only used 2 cups of cheese which was PLENTY!  I also pureed half the soup in a blender like someone else suggested before adding the milk and cheese.  My dh ate 3 bowls the first night I made it! Delish!
