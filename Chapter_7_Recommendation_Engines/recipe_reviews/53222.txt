Loved it!  It was a hit with the guests too.  I added some cinnamon and served it with sprinkled powdered sugar.  I will  make this again (and again, and again).

Wasn't sure about the cinnamon in the write up, so I added 1 tsp.  I wish I knew how much 1# of grated sweet potatoes was in cup measurement; I think that should have been stated.  The pancakes had great taste, but with the amount of sweet potatoes I used, they came apart when flipping them--the top layer separated off the rest of the pancake!

Use half as much curry-- the taste was way too intense. Also, a teaspoon and a half of cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg make it a bit sweeter.

I like sweet potatoes, and I like potato pancakes, but this was too greasy and had way too much curry. Smelled nice though, and my toddler liked having a few bites, so that's something.

I thought I would really love this recipe and found it to be only OK. There was nothing to drain from the potatoes after 10 min per directions. I added a little cinnamon and that worked just fine. I might try them again and serve topped with applesauce. I served with a dollop of FF sour cream and it also made them tastier.

Fantastic.  We are big sweet potato fans, so we really loved this recipe.  Will definitely make these again.

very nice,besides using sweet potato as anlternative to white potatoes, spices added subtle flavor.wondering about cinnamon amount omission, probably 1 tap. cinnamon is pretty stong spice. as for oil, used teflon coated pan and just brushed heated pan with oil.  1/2 cup seems too much.

Our pancakes came out soggy and really greasy, and didn't hold together well. It would have been good to have some info as to how long to cook them on each side, and how to tell whether the oil was hot enough. Tasted fine (note: we substituted mustard, cinnamon, cayenne, and cloves for curry powder), but the texture was not great. We won't be trying this recipe again.

These were delicious! I added salt to the batter and used cinnamon instead of the curry. Will definitely make these again!

Loved it overall...I just found it a little heavy on the "batter" for the amount of sweet potato, so I added a little more potato.  Also, I liked it better with a little salt added.

Flavor is 5 stars, but I found labor intense to make for a crowd.
I had to keep adding more flour and they were stil falling apart. 
My husband who loathes sweet potatoes, ate these.

It was fabulous.  I added a bit of shredded apple.  I tried it again using half potatoes and half sweet potatoes.  I added just a little Cajun seasoning and none of the sweet ingredients.  The family loved it.
