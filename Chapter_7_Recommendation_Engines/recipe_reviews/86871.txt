Tasty, but a little dry.  I think if you added some grape tomatoes sliced in half it would add a little more liquid and a slightly different flavor that would push it over the edge to great.  I'll definitely try it again with that addition.  Thanks for the recipe!  ETA:  I made this again and added tomatoes.  Really perfect.  Also, I've made it once with broccoli and once with broccolini.  My vote is that the broccolini is fine, but don't bother going out of your way if  you can't easily find it.  The broccoli was also quite good.  With tomatoes added, I'd consider this a 5 star recipe.

This recipe is amazing!  I susbstituted turkey bacon for the regular to decrease the fat, and I prefer the bacon crispier.  I added 1T. of extra virgin olive oit to the skillet once the pasta was tossed.  I didn't have broccolini, but using broccoli florets was just fine.  I think fresh garlic is the taste key here- although jarred is more convenient, the fresh gives the dish the needed zing.  I make this weekly now- wonderful!

This recipe was a hit!  My fiance couldn't believe all the flavors that came from something with so few ingredients.  The only alteration I made was in adding some olive oil at the end because it did come out dry...however, I halved the recipe for 2 people and that could have been the culprit.  Will definitely use this recipe again.

Yummy.  I used sweet italian sausage instead of bacon.  I also cooked the broccolini with the pasta (added it in when the pasta was close to being done).  A few red pepper flakes and a little extra olive oil make this a tasty and easy meal.

Fabulous and simple! Save time by using jarred minced garlic. I used bacon and bacon drippings (only amounted to about 1 1/2 tablespoons of fat)...was a bit dry at the end so I drizzled some good extra virgin olive oil over it and tossed as direction instruct just before adding the bacon back in. I also had to cook the broccolini longer than directions stated...actually I covered with a lid and sort of steamed it for about 5 minutes in addition to the original cook time. If you LOVE garlic--don't be afraid to add even more!  Bon appetit! Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

This was a pretty good recipe. Of course, using bacon fat as a base for the sauce doesn't really work well in a healthy endeavor. I used broccoli instead of broccolini. I also added 1/4 c of chicken broth for flavor and to cut down on the fat. One last change - I added shrimp for protein. Easy to make and quick when you don't have anything else planned.

What a DELICIOUS pasta recipe!!  Very easy to make.  I did use veggie sausage and olive oil instead of the bacon and that was good.  The broccolini was tasty and the garlic added a nice punch to the whole dish.  I will be making this recipe often!

Pasta just how I like it, and just as it should be - a few, quality ingredients, lightly dressed and not bogged down with an overload of herbs and spices. Because there are so few ingredients, use the best if you can - good quality pasta, fresh broccolini, and Parmigiano-Reggiano.

Family loved it. Increase bacon to 12 pieces, used turkey bacon.  Sauteed all 12 garlic cloves in the turkey drippings along w/ EVOO. Added the brocollini (have made w/ brocolli and "lini" and lini is MUCH better) also wilted 3 large handfuls of spinach and added all of this to whole grain penne along w/ halved cherry tomatoes, more EVOO, more parmesan cheese and I oven fried chicken breasts and sliced and add on top and tossed it all together. Great healthy dinner easy to make and is good at room temp.

4 because it does need more olive oil regardless of if you use the bacon fat or just oil.  Something needs to dampen the pasta.  Also- its important to understand that broccoli and broccolini are not even close to the same thing.  The tastes are completely different...so if you are using plain broccoli- you are not getting the true taste of the recipe.  Broccolini is bitter-and its one of those love or hate relationships.  I steam the broccolini a bit- heat tons of garlic up in olive about 1/4 cup oilve oil (I cook three bunches at a time) add salt to your taste and let simmer 5 minutes.  Then serve over pasta with a nice amount of parmesean cheese...along with a crunchy baguette! I could eat this everynight. Even yummier the next day for lunch!

I made this on the fly for a dinner party. I doubled the recipe, when there was only 7 people, and there were no leftovers to speak of!!
I added a few more pieces of bacon, and also added about a half pint of cream. The grape tomatoes were a fantastic idea too! I served with some warmed french bread, and a caesar salad. This has become a weekly dinner for my boyfriend and me!! Well done!!

This was a good recipe. I used broccoli and found it to be dry once the broccoli went in (I made the bacon in a cast iron pan, which could be the reason), so I had to add more olive oil, and water. I also cooked the garlic for less time to prevent burning, and I used lower salt bacon. The family really enjoyed it. Thanks for posting, I will be making this one again.

Substituted pancetta  for the bacon.  Have to watch the garlic carefully, otherwise it browns and becomes bitter.  Also needed some extra liquid at the end - I used fat-free half/half.

I didn't read other reviews before making this, but I could see when I cooked the broccoli (instead of broccolini) that the bacon grease was being absorbed. I added olive oil to both the broccoli and the finished dish and added extra cheese, but there is something missing. There needs to be more of a sauce for the pasta. It was good, but I've made carbonara before with a better recipe, so I wouldn't feel the need to make this again.

This is amazing! But I'll admit I changed up the quantities slightly. We like our pasta with lots of punch in every bite so I added more bacon and broccoli and cooked only 2/3 the amount of penne. I diced 10 slices of bacon and then cooked until crisp (I discarded about half the grease so as not to drench my pasta in bacon grease). I used 1 1/2 crowns broccoli chopped into florets. Also used 15 grape tomotoes halved (as someone else recommended) and only 9 cloves of garlic. Topped off with about 2/3 cup of parmesan. It could've used more broccoli and tomatoes but it was delicious nonetheless. Hubby loved it! Will definitely make again. Note: I originally added only 6 cloves of garlic but then couldn't even taste it. I added 3 more at the end and it was pretty powerful, but delicious.

I was a bit disappointed.  The recipe looked so yummy - and my family loves broccoli, pasta, bacon, garlic and parmesean.  I just have to say, like many others, this recipe ends up quite dry.  I have to admit I used whole wheat pasta, but I even added some EVOO and it still was very dry.  The flavors were good but overall it just didn't hit the spot like I had hoped.  I might try it one more time with some grape tomatoes like other posters have suggested.  Thanks.

We love pasta dishes that aren't sauce laiden - This is a nice light pasta dish and healthy with the broccoli!  The tomatoes make it moist enough. Even the little kids loved it.  Definitely a keeper!

Without a doubt this is now one of my favorites and I can't wait to make it for guests.  We just finished devouring this and we all agree.....we would rather eat this at home than go to Olive Garden.  I used a little extra garlic and used precooked bacon, so I was liberal with olive oil.  I may sprinkle a few flakes of crushed red pepper on this next time, if it stays in the pan long enough!!

I skipped the bacon and just cooked the broccoli in a tbs of olive oil with some garlic, and that flavor + the parmesan cheese was plenty!  No need for the extra calories :)  I served this with Chicken Milano from this site instead of the fettuccini (cuts a lot of calories but still tons of taste).

This wasn't bad, it just wasn't overly good.  But it did make the house smell wonderful.  If you like pasta with sauce, this definately isn't for you.  Because there isn't much sauce and it's a little bland.  Good garlic flavor, but bland on the whole.

I love trying healthy dinners and this was a good one! Simple, quick, and tasty. I used turkey bacon and a little extra olive oil. Yum!

This was excellent; although I halved the recipe as I prepared it for 2 people. Next time I will try it with a mix of turkey and regular bacon since it is really high in fat. I think I will sprinkle some chopped green onions on top at the end too. We love broccolini and this was a great, unique way to prepare it. (Make sure you use REAL parmesan...it's the best!)

Just made this for the first time tonight and we loved it.  Read the other reviews about it being dry but it's not supposed to have a sauce.  Only change I made was to add scallops.  Will definitely be making this again. My picky kids actually asked me to!

A little too greasy for my liking, but tasted good. I probably won't make it too much because of the grease. I have a similar (but lighter) recipe that I like more but if I want something heavier I may  pull this out every now and then.

This pasta was great.  I used spiral pasta and made enough for 2 people.  I didn't measure any of the ingredients just made it by hand and taste.  I kept on adding the bacon drippings until it made it nice and easy to pass.  And added roma tomatoes to this pasta and instead of salt added just a bit of garlic salt n pepper.  Made this as a side dish to top sirloin steak made on the grill.

This really was great! Super garlicky! I got rid of about half the bacon grease as it was quite a lot. I also added some cherry tomatoes as per some of the suggestions and some basil at the end.   Zucchini and red pepper would probably be really nice too!

My husband thought this was exceptionally outstanding.  I was okay with it.  I like creamier pasta dishes.  Since it was somewhat a dry pasta, I decided to use mizithra cheese instead of parmesan.  I think that added much to the dish

This was great! But if you want a healthier option, cook the dish with extra virgin olive oil and replace the bacon with sausage or boneless chicken.

I really can't believe how good and easy this was. I did indeed use olive oil instead of bacon fat. Made my whole house smell amazing. Next time, I think I will pair it with a nice spinach pizza :)

This was very good. My only complaint is that it turned out a bit dry. I added a little bit of butter to the serving on my plate and that did the trick. Very good flavor though.

I have recently fallen in love with broccolini and look for recipes where I can include this healthy vegetable easily. This recipes is a perfect example. I followed directions exactly, but on the suggestion of others, added 1 14 oz can of diced tomatoes. This resulted in a touch of color, taste, and more nutrition. We loved this dish and will add it to our favorites. Thank You!

So great!  I added quite a bit to this recipe and I dont remember it all because I waited too long to rate it (my bad) I know I added artichoke hearts, small cherry tomatoes, mor bacon and probably more garlic if i know myself. I will be making again and it was fun to have the kids help.

Made this recipe today and it was well received in my house. Made some of changes suggested. I did use the bacon and along with the first 1/2 of the garlic I loosely  chopped some fresh mushrooms and sauted  them. I also added some halved cherry tomatoes . Tossed some parmasean cheese and more olive oil. Will make again

This was just ok as written.  Like other reviewers said, there is no sauce to speak of- it is dry as a bone.  I also felt that there was too much pasta compared to what I had in the skillet to toss it with.  I have since made the following changes:
I add onions, mushrooms, roasted red peppers and halved cherry tomatoes (at the end), as well as some torn fresh basil and a sprinkle of red pepper flakes.  I use less pasta, and for the sauce, I add about 1/3 cup of Garlic and Herb Boursin cheese and chicken broth to the skillet until I get the desired consistency.  With these changes, it is delicious.

I made this for my husband and I with regular broccoli and added a diced roma tomato.  Since he isn't a big garlic fan I only added two cloves, but I think next time I'll add three.  It was a little dry so I just added a tablespoon or two of oil.  I also added more like a handful of shredded parmesan cheese.  Husband said he rated it somewhere between "make again" and "make a lot".

My husband loved this dish - almost lick the plate loved it!  I did make a few additions - I did add the tomatoes, added some chopped onion, and threw in a little basil.  Once I tasted it, I thought that a splash (not much) of lemon juice might be good as well.  I will make this again for sure!

My husband and I really loved this recipe.  I will make it again, but I would prefer more than 6 slices of bacon.  I'll probably try 9 slices as the bacon flavor is such a great compliment to the garlic!  We also used cherry tomatoes. They were better hot than cold.  The fresh parmesan really pulled it together.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Yummy!!Everybody love this and ate this fast,at my house and were asking for seconds!!I didn't know what broccolini was but i am guessing it might be what we call tenderstem here in the UK.I did the recipe slightly different, I added some cherry tomatoes and pancetta instead of bacon (about 3 cups of pre-cut ,cubed)and i used a broccoli floret and added an onion aswell.

Love this. Even with the bacon, this is light, but filling. I started eating it and forgot the parmesan! Added it later and it was good either way. Thanks for the quick and easy meal!

I used Italian turkey sausage instead of bacon, whole wheat pasta, and broccoli.  Broccolini was $4.99 for a small package at my organic grocery store so I decided to pass on it.  

I thought the flavor was o.k, but it was dry even with olive oil.  I think using this recipes as a side dish, and adding some tomato would make it more appealing.  I would make again because it is so easy and fast.

I loved this recipe.  I substituted turkey bacon and add about a tablespoon of olive oil when sauteing the garlic and broccoli.  I also added another tbls at the end when I mixed in the pasta.  It turned out great, and I had leftovers for lunch for the next few days!

Used broccoli since the local store in my little town did not have broccolini. I used mini penne also for the first time - which I liked. This is a good recipe, very light, healthy (if you ignore the bacon and bacon fat) and good 'n garlicky. I will make it again.

Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe. Scales down well using half the pasta, 3 tbs bacon fat, 4 slices bacon, and dash of crushed red pepper to taste.  Will add halved cherry tomatoes next time.

Just made this for the 1st time...outstanding! I used already cut up and washed broccoli from a bag and added crushed red pepper flakes. I also cooked the broccoli with the penne for the last 5 minutes. It turned out great. Will definitely make again and again!!

This was surprisingly very quick, easy, and tasty for having no added sauce. I used farfalle pasta and added some chopped red bell pepper but I didn't add salt or pepper. The bacon and garlic was enough flavor for me :)

Used turkey bacon (and added some olive oil, because of the lack of grease before cooking the broccoli) then added a can of italian diced tomatoes and simmered the broccoli a few minutes.  Good flavor, kids liked it.

I don't know where I went wrong, but mine did not turn out to be the nice smokey, garlicky creation I had in mind. Instead it was a bowl of greasy pasta with broccoli and cheese that didn't taste like much of anything.

We didn't have broccolini, so we used broccoli, but this was really good.  We often make pasta with butter, salt, & parmesan cheese.  This was a nice way to change it up a little bit.

This was really delicious and easy to make. I also added in some sweet Italian sausage and shredded mozzarella, and it added great flavor. The other reviewers are correct. The recipe would definitely be too dry without adding olive oil. Simply added it to the pan when adding in broccoli.

Great and easy dinner for sure!  I was just looking for a "meat less" dinner recipe, and while I couldn't resist adding the bacon to this dish, this fit the bill perfectly.  I did need to add 1 teaspoon of olive oil just before adding the pasta to the rest of the ingredients, however that may be because I scaled down the recipe for 2, and there must have been less bacon grease to work with.  Highly recommend for a great light dinner!

This had a good taste but even with three tomatoes chopped up it was dry.  I think it would be better with a white sauce and the tomatoes.

Quick, easy recipe.  I prefer to add more garlic and not add the cheese as I found the flavor overwhelming. Also used turkey bacon instead of regular bacon.  Definitely a keeper.

Oh wow, was this tasty! I must admit, I was a little skeptical when I first came across this recipe. I wasn't sure how all those flavors would go together, but I loved it! Yes, it's probably not the healthiest thing in the world (although don't the broccoli and garlic cancel out the bacon?) but as they say, fat is flavor! YUM!!  P.S. I had a pinot noir with mine, complemented the dish well I thought.

I loved it, I used broccoli florets because that is what I had on hand, and added a little extra high quality EVOO like others suggested. Even my super picky 2 year old had a second helping of broccoli! Will be making again.

I ended up altering this recipe due to lack of ingredients. I did not have enough fresh garlic, so I added shallots and what garlic I had.  I also decided to add tomatoes, not having fresh I chose to use dried tomatoes. I love the flavor of them.  I then worried that it would be dry so I used some white wine that I had on hand. We definitely enjoyed it and will have this again with the garlic that I love!

Yummy! This was great. I used frozen baby cut broccoli and added a dash of lemon juice, but otherwise followed the recipe. Would be great as a main course with some diced chicken or turkey sausage added.

This recipe is so simple to make and with only a few ingredients, this has tons of flavor.  If you love garlic, you will love this dish! The first time I made this, I didn't have any cheese and it still tasted great!  I added a couple extra slices of bacon.  I used center cut bacon for less fat. A+

I made this according to the directions, only switching the pasta to rotini (all I had).  It was ok, but needs something. I also had to add some oil since it was pretty dry.  It was edible, but if I make it again, i'll have to make some revisions.  Just needs something more.

I added grape tomatoes, used steamed broccoli, added some red pepper flakes and black olives. We heart bacon, so I used about 9 slices.  Added a little EVOO to make it a little less dry.  I added the tomatoes to the garlic & oil before adding it to pasta and the sweetness really came out and it was great with the garlic and olives.

This was pretty good.  I substituted mild turkey sausage for the bacon, because we did not have any, and added a few shakes of red pepper flakes, and a splash of chicken broth to moisten it up.  It was yummy.

I am going to give this a 4 because I think if I would have used bacon, it would have been a 4.  Using olive oil I give it a 3.  It was very bland, I even added tomatoes, TONS of salt, and italian seasoning.  It was just missing something (very likely the bacon!).  But I just hate to cook bacon, so I will tweak this until I am happy.

I used wheat Penne and turkey bacon to make this a little lighter.  I did end up adding a little of olive oil to saute the garlic since the turkey bacon left very little oil in the pan.

Great recipe. I added grape tomatoes and had to use broccoli florets and parmesan, romano and asiago blend because that's what I had on hand. It was really easy, fast and very tasty. Thanks for the recipe.

I made this dish with Turkey bacon rather than pork bacon and regular broccoli instead of broccolini, as my supermarket did not have broccolini.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe.  The dish looks and smells fantastic.  However, my husband and I thought it was so-so and my daughter refused to eat it.  There isn't enough sauce on it and it is just bland - a waste of yummy turkey bacon.  This may taste better wth white wine.  I have not tried it this way, however.

As a base i thought the recipe was kinda plain...so i added alot of different things...like grape tomatoes and and two other cheeses beside the parmasean...I had alittle ricotta cheese and mozzerela in the fridge and threw that in there along with a dash of cut of cilantro and black olives ..and it came out much tastier I think...Have fun with it and put in what you think would taste good...then again i never stick to the recipe completly i always do something different because alot of these recipes are a good start but need alot more...YUMMMO

I actually substituted green beans since my broccoli had gone rubbery on me & it wad delicious. My husband hates green beans if they're not in a stew but he loved this since the penne & the bacon added great flavors & some extra texture to go with the beans. Highly recommend trying this!

Oh, boy.  First of all five stars to whoever named this dish...the word Garlicky is music to my ears.  Five stars to whoever posted the picture... it made my mouth water.  Finally, five stars for the actual recipe... Awesome!!  I used regular broccoli and have to admit I felt guilty using all of that bacon grease so I actually used less than half and replaced what I dumped out with olive oil.  I don't think it mattered anyhow because it was still so yummy!  I followed other reviewers suggestions and added cherry tomatos.  Two adults and three kids rate this a whole lot more than FIVE stars!!!  If you love pasta and garlic this is a recipe for you.  As for those who said it was too dry... I don't know what they are talking about.

This dish was so easy to make. I will be making this again soon in the near future. Next time I will add cherry tomatoes as well.

YUMMY!! I used around 12 ounces of dry orzo (we were out of penne and rotini!), 9 slices of bacon, around ½ pound fresh broccoli, 7 largish cloves of garlic, around 4 ounces of button mushrooms (sliced), and the salt, pepper, and Parmesan. I cooked the bacon, drained off half the grease since I used three extra slices, and cooked half the garlic and the mushrooms in the remaining grease and then followed the rest of step three. It was soooo good with mushrooms! An excellent recipe and I loved it with orzo! Our four-year-old scarfed it, even the broccoli (SUCCESS!). It wasn't too dry for us when served fresh, but the leftovers got a little dry when reheated. Oh, well, it still tasted excellent. Thank you so much for sharing, Skilletzilla!

Lovely recipe, however I did make some alterations due to personal preference.  I don't like bacon and had a ton of chicken breast in the fridge so I used that as the meat instead.  I used garlic flavored EVOO to makeup for the lack of fat juice without the bacon.  I also followed others advice and used regular broccoli and added grape tomatoes as well.  Very delicious, my boyfriend raved all night!

This was pretty good! I followed the recipe however, instead of bacon, I used sweet Italian sausage as P41OH suggested. I did add a load of chery tomatoes and extra olive oil. It wasn't dry at all and that allowed me to add a lot more parm. cheese. I will make this again!

I followed the reipe to a "T", but found that the broccoli tasted very garlicky and the noodles were dry. If I made it again, I would cut back on the garlic, even though we love garlic.

This was delicious with a few changes.  I used 8 slices of bacon (by accident) instead of 6.  I also used broccoli since I couldn't find broccolini.  It's important to use good grated parmesan cheese.  I cooked the broccoli a lot longer since my family and I like our broccoli more on the tender side (especially for my 2-yr old).  I did notice that it was a bit on the dry side so I added some EVOO (extra virgin olive oil) and sliced grape tomatoes.  This was really good and everyone in my family loved it and couldn't get enough of it! They couldn't believe the few ingredients that went into this dish and how simple it was to make - this is a definite keeper.  Thanks Skilletzilla for a great recipe!!

I felt this was just OK.  A little dry and not a lot of flavor.  I did use whole wheat pasta and turkey bacon, so maybe that's why.

Instead of Bacon I added chopped bits of turkey sausage about half inch. Used butter and half olive oil, added some basil and rosemary. Topped with chopped fresh tomato's or quartered cherry toms would be good. this added more flavor.

I liked the taste although it was very heavy on the garlic. I felt it was too dry though and needs some type of sauce over it.

I found this addicting.  My family also liked it, but not as passionately as I did.  This was a midweek, no time to shop fill-in recipe, so I used broccoli like others had since I had no broccolini on hand.  I only used a 12 oz package of penne and did not have a dryness problem.  It also gave it a greater veggie to pasta ratio which I like.

This was Ok for me. I might have it again but it really didn't have that much taste to me.
