My hubby loved this! Instead of water I used beef broth (I was out of chicken broth) and used dried cilantro. I served it over rice and had avery happy family :)

This is a great recipe - not too spicy yet full of flavor. I added a few cubed red potatoes and a couple of sliced carrots to make it more of a complete meal.

Meh... not enough spice and too much tomatoes. I would use more green chilies next time and cut up a jalapeno and add it as well when I add the onions and garlic. Needs more zest.

I added potatoes, peas, and carrots b/c that's how I've had guisado before.  Added a bit of chicken broth to help the potatoes cook, but cooked it all off so that the end result was not soupy at all.  Added some Lizano salsa as I love that Costa Rican flavor.   Great dish.  Thanks for posting.

I've been making this basic recipe for many years and we love it.  I've also tried almost all of the variations suggested too.  Sometimes I add carrots and potatoes if I want to stretch it.  But if you have access to fresh or frozen green chiles like we do here in New Mexico I highly recommend them. You wouldn't believe the difference in taste! Muy Bueno!

I really wasn't expecting much from this recipe.  I made it according to the directions but I did add some salt and pepper and cumin to the flour.  That was the only change and I found this to be delicious. I was pleasantly surprised.  I'm adding this to my schedule.

It's a great start.  If you're on a no salt diet it's great.  Next time I'll add salt and pepper to the flour and more salt at the end if needed.  I had two pounds of meat and the only way to brown all of it is to do it a little at a time and take it out.  The recipe should say that.  I also wanted it to be a complete meal so I added frozen corn and a half of a can of drained black beans.  I didn't bother with the corn starch and water but I did add a cup of chicken broth.  With the flour on the meat, the sauce came out just right to serve over rice.  My cilantro is slow to grow this year  and the fricken store was out, so I used the stuff in a tube.  I was surprised.  It worked out just fine.

I made it with a whole lot more green chilies, added hominy and diced red potatoes and used chicken stock instead of water. Pretty darn good.

I followed this recipe exactly, except I added salt towards the end. My picky 12-year old picky eater said this was amazing and wants me to make again :) 
I topped it with mild cheddar and a dollop of sour cream and served with white rice --what a meal! 
I also think this is a mild recipe, my son doesn't really like spicy food so it was perfect and full of flavor! Thanks for sharing!

I also added the potato. I didn't feel the need to use cornstarch to thicken, we like a bit of soup. The soup was so flavorful, we only used half the cheese. I was only feeding 4, so we just 4 chops I had in the freezer. Very tasty,

While the ingredients seemed pleasing enough, I was very underwhelmed with the finished dish. Not enough seasoning for flavor...and I even disregarded the "no-salt" version of the tomatoes and used the regular kind.  I added a 1/2 cup of chicken broth and extra green chiles for more flavor, but it was still missing something.

I added cumin to stew as it cooked the first 45 minutes. I used 1 cup water with a chicken bullion cube to add to corn starch to thicken at the end. Gave a more richer flavor. Delicious.

Wanted a thick and flavorful, complex pork green chile stew and this hit the nail on the head first try. I did make a few changes:

• 1-2 Roma tomatoes, chopped and crushed instead of canned tomatoes
• ~2 C water
• no corn starch
• 1 small potato
• ~1 TBSP chicken bullion paste
•served with a dollop of sour cream, shredded cheese, and a healthy squeeze of lime, fresh chopped tomatoes and cilantro. 

Entire pot gone in one night, even my three kids devoured it. Keeping this recipe!

I liked the recipe but had to add some water to thick while simmering. Also I added Knorr's Chicken Bouillon extra large cube. It didn't have any spices in it. I also used fresh roasted Hatch chili's so that made it spicy.
