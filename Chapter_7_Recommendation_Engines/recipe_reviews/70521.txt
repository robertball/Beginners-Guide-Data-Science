I used 4 tablespoons of lime juice, added 2 cloves of garlic in the saute, used red bell pepper instead of green, used 1 cup of chopped fresh green beans instead of asparagus, omitted the raisins and 2Tbsp oil for the quinoa, and doubled the mushrooms, red pepper, and parsley. It's quite a few variations, but the result was very flavorful and quite healthy! I will certainly make this again, perhaps even with a few more veggies included.

I made this last night and my husband and I loved it.  I did want to make a healthier version so I used 1 teaspoon olive oil to saute the vegetables and shrimp in a non-stick skillet over medium heat and did not add the additional 2 tablespoons of oil at the end.  This shaved off about 100 calories and 10 grams of fat per serving!  I will definitely make this again.

This recipe was delicious and exceptionally healthy.  I didn't have asparagus so I substituted green beans.  I also used fire roasted red peppers (in a jar) in place of the green peppers.  Next time I would add saute some garlic with the olive oil when heating the pan.  We found this to be a wonderful alternative way to prepare quinoa and a must-try for novice quinoa fans. :-)

I made this dish last night and it was really fantastic.  Easy and delicious, and so healthy!  I pack bento lunches for myself so I'm always looking for good recipes to make on the weekend for the upcoming lunches, and this was perfect.  It actually makes 8 cups, so to me it's 8 1-cup servings, which makes the nutritional information very favorable!  The only thing I'd change is that next time I'll put in even more asparagus, because I love asparagus. 

I wanted to note for future cooks that I used frozen pre-cooked shrimp and it was fine.  I also used powdered ginger as I didn't have any fresh, but I used more of it.  I used lime juice out of a bottle, about 1/4 cup seemed the appropriate amount.

This recipe will be a staple, I know!  Thanks for a great way to eat quinoa, a real superfood.

This was VERY good.  I only made a few alterations, but nothing that would jeopardize the recipes integrity, for instance:  I added 3 cloves of garlic (I honestly can't imagine this recipe without garlic), omitted the raisins, used pickled ginger instead of fresh (it's what I had on hand), used a fresh lemon instead of a lime (again what I had on hand, this was a VERY NICE touch), and added a handful of spinach to give it a little more color and nutrition.  It was delicious and healthy.  The best part about this, is that the leftovers can be eaten cold!  I imagine that this would make a great summertime salad due to its fragrant citrus notes and fresh greens.  Thank you for sharing, I WILL make this again, and possibly experiment with different ingredients!

The quinoa with all the veggies and sweet lime flavoring is excellent.  I used red peppers instead of green for extra color, and regular raisins because I didn't have the golden.  The only thing I didn't like was the shrimp had no flavor.  I would grill it separately speared on rosemary kebobs and your favorite seasonings.

I left out the quinoa & lime, used orzo and chicken stock instead. Very good; made twice in one week, once with shrimp, once with tilapia. Delicious both times!

Although I felt this recipe was basically very good, I felt it lacked flavoring and needed spices of some sort. The ginger/lime didn't really give it enough distinctive flavor, and the dish was rather plain. I would experiment using garlic or sesame oil in the future.

This dish was amazing!  I've been looking for a good quinoa recipe and this one is it.  I didn't have the raisins so left those out but it still tasted fantastic.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This recipe provided a great backbone for a delicious dinner. I made a few substitutions, based on what I had in the house (chicken for the shrimp, yellow bell pepper for the asparagus) and added a red chili, garlic and a handful of spinach. A great introduction to quinoa!!

I made the recipe for the first time and I followed the directions exactly.  I had high hopes since the recipe contained many of my very favorite ingredients, but as a hot dish, found it very bland and unappealing.  There were lots of leftovers and the second day we liked it a little better as a cold dish.  Today I'll try stuffing pita bread with the cold salad to see if that is a little better.  For the time it takes to make this, I'm not sure I'll make it again.  I might add I'm not a big fan of quinoa or couscous...it's a texture thing, but I wanted to try.  Maybe brown rice would be better, and adding garlic might help too.  My personal opinion is that the recipe definitely needs tweaking.

Good, but added twice the green pepper, mushrooms and green beans (instead of asparagus), added 4 cloves of garlic - minced, and 1 tsp of hot sauce

Everybody in my family love it. I put red peppers instead of green peppers and since I love spicy food, I add a bit of pepper flakes. It was simply awesome.

First time trying quinoa & now no one in my house wants to eat it again. the quinoa with the raisins, salt and pepper were excellent, but the rest appeared to have too many conflicting flavors.  Sent husband to work w/the cold leftovers, hoping they'd taste better (like the description advises "cold") and he called from work and said, "Please don't ever make this again." politely, but hungrilly!   followed recipe to the "T" except we didn't have any fresh mushrooms, so we ommitted. Taste: bitter, sweet, salty, bland, fishy (from the shrimp).

Very, Very good.  I did not have asparagus so I used the last of my harvest of green beans from the garden.  I used regular raisins and rehydrated mushrooms since I did not have fresh.  I did not have any parsley either.  Bummer!  Would have been great.

Great Recipe for quinoa and asparagus as a side dish.  I am mildly allergic to shrimp, so don't cook with it much, but we enjoy quinoa and asparagus and this is a good way to cook them together! I substituted dried cranberries for the raisins and cilantro for the parsley (you gotta cook with what you have!) and it was tasty!

This is a dish with excellent flavors! I cooked 1 cup quinoa with 2 cups water in my rice cooker. I also added a couple cloves of minced garlic, and doubled the mushrooms and peppers, and added a package of halved grape tomatoes. I used about 1/4 cup of lime juice. I plan to make it again adding more chopped fresh vegetables such as zucchini and yellow summer squash.

This is the perfect light and fresh summer meal. I am always looking for new quinoa recipes and this one is a keeper. Like other reviewers, I did not use the extra 2 tablespoons of olive oil, you don't need it and we didn't miss the extra fat. I also added a little cayenne pepper and used an extra lime. Next time I will use a little more ginger.

Y.U.M.M.Y.!!!  Only used 1 tbsp of olive oil and added garlic (like I do to everything) in the sautee and this was amazing!  You can do so much with this recipe.

This was my first experience with Quinoa.  I added 3 Tbs of ginger in addition to the Tbs of raw.  didn't taste the lime juice at all so will add more.  Replaced the raisins with orange inspired cranberries.

Very good dish.   I believe that previous reviews calling the dish "bitter" was due to inexperience in cooking quinoa.  Quinoa needs to be rinsed thoroughly to remove the outer layer of saponin.  If the saponin is not rinsed off then the dish becomes bitter.  I cooked this dish with sauteed garlic and extra veggies.  More salt needed to be added to compensate for the extra veggies.  Next time, instead of adding extra salt, I'll boil the quinoa with a cup of chicken stock.  Very filling and extremely healthy eating!

This was absolutely delicious! Even my husband, who was very skeptical of eating Quinoa LOVED it!!! I sauted some garlic first then added the onions, etc... and I subbed the green pepper for a yellow pepper and craisins instead of raisins... DELISH!!!

Excellent!  I was short on quinoa so I combined half a cup of brown rice to the skillet.  Skipped the raisins, used powdered ginger and omitted the additional oil.  Delicious!

Delicious quinoa recipe! Don't be turned off by the raisins, they make an excellent addition and I may even add more next time. I made the following changes....double the mushrooms and asparagus and didn't add olive oil to the quinoa. Will definitely make again, and this recipe can easily be altered with different vegetables.

DELICIOUS!!! Before I made this I read over a bunch of the reviews and tweaked it according to what I thought would better fit my taste and the dish. I cooked the quinoa with chicken stock instead of water, used a red pepper instead of green, doubled the mushrooms and along with the asparagus I added fresh green beans. When heating the olive oil I added a teaspoon of minced garlic. I used frozen pre-cooked shrimp and a lemon instead of a lime. And don't be afraid to add the raisins, I was skeptical but the melt into the recipe perfectly! My boyfriend who isn't a big fan of quinoa absolutely LOVED it and we both couldn't get enough. I made it twice in one week!

This recipe was fantastic.  Great combination of flavours, quinoa was a great consistency.  I might add a bit more seasoning next time, add a handful of fresh basil or more ginger.  Leftovers worked well as a chilled salad.

I used chicken broth, red pepper, doubled the lime juice, mushrooms and ginger, added a 7 oz can of chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, to give a smokey zing.  Added a cup of honey and a few shots of soy sauce.  It was perfect!

Just finished eating this and everyone thought it was delicious. I cooked the shrimp in garlic and a tad of butter before putting it into the dish. I'm not saying that it tasted any better because of that, it was just what I did. The addition of a lot of freshly grated ginger and lime is genius. Quinoa is becoming a family favourite because of it's great nutritional qualities and this recipe is most definitely a keeper. Thank you.

AMAZING flavor. I wasn't sure about all the onion, but WOW. I used half of a red onion and 2 green onions cut up an sauted. REALLY amazing, and not that oniony taste that I truly despise. This recipe is being added right into my bi-weekly dishes!

Very nice recipe.  I cut the oil. Added fresh garlic, dried cranberries instead of raisins, added more lime (to taste...we love it) and added chopped hot pepper to the red and green sweet peppers, plus a good handful of  chopped kale to increase the healthy benefits. 
Everyone loved it, even my picky kids.

This is my first time making this recipe, having just  discovered quinoa and its amazing nutritional benefits.  I followed the recipe pretty closely, but added 2 cloves minced garlic, doubled the mushrooms and asparagus, omitted the salt, and halved the olive oil.  I also used vegetable broth for the quinoa.  I loved it, but my husband thought it needed more heat.  He suggested some Thai style chili sauce , an excellent addition.  Next time I make this I will saute a chopped jalapeno with the onion and green pepper for more heat.  I will definitely be making this again.

I read all the reviews and was really disappointed with this recipe...fairly bland and the shrimp seemed overpowered by everything else going on.  A good bit of chopping for a recipe that wasn't terrific.  I didn't alter the recipe in any way, so maybe I should've taken some of the other suggestions/alterations offered by other reviewers. Won't make it again.

We gave this 4 stars but only with the addition of red chili pepper flakes. We tasted it without and it needed that spice to compliment the slight sweetness.  Otherwise the recipes "as is" would only be 3.5 stars.

This was good.  I just wish I had had all the ingredients for it.  I didn't have bell peppers so I used celery and and added a very few pickled red peppers for color.  I didn't have fresh ginger so I used crystlized and a little powdered.  I also added 2 cloves of garlic and a bit more asparagus because we like it.

I cooked my quinoa in chicken broth to add a subtle flavor and used a red bellpepper to bring a little sweetness and color to the dish.  I omitted the parsley/cilantro this time so as to have the asparagus and shrimp flavors at the head of the line.  To the plate, I added some Peruvian Aji sauce (http://allrecipes.com/recipe/peruvian-aji-sauce/detail.aspx) as a side dressing.  Wooooooo, Buddy! This was the absolute best quinoa I've ever made. It was an "Out of This World Meal" which earned me the prized and golden Stamp of Approval (SOA) from Mi Gato Loco.

My husband and I loved it.  It's healthy and yummy.  I didnt have mushroom and parsley.  But it was still good. I cooked quinoa in chicken broth instead of plain water.  Also, substituted lime with lemon.

I LOVED this recipe!  It was my first time trying Quinoa, and this recipe will be served in my house frequently.  I made a few changes (since I don't like bell peppers and my husband doesn't like mushrooms): I used sundried tomatoes instead of bell peppers (and used the oil from the tomatoes instead of olive oil), no mushrooms, regular raisins (didn't have golden on hand), and threw in a diced avocado.  It was scrumptious!  I didn't have a fresh lime, so I guestimated 3 tbs of lime juice, which was a bit much, but it was still yummy.  My picky (and self-proclaimed "meatatarian") husband ate 3 bowls!

We are just venturing into more healthful eating -- did not even know what quinoa was too long ago!!  This was good!  I sprinkled the lime juice on at the very end (and put more on the table). I would add more asparagus and ginger next time.

LOVE IT...first I browned and onion and green pepper, remove from the pot.  Rinse quinoa well add to pot along with 1 1/4 cup water  6 oz can of pineapple juice along with 8 oz can of crushed pineapple, and the juice only from a can of mandarin oranges (use the oranges later as a garnish, throw in a handful of raisins and some celery.  For a twist I also added 1/2 cup lentils. !/2 tsp. ginger.  Bring to a boil then reduce heat to a slow simmer for approx. one hour, watch so pot does not go dry you may need to add more water.  I microwaved some shrimp to serve with this YUMMMMY

This was VERY GOOD! I used red bell peppers and also added garlic. And I had some brown rice that I also added. Next time I think I'd prefer to add the parsley to the skillet and omit the lime juice.

Really yummy!  Because of what I had on hand, I made a few changes.....chicken broth for the quinoa, green beans instead of asparagus, red instead of green pepper, regular instead of golden raisins, added some minced garlic, pre-cooked shrimp, lemon instead of lime.....yummy!!  This seems like a lot of changes but they're just minor--really.  I had some warm and cold and liked it both ways.  Yum!

Like everyone else, we are trying to eat healthier.  I followed this recipe exactly, and it was okay, but seemed to be missing something.  My husband and I liked it, and added a dash of tamari sauce at the table. I will make it again, but jazz it up with more asparagus, and maybe some garlic or red pepper flakes as suggested by others.

I have only made quinoa a couple of times and saw this one so decided to give it a try.  The only thing I did differently was used a shallot (no red onion) and unfortunately didn't have asparagus so used carrots instead.  I also added some fresh garlic and opted not to add the olive oil at the end as I didn't think it was needed.  Turned out great...a nice healthy meal!

Made this for dinner tonight after a number of other disappointing experiences with quinoa. My girls don't like mushrooms, so I swapped in black olives, and I didn't have a bell pepper, so I diced up about a half-dozen mini sweet peppers, and I used 1 cup chicken broth +1/2 cup water to cook the quinoa. Otherwise followed the directions exactly, and it was positively delicious. I served it as the main dish for dinner, in bowls on top of a small bed of fresh spinach leaves.

I liked it, but made many changes suggested by other reviewers.  Used 3 cloves garlic.  Doubled all the vegetables.  Used zucchini rather then asparagus (and it worked fine).  I put lime zest in the quinoa rather than the juice for a subtle lime flavour.  Added the lime juice to the veg/shrimp with some Thai sweet chili sauce.  This gave it a  sweet and sour flavour.  Enjoyed the stir-fry over quinoa as a nice change from rice.

I probably should've read some of the reviews before making this, but thought I'd go in with no preconceived ideas since the ingredients looked so appealing. Served it chilled slightly & thought it was good, but as in Martha Miller's review, felt it lacked flavoring. I think in the future, I'll use double the amount of lime juice, ditto the ginger. The flavors were more developed on the second day, but overall it needed some "brightening," which I think the extra lime juice would do.
  Not a complicated recipe, which was nice, but needed a little tweaking from my perspective. Oh, and I added a big handful of grape tomatoes that I'd sliced in half just before I served it, a little color & added flavor that seemed to work fine with the other ingredients. I'll make it again.

The recipe as is, is quite dry.  My five-year old daughter was eating this and suggested adding plain Greek yoghurt.  We did and it markedly improved the meal.  Also, I added two tablespoons of rosemary and two of basil to give it more pep.

I'm really excited about this recipe. I added garlic but that was it. You have to spend a little  time with prep, but it's worth it. It's very tastey and fresh. Excellent twist on shrimp!

This was good, I made it as more of a vegetable side dish to a pork tenderloin. I skipped the shrimp altogether. This made enough for 8. I cooked the quinoa in chicken broth the night before and then threw it together the following day using several cloves of garlic in the oil. I used orange and yellow peppers and half of the onion as it was a huge onion. I used twice the mushrooms and nearly 3/4 lb of asparagus. Instead of raisins I used chopped apricots. Also threw in halfed tomatoes long enough to heat them with the quinoa. Guests liked them, I'd skip tomatoes next time. I finished it off with the parley and toasted pine nuts. Pretty presentation and easy to make. I skipped the oil at the end as it was very moist with all the fresh veggies I used. I did add 1tsp pepper flakes to veggies while sautéing.  I would make this again, very healthy dish.

One of the best things I've eaten in a while!  Made a double batch (use the portion calculator provided) so we could have some, while taking some to a sick friend.  Yum!!!  I think I will add more veggies next time.  And possibly some onion powder as I think one still needs to use it even if onions are in the recipe.  I'd been doing this for years and wondering why it made a difference when I heard it confirmed on the Food Network.  Don't leave out the raisins - they give that umami touch - a nice surprise every now and then

Yes,  I added the sherry wine that the ginger was soaking in and it improved the taste tremendously.  I also think I might add some garlic the next time I make it.

Removed 2 TBSP of oil, used red and green peppers and forgot the parsley. 1 of 3 kids liked it as did both adults. That's a win in our house!

I doubled the recipe for seven people... I would not double it again if I were to make the dish in the future. Next time I would add more fresh ginger, raisins,mushrooms, and asparagus spears.

I added garbanzo beans to add more protein and added extra lemon juice.  It turned out really good.  I recommend this recipe.

This was very tasty. I used coconut oil to saute the vegetables and it added a nice flavour. Very good.

Liked this recipe very much and tried to follow it exactly except omitted mushrooms (which my husband doesn't like) and doubled the asparagus.  I tasted it first and then doubled the raisins and sprinkled in quite a bit of cayenne pepper.  Next time I'll sautee the onions and peppers in garlic as others have suggested and it would be great with chicken too.

Loved it! I cut down on the olive oil for health factor. I added a bunch of fresh kale and half bunch of fresh spinach. I think any of the bitter greens compliments the quinoa nicely. I omitted various vegetables and substituted my own. (Only because I had some and didn't have others.) This recipe is very flexible. I loved the lime juice, though I could see lemon juice working just as well. (Rinsing the quinoa is essential, despite the fact that some packaging says pre-rinsed, it tastes better after a quick rinse.)

This was delicious, even my hubby liked it, I used 2 limes  instead of just the one and added a few jalepino pepper flakes. Cant wait to make again.Going to skip the shrimp next time and serve with fresh steamed salmon.

I have made this twice and will be keeping as a regular staple.  The quinoa was good without the shrimp, although my son took care of this by eating all his shrimp and then having half of mine as well.  Try this you will like it.

This was a hit! My husband loved the sweet and tart taste. We will be trying it with other meats as time goes along.
