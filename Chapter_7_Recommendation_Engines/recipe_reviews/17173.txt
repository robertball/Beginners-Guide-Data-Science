REALLY good!! Made this for a party I hosted, and the ladies loved it!(most of us had seconds - some took bowls home for their husbands.) I used 1 1/2 pkgs of pudding (hence, increased the amt of milk, crm cheese and whipped topping,) and also added carmel topping along with the fudge - I was surprised how much I loved it, since it didn't call for chocolate cake - that might have actually been too much chocolate(if there is such a thing!)

I made this for a family gathering.  It was like a big mess in a bowl and is REALLY rich (and I have a big sweet tooth).  My brother-in-law was the only one who wanted to take it home.  I don't think I'd make it again...

I made this for a family reunion and everyone loved it!  It's easy, fast, and flavorful.  Great for kids and adults alike.  Reminds me of a banana split.
