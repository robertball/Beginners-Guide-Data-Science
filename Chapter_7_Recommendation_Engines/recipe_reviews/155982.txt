I admit my heart wasn’t in it.  I estimated each ingredient and threw it in the bowl.  I had no  semolina.  Who cares?   I’m too lazy to dirty another bowl, so I don’t bother making the dipping sauce.   It was just one of those days.  So, despite my lethargic, careless attitude, this came out great and I thought it was very good.

These patties were great!  I made them exactly as the recipe says.  I changed the sauce only because we accidentally bought vanilla yogurt and decided adding pineapple juice would be much too sweet.  BUT, we happened to have a jar of pineapple salsa (just pineapple and spice, no tomato) in the fridge.  That handled the fruity and the spicy, while the yogurt contributed creamy and sweet.  Awesome all around!

These were a hit at my house.  I will definitely make them again.  My "batter" seemed a little runny, not sure if that's the way it's supposed to be.  I did not have any samolina flour, so I just doubled the regular flour.  I also did not make the yogurt sauce.  No plain yogurt and not enough time!!

My Boyfriend loved these.  I niether loved them or hated them.  I couldnt decide.  The potatos were still too raw for my liking I think.  I may make again with some modifications.  We both did not care for the yogurt sacue.  Maybe a Chipotle Aioli Dipping Sauce instead.

I'm sorry, but I don't get it.  How long are they supposed to cook until they get firm?  Crusty, kind of burnt on the outside, and gooey in the middle.  I was expecting these to firm up.  Cooked 10 minutes on each side, and still too moist.  With the second batch, I'll add more flour and see what happens.

I don’t get how everyone got it into a patty. I squeezed out the excess liquid but still even with extra flour the patties fell apart. And about semolina- I added semolina flour, was that what the recipe called for? It tastes delicious, but will have to make it similar to potato pancakes; add baking powder and allow the mixture to sit under something heavy like a full teapot and plates for 10-20 minutes. That makes the liquid rise. Then drain most of it. Keep some liquid for moisture when frying. Feel free to comment.

loved the patties. Didn't like the dipping sauce as much as I liked the patties, though. I preferred them plain.

I altered it a little bit, using coconut flour instead of semolina and left out the coconut flakes all together. I also used honey instead of maple syrup and added nutmeg and salt. It tasted great. I thought the yogurt sauce was a very nice touch that complemented it fantastically.

I used GF flours, added a banana, ground flax seed in water instead of butter to create a GF/Vegan version and it was appreciated by all.

These were a great addition to Christmas dinner!  I didn't add the coconut and we didn't miss it. I oven baked the potatoes prior to grating them to avoid the uncooked flavor/texture that another review mentioned.  We will be making these again soon.
