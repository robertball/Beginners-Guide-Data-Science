I really like the taste of this--the horseradish goes really well with the taste of the parsnips.  The texture seems a little gluey.  I think I might have used too much potato.  Since parsnips and potatoes vary greatly in size, I would have liked a more specific measurement.

Way to spicy to eat in any filling quantity. The texture is strange, especially with the flavor. Just to strange for my taste.

This is incredibly rich, I enjoyed it very much. So great with steak! My evaporated milk was the full fat kind but I followed the recipe otherwise....except, I borrowed my food processor to my dad, so I mashed the veggies the old fashioned way :) Thanks for sharing your recipe, FFF!
