Nice recipe. Pretty sure they forgot to specify that you are using just the egg yolks -- not the whole egg.

Best thing ever. Seriously. Mine turned out darker than the picture even though I cut the molasses and sugar--will continue reducing next time. My custard cooked for longer, and some of the egg cooked at the bottom, so I'll stick close to the recipe's time. I added some nutmeg, ginger, and mixed some leftover speculoos cookies and raisins in--def swapping those for either nothing or something nutty instead, like peanut butter cookies. Thanks Kim.
