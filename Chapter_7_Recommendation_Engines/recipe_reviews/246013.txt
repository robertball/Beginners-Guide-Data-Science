Just made this again with fresh strawberries and strawberry jello and I can't decide if I like the blueberry or the strawberry better.  Equally delicious!

This was a definite hit, I did follow a suggestion and cut back on the sugar. I also used brown sugar instead of white with some cinnamon added ( I love cinnamon) My blueberries were frozen so I mixed just a bit of flour with the sugar. The Jello and cake mix I used were lemon and they went very well. I would deffinitely use this again.

I served this deelicious morsel at a formal tea. It was an instant favourite!! The refreshing whipped topping, the cake centre and heavily flavoured  blueberries at the bottom were perfect foils for flavour fencing on the tongue. Everyone's dishes came back well cleaned. I did add a bit more sugar to the blueberries as I wasn't positive about their natural sweetness. 
In all, a worthy dish which I shall add to my repertoire!

This was really good, and my family loved it.  I took the advice of other reviewers and used 1/2 cup sugar.  I didn't have strawberry jello, so I used lemon instead.  It was good.  No one knew marshmallows were in it, either.  I will make this again, which to me is the result of 100% success with a recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

I had a lot of blueberries that needed to be used up, and what better way than in a delicious cake for the family.  I made this two days ago and there is one slice left for our granddaughter. The kids loved it with whipped cream and also enjoyed it warm with ice cream.  I will definitely make this again and will try different fruits!!

I used a yellow cake mix and also used black cherry jello in the recipe.  This will be a fun recipe to play around with as there are many cake mixes and jello flavors for an unlimited  combination.

Go by baking time on cake box not in recipe directions. Cake was completely over baked at 40 mins. Not sure why directions say 50-55 mins. It was good even though it was dry. Did not notice the marshmallows in the cake. Maybe that was because it was over baked. Recipe calls for a cup of sugar. I used a half cup of coconut sugar because I had some to use up. I could not imagine using a full up of sugar along with the jello. Next time I will not use the sugar when using in season blueberries and adjust baking time.

Very easy to make & it came out great. But we didn't eat it right away, so it should have been refrigerated!!!!
After about 2 hours, the cake melted into the blueberries. Tasted okay, but presentation was a disaster.

This was delicious! I did cut the sugar to a 1/2 cup as a couple people stated it was to much. I believe it could be cut to 1/4 cup with no worries. I will make it again; maybe even experiment with other jello/fruit combos. To answer reviewer Fatima, just mix the box of jello with your sugar, no water. I will admit I had to think about that too! Thanks for the great recipe!

Sorry but it was not my slice. I made it according to package directions (B.C. cake mix). I doubt that made a difference.  I just thought it was too sweet. I love desserts but not sweet sweets.  If you loved it, good for you!

I am new to baking , just want to know that do you have to mix jello in water or use it in a powder form with sugar while layering it with blueberries?

Easy & pretty darn good.  Looking forward to trying it with other fruit.  It reminds me of pineapple upside down cake.
