I searched high and low for an oatmeal raisin cookie recipe to send my husband.  He is deployed right now and asked me to send him some oatmeal raisin cookies since they are his favorite.  I made these for him with a few minor changes....I added 2 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp allspice and I used 2 1/2 cups quick oats.  I can tell you that they were delicious right out of the oven, but wasn't sure if they would remain fresh.  My husband called me a week and a half later telling me to stop looking for recipes....this was the best one he ever tasted!  I'm sending him another box of these cookies tomorrow!!!

I substituted 1 1/2 cups applesauce for the butter and eggs and used sugar-free butterscotch pudding mix. The cookies were soft and delicious as well as fat-free!

These were very good. I added 1 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp salt, and 1/2 tsp cinnamon because I was afraid they would be too bland. I cut the oatmeal to about 2.5 cups. Turned out great!

I loved this recipe especially due to its adaptability to change.  Had 2 sticks of "can't believe it's not butter" I wanted to use up and wasn't sure about baking with it but it was great.  Used all 3 1/2 cups of oats due to the water content of the oleo.  added 1 tsp. of lemon juice and 1/2 tsp. more of baking soda to make a softer cookie.  1 tsp. cinnamon, butterscotch pudding mix(sugar free),odds and ends of halloween treats...Hershey's kissables, reeses peanut peanut butter pieces, butterscotch chips, and raisins.  Did add a tsp. vanilla.  Made 58 cookies using the pampered chef small size cookie scoop.  Loved the texture.  they didn't spread much and puffed up nicely for a really soft cookie chock-full of oats!  Thanks for this great recipe with alot of versatility and great flavor.

i made these using pumpkin spice pudding, and only 2.5 cups of oats -- with the reduction in oats, they were fantastic!!

I thought the recipe looked a little bland, so I added some spices from another recipe on this site (2 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp allspice, 1 tsp cloves), and the results were delicious and the aromas were heavenly.  Made half with raisin/walnuts and half with chocolate chips.  I made about 50 cookies from this recipe, so they were fairly large, and were nice and moist, but firm enough to store without breaking up.  Cooled them right on the pans and popped them into Zipper bags.

So happy to find this recipe!  I had it many years ago and misplaced it.  Made these for a friend for Christmas whose favorite cookie is oatmeal raisin...I did add about 1tsp of cinnamon...he just loved them.  In the past I've used butterscotch and chocolate pudding with excellent results.

My whole family liked these cookies.  I did use all butter and cut back the oats to 2 1/2 cups based on some other reviews.  And I always add vanilla..probably at least a couple teaspoons, but I never measure it.  : )  My vanilla pudding was the cook and serve kind, but it worked.  As a nod to fall, I made these Caramel Apple with dried apples and caramel bits.  The cookies were soft and moist.     I have a tough crowd to please, but everyone liked them.

Exceptional, easy to make cookies.  I changed the pudding mix to butterscotch and added  1 tablespoon vanilla, 1/2 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp cinnamon. Also reduced the oatmeal to 3 cups. Waiting for the autumn to try this with Pumpkin Spice Pudding.

I LOVE these cookies!!  I do not enjoy the spice-flavored oatmeal cookies, but THESE have become my favorite!  I've been making these cookies for over a year.  The secret is in the pudding.  If you use bland pudding, you'll get bland cookies.  I usually use french vanilla (or something similarly named) pudding, and sometimes I'll even use vanilla sugar instead of the white sugar.  I also plump the raisins in warm water (or rum(!) while I'm mixing the batter, but my favorite is to forget the raisins all together and add 1 cup of chocolate chips. Thanks for the recipe!

Just ate one of these delicious cookies - I did the 2 1/2 cups oats, 1 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp salt as was suggested by one of the reviewers and used 1 cup chocolate chips - I got 48 cookies that baked to perfection for 12 minutes.  I usually don't change the recipe but I wanted to experiment - which I will do the same again - great cookies - thanks so much for this recipe

very good, although i made a few changes. i didn't have butter-flavored shortening, so i just used butter. per other reviews, i also used butterscotch pudding to help with the flavor, and added chocolate chips instead of raisins. they didn't spread in the oven very much at all, wish i'd known that beforehand so i could've spaced them a little closer together :) next time i'll probably flatten them a bit before baking. i wound up baking mine for about 18miuntes...i couldn't really tell whether they were done or not at the 12minute mark, so i kept checking periodically. delicious right out of the oven, and still nice and chewy once they've cooled. different than your average oatmeal cookie...i'll hold onto the recipe to pull out occasionally, but i think i'll keep looking for my go-to oatmeal cookie recipe.

I was looking for a different recipe
from the Quaker Oatmeal cookie recipe.
I liked that this had instant vanilla
pudding.

I didn't have butter flavored shortening
so I added a 1/2 tsp. butter flavoring
to the shortening. I also added a tsp.
of pumpkin pie spice and used a dried
cranberry/spiced apple mix, to change
it up from the usual raisins. I also
added a tsp. of vanilla flavoring.

It was really a dry cookie dough. I
had to wet my hands to get the dough
to stick together, as I refrigerated
it to make the next day with my son.
I didn't read the reviews beforehand
so if I make these again, I'll reduce
the oats back a cup. 

It smells incredible when cooking. 

It's tasty, but as is, it has too 
much oatmeal and is too dry. I liked
the dried apples/cranberries in this recipe, I'll do that again.

These are great!  My kids helped me and we wanted to eat them all while they were still warm.  A couple of them were forgotten in the container and were still edible a week later... not many cookies are!  I used quick cooking oats as that was all that I had.  We will be making these again!!

The cookies were a bit dry.  I needed to find a way to use up some instant vanilla pudding mix and this seemed like a good idea.  They didn't spread much on the pan so after the first batch I flattened them before baking.  DH says they are really good.  They didn't do much for me.  He'll be taking them to work tomorrow.  I used chocolate chips instead of raisins.

Fantastic cookies! I used pumpkin spice pudding & cinnamon chips in my Thanksgiving contribution. Per the other reviews, I used 2.5c of oats because I didn't have time to remake them if 3.5 was too dry. I think I'll stick with 2.5 when I make these again. These would make a great base for monster cookies.

this is the best oatmeal cookie recipe i've found so far.  the only modification i made was to reduce the rolled oats to 2 1/2 cups because the batter was getting quite thick and dry.  the cookies were chewy and had a great flavor.

These cookies are great and are my boyfriend's new favorite.  I added some salt and a tsp vanilla and omitted the raisins.  I didn't have any problems with the cookies not flattening out or with the cookies being hard.  They were soft, chewy and delicious.  Next time I'm going to add some vanilla flavored chips.  You must try these cookies or you are really missing out!

BLACHK! What went wrong? I followed the recipe to a T, and they came out hard as rocks! I even cut down the baking time on the 2nd batch and they still were bad. I thought my oven wasn't on because after 8 minutes I looked in the oven window and they hadn't spread a bit.  Maybe the 3 1/2 cups of oatmeal is too much?? I don't know..I thoght they would be moist but they were very hard and almost like a granola bar. very dissapointed after all teh good reviews. Maybe it needs more moisture..obviously. :o)

Could be even better by adding a teaspoon of vanilla and a little salt.  The pudding is key.

Well, I had high hopes for these, but wow, they were not what I expected: dry and bland.  I followed the recipe, and like many others, it was not at all moist and chewy (like its cousin the chocolate chip cookie with pudding).  I have a recipe that uses whole wheat flour and oats, and they actually turn out more moist than these.  Sheesh.

I just made these...I did reduce the oatmeal to 2 cups, added 1 tsp of vanilla, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp salt. I didn't have any raisins so I added a cup of coconut...awesome. My cookies are a couple inches in diameter so I got 2 1/2 dozen from this recipe. Moist and soft...very tasty!

I made these and we loved them!  I ddn't have butter flavored shortening at the time so I just used 2 sticks of butter, and it worked out just fine. I also omited the raisins as we do not like them. Other than that I followed the recipe and they were great.  I will make them again soon.  I plan to try them with butterscotch chips sometime and maybe sometime with chocolate pudding instead of vanilla.  Recipe makes lots of cookies and they r good!  :)

Delicious cookie!  I added a half a cup of dried cranberries to my cookies and substituted half of the shortening with butter because I didn't have butter-flavored shortening.   My brother loved them and grabbed 3, fresh baked cookies to eat while playing his video games. The family agrees that the dried cranberries give the cookie a nice tartness that contrasts the sweetness of the dough.   Seriously going in my book!

I made a few changes.. but my cookies turned out amazing.. :) Had no shortening, so I used a stick and a half of butter.  Used pumpkin spice pudding. Added 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon.  Cut the oats to about 2 1/4. Added one cup of white chocolate chips.   They taste like Thanksgiving and smell like Christmas. :)

Great Recipe!! Probably some of the best oatmeal cookies I've ever made, plus I made them GLUTEN FREE!! They came out awesome. Most of the time I make gluten free baked goods you can tell the difference, but not with these.

Not a traditional oatmeal cookie, but a very good variation! I did think the flavor of the pudding was a tiny bit overpowering, I will use less next time around. My younger sisters loved them!

These cookies were great.  They were a little crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside.   I did not use the raisins and I used quick cooking oats. Everyone at my work gobbled them up.

These were good cookies.  They would have been great with added spice, like vanilla.  I accidentally overcooked one batch and they turned out to be my favorite.  They were a bit crunchier.  Next time I will also go with another reviews recommendation and use French vanilla pudding.  I will try this recipe again.

I use this as a base for my M&M cookies. They are always very chewy. Usually I add plain M&Ms, Skor bits, and chopped walnuts. Sometimes I cut back on the oats. Depends on how dry the mix feels.

This recipe was just okay, sorry!  But they didn't flatten out at all.  I feel that the amount of rolled oats was way too much.  The recipe on the insert of the Crisco package is much better than this.  Maybe I'll try the Crisco recipe and add the pudding.

These are the softest oatmeal cookies ever.  They don't really flaten out so if you want a flat cookie do it with your spoon before you put them in the oven.  I always take my cookies out early, to ensure softness and they were.  I will add vanilla and chocolate chips next time I cook them.

These cookies are delicious! I modified the recipe a bit by adding 1/2 tsp. each salt and cinnamon, and I used a cup of vanilla chips instead of the raisins. They turned out great and my husband and son loved them.

I don't know if there is a problem with the recipe or with my baking, but these turned out very dry and crumbly. I used white chocolate pudding mix. I reviewed the recipe and I believe that I followed it exactly, but based on the other ratings, I must have done something wrong. I can't imagine that anyone would consider these better than average. Will not make again.

Fabulous cookie.  I got raves from my bowling league ladies, husband and friends.  I tried white chocolate instant pudding - tastes great - and next time will use cheesecake flavored instant pudding.  Be creative with the pudding flavor and you can change the taste of the cookie everytime!

I tried these for the first time with butter (while not great for you, a whole lot better than the hydrogenated oil that is shortening), all brown sugar, 1 tsp vanilla extract and 2-1/2 cups oats.  They were great, but the cooking time almost doubled.  That's fine for the cookie; it's not so good for the raisins I added.  The second time, I added a little of the regular sugar and cooking time was diminished - maybe 13-14 minutes, I think.

I also baked 2 cookie sheets' worth at a time, rotating from top rack to lower rack and vice versa about 1/2 way through.

I'm going to try to add some cinnamon next time.

My husband and kids love these cookies.  Yum!  :)

Well, my biggest mistake is that I only had sugar-free pudding, so that's what I used and they're still pretty good... The pudding mix was white chocolate (not sure if that really made a difference). I reduced the  oats to 2 1/2 cups and added vanilla like previous reviewers suggested. I also added about 3/4 cup of both milk chocolate and white chocolate baking chips. Not the best cookies I've ever made, but they'll do ;)

I needed to use that lone box of pudding mix and this fit the bill nicely. I made a dozen of them plain, then added some chocolate chips for the next batch, and added dried cranberries for the last dozen. Yummy. They are a little bland. Next time I think I'll add some cinnamon or ginger to perk them up a bit.

These came out really, really tasty.  I reversed the ratio of white to brown sugar because I like crispy cookies as opposed to chewy. They didn't come out exactly crispy but definitely a good texture. I don't know how to achieve a crispy cookie. I used real butter because I don't like shortening so I don't know if the translation is exact, maybe less than one cup of butter would have worked better.  Finally I used pistachio pudding and chocolate chips because that is what I had on hand and I think it made for a very interesting flavor. I bet it would be better with vanilla pudding so there is no competition for flavor between the oatmeal/chips and the pudding.  All in all, a very worthy recipe when you want to use up some oatmeal and chips before they get stale!

Delicious! I had heard of putting pudding mix in cookies, but this was the first time I tried it.  Makes for perfect texture.  I reduced sugar by a half cup since the pudding adds some sweetness, plus I don't like my cookies overwhelmingly sweet.   Also, I use Hershey's Cinnamon Chips instead of raisins, and it tastes like MAGIC. Would be extra good with pecans pieces too.  I will be making this recipe over and over again!!!

This is a very moist cookie but I was disappointed in the lack of flavor. I may try it again with some added ingredients such as cinnamon, apple pie spice, nutmeg, etc. I could see it being very moist AND flavorful!  It has potential...

These cookies were Okay, however, I thought the vanilla pudding took away from a traditional oatmeal cookie taste we are familiar with. They did hold their shape well and didn't spread like others I've made from this site.

These were the best oatmeal cookies I have ever made.  I used french vanilla pudding, a splash of vanilla, dried cranberries, walnuts and cinnamon.  I also use whole wheat flour and you could not even tell.  Great recipe!!

I didnt like these. I had to add flour to make them actually hold together somewhat.  After a whole bunch of changes, these turned out to be OK, but I still like my own recipe much better.

A little bit crumbly- I would probably cut back on the oats next time. But they are very tasty. I added nuts and they were wonderful!

These were very easy and turned out great. Cookies never turn out properly for me, but these turned out great. I subsituted unsweetened applesauce for 90% of the butter and added a little oil. I think the substitution made my cookies more cake-like than regular cookies, but I don't mind that at all. I also cut out the extra 1/4 cup of white sugar and they still turned out quite sweet because of the pudding mix. I like my cookies chewy, so I used slow cooking oats. Great recipe!

I thought these were very good but just a little dry and needed a little more flavor.  Next time, I will cut back a little on the oats and definitely add some vanilla.  Some spices would be a nice addition.  The pudding is definitely a nice change.

Awesome cookies! I wish I know this recipe earlier! I just made half the recipe coz there are only my husband and I (both oatmeal cookie freaks).  I didn't have brown sugar, I just use white sugar and add a dash of syrup for the little brown color. I added a dash of cinnamon and pure vanilla.  They are sooooo soft and puffy out of the oven, let them sit for a few mins before you start touching and moving them to the cooling rack (coz I messed up a few). I used cranberries and walnuts instead of rasins for the first batch, then throw in chococlate chips and the rest of coconut flakes in the second... drooling... so easy yet so delicious.

This is the BEST oatmeal cookie recipe I've ever used. They are so moist and flavorful. Everyone loved them. I had to use margarine and I added a bit of vanilla. However, the only vanilla pudding I had was "Hulk" pudding, that turns green. The kids loved eating their Hulk cookies. I will never ever use another oatmeal cookie recipe.. hmmm.. I wonder how banana pudding would taste?

This is absolutely the BEST oatmeal cookie you will ever eat! I always use butterscotch pudding mix in mine when I omit the raisins, and they are always gone in a flash. I just made 6 dozen for a church conference, and they were the first tray to be emptied on the table!

I just want to say this is a very forgiving recipe! I used chocolate instant pudding, which made it hard to see browning in the oven... and about 1 2/3 cup combined of raisins, dates, cranberries and milk chocolate chips.  My problem same when I went to add the oatmeal and only had 1 3/4 cup. I added 2/3 cup flax seed and 2/3 cup semi crushed multi grain cereal flakes ...and they were still great!   Note: I had added a TBSP of buttermilk and 1/2 tsp baking soda to help them puff up as I was afraid the flax seed might make them dense. I posted a pic.

These are really great soft chewy cookies.  Not too sweet.   I didn't have the vanilla pudding so I used butterscotch and they turned out perfect.

I've made this for years now and the family adores it. I did use softened butter rather than shortening, and bake for 11 mins. Perfection every time - a delicious, chewy, oatmeal-raisin treat!

GREAT COOKIE WITH THE MINOR CHANGES I MADE TO IT.   I SUBSTITUTED PART OF THE BUTTER WITH  ABOUT 4 OZ OF APPLESAUCE SINCE I DID NOT HAVE THE EXACT AMOUNT CALLED FOR. I DECREASED THE AMOUNT OF OATS TO 2-1/2 CUPS INSTEAD OF THE 3-1/2 CUPS CALLED FOR. I ADDED IN 1-TSP OF CINNAMON FOR EXTRA FLAVOR. I WAS ABLE TO GET ABOUT 3-1/2 DOZEN LARGE COOKIES OUT OF THE DOUGH. MY BOYFRIEND LOVED THEM SO MUCH THE NIGHT I MADE THEM THAT HE ENDED UP EATING HALF THE CONTAINER WHEN HE CAME HOME FROM WORK LOL.

These were fantastic! Changes I made were using 1 c butter in place of shortening, only used 2 1/2c oats based on other reviews, and added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp allspice. Also used dried cranberries in place of raisins. So delicious, will definitely make again!

Followed to a T!  FAAAABULOUS!  I'm not big on raisins so I opted not to use them.  I couldn't find my aunt's recipe, so I searched and found this, and this is THE closest and BEST I've found in comparison!  Thank you to the person who posted this!

This cookie dough was very dry and crumbly.  The flour AND oatmeal in the proportions listed was too much.  No liquid ingredients to bind it together.

While I found these cookies to be tasty, but  they neither turned out soft or chewy.  I will make the cookies again, but I won't use this recipe.  I could not find my usual recipe for Oatmeal Raisin Cookies that uses vanilla pudding, so I tried this one and was not happy with the result.

OK..I only had "coconut cream" pudding so I used it with lots of pecans and 1/2 cup of finely diced candied pineapple and they were wonderful.  I made a very thin powerded sugar/milk frosting with bit of pinapple flavoring to dress the tops. Made for a chewy, tropical treat. Big hit at the Church luncheon...thanks.

These were great! We experimented with them and that made them really fun too. For the pudding we used Pistachio because thats all that we had at home, and then with half the batch we put chocolate chips in them and they were very yummy! I'm excited to try this with other pudding flavors :)

This was a great cookie recipe. I changed it a bit. I used banana pudding mix and chocolate chips instead of rasins. My son loved them we do cooking projects and he had fun making them to.

GREAT Recipe!  So chewy and tasty!  I make mine a little healthier, and they are still wonderful-my kids love them! 
I use 50/50 flour- half white and half whole wheat flour- you cannot even tell! 
I also use about a tablespoon of milled flaxseed, a dash or two of cinnamon, and about half a teaspoon of pure vanilla flavoring. 
I stopped searching for any other oatmeal cookie recipe-these are marvelous!

Makes a nice traditional oatmeal raisin cookie.  I love the addition of pudding!  I added cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves for spices in addition to 1 tsp of vanilla.  Also, I put the 1 cup raisins in a microwave safe bowl and added some water (enough to cover the raisins) and microwaved for 1:30-2 minutes on 70% power to help plump up the raisins.  I drained the liquid from the raisins and added the plumped raisins to the mix.  Thanks for the recipe it is very tasty!

Very good!  I have been searching for a recipe similar to my husband's grandmother's recipe, and this is pretty close.  I double the raisins and soak in hot water while preparing the rest of the dough.  Use the recommended 2 1/2 cups of dough and add nutmeg and a dash of allspice. I portion out these cookies (as I do almost all cookies) and freeze them, then I can take out 5 or 6 and bake when I want fresh cookies. Just be sure to flatten them before freezing.  I will try with chocolate chips next time! UPDATE - Just remembered this recipe and made it with butter, 1/2 splenda, whole wheat flour, 1 cup of white / dark chocolate chips and fresh cranberries - WOW!!!  It was AMAZING! I will flatten the cookies halfway through baking though.

I gave up sweets for Lent so I didn't taste these - my husband is the taster.  These were beautiful cookies that held their shape during baking.  I followed some of the advice in other reviews and added 2 tsp. cinnamon, 1 tsp. vanilla, and 1/2 tsp. salt.  My husband doesn't really like oatmeal raisin but he thought these were good.  They smelled wonderful while baking and look very pretty!  I will make these again.

We love this recipe!  The cookies stay soft and they are easy to make.  We usually substitute nuts for raisens, but they're great either way!

Just made this recipe with a few changes from the reviews I read here. I cut back the oats to 2 1/2 cups, added 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp cinnamon, a dash of salt and substituted butterscotch pudding. So far I'm pleased. The cookie tastes good, plumped up and spread out nicely, and made 3 dozen using my larger cookie scoop. Now I just need to see if they remain soft after a day or two! I only cooked them 8-9 minutes to try to keep them soft. Great recipe!

These were a little dense for my liking but the flavor was good.  They looked really nice on the plate...I rolled them into balls and they spread out really nicely.

I must've done something wrong.  :-(  My cookies didn't turn out chewy at all!  I'll have to try them one more time, I guess, to see if I need to make an adjustment or two.

I made this recipe not as alot of little cookies, but as one big cookie for my friend for her birthday.  Not only was it really easy to make, it cooked well as a humongous cookie, and tasted extraordinary.  Today, the day after i made the big cookie for my fried for her birthday i am going to make this same batch of cookies for myself and my family.  They are really moist tender and everything else that goes along with a great cookie.  One thing that i did change about the recipe which I think proboably made it better, was instead of using one cup of raisins, i used two cups of coarsly chopped walnuts.  They would proboably be really good with chopped pecans as well.  These Oatmeal Pudding cookies were the best oatmeal cookies I have ever eaten and made.
