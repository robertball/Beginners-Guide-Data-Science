Changes were slight- no miso paste over here (omitted - we need to be Gluten Free) and no seasoned salt (just used sea salt) but this was really wonderful. We also just used baby bella mushrooms. I wanted a recipe to let my CSA kohlrabi's taste shine and this did.  Great veggie recipe - very substantial and all three of my kids (though not terribly picky eaters) really enjoyed it.
