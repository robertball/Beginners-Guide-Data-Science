I tryed this on salmon. I think it has potential but it is too sweet. I only used 1 cup of brown sugar and it was still too much. I could not taste the spices at all and neither did my friend who does not like spicy foods.  Next time, I will add only 1/2 cup of brown sugar.

This was a wonderful rub , perfect for the family!! The only thing I changed was the amount of sugar, I reduced it down to 1/2 cup and added garlic powder to the rub . I made chicken and so I added crushed dry basil and baked it and it was wonderful.

Used this tonight on turkey cutlets.  Very very good.  Adjusted the recipe slightly using only 1 tbsp of paprika, and only a 1/2 cup of brown sugar as opposed to 1 1/2 cup.  Rub was the perfect combination of spicy and sweet; can't wait to try it on some other meats or veggies!  Served up with green beans, dinner rolls, and fresh strawberries for dessert.  I like my food spicy so the sweet heat was good for me, but DH was gulping down his water.  Might reduce the spice a little next time, maybe 3/4 tsp instead of a whole tsp.  But as is with the adjustments to the brown sugar and paprika, I liked it just fine!

This is a fabulous rub. I used it on chicken thighs , it was such a nice change from my regular rub recipe. Everyone loved it.
