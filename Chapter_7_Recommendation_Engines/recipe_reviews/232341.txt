Yummy! I have made this recipe a couple of times now. The trick is to bake ribs in the oven first to eliminate some fat. Falls off the bone goodness!

Super fast and easy to prepare. Didn't have chili powder so I used Sriracha chili sauce. Added a bit more cayenne as well because my girlfriend and I like it hot. Threw in the slow cooker for 10 hours while we were at work and came home to a wonderful smelling house and fall-off-the-bone ribby goodness. Served over rice to soak up all the sauce. Most excellent.

I was not impressed with this recipe. The flavor was pretty bland, and there wasn't much to the sauce. It's coming off my list.  :-(

I just made this recipe and it is awsome. I changed it up a little. I used ketchup instead of chunky tomato sauce and the sauce is awsome. I also seasoned the ribs with Fiesta Fajita seasoning for 2 hours before putting in the slow cooker. They taste awsome. I will definitely cook this again.

I loved it. My older daughter liked it. My husband hated it - said it wasn't tender enough. My younger daughter didn't care for it. My sister-in-law said it would be better baked. UGH! Still looking for something we can all enjoy.

It was okay. Next time I will cut down to 1/2 the amount of paprika and chili powder.  Dietzelomaha
