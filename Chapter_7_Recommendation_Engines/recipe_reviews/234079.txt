I really enjoyed this combination of flavors.  You may want to add a few more dried cranberries, so you can have that little tangy zip in every bite!  Adding a bit more mayonnaise would help the ingredients cling together more.  This would be good for leftover chicken or turkey.  Thanks!

Excellent with 1 C. walnuts as a substistue for almonds.  We added another 1/4 cup of dried cranberries, used about 1/2 C. mayo.  Serve on spinach for an even healtier salad.

Taking into account the other reviews, I made the following tweaks to this recipe:
~ Added raw sunflower kernels to the salad
~ Added 2 TBSP of cranberry sauce to 2 TBSP of mayo, a dash of dry mustard and 1/4 wedge of lemon juice and mixed well.  Then added the sauce to the salad and mixed it together.
~ Sprinkled chia seeds on top of salad when I served it.

I'm sure this recipe is just as delicious as written without the "tweaks."  I made this salad last night and it was so good, I could not wait till today for another serving.  Ha!  I am FEASTING on my second helping and am so enjoying it that I just had to write a review.  This salad is OHHHHH so delicious, refreshing and delightful... I suspect I'm going to polish it off by lunchtime!!   Bon apetit!!!  =)

I found the recipe somewhat dry so I added about 1/4 cup of homemade cranberry sauce.

This is a wonderful & healthy salad ! I'm so glad I came upon this recipe! The cranberries give a nice touch of sweetness to the salad. It's nice to go light on the mayonnaise and use healthy almonds & celery  !!!! I love it ! I give the salad a dash of salt on top and toast new york style  rye bread for a great tasting, healthy sandwich. Two thumbs up for this ! :)

I would use cranberry sauce next time instead of dried cranberrys and maybe add some lemon juice. It needs more zest

I used walnuts instead of almonds, added onions and sweet pickle relish.  It was fantastic and super easy!  Served it over a bed of spinach.

Great! I used light mayo and red peppers instead of celery. Awesome! We did have to add more mayo because it was too dry. It would have to go in a pita or wrap because it falls apart.

I love this recipe! I had some people over and it was a great way to use leftover turkey, as well as, my leftover cranberry sauce as I added  that to the equation based upon one person's post.  I made it a second time and the second time I added a couple of tablespoons of fresh squeezed lemon juice,  freshly chopped pecans, and a little bit of mustard powder.   The second time was even better than the first time! Awesome recipe!
