i liked it. i made it for a project in my ProStart class except we used panko, a faux-sauerkraut with cabbage, salt, and rice wine vinegar. i thought pickes would be really strange but it tasted really good in the roll. i would make it again, definately.

Needed a recipe for a german potluck, when I read this I thought YUCK but decided to make it.  DELICIOUS. Be sure to get the pork slice quite large to roll. Very different, hubby was delighted.  thanks!

You MUST cook the bacon first otherwise it comes out raw.  Absolutely will not make this again.

the was very good, the while family loved it. but, like others have said, make sure you partially cook your bacon first or it will not be cooked through in the finished product. I also used a larger cut of pork loin so we finished our in a 350-degree oven until it came up to temp after browning them in the pan.

Made it tonight for my mother in law's birthday dinner, shes full blooded German and it came out fantastic!!! We ate it with a tomatoe salad along with some German potato salad! Then of course homemade birthday cake:-) i will most certaintly mske it again for my family! Make sure to cook bacon first. Recipe doesn't specify that, wouldn't taste too good w raw bacon lol I used turkey bacon :-) was very yummy!
