I have made a dish very similar to this and results were very good. I do think that browning for 10 minutes per side is too long though. The meat would be pretty close to being done after this amount of time.

I changed this a bit--browned pork chops, removed from pan, placed wedges of cabbage in pan along with onions and apples, topped with pork chops, covered and let simmer for about 3 hours.  During last hour, I sprinkled a package of onion soup mix over all and let simmer more until the soup mix had diffused into the dish.  This turned out delicious.  I didn't thicken the sauce that was left in the pan--just ended up spooning out the cabbage and pork chops onto plates and throwing the juices that were left away.  Thickening the sauce just didn't sound good to me.  But the pork chops were extremely tender and whole dish was really delicious.  Thanks for an excellent starting recipe.

Very delicious recipe. My husband loved it! Although when I do make this again, I will season the chops and not cook them so long before placing everything else in the skillet. The chops came out a little dry, other than that though the recipe was great!

I love, love, love this recipe!  So much so that I am actually commenting on it(this is the 1st time I have commented on allrecipes.com)  :) It turned out so yummy.  The only thing I changed is I added a bit of brown sugar (1/4tsp) and replaced a bit of Worcestershire for a bit of red wine vinegar.

Very good.  I bought pork chops that were seasoned with cajun seasoning, so I didn't need to add the salt or pepper.  Also I didn't add the flour, we used the "gravy" over some rice.  Husband loved it, and never noticed that there were apples in the receipe.  Will make again!

I used 2 inch cuts from a whole pork tenderloin since that is what I had on hand and dusted each piece on both sides with Cajun seasoning before browning for about five minutes on each side.  I also added a little sugar and Mrs. Dash Extra Spicy on top of the cabbage prior to heat reduction for the simmering.  Cooking for about 45 minutes was perfect and we found the  mixture of flavors to be quite good.  I will definitely make again and serve with some nice crusty bread for, as we say in North Carolina, "soppin'" the gravy.

This so delicious and just what the Dr ordered for a coldy rainy day. I didn't change one thing except I had a pork loin boneless roast that I cut into 1 1/2 inch thick slices. Yum Yum....

My apologies, I always use thick cuts of pork, and didn’t specify that in the recipe here.  Actually this recipe evolved using pork steaks (sliced pork butt/shoulder roast) which benefit from the longer cooking time.

I thought this was very good, I prepared it as written. I will definitely make again. I think it would also be good with bacon, but I would leave out the salt and worcestershire

I added cajun seasoning instead of salt and pepper, which made for a really nice sweet-spicy taste.  Yum :)

Really good!  I used apple juice instead of water, added caraway seeds, 1/4 cup red wine vinegar and some nutmeg.Purple cabbage for color.  I will make this again!

I agree with the people who have said this recipe is tasteless. I followed it word for word and this meal had no taste. Also, cooking the pork chops for that long just makes them overcooked.

Even with the cajun seasoning as recommended it was still too sweet with only one apple. I also made sure to only brown it for a couple minutes on each side. But it did make the meat tender.

I don't know but my family and I did not care for it. The pork was over done as mentioned in the other comments.  There wasn't much taste.  I could not wait to try the flavors that had blended but was disappointed. The gravy looked good, but again, didn't have much flavor.  The apples were invisible.  Must've turned to applesauce.  The pork was tender.  Maybe I expected it to be like a boiled dinner?  That has lots of flavor. Needless to say, it ended up in the trash.  Maybe thats why no one has posted a picture.

I was amazed at how delicious this was.  I had sliced pork tenderloin that I browned first in olive oil then removed and followed recipe, but only cooked for 20 minutes.  I then added back the pork, which was sliced very thin and cooked for an additional 5 minutes.  I did add 1 heaping tsp of brown sugar in addition to the ingredients.  

After I thickened the gravy, I added a dash of apple cider vinegar to give it a hint of acidity and it made all the difference.  

This is a definite keeper.  Thanks!

This was SOOO good. I did a few changes. Used beef broth instead of water. Agree with other reviewers that browning should only be a couple minutes on each side. Pork chops were boneless and about 1 1/2” thick. Had 6. Used a full head of cabbage. Didn’t need to thicken with flour. It’s New Year’s so topped with black eyed peas with Rotel (tomatoes w/ green chili’s) topped with a little raw chopped onion.  Very flavorful!

I served this with spaetzle and poured the gravy on top. It was so good, like my German neighbors used to make when I was a kid. Even my kids loved the cabbage. Will make again.

I made this with sliced pork loin and it was very tender and delicious.  I did not add the flour at the end, since the liquid that remained in the pan was great as it was.  I will be make this again!

This recipe was good in a pinch, because I had cabbage to use up, but the flavor was rather bland for our taste.
