If you add a few drops of white food coloring (Americolor brand) while mixing the cake, the batter will stay white instead of turning yellow from the pudding mix.

I made this cake yesterday and it turned out great! however, i did change a few things around. i used vanilla pudding in between the layers, and iced the outside of the cake with cool whip. i then decorated it like an american flag with strawberry slices and fresh blueberries. also make sure you use enough blue and red dye so they don't come out as green and pink! the french vanilla pudding that is added to the white cake mix also made it turn yellow instead of white. but it still had the "red white and blue" feel. everyone loved it and had seconds. definitely recommend this!

Great idea for the holiday.  I suggest using just egg whites, then the cake will stay white.

Loved this cake! The cake mixes now are only 16.25 ounces, so I bought an extra cake & added 2 ounces from it to be sure the cake turned out good for a birthday party. Also subbed in white chocolate instant pudding mix to keep the batter whiter. I used 25 drops of red food coloring for the red layer, and still had pink batter & 15 drops of blue gave a light blue. Will use even more next time. The frosting recipe does not say to sift the powdered sugar before measuring, but I did since most frosting recipes I've used say to do that. Perhaps because of that, I only needed 1/2 c. heavy cream to get the frosting to a spreadable consistency. Even so, I had enough frosting for the cake, with a little left over. My guests were impressed & the cake was delicious.

I made this cake on election night, and it turned out perfect! Used 4 egg whites and plain vanilla pudding powder to keep the white layer white as some suggested. Perfectly moist, delicious, and beautiful, too! Thanks. I plan to adapt the colors for all sorts of celebrations.

This came out beautifully although I had to add almost half a tiny bottle of blue food coloring to make the blue layer.  The problem with the French Vanilla pudding is it makes the batter way too yellow.  I think I will try just plain vanilla next time and see if that helps.  I chose to use a whipped cream frosting and cover the cake with a berry flag- it got raves all the way around!

Turned out great for my potluck office party. Looked beautiful too. I must admit, it urks my soul when I don't see a patriotic cake (red, white, blue) in that order. Lol

I bought a box of Betty Crocker white cake and didnt add any of the pudding mix since it was alredy added to the box. I had to use a lot of food coloring to the red and blue to get it to not be pink and blue. My cake came out a little thinner than i'd like, but all in all, this was a great fun cake and i'd definatley make it again.

It worked great, only thing to mention is that I had to bake each portion for closer to 40 minutes.

I can’t give the recipe as is five stars.  I did follow the suggestions of reviewers and used a pudding in the mix cake mix, and I used two boxes to avoid thin layers.  I did not use the full 8 cups of powdered sugar...six cups was plenty sweet with good consistency and I still had leftover.  I did use regular vanilla extract and added butter flavoring as I didn’t have butter-flavored crisco on hand.  As the reviewers state, it takes A LOT of food coloring to get the tint correct.  Going forward I will use food color gel versus drops.  The cake itself is moist and delicious, but I think that depends on the mix you use...it is not dependent upon the recipe.  It was a great addition to our 4th of July meal.

The cake was delicious but it wasn't red white & blue...more like orange, yellow & green! The directions called for 4 eggs (did not exclude the yolks) & french vanilla pudding. The result was yellow batter so no amount of red or blue food coloring was going to produce the colors shown on the recipe. Next time, I plan to follow the directions on the white cake box (one that already includes pudding in the mix). The recipe yields a more than generous amount of icing.
