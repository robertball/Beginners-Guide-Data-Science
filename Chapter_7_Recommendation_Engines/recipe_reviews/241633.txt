These ingredients are what I've used for years to make cocktail sauce for the perfect shrimp cocktail. Made exactly as written and then added just a bit more horseradish and Tabasco (just a personal taste preference). I've never understood why people buy cocktail sauce in the bottle when it's sooooo easy to make and this recipe tastes soooo good and fresh. It just doesn't get any better than this one folks! KENDRU58 thanks for sharing your family recipe.

Tried this tonight with fried shrimp and it was fantastic.  Super easy to make.  Way better than the bottled stuff you buy at the store, and as good as if not better than high restaurant quality sauce.  Make it as spicy as you want... the 12 drops of hot sauce was perfect for my taste buds.  This is my new go-to cocktail sauce recipe now.

Outstanding recipe for coctail sauce. Just the right amount of individual flavors. Donâ€™t have to buy bottled sauce again.

Good base. Our family likes it with an additional tablespoon of chili sauce.
