SO good! So much more flavorful than all the cream of mushroom soup recipes I had to sift through to find one that used whole ingredients. 

For anyone saying that the recipe was too bland and who added cream of mushroom soup, you would get the same effect by adding a cup of salt to the recipe. Yuck. There's no creativity in using those soups, and they are NOT AT ALL healthy. Loved that this was a whole ingredient recipe without any poison added. (No, I'm not brainwashed, just like to know what I'm putting in my body.) 

We put the extra gravy over garlic mashed potatoes although I probably could have just eaten it with a spoon when no one was looking. :) The only things I changed: I used real garlic added with the onions instead of powder or garlic salt, and extra mushrooms, because we're kind of obsessed with them here.

Definitely a keeper. Used boneless chops and substituted beef broth for the water and it gave it a lot of flavor. Also used an oven safe skillet and cooked it at 325 degrees for an hour and the chops were fork tender.  I absolutely will use this recipe again.  Boneless chops often get dried out, but these were moist and tender.  Yum yum!

I was asked to make smothered pork chops for dinner so I decided to try this recipe and I'm so glad I did....it was DELISH!!! My family and friends LOVED it so much that no one talked at dinner they were all to busy eating.  I did change the recipe to make 9 servings and cooked it in a large electric skillet, very easy to prepare.

I do not often cook meat in a skillet, but this recipe sounded good and I felt up to giving it a try!  
The recipe was easy to follow, and the results were very good!  The pork chops had a nice flavor, and the gravy was delicious.

I followed this recipe exactly. It came out great... The only thing i changed is i added more onion bc me and my girls love onions, and i added a bell pepper. I haven't cooked like this in a long time. Nothing like southern cooking that soothes the soul... Thanks for your submission

As my bf said; YUMMY, YUMMY! Used chicken broth. Added 2 cups mushrooms and will make it 3 next time. Needed to add a little more oil and water to pan after adding flour spice mix. Was generous with spices. Definitely a keeper. A cold night comfort food

I did something wrong, but I'm not sure what. My gravy came out bright orange instead of brown, but it still tasted absolutely delicious! The pork chops were cooked to melt in your mouth perfection, and the seasoning were amazing. I tweaked that a little by using garlic salt and Tony's. I also added an extra cup of water for the gravy. I do plan to experiment with this recipe again to try and see what I did wrong.

Yummy! Added more onions and used chicken broth rather than just water. Served with mashed potatoes & brussels sprouts.  also... added powdered ginger to the seasoning of the pork.

Followed recipe with one modification...used chicken broth in place of water for the gravy. The broth gave the gravy another depth of seasoning. Yummy! The chops were cooked perfectly and the seasonings were wonderfully balanced. Will absolutely make this again.

This was just ok for me, I followed the recipe exactly and didn't care for the gravy, so I doctored it a bit by removing half, adding a can of cream of mushroom soup and more salt and pepper. The original recipe just tasted too bland for me, which was surprising because of the list of ingredients.

Loved this recipe. My whole family did actually. I served it over mashed potatoes.  My substitutions: per another reviewers idea, subbed in beef brother for water. I followed the recipe to a T until the end, instead of cooking for an hour I put it all in my instant pot (8qt) with an extra cup of water set to pressure cook for 6 minutes. Came out awesome, tender, onions and mushrooms were super tasty, gravy was spot on.

I like to experiment, but something kept me from doctoring this one and it turned out fantastic.  I made no changes.  Flavor was great.  I wanted to get away from the canned mushroom soup and this is it.  I will make this one again.

I followed the recipe as closely as possible without actually measuring anything.  I didn't substitute any ingredients but since I was cooking 6 chops, I also kind of adjusted everything on the fly.  It came out delicious and was a big hit with the family.
After frying the chops, there wasn't quite enough fat left in the pan so I added a bit more oil at that point and let it heat up before adding the onions.  Once I got to where you add the water, I felt the left-over flour might not be enough to get the gravy quite right so I stirred in about another quarter cup or so of flour.
After that, it went as expected.  All the onions dissolved into the beautiful reddish-brown gravy and people started poking their heads into the kitchen as the chops finished cooking.
Basic, simple, and delicious... I love it.

The pork chops were so tender. Used beef broth instead of water and the gravy was good also. I had to strain the gravy, coudn't get the lumps out. Next time I'll mix the flour and broth together before adding to the pan. Whole family enjoyed this meal with mashed potatoes and baked corn.

Good recipe but I spiced it up just a bit for my liking. After I browned the meat, I used 3 cups beef broth and a tbsp of butter to clean the pan drippings. Next I let it simmer for 5 minutes. Then I put chopped onions and bell peppers in the bottom of a baking pan , next I put the chops on top, and then I added the sauce from the pan on top and seasoned with garlic salt!  I covered with foil and baked for an hour and a half at 355 degrees Fahrenheit! Hope this helps!

The whole family enjoyed this.  Cooked six chops, split between 2 pans. Needed more water than the recipe called for, but that was an easy fix.
