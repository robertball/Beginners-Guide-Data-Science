Just a quick note... the low sodium beef broth is a typo. The recipe calls for low sodium chicken broth. Beef broth would just be weird :-)

If anyone has accidentally made this with beef broth, I would be very curious to know how it turned out!

I made these using the chicken broth as suggested and WOW! My sister in law was in town for dinner and I made this recipe for her and her family to rave reviews. Followed along exactly with no changes. The addition of the egg was incredible. This is a keeper.

The recipe fails to mention where the asparagus is supposed to go. I assumed it goes in the bundle with the salmon and the egg mixture.

Oh, man!  Great recipe. Salmon was juicy, tender, just perfect. The flavors were perfect. I was looking for an asparagus recipe and stumbled across this one. There aren't many good salmon recipes, but this one goes on my list. This was a two-fer, asparagus and salmon. Thanks!

Phenominal recipe! My boyfriend said that if five-star restaurants had a fish and chips dish on the menu, this would be just the kind of thing they would make. I'm going to put out some ideas as to how I'm going to do it next time, but honestly, this recipe is great just as it's shown here. I did notice that some of the instructions were vauge-ish. It said to reduce the sauce for ten minutes or until thickened. And I wondered, at what tempurature. Because a simmer would reduce less than a boil. Also, it didn't mention how thick the sauce should be after ten minutes. I'd say go for a thinner sauce. The sauce was very strong to taste naked, but worked very well on the pastry. I would definitely use just a medium or small lemon for zesting and 2 to 3 tsp. dill, depending on how dilly you want the sauce. I used regular chicken broth, but would use low sodium next time, and also I may look for low sodium cream cheese (if that exists). The recipe is very hardy, and I'm a light to medium eater, so next time I plan to cut the salmon into eight pieces. That way there is more size choice depending on how hungry everyone is.

Not that I wanted to change the recipe but we don't really like salmon but I had some fresh asparagus and wanted to make something with the puff pastry.
Used chicken tenders instead of salmon and changed the herb to rosemary and thyme vs dill. Rave reviews! I cooked the tenders and chopped them up and mixed them into the mayo, mustard, etc mixture. I also added some parmasen cheese and some shredded cheese. Still cooked it the same and made the sauce to drizzle overtop. For the sauce, I used chicken stock, rosemary, thyme and cream cheese. Thank you for the recipe!

This salmon dish is amazing!! I didn't have asparagus, so I used spinach and the taste was incredible! It looks very beautiful, too, when it's served.  I highly recommend this recipe. Thanks :)

What a gourmet recipe!  I enjoyed making it, though I must confess my final outcome was a bit rustic looking.  I was surprised that the portions were so large and filling.  I served mine with a side salad and think I might make them a bit smaller in the future.  The filling was an interesting combination of flavors and I wish that I was sophisticated enough to fully appreciate the egg but instead found it a little odd...and I love eggs!  I think that I might omit them next time.  I love the idea of a creamy sauce inside the pastry but mine turned into an egg and onion clump with some asparagus to one side.  Don't get me wrong, I give this recipe a strong 4 stars but will continue to look for something similar but without the egg.  Finally, the lemon dill sauce tasted wonderful but mine did not really thicken, I wonder what I did wrong.

One of my favorite salmon recipes. It’s especially good if you have a cheaper cut of salmon because you can hide the lackluster taste in this fantastic recipe. I do make 1.5x more of the sauce as we always run out otherwise. I’ve made this recipe now for years. Thank you for such a tasty and healthy dish!

We couldn't get enough.  Zing of lemon dill sauce was great with the salmon.  My only changes were to use broccoli and a can of very well drained red salmon.  I did taste the mix and adjusted for seasoning.  Next time I won't add the egg yolk to the mix but layer it for a prettier presentation.  Couldn't quite figure out which way to fold the pastry and ended up making bundles with the ends tucked under the bottom.  One thing I did do was lightly score the top and pop in the freezer for 10 minutes before baking as instructed.  They freeze and reheat very well.  The 2nd time I served them with leftover Zesty Onion Sauce from BK.  2 packs each person.

I was delighted by how easy this fancy-looking and photogenic dish was to make!  I substituted crescent roll dough for puff pastry (shortening the bake time to 16 minutes) and only had canned asparagus on hand, but was very pleased with the results.  My husband typically refuses salmon outright because of its strong flavor, but enjoyed his piece and didn't make a fuss about leftovers the following night.

Made exactly as suggested and both hubby and I found it kinda blah.  The fish came out perfectly cooked, and so did the bread...but it was a little flavorless inside.

I tried this recipe tonight, I only used 2 pieces of fish, so halved the pastry, but used the rest of recipe as written. We really enjoyed this and will do it again. As it is February and asparagus is 5 bucks a lb, I went with what I had which was spinach, turned out great. I will double the sauce next time tho, and thin it out a bit, it's really good but quite thick. This is a keeper recipe.

amazing, my 4 year old, 1.5 year old and husband all ate it up! the egg/cream cheese mix, the sauce and the boiled veggies can all be made the night before, then all you have to do is assemble and bake when you are ready, REALLY cuts down on prep time. Also i used green beans since that was what I had on hand. Delicious, I will make this again when I have company in town, what an easy way to really impress the pants off your guests, and easy to make!

This is great, easy and looks sophisticated!  Perfect for guests. I've substituted sea bass and cod and both work equally as good.  I double the sauce.
