My husband and mother absolutely loved this recipe.  I did leave out the MSG and only put half a packet of onion soup mix.  Will definately make again.

My family loved this one.  It was nice and moist, but not too moist.  I left out the bacon and the msg, and I substituted a mixture of ketchup and BBQ sauce for the outside of the loaf instead of tomato sauce.

This is probably the best meatloaf I have ever eaten!!!  I like to add a little bit of Dale's Steak Seasoning for a touch of extra flavor!

I really loved this recipe.  Like just about everyone else, I omitted the MSG but followed the rest of the recipe to the letter.  Not only was the meatloaf good when served with dinner, but the meatloaf sandwiches the next day were even better.

Very good meatloaf.  My husband loved it.  I omitted the bacon and the whole can of tomato sauce would not fit over the loaf (I have an 8 cup loaf pan).  I also used seasoned bread crumbs because that's all I had.  It is a very moist meatloaf.

This is great, I do omit the MSG and depending on what we are having with it omit the tomato sauce.  If we are having french fries, I top it with ketchup, if we are having mashed potatoes I leave it plain and heat up a jar of gravy.  Also I shape it into a loaf in a 9x13 pan and add about a cup of water to the pan right before it goes in the oven, it helps keep it moist and the meatloaf doesn't stick and the grease is easier to drain out.  Nice recipe!

I've always used this recipe minus the bacon on top.  Really good with a little tomato sauce on top.  I make it by sauteeing a bit of onion & bell pepper in bacon drippings then adding some tomato sauce, water, salt & pepper, and tabasco.  Very good and very moist.  My only meatloaf recipe.

Kind of bland and the meat was almost too moist, kind of "goopy".

This is classic meatloaf!  I mix the 2 lbs of meat, divide it in half and freeze one for later.  If you like the crusty outside, shape meat into several "armadillos" and the cook time will be shortened a bit. I also skip the MSG.

This meatloaf was good. My husband loved it and so did my kids. The only thing I changed was I used beefy onion soup instead of onion.

Have used this recipe twice, trying to find the correct balance of ingredients for us.  The first time we couldn't eat any of the finished product due to the bacon; the meatloaf tasted too salty and not at all like meatloaf. The second time, I eliminated the bacon, and with another user's advice I substituted tomato sauce for the ketchup and some of the water.  The result was moist and tasted good. It is still not our favorite meatloaf, but it is an easy, basic recipe. Thank you for sharing!

This is a really good, basic meatlof recipe.  I took another reviewer's suggestion of mixing ketchup with bbq sauce to add to the ground beef mixture and to the top.  The whole family enjoyed this one!

I didn't add the msg simply because I didn't have any, and my husband and I aren't crazy about ketchup/tomato soup on our meatloaf.  We like brown gravy.  I don't know if that really makes a difference or not but even without it, this is an awesome meatloaf recipe!  I can finally stop looking for one.  Thanks for sharing!

My husband loves this recipe.  I've done several variations:  put 1/2 the meat in the pan, layer mozarella cheese, top with the other 1/2 and bake; mix the tomato paste in with the meat instead of putting on top for a more moist loaf; mixing hot salsa into the meat for a southwestern kick.  It always comes out delicious!  My sister-in-law gave me another great idea:  bake the meat in muffin tins.  Not only does it cook faster (check it every 20 min, depending on your oven), but it makes it very easy to take for lunch the next day.  Perfect for school lunches!

This is a great recipe. My husband and I didn't even like meatloaf before trying this recipe. I don't add the MSG, and I leave out the bacon, because I ALWAYS add a layer of mozzarella cheese in the center of my meatloaf, and I figured that's unhealthy enough!

This recipe is great. I did, however, make one minor change. I did not add the MSG to the mixture. I made this and we loved it. We will surely make it again.

I made this recipe tonight.  It was ok, not the greatest, but ok.  Next time, I think I'll reduce the amount of meat, maybe down to 1 1/2 lbs and mix some onions into the ground beef.  It needed something, just not sure.

This was really delicious and SO moist, the onion soup mix was a great idea I have not tried before. There was a few things I changed the second time I made it though. Instead of the ketchup and tomato sauce I made a ketchup and BBQ sauce mixture to use inside and on top of the meatloaf, which added a little tang and a lot of flavor. I also omitted the bacon and MSG and added in chopped onions. I would definately recommend!

Despite using a thermometer to avoid overcooking this meat loaf turned out incredible dry.  I think either the liquid needs to be increased or need to use less breadcrumbs.  I did use 90% lean ground beef-but the recipe does state lean beef.

I don't know why this recipe got a few bad reviews.  I followed the recipe as written but used about eight ounzes of tomato sauce and cut the amount of water in half for the meat mixture.  I then placed the remainging tomato sauce from the can on top.  I also baked for about 15 minutes more than suggested so the temp was about 165 degrees.  It turned out perfect!

Why don't they call it Dear Abby Meatloaf.  Wasn't Dear Abby Ann Landers' sister?

I prefer the Amish Meatloaf recipe from this site.

This is my first review on ALLRECIPES and I'm going to use it to complain a little about other reviews. As I read thru people's reviews I find them mostly not to be reviews at all. In most cases it seems the reviews instead are people making CHANGES to someone's recipe. I guess in essence that means it's a negative review? I mean if you like a recipe you wouldn't change it would you??
In any case, I followed the recipe last night and this meatloaf was excellent!

I've been looking for the perfect meatloaf recipe, and this is it! DH gave it rave reviews as well. Like almost everyone else, I left out the MSG. Instead, I subbed 1/2 tsp. steak seasoning mix. Also, instead of the bacon and tomato sauce on top, I made crisscrosses with drizzled ketchup and mustard, like my mother used to do. SO delicious.

This was a terrific recipe!  We are still eating leftovers as sandwiches 4 days later - it's amazing, this meatloaf tastes great cold OR hot.  I, like other reviewers, left out the MSG and the bacon.  I also formed the mixture into a loaf shape and then put on a metal rack it into a 13x9 glass pan (not a loaf pan) so that the fat could drain off.  Also, I used seasoned breadcrumbs whiched worked great too.  This is going to become a regularly made meal in my house!

An excellent recipe so easy to make and the ingredients are generally within reach of the staples in one's cupboard/refrigerator.  It has a superb taste!

Just the flavor I was looking for! I make it all the time now. I use 100% whole wheat bread crumbs to help make it healthy - tastes just as good! (Also a good recipe for sneaking vegetables into picky eaters' tummies, LOL.)

I usually make meatloaf without using a recipe, but as I was serving it to company, thought I had better "go by the book".  This is a great recipe.  Does anyone even use MSG any more?  I don't.  I omitted any salt at all,  and also used a few teaspoons of dried minced onion rather than the dry onion soup mix, which is full of sodium.  I didn't use the bacon this time (was serving it to a guest who is on a salt-free diet).  Thanks, Debbie--this is a keeper!

This receipe was good.  I, like most, omitted the MSG.  I also used ketchup for the top instead of tomato sauce.  My only problem was that it was so moist that it was almost mushy.  Next time I'll add more bread crumbs or reduce the water a little.  I should point out, my husband thought it was great.

Excellent recipe!  I have made this at least 6 times and my 7 year old loves it!  I left out the MSG and the bacon, but topped it with a ketchup, brown sugar and worcestershire mixture. Excellent!

My family loved this recipe! I only made a few small changes. Like most I omitted the bacon and MSG, then I added a small diced onion, and instead of the tomato sauce on top I used a ketchup, mustard, brown sugar mixture which I also used to replace the ketchup inside. I baked it for 1 hr 15 min because of the many reviews that said it was mushy. It turned out perfectly! I'll definitely be making this again!

The meatloaf was delish. The first time I made this one we wished there had been more glaze. This time I used plain ketchup on top instead and we loved it! Nice flavor and sooo easy to make. There was none left for sandwiches tomorrow. I cut this in half for 3 of us. Thanks!

Meatloaf isn't my thing at all, but my husband loves it so I tried this recipe.  It was pretty much a hit.  I didn't think it needed the extra fat that comes with the bacon, so I left it out.  I also used 1/3 cup of ketchup inside instead of 1/4, it didn't require the entire can of tomato sauce on top.  I sprinkled parmesan cheese on top as well.  I used the entire package of onion soup mix just as suggested and it was fine.

I really didn't care too much for this recipe. The onion soup overpowered it and it seemed like that was all you could taste. Also had to use about 1/2 cup extra ketchup than it called for on top.

This is the meatloaf recipe I've been looking for.  Something like my mom used to make.  I made slight changes.  I threw in some chopped onion (b/c bf requested) and some worchestershire sauce.  I left off the bacon and topped the whole thing with ketchup.  I also made only half (just the 2 of us) and froze half.  The cooking time was almost the same, but I slightly overcooked the bottom.  Not a problem because we like the crunchies.  I think with a little bit more tweaking, it will be perfect!

I LOVED this recipe!  Amazingly, so did my 3 picky boys!  I substituted salt for the MSG though.  The first time I made it I did use the tomato sauce on top, but the second time I just used ketchup and that was actually better.  This recipe is in our official family cookbook of favorites.

Love it, love it, love it!  I had never made meatloaf before and when we tried this recipe I was thrilled at how simple but yummy it was!  Recently, several friends have had new babies and I've found this meatloaf to be a great homecooked meal to drop off for the new parents (who are often too exhausted to even think about cooking!) and it provides great leftovers.  I'm constantly being asked for the recipe and I'm only too happy to direct friends and family here!  Great meatloaf, thanks!

Tried recipe after reading reviews---very pleased.  I made some alterations because I didn't have some of the ingredients.  I substitued bread crumbs for 1 1/4 cup of old-fashioned quaker oats, used Lawrey's seasoning salt and garlic salt instead of other seasonings and 1 small onion.  I used 1/3 cup of ketsup intead of 1/4.  My husband normally doesn't like meatloaf, but he had two servings.  My toddler son had two servings as well.  I would have had more, but am watching my weight.  Very good recipe---thanks.

I used Heinz 57 sauce instead of the ketchup on top and substituted it for the tomato sauce inside to make it a little "zippier". This was a big hit, and we make a bigger meatloaf just to ensure left overs for next-day sandwiches.

I have to tell you that with being out numbered 7/1 with the men of this house this was a piece of cake to make for them.   And they ate the double batch.   This recipe was aslo made the morning of having the fella's place it in the oven.   I did delete the MSG!

This was a very good recipe! I would 'tweak' a few things next time. It tasted even better the next day for leftovers! Yum!

This is my favorite meatloaf recipe--I was so happy to find it on allrecipes.com!  I usually make it into three loaves, topping each with bacon and tomato sauce, and cooking them for about 45 minutes, instead of an hour.  It's really great reheated!

This is the meatloaf I will make for the rest of my life.  My mom and I discovered the recipe in a magazine years ago and have made it countless times.  The only thing I change is with the bacon - I usually add more (because I love bacon) and I have found that it doesn't cook through very well - it may help to cook it halfway in the microwave first.  Pre-cooked bacon like Hormel also works beautifully.  And, every oven is different with the baking time, my oven takes about 90 minutes.  Best meatloaf ever!!!

Really good....even the leftovers got eaten.  I
used Italian bread crumbs and added a little garlic
powder and Worcestershire.  Instead of plain tomato
sauce, I used catsup, brown sugar, and mustard. Using a 'meatloaf pan' that allows the grease to drain away as it bakes really helps.

Everyone loves this!  I "enhance" it a bit by finely chopping one small, seeded green bell pepper and mixing it in with the other ingredients.  Also, my young sons (undeveloped palates) like it when I mix ketchup in with the tomato sauce for the topping - I do a 1/2 and 1/2 mix of the two.

What a great meatloaf recipe! The only change I made was to drizzle on hot chile pepper sauce over the meatloaf half way through cooking. I also reduced the tomato sauce because of this. I used paste actually. A definite keeper! Thanks Deb!

I liked this recipe, but I also omitted the MSG, and I used ground turkey instead of beef.  I added green peppers and fresh onion for a better flavor as well.  My husband didn't even know he was eating turkey!

I followed the recipe exactly and no one liked it. It was definitely a waste of food...all you could taste was the onion soup mix. Sorry but I won't be using this recipe again.

I will make it again.
I left out the MSG and I think I will use less soup mix next time, but still very good.

Good stuff!  I liked everything.  I also omitted the MSG ( as someone else did in a review).  Also I'm sure it was in the package of onion soup anyway. I drained it well and it wasn't as crumbly as everyone made it seem. But I left it in the oven about 10-15 minutes longer to prevent that a bit and it didn't dry it out.  Good all around with some mashed potatoes and Corn on the cob good dinner!!

My family enjoyed this alot! If you want the bacon on top to be crispy, as bacon should be, pan fry it a bit before putting it over the meatloaf. Also, I rolled about 1/4 c of chive cream cheese inside the meatloaf. It came out fabulously.

I tried this recipe last night for dinner and it was amazing, I loved it, and so did my family I even brought some over for my in laws who also loved it. I used Italian Style bread crumbs with romano cheese and it added just the spices it needed, I fallowed everything else the same, I didn't use bacon either. But thank you for this recipe, I had a craving for meatloaf and it was worth every bite.

I have been making this meatloaf for years but without the bacon, MSG or tomato sauce.  I have tried other recipes that were much more complicated and my husband always says go back to the original one.  I also use 4Cs seasoned breadcrumbs. I cook it a little longer too.  That firms it up. I usually double the recipe and use 1 pound of ground pork and three pounds of Ground round.

Great meatloaf recipe.  It is just as good without the bacon.  I didn't use the MSG, and I found that it is better with ketchup on top instead of tomatoe sauce.  The texture is nice, and it doesn't fall apart when it's cut.

sooo good and super simple! i wasn't too keen on doing just tomato sauce because I've always liked more of a ketchup glaze so i found a really easy one from Alton Brown which is 1/2 cup of Ketchup, dash Worcester , dash of Hot Pepper sauce, 1 tbsp honey and 1 tsp of ground cumin. PERFECTION

Excellent meatloaf! I left out the MSG and substituted ketchup for the tomato sauce. Served with Mouse's Macaroni and Cheese (on this site) and broccoli. Husband declared it the best meatloaf recipe yet.

As everyone knows, I hate meatloaf but it is one of hubby's favorite dishes. This was very good (accdg to hubby)! We omitted the MSG and otherwise made to recipe. I even ate some if that tells you anything!

I made this last night for our family. It was phenominal. I could not purchase onion soup mix at our small grocery store however, so I substituted it for an onion vegitable dip mix. It worked wonderful. I also doubled the bacon! It was a hit and in fact I am eating it for lunch today!

This is my favorite meatloaf recipe. My mom always used to make her own (dry, onion, bad) meatloaf until she found this recipe. Now I make it too. The only thing I change is adding a couple extra strips of bacon to the top...who doesn't LOVE bacon? This meatloaf is moist and delicious.

This was my first meatloaf I made and It was very simple.  I did omit the MSG and used salt instead and I think that the meatloaf was a little too salty.  I don't know if this happenes with every meatloaf, but when mine was done, there was about 3" high of grease in the loaf pan....kinda gross but it was a very tasty.  I took the suggestion of another reviewer and used ketchup instead of the tomato sauce.  I will make again, but with less salt.

Very good flavor - I substitued Heinz 57 sauce for part of the ketchup, also didn't use all of the water.  Very good texture, but needed more than 1 hour to bake.  About 1 hour, 15 minutes.  Overall, wonderful recipe!

This was definitely the best meatloaf I have ever made.  I omitted the MSG and tomato paste - just used ketchup on top and it was great.  I was a little concerned that it wasn't done all the way after any hour because it's very gooey - I kept it in an extra 10-15 minutes and it was perfect.  Even my picky 5 y/o son loved it (though he wouldn't admit it lol).

I have the original clipping from Ann Landers' column and have been making it for years. Hers doesn't call for the bacon and I don't use it. I substitute Lawry's season salt for the Accent. I also normally skip the tomato sauce and go with gravy since I serve it with mashed potatoes. Great comfort food!

My wife and I are allergic to MSG, so I left that out, along with the tomato sauce and bacon. Instead of ketchup, I subbed  1/4 c Jack Daniel's BBQ sauce with a splotch of A1. Smells wonderful..

I made this recipe without the MSG and I didn't have any bacon. I did add about a half cup of chopped onion ,  fresh parsley and only use one cup of Italian seasoned breadcrumbs.  I put this in a Pyrex type casserole dish and had to cook it for an extra half an hour then it said. It was very good!

I think this is a great meatloaf base recipe, but there is a lot of room for improvement.  I omitted the MSG and bacon.  I used italian seasoned bread crumbs, added garlic powder and a splash or two of worchestershire sauce. Even with these modifications both my husband and I found this meatloaf relatively bland.  However it was very moist and good otherwise.  I will definitely try this again but with more seasoning.

This was very good.  It turned out extremely moist.  I did add a couple of things.  1/4 a Red Bell Pepper, and a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce and my bread crumbs were a mix of plain and seasoned.  I will definitely make again.

Wow.  I am not usually the one to disagree with the crowd of reviewers on recipes, but this was not good, and my husband and daughter agree.  I did use the tomato sauce instead of subbing ketchup, so maybe that would made some difference.  I followed the recipe exactly except the MSG.  We really did not like the texture of this.  It was heavy and bland.  We prefer the mini meatloaf recipe from this website.

Just ok. The meat seems a bit... pasty. I think it's because there are too many bread crumbs, or that it doesn't use crushed crackers. The only things that I changed to the recipe was add some italian seasoning and cook the load for an extra 10 minutes.

Great consistancy, best meat loaf I've ever made, I usually get complaints.  Bacon is a very nice extra flavor. Thank you.

A little too salty for my taste, will cut back on soup mix next time.

Did not have tomato sauce, used tomato soup, worked fine.

This was very simple to make.  It was a little bland so I will tweek it with some extra seasoning the next time. I don't know if the bacon helped enhance the flavor any but I do know it increased the fat content.  :)  I will omit the bacon next time.

This is a great recipe! I am a newlywed and love to try out new recipes on my husband - he seems to like it!:)
I followed the advice of several of my fellow cooks and left out the MSG and used ketchup instead of tomatoe sauce on top and it was great. Also, the last time I made it, I used Masterpiece barbeque sauce mixed in with the meat instead of ketchup. It gave it a different, tangy flavor and my husband thought loved it!

I have been looking for a good meatloaf recipe to compare to my mother's.  This one was pretty good.  Mine was not as firm as I would like, but I honestly think that was MY mistake in mixing it up.  I asked my boyfriend what he thought and he said it was a solid good, and definitely would like to have it again.  So we reccommend it.

This was the first meatloaf recipe I used and I stick with it.  It is consistently good.  I have changed a few things here and there, including using a meatloaf mix from the local grocery store which is a mixture of hamburg, veal and pork.

I have received rave reviews from many friends I have made this for.

Very good and moist! I too left out the MSG and and bacon. I reduced the amounts of each ingredient as I only had 1 1/4 lb of meat. I forgot to pour on the tomato sauce before baking, so I poured ketchup over the top when the meatloaf came out of the oven. My husband loved it. There was 1 small piece left over which made a great sandwich the next day..Will definitely use this recipe again...!

This was a very good meatloaf recipe and easy to make.  I covered the meatloaf with ketchup instead of tomato sauce and left out the MSG & bacon.  Kids even liked it which was a shocker!  I will make this again.

This was okay.  Nothing spectacular to speak of.  I would recommend using plain tomato sauce to top it off with.  I tried diluting tomato paste and that was thick and goopy even with all the water I added.  I also tried serving with a can of Meatloaf Sauce and it was not good at all; kind of tangy, actually.

I dropped the MSG ad onion soup mix BUT added 1/2 tsp garlic salt and 1/4 tsp black pepper.  I also cooked meat 30 minutes and drained excess juices from pan before adding tomato sauce and finishing the last 30 minutes of cooking. PERFECT not dry or soupy.

Best meatloaf ever!!! My other meatloaf was getting worst and worse over the years (partially because I was making it from memory). It was a mess!!! I wasn't even eating it anymore. This is nice and dense and stays together nicely like a loaf should. Flavor is awesome! Not too oniony. Perfect!

Fantastic recipe but I love my good old fashion ketchup, mustard, and brown sugar for the top! I am aware that it sounds weird but it's the best topping for meatloaf. You will absolutely love it! Give it a try and let me know...

I did not include the MSG, but otherwise made it per the directions.  It tasted fine, but I have had better meatloafs.  I won't make this again.

Delicious and moist.  I used lean turkey ground meat and added fresh chopped parsley and chopped mushrooms.  I omitted the MSG, bacon and tomato sauce.  I think chopped onion and some salt would be a good substitute for the onion soup mix. My husband said he likes meatloaf using real meat but he said this was outstanding. I highly recommend this recipe with a few adjustments.

I had never made meatloaf before and was a little nervous but this turned out amazing and my husband absolutely loved it! I took the recommendation of another reviewer to mix the catsup with the brown sugar and pour it over the top but I also followed the recipe and had the brown sugar and catsup on the bottom of the pan too. It was pretty sweet - next time I will def have the sugar and catsup mix on the bottom and top but will likely use less on each.

I have found that using extra-lean ground beef works just as well as lean. Sometimes I'll use a cheese sauce on the top in place of the tomato sauce and substitute little bits of ham for the bacon. Like other reviewers, I NEVER use MSG.

Very good recipe and easy to make. I substitute the ketchup for chilli sauce and the tomato sauce for tomato soup. The result is great. Not mushy, not too crumbly. I'd even be tempted to add more tomato soup while serving. Thanks!

This is a 5-Star recipe exactly as written!  I make it often.  I usually omit the MSG and the bacon.  Sometimes, I substitute equal parts old fashion rolled oats for breadcrumb.  Sometimes I use a 50/50 mix of beef and venison.  I've made many modifications to this recipe based on ingredients I have on-hand, and I haven't had a bad experience yet!  This one is a keeper for sure!
