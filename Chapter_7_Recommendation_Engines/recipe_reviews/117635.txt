Unbelievably quick, easy, and delicious!  I did not have any half and half on hand, so I copied another reviewer and used milk (1%) and it turned out great, not to mention a little healthier!

Quick! Easy! The only recommendation I would make is when you take the ice cream out of the ice/salt mixture, to rinse off the bag before opening. Very tasty.

This was TOO fun!  I had promised my husband I would make ice cream today and got so busy around the house I forgot until 7PM.  Too late to start making it in the ice cream freezer I figured.  I put everything together and gave the 
bag(s) to the hubby and let him do the shaking.  I added rock salt after 6 minutes because it really wasn't freezing very well, I thought.  Next time I will just use rock salt instead of table salt.  I have sent this this recipe to several friends with kids in the house.  Thanks for sharing!

This is a fun activity for kids!  I didn't have half & half, so we used 2% and a little leftover whipping cream that I had in the fridge.  I think any combination of milk, 1/2 & 1/2, or whipping cream will work as long as you use a cup of liquid.  You can vary the fat content that way too.

I made this ice cream growing up with a few differences. we used heavy cream and rock salt( both make it more of an ice cream instead of a soft serve. I dont like soft serve.)and we used 2 coffee cans instead of baggies. the coffee cans were easy and more fun, you just roll them. one large coffee can, one much smaller. ingrediants in the small one surrounded by ice and salt in the big one. my family would split into groups of two or more and play by rolling back and forth to eachother. you still need to use gloves.

I make this all the time for my granddaughter.  She wants it instead of store bought ice cream.  It is delicious.  I use 2% milk when I make it for myself.  I use 2 Tblsp. sugar instead of 1/4 cup.

I made this with my son tonight and it was surprisingly VERY tasty! We decided to add cocoa powder and cinnamon/sugar to flavor ours. As another reviewer suggested,we rinsed the salt off the bag before serving. Really fun,easy and good recipe...can easily make other flavors!

For the first time, I can say that a recipe listed the serving size accurately! It was perfect for two. I was so excited to try this out with my 5 y/o daughter. We were both amazed at how it turned out. I shook it for about 5 minutes and then opened the bag and added some crushed Oreos; resealed the bag and shook again for another 4-5 minutes. I think if you're going to add crushed Oreos, you may want to cut the vanilla back to 1/4 teaspoon. It's definitely a personal choice though. As I have seen mentioned many, many times about this method, it does come out like soft serve ice cream. It did thicken up a bit more after letting my bag sit in the freezer for a while. Either way, I give this 5 stars easily! It's cheap, fun, child friendly, completely non messy AND tasty, what more could you possibly ask for? :) *Note* My current picture was taken on my cell phone, I will provide a better picture when I make this again soon!

WOW! I never would have thought that you can possibly make ice cream this fast with no fancy ingredients and no expensive machines! all you need are a few ziplock bags! I'm super happy to have found this recipe. This ice cream really is speedy, it took me exactly ten minutes and I already had all the ingredients on hand, I'm sure that most people do too. This is my first time making it and it turned out great,I took other reviewers advice and made it with 2% milk instead of the half and half cream, which made it a little healthier, I'm sure. A little lumpy and watery at first but a few minutes in the freezer quickly fixed that.  I wasn't in the mood for plain vanilla so I added cinnamon sugar to it. If you want other flavors I'm sure it would be easy to make while adding Hershey's strawberry, or chocolate syrup,  a few crushed oreos, or fruit,...I'll be sure to try all of those the next times I make this easy fix for my ice cream cravings in this scorching Florida heat!

PS: For those of you with kids, I'm sure they'll love this! It's fresh and it doesn't have 1000 unpronounceable ingredients like store bought!

A great activity to do with the kids! I used 2% milk, so really I have ice milk.  I also used rock salt and a large rubbermaid container to contain the ice/salt. No need to crush the ice. After 6 minutes, we have a good solid ice cream. As others suggested, be sure to rinse the ice/salt off the ice cream bag before opening. We've had a great time experimenting with flavors. Besides adding candy and cookies, we've tried...1 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp cocoa powder, small chunks natural peanut butter, chopped Reeses Pieces (chocolate PB delight)...1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp peppermint, semisweet mini chocolate chips, green food coloring (mint chocolate chip)...1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp cinnamon flavoring, 1 tsp cocoa powder (chocolate cinnamon). Need to try instant coffee granules next!

Five stars!  I made this with my Sunday school class of 7 to 9 year-olds.  They loved that they could help make the ice cream, and they really loved eating it!  This ice cream had a nice, soft texture and really did taste great.  My kids and I are about to make it again at home.  We may experimentwith different flavorings and mix-ins.  I'm thinking of adding crushed Oreos to the ice cream.  Definitely give this recipe a try!

This is a super-easy recipe for fabulous ice-cream.  I made it with a class of middle-schoolers (a tasty lesson in measurement!) and everyone was impressed with how easy it was.  The kids can't wait to make it for their families.

I was quite excited to try this recipe as I lost my Ice Cream Maker in the move?  First of all, DON'T DOUBLE this!  It will never set up and is incredibly cold - even through my oven mitts.  Tried it again (adding Oreo crumbs as someone had suggested).  Put it in the freezer for 5 hours and it still was like a "runny Dairy Queen Blizzard", not even soft serve texture.  Taste was good but I like my ice cream a bit firmer.  I will say this was fun for my grandkids.  
NOTE:  Don't forget to run the inner bag  under COLD water to get the salt off or you'll have salty ice cream once you "squish" it out.

I USED THE HALF AND HALF AND IT HAD A FUNNY AFTER TASTE- NEXT TIME I WILL USE THE WHIPPING CREAM LIKE SUGGESTED BY OTHER REVIEWERS. MY KIDS LOVED IT ANYWAY AND HAD A LOT OF FUN MAKING IT. WE USED A BAGGIE INSIDE OF A LARGE CYLINDER TYPE CAN (EMPTY NESTLES CHOCO MIX). SUPER EASY AND EVEN TRIED IT WITH 1% MILK AND IT FROZE IN MINUTES!

WOW...I never would have thought something so easy to make would be so YUMMY!!  Very easy for my 3 and 4 yr olds to make and they LOVED eating the end result.  Ofcourse one of them likes chocolate ice cream so I just added a few squirts of choco syrup to her batch.  Great little project for them with a delicious result.

This really worked! I was craving ice cream one evening, the roads were bad and I didn't want to go out and get it, but happily I had all the ingredients on hand... kneaded it for about 7 min, rinsed off the bag, cut the tip off, and squeezed it out, viola!  The only thing was that it was a tad runny, I might stick it in the freezer for a few minutes before I dispense it next time.

This was so easy and fast. Next time I will use less sugar. It was a little too sweet for our liking. I also used heavy whipping cream which made for a more creamy texture. Will try to use 2% milk next time.

This was way too sweet. I used lowfat milk instead of half and half. I guess I was expecting real ice cream...not frozen creamer. I didn't like the texture at all.

On a whim, immediately after reading this recipe, I went to the kitchen to make it.  It sounded like a fun thing to do on a hot August day.  I did sub granulated Splenda (the kind used for baking)and 1% milk for a low cal version.  I also have a good quality vanilla.  This tastes just like "snow" ice cream, as those of you who live in climates that experience snow have probably eaten at some point in your life.  It brought back great childhood memories of fresh fallen snow, transformed into delicious frozen sweetness.  I thank you for that.

So easy and so yummy! It came out super melty, but I like it that way - like a milkshake. I also used 2% milk, so that probably makes a difference. I love having a reduced-fat homemade option for when I get an ice cream craving.

What a quick and easy way to make yummy ice cream! Japan weather has become so hot and humid, that I was just DYING for some ice cream. Japan's great and all, but if you don't have any cash on hand, you can't just whip out your card in this cash-based society. Not wanting to walk all the way to an ATM in this heat, I came upon this recipe and decided to give it a whirl. I've only ever seen heavy cream in the markets here and it is extremely expensive, so I only keep 2% milk in my mini fridge. Even though it was more like ice milk, it was absolutely refreshing and delicious! Next time I will try it with heavy cream. Yummy!

wow - what a great recipe. It's 104 outside right now, and we wanted a cool treat for after dinner - this was it! So easy to make and delicious. We didn't have cream or half and half so used 2% milk, it thickened in about 4 minutes. My kids put sprinkles on top and it was devoured. Thank you.

I give this 5 stars for it being so simple, unusual and great for kids to participate in.  It works but the ice cream melts pretty fast and the consistency is pretty soft but it tastes like ice cream and my 3 yr old loved it from start to finish.

I love this recipe! Both of my school age kids have made this in GT classes and brought the recipe home. I am using it this weekend for my 9 year old daughter's birthday party. I bought enough supplies for all 16 girls to make thier own and I have different flavored syrups that they can add to change the flavor. I'm actually only going to do it for 5 minutes and then have them put it in party cups to have as a "shake" to go w/ the cake. It's a really fun, inexpensive activity with a great ending. I'm sure it will be a hit!

This was so easy!  I put the whole bagged concoction inside one of those insulated grocery bags (which zips shut), and just shook, rolled and kneaded that -- kept my hands warm, kept the bags freezing cold, and the whole thing was done in 5 minutes flat!  Thanks for a great recipe!!

Mine got too salty when I was trying to get it out of its bag! I wish I had seen the suggestion to rinse off the bag before getting it out. Sounds like a good idea! I blended it with coffee and cocoa powder to counteract the saltiness but it didn't work well enough so I wasted it. Using a mixture of fat free evaporated milk and skim milk DOES work, but I'm not sure if it tastes great...

This recipe rocks!  My son had to make some dishes for a home ec class and he had to make a dairy dish.  This worked perfectly!  He couldn't believe he made ice cream in such a short amount of time.  We used whole milk as we didn't have the cream and it turned out great!  We also just used ice from the ice maker - it wasn't crushed - it was whole and that worked fine as well!  We'll definitly do this again!

I really like this ice cream, since it doesn't require anything that we don't already have in the fridge.  It tastes really good.  The only problem is that it melts really fast.  I like to put a little extra vanilla and a tsp of cocoa powder.

Quick, easy to make! We used a child's ice cream maker, but it turned out great.

This was good, we just made this for an activity with my kids friends. We did one batch with vanilla and one batch with root beer extract. Shook for the 7 mins. They had fun and laughed but got tired of it toward the end. It was very soft. But they ate it right away.

So I had a craving for chocolate ice cream and we didn't have any and the store was closed.  I found this recipe, and no kidding, 10 minutes later I enjoyed the best ice cream ever.  I also highly recommend rinsing the bag before opening it to avoid getting salt in the ice cream (yuck!!).  I put a little chocolate syrup on top and was so happy with my treat.

Who would have thought this would work? I tried it with 1% milk as someone suggested and it was SO GOOD. It came out soft and tasted like a milkshake. I make mine even easier with 1 c milk and 1/4 c sugar free hershey syrup instead of the sugar and vanilla. Now I can have healthy ice cream anytime!

My kids and I love this recipe.  The only problem we had was when we added to much chocolate/ stawberry syrup for flavoring.  It would just be really good chocolate/ stawberry milk when to much was added.

Ok this review is for the method only, I used it to freeze a batch of icecream I had made up to freeze in my icecream maker which turned out to be a piece of junk and didn't work. Tried this way and had delicious soft serve in 20 minutes! I will use this method again! I did this with my pre-school class years ago and it was so fun for them.

This was great. I think next time I will cut back a little on the sugar.

How fun!  We tried it using flavored liquid creamers for the liquid (we had Hazelnut but I bet any of them would be good).  Now that was some good eating!  We also put the little baggie of liquid in the freezer for about 20 minutes to get it good and cold.   I think it helped it set up better.
