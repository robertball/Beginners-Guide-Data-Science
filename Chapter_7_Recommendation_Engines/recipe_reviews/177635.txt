We really enjoyed this recipe. I did make some changes. I added red kidney beans as well as the pinto beans. I used WalMart's brand of Southwestern Black Bean and White Corn Salsa and added and extra cup. I did not have an onion on hand so I added a few dashes of onion powder. I prepared it the night before and all my husband had to do was put it in the crock pot in the morning. Super Yummy!

I am not one to change recipes but I did tweak this one just a bit. I browned the beef then added everything except vegetables and  simmered for one hour. Then added 4 oz. chopped green chilies and 16 oz. frozen vegetable soup veggies and cooked for 15 mins. then served. It was really good. I never thought a cup of salsa could make it so flavorful.

I made this exactly as directed, except I doubled the recipe. It was good, but my husband and I both thought it was missing something. It needs more "stuff" in it. I will doctor up the leftovers for tomorrow. Maybe add a can of Rotel. I think it may be better if I had used kidney beans instead of pintos, too...Not sure. Good, easy base recipe, though!

Fine. Not really good or bad.  It lacked good flavor depth and clearly needed work.  I made substantial changes after tasting it and liked my final product.

Good base - I changed the recipe a bit Ditched the corn (hubby is not partial to corn) Used 29 oz of Pinto Beans, 15 oz of petite diced tomatoes with green chiles and 15 oz refried beans with mild green chiles. Placed the refried beans in the pan I used to pan fry the beef and then added the tomatoes, heated them, added the spices and then added that mixture into the crock pot. YUM!!

Me & the hubby loved this dish. The only thing I done different is, I cooked it on the stovetop. I added black beans in addition to the pinto beans. We put this over yellow mexican rice.

Recipe was great. I added 2X-3X the beans and substituted natural beef bullion for the Cambell's soup since it has MSG in it. Excellent with tortilla chips!

Very good.  But it did need "something."  I added another 1/2 can of pinto beans and pureed the other half can with the juices and added for thickness.  Husband loved it!

I've had a version of this recipe for years from my Grandpa. He called it Chuck wagon stew. Mine is made with pork, a can of pork & beans, mushrooms and the rest of the ingredients but no soup. It's was one of our family favorites.

The whole family liked this.  I did add a can of Rotel tomatos and used medium salsa. It had a nice kick.  I also served it over rice and sprinkled shredded cheese on top with a dollop of sour cream. Yum!

I followed the recipe and it was so easy and so great, only thing I did that was different was to cook it in a crock pot! thank you for this addition to my soup collection.
