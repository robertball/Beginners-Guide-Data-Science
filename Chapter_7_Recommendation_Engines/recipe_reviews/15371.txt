Being a chef I saw that the sugar was too much. I make it with only 1 cup of sugar and baked meringue at 375 for only 6 min. great pie. I also make it with 1 1/2 cups sugar but added one more egg and a 1/4 cup more lemon juice. Great pie and the meringue is higher.325 is too low for a meringue to brown.

The lemon filling should be tart, not sweet, this pie was a waste of money and time, a big dissappointment, it was just nothing but a big sugar pie... yuk!

This pie was delicious. It was very sweet. I added just a little bit of lime to make it a little more tart. It was perfect.

I made this recipe as per the instructions, with only one change.  I added extra cornstarch to try to combat the soupy outcome that other commenters shared.  Three hours later, this pie has still not set up.  It is as thin as water.  Do not use this recipe- try another.

I did not put it on a double broiler.  I cooked it slow over heat.  I did use bottled lemon juice.  Kept adding to taste.   A bit of a change, but still excellent results

I made this recipe with 2 lemons vs. 1 lemon and 1 cup sugar vs. 1.5 cups in the lemon curd. I also added a 4th egg white and 1 extra tbsp sugar to the merengue because I prefer more merengue. It came out great. As with all pies, the final look is somewhat of an art form. The photo included on this recipe is not a great example for how the merengue should look. You want lightly browned stiff peaks, not a smooth surface.

Had problems form the beginning.  Cornstarch and water didn't make a paste.  It was very watery, so I added more cornstarch.  The overall flavor of the mixture in the double boiler was sweet, watery and not very lemony.  Added another egg and about 1/4 cup of lemon juice.  Ended up having way too much "custard" and it didn't thicken well in the double boiler.  
Cooked the pie first without the merinque topping.  Once it cooked for about 12-14 mins I added the merinque topping.
Once finshed it was custardy and the lemony flavored meringue was good, but very sweet.  
Needed to make two pies this morning for a back sale tommorrow and chose the Lemon Merinque Pie III Recipe.  Much better results.
