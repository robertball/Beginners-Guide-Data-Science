OK. The poblano pepper needs to be roasted then peeled- to give a richer flavor-and not put in the water with the pasta; then pureed.That should take care of the bitterness. Be careful with Poblano peppers because they can be quite hot at times. Do not be fooled when you get a mild one! Half of an onion is plenty. Chihuahua cheese instead of Mozzarella makes the dish more authentic.

VERY Pleasantly surprised!  NOTE: I quartered & seeded poblano, then boiled BEFORE boiling pasta (in same water though).  Then, after 10=12 minutes cooled & peeled skin right off.  Was able to get sauce in blender while pasta cooking so everything was ready at same time.
Definitely will make again - thanks!

The ONLY way this recipe turns out delicious...is if you roast and peel the pepper first. There is no need to boil in the water. If you place the roasted pepper in a plastic bag for a couple of mins...it will be easier to peel. If you do it this way....this recipe would be 5 stars!

This is the first recipe I've made from Allrecipes.com that I wasnt completely satisfied with...As previously mentioned, it IS a bit bitter from the pepper. There is really no need to chop the pepper as it will be put in the blender anyway after boiling.  I imagine peeling the whole boiled pepper before blending would cut down on the bitterness, but I think this recipe could still benefit from something sweet mixed in.  And if you're looking for something spicy, you'll have to add another type of pepper to this recipe; Poblano is extremely mild.  I might also suggest adding chopped pork or chicken, otherwise (obviously) this recipe is just noodles and sauce.

Yick!  I threw the whole thing out before even trying to serve it.  I think the onion was to blame: way too much onion!  If I ever attempt this recipe again, I would add only about 1/4 onion or less.  The sauce tasted like blended onion and cream with no hope for redemption.

This recipe was awful.  The sauce was bitter from the poblano pepper.  We tossed the entire meal.

I used a pint of half and half and two poblano peppers. I think it would be better if they were roasted but boiling the peppers is sooo much easier. I thought this was tasty, just a little hint of spicy, but not much. I used a hot pepper blend cheese in place of the mozz. cheese.

YUM!  Husband and son devoured it.  Used 2 poblanos.  Love the trick of cooking poblanos with the noodles-- they were tasty even before they went into the sauce.

This recipe combined my families two favorites, Mexican and pasta!!!  It is a very simple recipe to follow and makes for a great side dish as well as main meal if served with some grilled chicken.

Great mixutre.  Found that getting the chopped poblano out of the cooked pasta was a challenge.  

Poblano can be hard to get in my markets, but its a great recipie.  I enjoy it when i have the time to work on the peppers

Omg I just made this and it's SO good, but I did roast the pepper instead of boiling it [which is why I only gave it four stars]. I also made it low fat by using about 3/4 can of evaporated skim milk and a cup or so of fat free sour cream instead of the heavy cream. For everyone who says it's too oniony [with which I definitely disagree], maybe try cooking them just a little before pureeing. That would probably take away the remaining bite that cooking the sauce doesn't. :D

Very good - but needs LESS onion.  I used 2 poblanos, and roasted them separately instead of cooking with the pasta (per earlier reviews).  I recommend using 1/4 onion, and then see if you like the taste (you can always add more, but you can't take it away).

Excellent! Creamy and satisfying, like comfort food. I followed the recipe exactly except I used whole milk instead of cream and it was still rich and delicious. My husband (from DF) loved it.

I liked the recipe. I agree with others regarding the poblano pepper, onion, and chicken. I halved and seeded my pepper before boiling it. I also only added half the onion. Although it wasn't bad just as is, I think chicken would be good. I will try it next time.

I have made this recipe many times and it's one of my husband's favorites. I add 4 to 5 poblano peppers because sometimes the peppers are not that hot. I also put it in the oven for a few minutes after pasta has been blended with the sauce and cheese. Super good!

It was okay.  My husband and I love poblano peppers so we were excited to try it. We both found it bland and too creamy. I will try this again but will roast and peel the pepper and use a lot less cream or blend it with a little oil to make a pesto texture and mix with the pasta.

Flavor was okay.  I roasted and peeled the poblano like one reviewer suggested...I would definitely not use a whole onion, maybe half would do.  I also added chopped, cooked chicken.  It sort of reminded me of a Mexican style chicken and dumplings flavor.  My kids pretty much didn't want to eat it...bummer.  If it was just my husband and me then I would make this again, however since I need to feed kiddos...probably wont attempt again.
