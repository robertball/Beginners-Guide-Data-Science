Great recipe.  I found that pressing dough into 8 x 8 pan and baking is great, or even better forming dough into log and chilling overnight then slicing and baking is even better.  Great flavor, my husband loves them!

This was a very big hit in my family--everyone wanted the recipe at Christmas. Best method for me was rolling into a log, then slicing. 

For a different (and really yummy) flavor and texture, try six-grain "oat"meal. We discovered this when it was the only thing in the house to use (CA grocery strike). 

Also was very good with raw sugar sprinkled over the top before baking--gives cookies a bit of a sparkle and a touch of sweetness.

Fantastic, but surprising dough. I mixed up the dough, put it in the refrigerator, went to gather eggs, found the dough had expanded over the top of the bowl and pushed the refrigerator door open. I worked the dough back down, spreading it out in a 7x12 pan, baked it and enjoyed very much a wonderful cookie. I would like to know what makes the dough expand and if anyone else had that happen.

Very simple recipe, but taste great!  Cookies are lightly sweet, great for people who don't have a sweet tooth.  Final mixing of the creamed butter/sugar with the flour/oatmeal does take a bit of a strong arm, but definitely worth the effort.  I used a touch of almond extract in mine, which turned out well.

These cookies are super easy to make and taste great!  I left my dough in the fridge over night and then just before baking, placed them in the freezer for about 15mins.  I found it made the dough easier to work with.  I placed marischino cherry peices on top for decoration.  My roommates loved them!

My husband loved these. I would give them 4 1/2 stars if I could. Very easy to make. Rolling in a log and slicing the dough worked well for me. I baked them on a Silpat sheet and had to bake them almost twice as long as the recipe suggested.

The dough wouldn't stick together. I couldn't even roll it out.  Had to form into balls and flatten with a glass.  Very disappointed.

I just made these for Christmas.  Unfortunately, as they bake, they spread out and my Christmas stars now just look like oatmeal blobs.  I plan on baking the rest as a sheet instead.

I had a problem others have experienced...I followed everything exactly and it just would not stick together.  I ended up sprinkling some water over it until I could get it to stick together, then using my hands to form balls and then I had to flatten them out.  They ended up just being blobs of... something.  They taste a bit odd...a bit more sugar would make them taste better.

I'm sorry but I thought this recipe was terrible.  I followed it exactly except I used a Shortbread stone baking pan to cook them on.  They were hard to eat because of the oats & the flavor wasn't anything to get excited about.  I decided to re-use them by putting this mess on top of diced pears w/ almond extract & baking.  It's in the oven now.  I hope this will salvage my ingredients!

My family LOVED these. Dusted with icing sugar.
Also I made a log out of the dough, rolled it in parchment paper - threw it in the fridge for a few hours, then sliced and bakedvs rolling the dough out. Turned out wonderful! Thank-you for the recipe :)

Good recipe and the cookies turned out great! I actually left the dough sitting in the fridge for four days. Then I took it out using the recommended surface but also made sure to take a couple handfuls of flour and mixed it into the dough. Then I rolled it out and cut from it with a cookie cutter. I'll be making these again.

The recipe was simple.  The flavors were great.  I added 1 tsp of almond.  I don't know what I did wrong.  I chilled it in the fridge cut it into slices (it was in the shape of a log).  The came out flat, but still very good.  I will have to figure out what I did wrong.  Otherwise a great recipe.

A really tasty cookie, especially w/tea or coffee. I used various cookie cutter shapes & found the traditional round cutter to work the best.

These are so good.  I will be making these on a regular basis.  I followed one of the reviewers suggestion and rolled it like a log.  I then put it in the freeze for maybe 20 mins it was already very hard by that time so I just sliced it and popped them in the oven.  The flavor is heavenly and light on the sugar for those who count calories.

My dough was way to crumbly as well. Made half the amount and added an egg to the mixture. Made it into a log and refrigerated it for 2 hours. Is now perfect consistency to slice and bake. I will make thumbprints out of these with home made raspberry jam.

Great recipe! I followed the directions exactly and they turned out great. They are not too sweet and they have a great flavor. I like chewy cookies, so next time I would make them slightly thicker. But overall they were good and I will definitely make them again.
