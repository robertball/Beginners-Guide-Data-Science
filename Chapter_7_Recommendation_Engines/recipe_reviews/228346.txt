1.13.17  My apples were succulently sweet, so I didn't add the optional sugar, and I cut back on the amount of mayo (personal taste preference).  The apples add nice flavor to this classic pea salad.

Nice salad. Very easy to make. I added salt to taste.  Would go well with almost any Summer BBQ menu.
