This is super easy to put together. I used tamari sauce, needing to keep it gluten free. The  Sichuan pepper makes it so good. I limited the garlic and added a bit of fresh pounded ginger. I also used homemade "pulled" la mian gluten free noodles made from rice flours and starch. Thank you for the recipe.
