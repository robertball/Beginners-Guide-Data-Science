This was a wonderful brownie, gooey in the middle and crunchy around the edges.  I used a 9x13 pan and I am so glad I didn't double the recipe, it was still pretty thick.  I used 3/4c pecans and 1c chocolate chips. I cooked it for about 45 minutes, when the top cracked, it was perfectly done. My friends and I all raved about these brownies. I will definitely make them again.

These are the best brownies I have ever made - very moist, chewy and "fudgy".  I live at 10,500 feet and they turned out great at 38 minutes.

I live in Quito, which is 9895 ft above sea level. Brownies are one of the most difficult treats to make here. But, these passed the test. Not only against the altitude, but with all of my High School Home Ec students. Thank you for contributing this recipe!

Oh my goodness I made these the other nite & I live near Boulder, CO and have always had difficulty perfecting the art of baking at high altitudes, however this recipe has converted me for sure!!  I did follow the recipe exactly, though used semi-sweet mini chocolate chips instead of the regular and the brownies disappeared within a matter of days at our house, next time I might try dusting some powdered sugar very lightly on top, these are sublime and to me taste extremely similar if not better than those of a local bakery called Breadworks that is known for its exquisite brownies, now I can indulge at home as these are very inexpensive to make & amazing!!  A+!! Thank you!!!

Mile High Excellence!  As directed, I made 12 cupcake brownies. Filled about 3/4 of cupcake tin with batter. Covered with chocolate icing.  Moist, delicious, and only a slight sink in the center.  Notes -  Allow melted butter to cool before adding the rest of the wetmix.  Preheated oven to 400, then turned to 350 after putting in pan. Ovens drop temp quickly (50deg./10 sec.) with the door open.   Do not open oven door while baking. Loss of heat pressure will cause collapse.  -- Thanks for the recipe!

I live at 8,228 feet and have all but given up on baking.  That being said, I have made these brownies 3 times with rave reviews.  It's so nice seeing these come out of the oven without a big crater in the middle.  They are super fudgy and chewy with that nice crackled top I adore.  Not only that, they are easy to whip up if you need to bring something to a party.

I made this recipe at 5000', it turned out great!  The time was right on.  The nuts and chips are an added touch, making the brownies even tastier.  I will be making these again.

I live in Denver, and tried making brownies from a different recipe a few weeks ago but needless to say they didn't turn out. I was teaching a class yesterday and really wanted to make some fun treats for the kids, and stumbled across this recipe. They were GREAT! My husband liked them too. They didn't turn out cakey, they were nice and fudgy in the middle. Also added some chocolate chips. I followed someone else's advice on here and preheated my oven to 400, and then turned back down to 350 once they were in. They turned out perfect! I will definitely use this recipe again and again. Thanks! :)

I am at about 5700 ft here and I have never had an issue with the boxed brownies I usually make but I thought I'd try this recipe and see if there was something to it... I think they came out too "mushy". I did use a glass pan so I dont know if that matters? The taste overall was really good. They were chocolatey and everyone LOVED them. They didnt even last the night. I guess it just depends on what kind of brownie you are expecting. I wanted to frost them and put the nuts on top of the frosting but they were too soft. So the only thing I didnt do was use the nuts. I have been demanded to make these again though!!!

These brownies are the single most delicios brownies i have Ever tasted! even if you're living at a low altitude (I live at less than 1,000 feet) they'll still taste great! The chocolate is VERY INTENSE!!!!   It's very gooey and a little too runny but it's not like it's pudding.    Overall it's PERFECT!!!

This recipe was off the chain!!!  I used to make a different deep dish brownie recipe, until I lost the recipe in my move to another house, only these, that I found came out better than the other one did.  Bye-Bye old recipe, hello new one!...:)  This recipe was like having brownies that you would buy from a box.  Chewy, moist, not crunchy, and oh so chocolately good.  Thank You Holly8358!  The Best!!!  Next time I will double the recipe...:)

Excellent brownie recipe. I live at 10,000 ft and generally make it as is. I also only had 2 eggs once and substituted 2 tbsp vegetable oil for the 3rd egg. They still came out great. Thanks so much!!!

This is a delicious recipe. We baked it in Bogotá, Colombia, at about 8,500 ft. The only problem was that it completely overflowed the 8x8 pan and went all over the bottom of the oven. Maybe this had something to do with the fact that we were using a smaller stand-alone oven that's originally designed as a rotisserie oven (since we don't have one built in) and we had the convection on for the first few minutes. Next time, we will make half a recipe for the same size pan.

It definitely turned out quite well! Although I must confessed that I cut the sugar further down to 1 cup because I really don't care for a super sweet brownie and used 1/4 cup each of butter, canola oil and apple sauce. Because of that the brownie did not turn out to be quite as fudgy as brownies are supposed to be but my husband and I both liked that very much still!

These took a lot longer to bake, even though they were in a larger pan (more surface area & thinner batter). The taste was alright, nothing extra special about "high altitude" brownies.

I thought I had found the answer to my homemade brownie problem with this 'high altitude' recipe, but at 3500' this recipe didn't work well.  I followed the measurements exactly and found that after 40 minutes these were still too runny inside.  Next time I'll lower the heat and cook them longer.  The flavour was wonderful though!  And I will try again.

I live at 6500 ft.  The first time I made these brownies they turned out great - ever since no go!  I follow the directions exactly as written and each time they sink in the middle. I've tried adjusting temperature and time but no luck. They taste good but look bad.

Tried these at 5,351 FT and they were awesome. My hubby just past an exam and I wanted to make brownies for him. I don't keep baking chocolate around but did have cocoa, this was the only recipe I found that didn't call for baking chocolate. I baked them on the short side of things (35 mins) and they didn't get done (they were still warm and very creamy and fudge like), I will definitely try this again and baking them longer. Thanks for a great recipe.

Since moving to Colorado I have had to rework a lot of recipes.  This is fantastic at high altitudes and works for me every time.  Very fudgy and rich.  I add lots of chocolate chips.

I was really disappointed in this recipe- agreed that the batter tasted good but the finished product is DRY.  I added icing which helps to add some moistness.  Sorry to say the Betty Crocker boxed mix is better. Definitely won't make again... :(

These brownies are awful! they have the worst flavor I have ever experienced in a brownie. I am at 6500 ft in CO and I followed the recipe exactly and they were awful. They were moist and looked good, but it tasted kind of sour and had a lousy chocolate flavor. I am very disappointed in this recipe... I was really hoping they would be good, and a lot of the reviews praised it, but these brownies were awful... Even the uncooked batter had an odd taste. I have had such good luck with Betty Crocker, so I think I'll just stick with her... (Even our chickens wouldn't touch these gross so called brownies)

This are great! Especially with peanut butter chips. I live at an elevation of 6500' and these turn out just right. Nice and chewy with a dense crumb.

Absolutely wonderful brownies. I was just looking for a brownie recipe because I was craving them. This one popped up and I am at almost 6000 feet so I gave it a try. I used baking chocolate instead of cocoa powder. That is just my preference. I melted the butter in the baking dish as the oven was preheating, then poured it over the sugar. This really makes it extra good.  I will make this again. I didn’t have chocolate chips, but it was still excellent.  Yum. I think this is my new go to brownie recipe even if I’m home at 3000 feet! Thank you for sharing.

I followed the recipe exactly. The brownies rose very high and overflowed the pan and then they collapsed very low. They tasted super oily and I could not eat them. We do live at a higher altitude, 12000 feet so maybe that was the problem.

I have made these twice, adjusting the recipe for mile-high Prescott, AZ--between 5,500 and 6,000 feet.  I used almost all organic ingredients (flour, butter, sugar , vanilla and eggs), except for the nuts and chocolate to avoid GMOs.  

The second time around I used one cup of flour, and about 2 cups of Fisher whole walnuts, instead of the pecans and chocolate chips.  This is a very rich, moist, chocolaty (I used Hershey's unsweetened cocoa powder) delicious recipe that doubles beautifully . . . although I baked it about 5 minutes longer in a large Pyrex dish.  Buttering the dish, then lining with parchment and buttering again, allows you to lift out the entire recipe for ease in cutting.  I always trim off the ends and eat those the first night.  After refrigerating, it cuts beautifully for gifts.

Phenomenal brownies at 6575'.  We like them fudgy so I try to slightly under cook them.  Started checking at 25 min but needed 35 min.
Poured 1/2 batter into 8" square pan.  Spread with cream cheese filling (Chunky Cheesecake Brownies, on this site).  Poured remaining 1/2 batter over cream cheese filling.  Use knife in a few circular shapes to marble filling.

This recipe is amazing. I made it in Littleton CO. I had tried other regular brownie recipes and they did not work. This is the first recipe that turned out perfect. The brownies didn’t last 24 hours. I’m going to make them for my holiday party!

I live over 8 thousand feet and these didn't work for me at all. They sank and were hard when I took them out of the oven. They were burned and were not cooked in the middle. I followed the recipe as written.

I live in Ecuador at 8,000 feet and have been trying out different brownie recipes. This one is fantastic!! I used locally produced cocoa so they tasted soooo delicious! In Ecuador, you can't buy baking powder so the flour comes with or without baking powder already in it. I used the flour with baking powder - no problema! I made it with chocolate chips.

I followed this recipe exactly, and in the end it turned out as the same gooey, unbaked-in-the-middle, falling-apart mess that every other brownie recipe turns into at my altitude of 6,500 ft. The flavor was delicious but they're so messy that you can't even lift them out of the pan. Time for me to give up, maybe?

The first time I made this recipe the edges turned into concrete,  so the second time I covered it with tin foil and added 10 minutes to the baking time- they came out perfect!

I used dark cocoa and a full cup of flour instead of 7/8 cups because I don't have a measuring cup that volume; I guess just short of a cup.  It came out delicious and chewy.  The aroma had the whole house smelling delicious.

I wasn't sure about the pan size, so I used a traditional brownie pan - I also added 1 tsp of baking powder and they rose great!  Still had a fudgey center.  Baking took longer 350 for 25 minutes and then I dropped the temp to 325 for another 20 minutes.  I am sure if I had used the larger pan the time would be accurate :)

I live just north of Denver.  Some changes to make the brownies smoother (less gritty texture):  Replace butter with 1/2 cup butter, 1/2 cup oil (vegetable/canola/etc.); Replace sugar with 1 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar; Replace baking powder with 1 tsp baking powder; Ensure to cook in a 9 x 13 pan for 25-30 minutes.  The brownies are not as deep, but they cook more evenly and come out smoother.  I also used 1 cup chocolate chips (Ghiradelli milk chocolate).  Recipe is best with a high quality cocoa.  With these changes, recipe is now 5 stars.

We just moved to Colorado and I wanted to try baking something and I thought I would start with brownies.  This recipe is excellent!  I followed the directions and they turned out moist inside with a wonderful crunchy top.  I recommend this for anyone trying high altitude baking.

Best brownies ever!!!!  I would never make from a mix ever again.  Living in Denver, these are perfect.  Love the thick fudge in the middle and crunchy sides.

This is my go to brownie recipe now that I live at about 5,000 ft in Colorado. Fudgey, chocolatey, and delicious. I am always on the lookout for recipes that are high altitude tested and approved, and this is definitely a favorite.

Figured I should rate this because I USE IT ALL THE TIME.  My family loves these brownies. I don't add the CC, and it is just fine.  My favorite is cooking it in cupcake tins 1. It cooks faster and 2. you get more crunchy yummy edges.  This is the easiest and most delicious recipe for brownies I have ever had.  I will never buy a box again!

I live in Colorado Springs, but I've never had a problem with regular recipes. So, I thought I'd give this a try and see if there's a difference. Followed the recipe exactly, and I used the optional chocolate chips (although a bit less). I baked them for 40 minutes, and they looked very much done. But on the inside the brownies are either super fudgy, or simply undercooked. I'm not sure. The flavor is great, they really do taste good, but I am not a fan of the texture. It's gritty. My son took one bite and asked me to make "regular brownies" again, meaning the ones I usually make. I will stick with my usual ones, sorry.

Super easy, moist and rich at 6300 feet. I had medium eggs so I used 4; otherwise i made no adjustments. Baked in a square ceramic dish for 35 minutes. Yum!

The best brownies EVER! Made them for my 4-year olds play date and the girls loved them! We live at 7800ft. and they turned out thick and chewy, perfect texture. I am going to try to make them gluten free next...

I live in Denver, these came out beautifullly.  I added 2oz unsweetened baking chocolate to the butter mix and made them in a 9" deep dish pie pan and they cooked well and came out extra chocolatey.

I am NEVER making this recipe again because I almost literally ate them all. They are THAT good. Do not make these if you are pregnant like me or if you have no self control unless you are fine with eating an entire batch of brownies by yourself. These are even better the next day so if you are making them for an occasion I would do it the day before. Mine did go a little flat in the middle (I'm at 6500 ft) but it really didn't matter.. REALLY.

These were delicious! I suggest setting it to 16 servings for a bigger pan (9x12) and only using 5 eggs. Best homemade brownie recipe I've used.

I have tried umpteen brownie receipts in ABQ (at 5k feet) ... these tasted the absolute best.  The middle still sunk so I'll need to figure out how to tweak it, but I'll start with these basics from now on.

I moved to Fort Collins in Nov 2010 from the East Coast. Until I found this recipe earlier this year, I thought I had to give up on baking brownies. This is the best brownie recipe EVER! I did use Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa though. I think next time I will use half regular and half dark because it was a little strong, even for me. I was in a hurry this last time I made them so I cranked the heat up to 375 deg for a while, mainly because I made a recipe and a half in order to put it in a 9X12 pan. I love the "adjust servings" feature on this website! Thank you so much Holly for sharing!! (Oh, the first time I made them, I had a friend who is lactose intolerant, so I used unrefined, organic coconut oil in place of the butter, and that gave them quite an interesting flavor.) If you are making these for a crowd, put a piece of folded foil in the middle and put half of your batter sans the nuts on one side, then add your nuts to the rest of the batter and add to the other side. You never know who doesn't like nuts.
