Note that sugar should be added gradually to eggs in double boiler and should be whisked
not just stirred. Don't add the wine until sugar and eggs have a custard-like consistency or the 
alcohol will burn off by the time it's ready.
It can also be served at room temperature.

Not quite as good as my trad. recipe. 
I disagree with mousie about the steps. 
I have always combined all the ingredients then put it over simmering water and whisked it until nice and fluffy. Served over broken lady fingers and seasonal fruit. Fabulous finish to an Italian meal.

My recipe
12 egg yolks
1/2 cup superfine (berry) sugar
3/4 cup Marsala
Whisk until custard has tripled in volume and tempature reaches 140 degrees

Loved this! I incorporated a couple of suggestions from a couple of recipes along w/ Mousie's review. You need to whisk vigorously & don't allow the simmering water to touch the bottom of the custard pan. I did as Mousie suggested & allowed it to thicken before adding the wine (I used Muscat instead of Marsala) & the wine thinned it out quite a bit but it soon thickened right back up. I served it in vintage sherbet glasses & topped each w/ two beautiful, huge strawberries & sprinkled a little raw sugar over it all. Wsa beautiful & had an awesome flavor!

I made this with amaretto because it was 8pm and Desperate Housewives was on in 1 hour.  I was in a cooking mood but didn't have time to go to the store.  

All the same, this was splendid and indulgent.  I love it.

I haven't tried this yet, but I will and keep you posted.  This looks very similar to the Norwegian eggedosis -- except for the Marsala and the cooking.  I can't wait to try.  To Mousie:  The point of adding the Marsala and bringing it to the boiling point is so that the alcohol WILL burn off.  This is so that children can enjoy without getting buzzed and becoming alcoholic before the age of 12.  To the reviewer who said it tasted like egg:  Ummm... that's what custard is .... Anyway!  I'll let you know how I make out.

This was excellent.  I wouldn't change a thing.  I have tried other recipes and this is the only one that passed my husband test.  I served the custard over fresh strawberries as he has had in two 4 star restaurants and he felt this was pretty darn close to what he had.  Thank you for sharing.

I have served this over a spiced fruit compote (drained of fruit juices) and it is wonderful...if whisked continuously and for a good long time, it will thicken beautifully.  The taste is like a custard laced with Marsala...excellent!

Eughh! I followed the tips from mousie and it didn't get thick like I expected. And unfortunately, I somehow hoped that a recipe made mainly with egg yolks wouldn't actually taste like egg yolks. Wrong!

I used Moscato spumate sparkling wine!  Added eggs and sugar all at the same time.  Lots of whisking and some patience.  Came out wonderfully!!!!

This was my first time making it and followed the recipe to the "t" putting it on fresh strawberries. It was excellent. I will be trying it with different fruits and then different alcohols in the future to see how that goes.

Wow this was sooooooooo sweet.  Texture was great, and if you like Marsala wine this would be perfect for you.  For me, I love chicken marsala, and I kept wondering where the mushrooms were :( I wanted to love this sooo badly!

Very smooth and quite sweet. First time wearing eating this dessert so I have no point of reference but add your sugar gradually and if you can't find marshals try a sweet white
