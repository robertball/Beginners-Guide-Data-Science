This is now my husband's favorite pasta dish and my boys like it cause it has chicken instead of beef.  I do leave out the cilantro and green pepper cause no one in my house likes those ingredients, but it's good and satisfying.  Oh, and I just use dry dill weed instead of fresh.  And last time I made it I didn't get to the store for the Italian tomato paste, so I used regular and a teaspoon of Italian seasoning and it was just as good.

Of course I give this recipe 5 stars, it is my own.  Just a reccomendation for those interested in making this pasta. I usually make a little bit of extra bechamel and put a thicker layer on top.  makes it even more tasty!

I have to admit, I was nervous about this recipe, and wanted it to turn out well since it involves quite a bit of work and dishes! However, my fears were put to rest as soon as I took a bite. This a very good recipe that is not at all your typical casserole. The only things I changed were using margarine, lactose-free skim milk and frozen french-cut green beans instead of peas (not a big fan of peas). The end result was great. When reheated as leftovers, the bechamel sauce loses some flavor, but that's only a minor complaint.

this was just so-so for us. a lot of dirty dishes for what amounted to taste a whole lot like baked ziti but with soooo much more work. i gravitated towards this recipe because of the roux base instead of a casserole with canned soups, but the bechamel sauce was very bland - maybe i'm just not familiar with this type of middle eastern cooking, but it just wasn't to our liking. not bad, but nothing special.

What a great recipe!Wonderful flavors!I felt like I was eating in a restaurant! The only thing I would change is to make either less noodles or more sauce.The noodles really soak it up.I also used 5 chicken breasts per another users suggestion.This was really very good!

Delicious. This turned out even better than expected. The white and red sauces came together beautifully. Don't skimp on the fresh herbs.

I made this recipe with green beans and crushed tomatoes instead of paste and it turned out well. I also used veggie rotini that gave a wonderful look and taste. The tomato sauce and the bechamel is a surprisingly good combination.

This was just ok for me. It was a bit bland for all the prep and clean up time involved. I even tried to pep it up a bit by adding some hot sauce and extra spices. On the plus side, I was able to prepare it in advance and just pop it in the oven when we were ready to eat. Also, I the chicken breasts and whole wheat pasta didn't dry out.

This was soooooo GOOD!  I had some prepared chicken, so that cut some time after work.  I also used fat free milk instead of regular milk to cut some fat.  I will definately make this again, and cut the portion size!  It was a lot for my husband and I.

Different flavors than I usually cook with.  I love cilantro, so the dish tasted great to me.  I added parmessan cheese to the sauce.  I also added broccoli and peas.

This is a very tasty pasta dish and quite versatile too.  I halved the recipe and made the following changes because I didn't have all the ingredients: 

-rotini pasta instead of penne
-shrimp instead of chicken
-store-bought pasta sauce with mushrooms instead of the tomato paste and water
-parsley instead of cilantro

My husband loved it, had 3 servings and took the rest for lunch at work.

This was very good and a great way to use up leftover chicken and vegetables. I skipped the cilantro and peas and used broccoli and mushrooms instead. Also added some hot sauce to the sauce to give it a kick. Gang enjoyed it. Thank you!

This took two hours to prepare from start to finish and for that amount of time, I like something to be really dreamy to eat.  This was good, but I probably won't invest the time again.

I did sort of reinvent this using what I had accessible but the idea of pasta in Béchamel baked with a tomato sauce and chicken was consistent and came out divine.

My husband, who is Egyptian, said this was as good if not better than any macarona béchamel he's eaten in Egypt!  He was mad at me for something the day I made this and he said anything I had ever done to make him mad was forgiven because of this meal.  LOL.  It's so nummy and I can see myself playing around with the ingredients to make a completely different meal next time I make it!

Very tasty.  Hubby thought it was a nice alternative to baked ziti, but thought it could have used more chicken.  I used dried dill and omitted the cilantro (hate it).  It took forever for the bouillon cube to dissolve in the butter!  If you use unsalted butter for the bechamel sauce, I recommend adding some salt to the sauce.  The leftovers weren't quite as good as the fresh product, so next time I'll probably cut the recipe in half.

Scared at first, because when I tasted the red sauce mixture I thought the dill taste was too strong, but when the bechamel sauce and the red sauce are incorporated the flavor really balances out nicely. None of the seasoning was overpowering, and almost everyone had seconds. My husband is a picky eater and he wants me to make it again. The only thing I did different was use dried dill (about 1 tsp) and omitted the cilantro (just b/c I didn't have any). One other thing, I used just the regular tomato paste, so I added about 1 tbsp of italian seasoning. WONDERFUL DISH!!!

This pasta dish was sooooooooo delicious and I'm definitely planning on making it again.  There are somethings I'm going to change next time that will make this even better: leave out the cilantro, double the bechamel sauce, and cut up the chicken in tiny pieces.  
Note: this bechamel sauce is the easiest and tastiest white sauce I've ever made!!

I used leftover penne noodles that were sitting in the firdge waiting to be made (cutting down on the amt of work). This turned out great! I did marinate the chiken in some spices beforehand though.

This is a great recipe!  I didn't have the cilantro, dill weed, or green pepper, so I substituted fresh basil and steamed broccoli.  The two sauces melded perfectly together.  It was delicious, and I would definitely make it again.

Wow this recipe is excellent for pasta and chicken lovers.  It took a while to prepare but well worth the wait.  I used a yellow pepper and did not add the peas.  I added seasoning salt to the chicken mixture.  YUM YUM

Made a lot of dishes! But tasted really good. Not quite enough though so make more than you think you need.

Our whole family enjoyed this recipe, especially the tomato based sauce.  I did not have any chicken breasts but had some boneless turkey thighs I really needed to use up. The turkey thigh meat was quite strong tasting (will not be buying any turkey thighs from now on) and the only thing that saved them was the fact that this tomato sauce was so tasty.  We also added a bit more salt, 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese and 1/8 tsp of nutmeg to the white sauce.  I can't wait till I can try this again with chicken or beef.

Searched for recipe w/ cilanto and dill because I had alot in my garden. Perfect combo! Use bechamel sauce recipe to make other red/white pasta dishes. Always a winner.

Great tasting pasta dish. I went with the traditional Italian flavors since my family prefers it. I also added more chicken and added parmesan cheese to both layers of the casserole. Lovely smooth sauce coats the pasta and chicken wonderfully.

I loved it! It was my first time making something so delicate, especially with the bechamel sauce. The instructions were easy to follow, and ensured I got a wonderful sauce! The only thing I changed is that I put in a "Tikka Masala" spice mix into my chicken, to give it a spicy and nice flavour!

I added parmesan with the mozzarella.  The cilantro gives this a different flare.

I made this for my wife and two 3 year olds. Wife liked it, kids a little bit fussy but did (like most food) eat most of what was served in the end.

As someone else said there was a lot of washing up to do but I find that with most recipes until you are used to doing them at which point you can cut your own corners on washing up.

I used dry ground coriander and dry dill instead of fresh, they worked ok, but don't look as pretty.

I enjoyed making and eating it. My only whinge would be the time it took between heating the oven at Step 2 and placing it in the oven, it was probably 30 minutes too long, however I hadn't prepped anything, so it was probably my fault.

If you like the sound of the ingredients, I'd recommend giving it go. I'll do it again, next time with prep work!

This is delish! I did everything as written except I doubled the chicken, used half a bunch of cilantro, and i added a little salt to the sauce (might add some parmesan instead of salt next time). Really good! Thanks!

This is really good! I omitted the cilantro and peas (didn't have any), and added a can of diced tomatos with roasted garlic for chunkiness. Made great leftovers!

This was very good. I had some milk with powdered sugar in it that I needed to use up, so I used a cup of it. It made for an oddly sweet taste, but the dish was so good that we still really enjoyed it.

This recipe even sounded good, so I made an 8 serving quanity put it two casserol dishes and put one in the freezer. My family(3 people) loved it and there was plenty for my son who eats like two people and is a meat and potatoes type. He couldn't say enough about how good it was. PS He doesn' eat casserols...at least till now!

Really good, I didn't use any pasta, just had vegetables with it.  I also used chicken tighes instead of breasts, and the thighs were better, stronger flavour.
