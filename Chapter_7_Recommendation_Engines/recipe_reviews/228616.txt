Great tasting herbal polenta!  Any kind of cheese would work, but the gouda makes this special!  I'll be making this again!

Awesome, warm, homey! Loved it. I cut the pie slices in half to get more crunch per bit and it was great!

Wow, the sage is amazing in this! I didn't have smoked Gouda, so I used what I had in the fridge (Monterey Jack and Parm) but the sage is the star in this. Will definitely be making this again and again!

I really loved the combination of sage and smoked Gouda.  Different, but easy to make on a weeknight.  It made a good dinner with a big salad.

Made exactly like the recipe - I had ground rosemary and sage, so I used much less, but it turned out great!!
