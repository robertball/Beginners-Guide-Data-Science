Just about any vegetable, in my view, is delicious when it's cooked with bacon and garlic and it is here, too.  I found using chicken stock a good choice, more flavorful than just water. As for the cooking time, check your sprouts before the directed 15 minutes - I don't think they need that long.  In addition, caramelizing of the onions won't happen at med-high heat (they'd BURN at that temp for that long!), and at a lower temperature the bacon won't crisp up at all. I'd say cook both together at a medium temperature until the bacon is cooked to semi-crisp and the onions have softened - add the garlic toward the last minute or so, so that it doesn't burn. Also, give this a good dose of fresh ground pepper.

Ever since I was a child, I have always been under the impression that brussel sprouts are not good.  However, now that I'm an adult, I've recently had the desire to give them a second chance.  I picked this recipe because anything tastes better with bacon! :)  This dish was absolutely delicious, and both my husband and I couldn't get enough!  I now have a new appreciation for brussel sprouts.  Thank you Angela for changing my mind!  I am forever grateful.

This tasted great and was super easy. Also, I didn't need to add any salt or other seasonings. The listed ingredients' flavors married well all on their own.

This is very good. I browned the bacon alone in pan and then set aside and added the onions on lower heat to caramelize and added the garlic last. then returned the bacon back to pan and followed the recipe. I like using the chicken stock. I think it gives it a better flavor.

I think when we were younger, nobody liked brussels sprouts because they were nearly always boiled to death, and really weren't good.  I learned years ago to saute them, roast them, etc. and they are wonderful.  Introduced the fresh sprouts to my kids when they were small and they all love them.  This recipe is a great way to introduce someone to brussels sprouts that claims they "hate them".

The only thind I did different was to add a bay leaf to the chicken stock [home made].  1-1/2 cups. Everything tastes good with bacon.
Brussel sprouts are an acquired taste like scotch.

Really really really good! I did cut the recipe in half for just the 2 of us. I decided to add some fresh grated parm on the top when serving just because I had some I needed to use and it worked with it really well!

Big hit at Christmas dinner!    I used a can of broth and simmered down. Next time I will try adding the bacon bits at the end and see if we like them a bit crisp, definitely will cook again

For dieters like myself, adapted the recipe as follows in quart pan:   1 C chicken stock, sliced sweet onion, 2 sliced leeks (white part only), 1 T real bacon bits, garlic and halved Brussels sprouts. After bringing to a boil, simmered about 15+ minutes. Soo delicious.

Not my favorite. For all the work involved, a simple roasted Brussels sprout tastes better.

It was delicious, made it for Christmas dinner. It was also my first time making a sweet potato casserole. The only thing I did different was cut the white sugar and brown sugar to 3/4 cup and it was plenty sweet. I might try cutting it to 1/2 cup next time just to see.

If you love brussel sprouts this is sure to disappoint.  If you wish to cover up their flavour it's worth a try.  Crisp the bacon and set aside until the last moment or it becomes soft and greasy.

Incredibly tasty. I have always loved brussel sprouts but this recipe was just awesome. I halved the recipe as I really didn't need to feed that many people but it still came out good.

I made these as a side for Maple salmon. These were delish and something different than just adding butter to them. Great flavour!

Try the recipe with a little sauted salami, instead of bacon. It really takes it up a notch.
