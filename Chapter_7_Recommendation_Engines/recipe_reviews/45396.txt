I used 2 teaspoons of baking powder, instead of 2 Tablespoons; I used only 1/2 teaspoon of salt; I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla; and I used 3 Tablespoons of melted butter in place of oil. These turned out DELISH!!!!!

I cut the baking powder down to 2 teaspoons, added the 1 tsp of vanilla, got rid of the vegetable oil, and added some cinnamon while cooking and they were great! My family loved them.

This is a great recipe!  I decreased the baking powder to 2 tsps, added 1 tsp of vanilla and 1 tsp. fresh orange juice.  Everyone raved about them.  I tossed pecans in for those that like them, blueberries for others and there were no complaints.  Also for the little ones, I add a couple of drops of syrup right before I turn them the first time, and they eat them on the run!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!

Before I even read the reviews I realised that 2 TABLESPOONS of Baking Powder was obviously a typo for this recipe. I used 2 TEASPOONS like others, and this recipe turned out so light and fluffy! I also omitted the oil as I'm not a fan of extra fat in my pancakes. I halved the sugar and served them with real grade 3 maple syrup and they were so light and tasty.

This recipe was awful!  I definately added the vanilla, and cut the baking soda by a teaspoon...If you put an actual teaspoon of salt, it is too much!  I would try putting 1/2 the amount or less, next time.  Then, maybe this recipe can be salvaged:-)

I've read all the other reviews, and for those who said they were flat and aweful, you must have mixed them for too long! I've made the recipe AS IS several times, and let the batter rest for 5 minutes and they were SO fluffy and tastey. I have also made them with a little vanilla and that added a super flavor! So, beat your egg, people, and mix your dry ingredients together, and you won't have to mix and mix the batter. Just mix until blended, and let it rest a bit before you cook them and they will be great!!!

I ran into a couple of problems with these: batter was to thick and too much baking powder. Here's what I did for family size:
2c flour 
3 teaspoons of baking powder
2 3/4 of milk 
4 Tablespoons of veg oil
2 eggs 
1/4 c sugar 

They came out very nice!!!

Great recipe.  However I changed 2  tablespoons of baking powder to 2 teaspoons, took out the oil and added 3 tablespoons of butter, added cinnamon to taste, and a teaspoon of vanilla.  Add a cup of blueberries and you have pure bliss!

We didn't care for these at all. I did cut back on the baking powder as others reccommended but we didn't like the sweetness of them.  My Hubby wouldn't even eat them.  My kids did at least eat theirs.

This is a great recipe. Especially while most of us are trying to cut back on spending at the market. Beats Bisquick any day! My boys want pancakes every weekend and we tried this recipe. My son Travis, (15), is quite the cook. He made a few changes. We doubled the recipe, 2 cups of flour, 4 level teaspoons of baking powder, 1 teaspoon salt,   1 teaspoon vanilla, 2 eggs (beaten), 4 tablespoons of sugar, 4 tablespoons of veg.oil, then gradually added 1-1/2 cups of half & half. Let it sit for a few minutes, to rise. Perfect Pancakes! Moist & Fluffy. Thanks!

These are delicious and so easy.  I have been searching for a pancake recipe and many of the buttermilk recipes have been disappointing.  I love that I always have the ingredients on hand.  I used 2 tsp rather than tbsp baking soda, added a dash of vanilla and a few shakes of cinnamon.  I also substituted melted butter for oil.  I will always be making these.  Perfect and quick!

I guess I should have read the review before cooking, because my pancakes has way to much salt and baking powder.  My pancake loving husband couldn't even get through two.  The texture was great and they looked beautiful.  Next time I will take the advice before I cook.

I've never made pancakes and wanted to give this a try.  Unfortunately, I did not read the prior reviews.  I knew something looked wrong with the batter and now I know why... too much b. powder.  They tasted alright, but what doesn't taste good when you add tons of butter and maple syrup.  Ugh.

This recipe needs to be adjusted or else other novice cooks like myself will be adding more negative reviews.  Pancakes had great texture but boy, were they SALTY!  I threw the extra baking powder without thinking - why is it still up there in the recipe IF IT'S WRONG????!!!!!!

Lovely pancakes! Came out perfectly. I took the advice of the other reviewers and reduced the salt to a pinch, oil to one tbsp and baking powder to 2tsp. I also made it with half cup of wholewheat flour and half cup of regular flour. Will definitely make again. My hubby's a big fan!

these pancakes are soooo easy! I am a student and I was looking for an easy recipe for the weekend. The pancakes are SO INCREDIBLY fluffy (but like everyone else, I only used 2 teaspoons of baking powder rather than tablespoons.)

This recipe is not very good as written.  If you have time to read all the reviews or you want to develop your own recipe, perhaps this recipe works well for that.  However, it should not be rated based on the changes.

Mmm... pancakes. I used less baking powder because 2T just sounds like way too much for only 1c of flour.  I also added fresh mashed banana and tamarillo, vanilla extract and cinnamon, therefore I had to change the amount of milk to the create the proper thickness.  Thanks for the base recipe!

I have finally found a recipe that came out great for pancakes! I did what other reviewers suggested and cut the baking powder down to 2 tsp. added vanilla and cut the salt to 1/2 tsp also used butter instead of oil. I used 50/50 White and Wheat flour and they had great texture!! kids loved them and husband. I noticed other reviews had problems with too thin or runny, I don't know if this makes a difference but a couple things: Mix dry and wet ingredients separately and then mix well together Make sure pan is hot but not too hot like medium low heat, cast iron pan works really well. Don't grease the pan too much it will make the batter even thinner.  Just a few tips that made mine turn out great!!

TERRIBLE!!!!!!! If I had been making this recipe, I would have noticed the baking powder type-o but since my husband was the one surprising us with pancakes this morning, he didn't have any idea to lessen the baking powder and all 4 of us just spit these pancakes out! This recipe either needs to be corrected or deleted immediately so that no one else wastes their time, energy and ingredients!!!!!!!!

Delicious. I added vanilla and a bit of cinnamon. Adjusted the baking powder to 2 tsp, which seems perfect. Added a dollop of sour cream to the mixture and blended, as someone else suggested. I will never buy pancake mix again!

PEOPLE NEED TO REVIEW THE ACTUAL RECIPE, NOT THEIR MODIFIED VERSION!!! I just made these with the original 2 Tbsp of Baking Powder. Why would I do that, with it looking like such an obvious error?? Because the recipe reviewers gave it 4 stars, so I figured I was wrong and the recipe was right. Dangit, people, if you have to modify the recipe like crazy then it's NOT a good recipe. If it has a huge error that makes it horrible if made according to the recipe, it's NOT a good recipe.

These really are easy. I made it as is the first time but after that I cut the bp back to 2 t, the sugar in half since syrup is sweet enough, and the salt in half. I use melted butter instead of oil.

This was really good, no need to spend the extra money on pancake mixes anymore. This recipe is quick and easy. I had to add just a bit more flour to the batter, but i'm sure it varies with the quality of flour used.

I didn't read the reviews until after I made the pancakes, my bad. Thought the baking powder was off but still went trhough with it and they came out ok. Now that I know what to change I'm sure they will taste perfect. Thanks for this nice and simple recipe.

I made a double batch,,I used two level tsp. baking powder,,one level tsp.salt and they turned out fine. The only thing I will contemplate changing in the future is maybe add a little less sugar to prevent scorching.

This recipe was simple and very tasty.  I have a family of 5 children, a husband and two male room-mates.  I tripled the recipe to 12 servings with your recipe calculator and added two over ripe bananas for extra flavor.  It was fast and everyone ate second helpings!  Thanks!

Awful!  Salty, flat, and too greasy.  Made 2 pancakes, threw them away, added LOTS of sugar to try to correct the saltiness, to no avail.  Threw out all of the mixture and ate a bowl of cereal.

We needed to alter the recipe substantially. It was far too salty and not fluid enough. We cut the salt to one-half teaspoon, halved the baking powder and added about 1/4 cup of water and it was fine.

Good recipe.  I substituted a snack size of unsweetened applesauce instead of the oil.   Also,  I added 1 tablespoon of ground flax seeds for extra fiber and nutrition.  Used just a pinch of sugar and I added 1 tsp. of vanilla flavoring.  The batter was a little thin so I would decrease the milk to 3/4 cup.  And of course I added fresh blueberries-yum!

This pancake recipe is the best I have ever made.  My husband raved over them.  So easy, so flavourful and so perfect.  My only addition was that I added a teaspoon of pure vanilla, otherwise nothing else changed. Thank you so much!

I should have known better and read the reviews first before I had my hubby make them. Too salty and too much baking powder.  I gave it two stars because I will try it again and decrease  the measurements this time.

A good, simple starting point for scratch pancakes! I'm glad I checked the reviews before trying, 2 tsp baking powder was the right amount - also, I swapped melted butter for oil, added 2 tsp lemon juice and a dash of cinnamon... My girls loved 'em!

I loved this recipe. Of course I made the change for the baking powder; but I also halved the sugar, deleted the oil and salt, and added a tblspn of vanilla. This is a good change for those of us watching our sodium intake and trying to eat healthier without giving up everything that is good and tasty.

These pancakes were easy and pretty good. I did as the others suggested and cut back on the baking powder (1 teaspoon) and salt (1/2 teaspoon), added a teaspoon of vanilla and a dash or two of nutmeg.

I modified this recipe to 2 teaspoons of baking powder and a teaspoon of vanilla. It tasted really good though after. It is also really easy to throw in fruit, nuts, or granola with this simple batter.

I give these pancakes a four, with some changes.  I followed the recommendation of 2tsp baking powder.  I also added 2T brown sugar instead of white, a tsp of cinnamon, and I added a tsp (and a bit more) of vanilla.  (Many reviewers cut back on the salt, but I thought they tasted fine with the amount shown in the recipe.  I also added chocolate chips to half the cakes.  The flavor after these modifications was great, however, the texture left a bit to be desired.  I thought these took a bit too much elbow grease to cut into.  I may try add a bit more baking powder to see if that fluffs them up a bit, hopefully without altering the flavor.  Overall, these taste good in a pinch!

These are great! I followed the suggestions of other reviewers & cut the baking powder back to 2 teaspoons, & cut the salt back a little as well. I've made these several times on Saturday mornings for my husband & have made minor additional changes (based on what I have on hand or what mood I'm in :)), but the basic recipe is very simple & delicious, especially for someone who doesn't keep pancake mix on hand.

great base, but I think the author meant 2 tsp of baking powder. I used 2 tsp baking powder 2 tsp of butter in stead of oil 1/2 tsp of salt and really whipped the egg before folding it in and it was really good.

Pretty tasty and easy. I had no baking powder, so I used 1/2 teaspoon baking soda and 1 teaspoon of cream of tartar for the substitution. Added 1 tsp. vanilla extract. They were thinner than I liked so next time I will reduce the milk to 3/4 a cup.

Sitting with two good friends, enjoying a spectacular mountain view over breakfast - this experience can only be ruined by baking powdered pancakes! Unfortunately I did not read the reviews although we did question the obscene amount of salt and baking powder called for in this recipe - but we continued on trusting that everything is correct on the internet. Warning: do not drink orange juice while eating the baking soda pancakes - it's like choking on contaminated ocean water.

please!!!! change this recipe to reflect the fact that 2tbs of baking powder is WAY TOO MUCH. and one tsp of salt is just gross. After I tasted the first "pancake" I had to add another cup of flour, another egg and more milk, along with a brown bannana to the mix just so I didnt have to throw it all out... DONT FOLLOW DIRECTIONS.

it's ridiculous that a recipe that calls for 2 tablespoons (when it ought to be 2 teaspoons) gets such high ratings. this is clearly a mistake, and the recipe should be corrected, because making this recipe with the called for baking powder results in sour, soggy, crumbly pancakes.

If you let the batter rest for 5 minutes or so before you start cooking it, the baking powder will have time to activate.  Without the rest time, you'll end up with a runny batter that's hard to control on the griddle.  The pancakes could use some extra flavor from buttermilk or vanilla, or fruit added to the pancake while it cooks.  Overall, this is a decent basic pancake recipe.

The amounts of salt and baking powder in this recipe are way off! I stuck to the recipe exactly, and the pancakes turned out awful! We couldn't even eat them! But, I will try this again with the suggestions of other reviewers. Just a warning to other who want to try this recipe-cut down on the baking powder and salt definitely! The pancakes looked great, though. With adjustment this recipe could be a 4-star.

Love these pancakes & make them every weekend! Nice & fluffy. I use flaxseed oil & substitute 1/4 cup of the flour with whole wheat flour for extra fiber. My kids think they're great....

Personally I don't find the amounts in this recipe to be off, although it does sound like a lot of baking powder, I followed the recipe and the pancakes came out really good.  I doubled the recipe and added about a teaspoon each of vanilla and cinnamon and then walnuts to each pancake while cooking.  Really no other alterations needed.

I was looking for a quick and easy pancake recipe, but one that tasted like it took a little more time to prepare.  This is definatly NOT that recipe.  The baking powder is overpowering, even cut in half.  Not fluffy at all written as is.  I'll stick to my own pancake recipe, takes a little more time to beat the egg whites, but so worth it.

These pancakes were super quick and easy to make. I've always had a problem using boxed pancake mix because they were too tough, so when i found this recipe I tried it. I added a dollop of sour cream and a dribble of vanilla extract and they turned out super fluffy and just a little bit sweet - perfect!

I will make it again.  I used 1/2 teaspoon of salt, 3 tablespoons of butter, 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract.  I recommend this to pancake lovers. It is fast and easy.  I also add chocolate chips but i think you can what you want.

These are yummy pancakes! I am not a cook and I really like that these are so simple and fast, yet taste so good. I have made them several times. Looking at the other reviews, it looks like the recipe was originally posted with a mistake, but by now it's surely been corrected as it comes out great every time!

This recipe was fantastic!  We have a dairy and corn allergy in our house.  We used coconut milk in place of the milk and made our own safe baking powder (cream of tartar and baking soda).  I also substituted for the vegetable oil.  Kids proclaimed them the best pancakes ever!

Great recipe for it's simplicity. I try to play around with the flour mix to introduce more wheat but otherwise they come out great. I have even substituted in water without any big difference.

Did you all not read the recipe?  It calls for 2 teaspoons of baking powder, not tablespoons.

I followed the recipe exactly except I added a teaspoon of vanilla I made these for my hard to please 6 year old grandson and he loved them I will make them again. I don't understand why everyone likes to say they added this and cut out that and they were terrible then criticize the recipe you should just post your own recipes and stop criticizing everyone else's as clearly if you have made so many changes your not making these pancakes your making your own recipe but just like to criticize others I believe that the people that are posting their recipes here are trying to be helpful not torn apart by a bunch of critical hateful other people if you haven't anything nice to say please keep it to yourselves as I find it very offensive!

The ingredient measurements as listed above are correct. I sifted together the dry ingredients (adding 1/4 tsp of cinnamon)first. I proceeded to follow rest of recipe as directed, but did allow a few minutes for batter to rest. They were perfectly delicious!

This recipe was not good. If you are going to put all the effort into making pancakes they better be good. They were flat and they had way to much baking powder. I would not recommend these to anyone.

I am not a fan of recipes with a long list of ingredients. That is why I chose this one for our pancake breakfast. Be careful reading the recipe. I see a lot of people stating they reduced the baking powder from 2 tablespoons to 2 teaspoons. The recipe specifically states "2 teaspoons baking powder", which is adequate. I do agree in cutting back on the salt. I used only a pinch, and these pancakes are very easy.  They came out fluffy and tasty!

These pancakes are simple and delicious!! The only changes I make are to add slightly less milk (I like my pancakes a little thicker) and add 1-2 tsp vanilla extract. This has become a go-to recipe!

I originally was going to make another pancake recipe from this site but then I saw the video for Easy Pancakes and decided to make them instead. The video states to use 2 tbsp of baking powder but I used 2 tsp instead, as written in the recipe (I didn't want that baking powder aftertaste). These turned really good and my kids loved them! They weren't too fluffy, nor too flat, and it was really quick to prepare. I will definitely make this recipe again the next time my kids ask for pancakes on a weekday and I don't feel like spending so much time in the kitchen making breakfast on a weekday! Thanks for sharing, Sharon!

Made these tonight as my son requested pancakes.  I normally but the store mix and just add water or milk. I was looking for something easy, and this was it!! Turned out great, but have to say, I added a little flour to get the consistency I wanted.

Thanks for the bum steer.  After 600-some comments, you'd think someone could fix the typo about the 2T of baking powder.  I can only imagine how many beginning cooks look for a basic pancake recipe like this one.  Not a real confidence builder.  I salvaged it with a little extra milk (I'd used my last egg) but they still tasted off.

If you're looking for pancakes with more than a hint of brine, these are the ones for you.  Salty, salty, salty.  These are so thick and fluffy they fall apart as you try to flip them.  Cut way back on the baking powder & salt, or, better yet, find a decent recipe to start with.

Great easy recipe! I used others suggestions and used only 2 teaspoons of baking powder. I used 1/4 teaspoon vanilla and 1/2 teaspoon orange juice. I also subbed the veggie oil for 2 1/2 tablespoons melted butter. They are amazing. Add any fruit you want and they turn out great. This recipe made it to my real recipe box where it will be used for yrs to come. Thanks

Ok, (the second time) I did nix the salt entirely.  I also added a big splash of vanilla to the measuring cup, then filled it the rest of the way with milk.  But I left the baking powder alone and they were perfect!  The first time I made the recipe as-is and the batter was a little on the salty side, but the pancakes themselves weren't awful.  They were better with some slight adjustment to the recipe, but I thought adjusting the baking powder content AND the salt content was too fussy and just left out the salt.

We use this recipe all the time.  I feel like it's healthier than a box mix.  Less preservatives.  We have made two changes, we only use one TBSP of baking powder and we add a TSP of vanilla.  My kids love it and love to help us make them!  Thank you!

Almost creamy and ooh so satisfying.  I had three with a poached egg and little smokies.  These are fluffy and light, but still slightly dense.  I live in high altitude but went exactly by the recipe and all I can say is, maybe I CAN cook after all!

Definitely cut the baking powder down to 2 tsp like other reviewers said.  I also didn't use any oil as I have a nonstick pan.  They came out great!!  Next time I think I'll add a tiny splash of vanilla, but they really didn't even need it.  This is a keeper.

I took the suggestion from other people and decreased the baking powder to 2 tsp, decreased the salt to a pinch and added 1 tsp of vanilla. I kept everything else the same. After you mix the batter, let it sit for a few minutes. It helps make them fluffy.

These would be great if there was less baking powder.  Like one of the previous comments stated, I too cut it down to 2 teaspoons.  It had less of the baking powder "steel-y" taste.

Awesome! I was looking for an easy from scratch recipe and I FOUND IT!! I did as the first reviewer did and used butter instead of oil and less baking pwder. I used homemade vanilla too which really made it awesome. The only thing I would do different next time is use unsalted butter, but thats my fault b/c i only had salted butter!

Too salty and too much baking powder!  Adding 1 tsp of vanilla helps but if you have to make three major changes to a recipe, then it is no longer the same recipe!

I quickly made this recipe without thinking that the 2tbsp of baking powder was a lot.  It didn't occur to me until after the batter was made.  They didn't taste very good, but I'll try this recipe again and use everyone's advice with the 2 tsp of baking powder.

I made them twice already! The first time i made it, i followed the recipe exactly, I didn't really exactly like it, it was too sweet and salty. The next time i made it, i didn't add any sugar and i cut down the salt by half and this time, they were more to my liking. Thank you for this wonderful recipe, this helped my family eat healthier!

I do not understand why people rate this 4 or 5 stars and then say they changed some major ingredients in the recipe just to make it work.  Unfortunately I trusted the recipe since it was rated so highly, and I don't always have time to read all the reviews before I start on the recipe.  I did cut back on the salt because I just couldn't force myself to add a whole teaspoon of salt.   The pancakes were okay.  Not terrible, but definitely not as fluffy as the ones in the photo.  I do appreciate this person sharing the recipe anyway.  I will keep looking for a winning one.

These are really easy to make and really yummy! I did do what a lot of reviewers did and added only 2 TEASPOONS of Baking Powder, rather then 2 TBSP, as the recipe says as well as skipping the vegetable oil. They worked fine without it!. I also found it necessary to cut down the salt-from 1 tsp, to a 1/2 tsp. It was waay too salty with the whole tsp (and I LIKE salt)!! And I added 1 tsp of vanilla extract, as well. It helps bring out the flavors of everything so well!  Other then that, I kept everything in the recipe  the same. Your family will enjoy these! :)

The recipes came out fine for me but I did have to tweek it a little. I didnt use baking soda but I did use 1 tablespoon of cinnamon and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract or artificial vanilla.You also may want to use self rising flour because they were a little flat.

im sorry i dont normally complain, but did they seriously mean 2 tbsp. of baking powder? i made it that way and had to throw out the pancakes. i figured if the recipe was posted here then the amount should b right. after reading the other reviews i will try one more time and use 2 tsp. of baking powder. i think someone in the future should proofread better.the taste of the pancakes were absolutely horrible with 2 tablespoons of baking powder

I've never made pancakes from scratch before and had my 9 year old make these, her first time using the stove.  They turned out soo nice and fluffy.  I agree that the baking powder needs to be tsp. and the only thing I'd change is adding some vanilla.

Excellent recipe, though I followed the advice of other reviewers and used 2 tsp Baking powder and 1/2 tsp. salt. Everyone loved them, even my Mom who doesn't like pancakes. They reheated well the next day too.

I decreased the salt to half, and changed the baking powder to teaspoons instead of tablespoons, also added 1 tsp of vanilla as suggested in reviews.  These were very good - my family liked them a lot!   I was happy that the batter was very smooth - we wanted to make special shaped pancakes (letters, smiley faces, hearts, etc) and our regular pancake batter is too thick to do that gracefully - this one was runny and smooth - perfect!  They tasted good - nice and sweet - barely needed any syrup at all.

This was way too salty!  When you put butter on it, it made it even more so.  You need to change the recipe.  I may try it again with way less salt.  And the baking powder seems a little too much compared to other recipes (Do you mean 2 teaspoons, not tablespoons), but I am going to try the recipe again with less salt and see how it turns out.

These were really tasty and were quick and easy. I followed the recipe and added defrosting frozen fruit once the pancakes were in the pan. This is a great trick I learned so as to not colour the batter. With that said, I do prefer the flavour and lightness of the "Truck-Stop Buttermilk Pancakes" on this site.   One more thing, this definitely was not 4 servings for us, 2 of us ate all of them are were pleasantly full.

I used 2 teaspoons of baking powder, instead of 2 Tablespoons; I used a1/2 teaspoon of salt and I used 3 Tablespoons of melted butter instead of oil. I also added chocolate chips! This was the first time I ever made pancakes, and this was a nice easy recipe. My three year old sister loved them! Thanks!

Quick and easy pancakes that don't require anything I don't always keep in the pantry.  Of course the recipe should state 2 teaspoons (rather than tablespoons) of baking powder) but other than that I didn't change a thing and they came out great!

THIS IS ABSOLUTELY THE BEST PANCAKE RECIPE EVERRRRRR!!!   One Saturday morning I found myself with a house full of hungry teenagers and nothing but eggs and bacon in the fridge.  And I was in no mood to scramble or over-easy ANYTHING.   In a panic, I grabbed my Google phone - I have this site saved on my phone's bookmarks- and thankfully found this recipe.  I DIDN'T change a thing.  And I gotta tell ya, we all agreed that they were better than...can't believe I'm going to say this...IHOP!!!  Seriously!   Smothered in butter and maple syrup, you won't find a better or easier recipe for pancakes.

There is something really wrong with this recipe.  I'm not a natural cook, so I have to follow recipes to the letter.  I don't know to cut things out and add new things, so these were not good at all!

The baking powder was too much, so I had to add extra sugar and flour to the second batch, also including a tsp. of vanilla extract and a sprinkle of cinnamon. Trying to make chocolate chip pancakes and hopefully these changes make today's batch better-tasting.

the best I can say about these is that they raised. The taste was not good. I even added some vanilla and it didn't help. Sorry.

Very good...although you do have to use less baking powder and salt (I used about 3 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp of salt)

I was not at all impressed with these pancakes. I read lots of reviews and most people recomended using two teaspoons baking powder rather that two tablespoons listed in the recipe.  I wish I had used two tablespoons because they didn't cake up at all. Sorry sharon, but this one didn't work for me.

These were very good with the adjustment of the baking powder and salt.  I did add vanilla.  I read a couple reviews that said they were to flat.  When you mix the batter, don't mix it until it is smooth.  Leave it a little lumpy and that will make for fluffier pancakes.  Also, letting the batter sit for 5 min. will help them be fluffier too.

Super yummy, I modified to my taste.  I used 2 teaspoons baking powder, 1/2 teasp. salt, added an extra tablespoon of milk, added a teaspoon of vanilla and omitted the oil.  For me, it works best to have a well heated medium heat non stick pan and let them rise quickly, that way they stay tender inside.

Great recipe, will make it again.  Next time, though, I'll reduce the salt and add vanilla like other reviewers have done.  Otherwise, it's a great recipe.

Mine turned out good for a quick recipe. I should have cut the baking powder and salt in half. I used chia instead of eggs (1tbs chia seeds + 3 tbs water soaked for 10 minutes = 1 egg) and used vanilla rice milk rather then cow milk. I also used coconut oil and pink Himalayan salt, and a mix of white and wheat flour. I thought I followed the recipe exactly until I started typing this...LOL!

I don't understand people.  They rate a recipe and criticize that it wasn't good when, in fact, they did not follow the directions.  This recipe says NOTHING about baking soda, yet some are claiming they would rather exclude it.  How can you exclude something that wasn't included in the first place.  This recipe got five stars from me and I only wish there were more stars to give it. Thanks you, Sharon Hold, for a wonderful recipe.  You have made my day.

Much to my surprise, I hosted a sleepover without having pancake mix in the house.  I looked up this recipe and I likely won't buy mix again!  These were fluffy and delicious!  I did cut the baking powder and added the vanilla as suggested.  I had happy sleepover kids with full bellies!

Excellent recipe. I did what others have done and cut the baking powder down to 2 teaspoons, and used 1 teaspoon vanilla, and cut the salt to 1/2 teaspoon. I also put a little bit of cinnamon in it. They cooked beautifully and rose nicely and my husband said they were the best pancakes ever.

they were bland, even for a pancake. I did 3 teaspoons baking powder and i had to add a bit of flour because they just would not thicken up.

Sorry, I did scale back the baking powder as I knew it was way too much and it still came out spongy instead of fluffy.  My boys (pancake freaks) said it was OK but asked me to find another recipe for next time.  I will keep to some of my tested recipies.

I tried this recipe altered as others mentioned (less paking powder) and the original way.  With less baking powder the pancakes are thin but with the original amount of 2 tbsp the pancakes come out nice and fluffy.

I guess it depends if you like flat pancakes or fluffy pancakes.  But the recipe is still pretty tasty whichever way you choose.  I couldn't cook them fast enough for my daughter to eat... =)

As far as pancakes go this was a good recipe.  Easy, and only need ingredients we have on hand.  I added a dash or two of cinnamon for a nice added flavor.  Not real airy, a little more heavy type pancake.

Good Pancakes. I made a few suggested changes which I'm sure is the reason they came out so good. Only used 2 tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp salt, and swapped the oil for melted butter. Will certainly make again in a pinch. Thanks =o)

This is a great recipe, very easy. We like to add cinnamon to the sugar, and use soy milk - turned out fine. The only warning I would give is for people like me who are used to cooking pancakes from a box. These are thick, so sometimes it's hard to tell when to turn them. I burnt a few waiting for the bubbles. You just have to get used to your skillet or thin them out a little with extra milk.

These were the absolute best pancakes I have ever made!!!!! They were so light and fluffy, ani I made extra just so I'd have some for breakfast in the morning! (I made them as a midnight snack).

My family loves these pancakes. I did read the reviews and made some changes on the baking soda and salt.  We are a family of 6, so I double the recipe.  I use one cup of white flour and one of whole wheat. I also added the vanilla.  YUM!!  Thanks Sharon.

These pancakes are so good - if anyone thinks a box mix is easier they are wrong - taste is everything and these beat the pants off any box mix - let it sit after stiring and the mix will rise and the texture will get fluffy, then stir again before putting the batter in the pan - it seems to do something because this is a thick mix (supposed to be) so if your are used to a box mix the texture will throw you off at first, but  anyway REAL MAPLE syrup rules, so use it.  Also, I add freshly whipped cream on top of these pancakes - that is easy too - just whip (on high or med-high) some heavy cream for a few minutes and you'll have fresh whipped cream :)

I would have given this 5 starts, but after making this several times we continued to have problems tasting the baking powder.  The family loves them except when they get a bite of the baking powder.  I tried it this morning and used self rising flour instead of the flour/baking powder/salt.  No complaints.  It's a great base recipe to add your own flavors to.  Thanks for sharing this one.

These pancakes are awesome! I also used 2 tsp. of baking powder and only 1/2 tsp of salt. I used half whole wheat and half white flour. I used half brown sugar and half white sugar and added a tsp of vanilla. I also added 1/3 cup of chocolate chips. They are so yummy!!! They don't need butter or syrup! My husband doesn't even like pancakes and he was asking for more!

I make these all the time for myself and my children.  We all love them.  I leave out the oil, use only 1 TBS of baking powder and just a pinch of salt.  I freeze or refrigerate leftovers and pop them in the toaster for busy school mornings.

Ok, the Baking powder is WRONG 2 teaspoons is perfect. (thus only 4 stars). But this has made it to the sticky note in the pantry. Perfect pancakes.. quick easy cheap, I can put the batter togeather while the coffe is brewing.

This recipe turned out great. I followed other reviewers advice and cut the baking powder in half. I also added 1 tsp of vanilla, 1Tbsp of lemon juice alont with some orange zest and some chopped macadamia nuts. YUMMY!!! Loved the texture the nuts added without the overly bitter nut taste. Definitely a keeper as it is so versatile. My husband has put in a request for me to add apples instead of nuts.

Once I figured out that the recipe must have a typo in it (should probably be 2 TEASPOONS baking powder, not 2 tablespoons) it worked great.  A wonderful recipe that has now become a weekend tradition at home!

Great base for a pancake recipe. I used slightly less than 1 tbs baking powder, just a pinch of salt and no vegetable oil. The pancakes came out very fluffy.  I added fried apples and cinnimon sugar. They were a hit!  Thanks for giving me a place to start!

I have been making these same pancakes for years my recipe is called feather light pancakes from a blender cookbook. Now my ten year old son has taken over making them; perfect every time.  I often add chocolate chips , blue berries or dried cranberries to them after pouring the batter into the pan; then everone gets custom pancakes.

This recipe was amazing! I did start to get worried when the batter looked generally thick, but things worked out! These were amazing, and by the way- it does say 2 teaspoons, not tablespoons. (For the baking powder.) Just look in the recipe.

Added two dashes on Nutmeg and a cap full of vanilla, these came out amazing. The pancakes were fluffy and light, cooked them on low medium for 2-3 minutes on each side. Definitely adding these to my recipe book !

ATTENTION: This recipe does not work on its own. My pancakes were very flat and weird. I added a small amount of baking soda (a teaspoon or less) and that made a world of difference. Hope this helps!

I followed the recipe as written, it was edited to 2tsp baking powder. My family and I were not fans. They were flat and way too sweet. I have made other pancake recipes with the same results. I consider myself a pretty good cook/baker but the pancake eludes me. Sticking with Hungry Jack mix in the future.

Delicious, fast, easy recipe. I added some cinnamon to mine for some extra flavor and they turned out great. Yields about 8 pancakes.

I love it! A few tips: don't put a lot of dough onto the pan, don't try to flip it (If you do know expertly then good) as I messed up one pancake badly. Flip it when your spatula is quarter way into the pancake as as I was typing I was cooking and messed the pancake up a bit. The ingredients are super easy to find in the kitchen, it's not that hard to cook them either. ?? Thanks Allrecipies!

A teaspoon of salt is waaay too much! I wish I would've read the reviews before making these, now I have a stack of salty-pretzel flavored pancakes :( Anyone who reads this, a pinch of salt would have probably worked better!

I want Pancakes!!!!! And with this recipe i could have them in a snap! I will admit that they are not thick fluffy ones but they still totally hit the spot! The recipe said that it makes 4 servings, but really it made enough for 2 and a 9 month old who ate half a pancake. Next time i'll double, and freeze any left over...but thats IF I have any!!!

Delicious! Added a lil cinnamon and the kids loved them! I also substituted sugar for truvia and decreased the salt.Now these are children who like those yucky frozen pancakes and turn their noses at homemade foods.  These were a hit! Perfect pancakes!

These pancakes had decent flavor but they were the flattest pancakes I've ever seen. Followed the recipe exactly and they were flat! VERY flat! I even thought you could almost use this to make crepes.

The pancakes were amazing!! Very fluffy.  I added a tsp of vanilla, then to the milk I added about 2 tbls of lime juice, then I added the zest of the lime to the batter.  They were yummy.  I would have done Lemon, but only had limes.  I want to try with Lemon as well as Orange!!!

This must've been edited at some point, the recipe shows 2 teaspoons of baking powder.  The first batch I made was a hit with hubby and grandchildren.  The second batch was okay.  What I did in the first batch was substitute coconut oil for the vegetable oil and I messed up by putting it in solid.  Well, these were delicious!  I could see the little pockets of oil in each pancake as they cooked on the first side, and I thought, these are going to be a disaster!  But they were delicious!  When I made the next batch I melted the coconut oil and they just didn't have the same yumminess, So there you are, a great blunder!

My sister and I wanted pancakes for breakfast, and I was looking for a recipe that was simple to make. I tweaked the recipe a little bit by adding brown sugar, cinnamon and vanilla to give the pancakes some sweetness. Instead of cooking the pancakes in some vegetable oil, I used butter to give the pancakes that buttery taste. Although the recipe did mention that the pancakes serves four, I was able to make seven pancakes! I served them with bacon. The pancakes was a HUGE hit at my place. :-)

Tonight is the second time using this recipe. My husband isn't as big a fan of pancakes as I am, but the first time using this recipe, he told me this is how they should be. I had to double it this time so we had enough. I add 1 teaspoon of vanilla to the recipe and I sprinkle cinnamon on one side of the batter once I pour it on the pan. They are really good.

Too much salt!  It looks like the original poster updated this recipe after all the negative reviews about the salt and baking powder, but didn't change the amount of salt. It was WAY too much. The saving grace in my case was that I made these into chocolate chip pancakes so the salt was bearable balances against the sweetness of the chocolate.

this is an ok recipe but for those of us that live in fairly high altitude you may fine this very runny and come out more like crepes. 
So here are a few tips I use to thicken it up.
one cut down the milk to 3/4 cups or increase the flour by 1/3 cup (more depending how high up on mountains you are)  
Also wait AT least 10 minutes after mixing everything before putting it on the pan (best results is to make this the night before)
I also find when you pour the batter on the pan it's best to lift the pan off the stove top and let it take it's shape before putting it back on top. It helps from the batter running to the edges and makes it more round.
and I also just like adding a teaspoon of vanilla for a little extra flavor. and real maple syrup is always preferred ;)

Good recipe. Using the vegetable oil in the batter works better than using butter.

Sooo easy!  I've made these a couple of times, and just lately tried throwing in two bananas that were on their way out.  It was delicious!  They added a bit more moisture to the pancakes, as well as some tasty flavor.  Good recipe, easy to play around with, too!

Really should be half a star or less - Wow - like many others, wish I had read the reviews first. Way too much salt - only need a pinch. It appears that the baking powder has been changed back to teaspoons - not sure if 2 is still too much for just a cup of flour

I thought they were too salty, so next time I'm going to use less salt. But, these tasted incredible!!!! And so easy to whip up! We were out of pancake mix and thought we would have to skip Sunday pancakes, but after I found this, we will never use mix again!

So yummy. Made these for brekkie this am. Used about 3/4cup of milk for the thickness I prefer and added a tsp of vanilla. They were light and fluffy and gone in no time at all. These will definitely become a fam favourite. Can't wait to try again. Oh and I made them with 2 tsp of baking powder (as per the corrected recipe) as 2 tbsp would have been far too much.

This was very good. I took other reviewers' suggestions about adding only half teaspoon of salt and adding vanilla. I added three teaspoons of baking powder and that worked for me. Instead of white sugar, I just added two packets of Truvia. Really easy to prepare and the pancakes turned out great.

This recipe was not good. The pancakes were salty and dense. They were not fluffy at all. I think with some minor adjustments this could be better.

I thought it was a bit strange when the recipe called for 2 tablespoons of baking powder. But nonetheless, I'm new to cooking, and I like the follow the recipe exactly. The pancakes came out extremely fluffy, but I believe that it tasted like baking powder. And it took a while to cook, because it just kept rising as it was heated. I would cut down on the baking powder and the salt in the future.

Perfect as is.  Don't make any changes.  I've even used an egg substitute once and didn't have any problems (flaxseed meal + water).

For anyone not too experienced in the kitchen, take note:  This recipe makes only about 3 large pancakes.  You will need to double it if you are feeding more that one or two people.  It is a very good recipe, though.  I was looking for an easy pancake recipe that wasn't too hard to do first thing out of bed.  This is it!  I followed the other reviewer's recommendations and decreased the baking powder to 2 TEAspoons, and added a bit of vanilla.  I toss it all in a large mason jar and SHAKE.  then I just pour it into the pan.  Perfect every time.

The recipe was quick and easy but came out with a weird consistency, the pancakes just fell a part. Also, the taste was terrible, the baking powder and salt were overpowering the rest of the ingredients.  I will not use this recipe again. Epic fail.

I tried this recipe twice - the first time without bothering to read the comments - Waaaay too much baking powder and salt.  The second time I altered it and it was just okay.  I would use a very small amount of baking powder and salt.  I also added cinnamon and vanilla extract but it didn't do much to help save these pancakes.  Perhaps buttermilk would be a better alternative?

Way too much salt and baking powder.  I should have read the older comments but saw four stars and was fooled. Honestly, at first they seem fine but than the baking powder taste kicks in and over powers anything else.  What a huge Sunday Breakfast mistake!

i usually look at others reviews before making a recipe but i guess it was too ealry today to think of that. BAD IDEA. I substituted half all purpose flour for whole wheat flour, added some cinn and vanilla and they did not turn out great. I used the 2 tablespoons of baking powder and i am not sure if that is what made them SO salty. will be doing some major adjustments if i make again..

This recipe has to be modified.  It looks like there was a mistake in the baking powder and the original was meant to state 2 TEASPOONS (and not tablespoons).  The salt portion is too high, also.  If you change all of the above, the recipe is good.

I wish I would have read the reviews before making this recipe!  I cut the baking powder for a double batch down to 2 tablespoons, and they were still too salty/eggy tasting.  I guess I should have cut it back even more!  Great texture, terrible flavor.

DO NOT use 2 Tablespoons of BP! That is just WAY too much. Use 2 teaspoons.  I also used 1/4 C. of milk and the rest sour cream (I ran out of milk) and it made these Divine (add a tad bit of water to the end result to make the batter a little thinner) I kick myself for not making a double batch.

Like the others, I used 2t of baking powder and no oil.  I added 1t vanilla.  Also, for high altitude, I added and extra 1T of flour and 2t of milk.  They were light and fluffy and delicious!  Thank you for sharing this great recipe as a base!

Needed to trim baking powder down to 2 tsp. I also added some lemon extract and covered it in strawberries instead of butter and syrup to cut calories and add vitamins and fiber my family loved it we have one extremely picky child and it was a hit!

Great recipe for quick and easy pancakes.  One batch makes enough for leftovers during the week before work.  I did change it though...  1 tsp vanilla, 1 and 1.5 cups flour, 3.5 tsp baking powder, 3/4 tsp salt, 1 and 1/4 cup milk, and 3 tsp melted butter.

This is my new favorite pancake recipe! I adjusted the recipe to 2 teaspoons of baking powder and 1/2 teaspoon of salt. I also added a splash of vanilla. These are excellent! Thank you!

I made these pancakes as written, and they were quick and easy to make. I did not care for the taste, however.  Salty, bitter, and the texture left a lot to be desired.  Not worth the ease of preparation -  I'd rather spend a few minuites more to end up with something I like better.

I used 1 tbsp of sugar rather than 2 and .5 tsp of salt rather than 1.  I also used 2 tsp of baking powder rather than 2 tbsp.  They were very salty.  Not good. I also used the suggested 1 tsp of vanilla.

Super easy and very tasty. I add about 1/2 a tsp. of vanilla just to give it some extra flavor and I cook them in hot butter to get that nice crunchy edge. Over all a great recipe.

These pancakes turned out wonderfully fluffy and very tasty! After I made one, I added a tsp of imitation vanilla and a tsp (or little more) of cinnamon. My kids ate them up! Had to make a second batch!

Excellent! We followed the recipe exactly as it says in terms of the baking soda and salt, and they came out great - fluffy and delicious! We subbed the all purpose flour w/ whole wheat flour and it was even better!

Very easy recipe to follow. I cut the baking powder to 2 teaspoons and just added a pinch of salt per other viewers. The pancakes came out wonderful and so fluffy and moist   I added some chocolate chips to half of the batter for my hubby and these turned out well also!

I cut the baking powder to 2 teaspoons and the oil to 1 tablespoon, added just a pinch of salt, and added 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract following the advice of others and found myself eating a plate of fluffy, yummy pancakes.  They were my first pancakes I had made from scratch and came out beautifully, I would so make it again!

I followed the other reviews. I only used a pinch of salt and 2 teaspoons of salt. I used butter instead of vegetable oil. I added a pinch of cinnamon and a teaspoon of vanilla as well. Amazing!

I prepared the recipe as is, except I only put in a pinch of salt due to my Mom's sodium sensitivity.  I had two ripe bananas, mashed and added in as well. Just gave two cakes to my Mom with some maple syurp;  she really likes it.  Thanks for the simple, quick recipe!

Should've read the reviews before trying this recipe. Didn't mind the baking powder, but there was definitely too much salt. They did turn out nice and fluffy though. Next time, I'll try 2 tsp. baking powder and only 1/2 tsp. salt and see how it turns out.

UPDATE: k, made it again with the changes above and it was a bit too flat for my liking. Going to look for a better recipe.

Does need 2 T of baking powder, the pancakes were too flat with just 2 t so I added more to total 2T (baking powder was fresh). I added 1 t of vanilla and 1 T of flax seed.  OK tasting pancake, nothing special about it.  My only complaint is that the batter was too runny and made distorted pancakes.

I choose to separate the egg white from the yolk and beat only the egg white till it becomes frothy... I feel if you beat the two together the pancakes are fluffy but they are also a little too firm for my liking... :)

This is the BEST pancake recipe!  I too follow a suggestion for less baking powder, a teaspoon instead of tablespoon.  I make this recipe in 24 servings and freeze the rest for breakfast.  They are amazing and is asked for everyday by my kiddos!

Great light and fluffy pancakes. I followed the suggestions of others and reduced the baking powder to 2 tsp, and the salt to a pinch, and added vanilla. Also (using a tip I learned from you-tube) I seperated the egg and whipped the egg white into soft peaks. I folded in the egg white as the last step to incorporating all the ingredients. Soooo good!

These pancakes were easy to make and turned out great, they were nice and fluffy.  I was extremely happy with the flavor of these as well. Typically pancakes turn out too salty or not sweet enough, this recipe was the perfect balance!

These were very fluffy and everyone liked them.  On the other hand unless you are only feeding 4 small kids this resipe needs to at the very least be doubled.  I also added a dash of vailla exstract.

I didn't read the reviews in advance, but I made these with 2 tablespoons of baking powder and they turned out just fine! I did add 1 tsp of vanilla though. Fabulous! My new go to recipe!

Not very tasty.  Other recipes on this site are much better and still basic enough to make up quickly.

I loved that I had all of the ingredients for this at home and didn't need to make a trip to the grocery store in my pajamas when my family requested pancakes one morning.  As promised, the recipe is easy and tasty.  I have made them a few times and they are great with a little vanilla as well.

I gave this recipe 5 stars even though I tweaked it a little bit. I also cut down the baking powder to 1 TBSP but I also added a TSP of vanilla and a good squirt of honey. These pancakes were light fluffy and sweet and my husband noticed right away that they were from scratch! He loved them and he's not much of a sweets kind of guy. Thank you!

A perfect recipe.  I used evaporated milk for mine, and they were light and fluffy yet hearty and filling.  My family loved them!

Not bad. I followed the directions everyone posted - slashed the salt and baking powder amount and added ~1 tbs of cinnamon. I thought 2 tbs of cinnamon would be too much, but now I wish I would have added the extra tbs. Pretty good, but not the best - they're easy, fast, and I had all the ingredients already, which is why I decided to try them. I think next time I'll go with buttermilk pancakes, however.

these are really easy pancakes to make... the only thing that I change about them is to add about a TBS and a half of brown sugar... It gives them a great taste

Thanks for an easy pancake recipe! I did use the modifications of one of the reviewers. (butter instead of oil, 1/2 tsp of salt, 2 tsp of baking powder) Also I added honey instead of sugar. I think that is why mine came out a little flat but they were still delicious!

These were just average. Quite frankly I feel I am being generous giving these 3 stars, because no pancake recipe anywhere (unless you are feeding like 20 people or more) should call for a TEASPOON of salt. I used 1/4 tsp.

This recipe is quick, easy, and delicious! I use whole wheat flour instead of white and add in a tsp. of vanilla and a dash of cinnamon, and they come out fluffy and perfect every time. This is our new Saturday morning breakfast favorite!

Very good pancakes.  Make sure you follow the suggestions to lessen the baking powder to 2 TEASPOONS and lessent the salt to 1/2 tsp.  I used brown sugar since that was handy and added a tsp vanilla.  Very yummy.  I think I still prefer buttermilk pancakes but if you don't have any of that on hand, this is a great alternative.

Easy pancakes. I added brown sugar, applesauce, and cinnamon to the batter, then topped each stack with slices of green apple sauteed in butter, cinnamon, and sugar. Delicious!

I followed the other reviewers suggestions, and used two TEAspoons (rather than tbsp) of baking powder. Also added a dash of vanilla & cinnamon. These turned out beautifully. So fluffy and flavourful! A great basic, straightforward and easy pancake recipe. Lovely.

Delicious pancakes; very light and enough fluff! I took others advise and used 2 tsp of baking powder, 3 tbs of melted butter and ½ tsp of salt and less than 1 tsp of vanilla extract. Very good although I will probably not use vanilla next time; I could taste the vanilla and I don’t think its necessary.

I followed the recipe as it was, only adding slightly more vanilla and they came out light and fluffy, the only issue was the extra baking soda. It appearent when turning the pancake (visable bubble holes). I gave it a high rating because the pancake it's self was so delicious it could be eaten by it's self but was like heaven with butter and syrup.

I definitely wouldn't recommend these. Never before have i ever thrown out pancake mix, but after making the first one and tasting we threw out the batter. It had almost no taste and definitely wouldn't try these again.

These are easy and delicious.  Yes, you need to lower the baking powder to 2 tsp, but otherwise I didn't need to make any changes. Much better than Bisquick pancakes or out of the box mixes. Also, very easy to make with ingredients you would have around the kitchen.  Not quite as good as restaurant pancakes, but I imagine I would need buttermilk or some other non-staple to make those.

My picky 7 year old, grams, and my love absolutely devour these pancakes every time.  I make them just as stated.  I have made them with Silk Vanilla Soy milk too when I have been out of regular milk and they are great even then.  One thing I do is I heat some syrup up in the microwave for a minute, it's a nice warm touch.

I made this as the recipe was written- with 2 tablespoons of baking powder. It was disgusting! Not even my toddler-who would eat garbage if it had butter & syrup on it-would eat them. I did try them again, though, fixing what some say is a "typo." I used 2 teaspoons of baking powder. I also threw in some vanilla and reduced the salt a little. Much better!

Excellent.  Very quick and easy.  I used half organic white flour and half organic wheat.  It made about 7 medium sized pancakes.  I also put bananas in the syrup and heated it up.  very tasty!

This recipe is fantastic!!!  It is easy to make and tastes WAY better than any pancake mix.  I also used 2 tsps of baking powder instead of 2 tablespoons.  I also added a teaspoon of vanilla.  DELICIOUS!!!!  thanks for sharing

My husband made these and the batter turned out to be very thick.  After adding some milk, they turned out fine.  Pretty fluffy and tasty, we also added a teaspoon of vanilla.

UPDATE:  After reading reviews which I normally do first, I see the problem was caught by many in regards to 2 TBS. vs. 2 TSP. of baking powder.  Will try them again with correct measurements.

I thought it was eggs and toast again when the Bisquick was not to be found, even my many cookbooks didn't satisfy me. But when my husband said these were good and could "float" off the plate, I knew I could say "good-bye" to the box. Am forwarding this onto my friend who can't make them. Thank you for truly easy pancakes, that were just delicious.

Great basic recipe- per other reviews used 2t baking powder and 1/2 salt.  Added about a cup of blueberries, and another 1/2 of flour because the batter was thin.  Will make again.

They were sooooooooo delicious!!! BUT i changed stuff in the recipe, because i found out that lots of people are saying that the pancakes had too much salt and baking powder so i put 1 tablespoon of salt instead of 2, and i didnt put salt at all!!!!! and they were perfect!!!! TRY IT THAT WAY!

Don't know why there are so many bad reviews.  Just finished a batch of these, following the recipe as listed; they were phenomenal.  Trust me, I am NOT a great cook, but my wife and kids all agree, best pancakes ever!  I'm never buying boxed pancake mix again.

Good basic recipe.  I did change the baking soda to 2 tsp. instead of Tbs.  I think I would like vanilla added to the batter, but I kept it true to the recipe to make sure I liked it first.  Very good.

I added 1 tbsp of white sugar and 1 tbsp of brown sugar.  Then to cut some of the fat, I substituted apple sauce for the vegetable oil.  The pancakes came out great :-)

The main issue with this recipe is the lack of an acid. That's why so many of the reviewers cut down on the baking soda.  Solution: Buttermilk.   I used the allotted amount of baking soda, and replaced the milk with buttermilk. The cakes rose beautifully, and tasted nothing like baking soda.  You could also have added a tablespoon or so of white vinegar or lemon juice to regular milk to get the same affect.

delicious pancakes! i also added only 2 teaspoons of baking powder and 1/2 teaspoon of salt. I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, used butter instead of oil, and only used 2 tablespoons. i really recommend this, its fast, simple, and really tasteful.

Yum!  These were easy to make and were light and fluffy!  I did adjust the recipe as others suggested by reducing the baking powder to 2 teaspoons, reducing salt to 1/2 teaspoon, substituted butter for oil and added 1 teaspoon vanilla.  In all fairness I did not try to original recipe, so it may have been fine as written.  These were delicious!  A definite keeper!  Thanks!

I read others' reviews before making and used only 2 teaspoons baking powder, halved the salt, added 1 tsp of vanilla and subbed butter for the oil. They were a little bit flat, but tasted great. Will definitely make again!

I agree with Julienne, this recipe is very salty, though I think the baking powder amount was fine.  Perhaps decreasing the salt by half would be better.  It reminded me of pancakes made with Bisquick, which I'm not fond of b/c of the saltiness.  Other than that, my family and I really enjoyed them.

I used 1/2 the recommended salt and added blueberries. This recipe's simplicity allows it to be a solid platform to add or subtract any number of ingredients to create the ideal pancake. I can't wait to do cinnamon raisin!

These are so yummy! I only use 1 tsp of baking powder and I added vanilla as well. I only used 1 Tbs of oil as well since I use a lot of oil when I cook them since we like them a little crisp on the edges.

I can only say that the previous two reviews must be from two people who didn't follow the recipe.  These are delicious, fluffy pancakes and my family LOVES them.  I have always added vanilla to pancake mixes and I did the same with this recipe for that nice little added flavor.  The bad news is that once I started making these we have never been satified with a box mix - sorry Bisquick!  Also, if you want Buttermilk pancakes - just use buttermilk in place of milk - they're great too!

There are so many words I'd like to use to describe these pancakes, but I think I'll go with "ick!" Please save yourself the $2 in ingredients and the 10 minutes of your life and try a bowl of cereal instead.

I just got done making these pancakes a few minutes ago. I don't know how people are giving this recipe such a high rating. Either I royally messed something up without realizing it or this recipe is just flat out the worst pancake recipe ever. They were not fluffy, did not brown and had no flavor. I may as well have been eating paper. They were THAT thin, pale and tasteless. What a waste of ingredients.

These pancakes are hands down, the best ones I've ever made. They browned perfectly and were very fluffy. I did make one substitution though.I realized I was out of milk so I used one cup of evaporated milk instead of fresh milk.

I used two teaspoons of baking powder instead of two tablespoons, but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly, and it was great. I like that I always have those ingredients on hand, so it is a quick easy meal.

I make these as listed, except the 2 tablespoons of baking powder is clearly a typo/error. It's 2 TEAspoons of baking powder. I have made the batter using both vegetable oil and melted butter, and I think the oil works better and makes a lighter, fluffier pancake. While buttermilk pancakes are nice, we don't always have buttermilk on hand; this recipe is a nice standby, since almost everyone has all the ingredients on hand at any given time. It's quick and easy and pretty good!

Thank you for posting this recipe. These are the best pancakes I have ever made. They are moist and fluffy in the centre allowing the maple syrup to be soaked up. Plus this is the easiest recipe to follow.

I was not particularly impressed with this recipe. I reduced the baking powder to 2 tsp, reduced the salt and added vanilla extract, like some other users had done and followed the rest of the recipe to a tee. I didn't even change the proportions. I still I felt like these were missing something. The pancakes were just sort of bland and the batter was very thin and runny. So the search for the perfect pancake continues...

I implemented the other reviewers suggestions and cut down on the salt-1/2 tsp and baking powder-2 tsp. The recipe was great and I will not be buying any more mixes! Also for my kids batch I added a handful of M&Ms and a tsp of vanilla for "tye dye" pancakes. They rated it "a 100 stars"

...change to 5 stars with our changes:  We adjusted the baking powder to 2 tsp. and added 1-2 tsp. vanilla per other reviews.  We omit the salt and oil (I do that with most recipes).  We added 1/2 cup frozen raspberries and had some of our fave pancakes ever.  My 10 year old son made them!!!

This recipe was quick and easy. I followed some of the other reviews and modified it. The butter in replace of the oil, made them taste great. I also added the 1 tsp of Vanilla. I would recommend this if you want to whip pancakes up quick. My two year old loves them.

These pancakes are good, basic, easy pancakes to make. I followed the recipe exactly and thought they turned out perfectly fine. I did notice that they turned out a little better after the batter had sat for a few minutes.... I sprinkled some blueberries into them as they were cooking and that was a great addition. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.

I made these exactly as written. The batter was a puffy mound that didn't cook through completely. I gently spread the batter on the second batch so they would cook through, but the taste was very bland.

Easy to make, but bitter after taste due to large amount of baking powder.  Batter was very bubbly.  Also doesn't hold together for large 'smiley' face pancakes--crumbly.  Smaller pancakes bake up nice and look great, but don't taste good at all.  Will try to modify or look for a better recipe.  All three of my kids who love pancakes rejected these even when served with strawberry, banana, and yogurt faces and syrup.  No amount of syrup could get them to eat it.

These are great pancakes. I doubled the recipe, added 2 tsp. vanilla, substituted melted butter for the oil, and they turned out delicious. No more boxed pancake mix for this family! Next time I might add chocolate chips or blueberries.

Also made "Pike's Gooey Syrup" (recipe is on this site) to go with the cakes. Delicious.

Five Stars, even with the obvious misprint about 2 Tablespoons of baking powder, should be 2 teaspoons. With or without additions, like cinnamon. This is the one I put in my Recipe Box. And, it looks just like the picture. Lana

These turned out great. Fluffy and light. I used melted margarine instead of oil (tradition). Everyone gobbled these right up. Thanks, they were good enough to keep.

I followed the advice of everyone here, but I only used a Tsp of baking powder. Also, reduced the salt to a pinch, and added about a tsp of vanilla. Still, the base taste of these pancakes leaves something to be desired.
I'm still looking for a good base for pancakes; this one wasn't what I was looking for.

There is to much baking powder in this recipe for 1 cup of flour.  I hesitated and I made as is, but after I cooked a few, I added some vanilla to the mixture to take away the baking powder taste.  As is, these are just ok.  If you reduce the baking powder and add some vanilla I think you will have a hit.

These pancakes turned out even better than when I use the premade mix from the store. I followed the other reviews and used only 2 teaspoons of baking powder, and I also added a dash of vanilla. They were light and fluffy, and turned out perfectly. I will make pancakes this way from now on!

We thought the pancakes tasted good.  I did add 1 TSP of vanilla.  I only got 6 pancakes from this recipe using a 1/4C. scoop.  It will need to be doubled if you need more, as I will do the next time. THX.

Perfect pancakes that are kid friendly.  Made with soy milk and it was even better 'cause of added sweetness.  Dad's double whole grain is a healthier alternative but these were more appreciated by my kids...

I made this for a large crowd, following the suggestion to reduce the baking powder to 2 tsp.  I doubled the recipe otherwise (adding 2 tsp of vanilla) and everyone loved.  Some reviewers are mentioning baking SODA and that ingredient isn't even mentioned so no wonder theirs tastes like wallpaper paste.  Baking Soda and baking powder are vastly different.

I followed the recipe exactly.  They were tasty, which is why I gave them 2 stars, but they were too crumbly. They just fell apart once I took them off the griddle.  Every bit was an absolute mess. Maybe I should have made some changes like the others did.

I love this recipe.  I would give it a five if not for the baking soda typo and the high salt content.  Thusfar, I have used this with regular flour and 1/2 whole wheat flour.  Next time, I plan to try self rising flour and omitting the salt and baking powder.  If you use regular flour, just add a pinch of salt and 2 tsp of baking powder.  It tastes great with cinnamon and vanilla extract.
Once I got distracted by my children and I didn't use cinnamon and vanilla extract and they were very bland.  Another mistake I made was to let our children over-stir the batter which made it very runny.  This recipe is much better than a box mix and just think:  If you use your own ingredients everything you've added you can pronounce!

Didn't care for these at all. I didn't have any pancake mix. So, I thought I would give this a try. My son is the one that insisted he wanted pancakes. He had a few bites and asked for cereal instead.
There was a funny taste to it....?

i tried this recipe using some of the advice of others reviewing previously. I cut the amount of baking powder to 2 tsp., added 1 tbsp. of vanilla , a dash of cinnamon and only 1 tbsp. of oil. They turned out pretty good. My husband and kids sure loved them!

I also cut the baking powder down, to 2 heaped tsp., and added a dash of vanilla, but I've made the recipe as written just to check it out that way snd the increase in baking powder doesn't hurt anything, it's just not neccessary.

I just made this recipe this morning.  It was good.  I would agree that it is a little sweet even for me.  But it is a good recipe as I like the light and fluffiness of the pancake itself.  Would definitely use again, but maybe with a little less sugar.  I did substitute 2 tbs of butter for the oil.

Really tasty pancakes, but a little salty.  Next time I'll follow the other reviewers' suggestions.  I also added chocolate chips while cooking and some nutmeg and cinnamon. But i think with this recipe you can do whatever you want!

I just made these.  I used the advice from here and used 2 tsp of baking powder and a pinch of salt. I added approx 1 tsp vanilla. YUM!   **Update** I've cooked these many times now and I use unbleached wheat flour and 2tsp b.powder.  Everything else is the same as original recipe.  We love these.

very basic ingredients, not very oily, and easy to make; however, the recipe wrote the # of baking soda wrong (it should be 2 tsp. not 2 tbsp.). I know from personal experience..the pancakes came out very bitter... :(

Afterthoughts: I realize I kept putting baking soda instead of baking powder..that explains the bitter taste..haha

I cut back the backing powder to 2tsp and the oil to 1 tbsp and this came out really well, although it would have been great if they had risen a little more.  I might try it with self-raising flour too and see if it helps.  I also added 1tsp of vanilla.

We thought that these were great.  I doubled the recipe but kept the salt the same.  I also used butter instead of oil and I added a little vanilla.  A great basic pancake that was quick and easy.  Thanks for the recipe I will definately make them again!

I "fluffed" it up by beating air into the batter. There was one thing that kept it from being perfect; it had so much salt it would take a jar of maple syrup to balance out the saltiness!!!! OVERALL it was a pretty good pancake. Better than my Aunt Jemina =).

Ok, now I am NOT a cook and I have no idea if the baking powder or salt measurements were right or not. BUT what I do know is that I liked these pancakes and even "I" could make them!!

brilliant pancakes, with a dash of cinnamon and allspice they were heavenly. I followed another reviewer's suggestion and used only 2 teaspoons of baking powder and they turned out great.

I substituted applesauce for the oil, and added some cinnimon and vanilla.  They were very good, though slightly heavier than I liked.  That could be because I didn't add the right amount of sauce to replace the oil.  I'll tinker with them some more - otherwise they're great.

Not a bad recipe, but I think the point of a great recipe is that you don't have to alter it to make it palatable. 
If you reduce the salt a bit (1/2t or so), cut down the amount of baking powder drastically (about 3/4 tbsp), and add some cinnamon for flavor it's not a bad recipe at all - I imagine it would be a good base for some banana nut or cinnamon apple pancakes with the addition of the cinnamon. They weren't the best pancakes I've ever had but considering that Bisquick consistently lets me down with awful pancakes (I don't know how I know how to cook, yet I mess up box mix consistently!), it's an improvement.

I was looking for an easy Saturday morning recipe to make with stuff I already had in the pantry.  This recipe worked great!  I took the advice of others and only added 2 tsp. of baking powder and added a splash of vanilla extract.  
Note:  Let the batter sit for just a few minutes before cooking and make sure the pan is nice and hot before you start. 
Thanks!

I've always made boxed pancakes, but not anymore.  I love this recipes, I've made it every weekend for the past month.  My husband and toddler son love it too.  I will try and add vanilla (like others suggested) but it's fine without as well.  I have reduced the baking powder - just to see how they turned out and they were fine either way!  Thanks for sharing!!

My family did not care for these at all.  I decreased the baking powder as suggested and added cinnamon and vanilla, but it did not help.  For some reason they were spongy and not fluffy.  We will not make these again!

I needed a quick and simple pancake recipe today, so I made these with a few adjustments....
I only put in 2 teaspoons baking powder, I added 2 teaspoons of good vanilla extract, I added 1/2 teaspoon of apple pie spice, one tablespoon lemon juice, I used organic unbleached four, used organic cane sugar (makes a huge differance) and replaced the vegetable oil with olive oil. They were perfect! I severed them topped with apple sauce....and my kids loved their healthy breakfast!

A good start but it's not quite there yet as many reviewers have already noted.  I read all the reviews and reduced both the baking powder (3/4 T) and salt (pinch).  I also separated the egg and added the yolk in along with the milk and other liquids.  I whipped the egg white in a separate bowl until it reached soft peaks and then folded it back into the batter.  I also added 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract and the rind of half an orange.  (Buy a Microplane!)  The pancakes had a nice hint of orange taste and were light and fluffy as well.

triple the amount of sugar for a pancake that's great on its own. 

variations: - use 1 tbsp white sugar, 2 tbsp brown sugar, a handful of chocolate chips (or whatever suits your fancy) for chocolate chip pancakes.

Excellent pancakes!  Our whole family loved them, topped with just a hint of syrup or whipped cream and strawberries.  We also added 2 caps full of high quality vanilla extract per cup of flour.

Excellent basic pancake recipe.  I scaled to 1 serving and it was plenty.  I also reduced oil and they came out great.  Will keep and make again.  Next time I may try whole wheat flour or adding fruit/nuts.  Much better than my usual boxed pancake mix.  Thanks for sharing.

These pancakes were very easy to make and came out light and fluffy.  I took everyone's advice and halved the amount of baking powder; next time, I'll probably add a little cinnamon for extra flavor.  Great basic recipe overall: nothing fancy, but I'll definitely make these again.

These were surprisingly good. For such a simple recipe, I expected them to be only so-so, but they came up to be rather thick pancakes and very fluffy, not to mention tasty. Be warned, though: serving size of 4 does not mean 4 pancakes. I made them just for myself one morning and had made 6 somewhat small pancakes (I was using a 1/2 cup to measure them and they weren't always a full 1/2 cup) and still had about 1/2 to 1/3 of the batter left. The 6 was all I could eat :-P Still, really good. Definitely recommend this recipe.

Hands down!  These are by far the best pancakes I have ever had!  Light, tender and flavorful.  I am pleasantly surprised at the ease and success of this recipe.  This is a definite keeper.  It was jokingly renamed at breakfast to "Mom's FAMOUS Pancake Recipe....that I discovered this morning...on Allrecipes.com"!  Thanks for sharing!

My husband and I both find this recipe pretty delicious! They are super restaurant-style fluffy! I would suggest adding a bit less baking powder, because I find they kinda fall apart when you use the full 2 tablespoons. Yes, they are a bit plain, but that's the great thing about them, you can add any flavor! I've tried cinnamon, fruit, chocolate chips. And they are so simple. This is a great basic recipe that is  great for a Sunday morning!

Absolutely the best! At first I thought the baking powder was too much, but it isn't. The pancakes come out light and fluffy, One thing, sometimes I need to add about a 1/4 cup of milk. right before cooking to thin the batter a bit. This recipe is a "keeper"

I followed most of the changes made by Luvmy5boys and used 1:1 gluten-free flour. I also reduced the amount of vegetable oil to maybe 1 tbs (eyeballed that one). Overall, very quick, easy, and tasty.

The batter was WAY to thick, I could barely pour it, this caused very large pancakes that either burnt or were undercooked. These pancakes didn’t taste good, even when they weren’t super burnt. My friends, family and self were very disappointed with these pancakes.

it was horrible, Sharon's recipe was horrible. It was too runny and not thick enough to make fluffy nice tasting pancakes. We cooked it and it was not turning out great, it became hard and flat. Waste of time.

I didn’t really care for this recipe. The pancakes were to salty and weren’t really a good texture. They did rise good though. I put chocolate and peanut butter on mine, so the toppings made up for the saltiness.

It's super easy to follow. Thanks for sharing this recipe. However, it's a bit salty for our taste. I'll just manage to adjust the portion of the salt next time.

It turned out wonderfully. I left out the baking powder because I used self-raising flour and I only put in a pinch of salt. I got 11 tiny pancakes out f this recipe and my household loved it. Thank you!

Into my recipe book it goes. Made the originals for my boyfriend and replaced the flour with 1 1/3 freshly ground (homemade) oat flour for my own gluten free ones and they were amazing both ways. I find they cook best on a nonstick pan that isn’t pre-oiled otherwise the batter would spread too far, and I start on medium heat and usually end up turning it down some more, but it’ll all depend on your own pan and stovetop!

This recipe turned out to be amazing! It satisfied my late night craving of pancakes. What I did a little differently was do 3 tsp of baking powder, add 1 tsp vanilla, and added about a 1/3 cup of cocoa powder to make “brownie batter pancakes” I topped them with some mashed chocolate chip cookies and some maple syrup. Absolutely amazing taste! Probably the best but yet the simplest recipe I’ve used for pancakes. 5 stars would recommend.

There was way too much baking powder and instead of 1 teaspoon of salt I added only a pinch. The baking powder made it too bitter.

Not bad. I didn’t even realized it said 2 tablespoons of baking powder. I automatically thought it must of said teaspoons. I made these for my 2yr old who loved them and asked for more. They came out fluffy. She ate them with nothing on it, but I needed syrup or fruit to eat it with. I’ll probably make these again only if I run out of butter again.

These pancakes are so easy!  The only thing I changed was I used a 1/2 cup scoop instead of a 1/4 (I like bigger pancakes!).  But they are so delicious.  I topped them with keto strawberry syrup and they were awesome.

The recipe I am reading says 2-teaspoons of baking powder not 2-tablespoons. Maybe they changed it?
I did not see anywhere to use baking soda.
Pancakes are very good. BTW I did use butter instead of oil and added some pecans.

I would double the baking powder, put 2 tbsp. sugar and add the dry ing. to the wet ing.  I think they would be fluffier.

Made this many times. Tasted great. Baking powder wasn't too much. I only cut down on the salt as we do not eat much salt and I added maybe about 1/4 cup extra flour. Otherwise recipe is on point as is even without the extra flour..

The recipe posted worked well...
Modifications include: 
- A splash of vanilla Incorporated with wet ingredients
- Half and Half 10% instead of milk
- Dried granola cereal for added crunch on top
- Over easy egg on top to add a little protein and cause I think it looked cool

Execution was exactly as written.
For extra fluffy I cooked with lid on top.

Thank you for Sharing this recipe.

This base of ingredients in this recipe is good, but if you modify it a bit is perfect, just change the amount of baking powder to two teaspoon and add a teaspoon of vanilla extract and taste delicious.

Easy to follow and remember.  I stopped buying pancake mix. Sometimes I use buttermilk and add 1/4 tsp. baking soda and reduce baking powder to 1 3/4 tsp. Add-in to mix chocolate chips or blueberries.

Really good base pancake recipe. I added a tsp of vanilla (cause vanilla goes great with just about any baked good!) I also added a lone over ripe banana that I needed to use. It was quick and easy to make and this is my new go-to for pancakes!

Loved this simple, quick and easy recipe! Ingredients that can be found at home easily. Didn’t have oil so I used 2tbsp of butter instead.

I used a cast iron skillet that needed to be monitored from the start of heating oil to keeping the temperaturue low to mesium for dull cooking and not sticking. Unless I have a griddle, I probably need to switch a non-stick skillet. The batter came out well and thick, the heating process seem to absorb oil fast .

Easy and quick, which is what my boys demand! Great flavor too! I substituted self-driving flour in the place of all purpose, salt, and baking powder.

This is my go-to recipe whenever I make pancakes. I changed up the oil amount, I only do 1 Tablespoon instead of two. I also add 1 teaspoon of vanilla which makes it taste amazing.
They always turn out fully and are very fulling.
 Thanks!

They turned out cakey and dry. Not fluffy at all, no real flavor. Easy, but I’d rather have pancake mix than these.

I make this recipe  almost every Sunday and it turns out every time! I love this recipe and I won’t be switching for a long time. We like to add chocolate chips to the batter and then top it with some Greek yogurt.

I also made some of the same revisions as others by cutting down the baking power to 2tsp and using 3 tbsp of melted butter! I also added in about 1/4 cup of chopped pecans! Loved this recipe~

It tasted great but a bit like bread so it tasted even better with salted butter or cheese. I also tried cooking a couple with grated cheese on top but I barely tasted the cheese so it's best to put the cheese afterwards.

I would not make these again. They are not light and fluffy at all. These turned out more like crepes and I think the oil in the batter made the edges get crispy.

These pancakes are the best I’ve ever made. It goes great with chocolate chips, but you need to cut up berries/fruits before putting the in, or else they will stick out, and when you flip them, there will be a small ring around the fruit that is not cooked through. I always put the stove on medium for the first couple pancakes, and when it finally gets to it’s peak temp, I turn it down to low. My oven, however, always gets hotter than I tell it to, so maybe my stove just gets hotter than it’s supposed to. I noticed som other reviews saying there was way too much baking powder, and that’s because there was a typo that said you should put in 2tbsp instead of 2tsp, but that’s been fixed. In conclusion, these are the BEST you’ll ever find, try it.

Oh yeah, unless you are using pure maple syrup, look at the list of ingredients on the back. There’s probably a 99% chance the first, second or third ingredient in either corn syrup, or high fructose corn syrup. Both ingredients are absolutely TERRIBLE for you, and you should eat the least amount possible. Look it up. Sorry if this was too long and boring,

This recipe was horrible. All of the rave reviewed were from people who altered the original recipe which pretty much defeats the purpose of reviewing it. The batter came out extremely thin, way too much salt. 

I altered the recipe after the first round of cooking came out like trash. Added more flour and sugar to offset the salt. I would suggest adding in some lemon as way and exchanging the oil for butter. They came out much better once changed

I did what another reviewer did I cut the salt, instead of vegetable oil I put in butter, I added vanilla extract and cut back on the baking soda (there's too much baking soda in the recipe). It was really good after I did this and my grandma enjoyed it too. It's simple and easy to make for anyone.

Good basic recipe. My body can’t handle simple carbs with sugar, so I added protein powder, a little bit of coconut flour, half sugar/half stevia for the sweetener, a bit more milk, an extra egg, and almond extract and cinnamon to add flavor. Yum! Didn’t even need syrup.

Ok so I never write reviews but my son asked to me to make him pancakes and I wasn't in the mood but did it anyway.  I made the first batch and thought this tastes horrible I think I put in too much salt.  I threw it out.  I tried a second batch with barely any salt and it tasted horrible.  I believe it is the baking powder - it has a sour horrible taste.   And both times I used 2 teaspoons of baking powder - I did not use Tablespoons   I would not try this recipe.  It was HORRIBLE  I wasted two full batches!

I put 1 tablespoon of sugar instead of 2, and it’s still too sweet for my family. Next time I’ll make it again with half or even a quarter. I also reduced the baking soda to half teaspoon. The rest is great.

We found them too thin - more like crepes than pancakes.  The flavour was ok, but the texture was way off for us.  Will not make again.

i’ve made this recipe twice now on two separate occasions and people LOVE them! this has become my go-to recipe for pancakes and will probably remain the go-to! sooo easy and delicious. i substitute milk for almond milk (cause that’s what i always have) and it still tastes amazing! let the batter sit for a couple minutes to thicken (if you use almond milk).

Delicious pancakes.
I had self rising flour so I omitted the salt and decreased the baking soda to 1 tsp. I also had buttermilk left over from Christmas  baking so I used that. I always add 1 tsp of cinnamon . 1/4 tsp nutmeg and a dash of ginger to my pancake mixes.
Yum yum

Subbed coconut oil for veggie and doubled the recipe, turned out awesome for us! My seven year old actually made them and in all seriousness, (as in I didn't just tell him that to see that glow of pride well up in his cheeks) these were the best pancakes I've ever had! Definitely going to use this recipe in all our future pancake endeavours! ??????

This recipe is spot on for flavor!! However the oil makes it too thin and isn’t really needed. I made it both ways and without the oil is way better and slightly better for you :)

The recipe itself was good, aside from the salt. It's too much! Be sure to use less than it says, or even ignore the salt entirely. Other than that, all should be good.

Great easy recipe! I encourage you to test one and then add anything to the butter according to your taste. I put less sugar first and then added more after tasting the first one.

Love this! If anything maybe add some baking soda or use self rising flour instead of all purpose to add more fluffiness, they just tend to be flat.

They tasted pretty good but I think there is too much baking powder and salt. Some of them came out a little burnt.

Too much salt and baking powder. Only after following the recipe to a tee did I read the reviews and learned that the baking powder was flawed.  I thought it was too much but decided to stick to it. WAY TOO MUCH SALT. Don’t follow this recipe!

The pancakes were good. I used vanilla almond milk instead of milk. My suggestion is to use less salt, especially if you're doubling the recipe.

I love this recipe! It tastes wonderful and it is light and fluffy. A warning to everyone who makes this though, using a quarter cup to measure out the batter onto the pan, you will only have 9 pancakes, which is hardly good for three people. I recommend doubling the recipe. Also, blueberries are a nice touch you can add to make these even tastier.

I am a beginner in cooking and I have no experience at all. This was easy but I reduced the sugar to 1/2 teaspoon and the pancakes tasted great and they were really fluffy - now I'm a pancake master! Tysm!

Definitely easy to make. Texture is good, they cooked up well. I agree with others there was too much salt, I think if you cut that by half, the recipe would be a keeper.

The recipe is awful, it was super salty and flat and tasted very baking powdery. Don't waste your time on such recipe.

Just made this recipe this morning on a whim because we were out of pancake mix and it was a huge hit! I substituted 3 tablespoons of salted margarine for the veg oil, added 1 tablespoon of vanilla, cut the amount of salt down to 1/4 teaspoon, and added a few shakes of ground cinnamon. It came out delicious and my husband was very, VERY pleased! I've already added the recipe to my recipe binder - will definitely be making it again!

Made this for the family.  Doubled the recipe and it made about 15 pancakes (only thing I added to the base recipe was vanilla extract added 1 teaspoon). The flavor was great. Nice fluffy pancakes from scratch can't ask for more. I added dried cranberries and chia seeds to some of the pancakes and it was even better. I cooked the pancakes on a medium to medium-low because my cast iron pan gets super hot. Will keep this in the morning rotation.

I double this mix for 8 servings and it is by far my favourite pancake mix EVER. The pancakes turn out light and fluffy and slightly crispy, all whilst being ‘melt in your mouth’ quality. I believe the secret is in the oil and the beaten eggs. Superb!

Turned out very salty - probably would've been much better cutting the salt at least in half, and possibly reducing the baking powder as well.

The recipe I see only has 2 tsps baking powder, so the poster has obviously fixed it.

Like others, I added vanilla & cinnamon, and only used a pinch of salt. 

They were thick and had a lovely texture in the middle. I follow the Keto diet, so unfortunately I couldn't taste them (bummed as they looked really, really good). According to my kids, they were the best pancakes they've ever had.

I admit I did not 'make' this recipe..... I've been making pancakes 'from scratch' for 60 years - but I would like to give you all a couple of tips.  Put some vinegar or lemon into the milk ahead of time and let it sit (1-2 tsp) - you will then have 'buttermilk'
which will make the pancakes much fluffier. Also, instead of 2 Tbsps. of oil or butter.....use melted bacon grease!  Provides great flavour & Vanilla is a good idea too.

This is a good basic recipe for pancakes.  I made a "tester" with the recipe but found it lacked flavor and the sweetness I was looking for in a pancake.  I added a 1/2 tsp sugar, 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 vanilla...delish.

Yes I will make again. The flavour was spot on! My pancakes were a bit thin but I was lacking a smidge of flour and added the right amount of milk so they were more liquid than they should have been. Previously I was buying premade pancakes  because I had tried so many different pancake recipes and they all tasted rubbish! This one impressed me enough to stop buying premade!

I just made this recipe and the pancakes are so fluffy! The typo with the baking powder has now been fixed and 2tsp is just the right amount. I added a teaspoon of vanilla and a teaspoon of cinnamon based on other reviews and it was fabulous! the truck with all pancake recipe is to not overmix and this batter comes out very thick which makes perfect pancakes. Easy and delicious, this is now my go to pancake recipe. Next time I want to try it with half buttermilk and half regular milk because I bet that would be wonderful.

Zero stars - STAY AWAY. This recipe is awful. There is far too much baking powder and salt. We all feel nauseous from eating the resulting pancakes (looked beautiful but tasted awful).

It was VERY VERY salty. 

We lowered it down to 1/2 teaspoon, and it tastes WAY better.

I did not add any salt, sugar, or oil. I used water instead of milk. & I added a teaspoon of vanilla. I added cinnamon, nutmeg & a dash of cloves. These came out really terrific & were very tasty. Light & fluffy just as others noted. Make them your own by adding spices. Orange zest & cloves would be delicious as would lemon zest & blueberries.

I was out of my box pancake mix and I had a lot of baking stuff around because of the holidays so I figure let's try it and they came out pretty good. Easy to do nice and quick for 5 ingredients you're good to go. I added a little bit of vanilla because I just like that splash of vanilla but it's up to you.

Oh man, what's with all the salt? One star may be harsh; but if you use all the time and ingredients to make it, and it turns out terrible, one star is generous.

I used the recipe As is I only put a little cinnamon because I put cinnamon in every pancake mix I use. They are so fluffy my kids thought we did not need to use syrup to eat these the kids thought it was that good. I made one batch with normal flour and one batch with wheat flour they are still super good. I never made homemade pancakes before and it is so much cheaper than buying pancake mix I might just start doing this from now on.

I make these at least once a week for a quick before-school breakfast for the kids. It's the only pancake recipe I've used that turns out well consistently, and keeps me from using boxed mix with all the sketchy ingredients.

My husband is a fan for fhe buttermilk pancakes. Money is tight and I wanted pancakes for dinner. So I looked for a recipe and found this! The only ingredient I didn’t have was the baking powder so I used baking soda instead and it still tasted good. My husband asked me what ready mix was this and I told him it was a recipe I found. We both loved it and this is a keeper for sure. =)

I was looking for an easy tasty pancake recipe and  stumbled across this. I typically made coconut pancakes, but was looking for more of the 'real' thing without the bad feeling afterwards. I made these GLuten Free and substituted the All Purpose GF flour. It measures cup for cup the same as regular flour. I doubled the recipe for 2 adults & 2 teens, but clearly needed to triple it. I did make a few changes based on the reviews. I only added 1/2tsp of salt per recipe, added 1/2 tsp of vanilla per recipe, substituted unsweetened Vanilla Almond milk and added real butter instead of the oil. I also made an easy homemade syrub to top them and we loved them. Will definitely be making these again.

Delicioso. I added a bit of lemon juice and cinnamon, and vanilla. I changed the milk to almond milk and the vegetable oil to coconut oil. I also used butter on the griddle.

Was very hard to cook. Even after nearly ten minutes of frying, it was still slightly undercooked. Pancakes were very doughy. I don't think I'll use this recipe again.

No changes.  Wanted fast for my 3 & 5 yr old Grdaughters. Yes thin & the girls ate them but didn't ask for 2nds. I believe I had 4 made up when I called them to come eat. Remember they are thin & all of us are use to thick pancakes. Taste was ok But I do not think , no I know I won't make again.

Did not try this but I don't think these people read the recipe!  It says two teaspoons of baking powder and two tablespoons of oil!  They seem to have gotten the two mixed up!

The batter was very thin when I made these.  I made them exactly to the recipe.  I thought the 2 teaspoons of baking powder would make a thicker batter.  They did taste good, just not the consistency I expected.

Nice recipe, but made a few alterations...
I added a bit of vanilla extract/essence and used 3 tbsp of butter like everybody else. I liked the result but it requires more sugar. ??

We love this recipe, but I do make some changes.  I use a pinch on salt (about 1/2 teaspoon) and use slightly heaping tablespoons of sugar instead of flat tablespoons.  I use almond milk instead of dairy, and  I add extra water and make it thin like crepes....delicious!

The batter, and thus the pancakes, were extremely thin. More like crepes than pancakes.

This was perfect!!! Best pancakes I've ever had. Just make sure you do scramble the egg before you drop it in the batter. Don't be like me when I made this the second time lol!!

I had a non pancake experience with this recipe. It came out having the texture of a crepe. It wasn't bad, but not what I was looking for. Suggest ways of getting a more fluffy batter.

Made this tonight ! The changes I did were 1/2 tablespoon baking powder, 1 tablespoon sugar, then roughly 1/2 tablespoon cinnamon/sugar mixed, roughly 1-2 teaspoons vanilla, and instead of vegetable oil I used coconut oil!!!! So yummy!
(Sorry sometimes I don't really measure I just put in what I think is good)

Delicious with perfect pancake texture. Changes: I split the recipe in half, used whole wheat flour and olive oil instead, added half a tsp of cinnamon, sliced banana and left out the sugar (since I had it with maple syrup). I made one good-sized pancake and it was great!

I loved it, but thought two tablespoons of baking powder was wrong, so I changed it, glad I did! I added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and I used unbleached flour instead of regular and it was great!!! My boys loved the pancakes and I loved their smiling faces!!

The recipe is easy to follow. But simplifying measurements does NOT make a recipe edible. I only used 1.5 tsp of baking powder, 1/4 tsp of salt (per the instruction that came with my all-purpose flour). Unfortunately I forgot to eyeball the  consistency as I poured milk cup of milk in... The batter ended up WAY too thin.

Used half the milk it called for, and still just basically brown liquid. Water consistency.

An absolute hit every time!! such an amazing easy recipe! I like to add a pinch of cinnamon and a 1/2 a teaspoon of vanilla extract! DELISH. My kids wait every weekend for those yummy pancakes! some maple syrup, fruits, or chocolate chips to complete this yumminess.

This was great. I ran out of instant pancake mix and had to make some from scratch for the teenagers' sleepover. They were easy to put together, and I had all the ingredients on hand. These were better and fluffier than the instant mix and the girls all liked these more. Success! 
I should mention that I just dumped everything into a bowl and whisked with a fork. I actually forgot the oil too but they tasted great.

These were fast and delicious. The only thing I did different was add a teaspoon of vanilla as mentioned by other folks. Really tasty! I'll probably use half the sugar next time, but that is entirely personal presence.

Passed the kid test! I added cinnamon and vanilla. Doubled the recipe for 3 hungry boys. No deviation from the recipe listed other than the vanilla and cinnamon. 

Nice and thick, not super dense or fluffy. Great flavour.

Perhaps the recipe was altered, it now says 2tsp baking powder.

Easy to put together and tastes good. Cook with bacon grease to make more flavorful. Add in whatever variations you want- blueberry, chocolate chip, etc.

Loved this recipe, was quick easy and delicious.
 I used almond milk instead of regular and sweetener instead of sugar to make them slightly healthier and was worried that would make them go wrong, but I was very pleased with how they turned out.

This is a delicious recipe, but I always add at least a half a cup of flour to it in order to make it the right consistency.  I also lowered the salt to 1/2 tsp.  I always add vanilla and a cinnamon/sugar mix to all my pancake recipes.

Soooo, unless this recipe was submitted at a different time. The cakes turned out perfectly. If at any time the recipe called for 2 tablespoons of baking powder,  that should have been a flag as to the proportions of the other  ingredients. If you'd like a less fluffy  cake, maybe reduce the baking powder to 1 tsp and maybe half tsp of salt.  Otherwise great recipe, great cakes!, try them

No changes to the recipe (made 6/4/2016), was incredibly easy to follow and tasted great. As someone who'd never made pancakes before, this is gonna be a great go-to recipe.

Easy recipe, but it had to be drowned in a lot of maple syrup to taste good. Add fruit to it and cinnamon for sure to improve taste

These pancakes were great! As with all recipes, I looked through several recipes and made my own modified version based from the original. I think that this made the perfect, most fluffy pancakes I have ever made. I cut down the salt amount to 1/2 a teaspoon, I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, and I put in 3 tablespoons of softened butter instead of putting oil in the batter. To prevent my pan from getting sticky or burned, I kept drizzling the pan with oil while making the pancakes whenever I felt like the pan was getting too dry. I made two pancakes at a time, and even added fresh slices of strawberries inside some of them. After adding rasberry syrup and some with powdered sugar, my family and I couldn't get our hands off it!

I read the reviews where people said they were decreasing the baking powder and changing around half the recipe...it never listed more than 2 tsp of baking powder to begin with. This recipe was great. Quick, easy, and all thumbs up from my troop!

Although it was really quick to make with little ingredients, it tasted to flowery if you go by the recipe listed.  It would really need some adjusting.

Unlike most reviews I will tell you I made this as is and it was PERFECT. Don't mess with it. It tastes just like what I grew up with on weekend mornings. No beating egg whites etc. you really can be eating pancakes in a jiffy! 5 minute or less prep!
Wow! Unusual to keep recipe as is but trust me keep as written. Good job!??

I would definitely rethink the salt content on this recipe. If your toppings for these pancakes are really sugary than it can mask the salty taste; but if you enjoy just butter and a splash of homemade buttermilk syrup with your pancakes, half the salt content:)

I tried this recipie this morning, and I gotta say it was kinda salty to me. I'll definitely do it many times in the future, but I'll make some small change until I find the perfect taste for me :)

We made these in our classroom.  We really liked them.  We changed the recipe by putting in less salt, because it seemed like too much for us. We ate lots because they were so good.  You should make them too! :)

Very good! I added a teaspoon of vanilla and about a 1/4 C more of flour because the batter was too thin otherwise. Yummy and fluffy!

Made as directed and came out delicious! Just don't over mix or they will be too thin but still taste great! I used a 1/4 measuring cup  and the recipe made 9 pancakes.

I added 1 tsp baking soda (it makes them more spongey), a little vanilla, nutmeg, & cinnamon. The 2nd time it was holiday season so eggnog (1/4 C with 1/2 C milk) & pumpkin spice gave it a great extra flavor. But if you add nog be sure to add 1/4 tsp extra baking powder to counter the heaviness. Great base recipe to add too!

I used wheat flour, added protein powder and chocolate chips.  I also used a stevia and sugar mix.  They turned out great.  Thanks.

I LOVE this recipe! Although I did make a few changes. I increased the baking powder to 4 TBS instead of 2 TBS this made them very fluffy and not flat. I also added 1 1/2 TSP of vanilla. With the sugar I increased it to 3 TBS. They came out amazing and everyone loved them.

I mixed the dry ingredients, then read a few reviews and was not happy to see the bad reviews....I had already used only half the salt. I added about another cup of flour.  I used 1 cup almond milk and about 3/4 cup low fat milk, 3 T of olive oil instead of butter, and threw in some vanilla to hide the baking powder. I will read reviews before starting!

Very easy to make. My kids loved them and said it was better than my usual pancakes (box mix). I put a little vegetable oil in the skillet before each pancake and it worked better than pam spray. I would definitely recommend!

These were great! I made these this morning, and I loved them! I only used a 1/4 tsp of salt, though. Anyways, they were quick & easy to make, and my pancakes turned out nice & fluffy - good recipe!

Great recipe, whipped it up in less than 5 minutes.  They cooked nicely and taste delish.  I would use 1tsp of Baking powder instead of two, next time, but other than that they were great.

I made these for my nephews and my niece. They were really easy and fast to make. I doubled up on all the ingredients because the boys eat a lot. They loved these pancakes. My niece is finicky and wouldn't eat hers until I promised her watermelon after.

I have used this recipe many times now. I usually make it exactly by the recipe (since the baking powder has been fixed), and it's always great. sometimes I add a little vanilla, depending on my mood.  But they're still great without it :) this recipe is my go-to for quick and easy pancakes

I sifted all the dry ingredients first including a teaspoon of cinnamon. I used butter instead of oil, 1 tbsp of Sugar and Vanilla is a must. 1 lid full. Pancakes were delicious and fluffy.

I swapped out the all-purpose flower for whole wheat flower and the result was great! This recipe is delicious! They turned out very fluffy, cooked quick and paired wonderfully with honey. My husband and I try to avoid butter and we definitely didn't miss it in this recipe! We will be keeping this one, thank you!

Great pancakes!  I halved the recipe and used melted butter instead of oil.  I also added about 1/2 tsp vanilla.  After putting the second pancake in to cook and biting into the first one, I realized that I forgot to add the egg.  It was delicious eitherway, and would probably omit the egg next time as well.

i added a teaspoon of vanilla and used slightly less baking powder as well as switching out 3 tbsp melted butter instead of oil (as per a previous reviewer) and they had nice flavor. Nice, simple, quick recipe.

My son has a severe egg allergy and I have been looking for a pancake recipe for over two years that were light fluffy and delicious. All of the vegan recipes I have tried have been flat and tasteless. I have tried substituting my 1 tbls applesauce for the egg in many recipes but the pancakes never performed properly.  These came out perfectly and they taste delicious. My son was eating them faster than I could cook them!!!

Even after the author made the corrections to the baking powder there are still some major issues with this recipe. There is still entirely too much salt and the pancakes are completely flat with no body. The batter is incredibly thin but it cooks up enough to flip.

The first time I made this, the batter was super runny and my pancakes were on the flatter side (as some people mentioned). The second time I used 3/4 cup of milk instead. Added a pinch of baking soda and whisked the eggs first to ensure fluffy-ness. Also, I decided to spice things up and substituted the oil for bacon grease. I recommend everyone try this, to die for! (And threw some bacon and berries on top)

Good but not great. They are flat like McDonalds pancakes. I used half the salt and swapped the oil for butter. After trying one, I added vanilla and added baking soda. It needed it to lift them up into fluffy pancakes. This one is easy.

Pancakes are very good. A little on the plain side, but I like my pancakes a little sweeter. Nice and fluffy. A lot fluffier than I expected them to be. A good base recipe, and with a few tweaks, it will be great.

I substituted 2 tsp salt for 1/4 cup flour and added 2 cloves of garlic, sauteed.  Cooked the dish in a pot in the oven for one hour at 390 degrees f.  Garnished with onions and turnips instead of baking powder.  Overall, I have had better pancakes.

My son has a dairy allergy so I use soy milk or almond milk (whichever I have on hand) in place of the milk. They always taste great!  I agree with other reviews to add 1 tsp of vanilla.  Very easy and quick to make!

Texture was great - very fluffy.   It was so salty thought I couldn't eat them.  Next time I'll try without so much salt.

I don't understand all these reviewers. The recipe called for 2 teaspoons of baking powder. What's to cut down? Great recipe. Pancakes turned out light & fluffy. I'm thinking of adding in a little vanilla extract next batch I make.

This is my go too pancake recipe. I LOVE it and everyone who has tried my pancakes loves them too. The best part about this recipe is I almost always have all the ingredients around my kitchen. The only thing I change is instead of using milk I use cinnamon vanilla coffee creamer (you could use whatever flavor you like this is my preference is all) and depending on how much flavor I want I may add 1/2 cup creamer and 1/2 cup milk or I may add 1 cup of creamer and no milk and I always add blueberries(but chocolate chips are good too ;)

If you use less salt, it better. The baking soda is good, maybe add a little  more milk as the batter ends up quite thick

I usually read reviews before making a recipe for any changes. This time I forgot (kid distraction)so didn't know the baking powder was a typo until after I mixed everything. That being said, I feel like if you take a recipe and change the amount and type of ingredients, you shouldn't give the original recipe five stars. You didn't even make that one!  I can't be the only one who occasionally forgets to check and goes by the stars on a recipe. Since we can't submit anything without rating, maybe three stars would be good since I think most people would check a three star review.

They were easy to make.  They don't require a lot of ingredients and they are very simple to modify. I used 3 egg whites instead of 2 whole eggs, and brown sugar instead of white sugar. Sprinkle powder sugar on them, and give IHOP a run for their money. They were moist and nummy.  . .no syrup necessary

Loved it! Recipe must have been corrected prior to my viewing, as it has baking powder listed for 2 teaspoons. Great basic recipe. My little one begged for blueberry and banana pancakes so I used this one as my base this time and added a mashed banana,cup of blueberries and 2 teaspoons of vanilla. Seriously yummy both ways!

As recommended, I used a teaspoon of vanilla extract. I also swapped the vegetable oil for canola oil. It came out pretty well! At first, I thought they were a little watery (I perhaps used too little flour), but after a minute on the skillet, they firmed up. I greased the pan with unsalted butter, but perhaps I'll replace the oil with butter too.

This recipe is wonderful!! Very fast, quick and easy. I had all the ingredients in my cupboard and I think it was much better than the prepackaged pancake mix. The ONLY thing I did differently to this recipe was add just a 1/2 of teaspoon of Vanilla Extract! Only because I know it makes everything just a little bit more yummy. It worked perfectly! It's definitely worth a try.

I used self-rising flour, so I didn't worry about the baking powder and salt entirely. I also added a small bit of vanilla extract (one small cap). These were pretty good!

This recipe was not bad. I cut back on the salt to about 1/2 a tsp. And, instead of using oil on the pan to cook it, I used butter, because, there is already oil in the recipe. Overall I think that this was not to bad. And, I'm not a big fan of sugar in my pancakes, but, this was good. Thanks for the recipe.

A great basic pancake recipe... I used gluten free flour and realized mid-recipe that out of oil so had to use apple sauce.. but they came out great!  Next time I might try adding cinnamon and vanilla.

I am giving this five stars because it ended up being the perfect recipe for the problem that I had.  There was no baking powder in the house!  After researching substitutes for baking powder I used 1/4 tsp baking soda + 1/2 c buttermilk (which, amazingly, I had left over after making a batch of ranch dressing).  Also used 1/2 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp baking soda instead of the full tsp of salt.  Since I used the 1/2 cup buttermilk, I cut the regular milk to 1/2 c.  And used melted butter instead of oil.  Oils, other than peanut oil, in these types of recipes always taste like petroleum to me.  And, I griddle in butter.  Ended up with 12 approximately 3-1/2 " in diameter, slightly chewy (which, I love - I detest pancakes that crumble!), beautifully raised pancakes that did not have that baking powder taste (guess these are reasons why I am not particularly fond of biscuits).  Sorry for the long review, but am thrilled, after all of these years, I can now make a pancake that I love.

It is a decent recipe but has too much oil and too much sugar in it. I think if you reduce the oil to 1 tbsp or to 1/2 tbsp and reduced the sugar to 1/2 tbsp it would be better. Hope this helps, have a great day.

I use this pancake recipe ALL the freaking time! (even in the early hours of the morning.. like 6 am...) It gets gobbled down in no time flat whenever I make it, especially for a bunch of hungry church folks, and hard working guys! My advice to get thee fluffiest pancake you can get with this recipe is to whisk the ingredients together and let stand for about 5 minutes or so. The batter will start to bubble and when you pour it they will fluff right up! 
Also, Im not sure where everyone is getting the idea this recipe calls for two Tablespoons of baking powder.. It only calls for two Teaspoons. 

Anyways, It is a hit!! Thank you!

I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil. I had to use a mixer to get those lumps out. It was not easy. It was an experiment but I love the end results. I liked the fluffiness of these pancakes. So fluffy!!!!!!!!

I made this recipe for the first time a while ago,my son's faves,but there's one thing that keeps bothering me every time I see it,from where all you people got the 2 Tablespoons of baking powder?I think you all need glasses,because it states it clearly in the recipe 2Teaspoons not tablespoons,so next time read your recipe twice before you comment so you don't drive other people like me crazy with your nonsense.This recipe is a keeper,thanks Sharon for sharing it.

This is a great recipe-- I added 1 tablespoon of vanilla, used 2 tablespoons of butter instead of oil, and added about 1/4 cup of water so the batter becomes more runny, and the pancakes turn out thinner (how my fam likes them:)

The recipe must have changed after the comments were posted because it now calls for two teaspoons of baking powder.  I always reduce my salt so I used a pinch and added some vanilla.  The pancakes cooked up nice and fluffy.

Definitely go with the 2 tsp of baking powder, added a tsp of vanilla and lightly sprinkled cinnamon on the cakes as cooking. Simply delicious and my family didn't even use syrup because of the vanilla cinnamon taste...less sugar bonus!!

This recipe produces a very liquidy batter that is hard to work with. By the time it sets up enough in the skillet to flip, the bottom side of the pancake is already burned past being edible. Turning the heat down doesn't seem to help.

I have used to recipe many, many times because I absolutely love how easy and delicious this recipe is! Today, I doubled the recipe for my family of 5. Substituted with 1 cup ground oats, 1 cup all purpose flour, used 2 cups of vanilla flavored unsweetened almond milk, vanilla extract and doubled everything else. You couldn't tell it was a healthier version. My family gobbled up the pancakes! Thanks for sharing!

I decreased the BS and added Vanilla, everything else was the same.  My family as well as myself found the pancakes very tasteless.  Will keep looking for another recipe.

I wanted easy and these are easy, I am an avid box mix user but lately even when I doctor them up I can't get the tast I like. In this recipe I sifted the flour, beat eggs slightly, added brown sugar and a little more milk just to keep it moving. I'm sure if you've made pancakes from scratch before you know the texture you like. I'm am officially inlove with this simple easy pancake recipe! Thanks for sharing!  Ps I did use self rising flour.

Never had to buy
store bought mix again.
tried it the recipe stated above,
needed adjusting so everybody here did right,  
Only used: 2 tsp. baking powder
1 tsp. salt 2 dashes of cinnamon. 
set aside to marinate for at least 5 minutes to thicken,
then scoop on a pan. Family can't get enough. Luv it.

Too salty, so next time I will cut it in 1/2.  Also, a I used a little sugar and 1 packet of Truvia and they came out just fine.  I also added chocolate chips....why not?  These pancakes were not light and fluffy but more dense but the hubby and child loved them.  I cooked up a bunch and froze them in packs of two so I could just defrost in the micro quickly during the busy weekday mornings.  I will make again, I'm sure.  They were easy.

So easy and so delicious.  Woke up craving pancakes but I am in my country house with few provisions,  Thought I would just go and buy a mix - but instead, realized I had all the basics here.  Just had to buy a few perishables and within 15 minutes of returning from the store, I had hot pancakes with fresh VT Maple Syrup.  For about 1/8 the price of a mix.  Yay!

It's my daughters 14th birthday today & when I went to the pantry I was all out if pancake mix. So I found this easy pancake recipe. It was great!!! So fast & easy, pancakes were light & fluffy! The came out that perfect golden brown color we all love. I did & some vanilla & a pinch of cinnamon (that's the was my kids like it) I will never by store bought mix again, this recipe is way to good & way to easy! Plus a lot of store bought have the weird gritty texture some times which, nobody has time for! :) This definitely made one happy birthday girl!!! Thanks

No more pancakes from the box, this receipe has save me time and expense. The only change I did for my household was adding 2 tablespoons of water to make batter a bit more thinner. I can get more pancakes about 6 to 8. Thanks.

I chose this because I wanted to make quick & easy pancakes with ingredients on hand. I didn't even have to read reviews to know that baking powder was too much. I decreased to less than a 1 Tbsp (eye balled it) and 1/2 the salt. I know baking powder helps batter thicken up once it sits for a few minutes & I added extra milk bc I didn't want them too thick. Added fresh raspberries to the last 2-3 cakes. Good recipe - good basic ingredients and definitely adaptable to one's taste buds. Keeper. Thanks for sharing.

i am pretty sure that 1 cup of flour is NOT enough! i added 1/2 cup more and batter was still VERY sloppy...also when you mix well the pancakes were rubbery and about as thin as a tortilla! the flavor was ok but my daughter and i were quite disappointed...too bad :(

Best recipie for pancakes EVER! I don't use regular sugar, so I added 1/4 Tsp. of natrual Turbinado sugar. I also thought ther was waaaaay too much salt. If you want good results, get rid of some of that salt.....

Too much baking powder and salt, it didn't taste right.  I suggest half the amount of baking powder and salt for this recipe.  Otherwise, it was good.

These pancakes apparently got a bad rap 'cause of an initial typo in qty of baking powder, which has been corrected. As written now, they are perfectly delicious & easy to make, & should be just as or even more moist & flavorful than the much-higher-rated "Good Old Fashioned" due to proportionately less baking powder, more sugar & more milk! That said, I still found these (as well as the "Old Fashioned") too salty, so I reduce the salt by half. These are my very picky 7yo granddaughter's fave pancakes, & the following are her fave modifications (dairy-free & healthier): 1/2 cup home-ground oats (or oat or buckwheat flour) & 1/2 cup white whole wheat flour; melted butter-sub (Earth Balance, which I melt in frying pan, thus "greasing" pan at same time); 1/2 tsp salt; soy or almond milk; & xylitol, brown sugar or maple syrup (yum!). With the oats (or buckwheat) & white whole wheat, they still come out fluffy, yet have a delicious flavor! I like these better than the "Good Old Fashioned" 'cause the higher milk & sweetener make them so flavorful, she doesn't even add syrup; just eats them straight out of hand! (They are also good as a snack in her lunch box.) Oh, & with oats or buckwheat for half of flour, don't need to worry as much about overworking dough & activating gluten, since there is so much less of it. One last point: I add butter to cold milk while butter is still sizzling, & haven't noticed any problem with "cold" milk that way. These truly are "EASY" & great!

Really good, really easy. I have made these before. This time I added a couple of teaspoons of raspberry seedless jam, dried currants and a dash of vanilla to the milk/egg/oil mixture. YEAH BABY! Soooo much flavor.

These were good. I almost followed the recipe exactly, but forgot the salt on accident, and didn't have an egg so actually ended up using about 3/4 tablespoon of mayonnaise... They were really fluffy and thick, and good with added blueberries or chocolate chips. The only downside is that they didn't have much flavor on their own, so they definitely need to be eaten with syrup or other topping. Maybe vanilla added to the batter would help. Thanks for the recipe, they were easy so I'll be using this recipe again.

Great and easy recipe. We are gluten free in our house so i used Domata gluten free flour. I used one cup of it as recipe called for, and ended up having to use between 1.5 and 2 cups of milk. I started at 1 cup and added a little til it was right. I also added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon. I was out of white sugar so I substituted the same amount of brown sugar.

Seriously the best pancake recipe ever!  I have tried waiting and not waiting the hour. I really prefer not waiting. They remind me of cracker barrel pancakes, but I also made them smaller like McDonald's. I wait to add the blueberries until I pour it in my cast iron skillet. This recipe is crazy versatile. I have experimented with different fruits and even made tropical coconut pancakes. Sometimes I add flax seeds, sunflower seeds, or oatmeal and cinnamon. I also made smaller sizes to make little breakfast sandwiches to freeze for mornings when I'm in a hurry.  I'm in Florida so of course I had to key lime it up!  Added a little lime juice, coconut and topped with a little cream cheese coolwhip mixture. Thanks Alison for sharing Todd's recipe!!

This was my first time making homemade pancakes and I was so disappointed in the taste. I thought it was something I did, but reading the reviews, it was probably the baking powder. Ah well, I'll find another recipe!

This recipe is definitely easy, and the pancakes were pretty decent. It's not the best pancake recipe I've ever used, but it made for a quick and enjoyable Sunday breakfast.

I too a changed the baking powder down to 2 teaspoons and the salt down to a 1/2  teaspoon. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla and substituted milk for plain Rice Milk. Delicious!

I like easy recipes, especially for rushed mornings. These turned out wonderfully, and were so quick to prepare and cook. The texture was perfect, though the taste was a bit bland. Next time, I'll add cinnamon and vanilla for a flavour boost.

Great pancakes, and it only took about ten minutes to whip up. The second time I made them I used buckwheat flower to varying results. They were a little dry and more runny, but still a-great substitute if you can't consume wheat.

Nice basic recipe. I took others' suggestion to reduce baking powder to two teaspoons.  Made a couple of my own variations to "healthen" them up - so ended up with something quite different I guess. Substituted 1/4 cup of oatmeal for part of the flour. And used a quarter cup of prune juice I'm trying to get rid of for part of the milk (for the rest I used almond milk). Added a bit of grated coconut, chopped walnuts and blueberries because that's what I had in the kitchen, plus a dash of cinnamon. Topped with honey. These are actually pretty darn good, with a good balance of lightness and heartiness.  You can't really taste the prune juice, it just comes across as vague fruitiness.

I followed the measurements exactly. These tasted way too salty! I even added sliced bananas to help sweeten them but it didn't really help. I will only add a pinch of salt for next time. Sorry!

I used the recipe required baking powder; I used only 3/4 tsp of salt and used melted unsalted butter as opposed to vegetable oil; finally added 1 tsp of vanilla and they came out super fluffy and very delicious. Pretty happy with my first attempt ever at homemade pancakes.

This is a delicious amazing recipe for pancakes! :) 
I've made these pancakes at least 3 or 4 times. I sometimes add some vanilla but they always turn out delicious! I've also added berries, chocolate chips, and other stuff. I did put less baking powder though.

I made a version these with my three year old niece this morning b/c it looked so simple!  Worked perfectly, I substituted superfine coconut for the sugar, soy milk for the milk, sub'd out half the flour w/ wholewheat, added just a pinch of salt and about a half cup of chocolate chips.  I love that it only makes a few pancakes it's the perfect size for my family.

These were so fluffy... simple.... and "meaty". You DON'T need more/less baking powder... you DON'T have to add vanilla... just make the darn pancakes exactly as instructed and you won't be disappointed. When you start making changes, then it's not the recipe anymore.... kindda pointless since you want to try THIS recipe right?  Not Cook30937's edited version. DO make sure your egg is beaten before adding to dry mix. When cooking them, I used "PAM for BAKING" spray.... worked great.

I have tried this recipe five times and it has worked out fine every time. I could easily say thids is the easiest pancake, and the best tasting i have ever eaten. I cut down the backing soda to a tespoon and got rid of the salt. I also got rid of the oil. I used this recipe to make coocies when i ran out of eggs, by adding 1/4 apple sauce for every egg

This is fantastic!! Just recently moved to england and couldn't find any pancake mix here and my kids are obsessed with pancakes! These are super easy to make and come out really fluffy. I used self raising flour so cut back in the baking powder and had to add a bit more milk.

These were yummy. I had already mixed it all before reading reviews, or I would have seen that I could omit the oil, make some adjustments. I am still learning things like that with cooking ;) Thanks, these were yummmmmy!

I should have read the reviews first. I don't cook so 2T Baking Powder was not "obviously a mistake" to me. These turned out the texture of cornbread. Salty cornbread. Ah well, at least it helped my diet since I could only eat one.

Am not a cook, so didn't know the baking power amount of 2 tablespoons was an error.

This is a great pancake recipe if you don't have any batter mix in the box. My daughter and I love it. I ran out of a box, so looked on the internet and found this one, it taste just like the one from the boxes! Delish!!

Like the others, I noticed the typo and adjusted the baking powder to 2 tsps. I wanted an easy recipe, and this fit the bill. Pancakes were light, fluffy, and tasty. Excellent!

I loved this recipe.  Living in Kenya, I was craving a taste of back home.  Our resources are really limited and I was excited to try this simple recipe. It was just my husband and I so I cut the recipe in half and it came out perfect.  The amount of baking powder recommended worked well for me.   Fluffy and yummy.  Next time I will add vanilla.

So easy and great with a few adjustments! After fixing the baking powder to 2 tsp, I substituted almond milk for regular and added cinnamon and vanilla. Delicious!

Add smashed banana and 2 tsp fresh orange juice to the liquid mixture before blending it all together. Definitely follow the commentary advice and use 2 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp salt with 3 tbsp butter instead of oil. I made them the morning after Thanksgiving and they were a huge hit!

I am pregnant and really just wanted homemade pancakes this morning and did not bother to read the reviews and got a not pleasant surprise of a mouthful of baking powder and salt. Wish I would have slowed down some:(

I goofed a moment ago and meant to give it 1 star NOT 4, unfortunately I couldn't go back and edit my rating, so have to repost it.... 

This recipe is a bit strong on the baking powder and salt...  I just cut those two ingredients in half and the pancakes came out perfect!

Good Pancake not needing a lot of ingredients. As others suggested I only used 2 teaspoons of baking powder instead of 2 Tbs and I added 2 tablespoons of vanilla ext. I also only used 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil instead of 2. Great pancakes for a quick dinner! (Personal note: not keys pancakes)

These did not turn out well for us.  I don't cook much, but should have known that TWO TABLESPOONS of baking powder was way too much. I saw the great rating and followed blindly.

Like the recipe very simple and easy.  I can let my little cousin do all the work and all I have to do is put them on the griddle.  I like to add a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg to mine, just to flavor them up.

This is a nice recipe if you're up for modifying it radically. I used 1/2 C WW flour, 2 t baking powder, 3T sugar, 1T pysllium husk plus walnuts and bananas. Pretty good but a whole new recipe.

I'm giving the original recipe 1 star because, as others have said, the salt and baking powder portions are WAY off. Even my 20-month-old (who will eat anything) only took one bite. I scrapped the entire batch and started over. I used 2 TSP baking powder; 1/2 tsp salt; and half the oil. I also used egg substitute instead of regular eggs and the second time around they were FANTASTIC - 4 stars at least!

This is the first time i ever made pancakes by scratch and this was a really easy recipe. My family enjoyed them and i would make them again but i would use less salt. They tasted a little salt but once we put the butter and syrup they tasted great. next time i might add chocolate chips.

It was quite clear that that the 2 tablespoons was a typo!  I replaced the 2 tsbps oil with 1 tbsp butter, and used 2 beaten eggs (I think the eggs here are smaller) - I also added just under 1 tbsp cinnamon powder and that really enhanced the flavour!  Everyone loved them, and we ran out of batter quicker than we ever have before!!  Will definitely make these again!

These pancakes were extremely quick and easy to make.  They came out nice and fluffy.  I added some vanilla just for additional flavour.  My five year old daughter loves to help mix the batter and she keeps asking to have pancakes!!

I just made these. I read the reviews first and made some changes such as 2 teaspoons of baking powder (instead of tablespoons), 1/2 teaspoon of salt, 1 teaspoon of vanilla and i added 1 teaspoon cinnamon. I also substituted 3 tablespoons of melted butter in place of oil. These came out really good. This was the 2nd time i ever tried making pancakes. The first time i tried the Pancake I recipe but i thought it was a bit bland. But this one is truly yummy and worth remaking :)

I was out of pancake mix so I decided to try this recipe.  I made these using the suggested changes with baking powder and I also substituted 3 Tbs butter in place of the oil and added 1 tsp vanilla.  I also like to add fresh fruit such as strawberries, bannanas, or apples. They turned out great.  My whole family loved them.  I will be using this recipe again.

I made these pancakes exactly according to the recipe. I did beat the egg thoroughly. I thought about adding vanilla, but didn't. They came out great!

I have been making these pancakes literally for years (I'm new to writing reviews, but have been using this website for quite a while) and I have always put in the 2 tablespoons of baking powder, as in the recipe, and NEVER have a problem with it.  They always turn out perfect.  However, I do agree that vanilla does need to be added.

these were good, never going to use pre-packaged mix again!  I used half whole wheat flour, but they weren't as fluffy as everyone described. Still terrific though. Thanks for the clarification on the 2tsp vs 2Tbs of baking powder to those who know about cooking...I would have had no idea...

Used less salt and less baking powder.  They were gone in a flash - this might be our regular pancake recipe from now on.  3 stars b/c of the adjustments needed.

I followed suggestions of others and added 1 tsp vanilla, reduced baking powder to 2 tsp.  I also exchanged the oil for applesauce, and becaue I was a little low on milk, added about 1 Tb of water.  They turned out very nicely.

I gave this recipe three stars because it has good beginning, but it needs to be revised. I reduced the baking soda to one teaspoon and I added a teaspoon of vanilla. With those revisions the pancakes are good and fluffy!

This is a really good pancake recipe, and it is simple.  I used 2tsp of baking powder, and I cut the milk to 3/4cup since we like thicker and fluffier pancakes.  I will definately be using this one again!

Like everyone else, I realized as soon as I read it that the Baking soda OBVIOUSLY a typo.  I used 1 tsp baking soda and 1 tsp salt.  Used about 1/2 the vegetable oil called for.    THESE WERE THE BEST PANCAKES I EVER MADE!  SUPER EASY TOO!

Just remember to change the measurement of  baking powder, it's definitely teaspoon, instead of table spoon. And it's a bit salty, but I like it.

This recipe is even better when you use half the required oil and substitute butter for the other half.  I also added a teaspoon of vanilla and grated fresh nutmeg into the mix.  Delicious!

My new favorite pancake recipe. 5 for the flavor, 4 because they aren't fluffy which keeps them from perfection. But I used 2 teaspoons of baking soda and 2 Tablespoons of butter instead of vegetable oil. I LOVE these.

I was looking for an easy, basic pancake recipe and this is it! I adjusted the baking powder and salt as suggested by other reviewers and it worked perfectly. The only other change I made was to substitute vanilla sugar in the same amount. This recipe made 8 - 4in. cakes and I'll definitely use again. Thanks!

Easy easy easy!  Mods: sub 2 TEAspoons baking powder, sub pinch salt, sub peanut oil for veg oil, add half teaspoon vanilla.  Best pancakes I ever made, and they didn't require ingredients I don't regularly have on hand cough*buttermilk*cough.

This recipe was easy and tasted great! I followed the recipe exactly but added 1 extra teaspoon of sugar and a teaspoon of almond extract. Unlike many other recipes I've tried for pancakes, this on had great flavor and wasn't too heavy.

This is a very good basic pancake recipe. You can easily modify this recipe too.  Sometimes I substitute flour with whole wheat and it tastes awesome. Or I will just add one mashed banana for banana pancakes.  YUMMMMM!!

I used this recipe for a breakfast bake. The only things I did different were that I used 1/3 C whole wheat flour and 2/3 C white flour, I added 1 tsp vanilla and I cut back on the salt.  I left the baking powder at 2 tbsp and it turned out fine.  I made the batter as instructed, then mixed in various fruits (strawberries, blueberries, sliced banana and peaches), then I poured the batter into a greased loaf pan and baked.  It took about an hour to bake fully, it puffed up nicely and tasted really good.  I sliced my breakfast loaf and served with a little plain yogurt.  I give it a 4/5 because I changed a few things and didn't make it as pancakes.

This was the first time I made pancakes without using a mix (I am new to cooking). It was easy and they turned out great. I thought the flavor was so much better than Hungry Jack- I will never use a mix again!

The taste of these were good.  I took the advice of everyone and change the baking powder to 2 teaspoons and the salt to 1/2 teaspoons.  I changed the oil to 3 tablesppons oil, and I added 2 teaspoons lemon juice and 1/2 vanilla.  

After mixing the batter, it was very watery, but I put a batch on the griddle anyway.  This batch was VERY flat...but they tasted good.  So I added more flour to see if they would fluff up....they turned out still very flat - they almost look like crepes.  

For the most part...TASTE GOOD, BUT VERY FLAT and not fluffy.

Taste is good but the texture turned out to be quite rubbery.  I was hoping for a more fluffy texture.

This recipe was excellent! This was my absolute first time making pancakes and they turned out perfect! All I did to the recipe was substitute regular milk with soy milk and vegetable oil with extra virgin olive oil. I also added a dash of cinnamon, because I love cinnamon. Other than that, I still would've eaten the original recipe if I had the regular ingredients.

I used whole wheat flour and added 2 mashed banana's. The 2 tablespoons baking powder is a typo, it should only be 2 teaspoons. I only used 1/4 teaspoon salt, and I like my pancake batter runny so I added a little more milk (1/4-1/2 cup). I usually have pancake mix on hand in my pantry but I didn't today so I used this recipe instead, and it was even better then the pancake mix you can buy at the store. Edit: 8/7/2018 I had forgotten about this recipe, found it and made pancakes this morning. Yum. Added 1 banana and some walnuts.

This was a GREAT pancake recipe. It had tons of flavor (I've tried lots of them). My little boys ate them up! I made the recipe just like it said. I thought 2 T was a lot of baking soda too, but I did it and they were great.

I was a little skeptical about the amount of baking powder these called for, but I have to say they turned out perfect.  The only thing diffrent was I added just a little more milk.  I even added some choc chips for the kids pancakes.

YUM!!  I am an absolute failure at making pancakes - even from a mix.  I forced myself to try one last time, however, when my son begged this morning.  :)  And BOY am I glad I did!  I cut the baking powder down to 2 tsp & added about a tsp of vanilla - otherwise followed the recipe to the letter.  The pancakes cooked up so nicely, were light & fluffy (without being thick & cake-like) and had a perfect taste.  THANKS FOR SUCH A GREAT & EASY RECIPE!!

great recipe- I did change a couple of things to make it a bit healthier- whole wheat flour, honey instead of sugar, and applesauce instead of oil

also, I stuck with the reviews for 2 tsp of baking powder, a dash of salt, and some cinnamon

they turned out great and my husband loved them

After reading a couple of other reviews, I only added 2tsp. of baking powder.  Once I started making them, it didn't look like there would be enough batter, so I decided to double it, and made further adjustments.  I only added the 2tsp. of baking powder, only a dash of salt, I used melted butter instead of oil, and only used 1 1/2 cups of milk and I added chocolate chips just for fun.  They turned out really good that way!

I made this recipe and they turned out pretty bad, my kids wouldn't eat them and just spit them back out. So I made my own adjustments, 2cups ap flour, 2 tsp b. powder, 1 tsp salt/sugar, 1 1/4 cup milk, room temp, 1 egg room temp, 3 tbsp melted butter and 1 tbsp vanilla. Sift dry ingreidents together twice, then mix all wet together, making sure milk and egg is at room temp, then add wet to dry, mix well...pour on griddle until small bubbles form, then flip and you have better than bisquick! Makes about 10 md size pancakes.

I gave this one a 4, because I knew off the bat that (like others) I would have to reduce the baking powder and the salt.  I used 2 tsp baking powder and 2 pinches of salt.  This is actually a really good basic recipe otherwise.  For the people who found the batter runny and added more flour, eh.  That probably turned them in a near-brick doughy pancake.  The baking powder is actually what makes pancakes light and fluffy, and mine turned out just fine.  If you are having problems with pancakes being tough and thin, try stirring them more gently and not as long.  The only other changes that I made were to use whole wheat flour and honey instead of sugar for my own nutritional desires.

I also did what others did and decreased the baking powder and salt and added vanilla and a touch of cinnamon.  The batter however was super runny until i added a touch more flour.  I would suggest using a tad more flour.

As is, this recipe's measurements are off. I knew that two tablespoons of baking powder would be too much as would
a whole tsp. of salt. I reduced the baking powder to two teaspoons and cut 
the salt in half. I also added a bit of 
vanilla flavoring and used buttermilk,
as I had some that was about to turn.

This recipe makes eight medium pancakes,
enough for our breakfast with some leftover to freeze for busy mornings. 
They turned out like a basic pancake, no
frills.

This recipe was horrible!  I made the mistake of not reading the reviews because i wanted to get breakfast on the table quickly.  If I didn't have a garbage disposal for a bf, I would have tossed the whole batch.  Definitely needs less baking powder and less salt.

This recipe was very watery so it took a very long time for the pancakes to cook. I added additional flour twice and still very thin batter. I would recommend a buttermilk recipe because it makes more fluffy and thicker pancakes.

Obviously, use 2 TEASPOONS baking powder, not tablespoons. The pancakes are not super fluffy, but they aren't flat either. This is a great recipe to keep on hand because most everbody has everything on hand. And it's super fast to make. Also, this is a great base recipe for adding things like blueberries, strawberries, etc.

Very good.  Only used egg whites and it turned out well.  3 teaspoons of oil and 1 tablespoon of baking powder and 1 teaspoon of salt was a good change.  Vanilla was a good addition.

Not the best pancakes I've ever had.  They seemed a little salty, and the texture was off for a pancake.  Try the ricotta pancakes, Norwegian pancakes, or fluffy Canadian pancakes- they were all better than this one.

Good pancakes! I doubled the recipe and I had to use about 3 cups of milk because the batter was way too thick. I also added vanilla.
This is a good recipe for kids because it's easy. I would make them again.

These were awesome! The only thing I changed was I beat the egg whites separtely then added them after the dry and wet ingrdients were mixed. I also used 1/2 tsp of salt instead of 1 tsp. These were tasty and not too thick and gummy, which sometimes happens with pancakes. I may add vanilla extract next time.

These...are AMAZING! I cook them for me and my girlfriend all the time. The only change is to add an extra egg, and a little bit of flour to firm it up. This makes for fluffy pancakes...which is always a good thing!  =)

Very good pancakes for as simple as they are.    I did cut back on the backing powder a bit but with five children this is a very good recipe that is quick, easy and cheap.  Also more filling than store bought mixes.

Mmm..Mmmm. I have been making these pancakes as written for about 2 years now but I went back and read the reviews and took the advice of using only 2 tsp baking powder and adding cinnamon and vanilla. Wow! These are incredible! I also added blueberries. The whole family gobbled them up!

Great quick, easy recipe with all ingredients I had on hand.  Definately reduce baking soda to no more tan 2 teaspoons and salt to a pich. I also added a tsp vanilla and touch of cinnamon.  These were very good (not the absolute best pankakes I ever had), but gets 5 stars due to their ease and simplicity of ingredients.

Seems like a nice basic recipe. While I prefer buttermilk-based pancakes, I was out of anything to fake-make buttermilk (no vinegar, lemon juice, cream of tartar - it was sad), so I tried this recipe with the previous recommendations of using 2 tsp. (not tbsp.) of baking powder, 1 pinch of salt, and adding 1 tsp. of vanilla and a dash of cinnamon. I made two batches, one plain and one with mini chocolate chips, and both were very good. The batter did well after sitting for a few minutes while the griddle heated. Beware the serving recommendations - I was able to get about 8 4 inch chocolate chip pancakes out of the 4 serving settings, when I doubled it for the plain I got about 12 (the chips obviously added some bulk).

This was good.  I referenced my buttermilk pancake recipe and found that it calls for 2 tsp baking powder for 2 cups flour.  I used 2 tsp (not tbls), a dash of cinnamon and 1 tsp vanilla and these turned out well, if a little dense.  I would use this again.

Be careful when multiplying this recipe or you will end up with way too much salt. Stick to just a pinch of salt regardless of how many servings you're doing. 
Otherwise a good recipe, a bit too bland for my taste, but with some added vanilla extract and honey you're in business!

I have never been able to make pancakes from scratch... until now.  i doubled the recipe.... though i didnt need to since it made more than 8 pancakes.  the only changes i made were to use 3tbs of baking powder, water and tonic water instead of milk.  They came out fluffy, cooked all the way through and made my house smell like i had just baked cookies.  thanks for the recipe.

I love this recipe. It's so fast and easy! Whenever I'm in the mood for pancakes, I don't like to buy that premade ones anymore, I just whip this together! Every now and then I add my own toppings. I even make waffles out of this batter! Thanks Alot!

My first time making pancakes (with help from my two year old daughter) from scratch and they turned out great.  I reduced baking powder to 2tsp, salt to 1/2 tsp, and added a little cinnamon and vanilla. Thanks.

I have never made pancakes without burning them or ruining them. It's a running family joke. So what possessed me to try again, I'll never know. But these turned out PERFECT! They were fluffy, they tasted GREAT, I got rave reveiws. Definetely a keeper in my 'pancake' folder. Oh... I also used half white flour and half whole wheat flour, SUPERB!

I am not good at making pancakes....I've been working on it for years! My husband gave the ok to these saying they were FLUFFY. They taste great and are super quick to make.  I also did the 2 tsps of baking powder and added vanilla. :) This will be my recipe from now on. No more searching!

I used half the baking powder and added vanilla.  The batter was a little runny, but made tasty cakes a little on the thin side.  Maybe less milk and oil next time, or more flour will make them perfect.

This recipe was quick and easy.  I read the reviews beforehand and used self-rising flour and vanilla flavor to avoid the complaints about salt and baking powder.  I also doubled the recipe because I have 4 kids!  They cleaned their plates.  I froze the leftover pancakes for the next day.  I will definitely use this again and experiment with wheat flour and other flavors.

Very quick, simple, and make beautiful pancakes.  Took the advice of others and lessened the salt to just a pinch.  Also added about 1/4 cup of milk to thin batter just a bit.  But other than that made simple and delicious pancakes. May never use the box again:-). Thanks for recipe.

Pretty good recipe, but our conensus was that there was too much baking powder. Also, we added a little vanilla for more flavor.

This is my basic everyday pancake recipe, and it's pretty good.  A lot of times I'll make variations, like using 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup regular flour, but I've found it works the best if you follow the recipe exactly (with a touch of vanilla, of course).

These pancakes were awful!  WAY too much salt and too much baking powder.  Would never make these again!  Boxed is better by a mile.

This recipe was indeed very easy and tasty, an appreciable feature when you're a student or otherwise time constrained. With a large griddle you can easily be done cooking in under a half hour. This recipe is also a very good base that can easily be modified to your liking. Myself, I like adding a friendly dash of nutmeg and cloves to mine. As well I think that using 1/2 whole wheat flour give the pancakes a rich and tasty flavour, without compromise. Using brown sugar instead of one of the tablespoons is also a nice touch (flowing raw sugar is best to ensure it blends well). Finally, displacing a bit of the flour  (1 tblspoon) with brown rice flour ensures a nice smooth texture and also gives them a slightly more even colour.

I used only 2 teaspoons of baking powder and added a teaspoon of vanilla and the pancakes turned out great.  (Edited to remove a comparison to another recipe.  I decided this one is much better.  Also raised from 4 to 5 stars.)  Thanks!

I like this recipe, it's easy, and uses things you keep on hand. I like being able to provide breakfast when "there's nothing to eat in the house". I think it really doesn't need quite so much baking powder, the dough rises in the bowl between pours, and you have to stir and add more milk as you go. I added 2 tablespoons of maple sugar to the mix, but only because I had it on hand, the recipe is good as it stands. I've also stirred in fresh blueberries on several occasions. It's a good basic recipe.

Seriously, change the baking powder to 2 teaspoons, not 2 tablespoons.  The batter is thin, but the pancakes turn out light and fluffy.  We added a pinch of cinnamon - great taste, great recipe!  We will make these over and over!

These pancakes are easy I can make them. My family could write a book on my pancake tragedies. These were light, fluffy and everyone asked for seconds. That's never happened before! I might cut the salt down a bit next time though . Thanks so much.

These are really good, easy to make, and since the recipe calls for regular milk instead of buttermilk, my stomach can handle it too.

These are good.  I wouldn't say they're the best ever, but good.  I've made them twice, once I used 1/2 the baking powder, & once I used the full amount.  They came out too flat to give 5 stars.  Maybe I need to decrease to 2 tsp as someone else said.  I'll try that next time. I gave 4 stars b/c they are good & easy.

these pancakes came out very fluffy!  i will definitely make them again. i used vanilla rice milk instead of milk and only used 1/2 teas salt and they came out good.  next time I will try using half the baking powder, as I could kinda taste it in the pancakes.

Haven't tried this yet but if they aren't fluffy add some lemon juice or vinegar.  the acidity with the baking soda help make pancakes fluffy

These pancakes were easy to make, fluffy and delicious.  I only put in about 1 1/2 tablespoons of baking powder and I added vanilla and cinnamon as previously suggested.

I was craving pancakes one morning and didn't have pancake mix so I looked up this recipe.  The pancakes were excellent.  Light and fluffy and better than my usual store-bought mix.  I'll definitely make them again.

Well, I may have muddled these up.  They had an odd aftertaste.  So... was it the bit of whole wheat flour I used?  Was it the oil?  I doubt I'll do these again.

My boyfriend gave these 5 stars, but something tasted just a little bit off to me. For the second batch, I added 1 tsp. vanilla & 1 tsp. cinnamon (per other reviewers), which gave the pancakes more of a french-toast flavor. Definitely "Easy", though, and a great base to work from! Thanks!

This is a great basic pancake recipe.  They were easy to make and turned out great, and all the ingredients are things I keep on hand.  I will definitely make these again (and maybe try mixing in blueberries or chocolate chips next time).

I thought this recipe was really easy and really delicious! Instead of using 2 tbs of oil, I only used 1 tsp. I also added 1 tsp of vanilla extract and 1 tsp of cinnamon, and after they were done, I sprinkled a little cinnamon sugar on top and they were just awesome!

The recipe was really easy and the pancakes cooked up nicely.  However, they were extremely sweet, I thought, without any syrup added to them.  I think next time I would use maybe one-fourth to one-half of the sugar called for in the recipe.

Perfect! Simple. I have never been able to make pancakes... complicated recipes are a charmer for me. This while easy came out great.  I also substituted apple cider for milk and they were awesome.  Yeah.  The family has a keeper.

This is the best and easiest pancake recipe.  I've made 3 times already.  I added ripe bananas and reduced the milk for 3/4 cups for a wonderful banana pancake that my hubby & 1 year old just wolfed down.  Thanks!

My family loves this recipe and I make it a few times a week. Sometimes I add a sprinkle of bran or oatmeal into the batter for extra texture. Sometimes I find the batter gets a bit thick so I add in a little bit more milk. I also usually use about half of the recommended amount of baking soda. Since making these, I can't remember why I used to buy the boxed pancake mixes! This is so easy to make.

This is a GREAT recipe. I have used it for months and the pancakes come out tasting great and looking beautiful. The only modification I have made is to mix all of the ingredients, but to beat the eggs separately and add them at the end, being careful to sort of fold them in. Frothy eggs make a pancake with plenty of bubbles so it cooks perfectly. I also add pear or apple compote. My boyfriend and I love them!

Very simple to make,but very salty. I took advice from another review and only added half the amount of salt and it was still a bit salty for us. I would make again and cut back on the baking powder too.

I loved this recipe... quick and easy and tasty. I use a flour that included the baking powder and the salt so I didn't have to add them again. With syrup and fruits, it was very good.

I like pancakes and have tried several different recipes, but this one is by far the best!  I love them!  They are fluffy and sweet (but not too sweet).  They have a lovely aftertaste that is kinda like eating a flavourful cake.  Mmmmmm, this is my number one pancake recipe from now on!

I was looking for a quick blueberry pancake recipe and I found this recipe. It was great. I also reduced the baking soda to 1TBs, but I still saw the BS on top of the pancakes.  My husband and 20 month old loved them.  Thanks.

This recipe was ok, there was too much baking powder. It fluffs up so nice but you can taste the B.P. Will use less next time. Other than that, they were really good, a nice base to add on to.
