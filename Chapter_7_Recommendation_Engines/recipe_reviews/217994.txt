I really enjoyed this. The man liked it too, but with every bite, he said he wished it had crab meat in it. We do live in crab-land, and it's summer, so that did not surprise me. Next time, I will increase the S&P, and use fresh basil instead of dried, and maybe add a little garlic and onion to really make it pop. Thanks!

8.9.18  One-half tomato was lunch today along with a scoop of low-fat cottage cheese.  You do want to make it in the summer when tomatoes are at their peak in flavor.  One thing that I like about this is that the stuffing doesnâ€™t overshadow the actual flavor of the fresh tomato, they share equally.  Quick and easy, healthy, and most importantly, TASTY!

After eating, I felt like i waisted a lot of good ingredients. I like everything in this dish, but the flavor was blah. I will not be making this again.

Love it! Adds something to the typical healthy way to eat a veggie.
