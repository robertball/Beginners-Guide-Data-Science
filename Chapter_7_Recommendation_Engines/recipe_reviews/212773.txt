The dish came out delicious, however I had to add a few modifications. First I increase the oj to about half a cup since I had large fillets, in addition I used perhaps 3 tablespoons of soy sauce. I also added some orange marmalade to give it extra sweetness. Aside from that my family enjoyed the salmon.

I'm a salmon lover & always looking for new sauces and this was very good. I made it as L. Britten wrote it. The sauce was perfect and didn't overwhelm the flavor of the salmon. I used basmati rice & it lended well to the great flavors. This is a keeper!

Had some slices of Alaska salmon[from Alaska] and saw this recipe and gave it a try.Liked it very much but when making it the next time will not put any salt on it it gets enough salt from the soy sauce.Maybe put more orange juice in it.I also used the zest from the orange which gave it more orange flavor

I added more juice to overcome the salt of the soy(low sodium!)  It still wasn't good

I followed the recipe exactly and found the soy sauce overpowered everything.  I didn't taste the orange juice.  I didn't taste the salmon.  Just soy sauce.

I added extra OJ and still wasn't a fan of this dish. There are better salmon dishes that feature OJ on this site.

I used this idea and fiddled with it.  I had some white soy that was really salty so used 2 T with about 3/4ish cup OJ.  Swapped white rice for a whole grain blend.  Made a nice light and  refreshing meal.

the dish was great! my husband loved it. Only one thing, it was a bit too salty for my taste.  Next time i'd cut the soy sauce amount in half  other then that, we really liked it =]
