My husband and I were looking for an easy, one-pot recipe for both lobster and clams. Found this in the June edition of the magazine. I was initially concerned with the amount of liquid in the pot as the lobsters weren't fully submerged, but it worked out great. We also did this on a pot on the grill, and worked perfect for a summer BBQ.
